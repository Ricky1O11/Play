        "description": "User summary:<br/><br/>Sum is a generic, universal rule system that has no associated genre or setting.  The rules are simple and easy to use.  All characters have narrative tags that are descriptive and drive character motivation and goals.  Atypically, these narrative tags also have a value associated with them to indicate how &quot;strong&quot; the narrative tag is.  Characters also have Abilities which collapse all traits into a single category (e.g., there are not Attributes and Skills in this system--there is only the single category of Abilities).  Abilities have scores ranging from -5 to +5.<br/><br/>The core action resolution system involves establishing a target difficulty and subtracting that from the character's ability level.  Then 2d6 are rolled, but one is treated as positive and one is treated as negative (that is, one helps and one hinders).  These dice are summed to the previous value with negative results indicating failure and positive results or zero indicating success.  The system supports varying degrees of success or failure.  Opposed actions are similar except the opponent's ability and roll are contrasted to the actor's ability and roll instead of a target difficulty.  The rules support a group action resolution method, as well, which is quite interesting.<br/><br/>"

        "description": "User summary:<br/><br/>Minions is quite unique - it can be played standalone, in which case it forms a sort of narrative storytelling system, or it can be &quot;bolted on&quot; to any other generic rules mechanics and played as a sort of setting-cum-scenario.  The rules mention FUDGE as being especially suitable for mechanics.<br/><br/>Minions is set in an urban area--time-period irrelevant.  Thus, a medieval fantasy city, a modern metropolis, or a futuristic space station would all work fine.  There just have to be a lot of people concentrated in one place.  The game involves generating thirty-two characters very quickly, so obviously FUDGE or similar systems with very streamlined mechanics are highly preferable to other rules-heavy systems.  These characters are more like &quot;non-player characters&quot; in traditional RPGs than typical &quot;characters&quot;--they may (and do) change players during the game.<br/><br/>The game is played by attempting to weave together the narratives of multiple characters so they become inextricably involved in a single &quot;faction&quot; which forms a support base for the urban area operations.  Atypically, the roleplaying game results in a winner when one player assembles the largest faction and all characters are aligned with a faction.<br/><br/>The rules of minion deal with characters, characterization (brief), and changing loyalties and how this occurs.  These rules may stand alone or, as mentioned, by integrated with any other universal mechanics.<br/><br/>"

Things were kept away from our reality by the presence of the Holy Roman Empire; many of the lives lost that were instrumental in keeping the world hidden. There are things of darkness, madness and evil, which feasted on suffering, pain, and the Emperor Napoleon, brought many of these with him. The blood shed at Austerlitz lit the fuse to blow open the portals to our world.<br/><br/>The Ritual<br/>For centuries, certain priests of the Holy Roman Empire performed a daily ritual to keep our lands safe. However, an errant artillery shell killed them in the middle of this ritual. The sudden brutality of their deaths left it impossible to pass this knowledge on. A week after the death of these priests, the first cracks in the veil begin to manifest.<br/><br/>1808 Austerlitz becomes a nightmare land, those living in the area change. Malformed, demonic shapes, the dead rise to walk once more, other creatures not of our world spew forth in more terrifying forms, the lands became despoiled and changing. This was only the first, they engaged Napoleons armies in battle, and few survived. The sky burned and entire battle groups disappeared in these hellish lands. Many cities of the once great Holy Roman Empire are quickly swallowed up by the blight.<br/><br/>1809 Emperor Napoleon set aside pride and allied with other powers to drive these demonic forces away. However, many of these factions blamed Napoleon for the current state of affairs. They are not far wrong. Nevertheless, they attacked&hellip;and failed. The demon armies grow in strength<br/><br/>1810 You are a member of one of the mockingly self-named Hell Companies. The world has gone mad... and you need to survive, and stay sane. Face to face with demons will test your will and your courage, but first you must reach Rome, find the library at the Quirinal Palace, and locate the tomes needed to seal the rifts.

They are the scales by which the value of all things are measured, and yet they, themselves, have value only because society accepts that they do. The images and words stamped on coins can tell us a great deal about where and when they came from, and they capture and preserve the images of kings, sages, and other great figures, who might otherwise have been lost to the mists of time. They are a convenient window into the realms of the fates, as all can hinge on the flip of a coin. Perhaps most important of all, they are everywhere, and they are something that common man and adventurer alike often take for granted.<br/><br/>This book mints 15 brand new spells that explore these magical aspects of coins, and others. From simple and common cantrips to powerful 9th-level spells, no magic is too small or too great for the magnificent coin. Inside this book you will find:<br/><br/>    Powerful traps that can be laid on a coin, which can do great harm to anyone that has the coin in her possession.<br/>    A spell that allows you to preserve your spirit within a coin, providing a potential reprieve from death.<br/>    A spell that allows you to gamble great amounts of magical power on a single coin flip.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>...and much more!<br/><br/>"

        "description": "From the Introduction:<br/><br/>In the beginning, underneath Heaven, there was Nothing. Nothing happened because nothing had to happen; and there was nothing there to stop it, of course. Entropy ruled the void, reining on a throne of illogic.<br/><br/>The Old Ones, finding the world full of nothingness, created Causes. Causes demanded Effect. And thus, the age of Nil became the age of Chaos, the world turning into a primordial ooze of senseless Happenings, an endless howling of insanity. And thus was the universe created.<br/><br/>The Titans, finding the world full of madness, created Justifications. Only Effects could create Causes, but Causes could create Effects. Slowly, the howling void of the age of Chaos became the age of Order, each Titan carving out a Plane to call their Own. And thus were the planes created.<br/><br/>The Sage Kings, finding the world torn asunder into competing kingdom ringed by realms of chaos, sought to unify the Causes - fire and water, air and earth, metal and wood, light and dark, holy and profane, emotion and logic. So did the Sage Kings between them craft the System, which unified the competing Causes into one System of checks and balances, reason and design, merit and necessity, an age of Laws. And thus was the world created.<br/><br/>In crafting the world, just like the forces before them, the Sage Kings sowed their own destruction. In creating the System, they created peoples to enact its laws: human and elf, goblin and troll, orc and fairy, each of the countless races made in the image of their Sage. People who question if the System is not a unification of the causes. merely another Cause whose Effect is simple self-perpetuation, who chafe under an unjust Heaven - but the System, being created by the combined effort of the Sage-Kings, is greater than the Sage-Kings, greater than the Titans, perhaps even greater than the Old Ones themselves. It is the cusp of a new age led by the Folk, where the races created by the Sages take up the mantle of Heaven and direct the System with their own hands.<br/><br/>But even if it is the time for the children of the Sage Kings to take the mantle of Heaven, none know what Age is going to come to pass...<br/><br/>"

Players select an Archetype (preferably from a horror movie) to model their character upon.  Characters then receive Traits which are narrative tags describing anything notable about the character--usually 5-10 Traits are selected.  Traits are given a numeric score of 1-20, optionally as high as 30 or even 40 with GM consent.<br/><br/>Action resolution is based upon traits and difficulty.  Really Easy tasks are rated at +10, Hard at -10, and Impossible at -20.  These modifiers are added to the relevant Trait and then 1d20 must score under the result for success.  Attempting an action without a relevant trait uses a separate table.<br/><br/>"

        "description": "User summary:<br/><br/>Sicarius - Base Role Playing System is a complex, generic, universal system that provides a fusion of class and skill based gaming.  The game is played with d10s but has an alternate mechanism using a pack of playing cards.  When percentile dice are rolled they can &quot;explode&quot; into &quot;Infinite Dice&quot; on particularly good rolls.  The GM is called the Arbiter; the other players run Characters.  Characters have a selected Class and then use a point pool to purchase Skills (Skill costs vary by Class/Skill combination).  Characters also have nine Primary Stats (Might, Endurance, Agility, Dexterity, Intelligence, Resolve, Spirit, Personality, and Luck) and several other possible Stats such as Tech Level.  Characters have additional statistics that vary during game play such as Life, Power, Quickness, and Fatigue.  A variety of other performance abilities are mathematically derived from, generally, Primary Stats (for example, Social, Occult, Control, and Sensitivity).<br/><br/>Skill attempts are resolved by rolling under a Difficulty Factor established by the GM.  Other types of rolls made in the game include Primary Stat rolls, Luck rolls, and so forth.  Skill levels increase through use and training; increases are more likely for characters with high intelligence.  Because most game actions are based on Skills, characters with low intelligence rapidly will stall out in ability relative to characters with high intelligence.<br/><br/>The system uses a quite complex combat methodology with Combat Turns broken into Combat Pulses.  Characters use a variety of inputs to determine their Action Pulse value which is referenced on a chart to determine which Combat Pulse(s) they may act upon.  This is modified by a variety of situational values called Quickness Modifiers.  Combat supports a variety of special actions such as parry or natural (non-weapon) attacks.  Weapons supported range from clubs to heavy artillery to pulse cannon.  Armors appear in several types--some decrease hit chance, others absorb damage, and still others do both.  A Fatigue system is used which influences Skill performance and Combat performance.  Damage sustained also influences various performance metrics.<br/><br/>"

        "description": "User summary:<br/><br/>Fables Light is an almost entirely narrative roleplaying game.  A typical game has one to five characters, called Protagonists, and a Director (or GM) that establishes the setting, plays the Antagonists (non-player characters), and resolves any issues that cannot be resolved through collaborative narration.  Additionally, the Director is responsible for taking notes and compiling a post-game summary.<br/><br/>The game is concerned with recreating exciting scenes, linked together by narrative arcs to create a campaign.  Characters are defined as players see fit, but generally follow a description with personality elements and traits.  They grow and change as the game progresses.  The rules essentially deal with methods to streamline activity and provide for speedy, exciting play.<br/><br/>"

Characters begin with two Skills, each at Level 1 (Skill Levels range from 1-5).  Characters also may cast spells (called Shards).  Characters gain one Experience Point for each event they attend and may spend these Experience Points to gain new Skills or Shards, or to improve a current Skill.<br/><br/>The rules document explains the various Houses and their structure and function within the game, and has a lengthy section on setting, history, and society.

You can even move them on the table and in the air. With the person card Luca, for example, it is easier to portray a racecar driver in his car or a parachuter under a slightly bended card.

Such a sad mistake.&rdquo;<br/>   &ndash;George R.R. Martin, A Game of Thrones<br/><br/>In the aftermath of the Tourney for the Hand, Eddard Stark searches for answers to the questions posed by Jon Arryn&rsquo;s death. Across the Narrow Sea, Daenerys Targaryen rides across the Dothraki sea to Vaes Dothrak with a massive khalasar and her husband, Khal Drogo. The Great Houses stir restlessly across Westeros, watching and plotting their own bids for power. From the sands of Dorne to the icy forests beyond the Wall, tension grows with every passing day.<br/><br/>Enter the unrest and intrigue of A Game of Thrones: The Card Game with No Middle Ground, the fourth Chapter Pack in the Westeros cycle!

Under Helmuth von Moltke the Elder, the German states used superior logistics, advanced artillery, and a strategy of envelopment to terrorize the sluggish and unprepared French.<br/><br/>Historically, it ended with the capitulation and capture of Napoleon III after a mere five weeks. The game slants historically but is intended for competitive play: the French will almost always lose the war, but a good French Player can win the game.<br/><br/>Tom Russell's designs tend to have unusual combat or activation mechanisms, but in this game he utilizes a mostly traditional, odds-based CRT and Logistics-Move-Combat sequence of play. A liberal strategic movement rule allows for lightning-fast encirclements, while subtle differences in each side's logistic phase, organizational structure, and the rounding of combat factors reflect the doctrinal and technological differences that proved decisive.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "User summary:<br/><br/>Fantasized Adventures is available online as HTML or can be downloaded as multiple DOC files.  The HTML formatting is difficult to use because the material is divided into quite small units.  It is a rules-heavy game with much complexity.<br/><br/>Characters have an Occupation, which is somewhat analogous to a Class found in typical RPGs though less restrictive and less significant.  Characters also have nine Attributes (Agility, Appearance, Constitution, Dexterity, Intelligence, Leadership, Luck, Strength, and Wisdom) that are randomly generated wish scores ranging from 3-18 before racial adjustments.  The game supports &quot;Exceptional Attributes&quot; for high scores.  Characters also calculate a RALF (Roll Attribute Luck Factor) Score and calculate Action Points (how much a character can do during a round) and Movement Points (how far a character can move during a round).  Each Attribute has a variety of effects on various classes and the relationships become quite complex.  Characters gain Experience and can advance in Rank.<br/><br/>Characters use Skills by, generally, rolling d100 and trying to roll below their situational modified Skill Rank.  However, Skills have assigned Letter Codes and other nuances that make Skill resolution complicated.  Combat generally is resolved with a d20 compared to a &quot;to hit&quot; calculation, but again numerous modifiers and rules come into play making the entire process complex.<br/><br/>The rules are tightly linked to a unique setting, with e.g. special rules carried throughout for several unique races and various Skills depending upon race, occupation, or region.  However, the primary definition of the setting is found in a companion work, The World of Ba'Kara.<br/><br/>"

Originally, this was intended to be a paid-for publication containing material DwD Studios produced, along with some fan-generated content in a profit-sharing model. However, due to the popularity of the game and the ever-growing community, we wanted to continue our roots of community development like we have done with our other fan-based products and sites.<br/><br/>This magazine is something we can all develop together and be proud of. Designed to be small, lite, but full of fun content, we hope you enjoy this issue, as we plan on many more to come. As long as gamers are contributing content they&rsquo;ll have a place within the pages of Decahedron.<br/><br/>Within issue you'll find:<br/><br/>    Another great cover by Joe Calkins.<br/>    A spotlight on Ben Gorman, a great game and friend.<br/>    New equipment and a short example of magic item values.<br/>    D100 tables we enjoy, this one is for things found in a pocket.

This thuggish fool has been cursed with great power, despite having no sense of responsibility! Not the world's most inspiring leader, he still brings with him a number of power level 7 thugs who're just as obnoxious and bull-headed (well, figuratively) as their leader. Minotarr is a classic villain archetype in the Beacon City universe, but can be dropped into any campaign with very little alteration.<br/><br/>Minotarr is designated &quot;Violet&quot; for his magical origins. This can attract the attention of heroes of a mystic bent who aren't used to dealing with foes who are so direct in their villainy or methods of combat. Of course, because Minotarr holds grudges easily, he makes a great nemesis for any hero who stands between him and whatever he wants to grab by force. Editor's Note: Paired with Ticktock, Minotarr makes for a fun &quot;Old West&quot; themed episode of your game. Your players may get a lot of mileage out of bull puns at his expense!<br/><br/>"

Although we hope you enjoy this adventure, it also serves as a tutorial to playing a pick pocket in F.A.T.A.L.  Knowledge of F.A.T.A.L. is not required, but recommended.  To participate in this adventure, you need a set of role-playing dice, most importantly three 10-sided dice.  Scratch paper and a pen or pencil are also necessary, for example, so you can keep track your character&rsquo;s money.<br/><br/>To participate in this adventure, read the text until you are prompted either to make a decision or roll dice.  When you make a decision, click on the hyperlink that corresponds best with your decision.  This adventure does not attempt to list all possible decisions, or places where decisions may be made, but offers decisions important to the adventure.  When prompted to roll dice, roll the appropriate dice on a hard surface.<br/><br/>When prompted to make a skill check, you will be asked to roll 3d10.  This means that you must roll three 10-sided dice.  Sum the results.  Next, a modifier may be listed on the screen.  Apply the modifier to your sum.  Consider your result and report it by clicking on the appropriate hyperlink.  Higher results are better for your character.<br/><br/>What do you do?<br/><br/>User summary:<br/><br/>An online, HTML-only, &quot;choose your own adventure&quot; type scenario.  Generally, each page ends with two options.  Occasional dice rolls are required.  Various endings are possible.<br/><br/>"

        "description": "User summary:<br/><br/>The premise of FERpg is to provide a very simple, &quot;single use&quot;, rule set for gaming so that experienced gamers can take an occasional break from their normal roleplaying system and have a fun one-off or two-off adventure with another system.  To this end, the rules here are exceptionally simple and fast.<br/><br/>One player will be the GameRunner, a sort of narrative expert and tie-breaker (light-weight GM); the remaining players will create characters.  Characters have a name and &quot;some quick info&quot; which are narrative tags describing appearance and ability.  For the Character's Main Job, a rank of 2d4+2 is assigned.  For their Secondary Job, a rank of 1d4+2 is assigned.  For anything else, a rank of 1d4 is assigned.  All scores summed provide Hit Points.  Characters then buy equipment.<br/><br/>For any attempted action that is non-trivial, players roll 1d12 and must roll under their relevant Ability.  If the character has no relevant ability they use their lowest score divided by two, rounded up (usually, they will have to roll a 1 to succeed).  After every session, players have three chances to improve a Character Ability--1d12 is rolled and if it rolls over the ability then the ability increases by one.<br/><br/>In Combat, initiative is determined by coin flip.  Characters again roll under a target, this time their opponents relevant defensing ability (if any).  For anything not covered in the rules or for any arguments that may arise, the GameRunner makes a decision which is final.<br/><br/>The rules also include two brief scenarios:  Mobhits, a gangster scenario in New York City during the 1920s; and, Gapnack, a comical fantasy scenario with odd flying things.<br/><br/>"

Forage, Salvage, Recruit, and Assault all use Dice Rolls to predict success. Whereas control is Placement specific and is an active or passive bonus earned from Controlling The Area.<br/><br/>The game at its heart is a Player Elimination Game that revolves around a Take That mechanic where player life is represented by  Food, and by Wastelanders alive.   The game is lost when all Wastelanders have been killed or starved to death the later dealing with major elements of Player Verse Environment.<br/><br/>What is a Socio-Economic Apocalypse?

For decades the band changed its look, members, and stage show, but their hypnotic music gave meaning and voice to generations and their rallying fans never waivered. Now, age and tedium have reduced the band to a shell of its former self. Bickering, politics, and music industry woes threaten to stop the tour before it even starts.<br/><br/>Protocol is a series of story roleplaying games that thrusts characters together into dramatic situations. Each game uses the same set of rules, with vastly different parameters, start points, characters, and finales. Players take on the roles of directors outside the action and characters inside the action, using the ebb and flow of four different scene-framing styles (vignettes, interrogations, interludes, and ensembles) to tell meaningful stories about characters in crisis.<br/><br/>Each game in the Protocol series is zero-prep for 3 or more players. The game length is exponentially long, so games with more players take more time to complete. The Protocol Series requires a deck of poker cards as well as tokens to track drama points.<br/><br/>"

Instead, before each game a new starting position is created by placing game pieces on the board at random. As there are billions of possible starting positions, each game is different from the next. Because the starting position is randomized, it seldom offers equal opportunities for both players and you may well need luck to win. Sometimes you can find yourself much worse off from the very beginning; in such positions all what you can do is to minimize your loss. Do not get discouraged: Xoliba is played in matches and the next game might well be yours.<br/><br/>The objective of the game is to create triangles. The game is won by the player who has the biggest triangle on the board when the game ends. Moves are made by changing places of the player's own piece and a neutral white piece in such a manner that a new triangle is formed. If such a triangle contains player's own or opponent's pieces, they are captured. The game ends when no new triangles can be formed. The winner scores points from enemy pieces that have been captured. The match is won by the player who is the first to reach or exceed 50 points. Of course, it is not obligatory to play up to 50 points. If the players so wish, they can also play shorter or longer matches, for example, up to 35 points.<br/><br/>Equipment<br/><br/>7x7 octagonal board with 45 intersections (corners cut off), points, where horizontal, oblique, and vertical lines cross each other. Game pieces are 57 discs. Each disc has a white side but the colour of the opposite side varies: in 17 discs it is red, in 17 discs it is blue, in 12 it is green and in 11 it is white.<br/><br/>",

The Echelon Reference Series aims to make this easier for everyone by gather information for each class into a single book.<br/><br/>Echelon Reference Series: Rogues collects information about the rogue and ninja classes. The base classes, archetypes for both classes, and rogue talents, advanced talents, ninja tricks, and master ninja tricks are all contained within. This book also has feats appropriate to both classes and their archetypes, and there are stat blocks for NPCs of all levels and many races.<br/><br/>This is the PRD-Only version, containing information from the PRD.<br/><br/>"

Most rules apply only to a single (or a few) class.<br/><br/>Characters begin with three Classes, each of which enables access to some class-specific Skills.  Skill use, in all but trivial cases, requires a 3d6 roll below the Skill Rating.  Situational modifiers may apply.  Characters have a single &quot;Stat&quot; that functions like a universal Skill--if no Skill applies to a situation, characters roll against their &quot;Stat&quot;.<br/><br/>"

After initial promising signs, the offensive was stopped by German counterattacks. Critical errors by several staff officers and by Joseph Stalin, who failed to accurately estimate the 6th Army's potential and overestimated their own newly trained forces, led to a German pincer attack which cut off advancing Soviet troops from the rest of the front.

Here elements battered the body, removing the flesh and sending the spirits onto their next destination. After a year passed, the sun bleached bones would be cast down into the base of the tower, where a massive pit waited. This was the way of the first Zelanders, for the first 500 years.

Martin Luther has recently posted his 95 theses, setting off the firestorm of religious wars known as the Reformation. Malleus Mallificarum has been published and, although condemned by the church, is widely used in the persecution of witches.<br/><br/>Cover: The Village includes a new rotating Inner Wheel to replace the one from the base game. It also adds 36 Village Cards the replace the original Balance Cards, and a Village card is read when the new Inner Wheel triggers the Full Moon.  Suspicion Tokens track how suspicious the villagers are of each player, and are gained whenever you increase Balance. Suspicion may also gain Personal Edict Cards, which are penalties that last for the remainder of the game, and may even prevent you from winning unless certain conditions are met. Coven: The Village also includes 36 Village Cards, 15 Personal Edict Cards, 30 Suspicion Tokens, 5 new Reference Cards, Rules, a six sided die, and an additional spindle.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "User summary:<br/><br/>FFRPS, the Free Fantasy Role Playing System, was developed with several design goals in mind.  Primarily, it was free, with rules that attempted to be intuitively simple.  A secondary goal to enable &quot;paperless&quot; play (via software) was not particularly successful.  The game is interesting inasmuch as it was intended only as a partial replacement for TSR's Advanced Dungeons &amp; Dragons.  Major portions of FFRPS used the AD&amp;D ruleset without modification.  Other portions of FFRPS were completely new material.  It can thus be viewed as either a large-scale &quot;variant&quot; rule set for AD&amp;D or as an independent game that borrows heavily from AD&amp;D.  Either interpretation is correct, depending upon focus.  An add-on component of science and technology was contemplated but not produced.<br/><br/>The major ways in which FFRPS was innovative surrounded character and NPC creation and the implementation of magic within a campaign.  It is safe to say that in nearly all other respects it was a near-clone of AD&amp;D.  Characters in FFRPS were required to be human.  They had two types of Characteristics--Primaries and Secondaries.  Six Primaries were defined:  Strength, Intelligence, Faith, Dexterity, Constitution, and Charisma--usually ranging from -2 to +2.  Primary ranks were purchased from a point pool.  Three Secondaries were defined:  Mana, To Hit Armor Class 0 (&quot;THAC0&quot;), and Hit Points.  Secondary ranks were derived values.  Characters' proficiency was noted in several &quot;levels&quot;:  Adventuring Level, Combat Level, Magic Level, and Piety Level.  Secondary Skills were deleted in favor of a narrative character background.<br/><br/>Magic was reworked to use a mana point system, with spells placed in schools.  Some spell parameters (range, duration, area-of-effect) could be varied at casting time.  Spell Levels were somewhat dynamic based upon desired outcomes.  However, every spell cast had a potential of failure, determine using a complex formula.  Spell targets were allowed saving throws using a complex formula.<br/><br/>"

The player playing Sweyn starts at the center of the board with 1 king and 28 vikings. Harald starts as an outer rim on the board with 1 king and 47 vikings.<br/><br/>The players take turn moving one piece at a time. Pieces are moved horizontally or vertically - never diagonally - on the board. Vikings can move as many or few spaces as they want in one direction without crossing other pieces. Kings can only move one space at a time.<br/><br/>Kings can only be beaten by a king moving to the same space. Vikings can be beaten by having enemy pieces on 2 opposite sides of it. Beaten pieces are removed from play. A piece is captured if it is surrounded by pieces on all 4 sides and at least one of these are an enemy piece.<br/><br/>Sweyn wins by having his king reach the outer rim of the board or by capturing or beating Harald. Harald wins by capturing Sweyn or by beating him.<br/><br/>"

There is always a plenty of those who are eager to take this place, so when such a chance comes up, they&rsquo;re ready to take it by all means.<br/><br/>The city of Urbis is ruled by the City Council elected by the residents. The main objective of the game is to become the Head of the Council. Like all the other players, you are a Council member who is responsible for the well-being and prosperity of the city.  Each Council member (player) has an access to the city treasury and guard, and is obliged to follow the Council&rsquo;s decreets. Each councillor is in charge of one of the city blocks (represented by a board given to each player in the beginning of the game) and aspires to develop his block either quickly or proficiently. Gold and silver from the treasury are distributed depending on the buildings that have been put up on the block. However the block residents are always on the lookout: no one wants to live close to the cemetery, gibbet or prison. Take thought for the residents, spend some money, and these grim buildings will appear on the neighbour&rsquo;s block instead of your own. Hospital is also an essential city institution but it demands substantial charges to maintain. Taking this into account a player might awaken his inner dictator and build up his block with slums and honky-tonks, regardless of the residents&rsquo; needs, because the first player to fill all the building slots on his block becomes a winner.  Which way is the best? To consider the block residents or to just execute the will of the Council? To turn your block into a dark place or a blooming garden? In Urbis you&rsquo;ll have to make decisions promptly.<br/><br/>"

But five days ago, a mysterious evil power opened the gate and changed the code. Asteros is haunted by fear and disasters again! The wise leader ORAKL asked the Council of United Planets and they sent four famous agents: EKHO, HAL, ELLI and NOVA. ORAKL the wise and the four brave agents begin to fight against the evil powers to save Asteros. They must find the Code to reset the Gate and confine the monsters again. People call them &quot;Rising 5&quot;, hoping they will be able to restore peace on the planet.<br/><br/>Rising 5: Runes of Asteros&nbsp;is a co-operative deduction and adventure game with a mobile phone application or a game master. Players must find the answer Code with the four Runes in the right arrangement before the evil power devours the planet. Players can explore the planet to collect energy or clues and to fight against evil monsters. When players try to unlock the code, the App or the game master will give signs that lead to right code.<br/><br/>If players successfully find the code, they win; if the Darkness Level reaches the Red Moon because of the evil monsters or if the Character card deck is exhausted, the players lose the game.<br/><br/>",

Each player starts of with a private fortune, a company and a company fortune.<br/><br/>The turn order is decided by the company you start with and every time you pass start you will be able to buy more companies - and thereby get more turns each round. Passing start also adds more money to your fortune and allows you to pay out dividend from your company if you have qualified.<br/><br/>Movement is decided by rolling either one or two dice - the player decides - but if you roll 2 and get two of the same you will receive a bonus. Where you land you will have to pay rent but that will also allow you to place your company logo on the square. From then on all players that land on the square will have to pay you rent as well.<br/><br/>If you get your logo on 5 different types of squares or a lot of players land on the same squares this makes the companies on them worth more.<br/><br/>In the game you can pay to get helpers in the form of lawyers and accountants that makes it possible to buy and sell more companies and negate consequences of special squares and event cards such as tax and a visit from the Fraud Squad.<br/><br/>Before the game starts it is decided when to end the game: At a certain time, at a certain fortune, at a certain number of companies owned or so on. The game should have a length of minimum an hour though. When the game ends your fortune is tallied up and the one with the largest one wins.<br/><br/>"

This shield wasn't blocking all of the damage, though: he felt himself get shaken with every hit. Worse yet, his strength was slowly leaking away: keeping the heavy shield up took much of his energy. He needed an opening soon...<br/><br/><br/><br/>        Then, the demon clutched its club above its head with both hands, ready to land a devastating blow. That was the chance Mamoru had been waiting for! With the demon gearing up for the attack, its right side was open. He rolled to the right and struck the Oni's exposed flank as its club smashed into the crumbling pavement where Mamoru had stood only moments before.<br/><br/><br/><br/>        It was not enough. Unexpectedly, the demon followed up with a wide sweep of its club, catching Mamoru's unshielded left side. Mamoru felt his strength leave his body, the dark power of the Miasma flowing over and out of him.<br/><br/><br/><br/>        Minutes later, he opened his eyes again. He was back at the base camp, his captain prodding him with the back-end of his lance. &quot;You died there, boy. All of us did. Got too greedy. Get up, we're going to try again to slay that Oni. Let's hope our power is still there when we get back to its lair.&quot;<br/><br/><br/>Miasma is a game where you play a samurai, infected by a dark miasma that has held the Imperial Capital in its grip for centuries. In this game, you will wage desperate battles against the monsters that appeared in the wake of the miasma. To stop the monsters from overtaking all of the land, you will become a monster yourself, and commit your body and soul to the fight.<br/><br/>"

Gather the ingredient elements within the time limit, throw them into a magical pot, and create the minions written in the recipes. The one who has created many and powerful minions wins the competition!<br/><br/>The Minion Recipes takes place over five rounds, and in each round players draft both element cards and pot cards. When a player has a pot and the necessary elements to complete one of the recipes on display, they can stop the round in order to create the minion, possibly taking advantage of its special ability at the same time. Players can drop out of the round in the middle of a draft, throwing away the remaining cards instead of passing them, but they forfeit the ability to create a minion. Players can carry over three cards into the next round, giving them a head start toward a recipe, but everyone can see which recipes are available, so you'll still be racing to complete something before anyone else.<br/><br/>"

What you hold before you represents the culmination of a year-long project. It is a continuation of the setting that was started in 1994 by William W. Connors and TSR. It was written and reviewed to some degree, though it does not bear the strong foundations of a work rigorously tested. That, we leave to you. We hope you enjoy what we have worked on. We hope that you use our material to craft your own games, your own stories, and  your own worlds.

Not every day, but it happens often enough that it&rsquo;s handy to be able to give a five-minute demonstration that will hopefully pique the inquirer's interest for more.<br/><br/>Nickel &amp; Dime is just that: a demo game that&rsquo;s a tiny example (just two pages!) of a traditional RPG.  It includes two five-minute encounters: run one, it's a nickel. Run them both, it's a dime!<br/><br/>To play, you need two coins of different values.  In these rules, the lesser value coin is called a nickel (5&cent;) and the greater a dime (10&cent;), but any two values will do.<br/><br/>Nickel &amp; Dime: Robin Hood's Band of Outlaws is the first in a series of different genres.  The more well-known a genre, the easier it is for a new player to &quot;get into character.&quot;  Robin Hood is one of the better known motifs outside of licensed properties, and so was chosen as the first instance of Nickel &amp; Dime.<br/><br/>"

The remainder of the adventure will either be up to the GM or will need to follow the film script (links to various film resources, including an online script, were provided but are no longer active).<br/><br/>Apart from the scenario itself, included DM resources are:  two races, four professions, five skills, seven items (mostly weapons), six vehicles, and ten major NPCs (Korben, Leeloo, etc.).

The average game will last 30-60 minutes.<br/><br/>In AGES, each player will travel back in time to collect artifacts, historical figures, locations, and check out famous events throughout the history of mankind. Whoever assembles the greatest historical collection will be the winner.<br/><br/>Wage a war of the ages as you travel through time recruiting history's most influential people. Which path will you choose? Will you take solace in Art? Will you go the path of the righteous and seek out the Good? Or will you go the path of the conqueror and seek out Evil? Perhaps the knowledge contained within Science? The choice is yours.<br/><br/>Along the way, players will need to pick up various Icons to activate the cards they purchase. To do this, players need to remember that AGES isn't just the name of the game, it's also an acronym: Art, Good, Evil, and Science<br/><br/>So get ready to talk strategy with Napoleon, visit the California Gold Rush, and hold the Dead Sea Scrolls in your hands.<br/><br/>Play continues until a face-up supply of cards representing key historical individuals has been exhausted with victory going to the player with the highest point total.<br/><br/>"

Breaking free of the tradition of latex layered aliens and sterile societies in a formless future, Firefly offered a grittier view of a human frontier that had to reach back into the simpler technologies of the Earth frontiers.<br/><br/>User summary:<br/><br/>The document (through Version 0.6a) was intended to be utilized with the &quot;Mayonnaise for Firefly&quot; roleplaying system.  &quot;Mayonnaise&quot; was a variation on the rules presented in Fuzion.  When the present document was updated to Version 0.7a all references to &quot;Mayonnaise&quot; were removed, leaving the document a generic resource for nearly any game system.  Some of the weapons entries still include categorizations that apply to Fuzion, though they are quite generic.  The document also suggests the contents would be quite suitable for the HERO System.<br/><br/>"

Most animals have different types of advantages and disadvantages &mdash; some are very strong, while others are very agile, some can fly, some breathe water. Plant capabilities and drawbacks can be even more strange and profound.<br/><br/>What kind of animal do you want to play? How &ldquo;human&rdquo; do you want your animal character to be?

Crimson Dragon Slayer is heavily inspired by the 1980's.  The parts of it that are god-awful are god-awful on purpose (mostly).  Your adventuring party might contain a robot ranger with laser sword, infernal elf wizard with machine gun, and crystalline / pixie fairy princess hybrid brandishing a two-handed dagger, all tooling around in a Mel Gibson interceptor... looking for cyber crowns, magic items, and bodacious bimbos.  Can you bring Lord Varkon down before his crimson dragons rip Thule a new one?<br/><br/>So, what's in it?  A self-contained system that's not d20, yet mostly compatible with the original fantasy roleplaying game and all the clones published since.  You roll multiple d6s, the higher the better, relying on improvisation more than defacto results.  There are several classes and many races to choose from.  Also, strange yet eerily familar spells, magic items, monsters, and the mother of all name generators!<br/><br/>If all goes well, it will be like pretending you're a wizard or warrior in the backyard waving a stick around as if it was a staff or sword... put a tattered red sweatervest on the dog, maybe he can be the dragon.<br/><br/>There's also an introductory adventure at the end featuring all-too-familiar 80's film characters, several arcade game monsters, and stuff that Lovecraft was too ashamed to write about.<br/><br/>"

Fend off terrifying monsters like the T-Rex with everyday objects, wit and a sharp tongue!<br/><br/><br/><br/>You&rsquo;re walking down the street with a balloon in your hand, chewing gum in your mouth and a skunk on your shoulder. You&rsquo;re just about to call your best friend, as you see a zombie that&rsquo;s slowly approaching you on a unicycle. You can&rsquo;t run, you can&rsquo;t hide, so what are you gonna do? You&rsquo;ve got 4 objects at hand&hellip;Manic Monster Mayhem is a card game about stopping monsters with everyday objects.<br/><br/>3-5 players<br/>~30-45 min<br/><br/>How it works:<br/><br/>Each player gets 4 different objects, with which they have to stop beasts like a T-Rex on a pogo-stick from attacking. How they get rid of that beast is up to them &ndash; defeating, bribing, seducing, scaring... everything goes. Almost.<br/><br/>But since there are no heroines or brave adventurers among them, our poor players have to face ghastly monsters with ordinary things like spoons, lemons, vacuum cleaners and ladders. So the only way to succeed is using their wit and creativity &ndash; alright, a sharp tongue might be helpful as well&hellip;<br/><br/>Setup:<br/>- Each player takes a pen and a piece of paper and writes his/her name on it<br/>- Draw 1 Monster and put it in the middle of the table<br/>- Hand out 4 item cards to each player<br/>- Select starting player<br/><br/>As soon as the game is set up and a monster has been selected, our &quot;heoroes&quot; have to tell the others how they defeat the gharstly beast. Hereby the players take turns, beginning with the starting player.<br/><br/>Once all players have told their story, they secretly vote for the best one, writing the name of that player down. Afterwards a new round begins and a new player becomes the starting player.<br/><br/>After every monster has been defeated (number of monster = number of players) and everyone has voted, the grumpiest player counts the votes and announces the winner!<br/><br/>"

You play one of three characters with specific shooting patterns to their WW1 planes against a confusing array of other WW1 planes,  WW2 planes (and tanks), and stuff that looks like alien spacecraft, all shooting blue and pink weapons that slowly move across the screen towards you.   The animation and action are similar to other shoot 'em ups from this era, like Crimzon Clover, but this game has a button to convert all enemy bombs into coins.   There are 5 levels (and bosses), although the game difficulty changes depending on how many coins you have greedily (貪欲 Don-Yoku) taken.<br/><br/>"

It is a potent pursuit, but takes much time to master, though such things matter little to one as yourself. Walking is perhaps the easiest and safest way to cross through the Fog and enter the Grey. Some men, even those ignorant of our Art may perform it by mistake. To Walk through the Fog and into the Grey is something I believe all Men were born with the ability to accomplish. Even mere beasts seem to possess the rudimentary facilities necessary to cross the threshold. The trick lies in mastering oneself. To master one's self is to master the universe, or so Moore said.<br/><br/>"

Who will win?<br/>Whatever is your role, be on the watch and don't trust to easily on what other players say!<br/><br/>The following roles did not exist in One Night Werewolf, but do exist in both One Night Ultimate Werewolf as well as dV Gicochi&rsquo;s Una Notte da Lupi.<br/><br/>Troublemaker: This is almost exactly the same as in One Night Ultimate Werewolf (Una Notte da Lupi has the limitation that the switched characters are limited to the players to the left and right of the Troublemaker)<br/><br/>Masons: This is exactly the same as the Masons One Night Ultimate Werewolf<br/><br/>Miteane: This is exactly the same as the Minion in One Night Ultimate Werewolf<br/><br/>Sorcerer&rsquo;s Apprentice: This appears to be the same as the Alpha Wolf character from One Night Ultimate Werewolf Daybreak (the translation is not very good)<br/><br/>Werewolf Penguin: This is exactly the same as the Tanner for One Night Ultimate Werewolf<br/><br/>Mortovio: This appears to be the Hunter from One Night Ultimate Werewolf (again, there are a few issues with the translation)<br/><br/>In addition, Una Notte da Lupi provides tokens that correspond to the roles used in the game, something that One Night Ultimate Werewolf has, and One Night Werewolf does not.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "With a Purpose is the next supplement book for the modular Victory By Any Means campaign system with a focus on objectives and goals. Campaigns have a tendency to focus on goals and exclude the story element. This expansion has a more granular scope, focusing on a commodore instead of a supreme commander. Instead of an open ended campaign, players are working to achieve victory points.<br/><br/>This is done by defining the major objectives given to the players from their central government. Additionally, players will receive high priority missions that need to be completed. Campaign Moderators will have more freedom to explore the motivations of an empire, becoming a true 5x game (eXpand, eXploit, eXterminate, eXplore, and eXplain). With A Purpose supports a number of players and team play for those players who wish to try cooperative campaign games.<br/><br/>Since players represent low level commanders than a typical Victory by Any Means campaign, the scope of the degree is altered. Campaign turns represent shorter periods of time and each ship and ground unit is all the more precious to pull off the work given from their central command. The area will simply have more territory to explore as these campaigns include more minor systems that may exist between all the important campaign worlds in a normal game. Players must be ever vigilant of their actions and careful to control the amount of tension in the region.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Capturing the real-world thrill and challenges of planetary exploration, XTRONAUT&trade;: The Game of Solar System Exploration gives 2 &ndash; 4 players ages 7 and up the chance to develop space missions and explore the solar system. The game is based on real planetary missions and rocket science. It also contains elements of politics and strategy that are inspired by the real-life situations that space missions face.<br/><br/>How do you complete your space mission?<br/><br/>Each player selects a Mission Card from the deck. This card determines the player's mission &ndash; the mission destination, type of spacecraft needed, the amount of Delta-V needed to achieve the mission, the potential to obtain gravity assists, and the points earned for completing the mission. Delta-V stands for change in velocity, and as applied to space missions and this game, it means the change in velocity necessary for a spacecraft to complete a selected mission.<br/><br/>Game play is straightforward. On their turn each player draws a playing card, plays up to three Action Cards, trades with other players, and places components on their game board. The Action Cards add real-life issues to the game that space missions often encounter - project cancellations, audits, government shutdowns, and other exciting twists and turns.<br/><br/>To complete a mission you must populate your game board with the right combination of cards for mission success. Each player needs to collect the Playing Cards that give them the right spacecraft, first and second stage rockets, and matching fairings. Gravity assist and solid rocket booster cards are available to provide additional Delta-V if needed to complete the assigned mission. Once the mission is complete, the player earns the points for the mission, which varies based on the size of the spacecraft and the target, and starts work on their next mission. The first player to score 10 points wins.<br/><br/>",

The game is divided into nine major areas, eight of which are divided into several topical areas, as follows:<br/><br/><br/>     Entry: Welcome, Mamoru Nagano<br/>     Act I: Introduction, How to Role-Play, Playing Materials, Role-Playing Session, The Rules, RPG Terms<br/>     Act II: Creating a Character, Phase 1, Phase 2, Phase 3, Character Skills, Skills List, Personal, Physical, Scientific, Technical, Pilot, Military, Weapons<br/>     Act III: Hand-to-Hand Combat, Phase 1, Phase 2, Phase 3<br/>     Act IV: Psionics, Ability List, Ability Descriptions, Levels 1 through 10<br/>     Act V: Equipment &amp; Mechanics, Clothing, Food &amp; Rations, Utilities, Electronics, Weapons, Body Armor, Bioware, Bioware Implant List, Bioware Weapons, Bioware Equipment<br/>     Act VI: Gamemastering, Creating a Scenario<br/>     Five Star Stories World: The Prologue, The Setting, Joker Star Systems, Timeline, The Knight/Headliner, The Diver, The Fatima, Mortar Headds, FSS Glossary<br/>     Game Forms: Character Sheet<br/><br/><br/>In most respects the game is a fairly typical attribute/skill RPG.  Character builds are assisted by the selection of a template, which is similar to a class but not nearly as restrictive.  Skills are divided into several functional areas and depend upon attributes and training.  A number of skills are unique to the setting.  While the &quot;Five Star Stories World&quot; section of the site does detail the setting to a considerable degree, the very-long-running manga series upon which the RPG is based clearly will provide much more background for interested gamers (links and resources are provided on the site).<br/><br/>"

Whenever someone thinks that the stack of cards contains at least as many of the required fruit as shown on the dice, they can slap the stack and reveal the cards. If they're correct, they keep one card face up as a point and distribute the other cards among the opponents; if incorrect, they must keep all of the cards.<br/><br/>While this part of the game is straightforward, some cards include minions that require you to reroll either the number or fruit die, thereby changing what you're trying to collect in the salad.

Marketed as &quot;edutainment&quot;, the main focus of the Pico was educational video games for children between 3 and 7 years old. The Pico was released in 1993 in Japan and 1994 in North America and Europe, and later reached China. It was later succeeded by the Advanced Pico Beena, which was released in Japan in 2005. Though the Pico was sold continuously in Japan through the release of the Beena, in North America and Europe the Pico was less successful and was discontinued in early 1998, later being rereleased by Majesco.<br/><br/>Releases for the Pico were focused on education for children and included titles supported by licensed franchised animated characters, including Disney and Sega's own Sonic the Hedgehog series. Overall, Sega claims sales of 3.4 million Pico consoles and 11.2 million game cartridges, and over 350,000 Beena consoles and 800,000 cartridges.<br/><br/>Powered by the same hardware used in the Sega Genesis,[1] the physical shape of the Pico was designed to appear similar to a laptop.<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;Sega Pico&quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"

        "description": "The Advanced Pico Beena, also known simply as Beena or BeenaLite, is an educational console system targeted at young children sold by Sega Toys, released in 2005 in Japan. It is the successor of the Pico, and marketed around the &quot;learn while playing&quot; concept.<br/><br/>Compared to the Pico, the Beena adds several functions. Beena can be played without a television, and supports multiplayer by a separately sold additional Magic Pen. The console also supports data saving. Play time can be limited by settings in the system. Some games for the Beena also offer adaptive difficulty, which becomes more difficult to play based on the skill level of the player. The Beena Lite, a cheaper version of the console, was released on July 17, 2008. At the time of its release, Sega estimated that 350,000 Beena consoles had been sold, and 800,000 game cartridges.<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;Sega Pico&quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"

        "description": "It is the late 26th century. Earth is recovering from a catastrophic explosion that exterminated the majority of the population centuries ago and made most of the surface uninhabitable due to unearthly weather conditions. The surviving humans organized along four radically different ideologies, called Paths, to rebuild the world as they see fit: Harmony, Dominance, Progress, and Salvation. Followers of the four Paths live in a fragile peace, but in almost complete isolation next to each other. Their only meeting point is the last major city on Earth, now just known as the Capital.<br/><br/>By powering up the mysterious Time Rifts that opened in the wake of the cataclysm, each Path is able to reach back to specific moments in their past. Doing so can greatly speed up their progress, but too much meddling may endanger the time-space continuum. But progress is more important than ever before: if the mysterious message arriving through the Time Rift is to be believed, an even more terrible cataclysm is looming on the horizon: an asteroid bearing the mysterious substance called Neutronium is heading towards Earth. Even stranger, the scientists show that the energy signature of the asteroid matches the explosion centuries ago...<br/><br/>Anachrony features a unique two-tiered worker placement system. To travel to the Capital or venture out to the devastated areas for resources, players need not only various Specialists (Engineers, Scientists, Administrators, and Geniuses) but also Exosuits to protect and enhance them &mdash; and both are in short supply.<br/><br/>The game is played in 4-7 turns, depending on the time when the looming cataclysm occurs (unless, of course, it is averted!). The elapsed turns are measured on a dynamic Timeline. By powering up the Time Rifts, players can reach back to earlier turns to supply their past &quot;self&quot; with resources. Each Path has a vastly different objective that rewards it with a massive amount of Victory Points when achieved. The Paths' settlements will survive the impact, but the Capital will not. Whichever Path manages to collect most points will be the new seat for the Capital, thus the most important force left on the planet...<br/><br/>",

They protect him from the repeated assaults of adventurers attracted by his fabulous treasure, buried in the basement of the castle. What if there were more than gold to protect?<br/><br/>In the tile-collection game Dragon Keeper: The Dungeon, you embody these keepers and must capture the adventurers who invade the rooms of the dungeon &mdash; yet you must remain faithful to your guild by avoiding capturing its members. Once you have repelled the assaults, you give to the dragon as a tribute a part of the adventurers you caught&hellip;<br/><br/>In more detail, the game contains tiles in five different colors and different values. These tiles represent the adventurers who want steal the plunder of the dragon. You are responsible for removing these adventurers from the dungeon. Each turn, you take a tile for yourself and give another tile to another player. The choice of tiles depends on the position of the dragon (as the tile must be in its line or in its column). Then the dragon is moved to the location of the tile that has just been removed. Thus, each tile decision limits the choice of the next tile to take.<br/><br/>At the start of the game each player receives a color that they keep secret, with this color corresponding to their original guild. Every tile of this color brings them negative points. Players stack their collected tiles by color, and at the end of the game, the tallest stack is removed. If this stack is the player's guild color, then the player must discard the next tallest stack instead. Players then sum the values of their tiles, and whoever has the most points wins.<br/><br/>",

Five by Five does not contain exhaustive lists of skills and powers. It doesn't need them. Its systems are designed so that players can define everything they need to know about their characters in just a few words.<br/><br/>You will find a clean and easy system for task resolution and combat. Uncertainty is resolved by the roll of commonly found six-sided dice.  Five by Five is not a method of tactical simulation. Realism takes a back seat to quick and easy methods of conflict resolution that will not impede story telling.<br/><br/>Five by Five is meant to be easy, friendly, and fun.<br/><br/>"

Each player is given an identity card, with the two remaining identity cards placed in the middle of the table. Each player looks at their role card and then closes their eyes to represent falling asleep at night.  The Moderator calls out the roles in a specific order for them to take their nighttime actions.<br/><br/>Roles:<br/>GJ Hunter - may hunt in the graveyard cards during the night phase.  Even if the Villager team loses, it can still win if the GJ Hunter manages to hunt a werewolf card.<br/><br/>Zombie - During the night phase may take a card from the graveyard to use as its new body to participate in the game.<br/><br/>Hanged Man - Simply wishes to be hanged and doesn't belong to either the Villager or Werewolf team.<br/><br/>Magical Girl - May use magical skills to view other cards (Similar to Sorcerer mechanics)<br/><br/>Vampire - May exchange his card for another card (Similar to Phantom Thief mechanics)<br/><br/>Big Werewolf - With more power can remember the cards in the graveyard that it raided last night.<br/><br/>After all roles have had their action, players open their eyes representing waking up for the daytime phase. Players now discuss who they believe are the werewolves(or if there are any in play) and vote for a player.  Player with the most votes is killed; killing a werewolf causes humans to win, killing a human causes werewolves to win.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "User summary:<br/><br/>F.R.E.S.C.O. provides an exceptionally minimalist rule system for gaming.  Characters have seven Attributes:  Force (used in combat), Agility, Constitution (also known as &quot;Hit Points&quot;), Intelligence, Sensibility, Reactivity, and Fascination.  The first six are randomly generated with 3d6.  Fascination is calculated by a formula.  The rules suggest non-human characters should have racial modifiers but provides the modifiers only for an Elf, as an example.  Characters then choose &quot;a couple of special talents&quot; which are things they can do.  Examples provided are:  Ambidextrous, &quot;I can make cowboy hats&quot;, &quot;I can drive a star ship&quot;, &quot;I am a bridge player&quot;, and &quot;I can stand alcohol&quot;.  Characters then receive &quot;a fair amount&quot; of money and purchase equipment.  The game does not provide a monetary system or an equipment list, so this will be up to the GM.<br/><br/>The game uses a single resolution mechanic, called a Simulation.  The GM determines when a situation should require a check, and then determines which base Attribute is involved.  The GM also establishes a Difficulty (negative for easier actions, positive for difficult actions) for the action.  The player then calculates their TAF (Throw for Action, but also referred to as a FAR: Fresh Action Roll) which is their Attribute value minus 2d6 minus the Difficulty.  If the result is positive the action succeeds, though rolling double-six always results in failure and a double-one always results in success.<br/><br/>Combat uses the same basic mechanism with the added (minor) complexity of the defender's Force also being subtracted form the roll.  This results in weak (low Force) characters being essentially unable to hit except on special rolls.<br/><br/>Characters gain Experience Points and then spend them to increase Attributes or gain &quot;special talents&quot;.  Note that the mechanism for implementing &quot;special talents&quot; is never addressed.  Characters sheets are provided in the rules.<br/><br/>"

        "description": "From publisher blurb:<br/><br/>This is a largely unarmed martial artist that can shift between various fighting styles. I say &quot;largely&quot; because some styles don't affect your unarmed attack, meaning that you can fully benefit from them even with a weapon (and there's a pair of optional extra moves in the back that lets you treat weapons as an unarmed strike).<br/><br/>How the core of the class works, is you choose several fighting styles at 1st-level. You can only have one active at a time, and each gives you a different type of bonus. For example leopard is all about speed, snake lets you use your Dexterity to attack and has 1 piercing, and tiger just gets a flat damage bonus. As you level up you can expand on the bonuses that each style gives (though again, you can still only benefit from one style at a time).<br/><br/>To make things easier to track, there's a sheet of &quot;style cards&quot; for you to cut out, one for each fighting style, and a space on the character sheet to place the card. The cards list the starting benefit, plus any bonuses for advanced moves. When you have a style active, you place the card on your sheet, and when you change it, you replace the card.<br/><br/>There's also a small ki pool that you can use to deal a bit of extra damage, or gain a bonus when attempting various physical feats.<br/><br/>Of course all of this is in addition to a slew of other moves (there are twenty-eight advanced moves in total): you can hold more ki, gain additional bonuses when you defend, become tougher when you have ki, deal more damage with it, use it to reinforce your mind, and so on. In this way you can better control what kind of monk you wanna make.<br/><br/>If you check out the previews, you can see the entire core class plus some of the advanced moves. More than enough to to try before you buy, for at least a few levels.<br/><br/>This product contains five files.<br/><br/>Two are letter-sized character sheets that use our new character sheet layout. One has a completely blank gear section, while the other fills in the initial choices if you want to just check some boxes and start playing.<br/><br/>The third is a sheet of the aforementioned &quot;style cards&quot;.<br/><br/>The other two are digest-sized books, one in color, the other in black and white (to make it easier to print off at home if you want). They both contain:<br/><br/>    The monk class, complete with (again) 28 advanced moves.<br/>    New weapons, dungeon gear, and magic items, including the *Sword of the Gathering Clouds of Heaven and the Compliant *Golden-Hooped Rod (which fans of Dragonball will recognize).<br/>    The bakemono race, with an advanced move if you want to gain additional benefits while in your animal form.<br/>    The dragon master compendium class, which lets you utilize multiple styles at once.<br/>    A few extra moves that we literally couldn't fit on the sheet.<br/>    A director's cut with questions to ask yourself when rolling up a monk, alternative backgrounds, and explanations and suggestions for some of the moves.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>"

The Battle Game Rules focus primarily on safety and secondarily on a realistic fantasy combat mechanism that distributes wounds to actual hit locations and discusses debility accruing from certain types and locations of wounds.  Characters gained &quot;Levels&quot; (1-6) by duration of experience and selected a &quot;Class&quot;.  Each Class, at each Level, gave certain custom abilities.  Several Classes gave access to certain types of magic, implemented as a spell system.  A section presents Monster Class rules.

In Mexico, the only things that matter are money and family.  While gang warfare amongst the lower class was in its infancy in the U.S., it was a way of life for generations down here.  If you were lucky, you were a good mariachi player.  Nobody likes to let a good mariachi go to waste.<br/><br/>In Mexico 1970, you play the part of a middle-to-lower class Mexican (or Gringo if you're unlucky).  Though your purpose is to make a better life for your self, you find the better part of your time spent just surviving.  Guns blaze and children die.  The old west is alive in the 70's right here in Mexico, except now there are cars and better guns.  Not a good mix if you&rsquo;re the suburban type.<br/><br/>Generally, the big cities are avoided to maintain anonymity.  It&rsquo;s a good thing, too.  The more anonymous you are - the more invisible you are.<br/><br/>"

Assist yourself and score high with an exclusive NHL dictionary as you power play your way through the most action-packed SCRABBLE game ever!<br/><br/>In Scrabble, players draw letter-tiles to form words on the gameboard. Each word earns points based on points of the tiles, and any bonuses. A word can only be played if it uses at least one already-played tile or adds to an already-played word.<br/><br/>In Scrabble NHL Edition, the board looks like a hockey rink with many NHL symbols on it and a grid pattern. The double letter spaces have the NHL logo, the triple letter spaces have the Western logo, the double word spaces have the Eastern logo on it and the triple word spaces have another NHL logo.<br/><br/>There are also Bonus Words that are allowed that are hockey related (NHL, Wild, Pads, Net, Save, etc.) that are worth an additional 5 points.<br/><br/>There are also terminology and team names that are allowed as bonus words for 10 points (Kings, Senators, Hockey, Coyotes, Faceoff).<br/><br/>Finally there is a section of special rules : Pre-Season, Trades, Trade Deadlines, Delay In Game, Too Many Men On The Ice, Pulling the Goalie and Offsides, designed to make the game feel more like hockey.<br/><br/>"

Too bad those illegal super soldier drugs are expensive, so they take to raiding abandoned bases so they can afford to power up. They want to do good but they can't separate the heroes from the villains.<br/><br/>Avalon's Ideal presents a rival team of base raiders who are trying to live up to the standards of the superhero Avalon. By giving themselves superpowers and assembling a team of devoted fans, they think they can fill the gap left by the missing hero. They are mostly untrained and have rather dogmatic views about good and evil. They could become fanatical zealots or great heroes, depending on who they meet and how they are treated.<br/><br/>This supplement stats out the three leaders of the team and gives an adventure seed, showing how they can be used.

Oxygen-rich atmosphere ... moderate gravity ... carbon-based life ... all of these qualities were prized by the mysterious masters of the stars. But not every world is the same... After the fall of the Empire came the rise of the forgotten, the forsaken, and then forbidden. People of all kinds, from the modest to the formidable, from the ordinary to the extreme, from the understandable to the unknowable.<br/><br/>This Aliens book adds 32 new options for playing even stranger creatures in your game of MYRIAD SONG. Some of the choices are simply exotic, like the scheming Serkai or the intellectual Nuderians. Other aliens cannot survive in common environments and must rely on special equipment to interact with others, like the augmented aquatic people of the Teleost, or the ponderous, solar-powered bodies of the Kyrix. And some creatures might not even be from this universe, such as the floating crystaline race of Pherix, or the hovering, mystical Ghen&rsquo;Ti.<br/><br/>Whatever role you choose to play, just remember that you can never judge someone by their appearance, especially not in the Myriad Worlds.<br/><br/>"

        "description": "User summary:<br/><br/>Frontier Horizons is a complete science-fiction roleplaying game with extensively developed rules.  Character creation begins with the selection of race (eight are provided) which will influence subsequent choices.  Characters have Ability Scores (Strength, Endurance, Toughness, Flexibility, Coordination, Speed, etc.) which can be either randomly generated or purchased using a point pool.  The random method or the point pool will be influenced by race.  Typical values range from 2-8 though higher scores are possible.  Most characters are assumed to have cybernetic enhancements, Drawbacks, and Special Abilities.  Demographics and appearance can be selected or randomly generated from tables.  Similar tables are provided to support random background and history generation.<br/><br/>Characters select and Occupation which is somewhat like a traditional Class but less restrictive.  The Occupation will grant certain skills at specified levels.  Dozens of Occupations are provided.  Characters also select Skills from a lengthy list.  Characters gain experience and may improve Skills.  A well-defined Psionic system is included, and a very well developed robotics system also is included.<br/><br/>Actions are resolved through either Skill Checks or Ability Checks.  The checks are made against a modified Task Difficulty, which must be exceeded with 1d10 plus Ability modifier and possibly plus other modifiers.  Combat is fairly complex with numerous situations considered, including:  melee, ranged, grenade, underwater, and weightless.  Lists of weapons and defenses are provided, separate from a quite lengthy section of equipment and vehicles.  Another lengthy section details cybernetics and genetic manipulation.<br/><br/>Note that Appendix E includes all game tables; this appendix also was published as a standalone PDF (&quot;Appendix E - Game Tables&quot;) document.<br/><br/>"

        "description": "Dwarfs in Trouble is an easy and dynamic non- collectible card game. The participants play the role of dwarf treasure seekers who decided to pay a visit at a dragon&rsquo;s den while the dragon was away. They managed to get inside. Unfortunately, while they were plundering the treasure, the dragon return unexpectedly. Certainly, it will not be polite towards anybody caught stealing its possessions. It is a common knowledge that dwarfs tend to be greedy and it would be considered a dishonour to simply throw away the precious stuff. For that reason you need get rid of the treasure in a clever way&hellip;.<br/><br/>The aim of the game is to dispose of the gold completely or to have the fewest Gold coins the moment the Dragon arrives. As we know, dragons have the sixth sense that helps them localise gold and valuables. The dragon will focus on the most greedy treasure hunters. The arrival of the beast will cause such a confusion that only one dwarf will be able to escape and others will be burnt to ashes.<br/><br/>The cards<br/><br/>There are three kinds of cards in the deck:<br/>dwarf cards- the ones you play in your round (a coin symbol),<br/>counteraction &ndash; the ones you play to respond to other players cards&rsquo; effects (a shield icon), dragon&rsquo;s card.<br/><br/>Each card has its own name (usually a dwarf quotation) and a graphic symbol of its effects.<br/><br/>The game setup<br/><br/>Shuffle the cards carefully. Put the Dragon card at the bottom of the Deck.<br/><br/>Each player collects 20 gold coins and draws 4 cards from the top of the Deck.<br/><br/>Place the remaining gold next to the Deck. From now on it is called the Dragon&rsquo;s Treasure.<br/><br/>The game overview<br/><br/>The person who is most generous starts the game. Continue playing your turns clockwise. At the beginning of his or her turn each player draws a number of cards so they have a total of 4 cards in their hands.<br/><br/>In their turns the players can:<br/><br/>    play any number of cards and resolve its effects,<br/>    discard any number of cards.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Important: the amount of gold and number of cards is known to all the players during the whole game.<br/><br/>",

Although the first game did fairly well, a lot of suggestions were brought and I felt like we could do better. This then, is the result of hundreds of user comments and reviews. I think it&rsquo;s a big step up, and I hope you all enjoy it!<br/>StormWinds places the player in a steampunk setting, facing a massive invasion of airships and other flying contraptions. A blend between a tower defense game and a shooter, you must choose your defenses then use them personally to gain victory.<br/>This game is by far Hero Interactive&rsquo;s largest to date- over 10 people had a hand in the game at some stage in development. Players who make the purchase now get access to 2 new campaigns, new weapons, new enemies, a new boss, new challenge missions (as they come out), and cheat codes. In addition, when the beta of Bubble Tanks 2 is released, extra content purchasers will be invited to join in!<br/>A big thank you to everyone who supported the game, gave great feedback, and helped to bring this better version online!<br/><br/>Source: The Game Website.<br/><br/>"
