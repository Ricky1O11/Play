The rules are simple and easy to use.  All characters have narrative tags that are descriptive and drive character motivation and goals.  Atypically, these narrative tags also have a value associated with them to indicate how &quot;strong&quot; the narrative tag is.  Characters also have Abilities which collapse all traits into a single category (e.g., there are not Attributes and Skills in this system--there is only the single category of Abilities).  Abilities have scores ranging from -5 to +5.<br/><br/>The core action resolution system involves establishing a target difficulty and subtracting that from the character's ability level.  Then 2d6 are rolled, but one is treated as positive and one is treated as negative (that is, one helps and one hinders).  These dice are summed to the previous value with negative results indicating failure and positive results or zero indicating success.  The system supports varying degrees of success or failure.  Opposed actions are similar except the opponent's ability and roll are contrasted to the actor's ability and roll instead of a target difficulty.  The rules support a group action resolution method, as well, which is quite interesting.<br/><br/>"}, "185003": {"rpgartist": ["(Uncredited)"], "rpgitemversion": ["PDF Version"], "poll": [], "name": "Minions: A Collaborative Roleplaying Game", "rpgdesigner": ["Ian Millington"], "rpgproducer": ["Ian Millington"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2691498.jpg", "usersrated": "0", "average": "0", "statistics": [], "rpg": ["Fudge", "Minions: A Collaborative Roleplaying Game"], "rpgpublisher": ["(Web published)"], "rpgcategory": ["Core Rules (min needed to play)"], "rpggenre": ["Generic / Universal"], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2691498_t.jpg", "description": "User summary:<br/><br/>Minions is quite unique - it can be played standalone, in which case it forms a sort of narrative storytelling system, or it can be &quot;bolted on&quot; to any other generic rules mechanics and played as a sort of setting-cum-scenario.

Thus, a medieval fantasy city, a modern metropolis, or a futuristic space station would all work fine.  There just have to be a lot of people concentrated in one place.  The game involves generating thirty-two characters very quickly, so obviously FUDGE or similar systems with very streamlined mechanics are highly preferable to other rules-heavy systems.  These characters are more like &quot;non-player characters&quot; in traditional RPGs than typical &quot;characters&quot;--they may (and do) change players during the game.<br/><br/>The game is played by attempting to weave together the narratives of multiple characters so they become inextricably involved in a single &quot;faction&quot; which forms a support base for the urban area operations.

And thus, the age of Nil became the age of Chaos, the world turning into a primordial ooze of senseless Happenings, an endless howling of insanity. And thus was the universe created.<br/><br/>The Titans, finding the world full of madness, created Justifications. Only Effects could create Causes, but Causes could create Effects. Slowly, the howling void of the age of Chaos became the age of Order, each Titan carving out a Plane to call their Own.

So did the Sage Kings between them craft the System, which unified the competing Causes into one System of checks and balances, reason and design, merit and necessity, an age of Laws. And thus was the world created.<br/><br/>In crafting the world, just like the forces before them, the Sage Kings sowed their own destruction. In creating the System, they created peoples to enact its laws: human and elf, goblin and troll, orc and fairy, each of the countless races made in the image of their Sage. People who question if the System is not a unification of the causes. merely another Cause whose Effect is simple self-perpetuation, who chafe under an unjust Heaven - but the System, being created by the combined effort of the Sage-Kings, is greater than the Sage-Kings, greater than the Titans, perhaps even greater than the Old Ones themselves. It is the cusp of a new age led by the Folk, where the races created by the Sages take up the mantle of Heaven and direct the System with their own hands.<br/><br/>But even if it is the time for the children of the Sage Kings to take the mantle of Heaven, none know what Age is going to come to pass...<br/><br/>"}, "185027": {"rpgartist": ["(Uncredited)"], "rpgitemversion": ["PDF Version"], "poll": [], "name": "The Evil", "rpgdesigner": ["Christoffer Lern\u00f6"], "rpgproducer": ["Christoffer Lern\u00f6"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2694197.jpg", "usersrated": "0", "average": "0", "statistics": [], "rpg": ["The Evil"], "rpgpublisher": ["(Web published)"], "rpgcategory": ["Core Rules (min needed to play)"], "rpggenre": ["Horror"], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2694197_t.jpg", "description": "User summary:<br/><br/>The Evil - A Short Horror RPG attempts to create a cinematic roleplaying experience where characters represent the archetypes found in horror movies, doing the stupid (and often fatal) things that horror movie characters do.<br/><br/>Character creation is relatively simple.

The game is played with d10s but has an alternate mechanism using a pack of playing cards.  When percentile dice are rolled they can &quot;explode&quot; into &quot;Infinite Dice&quot; on particularly good rolls.  The GM is called the Arbiter; the other players run Characters.  Characters have a selected Class and then use a point pool to purchase Skills (Skill costs vary by Class/Skill combination).  Characters also have nine Primary Stats (Might, Endurance, Agility, Dexterity, Intelligence, Resolve, Spirit, Personality, and Luck) and several other possible Stats such as Tech Level.  Characters have additional statistics that vary during game play such as Life, Power, Quickness, and Fatigue.  A variety of other performance abilities are mathematically derived from, generally, Primary Stats (for example, Social, Occult, Control, and Sensitivity).<br/><br/>Skill attempts are resolved by rolling under a Difficulty Factor established by the GM.  Other types of rolls made in the game include Primary Stat rolls, Luck rolls, and so forth.  Skill levels increase through use and training; increases are more likely for characters with high intelligence.  Because most game actions are based on Skills, characters with low intelligence rapidly will stall out in ability relative to characters with high intelligence.<br/><br/>The system uses a quite complex combat methodology with Combat Turns broken into Combat Pulses.  Characters use a variety of inputs to determine their Action Pulse value which is referenced on a chart to determine which Combat Pulse(s) they may act upon.  This is modified by a variety of situational values called Quickness Modifiers.  Combat supports a variety of special actions such as parry or natural (non-weapon) attacks.  Weapons supported range from clubs to heavy artillery to pulse cannon.  Armors appear in several types--some decrease hit chance, others absorb damage, and still others do both.  A Fatigue system is used which influences Skill performance and Combat performance.  Damage sustained also influences various performance metrics.<br/><br/>"}, "185035": {"rpgartist": ["Rick Hershey"], "rpg": ["Pathfinder System Compatible Product"], "poll": [], "name": "Equipment Tricks for Lanterns", "rpgdesigner": ["Matthew Roth"], "rpgproducer": ["Troy Daniels", "Rick Hershey"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2687131.jpg", "usersrated": "0", "rpgitemversion": ["PDF version"], "average": "0", "statistics": [], "rpggenre": ["Fantasy (High Fantasy)"], "rpgpublisher": ["Fat Goblin Games"], "rpgcategory": ["Sourcebook (rules/options to enhance play)"], "rpgseries": ["Sidebar"], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2687131_t.jpg", "description": "From publisher blurb:<br/><br/>With a wealth of feat options at a player&rsquo;s disposal, it can be difficult to find something new to define your character.

Characters also have an assigned Role which is somewhat analogous to the more-traditional Class but functions primarily as a narrative tag denoting presumed ability.  Examples include:  &quot;Agent&quot;, &quot;Human Lightning Rod&quot;, and &quot;Mage&quot;.  Roles are assigned a Role Magnitude to denote how adept the character is within the Role; ranks range from 1-3.  Characters may select 2-4 Roles.<br/><br/>One atypical aspect of the game focuses on Resources.  In this system every Attribute or Role use (except the very trivial) is assumed to dissipate some amount of applicable Resource.  Usually, Characters may expend additional Resource to gain a performance advantage.<br/><br/>Actions are referred to as Tasks, and Task Resolution follows a similar pattern of base score plus 1d6 compared to a target difficulty.  Any Task may use a suitable Tool (if such is at hand) to give a performance bonus.  Characters gain Experience Points and spend them to increase Attribute Ranks.<br/><br/>"}, "185065": {"rpgartist": ["(Uncredited)"], "rpg": ["MRE: Microcosm Roleplaying Engine"], "statistics": [], "name": "M.R.E.

To this end, the rules here are exceptionally simple and fast.<br/><br/>One player will be the GameRunner, a sort of narrative expert and tie-breaker (light-weight GM); the remaining players will create characters.  Characters have a name and &quot;some quick info&quot; which are narrative tags describing appearance and ability.  For the Character's Main Job, a rank of 2d4+2 is assigned.  For their Secondary Job, a rank of 1d4+2 is assigned.  For anything else, a rank of 1d4 is assigned.  All scores summed provide Hit Points.  Characters then buy equipment.<br/><br/>For any attempted action that is non-trivial, players roll 1d12 and must roll under their relevant Ability.  If the character has no relevant ability they use their lowest score divided by two, rounded up (usually, they will have to roll a 1 to succeed).  After every session, players have three chances to improve a Character Ability--1d12 is rolled and if it rolls over the ability then the ability increases by one.<br/><br/>In Combat, initiative is determined by coin flip.  Characters again roll under a target, this time their opponents relevant defensing ability (if any).  For anything not covered in the rules or for any arguments that may arise, the GameRunner makes a decision which is final.<br/><br/>The rules also include two brief scenarios:  Mobhits, a gangster scenario in New York City during the 1920s; and, Gapnack, a comical fantasy scenario with odd flying things.<br/><br/>"}, "185119": {"boardgamedesigner": ["Andrew Cox"], "average": "6.18333", "poll": [], "name": "The Wastelanders: 2048", "playingtime": "120", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": ["Area Control / Area Influence", "Card Drafting", "Chit-Pull System", "Dice Rolling", "Player Elimination", "Press Your Luck", "Tile Placement"], "yearpublished": "2015", "usersrated": "18", "maxplayers": "4", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2808384_t.png", "boardgameartist": ["Tatyana Adzhaliyska", "Michael Rush", "Alisha Volkman"], "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["The Game Crafter, LLC"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2808384.png", "boardgameversion": ["First edition"], "maxplaytime": "120", "boardgamecategory": ["City Building", "Environmental", "Wargame"], "age": "13", "minplaytime": "20", "description": "The Wastelanders: 2048 is a lite 4x- (EXplore, EXpand, EXploit and EXterminate) that simulates a Socio-Economic Post-Apocalyptic city using a card draw and hand management system to populate a modular board by laying card tiles called Placements.<br/><br/>The Wastelanders: 2048 is a game exclusively printed by The Game Crafter and was finished May of 2016.

Because the starting position is randomized, it seldom offers equal opportunities for both players and you may well need luck to win.

The game is won by the player who has the biggest triangle on the board when the game ends. Moves are made by changing places of the player's own piece and a neutral white piece in such a manner that a new triangle is formed. If such a triangle contains player's own or opponent's pieces, they are captured. The game ends when no new triangles can be formed. The winner scores points from enemy pieces that have been captured. The match is won by the player who is the first to reach or exceed 50 points.

Primarily, it was free, with rules that attempted to be intuitively simple.  A secondary goal to enable &quot;paperless&quot; play (via software) was not particularly successful.  The game is interesting inasmuch as it was intended only as a partial replacement for TSR's Advanced Dungeons &amp; Dragons.  Major portions of FFRPS used the AD&amp;D ruleset without modification.  Other portions of FFRPS were completely new material.  It can thus be viewed as either a large-scale &quot;variant&quot; rule set for AD&amp;D or as an independent game that borrows heavily from AD&amp;D.  Either interpretation is correct, depending upon focus.  An add-on component of science and technology was contemplated but not produced.<br/><br/>The major ways in which FFRPS was innovative surrounded character and NPC creation and the implementation of magic within a campaign.  It is safe to say that in nearly all other respects it was a near-clone of AD&amp;D.  Characters in FFRPS were required to be human.  They had two types of Characteristics--Primaries and Secondaries.  Six Primaries were defined:  Strength, Intelligence, Faith, Dexterity, Constitution, and Charisma--usually ranging from -2 to +2.  Primary ranks were purchased from a point pool.  Three Secondaries were defined:  Mana, To Hit Armor Class 0 (&quot;THAC0&quot;), and Hit Points.  Secondary ranks were derived values.  Characters' proficiency was noted in several &quot;levels&quot;:  Adventuring Level, Combat Level, Magic Level, and Piety Level.  Secondary Skills were deleted in favor of a narrative character background.<br/><br/>Magic was reworked to use a mana point system, with spells placed in schools.  Some spell parameters (range, duration, area-of-effect) could be varied at casting time.  Spell Levels were somewhat dynamic based upon desired outcomes.  However, every spell cast had a potential of failure, determine using a complex formula.  Spell targets were allowed saving throws using a complex formula.<br/><br/>"}, "185179": {"poll": [], "name": "Q.U.B.E: Director's Cut", "videogamemode": ["Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["Linux/Windows/Macintosh Downloadable edition", "PlayStation Network Downloadable edition", "XBLA Xbox One Downloadable edition"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2745208.png", "videogametheme": ["Abstract", "Physics"], "usersrated": "2", "videogamedeveloper": ["Toxic Games"], "videogamegenre": ["Platform", "Puzzle"], "videogameplatform": ["Linux", "Macintosh", "PlayStation 3", "PlayStation 4", "Windows", "Xbox One"], "average": "6.75", "statistics": [], "videogamepublisher": ["Toxic Games"], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2745208_t.png", "description": "Q.U.B.E: Director&rsquo;s Cut is the definitive version of the brain-twisting first-person puzzler.

There is always a plenty of those who are eager to take this place, so when such a chance comes up, they&rsquo;re ready to take it by all means.<br/><br/>The city of Urbis is ruled by the City Council elected by the residents. The main objective of the game is to become the Head of the Council. Like all the other players, you are a Council member who is responsible for the well-being and prosperity of the city.  Each Council member (player) has an access to the city treasury and guard, and is obliged to follow the Council&rsquo;s decreets. Each councillor is in charge of one of the city blocks (represented by a board given to each player in the beginning of the game) and aspires to develop his block either quickly or proficiently. Gold and silver from the treasury are distributed depending on the buildings that have been put up on the block. However the block residents are always on the lookout: no one wants to live close to the cemetery, gibbet or prison. Take thought for the residents, spend some money, and these grim buildings will appear on the neighbour&rsquo;s block instead of your own. Hospital is also an essential city institution but it demands substantial charges to maintain. Taking this into account a player might awaken his inner dictator and build up his block with slums and honky-tonks, regardless of the residents&rsquo; needs, because the first player to fill all the building slots on his block becomes a winner.  Which way is the best? To consider the block residents or to just execute the will of the Council? To turn your block into a dark place or a blooming garden?

Each player starts of with a private fortune, a company and a company fortune.<br/><br/>The turn order is decided by the company you start with and every time you pass start you will be able to buy more companies - and thereby get more turns each round. Passing start also adds more money to your fortune and allows you to pay out dividend from your company if you have qualified.<br/><br/>Movement is decided by rolling either one or two dice - the player decides - but if you roll 2 and get two of the same you will receive a bonus. Where you land you will have to pay rent but that will also allow you to place your company logo on the square.

This shield wasn't blocking all of the damage, though: he felt himself get shaken with every hit. Worse yet, his strength was slowly leaking away: keeping the heavy shield up took much of his energy. He needed an opening soon...<br/><br/><br/><br/>        Then, the demon clutched its club above its head with both hands, ready to land a devastating blow. That was the chance Mamoru had been waiting for! With the demon gearing up for the attack, its right side was open. He rolled to the right and struck the Oni's exposed flank as its club smashed into the crumbling pavement where Mamoru had stood only moments before.<br/><br/><br/><br/>        It was not enough. Unexpectedly, the demon followed up with a wide sweep of its club, catching Mamoru's unshielded left side. Mamoru felt his strength leave his body, the dark power of the Miasma flowing over and out of him.<br/><br/><br/><br/>        Minutes later, he opened his eyes again. He was back at the base camp, his captain prodding him with the back-end of his lance. &quot;You died there, boy. All of us did. Got too greedy. Get up, we're going to try again to slay that Oni. Let's hope our power is still there when we get back to its lair.&quot;<br/><br/><br/>Miasma is a game where you play a samurai, infected by a dark miasma that has held the Imperial Capital in its grip for centuries.

Some men, even those ignorant of our Art may perform it by mistake. To Walk through the Fog and into the Grey is something I believe all Men were born with the ability to accomplish.

The Action Cards add real-life issues to the game that space missions often encounter - project cancellations, audits, government shutdowns, and other exciting twists and turns.<br/><br/>To complete a mission you must populate your game board with the right combination of cards for mission success. Each player needs to collect the Playing Cards that give them the right spacecraft, first and second stage rockets, and matching fairings. Gravity assist and solid rocket booster cards are available to provide additional Delta-V if needed to complete the assigned mission.

Earth is recovering from a catastrophic explosion that exterminated the majority of the population centuries ago and made most of the surface uninhabitable due to unearthly weather conditions. The surviving humans organized along four radically different ideologies, called Paths, to rebuild the world as they see fit: Harmony, Dominance, Progress, and Salvation. Followers of the four Paths live in a fragile peace, but in almost complete isolation next to each other. Their only meeting point is the last major city on Earth, now just known as the Capital.<br/><br/>By powering up the mysterious Time Rifts that opened in the wake of the cataclysm, each Path is able to reach back to specific moments in their past. Doing so can greatly speed up their progress, but too much meddling may endanger the time-space continuum. But progress is more important than ever before: if the mysterious message arriving through the Time Rift is to be believed, an even more terrible cataclysm is looming on the horizon: an asteroid bearing the mysterious substance called Neutronium is heading towards Earth. Even stranger, the scientists show that the energy signature of the asteroid matches the explosion centuries ago...<br/><br/>Anachrony features a unique two-tiered worker placement system. To travel to the Capital or venture out to the devastated areas for resources, players need not only various Specialists (Engineers, Scientists, Administrators, and Geniuses) but also Exosuits to protect and enhance them &mdash; and both are in short supply.<br/><br/>The game is played in 4-7 turns, depending on the time when the looming cataclysm occurs (unless, of course, it is averted!). The elapsed turns are measured on a dynamic Timeline. By powering up the Time Rifts, players can reach back to earlier turns to supply their past &quot;self&quot; with resources. Each Path has a vastly different objective that rewards it with a massive amount of Victory Points when achieved. The Paths' settlements will survive the impact, but the Capital will not.

Each turn, you take a tile for yourself and give another tile to another player. The choice of tiles depends on the position of the dragon (as the tile must be in its line or in its column). Then the dragon is moved to the location of the tile that has just been removed. Thus, each tile decision limits the choice of the next tile to take.<br/><br/>At the start of the game each player receives a color that they keep secret, with this color corresponding to their original guild.

Characters have seven Attributes:  Force (used in combat), Agility, Constitution (also known as &quot;Hit Points&quot;), Intelligence, Sensibility, Reactivity, and Fascination.  The first six are randomly generated with 3d6.  Fascination is calculated by a formula.  The rules suggest non-human characters should have racial modifiers but provides the modifiers only for an Elf, as an example.  Characters then choose &quot;a couple of special talents&quot; which are things they can do.  Examples provided are:  Ambidextrous, &quot;I can make cowboy hats&quot;, &quot;I can drive a star ship&quot;, &quot;I am a bridge player&quot;, and &quot;I can stand alcohol&quot;.

The game does not provide a monetary system or an equipment list, so this will be up to the GM.<br/><br/>The game uses a single resolution mechanic, called a Simulation.  The GM determines when a situation should require a check, and then determines which base Attribute is involved.  The GM also establishes a Difficulty (negative for easier actions, positive for difficult actions) for the action.  The player then calculates their TAF (Throw for Action, but also referred to as a FAR: Fresh Action Roll) which is their Attribute value minus 2d6 minus the Difficulty.  If the result is positive the action succeeds, though rolling double-six always results in failure and a double-one always results in success.<br/><br/>Combat uses the same basic mechanism with the added (minor) complexity of the defender's Force also being subtracted form the roll.

I say &quot;largely&quot; because some styles don't affect your unarmed attack, meaning that you can fully benefit from them even with a weapon (and there's a pair of optional extra moves in the back that lets you treat weapons as an unarmed strike).<br/><br/>How the core of the class works, is you choose several fighting styles at 1st-level. You can only have one active at a time, and each gives you a different type of bonus. For example leopard is all about speed, snake lets you use your Dexterity to attack and has 1 piercing, and tiger just gets a flat damage bonus. As you level up you can expand on the bonuses that each style gives (though again, you can still only benefit from one style at a time).<br/><br/>To make things easier to track, there's a sheet of &quot;style cards&quot; for you to cut out, one for each fighting style, and a space on the character sheet to place the card. The cards list the starting benefit, plus any bonuses for advanced moves. When you have a style active, you place the card on your sheet, and when you change it, you replace the card.<br/><br/>There's also a small ki pool that you can use to deal a bit of extra damage, or gain a bonus when attempting various physical feats.<br/><br/>Of course all of this is in addition to a slew of other moves (there are twenty-eight advanced moves in total): you can hold more ki, gain additional bonuses when you defend, become tougher when you have ki, deal more damage with it, use it to reinforce your mind, and so on. In this way you can better control what kind of monk you wanna make.<br/><br/>If you check out the previews, you can see the entire core class plus some of the advanced moves. More than enough to to try before you buy, for at least a few levels.<br/><br/>This product contains five files.<br/><br/>Two are letter-sized character sheets that use our new character sheet layout.

Character creation begins with the selection of race (eight are provided) which will influence subsequent choices.  Characters have Ability Scores (Strength, Endurance, Toughness, Flexibility, Coordination, Speed, etc.) which can be either randomly generated or purchased using a point pool.  The random method or the point pool will be influenced by race.  Typical values range from 2-8 though higher scores are possible.  Most characters are assumed to have cybernetic enhancements, Drawbacks, and Special Abilities.  Demographics and appearance can be selected or randomly generated from tables.  Similar tables are provided to support random background and history generation.<br/><br/>Characters select and Occupation which is somewhat like a traditional Class but less restrictive.  The Occupation will grant certain skills at specified levels.  Dozens of Occupations are provided.  Characters also select Skills from a lengthy list.  Characters gain experience and may improve Skills.  A well-defined Psionic system is included, and a very well developed robotics system also is included.<br/><br/>Actions are resolved through either Skill Checks or Ability Checks.  The checks are made against a modified Task Difficulty, which must be exceeded with 1d10 plus Ability modifier and possibly plus other modifiers.  Combat is fairly complex with numerous situations considered, including:  melee, ranged, grenade, underwater, and weightless.  Lists of weapons and defenses are provided, separate from a quite lengthy section of equipment and vehicles.

The participants play the role of dwarf treasure seekers who decided to pay a visit at a dragon&rsquo;s den while the dragon was away. They managed to get inside. Unfortunately, while they were plundering the treasure, the dragon return unexpectedly. Certainly, it will not be polite towards anybody caught stealing its possessions. It is a common knowledge that dwarfs tend to be greedy and it would be considered a dishonour to simply throw away the precious stuff. For that reason you need get rid of the treasure in a clever way&hellip;.<br/><br/>The aim of the game is to dispose of the gold completely or to have the fewest Gold coins the moment the Dragon arrives. As we know, dragons have the sixth sense that helps them localise gold and valuables. The dragon will focus on the most greedy treasure hunters. The arrival of the beast will cause such a confusion that only one dwarf will be able to escape and others will be burnt to ashes.<br/><br/>The cards<br/><br/>There are three kinds of cards in the deck:<br/>dwarf cards- the ones you play in your round (a coin symbol),<br/>counteraction &ndash; the ones you play to respond to other players cards&rsquo; effects (a shield icon), dragon&rsquo;s card.<br/><br/>Each card has its own name (usually a dwarf quotation) and a graphic symbol of its effects.<br/><br/>The game setup<br/><br/>Shuffle the cards carefully.
