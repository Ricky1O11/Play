The Mega Drive/Genesis version was also produced by Sunsoft. Critics were impressed by its graphics, sound, and playability. Similar to the NES version, it had limited commercial success because it took so long for the final product to be released, due to Nintendo's former policy of producing titles for a Nintendo system exclusively. By the time this policy was abandoned, the game was released in 1990.<br/><br/>Similarities and differences<br/><br/>Unlike the NES, this version stays closer to the plot of the film, and features the Batmobile and Batwing in the form of horizontal shooting levels. While the NES version allows three unique weapons and unlimited continues, the Genesis version only has the Batarang as a special weapon with limited continues. The grappling hook is an additional item. The game also deviates from the film plot because in the film, Batman attempts to save Napier from falling into the chemicals, but fails. However in the game, Batman actually knocks Napier into the vat. This game has several cutscenes, with the player advancing to the next destination after defeating a boss character.<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;Batman (Sega Mega Drive)&quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "98307": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic986085.jpg", "poll": {}, "boardgamedesigner": {"3": {"name": "(Uncredited)"}}, "statistics": {}, "yearpublished": "0", "maxplayers": "4", "boardgameartist": {"33418": "Eric Carle"}, "boardgamepublisher": {"254": {"name": "University Games"}}, "maxplaytime": "20", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic986085_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "20", "boardgamecategory": {"1089": {"name": "Animals"}}, "description": "Players work together to create a spider web in this cooperative children's game based on the book by Eric Carle.<br/><br/>Players spin to move their way around the board, landing on colored and fly spaces.

Unplayable if you are not familiar with the German language in general and Viennese dialect in particular.<br/><br/>Aim of the game: Bribing the attendant of the &quot;G&auml;nseh&auml;ufel&quot; (a forested sand island in the Danube with a large open-air bath) into giving you the last of the almost-sold-out lockers. The player who is first to successfully bribe the attendant wins the game.<br/><br/>How it is played: To bribe the attendant, one needs to collect three &quot;Wirtshauskarten&quot; (inn/restaurant cards). These are gained by moving one's player token to the &quot;Wirtshausfelder&quot; (inn/restaurant spaces) on the board. When a player lands on a &quot;Wirtshausfeld&quot;, he has to interpret a &quot;Wuchtel-Karte&quot;. Each of these cards contains a lighthearted comments in Viennese dialect and four sentences in standard German. The active player first tries to interpret the comment. If he is successful, he gets to draw a &quot;Wirtshauskarte&quot;. If not, he may pay 200 &quot;Kaiserm&uuml;hlentaler&quot; (game money) to have one of the four possible translations read to him and to guess if the translation is correct. If he is successful, he gets to draw a card. The &quot;Wirtshauskarten&quot; have alcoholic strengths printed on them. If the card has the same colour as the player's secret task card, he/she can try to bring it to the attendant to bribe him. But at the bath's entrance, there is a policeman conducting alcohol checks. Depending on the alcoholic strength of the active player's cards, he either has to pay a fine, or the other player/s who initiated the alcohol check have to pay the cost for the check.<br/>Other special fields on the board let players win or lose money (through gambling, staying at the office, selling or auctioning off &quot;Wirtshauskarten&quot; etc.)<br/><br/>"}, "98314": {"rpgitemversion": {"129196": "First printing"}, "poll": {}, "name": "GURPS Horror (Fourth Edition)", "rpghonor": {"20210": "2012 ENnie for Best Supplement - Silver Winner"}, "rpgproducer": {"13024": "Justin De Witt"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic986174.jpg", "usersrated": "14", "average": "8.10714", "rpggenre": {"158": "Horror"}, "rpgissuearticle": {"155466": "From the Editor"}, "rpg": {"332": "GURPS (4th Edition)"}, "statistics": {}, "rpgcategory": {"2108": "Sourcebook (rules/options to enhance play)"}, "rpgseries": {"1586": "GURPS Horror"}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic986174_t.jpg", "description": "From the publisher:<br/><br/>It's back . . . and the fear has grown!<br/><br/>GURPS Horror, Fourth Edition, is the latest incarnation of one of the most popular GURPS supplements ever . . . and now it's been given a new lease on unnatural life by horror master Kenneth Hite.

Quickly, position your paddle under the ball again and bounce it back up into the layers of bricks.<br/><br/>After the ball hits a brick, it rebounds back to the paddle with varying speeds and angles. And, like a &quot;real&quot; paddle, hitting the ball on the corner results in steeper angles and faster action.<br/><br/>As the ball hits the paddle, it moves faster and faster. When you knock out the last brick, you get a big bonus, a victory tune and a new set of bricks!<br/><br/>With this exciting action game, you can choose a variety of skill levels, game lengths and scoring options. You can even choose different skill levels for each player.<br/><br/>Players take turns moving the paddle and knocking out as many bricks as possible.

Then, aim at a completely new row of balloons to keep increasing your score.<br/><br/>The object of the game is to break balloons by catching a clown on a teeter-totter and aiming him at three rows of balloons. The clown moves slowly at first, but picks up speed until he reaches his maximum.<br/><br/>A clown may move right through the lines of balloons, missing all of them, or he might pop several on his way up and even more on his way down. Several things determine his success. When he first bounces off the teeter-totter, his angle depends on how close to the middle of the board he landed. As he rises, then again as he falls, hitting a balloon changes both his path and his speed.

But these outer systems are not yet strong enough to engage the forces of the Core Worlds directly. The young kingdoms must first gnaw at the edges of the crumbling frontier, developing new types of units and shrewder tactics. They must build up their energy resources to launch magnificent fleets and overwhelming ground forces. Then, when the time is right, they must strike at the galactic core itself, claiming the most exalted planets for themselves.

These cards include new Units and Tactics that the players can draft into their Empires, as well as Worlds that they can invade.<br/><br/>&bull; Empire: Each player represents an Empire that begins with a Home World and a Starting Deck. A player's Empire consists of all of the cards in his hand, draw deck, discard pile, and Warzone (tableau).<br/><br/>&bull; Fleet Strength: Each World possesses a Fleet Strength that represents the starships that defend it from attack. A World's Fleet Strength must be matched in order for that World to be successfully invaded. Many Units possess a Fleet Strength that a player can use to invade a World.<br/><br/>&bull; Ground Strength: Each World possesses a Ground Strength that represents the infantry and other ground forces that defend it from surface assault. A World's Ground Strength must be matched in order for it to be successfully invaded.

This game has streamlined and flexible mechanics.<br/>...<br/>Perilous Journeys provides a list of skills that are used to build characters.  The skills are broad in nature as well as methods to  limit the breadth of skills if the GM desires.  The game provides archetypal types of characters as templates.  These archetypes closely  match the abilities of classes that are found in class-based games.  At the same time, players can choose any set of abilities they want to  build unique characters if they so choose.  Like other skill-based games, character creation is done with points, although there is a random  die option.  There is an &quot;edges and flaws system.&quot;  There are rules for creating contacts.

The game puts one to four players in the role of a unique character in charge of a small territory in the old west. Some examples of the characters in the game are Banker, Cowboy, and Tracker. The characters have various abilities that give them advantages in the game as well as a starting bonus of some sort. Each player collects and uses various resources to build towns, cities, and rails to grow their territories. Players start the game with one city and two towns with the goal of growing out their territories to include additional towns, cities, and railroad connections throughout the areas that they control. The objective of the game is to collect the most victory points when the game ends. Players do this by expanding their territory, collecting gold, and obtaining Influence Points from certain actions on the game board. Players will need to watch each other&rsquo;s progress as the game can end in several different ways.<br/><br/>Summary of Play<br/>Each turn players roll two colored dice and place those dice on a specific action on the game board. The game has built in actions and tokens that allow players to manipulate their dice in certain ways. So players will have to decide whether to use these actions or limited tokens such as the Wild Die tokens to modify their dice. This allows players to use a majority of the dice rolls that come up each turn to further improve their position in the game.<br/><br/>The game promotes fast play as each player takes turns placing one or more dice on only one action per turn. Actions can include but are not limited to drawing cards, collecting resources, building additional towns and cities, and taking special actions such as the Sheriff, Mayor, Trader, or Tycoon. Some actions, such as Rail Baron, require a certain natural die roll while other actions require that your dice add up to a certain value. Players gain influence points during the game by taking specific actions which counts for a players overall victory points needed at the end of the game. Players will also need to focus on building their railroad connections as efficiently as they can to maximize their score at the end of the game.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "1", "boardgameversion": {"122243": "Knight Works English Edition"}, "average": "6.77715", "name": "Dark Horse", "playingtime": "90", "boardgamemechanic": {"2072": "Dice Rolling"}, "age": "10", "boardgameexpansion": {}, "usersrated": "252", "boardgamesubdomain": {"5497": "Strategy Games"}, "boardgamefamily": {"8374": "Crowdfunding: Kickstarter"}}, "98445": {"poll": {}, "name": "Line Up", "playingtime": "0", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": {"2002": "Tile Placement"}, "yearpublished": "0", "usersrated": "4", "maxplayers": "6", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1017570_t.png", "average": "6", "statistics": {}, "boardgamepublisher": {"2030": {"name": "Jigsaw Toy Factory"}}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1017570.png", "boardgameversion": {"97986": "English edition"}, "maxplaytime": "0", "boardgamecategory": {"1009": {"name": "Abstract Strategy"}}, "age": "5", "minplaytime": "0", "description": "An abstract game for 2-6 players.

Originally named the Swords &amp; Arrows Role-Playing Game (SaARPG), the system was conceived of as a fantasy role-playing system built to handle the then-in-initial-development Trystell setting. The initial system took much inspiration from roleplaying products that came before it, including the Dragonlance: Fifth Age game, Middle-earth Role Playing (1st & 2nd Editions), the Starshield Role-Playing Game and the Tales of the Lance boxed set.<br/><br/>The Swords &amp; Arrows Role-Playing Game also drew on its thematic predecessor, a line of comics drawn by the authors, and also given the title Swords &amp; Arrows. This comic series was set in a then-unnamed fantasy world, which would grow into Trystell around the same time that the Swords &amp; Arrows Role-Playing Game was developed to support the world.<br/><br/>Almost as soon as development began the system and setting took front burner, pushing back the previously-in-development [The Zeotis] setting. (Although the Swords &amp; Arrows Role-Playing Game was originally conceived as being an engine capable of later supporting The Zeotis superhero setting, too.) Decisions about what to support in the game, and the Trystell setting, were made around the lunch table as the four original developers of the project &mdash; Thorin Tabor, Matthew Pennell, Tim McAtee and John David Parsons &mdash; discussed the matter. Sometimes unorthodox tools were used as well to make decisions on the setting, such as the oft-remembered Civilization II map used to divvy up deity influences on the Trystell world.<br/><br/>Development continued for the next year, during which due to circumstances beyond their control, Matthew Pennell and John David Parsons had to leave, and Jesse Pingenot was brought into the central development circle. Both Matthew Pennell and John David Parsons would later return in developing the game.<br/><br/>It would be remiss of us, of course, not to mention the other people who had a hand in the development of the world, playing the game and offering suggestions. Over the course of three years, many lunchtime sessions were ran and many campaigns enjoyed, as Brandon Smith, Ben Goreham and Darin Strouts contributed much to the world through their play.<br/><br/>In 2000 the 'Swords &amp; Arrows Role-Playing Game Core Rules were completed, as well as a novel-length story set in Trystell, The Aggression of Licad. The edition of the rules and setting survived as the authority on the topic until 2002, when an attempt to make a second edition was started&mdash;and even a full campaign ran in the developmental version of the second edition rules&mdash;but ultimately the attempt at a second edition was aborted in favor of a full conversion of the Trystell setting to the d20 System.<br/><br/>From there development moved away from the rules that would become Tab-System Classic. A d20 version of Trystell was completed in early 2005, followed by a revised d20 version in late 2006. But the earlier system did not die. It was kept alive, revised and revived in mid-2007.<br/><br/>And here it is: ready to play. This edition of the rules has been made setting neutral at its core, so that it might be used to power the many house settings that have been developed over the years: Trystell, The Zeotis, Arth, etc. (And on that note, keep an eye out for complete Tab-System Classic stats for The Zeotis supplement, when it finally comes out in the not-too distant future.) But also included in this book is a Tab-System Classic conversion of the Trystell setting. The conversion assumes have a copy of the Trystell Campaign Setting Revised (the final version of Trystell made for the d20 System). But if you do not have it handy, the game should still be easy enough to play using the framework for Trystell presented here, and a bit of your imagination.<br/><br/>"}, "98461": {"rpgitemversion": {"98099": "Lulu casewrap version"}, "statistics": {}, "name": "Saga Machine", "rpgproducer": {"48693": "Thorin Tabor"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1477129.png", "usersrated": "0", "average": "0", "rpggenre": {"173": "Generic / Universal"}, "rpg": {"10426": "Saga Machine"}, "rpgcategory": {"2083": "Core Rules (min needed to play)"}, "poll": {}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1477129_t.png", "description": "From &quot;The Aims of the System:&quot;<br/><br/>Despite any pretension we may possess about what a roleplaying game is, the aims involved in the game and what makes such a game good&mdash;Saga Machine is at its core pragmatic. Get a game. Get people playing it. Have a good time. In order to accomplish this we've set forth a few goals in its design.<br/><br/>Simplicity<br/>When in doubt we've endeavored to keep things simple. This makes the game quicker to learn and quicker to play. In our experience not everyone adapts equally well to games that require large amounts of number crunching or referencing of the rules in the book. This can lead to disproportionate amounts of time figuring things out.<br/><br/>In its simplest form, and once the system has been learned, we've attempted to make Saga Machine playable entirely from memory by most people, with no referencing of the book.<br/><br/>Scalability<br/>In designing the system we have attempted to make the game scale nicely. That is, we have tried to make Saga Machine flow smoothly and quickly, whether you have two characters involved in a scene or twenty characters.<br/><br/>Unlike some systems that bog down once you have half a dozen combatants acting each round in combat, Saga Machine has a wealth of options and rules that allow our combat system (and other systems) to handle conflicts ranging from two people to thousands.<br/><br/>Universality<br/>Saga Machine aims to be &quot;universal.&quot; That means we aim for it to be just as capable of running medieval fantasy campaigns as it is for running space opera campaigns, survival horror campaigns or any other number of common role-playing game genres.<br/><br/>The catch is that not every game focuses on the same aspects of characters, the same sorts of situations and stuff like that.<br/>Thus we have our next aim...<br/><br/>Modularity<br/>Face it: not every game needs a full-fledged system for measuring a character's mental state. Not every genre needs a complex system for gaging a character's physical health and combat capability. Because of this simple fact, Saga Machine offloads as much of these contextual sub-systems as possible into optional modules. When starting a new Saga Machine campaign, the GM may decide to make use of any combination of these modules she feels fits the campaign. This allows the game to progress smoothly without being bogged down by unnecessary rules for everything under the sun.<br/><br/>This book later presents five modules that may see use in most popular role-playing genres.<br/><br/>Enabling of Choices<br/>Role-playing games differ from other mediums such as books or plays in that the events in a role-playing game are not pre-scripted; in such a game the player characters always have a choice in how they can act and what they do. The medium is interactive. This is one of the strengths of role-playing games as a medium and one of the reasons that many people find such games to be fun. Saga Machine attempts to embrace this aspect of the role-playing medium, emphasizing character choice and enabling a style of play where player choices matter.<br/><br/>"}, "98462": {"rpgitemversion": {"98100": "US Softcover Version"}, "poll": {}, "name": "Path of the Crusaders", "rpgproducer": {"3": "(Uncredited)"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2310341.jpg", "usersrated": "0", "average": "0", "rpggenre": {"2671": "Kid-Friendly"}, "statistics": {}, "rpg": {"7240": "Choose Your Own Adventure"}, "rpgcategory": {"2136": "Solitaire Adventure"}, "rpgseries": {"26395": "Choose Your Own Adventure: Passport"}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2310341_t.jpg", "description": "User summary.<br/><br/>The reader is a journalist.

I have ordered my test copy of the print book from lulu - it is a 6x9 hardback - and once I make sure that they haven't turned the pdf into garbage, I'll put it up for general availability as both hardback and softcover.<br/><br/>user summary:<br/>This edition of the rules also features different layout, artwork and explanatory sidebars.  Another difference is the credited authors, Matt Finch and Mike Shorten (chgowiz), and an expanded list of editors.<br/><br/>"}, "98482": {"rpgitemversion": {"98138": "PDF Version"}, "poll": {}, "name": "Clockwork", "rpgproducer": {"48341": "Jonathan Becker"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic989662.jpg", "usersrated": "0", "average": "0", "statistics": {}, "rpg": {"10400": "Clockwork"}, "rpgcategory": {"2083": "Core Rules (min needed to play)"}, "rpggenre": {"181": "History (American West)"}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic989662_t.jpg", "description": "user summary:<br/>Clockwork is a role playing microgame about the Old West.<br/><br/>introduction:<br/>Each PC is a veteran soldier of the American Civil War, wounded in battle and now discharged with clockwork driven prosthetic that makes him both more and less human.

Players then roll a die to reveal who has the turn initiative and players then reveal their orders and move units checking for possible contacts with the enemy.  If contact is made with the enemy, tactic cards come into play, each side either playing, Search,Hold, or Evade and rolling a 10 sided die for the outcome, which may still lead to armies not engaging in battle. If battles do occur, then they are resolved using  10 sided dice and cross checking a percentage number for units engaged (Pike,Musket,Dragoons,Horse,Guns,Siege,Ships) on a Fire and Melee table. An example of Pike on Melee is 60%, so if 3 Pike regiments were involved in a battle on either side, 3 10 sided dice would be rolled and would hit on a roll of 1-6.<br/>These rolls can be adjusted by terrain the defender holds, and the Commanders used, who gain battle experience the further the game goes on. Most Commanders start at experience level<br/>0 or 1.Both The King and Cromwell start at 0 experience.<br/>The game is played in weekly turns and starts from Jan 1642 and lasts till September 1650 (a possible 36 turns ).Players may also recruit further armies during recruiting phases in<br/>1643, 1646, and 1649.<br/><br/>"}, "98488": {"statistics": {}, "name": "Dream Chronicles 2: The Eternal Maze", "videogamemode": {"2149": "Single-Player"}, "videogameversion": {"98146": "Windows Downloadable edition"}, "average": "7", "videogameseries": {"10431": "Dream Chronicles: Faye's Journey"}, "videogametheme": {"2148": "Fantasy"}, "videogamegenre": {"2152": "Adventure"}, "videogamefranchise": {"7992": "Dream Chronicles"}, "videogameplatform": {"4977": "Windows"}, "usersrated": "1", "poll": {}, "description": "Dream Chronicles 2: The Eternal Maze is a 2008 adventure, hidden object, and puzzle casual game developed by KatGames and published by PlayFirst.

Suddenly an eerie silence fills the common room. On the table, only one full cup remains. Who will get the last drink? Will it be the elder of the group, or shall the greatest warrior have it? Time seems to stretch to infinity, until one hand makes a move toward the cup. Such insolence! This insult shall not be tolerated! The elder goes for his sword...<br/><br/>We shall never know whether the bold samurai was taking the cup for himself or only to hand it to his venerable companion. It does not matter: all warriors take offense and draw their katanas, joining the fight at the call of &quot;SAAKEEE!&quot;<br/><br/>In Sake &amp; Samurai you are a fierce and thirsty samurai warrior, willing to do anything to get the last cup of Sake. The winner is the most drunk samurai &ndash; in game terms, the player who has collected the most Sake drink counters &ndash; at the end of the Sudden Death round.<br/><br/>Be wary, though, for drinking too much will dull your wits and mastery with the sword. Each drink of Sake prevents you from using one of your resources, be it a weapon, an item, or even your personal skill! You must always be wary not to drink too much or you risk becoming a defenseless sot in the hands of your enemies. On the other hand, you will be able to burn up some of the Sake you have drunk to obtain significant bonuses which may well save your life. Show yourself as the wise warrior you are and balance your strategy with care, not burning up too much Sake, thus finding yourself in the rear at the end of the game, when the Masu is empty and the Sudden death round begins.

The game puts the player into the role of Princess Elise, a young, spoiled princess on a quest to impress a handsome adventurer into being her boyfriend.<br/><br/>My World, My Way features two key game-play elements. One of which is Princess Elise's ability to pout, which prompts enemies and the game's landscape alike to change to her will through the usage of &quot;pout points&quot;. By expending Pout Points the player can do a number of things to make tasks in the game easier, including forcing enemies to drop more money or experience points, completing quests automatically and altering the game's current environment to fulfill in-game requests due to certain items and enemies only being in certain areas. Princess Elise has the ability to make an environment area barren, a grassland, a forest, an island, a fire pit, a graveyard, a desert and more. As the player advances in the game, Elise's selfishness is refined and she gains a variety of different commands.<br/><br/>The second element is Elise's pet &quot;Mimic Slime&quot;, which the player controls in battle along with Elise herself. Instead of leveling up via experience points, the Mimic Slime's abilities increase via mimicking the game's enemies. An example being that if it mimics an enemy with a high amount of hit points, its own hit points will increase, and if that enemy has the ability to equip a certain piece of equipment the Mimic Slime will gain that trait too.<br/><br/>The player traverses the game's world via an unconventional world map. Players choose a town area for the princess to visit, and once she enters, there will be a grid representing the surrounding landscape. One square has a town, one will have a gate, and the rest will be environment squares she can change. In order to unlock the gate, the princess has to fulfill requests from the town's mayor.

In time the Entomi fell to worshiping these creatures, casting aside their gods and driving their priests into the arms of the ever watchful guardians.

In an age of unlikely heroes, there is still hope, like a candle against the darkness of night.<br/><br/>From &quot;Required Materials&quot; on website:<br/><br/>The greatest requirements for playing this game are imagination and the desire to have fun. Beyond that, though, are a few materials that must be used:<br/><br/>Dice - Beyond the Yatzee type dice, there are several other kinds of dice that one may buy in most hobby shops. The notation for die rolling is simple. The [qty]d[type] is used for all die rolls; thus a &quot;1d4&quot; means rolling a four-sided die one time, a &quot;3d6&quot; is thus rolling a six-sided three times. To play a character in the World of Gaianar system, the Player will need one of each of the following kinds of dice:<br/><br/>     Four-sided die (1d4). Can be used as a 1d2 or odd/even die when result is divided by two. This die is primarily used for assessing combat damage from small weapons such as daggers.<br/>     Six-sided die (1d6). The d6 is frequently used for assessing combat damage from bowshot, small swords, and firearms. It can also be used as a 1d3 if the result is divided by two. This die is also used in determining combat initiative.<br/>     Eight-sided die (1d8). This kind of die is used in assessing healing points. It is used for assessing damage inflicted by many kinds of swords. It can also be used as a random compass rose directional generator.<br/>     Ten-sided die (1d10). This die can also be used as a 1d5 when the result is divided by two. Large swords and clubs inflict damage based on a 1d10. Two d10's rolled concurrently can be used as a percentile generator, i.e. rolling numbers between 1 and 100. The percentile is used in many resistance rolls as well as most thief and tracking skills.<br/>     Twelve-sided die (1d12). This kind of die is used for damage inflicted by powerful crossbows and large swords. It is also used for determining random encounters while the party of PC's travel.<br/>     Twenty-sided die (1d20). Only one die of this type is required. This die is used for determining the outcome for most forms of attacks, parries, saving throws, and ability checks. It can also be used to calculate the damage inflicted by shotguns.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Character Record Sheets - A three-page form is provided that can be used to store all of the character's attributes, abilities, information, and possessions. The character record sheet template included with this gaming system may be photocopied as often as required.<br/><br/>"}, "98065": {"rpgitemversion": {"292833": "DOC Version"}, "statistics": {}, "name": "Rules for Players 2nd Edition", "rpgproducer": {"48518": "Christopher P.

Each level consists of four waves of different aliens, each of which has a specific style of loose or formal formations. The levels end with a refueling stage where the player must dock with a space station.<br/><br/>In the first level it only takes one shot to destroy an alien, so the drain on fuel from moving and shooting is not very critical. Later levels require two or more shots to destroy each alien, and care is required to avoid running out of fuel.<br/><br/>If the player fails to destroy all of the aliens in a wave, allowing one or more aliens to exit the bottom of the screen, then the wave is repeated with the player's ship located higher up from the bottom of the screen. This gives the player even less time to shoot the aliens the second time around.<br/><br/>The alien Flagship occasionally pops up in the middle of the waves, firing its laser bolt at the player's ship. The Flagship also makes an appearance during each docking stage. The player may choose to try to maneuver around the Flagship and complete docking, or try to destroy the Flagship before docking. However, careful aim is required in this stage, because if the player accidentally shoots the space station, it will respond with a laser blast that vaporizes the player's ship.<br/><br/>"}, "98068": {"rpgitemversion": {"292829": "HTML Version"}, "statistics": {}, "name": "The Book of Spiritual Powers 2nd Edition", "rpgproducer": {"48518": "Christopher P.

Egregious examples of chametz include pizza, donuts, cookies, cupcakes, pretzels, and crackers.  &quot;Chametz: The Search is On!&quot; is played similarly to &quot;Clue&quot; but instead of deducing a murder, the players must determine which character left which item of chametz in which room.  It's especially appropriate because Jewish law requires families to search their home and clean it of all chametz before Passover begins.<br/><br/>The board is a blueprint of a house with six rooms (kitchen, bedroom, dining room, living room, office and garage).  There are also six items of food and six characters.<br/><br/>Eighteen cards are included (one for each character, food and room).  After separating the cards into the 3 categories and secretly hiding one character, one food and one room in the small envelope provided, the remaining cards are shuffled and then dealt out to the entire group, clockwise, until all cards are gone.  Players may begin in any room as long as they choose it before seeing their cards.  They take turns rolling a six-sided die to determine how far they can walk around the perimeter of the home (with entrances off the main spaces).<br/><br/>Upon entering a room, players may make a guess as to the hidden person, food and room.  The player to their left may prove them wrong by showing a card in their hand that matches one of the items in the guess. If that player has no matches, the guess goes to the next person.  If nobody has a match, the player can check the hidden cards to see if they're right.<br/><br/>Players do not have to write with pen or pencil (another prohibition for Jews on the Sabbath and Holidays) and instead place cardboard markers in a noteboard with 18 slots (one for each item).<br/><br/>The cardboard markers can be placed in the slot in such a way as to &quot;point&quot; left, right or up, and may be used to remind yourself who showed you that particular item.<br/><br/>There are 4 mandatory &quot;Question Squares&quot; on the board and 4 optional ones.  When landing on these squares, the player is read a question from the stack of Question Cards based on another roll of the die (each Question Card has True/False, Multiple Choice and Fill-in-the-Blank versions of the question).  A roll of 1 or 2 gets the easier True-False version, and 5 or 6 gets the hardest Fill-in-the-Blank version.  The questions pertain to Passover and Jewish History.<br/><br/>After answering correctly, the player may immediately jump to any room on the board and make a guess.  There are no secret passageways between rooms otherwise.<br/><br/>First player to guess the hidden character, food and room wins.  To play with 2 players, one card is placed face down in each room before dealing the cards out.  So when entering a room, the player may choose to make a guess or look at the face-down card (it's essentially a 3rd player who shows one of their cards when you enter each room).<br/><br/>"}, "98107": {"rpgitemversion": {"97331": "PDF Version"}, "poll": {}, "name": "The Vale", "rpgproducer": {"28031": "Lee F.

If neither of a player's face-up cards are valid plays, they have the option of discarding any one of their cards and replacing it with a newly drawn card.<br/><br/>If, after a player's turn, the value of the central pile reaches exactly 25, they sweep aside the pile - scoring one point - and the next player plays the next move, starting a new pile.<br/><br/>The first player to score 3 points has won the game.<br/><br/>"}, "98126": {"statistics": {}, "name": "Defense Command", "videogamemode": {"2409": "Hotseat"}, "videogamecompilation": {"141537": "Games Pack Two: Defense Command \u2013 Stellar Escort"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic986481.jpg", "videogametheme": {"2264": "Science Fiction"}, "usersrated": "0", "videogamecharacter": {"10082": "Flagship"}, "average": "0", "videogamegenre": {"2314": "Arcade"}, "videogameplatform": {"5930": "TRS-80 Model I/III"}, "videogameversion": {"97364": "TRS-80 Cassette edition"}, "poll": {}, "vgcharacterversion": {"98203": "The Evil Flagship"}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic986481_t.jpg", "description": "User Summary<br/><br/>Defense Command is the seventh and final Bill Hogue programmed arcade game that Big Five Software released for the TRS-80.<br/><br/>Not directly inspired by any arcade game, although perhaps partially inspired by Defender, Defense Command challenges the player to defend a supply of fuel cells arrayed across the bottom of the screen. The player's Laser Command Base moves back and forth across the bottom of the screen shooting missiles at a non-stop onslaught of aliens. The alien ships swoop down from the top of the screen to try to steal fuel cells. The player must use careful aim as only one missile can be on the screen at a time.<br/><br/>If an alien grabs a fuel cell, it tries to escape off the top of the screen with it.

You fly down to the yacht&rsquo;s location, but as it turns out the &ldquo;yacht&rdquo; is a small junker that is questionably seaworthy.<br/><br/>Can you make a living with this boat?  What can you do?  Fish?  Become a rum runner?  While contemplating your future at a local restaurant, the local news station runs a story depicting a man and his crew popping a bottle of Champagne as they celebrate finding a wreck full of Spanish treasure.  &ldquo;Why not me?&rdquo; you ask yourself....  Why not you?<br/><br/>Armed only with your boat and 50 Trade Credits (TCs), you decide to set out tomorrow to find treasure and fame in the waters between the U.S. and the Bahamas.  You will have to learn to dive, sail, and methods for search and recovery.  Will you try to advance conservatively, or try to advance quickly by luck?  Will you try to depend on cheaper equipment, or spend the fruits of your labors on the latest in high-tech equipment?  It will not be easy, and the competition with other wanna-be treasure hunters will be fierce.<br/><br/>Your goal is to become the most renowned treasure hunter the Bahamas has ever known.  Up to 6 players take on the role of one of 16 international treasure hunters, each with different individual strengths.  Players may choose to visit the ports of Miami, Port Lucaya, or Alice Town to purchase and sell dive equipment, boating equipment, search and recovery supplies, and other merchandise; players may choose to explore unexplored areas of the sea by turning over sea tiles with random depths, or dive in explored areas.<br/><br/>A player begins as an unexperienced diver, limited to shallow depths, limited by poor air consuption, and lack of equipment.  Beginning divers will be glad to recover minor treasures such as lobster, and shells during their freedives.  The more dives that are completed the more experience is gained.  The diver is allowed to make dives leading to greater depths, and with a larger possibility to obtain greater treasure.  The greater the treasure the diver recovers, the more Trade Credits a diver will earn at market.  The combination of experience and Trade Credits will allow the diver to eventually recover treasures that are worth too much money to sell on market, but can be donated to the Miami Nautical Museum in exchange for Victory Points.  The first player to win 10 victory points becomes the most renowned treasure hunter the Bahamas has ever known, and is the victor!<br/><br/>DIVE! is a board game made by a diver, but which can be played by divers and non-divers alike.  No dive experience is needed, however, those familiar with diving will recognize diving concepts.  Divers will also recognize some of the concepts in this game are not exactly realistic.  That is because making real concepts unrealistic, makes the game fun!  That being said, playing DIVE! should not be seen as a substitution for scuba training, and the concepts in the game should not be used in actual diving.  If you are interested in diving, please contact your local PADI dive center.<br/><br/>"}, "98130": {"poll": {}, "name": "Mein kleines Pony: Das Traumschloss-Spiel", "playingtime": "0", "minplayers": "2", "yearpublished": "1986", "usersrated": "3", "boardgamefamily": {"7523": "Animals: Horses"}, "maxplayers": "4", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic990674_t.jpg", "average": "4.5", "statistics": {}, "boardgamepublisher": {"17055": {"name": "MB peli"}}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic990674.jpg", "boardgameversion": {"279195": "English edition"}, "maxplaytime": "0", "boardgamecategory": {"1041": {"name": "Children's Game"}}, "age": "4", "minplaytime": "0", "description": "What it is: A very simple, &quot;My little Pony&quot;-themed racing game for children.<br/><br/>Aim: Be the first to reach the dream castle.<br/><br/>How it is played: The game board shows a race course consisting of horseshoes in five different colours.

While researching a variety of neurological problems in an attempt to save her own life, Motherboard came across several young people who were essentially prisoners in their own bodies. The plight of these individuals resonated with her and she liberated them from the facilities in which they were housed, then gave them the means to interact with the world around them. Digital Demon, Pulse, and Rez, similar to Motherboard, have bodies kept safely in medical pods while highly advanced technology lets them roam free outside of those bodies. Both Sister Steel and Heavy Metal were rescued by Motherboard before she discovered the Hard Light Interactive Construct (HLIC) technology the others use and have decided to retain their cybernetic and robotic shells.<br/><br/>In the relatively short time the Tribe has been active, they&rsquo;ve built a reputation among the tech-criminal community as thieves of the first order, able to get into practically anywhere and steal what they want. They&rsquo;ve also managed to make allies among other &ldquo;victims&rdquo; of corporate and government callousness, and helped fund some social initiatives from behind layers of shell companies.<br/><br/>The Tribe&rsquo;s problems are about to escalate. Motherboard stole the technological know-how she used to help Pulse, Digital Demon, and Rez from a secret government program. The schematics and other files belonged to a rogue black-ops outfit, an outfit with a strong anti-extraterrestrial stance and the technology to pose a threat. They have figured out the connection between the Tribe&rsquo;s technology and their own computer breaches and intend to terminate the problem with extreme prejudice.<br/><br/>"}, "98133": {"rpg": {"9041": "Mutants & Masterminds (3rd Edition)"}, "poll": {}, "name": "Cerebrus Rex", "rpgproducer": {"5875": "Jon Leitheusser"}, "usersrated": "1", "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic983992.jpg", "rpgitemversion": {"97388": "PDF version"}, "rpgsetting": {"9864": "Emerald City"}, "average": "7", "statistics": {}, "rpggenre": {"171": "Action / Adventure (Superheroes)"}, "rpgcategory": {"2108": "Sourcebook (rules/options to enhance play)"}, "rpgseries": {"9857": "Threat Report"}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic983992_t.jpg", "description": "From publisher blurb:<br/><br/>Cerebrus Rex: On the primordial Earth where this Saurian genius was born, giant reptiles became tool users and conquered and enslaved their Simian rivals.

He is given a time limit to run through each one while avoiding obstacles and collecting items. The actual running happens automatically, the job of the player is to dodge obstacles and collect items by moving the character sideways and adjusting the speed.<br/><br/>If the character finishes the race within the time limit, the remaining time is converted into bonus points and he moves on to the next track. Every fourth track is a special track, which uses the time left over from the previous three as additional time. However, if the character hasn't reached the finish line when the time limit is up, the game is over.<br/><br/>Obstacles along the way include glass panels, which break under the character's weight and drop him to a hole, and steam jets which shoot steam at the character. Landing on a glass panel and pushing forward on the joystick, however, creates an extra long jump. Later tracks also feature balls that bounce along the track and must be avoided. Colliding with an obstacle results in a penalty of a few seconds. Later levels include frogs that attempt to jump on you and slow you down. If 3 frogs jump on you at the same time, you are reduced to a very slow speed.<br/><br/>Also along the track are springboards, which can be used to propel the character forward at a great speed. Some tracks have a special layout of springboards, where it is possible to use a springboard to land directly on another one. Some tracks also have skateboards which speed the character up and make him immune to some obstacles. There are two colours of cans found along the track. Kicking the cans gains bonus points, but jumping on them and knocking them over activates a special effect. Jumping on a blue can stops the timer for a few seconds, and jumping on a green can gives an extra burst of speed.<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;Metro-Cross,&quot; available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "98186": {"videogame": {"103433": "Konami's Coin-Op Hits"}, "statistics": {}, "name": "Mikie", "videogamemode": {"2409": "Hotseat"}, "videogameversion": {"97476": "European Commodore 64 edition"}, "average": "6", "videogametheme": {"2472": "School"}, "usersrated": "1", "videogamegenre": {"2147": "Action"}, "videogameplatform": {"4420": "Commodore 64"}, "poll": {}, "videogamecompilation": {"103433": "Konami's Coin-Op Hits"}, "description": "Mikie is a 1984 arcade game by Konami where the player must guide a student called &quot;Mikie&quot; around the school, classroom, and locker room to collect hearts which make up a letter from his girlfriend Mandy while being chased by various members of the school staff.

Redakai cards have Blast 3D technology, making them appear 3D, as well as making attacks appear to animate as the player moves the card.<br/><br/>In Redakai, a player is trying to eliminate the character(s) controlled by the opponent to win the game. In the basic game, each player starts with one character and on a turn you draw a card from your deck, then play it immediately. The card types are monster &ndash; which are played on your own character to boost defenses and heal damage &ndash; and attack &ndash; which are played on the opponent's character. A character can have defenses in three colors &ndash; green, red, blue &ndash; and if an attack is stronger than a character's defense in that attack's color, then the attack hits and damages the character.<br/><br/>The cards are transparent and they stack on top of each other during play. A character's health is represented by three damage zones on the card, and if all these zones turn red (by playing one or more attacks on that character), then the character is eliminated. An attack can also cover up and remove a character's defense, while monsters can boost defenses and cover red damage zones with yellow ones, thus healing the character.<br/><br/>In the advance game, each player controls three characters and starts with a hand of three cards and a maximum Kairu value of three. Each turn, a player boosts his maximum Kairu by one (to a maximum of 20), draws one card, then (optionally) plays monster and attack cards, spending Kairu to do so equal to the cost on each card. Some cards have &quot;react&quot; abilities that allow you to spend Kairu to defend against attacks. At the start of each turn, your Kairu refreshes to its maximum value.<br/><br/>If you eliminate all three of your opponent's characters, you win the game.

The cat starts his journey through the maze at the end on the right. The mice start at the beginning on the left. The cat sniffs his way through the maze looking for mice.

However a pyramid card can also rank low in a sequence of cards, much like an Ace can in standard playing cards.<br/><br/>Sequence examples:<br/><br/><br/>     Pyramid, 13, 12, 11, 10 (much like Ace, King, Queen, Jack, 10)<br/>     5, 4, 3, 2, Pyramid (much like 5, 4, 3, 2, Ace)<br/><br/><br/>Cylon cards are used as wild cards, and can be played one of two ways. The card can either be a stand in for which ever card the player wants it to be OR it can be the Cap Stone to created a Full Pyramid, which is the highest possible winning hand in the game.<br/><br/>Players are dealt initially 5 cards in Pyramid. The cards are dealt out like in Poker, one at a time around the table, beginning with the player to the dealer's left.<br/><br/>Once the cards are dealt, the player to the dealer's left bets first and places their bet into the pot. Then the dealer will ask if anyone would like new cards and how many they want. Players can discard up to 4 cards.<br/><br/>After the new cards are dealt, each player can either surrender (discard and sit out the hand), call (match the pot), or raise (match the pot and raise it). If a player decides to raise, every other player must match this raise in order to stay in the game or surrender.<br/><br/>The following is the rank of winning Pyramid hands:<br/><br/><br/>     Full Pyramid - Pyramid, Pyramid, Pyramid, Pyramid, Cylon<br/>     Kobol - Pyramid, 13, 12, 11, 10<br/>     Colony - 5 cards in sequence AND of the same color<br/>     Quorum - 5 cards in sequence of any color<br/>     Quad - 4 cards of the same rank, one of each color<br/>     Triad - 3 of a kind<br/>     Duo - a pair<br/><br/><br/>If more than one player has matching hand types, then the hand that has the highest card wins out. For example two players have a Quorum. One player has 7, 6, 5, 4, 3 and the other player has 8, 7, 6, 5, 4. The second player, the one with the 8, beats the hand of the first player.<br/><br/>Much like Poker, Pyramid is a game of bets and bluffs. The goal is to win the most money in the end. Use your wits and your best Pyramid face to win all the Cubits!<br/><br/>"}, "98251": {"rpgitemversion": {"97615": "PDF Version"}, "statistics": {}, "name": "Savaged Fallout: Wasteland Survival Guide", "rpgproducer": {"3": "(Uncredited)"}, "rpg": {"286": "Savage Worlds"}, "usersrated": "0", "rpggenre": {"167": "History (Alternative)"}, "rpgcategory": {"2107": "Campaign Setting (game world)"}, "poll": {}, "average": "0", "description": "User Summary: A fan-created adaptation of the popular Bethesda video-game to the Savage Worlds system.

Germans regained their spirit (crushed after defeat at Stalingrad) after successful recapturing of Kharkov and hoped new powerful tanks Panthers and Tigers allow them to crush Russian defense. It took time to deploy new equipment to the battle which gave Soviets time to prepare deep defenses. On the other side Russian generals planned to slow and weaken attacking German forces and after they have no more offensive power launch Soviet counteroffensive.<br/><br/>German assault was formed by two pincers - one attacking from the North while the other from the South. German plan was to cut off Soviet forces (5 armies) in Kursk bulge and destroy them. North pincer was a bit weaker and faced much more condense defensive lines which took much more time to break through. Assaulting forces was successfully distracted on July 12th by Soviet offensive to the north of the Kursk salient that was aimed toward Orel - directly at the rear of the assaulting Germans.<br/><br/>On the south German forces was much more successful. After fierce combats they managed to break Soviet defenses and reached Obojan and Prokhorovka which was last Soviet defense before Kursk. Soviet forces was exhausted and suffered heavy losses during the battle (Soviet 5th Guards Army defending Prokhorovka was 50 tangs out of 650 that it had couple of days before). On July 12th ,although German commander - general Mainstein insisted on final push and break of Soviet defenses, Hitler - impressed by Allied invasion of Sicily and Soviet offensive towards Orel decided to abandon operation &quot;Zittadele&quot;.<br/><br/>There are many myths that arose around the battle - mainly due to the fact that any real data available was kept confidential for a long time. It is fact that Germans did not break through Soviet lines but from recent historical materials it appears that Germans might have been very close to success. General Mainstein described the battle as German's lost victory - and, at least on the South, it looks like Germans were really close. Also German losses was extremely exaggerated (on July 11 - day of famous battle at Prokhorovka Germans lost around 48 tanks) while Soviet loses was tremendous.

This game will keep you out in space. You can play against the computer or a friend. If you've had enough of playing hide and seek, bring your lunar lander down into a soft landing without crashing.<br/><br/>[Game 1: Galactic Space War]<br/><br/>The screen will automatically show the Galactic Space War screen of stars moving out from the center. The screen is the front window of your space ship in which you visually search out the enemy. At the bottom of the screen are 4 sets of numbers.<br/><br/>On the far left are the range coordinates of the enemy space ship. It corresponds to an X and Y axis graph. In moving your screen left or right you are in the Y axis. You are trying to get the coordinates to register 00. In this way you will locate the enemy ship. The second set of numbers is the time limit. It is automatically programmed for 99 units of time, (not necessarily seconds but time units).<br/><br/>The third set of numbers is the player's score against the enemy. Certain targets are worth more points than others. The small fighter is worth 1 point. The battle ship is worth 2. The freighter is 3 points and the star ship is worth 4 points. Every time a hit is scored it will register in red on that set of numbers. The last set of numbers on the right is the enemy's score. It scores 1 every time a hit is made. The enemy can score a hit from certain coordinates but mainly fires from the center of the screen at or close to the point where the player's lasers cross when fired.<br/><br/>For 2 players:<br/><br/>The player with the right hand controller guides the search ship and fires the lasers as if playing the one player game.<br/><br/>The player with the left hand controller maneuvers the enemy ship and can either try to stay hidden or get into position for firing at the search ship. The enemy does not control the firing. The computer fires the laser while the player tries to keep his ship from being hit by the opponent. Both players know where the enemy ship is in distance by following the X<br/>and Y coordinates registered at bottom left hand side of the screen. The enemy may try to keep the farthest distance away by constantly increasing these numbers by moving the hand controller.<br/><br/>Chase your friends around in space as they try to avoid you.<br/><br/>[Game 2: Lunar Lander]<br/><br/>The game automatically sets up the lunar surface, the green landing pad and the spaceship suspended on the screen.<br/><br/>Below the lunar surface there appear two sets of numbers. Those at the lower left show the units of fuel remaining in the lunar lander, starting with 99 units. If the player runs fuel to zero, the lunar lander will free fall and crash. The set of numbers at the lower right shows the time elapsed from when the lunar lander appears and starts to land.<br/><br/>If the lunar lander passes too far to the left or right, so as to move outside of the screen, the lunar lander will appear on the other side of the screen, moving in the same direction.<br/><br/>Now, give it a try and get that lander down into a soft landing.<br/><br/>"}, "98281": {"rpg": {"1627": "Pathfinder Roleplaying Game"}, "poll": {}, "name": "The Hungry Storm", "rpgproducer": {"36215": "Judy Bauer"}, "usersrated": "10", "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1127561.jpg", "rpgitemversion": {"97684": "PDF Version"}, "rpgsetting": {"1897": "Golarion"}, "average": "7.1", "statistics": {}, "rpggenre": {"278": "Culture (Asian / Far Eastern)"}, "rpgcategory": {"2084": "Scenario / Adventure / Module"}, "rpgseries": {"9845": "Jade Regent"}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1127561_t.jpg", "description": "From the publisher's website:<br/><br/>Traveling with a caravan they've built up from scratch over the course of the previous adventures, the heroes must navigate Golarion's frozen northern continent, the so-called &quot;Crown of the World,&quot; to reach the distant land of Minkai on the other side of the planet.
