XCOM: Enemy Unknown will be instantly recognizable to fans of the original X-COM, while breaking new ground in strategy games for today&rsquo;s console and Windows PC gamers. With equal emphasis on deep strategy and intense tactical combat, XCOM: Enemy Unknown will place players in control of a secret paramilitary organization called XCOM. As the XCOM commander, players will defend against a terrifying global alien invasion by managing resources, advancing technologies, and overseeing combat strategies and individual unit tactics.<br/><br/>We&rsquo;re looking forward to building upon the core gameplay experiences that fans of the original X-COM love, while introducing the franchise to a new generation, said Sarah Anderson, senior vice president of marketing for 2K. With Firaxis&rsquo; XCOM: Enemy Unknown and 2K Marin&rsquo;s upcoming XCOM, 2K Games will be offering two different gameplay experiences drawing from the classic X-COM universe. Each game offers a unique XCOM experience in different genres, as envisioned by two different studios with unique creative visions.<br/><br/>Released in 1993, the original X-COM is widely regarded as one of the best games ever made and has now been re-imagined by the strategy experts at Firaxis Games. XCOM: Enemy Unknown will expand on that legacy with an entirely new invasion story, enemies and technologies to fight aliens and defend Earth. Players will control the fate of the human race through researching alien technologies, creating and managing a fully operational base, planning combat missions and controlling soldier movement in battle.<br/><br/>It&rsquo;s been a dream of ours to recreate X-COM with our unique creative vision.

Well, here is the abridged version for two player games:<br/><br/>Players have 6 custom dice each, these dice have attack and defence icons on. They roll the dice to build up a 'fighting hand' with which to fight each other. Of the 6 dice, 3 are on show to all, three are kept secret.<br/><br/>The attacking players attack by playing one of their dice that shows an attack value. The defending player must play a die that shows the correct defense value to counter the attack value played on them. The attacker then plays a die with an attack value that counters the defense die just played by the defender.<br/><br/>This continues until one player is unable to play a die. If the defender can't play a die, they take a point of damage.<br/><br/>For games of more than 2 players, the actions gets even more intense as players attack who they want with the winner being the player with the least amount of damage taken when the first player to take all their damage is knocked out. So, attacking the player with the most damage isn't always the best tactic!<br/><br/>Capable of filling just as little as 5 minutes for two players but capable of being a big as you want. The more players you add, the more fun it is.<br/><br/>Being compact, it's easy to always having FFC with you. This means you and your mates never end up sitting around with nothing to do at your local club/store as you wait for your opponents to turn up. Just get out your dice and throw down with some mates for some real &lsquo;underground fight club&rsquo; action as a warm up for your main event!<br/><br/>"}, "120134": {"statistics": {}, "name": "Anduin (Issue 61 - Jun 2001)", "rpgproducer": {"58290": "Tommy Heinig"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1232963.jpg", "usersrated": "0", "average": "0", "rpgissue": {"3093": "Anduin"}, "rpgissuearticle": {"106177": "Abschaum der Menschheit"}, "rpg": {"199": "7th Sea"}, "rpgissueversion": {"153044": "PDF version"}, "poll": {}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1232963_t.jpg", "description": "This issue contains the DSA adventure &quot;Insel der 1.000 Schlangen&quot; and the 7th sea adventure &quot;Abschaum der Menschheit&quot;<br/><br/>This is the first pdf issue of the Anduin, it is free for download.<br/><br/>"}, "120135": {"poll": {}, "name": "Reise durch Nord- und Mitteldeutschland", "playingtime": "25", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": {"2035": "Roll / Spin and Move"}, "yearpublished": "0", "usersrated": "0", "boardgamefamily": {"10643": "Country: Germany"}, "maxplayers": "6", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1233411_t.png", "average": "0", "statistics": {}, "boardgamepublisher": {"19017": {"name": "Verlag Schmidt Zwiebelt\u00fcrme"}}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1233411.png", "boardgameversion": {"153045": "First edition"}, "maxplaytime": "25", "boardgamecategory": {"1041": {"name": "Children's Game"}}, "age": "6", "minplaytime": "25", "description": "Objective: be the first to pass finish line<br/> - moving by turns -<br/>simple 'Roll &amp; Move' game;<br/>each player throws the die moving forward; ending on a marked space follow instuctions of rule sheet.<br/>Remarks:<br/>game has two seperate boards which show north &amp; middle  region of W-Germany<br/>printed ~ mid. 1950's<br/><br/>"}, "120137": {"statistics": {}, "name": "Menacer 6-Game Cartridge", "videogamemode": {"2149": "Single-Player"}, "videogameversion": {"153047": "North American Genesis edition"}, "average": "5.5", "videogametheme": {"2428": "Minigame Compilation"}, "usersrated": "2", "videogamegenre": {"2505": "Shoot 'em Up"}, "videogameplatform": {"4438": "SEGA Master System"}, "poll": {}, "description": "The Menacer 6-game cartridge was the title Sega bundled with the Menacer for the Sega Mega Drive/Genesis.

Synopsis: Dare you take on the might of the Empire to free your home planet from its clutches? You are an intergalactic Hauler who is inadvertently enlisted in the ranks of a secret rebellion operating on your once free home-world and preparing to begin a drive to free it from tyranny. Your world is one of the last to be conquered by a formidable galactic administration which has turned itself swiftly and secretively into a despotic empire.

The whole campaign can be replayed as well as several scenarios covering key parts of the battle. The game also allows alternative plans to be explored such as the original plan for the US 504th parachute regiment to be airdropped just outside Carroceto on the Via Anziate.<br/><br/>Extract from draft design notes...<br/><br/>&hellip;In order to calculate the hex grid needed I looked into the area required to deploy regimental sized units. German, American and British regimental units varied in size and composition, and by 1944 most units were suffering some level of depletion of manpower. Couple this with documented doctrinal frontages rarely being achieved on the ground and the calculation of accurate frontages becomes very problematic. A German infantry division in 1944 had three infantry regiments as well as an assortment of artillery, support and HQ companies and battalions. Each German infantry regiment consisted of two battalions. Bull (2005) states a German battalion in an attack frontage would occupy 400-1000m, and Rottman (2004) has their defensive frontage as 800-2000m. Disregarding any particular formations if these two battalions were placed in line the regiment would need:<br/><br/>German Regimental Frontages <br/>Attack 800-2000m &frac12; mile to 1&frac14; miles <br/>Defense 1600-4000m 1 mile to 2&frac12; miles<br/><br/>British brigades (equivalent to regiments) and US regiments were somewhat larger than their German counterparts, having an additional infantry battalion. Doctrine would seldom recommend placing all of a regiments units in line, with some elements held back in reserve, so using with the above German calculation offers a useful yardstick.<br/><br/>The next design problem then emerged, how to simulate the different frontages of units and the particular advantages and disadvantages of each? Units in a defensive frontage should be able to defend a longer front and have some defensive advantage. Units in an attack frontage should be able to concentrate their strength and have the advantage of easier movement. The game simulates different frontages by allowing units to be within a single hex (attack frontage) or two hexes (defensive frontage) - additional aspects of the differing frontages are discussed later.<br/><br/>So using the German regimental frontage above I calculated that a single hex needed to be able to contain a regiment in an attack frontage of &frac12; to 1&frac14; miles. Taking into account that the allied formations were a little larger a scale of 1&frac12; miles across each hex seems suitable. A regiment in a defensive frontage would cover around 3 miles. Each hex contains around 3&frac12; square miles.<br/><br/>This hex grid was then placed over a map of the campaign area and adjustments made in order for the grid to fit&hellip;<br/><br/>"}, "120212": {"rpgitemversion": {"153229": "PDF Version"}, "statistics": {}, "name": "Wizardry and Witchcraft", "rpgproducer": {"64722": "Eric Aili"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1234113.jpg", "usersrated": "0", "average": "0", "rpggenre": {"430": "Occult (Magic)"}, "rpg": {"17551": "Wizardry and  Witchcraft"}, "rpgcategory": {"2083": "Core Rules (min needed to play)"}, "poll": {}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1234113_t.jpg", "description": "Publisher blurb:<br/><br/>Welcome to Wizardry and Witchcraft, a game in a book that helps you tell stories.

The player has to navigate various obstacles and obtain weapon pickups to succeed. The game operates a left-behind principle: the camera tries to keep all players in one screen, and if one drops far enough behind in the race, they are eliminated, and the other players race on. This continues until there is one player left, who is given two points, while the rest of the racers also gain or lose points depending on their final position in the round. The system then repeats until a player reaches a set number of points, usually 10 or 12. In multiplayer, knocked out players have the option of striking cars still racing with partially controlled missiles, known as airstrikes.<br/><br/>In North America, Mashed was eventually released in late 2006 for PS2 and Xbox, simply titled as &quot;Drive to Survive&quot;, which was also the original subtitle for the game. It is notable that the game was later re-priced at $10.<br/><br/>This version contained multiple game fixes, extra weapons, vehicles and tracks, as it was developed on a different engine to that of the first game. Also, the game featured improved sound, graphics and load times.<br/><br/>Mashed Fully Loaded features 15 main tracks or courses:<br/><br/>Angel Peak<br/>    Kharga Temple<br/>    Neustein<br/>    Fort Gidlow<br/>    Ventura Boulevard<br/>    Demolition<br/>    Keister Bay<br/>    Polar Wharf<br/>    Tierra Piedra<br/>    Koko Bay<br/>    Silver Creek<br/>    Timgidski<br/>    Redpool Tip<br/>    Nukov<br/>    Hattan City<br/><br/>Mashed Fully Loaded features 9 weapon types:<br/><br/>Proximity Mine: This weapon allows you to place up to two proximity mines behind you. When you place a mine it takes one second to arm itself. When armed proximity mines are colored red. The mine will explode when a vehicle drives over it or passes close by.<br/><br/>Drum Bomb: This weapon allows you to throw devastating exploding barrels behind you. The explosion can often be enough to take out a whole pack of drivers behind you.<br/><br/>Oil Slick: This allows you to pour oil over the road behind you, again great for corners. Oil on the road makes driving a car very difficult!<br/><br/>Flamethrower: This rear-firing weapon deals in napalm death! Toast the car behind you and watch them burn!<br/><br/>Shotgun: This unique sideways firing weapon allows you to attack two enemies simultaneously. Just pull up next to an enemy and blow the sucker away. Do it right and it&rsquo;ll throw most cars in the air.<br/><br/>Homing Missile: This is the most powerful weapon available in Mashed. It uses a laser sight, that when locked on to an enemy turns from the color green to red. When it&rsquo;s locked on fire away!<br/><br/>Machine Gun: This baby allows you to gun down any foe in front. It uses a laser sight that turns red when locked on. Every bullet that hits will make it harder for your enemies to control their cars while causing damage.<br/><br/>Flash Bang: This weapon can be particularly effective on the turns. If you fire it when your opponents are trying to negotiate a precarious corner, they won&rsquo;t be able to tell where they are going. Just be careful when to use it, because you&rsquo;ll be partially blinded as well!<br/><br/>Mortar: This long distance weapon gives you three shots. The best thing about this sucker is that it has some homing capability, making it very dangerous in the right hands.<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;Mashed&quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "120235": {"statistics": {}, "name": "Melty Blood", "videogamemode": {"2149": "Single-Player"}, "videogameversion": {"153299": "Japanese Windows edition"}, "average": "0", "videogameseries": {"17559": "Melty Blood"}, "videogametheme": {"2265": "Horror"}, "usersrated": "0", "videogamegenre": {"2159": "Fighting"}, "videogameplatform": {"4977": "Windows"}, "poll": {}, "description": "Melty Blood (\u30e1\u30eb\u30c6\u30a3\u30d6\u30e9\u30c3\u30c9 Meruti Buraddo), is a visual novel and fighting game, co-developed by d\u014djin circles Type-Moon and French-Bread, originally released at Comiket on December 2002. It is shortened as simply Merubura (\u30e1\u30eb\u30d6\u30e9).  Based on Type Moon's visual novel game, Tsukihime, it later spawned an arcade version, titled Act Cadenza, the first Type-Moon title to receive a PlayStation 2 port.<br/><br/>The story of Melty Blood follows one year after Tsukihime. Shiki Tohno hears of a new series of murders in Misaki similar to the one's that took place Tsukihime. Whilst searching for the murderer he meets Sion Eltnam Atlasia who initiates a fight with him, attempting to capture him. After the fight she reveals that her reason for trying to capture him is to get in contact with the &quot;True Ancestor&quot; (referring to Arcueid) so that she may acquire information on the &quot;cure for vampirism&quot;. Shiki then decides to help her with this task.<br/><br/>The story moves through a series of fights. Depending on the outcome of the fight the story will branch in one of two ways. Ultimately this corresponds to the ending of the game.<br/><br/>Only six characters were available to be played, with eight more being unlockable through story-mode. However, in a later update released for the game (the 'Nero' patch), all the characters are available from the start. The reasons for this are slightly unclear; they appear to be the result of a legal misunderstanding whereby Type-Moon mistakenly thought they would no longer be allowed to produce updates/patches, and thus made a 'last patch' which unlocked the characters as a sort of gift for the fans. Whatever the reason, Type-Moon has left these characters available throughout all subsequent releases.<br/><br/>Melty Blood makes use of widely used concepts in fighting games such as cancels (canceling a normal attack with a special attack before its animation ends, allowing for more complex and damaging combos) chain combos (normal moves that cancel into other normal moves) and the use of super bars (Magic Circuits). It also introduces Shielding, an advanced defensive technique.<br/><br/>EX-Shielding: A high-risk/reward technique which eliminates the damage and 'block-stun' from an attack. Activated by a button press, it requires exact timing to 'deflect' the opponent's attack, thus exposing them to a reversal. However, if mis-timed, an EX-Shield attempt leaves the player extremely vulnerable. EX-Shielding also carries a damage penalty for subsequent attacks, but grants a small amount of Magic Circuit and disallows the opponent to cancel his/her attack into another one. Finally, in later versions of Melty Blood, EX-Shielding during the Blood Heat state activates a unique attack known as a Last Arc. In Melty Blood: Act Cadenza, a new type of Shielding was introduced which allows the player to hold the Shield button for an extended length of time to defend against multiple attacks. However, this rapidly drains Magic Circuit, and grants fewer retaliatory options upon recovery. In Melty Blood: Actress Again shielding varies depending on which style you pick with Half Moon having the ability of an auto-counter and Full Moon with the same ability except it is manually executed after successfully landing a shield.<br/><br/>Magic Circuit: A system that allows players to store up to 300% meter, for various uses such as EX Attacks (high-powered versions of special techniques) and the Heat and Blood Heat modes. These modes allow players to regenerate a portion of their lifebar, as well as allow access to their character's ultimate attacks, known as Arc-Drives and Last Arcs. All of these techniques consume Magic Circuit, which is accumulated by attacking your opponent, and to a lesser degree, successfully defending against your opponent. Magic Circuit carries over between rounds. Magic Circuit is also required for the Circuit Spark technique.<br/><br/>Clashing: An offensive state where certain attacks or maneuvers impact directly with an opponent's attack, thus resulting in a 'clash.' No damage is taken as a result, and both players are allowed to cancel their attacks as if they had connected successfully.<br/><br/>Aerial Recovery: A defensive measure used after being attacked in mid-air by pressing any button and, optionally, while holding a direction. It grants temporarily invulnerability to the player and allows them to resume action, but may be detrimental in certain circumstances if the attacking player predicts which direction the Aerial Recovery is performed.<br/><br/>Tactical Recovery: After being attacked, performed by pressing any upward direction upon impacting the floor. Doing so allows a player to quickly regain momentum and avoid 'OTG'(On The Ground) combos while utterly defenseless. However, players are not allowed to block during the recovery animation, and thus will expose themselves to punishment if the attacking player predicts the recovery attempt. This is an aspect of the Okizeme meta-game found in many fighting games.<br/><br/>Shield Bunker Canceling: More akin to a glitch than an actual feature, Shield Bunker Canceling (known as Baka Cancel in Japan and Bara Cancel in the US) is a powerful technique where a player, while blocking an attack, can counter-attack with a Shield Bunker, but cancels the beginning animation into an attack of their choice. This is typically an EX Attack with invincibility properties. This can drastically affect how one attacks an opponent. There are several methods to counter this technique, but it remains a feature of high-level play in Melty Blood. As proof that this accidental technique was accepted by the game's designers, this technique was altered to incur an additional 50% Magic Circuit cost to balance out its effectiveness in Version B. As of Melty Blood Actress Again the &quot;Bara Cancel&quot; technique is no longer possible.<br/><br/>Circuit Spark: Used during MAX mode only, a Circuit Spark allows a player, who is either blocking an attack or suffering damage, to 'break out' of the attack with an unblockable, invincible 'aura' that sacrifices all available Magic Circuit. This can only be performed if the character is standing or crouching; if the character is airborne or lying down, this technique is unavailable. In Melty Blood Actress Again it is possible to circuit spark in the air with all three styles.<br/><br/>Reverse Beat: A feature of Melty Blood not found in many other games is the ability to cancel attacks with large amounts of recovery into fast jab attacks, thus negating the disadvantage of using heavy slow attacks against a blocking opponent, however there's an adverse effect of damage decreasing in Reverse Beat combos. This features extremely heavily in high-level play for most of the characters.<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;Melty Blood&quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "120236": {"statistics": {}, "name": "Melty Blood: Actress Again", "videogamemode": {"2149": "Single-Player"}, "videogameversion": {"153300": "Japanese PlayStation 2 edition"}, "average": "0", "videogameseries": {"17559": "Melty Blood"}, "videogametheme": {"2265": "Horror"}, "usersrated": "0", "videogamegenre": {"2159": "Fighting"}, "videogameplatform": {"4434": "PlayStation 2"}, "poll": {}, "description": "Melty Blood: Actress Again, is the third game in the Melty Blood fighting game series. Compared to the second game in the series, Act Cadenza, this game features three entirely new playable characters, as well as several new alternate versions of existing characters in the PS2 version. All characters now feature three different fighting styles known as Full Moon Style, Crescent Moon Style (most similar to Act Cadenza) and Half Moon Style, which changes not only the way in which life and Magic Circuit meters function but also each characters' basic and special attacks. Actress Again was first announced in the December 2007 issue of Arcadia, a Japanese consumer arcade game magazine published by Enterbrain; most available information to date is derived from translations of the article in this issue.   Additional new artwork and a description of the three styles were introduced in the January 2008 issue of Tougeki Damashii magazine. Also in early 2008, Ecole launched the official Actress Again website. Actress Again has been ported to the PS2 as of August 20 of 2009.<br/><br/>Melty Blood Actress Again Current Code is presumed to be an arcade port of the PS2 version. The game underwent location testing in Akihabara from December 19&ndash;20, 2009.

The new changes also added Ryougi Shiki as an official playable character (she was a hidden secret unplayable boss in the original Actress Again[citation needed]) with her own Story Mode and a fixed up moveset.<br/><br/>A final upgrade for Melty Blood Actress Again Current Code was launched in 14 October 2011, named Melty Blood Actress Again Current Code Ver. 1.07. It includes a complete version of Arche-Type Earth (princess version of Arcueid Brunestud) with new sprites and moves for her and also her own Story Mode and ending. Also added were Story Modes and endings for the Neco &amp; Mech and Kohaku &amp; Mech teams. Riesbyfe Stridberg (as happened with Neco-Arc in the Playstation 2 version of Melty Blood Actress Again) can gain a new route in Story Mode, showing her as living her new life with Sion Eltnam Atlasia and Satsuki Yumizuka as a member of the Back-Alley Alliance (after the endings of Sion and Satsuki).<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;Melty Blood&quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "120237": {"statistics": {}, "name": "Men in Black II: Alien Escape", "videogamemode": {"2422": "Local Multiplayer"}, "videogameversion": {"153306": "English/European PlayStation 2 edition"}, "average": "3", "videogametheme": {"2350": "Movie, Book, TV show"}, "usersrated": "1", "videogamegenre": {"2161": "Action Adventure"}, "videogameplatform": {"4434": "PlayStation 2"}, "poll": {}, "description": "Men in Black II: Alien Escape is partially based on the Men in Black II movie.<br/><br/>In MiB II: Alien Escape players take the role of one of the MiB agents Agent K or Agent J, and are required to stop aliens from blowing up the earth with a ship based weapon called the Class 7 Ozone Demogrifier.<br/><br/>Once the game is started, an intro is played.

This MS team was created by Kycilia Zabi and participated in the capture of the California Base during the 2nd Earth Invasion Plan.<br/><br/>You take command of Midnight Fenrir Corps in the game. Eventually, by completing missions, more pilots will join in the Fenrir Corps' long and hard fought struggle.  It is the first Gundam based PlayStation 2 game that lets the player operate solely as Zeon forces.<br/><br/>The campaign starts with early raids on Federation territories in North America and covers many of the events occurred in the One Year War, such as the death of Garma Zabi. Eventually Federation manages to develop and field Mobile Suits in combat which tips the balance of power to their favor. The Midnight Fenrir team joins many historical battles such as the Battle of Seattle, where Garma Zabi died and the Invasion of Jaburo, with Agar stalking them in almost every step. Eventually, even Midnight Fenrir's skills are not enough to save the war effort: Zeon eventually evacuates their forces in Earth to fight in space. The Midnight Fenrir team decide to leave last and cover the retreating forces. However, when the last operational HLV (Space Shuttle) is lost, they eventually join up with remnant Zeon forces in Australia. Their last battle was in Australian deserts trying to save a stranded allied unit from Federation assault. It is not confirmed whether or not they are survived the war. Some speculate that they either managed to return to Side 3, or stayed on Earth and eventually helped Anavel Gato and the Delaz Fleet in Mobile Suit Gundam 0083: Stardust Memory.<br/><br/>Mobile suits list:<br/><br/>MS-05B Zaku I - An early mainstay mass produced mobile suit. Varying on the pilot it is upgraded for better suiting the pilot.<br/><br/>MS-06F Zaku II - A mainstay mass produced mobile suit. Depending on the pilot, it is either replaced by J-types or upgraded or both.<br/><br/>MS-07B Gouf - A unit that was originally developed for close combat but is later replaced by the MS-07B-3 Gouf Custom. The Gouf is originally used in a recon mission to find the Trojan Horse, one of the EFSF's V-Project ships.<br/><br/>MS-07B-3 Gouf Custom - An improved version of the Gouf. Given a sort of mid to long range weapons in place of the 5x75mm machine gun fingers, such as the 120mm Assault rifle and leader for certain pilots the 90mm Assault rifle as well as the new Zaku machine guns and an arm attached 3x35mm gatling guns.<br/><br/>MS-09 Dom - An agile heavy assault mobile suit that was mass produced to replace the Gouf and its predecessor, the Zaku II. It is armed for frontal assault with an array of bazookas and missile launchers but it is also well suited for hand to hand combat due to its extreme agility and heat saber.<br/><br/>MS-09F/trop Dom Tropen - Similar to the MS-09 Dom the Dom Tropen was developed for tropical and desert climates having additional filters and intakes to prevent corrosion in the internal parts. Its armor and shape has been altered to be more streamlined and to withstand more damage, as well as to hold more equipment. The unit given to the Midnight Fenrir Corp and is a Kinbareid force type Dom meant for the desert in the final mission in the sahara.<br/><br/>MS-09 Dom Funf - A Dom MP similar to the Tropen but without the extra filters, it is painted green.

A direct sequel called Vib-Ripple was released in 2004. The releases are comparable to the releases of the earlier PaRappa series (also a Matsuura series) where the original was followed by a pseudo-sequel and then a direct sequel a few years later.<br/><br/>Whereas in Vib-Ribbon the gameplay centered around the player's interaction with the melody of the song being played, in Mojib-Ribbon the gameplay centers on the player's interaction with the lyrics. As such, the music employed in the game is heavily lyrics-oriented rap music. The game's art-style is centered on traditional sumi-e and Japanese kana calligraphy.  This has led to claims that the game is incomprehensible to non-Japanese audiences, however the simplicity of gameplay have allowed numerous import gamers (typically also fans of Masaya Matsuura's oeuvre) to enjoy the game as well, and guides exist online regarding menu navigation instructions for non-Japanese speakers.<br/><br/>In Mojib-Ribbon, the player plays the part of Mojibri (\u30e2\u30b8\u30d6\u30ea Mojiburi) (a name similar to that of Vibri from Vib-Ribbon), a character drawn in the sumi-e style who wishes to become a famous rapper (similar to PaRappa the Rapper) and to find the truest rap of them all. In each level, Mojibri walks around a circle of clouds as rap lyrics written in kana pass underneath. The player must press up on the joystick to get Mojibri to dip his fude in the suzuri and then down to get Mojibri to write the kana as he sings it. The songs are heavily rhythm-based raps, and the player must time the application of the fude to the washi during lyrics and to the suzuri during breaks.<br/><br/>Later in the game Mojibri is joined by a female friend named Mojiko (\u30e2\u30b8\u30b3) and a huge robot called Osorezan 1999 (\u30aa\u30bd\u30ec\u30b6\u30f3\u4e00\u4e5d\u4e5d\u4e5d Osorezan ichiky\u016bky\u016bky\u016b).

The Presidential is an entertaining and educational family game -- fun for both students (13+) and adults.  You may not know how the Electoral College works, but you'll enjoy the excitement of playing for the most powerful job in the world!<br/><br/>The Play of the Game<br/><br/>The 2 teams decide which side will be the Republicans and which side will be the Democrats.  The Republicans take the 150 red votes (chips) and the 3 red dice.  The Democrats take the 150 blue votes (chips) and the 3 blue dice. The teams then decide how much time there is until election day by selecting a number of weeks until the election.  One each turn, each team must decide whether they will go Fundraising or Campaigning.<br/><br/>Fundraising<br/>There are 4 states where a candidate can fund raise (California, New York, Florida and Texas).  The team decides which state they would like to fund raise in and then rolls 2 dice.<br/><br/>If a team rolls a 9, they have 9 votes to distribute.  At least 1/2 the votes must stay in the fundraising state.<br/><br/>The team then draws a Politics Card, follows the instructions, and returns the card face-down to the bottom of the deck.  The Politics Cards offer many rewards and a few penalties to the teams.  They are similar to rolling another die.<br/><br/>Politics Cards<br/>Here are a few examples of the Politics Cards:<br/><br/>     Silicon Valley tycoons host a successful fundraiser for you. Add 6 votes to California.<br/>     You receive a 100% approval rating from the NRA.  Win 5 votes in Texas.<br/>     A popular blogger unveils pictures of your opponent&rsquo;s wife buying a brand new Bentley.  Add 3 votes to Michigan.<br/>     You are spotted wearing a Red Sox hat while prepping for a debate.  Your opponent adds 3 votes to New York.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Campaigning<br/>If a team chooses to campaign, the team selects and announces the 3 states they will campaign in on that turn.  Each state may only be visited once each turn.  The team then rolls 3 dice.  The team then decides which die corresponds to each state and contributes those votes to that state.<br/><br/>Votes<br/>Each chip equals 1 vote.   Votes are gained through the roll of the dice and the Politics Cards.  At any one time, each state is Republican (Red), Democrat (Blue) or neutral.   The votes in a state represent the net amount of chips that have been allocated by both parties.<br/><br/>End of the Game <br/>When time is up (the number of weeks that was selected have passed), there may be several states that are undecided (still neutral) either because they are in a tie or no team has campaigned in them or allocated them fund raising money.  At that point, a neutral state is selected and each team rolls a die.  The highest die wins the state and the electoral votes go to that team.  If there is a tie roll, the teams roll again.  The team with the highest number of electoral votes after all the neutral states have been awarded to either team wins the game.<br/><br/>"}, "120255": {"statistics": {}, "name": "The Mummy: Tomb of the Dragon Emperor", "videogamemode": {"2422": "Local Multiplayer"}, "videogameversion": {"153359": "North American PlayStation 2 edition"}, "average": "4", "videogametheme": {"2350": "Movie, Book, TV show"}, "usersrated": "1", "videogamegenre": {"2161": "Action Adventure"}, "videogameplatform": {"4434": "PlayStation 2"}, "poll": {}, "description": "The Mummy: Tomb of the Dragon Emperor is a third-person action-adventure video game adaption of film of the same name.<br/><br/>The game follows the same plot as the film.

Randy Johnson and Miguel Tejada were the cover players.<br/><br/>Introducing an innovative pitch meter and zone-based hitting system, MVP 2003 was well-received by critics, most of whom considered the game's overhaul to be a major improvement over Triple Play&prime;s last entry.<br/><br/>Upon its release in 2003, one of the game's most inventive aspects was its pitch/throw meter. Until then, most baseball games' pitching schemes required players simply to press the button corresponding to the pitch they wanted to throw, and hold the button down for a certain length of time to determine how hard the pitch was thrown. In MVP Baseball, the player first holds down the pitch button (or throw button) to judge the power; once the desired power level is attained, the player must release the button and attempt to tap the same button within a target area. The closer the player gets to the target area, the more accurate the pitch or throw will be. While innovative within the field of baseball games, EA in fact adapted this feature from golf games, which often feature a moving meter to determine the power and accuracy of shots (ironically, golf games largely abandoned shot meters around the time that MVP Baseball introduced it).<br/><br/>The game also incorporated a strike zone divided into nine areas of the plate designed as &quot;hot and cold zones&quot;. The feature uses color coding with the colors red, white, and blue to represent the player's ability to hit pitches in the given area; red, white, and blue indicate whether the player hits well, neutrally, or poorly, respectively, in the given segment of the strike zone.<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;MVP Baseball 2003&quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "120258": {"rpgitemversion": {"153364": "Softcover Version"}, "poll": {}, "name": "Kandra", "rpgproducer": {"5403": "Klas Berndal"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1234195.jpg", "usersrated": "2", "rpgsetting": {"1925": "Ereb Altor"}, "average": "8", "statistics": {}, "rpg": {"1909": "Drakar och Demoner (Expert, 4th & Chronopia 5th Editions)"}, "rpgcategory": {"2084": "Scenario / Adventure / Module"}, "rpggenre": {"155": "Fantasy (High Fantasy)"}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1234195_t.jpg", "description": "Back of the book (in Swedish):<br/><br/>Bes&ouml;k KANDRA &mdash; en myllrande handelsstad som en g&aring;ng i historien endast var en simpel marknadsplats.

Yet with Magnimar's explosive growth over the last century, life in the City of Monuments has become an adventure in and of itself. With strange monsters lurking amid the ancient ruins that form the city's foundation, roving bands of thieves and smugglers and murderers battling for control over the city's alleys, and the increasingly decadent attitudes of its oldest families, Magnimar lies at a crossroads. Will it succeed despite the obstacles thrown in its path, or is the City of Monuments doomed to crumble under the pressure of its own runaway success?<br/><br/>This 64-page softcover book explores the city of Magnimar (first featured in the now classic Rise of the Runelords Adventure Path) in great detail. Each city district has its own unique flavor and role, and comes with pages of details on industries and institutions, leisure and markets, and politics and entertainment. Dozens of shops, taverns, guildhalls, and more await discovery, many of which are presented with additional adventure hooks, memorable NPCs, and inspirational bits of lore. Examinations of regions ripe for adventuring or sinister groups worthy of defeat, along with a robust bestiary featuring commonly encountered NPCs or monsters closely associated with the City of Monuments completes this book, which will be an invaluable addition to the Shattered Star Adventure Path.<br/><br/>"}, "120301": {"rpg": {"1627": "Pathfinder Roleplaying Game"}, "poll": {}, "name": "Murder's Mark", "rpgitemversion": {"153507": "PDF Version"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1467259.jpg", "usersrated": "5", "rpgsetting": {"1897": "Golarion"}, "rpgproducer": {"16598": "Sarah Robinson"}, "statistics": {}, "rpggenre": {"155": "Fantasy (High Fantasy)"}, "average": "7.6", "rpgcategory": {"2084": "Scenario / Adventure / Module"}, "rpgseries": {"2415": "Pathfinder Modules"}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1467259_t.jpg", "description": "Publisher's blurb:<br/><br/>The circus has come to town!

Further experimentation with creatures both living and dead quickly caused the Isle to become overrun with his Zombi monstrosities. Many tried to escape the Isle and others barricaded themselves in their cellars hoping to ride out the storm, while a few brave heroes did what they could to end the madness. Most didn&rsquo;t make it. Professor Mortimus Philbin, Dr. Zycheck&rsquo;s former assistant, rose to challenge The Creator with his self-made army of Exterminators, designed to do battle with Dr. Z&rsquo;s minions.

Zombis began to mutate and hordes of the undead were being driven by powerful new masters. The heroes fought valiantly to save the Isle, but the virus-fueled undead seemed impossible to overcome. The Virus had infected the Heroes as well, however, empowering them to perform amazing feats that could be used to stop the onslaught. But rather than using their new found abilities to save the Isle, they began to work against each other in a desperate struggle for self-preservation.<br/><br/>The Creator stood to reign triumphant as the Isle swiftly fell into the hands of the dead, but the Brood Mother emerged from a vile cesspool of the darkest Virus. A creature with an insatiable appetite for both the living and the dead, she began to even the odds.

It is known as G Sonic in Japan. It was released in December 1996 for both North American and European markets. A Japanese release followed later that year on December 13, being the last commercial title released for the system.[1]<br/><br/>The game was also ported to the Sega Master System in Brazil by TecToy and released in December 1997.<br/><br/>Sonic Blast was later compiled with other Sonic titles in Sonic Adventure DX and Sonic Mega Collection Plus, and a demo of its ending can be unlocked in Sonic Gems Collection.<br/><br/>While this game was released at the end of 1996 in conjunction with the similarly named Sonic 3D Blast, the games have little in common. No enemies, levels, or bosses are shared between them. The story is also completely different; Sonic and Knuckles join together to collect five of the Chaos Emeralds and confront Eggman at Silver Castle.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Unlike its pseudo-3D counterpart, Sonic Blast for Game Gear was a side-scrolling run and jump platform game. It was the last new Sonic the Hedgehog game released for the Sega handheld, and sported some of the most advanced features of the 8-bit series (although it was not very well received).<br/><br/>The two playable characters in the game are Sonic the Hedgehog and Knuckles the Echidna. The object of the game is to collect five Chaos Emeralds, in stages visually similar to the Sonic the Hedgehog 3 special stages, but instead require Sonic and Knuckles to collect rings as in Sonic the Hedgehog 2's special stages. Emeralds can only be obtained in the second act of each level. Finishing a special stage in the first act will gain the player an extra life instead. Similar to Sonic 3, special stages are entered through large rings hidden in the regular stages.<br/><br/>Much like Sonic Triple Trouble, when the player is hit by an enemy, he only loses some of his rings as opposed to all of them (in this game, 10 rings per hit). Sonic's maneuvers are similar to those in other games, but he has a special double-jump ability that allows him to reach greater heights, like with the electric shield in Sonic 3. Knuckles's abilities are his standard climbing and gliding, as seen in Sonic and Knuckles.&quot;<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;Sonic Blast&quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "120339": {"boardgamedesigner": {"3": {"name": "(Uncredited)"}}, "poll": {}, "name": "Wou\u00e9go: Le Quiz Musical", "playingtime": "30", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": {"2019": "Partnerships"}, "yearpublished": "2004", "usersrated": "0", "boardgamefamily": {"7475": "CD Board Games"}, "maxplayers": "0", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1517137_t.jpg", "average": "0", "statistics": {}, "boardgamepublisher": {"5639": {"name": "Lansay"}}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1517137.jpg", "boardgameversion": {"153624": "Lansay Edition 2004"}, "maxplaytime": "30", "boardgamecategory": {"1002": {"name": "Card Game"}}, "age": "12", "minplaytime": "30", "description": "Wou&eacute;go is a music quiz, which means that players must recognize musical excerpts.<br/><br/>The game features three CDs containing 99 tracks of original music clips and 600 questions on the cards.<br/>The goal of the game is to find who sings and answer questions.<br/><br/>The game can be played as a team.<br/><br/>"}, "120340": {"boardgamedesigner": {"3": {"name": "(Uncredited)"}}, "poll": {}, "name": "Tiens Bon Spider-Man", "playingtime": "0", "minplayers": "2", "yearpublished": "2009", "usersrated": "0", "boardgamefamily": {"5607": "3D Games"}, "maxplayers": "2", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1940008_t.png", "average": "0", "statistics": {}, "boardgamepublisher": {"5639": {"name": "Lansay"}}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1940008.png", "boardgameversion": {"153626": "Lansay Edition 2009"}, "maxplaytime": "0", "boardgamecategory": {"1032": {"name": "Action / Dexterity"}}, "age": "4", "minplaytime": "0", "description": "Similar to Knockout but withou dice.<br/>In order to win: do not let Spider-Man down!<br/>Each player equips an arm and knocked down Venom, and in his turn push one brick out from the wall.<br/>The more skillful player wins.<br/><br/>"}, "120343": {"statistics": {}, "name": "Quarrel", "videogamemode": {"2310": "Network Multiplayer"}, "videogameversion": {"153633": "iPhone/iPad edition"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1462923.png", "videogametheme": {"2337": "Cute Fantasy"}, "usersrated": "2", "average": "8.625", "videogamegenre": {"2153": "Educational"}, "videogameplatform": {"6826": "iPad"}, "videogamehonor": {"32826": "2012 British Academy Game Awards Best Handheld/Mobile Game of the Year Nominee"}, "poll": {}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1462923_t.png", "description": "Quarrel is a video game developed by Denki and published by UTV Ignition Entertainment.

The variability of map shapes makes every game a new challenge.<br/><br/>Each player takes a matching set of army tokens and fortress tokens; an army token covers four empty hexes in a row (1x4). Players are trying to capture neutral fortresses, and they do so if the fortress is in an area of zero or more empty hexes that is surrounded by army tokens, the edge of the grid, or both and if no armies can fit into this area. When this happens, the capturing player replaces the neutral fortress with one of his own color.<br/><br/>On a player's turn, if the player's opponent did not capture a fortress on his previous turn and it is possible to play an army adjacent to the opponent's previously placed army, then the moving player must do so. Otherwise, the active player can play an army token anywhere on the map. (A swap rule applies after the first turn; when swapping, all tokens played by the first player on his first turn are replaced by the second player's tokens.)<br/><br/>The player who captures more than half of the fortresses on the map wins.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": {"153743": "English first edition"}, "average": "7.54444", "name": "Siege Master", "playingtime": "20", "boardgamemechanic": {"2043": "Area Enclosure"}, "age": "10", "usersrated": "9", "boardgamesubdomain": {"4666": "Abstract Games"}, "boardgamefamily": {"26432": "Combinatorial"}}, "120399": {"rpgitemversion": {"153758": "ePUB"}, "statistics": {}, "name": "Barsoom!

It's played on the intersections (points) of an odd-sized, initially empty square board. Both players must have access to a sufficient number of stones colored black on one side and white on the other.<br/><br/>The goal of the game is having the most stones on the board when both players have passed. Loose features surround capture, like Go, but surrounded stones are flipped instead of removed, and a natural, game-defining mechanism is used to favour (rather than ensure) eye creation upon captures. Since no stones are ever removed from the board, cycles are not possible.<br/><br/><br/>Definitions<br/><br/>In this rules, adjacent always means orthogonally adjacent.<br/><br/>A group is a set of like-colored, adjacent stones.<br/><br/>A liberty is an empty point adjacent to a group. A false liberty is an empty point which is adjacent to at least one stone of each color and no empty points. Liberties which are not false are true.<br/><br/><br/>Play<br/><br/>Starting with Black, the players take turns placing stones with their color showing on empty points of the board, one stone per turn.<br/><br/>After a placement, all enemy groups with no true liberties are flipped, i.e. all the stones in them are turned round to show the player's color, after which the turn ends.<br/><br/>At the end of a turn, every group on the board must have at least one true liberty. Otherwise, the move is illegal and the player must choose another one.<br/><br/>Players can pass their turn at any moment. When both players pass in succession, the game ends, and the one with the highest score wins.<br/><br/>A player's score is the number of stones with his color showing that there are on the board, plus a komi (see below) in the case of White. In the event of a tie, whoever made the last move loses.<br/><br/><br/>Komi<br/><br/>The komi is the even number of points which are added to White's score at the end of the game as a compensation for playing second. Before the game starts, the first player tells his opponent the even number which will be used as komi, and then the second player chooses which color to play.<br/><br/><br/>Author's notes<br/><br/>A very interesting, non-obvious feature of Loose is that, assuming that players will only pass their turn when there are no more useful moves available, the game will never end in a tie. In Go, ties can occur if there is an odd number of empty points in seki, but seki patterns in Loose always involve an even number of them. The tie-break rule is just included to make the game theoretically drawless, rather than just in practice.<br/><br/>"}, "120474": {"statistics": {}, "name": "Evasive Action", "videogamemode": {"2422": "Local Multiplayer"}, "videogameversion": {"153943": "North American DOS edition"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1241837.png", "videogametheme": {"2264": "Science Fiction"}, "usersrated": "0", "average": "0", "videogamegenre": {"2147": "Action"}, "videogameplatform": {"4714": "DOS"}, "poll": {}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1241837_t.png", "description": "Back of Box<br/><br/>Head-to-head dogfights through four World Wars!<br/><br/>You walk onto the tarmac, weighing your options carefully...the bi-plane with its open cockpit where enemy's bullets mix with the rushing air in your face; or the life-sucking thrust of the heavily-armed fighter jet?
