For many years, the lizardfolk prospered under the strong leadership of the Lizard Laird.  However, many years ago, the kingdom fell into decline as the Lizard Laird of the kingdom of Saralan Smasah disappeared and access to the kingdom of Saralan Smasah was closed.<br/><br/>Over time, rumors have grown up about the fabled wealth of the kingdom and a horrible plague that brought it down.  The adventure begins with the party held captive by the lizardfolk.  Tsoraz Tsoraz, the tribal shaman visits with the adventurers and informs them that they have trespassed upon the borders of the lizardfolk.  The tribe is willing to release them and forgive the party&rsquo;s trespass if they will perform a task on behalf of the tribe.  Tsoraz Tsoraz believes that he has found one of the entrances to the upper halls of the great kingdom of Saralan Smasah &ndash; the Upper Halls of the Sun and Stars.  If the party can recover the Scale Heart, one of the Lizard Laird&rsquo;s badges of office believed to have been part of the treasury at this site; then the party will have earned the gratitude of the tribe and be free to go.  If not, then they may well find themselves invited to dinner &ndash; as part of the menu!<br/><br/>"}, "171066": {"statistics": {}, "name": "The ORPHEUS Ruse", "videogamemode": {"2149": "Single-Player"}, "videogameversion": {"262669": "IOS Downloadable Edition"}, "average": "0", "videogametheme": {"2283": "Spy / Espionage"}, "usersrated": "0", "videogamegenre": {"2168": "Text Adventure"}, "videogameplatform": {"6826": "iPad"}, "poll": {}, "description": "Infiltrate the enemy as a psychic spy, leaping from body to body by touch!

Legend says that the island is full of treasure, including the famous Golden Pineapple, but it also says that treasure is fiercely guarded by hordes of fearsome penguin warriors, some of which ride giant polar bears. That potential danger is why you're alone in your boat, on your own but eager to take a run on the island and try your luck.<br/><br/>For now, only the sound of the waves and the cries of the gulls disturb the peace of this seemingly idyllic island...but as soon as you set foot in the jungle bordering the beach, the drums of war start sounding and you realize that you've suddenly gained the status of prey!<br/><br/>Pingo Pingo is a hyper-frenetic action game punctuated by a soundtrack in which you have to react quickly, run, shoot a gun, in which you must be precise, brave, fast, and focused because if not, well, you might not leave the island in one piece. As soon as the soundtrack begins, the game is on!<br/><br/>On your turn, reveal the top card from your deck and place it face-up in the middle of the table. Each card requires a specific action when it is revealed. Be the first to tap on a treasure to grab it, but watch out for traps and critters, and make sure the music allows you to take this treasure. Tap on camp cards to steal cards from the other players' stashes. Adventure cards trigger actions to be completed before the &quot;Pingo Pingo&quot; cry in the soundtrack. Get up and run from one base to another to cross a suspension bridge. Grab the gun and aim well to defeat fearsome bear riders. Tap the friendly monkey sorcerer to regain life. Run to the shipwreck and back to shoot the gigantic space penguin. Grab all the previously played cards and deal them as fast as you can to escape the penguin rampage!<br/><br/>Any mistake will cost you one of your seven life points. After 15 minutes, the player with the most treasures wins the game &mdash; but don't be reckless because you can't carry more than three treasures per life point...<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": {"264751": "English first edition"}, "age": "6", "name": "Pingo Pingo", "playingtime": "15", "average": "6.45544", "usersrated": "213", "boardgamefamily": {"7475": "CD Board Games"}}, "171137": {"statistics": {}, "name": "Island Light", "videogamemode": {"2149": "Single-Player"}, "videogameversion": {"262799": "Windows Downloadable edition"}, "average": "0", "videogametheme": {"2265": "Horror"}, "usersrated": "0", "videogamegenre": {"2167": "Shooter"}, "videogameplatform": {"4977": "Windows"}, "poll": {}, "description": "User Summary<br/><br/>Island Light was a survival horror game with zombies.

The game was invented by Allan Goff of Novatia Labs.<br/><br/>Quantum tic-tac-toe captures the three quantum phenomena discussed above by modifying one basic rule of classical tic-tac-toe: the number of marks allowed in each square. Additional rules specify when and how a set of marks &quot;collapses&quot; into classical moves.<br/><br/>On each move, the current player marks two squares with their letter (X or O), instead of one, and each letter (X or O) is subscripted with the number of the move (beginning counting with 1). The pair of marks are called spooky marks. (Because X always moves first, the subscripts on X are always odd and the subscripts on O are always even.)<br/><br/>For example, player 1's first move might be to place &quot;X1&quot; in both the upper left and lower right squares. The two squares thus marked are called entangled. During the game, there may be as many as eight spooky marks in a single square (if the square is entangled with all eight other squares).<br/><br/>The phenomenon of collapse is captured by specifying that a &quot;cyclic entanglement&quot; causes a &quot;measurement&quot;. A cyclic entanglement is a cycle in the entanglement graph; for example, if<br/><br/>square 1 is entangled via move X1 with square 4, and<br/>square 4 is entangled via move X3 with square 8, and<br/>square 8 is in turn entangled via move O4 with square 1,<br/>then these three squares form a cyclic entanglement. At the end of the turn on which the cyclic entanglement was created, the player whose turn it is not &mdash; that is, the player who did not create the cycle &mdash; chooses one of two ways to &quot;measure&quot; the cycle and thus cause all the entangled squares to &quot;collapse&quot; into classical tic-tac-toe moves. In the preceding example, since player 2 created the cycle, player 1 decides how to &quot;measure&quot; it. Player 1's two options are:<br/><br/>X1 collapses into square 1. This forces O4 to collapse into square 8 and X3 to collapse into square 4.<br/>X1 collapses into square 4. This forces X3 to collapse into square 8 and O4 to collapse into square 1.<br/>Any other chains of entanglements hanging off the cycle would also collapse at this time; for example, if square 1 were also entangled via O2 with square 5, then either measurement above would force O2 to collapse into square 5. (Note that it is impossible for two or more cyclic entanglements to be created in a single turn.)<br/><br/>When a move collapses into a single square, that square is permanently marked (in larger print) with the letter and subscript of the collapsed move &mdash; a classical mark. A square containing a classical mark is fixed for the rest of the game; no more spooky marks may be placed in it.<br/><br/>The first player to achieve a tic-tac-toe (three in a row horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) consisting entirely of classical marks is declared the winner. Since it is possible for a single measurement to collapse the entire board and give classical tic-tac-toes to both players simultaneously, the rules declare that the player whose tic-tac-toe has the lower maximum subscript earns one point, and the player whose tic-tac-toe has the higher maximum subscript earns only one-half point.<br/><br/>"}, "171145": {"statistics": {}, "name": "Murder Miners", "videogamemode": {"2313": "Cooperative"}, "videogameversion": {"262817": "Windows Downloadable edition"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3119126.jpg", "videogametheme": {"2659": "Zombies"}, "usersrated": "0", "average": "0", "videogamegenre": {"2167": "Shooter"}, "videogameplatform": {"4977": "Windows"}, "poll": {}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3119126_t.jpg", "description": "User Summary<br/><br/>Murder Miners is a typical survival shooter game with zombies.

This card is intended to be used as a more fun, thematic, and prowess-showing way of determining the start player.<br/><br/>Setup<br/>The illustration on the card depicts blocks with and without numbers. The non-numbered blocks are the basic setup, but by adding the numbered gray blocks, you can increase the difficulty to level 2 or 3 (this is clearly depicted on the back of the card).<br/><br/>Play<br/><br/>     First, all players simultaneously bid by showing fingers from their fist equal to the skill level each thinks she can complete.

Just consider the possibilities available to the practitioner of magic. Imagine poker with spells! No person could resist such temptation, and even a casual review of history will prove that none could.<br/><br/><br/>    The famous last play of Ephippus of Athens? It was about Circe&rsquo;s never ending thirst for cheating at cards. <br/>    Morgan le Fay and Merlin regularly crossed wits over a deck. <br/>    Roger Bollingbroke&rsquo;s most heinous crime was the transparently bogus run of five straight flushes in a row. <br/><br/><br/>And so it has gone. The application of magic to card games is as natural as mixing mandrake and worm&rsquo;s husk.<br/><br/>For the first time, however, the rules for a game specifically created for wizards have been pieced together from fragments found in tombs, dusty used bookstores, and in the classified ads of one small newspaper. Though magic has largely been forgotten in the centuries since this game was invented, modern game design has given us a way to imitate the arcana outlined in the reconstructed rules. The result is a &ldquo;no-magic-required&rdquo; whimsical romp for 2-5 players.<br/><br/>Hocus places the players in the flamboyant boots of wizards, using their powerful advantages to create opportunities, manipulate the game, and alter the flow of cards. Wizards hate being pinned down and live by the mantra &ldquo;You shall not fold!&rdquo; Each turn, players choose one Spell to use. As you are new to Hocus, we shall first discuss the three Basic Spells.<br/><br/>Use the first basic Spell to play cards to the Community. Play thoughtfully, as everyone shares the cards in the Community! The second Spell is for building the Pot. In addition to Suit and Strength, every card has a point value. Cards played to the Pot contribute their points to the winner of each Showdown. Play cards to build a Pocket with the third Spell. (Never ask to see a wizard&rsquo;s pocket!) Each player takes one of their Pockets and combines it with the Community to form a hand during Showdowns. The best hand claims all points in the Pot.<br/><br/>There is, of course, a twist. Trust a wizard to provide a twist! There are multiple Communities, each with a Pot, and players can compete in multiple Showdowns if they have the Pockets. Hocus is not merely a matter of building good hands, but making a winning hand where your opponents least expect and profiting with a hefty Pot. Timing and careful, targeted play will win the day. And time is limited. You may have conjured a Straight Flush, but it&rsquo;s worthless with no points in the Pot!<br/><br/>Now, look at the other spells in the game. There are eight different spell books, each with their own unique approaches to the game, providing every wizard who plays with their own special abilities. The spell books raise the game to another level, with even more tools for bending luck to your advantage.<br/><br/>Travel way back to a dark, dank inn, shuffle the cards, and play the favorite game of the legendary Merlin and Morgan le Fay.

Everyone tries to find new ways to improve their lives, new means to grow their lands and new constructions that create an easier life. In Hoyuk: Anatolia, you must prove your quality through three different Achievements: build a Water Supply System for your village so the water can reach your land, throw the best Fest in the valley, and finally, build two Artifacts!<br/><br/>Each player chooses to complete two different Achievements at the beginning of the game. Each player who has managed to keep their Achievements intact until the end of the game will score additional Victory Points but most importantly each Achievement will score a different amount of points. The players use Drop counters in order to build the Water Supply System. Five Drop counters must be placed on five Houses of the same color and of the same Block. Furthermore these Houses must be connected to each other and at least one of them must be placed on the river or the lake of the game board. To place a Drop counter on a House, players must wait until the Construction phase and then choose not to build one of three Elements of their Construction board.<br/><br/>The Artifacts can be built easily but can be destroyed as easy as well because they are affected by all Catastrophes. Players can build an Artifact on the top of their Houses at the same way as the Drop Counters but in this case this House must be two stories high. If players do not complete this Achievement by the end of the game, they can still score Victory points. This is the only Achievement that has an advantage but it also gives less Victory Points.<br/><br/>This is an era where tribes search for a way to upgrade their social status, so they throw several Fests where they meet each other and celebrate. This is the last Achievement where players create the best Fest in the Valley by offering five different materials. These materials can be found on the Fest tokens but also on the Aspect cards. The Aspect cards have different images that must be matched with the Fest tokens. Once players have five Aspect cards that match with five Fest tokens, they discard them to score Victory points at the end of the game.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": {"263000": "English first edition"}, "average": "7.33304", "name": "Hoyuk: Anatolia", "playingtime": "90", "boardgamemechanic": {"2001": "Action Point Allowance System"}, "age": "10", "boardgameexpansion": {}, "usersrated": "23", "expands": {"24270": {"name": "Hoyuk"}}, "boardgamefamily": {"22184": "Admin: Unreleased Games"}}, "171272": {"rpgitemversion": {"263002": "PDF Version"}, "statistics": {}, "name": "Dungeon Blank and Numbered", "rpgproducer": {"79828": "Scott Tolle"}, "average": "0", "usersrated": "0", "rpg": {"356": "Generic / Universal"}, "rpgcategory": {"2086": "Accessory (dice, maps, screens, cards)"}, "poll": {}, "rpggenre": {"155": "Fantasy (High Fantasy)"}, "description": "User Summary<br/><br/>A collection of 10 dungeons map that have been created and pre-numbered for the time-crunched GM.

Each game is set to a ten-minute timer, and players must work together in that ten minutes to defuse all of the bombs.

They are stopped at the gates of Warsaw, where the insurgency that has just started will be ruthlessly suppressed.<br/><br/>But the Axis forces are not yet beaten and 10 months of fierce fighting will be necessary until the final victory.<br/><br/>Victory Roads is a historical simulation retracing the campaign on the Eastern Front, from June 22, 1944, the day of the launch of the offensive Bagration in Byelorussia, until May 1945 in Berlin.<br/><br/>Victory Roads uses the same game system as Liberty Roads, our wargame on the Western Front, from the D-Day to April 1945, while integrating the specific characteristics of this campaign. The counters are the divisions (Axis) and corps (Soviets) of both sides involved in the campaign.<br/><br/>The system focuses on the different structure of the two opposing armies. Supports represent the effects of various materiel, equipment, as well as specific battle events.<br/><br/>Players who are used to play with Liberty Roads should find Victory Roads very familiar.<br/><br/>The main difference the game offers relies in the way to handle the Soviet player&rsquo;s offensive.

The dealer deals half of the cards to each player. The cards are held face down. Every round, each player plays four cards face up vertically in between both players and slightly closer to themselves. Once both players have done this, they look for two or more cards having the same number. When a player finds one, he places another card on top of the cards with that number until all of the cards with the common number are covered. In other words if there are three fours out then all three cards can get a new card on top of it. If a four is played on top of a four it is called a double, and the player may place a third card on top of it. This requires that players pay attention to the cards they are laying down on the pile. If a player runs out of cards then that player wins. When there are no more groups of cards remaining, each player scoops up the four piles directly in front of him or her and places them face down on the bottom of his or her deck. That round ends and the next begins.<br/><br/>In some versions of the game, there is a move called &quot;spitting&quot; in which the player is allowed to spit on the other player to distract him/her.

Some people get it almost intuitively, some people have a hard time wrapping their heads around it. A lot of players love it, and some choose to ignore it. Part of the issue is that in game systems that are otherwise clearly defined, alignment has always been &ldquo;squishy&rdquo;. It is largely subjective, and has no rigor around it at all. That leads to confusion, arguments, and even flame wars.<br/><br/>The Forager's Guild Guide to the Nine Alignments sets out to address those issues by adding some simple yet flexible mechanics. Should your lawful good paladin really be doing that? Would you chaotic neutral rogue truly be able to resist the temptation to steal that shiny object she covets? Now there's a way for gamemasters to steer players toward following the morals and ethics of their alignment without straightjacketing their character development, pidgeonholing them into stereotypes, or railroading them into specific courses of action. And everyone can still have fun while doing it!<br/><br/>Based on the concept of Fate aspects, The Forager's Guild Guide to the Nine Alignments is a cap system that works with nearly any roleplaying game system.

My First Bohnanza has simplified beanometers, with four types of beans having only a single exchange value &mdash; e.g., five Gemeine (common) beans get you one Taler &mdash; and six types of beans having two exchange values. Games with the youngest players (or newcomers to the Bohnanza universe) should use the single beanometer cards with the other cards forming a Taler stack.<br/><br/>To play, each player gets five cards, which they lay in a face-up row, and a beanfield tile that shows spots for two types of beans. On a turn, a player must plant the first (leftmost) card in one of her fields and she can choose to plant a second. Players try to group cards of the same type in the same field, but they can cover beans of different types, if needed. The player then reveals two cards from the deck and either keeps them or trades them (and cards from her hand, if desired) for cards held by other players; all traded cards must be planted. To end her turn, the player draws three cards and adds them to her row.<br/><br/>As soon as a player has the proper number of bean cards in order in one of her fields, she harvests them, placing these cards in the discard pile and collecting a Taler from the stack. If those cards covered beans of another type, she can then start building on those beans again. After going through the deck 1-3 times (depending on the number of players), the game ends and whoever has the most Talers wins.<br/><br/>Once players have played My First Bohnanza a few times, you can swap the single beanometer cards for the double beanometer cards, which now gives players a choice of when to harvest. Subsequently, you can combine the two decks, which introduces the rule about using one of the bean cards to serve as the Taler (which adjusts the quantity of that type of bean in the deck). With additional plays, you can add in the remaining rules of Bohnanza, such as needing to harvest for no Talers when planting, paying for a third beanfield, keeping your cards in hand, and not being able to harvest a field with only one card.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "3", "boardgameversion": {"274149": "English first edition"}, "average": "6.59688", "name": "My First Bohnanza", "playingtime": "30", "boardgamemechanic": {"2040": "Hand Management"}, "age": "4", "usersrated": "64", "boardgamefamily": {"5": "Bohnanza"}}, "171420": {"poll": {}, "name": "Bizoo", "playingtime": "20", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": {"2040": "Hand Management"}, "yearpublished": "2014", "usersrated": "0", "maxplayers": "10", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3046989_t.jpg", "average": "0", "statistics": {}, "boardgamepublisher": {"861": {"name": "Bioviva"}}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3046989.jpg", "boardgameversion": {"263219": "Bioviva French edition 2014"}, "maxplaytime": "20", "boardgamecategory": {"1089": {"name": "Animals"}}, "age": "8", "minplaytime": "20", "description": "Bizoo consists 112 cards with different animals.<br/>The aim is to form the couples with the same type of animals to achieve the highest score at the end of the game.<br/><br/>Each player gets 8 cards at the beginning of the game and in his turn player may perform one of the 2 possible actions:<br/>a) form a couple and draw 2 new cards from the deck<br/>or<br/>b) activate an action of any of his cards.<br/>Each animal species have its own ability.<br/><br/>The game ends when a player:<br/><br/>    reaches the score of 45 points with couples;<br/>    or lays his last card on the table.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>The winner is the one that has the most points.<br/><br/>"}, "171422": {"boardgamedesigner": {"76566": {"name": "George Jaros"}}, "average": "4.5", "poll": {}, "name": "ChromaWerks", "playingtime": "15", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": {"2048": "Pattern Building"}, "yearpublished": "2014", "usersrated": "2", "maxplayers": "2", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2379965_t.png", "boardgameartist": {"76566": "George Jaros"}, "statistics": {}, "boardgamepublisher": {"4": {"name": "(Self-Published)"}}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2379965.png", "boardgameversion": {"263221": "PnP first edition"}, "maxplaytime": "15", "boardgamecategory": {"1009": {"name": "Abstract Strategy"}}, "age": "8", "minplaytime": "15", "description": "ChromaWerks was designed for the 18 Card Microgame Contest on BGG.<br/><br/>In ChromaWerks each player uses 9 double sided cards (shuffled) to make a 3x3 grid.

Components of the game are pawns, dice, money, credits, bitter cards, closing cards, and the board pieces. The general idea is that players go on gigs and accumulate a resume in the form of credits so that they eventually are qualified and ready to audition for their 'Big Break'. Booking this gig wins the game.<br/> Player take turns. Each turn has four phases. The first is an income phase, where players earn credits and/or money (except when in NYC, where they have to pay to live there). The second phase is an audition phase where they roll dice to see if they are cast in a gig. The third phase is a movement phase. The last phase the players either can play a 'bitter card' or they 'take class'. Playing a bitter card generally has a detrimental effect on another player. Taking class involves exchanging money and other resources to gain special advanced credits.<br/><br/>Bitter cards are generally earned by failing to book auditions. Closing cards are earned by completing professional gigs. Specialty Credits are required to audition for more advanced gigs, such as Cruise Line and Bus 'N Truck. A player must possess all three specialty credits (acting, vocal, and dance) and must have 15 total credits or more to audition for their 'Big Break'. If a player fails this audition, he/she loses an advanced credit, a generic credit, and gains two bitter cards. Play continues until somebody books their 'Big Break'.<br/><br/>A future expansion of My Big Break is planned which will contain the option to work for a Theme Park and a Dinner Theatre.

As the chief of your tribe, you must lead your people to prosperity through the cultivation and trade of cacao &mdash; and to do that, you'll need to put them to work in the best way possible.<br/><br/>In the game, each player has an individual deck of square worker tiles, with the number of workers on each side of the tile varying from tile to tile. The playing area starts with only a couple of jungle tiles in play: a cacao field and a small market; two jungle tiles are laid face up, and the remaining jungle tiles stacked as a draw pile.<br/><br/>On a player's turn, she places one of her worker tiles on the board adjacent to one or more jungle tiles already in play, then (if two worker tiles are next to an empty space) adds one of the jungle tiles to the playing area in this space. Her workers then get busy and deliver the results of their effort: If you placed workers next to a cacao field, you receive one or two cacao markers per worker; if they're next to a market, you can choose to sell one cacao marker per worker at the listed price; if next to a well, you receive water; if next to a temple, they stand and look good until the end of the game; and so on. She then refills her hand from her personal deck to three worker tiles.<br/><br/>Once all players have used all of their worker tiles, the game ends. Players score (or lose) points based on their water supply, and each temple rewards whichever players sent the most workers to it.
