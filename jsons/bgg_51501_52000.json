Here the Khans priests had paid homage to the demi-god of war. But in time of years their numbers dwindled and eventually the Temple fell into ruin. It stood unoccupied for ages until Yuggilv, the Crawling Queen, came to reside there, making the Temple a nightmarish prison. Unknown to the Queen, her prisons foundation were a Tombs ceiling. Over all these long years the Tomb of Kubla Khan, long ago sealed to prying eyes, lay forgotten, hidden beneath the Temples floors. But in time, a band of doughty adventurers managed to win their way into the Prison of Yuggilv. Through horrific struggles they came to her den and cast her and her foul minions to the abyss. Unbeknownst to them, they unearthed the hidden portals that led to the entrance of the Tombs themselves, far below the surface.<br/><br/>War in the Lands of the Dead<br/><br/>A horror lies within the Khans Tomb. Few who have entered have returned and those who have, gibber madness of dark places and strange, nightmarish creatures. They speak of insects the size of men who bare weapons and shields of iron. They babble of the priest of the dead and the war between the insects and his beasts of madness. But there are rumors too, rumors of a wealth beyond imaging. The old Khan hoarded mounds of gold and gems, artifacts and relics of power to hurry his passage to the divinity he ever sought in life and strove to achieve after his death. It is this hint of wealth that calls the intrepid adventurer to the Tomb of Kubla Khan.&quot;<br/><br/>This book is a special edition printing for the 2005 Kubla Con Game Convention.

It is in this place that the dread warlord has locked away those prisoners whom he desires to hold for ransom, and those foes who deserve the suffering his torturers would heap upon their flesh.<br/><br/>Unlike the hundreds of thousands of poor souls which Kubla Khan has left beheaded or impaled in the wake of his ultra-dimensional conquests, these prisoners hold some covetous power to the Monarch of War. Some would claim that their torture and ransom insure his space as Demigod of Battles. It is suspected that their ultimate sacrifice at the hands of his executioner priests will grant his ascension to the upper tier of deities where he promises his worshippers to be the true Harbinger of Armageddon. All that is required, it seems, is the capture and sacrifice of the recent plunderers of his ancient tomb.<br/><br/>Unfortunately for the Khan&rsquo;s great plans, a recent prisoner Ulsier has escaped his jailors and flung wide the prison doors. There is a great prison revolt is in progress which threatens to erupt into the upper reaches. Riots are common within the Dungeon of Kubla Khan, usually brutally subdued by the Khan&rsquo;s guardians. Menoshash the warden of the Dungeon of Kubla Khan, and Giarlock the Khan&rsquo;s loyal executioner have kept this escalating situation secret<br/>from their master for fear that they may find themselves interred with others who have disobeyed the Monarch of War.&quot;<br/><br/>"}, "51568": {"rpgdesigner": ["Greg Gorden"], "rpgitemversion": ["Box Set"], "statistics": [], "name": "Gamesmaster Pack", "rpgartist": ["James Talbot"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic527057.jpg", "usersrated": "17", "rpgsetting": ["James Bond"], "average": "6.79412", "rpgissuearticle": ["Good evening, Mr. Bond: The 007 role-playing system reviewed", "Open Box"], "rpggenre": ["Crime (Criminal / Law Enforcement)", "Crime (Spy / Espionage)"], "rpgpublisher": ["Descartes Editeur", "Victory Games (I)"], "rpg": ["James Bond 007"], "rpgcategory": ["Sourcebook (rules/options to enhance play)"], "poll": [], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic527057_t.jpg", "description": "From the back of the &quot;box&quot;:<br/><br/>&quot;Included in this package:<br/><br/><br/>     Full-color 11&quot; x 32&quot; Gamesmaster Screen<br/>     Pad of 40 Character Records<br/>     23 full-color sculpted character and vehicle figures with bases.<br/>     Gridsheet for movement and combat<br/><br/><br/>This James Bond 007 Role Playing Game supplement features a four-panel Gamesmaster Screen containing the major charts and tables used during an adventure.

The scenario was published on the Black Industries website.<br/><br/>From the Introduction:<br/><br/>(!SPOILERS!)<br/><br/>'The Burgher Heinz Haushalter is a respected merchant whose daughter (Etelka) is engaged to wed a minor local noble, Karl Volte. The marriage is favorable to both parties, as Volte is fairly impoverished and Haushalter is keenly interested in social climbing. However Haushalter has a rival, Burgermeister Gunthar Steinhoff, who would prefer the noble wed his own daughter. Although Steinhoff can offer a richer dowry than Haushalter, Haushalter has a distant claim to noble heritage that is very important to Volte. To the bankrupt noble it is vital to maintain the appearance that he is not marrying below his station. In public Steinhoff maintains a friendly mien so that, as yet, Haushalter is unaware of the depth of Steinhoff's animosity to him.<br/><br/>'Although Haushalter's noble heritage is commonly accepted history by many townsfolk, recent rumors (spread by Steinhoff's agents) have sprang up that it is untrue and the Haushalter family has been lying for years about this. Unfortunately Haushalter doesn't have any proof that his family history is true. With the rumors now reaching the ears of Volte, Haushalter is anxious to provide solid evidence of his heritage.<br/><br/>'Heinz Haushalter was aware that his family moved into the town four generations ago and later grew into prominence. But he has recently determined that prior to this his family held lordship of the hamlet of Marlehof, some 3 days journey by foot from the town. Journal entries made by his great-grandfather (Vorster) indicate that a family crypt of some size existed near this hamlet. With the wedding approaching he sent two of his hired men on horseback to ask questions and see if there was anything in the family crypts to prove his great-greatgrandfather's nobility. They were expected back in a week. It's been two weeks and they haven't returned. The wedding is 8 days away, Volte is getting skittish, and Haushalter is getting desperate.

This is not Hollywood medievalism, but the real thing. The Medieval Player's Manual has been exhaustively researched to provide rules that reflect the actual beliefs of the period. Ars Magica line developer David Chart has written a book that is both authentic and playable. Take your d20 game back to the Middle Ages with the Medieval Player's Manual. The book includes:<br/><br/><br/>     Three new magic core classes (cunning man, natural magician, and theurge) and two support prestige classes (necromancer and theophanist). <br/>     New systems for medieval magic like folk charms, alchemy, astrology, astral charms, and theurgy. <br/>     Three new religious core classes (priest, canonist, and saint) and five supporting prestige classes (crusader, templar, prelate, hermit, and mystic). <br/>     The introduction of Charisms, new feats representing gifts of miraculous power granted by God. <br/>     Rules for holding academic disputations, creating theories, and writing books. <br/>     Non-combat core classes like scholar and artist. <br/>     Overviews of the Christian Church, the political history of the time, philosophy and the arts, and medieval laws and beliefs. <br/>     Suggestions for alternate campaigns, like the Abbey Campaign and the Court Campaign, and intriguing historical &quot;What ifs?&quot;. <br/>     Backgrounds and stats for important people of the day, like Empress Matilda, Archbishop Anselm of Canterbury, and natural magician Adelard of Bath. <br/><br/><br/>The book also presents &quot;Kin of the Conqueror&quot;, a campaign setting detailing the anarchic period after the death of King William the Conqueror. From 1087 to 1154 the British Isles and northern France were convulsed by wars over his legacy. Plunge into adventure with Kin of the Conqueror, or use the rules to explore other parts of the medieval world.

She, being a woman who knew, and got, what she wanted, had a beautiful garden created.

The Sixth World's a place of eating or being eaten.

It presents a detailed overview of the animals, spirits, and other non-metahuman entities that dwell in the Sixth World: from mundane animals that have survived the incursions of mankind, to paranormals that have Awakened, to emergent animals that have found their own ways to embrace the Matrix, to the spirits and feral AIs that may not even acknowledge metahumanity. Game rules and mechanics are provided for these beings and their unusual abilities, but so are rules for characters to interact with, to augment, and to train the critters presented.

Your skills and confidence grew. Now the jobs for hired swords are few, and though you're still hungry for glory and riches and honor, right now you'd settle for a meal...<br/><br/>Fortunately, good men are needed to help civilize a new domain - that may mean steady meals and reliable friends for a hungry, lonely mercenary. Seven scenarios of varying complexity will test his skills and wits, and his abilities to fight, guard, investigate, and explore will be crucial to his success. If he survives, he'll be well-seasoned, ready for anything in Glorantha.<br/><br/>Prax is a wilderness. Duke Raus is out to tame a corner of it for himself.

The campaign is intended for intermediately skilled characters. Background, history, and regional details are included: the employer, the different tribal peoples in the area, the creatures and monsters (ducks to dinosaurs, whirlvishes to wraiths), and area specific magic items. The range of encounters is sizable, including the deadly Eternal Battle, a time-warped holdover form the Gods War.<br/><br/>Mercenaries earn their pay in Prax!<br/>Runemasters details 45 Rune Lords, Rune Priests, and Rune Lord-Priests of the 15 cults surveyd in Cults of Prax. Each character is completely individualized, experienced, equipped with spells, treasurdes, bound spirits, and so on. They form a valuable collection for referees who need Rune-level characters as NPCs. This is much more than just a collection of statistics. It also discusses how Runemasters are created, and about the logic of their growth, how each type of runemaster should be played, what their retinue (if any) should be, how a referee can organize his NPCs with coherent melee tactics and team strategy, etc. They are the most informative notes of their kind ever published about the rational play of strong Runequest characters. Included as an added bonus are the character histories, deleted from the original manuscript, but restored here over 25 years later.<br/><br/>Plunder gives detailed descriptions of many of Glorantha's magical treasures. Each has notes on physical appearance, relationship to various cults, extent of public knowledge of the item, history, procedure for making items that can be made, its powers, and its value.

And what are these rumors that are whispered among the frightened villagers -- rumors of an old, tremendously evil power that lies behind the robberies? The Count of Beorn wants your party to get to the truth.<br/><br/>For many years there has been peace in the lands of the Count of Beorn. The fertile plain of the river Vantress has yielded bountiful harvests, commerce has prospered, and the rule of the successive Counts of Beorn has been generally wise and good-natured, if occasionally corrupt. But of late disturbing reports of highway robbery have reached the palace at Ambigawd, the county east of Beorn. According to the tales of whimpering merchants, the sound lands are being overrun by a band of vicious brigands and the east roads are cut off by incursions of strange flying reptiles. Already there has been a complete halt to the rich trade caravans to and from Beorn's southern neighbors.<br/><br/>Three weeks ago the Count of Beorn sent a squad of 30 fighting men to one of the most affected areas, near the small village of Wayfare. So far there has been no report, no message, no rider -- not even a rumor of their fate. Suddenly gravely concerned, the count has called  for a special group of volunteers to go to the Wayfare area, discover the fate of the first expedition, investigate reports of the brigands, and if possible to put an end to the trouble. Those who answer the call can expect danger and possibly even a horrendously painful death, but also great reward, for the count will be very grateful to those who reopen the trade routes.<br/><br/>"}, "51758": {"rpgdesigner": ["Rick Meints"], "rpgitemversion": ["First Edition", "Second Edition (MIG II)"], "statistics": [], "name": "The Meints Index to Glorantha", "rpgproducer": ["Rick Meints"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic583502.jpg", "usersrated": "6", "rpgsetting": ["Glorantha"], "average": "7.66667", "rpgissuearticle": ["The Meints Index to Glorantha (MiG) 2"], "rpggenre": ["Fantasy"], "rpgpublisher": ["The Reaching Moon Megacorp"], "rpg": ["RuneQuest (1st & 2nd Editions)", "RuneQuest (3rd Edition)"], "rpgcategory": ["Non-Game Book (but RPG Related)"], "poll": [], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic583502_t.jpg", "description": "A comprehensive index and discussion of products in the Glorantha setting.<br/><br/>Back Cover:<br/>Playing in or collecting literature about Glorantha has often been a challenge.

Only a few top officials knew of its existence and it became known simply as &quot;Bureau 13.&quot; For the next century, the few employees of the Bureau went quietly about their &quot;business&quot; of secretly ferreting out and eliminating the destructive aspects of the supernatural.<br/><br/>So successful were their efforts that the memories of the public dimmed and the fear of the unknown was replaced by awe (and suppressed fear) of the new technologies. Foreign branches of the organization were established in Europe, Africa, and Asia.<br/><br/>The years have passed and worldwide memories have failed. The public has come to believe that magic and the supernatural are the stuff of children's dreams and nightmares. They are wrong.<br/><br/>Bureau 13, now an ultramodern force, more secret than before, fights to stem the growth of ancient magic and the supernatural that threatens the innocent.

Each of the three, cryptically known as ThumpMaster, Skewersure, and Hackrazer, vanished without a trace. All of them had been in the possession of well-known if not well-regarded individuals in and around Fangaerie. The weapons were taken despite the formidable skills of the individuals in question and the various guards and wards of their respective dwelling places.<br/><br/>The owners were slain, the various guardians and magical sureties left untouched and untriggered. Not even the most potent of necromantic sorceries were able to contact the departed spirits of the dead, nor could the corpses be raised or resurrected. The weapons were unexplicably and undeniably gone.<br/><br/>The unprecedented mystery remained a crime without a clue, until a taunting poem suddenly appeared. The rhyme materialized without witness or explanation on the walls of taverns and inns across the land, from Frandors Keep's Burning Dawg Inn to the Gilded Lily in Hesur. This poem, which seemed to create more questions than it answered, was signed with the serpentine rune of Keraptorse.<br/><br/>White Doom Mountain has tentatively been identified as the location spoken of in the poem.

After facing off against malign influence of the Psycharus Worm, the Explorers find themselves in possession of both the Emperor&rsquo;s Bounty and the fell Halo Device that led to its demise. Unfortunately for them, their actions have had more far reaching consequences than they could imagine, and in defeating the thralls of the Worm they have stirred up dark forces and ancient alien powers. In this adventure, the Explorers will learn of the true power of the Worm and catch a terrifying glimpse into the legacy of its creators. Their vessel and crew will be subverted by the power of a terrible xenos race known as the Yu&rsquo;vath&mdash;an evil thought by most to have been long since extinguished from the galaxy&mdash;and they will be drawn into an ancient trap from which they must find a way to escape or become lost forever.<br/><br/>You do not need a copy of Rogue Trader to play this adventure. It can be run using the characters and rules presented in the Forsaken Bounty booklet (available for download from the Fantasy Flight website). However if you do possess a copy of the Rogue Trader rulebook, guidelines have been presented to allow the GM to expand on certain encounters and challenges&mdash;adding such things as space battles and alternative enemies.<br/><br/>"}, "51901": {"rpgartist": ["Christos Achilleos", "David Andrews", "Leo Hartas", "Bill Houston"], "statistics": [], "name": "Warlock (Issue 8 - Feb/Mar 1986)", "rpgdesigner": ["Paul Cockburn", "Marc Gascoigne", "Steve Jackson (II)", "Ian Livingstone", "Rick Priestley", "Jamie Thomson"], "rpgproducer": ["Mary Common", "Peter Darvill-Evans", "Paul Mason", "Jon Sutherland", "Steve Williams"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic528670.jpg", "usersrated": "0", "average": "0", "rpgissue": ["Warlock"], "rpgissuearticle": ["Arkenor & Max", "Brain Blistering Maze Competition Results", "Fantasy in Miniature", "Omens and Auguries", "Out of the Pit", "The Arcane Archive", "The Floating City", "The Tower of Hades", "The Warlock's Quill"], "rpg": ["Fighting Fantasy Gamebooks", "Fighting Fantasy: The Introductory Role-Playing Game", "Warlock"], "rpgpublisher": ["Games Workshop Ltd."], "rpgissueversion": ["Saddle Stapled (modules/pamphlets)"], "poll": [], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic528670_t.jpg", "description": "Issue #8 - Feb/Mar 1986<br/><br/>"}, "51902": {"rpgdesigner": ["(Uncredited)"], "rpg": ["The Palladium Role-Playing Game"], "statistics": [], "name": "The Palladium Role-Playing Game Shield", "rpgartist": ["(Uncredited)"], "rpgproducer": ["(Uncredited)"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic764911.jpg", "usersrated": "2", "rpgitemversion": ["Screen"], "average": "3", "rpggenre": ["Fantasy (High Fantasy)"], "rpgpublisher": ["Palladium Books"], "rpgcategory": ["Accessory (dice, maps, screens, cards)"], "poll": [], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic764911_t.jpg", "description": "This is a GM sheild for Palladium First Edition.<br/><br/>"}, "51903": {"boardgamedesigner": ["Theresa A.

When a Player Character dies, the event is treated with only slightly more importance than the death of an NPC or a monster.  However, this need not be the case and, in Delos at least, death can sometimes simply be the beginning.<br/><br/>The Delian Book of the Dead introduces the Character Class: Deceased (Phantom) along with an examination of the role of the departed spirit as a Player Character.  Other topics include funeral rites, phantom magicks and other spirit-related magicks as well as the nature of the afterlife and the Planes of the Abyss and other matters of importance to those recently deceased.<br/><br/>Table of Contents (abbreviated)<br/><br/>Character Class: Deceased (Phantom): While not all who die are capable of returning as phantoms, for those who do, a life after death can be a rewarding existence.<br/><br/>Phantom Class Abilities &amp; Limitations: Just as death brings an end to old abilities, life as a phantom -- if you'll pardon the expression -- brings new skills and fresh possibilities.<br/><br/>Phantom Magicks: While mortal magicks are of little use to those of the phantasmal persuasions, life after death does not mean that there are no magicks to be mastered.<br/><br/>New Spells &amp; Spirit-Related Magicks: While little attention is paid elsewhere to magicks used by mortals in connection with spirits, those adventuring with phantoms may well find these new spells useful in their endeavors.<br/><br/>Character Class: Archaeologist: Long before Indiana Jones appeared, archaeological adventurers were wandering the paths and byways of Delos.  Sharing some of the abilities of the Thieves class, Archaeologist have their own skills, interests and abilities.<br/><br/>Notable Tombs of Delos: Excerpted from The Complete Cracksman by Professor R. J. Raffles, Prof. Emeritus of the University School of the Delian Thieves Guild, Professor Raffles was well noted for her personal investigations of many of the more remote areas of the Delian Commonwealth.<br/><br/>Funeral Rites of the Commonwealth: Quite aside from possible personal participation, the wise adventurer may well find a knowledge of both guild and regional funeral rites an advantage in remaining among the living.<br/><br/>Gem Stones &amp; Other Jewels: It's all very well to scoop up a chance handful of gems in the hopes of finding them profitable ... but how well do you know your gemstones ... and not just which ones are profitable but which ones are safe to handle at all?<br/><br/>Natural Hazards &amp; Other Dangers: In Delos, the adventurer not only must contend with monsters and wildlife but should also be wary of less obvious dangers ... because some are not obvious at all.<br/><br/>And Doors On New Vistas Opening: Most are accustomed to using doors without a second thought ... but, occasionally, doors are more than they appear ...<br/><br/>Arms and Armour: ... of course, weapons are not always the answer ... but they are, sometimes, the question ...<br/><br/>A Gentle Cup of Poison From the Hand of a Friend: Accomplishing the transition from the world of the living to the Planes Beyond may be undertaken in many ways ... and one such route might be ...<br/><br/>Mirrors and Other Windows: As we all are aware, ghosts and other specters, like vampires, can not be seen in mirrors ... or can they ...?<br/><br/>And, For Light Reading,...: Notes on books, scrolls and other writings which may be encountered while adventuring ... but not always safely ...<br/><br/>A Matter of Menagerie: On the care, seeking and acquisition of strange pets ... (and the consequences of living with them later...)<br/><br/>The Book of the Planes: Just as the Delian Commonwealth encompasses many diverse peoples, so too does the Delian afterlife present a diversity of places, planes and regions which are commonly referred to as the Neather Planes, the Abyss or the Great Beyond.  In some cases, these regions are even accessible to mortals (via the Well of the Worlds) and a number of the more popular regions and their inhabitants are described here.<br/><br/>The Horn of Hern: The Horn of Hern is an adventure designed for the recently deceased but is not limited to those who have passed beyond. As a mission offered by Amazon Mutual Life Assurance, this is a challenge for the living and the dead alike ... and may lead to a most singular conclusion.<br/><br/>"}, "51978": {"rpgdesigner": ["George MacDonald (I)", "Steve Peterson"], "rpgitemversion": ["First Printing", "Soft Cover"], "poll": [], "name": "Island of Dr. Destroyer", "rpgartist": ["Mark Williams"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic528970.jpg", "usersrated": "6", "rpgsetting": ["Champions Universe"], "average": "7", "rpgissuearticle": ["Game Reviews - Island of Dr. Destroyer", "Open Box"], "rpg": ["Champions (1st Edition)"], "rpgpublisher": ["Hero Games"], "statistics": [], "rpgcategory": ["Scenario / Adventure / Module"], "rpggenre": ["Action / Adventure", "Action / Adventure (Superheroes)", "Science Fiction"], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic528970_t.jpg", "description": "The first published Champions adventure pits the heroes against Dr. Destroyer.
