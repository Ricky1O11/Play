The scenario was published on the Black Industries website.<br/><br/>From the Introduction:<br/><br/>(!SPOILERS!)<br/><br/>'The Burgher Heinz Haushalter is a respected merchant whose daughter (Etelka) is engaged to wed a minor local noble, Karl Volte. The marriage is favorable to both parties, as Volte is fairly impoverished and Haushalter is keenly interested in social climbing. However Haushalter has a rival, Burgermeister Gunthar Steinhoff, who would prefer the noble wed his own daughter. Although Steinhoff can offer a richer dowry than Haushalter, Haushalter has a distant claim to noble heritage that is very important to Volte. To the bankrupt noble it is vital to maintain the appearance that he is not marrying below his station. In public Steinhoff maintains a friendly mien so that, as yet, Haushalter is unaware of the depth of Steinhoff's animosity to him.<br/><br/>'Although Haushalter's noble heritage is commonly accepted history by many townsfolk, recent rumors (spread by Steinhoff's agents) have sprang up that it is untrue and the Haushalter family has been lying for years about this. Unfortunately Haushalter doesn't have any proof that his family history is true. With the rumors now reaching the ears of Volte, Haushalter is anxious to provide solid evidence of his heritage.<br/><br/>'Heinz Haushalter was aware that his family moved into the town four generations ago and later grew into prominence. But he has recently determined that prior to this his family held lordship of the hamlet of Marlehof, some 3 days journey by foot from the town. Journal entries made by his great-grandfather (Vorster) indicate that a family crypt of some size existed near this hamlet. With the wedding approaching he sent two of his hired men on horseback to ask questions and see if there was anything in the family crypts to prove his great-greatgrandfather's nobility. They were expected back in a week. It's been two weeks and they haven't returned. The wedding is 8 days away, Volte is getting skittish, and Haushalter is getting desperate. This is where the player characters come in.<br/><br/>"}, "51646": {"rpgitemversion": {"7421": "Soft Cover"}, "poll": {}, "name": "Mistrz Gry\u00b2", "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic531126.jpg", "usersrated": "6", "rpgsetting": {"2249": "Neuroshima"}, "average": "6.33333", "rpgissuearticle": {"156454": "W\u00f3r pomys\u0142\u00f3w"}, "rpg": {"1285": "Neuroshima"}, "statistics": {}, "rpgcategory": {"2108": "Sourcebook (rules/options to enhance play)"}, "rpggenre": {"165": "Science Fiction (Post Apocalypse)"}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic531126_t.jpg", "description": "&quot;Mistrz Gry^2 - sourcebook filled with NPCs, villages, new enemies (Dead Breath zombies, and the IV generation Mutants) and a guide &quot;hit your players&quot;, showing possible actions a gamemaster can do, when the players become overconfident, or too powerful.<br/><br/>&quot;<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;Neuroshima,&quot; available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "51647": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic528217.jpg", "poll": {}, "boardgamedesigner": {"3": {"name": "(Uncredited)"}}, "statistics": {}, "yearpublished": "0", "maxplayers": "2", "age": "0", "boardgamepublisher": {"873": {"name": "Warp Spawn Games"}}, "maxplaytime": "0", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic528217_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "0", "boardgamecategory": {"1009": {"name": "Abstract Strategy"}}, "description": "In this chess variant, every time you capture an enemy piece, you may take any one of your captured pieces and put it into your reserve.

She, being a woman who knew, and got, what she wanted, had a beautiful garden created. Porpher is said to have laid an enchantment on it to enhance the garden's beauty, and pleasantly to beguile and tease those honored few who, on occasion, were invited as guests to enjoy the garden of their hosts.<br/><br/>But alas, all flesh is mortal, and even elves must die. So it was with Caerwyn in the fullness of time. After her passing, Porpher caused a tomb to be raised in the midst of the home that had given them both such delight.<br/><br/>Then he went about, and placed upon the garden new enchantments, bolder enchantments, of a more powerful kind, to guard and preserve its peacefulness from all intruders.<br/><br/>When this task was done, he ceased his personal magicks and allowed his own life to slip away, leaving instructions that he and she should lie together for all eternity in the tomb within the garden of their love, so that even in death they would not be apart.<br/><br/>So it remains to this very day. There have been those who tried, spurred on by greed created with stories of great treasure entombed with the two lovers. For that is always the way with men -- give him a mystery, and he must solve it. Many failed to even enter the garden, and those who have and returned after a *cough* long absense, their minds and memories seemed to have been... altered.

You should never have abandoned the ship and struck out into the jungle, but your pursuers were closing on your trail and it seemed the only way. Stumbling onward, your party makes for higher ground ahead. As you cross a ridge, the sun sinks below the horizon and night comes. A full moon rises, sending moonbeams and ghostly shadows flickering through the branches. Ahead in the dense jungle stands a clearing. There is an ancient ruin suddenly visible -- a worn and overgrown pyramid fills the glade, shining in the moonlight, seeming almost brighter than the moon itself. A refuge, perhaps, this pyramid which reminds you much more of a temple than a tomb. You suddenly notice eerie carvings of Lizard-like men on the stone blocks, and you recall the local legend of the Slaz'Steceks.<br/><br/>A HackMaster adventure for 4-8 characters between levels 4-6, the greatly expanded Hidden Shrine offers over 65 separate encounters spread across five rounds.

One will find that Garweeze World is a far more dangerous and rewarding place than that.<br/><br/>There is a valley few know about and even fewer have ever been to. Once, it was a place where the hermits and powerful magic-users went to be alone. It has been said to be a place of wonder and beauty beyond the imagination. Something has happened recently, and it has not been good. Dark armies are said to be on the move now from somewhere deep within the valley, perhaps from the citadel of Aster.<br/><br/>The only way to find out is to enter this desolate place and explore the town of Rumarok, which sits just at the head of the valley.

The campaign is intended for intermediately skilled characters. Background, history, and regional details are included: the employer, the different tribal peoples in the area, the creatures and monsters (ducks to dinosaurs, whirlvishes to wraiths), and area specific magic items.

Each character is completely individualized, experienced, equipped with spells, treasurdes, bound spirits, and so on. They form a valuable collection for referees who need Rune-level characters as NPCs. This is much more than just a collection of statistics. It also discusses how Runemasters are created, and about the logic of their growth, how each type of runemaster should be played, what their retinue (if any) should be, how a referee can organize his NPCs with coherent melee tactics and team strategy, etc. They are the most informative notes of their kind ever published about the rational play of strong Runequest characters. Included as an added bonus are the character histories, deleted from the original manuscript, but restored here over 25 years later.<br/><br/>Plunder gives detailed descriptions of many of Glorantha's magical treasures. Each has notes on physical appearance, relationship to various cults, extent of public knowledge of the item, history, procedure for making items that can be made, its powers, and its value.

And what are these rumors that are whispered among the frightened villagers -- rumors of an old, tremendously evil power that lies behind the robberies? The Count of Beorn wants your party to get to the truth.<br/><br/>For many years there has been peace in the lands of the Count of Beorn. The fertile plain of the river Vantress has yielded bountiful harvests, commerce has prospered, and the rule of the successive Counts of Beorn has been generally wise and good-natured, if occasionally corrupt. But of late disturbing reports of highway robbery have reached the palace at Ambigawd, the county east of Beorn. According to the tales of whimpering merchants, the sound lands are being overrun by a band of vicious brigands and the east roads are cut off by incursions of strange flying reptiles. Already there has been a complete halt to the rich trade caravans to and from Beorn's southern neighbors.<br/><br/>Three weeks ago the Count of Beorn sent a squad of 30 fighting men to one of the most affected areas, near the small village of Wayfare. So far there has been no report, no message, no rider -- not even a rumor of their fate. Suddenly gravely concerned, the count has called  for a special group of volunteers to go to the Wayfare area, discover the fate of the first expedition, investigate reports of the brigands, and if possible to put an end to the trouble. Those who answer the call can expect danger and possibly even a horrendously painful death, but also great reward, for the count will be very grateful to those who reopen the trade routes.<br/><br/>"}, "51758": {"rpgitemversion": {"8809": "First Edition"}, "statistics": {}, "name": "The Meints Index to Glorantha", "rpgproducer": {"18840": "Rick Meints"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic583502.jpg", "usersrated": "6", "rpgsetting": {"268": "Glorantha"}, "average": "7.66667", "rpgissuearticle": {"140842": "The Meints Index to Glorantha (MiG) 2"}, "rpggenre": {"961": "Fantasy"}, "rpg": {"277": "RuneQuest (1st & 2nd Editions)"}, "rpgcategory": {"2139": "Non-Game Book (but RPG Related)"}, "poll": {}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic583502_t.jpg", "description": "A comprehensive index and discussion of products in the Glorantha setting.<br/><br/>Back Cover:<br/>Playing in or collecting literature about Glorantha has often been a challenge.

Wadsting no time, as soon as you are all gathered, the crafty old statesman begins to speak. &quot;Giants have been raiding the lands of Garweeze Wurld, causing widespread death and destruction - and great consternation to we noble rulers sworn to protect the life and goods of certain influential members of the populace. Therefore, a party of the bravest and most powerful adventurers was assembled and given the assignment to punish the miscreant giants. Unfortunately they charged too much so you fellows will have to do!&quot;<br/><br/>This charge is not as harsh as it may seem, for you will be fully equipped with all standard items needed for both wilderness and dungeon exploration; and each member of the party will likewise be given the finest horse available. Note, however, that these are only 'loaners' and you bear the entire risk of loss or damage to the rented equipment or mounts. Guides have been made available to escort you to your first objective; the great fortress of Ivar the Hill Giant chieftain.<br/><br/>You are cautioned to expect a secret force, some motivational guru behind this unusual banding of different races of giants. More surprises might be in store...<br/><br/>You are to follow any clues discovered if such point towards the sinister hand suspected of guiding the rising, but to report in at once if you should determine exactly the reason or force behind the alliance of evil. After all, some dark relic might be at hand... or it might not. Who knows. Regardless, there are plenty of giants to hack and treasure to loot.

In this adventure, the Explorers will learn of the true power of the Worm and catch a terrifying glimpse into the legacy of its creators. Their vessel and crew will be subverted by the power of a terrible xenos race known as the Yu&rsquo;vath&mdash;an evil thought by most to have been long since extinguished from the galaxy&mdash;and they will be drawn into an ancient trap from which they must find a way to escape or become lost forever.<br/><br/>You do not need a copy of Rogue Trader to play this adventure.

When a Player Character dies, the event is treated with only slightly more importance than the death of an NPC or a monster.  However, this need not be the case and, in Delos at least, death can sometimes simply be the beginning.<br/><br/>The Delian Book of the Dead introduces the Character Class: Deceased (Phantom) along with an examination of the role of the departed spirit as a Player Character.  Other topics include funeral rites, phantom magicks and other spirit-related magicks as well as the nature of the afterlife and the Planes of the Abyss and other matters of importance to those recently deceased.<br/><br/>Table of Contents (abbreviated)<br/><br/>Character Class: Deceased (Phantom): While not all who die are capable of returning as phantoms, for those who do, a life after death can be a rewarding existence.<br/><br/>Phantom Class Abilities &amp; Limitations: Just as death brings an end to old abilities, life as a phantom -- if you'll pardon the expression -- brings new skills and fresh possibilities.<br/><br/>Phantom Magicks: While mortal magicks are of little use to those of the phantasmal persuasions, life after death does not mean that there are no magicks to be mastered.<br/><br/>New Spells &amp; Spirit-Related Magicks: While little attention is paid elsewhere to magicks used by mortals in connection with spirits, those adventuring with phantoms may well find these new spells useful in their endeavors.<br/><br/>Character Class: Archaeologist: Long before Indiana Jones appeared, archaeological adventurers were wandering the paths and byways of Delos.  Sharing some of the abilities of the Thieves class, Archaeologist have their own skills, interests and abilities.<br/><br/>Notable Tombs of Delos: Excerpted from The Complete Cracksman by Professor R. J. Raffles, Prof. Emeritus of the University School of the Delian Thieves Guild, Professor Raffles was well noted for her personal investigations of many of the more remote areas of the Delian Commonwealth.<br/><br/>Funeral Rites of the Commonwealth: Quite aside from possible personal participation, the wise adventurer may well find a knowledge of both guild and regional funeral rites an advantage in remaining among the living.<br/><br/>Gem Stones &amp; Other Jewels: It's all very well to scoop up a chance handful of gems in the hopes of finding them profitable ... but how well do you know your gemstones ... and not just which ones are profitable but which ones are safe to handle at all?<br/><br/>Natural Hazards &amp; Other Dangers: In Delos, the adventurer not only must contend with monsters and wildlife but should also be wary of less obvious dangers ... because some are not obvious at all.<br/><br/>And Doors On New Vistas Opening: Most are accustomed to using doors without a second thought ... but, occasionally, doors are more than they appear ...<br/><br/>Arms and Armour: ... of course, weapons are not always the answer ... but they are, sometimes, the question ...<br/><br/>A Gentle Cup of Poison From the Hand of a Friend: Accomplishing the transition from the world of the living to the Planes Beyond may be undertaken in many ways ... and one such route might be ...<br/><br/>Mirrors and Other Windows: As we all are aware, ghosts and other specters, like vampires, can not be seen in mirrors ... or can they ...?<br/><br/>And, For Light Reading,...: Notes on books, scrolls and other writings which may be encountered while adventuring ... but not always safely ...<br/><br/>A Matter of Menagerie: On the care, seeking and acquisition of strange pets ... (and the consequences of living with them later...)<br/><br/>The Book of the Planes: Just as the Delian Commonwealth encompasses many diverse peoples, so too does the Delian afterlife present a diversity of places, planes and regions which are commonly referred to as the Neather Planes, the Abyss or the Great Beyond.  In some cases, these regions are even accessible to mortals (via the Well of the Worlds) and a number of the more popular regions and their inhabitants are described here.<br/><br/>The Horn of Hern: The Horn of Hern is an adventure designed for the recently deceased but is not limited to those who have passed beyond.
