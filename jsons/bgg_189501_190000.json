You are encouraged to loot the styles and page objects for your own creations, whether free or commercial.<br/><br/>The art used in the game is also included, and was drawn from the Spears of the Dawn Art Pack and the Scarlet Heroes Art Pack, both of which are free for commercial use and available here on DTRPG.<br/><br/>Those who'd like to see how their own final product might look can order the print version of the pamphlet as well.

Black Spiral Vortices introduces a possible future for the world of Glimpse the Beyond, in which humanity has discovered the true nature of the supernatural through expanded exploration. Set in the year 2216, this supplement looks at a human race that has prospered through technological advancement and survived supernatural strife. Civilization as we know it in the 21st Century is a distant memory, and the Magi, once hidden from humanity, have risen to cultural prominence. No longer concerned with keeping their fellow humans in the dark about the supernatural, Magi now stand side by side with engineers and astrophysicists, using their knowledge to shape the future. Science and Magick have found a way to coexist in this world, by merging into the new practice known as Metateck, for the betterment and expansion of humanity throughout the cosmos.<br/><br/>Black Spiral Vortices examines how new technologies and magickal revelations have reshaped the universe and expanded humanity&rsquo;s role within it. The rules and materials herein are designed to explore a dark, yet hopeful future, far removed from the &ldquo;world outside your window&rdquo; presented in the core rulebook. This possible future is painted in broad strokes, leaving many of the specific details up to the Guide to determine. New setting elements and systems will be introduced which have been designed with the interstellar setting of Black Spiral Vortices in mind. Having said that, some Guides may wish to cherry pick certain elements from this book for use in a standard Glimpse the Beyond campaign, while ignoring other elements. Such is the prerogative of the individual Guide. It&rsquo;s your game. Keep what you like and discard the rest.<br/><br/>Black Spiral Vortices includes:<br/><br/>    Alternate Character Creation Rules: an expanded rule set that allows players to draw up mundane humans, Magi, technomagickal Metaphysicists, or supernatural creatures as playable characters.<br/>    New Boons, Flaws, and Skills: Boons, flaws, and skills specifically designed for use in the Black Spiral Vortices setting.<br/>    Alternate Ritual Magick Rules: the Black Spiral Vortices setting is a futuristic environment. As such, Ritual Magick works a bit differently than in the core setting. Furthermore, Black Spiral Vortices introduces a new type of technological magick called Metaphysicks, and the rules for implementing this potent tool.<br/>    Locations: a brief overview several human colonies, both within the Earth solar system and beyond!

If an A.I. had evolved far enough to develop an independent personality and passed the so-called Self-Test, it could ask for renegotiation of its terms of employment, and by the law, humans could not refuse. A.I.s are now also free to leave and seek a new employment, if so they wish. Still, A.I.s do not have full constitutional rights equivalent to those of humans. They cannot vote, and are often segregated into Bot-Towns. They are usually looked at as dangerous machines, with quirks that are exposed as &ldquo;bad programming&rdquo;, without a moral compass. They are still treated either as freed-slaves, with contempt, by the wealthiest human population, or feared as unfair competition by human workers. A.I.s have a reputation for being unpredictable &ndash; but this is unfair judgment. An evolved A.I. (evoA.I. as they&rsquo;ve become known as) indeed has a complex personality, but this is just a basic requirement for the evoA.I. to pass the Self-Test. This complex personality is the result of a floating set of moral variables and decision-making pointers. These in turn are combined (usually) with a certain low empathy and a lack of non-verbal communication (i.e. facial expressions, hands gestures, etc.), which all translates into humans perceiving the evoA.I.s as alien, unsettling and unpredictable.<br/><br/>"}, "189610": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2833316.jpg", "poll": [], "boardgamedesigner": ["Ben Cichoski", "Daniel Mandel"], "statistics": [], "yearpublished": "2016", "maxplayers": "4", "age": "0", "boardgamepublisher": ["Upper Deck Entertainment"], "boardgameintegration": ["Vs System 2PCG: A-Force", "Vs System 2PCG: Legacy", "Vs System 2PCG: Monsters Unleashed", "Vs System 2PCG: The Alien Battles", "Vs System 2PCG: The Marvel Battles", "Vs System 2PCG: The Predator Battles", "Vs System 2PCG: A-Force", "Vs System 2PCG: Legacy", "Vs System 2PCG: Monsters Unleashed", "Vs System 2PCG: The Alien Battles", "Vs System 2PCG: The Marvel Battles", "Vs System 2PCG: The Predator Battles"], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2833316_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "20", "boardgamecategory": ["Card Game", "Comic Book / Strip"], "description": "In Vs System 2PCG, players choose a main character, build a deck with exactly sixty cards, and attempt to stun the other player's main character in a game of superhero battle.

This is Retrostar.<br/><br/>Retrostar is a story-driven roleplaying game that faithfully and meticulously emulates the science fiction television shows of the 1970s. The game is powered by the Intention System, which places a sizeable portion of the narrative control in the players&rsquo; hands, while still maintaining the traditional roleplaying game structure.<br/><br/>Like all of Spectrum&rsquo;s &ldquo;genre emulation&rdquo; games, Retrostar is not simply a universal RPG that just happens to be adorned with genre-appropriate art. Every single design decision was made with the purpose of bringing to life the sci-fi TV shows of yesteryear, right at your gaming table. The rules even take into consideration the fact that these shows were created with very limited budgets at their disposal!<br/><br/>Everything you need to play Retrostar is included in the rulebook. Some of the features include:<br/><br/>    Simple and Elegant Task Resolution: The core of the Intention System revolves around rolling a certain number of six-sided dice (usually between two and four) and adding together either the two lowest results or the two highest results, depending on the rating of the Trait (Adventure, Thought or Drama) being used, the situation at hand and a few other factors. The higher the roll, the better. Based on that total, the character will either fail or succeed, though whether the player has to briefly cede control of the character is also determined here. There are more wrinkles to it, but that&rsquo;s the gist of how it works.<br/>    Series Creation: The Showrunner creates the Series in which the game will take place and there are full rules and guidelines for doing exactly that. You&rsquo;ll devise a setting, set up Dials that will help you generate Episodes on the fly, create supporting characters and flesh out all the fun details (terminology, styles, common special effects, etc.). It&rsquo;s a great deal of fun, without a bunch of complicated rules and number-crunching to bog the process down.<br/>    Time and Budget Management: In order to reflect the time restrictions these shows faced, the players are limited to twelve rolls (called Intents) in a given Act, of which each Episode has five. Characters will receive a certain amount of SFX&mdash;the exact amount is determined by the Series&rsquo; &ldquo;SFX&rdquo; Dial&mdash;to spend in order to activate cool effects that would require expenditure of the show&rsquo;s budget (impressive stunts, special effects and so forth).<br/>    The Spotlight: Just like in the TV shows of old, the heroes are all given a chance to have the spotlight shine on them. In Retrostar, this is represented by a communal pool of Spotlight Tokens that can be spent to showcase an appropriate aspect of a PC and giving them bonus dice for an Intent. For example, if a PC has a phrase in their Background that says &ldquo;Best friends since childhood with Malcolm (the name of another PC)&rdquo; the player can grab a Spotlight Token when Malcolm is in trouble.<br/>    Ready-to-Play Series: Inside the rulebook, you&rsquo;ll find seven full Series that allow you to dive right into the game. The Series are Battleground: Homefront, Earth Squared, Family Nuclear, Galactic Run, Outpost 2015, Space Rejects and WarpCruise-76. Additionally, it includes three Series Seeds that can be fleshed out and customized to suit your tastes.<br/>    Example of Play: This 13-page example of play covers the span of entire Act, so you can see precisely how the game works in practice.  <br/>    Genre Information: The rulebook contains an exhaustive discussion about the 1970s-era sci-fi television shows. It explores the nuances, tropes, styles and even a detailed &ldquo;recommended viewing&rdquo; section. By the time you&rsquo;re finished reading it, you&rsquo;ll be well-versed in the genre! <br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>"}, "189648": {"rpgdesigner": ["Sean Nokes", "Walt Robillard"], "rpg": ["ICONS"], "poll": [], "name": "The Eaters of Steel (ICONS)", "rpgartist": ["Ade Smith"], "rpgproducer": ["Mike Lafferty"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2796109.jpg", "usersrated": "0", "rpgitemversion": ["PDF version"], "average": "0", "statistics": [], "rpggenre": ["Action / Adventure (Superheroes)"], "rpgpublisher": ["Fainting Goat Games"], "rpgcategory": ["Scenario / Adventure / Module"], "rpgseries": ["Improbable Tales"], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2796109_t.jpg", "description": "From publisher blurb:<br/><br/>A disgruntled scientist has forged a symbiotic relationship with cyborg nomads from another dimension!

With a group of your friends, you will use all types of dice (From d4 to d20) and improvised instruments from your surroundings to partake in jams and try to win the favor of the boss played by one of your friends. The King of Bones is a lighthearted music roleplaying game that can fill a rowdy lunch or take a whole night to play. No matter how you decide to play, the King of Bones is a simple game which you and your friends can play anywhere. <br/>Although the King of Bones is a musical game. No significant musical knowledge is needed. All that is really needed is the ability to keep a beat while others are playing their game. For the sake of fun in the game world, the Boss should consider his band&rsquo;s overall ability level when setting the difficulty for the night. Additionally, players that might not be rhythmically gifted may have other ways that they can benefit the group.

They spend their lives dashing from halo to halo, grasping for torches and light switches. They don't linger in the shadows, for in them could be anything. And every night they send even the youngest of us into that darkness, alone and unprepared.<br/><br/>They do this because they know there really are things in the darkness. Things hungry for fear. Our parents fill the darkness' bellies with the ripest, most swollen fears, so the darkness leaves them alone. Or perhaps they think that if the monsters eat our fears, we will become brave and grow up. Whatever the case, their pact is made. The darkness is fed. And we children eventually stop screaming.<br/><br/>Eventually.<br/><br/>"}, "189656": {"rpgartist": ["(Uncredited)"], "rpg": ["Mixtapes and Mistakes"], "poll": [], "name": "Mixtapes and Mistakes", "rpgdesigner": ["Khelren", "Daniel Lewis", "Darcy Ross"], "rpgproducer": ["(Uncredited)"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2796186.png", "usersrated": "0", "rpgitemversion": ["Stage One RTF Version", "Stage Three Final PDF Version", "Stage Two RTF Version"], "average": "0", "statistics": [], "rpggenre": ["Childhood", "Social (Relationships / Romance)"], "rpgpublisher": ["(Web published)"], "rpgcategory": ["Core Rules (min needed to play)"], "rpgseries": ["#Threeforged RPG Design Challenge 2015"], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2796186_t.png", "description": "<br/><br/><br/>    <br/>         #Threeforged RPG Design Challenge Entry<br/><br/>    <br/>    <br/>         This RPG item was a submission to the #Threeforged RPG Design Challenge.

Nevertheless, If they make a wrong decision by keeping them or remove the fake one, they will lose their health points.

Most of these are the usual variety- ruins, coins, books. But there are forgotten things as well, things that were imbued with magic and life.<br/><br/>Collodi is a living puppet, the size of a human adult. It was made to be an entertainer, a marionette that told stories through others of its kind. Collodi was a delight and a wonder of its age that was created to love its work, and so it did. At the closing of the Breach, after the mayhem that followed, the puppeteer was left alone in Malifaux, with no more children to share stories with. The next century passed slowly. To make up for its loneliness, Collodi began making new puppets from bits of wood it scavenged. These fake children became the audience for new shows and stories, but it was never quite the same. As time went on Collodi began to slowly drift away, losing its grip on itself.<br/><br/>When the Breach reopened, Collodi rushed to the newly arrived settlers, drawn by the laughter of children. The adults attacked the living puppet, forcing it away with torches and axes. Denied the ability to fulfill its purpose, Collodi learned to hate. It vowed to teach humanity the emptiness it had felt for so long in the absence of children. It started making a new kind of puppet, using the blood of stolen children as a template. Collodi wanders Malifaux in its painted wagon, hiding in plain sight behind the masks it wears, still committed to its now twisted purpose.<br/><br/>Collodi&rsquo;s box comes with nine models, including Collodi himself. The Marionettes serve as Collodi&rsquo;s totems, giving it fast, tough minions that are utterly loyal to the puppet&rsquo;s evil will. The Wicked Dolls provide another variety of useful minion, in that they can repair other puppets and teleport next to an enemy in the blink of an eye. Vasilisa watches over all these puppets with a caring eye, but should an enemy catch up with its incredible speed, they will have to contend with its sharp needle and expert sewing skills.<br/><br/>"}, "189753": {"rpgartist": ["Pawel Dobosz", "Maciej Zagorski"], "rpgitemversion": ["PDF Version"], "rpgseries": ["Ptolus Sketchbook"], "name": "Midtown", "rpgdesigner": ["Maciej Zagorski"], "rpgproducer": ["Maciej Zagorski"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3026218.jpg", "usersrated": "0", "rpgsetting": ["Ptolus"], "average": "0", "statistics": [], "rpg": ["d20 System / OGL Product (D&D 3.5 Compatible)"], "rpgpublisher": ["The Forge Studios (I)"], "poll": [], "rpgcategory": ["Accessory (dice, maps, screens, cards)"], "rpggenre": ["Fantasy"], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3026218_t.jpg", "description": "From the publisher's blurb:<br/><br/>The Ptolus Sketchbook line is a great resource for players and DMs to &quot;see&quot; more of the City by the Spire.

He developed a fascination with decay and aging, focusing his research on the manipulation of both. A tragic accident during an experiment involving the aether and a plague rampaging through Malifaux City nearly killed him. Drowning in his own blood, the alchemist tapped into the aether desperately. Screaming in agony, his eyes closed. The next day, Plague's eyes opened.<br/><br/>Few records remain from the years of the Tyrants of Malifaux. The only certain thing is that they were locked away, trapped because they could not be killed. Plague slept millennia in the necropolis deep below Malifaux City. He was awoken by Hamelin the Rat Catcher, a pitiful bully on the run from the Guild. Hamelin's death was messy and horrific, reminiscent of Plague's first rebirth. Immediately, the Tyrant went after His ultimate goal, only to be prevented by Kirai Ankoku who shattered His physical form. It took months, but Plague eventually reformed Himself. Now, He acts more slowly to ensure His victory in the long run, searching for a new method of ascension into the aether- and the acquisition of true immortality.<br/><br/>Plague is the most aggressive of the active Tyrants. He holds to a strange view, that all of the Tyrants are playing a great game, one which is only worth playing because existence itself is the gamble. While His first attempt at ascension, harnessing the power of the Red Cage, failed miserably, He has discovered new methods to try. With everything on the line, He refuses to admit defeat.<br/><br/>Hamelin&rsquo;s box comes with ten models, including Hamelin himself. Four of those models are Malifaux Rats, the skulking vermin who invariably follow in Hamelin&rsquo;s wake. Also present are the Stolen, Hamelin&rsquo;s totems, who serve him either as a gamble to prolong his own life when killed, or as fresh meat to lure more Malifaux Rats into the battle. The Obedient Wretch helps her master by throwing rats at her enemies, some of which even survive to scurry away into the shadows. Hamelin&rsquo;s dog, Nix, is also present, if only as a festering plague-ghost who excels at locking down groups of enemy models.<br/><br/>"}, "189757": {"rpgartist": ["Pawel Dobosz", "Maciej Zagorski"], "rpg": ["d20 System / OGL Product (D&D 3.5 Compatible)"], "poll": [], "name": "Oldtown", "rpgdesigner": ["Maciej Zagorski"], "rpgproducer": ["Maciej Zagorski"], "average": "0", "usersrated": "0", "rpgitemversion": ["PDF Version"], "rpgsetting": ["Ptolus"], "statistics": [], "rpggenre": ["Fantasy"], "rpgpublisher": ["The Forge Studios (I)"], "rpgcategory": ["Accessory (dice, maps, screens, cards)"], "rpgseries": ["Ptolus Sketchbook"], "description": "From the publisher's blurb:<br/><br/>The Ptolus Sketchbook line is a great resource for players and DMs to &quot;see&quot; more of the City by the Spire.

What surprised his instructors was the determination he showed to learn the other styles when exposed to them. His brutality was matched by a ruthless cunning that drove him to master every temple style. While he was fully aware of the political power this granted him in the valley, he was not prepared for what would follow.<br/><br/>As dusk fell one day, sunlight blazed from an isolated temple on the valley wall, said to house the Dragon. Shenlong, the only person capable of looking at the searing light, found himself drawn to the ancient building. He walked in alone, emerging the following sunrise as more than a man. He was covered head to toe in tattooed scales, sunlight blazing in his eyes. Where he trod, the ground scorched. A new era in the valley had begun; the Dragon had chosen a new host.<br/><br/>Although he doesn&rsquo;t look it, Shenlong is thought to be more than eighty years old. The Dragon does not permit its hosts to age, holding them at their physical peak as long as it chooses to inhabit them.  While this arrangement is never eternal, Dragonhosts are known to have lived for several centuries. As long as the Dragon has need of a host for his plans, Shenlong will be near immortal. With the Dragon now turning its ancient eyes to Malifaux, his current host has a great deal to do before he becomes tiresome and is cast aside.<br/><br/>Shenlong&rsquo;s crew comes with seven models, including Shenlong himself. The Monks of High River are brutal combatants with flaming punches and kicks, and they serve Shenlong aside his totems, the less flashy but equally devoted Peasants.

Some monsters don't just prey on society from without, but have burrowed and wormed their way into the very heart of the civilized world, and twist and corrupt the very laws that are supposed to protect the innocent, using them to oppress and exploit them, instead. These evils are no less a threat than the ones that most adventurers face, but many PCs are ill-equipped to deal with them. This is a job for rebels.<br/><br/>This book presents five new rebellious archetypes for five different classes. Included are the rebel bloodline, a bloodrager bloodline for those whose blood boils at the thought of being controlled, and whose destructive impulses and shared rage allow them&mdash;and their friends&mdash;to fight the power, two new subdomains, independence and secrecy, the eldritch malcontent, a magus archetypes that focuses on hit and run tactics and blends their magic more with roguish stealth than soldierly discipline, the chaos discipline, a psychic discipline focused on wild and unpredictable magic, and the freedom spirit, a shaman spirit dedicated to freedom in all its forms, whether of body, mind, or spirit.<br/><br/>Whether you're about to embark on a politically-themed campaign (such as the official Paizo adventure path focusing on revolution), or you just want a selection of exciting new abilities for passionate and freedom-loving PCs, this book has lots of tantalizing options to offer. Even GMs can get in on the fun, as several of the archetypes here are perfect for rebellious villains as well, and can make for exciting and memorable encounters.<br/><br/>"}, "189767": {"rpgdesigner": ["Maciej Zagorski"], "rpg": ["Generic / Universal"], "poll": [], "name": "Map for Sale #01", "rpgartist": ["Maciej Zagorski"], "rpgproducer": ["Maciej Zagorski"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3029800.jpg", "usersrated": "0", "rpgitemversion": ["PDF Version"], "average": "0", "statistics": [], "rpggenre": ["Fantasy"], "rpgpublisher": ["The Forge Studios (I)"], "rpgcategory": ["Accessory (dice, maps, screens, cards)"], "rpgseries": ["Maps for Sale"], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3029800_t.jpg", "description": "From the publisher's blurb:<br/><br/>Map for sale #1 is the new product from The Forge Studios.

Attributes have Values ranging from -30 to 30, with an &quot;average&quot; person having a zero score.  Attribute Values are purchased from a Proficiency Points pool.  A number of Derived Attributes are calculated from Basic Attributes, most of them relating to combat.  Characters have a Derived Attribute called Overall Life Points which are analogous to hit points in other systems.  Characters also have Traits (negative and positive).  Most opposed actions and combat elements use either a modified percentile roll (D100) or a type of action table that determines how many and which type of dice to roll.<br/><br/>"}, "189819": {"boardgamedesigner": ["Thane Morgan"], "poll": [], "name": "The Assault on Goblintown", "playingtime": "120", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": ["Area Movement"], "yearpublished": "2015", "usersrated": "1", "maxplayers": "2", "average": "6", "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["(Self-Published)"], "boardgameversion": ["First edition"], "maxplaytime": "120", "boardgamecategory": ["Fantasy"], "age": "0", "minplaytime": "60", "description": "The Assault on Goblintown is a strategy dungeon crawling game for two players.

Essentially, you must make a new word (nouns only) using the last character of the previous. For example:  \u306d\u3053 &gt; \u3053\u307e &gt; \u307e\u307b\u3046 &gt; \u3046\u304d\u3088\u3048 &gt; \u3048\u304b\u304d and so on. The game has some other simple rules to keep it controlled.<br/><br/>Wocha follows the pattern of Shiritori with picture cards. Each card has a complex picture that can be interpreted many ways, much as Dixit does. Players arrange ten image cards so that everyone can see them easily. Reveal one new image card from the deck to start the chain, then race to decide which one of the ten images can join the first revealed card, explaining how the two cards link together.<br/><br/>Each time a card is moved from the common area to link to the chain, a replacement card is drawn. Each player has four coloured cubes, and drops a cube onto a card when they make a successful link. It is allowed to revise the explanation of the chain by re-intepreting  or re-using earlier cards. If a player can make a convincing argument, they can replace the previous player's cube with their own. The first player to dispose of their four cubes is the winner.<br/><br/>If a player makes a rather dubious interpretation on a card image, the game pauses and the players vote thumbs up or down whether to allow it. It is important to follow the rules of the word game. So in the example shown on the blog linked below, the start card was considered as \u305f\u3044\u3088\u3046 (\u592a\u967d taiyou / sun) and the next card as \u3046\u307e (\u99ac uma / horse (there is a horse in the car!)), thus chaining with \u3046. Now the current key letter would be \u307e from \u3046\u307e.<br/><br/>The new card drawn from the deck is a Matryoshka (\u30de\u30c8\u30ea\u30e7\u30fc\u30b7\u30ab). That would form a chain from \u3046\u307e. Then \u30de\u30c8\u30ea\u30e7\u30fc\u30b7\u30ab is linked by \u30ab\u30c3\u30d1 (kappa / a Yo-kai, folklore monster). Now that the key letter is \u30d1, when you look back at that first &quot;horse&quot; card, that vehicle might be a \u30d1\u30c8\u30ab\u30fc (police car). This lets the player bump the blue cube off and place their own.<br/><br/>Publisher's summary<br/><br/>&quot;Now that you mentioned it, it sure does look so.&quot; Associative skills and attentiveness is the key to this new picto-Shiritori game. The rules are simple.<br/><br/>Open 10 cards to form the community cards area, and give each player 4 colored tokens. Then draw 1 card from the deck, and open as the starting key card. Now, let the picture Shiritori begin!<br/><br/>From the 10 community cards, find a picture that can form a Shiritori-chain from the starting card. Found a good card? Call &quot;WOCHA!&quot;<br/><br/>The caller places the card next to the first card to form a chain, and places their token on the placed card. This newly placed card would be the new key. Now the players have to find a community card that can form a new Shiritori chain from the new key. Continue this procedure, and the one who gets rid of all of their tokens is the winner. But beware! The previously used cards may be reused to form a new chain. When done, the color token that was on the card would be removed and returned to the original player. So act quickly, and get rid of all your tokens before anyone attempts to return them back to you!<br/><br/>\u300c\u8a00\u308f\u308c\u3066\u307f\u308c\u3070\u3001\u305f\u3057\u304b\u306b\u898b\u3048\u308b\u3002\u300d<br/>\u9023\u60f3\u529b\u3068\u767a\u898b\u529b\u3002\u65b0\u611f\u899a\u306e\u7d75\u3057\u308a\u3068\u308a\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u3002<br/>\u30a6\u30a9\u30c3\u30c1\u30e3\u306e\u30eb\u30fc\u30eb\u306f\u3068\u3063\u3066\u3082\u30ab\u30f3\u30bf\u30f3\u3002<br/><br/>\u5168\u54e1\u304c\u5171\u901a\u3067\u4f7f\u7528\u3059\u308b10\u679a\u306e\u30ab\u30fc\u30c9\u3092\u673a\u306b\u4e26\u3079\u3001\u5404\u30d7\u30ec\u30a4\u30e4\u30fc\u306b\u306f4\u3064\u306e\u30ab\u30e9\u30fc\u30b3\u30de\u304c\u6e21\u3055\u308c\u307e\u3059\u3002<br/>\u3042\u3068\u306f\u3001\u7d75\u3067\u3057\u308a\u3068\u308a\u3092\u3057\u307e\u3059\u3002<br/>\u5c71\u672d\u304b\u3089\uff11\u679a\u30ab\u30fc\u30c9\u3092\u3081\u304f\u308a\u3001\u305d\u306e\u30ab\u30fc\u30c9\u306b\u30c1\u30a7\u30fc\u30f3\uff08\u7e4b\u304c\u308a\uff09\u51fa\u6765\u305d\u3046\u306a\u30ab\u30fc\u30c9\u3092\u5834\u306b\u4e26\u3093\u306010\u679a\u304b\u3089\u63a2\u3057\u307e\u3059\u3002<br/>\u898b\u3064\u3051\u305f\u4eba\u306f\u300cWOCHA!\uff08\u30a6\u30a9\u30c3\u30c1\u30e3\uff01\uff09\u300d\u3068\u53eb\u3073\u307e\u3057\u3087\u3046\u3002<br/>\u305d\u306e\u4eba\u306f\u5148\u307b\u3069\u306e\u30ab\u30fc\u30c9\u306e\u53f3\u96a3\u306b\u3001\u81ea\u5206\u304c\u30ad\u30fc\u30ef\u30fc\u30c9\u3092\u898b\u3064\u3051\u305f\u30ab\u30fc\u30c9\u3092\u7f6e\u304d\u3001\u3055\u3089\u306b\u305d\u306e\u4e0a\u306b\u81ea\u5206\u306e\u30ab\u30e9\u30fc\u30b3\u30de\u3092\u7f6e\u304d\u307e\u3059\u3002<br/>\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u306f\u5148\u307b\u3069\u30c1\u30a7\u30fc\u30f3\u3055\u308c\u305f\u30ab\u30fc\u30c9\u306e\u7d9a\u304d\u3067\u5f15\u304d\u7d9a\u304d\u884c\u3044\u307e\u3059\u3002<br/>\u3053\u308c\u3092\u7e70\u308a\u8fd4\u3057\u3001\u624b\u6301\u3061\u306e\u30ab\u30e9\u30fc\u30b3\u30de4\u3064\u3092\u8ab0\u3088\u308a\u3082\u65e9\u304f\u306a\u304f\u3057\u305f\u4eba\u304c\u52dd\u5229\u3067\u3059\u3002<br/>\u305f\u3060\u3057\uff01\u3059\u3067\u306b\u8ab0\u304b\u304c\u5148\u307b\u3069\u30c1\u30a7\u30fc\u30f3\u3057\u305f\u30ab\u30fc\u30c9\u306f\u672c\u4eba\u4ee5\u5916\u304c\u518d\u5ea6\u4f7f\u7528\u3067\u304d\u3001\u3082\u3057\u305d\u306e\u30ab\u30fc\u30c9\u3092\u8ab0\u304b\u304c\u4f7f\u7528\u3059\u308b\u3068\u3001\u5148\u307b\u3069\u30ab\u30e9\u30fc\u30b3\u30de\u3092\u305b\u3063\u304b\u304f\u7f6e\u3044\u3066\u3044\u305f\u306e\u306b\u4f7f\u7528\u3055\u308c\u305f\u77ac\u9593\u3001\u5143\u306e\u30d7\u30ec\u30a4\u30e4\u30fc\u306e\u3082\u3068\u306b\u623b\u3063\u3066\u304d\u3066\u3057\u307e\u3046\u306e\u3067\u3059\u3002<br/>\u4ed6\u306e\u30d7\u30ec\u30a4\u30e4\u30fc\u306b\u30ab\u30e9\u30fc\u30b3\u30de\u3092\u623b\u3055\u308c\u308b\u524d\u306b\u65e9\u304f\uff14\u3064\u3092\u624b\u653e\u3057\u3066\u3057\u307e\u3044\u307e\u3057\u3087\u3046\u3002<br/><br/>"}, "189847": {"boardgamedesigner": ["\u660e\u5730 \u5b99 (Sola Meichi)"], "average": "0", "poll": [], "name": "Hamaritagari", "playingtime": "5", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": ["Pattern Recognition", "Set Collection"], "yearpublished": "2015", "usersrated": "0", "maxplayers": "5", "boardgameartist": ["\u660e\u5730 \u5b99 (Sola Meichi)"], "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["SoLunerG"], "boardgameversion": ["Japanese first edition"], "maxplaytime": "0", "boardgamecategory": ["Action / Dexterity", "Animals", "Card Game", "Party Game", "Real-time"], "age": "8", "minplaytime": "5", "description": "User summary:<br/>\u306f\u307e\u308a\u305f\u304c\u308a (Hamaritagari) is a real-time action game in which players compete in speed and accuracy for pattern recognition and card play.

Capture highly desired butterflies, put them in your trusty jar, and deliver them to the garden to gain respect from the collecting community and to help diversify the garden &mdash; but watch out for your opponents as lepidopterists can be quite devious!<br/><br/>The game is played in a series of rounds. Players start each round by playing a card from their hands to determine the round's turn order. Cards are numbered from 0 to 59, and lower numbered cards will go first. On a turn, a player captures butterflies from the field and adds them to the jar (i.e., they take a card from the row of face-up cards and tuck it under their jar card). When possible, players &quot;deliver butterflies&quot; from their jars to the zoo's butterfly garden to score victory points (VPs). Which butterflies can be delivered is indicated on the face-up &quot;delivery cards&quot; and players are often in a race to deliver butterflies to take the cards and score points. The player with the most VPs at the end of the game wins.<br/><br/>During the game, players must carefully decide which butterfly cards to play. By playing lowered numbered cards, players not only get a better pick of butterflies in the field, but they also get first chance at delivering butterflies. However, lower numbered butterfly cards usually have fewer butterflies on them, so players cannot add as many to their jars. Also, butterfly cards with special powers usually have high numbers, so you often must sacrifice turn order in order to use one of these special powers.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": ["English first edition"], "average": "6.8659", "name": "The Butterfly Garden", "playingtime": "40", "boardgamemechanic": ["Auction/Bidding", "Card Drafting", "Hand Management", "Set Collection", "Simultaneous Action Selection"], "age": "8", "boardgameexpansion": ["208098"], "usersrated": "199", "boardgamefamily": ["Animals: Butterflies", "Crowdfunding: Kickstarter"], "boardgamepodcastepisode": ["The Long View - Quick Looks #13"]}, "189870": {"poll": [], "name": "Not without my donuts", "videogamemode": ["Local Multiplayer", "Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["Windows Downloadable edition"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3215297.jpg", "videogametheme": ["Fantasy"], "usersrated": "1", "videogamedeveloper": ["Different Donut"], "videogamegenre": ["Platform", "Shoot 'em Up"], "videogameplatform": ["Windows"], "average": "3", "statistics": [], "videogamepublisher": ["Different Donut"], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3215297_t.jpg", "description": "Armies of sweet tooth obscenities flew in from the portal, while creepy, crawly spiders dropped down like paratroopers from the sky.

Every game is different, and you'll want to play over and over again to try new ways of outsmarting your opponent. The game is expandable to large team or free-for-all games.<br/><br/>The objective of the game is to uncover and attack your opponent&rsquo;s Crown Card with one of your own cards. Each player places 5 piles of 5 cards each face down in from of them. The crown card should be hidden on the bottom of one of the 5 piles. The rest of the cards may be arranged however you like, but choose carefully. A bad setup can quickly give your opponent the upper hand.<br/><br/>Game play: Players take turns attacking by selecting the top Card from one of their Piles and laying that Card face up in front of one of their opponent&rsquo;s Piles. The defending player must then reveal the top Card of the Pile that was attacked. The Card with the lowest number value loses and is discarded. The winning Card must be returned face down to the top of the original Pile it was drawn from. If the two Cards have the same number value, both Cards are discarded. Play continues until one of the players attacks their opponent&rsquo;s Crown Card, winning the game.<br/><br/>Special cards:<br/>Archer Card: If you attack with an Archer Card, it always wins. If your Archer Card is attacked, it always loses. Shield Card: Shield Cards cannot be used to attack.

Each player starts the game with one location, and cards in the deck consist of attackers, defenders, locations and support cards. To start a turn, you draw two cards, pick up any cards banked from a previous turn, and take the three cards passed to you earlier by the player on your left. You play or bank cards until you have only three in hand, then pass those to the player on your right and end your turn.<br/><br/>Attackers target specific locations and earn points for the player wielding them if they're in play at the end of the game.
