If a player perceives the subject as being more expressive than shy or generous then the player would dial their opinionator to reveal the word most in the color that matches the color under the expressive ego card in the tripper. If the player percieves the subject as being less shy than generous then the player would dial their opinionator to reveal the word least in the color matching the &quot;shy&quot; ego card under the tripper making sure that the Most color already is revealed at the same time. When all players are ready they turn over their opinionators to reveal their opinions.<br/><br/>How to Score: The subject moves forward one square for each analyst opinion that matches his, plus one of his own. Players whose opinions do not match any other player move back one square. Players cannot move further back than the beginner square. Player whose opinions match one or more players remain where they are and are not penalized even if they do not match the subject's opinion. After scoring the player on the subject's left becomes the next subject adn the next session is played.<br/><br/>Winning the Game: Play continues with a new subject being evaluated after each session is complete.

Powered by phylacteries that are literally vessels of evil, liches live for thousands of years until their decaying physical forms finally crumble - and even, some live on. Their centuries-long horizon line gives them ample time to study, plot, and plan, and their devilish schemes are often generations in the making. No other creature possesses the same potential for long-term influence, nor does any other creature have the time to study dark magics for so long.<br/><br/>The Complete Guide to Liches covers all aspect of lichdom, from the most evil of undead lords to the rare redeemed liches, who have sloughed off their undead lives of evil. It introduces new lich variations, such as the philolich: a mortal lover reanimated by her lich companion to keep him company as he whiles away his centuries. The &quot;typical&quot; lich is examined in detail, along with several new varieties, including the monstrously powerful drowlich and the time-challenged novalich (whose more limited creation rituals give him but one year to complete a specific task). Finally, there are new feats and prestige classes to make lich NPCs even more deadly.<br/><br/>The Complete Guide to Liches is a stand-alone, world-neutral sourcebook covering everything you ever wanted to know about liches, both as a player and GM.

Each army is composed of square game pieces measuring 1.2 x 1.2 inches which represent their units.<br/><br/>During the game, pieces move across a rectangular board divided into squares arranged in rows and columns. In a game of CSW, each player has a number of units in his army which is set depending on the faction they are playing.  We call this set of units a &ldquo;Combat Sword. Two basic Combat Swords (Union of Terra and Alpha Centauri Brotherhood) are available for an introductory game of CSW.<br/><br/>Game pieces represent the units, troops, and vehicles of a fighting force. The pieces have two sides, Front (Illustration and Health arrow) and Back (Name, Attributes and Skills). A player has some pieces with the skill Leader (X). While these pieces are on the board, they grant X command points at the beginning of each turn. Each side alternates turns, making one or more moves depending on the number of Command points available.<br/><br/>Each unit requires a number of command points to be used that turn; this is referred to as &ldquo;Activating &rdquo; the unit. When all command points are spent, the opponent&rsquo;s turn begins. Each unit, upon being activated, can move and act in any order. The possible actions are &ldquo;Move&rdquo;, &ldquo;Embark/disembark&rdquo;, &ldquo;Attack&rdquo; and &ldquo;Use active skills&rdquo;.

A question possibly followed by many more.<br/><br/>The UFO has landed in an out of the way area compromised mostly of hard rocky ground covered only in sparse vegetation.

Although Sea Lord Drac gave Freeport the veneer of legitimacy, the city retained its buccaneer spirit.

While the Captain&rsquo;s Council plays politics and makes grand alliances, the pirates live life as they always have. A fast ship, a stout crew, and sharp steel is all a pirate needs.<br/><br/>That being said, piracy these days is a quite a bit different than the days of yore. The well-organized navies of the continental nations are dangerous opponents, and few pirate captains have more than one ship under their command. These days Freeport Pirates must range further afield, and take longer voyages, to find ripe pickings. Many head east, fueled by tales of spices and riches, while others harry the humanoid coastlands in the distant south. No one on the continent sheds any tears for the kuo-toa, orcs, or lizardfolk who fall to pirate cutlasses.<br/><br/>Fighters and rangers are most likely to become Freeport Pirates, closely followed by rogues and barbarians. Bards and sorcerers are unlikely pirates, but their high Charismas make can make it work. Clerics of maritime gods sometimes become pirates, as do druids that focus on the element of water.

In the rough and tumble early days, every pirate captain was considered an equal. Decisions were made by a simple majority, and duels were as common as debates. As the city grew, there were just too many captains to continue on as before. When Captain Drac became sole Sea Lord of Freeport, he knew it was time for change. He also knew he couldn\u0092t simply disregard the captains of Freeport, or his lordship would be over in a matter of days. His compromise solution was the creation of the Captain\u0092s Council. He chose six powerful captains to help him rule the city. They enforced Drac\u0092s edicts and handled the day-to-day business of governing the city.

Both have been imprisoned in the evil Bakuki's gloop factory, and you have to help them get out. Alive.<br/> It's your job to manoeuvre the pair through a labyrinth of trap-laden rooms by swiping, tapping or squeezing the touchscreen with one simple goal - reach the exit. Each room is filled with potential hazards and threats that could prove fatal - luckily there is always a way round, through or over each danger.<br/> Environments can be manipulated using the rear touch pad. Tap it to push out platforms for Lil and Laarg to walk over, or coax enemies into devious situations and move objects out of the way. You can also use the front touchscreen to stop gas leaks, pull levers and interact with your surroundings.<br/> Due to their different shapes and sizes, Lil and Laarg can use distinct abilities to help them solve these treacherous puzzles. Lil can inflate himself and, once full, you can squeeze the gas out of him by pressing the rear touch pad and the touchscreen at the same time - he'll shoot forwards at tremendous speeds. Laarg's size means he can crash through walls and floors, making an easy tunnel for his companion to walk through - it's worth doing this just to see the smile on his face. Swipe the touchscreen towards a fragile looking barrier and watch Laarg smash through it with ease.<br/> Escape Plan is a game of trial and error, with the latter ending in one of your characters being splattered over a wall or fried by a stray electrical wire.

On the other hand it allows to move cages with wild beasts into the arena as the other two doors leading into the ring are to narrow.<br/><br/>Usually the arena is used for show fights of highly trained professionals, who are as much entertainers as fighters.

You're quietly conquering people, minding your own business, when suddenly there's a plague, or barbarians, or everyone's illiterate, and it's all you can do to cling to some wreckage as the storm passes through. Still, you are sure that, as always, you will triumph over this adversity, or at least do slightly better than everyone else.<br/><br/>Dominion: Dark Ages is the seventh addition to the game of Dominion. It contains 500 cards but is not a standalone game. It adds 35 new Kingdom cards to Dominion, plus new bad cards you give to other players (Ruins), new cards to replace starting Estates (Shelters), and cards you can get only via specific other cards. The central themes are the trash and upgrading. There are cards that do something when trashed, cards that care about the trash, cards that upgrade themselves, and ways to upgrade other cards.<br/><br/>Part of the Dominion series.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": {"335026": "Czech first edition"}, "average": "8.08213", "name": "Dominion: Dark Ages", "playingtime": "30", "boardgamemechanic": {"2041": "Card Drafting"}, "age": "13", "boardgameexpansion": {}, "usersrated": "4061", "boardgameaccessory": {"138408": "Dominion Storage Box"}, "boardgamesubdomain": {"5497": "Strategy Games"}, "expands": {"36218": {"name": "Dominion"}}, "boardgamefamily": {"2580": "Dominion"}}, "125404": {"rpgitemversion": {"167107": "PDF Version"}, "statistics": {}, "name": "\u00dcber RPG: Steampunk", "rpgproducer": {"18040": "Steve Metze"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1459331.png", "usersrated": "6", "average": "6.61667", "rpggenre": {"166": "Steampunk"}, "rpg": {"18360": "\u00dcber RPG: Steampunk"}, "rpgcategory": {"2083": "Core Rules (min needed to play)"}, "poll": {}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1459331_t.png", "description": "From the publisher:<br/><br/>Welcome to a world of mad, inspirational wonders and wild scientific theory wrapped in fog, run by gears, and lit by gaslight.

The first magi were the fire priests who led the worshipping people of desert coasts that mistrusted the gods. As the leaders and scholars of their people, the magi were free to study the depths of arcane sciences. They pushed their abilities to the limit, using all of their mental attributes to further their mastery of magic. Today, the very term for common arcane manipulation, magic, is borrowed from their title but few know that the magi still exist.<br/><br/>Magi are spellcasters above and beyond all else. Their closest counterparts are wizards but they tend to be less adventurous and do not bother with binding familiars as wizards do. A magus treasures the chance to focus on their research that isolation brings rather than create companionship. Additionally, while many wizards treasure their role as item creators, magi prefer to research spells. Magi respect discipline and are comfortable with wizards and psions despite their differences. Magi consider<br/>wizards distracted and psions limited but nonetheless compatriots. Clerics are respected but their allegiances with gods are mistrusted and druids are admirable but&hellip;odd.

The availability and composition of helicopter fleet largely determines the level of equipment of the armed forces of any country.<br/><br/>Besides player's helicopter, the game includes a great number of other helicopters, sea and land military equipment controlled by a computer program (CP) or artificial intelligence (AI).

Take any two pyramids and challenge players to find the third pyramid required to form a Troika. Practice this several times.<br/>End Game<br/><br/>The game ends when the first player creates TROIKA in a row or column or one of two main diagonals on the board. This player is the winner.<br/><br/>If a player has at least one of his pyramids, but cannot place any of them, he loses the game.<br/>If both players run out of all their pyramids and no player created TROIKA, the player who did NOT start the game, wins.<br/><br/>(For this reason it is good to keep the die next to the game board.)<br/><br/>Rules of 5 games: <a target='_blank' href='http://www.mwe.cz/images/gettingstartedwithpyramids.pdf' rel='nofollow'>http://www.mwe.cz/images/gettingstartedwithpyramids.pdf</a><br/>To buy: <a target='_blank' href='http://mwe.cz/cart/index.php?route=product/product&amp' rel='nofollow'>http://mwe.cz/cart/index.php?route=product/product&amp</a>;product_id=73<br/><br/>"}, "125430": {"statistics": {}, "name": "Fast Draw Showdown", "videogamemode": {"2149": "Single-Player"}, "videogameversion": {"167148": "North American Arcade edition"}, "average": "0", "videogameseries": {"17131": "Mad Dog McCree"}, "videogametheme": {"2267": "Western"}, "usersrated": "0", "videogamegenre": {"2314": "Arcade"}, "videogameplatform": {"4781": "Arcade"}, "poll": {}, "description": "Fast Draw Showdown is a live-action laserdisc video game, released by American Laser Games in 1994 for a limited number of platforms.

The players score points by &quot;shooting&quot; animals on the way to the finish line. Everyone starts with 10 bullets and uses the 1-2-3 dice to move forward and the regular dice to shoot at the animals. When you arrive on a tile with an animal on it, you can decide if you want to shoot at that animal. This is done by the regular die. If you roll a number (1-6) that has an animal token on it, you &quot;shot&quot; the animal, you remove the token and keep it. Every shot costs one bullet. If you miss, you can try again by using another bullet. Obviously, if less animals remain, your chances to shoot one is smaller. Once you hit an animal, the next player's turn begins. If you arrive on an &quot;Amazonas&quot; tile, you can choose the animal you want to shoot at. Different animals give you different points (e.g. parrot one, lion six).<br/>There are also obstacles on the way that players must cross. If they fail to cross them, they loose animals worth of 6 points. If you don't have enough animals to return, you can give back your bullets (1 bullet - 1 point).<br/><br/>SWAMP: In order to cross the swamp, you need to roll a number (with the regular dice) that corresponds with the value of a neighboring tile (except the one behind you). In this case, you can move to that tile, making your way across the swamp.<br/>Once you make it through an obstacle (or even if you fail), you arrive in a village, where you can sell your animals for bullets according to the animal's value. (For a 6 point lion you get 6 bullets).<br/><br/>CHASM: In order to cross the chasm, you need to get 10 points out of 3 rolls.<br/><br/>COCONUT: Monkeys are throwing coconuts at you, and you must avoid them. You place your marker anywhere on the first row (there are four) and throw with the blue and red dice. The values of the colored dice show you where the monkeys are throwing the coconuts (red value counted from the left and blue from the right). If they miss, you go to the next row, if either of the hits you, you fall.<br/><br/>SUSPENSION BRIDGE: from 8 rolls you must get all the 6 values of the dice (1-6, in any order)<br/><br/>CROCODILES: You need to row through the water by using the green and white 1-2 dice (Right paddle green dice, left paddle white).
