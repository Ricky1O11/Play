It addresses former Midgard RPG players, who don't find the time for role playing anymore, as well as fans of fantasy boardgames. As the complexity level is rather high and the game offers multiple options for players, Midgard is rather successful in achieving it's goal. The difficulty is still light to medium, despite dozens of cards that influence the game and the characters.<br/><br/>The game is based on tiles (major cities of Midgard) players move across, collecting rare items and fulfilling adventures. Often this ends in the local city jail or in clashes with monsters. Additional threats like terror cards or riots pop up in cities during the game.<br/><br/>Tests are made with a 20-sided die and the mechanics are just the same as in the Midgard RPG. Movement and actions are controlled by action cards from a four-card-hand which allows tactical gaming. Each action card has different abilities and some may even interrupt another player's turn.<br/><br/>Players may form groups for the duration of a game turn to help each other solve adventures or make difficult tests. Sticking together earns each player of a group experience points and treasure cards. As only one player can finally win the game, forming groups is a two-edged sword as it helps your opponents too. The goal of the game is to get 3 treasure rewards, rise to character level 3 and find 2 artifacts first. If you deliver the treasures and artifacts to the correct city you have won the game.<br/><br/>Included are pre-generated characters like Sorcerer or Warrior but players will be able to create their own characters in the final release version.<br/><br/>This information is derived from the website of Phantastische-Spielewelten.<br/><br/><a target='_blank' href='http://www.phantastische-spielewelten.de' rel='nofollow'>http://www.phantastische-spielewelten.de</a><br/><br/>", "minplayers": "3", "boardgameversion": ["Phantastische Spielwelten edition"], "name": "Midgard: Das Brettspiel", "playingtime": "90", "boardgamemechanic": ["Action Point Allowance System", "Dice Rolling", "Modular Board", "Partnerships", "Role Playing"], "average": "6.82164", "boardgameexpansion": ["36329"], "usersrated": "70", "age": "12"}, "26134": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic290417.jpg", "poll": [], "boardgamedesigner": ["Hanno Girke"], "statistics": [], "yearpublished": "2006", "maxplayers": "6", "boardgameartist": ["Klemens Franz", "Cyril Saint Blancat"], "boardgamepublisher": ["Lookout Games"], "maxplaytime": "30", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic290417_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "30", "boardgamecategory": ["Card Game", "Fighting"], "description": "In this game, players fight Dragons with swords and nets.<br/>The 80 numbered playing cards show one of the following:<br/><br/>1 sword<br/>1 net<br/>2 swords<br/>2 nets<br/>1 sword &amp; 1 net<br/><br/>Every dragon card shows 1-5 swords and 0-3 nets.<br/><br/>One dragon is revealed from the dragon pile.

The one with the most &quot;votes&quot; in the end gets elected to high scool president and thus wins the game.<br/><br/>It's a humour-based, hilarious but rather complicated card game where a lot of the enjoyment relies on you knowing the clich&eacute;es in japanese animation concerning high school comedy. Though there's a lot of japanese text on the cards, it's playable without knowledge of japanese if you have a translation sitting nearby. Moreover, you learn what the cards do rather quickly.<br/><br/>Game description<br/>There are two card piles: the play card pile and the &quot;standard vote&quot;-pile. The &quot;standard vote&quot;-pile contains only cards with a number of votes, 1 to 6 on each card. The play card pile consists of special vote cards (can be worth a lot, and also may have special powers), action cards (that affect other players) or event cards (all players have to sumbit to certain conditions).<br/><br/>At your turn, you draw a play card and (unless it's an event card wich affets all players) may either take 2 actions OR draw yet another game card. Actions include drawing a standard vote card, playing a game card from your hand, or using a special power (from your special vote card or your character).<br/><br/>The &quot;standard vote&quot; cards are kept hidden, people can see how many you have but not how much they're worth. The special vote cards however, (which are worth much, representing votes from whole clubs like the baseball team, the newpaper club and so on), are placed before you. These can be &quot;attacked&quot; by action cards, either nullified or stolen. Some action cards can cancel other action cards, and some special votes cards can be immune to attacks like these if you discard cards from your hand etc.<br/><br/>So the game goes on until you've taken 2 laps through the draw pile of game cards. When the fourth event card is drawn, game ends immediately, and the person with most votes win.<br/><br/>As said, much of the flavour of this game consists of clich&eacute;es in high school anime. The names of the standard vote-cards are sometimes hilarious. Some one-vote cards are named &quot;the ghost girl who nobody has ever seen&quot;, &quot;the maid robot&quot;, &quot;the one who secretly goes to a certain market selling certain home made comics&quot;, other cards include &quot;the I don't know whatever&quot; (3 votes), &quot;the ones with a boyfriend&quot; (2 votes), &quot;the diet girls&quot; (4 votes) et cetera. The special vote cards are typical high school clubs in japanese high schools.<br/><br/>A very nice game but probably only for those who enjoy the style.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "3", "boardgameversion": ["Chinese first edition", "Japanese first edition"], "age": "9", "name": "High School Election", "playingtime": "45", "boardgamemechanic": ["Hand Management", "Secret Unit Deployment", "Set Collection", "Voting"], "average": "5.67593", "usersrated": "27", "boardgamefamily": ["Anime & Manga"]}, "26197": {"boardgamedesigner": ["Michel Brancart", "Frederic de Wouters"], "poll": [], "name": "Grailnah", "playingtime": "0", "minplayers": "2", "yearpublished": "2004", "usersrated": "3", "boardgamesubdomain": ["Abstract Games"], "maxplayers": "4", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic156477_t.jpg", "average": "5.33333", "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["Imotep"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic156477.jpg", "boardgameversion": ["First edition"], "maxplaytime": "0", "boardgamecategory": ["Abstract Strategy"], "age": "10", "minplaytime": "0", "description": "The aim of the game is simple: the first player who has one of his Knights land on the center of the board has won in his quest for the Grail.<br/><br/>But be careful - your opponent has the same aim!

The failure of the coup as it had been originally planned gave way to a civil conflict between the defenders of the democratic government and the backers of the military coup. Machado&rsquo;s two Spain's fought each other for nearly three years in a battle which reflected the political and social tensions affecting the world at that time.<br/><br/>The  opposing armies were very different: on one hand, the Republican army possessed a limited number of professional soldiers and many popular militias belonging to political parties and labor unions. To this were added the International Brigades, formed from foreign volunteers of diverse origin; a fighting force which was highly motivated, but poorly coordinated and typically poorly organized. On the other hand, the Franco&acute;s army had most of the professional military, along with Carlist and fascist militias, many native Moroccan troops, and the volunteers of the Condor Legion and the Corpo Trupe Voluntarie, sent by Hitler and Mussolini, respectively.<br/><br/>From a military point of view, the Spanish Civil War presaged the global conflict which would soon erupt. In the mid-1930s, military high commands from all over the globe theorized on the possibilities of motorized armies and &ldquo;lightning war&rdquo;. Both Nazis and Soviets rehearsed armored tactics in Spain, and tested various types of weapons. In addition, the importance that air superiority would have on all later conflicts was made clear. All of these elements make the Spanish Civil War a fascinating conflict from an historical point of view and with regard to military strategy.<br/><br/>To the Barricades!, the first title in the War Storms series, is a game which attempts to simulate, at platoon and company level, the battles which took place on the different fronts of the war.

Each map parallels the other, in that each hex on one map represents the same coordinates, just at a radically different elevation (above or below ground) on the other map. Maps are labeled in columns and rows so that it is possible to find corresponding hexes quickly. Hex B4 on the surface map is considered to be directly above hex B4 on the subterranean map, and so on. It is recommended that a new subterranean map be printed out for each game, so that it can be marked throughout the game and discarded at the end.<br/><br/>Counters represent mobile units such as drill tanks, transport vehicles, hovertanks, missile launchers, atmo-craft, and squads of infantry with jump-jet powered armour; structures such as command posts and drilling stations; extracted resources; and rubble. They are printed with varying information. Resource counters show the type and quantity of resource with a letter and number. Units are printed with a movement type, attack strength, range, defense strength, and movement points.<br/><br/>Elements include tactical level sf combat using a terrain-and-elevation-based combat system, satellite searches for ore deposits, in-game allocation of resources to build units and outposts, resource extraction and re-use, resource allocation towards victory, varying resource value depending on market fluctuations, airstrikes, cave-ins, and underground combat.<br/><br/>"}, "26301": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1149113.jpg", "poll": [], "boardgamedesigner": ["Jean-Jacques Petit"], "statistics": [], "yearpublished": "1984", "maxplayers": "2", "age": "12", "boardgamepublisher": ["Descartes Editeur"], "maxplaytime": "0", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1149113_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "0", "boardgamecategory": ["Wargame", "World War II"], "description": "French board wargame on the fighting of the French Second Armored Division, 2eme Division Blindee, for the Liberation of Paris 24-28 August 1944.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": ["First edition"], "name": "2\u00e8me D.B.

A tree with a bear on it is not removable, and a tree with a rainbow can be removed with any die roll.<br/><br/>"}, "26323": {"boardgamedesigner": ["(Uncredited)"], "poll": [], "name": "Memos", "playingtime": "0", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": ["Memory"], "yearpublished": "0", "usersrated": "0", "maxplayers": "2", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic199945_t.jpg", "average": "0", "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["Guidecraft"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic199945.jpg", "maxplaytime": "0", "boardgamecategory": ["Memory"], "age": "0", "minplaytime": "0", "description": "From the publisher:<br/><br/>Each player takes a turn and lifts off two covers to reveal 10 matching inset pairs.

They go for a premium on earth and you could become rich. But first you better concentrate on paying off your ship.&quot;<br/><br/>In Rocks for Sale, two to five (best for three to five) players fly their space ships along a pick-up and delivery circuit from the assayer's space station to the asteroid belt and back. Players tow asteroids back from the belt and sell them to the assayer, with the eventual goal of being the first to pay off their ship. But there are additional costs to running a mining ship, such as fuel, repairs and blasting charges. Mining in space can also be dangerous. Fuel leaks, overheating engines and other miners' blasting charges are only a few of the hazards an asteroid minor may face.<br/><br/>Will you be the first to pay off your ship?

The smaller air dragon returned the roar and beat its long wings as it began to gain altitude. Vermix was large, a fire dragon of both mighty age and size. With some amusement Vermix mused on the foolish air dragon and how it would perish under his talons and burn with his breath.<br/><br/>Beating his own great wings, the massive fire dragon rose slowly. Meanwhile the swifter air dragon had reached a great height overhead and with a shriek, folded its wings tightly against its sinuous body and dove into Vermix like some blue-grey spear, thrown by an angry god of war.<br/><br/>The two dragons crashed into each other with bone shattering force. Stunned by the impact, Vermix struggled to bite at his foe, but the smaller air dragon had gained a tight grip on the fire dragon's fore legs and was even now ripping at Vermix's armored hide with its own sharp talons.<br/><br/>Finally Vermix turned his great head and bit down on the neck of his foe. The air dragon screamed as Vermix crushed its throat, slaying the smaller dragon in one mighty snap of his jaws. Spitting the dead beast from his maul, Vermix turned his body as it fell, trying to scoop the air up with his wings and to either slow his fall or possibly even pull up from of the deadly plummet out of the skies.<br/><br/>As the ground below rushed up, Vermix began to flap his might pinions once more, beating the air with his massive chest muscles, like belts of iron these muscles struggled to gather the wind about him. Slowly he regained control and turned the headlong fall to his doom into a controlled swoop. As he passed mere inches from the tops of the trees of the forest below him, Vermix issued another roar, letting all that could hear that his was king of the dragons still, and would remain so until another dragon took his life and crown.<br/><br/>This is Dragon Wars, yet another Mini-game from Bad Baby Production.

With an unusual precision, he left his 35-year-old son George without the money. Smith was angry that his son was not married, did not have siblings, and was planning to join the United States Army in the battlefield in Europe during WWI, where he could be possibly killed.<br/><br/>Instead, he signed his inheritance to some unknown great-great-grandchild, to be born in the future, and he died shortly afterward. That made his son change his mind, marry soon, have a son named James, and manage the destiny of his other siblings, so they would keep the family dynasty alive for another three generations in order to get the inheritance.<br/><br/>The family line almost stopped when James's only son David was killed in Vietnam in 1964. His father was forced to remarry, and at the age of 47 he and his new wife Linda had another son, Michael. Michael, now 40, and his wife Jennifer, have two children, Emily, 17, and Jacob, 16, who are the straight heirs of their great-great-grandfather Henry.<br/><br/>The judicial problem with selecting the right heir for billion-dollar assets is that even though the children have agreed to share the money equally, they still must compete with each other, because legally the inheritance should be given to only one: the smartest child.<br/><br/>Rules of competition between Emily and Jacob have been set by the board of trustees, who might hold the funds until the contest is over. Emily and Jacob must square off to find the &quot;smartest heir&quot; - by winning the chess-style card game called &quot;The Heirs&quot;.<br/><br/>DESCRIPTION:<br/><br/>The pack of genealogical playing cards called &quot;Six Generations&quot; will be used to play &quot;The Heirs&quot;. Instead of using the entire 72 card deck, &quot;The Heirs&quot; will be played with only 32 cards numbered 1 to 5.<br/><br/>The playing field consists of 32 squares having 4 rows and 8 columns on it. The total playable size of the field is 15&rdquo; x 20&rdquo; (38 x 50 cm.)<br/><br/>Two players, one of them helping Emily and the other helping Jacob, must open cards placed at random with all their ancestors in four generations and have them join in the thrilling fight for the inheritance.<br/><br/>All cards with black numbers (men) will help Jacob, and the red cards (women) will help Emily to win. The number on each card represents a generation of relatives in the family.<br/> 2 cards from generation #1 are Emily and Jacob, brother and sister, by themselves.<br/> Generation #2 with also two cards is their parents, Jennifer and Michael.<br/><br/>Generation #3 - 4 cards &ndash; represents the children&rsquo;s grandparents - Mary, Linda, James and Robert.<br/><br/>8 cards from generation #4 are their great grandparents - Margaret, Helen, Mildred, Dorothy, George, William, Joseph and John.<br/><br/>And 16 cards from generation #5 are their 16 great-great grandparents including Henry Smith. Their names are Florence, Minnie, Elizabeth, Lillian, Emma, Marie, Alice, Martha, Henry, Harry, Harold, Edward, Walter, Arthur, Frank and Albert.<br/><br/>UNDERSTANDING THE GAME:<br/><br/>According to the story, a family member of the younger generation makes a genealogical search. They then meet in person or find the record of a relative from the same or older generation.<br/><br/>To get the inheritance, Emily and Jacob must prove their relation to Henry Smith, their great-great grandfather. They need to provide a list of all their 30 ancestors in four older generations as well as prove to trustees that they are the only two surviving heirs among his great-great grandchildren.<br/><br/>BEFORE STARTING THE GAME, TWO PLAYERS MUST DO THE FOLLOWING:<br/><br/>1. Decide who will get black cards (men) and who will get red cards (women);<br/><br/>2. Decide who will start the game first;<br/><br/>3. Withdraw 40 cards with numbers &quot;6&quot; from the original Six Generations deck, because they are unusable in &quot;The Heirs&quot; card game;<br/><br/>4. One player must shuffle the remaining 32 cards (with numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, 5) and place them in random order face down on the board or the desk in four rows and eight columns. No one should see the face of the cards.<br/><br/>TIP:  During the game try be accurate always keeping the rows and columns with the cards straight.<br/><br/>RULES:<br/><br/>1. The player can make only one move at a time during the turn.<br/>2. The player who was not able to move a card during his or her turn loses the game.<br/><br/>NOTES:<br/><br/>A. If both players are unable to make a move simultaneously, then the player whose turn it is at that time loses the game!<br/><br/>B. If it is your turn to play but you do not have any card of your color on the board - you lose!<br/><br/>EACH PLAYER CAN MOVE A CARD IN THREE DIFFERENT WAYS:<br/><br/>1. The player can simply turn over any card face up. Since there are 32 cards in the game, each player can make at least 16 moves by turning a card face up.<br/><br/>2. If two cards of the opposite colors (black and red) have already been opened in the previous moves, and they have common border from top, bottom, left or right of each other, then the player whose card has a lower or the same number can replace the card of the opposite color by moving their own card to the other card&rsquo;s square. The replaced card has to be discarded from the game and set aside face down.<br/><br/>NOTES:<br/><br/>A.  The same move can be done even if there are several empty squares between the two cards.<br/><br/>B.  The cards should not replace each other if they are attached only by the corners.<br/><br/>C.  Card #1 can replace any card of the opposite color. Card #2 can replace cards from #2 to #5 of the opposite color. Card #3 can replace cards from #3 to #5 of the opposite color. Card #4 can replace cards #4 and #5 of the opposite color. Card #5 can replace only card #5 of the opposite color.<br/><br/>D.  A player whose cards are red can replace only black cards with red cards. A player who is playing with black cards can replace only a red card with a black card.<br/><br/>E.  During this move the player does not need to open any new card.<br/><br/>F.  If there are one or more combinations on the board when one card may replace another card, the player can either choose any combination or can ignore them all and instead open a new card.<br/><br/>G.  The players should not review the discarded cards after the move is done.<br/><br/>H.  If all the cards have been opened already, replacing the correct bordering card becomes the only option for the player.<br/><br/>3. The player can make a move as a combination of moves #1 and #2. If the player has opened a new card which borders with a card of the opposite color from the top, bottom, left or right, (which has already been opened), and if one of those cards, which belongs to the player, can replace the other card, then the player can immediately replace another card in the same move.<br/><br/>NOTES:<br/><br/>A.  This move can be done only between a few cards, one of which is a newly opened card.<br/><br/>B.  If the player decided to open a new card, but there were possibilities of replacing one or more cards on the board before the new card has been opened, those opportunities would be lost and may not be executed during the same move.<br/><br/>GAME STRATEGIES:<br/><br/>- The most important is to save moves for yourself for the end of the game, and to take this opportunity away from the other player.<br/> - Save and protect the cards with the more powerful, lower numbers (like &ldquo;1&rdquo; or &ldquo;2&rdquo;) because they will help you to make more moves at the end.<br/> - Try to block other players&rsquo; best cards inside the cards with the same color so they will not be movable.<br/> - Leave the other players&rsquo; best cards alone on one row or a column, not letting them make any moves.<br/> - As soon as you start memorizing the cards which have been replaced and discarded, and start predicting all the possible moves of the other player and yourself, (usually at the end of the game) you will be at the right place to win. Your memory is your helper.<br/><br/>GOOD LUCK! And don't mess with the cards, neither cheat or misplace them. The trustee is watching you...

Some years later a second edition rulebook was published that gave more options for the Tyche cards. Successors III builds on the foundation of the Successors II rules set plus expansion cards that appeared in the Boardgamer. Minor refinements have been made to make the game easier to play and increase enjoyment. The map is very similar to the original with some minor changes around Macedonia. Counters have the same excellent artwork for the generals and new GMT artwork for the combat units and control markers. The Tyche cards have received the most changes&mdash;nearly every card has had some minor modifications and a few new cards have been added.<br/><br/>In addition to the changes, the rules have been cleaned up and improved.

Beginning with Chandragupta Maurya&rsquo;s victories over the Nanda clan, the game follows the brief but rapid rise of the Mauryan dynasty, from Chandragupta&rsquo;s expulsion of Seleucus from the Indus river valley to the conquest of the last independent kingdom on the subcontinent, Kalinga, by his grandson Ashoka.  The Mauryan empire became the largest and most powerful in India&rsquo;s history &ndash; a distinction that would remain unchallenged until the arrival of the Mughals some 1,700 years later.<br/><br/>Chandragupta simulates the traditional &ldquo;four-fold&rdquo; division of the Indian military system, with the elephant corps reigning supreme, and the hordes of light infantry regarded as little more than fodder for chariots&rsquo; wheels and trampling pachyderms.  Chariots still play a prominent role on the Indian battlefield of the era, but the cavalry, with its versatility and endurance, is a potent competitor.  In Chandragupta, victory goes to the commander who can master the unique aspects of the differing Indian military &ldquo;classes&rdquo; &ndash; the professional, lifelong soldiers called Maulas, the mercenary levies, unpredictable tribal allies, and the militias of the powerful trade guilds.  While Maulas and mercenaries are commanded under a single hierarchical command structure, the tribals and the trade guilds are led by independent chiefs.<br/><br/>Units include cataphracted elephants, &ldquo;heavy&rdquo; four- (and sometimes eight-!) wheeled chariots, and even an &ldquo;elCH&rdquo; unit &ndash; yes, elephant-pulled chariots.  Rules include Combined Chariot/Infantry and Elephant/Infantry lines, Dharmayudda or &ldquo;just&rdquo; warfare, Guild enmity, and Tribal loyalty.  EL units can even breach camp walls and pull down city gates (if they don&rsquo;t rampage first).<br/><br/>Fans of GBoH will appreciate the exciting variety in Chandragupta&rsquo;s scenarios, from huge set-piece battles on flat plains, to tribal suppressions, a night assault on a military camp, and street fighting in the city of Takshashila.  Chandragupta is the 13th volume in the series.<br/><br/>Battles:<br/><br/><br/>     Pataliputra (319 BC) &ndash; Chandragupta&rsquo;s mentor, the Brahmin Chanakya, brashly challenges the Nanda dynasty with a cadre of mercenaries.<br/>     Maghada (317 BC) &ndash; Chandragupta again confronts the Nandas, who are this time led by the formidable general Bhadrasala.<br/>     Mayalaketu (317 BC) &ndash; Chanakya attacks the turncoat general Mayalaketu and his rebel army in camp.<br/>     Takshashila (316 BC) &ndash; the Thracian general Eudamus, allied to Indian king Ambhi, defends the city of Takshashila against Chandragupta&rsquo;s assault.<br/>     Gandhara (304 BC) &ndash; former officer of Alexander the Great, now &ldquo;Master of Babylonia,&rdquo; Seleucus I Nicator crosses the Indus river to invade Gandhara, and is confronted by the Mauryan army at the river&rsquo;s banks.<br/>     Revolt in the Provinces (275 BC) &ndash; Chandragupta&rsquo;s grandson, Ashoka, brings a relief force to lift a rebel siege of Takshashila and rescue the aging Chanakya who is holed up in the city&rsquo;s palace.<br/>     Khashas (274 BC) &ndash; Chandragupta&rsquo;s son, Bhindusara, puts down a confederation of the independent Khasha kings with an attack on their mountain strongholds.<br/>     Kalinga (261 BC) &ndash; the most famous battle of the Mauryan era, Ashoka&rsquo;s army attacks the kingdom of Kalinga in a huge &ndash; and bloody -- set-piece battle.<br/><br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": ["First edition"], "average": "7.62554", "name": "Chandragupta", "playingtime": "240", "boardgamemechanic": ["Dice Rolling", "Hex-and-Counter"], "age": "12", "usersrated": "101", "boardgamesubdomain": ["Wargames"], "boardgamefamily": ["Country: India", "Great Battles of History"]}, "26459": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic507588.jpg", "poll": [], "boardgamedesigner": ["Chris Janiec"], "statistics": [], "yearpublished": "2009", "maxplayers": "2", "boardgameartist": ["Nicol\u00e1s Eskubi", "Charles Kibler", "Rodger B.

PQ-17 highlights the impact of reconnaissance, fuel, and the extreme climate without the drawbacks of a double-blind system or tedious bookkeeping.<br/><br/>Each of the 1&quot; square ship counters in the game depicts an individual capital ship or cruiser or a group of smaller ships, submarines, or merchant vessels. Virtually every vessel that sailed arctic waters in 1942 is included, along with others that fought (or might have) in key actions. Counters are formatted much like the units in traditional block wargames, allowing step reduction to show damage or reduced numbers without cumbersome markers or rosters. These large counters never appear on the map, however; they remain off-map on players' Task Force Displays until battle is joined.<br/><br/>Instead, players maneuver blocks on a mapboard stretching from Greenland and Ireland to Kiel and the Kara Sea. Each block is a force of submarines or surface ships, its identity hidden from the enemy player until it is located by a successful search and the block is turned up. It may represent one ship or one hundred - or none at all, as it may be a dummy. Reconnaissance is critical, as you must locate the enemy in order to attack him. Cards are used to resolve searches quickly and efficiently: a successful search yields intelligence of varying accuracy, while failure to relocate the enemy in a timely manner results in lost contact and generation of another dummy.<br/><br/>Players must also cope with fuel restrictions, reflecting limited endurance (particularly for destroyers) and Axis shortages. Simple rules and the use of markers on the Task Force Displays preclude the need for record keeping while preventing unrealistic freedom of action.<br/><br/>To show the key role of air power in the campaign, PQ-17 also includes over 100 air units. Circular counters represent RAF Coastal Command and Fleet Air Arm squadrons and Luftwaffe Staffeln and Gruppen that participated in naval operations in the theater, as well as selected air defense units. Many VVS air regiments are also included, along with the USAAF squadrons that defended Iceland.<br/><br/>Because the focus of the game is operational, battles are fought on an abstract Combat Display. Simple procedures and multiple Combat Results Tables reproduce historical levels of damage from all forms of combat: submarine attacks, antisubmarine warfare, bombing and aerial torpedo attacks, anti-aircraft fire, air-to-air combat, and naval surface actions.<br/><br/>PQ-17's environmental model is based upon historical meteorological and oceanographic records to accurately reflect the extreme conditions and their effects. Summer operations, conducted in round-the-clock daylight, play much differently than those undertaken in the near-total darkness of winter. The polar ice pack advances and ebbs with the seasons, varying the sea routes available and posing a hazard for naval forces venturing too close. And besides each other, players must also battle some of the worst weather in the world, potentially damaging their ships and affecting movement, searches, and combat.<br/><br/>PQ-17 features nine historical scenarios, including all the major actions of the campaign: the Fleet Air Arm torpedo attack on Tirpitz, the decimation of convoy PQ-17, the climactic battle of PQ-18, the Battle of the Barents Sea, and the 1943 Battle of North Cape. To add uncertainty, each side is subject to a special condition in every operation, which may impose additional requirements or restrictions - or afford additional opportunities - while remaining secret from the opponent. Just like their historical counterparts, Allied players can never be certain that the Germans will not attempt to break out into the Atlantic with one or more heavy ships, and Axis players must beware of a possible attack on Norway; both players may face conflicting priorities and demands that must be met with limited resources. In addition, a 1942 &quot;random&quot; scenario enhances replay value by further disguising starting forces and objectives. Each operational scenario can be played to conclusion in 3-4 hours, and for players seeking a richer experience, a 1942 campaign scenario reflects the challenges of continuing operations over the course of this key year.<br/><br/>Game Components<br/><br/><br/>     One 22x34&quot; map <br/>     58 15mm blocks <br/>     140 1&quot; square counters <br/>     140 1/2&quot; square counters <br/>     136 circular counters in three sizes <br/>     80 cards <br/>     One 24-page Rule Book <br/>     One 20-page Scenario Book <br/>     Two 11x17&quot; + one or two 8.5x11&quot; Play Aids <br/>     Two 8.5x11&quot; Task Force Displays <br/>     One 8.5x11&quot; Battle Display <br/>     Five 10-sided Dice <br/><br/><br/>Old Home Page at Publisher: <a target='_blank' href='http://www.gmtgames.com/pq17/main.html' rel='nofollow'>http://www.gmtgames.com/pq17/main.html</a><br/>New Home Page at Publisher: <a target='_blank' href='http://www.gmtgames.com/p-126-pq-17.aspx' rel='nofollow'>http://www.gmtgames.com/p-126-pq-17.aspx</a><br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": ["English first edition"], "average": "7.14333", "name": "PQ-17: Arctic Naval Operations 1941-43", "playingtime": "210", "boardgamemechanic": ["Dice Rolling", "Hex-and-Counter", "Secret Unit Deployment", "Simulation"], "age": "0", "boardgameexpansion": ["130958"], "usersrated": "165", "boardgamesubdomain": ["Wargames"], "boardgamefamily": ["Arctic Theme", "Block wargames"]}, "26460": {"boardgamedesigner": ["(Uncredited)"], "poll": [], "name": "Tumble Bumble Game", "playingtime": "20", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": ["Pick-up and Deliver", "Simultaneous Action Selection"], "yearpublished": "1970", "usersrated": "1", "maxplayers": "4", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic226120_t.jpg", "average": "7", "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["Ideal"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic226120.jpg", "boardgameversion": ["First edition"], "maxplaytime": "20", "boardgamecategory": ["Action / Dexterity"], "age": "0", "minplaytime": "20", "description": "&quot;THEY TUMBLE DOWN, IT'S A FUNNY SIGHT<br/>TRYING TO FIND THE HOLE THAT'S RIGHT!&quot;<br/><br/>From the box:<br/><br/>The Bumbles tumble down the slides onto the rink.

The question quickly arose; which topic, era, theater etc. should our second volume cover? We wanted something limited in scope, but that would offer a good number of ping-pong table sized battles. We also prefer to do subjects that have not been yet covered in miniatures. Island War came immediately to mind. The battles of the Pacific islands would certainly provide the proper size actions and only a game of Great Battles scope could cover the forces and time scales needed. Finally, we could include a Canadian action (Hong Kong) - always a bonus in our view. There was also German operations in Poland, France and the Mediterranean. Finally, of course there was the whole Eastern Front to choose from. We felt, however, that we should experiment more with the system before we wrote the definitive scenario book for WWII miniatures gamers - the Steppes of Russia.<br/><br/>I think it was Marcel Van der Sleen who first floated the idea that Great Battles was the perfect vehicle to present airborne actions. He had done a fair bit of work on Operation Market Garden and insisted that Great Battle's scope and time scale could be worked into three or four linked scenarios leading to a grand-campaign that would reflect the whole operation. In addition, Marcel claimed that very few adjustments would be needed. The movement, combat and morale would be left unchanged. We had already worked with the basic organizations in Canadians in Europe. He was correct. Great Battles remained unchanged, throughout the project. The only differences were the additions of landing rules and the use of activation cards instead of a set number of activation points.<br/><br/>Once into the research, I found that not only did the airborne operations offer interesting scenarios, but there was &quot;a little bit for everyone&quot;. There are air-drops of course but also tank-to-tank confrontations, elite units, militia units, street fighting, battalion operations, division operation and even corps operations. In addition, the Operations Mercury (Crete) and Operation Market Garden (Holland) could be linked into a grand campaign using defined battlefields (ping-pong tables) but allowing for area-to-area movement between tables - a rarity in miniatures gaming.<br/><br/>Ultimately, we feel that Drop Zone offers a different type of miniatures scenarios. Those that have played Canadians in Europe will immediately notice the difference, in texture, between the set-piece co-ordinated attack-defend actions and the tenuous, nail-biting to-and-fro of an airborne operation. For those who have not played the other scenarios in this series, be prepared for a new gaming experience. Your games will not simulate a 40 minute fight for the local farmhouse or crossroads. Instead, you will have to plan a multi-day operation - to land parachute brigades or even divisions behind enemy lines and then relieve them. Great Battles puts you in the general's chair where deployment and activation of forces, weather, supply, recovery and reinforcements artillery and air support are more important than the penetrating power of a shell or the armor thickness of a turret.<br/><br/>We are quite proud of Drop Zone and very pleased that Great Battles has made the transition to this new topic with such ease. We look forward to exploring other eras and theaters with Great Battles of World War II.<br/><br/>"}, "26479": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic160390.jpg", "poll": [], "boardgamedesigner": ["Robert Hemminger"], "statistics": [], "yearpublished": "2006", "maxplayers": "4", "boardgameartist": ["Robert Hemminger"], "boardgamepublisher": ["Avalon Games"], "maxplaytime": "0", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic160390_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "0", "boardgamecategory": ["Expansion for Base-game", "Print & Play", "Science Fiction"], "description": "Armored Assault is the first expansion to Battle Armor.<br/><br/>Jones ducked back into the gravity tank as the communication link started blasting orders.
