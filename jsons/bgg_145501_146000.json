From fantasy games and movies, to famous plays, like Goethe&rsquo;s Faust, and even documents such as the infamous Key of Solomon said to provide instructions on the real means by which to summon such creatures.

With in-depth rules for each step of the process, providing mechanical support and flavorful information that not only provides a solid framework for performing such summoning rituals, but actually makes them dynamic, challenging, and, if done properly, very rewarding.<br/><br/>While the fiend summoning rules work with all kind of evil outsiders (and, in fact, specific information is provided for using them in conjunction with every type of evil outsider from all three Pathfinder bestiaries), they truly shine in conjunction with fiends made specifically to take advantage of them, such as the seventy-two new unique fiendish lords found in this book. Each of these storied evil outsiders was inspired by one of the demons listed in the famous Key of Solomon, but have been greatly expanded, not only with a detailed statistics entry (each and every one of which has at least one unique ability not seen anywhere else), a flavorful background section, and details on the hellish realm over which they rule, but also with special, unique boons that they can grant in conjunction with the summoning rules found in this book.<br/><br/>With over 72 new monsters (or potential allies), and detailed rules on how to call, bind, and bargain with fiends (as well as information on what happens when such things go wrong), The Deluxe Guide to Fiend Summoning and Faustian Bargains is the ultimate authority on all things fiendish, and a handy tool for GMs and players alike.

The goal of the development was to create an aesthetically attractive area in which large companies could perform their R&amp;D with physical and political privacy. Though the original tenants were diverse, large pharmaceutical firms eventually dominated the region pushing out all commerce that did not support their functioning. These firms still stand, though most have branched out into related fields such as genetic engineering and mega-agriculture. The ever-looming influence of the Bible Belt plus <br/>good old Southern tradition prevented 'artificial' life technologies such as cybernetics or electronic subdermal implants from taking root in favor of more 'natural' or 'organic' methods. Attaching a bionic arm may be a social faux pas, but regrowing one using 'all-natural' and 'locally produced' pharmaceuticals (actually synthesized from various non-native plant and animal species raised in a lab or greenhouse) seems perfectly fine around these parts. In fact, it's quite amazing what folks will accept as &ldquo;natural&rdquo; sometimes.<br/><br/>ENVIRONMENT<br/>Residents of the Triangle take great pride in what they call their 'pristine wildernesses.' Most of the time these supposed 'preservations' are in fact built around megacorp headquarters or universities, both as a display of influence and a buffer against spies, protesters and the government. Stray too far and you will soon end up in what's now simply called the Interior &ndash; the former cities of Raleigh, Durham, Cary, Morrisville, Carrboro and Chapel Hill. This sprawling mass of haphazard urban <br/>planning houses most of the middle and lower class populations and service industries. While not terribly dirty, the Interior is vastly overcrowded and unpleasant to view since much of the original natural beauty was transplanted for 'protection.'<br/><br/>SOCIETY<br/>The relative affluence of the Triangle during the difficult economic times of the early 21st century attracted a wide variety of emigrants from across wildly different cultures and backgrounds. Unfortunately, some of these cultures did not mesh well together and racial tensions reignited, further aggravated by a new structure of ethnic social stratification. Well-educated immigrants from East Asia &ndash; particularly Chinese and Indian &ndash; took the lion's share of the high-paying technical pharmaceutical work. The &ldquo;native&rdquo; population, most of which had some combination of Caucasian, African and Hispanic heritage, failed to catch up to the rapidly progressing technology and were largely relegated to unskilled labor. Reaction to the Asian immigration influx created 'purist' groups among each of the various &quot;native&quot; ethnicities. The purist groups tend to be small due to the difficulty of proving single-ethnic heritage but the few that exist can be vicious.<br/><br/>"}, "145531": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1725660.jpg", "poll": {}, "boardgamedesigner": {"25": {"name": "Richard Borg"}}, "statistics": {}, "yearpublished": "2013", "maxplayers": "0", "age": "10", "boardgamepublisher": {"1466": {"name": "Zvezda"}}, "maxplaytime": "60", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1725660_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "60", "boardgamecategory": {"1042": {"name": "Expansion for Base-game"}}, "description": "Game description from the publisher:<br/><br/>Bodyguards rattled their weapons on the other side of the wall as the Shogun mumbled something in his sleep.

The alliances of the world&rsquo;s major nations seemed to change every moment. The American Armed Forces needed to devise plans for any number of possible sudden conflicts. Scenarios were written based on current equipment, technology, and strategy. The Washington treaty of 1922 that limited the tonnage of ships for the major navies never happened. The military&rsquo;s solution was WAR PLAN.<br/><br/>War Plan: Orange was the code name given to the Navy&rsquo;s scenarios dealing with a threat from Japan. Plan Orange was constantly modified as new ships, aircraft, technology, and strategies were improved. Equipment available to both sides at this time would have been fascinating to see in use, as is the focus of this game.<br/><br/>This will be the first of a series of &ldquo;War Plan&rdquo; games from Historical Board Gaming. This boxed game will come complete with all components needed to play. Fight the intense battles between the Japanese and American Navies during the early 1930&rsquo;s that never were. Utilizing fantasy ships like the Lexington Class battle-cruiser as designed before it was converted to an aircraft carrier, and the Colorado class Battleship that was scrapped before building, the American forces will take on Japanese ships like the Tosa, Amagi, Kii, and No. 13 Class Battleships as well as the infamous 3-flight deck versions of Kaga and Akagi. These beautiful ships, as well as aircraft and airships, will be represented in this game with actual plastic ships, planes, and airships based on designs from pre World War II. With pieces that match the scale of other famous games in the genre, fight the Plan Orange scenarios and then add them together with other games to make your own!

After fighting different Bull Demon minions, the climax of the game is the battle against the Bull Demon King. Game cards and custom dice combine for fast, tense action and critical choices enhance the Pilgrims&rsquo; skills during the game. All components have been crafted to the highest quality, bringing the beautiful game world to life. Resin versions of the miniatures will be of special interest to painters and collectors.<br/><br/>Journey is designed for 1 to 4 players, each controlling one of the four Pilgrims: Tripitaka, Monkey, Monk Sha and Cho Hakkai. The game's AI controls the Demons and other creatures. Diverse playing styles are possible, with a strong emphasis on cooperation because the players win or lose as a team. Each game will take 30 minutes to 2 hours, depending on the quest and the style you play.<br/><br/>The core game comes with ~10 quests, each with different goals and unique rules. Do you ruthlessly hack and slash, killing all demons in the Pilgrims' path? Or take a more virtuous path, cleansing the demons' souls, saving villagers and collecting good karma. Your decisions affect the Pilgrims' abilities, skills and equipment. Killing demons may be quick but can you risk accumulating that bad karma? Side quests may enhance your Pilgrims' skill and karma, but with more demons spawning, can you afford to spend that time?<br/><br/>Solo play is almost identical to multi-player games. Instead of multiple players controlling 1 or 2 pilgrims each, 1 player will control all four Pilgrims. There are no other changes to the game whatsoever!<br/><br/>Many games have science fiction or fantasy settings, but Chinese mythology is a rich and beautiful environment that is under represented in games. This setting gives Journey a large pool of art, architecture, mythology, and drama to draw upon. The striking map tiles, tokens, cards and highly detailed miniatures capture the Pilgrims and their world perfectly. But the themes run much deeper - skills, weapons, harmful conditions, custom dice and the Karma game mechanic stay true to the environment, fully immersing the players in the game world.<br/><br/>This is only the start of the Pilgrims' journey.

Two-to-four players are pitted against one another as one of the four main powers on the Western Front.  You will command both common and specialist troops from the armies of Britain and France or Germany and Austro-Hungary, including soldiers distinctly unique to each.<br/><br/>Every play-through will be different.  Hazards are deployed before the start of each match, including barbed wire and craters.  The mechanics for every weapon is distinctly different.  The Maxim and Vickers guns will chew an arc across the board.  Snipers will pick off single targets daring or foolish enough to step up to the edge of their trench.  Riflemen will make their slow, bolt-action attacks or grapple in melee combat with bayonets and hand-to-hand weapons until one comes out the survivor.<br/><br/>Combat outcomes, be they melee or ranged, will be decided with alterable randomness.  The default chances to hit are decided between the unit&rsquo;s skill and cards drawn from the deck.  Each player is dealt a new hand of cards at the start of each of the eight turns.  First the attacker has the opportunity to influence an event where the random card drawn is not in their favor.  The player can choose the card best suited from their hand to turn it in their favor.  In return, the defender can then counter, if they so choose, with a better suited card they choose from their own hand.  This influencing with cards can go back and forth until one player runs out of cards or decides they have expended enough.  It will be a bloody day along the trench.  Will it be that of your soldiers or the enemy&rsquo;s?<br/><br/>Adding to the replay potential are the missions that players will be issued to complete.  Players could be tasked to capture and hold locations in the dangerous No Man&rsquo;s Land, to make hazardous excursions to retrieve pilots and the film from downed biplanes, or even going Over the Top to seize the enemy&rsquo;s trench.  Each of these missions, and others, change the nature of the experience.  The tactics to cover a sortie to a biplane won&rsquo;t work to invade the enemy&rsquo;s trench.

That said, the game differs in a number of ways from Mr. Jack. In more detail...<br/><br/>In Le Fant&ocirc;me de l&rsquo;Op&eacute;ra, eight suspect tokens stand in the ten rooms of the Op&eacute;ra Garnier. Each suspect has a reason to drive the opera singer La Carlotta away from the production, and at the start of the game one of the suspects is randomly determined to be the true identity of the Phantom player. The other player is the Investigator, and he wants to discover the Phantom's identity; if he does so before La Carlotta flees the Op&eacute;ra Garnier, then he wins. Otherwise, he loses. (To balance play between newcomers and experienced players La Carlotta's starting position can changed.)<br/><br/>At the start of each odd round, eight suspect cards are shuffled and four of them revealed. The Investigator moves one suspect and (likely) uses this suspect's unique ability, then the Phantom moves two of the remaining three suspects, then the Investigator moves the final suspect. The Phantom player then reveals whether he can or cannot cause a disturbance in the Op&eacute;ra Garnier, thus scaring La Carlotta; he can cause a disturbance only if he's alone or if he's in the room with the blackout token. If he can cause a disturbance, the Investigator clears all suspects sharing a lit room; if not, the Investigator clears all suspects in the dark or on their own. After this, La Carlotta moves one step closer to fleeing for each suspect that hasn't been declared innocent (and an additional step if the Phantom did create a disturbance).<br/><br/>For each even round, the remaining four suspect cards are revealed, and the players again move characters and use their special abilities, with the Phantom going first. The game continues until only a single suspect is not innocent or La Carlotta flees France for the safety of Milan.<br/><br/>When a character moves, it can move up to as many spaces as the number of characters in the room from which it moves. Most characters can move only through open corridors, but Meg Giry can use secret passageways that connect many of the rooms. The players must use Meg's ability and the other characters' special abilities to hide or reveal information. One character, for example, moves a padlock that blocks one corridor, while another is responsible for the roaming blackout that allows the Phantom to operate in darkness (or at least provide cover for his activity elsewhere). One sweet character can draw everyone from adjacent rooms to her side, while an unpleasant fellow can drive everyone away. Still another reveals (or hides) an alibi card, clearing one suspect (or keeping his true nature unknown). Every character is useful in the right situation. You just have to learn what those situations are...<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": {"214877": "Multilingual first edition"}, "average": "7.10596", "name": "Le Fant\u00f4me de l'Op\u00e9ra", "playingtime": "30", "boardgamemechanic": {"2676": "Grid Movement"}, "age": "9", "usersrated": "831", "boardgamesubdomain": {"5499": "Family Games"}, "boardgamefamily": {"11006": "Country: France"}}, "145646": {"statistics": {}, "name": "Boom Town", "videogamemode": {"2149": "Single-Player"}, "videogameversion": {"214879": "Web Browser edition"}, "average": "0", "videogametheme": {"2511": "Business / Construction"}, "usersrated": "0", "videogamegenre": {"2156": "Simulation"}, "videogameplatform": {"5084": "Web Browser"}, "poll": {}, "description": " User Summary <br/><br/>In Boom Town you join the gold rush and your starting truck is all you have.

In the game, the players take on the roles of commanding forces on opposite sides of the conflict.<br/><br/>One player leads the extraterrestrial conquerors whose goal is to transform the Earth and subjugate its inhabitants. The Invaders possess unthinkable weapons and unknowable technologies. More so, within their galactic armada the aliens hold bound a terrifying array of eldritch creatures engineered specifically to sow the chaos and destruction that heralds the arrival of their masters.<br/><br/>The other player commands the unyielding forces of a united Earth. In the shadow of a planet-wide scourge, the nations of the Earth have joined forces to confront the arrival of a doom spawned on the other side of the galaxy. The Terran alliance is a desperation-forged bulwark upon which the invading forces crash and are repelled time and again. Outgunned, with salvaged or untested technology and one foot in the grave, the determined network of military machinery, elite strike-teams, warfare scientists, and neighborhood militias are surprisingly capable of bloodying the Invaders' noses whenever the two forces meet.<br/><br/>The eponymous Invaders seek to destroy the forces defending the Earth and exhaust their reserves. They do this by defeating the defending forces at key locations while also causing the Earth player to disrupt cards from their deck to their discard pile. The Invader must be cunning when deploying their creatures and war-machines, or enacting their schemes, as the cost to bring assets into the war often involves the discarding of other assets.<br/><br/>Mankind must work desperately to defend critical resources and locations from the corruption and incursion of the alien threat. They do this by building formidable and deadly defenses, predicting where the alien player will strike and setting traps designed to deprive the Invaders of key units and wear-down their options. Like the Invader, the humans need to be clever in what they deploy and how they deploy it because their heroes may be bold but they are small in number, and the Invaders are inexorable.<br/><br/>Invaders is a science-fiction game piled thick with the trappings of war and horror. It is steeped in difficult decisions, but built upon a simple, elegant set of rules, and because of this, you will find each game telling a slightly different story each time you play. Both sides use cards to represent their units, plans, resources and events, but as this is an asymmetrical battle game, the way in which those cards are played and how they forward their owner's goals are very different. Regardless, knowing when to let an asset go in favor of a better one, how to exploit a weakness in your enemy's ranks, and where to press an advantage or feint a trap will be key in seeing your side emerge as the victor from the morass of galactic war.<br/><br/>One question remains: Which side are YOU on?<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": {"214892": "Multilingual first edition"}, "average": "7.00932", "name": "Invaders", "playingtime": "60", "boardgamemechanic": {"2040": "Hand Management"}, "age": "12", "boardgameexpansion": {}, "usersrated": "249", "boardgamesubdomain": {"5497": "Strategy Games"}, "boardgamefamily": {"5679": "Aliens"}}, "145655": {"rpg": {"4630": "ICONS"}, "poll": {}, "name": "Badwater Knight", "rpgproducer": {"35649": "Dan Houser"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1727179.jpg", "usersrated": "0", "rpgitemversion": {"214900": "PDF version"}, "average": "0", "statistics": {}, "rpggenre": {"171": "Action / Adventure (Superheroes)"}, "rpgcategory": {"2108": "Sourcebook (rules/options to enhance play)"}, "rpgseries": {"19601": "Justice Wheels"}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1727179_t.jpg", "description": "From publisher blurb:<br/><br/>Justice Wheels #21  features Badwater Knight, a modern day Templar Knight who fights the forces of the supernatural from the back of an airboat in the Louisiana Bayou.

Neither version will require constant external chart look ups or other methods that can slow down a game&rsquo;s pace. With Cuttin&rsquo; Down the Nets all of the action comes from each team&rsquo;s rating sheet.<br/><br/>Let me stress that this is NOT a quick play game. All action is resolved possession-by-possession, just as in real basketball. With the simplified method, you are tracking only the team&rsquo;s score and fouls which allows for quicker game times. However, you&rsquo;ll still visually see why a team wins or loses. With Cuttin&rsquo; Down the Nets each team&rsquo;s card is formulated to accurately replicate all aspects of a team&rsquo;s play. Each team is rated offensively for field goal percentage, three point shooting, propensity to commit turnovers, ability to get open shots, propensity to commit offensive fouls, free throw shooting, offensive rebounding, and ability to hit contested shots. On the defensive side, each team is rated for their ability to contest shots, propensity to commit fouls, ability to force turnovers, defensive rebounding ability, and two point and three point field goal percentage allowed.<br/><br/>Cuttin&rsquo; Down the Nets also features a unique Power System that incorporates strength of schedule as well as home court advantage. With the Power System you can accurately match-up power house teams against the cupcakes and be assured that the results will mirror real life.<br/><br/>The advanced game features all of the above, but also brings individual players into the mix. Every player for every team is accurately rated to perform as they did in the college basketball season. Cuttin&rsquo; Down the Nets features a unique system that doesn&rsquo;t require manual substitutions on the part of the gamer. This system means that you don&rsquo;t have to track player minutes or other minutia for realistic performances. With Cuttin&rsquo; Down the Nets every player will perform as they did during the college season. You&rsquo;ll have nights where your starters are &ldquo;off&rdquo; and nights where a bench player provides a spark, leading your team to victory.<br/><br/>And while the substitutions are handled within the game engine, don&rsquo;t think that coaching decisions were left out. As the coach, you decide when to implement the full-court press. You&rsquo;ll decide when to &ldquo;sag&rdquo; to stop the opponent&rsquo;s inside game or stretch your defense to pressure the perimeter shooters. On offense you decide the pace in which your team plays. Do you fast break, or use the entire clock to limit the opponent&rsquo;s possessions? Best of all, each coaching option is just that, and option. If you have designs on being the next great college coach, you can implement them all. If you prefer to watch the game unfold, you can implement none.

The rest of the players play Hero&rsquo;s foes, fight a round of combat, and then the next player plays his Hero. Hence, only one player is playing a Hero at a time while the rest play his foes. If a player is playing Hero&rsquo;s foes, their Hero is currently inactive and doesn&rsquo;t factor into play. The Hero wins renown points by defeating his enemies. There are various victory conditions (the first player to reach 40 renown, the last player with a surviving Hero, or the last player with cards left to play wins the game).<br/><br/>Each player starts with one Hero card, a foe deck and a draw deck. Players randomly decide who will go first. That player becomes the active player, and places his Hero card in the center of the table and is considered to be playing the Hero. All players then draw cards form their draw deck and play begins. The Hero player then can place into play any allies and locations that he or she might have and also place items and weapons on his Hero card for use them in the upcoming combat. Whether or not cards can be placed into play depends on several factors, but the main mechanic for both foes and the Hero is their pool of prowess points. Most cards have a prowess cost that gets subtracted from this pool in order to place a card into play.<br/><br/>Then the foes draw from their foe deck a number of cards partly based upon how many much renown the Hero has. For every foe the Hero kills, that player places that foes card into the area known as the chronicle. Each foe has a renown score, and the total of all the felled&rsquo; foes renown score in Conan&rsquo;s chronicle is his renown score.<br/><br/>The more defeated foes in a Hero's chronicle, the more foes the opposing player gets to put into play, i.e. the more famous the Hero gets, the more enemies want to take him down. Once the foe pool is drawn, the foe players then decide which of these foe cards they want to put into play. There are major and minor foes and rules governing how many foes from the foe draw can be put into play. Once the foes decide which of their foe cards they are able and want to play, they place their foe cards into 4 zones around the Hero(front, left, right and rear). They then place &ldquo;move&rdquo; cards from their draw deck for each foe they have assigned to do battle with the Hero. These cards are placed face down and represent both offensive and defensive elements. The Hero player then responds to these move cards with his own move cards, placed face up, to counter each foes&rsquo; move card. Hero&rsquo;s move cards also incorporate both offensive and defensive elements. The foes then reveal their move cards and combat is resolved. If any of the foes are left alive, all players draw cards from their draw deck, and the surviving foes place new move cards onto the table. The Hero once again counters, combat is resolved, etc. until either the Hero retreats or defeats all his foes. If the Hero retreats he loses renown. If he defeats all of his foes, the Hero then can decide to rest and replenish his prowess pool and a small fraction of his life points. The Hero can also &ldquo;press on.&rdquo; If the Hero presses on, he starts a new round of combat, but does not get to replenish any prowess or life. Once the Hero rests or retreats, the next player then becomes the Hero.<br/><br/>Play continues until a victory condition is met (the first player to reach 40 renown, the last player with a surviving Conan, or the last player with cards left to play).<br/><br/>Each player must provide two decks which meet the appropriate requirements. The Draw Deck must contain at least 40 non-foe cards. No more than 3 copies of any given card are allowed, with no more than 1 copy of any unique card. The Foe Deck must contain at least 25 foe cards. No more than 3 copies of any given foe card (or 1 copy of any unique card) are permitted.

The hourglass (also included) is set just before the team member starts explaining the word. (Looking at the first card and thinking about how to explain the word before the time is set is allowed.) The Player must get the other team member to say the word that is written on card by using sentences to describe the word. For example, if the word is &quot;Silver Medal&quot;, a player can say &quot;something that a sportsman wins at the Olympic games&quot;.

Each level has a game board filled with differently colored candies, and might contain obstacles. The basic move of this game is horizontally or vertically swapping the positions of two adjacent candies, to create sets of three (or more) candies of the same color.<br/><br/>This game is separated into levels, and each level has its own requirements to complete. The Facebook version of Candy Crush Saga currently has 440 levels, and a new set of levels is released approximately every 3 weeks. The smartphone versions of Candy Crush Saga currently have 395 levels.<br/><br/>The player is given a default maximum number of five lives. The player needs at least one life to play a level. If the player fails to complete a level, a life is deducted. Lives will regenerate at a rate of one life every 30 minutes. The player can also restore lives by asking Facebook friends for help, or by paying Facebook credits.<br/><br/>Special Candies are created when four or more candies of the same color are matched together. Special Candies have special effects (e.g. clearing an entire row of candies) when they are cleared. Examples of Special Candies include Striped Candies and Wrapped Candies.<br/><br/>If a player tries to swap two adjacent Special Candies, it will generally create a special combination effect. These effects are often more powerful than the individual candies' effects.<br/><br/>Obstacles appear in some of the levels. Obstacles have a wide variety of properties, and they are all designed to make it more difficult to complete a level. Examples of obstacles include chocolate that tries to slowly fill the entire game board, and tornadoes that randomly destroy spaces on the game board.<br/><br/>A booster is a single-use device that is costly (purchased) and can be used to help the player complete a level. Boosters are usually bought with Facebook credits. Every level in Candy Crush Saga can be completed without the use of boosters, but the game difficulty ramp is designed to encourage the purchase of boosters. Examples of boosters include a Lollipop Hammer that can destroy any game square, and a Free Switch that can swap any two adjacent candies.<br/><br/>In previous versions of Candy Crush Saga, a player could purchase charm items to help them complete a level. Charms were much more expensive than boosters, because charms could be used repeatedly. As of June 27, 2013, Charms are no longer purchasable.<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;Candy Crush Saga&quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "145684": {"poll": {}, "name": "Wasserball", "playingtime": "0", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": {"2035": "Roll / Spin and Move"}, "yearpublished": "0", "usersrated": "1", "boardgamefamily": {"10643": "Country: Germany"}, "maxplayers": "6", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1733939_t.jpg", "average": "7", "statistics": {}, "boardgamepublisher": {"6940": {"name": "ABC N\u00fcrnberg"}}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1733939.jpg", "boardgameversion": {"214947": "First edition"}, "maxplaytime": "0", "boardgamecategory": {"1038": {"name": "Sports"}}, "age": "0", "minplaytime": "0", "description": "Each player rolls the die - ending on a marked space follow instructions printed on the cover backside (e.g. back to field 8, pass your turn, roll the dice one more time...).<br/>Objective: Be the first moving up to field 50.<br/>Published before WWII.<br/><br/>"}, "145685": {"poll": {}, "name": "Walk Like A Manopoly: The Jersey Boys Game", "playingtime": "120", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": {"2072": "Dice Rolling"}, "yearpublished": "2012", "usersrated": "0", "maxplayers": "6", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1743409_t.jpg", "average": "0", "statistics": {}, "boardgamepublisher": {"3320": {"name": "(Unknown)"}}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1743409.jpg", "boardgameversion": {"214948": "English edition"}, "maxplaytime": "120", "boardgamecategory": {"1021": {"name": "Economic"}}, "age": "0", "minplaytime": "120", "description": "This is a Monopoly clone based on the Broadway play Jersey Boys and commemorates the plays worldwide tour.

Each type of tower can be upgraded several times, and on your third upgrade you can choose between two paths of upgrade for the tower. In addition as you play the game you will earn experience. The experience can be used to permanently upgrade your abilities in one of three areas that correspond with the towers. Orcs, undead and demons. Each level can be passed with one of three rankings.

Each citadel was ruled by a mighty master who marched their armies to battle for control over the vast magical pools known as Esper. The Esper imbued their great civilisations with magic, miracles and power. Decade after decade the violence and bloodshed escalated and the increasingly desperate masters performed cursed rituals to gain the advantage. Successive masters and their courts performed dark blood magic and offered tainted Esper to the gods of the cosmos.<br/><br/>Then one night at the sign of the Dread Moon a meteor crashed into the realm and obliterated nearly all life. The Esper turned into fiery Embers which cursed and twisted the lands and its inhabitants beyond imagination. Now nothing remains. Vile Phantoms, deformed creatures and shadows stalk the few remaining survivors.<br/><br/>It has been another 900 years since that fateful impact. The old masters have suddenly been bought back to life having been reanimated by the cursed Embers. They are but mere shadows of their former selves. Their only memory being the wars, anger and hate for each other. Both masters seek to resurrect their long lost champions, drain the lands of its few remaining resources.  Their quest is to rebuild their fallen citadels, summon elemental servants and raise Warbands from the dead. You are the master of the citadel! War will come again.<br/><br/>The goal of Master of the Citadel (MotC) is to create powerful Warbands capable of laying siege to your opponents citadel gates and destroying their city. You begin the game with a champion who you must advance into a powerful character capable of defeating powerful creatures summoned from beyond the spirit realm. Victory in these battles will reward you with the resources you need to scavange legendary weapons and armour, summon elemental servants to do your bidding, develop your citadel and construct deadly warbands.<br/><br/>MotC uses a unique battle system in which your champion summons the spirits of fallen enemies to fight in deadly combat. By performing a cursed ritual you set the difficulty of the encounter and the rewards you get scale accordingly. Victory may yield fate cards that provide hidden bonuses.<br/><br/>Summon elemental servants to boost your champions equipment when needed using MotC&rsquo;s unique flexible battle system.<br/><br/>Build paths, activate mysterious obelisks, explore abandoned keeps and harvest resources such as wood, stone, gold and cursed embers. <br/> Map tiles are colour coordinated and randomised meaning the available resources and strategic locations vary with each game.<br/><br/>Use your citadel board to enchant your champions' equipment. Build warband training grounds, citadel buildings and manage your resource pool.<br/><br/>Accumulate vast resources to build dreaded Warbands of wretched knights, dark mages and undead rangers. Use these warbands to fortify strategic locations, build mines, scout for stat boosting relics.<br/><br/>Then once your powers are at it's peak you are ready to siege and destroy your opponent.<br/><br/>"}, "145700": {"poll": {}, "name": "Rock 'N Tour", "playingtime": "60", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": {"2072": "Dice Rolling"}, "yearpublished": "2008", "usersrated": "1", "maxplayers": "0", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1846301_t.jpg", "average": "6", "statistics": {}, "boardgamepublisher": {"3320": {"name": "(Unknown)"}}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1846301.jpg", "boardgameversion": {"214979": "Spanish edition"}, "maxplaytime": "60", "boardgamecategory": {"1054": {"name": "Music"}}, "age": "12", "minplaytime": "60", "description": "Rock 'N Tour it's a trivia game where you can explore more than six decades of Rock and Pop music in the best trivia in spanish language.<br/>Remember bands, classic songs, significant moments in rock history and discover the truth over facts and myths around the rock world.<br/><br/>Contains:<br/><br/>1 Board<br/>306 Trivia Cards (with over 1,400 questions)<br/>2 Tuckboxes<br/>8 Concert Ticket Tokens<br/>18 Musician Tokens<br/>1 Die<br/>4 &quot;Rock On&quot;

You won&rsquo;t find pansy elves, drunken dwarves, or cutesy halflings or gnomes in these rules. Rather, here you&rsquo;ll find hulking brutes of men throttling the unholy life from demons with their bare hands, voluptuous pirate women slicing foes to ribbons with rapiers as razor sharp as their wits, dark wizards who become just a little less human with every spell they cast, and monsters from the darkest bowels of Hell and beyond. This isn&rsquo;t Lord of the Rings or Harry Potter. This is Conan and Lankhmar. In fact, the original source for these rules was a wonderful game put out by TSR in the 1980&rsquo;s, written by Dave &ldquo;Zeb&rdquo; Cook and based upon the Conan licensed property. That game endeavored to capture the feel of not only Howard&rsquo;s original stories, but the Conan comic books that were so popular at the time. It did its job well, and in the process gave us a game that was well ahead of its time, and very underappreciated. These &ldquo;obfuscated&rdquo; rules are an effort to put that system, sans anyone&rsquo;s intellectual properties, back out there for people to use and enjoy. We hope you enjoy playing it as much as we&rsquo;ve enjoyed putting it together.

Take charge of the US or Soviet space agencies - your duty is be the first to the moon. Carefully manage your budget by opening programs, spending R&amp;D funds on improving the hardware, recruiting personnel and launching space missions in this realistic turn based strategy game.<br/><br/>Road to the Moon features the race to the Moon, the historical event that started in the early 1960s and that ended in July 1969, after the successful completion of the Apollo 11 mission.<br/><br/>The game features both a campaign and a sandbox mode. In campaign mode, you will be able to play as the Director of either NASA or the Soviet Space Agency in order to beat the other side to be the first on the Moon. You can also lead the  Global Space Agency (GSA), an fictional space agency that combines programs from all the major space agencies in the world . In the GSA campaign, you will need to address the requests and short-term goals issued by government, and is geared towards those players who prefer a game experience focused on exploration instead of competition.  Alternatively, all three space agencies feature a Sandbox mode, which provides a more open-ended experience and allows you to try out different approaches without any political pressure.<br/><br/>You will be able to develop dozens of programs. Some examples include the X-15 and the PKA space planes, the Sputnik satellite, the Mercury, Voskhod, Apollo and Soyuz manned spacecraft and the Mars Viking probe. You are not limited to missions that did launch, as as the game also allows you to try out many concepts that were planned but that never left the drawing board. For example, instead of sending men to the Moon using the Lunar Orbit Rendezvous (LOR) approach used by Project Apollo in the late 1960s and early 1970s, you will be able to rewrite history and use either the alternative Gemini Earth Orbit Rendezvous (EOR) or Gemini Direct Ascent (DA) schemes. The number of options available ensure every game will be different and there is huge replay value.<br/><br/>To verify its accuracy and authenticity, the game, is being developed in consultation with Dr. Buzz Aldrin, former U.S. Air Force combat pilot (66 missions in Korea) and NASA astronaut, who took part in the first Moon landing mission and became the second human being to walk on the Moon.<br/><br/>If you have any interest in Space and its exploration this is a game you just do not want to miss!<br/><br/>Source: The Developer Website.<br/><br/>"}, "145715": {"poll": {}, "name": "Adidoku", "playingtime": "180", "minplayers": "1", "boardgamemechanic": {"2004": "Set Collection"}, "yearpublished": "2012", "usersrated": "8", "maxplayers": "6", "average": "6.6875", "statistics": {}, "boardgamepublisher": {"4983": {"name": "L\u00fadika y Artefactos"}}, "boardgameversion": {"215004": "Spanish edition"}, "maxplaytime": "180", "boardgamecategory": {"1028": {"name": "Puzzle"}}, "age": "13", "minplaytime": "180", "description": "Adidoku is a new generation of puzles with a fun mix of characters, places and phrases.

In the game, two fledgling empires stare across the void at one another.<br/><br/>The Terran Alliance explores space eager for new frontiers and resources to exploit. They are a cantankerous collection of conflicting factions united only in their refusal to accept any limitation to their individual ambitions. They are at their strongest &mdash; and happiest &mdash; when challenged.<br/><br/>The Alpha Centauri Regime advances into space to meet the alien threat and eliminate it. They are a single people united under a single banner. The State gives every citizen a purpose, and every citizen gives their all to the State. Anything less is unacceptable.<br/><br/>Now aware of the existence of the other, both sides advance eagerly for the conflict to come. The one thing they share is an appetite for war. Seize the stars!<br/><br/>In game terms, players take on the roles of stellar empires fighting for survival and supremacy amongst the blackness of space. The field of cards between the home worlds of the opposing forces defines Nearspace and the resources that both players have to work with. As players explore their surroundings, each card reveals new threats to overcome and new resources to capture. The war ships that the two opponents bring to battle are dice. Any polyhedral die works as a ship for Near Space. The number of facets on a die are the strength of its armaments and defenses. The more facets, the more powerful the ship and consequently the more costly to field. Polyhedral dice come in a multitude of colors that are used to define the job of a ship and the design specifications involved. Four-sided fighters race forward in the vanguard while d10 battleships bring their firepower to bear at a more ominous pace. Each fleet must explore uncharted space, control colony worlds, pacify unaligned forces, and prepare to battle the ever-advancing enemy!<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": {"215006": "English first edition"}, "age": "9", "name": "Nearspace", "playingtime": "60", "boardgamemechanic": {"2072": "Dice Rolling"}, "average": "6.75", "usersrated": "4", "boardgamefamily": {"22184": "Admin: Unreleased Games"}}, "145717": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2005475.png", "poll": {}, "boardgamedesigner": {"182": {"name": "Peter Schurzmann"}}, "statistics": {}, "yearpublished": "1995", "maxplayers": "4", "boardgameartist": {"69592": "Pia Praschan"}, "boardgamepublisher": {"1725": {"name": "Braintrust Games"}}, "maxplaytime": "0", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2005475_t.png", "minplaytime": "0", "boardgamecategory": {"1089": {"name": "Animals"}}, "description": "Rex is running through Vienna and looking for the tracks of bad guys, which he must follow.

Finally, you will find within these pages five new fey-themed sorcerer bloodlines as well as a pair of archetypes devoted to a closer relationship to all things faerie: the feyfriend druid who desperately wishes to be like them in every way, and the fey hunter ranger who wishes only to get close enough to kill every last one for spite and vengeance on the Fair Folk who wronged them dearly once upon a time.<br/><br/>Ideally suited for use with the Kingdom-Building Adventure Path or for any campaign where they fey play a significant role, Faerie Passions is brought to you by the authorial team of Russ Taylor and Todd Stewart making their Legendary debut, with marvelous artwork by the esteemed Mike Lowe.

Players take turns competing against one another to see who will last from midnight to sunrise. Each player must keep their children alive and sane through the night.<br/><br/>The school bus sat waiting in front of the fairgrounds. Children from all parts of Harlington County were excited to start their trip, eager to see the Blue Mountain Campground on its opening weekend.  It was late evening when the Mayor wished the kids luck as they rose from their picnic tables, hurriedly shoving bits of cake into their mouths as they climbed aboard the old school bus.  Songs and the laughter of children would fill the first few hours, only to be cut short when one of the children called out &quot;I just saw a dark man standing in the road ahead of us.&quot;  As the laughter subsided and the children strained their eyes to see into the darkness, tree limbs burst through the windows, sending tiny glass fragments into the air that found their way into the soft flesh of the children. Metal groaned and cried out as the bus pitched over onto its side, sliding before finally ending up in a ditch on the side of the road. Screams echoed out of the interior of the bus as the children begun moving and freeing themselves from the wreckage. The driver lay dead against the wheel. It was almost midnight, and the children were alone in woods that could swallow them from every angle. It would be daybreak before anyone would even begin looking for them...<br/><br/>Players choose 1 card from the six gifted children cards and 4 random cards from the 24 children and assemble their survivors. Each child card displays the child's name, age, sanity level and &quot;end game&quot; point value. Your goal is to keep as many children alive and as sane as possible by sunrise. The gifted children have high sanity values and a special ability to help their group survive. These special abilities include the power to absorb a creature&rsquo;s damage, evade enemy attacks and even pass damage meant for you onto your opponent's survivors. Survival is key and differs from child to child. Some kids are young and low on sanity, while others may have increased sanity due to age or street smarts. Each child card contains a simple descriptive term like Bully, Class Clown, or Doll Baby to give insight into each child and add flavor to the core game.<br/><br/>The goal of Zero Hour is to survive from midnight until dawn. Each turn, a card from the Hour deck is flipped over, advancing time forward by one hour. The player with the highest point total at sunrise is declared the winner.  Each child has a point value indicated on their card that comes into play once the game is over.  Each player adds together whatever cards they are still holding to determine their point value total. This number will be between 0-25 points.<br/><br/>The Game contains:<br/>6 Gifted Child cards<br/>24 Child cards <br/>30 Sanity cards<br/>8 Clock cards<br/>1 black/white Creature die<br/>1 white Escape die<br/>1 rules booklet <br/>100-card Exploration Deck (The Slender Man)<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": {"215069": "Boxed edition"}, "age": "0", "name": "Zero Hour: Survival Horror Card Game", "playingtime": "0", "boardgamemechanic": {"2027": "Storytelling"}, "average": "5.14074", "usersrated": "27", "boardgamefamily": {"8374": "Crowdfunding: Kickstarter"}}, "145765": {"poll": {}, "name": "Cucco 21", "playingtime": "30", "minplayers": "5", "yearpublished": "2012", "usersrated": "21", "maxplayers": "12", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2281270_t.jpg", "average": "5.55714", "statistics": {}, "boardgamepublisher": {"11611": {"name": "Sugorokuya"}}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2281270.jpg", "boardgameversion": {"215070": "Sugorokuya First edition"}, "maxplaytime": "30", "boardgamecategory": {"1002": {"name": "Card Game"}}, "age": "6", "minplaytime": "30", "description": "Cucco 21 is a deck of Il Cucco cards which specializes playing &quot;Cambio&quot;.

The characters are rough and ready adventurers. No more moralizing paladins and clerics. Even the religious characters are willing to get a little dirty in the pursuit of their goals.<br/>The game brings a fresh look to medieval fantasy with 10 unique classes that each bring something special to the table. Each class features; <br/><br/>     Expertise in a class-specific task; like the Sorcerer's counterspelling ability or a Cultist's ability to sacrifice humanoids to curry favor with their god.<br/>     Identification of something in the world; like the Priest's ability to identify divine symbols and beings or the Savage's ability to spot weakness in combat.<br/>     Companions to serve as henchmen; like the Knave's ability to recruit spies or the Conjurer's ability to create imps to serve them. <br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>The five magic-using classes have a varied selection of new and exciting spells. There are easy methods to create your own enchantments, raise unique undead to serve you, or craft cursed items to give to your enemies. The non-magical classes have their own rich choices and don't fade away in importance as the magical characters advance in level.<br/><br/>These classes can then be combined with 10 classic fantasy races; from elves and dwarves to orcs and lizardfolk. You can combine them however you wish, creating everything from goblin knights to dwarven brigands.<br/><br/>The entire package is designed to allow quick character generation and presented in a format that is clear and easy to read. The text is packed with expanations of not just the rules, but the reasons behind the rules. It is an ideal choice to hand to a new player who is looking to get into the great game, but turned away by thick rulebooks with byzantine organization. The adventuring mechanics are also OSR compatible and allow easy integration with a variety of old school campaign material.

While all of these will-o&rsquo;-wisps can certainly hold their own in a fight, we aimed to capture a bit more of the essence of the wisp. The first result was the wispling (CR 2), a smaller, weaker version of the will-o&rsquo;-wisp that can instill fear on opponents with its unnerving touch and ghostly lights abilities, and then bask in that fear with their feast on fear ability. The next new will-o&rsquo;-wisp is the dark guide will-o&rsquo;-wisp (CR 9), whose guidelights ability compels those who see it to follow it, regardless of where it takes them. These corrupted will-o&rsquo;-wisps feed on death, more than fear, and lead travelers to early graves in order to sup on their last breaths. Finally, the devil&rsquo;s eye will-o&rsquo;-wisp (CR 13) appears at first to be a simple cloud of illuminated marsh gas, but, in fact, has numerous powers, including its maddening witchlight and its terrifying ability to split into multiple creatures.<br/><br/>"}, "145826": {"rpg": {"2791": "Pathfinder System Compatible Product"}, "statistics": {}, "name": "Equinox Campaign Setting", "rpgproducer": {"50693": "Scott Gladstein"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2058267.jpg", "usersrated": "0", "rpgitemversion": {"215169": "PDF version"}, "average": "0", "rpggenre": {"155": "Fantasy (High Fantasy)"}, "rpgcategory": {"2107": "Campaign Setting (game world)"}, "poll": {}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2058267_t.jpg", "description": "From publisher blurb:<br/><br/>Welcome to Azrin <br/>Equinox is set on the plane of Azrin.

The game design is meant to be simple and highly playable, yet one that portrays the historical challenges facing the combatants. Historically the US failed to bottle up the Spanish fleet, and was forced to undergo a lengthy blockade while the US Army fought the Spanish garrison for control of the city and port. The capture of key fortifications and the heights at Kettle and San Juan Hills compelled Admiral Pascual Cervera to sortie on July 3rd to prevent his ships from being sunk at their moorings by US artillery, or capture when the town surrendered. The US navy would sink all of the fleeing Spanish ships with little loss, scoring a lop-sided win.<br/><br/>Each copy of Death Before Dishonor is composed of the following:<br/><br/>&bull;    One sheet of 50 single-sided counters.<br/>&bull;    One 8.5 by 11 map.<br/>&bull;    This set of rules.<br/><br/>Players will also need a one ten-sided die (D10).<br/><br/>"}, "145834": {"boardgamedesigner": {"812": {"name": "Paul Rohrbaugh"}}, "average": "0", "poll": {}, "name": "A Monstrous Fuss: The Battle of Wilson's Creek, August 10, 1861", "playingtime": "2", "minplayers": "1", "boardgamemechanic": {"2026": "Hex-and-Counter"}, "yearpublished": "2013", "usersrated": "0", "maxplayers": "2", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1737142_t.jpg", "boardgameartist": {"46618": "Bruce Yearian"}, "statistics": {}, "boardgamepublisher": {"17180": {"name": "High Flying Dice Games"}}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1737142.jpg", "boardgameversion": {"215181": "First Edition"}, "maxplaytime": "2", "boardgamecategory": {"1048": {"name": "American Civil War"}}, "age": "12", "minplaytime": "2", "description": "&ldquo;Great stir in camp this evening.

The eight sectors are shown on your scanner, with an indication of whether a bomb is on the screen, how close it is to exploding, and the damage currently sustained by that sector.<br/><br/>Shooting certain enemies protects the sector from bombs for a certain time, or can repair some of the damage to the sector.<br/><br/>The game is over when the sector the player is currently in is destroyed.<br/><br/>The game is called &quot;Laserwheel&quot; in-game, but the inlay calls it &quot;Lazerwheel&quot; or &quot;Lazer Wheel&quot;.

Although the rules can take you much further, you'll want to use your own classic bestiaries or spellbooks for higher level characters, or any of those available for free online!<br/><br/>"}, "145867": {"rpg": {"524": "d20 System / OGL Product (D&D 3.5 Compatible)"}, "poll": {}, "name": "Scars", "rpgproducer": {"38431": "Louis Porter, Jr. Design Studio"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1731868.png", "usersrated": "0", "rpgitemversion": {"215293": "PDF version"}, "average": "0", "statistics": {}, "rpggenre": {"155": "Fantasy (High Fantasy)"}, "rpgcategory": {"2108": "Sourcebook (rules/options to enhance play)"}, "rpgseries": {"22968": "Two Dozen"}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1731868_t.png", "description": "From publisher blurb:<br/><br/>The bravest warriors have scars: scars of battles won and lost, and scars earned during agonizing ceremonies and barbaric rituals, scars that honor the gods and call down spirits.

I also started drawing the graphics in Photoshop. Masq was supposed to be just a proof of concept, however the dot.com opportunity kicked in and given that there was nothing like Masq (this is still seems to be the case) we decided to turn it into a product. In those times most of the web was text.<br/><br/>Soon we discovered it would take much longer to develop Masq than we had anticipated. (Reasons for the delay later)<br/><br/>Around one year later we ran focus groups to test the first two episodes. The test was successful. Around this time Noah Falstein and Charles Swartz joined us as advisors.<br/><br/>We set up a shop in Mexico City with 8 people; 3 artists, one producer, two assistant producers and testers to accelerate the production of illustrations and testing.<br/><br/>It passed around another year before Ken Melville joined us as an advisor and started reviewing the dialogues and really making them work in English.<br/><br/>It took us 5 years to &quot;finish&quot;, and we only finished the downloadable version of Masq (2002). We just developed 2 episodes of the browser version.<br/><br/>The main reasons for the delay were the following:<br/>-     We really wanted the player choices to matter, and &quot;Real&quot; branching demanded many more scenes than anticipated.<br/><br/>-     We did not have adequate authoring tools. Macromedia Director is powerful but is not designed for the task.<br/><br/>-     Inexperience.<br/><br/>-    No way to delegate. The kind of interactive authoring that the genre demands is an organic mix of screenwriting, programming and game design understanding. This is not only a &quot;new&quot; skill, but an uncommon one.<br/><br/>-    Lack of resources during development. This forced us to spend a lot of time looking for more resources, and doing many necesary but distracting administrative tasks.<br/>From 2002 to 2004 we brought Masq public and start doing market tests as well as showing it to many people in the industry looking for support to keep developing stories. For more information about this, read:<br/><br/>The tests consisted of charging different prices to play, giving it away for free, asking different information or none at all, trying different low budget advertising channels to reach the users, and even exploring different target markets (within a very limited budget), gathering feedback form players, registering every path they took to play Masq, etc. We even ran more focus groups with one of the major game developers and publishers. These tests were very successful but those who were in charge inside this organization lacked the capacity to move the project forward.<br/><br/>In Abril 2007 Tom Francis from PCGamer magazine UK, found out about Masq and wrote a very postive review. From there on, many people started noticing Masq, appearing in the Belgium-Holland magazine PCGameplay who gave Masq a score of 88 out of 100, later in Computer Games magazine in Greece as well as many important blogs such as 4ColorRebellion, JustAdventure, Independent Gaming, Tigsource, Grand Text Auto, etc. Masq was just selected (08/2007) one of the Top 100 Games (all times) by PCGamer magazine UK.<br/><br/>Masq has been online since 2002, and has been played (to varying degrees) by more than 60,000 players. As of today, we keep receiving enthusiastic emails and incredibly positive reviews.<br/><br/>As today, we're looking for investors an strategic partners, distributors, believers, etc.<br/><br/>Intention:<br/><br/>Our intention was to create a new design model, an interactive entertainment genre capable of:<br/><br/>1.- Provoking in the player the kind of emotions that novels and movies do, but at a whole new level by leveraging the participatory and immersive qualities of interactive games. The kind of emotions mainly absent from games.<br/><br/>2.- Unleashing alternative personalities or facets of the players, embarking them on journeys of self-discovery as they contemplate moral and other exciting choices.<br/><br/>3.- Dealing with the broad range of themes and situations found in movies and novels, but offering the deeper experiential resonance of multilayered what-if scenarios.<br/><br/>4.- Making the interactive experience revolve around personal relationships with well-rounded characters instead of mainly dealing with the physical world as in most games.<br/><br/>5.- Being much easier to play than most games in the marketplace; easier interface, shorter learning curve, and far less frustrating to play for non-gamers.<br/><br/>Source: The Publisher Website.<br/><br/>"}, "145881": {"boardgamedesigner": {"50673": {"name": "Antonio Recuenco-Mu\u00f1oz"}}, "poll": {}, "name": "M\u00e1s-Menos", "playingtime": "30", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": {"2009": "Trick-taking"}, "yearpublished": "2013", "usersrated": "0", "maxplayers": "0", "boardgamefamily": {"98": "Traditional Card Games"}, "average": "0", "statistics": {}, "boardgamepublisher": {"1001": {"name": "(Web published)"}}, "boardgameversion": {"215311": "First edition"}, "maxplaytime": "30", "boardgamecategory": {"1002": {"name": "Card Game"}}, "age": "8", "minplaytime": "30", "description": "Drawing from Michael Waitsman's Proteus rather than from Nomic-related card games, M&aacute;s-Menos is a trick-taking game for two players and a 32-card deck constructed around two variable winning conditions: one applied to single tricks and another applied to the whole game.

Power is the currency you will use to buy new, stronger cards to add to your deck. The goal of a deck-building game is to craft your personal deck into well-oiled machine, and five types of cards can be acquired: Villains, Heroes, Equipment, Super Powers, and Locations. A large, central stack of cards supplies a five-card &quot;Line-Up&quot; from which players make their purchases. Each player will always have five cards to choose from each turn, so every turn there are new options and new surprises.<br/><br/>When a player has amassed enough Power, he may attempt to defeat the current Stage Boss. When a Stage Boss is attacked, it retaliates against the attacker! With Street Fighter, the action is often one-on-one. Players can defend themselves with Defense cards like Chun-Li's Bracelets and Electric Thunder. Each player also has access to a special Ultra card that is one of his character's signature maneuvers.

The battlefield landscape is formed by the random conglomeration of objects that can usually be found on your desk or table. These may include books, cups, your laptop, a mouse or a remote control. The game pack includes a set of riveting scenarios. You can take part in a massive melee, rob caravans, perform speed missions under a hail of arrows and even solve riddles!<br/><br/>Each player will have his own small army represented by discs of different sizes and corresponding reference cards. Legendary heroes, tough veterans and faithful fighters each of them with unique abilities described on reference card will be at your disposal. Likewise there will be small missile disks, which can be used by some of your characters, and mighty artifacts, which you can take under control during the course of a battle.<br/><br/>In your turn you can activate three of your characters: flick the disk to attack or use a missile instead or cast a spell. There are a lot of interesting choices you will have each time - whom and how to activate, trying to make a risky long short or just safely moving your warrior into an advantageous position for the next move. In this game your tactical choices are much more important than anything else. You also have to try to make the best use of the synergy of the different warrior types in your army!<br/><br/>We actively encourage players to use everyday objects from their tables. Imagine a turned glass as a sphere of ice which could freeze some disks of your enemy, a book as an impregnable cliff, from which your archers could safely attack, or a vase as a control tower with 10 hit points.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "1", "boardgameversion": {"215402": "English first edition"}, "age": "7", "name": "Desktopia", "playingtime": "10", "boardgamemechanic": {"2015": "Variable Player Powers"}, "average": "6.08955", "usersrated": "22", "boardgamefamily": {"22783": "Admin: Better Description Needed!"}}, "145912": {"rpg": {"2791": "Pathfinder System Compatible Product"}, "statistics": {}, "name": "Pebble in the Pond: Within Wheels", "rpgproducer": {"69598": "Marny K.

Players acquire resources necessary to build powerful armies, accomplish quests and discover rare magic as they attempt to earn enough victory points to win the game.<br/><br/>Put your skilled artisans to work to build a strong economy and then unleash legions led by powerful heroes to vanquish your foes.  Never underestimate roaming undead armies and always be on guard as the deadly dragon may strike at the most unfavorable time.<br/><br/>Players begin the game by choosing a hero and a race alliance.  This can be accomplished randomly, in turn order or by blind bid.  Once the selections are made, players will place their stronghold, hero and starting army on one of their race alliance territories, then in reverse order players will place their race lord on another alliance territory in a different province.<br/><br/>Player aid cards help players with their turn sequence, unit costs, casualty results and random events that may occur throughout the game.  Each players turn consists of the following sequence: A rune blessing that affects all players, players then purchase new units and structures and place them in a queue.  Each player then takes their turn moving units, initiating and resolving battles, deploying new units, collecting resources and updating their victory tracks.  All players may then heal heroes, repair damaged strongholds, draw new quests and resolve a cataclysmic event to end the turn.  There are 7 turns and if a player hasn't earned enough victory points through expansion, questing, killing other heroes or slaying the dragon the final cataclysm destroys the world and all players are defeated.<br/><br/>What really makes Battleborn Legacy stand out from other war games is a combination of features including the following:<br/><br/>1. Unique Battle boards for regiment and hero placement.  Color coded for easy unit placement, also coordinates with matching attack/defense dice.  <br/>2.  Heroes and units may become veterans through battles won.<br/>3. Random casualty chart that adds a real combat element to the game.<br/>4. Card draw that may change the outcome of key battles and events during the game.  These cards include powerful artifacts, unique hero abilities, magic weapons, quests and much more.<br/>5. Resource management system that evolves with game play.<br/>6. Random events such as dragon attacks, natural disasters and undead uprisings that may change players objectives and strategy throughout the game.<br/><br/>Battleborn Legacy is a must try for fantasy war game enthusiast that enjoy RPG elements, real strategy and where victory is decided by each player's tactical combat skill and cunning and not just the luck of the dice.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": {"215438": "First edition"}, "age": "14", "name": "Battleborn Legacy", "playingtime": "180", "boardgamemechanic": {"2080": "Area Control / Area Influence"}, "average": "8.0508", "usersrated": "25", "boardgamefamily": {"8374": "Crowdfunding: Kickstarter"}}, "145917": {"poll": {}, "name": "Twelve Elements of War", "playingtime": "45", "minplayers": "2", "yearpublished": "2014", "usersrated": "2", "boardgamefamily": {"8374": "Crowdfunding: Kickstarter"}, "maxplayers": "0", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1852972_t.jpg", "average": "4.5", "statistics": {}, "boardgamepublisher": {"25634": {"name": "Sword & Board Games"}}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1852972.jpg", "boardgameversion": {"215440": "English edition"}, "maxplaytime": "45", "boardgamecategory": {"1010": {"name": "Fantasy"}}, "age": "0", "minplaytime": "45", "description": "Welcome to the Eastlands of Dothmora, a realm riven by intrigue, feuding lords and warbands fighting in the secretive Shadow War. It is a land steeped in rune magic and blood, yet one where the various races &ndash; humans, elves, dwarfs, fauns, trolls, ogres, orcs, goblins and halflings &ndash; live in harmony, owing allegiance not to race but to one of the mighty factions that make up this war-torn kingdom.<br/><br/>Twelve Elements of War is a 28mm Tabletop skirmish wargame. A typical warband will include between 7 - 12 models (depending on your faction and style of play), activating one model at a time. Players alternate turns activating models, keeping both players engaged and thinking. Despite only activating one model at a time, it successfully simulates combined attacks with multiple models; the first attacks in a round weaken and lock-down a model, making it easier to finish off by attackers later in a round.<br/><br/>It uses a multiple D6 dice, one-roll system for all rolls during a battle. Roll a number of dice equal to the Model Statistic that you are using to attack/defend/employ, add bonus dice if you have an advantage of some type, like charging. Compare the result of this roll to the enemy model's statistic or enemy model's roll to see if you succeed. The dice system does not use charts or tables &amp; is used for all rolls, making the game extremely easy to learn.<br/><br/>The broad range of Faction Lists each bring something special to the battlefield, and each faction choose from the 9 fantasy races. Each Faction is balanced to each other, despite having multiple fantasy races and at least 6 roles per Faction to choose from. Successfully employing a variety of different races performing melee, shooting or magic roles on the battlefield is the key to winning.<br/><br/>Over 20 different mission combinations ensures that each game of Twelve Elements of War will different from the next. Creating a balanced warband is only the start; quick thinking, using the right model at the right time &amp; an assertive battleplan is the key to completing your objectives while denying your opponent theirs.<br/><br/>The fun with Twelve Elements of War doesn't finish after one game. Twelve Elements of War has a complete Campaign system that sees your models gain experience, better abilities, new skills, money and magical runic items as they play battles and also explore the world of Lumria acquiring strange and unique items. You will also have the option to visit a town after each game. In town you can choose to go to the Tavern to recruit new members and heroes, The Market to purchase new items and equipment, the Arena to watch pit fighting and maybe pick up a few pointers. Lastly the Temple, where you can prey to the gods to heal your wounds or ask for their blessing in future battles. In addition to visiting these places, you roll on one of four unique &ldquo;random encounter charts&rdquo;.<br/><br/>Games can be played on a vast variety of battlefield types, from cautious tactical advances in the snow covered Forest of Sighs, to fast paced skirmishes leaping from building top to building top in the sprawling Port City of Arcadia.<br/><br/>Lastly, with 100's of magical  item combinations to try out and over 36 unique runic spells to cast with your magic users, this game has a large amount of re-playability.<br/><br/>Factions in the core book include:<br/><br/>- The elite soldiers of Highguard, vying to restore their city-state to its former glory.<br/>- The tough, guerrilla warriors of the Mining Guild, seeking to control valuable mineral resources across the continent.<br/>- The Geniocracy of Toth, who strive to expand their knowledge of technology, science and magic &ndash; by sword&rsquo;s edge if need be. <br/>- The sorcerers of the Shadow Hold, adepts at runic magic, and served by thrall workers and brainwashed fighters. They scour the land for lost runic artifacts and raid other factions to capture   slaves. <br/>- The stern Keepers of Talon Crag Citadel, who have vowed to the gods to hunt down all who dare toy with the more dangerous aspects of runic magic.<br/><br/>With more to follow n the future.<br/><br/>"}, "145918": {"boardgamedesigner": {"3": {"name": "(Uncredited)"}}, "average": "7", "poll": {}, "name": "Blind Alley: The Game of Mazes", "playingtime": "20", "minplayers": "2", "yearpublished": "1983", "usersrated": "1", "maxplayers": "2", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1733871_t.jpg", "boardgameartist": {"3": "(Uncredited)"}, "statistics": {}, "boardgamepublisher": {"4271": {"name": "Mackey Co."}}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1733871.jpg", "boardgameversion": {"215459": "Mackey edition"}, "maxplaytime": "20", "boardgamecategory": {"1039": {"name": "Deduction"}}, "age": "7", "minplaytime": "20", "description": "This game is somewhat similar to Milton Bradley's Pathfinder; it also has each player create a maze and then try to solve the opponent's maze by moving through it and being told when walls are encountered.<br/><br/>However, in Blind Alley the wall pieces come in a variety of shapes, each of which is a different color.

Over millennia, Mekannis was transformed until every piece of land was incorporated into the gears and levers of the Engine itself. An act of hubris by the world&rsquo;s rulers caused a series of devastating malfunctions that shattered the land and the death of the Great Engine. Now four empires rise to dominance. The Kestrel Dominion, descending from ancient hereditary rulers and cherishing their ancestral tradition of honor; Nova Centralis, a plutocratic nation built upon exploiting wealth and greatly desirous of maintaining their economic edge; the Sylphian Commonwealth, a once-verdant land now poisoned by the aftereffects of the Engine&rsquo;s destruction; and the Grail Prelacy, a theocratic nation emboldened by prophecies of ultimate victory. Each empire vies to fulfill the prophecy and restore the Great Engine, the source of ultimate power.<br/><br/>In Empire Engine, players take on the role of a mighty empire, powered by rotating gears.

Any remaining cards are discarded to the center.<br/><br/>Phase 3 - Reveal Warrior Cards. Each player, beginning with the current start player, will now play one or more Warrior Cards in front of them, face up for all other players to see. These Warrior Cards will add Battle Point Values, for their clans, to the respective Battle Site cards and their initial Battle Point Values.<br/><br/>Players of the same clan are trying to beat the combined Battle Point Value of the other clan.<br/><br/>Phase 4 - Reveal Tuatha Allies. Now each player will, in turn, reveal their hidden Tuatha Ally. The current start player will call out the numbers in order (from 1 to 7) and the player possessing that numbered card will reveal it and the power of that card may be used by the player. Tuatha allies are resolved in order.<br/><br/>Phase 5 - Resolve Battle. After the Tuatha, and Sacred Item and Fomor powers have been resolved, total the Battle Point Values for each clan and compare. The winner is the clan with the most Battle Points. The losing clan&rsquo;s Battle Site card is flipped over to the other side to show the winning clan&rsquo;s alignment icon. In the case of a tie, no Battle Site cards are flipped and no Victory Points are awarded in Phase 6.<br/><br/>Phase 6 - Victory Points. All players of the winning clan receive Victory Points as stated by the chart at the bottom the winning Battle Site card. Track Victory Points on the Score Card.<br/><br/>Phase 7 - Discard and Draw new Warrior Cards or add Cattle Herd.<br/>Discard all used Warrior Cards to the discard pile.<br/><br/>Phase 8 - New Start Player. The player to the left of the current start player is now the new start player.<br/><br/>Game End:<br/><br/>The game ends in one of two ways:<br/>A. After 8 rounds if playing with 4 players, or 9 rounds if playing with 3 players.<br/>B. If all of the cards in the Circle show the same Clan Holding icon.<br/><br/>At this point the player with the most Victory Points is the winner. In the event of a tie the player with the most Cattle Herd Cards played is the winner.<br/><br/>"}, "145972": {"rpg": {"2791": "Pathfinder System Compatible Product"}, "poll": {}, "name": "Feats of Flight", "rpgproducer": {"68114": "Daron Woodson"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1734483.jpg", "usersrated": "0", "rpgitemversion": {"215571": "PDF version"}, "average": "0", "statistics": {}, "rpggenre": {"155": "Fantasy (High Fantasy)"}, "rpgcategory": {"2108": "Sourcebook (rules/options to enhance play)"}, "rpgseries": {"22156": "More Feats!"}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1734483_t.jpg", "description": "From publisher blurb:<br/><br/>Feats of Flight includes ten new feats for creatures and characters gifted with the power of flight: Aerial Acrobatics, Aerial Marksmanship, Eagle Eye, Flight of the Bumblebee, Just Out of Reach, Looming Ascent,  Skybound, Swooping Save, Vicious Dive, and Wingbeat Warrior.<br/><br/>"}, "145973": {"rpg": {"2791": "Pathfinder System Compatible Product"}, "poll": {}, "name": "Feats of Observation", "rpgproducer": {"68114": "Daron Woodson"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1734482.jpg", "usersrated": "0", "rpgitemversion": {"215572": "PDF version"}, "average": "0", "statistics": {}, "rpggenre": {"155": "Fantasy (High Fantasy)"}, "rpgcategory": {"2108": "Sourcebook (rules/options to enhance play)"}, "rpgseries": {"22156": "More Feats!"}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1734482_t.jpg", "description": "From publisher blurb:<br/><br/>Feats of Observation includes nine new feats for the keen and savvy: Assassin's Eye, Improved Stonesense, Investigative Tracker, On My Command!, Reconnoiter, Scout's Eye, Sensory Joining, Stonesense, and True Disbeliever.<br/><br/>"}, "145974": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3163917.jpg", "poll": {}, "boardgamedesigner": {"7741": {"name": "Terry Simo"}}, "statistics": {}, "yearpublished": "2016", "maxplayers": "2", "boardgameartist": {"71": "Rodger B.

This period is often considered to feature the birth of Western Warfare, as opposed to the Persian/Eastern style, which relied on archery , light cavalry, and mobility.<br/><br/>Exactly how hoplite warfare was fought &ndash; what really happened when &ldquo;the bell rang&rdquo; &ndash; is highly disputed by ancient military historians, even today. Hoplite allows you to test out your theories (well, our theories, using your dice) with eleven of the great battles of this era, from the Battle of Leuctra, featuring the huge 60-man deep phalanx of Beotarch Epaminondas to the classic confrontations with the Persian missile-armed troops against the classic Greek hoplite phalanxes.<br/><br/>Hoplite uses detailed mechanics meant to convey all the possibilities of this style of warfare, from The Hellenic Law of Inertia, to Drift to the Right, to the special capabilities of the Persian Light Cavalry (Harassment and Dispersal) to three different levels of Hoplite advance to Combat (the Run Don&rsquo;t Walk rules) and a whole lot more.  We even still have some good old chariots!<br/>  <br/>And you get to fight what was the biggest land battle in European history up until Napoleonic times, the immense Battle of Plataea (truly the deciding engagement of the Greco-Persian Wars):  two maps and about 250 combat  counters covering The Greek Contingents from 26 City-States under Pausanias, Spartan Regent and General, vs. The Persians, Medes, Asians (Bactrians, Scythians, Indians and a whole lot of others) and seven Medized Greek city-states, under Mardonius, Persian Commander and son-in-law of The Great King, Darius I.<br/> The package includes Simple GBoH versions for each of the battles along with special rules that highlight the hoplite style of warfare.<br/><br/>Hoplite is the ultimate board game simulation on the birth of Western Warfare.

There is no hidden information.<br/><br/>2. There are no simultaneous decisions. Each decision happens sequentially.<br/><br/>However, a dedicated Solitaire System is being released with Talon 1000. See the (GMT) Talon 1000 page for more information.&quot;<br/>BGG listing for Talon 1000.<br/><br/>Designer:  Jim Krohn, Developer:  Bob Seifert<br/><br/>Background:<br/><br/>Long hampered by cost and beset by international problems, real space exploration did not seem possible for humanity. Amazing technological breakthroughs would change all of that in the year 2112. The invention of the Near Faster Than Light (NFTL) drive would make it possible for large ships to move easily in and out of a planet's gravity well, and to travel quickly within the confines of a solar system. Ten years later, the perfecting of Faster Than Light (FTL) drive would turn the galaxy into an open canvas. United by a common purpose, the newly formed Terran Confederation began to paint their picture. <br/><br/>Expansion led to colonies, research stations, and even more technological discoveries, but it also led to the realization that they were not alone. Although no sentient alien species had been encountered, long range scanners had picked up the distinctive signatures of FTL drives. Sentient races must exist... and they must be space faring. Terran expansion stopped. <br/><br/>Not knowing what to expect, a period of consolidation followed which emphasized defensive technologies and fleet building. First contact was made by the people of Earth with this unknown race in 2227. Over time, they would eventually call these other-worlders the Talon. It was a shortening of the alien sounds that made up their name but it was also oddly prophetic-the Talon Empire swooped in very much like a raptor upon the fledgling Terran Confederation.<br/><br/>Game Scale:<br/><br/>Units:  Individual capital ships and fighters<br/><br/>Time:  Individual fleet battles<br/><br/>Players:  2 to 6<br/><br/>Map:  Each hex represents a region of space that normally holds only one ship<br/><br/>Solitaire Suitability: there is no hidden information and no simultaneous action<br/><br/>Welcome to the Talonverse.....<br/>Talon is a game of tactical space combat set in a growing universe with its own history and back story.  This game introduces battles during the First Talon War between the Terran Confederation and the Talon Empire.<br/><br/>This is a Fleet Combat game.  Battles with individual ships can be fought, but the game easily and quickly simulates combat with fleets of 3-10 ships. These are fleets of Capital Ships.  This is NOT a game about fighter combat in space.  Most ships in the game are large and you must balance your ships' power output between shields, weapons, sensors and maneuverability - you are not just doing an Immelman.  Each faction has unique abilities and each ship has unique features.  Proper strategy involves assessing the different abilities of your ships and the enemy's.<br/><br/>This is an Accessible game.  The complexity of managing fleets of capital ships has been baked into the game system, leaving the player free to make interesting decisions.  It is also a Fast Paced game.  Small fleet scenarios can be played in one hour, larger ones in under two.  This makes the game thematically rich and full of quick but meaningful choices.<br/><br/>How can the game do all this?  All a ship's energy use is integrated into something called a Power Curve.  All a player has to do is adjust the speed of the ship.  A ship's speed determines how much Available Power it gets to charge weapons faster, reinforce shields, tighten turns... but there will never be enough of it.  The game is fought on a Map - distances moved, firing arcs, shield arcs are distinct and easily resolved.  The game uses Very Large, Laminated Counters.   All of a ship's systems are displayed directly on the counter and lamination allows you to mark damage and other ship info with a dry erase marker.  All of the important information is at your fingertips, at-a-glance, on the map. Being able to see the battle unfold on map allows the game system to handle a much larger number of ships without confusion and effort.<br/><br/>Game Features<br/><br/>     Terran Fleet (10 different ship classes)<br/>     Talon Fleet (9 different ship classes)<br/>     Ships with 4 Shield Arcs<br/>     Fighter Squadrons<br/>     Bases, Transports<br/>     Unique Abilities for each faction<br/>     Asteroids, Planets, Nebulae<br/>     Black Holes, Worm Holes<br/>     6 Different Weapon Systems including Missiles that track on the board<br/>     NFTL and FTL Drives<br/>     12 Scenarios following the story of the First Talon War<br/>     Mission Variety: Escort missions, planetary invasions, base assaults...<br/>     Lifetime Score tracking <br/>     Empire War campaign game with dynamic, strategic-level decisions<br/>     Point System for Purchasing Ships and Design-Your-Own Scenarios<br/>     A tie in with Space Empires 4x<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": {"215575": "First edition, first printing"}, "maxplaytime": "90", "name": "Talon", "playingtime": "90", "boardgamemechanic": {"2676": "Grid Movement"}, "age": "12", "boardgameexpansion": {}, "usersrated": "303", "boardgamesubdomain": {"4664": "Wargames"}, "average": "7.76185"}, "145980": {"boardgamedesigner": {"69699": {"name": "Alex Huntley"}}, "average": "6.66667", "poll": {}, "name": "ArcWorlde", "playingtime": "0", "minplayers": "2", "yearpublished": "2013", "usersrated": "3", "maxplayers": "0", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1745961_t.jpg", "boardgameartist": {"69699": "Alex Huntley"}, "statistics": {}, "boardgamepublisher": {"25645": {"name": "Warploque Miniatures"}}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1745961.jpg", "boardgameversion": {"215580": "First edition"}, "maxplaytime": "0", "boardgamecategory": {"1010": {"name": "Fantasy"}}, "age": "0", "minplaytime": "0", "description": "From Beasts of War;<br/><br/>&ldquo;ArcWorlde, is a skirmish tabletop game, set in the fantasy realm of ArcWorlde.

There are the Epic Duels, where ANY of the models on the board can engage in mighty combat, fighting to the death for glory and prestige.
