Dubbed the &quot;Lightning Lord&quot;, Beric's sigil is a forked lightning bolt, and his weapon a flaming sword. Swift in battle, he is a leader who will stand against any enemy.

These units do not follow normal activation rules and are controlled through a new mechanism: Brotherhood tokens.<br/><br/>This expansion also features new thematic keywords, such as Call to Arms and Scrapper.

The object of Zodica is to try to avoid capturing Zodiac cards while also trying to go out before your opponents.<br/><br/>Game play consists of dealing out all the cards, then passing cards to an opponent and then playing tricks.

It is 400AD and Britain is on the brink of a power vacuum as Rome looks to leave these shores and defend her empire closer to home. Foreign invaders, like the Picts, Scots, Vikings and Saxons, will take advantage and claim this land for their own. Romano-British rule is coming to and end and we are at the dawn of the Anglo-Saxon era. You must defend the Anglo-Saxon heptarchy from these foreign invaders and quash the rebellious Britons. But history is written and there is an ever looming threat. In 1066, William Duke of Normandy became king of all England and ended the Anglo-Saxon era once and for all. Can you make this land your own before the Norman invasion?<br/><br/>Seofan, the Anglo-Saxons board game, is a game for 1 to 4 players. You progress through the game from 400AD to 1066AD. Your Bretwalda will travel the seven kingdoms of England along roads like the great Fosse Way, Ermine Street and Watling Street, seeking to control towns by building forts (to exercise your military might), monasteries (to convert the pagan settlers), mints (a source of wealth), and burhs (Anglo-Saxon settlements of power). You will use warriors, missionaries, farmers and traders to settle and defend the kingdoms, and resource cards to fund your settlement, your armies, your church and your economy. Each turn your Bretwalda can take actions to travel the seven kingdoms, to enact great battles, to convert pagan settlers, to trade, and to build your realm.<br/><br/>Game events will be throwing unexpected surprises at you as you proceed through each decade, like the legend of Arthur, the writings of the Venerable Bede, the Viking invasions, the revolutionary laws of Aethelberht, Offa and Ine, or the glorious coronation of King Alfred the Great. These events may be your saviour, or they may signal your downfall. All the while, rebellious uprisings can cause the level of civil unrest to rise. Can you conquer and control the seven kingdoms before the level of civil unrest explodes, and rewrite history by building a permanent Anglo-Saxon England before the Norman invasion of 1066?<br/><br/>Overview of Gameplay<br/><br/>The game can be played solo or co-operatively, with 1 to 4 players.<br/><br/>The game board shows a map of the seven kingdoms of England (Northumbria, Mercia, East Anglia, Essex, Sussex, Kent and Wessex), and the towns of those kingdoms in which you will settle, battle, trade and rule. These towns are linked by roads along which the players (and invaders!) can travel.<br/><br/>Each game turn is broken into distinct phases. In the Draw phase you draw resource cards from a resource deck into your hand. In the Actions phase each player has 4 actions which they can use in a variety of ways: they can spend resource cards to place red, green, yellow and blue blocks (representing warriors, farmers, missionaries and traders) across the towns of the seven kingdoms; they can build mints, forts, monasteries and burhs; they can travel the map from town to town, repelling invaders and rebels (represented by black blocks); they can trade or crusade or appease local unrest, and progress through the game by adding a decade to the game calendar. During the Conflict phase you resolve battles between your warriors and the pagans. During the Rebellion phase you draw cards from a rebellion deck, which determines in which towns the locals are rebelling against your rule (and more black blocks appear). Finally, in the Progress phase, you can advance the game time through the seven eras from 400AD to 1066AD, and an event card is drawn to re-enact real events from history on the game board. You can choose to progress more slowly, giving you more time to build and settle and defend the realm, but when you do the level of civil unrest will rise too. As you progress through the game you progress through time, and real events from history will throw up surprises - some good (like a great coronation feast), and some bad (like a mutinous group of mercenaries).<br/><br/>To win the game you must control all seven kingdoms. To control a kingdom you must repel, defeat, convert or settle all black blocks in the kingdom and build one of each type of special building (fort, monastery, mint, and burh). This allows you to place a celtic cross in the kingdom and cement your rule. The special buildings can only be built by settling your warriors, missionaries, farmers and traders in the towns on the game board. You must do all this before the level of civil unrest rises (through out of control rebellions and invasions) and before the Norman invasion of 1066.<br/><br/>"}, "103534": {"videogame": {"103535": "The Gold Collection II (ZX Spectrum)"}, "statistics": {}, "name": "Pentagram", "videogamemode": {"2149": "Single-Player"}, "videogameversion": {"113387": "UK MSX Edition"}, "average": "0", "videogameseries": {"5246": "Sabreman"}, "videogametheme": {"2148": "Fantasy"}, "usersrated": "0", "videogamegenre": {"2161": "Action Adventure"}, "videogameplatform": {"5134": "MSX"}, "poll": {}, "videogamecompilation": {"103535": "The Gold Collection II (ZX Spectrum)"}, "description": "From the cassette inlay:<br/><br/>The quest for the PENTAGRAM could not have been further from Sabreman's mind as he collected his Grand Arch Wizardry spell book from the Old Mystic Curio Shoppe in Conjour town.

The game comprises of a revolving green plastic base which looks a little bit like a small green hill. On the top of the hill you place a small plastic model of Peter Pan. He doesn't serve any purpose in the game at all, but the girls quite like him! There are eight plastic bluebell cups which are placed over eight holes on the revolving board. Under one of these is placed a small Tinker Bell fairy and the aim of the game is to discover exactly where she is! You might think this all depends on guess work but it does not because Tinker Bell makes a 'tinkle bell' sound when she moves.<br/><br/>So how does the game work? After you have put all the above pieces in place, each player then receive a number of playing cards. These have pictures of Peter Pan, Wendy, John and Michael, and depending which cards you have determines whether you can spin the revolving board or not! It does not tell you who should go first in the instructions but we normally say it is the youngest player. So if that player has the appropriate card, they can trade it in for a spin of the board. And this is what happens...<br/><br/>Firstly they have to be quite careful because if the board is spun too heavily all the bluebells will go flying. If you spin it too gently Tinker Bell will not make a sound. Therefore, the key to success in this game is getting your spin just right! If you do, the board should spin round and you should hear some tinkling music which hopefully should lead you to working out which bluebell Tinker Bell is hiding under! Now this is actually easier said than done! As an adult with probably better levels of concentration than my daughters, I find it quite difficult. You really need to have total quiet and place your ear as close to the board as you can!

It was Konami's third fighting game after the 1985 releases Yie Ar Kung-Fu and Galactic Warriors, and their first release that came after the success of Capcom's 1991 arcade hit Street Fighter II.<br/><br/>Martial Champion follows the same fighting game conventions established by Street Fighter II: the player's character fights against his or her opponent in best two-out-of-three matches in a single player tournament mode with the computer or against another human player. The player has a character roster of ten fighters to choose from, each with their own unique fighting style and special techniques.<br/><br/>The control layout differs from Street Fighter II and most typical fighting games inspired by Street Fighter II. Martial Champion's control system is derived from the control system of Yie Ar Kung-Fu, but simplified to simply high, medium and low attacks, instead of having to press an attack button and a direction. One unique feature this arcade game has is stages that are similar to the &quot;high-jump&quot; stages seen in Capcom's later fighting games such as X-Men vs. Street Fighter. Another unique feature is that certain characters carry weapons which can be disarmed by their opponent and used against them.<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;Martial Champion&quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "103553": {"statistics": {}, "name": "Allied Star Police", "videogamemode": {"2149": "Single-Player"}, "videogameversion": {"113437": "iPhone/iPad edition"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1112847.png", "videogametheme": {"2264": "Science Fiction"}, "usersrated": "1", "average": "6", "videogamegenre": {"2166": "Real Time Strategy"}, "videogameplatform": {"6826": "iPad"}, "poll": {}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1112847_t.png", "description": "We are getting ready to release Allied Star Police for the iOS &mdash; and we are super-thrilled!

Using just a standard deck of playing cards and a record sheet, the player defends a city against a stream of attackers, trying to hold out until the deck is exhausted, at which time a score may be figured based on how well the city survived.<br/><br/>Originally created on a business flight because I wish I had something I could play on a tiny airplane tray and all I had was a deck of cards and a notebook, it has been playtested and developed further as a submission for the Solitaire Print and Play Contest in July 2011.<br/><br/>Game Play<br/>The record sheet divides a city into four sections, each with defenders, walls and city ratings. Each turn, the player will use hand cards to generate reinforcements, repairs, defensive sorties and other special actions based on the rank and suit of the cards he has. Afterward, the enemy troops appear based on card draws where each suit corresponds to a quadrant of the city and the rank indicates strength. However, each suit of enemy has an ability or advantage that makes them a little different from each other when attacking or appearing. The attack process is straightforward and occurs automatically each round after both the player and the enemy have played their cards.<br/><br/>Over the course of the game the player may make more informed decisions about how to spend his cards based on which cards he's already seen come out of the deck, but luck (good and bad) is still present in which cards he gets in hand to spend and where and in what order the enemies arrive. Many cards can be spent in more than one way by the player, so there is a degree of hand management as well.<br/><br/>The game is designed to play with a standard deck of cards and a record sheet, making this a very portable, small-footprint game. I've played it holding the whole deck in one hand and simply placing the discards face-up at the bottom of the deck, while making my notes and tracking information on the record sheet.<br/><br/>"}, "103573": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1317518.jpg", "poll": {}, "boardgamedesigner": {"50725": {"name": "Darren J.

In my capacity of moderator for both the Specialist Games Forum, and The Conclave inquisitor forum, I have the pleasure of seeing many new people come over to playing Inquisitor for the first time, and one of the areas in which people struggle is the process of thinking up the background for a new character.<br/><br/>This is, of course, a process that many gamers will go through with other GW games - many people invest more effort in their armies or gangs if they have made some degree of simple backstory for the key players. However, Inquisitor is unique in requiring this background as a key part of the game.

Steven Stamkos was announced to be the game's cover athlete on June 22, 2011, at the NHL Awards Show in Las Vegas, Nevada. The game notably includes more live goalies (i.e. players can have real contact with the goalies, the goalies may fight against each other), improved Be A Pro mode, improved physics engine, and the ability to play the 2011 NHL Winter Classic.<br/><br/>New Features<br/>NHL 12 re-introduces goalie contact to the NHL series.Players will have the ability to hit the goalies.<br/>Goalies will be able to fight each other.<br/>The Be a Pro mode will be more authentic. New additions include the ability to start in the CHL(for up to four seasons.), play through 18 career levels, be drafted in the NHL Entry Draft, get tasks from the coach, and simulate games to the player's next shift.<br/>Improved physics will allow for more realistic hits with helmets coming off, players being hit into the bench, knuckleball shots, shattered glass, and improved puck movements.<br/> Players will not as easily lose total balance if they're hit. For example, a player might use their hands or stumble to his knees to regain balance if hit.<br/>Players will be able to play the 2011 NHL Winter Classic at Pittsburgh's Heinz Field with fans donning Winter Classic gear. <br/>An all-new feature, the Action Tracker, will track simulated games' every movement. <br/>Improved trading logic will make it much more difficult to trade for elite players in the Be A GM mode. <br/>Younger players will demand lower salaries in free agency than in previous versions of the Be a GM mode.<br/><br/>Leagues and teams<br/>NHL 12 will include seven professional leagues: the National Hockey League (NHL), American Hockey League (AHL), Czech Extraliga, SM-liiga, Deutsche Eishockey Liga (DEL), Elitserien (SEL), and National League A (NLA). Although the Kontinental Hockey League (KHL) is ranked as the top professional European league, it never has been included in the NHL series (though the former Russian Superleague was included in NHL 09), nor has it been announced to be included in NHL 12. The game will also include the amateur Canadian Hockey League, which comprises the Quebec Major Junior Hockey League (QMJHL), Ontario Hockey League (OHL), and Western Hockey League (WHL).<br/><br/>The game will include the new Winnipeg Jets team, originally the Atlanta Thrashers, therefore effectively replacing the Atlanta Thrashers team in the game. The V&auml;xj&ouml; Lakers Hockey team will replace S&ouml;dert&auml;lje SK in the Elitserien league, as the V&auml;xj&ouml; Lakers Hockey team managed to qualify for the 2011-12 Elitserien season at the expense of S&ouml;dert&auml;lje SK. EHC M&uuml;nchen, promoted to the Deutsche Eishockey Liga in 2010, replacing Kassel Huskies, will also be included. The Chilliwack Bruins of the WHL will be relocated to Victoria, British Columbia for the start of the 2011-12 WHL season and will therefore be replaced by the Victoria Royals, a new team in the same franchise.

Players must exercise the highest level of caution because a rotten plank of wood in the bridge might break at any time, causing the player &ndash; or worse, some of the precious treasure &ndash; to plunge into the gorge. What's more, the other treasure hunters will be only too glad to pilfer your finds should you give them the chance.<br/><br/>The goal in Die Br&uuml;cke am Rio D'Oro is to cross the bridge (a 3D structure inside the box), grab the treasure and cross the bridge again to return the treasure to your camp. On your turn, you roll a number of dice to determine how far you move. Each die face shows how far you must move and possibly some event:<br/><br/>     Danger, which adds another die roll which may cause the bridge to (partly) collapse at your location, or may cause you to lose a treasure;<br/>     Repair, which allows you to repair a damaged part of the bridge;<br/>     Pilfer, which allows you to steal a treasure from another player, if you land on his location.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>There are three dice: a green die, which in general permits only slow, but safe movement, a yellow die, which gives a good chance to pilfer treasure, and a red die, which allows for fast, but risky movement. The number of treasures you are carrying determines how many dice you may roll: the more treasures you carry, the fewer dice you roll. After rolling, you select one die to execute.<br/><br/>If you reach the treasure cave, you can immediately claim up to three treasures. If you reach your camp, you may unload your treasures and prepare for the next crossing. If you end your move at a gap in the bridge, or if the bridge collapses under you, any treasures you are carrying are lost in the river, and you return to your base camp.<br/><br/>At the beginning of the game, the cave holds 25 treasures. The first player to carry a certain number of treasures (depending on the number of players) back to his camp wins.

The rules are much more relaxed and the attributes of players dramatically increased, giving the game its arcade feel.

Fights were included in the game, but the rules of such greatly differed from NHL rules. Fights last until a player is knocked out, and the losing player is taken out of the game permanently. Since there are only 6 players per team, after one team loses 3 fights, no additional fights are allowed. Hits are encouraged rather than penalized, with players able to knock over other players to remove them from play, incurring no penalties.

The world's superpowers have developed unprecedented weaponry, including lasers, phaser cannons, and massive combat walkers. These war machines stride across the battlefield, protected by their heavy armor, and devastate enemy troops with their fearsome cannons.<br/><br/>In Dust Warfare, players assume the roles of generals, each commanding a custom-built army of squads, walkers, and heroes. Draw upon Axis might or Allied versatility as you wage ferocious battles for control of the rare ore, VK, needed to fuel the most powerful of the superpowers' weapons.<br/><br/>The Dust Warfare rulebook introduces unprecedented player engagement. Players first get drawn into the action during the Command Phase, where you have to choose how to spend command points during an escalating battle. You might spend command points early and often to advance and sustain an early lead, or you might save them up for dramatic late-game effects that may decisively turn the tide of battle. The Command Phase presents players with the chance to exert their influence and command style upon the field of battle in an engaging new way.<br/><br/>Players have the chance to activate all their forces during the Unit Phase, and reaction mechanisms keep you fully engaged throughout your opponent's turns. As enemy units close in on yours or begin to open fire, you can choose to spend actions from your next turn to react. Keen commanders will make good use of their reaction options. They will also learn how best to feint and bait their opponents to react, draining them of available actions.<br/><br/>Designed by renowned miniatures guru Andy Chambers, the Dust Warfare: Core Rulebook integrates dynamic and engaging new game design with the stunning models from Dust Tactics. Dust Warfare players build armies from the exact same set of miniatures as Dust Tactics. As both games go forward, they will continue to draw from the same wealth of fantastically detailed miniatures.<br/><br/>Integrates with:<br/><br/>    Dust Tactics<br/>    Dust Tactics: Revised Core Set<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": {"113973": "English first edition"}, "average": "7.71815", "name": "Dust Warfare: Core Rulebook", "playingtime": "120", "boardgamemechanic": {"2001": "Action Point Allowance System"}, "age": "14", "boardgameexpansion": {}, "usersrated": "135", "boardgameaccessory": {"164860": "Dust Warfare: Allies Forces Deck"}, "boardgamesubdomain": {"4664": "Wargames"}, "boardgamefamily": {"5914": "CMGs (Collectible Miniatures Games)"}}, "103671": {"statistics": {}, "name": "Word Wash", "videogamemode": {"2149": "Single-Player"}, "videogameversion": {"113974": "Android edition"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1056454.png", "videogametheme": {"2564": "Words"}, "usersrated": "2", "average": "6.5", "videogamegenre": {"2165": "Puzzle"}, "videogameplatform": {"6063": "Android"}, "poll": {}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1056454_t.png", "description": "Goin' to the Word Wash!

The game is played in rounds, with each round consisting of four phases:<br/><br/>Each round starts with the Event phase, in which a random event may occur that affects all players.<br/><br/>The next phase is the Supply phase. Each player receives five random resource cards, plus one resource card for each caravel (a type of development card) that he owns, chosen from a common pool.<br/><br/>Then, during the Trade phase, the players trade some of their cards. One of the players, the Trade Master, determines how many resource cards (2, 3 or 4) each player must offer for trade. The player that offers the resources with the highest value becomes the new Trade Master. He chooses one of the resources offered by one of the other players, and adds it to his hand, or exchanges it with a card from the market (three face-up cards that are available for such exchanges). Then, the player that he has taken a card from gets to take a card, and so on, until all the cards have been taken.<br/><br/>Finally, during the Progression phase, the players exchange their resources for doubloons and developments. A player may exchange one set of three or more of the same resource for a development. Bigger combinations and rarer resources will allow more choice of which development can be selected from the five that are on offer. In addition, players can exchange sets of three or more different goods for doubloons, with bigger combinations earning more doubloons.<br/><br/>If a player can make a combination of ten different cards (i.e., one of each type of resource), he wins the game.

To place a ladder or token (or draw an 'intrigue' card), dice are rolled by the leading player in that turn, and each player takes off a die and resolves the appropriate action.<br/><br/>"}, "103707": {"statistics": {}, "name": "Tiffany Star (Issue 0)", "rpgproducer": {"18206": "Mike Mikesh"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1052069.jpg", "usersrated": "0", "average": "0", "rpgissue": {"11326": "Tiffany Star"}, "rpgissuearticle": {"57573": "Comments from the Coordinator"}, "rpg": {"492": "MegaTraveller"}, "rpgissueversion": {"114100": "PDF Version"}, "poll": {}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1052069_t.jpg", "description": "Subtitled:<br/><br/>Background for Continuing Adventures in the Imperia.<br/><br/>User summary:<br/><br/>This issue was labeled as a Flier and contains introductory information on this new periodical.<br/><br/>"}, "103708": {"statistics": {}, "name": "Tiffany Star (Issue 1)", "rpgproducer": {"18205": "Ed Edwards"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1052070.jpg", "usersrated": "0", "average": "0", "rpgissue": {"11326": "Tiffany Star"}, "rpgissuearticle": {"57579": "Approximate Fleet Strengths"}, "rpg": {"492": "MegaTraveller"}, "rpgissueversion": {"114101": "PDF Version"}, "poll": {}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1052070_t.jpg", "description": "From the credits:<br/><br/>Tiffany Star is a bi-monthly amateur periodical published in support of the History of the Imperium Working Group (HIWG).<br/><br/>"}, "103710": {"statistics": {}, "name": "Tiffany Star (Issue 2)", "rpgproducer": {"18205": "Ed Edwards"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1052610.jpg", "usersrated": "0", "average": "0", "rpgissue": {"11326": "Tiffany Star"}, "rpgissuearticle": {"57584": "Chairsophant Letter"}, "rpg": {"492": "MegaTraveller"}, "rpgissueversion": {"114112": "PDF Version"}, "poll": {}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1052610_t.jpg", "description": "From the credits:<br/><br/>Tiffany Star is a bi-monthly amateur periodical published in support of the History of the Imperium Working Group (HIWG).<br/><br/>"}, "103711": {"statistics": {}, "name": "Tiffany Star (Issue 3)", "rpgproducer": {"18205": "Ed Edwards"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1052611.jpg", "usersrated": "0", "average": "0", "rpgissue": {"11326": "Tiffany Star"}, "rpgissuearticle": {"57618": "Break-Up of the Solomani Confederation - 1135"}, "rpg": {"492": "MegaTraveller"}, "rpgissueversion": {"114113": "PDF Version"}, "poll": {}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1052611_t.jpg", "description": "From the credits:<br/><br/>Tiffany Star is a bi-monthly amateur periodical published in support of the History of the Imperium Working Group (HIWG).<br/><br/>"}, "103712": {"statistics": {}, "name": "Tiffany Star (Issue 4)", "rpgproducer": {"18205": "Ed Edwards"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1052614.jpg", "usersrated": "0", "average": "0", "rpgissue": {"11326": "Tiffany Star"}, "rpgissuearticle": {"57647": "Chairsophant Letter"}, "rpg": {"492": "MegaTraveller"}, "rpgissueversion": {"114114": "PDF Version"}, "poll": {}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1052614_t.jpg", "description": "From the credits:<br/><br/>Tiffany Star is a bi-monthly amateur periodical published in support of the History of the Imperium Working Group (HIWG).<br/><br/>"}, "103713": {"statistics": {}, "name": "Upgrade Complete 2", "videogamemode": {"2149": "Single-Player"}, "videogameversion": {"114115": "Flash Browser edition"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1160254.jpg", "videogameseries": {"11377": "Upgrade Complete"}, "videogametheme": {"2331": "Space"}, "usersrated": "1", "average": "8", "videogamegenre": {"2505": "Shoot 'em Up"}, "videogameplatform": {"5084": "Web Browser"}, "poll": {}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1160254_t.jpg", "description": "User Summary<br/><br/>Upgrade complete 2 is a shootemup, once again you have to spend money to upgrade not only your ship, but the music, sound effects, graphics, title screen, just about anything you can imagine and more.

In one of five european cities up to 500 virtual inhabitants pursue their daily business- trading and competing for titles and offices each of which bestows reputation and influence. All this is presented in a wealth of detail.<br/><br/>From the 3D view of the whole town players can zoom to a selected building enter that building and interact with ist contents and inhabitants. For example entering a herb shop allows the player to examine the sales room and the lab where they can even see the distilling flask! There are also over 200 building extensions each of which serves ist own unique purpose.<br/><br/>At the start of the game players can generate their own characters. They can even select their parents from a number of workmen merchants poets or even thieves. Every player can therefore inherit helpful talents on the path to glory and wealth. Then players can select professions and set the points for their further career. Eight different groups of professions are available at the beginning of the game which include such varied roles as blacksmith tincture mixer landlord preacher or even thief.<br/><br/>Depending on the chosen path players may find themselves at the searing heat of the forge behind the counter of a herb shop or waiting in the forest for the cover of night. The objective of the game depends on the different game modes: from the focused play of the mission mode to the infinite possibilities of the endless game where players build a family dynasty.<br/><br/>The missions include several different objectives such as &quot;Become mayor&quot; &quot;Obtain a monopoly over the surrounding quarries&quot; or &quot;Raise 15 000 ducats through raids&quot; A multiplayer mode for up to 8 players is included as well. To ease casual gamers into the medieval world of &quot;The Guild - Europa 1400&quot; the gameplay and navigation have been designed to be as easy as possible.<br/><br/>The different difficulty levels will make expert building and strategy game players addicted to &quot;Europa 1400 - The Guild&quot; as well. Orientation within the colourfully realised towns is pleasingly easy: By clicking an area on screen over the town the camera will softly pan in that direction.<br/><br/>A mouse click on any building moves the camera directly to the desired destination. Another mouse click enters the building. Each building contains a different situation: The tavern for instance is populated by different shady characters. As well as offering gambling and mead the tavern also lets you obtain useful information on opponents and competitors. But take care: If you are caught committing a crime you may expect to be taken to the town prison the pillory or be tortured. If you want to avoid such unpleasant surprises keep your proceedings legal as you maintain and expand your empire.<br/><br/>You can also visit one of the local churches; these visits will often end with your purse being lighter and the priest smiling happily as he hands you a letter of indulgence. Glancing into the law books at the town council's office could also help inspire one to stay within the law&hellip; most of the time.<br/><br/>Numerous positions are just waiting to be filled. Guilds churches and councils tempt players with the influence they offer. Changing alliances offering privileges or the well-considered employment of underhand measures can lead you to the heights of your career - or if carelessly used to rot in a dungeon.

You roll three dice, then select two of them and use them to select an action from the action chart.  Alternatively, you can select just one die and lock it into place for use next turn.

The first in the book is the &quot;Black Knight.&quot; It brings back the sneak attack that blackguards had from D&amp;D 3.5 at the cost of the smite good ability. The next alternate class presented is the &quot;Wrath Reaper.&quot; It presents a more necrotic take of the antipaladin. The wrath reaper is followed by the anarchistic &quot;Disciple of Discord.&quot; Instead of being concerned with the struggles between good and evil, a disciple of discord fights for the forces of chaos and individual freedom (Unfortunately, this tends to lead him down the road of madness!). The &quot;Red Sword&quot; alternate class is designed for paladins who have lost their way on the road of peace and fell to the rage and bloodlust of the battlefield (They are truly a force to be reckoned with in combat!). The final alternate class we've got lined up for the Tome of Wicked Things is the &quot;Infernal Champion.&quot; The infernal champion has made a powerful pact with a demon (or other dark patron) and now serves them.

Players alternate placing tokens on a 4 x 4 grid (with an extra space in the bottom left).  Tokens must be placed in a proscribed order (red then white then blue).  The player who is forced to complete a set of three colours anywhere in a vertical, horizontal or diagonal line is the loser.<br/><br/>In The Great Quarter Century Race Game, 2-3 players bluff and guess their way through the 25 spaces on the board.  One player will hide a token in a hand and present both hands to the active player, who will select one.  If the hand without the token is chosen, the active player advances on the track, otherwise it is the next player's turn.  Some spaces will cause the token to advance further, and landing on a space occupied by another token will send that token backward on the track.

A bright sunny day &ndash; scarlet strawberries, sweet-scented raspberries, tasty apples, still warm pink scum, the humming of bees...

Why not open a few jars and taste some of each. Of and it would be lovely to bake some pies with jam...<br/><br/>Now you can not only eat jam, you can play The Jam. In this game you need to make all sorts of jam and bake pies. At the start of the game each player has a hand of four cards and a task sheet; the sheet shows different combinations of jam and pies that you need to make to earn extra points at the end of the game. Players receive points by completing tasks, and also for each jam they make and each pie they bake. The one who has the most points at the end of the game wins.<br/><br/>All cards in the game can be used as either an Ingredient (the image at the bottom of the card) or a Recipe (jam, pies or fruit salad &ndash; the upper part of the card). At the beginning of the game the top eight cards are placed on the table face up, forming the Basket with Ingredients, fruits and berries.<br/><br/>How do we make jam? A player plays a jam Recipe from his hand, then places the necessary Ingredient on top of it, which he takes from the Basket (&quot;Raspberry jam&quot; from the hand + Raspberry from the Basket and so on). Fruit salad and pies are made a similar way, only to make a pie you need to use a completed jam Recipe (by yourself or one you received from trade) instead of taking it from the Basket.<br/><br/>The game is turn-based, and each player's turn has a few phases:<br/><br/><br/>     Draw a card &ndash; take the top card from the deck.<br/>     Trade &ndash; players can trade Recipes they made with other players.<br/>     Play a card &ndash; you can make jam, bake pies, make a fruit salad; you can use one of the special rules; finally you can play a card as an Ingredient and place it in the Basket.<br/>     Discard &ndash; you must discard Ingredients used to make a Recipe on your previous turn. <br/><br/><br/>The game has a few special cards with special features:<br/><br/><br/>     &quot;The Bear&quot; goes to the player with the most baked pies and awards him 10 points &ndash; but eats one of the pies.<br/>     &quot;Karlsman&quot; goes to the player who can offer him the most jam; he grants 7 points but eats the jam.<br/>     &quot;Cone jam&quot; can be made using any Ingredient, and can then be used to make any pie.<br/><br/><br/>The game ends once all the cards are used, including cards in the players' hands. Points are counted to see who the winner is. Different players complete the tasks on their task sheets differently: Some try to make &quot;Winter jam&quot; or bake &quot;Pies for granny&quot;, while others collect &quot;Favorite fruit&quot;.

This expansion details rich new mechanics for social encounters, making them every bit as engaging and important as combat. You will also find new careers, enemies, and secret societies.<br/><br/>Verbal sparring<br/>The nobles of the Old World live in a complex feudal system. Although the system imposes a degree of order upon those enmeshed in it, there are many incidents of disorder and conflict, especially between nobles of comparable rank. There is often no set notion as to which noble outranks the other, and the slight differences in rank have prompted bitter conflicts.<br/><br/>The Old World is a violent land of constant war, but some conflicts, even the most bitter, are fought with words. Lure of Power explores the intricacies of heated social encounters, providing guidance and examples for GMs, including optional mechanics that let player characters shame their opponents into submission. Simple insults and name-calling won&rsquo;t win these complicated interchanges, but perhaps your character will show up for an event escorted by the former paramour of a jilted, broken-hearted lover. Best your opponent in a duel of words, and he may live with the humiliation for years.<br/><br/>Nobles have more to do than nurse old hostilities, of course, and Lure of Power offers several new careers focused on noble privileges and responsibilities.<br/><br/>Slaves to desire<br/>Lure of Power explores the secret pleasures and vices that corrupt many of the Old World&rsquo;s populace in Liber Ecstatica, a sourcebook aimed toward GMs. Slaanesh spreads his influence within the Realm of Chaos by fueling and feeding upon the extremes of mortal emotion and experience. The Dark Prince provides a particular allure to nobles, as their positions of power and idle time afford them greater opportunities to explore rare luxuries and sensations.<br/><br/>The minions of Slaanesh give in to their dark passions, and they excel at luring others to join them. The greatest and most terrible of their abilities is that to corrupt and seduce the most loyal and pure. Those marked by Slaanesh are said to be able to gaze directly into the most hidden depths of a mortal&rsquo;s soul and rip out his most secret desires and fears. The Dark Prince&rsquo;s marauders are vain and obsess over their rippling muscles and taut sinew. They adorn themselves with tattoos and aspire toward physical perfection. Beastmen view Slaanesh as the power that grants them virility. Sorcerers of Slaanesh focus on coercion, domination and submission.<br/><br/>Liber Ecstatica includes an adventure that leads characters into a world filled with the temptations of physical and aesthetic pleasures. In the world of the nobles, power can lead to corruption, and heroes may pave a smoother road to success with words than with swords.<br/><br/>", "usersrated": "26", "rpgsetting": {"272": "Warhammer World"}, "average": "7.83077", "rpgissuearticle": {"156673": "I w\u00f3d\u017a nas na pokuszenie"}, "rpggenre": {"156": "Fantasy (Low Fantasy)"}, "rpg": {"2775": "Warhammer Fantasy Roleplay (3rd Edition)"}, "rpgcategory": {"2084": "Scenario / Adventure / Module"}, "poll": {}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1180019_t.jpg", "rpgpodcastepisode": {"81647": "Episode 17 \u2013 Slaanesh"}}, "103852": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1057511.jpg", "poll": {}, "boardgamedesigner": {"50733": {"name": "Associazione Alma"}}, "statistics": {}, "yearpublished": "2011", "maxplayers": "5", "boardgameartist": {"50732": "Paola Colleoni"}, "boardgamepublisher": {"4": {"name": "(Self-Published)"}}, "maxplaytime": "30", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1057511_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "30", "boardgamecategory": {"1094": {"name": "Educational"}}, "description": "A game of life narrating the history of Pontremoli (town in Northern Tuscany) and its territory, from neolitic sculptures through medieval rivalries and ambulant book sellers, up to the twenty-first century, with the town still known as a &quot;city of books&quot;.<br/><br/>Game-play follows standard game of life rules: players roll a die, move up their pawn a corresponding number of spaces on a 54 spaces track, and follow the instructions written on the space where their movement ends.

Although the characters in Spookybeans can be from anywhere in or out of the city, the exploits of our creepy kids and adults takes place in a section of the city known as The Hollow, a near-suburban neighborhood surrounding a gigantic 200-year old cemetery. Since the 1960&rsquo;s, this area has become a cultural mecca for trendy hippies, rockers, gang-bangers, punks, and of course, Spookybeans.

As you are brave adventurers, you venture into the magic labyrinth to free the wizard &ndash; but you cannot do this without the help of its inhabitants. Visit the inhabitants and bring them certain items. You will receive coveted magic stones as a reward! The first player to fill his magic key with the magic stones and return to his starting field wins. But beware! Danger lurks everywhere...<br/><br/>In Das Elektronik Labyrinth, designer Reiner Knizia marries his facility for electronics in board games (e.g., Wer war's? and Die Insel) with Max J. Kobbert's long-running Labyrinth series of games from Ravensburger.<br/><br/>The basic game play is the same as in Labyrinth. The board has a set of tiles fixed solidly onto it; the remaining tiles slide in and out of the rows created by the fixed tiles to make up the labyrinth. One tile stands outside the labyrinth, and on a player's turn, he takes this tile and slides it into a row, moving all the tiles and pushing one out the other side of the board, which becomes the piece for the next player to add to the maze.<br/><br/>After inserting the tile, the player may move his pawn. Each player starts on a corner of the game board and must reach the starting location diagonally opposite. If he manages to do so, he gains a number of magic stones. A player can also acquire magic stones from the inhabitants of the labyrinth. If a player lands on an inhabitant, it tells the players what item it desires. A player who finds the item, with items being scattered throughout the labyrinth, can deliver it to the inhabitant for a reward. What's more, an inhabitant may give a visiting player a treasure chest to be delivered to another inhabitant, also for a reward.<br/><br/>In order to complete his magic key and free the wizard, a player needs fifteen magic stones. The first player that returns to his starting location with a complete key wins.<br/><br/>The game comes with a &quot;book&quot; containing electronics. This book takes care of all the interactions with the inhabitants of the labyrinth. Whenever a player interacts with an inhabitant, he pushes the corresponding buttons from the book, and the book will respond by telling the player his assignment, reward, etc.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": {"139570": "English first edition"}, "average": "6.40421", "name": "Electronic Labyrinth", "playingtime": "60", "boardgamemechanic": {"2011": "Modular Board"}, "age": "8", "usersrated": "95", "boardgamefamily": {"114": "Ravensburger Labyrinth Games"}}, "103884": {"rpgitemversion": {"259949": "ePub version"}, "poll": {}, "name": "Zombocalypse Now", "rpgproducer": {"3": "(Uncredited)"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2318670.jpg", "usersrated": "1", "average": "8", "rpgissuearticle": {"143393": "Zombocalypse Now from Atherton Haight"}, "rpg": {"11366": "Chooseomatic Books"}, "statistics": {}, "rpgcategory": {"2136": "Solitaire Adventure"}, "rpggenre": {"185": "Comedy / Satire"}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2318670_t.jpg", "description": "Publisher Blurb<br/><br/>Zombocalypse Now is a comedy/horror reimagining of the choose-your-own-ending books you grew up with.

Featuring stunningly detailed and painted miniatures, the X-Wing Miniatures Game recreates exciting Star Wars space combat throughout its several included scenarios. Select your crew, plan your maneuvers, and complete your mission!<br/><br/>Whatever your chosen vessel, the rules of X-Wing facilitate fast and visceral gameplay that puts you in the middle of Star Wars fiercest firefights. Each ship type has its own unique piloting dial, which is used to secretly select a speed and maneuver each turn. After planning maneuvers, each ship's dial is revealed and executed (starting with the lowest skilled pilot). So whether you rush headlong toward your enemy showering his forward deflectors in laser fire, or dance away from him as you attempt to acquire a targeting lock, you'll be in total control throughout all the tense dogfighting action.<br/><br/>Star Wars: X-Wing features (three) unique missions, and each has its own set of victory conditions and special rules; with such a broad selection of missions, only clever and versatile pilots employing a range of tactics will emerge victorious. What's more, no mission will ever play the same way twice, thanks to a range of customization options, varied maneuvers, and possible combat outcomes. Damage, for example, is determined through dice and applied in the form of a shuffled Damage Deck. For some hits your fighter sustains, you'll draw a card that assigns a special handicap. Was your targeting computer damaged, affecting your ability to acquire a lock on the enemy? Perhaps an ill-timed weapon malfunction will limit your offensive capabilities. Or worse yet, your pilot could be injured, compromising his ability to focus on the life-and-death struggle in which he is engaged...<br/><br/>The Star Wars: X-Wing starter set includes everything you need to begin your battles, such as scenarios, cards, and fully assembled and painted ships. What's more, Star Wars: X-Wing's quick-to-learn ruleset establishes the foundation for a system that can be expanded with your favorite ships and characters from the Star Wars universe.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": {"262357": "Brazilian First edition"}, "boardgameintegration": {"183562": "Star Wars: X-Wing Miniatures Game \u2013 The Force Awakens Core Set"}, "average": "7.86633", "name": "Star Wars: X-Wing Miniatures Game", "playingtime": "45", "boardgamemechanic": {"2689": "Action / Movement Programming"}, "age": "14", "boardgameexpansion": {}, "usersrated": "17379", "boardgameaccessory": {"184761": "Star Wars: X-Wing Miniatures Game \u2013 Bases and Pegs"}, "boardgamesubdomain": {"4667": "Customizable Games"}, "boardgamefamily": {"22972": "FlightPath"}}, "103886": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1474141.jpg", "is_expanded_by": {"137182": {"name": "Star Wars: The Card Game \u2013 A Dark Time"}}, "poll": {}, "boardgamedesigner": {"1533": {"name": "Eric M.

The Galactic Empire has consolidated its dominion through the might of the Imperial Navy. In the underworld of the Empire's most populated planets, and in strongholds throughout the Outer Rim, powerful gangsters rule vast criminal organizations. From the shadows, those lost to the grip of the dark side of the Force scheme to bring their evil designs to bear on an already oppressed galaxy.<br/><br/>Yet not all hope is lost. The Rebel Alliance resists the iron grip of the Empire. Smugglers and other fringe elements lend their aid to the Rebellion. And unknown to the Emperor and his dark minions of the Sith, the last remnants of the noble Jedi Order work tirelessly to restore peace and order to the galaxy.<br/><br/>Star Wars: The Card Game is a two-player card game that puts one player in command of the Rebels (light side, with the factions Jedi, Rebel Alliance, and Smugglers And Spies), and one player in command of the Empire (dark side, with the factions Sith, Imperial Navy, and Scum And Villainy). The Balance of the Force expansion allows multi-player games. The game is set within the time-frame of the original Star Wars trilogy.<br/><br/>Each player has a deck of objective cards representing various missions plus a deck of player cards of units (characters, vehicles, droids and creatures), events, enhancements and fates. Each objective is linked to a set of five player cards. Deck construction consists of choosing which objectives are to go into your objective deck, then adding each of those objective's set of five player cards to your player deck. Game play consists of deploying cards to your tableau, attacking your opponent's objectives, defending your own objectives, and committing cards to the Force Struggle.<br/><br/>The Empire wins if the Death Star dial reaches 12, with this dial increasing by one on each dark side turn, effectively putting a timer on the game. It may also be increased by winning the Force struggle, destroying light side objectives, and via card effects.

These two games were developed by Chunsoft and were published by Nintendo.<br/><br/>The two versions are mostly identical, with the Blue version taking advantage of the dual-screen features and increased graphical capabilities of the Nintendo DS. The game has six Pok&eacute;mon exclusive to each version. As of July 25, 2007, Pok&eacute;mon Mystery Dungeon: Blue Rescue Team sold 3.08 million copies worldwide.<br/><br/>The player starts out as a human who turned into a Pok&eacute;mon, which can be one of sixteen Pok&eacute;mon(Bulbasaur, Squirtle, Charmander, Cyndaquil, Totodile, Chikorita, Treecko, Torchic, Mudkip, Pikachu, Eevee, Machop, Cubone, Psyduck, Meowth, and Skitty) and is determined by a personality quiz taken at the beginning of the game. The player chooses a partner Pok&eacute;mon which is one of ten Pok&eacute;mon (which excludes the last six stated above and the Pok&eacute;mon of the same type). The game is mission-based with many jobs, which can be found on the bulletin board, requested by mail, or initiated through story events, and include rescuing Pok&eacute;mon, delivering items, or escorting clients. If the player successfully completes a job, they receive a reward, and Rescue Points, which increase a team's rank.<br/><br/>These jobs take part in dungeons, of which the layout is randomized.[1] The objective is to either finish a job, or go through all the floors to find the exit. In the dungeon, there are wild Pok&eacute;mon that battle with the player's team. These battles are turn-based, and take place in the dungeon map. Pok&eacute;mon fight using the four moves they know, by using a standard 'A button' attack, or throwing rocks and other items. While going through the dungeon, the player gets hungry, and has to eat food either found in the dungeon, or bought in advance.<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;Pok\u00e9mon Mystery Dungeon: Blue Rescue Team and Red Rescue Team&quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "103906": {"statistics": {}, "name": "Pok\u00e9mon Mystery Dungeon: Explorers of Time and Explorers of Darkness", "videogamemode": {"2149": "Single-Player"}, "videogameversion": {"322975": "eShop Wii U Downloadable edition"}, "average": "7.63333", "videogameseries": {"5184": "Pok\u00e9mon Mystery Dungeon"}, "videogametheme": {"2278": "Anime"}, "videogamegenre": {"2413": "Roguelike"}, "usersrated": "6", "videogamefranchise": {"5252": "Pok\u00e9mon"}, "videogameplatform": {"4734": "Nintendo DS"}, "videogamehonor": {"37508": "2008 Japan Game Awards Game of the Year Winner"}, "poll": {}, "description": "Pok&eacute;mon Mystery Dungeon: Explorers of Time (\u30dd\u30b1\u30e2\u30f3\u4e0d\u601d\u8b70\u306e\u30c0\u30f3\u30b8\u30e7\u30f3 \u6642\u306e\u63a2\u691c\u968a Pok&eacute;mon Fushigi no Danjon Toki no Tankentai?, lit. &quot;Pok&eacute;mon Mystery Dungeon: Time Exploration Team&quot;) and Pok&eacute;mon Mystery Dungeon: Explorers of Darkness (\u30dd\u30b1\u30e2\u30f3\u4e0d\u601d\u8b70\u306e\u30c0\u30f3\u30b8\u30e7\u30f3 \u95c7\u306e\u63a2\u691c\u968a Pok&eacute;mon Fushigi no Danjon Yami no Tankentai?, lit. &quot;Pok&eacute;mon Mystery Dungeon: Darkness Exploration Team&quot;) are a matched pair of Pok&eacute;mon games for the Nintendo DS.

Kinect competes with the Wii Remote Plus and PlayStation Move with PlayStation Eye motion controllers for the Wii and PlayStation 3 home consoles, respectively.<br/><br/>Kinect was launched in North America on November 4, 2010, in Europe on November 10, 2010, in Australia, New Zealand and Singapore on November 18, 2010, and in Japan on November 20, 2010. Purchase options for the sensor peripheral include a bundle with the game Kinect Adventures and console bundles with either a 4 GB or 250 GB Xbox 360 console and Kinect Adventures.<br/>After selling a total of 8 million units in its first 60 days, the Kinect holds the Guinness World Record of being the &quot;fastest selling consumer electronics device&quot;. 10 million units of the Kinect sensor have been shipped as of March 9, 2011.<br/><br/>Microsoft has released of a non-commercial Kinect software development kit for Windows on June 16, 2011, with a commercial version following at a later date.

Unlike virtually every other Zombie game, your goal is not to survive, but to kill as many zombies as possible before you die, which results in very engrossing solo or cooperative play.<br/><br/>IIGD puts you smack in the middle of a hopeless scenario where endless zombies lurch and ramble toward you, never stopping until you are dead or become one of them (Zead).

The Ortus arena is believed to be the origin of all things, the place where the prime elements were fed with the raw energies to shape the world as we know it. How true this is can be debated, but this is the only place where energy still flows freely in its purest form. Players must harvest these energies and channel them to their warriors as fast and unpredictable Wind warriors, clever positioning of supporting Fire warriors, and devastating blows from lethal Water warriors will all be necessary to claim victory.<br/><br/>Ortus takes place on a hexagonal board, with each player starting with eight warriors (two of each element) on the back row (the &quot;Haven&quot;) in an order of their choice. Ortus is played in rounds, which each consist of four stages:<br/><br/><br/>     Collect energy: Each warrior on an energy well generates energy, which flows into the player's general pool.<br/>     Maneuver warriors: Players can spend 1 energy per hex to move warriors to better locations or attack opposing warriors.<br/>     Return the fallen: When the active player returns his fallen warriors to his Haven, his turn ends.<br/>     Defend: Energy remaining from the maneuver phase can be used to defend warriors against incoming attacks; more specifically, each attack has a certain power, and if the defender is unable or unwilling to pay energy equal to this power, the warrior falls.<br/><br/><br/>When a player occupies five energy wells at the start of his turn or has removed all eight opposing warriors, he wins.<br/><br/>Ortus has a gentle learning curve, starting with the Basic game, which can be taught in around eight minutes. From there, players can introduce the special rules for each of the elemental warriors one at a time to learn the full Advanced game. Each warrior has two unique skills that differentiate it from the others. Being able to move all of your warriors on the board gives an enormous amount of tactical options. The excitement of the game lies in the careful planning of your attacks, knowing when to advance and when to withhold Energy as well as knowing whether to save or sacrifice your warriors.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": {"115221": "Multilingual first edition"}, "average": "6.61125", "name": "Ortus", "playingtime": "30", "boardgamemechanic": {"2001": "Action Point Allowance System"}, "age": "12", "boardgameexpansion": {}, "usersrated": "80", "boardgamefamily": {"8374": "Crowdfunding: Kickstarter"}}, "103977": {"statistics": {}, "name": "Peter Packer", "videogamemode": {"2149": "Single-Player"}, "videogameversion": {"115231": "iPhone edition"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1073063.png", "videogametheme": {"2351": "Puzzle"}, "usersrated": "1", "average": "6", "videogamegenre": {"2147": "Action"}, "videogameplatform": {"6826": "iPad"}, "poll": {}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1073063_t.png", "description": "Peter Packer Packed a Package...<br/><br/>Help Peter on the production line by throwing the boxes into the correct holes.
