It is 400AD and Britain is on the brink of a power vacuum as Rome looks to leave these shores and defend her empire closer to home. Foreign invaders, like the Picts, Scots, Vikings and Saxons, will take advantage and claim this land for their own. Romano-British rule is coming to and end and we are at the dawn of the Anglo-Saxon era. You must defend the Anglo-Saxon heptarchy from these foreign invaders and quash the rebellious Britons. But history is written and there is an ever looming threat. In 1066, William Duke of Normandy became king of all England and ended the Anglo-Saxon era once and for all. Can you make this land your own before the Norman invasion?<br/><br/>Seofan, the Anglo-Saxons board game, is a game for 1 to 4 players. You progress through the game from 400AD to 1066AD. Your Bretwalda will travel the seven kingdoms of England along roads like the great Fosse Way, Ermine Street and Watling Street, seeking to control towns by building forts (to exercise your military might), monasteries (to convert the pagan settlers), mints (a source of wealth), and burhs (Anglo-Saxon settlements of power). You will use warriors, missionaries, farmers and traders to settle and defend the kingdoms, and resource cards to fund your settlement, your armies, your church and your economy. Each turn your Bretwalda can take actions to travel the seven kingdoms, to enact great battles, to convert pagan settlers, to trade, and to build your realm.<br/><br/>Game events will be throwing unexpected surprises at you as you proceed through each decade, like the legend of Arthur, the writings of the Venerable Bede, the Viking invasions, the revolutionary laws of Aethelberht, Offa and Ine, or the glorious coronation of King Alfred the Great. These events may be your saviour, or they may signal your downfall. All the while, rebellious uprisings can cause the level of civil unrest to rise. Can you conquer and control the seven kingdoms before the level of civil unrest explodes, and rewrite history by building a permanent Anglo-Saxon England before the Norman invasion of 1066?<br/><br/>Overview of Gameplay<br/><br/>The game can be played solo or co-operatively, with 1 to 4 players.<br/><br/>The game board shows a map of the seven kingdoms of England (Northumbria, Mercia, East Anglia, Essex, Sussex, Kent and Wessex), and the towns of those kingdoms in which you will settle, battle, trade and rule. These towns are linked by roads along which the players (and invaders!) can travel.<br/><br/>Each game turn is broken into distinct phases. In the Draw phase you draw resource cards from a resource deck into your hand. In the Actions phase each player has 4 actions which they can use in a variety of ways: they can spend resource cards to place red, green, yellow and blue blocks (representing warriors, farmers, missionaries and traders) across the towns of the seven kingdoms; they can build mints, forts, monasteries and burhs; they can travel the map from town to town, repelling invaders and rebels (represented by black blocks); they can trade or crusade or appease local unrest, and progress through the game by adding a decade to the game calendar. During the Conflict phase you resolve battles between your warriors and the pagans. During the Rebellion phase you draw cards from a rebellion deck, which determines in which towns the locals are rebelling against your rule (and more black blocks appear). Finally, in the Progress phase, you can advance the game time through the seven eras from 400AD to 1066AD, and an event card is drawn to re-enact real events from history on the game board. You can choose to progress more slowly, giving you more time to build and settle and defend the realm, but when you do the level of civil unrest will rise too. As you progress through the game you progress through time, and real events from history will throw up surprises - some good (like a great coronation feast), and some bad (like a mutinous group of mercenaries).<br/><br/>To win the game you must control all seven kingdoms. To control a kingdom you must repel, defeat, convert or settle all black blocks in the kingdom and build one of each type of special building (fort, monastery, mint, and burh). This allows you to place a celtic cross in the kingdom and cement your rule. The special buildings can only be built by settling your warriors, missionaries, farmers and traders in the towns on the game board. You must do all this before the level of civil unrest rises (through out of control rebellions and invasions) and before the Norman invasion of 1066.<br/><br/>"}, "103534": {"videogame": ["The Gold Collection II (ZX Spectrum)"], "poll": [], "name": "Pentagram", "videogamemode": ["Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["UK MSX Edition", "UK ZX Spectrum Edition"], "average": "0", "videogameseries": ["Sabreman"], "videogametheme": ["Fantasy"], "usersrated": "0", "videogamedeveloper": ["Ultimate Play the Game"], "videogamegenre": ["Action Adventure"], "videogameplatform": ["MSX", "ZX Spectrum"], "statistics": [], "videogamepublisher": ["Ultimate Play the Game"], "videogamecompilation": ["The Gold Collection II (ZX Spectrum)"], "description": "From the cassette inlay:<br/><br/>The quest for the PENTAGRAM could not have been further from Sabreman's mind as he collected his Grand Arch Wizardry spell book from the Old Mystic Curio Shoppe in Conjour town.

The game comprises of a revolving green plastic base which looks a little bit like a small green hill. On the top of the hill you place a small plastic model of Peter Pan. He doesn't serve any purpose in the game at all, but the girls quite like him! There are eight plastic bluebell cups which are placed over eight holes on the revolving board. Under one of these is placed a small Tinker Bell fairy and the aim of the game is to discover exactly where she is! You might think this all depends on guess work but it does not because Tinker Bell makes a 'tinkle bell' sound when she moves.<br/><br/>So how does the game work? After you have put all the above pieces in place, each player then receive a number of playing cards. These have pictures of Peter Pan, Wendy, John and Michael, and depending which cards you have determines whether you can spin the revolving board or not! It does not tell you who should go first in the instructions but we normally say it is the youngest player. So if that player has the appropriate card, they can trade it in for a spin of the board. And this is what happens...<br/><br/>Firstly they have to be quite careful because if the board is spun too heavily all the bluebells will go flying. If you spin it too gently Tinker Bell will not make a sound. Therefore, the key to success in this game is getting your spin just right! If you do, the board should spin round and you should hear some tinkling music which hopefully should lead you to working out which bluebell Tinker Bell is hiding under! Now this is actually easier said than done! As an adult with probably better levels of concentration than my daughters, I find it quite difficult. You really need to have total quiet and place your ear as close to the board as you can!

They fight enemies with their sword (Valkyrie) and trident (Sandra). The players can also hold down the attack button to use magic.<br/><br/>The PC Engine version of the game sports a big number of differences that almost make it a new game. The level design has been changed in the later levels, new stages have been added, you are given passwords to save your progress, there is an extra boss battle right before you fight the last boss, and the ending is completely different from the arcade version.<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;Valkyrie no Densetsu&quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "103549": {"boardgamedesigner": ["Kevin Eagles"], "poll": [], "name": "Office Dice", "playingtime": "30", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": ["Dice Rolling"], "yearpublished": "2011", "usersrated": "0", "maxplayers": "5", "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1104072_t.jpg", "average": "0", "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["(Self-Published)", "(Web published)"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1104072.jpg", "boardgameversion": ["Print & Play edition"], "maxplaytime": "30", "boardgamecategory": ["Dice", "Print & Play"], "age": "12", "minplaytime": "30", "description": "Office Dice puts each player in control of one &lsquo;team&rsquo; of a faceless corporate giant, where the only currency is completed projects, and the only job security is never being noticed.

It was Konami's third fighting game after the 1985 releases Yie Ar Kung-Fu and Galactic Warriors, and their first release that came after the success of Capcom's 1991 arcade hit Street Fighter II.<br/><br/>Martial Champion follows the same fighting game conventions established by Street Fighter II: the player's character fights against his or her opponent in best two-out-of-three matches in a single player tournament mode with the computer or against another human player. The player has a character roster of ten fighters to choose from, each with their own unique fighting style and special techniques.<br/><br/>The control layout differs from Street Fighter II and most typical fighting games inspired by Street Fighter II. Martial Champion's control system is derived from the control system of Yie Ar Kung-Fu, but simplified to simply high, medium and low attacks, instead of having to press an attack button and a direction. One unique feature this arcade game has is stages that are similar to the &quot;high-jump&quot; stages seen in Capcom's later fighting games such as X-Men vs. Street Fighter. Another unique feature is that certain characters carry weapons which can be disarmed by their opponent and used against them.<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;Martial Champion&quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "103553": {"poll": [], "name": "Allied Star Police", "videogamemode": ["Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["iPhone/iPad edition"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1112847.png", "videogametheme": ["Science Fiction"], "usersrated": "1", "videogamedeveloper": ["PopCap Games"], "videogamegenre": ["Real Time Strategy", "Tower Defense"], "videogameplatform": ["iPad", "iPhone"], "average": "6", "statistics": [], "videogamepublisher": ["PopCap Games"], "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1112847_t.png", "description": "We are getting ready to release Allied Star Police for the iOS &mdash; and we are super-thrilled!

Using just a standard deck of playing cards and a record sheet, the player defends a city against a stream of attackers, trying to hold out until the deck is exhausted, at which time a score may be figured based on how well the city survived.<br/><br/>Originally created on a business flight because I wish I had something I could play on a tiny airplane tray and all I had was a deck of cards and a notebook, it has been playtested and developed further as a submission for the Solitaire Print and Play Contest in July 2011.<br/><br/>Game Play<br/>The record sheet divides a city into four sections, each with defenders, walls and city ratings. Each turn, the player will use hand cards to generate reinforcements, repairs, defensive sorties and other special actions based on the rank and suit of the cards he has. Afterward, the enemy troops appear based on card draws where each suit corresponds to a quadrant of the city and the rank indicates strength. However, each suit of enemy has an ability or advantage that makes them a little different from each other when attacking or appearing. The attack process is straightforward and occurs automatically each round after both the player and the enemy have played their cards.<br/><br/>Over the course of the game the player may make more informed decisions about how to spend his cards based on which cards he's already seen come out of the deck, but luck (good and bad) is still present in which cards he gets in hand to spend and where and in what order the enemies arrive. Many cards can be spent in more than one way by the player, so there is a degree of hand management as well.<br/><br/>The game is designed to play with a standard deck of cards and a record sheet, making this a very portable, small-footprint game. I've played it holding the whole deck in one hand and simply placing the discards face-up at the bottom of the deck, while making my notes and tracking information on the record sheet.<br/><br/>"}, "103573": {"image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1317518.jpg", "poll": [], "boardgamedesigner": ["Darren J.

Steven Stamkos was announced to be the game's cover athlete on June 22, 2011, at the NHL Awards Show in Las Vegas, Nevada. The game notably includes more live goalies (i.e. players can have real contact with the goalies, the goalies may fight against each other), improved Be A Pro mode, improved physics engine, and the ability to play the 2011 NHL Winter Classic.<br/><br/>New Features<br/>NHL 12 re-introduces goalie contact to the NHL series.Players will have the ability to hit the goalies.<br/>Goalies will be able to fight each other.<br/>The Be a Pro mode will be more authentic. New additions include the ability to start in the CHL(for up to four seasons.), play through 18 career levels, be drafted in the NHL Entry Draft, get tasks from the coach, and simulate games to the player's next shift.<br/>Improved physics will allow for more realistic hits with helmets coming off, players being hit into the bench, knuckleball shots, shattered glass, and improved puck movements.<br/> Players will not as easily lose total balance if they're hit. For example, a player might use their hands or stumble to his knees to regain balance if hit.<br/>Players will be able to play the 2011 NHL Winter Classic at Pittsburgh's Heinz Field with fans donning Winter Classic gear. <br/>An all-new feature, the Action Tracker, will track simulated games' every movement. <br/>Improved trading logic will make it much more difficult to trade for elite players in the Be A GM mode. <br/>Younger players will demand lower salaries in free agency than in previous versions of the Be a GM mode.<br/><br/>Leagues and teams<br/>NHL 12 will include seven professional leagues: the National Hockey League (NHL), American Hockey League (AHL), Czech Extraliga, SM-liiga, Deutsche Eishockey Liga (DEL), Elitserien (SEL), and National League A (NLA). Although the Kontinental Hockey League (KHL) is ranked as the top professional European league, it never has been included in the NHL series (though the former Russian Superleague was included in NHL 09), nor has it been announced to be included in NHL 12.

EHC M&uuml;nchen, promoted to the Deutsche Eishockey Liga in 2010, replacing Kassel Huskies, will also be included. The Chilliwack Bruins of the WHL will be relocated to Victoria, British Columbia for the start of the 2011-12 WHL season and will therefore be replaced by the Victoria Royals, a new team in the same franchise.

Players must exercise the highest level of caution because a rotten plank of wood in the bridge might break at any time, causing the player &ndash; or worse, some of the precious treasure &ndash; to plunge into the gorge. What's more, the other treasure hunters will be only too glad to pilfer your finds should you give them the chance.<br/><br/>The goal in Die Br&uuml;cke am Rio D'Oro is to cross the bridge (a 3D structure inside the box), grab the treasure and cross the bridge again to return the treasure to your camp. On your turn, you roll a number of dice to determine how far you move. Each die face shows how far you must move and possibly some event:<br/><br/>     Danger, which adds another die roll which may cause the bridge to (partly) collapse at your location, or may cause you to lose a treasure;<br/>     Repair, which allows you to repair a damaged part of the bridge;<br/>     Pilfer, which allows you to steal a treasure from another player, if you land on his location.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>There are three dice: a green die, which in general permits only slow, but safe movement, a yellow die, which gives a good chance to pilfer treasure, and a red die, which allows for fast, but risky movement. The number of treasures you are carrying determines how many dice you may roll: the more treasures you carry, the fewer dice you roll. After rolling, you select one die to execute.<br/><br/>If you reach the treasure cave, you can immediately claim up to three treasures. If you reach your camp, you may unload your treasures and prepare for the next crossing.

The rules are much more relaxed and the attributes of players dramatically increased, giving the game its arcade feel. The game features three players on the ice for each team, with an additional 3 players on each teams' bench. Line changes could be done in between periods. Fights were included in the game, but the rules of such greatly differed from NHL rules. Fights last until a player is knocked out, and the losing player is taken out of the game permanently. Since there are only 6 players per team, after one team loses 3 fights, no additional fights are allowed. Hits are encouraged rather than penalized, with players able to knock over other players to remove them from play, incurring no penalties. If a player scores 3 goals in a row on their respective team-the other team could score in the midst of this streak-that player becomes &quot;On Fire&quot;, making them tougher to knock down and giving them a more powerful shot.

The world's superpowers have developed unprecedented weaponry, including lasers, phaser cannons, and massive combat walkers. These war machines stride across the battlefield, protected by their heavy armor, and devastate enemy troops with their fearsome cannons.<br/><br/>In Dust Warfare, players assume the roles of generals, each commanding a custom-built army of squads, walkers, and heroes. Draw upon Axis might or Allied versatility as you wage ferocious battles for control of the rare ore, VK, needed to fuel the most powerful of the superpowers' weapons.<br/><br/>The Dust Warfare rulebook introduces unprecedented player engagement. Players first get drawn into the action during the Command Phase, where you have to choose how to spend command points during an escalating battle. You might spend command points early and often to advance and sustain an early lead, or you might save them up for dramatic late-game effects that may decisively turn the tide of battle. The Command Phase presents players with the chance to exert their influence and command style upon the field of battle in an engaging new way.<br/><br/>Players have the chance to activate all their forces during the Unit Phase, and reaction mechanisms keep you fully engaged throughout your opponent's turns. As enemy units close in on yours or begin to open fire, you can choose to spend actions from your next turn to react. Keen commanders will make good use of their reaction options. They will also learn how best to feint and bait their opponents to react, draining them of available actions.<br/><br/>Designed by renowned miniatures guru Andy Chambers, the Dust Warfare: Core Rulebook integrates dynamic and engaging new game design with the stunning models from Dust Tactics.

You are a powerful ship owner in search of wealth from the recently discovered Mundus Novus (New World). Your goal: Charter fleets of caravels to collect valuable goods (including the legendary Inca relics) and trade to form the best sets to expand your business empire and make your fortune.<br/><br/>The game is played using two decks of cards: a deck of resource cards, which contains cards representing ten different resources, and a deck of development cards, which give special benefits to their owners. The game is played in rounds, with each round consisting of four phases:<br/><br/>Each round starts with the Event phase, in which a random event may occur that affects all players.<br/><br/>The next phase is the Supply phase. Each player receives five random resource cards, plus one resource card for each caravel (a type of development card) that he owns, chosen from a common pool.<br/><br/>Then, during the Trade phase, the players trade some of their cards. One of the players, the Trade Master, determines how many resource cards (2, 3 or 4) each player must offer for trade. The player that offers the resources with the highest value becomes the new Trade Master. He chooses one of the resources offered by one of the other players, and adds it to his hand, or exchanges it with a card from the market (three face-up cards that are available for such exchanges). Then, the player that he has taken a card from gets to take a card, and so on, until all the cards have been taken.<br/><br/>Finally, during the Progression phase, the players exchange their resources for doubloons and developments. A player may exchange one set of three or more of the same resource for a development. Bigger combinations and rarer resources will allow more choice of which development can be selected from the five that are on offer. In addition, players can exchange sets of three or more different goods for doubloons, with bigger combinations earning more doubloons.<br/><br/>If a player can make a combination of ten different cards (i.e., one of each type of resource), he wins the game. Alternatively, if a player has accumulated 75 doubloons, he wins the game. If no player has achieved victory by the time the development deck runs out, the player who has accumulated the most doubloons wins.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": ["Multilingual first edition"], "name": "Mundus Novus", "playingtime": "60", "boardgamemechanic": ["Card Drafting", "Hand Management", "Set Collection", "Trading"], "age": "14", "boardgameexpansion": ["Mundus Novus Promo Cards", "Mundus Novus: Vers de Nouveaux Horizons"], "usersrated": "1452", "boardgamesubdomain": ["Family Games", "Strategy Games"], "average": "6.72595", "boardgamepodcastepisode": ["Strange Assembly 135 - An Ornamental Arrangement, Part 1", "The Gaming Gang Episode 37: Mundus Novus, Giza, Franco-Prussian War 40, and Wiz-War"]}, "103687": {"boardgamedesigner": ["Pierluca Zizzi"], "average": "5.57353", "poll": [], "name": "Lamborghini: The Official Race Game", "playingtime": "45", "minplayers": "2", "yearpublished": "2011", "usersrated": "34", "boardgamefamily": ["Sports: Auto Racing"], "maxplayers": "5", "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1079371_t.jpg", "boardgameartist": ["Giorgio De Michele"], "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["Ghenos Games", "Rio Grande Games"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1079371.jpg", "boardgameversion": ["Italian first edition"], "maxplaytime": "45", "boardgamecategory": ["Racing"], "age": "10", "minplaytime": "45", "description": "Lamborghini is a car-racing game blended with economic management as players must hire the best drivers, buy cars and components, and equip their vehicles to prepare for the qualifying sessions.

All this is presented in a wealth of detail.<br/><br/>From the 3D view of the whole town players can zoom to a selected building enter that building and interact with ist contents and inhabitants. For example entering a herb shop allows the player to examine the sales room and the lab where they can even see the distilling flask! There are also over 200 building extensions each of which serves ist own unique purpose.<br/><br/>At the start of the game players can generate their own characters. They can even select their parents from a number of workmen merchants poets or even thieves. Every player can therefore inherit helpful talents on the path to glory and wealth. Then players can select professions and set the points for their further career. Eight different groups of professions are available at the beginning of the game which include such varied roles as blacksmith tincture mixer landlord preacher or even thief.<br/><br/>Depending on the chosen path players may find themselves at the searing heat of the forge behind the counter of a herb shop or waiting in the forest for the cover of night. The objective of the game depends on the different game modes: from the focused play of the mission mode to the infinite possibilities of the endless game where players build a family dynasty.<br/><br/>The missions include several different objectives such as &quot;Become mayor&quot; &quot;Obtain a monopoly over the surrounding quarries&quot; or &quot;Raise 15 000 ducats through raids&quot; A multiplayer mode for up to 8 players is included as well.

Another mouse click enters the building. Each building contains a different situation: The tavern for instance is populated by different shady characters. As well as offering gambling and mead the tavern also lets you obtain useful information on opponents and competitors.

In this game you need to make all sorts of jam and bake pies. At the start of the game each player has a hand of four cards and a task sheet; the sheet shows different combinations of jam and pies that you need to make to earn extra points at the end of the game. Players receive points by completing tasks, and also for each jam they make and each pie they bake. The one who has the most points at the end of the game wins.<br/><br/>All cards in the game can be used as either an Ingredient (the image at the bottom of the card) or a Recipe (jam, pies or fruit salad &ndash; the upper part of the card). At the beginning of the game the top eight cards are placed on the table face up, forming the Basket with Ingredients, fruits and berries.<br/><br/>How do we make jam? A player plays a jam Recipe from his hand, then places the necessary Ingredient on top of it, which he takes from the Basket (&quot;Raspberry jam&quot; from the hand + Raspberry from the Basket and so on). Fruit salad and pies are made a similar way, only to make a pie you need to use a completed jam Recipe (by yourself or one you received from trade) instead of taking it from the Basket.<br/><br/>The game is turn-based, and each player's turn has a few phases:<br/><br/><br/>     Draw a card &ndash; take the top card from the deck.<br/>     Trade &ndash; players can trade Recipes they made with other players.<br/>     Play a card &ndash; you can make jam, bake pies, make a fruit salad; you can use one of the special rules; finally you can play a card as an Ingredient and place it in the Basket.<br/>     Discard &ndash; you must discard Ingredients used to make a Recipe on your previous turn. <br/><br/><br/>The game has a few special cards with special features:<br/><br/><br/>     &quot;The Bear&quot; goes to the player with the most baked pies and awards him 10 points &ndash; but eats one of the pies.<br/>     &quot;Karlsman&quot; goes to the player who can offer him the most jam; he grants 7 points but eats the jam.<br/>     &quot;Cone jam&quot; can be made using any Ingredient, and can then be used to make any pie.<br/><br/><br/>The game ends once all the cards are used, including cards in the players' hands. Points are counted to see who the winner is. Different players complete the tasks on their task sheets differently: Some try to make &quot;Winter jam&quot; or bake &quot;Pies for granny&quot;, while others collect &quot;Favorite fruit&quot;.

The Throne may change hands any number of times in the course of play, but whichever side's King is in occupation at game's end (i.e. when one player, on his turn, has no available move) is the winner.

This expansion details rich new mechanics for social encounters, making them every bit as engaging and important as combat. You will also find new careers, enemies, and secret societies.<br/><br/>Verbal sparring<br/>The nobles of the Old World live in a complex feudal system. Although the system imposes a degree of order upon those enmeshed in it, there are many incidents of disorder and conflict, especially between nobles of comparable rank. There is often no set notion as to which noble outranks the other, and the slight differences in rank have prompted bitter conflicts.<br/><br/>The Old World is a violent land of constant war, but some conflicts, even the most bitter, are fought with words. Lure of Power explores the intricacies of heated social encounters, providing guidance and examples for GMs, including optional mechanics that let player characters shame their opponents into submission. Simple insults and name-calling won&rsquo;t win these complicated interchanges, but perhaps your character will show up for an event escorted by the former paramour of a jilted, broken-hearted lover. Best your opponent in a duel of words, and he may live with the humiliation for years.<br/><br/>Nobles have more to do than nurse old hostilities, of course, and Lure of Power offers several new careers focused on noble privileges and responsibilities.<br/><br/>Slaves to desire<br/>Lure of Power explores the secret pleasures and vices that corrupt many of the Old World&rsquo;s populace in Liber Ecstatica, a sourcebook aimed toward GMs. Slaanesh spreads his influence within the Realm of Chaos by fueling and feeding upon the extremes of mortal emotion and experience. The Dark Prince provides a particular allure to nobles, as their positions of power and idle time afford them greater opportunities to explore rare luxuries and sensations.<br/><br/>The minions of Slaanesh give in to their dark passions, and they excel at luring others to join them. The greatest and most terrible of their abilities is that to corrupt and seduce the most loyal and pure. Those marked by Slaanesh are said to be able to gaze directly into the most hidden depths of a mortal&rsquo;s soul and rip out his most secret desires and fears. The Dark Prince&rsquo;s marauders are vain and obsess over their rippling muscles and taut sinew. They adorn themselves with tattoos and aspire toward physical perfection. Beastmen view Slaanesh as the power that grants them virility. Sorcerers of Slaanesh focus on coercion, domination and submission.<br/><br/>Liber Ecstatica includes an adventure that leads characters into a world filled with the temptations of physical and aesthetic pleasures. In the world of the nobles, power can lead to corruption, and heroes may pave a smoother road to success with words than with swords.<br/><br/>"}, "103852": {"image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1057511.jpg", "poll": [], "boardgamedesigner": ["Associazione Alma", "Paola Colleoni", "Caterina Rapetti"], "statistics": [], "yearpublished": "2011", "maxplayers": "5", "boardgameartist": ["Paola Colleoni"], "boardgamepublisher": ["(Self-Published)"], "maxplaytime": "30", "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1057511_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "30", "boardgamecategory": ["Educational"], "description": "A game of life narrating the history of Pontremoli (town in Northern Tuscany) and its territory, from neolitic sculptures through medieval rivalries and ambulant book sellers, up to the twenty-first century, with the town still known as a &quot;city of books&quot;.<br/><br/>Game-play follows standard game of life rules: players roll a die, move up their pawn a corresponding number of spaces on a 54 spaces track, and follow the instructions written on the space where their movement ends.

At the start of the game, each player receives a number of building blocks and differently-shaped platforms. Each player also receives five bonus points and one pawn, which is placed on the track.<br/><br/>The game is played in turns with some elements being similar to Burkhardt's own Kupferkessel Co. At the start of his turn, the player rolls the die and moves his pawn forward on the track as many spaces as the number rolled. By expending bonus points, the player may move his pawn further. Then, the player must place one building block on the board in the column or row corresponding to the space on the track where his pawn is located. If he now has the building blocks needed to support one of his platforms, he may place that platform on top of the building blocks. If he does so, he gains an amount of money (Casa Grande Lire) based on the size of the platform and the level at which it was built.<br/><br/>After a platform has been added, building blocks may be added on top of the platform. If another player builds on top of your platform, you gain a number of bonus points. You also gain bonus points if your pawn ends its move on a corner (in which you don't get to place a building block). If a player accumulates nine or more bonus points, he receives nine Casa Grande Lire, but loses the bonus points.<br/><br/>The game ends at the end of the round in which a player has placed his last building block.

Visit the inhabitants and bring them certain items. You will receive coveted magic stones as a reward! The first player to fill his magic key with the magic stones and return to his starting field wins. But beware! Danger lurks everywhere...<br/><br/>In Das Elektronik Labyrinth, designer Reiner Knizia marries his facility for electronics in board games (e.g., Wer war's? and Die Insel) with Max J. Kobbert's long-running Labyrinth series of games from Ravensburger.<br/><br/>The basic game play is the same as in Labyrinth. The board has a set of tiles fixed solidly onto it; the remaining tiles slide in and out of the rows created by the fixed tiles to make up the labyrinth. One tile stands outside the labyrinth, and on a player's turn, he takes this tile and slides it into a row, moving all the tiles and pushing one out the other side of the board, which becomes the piece for the next player to add to the maze.<br/><br/>After inserting the tile, the player may move his pawn. Each player starts on a corner of the game board and must reach the starting location diagonally opposite. If he manages to do so, he gains a number of magic stones. A player can also acquire magic stones from the inhabitants of the labyrinth. If a player lands on an inhabitant, it tells the players what item it desires. A player who finds the item, with items being scattered throughout the labyrinth, can deliver it to the inhabitant for a reward. What's more, an inhabitant may give a visiting player a treasure chest to be delivered to another inhabitant, also for a reward.<br/><br/>In order to complete his magic key and free the wizard, a player needs fifteen magic stones. The first player that returns to his starting location with a complete key wins.<br/><br/>The game comes with a &quot;book&quot; containing electronics. This book takes care of all the interactions with the inhabitants of the labyrinth. Whenever a player interacts with an inhabitant, he pushes the corresponding buttons from the book, and the book will respond by telling the player his assignment, reward, etc.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": ["English first edition", "French edition", "German first edition", "Ravensburger Italian edition", "Ravensburger Italian edition", "Ravensburger Italian edition"], "average": "6.48182", "name": "Electronic Labyrinth", "playingtime": "60", "boardgamemechanic": ["Modular Board", "Pattern Recognition", "Pick-up and Deliver", "Route/Network Building", "Set Collection"], "age": "8", "usersrated": "88", "boardgamefamily": ["Ravensburger Labyrinth Games"]}, "103884": {"rpgartist": ["Thuy Tran", "Matt Youngmark"], "rpgitemversion": ["ePub version", "Kindle Format - First Edition", "PDF version", "Softcover Version"], "poll": [], "name": "Zombocalypse Now", "rpgdesigner": ["Matt Youngmark"], "rpgproducer": ["(Uncredited)"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2318670.jpg", "usersrated": "1", "average": "8", "rpgissuearticle": ["Zombocalypse Now from Atherton Haight"], "rpg": ["Chooseomatic Books"], "rpgpublisher": ["Atherton Haight"], "statistics": [], "rpgcategory": ["Solitaire Adventure"], "rpggenre": ["Comedy / Satire", "Horror (Supernatural)", "Modern (Pop Culture)"], "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2318670_t.jpg", "description": "Publisher Blurb<br/><br/>Zombocalypse Now is a comedy/horror reimagining of the choose-your-own-ending books you grew up with.

Featuring stunningly detailed and painted miniatures, the X-Wing Miniatures Game recreates exciting Star Wars space combat throughout its several included scenarios. Select your crew, plan your maneuvers, and complete your mission!<br/><br/>Whatever your chosen vessel, the rules of X-Wing facilitate fast and visceral gameplay that puts you in the middle of Star Wars fiercest firefights. Each ship type has its own unique piloting dial, which is used to secretly select a speed and maneuver each turn. After planning maneuvers, each ship's dial is revealed and executed (starting with the lowest skilled pilot). So whether you rush headlong toward your enemy showering his forward deflectors in laser fire, or dance away from him as you attempt to acquire a targeting lock, you'll be in total control throughout all the tense dogfighting action.<br/><br/>Star Wars: X-Wing features (three) unique missions, and each has its own set of victory conditions and special rules; with such a broad selection of missions, only clever and versatile pilots employing a range of tactics will emerge victorious. What's more, no mission will ever play the same way twice, thanks to a range of customization options, varied maneuvers, and possible combat outcomes. Damage, for example, is determined through dice and applied in the form of a shuffled Damage Deck. For some hits your fighter sustains, you'll draw a card that assigns a special handicap. Was your targeting computer damaged, affecting your ability to acquire a lock on the enemy? Perhaps an ill-timed weapon malfunction will limit your offensive capabilities. Or worse yet, your pilot could be injured, compromising his ability to focus on the life-and-death struggle in which he is engaged...<br/><br/>The Star Wars: X-Wing starter set includes everything you need to begin your battles, such as scenarios, cards, and fully assembled and painted ships. What's more, Star Wars: X-Wing's quick-to-learn ruleset establishes the foundation for a system that can be expanded with your favorite ships and characters from the Star Wars universe.<br/><br/>",

The Galactic Empire has consolidated its dominion through the might of the Imperial Navy. In the underworld of the Empire's most populated planets, and in strongholds throughout the Outer Rim, powerful gangsters rule vast criminal organizations. From the shadows, those lost to the grip of the dark side of the Force scheme to bring their evil designs to bear on an already oppressed galaxy.<br/><br/>Yet not all hope is lost. The Rebel Alliance resists the iron grip of the Empire. Smugglers and other fringe elements lend their aid to the Rebellion. And unknown to the Emperor and his dark minions of the Sith, the last remnants of the noble Jedi Order work tirelessly to restore peace and order to the galaxy.<br/><br/>Star Wars: The Card Game is a two-player card game that puts one player in command of the Rebels (light side, with the factions Jedi, Rebel Alliance, and Smugglers And Spies), and one player in command of the Empire (dark side, with the factions Sith, Imperial Navy, and Scum And Villainy). The Balance of the Force expansion allows multi-player games. The game is set within the time-frame of the original Star Wars trilogy.<br/><br/>Each player has a deck of objective cards representing various missions plus a deck of player cards of units (characters, vehicles, droids and creatures), events, enhancements and fates. Each objective is linked to a set of five player cards. Deck construction consists of choosing which objectives are to go into your objective deck, then adding each of those objective's set of five player cards to your player deck. Game play consists of deploying cards to your tableau, attacking your opponent's objectives, defending your own objectives, and committing cards to the Force Struggle.<br/><br/>The Empire wins if the Death Star dial reaches 12, with this dial increasing by one on each dark side turn, effectively putting a timer on the game. It may also be increased by winning the Force struggle, destroying light side objectives, and via card effects. The Rebels win by destroying three dark side objectives before the Empire wins.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": ["Chinese edition", "Dutch first edition", "English first edition", "French first edition", "German edition", "Italian first edition", "Korean first edition", "Polish edition", "Russian edition", "Spanish first edition"], "average": "7.37364", "name": "Star Wars: The Card Game", "playingtime": "60", "boardgamemechanic": ["Hand Management", "Variable Player Powers"], "age": "10", "boardgameexpansion": ["Star Wars: The Card Game \u2013 A Dark Time", "Star Wars: The Card Game \u2013 A Wretched Hive", "Star Wars: The Card Game \u2013 Allies of Necessity", "Star Wars: The Card Game \u2013 Ancient Rivals", "Star Wars: The Card Game \u2013 Assault on Echo Base", "Star Wars: The Card Game \u2013 Attack Run", "Star Wars: The Card Game \u2013 Balance of the Force", "Star Wars: The Card Game \u2013 Between The Shadows", "Star Wars: The Card Game \u2013 Chain of Command", "Star Wars: The Card Game \u2013 Darkness and Light", "Star Wars: The Card Game \u2013 Draw Their Fire", "Star Wars: The Card Game \u2013 Edge of Darkness", "Star Wars: The Card Game \u2013 Escape from Hoth", "Star Wars: The Card Game \u2013 Evasive Maneuvers", "Star Wars: The Card Game \u2013 Galactic Ambitions", "Star Wars: The Card Game \u2013 Heroes and Legends", "Star Wars: The Card Game \u2013 Imperial Entanglements", "Star Wars: The Card Game \u2013 It Binds All Things", "Star Wars: The Card Game \u2013 Join Us or Die", "Star Wars: The Card Game \u2013 Jump to Lightspeed", "Star Wars: The Card Game \u2013 Knowledge and Defense", "Star Wars: The Card Game \u2013 Lure of the Dark Side", "Star Wars: The Card Game \u2013 Meditation and Mastery", "Star Wars: The Card Game \u2013 New Alliances", "Star Wars: The Card Game \u2013 Power of the Force", "Star Wars: The Card Game \u2013 Press the Attack", "Star Wars: The Card Game \u2013 Ready for Takeoff", "Star Wars: The Card Game \u2013 Redemption and Return", "Star Wars: The Card Game \u2013 Scrap Metal", "Star Wars: The Card Game \u2013 So Be It", "Star Wars: The Card Game \u2013 Solo's Command", "Star Wars: The Card Game \u2013 Technological Terror", "Star Wars: The Card Game \u2013 The Battle of Hoth", "Star Wars: The Card Game \u2013 The Desolation of Hoth", "Star Wars: The Card Game \u2013 The Forest Moon", "Star Wars: The Card Game \u2013 The Search for Skywalker"], "usersrated": "4223", "boardgamesubdomain": ["Customizable Games"], "boardgamefamily": ["CCGs (Collectible Card Games)", "Living Card Game", "Star Wars", "Star Wars: The Card Game LCG"], "boardgamepodcastepisode": ["#80 \u2013 Tabletop \u2013 Fantasy Flight Star Wars Games", "+1 Exp, September 2013: Star Wars LCG", "Allt p\u00e5 ett kort #5 \u2013 Star Wars!", "Episode 20 - Back to School", "Gameophiles Podcast Episode 6", "Gameophiles Podcast Episode 8", "Ion Control LCG Episode 1", "Ion Control LCG Episode 2", "Ion Control LCG Episode 3", "Ion Control LCG Episode 4", "Ion Control LCG Episode 5", "Ion Control LCG Episode 6", "Ion Control LCG Episode 7", "Ion Control LCG Episode 8", "Low Player Count - Ep 22 - LCGs, CCGs, ECGs, ETC...", "MN 0055 Star Wars Gaming", "NJAGP - Episode 29 - Grown Men Who Play With Toys", "Se Viene La Lluvia 03x04 - Especial Tematico: Star Wars", "Season 3, Episode 3", "Strange Assembly 074 - Trilogy", "Strange Assembly 087 - The Desolation of Hoth", "TDT - Episode # 303 - Expansion Boxes", "Tema om Star Wars br\u00e6tspil", "The Gaming Gang Extra 22: Gen Con Raw!

Like its predecessor, the game was developed by Hudson Soft and published by Nintendo, and was first announced in January 2001 by Japanese website WatchImpress. It includes new enhancements such as the ability to play as a female character named Mint, a training mode to help new players, a Deck Diagnosis to rate the effectiveness of a player's deck, and a new group of antagonists known as Team Great Rocket. The game features all cards from the original game, along with new cards from the fourth set, Team Rocket, as well as cards originally exclusive to Japanese vending machines and the Pok&eacute;mon Trading Card Game Instructional Video Intro Pack, bringing the total number of cards to 445.<br/><br/>Like the previous title, players must travel across the game world challenging non-player characters to simulated battles using rules adopted from the original tabletop version. All locations from the original are present, along with a new setting known as GR Island which contains its own Battle Masters for players to encounter. By defeating a total of 16 Battle Masters on the old and new islands, players may challenge the game's final boss, King Biruritchi. Though an English release in North America was deemed &quot;likely&quot; by website IGN in 2001, the game has not been made available outside of Japan.<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;Pok\u00e9mon Trading Card Game (video game)&quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "103900": {"rpgartist": ["Commander Bombast", "Eigil Haugen", "Kkohji", "Alexandr Melentiev", "Simon Mutschler", "Shawn Potter", "Mohammed Saud", "Sergey Skachkov", "Geoffroy Thoorens", "Gary Tonge", "Igor Vitkovskiy", "Jirka Zraly"], "statistics": [], "name": "Stellar Reaches (Issue 16 - Summer 2011)", "rpgdesigner": ["Alvin Plummer"], "rpgproducer": ["Alvin Plummer"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1055036.jpg", "usersrated": "1", "average": "8", "rpgissue": ["Stellar Reaches"], "rpgissuearticle": ["BITS Task System", "Ground Forces of Starbreak", "Letter From The Editor", "Starbreak Naval Philosophies", "Starbreak Sector Historical Maps", "Starbreak Sector: Maps", "Starbreak Sector: UWPs", "Starbreak Starships: Classes", "Starbreak Starships: Ownership", "Starbreaker Attitudes, 1500 Imperial"], "rpg": ["GURPS (3rd Edition)", "Traveller (Classic)", "Traveller T20"], "rpgpublisher": ["(Self-Published)"], "rpgissueversion": ["PDF Version"], "poll": [], "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1055036_t.jpg", "description": "Cover Art: Protectorate Scouts explore the mysterious ruins on Righteousness, Sorrow subsector, Starbreak sector.

The player chooses a partner Pok&eacute;mon which is one of ten Pok&eacute;mon (which excludes the last six stated above and the Pok&eacute;mon of the same type). The game is mission-based with many jobs, which can be found on the bulletin board, requested by mail, or initiated through story events, and include rescuing Pok&eacute;mon, delivering items, or escorting clients. If the player successfully completes a job, they receive a reward, and Rescue Points, which increase a team's rank.<br/><br/>These jobs take part in dungeons, of which the layout is randomized.[1] The objective is to either finish a job, or go through all the floors to find the exit. In the dungeon, there are wild Pok&eacute;mon that battle with the player's team. These battles are turn-based, and take place in the dungeon map. Pok&eacute;mon fight using the four moves they know, by using a standard 'A button' attack, or throwing rocks and other items. While going through the dungeon, the player gets hungry, and has to eat food either found in the dungeon, or bought in advance.<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;Pok\u00e9mon Mystery Dungeon: Blue Rescue Team and Red Rescue Team&quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "103906": {"poll": [], "name": "Pok\u00e9mon Mystery Dungeon: Explorers of Time and Explorers of Darkness", "videogamemode": ["Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["eShop Wii U Downloadable edition", "North American Nintendo DS edition", "North American Nintendo DS edition", "North American Nintendo DS edition"], "average": "7.63333", "videogameseries": ["Pok\u00e9mon Mystery Dungeon"], "videogametheme": ["Anime", "Cute Fantasy"], "videogamegenre": ["Roguelike", "RPG"], "usersrated": "6", "videogamedeveloper": ["Chunsoft"], "videogamefranchise": ["Pok\u00e9mon"], "videogameplatform": ["Nintendo DS", "Wii U"], "videogamehonor": ["2008 Japan Game Awards Game of the Year Winner", "2009 D.I.C.E.

The Ortus arena is believed to be the origin of all things, the place where the prime elements were fed with the raw energies to shape the world as we know it. How true this is can be debated, but this is the only place where energy still flows freely in its purest form. Players must harvest these energies and channel them to their warriors as fast and unpredictable Wind warriors, clever positioning of supporting Fire warriors, and devastating blows from lethal Water warriors will all be necessary to claim victory.<br/><br/>Ortus takes place on a hexagonal board, with each player starting with eight warriors (two of each element) on the back row (the &quot;Haven&quot;) in an order of their choice. Ortus is played in rounds, which each consist of four stages:<br/><br/><br/>     Collect energy: Each warrior on an energy well generates energy, which flows into the player's general pool.<br/>     Maneuver warriors: Players can spend 1 energy per hex to move warriors to better locations or attack opposing warriors.<br/>     Return the fallen: When the active player returns his fallen warriors to his Haven, his turn ends.<br/>     Defend: Energy remaining from the maneuver phase can be used to defend warriors against incoming attacks; more specifically, each attack has a certain power, and if the defender is unable or unwilling to pay energy equal to this power, the warrior falls.<br/><br/><br/>When a player occupies five energy wells at the start of his turn or has removed all eight opposing warriors, he wins.<br/><br/>Ortus has a gentle learning curve, starting with the Basic game, which can be taught in around eight minutes. From there, players can introduce the special rules for each of the elemental warriors one at a time to learn the full Advanced game. Each warrior has two unique skills that differentiate it from the others. Being able to move all of your warriors on the board gives an enormous amount of tactical options.
