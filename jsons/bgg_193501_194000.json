Cutting branches and grafting them onto the strong rootstock is one way to ensure longevity. Another benefit is pruning back some branches in order to propagate the growth of others. Water is also very essential because the tree will require the former and latter rainfall. Even though this all has a physical application of how to maintain a healthy tree, the Bible uses this concept to express spiritual lessons.<br/><br/>In John 15:5 Christ says He is the vine and we are the branches... If we take that into account then the people in the Bible that followed God's commandments are &quot;those branches&quot; of The Olive Tree. Through the course of history Egypt, Assyria and Babylon, just to name a few, were all bent on suppressing or destroying God's people by any means possible. Will God's people make it past these tough trials?<br/><br/>There are many Bible games that do trivia. However, this is the first and only that focuses on learning the Bible timeline and where those people are placed in history. Have you ever wondered who Apostle Timothy followed? In what century was Moses? Where is Mordecai in the Bible? How long was Adam's lifespan? All will be answered!<br/><br/>The Olive Tree is a co-operative Bible timeline game that reveals God's &quot;Spiritual Family Tree&quot; and the &quot;People of Faith&quot; written about in Hebrews 11. Points are accumulated in the game by naming the correct Bible character from the Branch card and connecting it to the correct level of Root or Vine cards. The game has 9 Timeline Rounds.

If we take that into account then the Protestant Reformers are also &quot;the branches&quot; of The Olive Tree. Towards the beginning of the 10th century most Christians lost sight of the original church's truths by means of creeping pagan compromises within their midst. In the Dark Ages the Bible and its truth was finally silenced and were instead replaced by traditions. Only a select few were allowed to read from its pages and the common people were told it would be too much for their understanding.<br/><br/>Then stood up reformers in the church that read the Bible and uncovered its truth. These reformers showed that the Bible was meant for one and all, thus the gospel was spread once again. However by doing these acts some of the reformers were exiled, persecuted, or even executed by the hands of the church.<br/><br/>For those that want a little more of a challenge, this version of The Olive Tree is for you! This game focuses on learning timelines of the Biblical characters and Protestant Reformers that brought the church back into the truth of scripture. Have you ever wondered in what century was Job? Where in the Bible does it show what Martin Luther believed? Why was Jan Hus burned at the stake?

Well, have I got some good news for you. This deck is filled to the brim with nothing but Talk About It cards. You have 2 options. Do you shuffle a few of these cards into the original REBUKE game to create a new experience or do you treat this expansion as its own game and solely play and discuss Talk About It cards as a group? Enjoy the game either way you choose.<br/><br/>EXPANSION FOR THE ORIGINAL REBUKE:<br/>The My People expansion can be used in conjunction with the original REBUKE. In order to play a game with this expansion first locate the 12 Talk About It cards in the original REBUKE. Remove these Talk About It cards from the Deck and replace them with 12 Talk About It cards from this expansion. Or you can mix and match these cards together as long as there is 12 in the game.<br/><br/>All expansion cards are identified by an &quot;E:2&quot; at the top right hand corner. This shows the difference between the cards of the expansion and cards of the game. Now you are all set to play REBUKE. Follow the original REBUKE Rules because they are still played the same way.<br/><br/>REBUKE: MY People GAMEPLAY:<br/>When treating REBUKE: My People as a stand-alone game, the amount of maximum players can be 7. Shuffle all the cards together and place them in the middle of the playing field. This will be the Deck. Pick a player, that player will be the Drawer for the rest of the game.<br/><br/>Turns consists of the Drawer drawing the top card of the Deck and reading aloud the card topic. The Drawer will voice his/her opinion of the topic first. Once he/she has finished speaking that player will pass the card to the player on the right. The player on the right will now be able to voice their opinion of the topic and like-wise pass the card down in the same manner. This continues until all players have had a chance to speak. Once all players have spoken, then the Talk About It card is placed into the Discard Pile. The Discard Pile is located next to the Draw stack.

Android: Mainframe is a fast-paced strategy game set in the not-too-distant future of the Android universe!<br/><br/>In the game, you and up to three opponents are elite cybercriminals known as runners who are competing for control of a vulnerable bank's various accounts. At the beginning of the game, you mark your arrival by the placement of your first access point. Then, each turn, you get to take a single action: establish another access point, execute a program, or pass. Your goal is to use the programs at your disposal to secure your access points so that they control as many of Titan's vulnerable accounts as possible.<br/><br/>Most of the generic programs write pathways between Titan's various nodes, allowing you to place a blue partition between the nodes on the board. Whenever your partitions seal off a section of the board containing only your access point or access points, they are &quot;secured&quot; and flipped face down. They are no longer vulnerable to your opponents' programs, and you will score the accounts they control at the end of the game.<br/><br/>Android: Mainframe differs from its predecessor Bauhaus in a number of ways, such as each player having a hand of cards and the game including six runners who each have five distinctive programs.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": {"300577": "English first edition"}, "average": "6.86175", "name": "Android: Mainframe", "playingtime": "30", "boardgamemechanic": {"2043": "Area Enclosure"}, "age": "12", "usersrated": "790", "boardgamesubdomain": {"4666": "Abstract Games"}, "boardgamefamily": {"17106": "Android"}}, "193558": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3126511.jpg", "is_expanded_by": {"204573": {"name": "Brettspiel Adventskalender 2016"}}, "poll": {}, "boardgamedesigner": {"4958": {"name": "Stefan Feld"}}, "statistics": {}, "yearpublished": "2016", "maxplayers": "4", "boardgameartist": {"12484": "Dennis Lohausen"}, "boardgamepublisher": {"267": {"name": "999 Games"}}, "maxplaytime": "100", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3126511_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "70", "boardgamecategory": {"1050": {"name": "Ancient"}}, "boardgamehonor": {"40555": "2016 Golden Geek Best Strategy Board Game Nominee"}, "description": "Description from the publisher:<br/><br/>&quot;For once, Zeus, Greek god of thunder and sky, is in high spirits. Hence, he decides to offer a generous gift to a worthy mortal and invite him, or her, to his realm, to Olympus. To determine a sufficient candidate, Zeus hosts a competition for his entertainment. Twelve legendary tasks are imposed upon the fearless participants: to erect graceful statues, to raise awe-inspiring sanctuaries, to offer capacious offerings, and to slay the most fearsome monsters. The first participant to master all the posed assignments wins the favor of the father of the gods himself.<br/><br/>Indubitably, you will not pass up this golden opportunity, so you clear your ship and rally your crew to follow on the trails of legendary Odysseus through the dangerous waters of the Aegean. But how could you find the righteous path onward? There is but one who can help you. Visit the mysterious oracle of Delphi and let her answers guide your ways.<br/><br/>In Stefan Feld's new game The Oracle of Delphi, the player's ships travel across a large variable game board of hexagonal tiles showing islands and the surrounding waters. Each player aims to reach certain islands to perform the twelve tasks given by Zeus: e.g., to collect offerings of different colors and to deliver them to corresponding temples, or to slay monsters of a specific type (and color), all of which can be discovered on the islands.<br/><br/>In order to execute these color-dependent actions, you are given three colored dice each turn, the so-called &quot;oracle dice&quot;. Rolling the dice (at the start of the turn) is equivalent to consulting the oracle, whereas the results represent her answers. The answers determine which actions you will be able to take, but you will always have three actions per turn. However, a slight divergence from your fate is often possible.<br/><br/>In addition to the oracle, you can request support from the gods and you can acquire favor tokens, companions, and other special abilities that will help you win the race against other competitors.<br/><br/>Differently equipped ships and the variable set-up of the game board will offer new challenging and interesting strategic and tactical decisions with every new game of The Oracle of Delphi that you play.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": {"336375": "Dutch first edition"}, "name": "The Oracle of Delphi", "playingtime": "100", "boardgamemechanic": {"2001": "Action Point Allowance System"}, "age": "12", "boardgameexpansion": {}, "usersrated": "1911", "boardgameaccessory": {"211880": "The Oracle of Delphi: Boats"}, "boardgamesubdomain": {"5497": "Strategy Games"}, "average": "7.44199"}, "193559": {"statistics": {}, "name": "Half Dead", "videogamemode": {"2149": "Single-Player"}, "videogameversion": {"300579": "Windows Downloadable edition"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3278002.jpg", "videogametheme": {"2264": "Science Fiction"}, "usersrated": "2", "average": "5.5", "videogamegenre": {"2152": "Adventure"}, "videogameplatform": {"4977": "Windows"}, "poll": {}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3278002_t.jpg", "description": "User Summary<br/><br/>Half dead is a multiplayer sci-fi game about a violent TV show.

The goal of Microlite78 First Edition Lite is do for First Edition (1e) what Microlite74 did for the Original Edition (0e): to recreate the style and feel of the First Edition of the world&rsquo;s most popular fantasy roleplaying game published back in 1978 without giving up all of the clearer mechanics of modern D20-based versions.<br/><br/>The Microlite78 First Edition Lite rules are based on the Microlite74 Extended rules modified as necessary to fit the 1978 First Edition (1e) of the world&rsquo;s most popular fantasy roleplaying game. Modifications include detailed first edition class descriptions with a standard old school experience system (instead of one based on Microlite20); complete monsters, spell, and treasure descriptions; rules for strongholds, magic reasearch, optional psionics, and more. These rules are not intended to be a clone of the first edition rules, but rather a conversion of them to a rules-lite D20-based system that encourages old school play without strictly old-school rules. Although Microlite78 First Edition Lite is a complete game, it assumes a basic knowledge on the part of the GM of how roleplaying games and the basic D20-system work. At about 160 pages, the rules are lean and do not hold your hand.<br/><br/>Microlite78 First Edition Lite can easily be used with all original first edition adventures and settings (as well as those for BECMI or second edition with a bit of work) as well as with modern OSR adventures and settings.<br/><br/>"}, "193603": {"rpgitemversion": {"300654": "Light vs Dark Version 3.0 (Condensed Type Edition) PDF"}, "statistics": {}, "name": "Microlite74 Light vs Dark", "rpgproducer": {"23703": "Randall Stukey"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2895357.jpg", "usersrated": "0", "average": "0", "rpggenre": {"155": "Fantasy (High Fantasy)"}, "rpg": {"2357": "Microlite74"}, "rpgcategory": {"2130": "Alternate Rules (Variant Core Rules)"}, "poll": {}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2895357_t.jpg", "description": "From publisher blurb:<br/><br/>Microlite74 Light vs Dark (formerly titled Microlite74 Special Version I) is designed for a campaign world with only two deities (a Lord of Light (order) and a Lord of Darkness (chaos) who oppose each other. Magic is both common and rare in this campaign world in that about 25% of the population have the ability to use Minor Magic at will (including all characters and NPCs with a class level), but arcane magic is otherwise limited to long, complex, and costly rituals. Clerics have limited spell-like abilities called prayers. True magic Items are almost non-existent. What true magic items do exist are created by the GM as needed and are always one-of-a-kind. Magic items created by binding spirits to material items are more common.<br/><br/>The proprietary setting these rules were designed for was centered around a large decadent empire which which was starting to fall apart at the seams while its borderlands were breaking away or were being overrun by subhumans and monsters. The central portions of the empire were ignoring the problems. The Church of Light was aware of the problems but its influence on the imperial government had been reduced by scandal after scandal. In the borderlands, however, the Church of Light was often the only institution able to see beyond local issues. The campaign world was early renaissance, at least in the central parts of the empire, but hand guns and long guns were never invented. However, the Microlite74 Light vs Dark rules will work fine for any setting with two powerful opposing deities and weak, but fairly common magic.<br/><br/>"}, "193604": {"rpg": {"33971": "Our Guardian Devils"}, "poll": {}, "name": "Our Guardian Devils", "rpgproducer": {"37600": "Jason A.

Each level has several puzzles that you need to solve in order to advance to the next puzzle. Level design can be quite complex because there are usually multiple floors in one level. Higher floors become transparent to prevent blocking the player&rsquo;s view. Nonetheless, the player always knows where to go because the exit is always to the right and upwards. This is yet another game mechanic taken from classic platformer games.<br/><br/>Puzzles<br/>All puzzles are based on physics interaction with the environment. You have to drive cars, trucks, fork-lifts and tipping lorries.

Driven by the ambition of their king, the Greeks have arrived on the shores of Troy. Some seek power, some seek revenge, while still others seek the great moment in battle that will define their place in history.<br/><br/>Agamemnon is a fast-paced strategy board game in which two players take on the roles of ancient Greek gods during the Trojan War. By tactically deploying warriors to where they're needed across the board, each player may influence the final outcome of the battles famously detailed in Homer's Iliad. Some areas will be decided by the strength of the warriors, others by sheer weight of numbers, and some by the inspiration your heroes provide.<br/><br/>To begin the game, Strings of Fate tiles are placed on their matching spaces on the board, and each player receives one set of fifteen playing tiles. These tiles come in three varieties: Warriors, with a numerical value marking their strength, Leaders, with both a letter rank and a strength value, and Weavers who have no strength or rank, but instead manipulate the Strings of Fate. Each player will shuffle their tiles face down in front of them.<br/><br/>The first player flips over one of their tiles, and places it on any available space. If it&rsquo;s a Weaver, its effect immediately comes into play: the Warp Weaver may swap two adjacent Strings of Fate, whilst the Weft Weaver simply splits all strings it&rsquo;s connected to. After the first turn, each player flips and plays two tiles on their turns.<br/><br/>Once all the tiles have been placed, each string is resolved: each Strength String is won by the player with the highest combined strength contained within it; each Leadership String is won by the player with the single highest ranked tile within the string; and Force Strings are won by the player with the most tiles, including Weavers, in the string. Players claim all the tiles from Strings of Fate they have won, and the player with the most tiles at the end wins.<br/>&emsp;<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": {"300823": "English edition"}, "name": "Agamemnon", "playingtime": "30", "boardgamemechanic": {"2080": "Area Control / Area Influence"}, "average": "7.08608", "usersrated": "159", "boardgamesubdomain": {"4666": "Abstract Games"}, "age": "12"}, "193694": {"poll": {}, "name": "Telepathy", "playingtime": "30", "minplayers": "4", "boardgamemechanic": {"2019": "Partnerships"}, "yearpublished": "1989", "usersrated": "0", "maxplayers": "0", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2903469_t.jpg", "average": "0", "statistics": {}, "boardgamepublisher": {"1070": {"name": "San Serif Print Promotions Ltd (Serif)"}}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2903469.jpg", "boardgameversion": {"300824": "First edition"}, "maxplaytime": "0", "boardgamecategory": {"1002": {"name": "Card Game"}}, "age": "13", "minplaytime": "30", "description": "Each team has a Transmitter and Mind Reader.<br/>Transmitters draw a card with six words.

Send your friends' pawns to the guillotine! First to forty cakes wins!<br/><br/>Let Them Eat Cake is a game of committees, coercion, and cake. Elect your friends to positions of power in the hope that they look on your patronage favorably &mdash; or denounce them as enemies of the revolution. Alliances and betrayal are all fair game as you try to amass as much cake as you can before the revolution collapses.<br/><br/>Each player starts the game with a set of voting cards, three pawns, three medals of honour, and some cake. Each round consists of a series of elections, from the Head of Committee to the Food Inspector. Each vote, after negotiating, bribing, and pleading, is simply a matter of each player secretly choosing a voting card of the player they wish to vote for. Each player&rsquo;s votes are multiplied by the number of pawns they have, and whoever is the Head of Committee will break any ties. Importantly, once you&rsquo;ve used a voting card, you cannot reuse it until you&rsquo;ve played all your cards, demanding shifting allegiances throughout the game.<br/><br/>The first vote of the round determines the Head of Committee, the official tie-breaker. Soon thereafter players determine the Enemy of the Revolution, who must place one of their pawns on the guillotine, immediately and potentially permanently reducing their voting power. Next, players elect a Guillotine Operator, who decides whether or not the pawn on the guillotine is executed or spared. Once settled, a Secretary is elected to divvy out cake and generals to the players, one card per player. But before these cards are taken, the players elect a Food Inspector who may, at the cost of a medal, declare all cake unsafe.<br/><br/>Throughout the game, players will accumulate medals, generals, and cake. Fewest medals make you the Enemy of the Revolution, but the player with the most Generals is immune to such accusations! Any player can spend their Generals to force a re-election or simply choose the winner of a vote. The game ends when one player reaches 40 or more cakes, a player has their last pawn executed, or the deck runs out.

Gameplay is very simple, and is driven by the quality of the officers leading your units, in the true spirit of Victorian derring-do and adventure, where larger than life characters such as the (real) Fred Burnaby and the (fictional) Harry Flashman led their troops to glory and medals, or to a horrible end at the point of a spear tip.<br/><br/>"}, "193698": {"boardgamedesigner": {"7939": {"name": "Mark Latham"}}, "average": "0", "poll": {}, "name": "Chosen Men: Military Skirmish Games in the Napoleonic Wars", "playingtime": "0", "minplayers": "2", "yearpublished": "2016", "usersrated": "0", "boardgamefamily": {"16984": "Osprey Wargames Series"}, "maxplayers": "2", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2900459_t.jpg", "boardgameartist": {"51597": "Mark Stacey"}, "statistics": {}, "boardgamepublisher": {"7360": {"name": "Osprey Publishing"}}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2900459.jpg", "boardgameversion": {"300828": "English edition"}, "maxplaytime": "0", "boardgamecategory": {"1117": {"name": "Book"}}, "age": "12", "minplaytime": "0", "description": "Chosen Men is a set of fast-action skirmish rules detailing the bloody skirmishes between light troops in the Napoleonic Wars. The primary focus of the game is on soldiers and NCOs in light &quot;flank&quot; companies, as they scout ahead of larger forces and take part in man-to-man actions against enemy skirmishers.<br/><br/>Although the game allows for the formation of accurately sized companies of light infantry and cavalry if you wish, these formations are broken down into small groups of up to a dozen men. For the most part, officers are not swashbuckling super-heroes, but staunch commanders who rally and direct their men to achieve the battlefield objectives. Although the games uses an alternating action turn sequence, officers can use their influence to multiple units at the same time in an effort to steal the initiative. With all rolls resolved using standard 6-sided dice, this game combines a classic wargaming feel with modern wargame mechanics.<br/><br/>"}, "193699": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3078354.jpg", "is_expanded_by": {"227526": {"name": "Konflikt '47: Resurgence"}}, "poll": {}, "statistics": {}, "yearpublished": "2016", "maxplayers": "2", "boardgamepublisher": {"7360": {"name": "Osprey Publishing"}}, "boardgameintegration": {"127493": "Bolt Action"}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3078354_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "0", "boardgamecategory": {"1117": {"name": "Book"}}, "description": "Konflikt '47 is set in a world very much like ours--that is, until 1943. With the development of atomic weapons, the world changed. The testing of a prototype nuclear device by the Manhattan Project opened a rift in the fabric of space. When the Fat Boy atomic bomb was dropped on Dresden in March 1944, it created a second rift. German scientists set to work studying it with far more speed than their U.S. counterparts. Both nations began to receive radio signals through the rifts, though often undecipherable. Soon it became apparent that these signals were messages from unknown originators wanting to help each nation's war efforts.<br/><br/>As the messages were pieced together, discoveries were made that allowed each nation to make huge leaps in industrial and scientific research. Despite repeated pleas and demands from their allies, both the United States and Germany were reluctant to share the messages coming through the rifts. Stalin then declared the United States an enemy in May 1944: the Soviet Union would end the war on its own.<br/><br/>It is against this backdrop that players find themselves. Using the incredibly popular Bolt Action rules, this rulebook offers everything required to build a force that incorporates the incredible weapons and technologies made possible by the rift signals, and to engage in tabletop battles for supremacy and survival. Fully compatible with existing Bolt Action material, Konflikt '47 takes the war to a completely new level.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": {"300830": "English first edition"}, "maxplaytime": "0", "name": "Konflikt '47", "playingtime": "0", "boardgamemechanic": {"2001": "Action Point Allowance System"}, "average": "7.29412", "boardgameexpansion": {}, "usersrated": "17", "age": "12"}, "193700": {"boardgamedesigner": {"67113": {"name": "Robey Jenkins"}}, "average": "8.02941", "poll": {}, "name": "Horizon Wars: Science-Fiction Combined-Arms Wargaming", "playingtime": "0", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": {"2001": "Action Point Allowance System"}, "yearpublished": "2016", "usersrated": "17", "maxplayers": "2", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2900090_t.jpg", "boardgameartist": {"60431": "Jessada Sutthi"}, "statistics": {}, "boardgamepublisher": {"7360": {"name": "Osprey Publishing"}}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2900090.jpg", "boardgameversion": {"300831": "English edition"}, "maxplaytime": "0", "boardgamecategory": {"1117": {"name": "Book"}}, "age": "12", "minplaytime": "0", "description": "Beyond today's horizons lie uncountable wars still to be fought by mankind - on battlefields, against foes, and with weapons that can only be imagined.

Series, wargamer and designer Carl Paradis revisits this fascinating campaign with: Absolute War! - The Attack on Russia 1941-44. This two-player wargame recreates the titanic struggle between the invading armies of Nazi Germany versus the Soviet Union in a fresh new way. This new approach is even faster and easier to play - making it perfect for introducing new gamers to the hobby.<br/> The design emphasis has been placed on making the game very player-friendly and manageable in its level of scope, difficulty and time of play. With a very low total counter count and density, this quick playing (while still realistic) simulation presents players with deep strategy meriting contemplation. A system of map areas has been adopted and movement has been streamlined. Combat is handled by the two decks of cards (one German and one Soviet) - meaning no combat tables or dice to roll. These cards are the crux of the game system offering even more variety than regular Combat Result Tables. Like in &ldquo;No Retreat!&rdquo; they are used to generate events and special game abilities (ex: Major Offensives, Partisan Raids, Siege Artillery, Increased Replacements, etc&hellip;) and now also effortlessly resolve all battle outcomes. The set-up for a campaign or a scenario will be lightning fast: in less than 10-15 minutes you can get the game going! This high degree of re-playability means that it will reward players' experience with increased skill.<br/><br/>Absolute War! will put emphasis on strategic planning - not tedious hex maneuvering or factor-counting to attain the &ldquo;perfect&rdquo; attack. Most of the time-consuming calculations will be taken care of effortlessly by the game engine, letting you concentrate instead on exercising your generalship skills against your opponent. Area-movement will provide the proper feel of sweeping maneuvers, exploitation and encirclements across the vast steppes and forests of Russia. The grueling city sieges will be represented by allowing local battles to unfold, with sometimes both foes occupying and battling in the same critical map areas. With a simple &ndash; yet effective - economic model, players will also feel the growing might and sophistication of the Soviet Red Army and the degradation of the once-invincible German Wehrmacht over the epic four years that this merciless campaign was fought on the soil of &ldquo;Mother Russia&rdquo;.<br/><br/>Victory conditions are simple and to the point: you have to capture as many of the ten map objectives to force a campaign decision. While destroying the foe&rsquo;s armies will also help in this endeavor, some event cards will also provide short-term goals to accomplish - gaining players&rsquo; special game advantages if met.<br/><br/>Neither side can afford to show mercy to their hated foe in this life-or-death conflict, you are in command in the largest and most grueling campaign the world has ever seen. War is hell, and this is Absolute War!<br/> Four Quick-Playing Scenarios plus a Campaign Game:<br/><br/><br/>     Barbarossa, 1941 : The initial assault on the Soviet Union. Can the Germans take Leningrad and Moscow before &ldquo;General Winter&rdquo; freezes the German war machine dead in its tracks?<br/>     Fall Blau &amp; Operation Saturn, 1942 : The Offensive towards the Caucasus Oil Fields, and the Nazis disastrous rendezvous with destiny at Stalingrad . Or&hellip;maybe the OKH will decided to strike north again at the Soviet Capital?<br/>     Operation Zitadelle, 1943: Hitler&rsquo;s last chance at getting a &ldquo;victory&rdquo; of sorts in the East after last winter disaster in the south. It&rsquo;s a do-or-die proposition for the Germans, as the Red Army can finally fight on equal terms. Will Kursk be the tombstone of the Panzers?<br/>     Operation Bagration, 1944:  The Soviet summer offensive that finally broke the back of the Wehrmacht, and made the Normandy landings look like a mere scuffle. Will you finally expel the hated foe enemies from their last foothold in Mother Russia?<br/><br/><br/>Absolute War Campaign game: From Operation Barbarossa in 1941 to the aftermath of Bagration in 1944. The whole conflict up to the gates of Germany is played out in dramatic fashion.<br/> Playing time:  Approximately 3 - 4 hours for a full campaign game, 1- 2 hours for the Shorter Scenarios.<br/> Scale: Each unit is one Army/Front: Each area is about 200 kilometers from side to side. Each turn represents two months of real time.&quot;<br/><br/>"}, "193728": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2986408.png", "poll": {}, "boardgamedesigner": {"89035": {"name": "Marc Gouyon-Rety"}}, "statistics": {}, "yearpublished": "0", "maxplayers": "4", "boardgameartist": {"71": "Rodger B.

This crucial period in history saw the end of the Roman Empire in Britain and the seeds of the modern nations of England, Wales, Scotland, Ireland, and Brittany. Most of us know next to nothing about this period, but we know of its legends &ndash; from King Arthur and his knights, through Merlin, Vortigern and Hengest, Badon Hill and the Isle of Avalon, to St. Patrick and Niall of the Nine Hostages&hellip;<br/><br/>&ldquo;For the fire of righteous vengeance, caused by former crimes, blazed from sea to sea, heaped up by the eastern band of impious men; and as it devastated all the neighboring cities and lands, did not cease after it had been kindled, until it burnt nearly the whole surface of the island, and licked the western ocean with its red and savage tongue. [&hellip;]&rdquo;<br/>Gildas (De Excidio Britanniae, Part I.24)<br/><br/>Volume VIII in GMT&rsquo;s COIN Series transports us into the 4th and 5th Centuries A.D. and to the embattled Isle of Britannia.  Pendragon &ndash; The Fall of Roman Britain covers a century of history from the first large-scale raids of Irish, Pict, and Saxon raiders, to the establishment of successor kingdoms, both Celtic and Germanic. This sumptuous volume adapts the celebrated asymmetrical COIN engine to depict the political, military, religious, and economic struggles of Dark Ages Britain.<br/><br/>Shrouded in mists of myth and legend, this story so foundational to many national groups has been subject to many different narratives and interpretations. The traditional Victorian vision of brutal and violent conquest of Roman and Celtic Britain by Anglo-Saxon raiders and invaders now collides with modern historical views ranging from continuity of tribal rivalries to quasi-peaceful cohabitation and acculturation.<br/><br/>Pendragon leverages the tremendous flexibility of the COIN system, from dual events to dissimilar approaches and victory conditions, to capture the complexity of the period and let the players explore alternative narratives. Unlike earlier volumes, Pendragon is not about counterinsurgency per se, but focuses on the asymmetrical clashes between and among Romano-British authorities and Barbarian powers gnashing over the carcass of the Roman Empire, including:<br/><br/>Barbarian Raiders plundering the land and trying to surprise unwary towns and hillforts, then melting into hills or fens.<br/>Expansion or decline of the Saxon Shore naval defense system to counter sea-borne raiders.<br/>Authentic Late-Roman military doctrine&mdash;mighty but hard-to-replace cavalry tracking down raiding parties before they can return their booty home.<br/>Accessible, powerful but fickle Foederati: barbarian warbands in Briton employ.<br/>Nuanced battle system representing troop qualities and tactics.<br/>Fortified strongholds that must be assaulted, besieged, or rebuilt to gain regional political control.<br/>Civil wars, coups, religious shifts, and cultural assimilation.<br/>Population movements over the generations, due to good administration, barbarian ravages, or climatic changes.<br/>Epochal Events ranging from Roman usurpations on the continent to massive reprisals against barbarian homelands.<br/>Evolution of rules and victory conditions throughout the game, as the still vivacious Roman Empire may or may not end with Britain fragmented among competing semi-barbarian proto-kingdoms.<br/>A deck of 83 cards with gorgeous commissioned original art.<br/>Short, medium, and full-length scenarios<br/>Support for solitaire, 2-player, 3-player and 4-player experiences.<br/><br/>&ldquo;They, moved, as far as was possible for human nature, by the tale of such a tragedy, make speed, like the flight of eagles, unexpected in quick movements of cavalry on land and of mariners by sea; before long they plunge their terrible swords in the necks of the enemies; the massacre they inflict is to be compared to the fall of leaves at the fixed time, just like a mountain torrent, swollen by numerous streams after storms, sweeps over its bed in its noisy course; [&hellip;]&rdquo;<br/>Gildas (De Excidio Britanniae, Part I.17)<br/><br/>Each faction in Pendragon brings specific capabilities and challenges:<br/><br/>The Dux represent the original Roman Army in Britannia: with the most powerful units in the game and a network of strong fortresses ringing the island and tied by efficient roads, you must strive to preserve the stability and prosperity of the provinces and punish any interloper daring to challenge the peace. If you can build up your prestige and maintain order, you may be able to keep the island in the Empire, or at least united in a new post-Roman power. You can rely on the civilian militia to assist you, but&mdash;as your peerless cavalry dwindles&mdash;you must resort to the traditional Roman offer to barbarians of land for service in your forces as Foederati. As the decay of institutions conspires with the scheming of feckless civilians and the marauding of restless barbarians, you may find that the dream of Empire is dead. If so, with your once proud Army little more than another group of warlords, you still can strive to carve for yourself the most powerful kingdom alongside your new rivals.<br/><br/>The Civitates represent the Romanized aristocracy ruling the ancient Celtic tribes from lavish villas and prosperous Roman towns, chafing under the distant authority (and taxes) of Rome, mistrusting the uncultured and semi-Barbarian army, and yearning to settle century-old accounts with their neighbors. When the Barbarian storm comes down upon your island, you may find yourself woefully unprepared to cope&mdash;materially or culturally&mdash;and presented with a fundamental choice: strive to protect your lands, wealth, and way of life via the despised Army and untrustworthy Foederati, or sacrifice Roman comforts to face down the Barbarian challenge militarily and culturally through a return to Celtic traditions.<br/><br/>The Saxons represent various Germanic groups including Angles, Jutes, Frisians, and Franks who harried, settled, and eventually took over swaths of Britain. As outsiders, you face a steep challenge just to come ashore against the might of the Roman army and navy. You will chip away at the Saxon Shore system, ravage the provincial economy to weaken the Britons&rsquo; capability to wage war, and see  some of your best warriors serve as Foederati (often against yourself), but recognize  that the more Saxons living on the island&mdash;whoever their paymaster&mdash;the more opportunities for advancing your nation. Eventually, you must secure footholds, perhaps in the marshy fens of the eastern seaboard that so resemble your homelands, in order to wield your considerable military potential and challenge the old masters of these rich lands to create England.<br/><br/>The Scotti, named for the marauding groups of Irish raiders, also represent those Celts native to the island of Britain who differed from the romanized Civitates by remaining true (or reverting back) to the old ways. Often, the boundary between the two groups was porous... The biggest such group eventually formed the northern nation of the Picts, forebears of modern Scotland. As the Scotti, you see the disintegration of Roman Britain as an opportunity not so much to expand as to seize riches and renown to assert yourself at home. Raid ceaselessly, surprise and plunder poorly protected communities, kidnap for ransom, and show your military prowess against your unfortunate neighbors across the Irish Sea and Forth-Clyde isthmus&hellip; Then establish bases strategically along the enemy shores and entreat local hill tribes to reject post-Roman authority. But beware that your very advances will help give rise and limit your ability to grapple new powerhouses on the island!<br/><br/>&quot;Kings were anointed, not in the name of God, but such as surpassed others in cruelty, and shortly afterwards were put to death by the men who anointed them, without any enquiry as to truth, because others more cruel had been elected.

Players compete to be the first to discard all their cards, similar to Uno or Skip-Bo. Play proceeds in turns around a circle. Each player must discard or draw one card on his or her turn. Players can only discard a card if the debate topic marked on it matches the topic of the card on the top of the discard pile.

This deck was released in 2012.<br/><br/>Planechase is a card game and a variant of Magic: The Gathering with an emphasis on multi-player games. The set utilizes new oversized Plane cards, cards that are based on various locations (Planes) within the Magic multiverse, to modify the rules of gameplay.<br/><br/>To play a game of Planechase, each player needs his or her own planar deck, consisting of at least 10 different oversized cards. The players may also use a &quot;shared planar deck,&quot; which requires ten cards per player. Players cannot use more than one plane with any given name. When the game begins, the player going first reveals the top of his or her planar deck (or the shared planar deck), which is the plane the game starts on. Each plane card has a name, a type, one ability that applies at all times (either to all players or to whoever is the turn player at the time), and one &quot;Chaos&quot; ability.<br/><br/>Players also need a six-sided die, called the &quot;planar die.&quot; Each Planechase preconstructed deck comes with a &quot;planar die&quot; that has four blank faces, one &quot;Planeswalk&quot; face with the &quot;Planeswalker&quot; symbol, and one &quot;Chaos&quot; face with its own symbol unique to Planechase. During a player's main phase, that player can roll the planar die, with three possible outcomes. A blank roll of the planar die does nothing. If &quot;Chaos&quot; is rolled, the &quot;Chaos&quot; ability of the current plane card triggers. If the &quot;planeswalk&quot; symbol is rolled, the player &quot;planeswalks away&quot; from the current plane (put it on the bottom of its owner's planar deck) and he or she reveals the top card of his or her planar deck, which becomes the new plane that has been &quot;planeswalked to.&quot; A player can roll the planar die as many times as he or she likes, but successive rolls cost an additional one mana for each time the planar die has been rolled this turn.<br/><br/>Other than the above, the normal rules of the game are followed, and Planechase can be adapted to any multiplayer variant.<br/><br/>Planechase 2012 introduced the &quot;phenomenon&quot; card type. A player may have up to two different phenomenon cards in his or her planar deck, which cannot have the same name. When a player planeswalks to a phenomenon, he or she follows the instructions on the card, then immediately planeswalks away from it.<br/><br/>"}, "193918": {"poll": {}, "name": "UNO: Cinderella", "playingtime": "0", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": {"2040": "Hand Management"}, "yearpublished": "2012", "usersrated": "0", "boardgamefamily": {"5597": "Celebrities: Walt Disney"}, "maxplayers": "10", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3444689_t.jpg", "average": "0", "statistics": {}, "boardgamepublisher": {"225": {"name": "Cardinal"}}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3444689.jpg", "boardgameversion": {"301206": "Tin box version"}, "maxplaytime": "0", "boardgamecategory": {"1002": {"name": "Card Game"}}, "age": "5", "minplaytime": "0", "description": "Cinderella themed version of standard UNO.

In order to prosper, you have to manage with natural resources, rare items, vatus (local currency) and tourists. To earn money or prosperity points, you may also draw on the sand*, carry tourists all over Vanuatu islands, or trade cargo with foreign countries.<br/><br/>On each turn, the archipelago expands and you have to program your actions with five tokens. You put one or more of them on the chosen action spaces, and on your turn, you will only be able to play an action if you have the majority on its space. Thus, sometimes have to wait for other players to remove their tokens by playing their actions. If you are not in majority anywhere, you have to remove all of your tokens from an action and give up hope of playing this action. A good strategy lets you block other players; for example, they won't be able to sell fishes if they haven't caught them first &ndash; order matters! Islands and sea resources are rare, so be quick and take them first!<br/><br/>There is no such thing as a rich Vanuatuan.

It is a free game which is open to the public, though players have the option to pay a fee in order to upgrade to a premium account, granting special in-game benefits, including additional areas to explore, access to vocation promotions, and extra spells.<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;[en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tibia_%28video_game%29 Tibia (video game)]&quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "193952": {"statistics": {}, "name": "Warhammer 40,000: Deathwatch - Tyranid Invasion", "videogamemode": {"2149": "Single-Player"}, "videogameversion": {"301267": "iPhone and iPad edition"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2898299.png", "videogametheme": {"2264": "Science Fiction"}, "videogamefranchise": {"5716": "Warhammer 40,000"}, "usersrated": "2", "average": "9", "videogamegenre": {"2158": "Strategy"}, "videogameplatform": {"6826": "iPad"}, "videogamehonor": {"34530": "2015 Golden Geek Best Mobile/Handheld Video Game Nominee"}, "poll": {}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2898299_t.png", "description": "User Summary:<br/><br/>The Deathwatch are the elite of the elite. Players control a Kill Team of five Space Marines to fend off a Tyranid invasion. In this turn-based strategy game, each marine has a number of action points (similar to the Space Hulk board game or the old 1993 video game, but most familiar to Rodeo's previous iPhone/iPad release, Warhammer Quest). Marines use action points to move, shoot or go on overwatch. Setting up overwatch and lanes of fire is crucial as the player moves the Kill Team to each mission objective, often through narrow, twisting corridors. Marines gain xp which may be spent on abilities, traits, and stats.

Each player has a 3x3 grid of facedown cards in front of them, for which they will try to secretly change as the game progresses in hopes to achieve the lowest score possible.<br/><br/>There are five distinct phases in the game, starting with trick taking, where a high card of the first played suit will win. If a poison bottle is played in the trick, the rules are reversed and the low card wins.<br/><br/>In the next two phases, peeking and swapping, every player is allowed to look at any one card on any players board, followed by the losers of the trick swapping one card from their board with a card from their hand.  A marker is then placed on one card of each players board to protect it from being attacked.<br/><br/>The attacking phase follows, where the winner of the trick then takes a card from an opponents board, and swaps it with one from his hand, leaving the card face up for the rest of the game.  This is repeated for each opponent.<br/><br/>The final phase is the drawing phase, where players draw back up to a five card hand. These phases are repeated until a player cannot draw a card, upon which the game ends immediately. Players then reveal their boards and count up their points, however, if a player manages to get three of the same number card in a row or column, that row is eliminated and now worth 0 points. Similarly, if a player manages to get a row or column of three poison bottles, that row or column becomes worth -30 points. Poison bottles played in the trick taking phase are worth -3 points to that player at the end of the game.<br/><br/>There are elements of hearts, nines, and memory in the game, with a focus on bluffing and heavy player interaction.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "3", "boardgameversion": {"301312": "First edition"}, "age": "9", "name": "Poison Bottles", "playingtime": "40", "boardgamemechanic": {"2040": "Hand Management"}, "average": "6.33333", "usersrated": "6", "boardgamefamily": {"22184": "Admin: Unreleased Games"}}, "193977": {"boardgamedesigner": {"10975": {"name": "Paul Koenig"}}, "average": "6.75", "poll": {}, "name": "Chickamauga: Bloody September, 1863", "playingtime": "240", "minplayers": "1", "boardgamemechanic": {"2026": "Hex-and-Counter"}, "yearpublished": "2016", "usersrated": "4", "maxplayers": "2", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2897341_t.jpg", "boardgameartist": {"68989": "Stephen Oliver"}, "statistics": {}, "boardgamepublisher": {"25322": {"name": "Paul Koenig Games"}}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2897341.jpg", "boardgameversion": {"301314": "First edition"}, "maxplaytime": "240", "boardgamecategory": {"1048": {"name": "American Civil War"}}, "age": "13", "minplaytime": "120", "description": "Chickamauga: Bloody September, 1863 (CBS) is volume four of Paul Koenig&rsquo;s Bloody Civil War Series.

No one knows who pressed the button first, and in the harsh realities of the world that followed, no one cared. What mattered was surviving and, if possible, rebuilding.<br/><br/>Each turn, players will draft and simultaneously play a card from their hand (&quot;pack&quot;) to indicate their action for the turn. This may be moving citizens or airships to explore or expand around the modular board, building structures, researching technology, initiating conflict, producing or gathering resources, and abating radiation. All of these things can earn you points in different ways. If you cannot store resources, they are left on the ground and are available for anyone present to use. Each card has an action and a lesser version of another action, so you're never stuck being entirely unable to do a particular thing, and you can also store cards for future.<br/><br/>Once all actions are complete, hands are passed to the next player and a new card is added to each one.

You're Henry - a young scientist obsessed with an idea of bringing people back to life. Unforunately, the experiment was interrupted and you have only 60 minutes to solve the mystery of your death.<br/><br/>History<br/><br/>Henry Shackelton is the main protagonist of Crudelis. Since the tragic death of Ann - his fiancee - Henry is obsessed with an idea of creating a machine able to bring people from the dead. This is the only way he can regain meaning of his life. Although it's been years since he came to Abarian Creek and many people know him, no one will do anything to help him voluntarily.<br/><br/>The world of Crudelis is torn apart by inside conflicts. The rich caste of businessmen is treating their workers as subhumans. Trust is a weakness, because everybody looks only for their profit. The knowledge expands, throwing people into eugenics. It's not easy to convince others to help you deal with your problems. What inspired us was the historical impact of the 19th century Industrial Revolution, as well as the fantasy classics - such as &quot;The Time Machine&quot; by H.G. Wells or J. Verne's &quot;Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea&quot;.<br/><br/>Even though one session takes maximum of 60 minutes, Crudelis has much more to offer. The plot constantly forces you to pick numerous and not obvious decisions based on residual data, as well as the player's intuition (just like in &quot;The Witcher&quot;). As a result, you can end up experiencing one of the 12 endings... or not seeing any of them, if you won't follow the things of most importance to you. As a matter of fact, there is nothing wrong with sitting in a bar and drinking, or wandering around aimlessly.<br/><br/>Features<br/><br/>Precisely 60 minutes of gameplay<br/>Non-linear plot with 12 main endings<br/>Fight your enemies with the power of your intellect, not physical force<br/>Emotional soundtrack created with a piano, violins and cellos<br/>Steampunk atmosphere<br/><br/>Source: The Developer Website.<br/><br/>"}, "193995": {"statistics": {}, "name": "Six Sides of the World", "videogamemode": {"2149": "Single-Player"}, "videogameversion": {"301339": "Windows download edition"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3074147.jpg", "videogametheme": {"2264": "Science Fiction"}, "usersrated": "1", "average": "6", "videogamegenre": {"2165": "Puzzle"}, "videogameplatform": {"4977": "Windows"}, "poll": {}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3074147_t.jpg", "description": "Up?

Crashlanded on Woanope, you must fight, tame, craft, quest, bossfight, and adventure your way to domination of all the things so that you and JuiceBox, your trusty sidekick/supervisor/robotic cargo palette, can send a message to the Bureau of Shipping and get those packages delivered!<br/><br/>Story:<br/><br/>Never again suffer from such existential crises as &quot;Who am I?&quot; or &quot;What am I doing here?&quot; Crashlands is an adventure-crafting RPG driven by an epic story arc. From the moment gameplay begins you'll be thrust PELVIS-FIRST into an insane tale complete with a cast of personality-bloated characters. And what good would those characters be if they could do things for themselves? The Crashlands cast is totally helpless, thus providing you with endless questing opportunities!<br/><br/>Craft:<br/><br/>Make tools and stations to break down the resources of the planet, discover new recipes in the process, and then BUILD ALL THE THINGS as you explore the world. Craftables get ever more elaborate and ridiculous, and include HARVEST BOMBS and LASER LEASHES!<br/><br/>And you know what crafting means: INVENTORY MANAGEMENT! OH YEAH! Easily everyone's favorite part of crafting games: spending countless hours organizing countless chests each filled with countless and mostly-useless items. WHAT FUN! If you were looking for yet another inventory management game... TOO BAD FOR YOU. There is NO inventory management in Crashlands. Inventory is handled contextually, you&rsquo;ll have the things you want when you want them.<br/><br/>Fight:<br/><br/>Sure, you can create armor and weaponry. DUH. Is there a crafting game that DOESN'T have that? But you can also ENHANCE your bad-assery with a host of gadgets that shoot fire, pull lightning from the aether, poison the crap out of everything, make you fly, and even MODIFY THE VERY FLOW OF SPACETIME.<br/><br/>How fast can you click your mouse/tap your finger to DEFEAT YOUR ENEMIES? Turns out it doesn't matter. It's about skill, not speed. Every creature in Crashlands has a unique attack combo you'll need to learn so that you can defeat it in battle. Do the ol&rsquo; Crashlands DANCE OF DEATH to win battles and get those hard-won creature-parts for your crafting.<br/><br/>Tame:<br/><br/>Not only can you harvest crafting components from creatures, you can also find creature eggs. Take that egg back to your base, give it some time to incubate, and hatch your very own baby death machine. Use your new pet as arm candy, a sidekick in battle, or even as a crafting station!<br/><br/>Explore:<br/><br/>Crashlands consists of three infinitely(ish)-large, procedurally-generated biomes: the Savannah, Bawg, and Tundra. Each has its own cast of creatures, resources, and sentient beings for you to dominate. Okay, we lied about it being infinite. But seriously, Crashlands is really, really big. It would take decades to fully explore.<br/><br/>Build:<br/><br/>You&rsquo;ll obviously want an epic base to hold your massive collection of tamed beasts, crafting stations, and decorative pillows. AW YEAH, BASEBUILDING, where you slowly plod around, repeatedly open-and-close and dig through your enormous inventory, and ever-so-painstakingly assemble your masterpiece. OH WAIT. Base-building in Crashlands doesn&rsquo;t suck. It's more like finger painting. Just pop open Build Mode, enjoy the soothing muzak, and INSTANTLY build your living quarters!<br/><br/>Features:<br/><br/>So, Crashlands is a crafting game with no inventory, a delightful build mode, an epic story, tameable pets, and a glorious combat system. IS THAT NOT ENOUGH FOR YOU!? Then cram some other features down your pipe hole!<br/>Make your own campaigns! We're building a BscotchID-powered modding tool that lets you create your own stories, use mutators to change the core mechanics of the game, and generally take what we've made and do horrible, wonderful things to it. The Creator already works, but will need some more testing before it goes public; we'll make it part of the first post-launch content patch.<br/>Platform agnosticism! Crashlands is just as fun on desktop as on mobile, and with the power of BscotchID you can move your saves between all your devices.<br/><br/>Source: The Developer Website.<br/><br/>"}}
