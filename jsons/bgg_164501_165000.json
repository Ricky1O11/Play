The object of the game is simple: defeat the other players (human or computer) and conquer the world!<br/><br/>You begin the game with 56 Armies (actually divisions) in normal mode or 30 Armies in expert mode, all placed in a randomly selected country.  Your strategy will likely be heavily influenced by this initial positioning.  You can only attack countries that border a country that you already own.  Also, attacking one continent from another can only be done from certain countries.  For example, an attack launched at Asia from Europe can only be accomplished through the Ukraine - an attack launched at Africa can only be accomplished through Spain.<br/><br/>Also at the beginning of the game, each player is assigned an IDEOLOGY, or set of beliefs, for which he will fight for the duration of the game.  A randomly selected number of countries around the world are also assigned that player's ideology.  These ideologically &quot;friendly&quot; countries are easier to conquer than those who are friendly to another player.  They also require only ONE army of occupation.<br/><br/>The winner of individual attacks is determined randomly by electronically throwing dice (though you don't see this).  If you get the highest result, you win.  If these &quot;dice&quot; come up doubles and the country you are attacking shares your ideology, then you win the battle.  If, however, that country shares someone else's ideology you lose the tie.<br/><br/><br/>User Summary<br/><br/>The game was released as shareware with the full game available via mail order.

Overhead a storm rages, scattering the long pillows of mist that haunt the land like ghost ships. Against this backdrop a girl is silhouetted. She is running, clutching her shawl to keep the rain out of her hair. A flash of lighting illuminates her face. She is beautiful, but she`s crying. Raindrops are mixing with the tears streaming over her cheeks. She starts to scream, but her words go lost in the wind. She trips on a root, falls to her knees. In a moment of rage and despair she pulls the small golden wedding band from her finger and tosses it off the edge of the cliff. The ring flashes and disappears into the abyss.

Players have to build and treat patients at the same time, since the hospital is under constant expansion. There are many different kinds of patients and plastic blocks necessary to treat them. Designing the blocks is difficult because each player is responsible for one aspect of it: architect, engineer, contractor, nurse, facility manager or director. A poor design allows for earning more money but contributes to the hospital bankruptcy, in which case everybody loses the game. The gist of the game is to find a balance between the need to join forces and the greed for money.<br/><br/>The game design is based on a research conducted with three healthcare construction projects in the Netherlands commissioned by Pioneering. The research found that hospital design is often over schedule due to the conflicts of interests between the multiple parties involved. The game reproduces some of these conflicts, such as the engineer wanting to build more pipes than needed whiles the architect wanting to build a high rise building. If the conflict is not resolved between the players, patient satisfaction drops, together with the hospital income. Playing the game is an opportunity to learn the importance and the difficulties of designing for healthcare performance while having fun with the artificial conflict enactment.<br/><br/>"}, "164554": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2218084.jpg", "poll": [], "boardgamedesigner": ["C\u00e9drick Chaboussit"], "statistics": [], "yearpublished": "2014", "maxplayers": "5", "boardgameartist": ["Vincent Dutrait"], "boardgamepublisher": ["Ludonaute"], "maxplaytime": "120", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2218084_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "120", "boardgamecategory": ["American West", "Expansion for Base-game", "Exploration", "Racing"], "description": "When playing Lewis &amp; Clark: C&eacute;drick Chaboussit, a promotional card for Lewis &amp; Clark that features the game's designer, you can change any space in front of your Scout into a Mountain space if it is a River space, or into a River space if it is a Mountain.

The core mechanisms have been designed to lightly simulate the life of an actual tree, complete with seasons, flowering, and even bugs! Players are given the ability to grow the board, or tree, in any way they choose &ndash; resulting in a unique and interesting play experience every time. The game's length is completely adjustable and can be set up to last anywhere between 20-60 minutes.<br/><br/>Each player is represented by a flower color. The goal of the game is to have the most point-worthy flowers of your chosen color before the seasons &mdash; represented by stacks of leaves &mdash; run out. To do this, you perform one of three simple actions: place a bud which will blossom into a complete flower the next turn, place a leaf to help guide the tree's growth, or use a beetle to attack or protect flowers. Since flowers can connect only to leaves, and leaves can connect together to form chains, points are determined by how many leaves each flower is from the nearest branch. The game also features several unique, seasonal events that can be very beneficial or harmful to the tree's growth including locusts swarm, bee pollination, and wood rot!<br/><br/>Grow: The Organic Building Game was created by Tap Pribbenow, Chris Hassebrook and Kyle Bromley on the idea of blending traditional sculpture with tabletop gaming, while providing a fun way of incorporating plant ecology.<br/><br/>"}, "164559": {"rpgdesigner": ["J.

The victor will be able to change their fate and bring balance to the universe, whilst the losers will be forced to live out their deaths just as history intended.<br/>Unlike most fighting games, or video games in general, there are no characters in this game that are &quot;bad&quot; or &quot;evil&quot;.

Despite the ability to kill opponents in this game, this is not relevant to the story.

Half of the ship's crew is loyal to the captain, but the other half is plotting to kill the captain and take control of the ship. Who will come out of this struggle victoriously?<br/><br/>At the start of the game each player will receive a card. On this card is a unique role and a team indication (either red or blue). Many of the roles have some sort of special power. Players do not show their role card to others. Only one player will reveal his role immediately: this is the player which has the captain role (and who is on the blue team).<br/> The blue team wins if they succeed in killing all of the players in the red team. The red team wins if they succeed in killing the captain. However, as long as the blue player with the bodyguard role is alive, the captain cannot be killed by red players.<br/><br/>The game plays in night and day phases, just like in Werewolf. In the first night, the captain and bodyguard will get to know each other. Also, the players on the red team will get to know each other, but only partially: one player on the red team is the team leader. This player will open his eyes (&quot;wake up&quot;) and will make eye contact with other red players one-by-one. This means that the red team leader knows who all of the red players are, but all the other red players will only know the red team leader but none of the other team mates.<br/><br/>In the game, players are eliminated at night by roles that become active then (usually red players). Players are also eliminated by day, as at the end of each day usually one player will be nominated to &quot;walk the plank&quot; (and will thus be eliminated). The captain can never be nominated to walk the plank. There are various player roles which can perform special night and day actions. These actions include finding out more about other players, kill them, or protect them.<br/><br/>What sets this game apart from Werewolf is that most of the night actions require the player performing them to actually touch the player to which it is directed. This not only makes it harder to kill players further away from you, it also increases chances that some kind of noise or movement will be felt by the other players (which have their eyes closed during the nights). This in turn gives players during the day 'evidence' to accuse other players of being on the red team, and thus a good candidate to 'walk the plank'!<br/><br/>Intrigo shares game mechanisms with Werewolf (e.g., two teams that battle for victory, day/night phases, hidden roles with special powers) and BANG! (hidden roles and only one role is known to all players).<br/><br/>The game is language-dependent: the texts on the cards are in the Dutch language, and currently there is only a Dutch rule set available.<br/><br/>"}, "164589": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2358477.jpg", "poll": [], "boardgamedesigner": ["Jack Darwid"], "statistics": [], "yearpublished": "2014", "maxplayers": "5", "boardgameartist": ["Nick Hayes"], "boardgamepublisher": ["Broadway Toys LTD", "Heidelberger Spieleverlag", "Indie Boards & Cards"], "maxplaytime": "15", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2358477_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "15", "boardgamecategory": ["Action / Dexterity", "Dice", "Real-time"], "boardgamehonor": ["2014 Golden Geek Best Children's Board Game Nominee"], "description": "Roar-a-Saurus is a beautifully illustrated, family friendly, multi-player dino battle with &quot;easy&quot; and &quot;challenge&quot; modes.<br/><br/>In &quot;easy&quot;, players roll their battle dice as quickly as they can to attack their neighbors, heal themselves, or blow up all the other players.

Afterwards they must feed their monkeys using the bananas they have stored. If a monkey can't be fed, he/she is discarded. And lastly, the player may discard any cards out of their hand in the hopes of drawing better ones or more bananas next turn.<br/><br/>The game is over when some plays the action card &quot;No Coco, No!!&quot;.  If successful, this ends the Flinging Poo phase and triggers the To the Trees phase. Everyone must now draw for their end fate. Do they escape?  Must they sacrifice some of their monkeys to do so?

There are a number of symbols in a grid that you must match. But the goal is not to indiscriminately match as many as you can to clear the board.

As you collect resources you will build a home and then expand the home with other outbuildings such as metal working. But the game does not always take place during the day. As you play the sun will move overhead then set and that is when the game becomes more strategic. The symbols shift. Matching three gravestones for example and a zombie comes out to fight your character. Fighting barehanded is not the best idea, so match three swords to get a weapon and three shields to get a shield. The match three takes on more strategy at night since you want to have shields and swords (both of which are consumed during battle) and you want to avoid chain reactions which can fill the screen with enemies. There are also treasure chests which can get you things like red and blue potions. Red potions refill health and blue potions damage all enemies on the screen.

Players will need to collect key ingredients, launch a product line of &quot;liquid gold&quot; craft beer, and strategically compete for regional control across the nation.<br/><br/>A game turn consists of three phases: Ingredient Auction, Launching Beers, and Resolving any Brewfests. During the Auction Phase, players compete for the ingredient cards needed to launch their beer via a turn-based bidding system. Any bids entered are then turned into craft beer &quot;market demand&quot; that is dispersed at the discretion of the players making each play through unique and delivering many interesting decisions. Each beer card has an ingredient recipe that must be satisfied before the beer can be brewed and one of six different beer styles that tailor better to certain cities which will be key when competing for regional control. When a player brews a beer, they must choose to control an open city location or challenge an controlled city to a brewfest where the winner of the brewfest will control the city. If any player controls the most cities in a region at the end of the game, then they control the region. The game ends when the first player brews three beers, and points are then totaled counting beer quality and reputation on cities and any regions you control.<br/><br/>Brewin' USA aims to deliver a quick strategic euro experience paired with a very approachable theme and thrives on its player interaction. The game play revolves around Beer Coaster tiles delivering new twists on fun mechanisms and components including 105 Bottle caps to be used for both money and victory points. The player interaction comes from the Brewfest event in the game, which ramps us as more players grow their craft beer product lines and are chomping to establish their control in the regions.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": ["First edition", "Print & Play edition"], "average": "7.10444", "name": "Brewin' USA", "playingtime": "60", "boardgamemechanic": ["Area Control / Area Influence", "Auction/Bidding", "Hand Management", "Modular Board", "Set Collection"], "age": "13", "usersrated": "99", "boardgamefamily": ["Beer", "Country: USA", "Crowdfunding: Kickstarter"], "boardgamepodcastepisode": ["Brewin' USA and Adam Rehberg", "Episode 9: Game Design"]}, "164629": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3215410.jpg", "poll": [], "boardgamedesigner": ["Derak Morrell"], "statistics": [], "yearpublished": "2017", "maxplayers": "3", "boardgameartist": ["Derak Morrell"], "boardgamepublisher": ["Never Peak Games"], "maxplaytime": "30", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3215410_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "15", "boardgamecategory": ["Fighting", "Science Fiction"], "description": "Starcade is a micro card/dice game that hints to favorite video games like Galaga and FTL.<br/><br/>You are the captain of a starfighter.

The game's full name is &quot;Heiji No Ran: Heiji Gannen (1160) (\u5e73\u6cbb\u306e\u4e71\uff1a\u5e73\u6cbb\u5143\u5e74 (1160), Heiji Disturbance: First Year Of Heiji 1160)&quot;. Stemming from resentments brought on by the results of the earlier Hogen no Ran in 1156, the Minamoto along with their Fujiwara allies attacked the Taira and attempted to seize control of the government.<br/><br/>When Taira no Kiyomori left the capital on a pilgrimage, Minamoto no Yoshitomo (Kiyomori's ally in the 1156 conflict) and Fujiwara no Nobuyori took advantage of his absence to kidnap both the Tenno (Emperor) Nijo and the retired Tenno (or Ho, retired Emperor) Go-Shirakawa. They imprisoned the two, burned their palaces, forced them to appoint Nobuyori as Chancellor, and executed Taira ally and Go-Shirakawa confidant Fujiwara no Michinori. However, Kiyomori was informed of their treachery and quickly returned to Heiankyo. His rapid return surprised the Minamoto and left them unsure as to how to proceed. The Minamoto were further confused when Kiyomori made a false offer of surrender to Nobuyori. The Minamoto ended up taking no action against a still gathering and vulnerable Taira force, and Kiyomori also managed to engineer a rescue of both Go-Shirakawa and Nijo.<br/><br/>A strengthened Taira force made the first move, attacking the Minamoto in the Imperial Palace. Fujiwara no Nobuyori ran off but the Minamoto gave battle. Luring the Minamoto out with a feigned retreat, the Taira then occupied the palace, leaving the Minamoto with no avenue of retreat. Instead of trying to reclaim the palace, the Minamoto attacked the Taira's stronghold of Rokuhara in southeast Heiankyo. While Rokuhara would have been an easy target earlier, it had now been reinforced and proved too much for the Minamoto. Their forces eventually broke and scattered. Their leader Yoshitomo was later betrayed by a vassal and killed. While the fighting was of a relatively small scale, it had far reaching effects. With all opposition effectively eliminated, the Taira became the most powerful family in Japan and the first warrior house to exert a large measure of influence and control on the Imperial Court. However, they failed to kill off all the Minamoto heirs, something that was to come back to haunt them in 1180 when Kiyomori managed to have his grandson installed as Tenno...a move that provoked a chain of events that led to the Genpei War.<br/><br/>The game shares its rules system with its predecessor, &quot;Hogen no Ran&quot;. Both games put an emphasis on the favored samurai tactics of the time-night attacks, torching the strongholds of your opponents, and misdirection. The map for Heiji no Ran expands upon the one for Hogen no Ran, including the southern portion of Heiankyo as well as the northern. This allows the fighting to take place all over the city as it did historically, particularly near the Taira's headquarters in Rokuhara. The game runs for 11 turns, taking the action from the 26th day of the 12th month (the day the actual fighting began) in the first year of Heiji to the 29th day (February 5-8, 1160, two turns per day with a night turn). Forces of the various factions are individual leaders with associated clansmen, rated for both troop strength and leader ability. Victory is determined by unit losses, possession of the Tenno/Ho, and occupation of certain locations. As with its sister game it does an excellent job of simulating the battle (in this case as recorded in the Heiji Monogatari (a gunkimono-'war tale'-written around the year 1200). Heiji no Ran plays well with a low number of counters, short completion time, and a well thought out game system with sufficient chrome. It's nicely balanced and an early, well thought out Minamoto strike will often bring victory.<br/><br/>"}, "164643": {"poll": [], "name": "Croixleur Sigma", "videogamemode": ["Cooperative", "Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["Windows edition"], "average": "0", "videogameseries": ["Croixleur"], "videogametheme": ["Fantasy"], "usersrated": "0", "videogamedeveloper": ["Souvenir Circ."], "videogamegenre": ["Action RPG"], "videogameplatform": ["Windows"], "statistics": [], "videogamepublisher": ["(Web published)", "Nyu Media"], "description": "Croixleur Sigma is a frenetic hack-&amp;-slash arcade action game from indie developer Souvenir Circ. which expands greatly upon the original game Croixleur and includes 2 playable characters, 5 game modes, 20 unique weapons, 42 in-game achievements, full Japanese voice-over, and 2 player co-op.<br/><br/>Source: The Game Website.<br/><br/>"}, "164644": {"poll": [], "name": "Croixleur", "videogamemode": ["Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["Windows edition"], "average": "0", "videogameseries": ["Croixleur"], "videogametheme": ["Fantasy"], "usersrated": "0", "videogamedeveloper": ["(Web published)", "Nyu Media"], "videogamegenre": ["Action RPG"], "videogameplatform": ["Windows"], "statistics": [], "videogamepublisher": ["Souvenir Circ."], "description": "Croixleur is a high-speed, hack-and-slash arcade action game by the talented Japanese indie developer souvenir circ.

Mainly, it is found that spirits could be contained in now-defunct vacuum tubes, which could in turn be used to power various robots and androids. Human beings could transfer their consciousness into androids, and man-made androids could develop human intelligence. The world has embraced this discovery, doing away with any national, religious or ethnic segregation. Instead, people are identified by their intelligence.<br/><br/>The game utilizes 4 different types of cards. 1, The Android Cards are your main cards which are built up and strengthened by the other cards. 2, The Resource Cards strengthen the androids. 3, The Unique Resrouce Cards are one time use cards capable of changing the properties of gameplay. And, 4, Assist Cards are one time use robots that have the ability to shift the flow of battle! Using these cards, your goal is either to destroy all your opponent's androids, or completely deplete their main card deck.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": ["English/Japanese first edition"], "age": "12", "name": "Shinkukan", "playingtime": "30", "boardgamemechanic": ["Action Point Allowance System", "Deck / Pool Building", "Hand Management"], "average": "6.5", "usersrated": "4", "boardgamefamily": ["Admin: Unreleased Games", "CCGs (Collectible Card Games)", "Crowdfunding: Kickstarter"]}, "164717": {"rpgartist": ["William W.

Either way, stations are almost universally present in any system able to build them.<br/><br/>The core of this book is focused on the design and construction of space stations. New power-plants and grav drives provide the much less intensive needs of a space station, while new hull forms allow for cheaper structures to be built without the anti-gravity plating normally mounted within every ship. Facilities enable space stations to take part in local, inter-planetary and interstellar production and trade, to become population centres, install shopping districts and construct their own starships for sale or personal use.<br/><br/>Further chapters give more detail to station facilities and how they function, as well as offering new docking options for larger spacecraft and even capital ships. Stations can be the home ports of entire fleets, and without sufficient docking and recreation space, a fleet will soon fall apart.<br/><br/>This book covers a wide variety of types of station, and also the running of a station, involving building, staffing and setting up the imports that will be its life blood.

The full name is Mimikawa No Tatakai: Otomo (Tawara) X Shimazu (Takajogawa No Tatakai) 1578.11.12 (\u8033\u5ddd\u306e\u6226\u3044: \u5927\u53cb (\u7530\u539f) X \u5cf6\u6d25 (\u9ad8\u57ce\u5ddd\u306e\u6226\u3044) 1578.11.12, Battle of Mimikawa: Otomo (Tawara) Vs. Shimazu (Battle Of Takajogawa) 1578/11/12).<br/><br/>Historically, the battle took place in Hyuga province (in the eastern part of Kyushu, Japan's southernmost major island). The Shimazu's increasingly expansionist ways were making the daimyo (feudal lords) in the north of Kyushu uneasy. Otomo Sorin of Bungo province in northeast Kyushu put together a\u3000sizable army and sent it south to deal with the Shimazu. The Shimazu in turn dispatched reinforcements north to their outpost at Taka castle. Shimazu Iehisa, Yoshihiro, and Yoshihisa consolidated their forces (along with some troops from their allies in the Ijuuin) at Taka, numbering about 50,000. The Otomo forces dispatched to meet them were made up of about 30,000 troops mainly from the Tawara, Takita, Saeki, and Kuwano families. They were commanded by Otomo Sorin's son-in-law, Tawara Chikataka. On the 12th day of the 11th month of the sixth year of Tensho (December 10, 1578) Tawara made an unwise frontal assault on the castle. After some bitter fighting featuring some of the earliest usage of large numbers of arquebus in Japan, the Otomo forces broke. The Shimazu pursued and many of the Otomo were drowned in the rapid waters of the Mimikawa river to the north. The Otomo lost about twice as many men as the Shimazu, probably about 4,000 or so. The Shimazu continued to push the Otomo back in the ensuing months, eventually forcing the Otomo to request aid from Toyotomi Hideyoshi, giving the warlord and his massive army a handy excuse to add Kyushu to his list of conquests.<br/><br/>The battle is played out in eight turns. Victory is determined by both enemy casualties and possession of Taka Castle. Special rules account for the Otomo cannon (a rare instance during the Sengoku of cannon being used in the field). Counters are rated for morale, combat strength (melee), and marksmanship (in this case, the arquebus). While the Otomo have the numerical advantage in overall combat strength and counters and a couple of cannon, the Shimazu have better morale and more leaders, making things more or less even.

For that, you can turn to a mythic heritage. This new aspect of mythic characters allows for further customization of your mythic character.

Most of those with a mutant mythic heritage were not born with it, but were instead altered by exposure to strange energies, which either infused them with mythic power, or unlocked the potential mythic power that was already present within them.

Make them rain from the sky and erupt from the underworld. We will rekindle these mortals' faith - through FEAR!&quot;<br/><br/>Monstrous is a game of gods and monsters, fear and faith, dexterous skills and tactical combos.<br/><br/>Players are Greek gods throwing mythical monster cards from their hand onto a shared tableau of ancient Greek locations to gain as much 'Faith' as possible. But a strong guiding hand is not enough - cunning use of tactical monster and location powers is the key to gaining the most faith of all the gods, and the favor of Zeus.<br/><br/>During setup, a number of large location cards equal to the number of gods are arranged on the table - these are selected from 12 ancient Greek cities where the insolent humans cower. Locations have special powers and provide Faith when hit by Monsters. Depending on the number of gods playing, each god has a randomly constructed deck of between 7 and 10 out of 12 mythical monster cards, each with their own special power. Each god shuffles and readies these decks, then draws 3 of their monster cards ready to throw at locations and monsters already on the table.<br/><br/>On their turn, a god chooses a single monster from their hand, and throws it (without their hand crossing the table edge) attempting to hit:<br/>1. a location - to use its special power, and any thrown monster power that affect locations, and gain its Faith.<br/>2. other monster cards on the table - to use the special power of their thrown monster on the other gods&rsquo; monsters. <br/>3. ideally both at the same time!<br/><br/>Look for the best cards to throw and the best targets to throw at. But beware: monsters may do unpredictable and dangerous things. Some monsters even act like traps on the table, taking effect as soon as they are hit. If Olympus is in play, powerful legendary monsters can be gained for gods to throw too.<br/><br/>Once a god has finished their turn, they draw a new monster and play proceeds to the next god. This proceeds until one god runs out of monster cards completely. Each other god then takes 1 final turn before the god with the highest Faith is declared the winner.<br/><br/>Monstrous blends stunning art of mythic Greece with quick card throwing, fist pumping action and the tactical combos that gods and gamers love.

It's a doujinshi (self-published) game similar in tone to the early SPI folio games-low numbers of counters, compact map, and an easy-to-learn game system used for all the entries in the series. The full name is &quot;Hetsugigawa No Tatakai: Toyotomi (Sengoku) X Shimazu-1587.1.20 (\u6238\u6b21\u5ddd\u306e\u6226\u3044: \u8c4a\u81e3\u3000(\u4ed9\u77f3) X \u5cf6\u6d25\u30001587.1.20, Battle Of Hetsugigawa: Toyotomi (Sengoku) Vs. Shimazu-1587/1/20)&quot;. In this case, the 'Sengoku' in parenthesis doesn't mean 'Warring States' (pronounced the same, different kanji) but rather is the name of the Toyotomi commander who provoked the battle with a foolhardy assault.<br/><br/>After responding to a request for aid against the Shimazu by the Otomo, Toyotomi Hideyoshi prepared a huge army to take the island of Kyushu. His vanguard consisted of forces from the Sengoku and Chosokabe (around 20,000 in all)-they entered Bungo province in NE Kyushu and were instructed to stay on the defensive until the Toyotomi main body arrived. Instead, samurai being samurai and not inclined to listen to anyone, Sengoku Hisahide decided to attempt the relief of nearby Toshimitsu Castle (then being besieged by the Shimazu). The Chosokabe protested but eventually joined the assault, figuring that if Sengoku was determined to go through with the assault it would be better to join in than to sit by doing nothing. However, the Shimazu were aware of their advance and increased their efforts to take the castle, laying claim to it before the Toyotomi forces arrived. Undeterred, the Toyotomi forces (also with elements of the Otomo and Sogou, about 7,000 in all) gathered for battle on the 12th day of the 12th month of the 14th year of Tenshou (January 20, 1587). The Shimazu (with a large number of allies from the Ijuuin, the force adding up to about 15,000) provoked an attack with a feigned retreat (a favorite Shimazu tactic), luring the Toyotomi into an ambush and routing their forces. The Toyotomi withdrew from Bungo and this was to be the high point of the Shimazu-things would be far different when the Toyotomi main force arrived.<br/><br/>The battle is played out in eight turns. Victory is determined by both enemy casualties and possession of the two castles on the field. Counters are rated for morale, combat strength (melee), and marksmanship (in this case, the arquebus). The Toyotomi forces face a tough fight as they're outnumbered almost two to one by a Shimazu force with superior morale. Thankfully, they aren't required to be be as stupid as Sengoku Hisahide.<br/><br/>"}, "164792": {"rpgartist": ["Clipart.com", "Walter J.

Asamblea no busca la confrontaci&oacute;n ni los enfrentamientos directos; se trata de un ejercicio de dialogo y debate, donde se pongan en com&uacute;n los diferentes puntos de vista siempre teniendo en cuenta el respeto por el resto de jugadores y la palabra como &uacute;nica arma.<br/><br/>El objetivo del juego es tratar diferentes temas y posicionarse en los distintos puntos de vista mediante un debate conjunto. Aflorar nuestra capacidad de entendimiento y aprender a convencer a otras personas de nuestra postura por medio del dialogo y la palabra. Cada partida de Asamblea consta de 5 debates/temas, los cuales tras finalizar un tiempo acordado ser&aacute;n votados. En funci&oacute;n de la votaci&oacute;n los jugadores recibir&aacute;n unos puntos. Al finalizar los 5 debates el jugador con m&aacute;s puntos recibe las felicitaciones del resto del grupo.<br/><br/>"}, "164804": {"rpgdesigner": ["Michael Raston"], "rpg": ["Labyrinth Lord"], "statistics": [], "name": "The Towers of the Weretoads", "rpgartist": ["Michael Raston"], "rpgproducer": ["Michael Raston"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2223120.png", "usersrated": "0", "rpgitemversion": ["PDF Version"], "average": "0", "rpggenre": ["Fantasy"], "rpgpublisher": ["Gorgzu Games"], "rpgcategory": ["Scenario / Adventure / Module"], "poll": [], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2223120_t.png", "description": "(publisher blurb)<br/><br/>Are you in need of a breeding factory that spews out torrents of mutated weretoads into your campaign world?

There are two levels of play, Apprentice and Executive, to ease younger players into the mechanics.<br/><br/>Apprentice Game<br/><br/>You start the game with a set of brand cards (one per brand category per player) which are shuffled and dealt to you. You are also given 50 million and the youngest player starts. You place your chosen playing piece on the board (you can start anywhere) and move the number you spin with the arrow in the centre of the board.  Each time you land on a coloured square you collect two more brand cards of that colour, or one if the board instructs you. Once you have three or more of a coloured brand you can announce a launch of your company. The person to your right shuffles the risky business cards, turning the cards over one at a time, so you can judge how much you will risk without getting a BUST! card. You then multiply the money by the number of brand cards you launched with. No takeover or newsflash cards are used.<br/><br/>Executive Rules<br/><br/>Add in the newsflash cards for a chance, which could be good or bad (named brands will change in value), and you have a game with a greater element of risk. These rules differ as you now have the chance when you land on the takeover spots on the board to pick up a takeover disc. The next time one of your competitors launches a company you can attempt a takeover. Adding the total of your brand cards, plus any additional 'on the up' brands, plus a spin of the central spinner. If you beat the opponent you win all their cards but be careful if you lose they launch their company with more brands and therefore can earn more money.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": ["First edition"], "age": "8", "name": "Logo Billionaire", "playingtime": "45", "boardgamemechanic": ["Press Your Luck", "Set Collection"], "average": "4.14286", "usersrated": "7", "boardgamefamily": ["Logo Board Game"]}, "164807": {"boardgamedesigner": ["John Godsland"], "poll": [], "name": "Space Wars", "playingtime": "0", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": ["Card Drafting"], "yearpublished": "1995", "usersrated": "0", "maxplayers": "8", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2237845_t.jpg", "average": "0", "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["Partizan Press"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2237845.jpg", "boardgameversion": ["First edition"], "maxplaytime": "0", "boardgamecategory": ["Abstract Strategy", "Card Game", "Science Fiction"], "age": "0", "minplaytime": "0", "description": "User Description<br/><br/>Space Wars is a short Tactical Space Combat Game utillising 2 decks of playing cards (through large game of 6-8 players will need 3 decks).<br/><br/>The game is started by making up space ships from &quot;Fighters&quot; to &quot;Mother Ships&quot; by placing sets of cards on the table.<br/><br/>Then the game can start which has a four turn sequence where players can launch attacks on the other players ships by playing cards to fire missilles, lasers, board enemy ships and repair their own ships.<br/><br/>The winner is the player who has the last ship left.<br/><br/>First published in Valkyrie (Volume 1, Issue 9 - 1995) magazine.<br/><br/>"}, "164808": {"average": "6.25", "poll": [], "name": "El Switcher", "playingtime": "45", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": ["Pattern Building", "Pattern Recognition"], "yearpublished": "2013", "usersrated": "20", "maxplayers": "4", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2468225_t.jpg", "boardgameartist": ["Decur"], "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["Mald\u00f3n"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2468225.jpg", "boardgameversion": ["Spanish edition"], "maxplaytime": "45", "boardgamecategory": ["Abstract Strategy"], "age": "10", "minplaytime": "45", "description": "A strategy game where the player who first formed all figures from his deck on the board with the movements of their cards wins.<br/>Topic: Form shapes with movements<br/>Game Type: Wit and Strategy<br/>Illustrations: Decur<br/>Age: 10 to 99<br/>Contents: 36 tiles in 4 colors, 49 movement cards, 4 decks of 23 figure cards, 1 board, and 1 rule.<br/><br/>Original description in spanish:<br/>El Switcher es un juego de estrategia e ingenio en el que los jugadores deber&aacute;n formar 21 figuras determinadas moviendo las fichas en el tablero.

The game begins just after the Bohemian Revolt where the very Catholic Ferdinand II (future Holy Roman Emperor) of Austria was elected to the Thrones of Bohemia and Hungary. Many Protestants felt they would lose their religious rights and a small revolt occurred. This revolt soon spread as other Protestant leaders felt emboldened.  The Player represents the Commander of the Protestant Forces with the goal to overthrow the Holy Roman Empire. As the Commander of the Protestant Forces, you must control a significant number of Cities and Towns throughout Europe before the last Campaign Card is Played.<br/><br/>GAME OBJECTIVE: Player takes command of the Protestant Forces. The Player&rsquo;s Objective is to attempt to control at least 16 Cities and 14 Towns before the &ldquo;Peace of Westphalia&rdquo; Card is Played. If the Catholics control 16 Cities and 14 Towns at the end of their Turn, the Holy Roman Empire wins.<br/><br/>By Fire and Sword is a fast and fun game with lots of colorful game counters representing the various military units of the time, including Pike &amp; Musket, Musketeers, Cavalry, Cuirassiers and Cannon. Major leaders of the war are represented and lead forces on the map. Battles and Sieges have, almost, a &quot;miniatures&quot; feel to them as they are resolved on a Battle Mat.<br/><br/>GAME MECHANICS: The Player moves his Leader Counters on the Map along with their Troop Points. If a Battle occurs, Troop Points are exchanged for Tactical Units and combat is carried out in a Tactical manner on a Battle Mat. If there are any Reserve Units in the &quot;Play Area&quot;, he may add them to a Battle Force.<br/><br/>"}, "164828": {"rpgdesigner": ["Graham Bottley"], "rpg": ["Maelstrom Domesday"], "statistics": [], "name": "Trouble at t'mill", "rpgartist": ["Steve Luxton", "Chris Waller"], "rpgproducer": ["Graham Bottley", "Samuel Byford"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2225292.jpg", "usersrated": "1", "rpgitemversion": ["PDF Version"], "average": "6", "rpggenre": ["Fantasy", "History (Britain / Ireland)"], "rpgpublisher": ["Arion Games"], "rpgcategory": ["Scenario / Adventure / Module"], "poll": [], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2225292_t.jpg", "description": "From the first page of the book:<br/><br/>&quot;This investigative adventure comes complete with abridged rules and pregenerated characters and contains almost everything you need to play Maelstrom Domesday.

All thanks to Demoralizer, a love battle where no holds are barred.<br/><br/>This card game by Krzysztof Miller overcomes the classic scheme of game for couples, and makes a perfect example of playing with the form and breaking stereotypes. The game can be played by 2 &ndash; 6 people, who have only one goal &ndash; to demoralize the opponents. Each player takes the role of one of the six available characters: Blondi, Gangster, XXX Actor, Vamp, Scientist, or&hellip;  Grandma. Each character is described by four indicators: sex appeal, composure, cleverness, and morality. The level of these features, however, can be changed while playing the game by the action of cards, which players use during gameplay, as well as a direct result of actions taken by the opponents. To perform a successful pickup, thus depriving the other player his morality points, the level of attacking player&rsquo;s sex appeal must be higher than the composure of defending player. Only adequate calculation and analysis of indicators&rsquo; levels can protect a player against demoralization.<br/><br/>The game is divided into players&rsquo; turns. Each player&rsquo;s turn is divided into six phases: discarding, drawing, activation, playing cards, seduction, and final phase. During the playing cards phase, players play on the table their cards from hand: action, helper, item, event or skill. To do this, however, a player has to pay the cost with his cleverness points. In addition, the character cards determine how many cards of a particular type the player can handle. Seduction phase is optional. A player may, but don&rsquo;t have to, try to attack any number of opponents during his turn. Futhermore, a player can attack not only with his character card, but also with helper cards, if he has got them. The same applies to defense.<br/><br/>When the level of player character&rsquo;s morality drops to zero, that player loses and he is automatically eliminated from further play. The game continues until only one player remains and becomes the ultimate demoralizer.<br/><br/>Demoralizer is a game for those who in the heat of battle do not forget about strategic thinking. Thanks to unique characters&rsquo; features, playing each of them requires a slightly different approach. The differences in the attributes determine strategy - sometimes player's attacks will be more frequent, or on the contrary - he will have to raise composure level and wait for the right moment to pickup the opponent.<br/><br/>The average gameplay takes approx. 30-45 minutes.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": ["Multilingual first edition"], "age": "14", "name": "Demoralizer", "playingtime": "45", "boardgamemechanic": ["Campaign / Battle Card Driven", "Card Drafting", "Player Elimination", "Role Playing"], "average": "0", "usersrated": "0", "boardgamefamily": ["Admin: Unreleased Games"]}, "164852": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2275734.jpg", "poll": [], "boardgamedesigner": ["Wojciech Zalewski"], "statistics": [], "yearpublished": "2011", "maxplayers": "2", "age": "14", "boardgamepublisher": ["Taktyka i Strategia"], "maxplaytime": "90", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2275734_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "90", "boardgamecategory": ["Wargame", "World War II"], "description": "Expansion for Moskwa 1941 that covers fights around Tula in second half of November 1941.<br/><br/>Contains board and 84 new counters.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": ["First Edition"], "name": "Panzerarmee Guderian", "playingtime": "90", "boardgamemechanic": ["Dice Rolling", "Hex-and-Counter"], "average": "0", "boardgameexpansion": [], "usersrated": "0", "boardgamefamily": ["WB-95 (Wielkie Bitwy 1939-45)"]}, "164854": {"rpgartist": ["Cristi Balanescu", "Tey Bartolome", "Arden Beckwith", "Madeline Boni", "Alberto Bontempi", "Matt Bradbury", "Nora Brisotti", "Christopher Burdett", "Sidharth Chaturvedi", "Anthony Devine", "Tony Foti", "Mariusz Gandzel", "David Griffith", "Joel Hustak", "Jeff Lee Johnson", "Jason Juta", "David Kegg", "Mark Molnar", "Jake Murray", "Thomas Wievegg"], "rpgitemversion": ["Hardcover Version"], "poll": [], "name": "Stay on Target", "rpgdesigner": ["John Crowdis", "Sterling Hershey", "Keith Kappel", "Jason Marker"], "rpgproducer": ["David Ardila", "Chris Beck", "Brian Casey", "Andrew Christensen", "Edge Studio", "Christopher Gerber", "Molly Glover", "Eric Knight", "Paul Poppleton", "Zoe Robinson", "Andrew S.

The focus of the game lies on the wars between Britain and France and her allies in the years 1775 to 1815. Each player takes on the role of an admiral, commander or captain whose command could include a single ship or a fleet of several vessels. The core game (&quot;All Hands!&quot;) has five scenarios to choose from, everything from a small, fast and furious encounter between two frigates to a strategic action involving a total of 16 ships-of&ndash;the-line.<br/><br/>A game turn equates to a &frac12;-hour watch on the day of battle. In each turn, players will play cards to execute sailing maneuvers such as tacking, wearing, or changing sail configuration in order to put their ships into position for devastating broadsides or even rakes on the enemy vessels.<br/><br/>In larger engagements, ships are grouped together in squadrons and usually form a &quot;Line of Battle&quot;, a formation that provides the commander with the most control over his fleet. Using Admiral's Order cards players signal general commands to their squadrons ranging from &quot;Form a Keel Line&quot; and &quot;Wearing in succession&quot; to &quot;Prepare for Close Action&quot;. Keeping the ships in formation and effectively deploying the fleet in the heat of battle while also retaining the initiative is the main challenge for a commander.<br/><br/>Occasionally, ships will engage each other in brutally destructive Close Quarter combat. In such situations, the game &quot;zooms&quot; into the action: Using a set of &quot;Close Action&quot; cards, players can employ grapeshot, grenades, carronades, and sharpshooters to wreak destruction on the opposing vessel's upper deck. Through a clever use of grappling hooks and boarding crews it is possible to overcome the enemy's defenses to take the ship as the ultimate prize.<br/><br/>All scenarios can be played by two players, but most also provide the option to split command between two players per side. Playing time depends on the scenario. While an engagement between two frigates should last no more than 1-2 hours, fighting the Battle of Cape Henry will take four hours or longer.<br/><br/>The game is produced in a small edition and comes in a beautiful box, designed with a picture from Thomas Whitcombe. It has a wooden presentation box with 36 hand-crafted, wooden ship models.

This remarkable circumstance results from the informal, collaborative culture of science-fiction fandom, where ideas roam without much regard for inventors and ownership, but with fastidious attention to anything that fascinates fans and stimulates creativity.<br/><br/>In the eighteen pages of rules above, we see the first role-playing game condensed down to its most basic elements, reinvented by someone who learned by playing rather than studying rulebooks. VanGrasstek first encountered the game in February 1974 thanks to Louis Fallert, who had in turn experienced Blackmoor under the tutelage of Arneson's immediate circle in the Twin Cities. Few copies of Dungeons &amp; Dragons were circulating at that point, and thus, in the reaction of VanGrasstek's peers in the Minneapolis science-fiction fandom community, we find some of the earliest commentary on the startling innovations that Dungeons &amp; Dragons introduced. VanGrasstek at the time had the foresight to commit the rules as he understood them to paper: these Rules to the Game of Dungeon, first promulgated in August of 1974.<br/><br/>"}, "164878": {"boardgamedesigner": ["Koota Yamada"], "average": "0", "poll": [], "name": "Edo Craftsman Story", "playingtime": "120", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": ["Dice Rolling", "Set Collection"], "yearpublished": "2014", "usersrated": "0", "maxplayers": "4", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2228566_t.jpg", "boardgameartist": ["Dommiy"], "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["\u30a4\u30de\u30b8\u30f3\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u30ba (imagine GAMES)"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2228566.jpg", "boardgameversion": ["Game Market first edition"], "maxplaytime": "120", "boardgameimplementation": ["IKI"], "age": "12", "minplaytime": "120", "description": "User summary:<br/><br/>An 1800 Tokyo (Edo) themed, dice-driven point collecting game.

It is a mash up of first-person shooter, survival horror and role-playing games combining combat, crafting, looting, mining, exploration, and character growth. It was released through Early Access on Steam on December 13, 2013 for Windows and OS X.<br/><br/>Story &amp; Premise<br/><br/>In the near future a third world war leaves the Earth in ruins but the worst was yet to come. Nobody knows for sure if it was the radiation, or biochemical weapons, but an unknown virus soon transforms the surviving humans into an army of the animated dead, acting as a single-minded being.<br/><br/>You play a survivor trapped in the savage zombie infested world of Navezgane County, Arizona: one of the last true Edens on Earth. Incidentally, Navezgane means &ldquo;Killer of Monsters&rdquo; to the Apache who have inhabited the land for centuries, and that&rsquo;s pretty much what you&rsquo;ll do as you fight to survive and search for the truth behind what really happened.<br/><br/>Gameplay<br/><br/>In 7 Days To Die the player spawns into a randomly generated world, with the objective of surviving for as long as possible. As the days go by, the zombies get tougher and more aggressive. The game features the ability to craft, destroy, and manipulate objects. The game also comes with a physics system in which building a structure with no support such as pillars and walls can lead to its collapse. The game is voxel-based, allowing for simple building, and destruction of objects in a fully physics-simulated environment with smooth terrain. The game's main focus is to have the players try to survive the night, as the game features a day and night cycle, making the zombies slow and weak during the day, yet fast and aggressive during nighttime. Also the game features a system in which the character constantly needs food and water. Objects in the world degrade over use, so the player will also have to be searching for or make new tools as the game progresses. Currently the game is in Alpha phase and does not have the many of the planned features, such as NPC quests, vehicles, temperature survival elements and ability to randomly generate maps. The world is fully destructible and mold-able. The player can build their own house or destroy existing ones in order to gather materials to construct a fort. The game also features stealth and distraction system to avoid unnecessary conflict with the zombies. The zombies in 7 Days to Die will climb, dig, destroy walls, doors, or even entire buildings if necessary to get to the player and kill them. This leads to the player needing to set up traps for the defense of his or her base.<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;7 Days to Die&quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "164880": {"boardgamedesigner": ["Gary McCarty"], "average": "0", "poll": [], "name": "Global Crisis", "playingtime": "15", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": ["Hand Management"], "yearpublished": "2014", "usersrated": "0", "maxplayers": "4", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2425441_t.jpg", "boardgameartist": ["Gary McCarty"], "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["The Game Crafter, LLC"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2425441.jpg", "boardgameversion": ["First edition"], "maxplaytime": "15", "boardgamecategory": ["Card Game", "Spies/Secret Agents"], "age": "12", "minplaytime": "15", "description": "Nation rises against nation...

Herbert and Wilma (Wally's son and wife) are trapped and Wally must rescue them, build a raft and escape. The player only controls Wally and must solve puzzles and avoid obstacles like animals and natives - especially the tribe chief, who's patrolling the area. Each puzzle solved builds a piece of escape raft. As with previous Wally games humour plays an important part in both the gameplay and puzzle solving. The graphics were detailed and the Spectrum version had an option to switch off Wally's natural colour, which would remove the colour clash.

Much like Micro Machines, the player controls a miniature toy car, with tracks comprising various elements of a larger structure, such as a kitchen table, a garage workbench, a Japanese restaurant, and a picnic table. Much like Mario Kart, cars have simple, arcade-like controls.<br/><br/>The player has two options as to how to control the cars; &quot;Tilt&quot; features accelerometer steering (tilting the physical device to the left to turn left and to the right to turn right) and &quot;Simple&quot; features touch to steer (where the play touches the left side of the touchscreen to turn left, and the right side to turn right). Both modes use auto-accelerate and auto-brake. Within most races, the player can collect items which can then be used during the race, such as &quot;speed boosts&quot; or &quot;projectile attacks&quot;.<br/><br/>Generally, the goal of each race is to compete against multiple other cars, with the aim of finishing first. However, there are also several other modes of play; such as catching up to another car who is given a head start, elimination-style races where the last car every twenty seconds is eliminated, and time trials. At the end of each race, the player is given a zero to three star rating based on how well they performed, with better scores awarded with higher amounts of in-game currency, which can subsequently be used to upgrade and customize the player's vehicle, or buy new vehicles. The game also features in-app purchases, allowing the player to use real life money to purchase in-game currency.<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;Table Top Racing&quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "164907": {"poll": [], "name": "Pure Pool", "videogamemode": ["Network Multiplayer", "Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["Microsoft Windows edition", "PS4 download edition"], "average": "0", "videogametheme": ["Sports - Cue Sports"], "usersrated": "0", "videogamedeveloper": ["Voofoo Studios"], "videogamegenre": ["Simulation"], "videogameplatform": ["PlayStation 4", "Windows"], "videogamehonor": ["2014 Global Game Awards Best Sports Game of the Year Nominee"], "statistics": [], "videogamepublisher": ["Ripstone"], "description": "The game features standard cue sports game types in addition to a game-specific mode called Accumulator.

Many major landmarks are on the map, it was very cool to drive around and visit Yankee Stadium, Cape Canaveral, Mount Rushmore, Las Vegas etc.<br/><br/>The map is full of missions that you can attempt, you drive across the trigger spot and then do what the missions ask. Mission types are things like Speed runs where you have to maintain a high speed and dodge traffic, Slalom runs where you weave in and out of virtual markers and traffic on the road in front of you, Jump for distance, Hill Climbing, Accuracy runs where you have to follow a precise track, etc. Doing the mission well rewards you with improved car parts, virtual money and experience. Soup up your car with the parts, buy more parts or brand new cars or decorations like spoilers and paint jobs with the cash, and level up with the experience. Levelling up gives you a perk point to spend on your character in five different categories. Missions have a minimum level required, so some won't be available to attempt until you level up. There will also be a real world currency option for those who want to just buy things outright rather than slowly work their way up.<br/>The Crew is a revolutionary action-driving game developed exclusively for next-gen consoles.

The Pathfinder Roleplaying Game: Core Rulebook and The Pathfinder Bestiary are suggested when using the Pathfinder Roleplaying Game.<br/><br/>Ravenloft is a setting of gothic horror. A mist shrouded land where villains are given power, but have an inability to grasp what they most desire. Ravenloft is an oubliette, seemingly watched over by Dark Powers. The mist that surrounds the land and the very earth itself is cursed it is under the sway of these dark powers. Some see the Land of the Mists as a prison, a fickle experiment or even a crucible where the resolve of heroes is tested.<br/><br/>Ravenloft may be used as a full setting where the players are permanent residents of this dread realm.

Some say it is a prison for the damned; some say it is a crucible to test the virtuous. It is a land of mist and shadow, love and death, sacrifice and seduction, beauty and  horror. It is a land of whispered fears made manifest. It is the Realm of Dread.<br/><br/>Perhaps you have sensed its touch? Tendrils of its ethereal Mists sometimes reach out to caress the Material Plane at the behest of its Dark Powers. They stroke the skin at the back of your neck when a creaking floorboard warns that you are not alone in the dark. They are drawn to innocence  and villainy, to loathing and desire, to obsession, and to despair. They seek out squandered dreams and inner demons. They savour the decay of the spirit. The Mists snatch up fiends at the moment of their ruin and steal upon heroes in their moments of doubt.<br/><br/>The land itself is a construct, stolen from other worlds or created wholesale from the Mists in imitation. The misted lands respond like no other to the passion plays and conflicts carried out upon them, becoming impregnated with emotion and warping to reflect the most evil villains imprisoned within them.<br/><br/>To  what  end  do  the  Dark  Powers  add  these  souls  to their  tarnished  collection?  To torment them? To purify them? To answer the eternal question of whether Good can triumph over Evil? None can say, for  although the Mists are easy to enter, they are almost impossible to leave, and few drawn into the Realm of Dread ever leave to tell the tale.<br/><br/>Welcome to the Land of the Mists.

Beginning with the assassination of Emperor Alexander Severus, a period of 50 years saw nearly as many different men seize imperial power over all or part of the Empire, until the reforms of Diocletian in 284 AD ushered in an era of peace.<br/><br/>In Time of Crisis, 2-4 players take the reins of Roman dynasties, gathering and wielding influence among the senate, military, and people of Rome to ensure that their legacies are remembered by history instead of being lost to the mists of time.  Starting from control of one province and a few low-value cards, you are challenged to establish your base of power during this fragile period of Roman history.  You must build your armies, take control of valuable provinces, develop your support, and defend yourself against barbarian incursions, inopportune events, and the machinations of your political opponents.<br/><br/>Time of Crisis is easy to learn and playable in about 2-3 hours.  It incorporates popular game mechanisms such as deckbuilding and hand management, but also delivers a true light wargame experience.  The historical flavor is strong, with many meaningful decisions and opportunities presented to players on the board.  This game finally fully closes the loop between deckbuilding card games and board games.  Your cards dictate what actions are available to you on the board, and in turn, your position on the board directly determines how you can add or remove cards from your deck to make yourself stronger for future turns.  Will you specialize in manipulating the Senate, wielding the power of the Legions, or being a man of the People?  Or will you master a blend of all three?  In a twist unlike most deckbuilding games, you have the privilege of selecting the cards that compose your hand each turn!  However, you still need to eventually work through  your entire deck before you can use your cards again, so deck management and timing is critical.<br/><br/>All of the key elements of the era are present in Time of Crisis:  civil wars between competing generals and governors, Roman legions defending the frontiers against barbarian tribes, Senate favoritism, barracks emperors, even angry mobs, inflation, the Praetorian Guard, and the ability to carve off your own piece of the Roman Empire.  Can your dynasty arise as the new leaders of the Roman Empire before Diocletian emerges and brings peace once again?<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": ["GMT first edition"], "age": "0", "name": "Time of Crisis", "playingtime": "150", "boardgamemechanic": ["Action Point Allowance System", "Area Movement", "Campaign / Battle Card Driven", "Card Drafting", "Deck / Pool Building", "Dice Rolling", "Hand Management"], "average": "7.6875", "usersrated": "8", "boardgamefamily": ["Admin: Unreleased Games", "Ancient Rome"]}, "164950": {"poll": [], "name": "Tennis", "playingtime": "5", "boardgamecompilation": ["5Pax"], "minplayers": "1", "boardgamemechanic": ["Dice Rolling"], "yearpublished": "2014", "usersrated": "2", "boardgamefamily": ["Crowdfunding: Kickstarter", "Sports: Tennis"], "maxplayers": "3", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2228375_t.png", "average": "5.5", "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["Galliant Games"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2228375.png", "boardgameversion": ["First Edition"], "maxplaytime": "5", "boardgamecategory": ["Sports"], "age": "10", "minplaytime": "5", "description": "Tennis is played on 2 boards (included).

Build a party of fighters, priests, mages and thieves to run deep into the dungeon. Test your courage and skill against groups of orcs, trolls, vampires and dragons.<br/><br/>Earning its reputation as the thinking man's dungeon game, Oubliette blends the thrill of mortal combat with the sublime challenges of strategy, planning and adaptation. Rather than testing your reaction speed and nerves, like a first person shooter, Oubliette challenges the player to do<br/>careful strategic planning as well as make tactical decisions in the heat of battle.<br/><br/>Each player (character) in the game is created from one of eight player races, which vary in attributes such as strength, intelligence, dexterity and durability. Elves are highly intelligent and (potentially) immortal, Orcs are strong with short life spans, Dwarves are strong with high wisdom, Kobolds are quite weak in most areas but advance more quickly.<br/><br/>Depending on these attributes, each player will be qualified to join a limited number of player classes (occupations). More balanced players will have more choices, including Hirebrand (fighter), Mage, Priest and Thief. Less commonly, players may be qualified for a highly selective class with special skills such as Ranger, Sage, Paladin, Samurai or Ninja.<br/><br/>Unlike games which focus on a single player against multiple opponents, Oubliette allows a party of up to 10 players with complementary skills to face the various types of monsters found in the dungeon. There are more than 160 different monsters, and to deal with them, more than 150 different pieces of equipment, which may be enchanted with special properties or skills.<br/><br/>Oubliette is challenging, - New players commonly have their parties wiped out by an unfamiliar group of monsters. In fact, your party can meet up to 3 monster groups at the same time! Use the Temporal Chamber to save a Temporal Portal before dangerous trips. If things turn out badly, use the Temporal Chamber to turn back the clock and try again. The trapeze is every bit as thrilling, but safer, with a net below.<br/><br/>Explore the easier levels of the dungeon to build your party and expertise. And then, when you are ready, feel the power of the game on the deeper levels.

It was first unveiled as a demo for Microsoft Windows in 2012, and it was released for personal computers running Windows, Mac OS X, and Linux on July 21, 2014. The game stars an anthropomorphic dragon, wildcat, and basset hound respectively named Sash Lilac, Carol Tea, and Milla Basset, who are on a quest together to defeat the evil Lord Brevon. Its fast-paced 2D platforming gameplay has been frequently compared to that of the Sega Genesis Sonic the Hedgehog games. Mostly as a result of these similarities, the game has been well-received by critics.<br/><br/>Freedom Planet is a 2D platform/action game. The player controls any of the three playable characters&mdash;Lilac, Carol, or Milla&mdash;while running and jumping through levels and destroying robotic enemies. These levels involve environmental features such as corkscrews, loop-the-loops, hills, ramps, and rock walls. The player fights a miniboss in the middle of each level and a main boss at the end. As a result of pervasive gameplay, aesthetic, and level design similarities, Freedom Planet has been frequently compared to the Sonic the Hedgehog games released for the Sega Genesis in the early 1990s.<br/><br/>One significant difference from Sonic is that the player has a standard health meter instead of Sonic's ring-based health system. The player collects red leaves scattered throughout the levels and occasionally dropped by enemies to regain health. Lilac's maximum health is seven leaves, Carol's six, and Milla's four. Being hit by common enemies and bosses' attacks chips away at the player's health; when the player is attacked with no remaining health, they lose a life. Losing all lives gets the player a game over; however, they can restart from the last checkpoint with little consequence. Extra lives can be found occasionally within levels.<br/><br/>Each of the playable characters has a basic attack and a special attack. The basic attack can be used repeatedly with no penalty, but the more powerful special attack depletes an energy gauge shown on the game's heads-up display and cannot be performed before the gauge has sufficiently recharged. The basic attacks are similar, but Lilac's special attack is a rapid air dash, Carol's is a series of rapid kicks, and Milla's involves launching a gelatinous energy cube. Carol can also wall-jump, and she periodically finds motorcycles throughout her levels that allow her to scale walls smoothly. Lilac can also perform a twirling, tornado-like double jump.<br/><br/>The player can complete the game in either the &quot;Adventure&quot; or &quot;Classic&quot; mode. Classic Mode omits the game's cutscenes, but allows the player to choose Milla; she is not playable in Adventure. In Adventure Mode, the player does not select a character from the beginning, but early on when Lilac and Carol temporarily split up. After a stage has been cleared, the player can complete it as a time attack. The game features numerous achievements such as defeating an end-of-level boss with a certain move or clearing all of a certain character's stages. There are also collectible tablets that are dispersed throughout levels and place artwork in a gallery that can be viewed later.<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;Freedom Planet&quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "164974": {"poll": [], "name": "Costume Quest 2", "videogamemode": ["Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["Linux Downloadable edition", "Mac Downloadable edition", "PC downloadable edition", "XBLA Xbox 360 Downloadable edition", "Xbox One Downloadable edition"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3224581.png", "videogameseries": ["Costume Quest"], "videogametheme": ["Comedy", "Cute Fantasy", "Occult"], "usersrated": "7", "videogamedeveloper": ["Double Fine Productions"], "videogamegenre": ["RPG"], "videogameplatform": ["Linux", "Macintosh", "Windows", "Xbox 360", "Xbox One"], "average": "6.78571", "statistics": [], "videogamepublisher": ["Double Fine Productions", "Midnight City"], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3224581_t.png", "description": "A sequel to the original game Costume Quest, players once again take control of siblings Wren and Reynold to save Halloween!<br/><br/>"}, "164975": {"boardgamedesigner": ["Carlos A.
