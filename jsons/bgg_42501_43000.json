A mere four pages of rules means it&rsquo;s easy to play. Components also include a playing map, popularity track and three sheets of cardstock playing pieces. Two or three players ages 12 to adult.<br/><br/>From the game background:<br/><br/>After recent elections the Ruling Party gained control of the Presidency and a majority in both houses of Congress. They immediately set about to &ldquo;restore the promise of America&rdquo; through wide sweeping reforms. The rich were taxed. The poor received free health care, education, and housing. Big Business was regulated. The environment was saved. The civil rights of pornographers, illegal immigrants and underage children were preserved. The victory of Labor over their capitalist exploiters was assured for the first time since FDR.<br/><br/>But these reforms provoked equally widespread opposition from right-wing extremists. It became obvious that after the next election the minions of rich Wall Street capitalists would overturn many of the reforms and renew their attacks on the environment. The Christian Right stood ready to poison the minds of school children with creationist dogma. Only quick action by right-thinking patriots could save the Republic&hellip;<br/><br/>Play the crusading Big Government do-gooders or their gun-toting Conservative opposition. Each turn players can choose from various political actions as they attempt to &ldquo;save the Republic&rdquo; in their own way. Eventually martial law will be declared and the game takes on more of a military nature, as bullets instead of ballots determine the destiny of America. The game features overseas garrisons, militia recruitment, terrorist attacks, packing the Supreme Court, the National Guard, defecting government troops, air strikes, UN intervention, mass arrests and more as each side tries to &ldquo;restore the promise of America.&rdquo;<br/><br/>The rules are written from a darkly humorous perspective and the game is fun to play, a real conversation starter.

There are three kinds of pieces: scissors, paper and rock. The capture-rules for White are as follows: white scissors take black paper, white paper take black rock and white rock take black scissors. Correspondingly the capture-rules for Black: black scissors take white paper, black paper take white rock and black rock take white scissors.<br/><br/>In the beginning of the game each player has four pieces of each kind, i.e. 12 pieces in all. The board is divided into 6 by 6 squares and the pieces are set according to figure 1. The game is over, when other player wins the game or the players agree on a draw. The player wins the game, when he/she captures the other player's last piece or when the other player cannot move any piece.<br/><br/>The moves<br/>Each player, in turns, moves one piece. The White player starts the game. Every piece can be moved in the same way: one square at a time in any direction on the board, i.e. forwards, backwards, to the sides and also diagonally forwards and backwards. If a piece does not capture another piece within a move, it can be moved only to an empty square.<br/><br/>In the game is one special move, called return-move: When a piece has made it to the opponent's side to the last row, it can be moved back on some of the next turns, to its own side's first row, to the same column's or adjacent column's empty square. (There is at most three possible squares for a return-move.) When making a return-move, the piece can be exchanged for a piece that is not currently on the board. Making the return-move the piece can not capture other pieces. Examples of possible moves and return-moves are presented in figure 2.<br/><br/>"}, "42554": {"boardgamedesigner": {"3": {"name": "(Uncredited)"}}, "poll": {}, "name": "Battles with Brusilov", "playingtime": "400", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": {"2072": "Dice Rolling"}, "yearpublished": "2003", "usersrated": "0", "maxplayers": "10", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic481599_t.jpg", "average": "0", "statistics": {}, "boardgamepublisher": {"3320": {"name": "(Unknown)"}}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic481599.jpg", "boardgameversion": {"112225": "First Edition"}, "maxplaytime": "400", "boardgamecategory": {"1047": {"name": "Miniatures"}}, "age": "12", "minplaytime": "400", "description": "Battles with Brusilov is a miniatures rules set designed to allow grand tactical simulation of the mobile phases of World War I.

The campaign was a brief, bloody, and confusing affair fought between two armies which were considered equals by many in the world.<br/><br/>Despite the interesting campaign, there aren&rsquo;t many war games on the Polish campaign, probably because the conventional wisdom is that it was a very unbalanced contest. This is informed mostly by hindsight. The German Army knew it had superior numbers and organization, but much of its equipment was no better than that fielded by the Poles, the concept of blitzkrieg had not been proven in actual combat, and they were not at all sure that the campaign would not bog down into static fighting. As it was the Germans lost over 16,000 dead in five weeks of campaigning.<br/><br/>Summer Lightning uses a proven game system that features an interactive sequence of play and near-diceless combat that both shows the historical German superiority in command and control and is flexible enough to allow players to explore many variations and options, so that the game can be as equal (or unequal) a contest as they want. Options include: variable Polish deployments; greater or lesser surprise and speed of mobilization; changed attitudes of the Soviet Union or neighbouring countries; French intervention; Plan Zachod (the Romanian Bridgehead Strategy); and even the possibility that the Blitzkrieg, so appealing in theory, fizzles out on the battlefield. Also, because so many war games are designed for two but played by one, an optional solitaire play method is included.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "1", "boardgameversion": {"115597": "First Edition"}, "average": "6.73256", "name": "Summer Lightning: The Invasion of Poland 1939", "playingtime": "240", "boardgamemechanic": {"2057": "Chit-Pull System"}, "age": "12", "usersrated": "43", "boardgamesubdomain": {"4664": "Wargames"}, "boardgamefamily": {"10317": "Country: Poland"}}, "42592": {"boardgamedesigner": {"69022": {"name": "Walter Ruhland"}}, "poll": {}, "name": "Carmen probt Othello", "playingtime": "30", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": {"2041": "Card Drafting"}, "yearpublished": "0", "usersrated": "0", "boardgamefamily": {"5742": "Celebrities: Shakespeare"}, "maxplayers": "8", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic479074_t.jpg", "average": "0", "statistics": {}, "boardgamepublisher": {"11": {"name": "F.X.

One player will control the Axis forces (Vichy French, French colonial troops, and Germans), while his opponent controls the Allied forces (British, Commonwealth, Free French, etc). The playing pieces represent the actual units that participated in the campaign and the map represents the terrain over which those units fought. The players maneuver their units across the map and conduct combat according to the rules of play. One player wins by capturing certain specified objectives while his opponent wins by avoiding those victory conditions.<br/><br/>When Free French leader Gen. de Gaulle visited the Middle East in April 1941 he forced a political crisis by demanding the occupation of Syria. As a result London ordered an offensive to place all of Syria and Lebanon under Free French control. Sadly, such posturing caused Allied command staffs to hold unrealistic views of what the ensuing occupation would look like. Certain authorities believed the Vichy French in Syria would offer only token resistance and their defense would collapse like an eggshell. The thinking held that Vichy forces could be won over with wine and coffee along with displays of the Australian slouch hat. Instead, the Vichy-led troops fought ferociously from the start.<br/><br/>Players should feel free to combine play of this game with that of Rommel's War, published by L2 Design Group. Both games include the same historical moment, have identical scales, and have some of the same historical units. It is natural that players would want to explore more historical alternatives with combined play.

Not a good thing. Operation Sherdil (Lion Heart) began in August 2008 and was initially aimed at preventing the imminent fall of Khar, headquarters of Bajaur District, to the Taliban. The military operation was intended to reclaim all of Bajaur from the Taliban and al Qaeda, which amounted to around 3000 terrorists. On August 3rd, a 200-strong force from the paramilitary Frontier Corps were surrounded by 300-400 Taliban fighters, heavy fighting erupted as they tried to break out. After a three-day battle, the Pakistani troops routed back to Khar, and the Taliban seemed victorious. They quickly followed the Pakistani force and began to threaten Khar. Operation Sherdil was later expanded to recapturing all of Bajaur district from the Taliban. This proved to be a tall order and led to a protracted series of battles over two months. Pakistan's resolve came into question (as it still does). By late October, many of the objectives had been reached but not all. Loysam was not retaken until Oct. 25th. Over 2700 terrorists had been killed, yet, Bajaur Agency remained unsettled when the army left. It remains so to this day.<br/><br/>The Game<br/>Each turn is six days, with half mile hexes. Units are battalion and company for Pakistani forces, and platoon size for al-<br/>Qaeda and Taliban. The game is a true conventional military force taking on the terrorist groups in Bajaur Agency from August through October, 2008. The terrorists were well armed and had fortified many of the small towns outside of the city of Khar. They had been slowly taking over the area. Sherdil was prompted when a small force of paramilitary found themselves surrounded and under siege at Loysam from 300 Taliban. This Pakistani force managed to breakout and fled to Khar, which was under Taliban pressure. It was at this time the Pakistani military unleashed its forces in what many claim ended in a draw. Some 8000 soldiers, 20 Cobra gunships and F16 jets pounded the enemy, which numbered 3000. Pakistan's resolve came into question with this early offensive.<br/>In the game, the Pakistani army does not have unlimited resources to conduct a long offensive as each attack will cost. How well the Pakistani player orchestrates his attack will dictate who the winner is. The Taliban can literally appear and disappear in certain types of terrain making any attack questionable. Their unique movement and evasion will cause any Pakistani player frustration.<br/><br/>"}, "42700": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic481966.jpg", "poll": {}, "boardgamedesigner": {"8869": {"name": "Roberto Chiavini"}}, "statistics": {}, "yearpublished": "2009", "maxplayers": "0", "boardgameartist": {"10858": "Giulia Canova"}, "boardgamepublisher": {"6597": {"name": "TCS Games"}}, "maxplaytime": "0", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic481966_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "0", "boardgamecategory": {"1050": {"name": "Ancient"}}, "description": "The Glory That Was is a series of games depicting several different battles from the ancient world.<br/>Volume I, Greece, depicts a number of battles from the Persian War to the War of the Successors, while volume II, Rome, will have different battles from the Early Republic to the Late Roman Empire.<br/>After the Peloponnesian War, for around three decades Sparta was the uncontested military leader of the greek poleis, and considered almost invincible in an open field battle, for the strenght, the discipline and the courage of her hoplites.<br/>The battles depicted in this &ldquo;episode&rdquo; of our descent into the realm of the &ldquo;Glory that was Greece&rdquo;, both from 394 BC, testify the truth of this assertion, being both Spartan victories against coalitions of forces taken by several other Greek cities-states.<br/>Map scale will be variable, depending on the battle depicted, while each unit will normally represents from 100 to 1.000 infantry and from 25 to 250 cavalry or missile units.<br/><br/>Contains:<br/>2 8.5x11&quot; full color maps<br/>138 counters and markers<br/>14 Cards<br/>10 Page Rules in English<br/>1 Morale Chart<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "0", "boardgameversion": {"211216": "First Edition"}, "average": "5.66667", "name": "The Glory that Was Vol. I: Greece.

The miasmic shockwave of pure otherworldly magic spread outward from a point somewhere in the middle east, and in a few short hours plunged the entire globe into chaos. In those terrible moments, human civilization changed forever. <br/><br/>Magic infused their very bones, manifested in their children, came unbidden to the fingertips of their women, and plagued their countryside in uncontrolled bursts of power. Ordinary beasts of the wilderness were turned by these bursts into fanciful creatures of legend. Entire tribes of humans from all corners of the world were altered by the flood of uncontrolled magic, changing before the very eyes of their friends and neighbors into elves, dwarves, orcs, trolls, centaurs, and even minotaurs. Creatures that normally existed between our reality and others were shunted into this one, leaving ghosts, faeries, and other magical creatures stranded in our world in ways they were never intended to be. Even remnants of the Old World, gods of the ancients and their ken, were awakened from their immortal slumber through this great cataclysm to trouble mankind once more.<br/><br/>The world had changed forever.<br/><br/>The year is now 37BCE and the middle-east sits at the center of a vast struggle to control humanity&rsquo;s fate. Three powerful nations have harnessed the power unleashed by the day of chaos, and they struggle to claim dominance over the known world.

The goal is to control victory point areas and inflict losses on the opponent. Movement and battle resolution are conducted through a unique formation management mechanic that allows players to move figures around on the unit bases to increase either movement/melee/ranged combat at the cost of losing capabilities in the other areas.<br/><br/>Currently wrapping up play-testing as of May 2009. Arcane Legions will be available in September of 2009. Initially, look for 3 different factions (Egyptians, Romans, and Han Dynasty).<br/><br/>Figures are highly detailed true 25mm made from PVC 105. Common figures are unpainted with colored tempo prints on banners and shields, while all the uncommon, rare and Commander figures (Booster Pack contents) are fully pre-painted. The game is designed to use both types. There are 9 different unpainted common figures for each faction and at least 20 different fully painted premium figures for each faction. If you buy a legion bundle of a faction you receive around 70 prepainted figures, whereas buying one of each army pack gets you about 54 unpainted figures.<br/><br/>With more than 110 figures, the Starter Pack includes small armies for all three factions and enough formation bases, sortie bases and base cards for a complete two player game.

Over the following centuries, Europe was taken over. In the board game Opera, the players bring Opera to the public. In Venice, Vienna, Berlin, London, Paris and Milan great Opera houses arise. Opera leads the players through the periods of Baroque, Classicism and Romanticism. The epic music of six famous composers H&auml;ndel, Monteverdi, Mozart, Beethoven, Wagner and Verdi will bring the public to their Opera houses.<br/><br/>Clever budgeting is essential to gain control and be the master of your own success. Each round the players determine their budget level to influence the order of play and to activate the characters in the game. The players build new Opera Houses, scout for new Operas of popular composers and try to earn some money. Sometimes they choose to cash in at the Palazzo where the Signora pays them well, but in the long term music are one of the key fundamentals to build your empire. The elegant Maestro brings the performance of an Opera to a higher level and the Critico can make or break a composer. Do not overvalue the three counting rounds with progressively growing value, because a well timed appearance of the Esperto might just bring you the victory in Opera. Ducats and capacity are key elements to facilitate the growth of your empire and influence, but in the end wealth is just an instrument to attain higher ends.<br/><br/>In Opera the players must plan well. Introducing an Intermezzo from time to time might be helpful to seize the initiative on a decisive moment in the game. Opera takes place over 9 rounds of play, divided in 3 episodes. Each episode consists of three playing rounds and a counting round.

Two to four players represent investors in railway companies, spending their initial capital to buy wholly owned Private and Minor Companies and later buying shares in Public Companies. The Public Companies are each controlled by the largest shareholder (its Director). Minor Companies and Public Companies build track and run Trains in order to earn revenues. Public Company revenues can be paid out as dividends to shareholders or retained to fund further track and Trains. A feature of 1812, as with all the other games in the series, is that the interests of a Public Company&iacute;s Director and the interests of its shareholders are not identical, so minority shareholders need to be careful in their investments.<br/><br/>1812 is a medium length game.

The Locust horde arrived without warning, and countless horrors spilled forth from their underground burrows. The Coalition of Organized Governments (COG) struggled to fend off the subterranean threat, but their defenses were quickly crushed. With billions dead, humans turned their weapons of mass destruction on their own cities to deny the enemy control. Now the long struggle against overwhelming odds approaches one final, desperate stand.<br/><br/>Gears of War: The Board Game, designed by Corey Konieczka, is based on the wildly popular third-person shooter by Epic Games. One to four players take on the roles of COG soldiers cooperating to destroy the Locust horde, and must work together to complete missions against an ingeniously challenging and varied game system.

The two side lines are filled with each player's pegs. The number of pegs vary according to local tradition, typically 16 in Denmark and 12 in Norway.<br/>The game uses a pair of special four sided dice marked A, II, III and IV. You need to roll an A to free one of your pieces, the other rolls are used to move the pegs once freed. A peg may never overtake your other pegs, but must keep their place in the line.<br/>Once freed the pieces move down the middle aisle and if they manage to avoid being captured they move into the opponent's starting line, capturing the unfree pegs.<br/><br/>The origins of the game are unknown but it is believed to be inspired by certain middle-eastern and north african games, brought back by either vikings or crusaders.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": {"206140": "Gaud\u00e9 Cr\u00e9ation edition"}, "average": "6", "name": "Dald\u00f8s", "playingtime": "20", "boardgamemechanic": {"2035": "Roll / Spin and Move"}, "age": "6", "usersrated": "1", "boardgamesubdomain": {"4666": "Abstract Games"}, "boardgamefamily": {"18186": "The Reliquary Collection"}}, "42778": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic494127.jpg", "poll": {}, "boardgamedesigner": {"3": {"name": "(Uncredited)"}}, "statistics": {}, "yearpublished": "2009", "maxplayers": "4", "boardgameartist": {"3": "(Uncredited)"}, "boardgamepublisher": {"200": {"name": "Fundex"}}, "maxplaytime": "0", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic494127_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "0", "boardgamecategory": {"1064": {"name": "Movies / TV / Radio theme"}}, "description": "Star Trek themed Scrabble.

The game is a cleverly unique system that recreates the history of these series games. All of the actions that actually happened during the games from the 1952, 53, 55, and 56 series are charted onto the fields, and by a roll of the 3 dice (producing  216 different outcomes) these plays will happen according to the actual probability of such an event.  All of the ground outs, hits, (singles, doubles, triples, HR's), fly balls, line outs, strikeouts, walks, and errors! Anybody who is familiar with the &quot;Red Barber Baseball&quot; game of the 1950's will recognize the basic game system.<br/><br/>The game includes simple cardstock ballpark models of Yankee Stadium and Ebbets Field.  As well as Roster Sheets for both teams for 1952, 53, 55 and 56. These sheets include dice roll adjustments for each player in each park to better reflect each hitters achievements for each park during each year according to historical probability.  In many ways this is BASEBALL HISTORY at a glance.  Just looking at the ballpark recreations shows where all of the plays took place in each area of each park. This is a BASEBALL GAME which faithfully recreates the hitting exploits of each team in each ballpark, through all four of the Subway Series of the 1950's.<br/><br/>Additional infomation:<br/>The game as originally published in 1988 came with a short &quot;history&quot; of the four World Series that was written especially for this game by Hall of Fame sportswriter Bob  Broeg of St.Louis.  Very few games were printed and they were used primarily as a promo for BAUER DIAMONDS (maker of model ballpark kits).
