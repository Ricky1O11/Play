At its core lie the descriptions of pantheons for the main races and cultures of the Great Caldera, their individual deities, their mythologies, alliances, and foes. Each chapter reveals the history of the ancient peoples who summoned these gods into existence and established their cults. A significant part of this compendium details special powers mortal followers and priests can earn, based on the strengths of their piety. &ldquo;Beyond the Skies&rdquo; goes on to flesh out myriad servants of the gods, demons, demigods, divine cabals, the politics of pantheons and their internal rivalries, the bond between tribal shamans and Calidar&rsquo;s World Soul, the spirit lords of the Dread Lands, secret societies and knightly orders among mortals, right down to death and what lies beyond. This book provides quite a lot of mechanical bits to enhance the game in addition to mythologies, secret plots, and the floor plans of temples and secret brotherhood lairs, each an invitation for encounters and adventures.<br/><br/>Much like those of ancient Greece, gods interact with mortals and epic heroes in game of chess reaching past nearby planets and outer planes. However powerful they are, they face a world of dangers including another universe whose monstrous deities seek to devour all: from the masses of mortals to their divine patrons. They will not relent until, perhaps, they gobble the World Souls themselves&mdash;the magical core and the source of life of the planets in Soltan&rsquo;s ephemeris. As bleak as Calidar&rsquo;s future may seem, the gods fear that their deaths aren&rsquo;t the worst of fates. This aspect of their peril-fraught existence is one element contributing to the dynamics of this fantasy setting, as it directly affects the players&rsquo; heroes and the realms in which they go on adventuring. This compendium is crucial as it will influence all future titles published in this series.<br/><br/>"}, "191006": {"boardgamedesigner": ["Shotaro Nakashima"], "poll": [], "name": "Pictell", "playingtime": "30", "minplayers": "3", "yearpublished": "2015", "usersrated": "4", "maxplayers": "6", "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3039618_t.jpg", "average": "6.875", "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["(Self-Published)"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3039618.jpg", "boardgameversion": ["Japanese first edition"], "maxplaytime": "30", "boardgamecategory": ["Deduction", "Puzzle"], "age": "6", "minplaytime": "15", "description": "Using transparant cards , try to make your partners guess  items/characters/movies/book/etc. According the principle of rebus<br/><br/>"}, "191007": {"rpgartist": ["(Uncredited)"], "rpg": ["GUMSHOE"], "poll": [], "name": "Gumshoe Zoom: Alchemy", "rpgdesigner": ["Kenneth Hite"], "rpgproducer": ["Cathriona Tobin"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2827515.jpg", "usersrated": "0", "rpgitemversion": ["PDF Version"], "average": "0", "statistics": [], "rpggenre": ["Generic / Universal", "Occult (Magic)"], "rpgpublisher": ["Pelgrane Press"], "rpgcategory": ["Sourcebook (rules/options to enhance play)"], "rpgseries": ["GUMSHOE Zoom", "Ken Writes About Stuff"], "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2827515_t.jpg", "description": "From publisher blurb:<br/><br/>Chemistry or magic?

This time of galactic exploration, conquest, and colonization is known as the Infinite Age. The Milky Way Galaxy is roughly 100,000 light years in diameter and contains roughly 200 billion star systems. The majority of these systems lie in the dense Core region. The Galaxy is divided into four equal quadrants: The Orion Quadrant, the Sagittarius Quadrant, the Centaurus Quadrant, and the Perseus Quadrant.<br/><br/>The Orion Quadrant is the home of the Sol System and Earth. The star systems around Earth were the first colonized and are now heavily populated Core Worlds. These colonies are still owned by the traditional governments of Earth such as the U.S., China, European Union, Japan and others. Collectively, these worlds and their governments are called the Old Earth Empires. They are constantly embroiled in petty wars and strife, but still maintain uneasy relations with both the Interstellar Federation and the Pan-Solar Empire.<br/><br/>The Perseus Quadrant is home to the Interstellar Federation. The Federation is a strong union of former colonies that have gained their independence from Earth. The government is a Republican Monarchy with a President being elected for life. For the most part, the Federation is benevolent and fair in their government and laws. Citizens of the Federation enjoy a high standard of living.<br/><br/>The tyrannical Pan-Solar Empire governs most of the Sagittarius Quadrant. The Empire, like the Federation, is also comprised of old colony worlds. Unlike the Federation, they did not gain their independence. Instead, the mad Emperor Gregor Veroveren, who has ruled his quadrant with an iron fist for more than 300 Solar Years, conquered them. The Worlds of the Empire have all been raped of their natural resources to fuel the huge military/industrial complex of the Imperial Armed Forces. Citizens of the Empire live in squalid misery with no human rights. They view the Federation with jealous eyes. It is the Empire's ultimate goal to conquer the Federation and take its wealth.<br/><br/>The Centaurus Quadrant is home to many new Federation colonies and countless small independent governments. It is on the edge of explored space and most of the new planets are being discovered there. For this reason, it is called the Frontier. The Centaurus Quadrant is home to pirates and bandits and is considered a wild area of space. Many independent freighters try their luck against both the Empire raids and bandit piracy to deliver goods back and forth between the colonies and the Federation and the Old Earth Empires.<br/><br/>In all, the Galaxy supports an estimated 4.9 trillion human inhabitants on over 150,000 worlds worlds, and expanding. Core worlds are heavily industrialized worlds with populations exceeding ten billion. These were some of the first worlds colonized during man's expansion into space. There are less than 1000 Core Worlds in the Galaxy. Core Worlds are usually not self-sufficient and rely on supplies and resources from the outer Colony Worlds. Colony Worlds are relatively recently discovered worlds that are self-sufficient in terms of population, but have difficulty producing high-end goods. Some Colony Worlds have been settled for over 400 years and are on the verge of becoming galactic powers in their own right. Recently colonized worlds on the Galactic Frontier are heavily dependent on other worlds for technology and supplies. Their populations usually number less than one million, often in the thousands.<br/><br/>Federation Rangers are tasked to enforce Federation law in the Galactic Frontier and on Federation Colonies and Associate Worlds. They have no jurisdiction on Federation member worlds. There, Federation AstroPol maintains bases for permanent law enforcement.<br/><br/>Lightspeed IF is a Role-Playing Game set in the Galaxy of the 31st Century, a period known in the Infinite Futures game system as the Infinite Age. This is a time of exploration and adventure. The conflicts of the Core Wars are over and the Galaxy is at peace, though old animosities simmer just below the surface and new rivalries threaten to flare into conflict. The galaxy of the Infinite Age is vast, and its possibilities are limitless.<br/><br/>Lightspeed IF is a campaign sourcebook for use with the Infinite Futures 2.0 core rulebook and the Pathfinder role-playing game.<br/><br/>"}, "191023": {"poll": [], "name": "Tetris Ultimate", "videogamemode": ["Local Multiplayer", "Network Multiplayer", "Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["North American 3DS edition"], "average": "0", "videogametheme": ["Abstract"], "videogamefranchise": ["Tetris"], "videogamedeveloper": ["Ubisoft Entertainment S.A.

The remaining cards serve as monsters (spades and clubs), weapons (diamonds), and health potions (hearts) valued from 2-14 (Two through Ace).

The weapon breaks if it is used to attack a monster of equal or greater value than the previous monster.

Explore this convoluted construction, celebrate it's absurdity, and piece together it's strangely crafted stories.<br/><br/>Source: The Developer Website.<br/><br/>"}, "191159": {"poll": [], "name": "Tangiers", "videogamemode": ["Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["Windows Downloadable edition"], "average": "0", "videogametheme": ["Abstract"], "videogamegenre": ["Sandbox", "Stealth"], "videogamedeveloper": ["oysterFAKE"], "videogamefranchise": ["(Unreleased Games - Available)"], "videogameplatform": ["Windows"], "usersrated": "0", "statistics": [], "videogamepublisher": ["oysterFAKE"], "description": "<br/><br/><br/>    <br/>        <br/>UNRELEASED GAME &ndash; AVAILABLE<br/><br/>    <br/>    <br/>        <br/>This game is still either in Early-Alpha or Beta (or any status in between) but IS already available for sale / early access, so CAN BE PLAYED.<br/><br/>    <br/><br/><br/>Everything in the game is sandbox and non-liner; from the infiltration of dense urban areas to the exploration of the bleak, hallucinogenic landscapes.

In every round, players acquire new cards into their agencies and activate abilities on cards they already own. In order to do this, players spend one of the limited set of Control Cards during every round. The player who creates the most developed Space Agency, builds the most impressive Laboratory and reaches the most remarkable breakthroughs wins the Space Race.<br/><br/>Space Race uses a simultaneous action selection mechanism at the beginning of every round, when players choose one of their remaining Control Cards that will determine which abilities players can use during the round. Every Control Card activates one of four possible stripes on cards and players can only use those abilities that are on the active stripe.

As in xiangqi, it is played on the vertices of the grid. The board is divided into two lang territories by a river in the middle of the board. The three files on one side of the board form the sea. The object of the game is to capture the opponent's Commander, or all units of a single division of the opponent's army.<br/><br/>The pieces on both sides, with their abbreviations, movements, and rules, are:<br/><br/><br/>     1 Commander (C): moves any distance orthogonally; captures 1 point orthogonally; may occupy Headquarters; may not &quot;see&quot; the opposing Commander on an open file<br/>     2 Infantry (In): 1 point orthogonally<br/>     2 Tanks (T): 2 points orthogonally; may capture on sea squares it cannot enter, remaining stationary; carries C, In, or M<br/>     1 Militia (M): 1 point orthogonally<br/>     2 Engineer (E): 1 point orthogonally; carries all pieces, only across river; controls airspace 1 point any direction<br/>     2 Artillery (A): 1&ndash;3 points any direction; crosses river only at reefs, by attacking, or carried<br/>     2 Anti-aircraft gun (Aa): 1 point orthogonally; may capture on sea squares it cannot enter; controls airspace 1 point any direction<br/>     1 Missile battery (Ms): 1&ndash;2 points orthogonally or 1 point diagonally; controls airspace as it moves<br/>     2 Air force (Af): 1&ndash;4 points any direction; may return to its departing point after capturing or carrying, unless capturing opposing Af; carries C, In, or M; destroyed immediately on passing through opposing airspace<br/>     2 Navy (N): 1-4 points any direction on sea, sea banks, and river banks; captures as it moves at sea; shoots 1&ndash;3 in any direction at land targets; controls airspace 1 point any direction<br/>     2 Headquarters (H): stationary and does not capture; may house only C; protects C, but not itself, from In, M, Aa, and Ms<br/><br/><br/>General rules:<br/><br/>     Pieces capture as they move, and never jump, unless noted.<br/>     Pieces can cross the river but not occupy sea points unless noted.<br/>     Pieces which check the opposing Commander are promoted, gaining special abilities.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>The Chinese xiangqi has generally been the most popular form of chess played in Vietnam. In fact, there is no traditional distinctively-Vietnamese chess game; which is partly what inspired C\u1edd t\u01b0 l\u1ec7nh.<br/><br/>C\u1edd t\u01b0 l\u1ec7nh is played on the vertices of an 11x12 &quot;geographic&quot; board similar to the 9x10 xiangqi board, with the addition of an ocean occupying files A&ndash;C and two &quot;reefs&quot; allowing all pieces to ford the river. It shares many features with wargames, including area denial, ranged attack, and unit cooperation.<br/><br/>Besides the fact that Vietnam has never had a distinctive regional form of chess, Nguy\u1ec5n noted four complaints with xiangqi influenced the creation of C\u1edd t\u01b0 l\u1ec7nh:<br/><br/>1. Xiangqi promotes individualism and class conflict, particularly in the willingness of players to sacrifice low-level pieces to succeed.<br/>2. Winning xiangqi is due more to luck than to intellect.<br/>3. Xiangqi does not reflect the geography and history of Vietnam.<br/>4. Xiangqi has many rule variantions, none of which are accepted by the entire community.<br/><br/>Each of these points is answered in C\u1edd t\u01b0 l\u1ec7nh:<br/><br/>1. Pieces cooperate through a &quot;carrying&quot; and area denial mechanics. As well, losing an entire class of piece loses the game, forcing protection of and cooperation among all classes.<br/>2. Nguy\u1ec5n believes the interactions between pieces and influence of geography necessitate more strategy and reduce the role of luck.<br/>3. Besides the single river of xiangqi, there is an ocean, as well as &quot;reefs&quot; across the river, all of which interact with special piece rules. Besides the Vietnam-like geography, the pieces modern rather than ancient military structure.<br/>4. By promoting C\u1edd t\u01b0 l\u1ec7nh educational programs, Nguy\u1ec5n hopes to ensure that a single authoritative set of rules is used by all players.<br/><br/>"}, "191204": {"image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3442230.jpg", "poll": [], "boardgamedesigner": ["Roger Vernon"], "statistics": [], "yearpublished": "0", "maxplayers": "4", "boardgameartist": ["Roger Vernon"], "boardgamepublisher": ["Denken Games"], "maxplaytime": "60", "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3442230_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "30", "boardgamecategory": ["Abstract Strategy", "Fantasy"], "description": "You are a power broker in a turbulent land where four clans battle for control.

The first set contains three decks - bugs, bots and beasts that can normally only combine with themselves unless a &quot;combine&quot; card is used to cross the gene pools. Original Artwork from Tang Mu though templates are provided to go make your own sets and fight! Files are available for Print 'n' Play or laser cutting your own set.<br/><br/>With a starting hand of 7 tiles, players have 3 actions per turn, picking up, playing or attacking (can repeat the same action more than once to get to three) A monster can only be started with a head section and can only attack when it is completed with a tail. As many body tiles can be played in between these two providing that the symbols on the sides match (combine tiles come into play here). Each tile adds different features to the monster - a red dot/explosion means another d6 is added to the attack pool and a shield with a number in it is a hit point that can only be destroyed by an attack die with a number equal or higher than it. If all the hit points on a tile are destroyed then that tile is taken off the monster and put back into the bag. Players also have three hit points of their own health and are removed from the game when they are destroyed (they can choose which monster defends the attack or can take the damage themselves to keep their precious creations safe)<br/><br/>For extra silliness, when attacking the player has to shout the entire name of their monster (each tile has a portion on the side of it) leading to absurd and often hilarious monsters weighing into battle.<br/><br/>Greebles is published with a Creative Commons Attribution Non-commercial share alike licence as the creator is a great fan of collaboration. It was partly inspired by the drawing game consequences (or exquisite corpses if you went to art school :p) where a piece of paper is folded multiple times with a segment on a body drawn on each and then folded before passing to the next person so the final monster is only revealed when the paper is unfurled. There are blank templates available for the creation of your own sets and the author is planning on releasing official expansion packs as a way of showcasing other illustrators and ideas.

Trade shrewdly at the local marketplace to increase the value of your collection.

A devastating sandstorm can throw your expedition into disarray, and cunning thieves lurk around the dig site ready to steal your prize discovery!<br/><br/>In Archaeology: The New Expedition, you want to find treasures and make the most money possible by selling them to the museum.

If they find treasure, they don't show anyone and keep it; if they find a thief, they steal a card at random from an opponent; and if they find a sandstorm, all players lose half of their cards in hand to the marketplace, which starts the game with five face-up cards. (Each player has a tent that they can discard to avoid the effects of one sandstorm.) After digging, a player can:<br/><br/><br/>     Discard one or more maps to explore one chamber of the monument, looking at all the cards there and keeping some number of them.<br/><br/><br/><br/>     Trade at the marketplace by laying down one or more treasure cards and picking up cards with equal or lesser trading value.<br/><br/><br/><br/>     Sell to the museum by placing sets of treasure cards in front of them; in general, the more cards you have of a type, the more the set is worth.<br/><br/><br/>Players can explore only once, but they can do the other actions repeatedly, and they can take these actions in any order.

Get into teams of 2. <br/>Sort the cards: Team Locations come in sets of 6, such as the Omi Mint. You will play with one set per team, plus one extra. Choose which sets you will play with, and put any others aside.<br/>Sort the cards into 3 decks for Round 1, 2, and 3, as shown on the back of the card. Place all the cards for the current Round face up on the table.<br/>Coin reward = Number on bronze coin + Number in black box. (No bonus.)<br/>Teamwork: If an Active Ninja targets his teammate&rsquo;s locked Hourglasses with a Fortune, he can use the Fortune to remove one Hourglass (the Fortune can&rsquo;t be used for anything else that roll). You can revive a ninja who has run out of time.<br/>Once on your turn, you may give a Skill Die to your partner. They can&rsquo;t give it back and they can&rsquo;t lend you one afterwards.

(Hourglasses still lock to chosen ninja.)<br/>Your Team&rsquo;s Turn: Choose a pair of Locations from the same set. (You do not need to choose the same set each Round.) You will try to defeat one Location Card while your partner tries to defeat the other. Roll the number of House Dice in the black box and add the icons and rules on the card to create your House.You each roll Skill Dice simultaneously, but keep them separate. Skill Dice you roll only count towards your House. <br/>Your partner can choose not to roll while you roll.You can keep rolling if your partner is out of time.<br/><br/>Not Your Turn: Choose an Active Ninja to roll against; your Hourglasses don&rsquo;t affect the other Active Ninja this turn. Roll Threat Dice each time your chosen Active Ninjas rolls Skill Dice.<br/>If there is more than one Inactive team, ninjas on the same team have to be on the same location. If you&rsquo;re the only one rolling against an Active Ninja, roll an additional Threat Die (not a Kage Die).<br/>Ending Your Turn: Both ninjas must run away or collect coin rewards at the same time.

The game starts so that everyone has one on the board, then a special die is rolled. If you get 1, 2 or 3 you put your other pawn on the board - now you are on the move. But beware, as your moves always affect your next move as well. The basic idea is that you always move by putting the pawn that is behind in the exact opposite spot (called &quot;A&quot;-spot) in front of the other pawn. You do however roll the die on each turn and that tells you how many grid points you can deviate from the &quot;A&quot; spot (from 0-3). Deviating sideways represents steering while deviating the two pawns closer or further apart represents deceleration and acceleration. Thus, the two pawns form a vector which represents the car's speed and it goes without saying that if you approach a tight curve with a too long vector (=too high speed) you won't be able to make it within the possible die results, but will crash out of the track. Crashing will cause you to pass a number of turns equal to your speed, which is doubled if the crash happened in a particularly difficult spot, as marked on the board. Rolling a &quot;NO&quot; will force you to pass the turn while rolling a &quot;FREE&quot; gives you an extra turn. Rolling 0 means that the car simply keeps it speed and direction for that turn (with possibly disastrous results if it happens many times in a row).<br/><br/>Hitting a green spot on the track causes you to pick a Turbo card (good) while hitting one of the more plentiful yellow spots means a Danger card (bad, surprisingly). Hitting one of the red spots gives you a free move, which is somewhat limited by the blue lines that divide the track into shorter &quot;race areas&quot;.<br/><br/>After a pre-agreed number of laps, the winner is the player who first manages to cross the finish line AND bring their car to a controlled full stop.<br/><br/>The game promises to give &quot;a surprisingly realistic feel of racing&quot;.<br/><br/>The game comes with the basic track of Monza.

The player with the most accusations is put on trial to try to prove their innocence. If you can't convince the town, you are lynched at the gallows.<br/>    <br/>The game ends when one side remains.<br/><br/>You can also change the roles you play with to make the game more challenging and more fun.<br/><br/>The game is really easy to play and kid friendly but hard to master.<br/><br/>With 20 unique roles, every game is a new experience.<br/>    <br/>You have to decide who to trust and who to lynch in order to survive.<br/><br/>More about phases:<br/>The Day Phase is split up into 4 smaller phases. The Discussion Phase, the Voting Phase, the Defense Phase, and the Judgement Phase.<br/><br/>Discussion: Discussion time can be timed or not, depends more on the party(House Rules, 10 minutes is a good starting time, with 30 seconds less for each player eliminated). After discussion ends, or once you have decided you would like to vote as a group voting phase starts.<br/><br/>Voting: Voting time can be timed or not, and you vote on whoever you think is bad(Many ways to do this, again house rules, you can write a note to the mod, raise hands, or thumbs up or down. You can do it in 321 fashion, or just ask if everyone is done voting.) The player, or players voted up now stand trial, and must defend themselves to the Town.<br/><br/>Defense: Defense time may be timed or not, but a standard time of 2 minutes seems to be enough. No one may talk while the player is defending himself, and once he is finished with his defense judgement starts without more discussion.<br/><br/>Judgement: the Judgment phase may or may not be timed. The players not standing trial vote whether the player standing trial is guilty, or innocent(If you are using the vote two players up variant, then one is chosen to be lynched). If a player is voted guilty, that player is lynched, they reveal their role, and the next night begins<br/><br/>Night<br/>The night phase starts with the Moderator telling players to go to sleep(close their eyes). The Moderator will then call upon every role with a night action to perform said action. The first night has some special conditions such as the Moderator must tell the Executioner his target if he is game, and every role that can be found Evil(that is known) must be called before the Sheriff. The night phase ends when all actions are taken, and the Day begins again.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "4", "boardgameversion": ["First edition"], "average": "7.5", "name": "Town of Salem: The Card Game", "videogamebg": ["Town of Salem"], "playingtime": "0", "boardgamemechanic": ["Voting"], "age": "8", "usersrated": "17", "boardgamefamily": ["Admin: Unreleased Games", "Werewolf / Mafia"]}, "191433": {"poll": [], "name": "Zumba Fitness: World Party", "videogamemode": ["Local Multiplayer"], "videogameversion": ["North American Wii edition"], "average": "0", "videogameseries": ["Zumba Fitness"], "videogametheme": ["Sports - Cue Sports"], "videogamefranchise": ["Zumba Fitness"], "videogamedeveloper": ["Zo\u00eb Mode"], "videogamegenre": ["Fitness", "Sports"], "videogameplatform": ["Wii"], "usersrated": "0", "statistics": [], "videogamepublisher": ["Majesco Entertainment"], "description": "Players can learn different dance styles from around the world including Salsa, Hip-Hop, Tahitian, Calypso, Bollywood, Cumbia, Reggaeton and Irish Step, plus new additions like Plena, Blues, Capoeira and Girly Funk.<br/>Explore the globe in the new World Tour mode that unlocks songs from seven global destinations as you progress, exposing you to authentic customs, local rhythms and native dance styles.<br/>Two-player support on Xbox One and Kinect for Xbox 360, and four-player support on Wii U and Wii let you play together with friends and family members in cooperative play.<br/>Set personal fitness goals or work toward pre-set goals to unlock bonus rewards and fitness tips.<br/>Enhance your workout with the streamlined Progress Tracker Plus that tallies all of your stats: technique score, calories burned, goals met, etc.<br/>Unlock motivational rewards as you explore the globe: behind-the-scenes videos, passport stamps, postcards, souvenirs, fitness tips and achievements.<br/>Flaunt your fitness in up to 45 pre-set classes or customize your own workout.<br/>Accessible gameplay features Low, Medium and High Intensity routines tiered for all skill levels plus an expanded Tutorial mode.<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;Zumba Fitness: World Party&quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "191434": {"poll": [], "name": "Zumba Kids", "videogamemode": ["Local Multiplayer", "Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["North American Wii edition"], "average": "0", "videogametheme": ["Sports - Cue Sports"], "videogamefranchise": ["Zumba Fitness"], "videogamedeveloper": ["Zo\u00eb Mode"], "videogamegenre": ["Fitness", "Sports"], "videogameplatform": ["Wii"], "usersrated": "0", "statistics": [], "videogamepublisher": ["Majesco Entertainment"], "description": "Players can learn different dance styles as well as new routines including the Brazilian Funk, Polynesian, Celtic Bluegrass, Jive, Axe, Jazz, African and Disco.

In each round, players are dealt a hand of cards &mdash; one card in the first round, two cards in the second, three in the third, etc. &mdash; then trump is determined by flipping the top card of the undealt deck; if a suit is revealed, that suit is trump, while if a Wizard or Jester (or no card in the final round) is revealed, then the round has no trump. Players then state how many tricks they expect to win in the round.<br/><br/>The playing and winning of the tricks uses mostly standard trick-taking rules. If a player leads a suited card, then all other players must follow suit, if possible. If a player leads a Jester, then the second player determines the suit led. If a player leads a Wizard, then those who follow can play whatever they want. However, in all cases a player may always play a Wizard or Jester, even if they hold cards in the suit led.<br/><br/>After each player has played a card, determine the winner of the trick as follows: If one or more Wizards were played, the player of the first Wizard wins the trick, collects the cards, and leads to the next trick. If not, whoever played the highest trump wins the trick. If not, whoever played the highest card of the suit led wins the trick. If all players played Jesters, whoever played the first Jester wins.<br/><br/>After all tricks have been played, players tally their score for the round. If a player matched their bid, winning exactly as many tricks as stated at the start of the round, they score 20 points, plus 10 points for each trick taken. If a player missed their bid, they lose 10 points for each trick that they were off, whether they took more or fewer than predicted.<br/><br/>A common variant in Wizard is to not allow the total number of tricks bid in a round to match the round number, thereby forcing (at least) one player to be off each round.<br/><br/>Wizard: 20th Jubil&auml;umsedition is a special edition of Wizard that includes six cards not present in the normal game, including a single dragon card that beats a Wizard, a four-colored 7-1/2 Juggler card, and a bomb card that negates the bids for the round, with players then scoring points based on the total number of tricks they take.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "3", "boardgameversion": ["German first edition"], "name": "Wizard: Jubil\u00e4umsedition", "playingtime": "45", "boardgamemechanic": ["Hand Management", "Trick-taking"], "average": "7.51726", "usersrated": "47", "age": "10"}, "191476": {"poll": [], "name": "Capital Combat", "playingtime": "30", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": ["Campaign / Battle Card Driven", "Card Drafting", "Deck / Pool Building", "Dice Rolling", "Hand Management", "Partnerships", "Pattern Building", "Pattern Recognition", "Player Elimination", "Set Collection", "Simulation"], "yearpublished": "2015", "usersrated": "0", "maxplayers": "4", "average": "0", "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["The Game Crafter, LLC"], "boardgameversion": ["Version 44"], "maxplaytime": "30", "boardgamecategory": ["Abstract Strategy", "Aviation / Flight", "Card Game", "Dice", "Economic", "Math", "Modern Warfare", "Nautical", "Transportation", "Wargame"], "age": "6", "minplaytime": "15", "description": "What does it take to run a successful modern battle machine?
