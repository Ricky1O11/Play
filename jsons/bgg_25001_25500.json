While little is taught in today's classrooms about the war, this modern day David and Goliath story is still forming the world we live in.<br/><br/>In May of 1967, after a 10 year buildup of Arab military force in Sinai, Egyptian president Gamal Abdel Nasser amassed the armies of Egypt, Syria, and Jordan on the borders of Israel. By the end of that same month, Egypt engaged in the first official military action of the 6-day war by declaring a naval blockade against the nation of Israel. After concentrating an enormous Arab amphibious assault force just 17km from the coast of Israel, Nasser ominously proclaimed, &quot;The armies of Egypt, Jordan, Syria and Lebanon are poised on the borders of Israel...to face the challenge, while standing behind us are the armies of Iraq, Algeria, Kuwait, Sudan and the whole Arab nation. This act will astound the world. Today they will know that the Arabs are arranged for battle, the critical hour has arrived. We have reached the stage of serious action and not declarations.&quot;<br/><br/>Echoing these sentiments, the Iraqi President Abdur Rahman Aref boldly declared, &quot;The existence of Israel is an error which must be rectified. This is our opportunity to wipe out the ignominy that has been with us since 1948. Our goal is clear: 'to wipe Israel off the map'.&quot;<br/><br/>But Israel refused to go quietly into the night. On June 5th, 1967, the Israeli Air Force launched a pre-emptive attack against Egyptian airfields full of bombers, poised for the assault.

Each leader harbored deep doubts as to the loyalty of his units - for good reason. Several daimyo refused to fight; some even turned sides in the midst of battle.<br/><br/>To conquer Japan you must do more than field an army - you must be sure it will follow you into combat. Cultivate the loyalty of your allies and deploy them only when you are confident of their allegiance. Win a battle by gaining a defection from the ranks of your opponent.<br/><br/>Sekigahara is replete with unusual mechanics:<br/><br/>        No dice are used<br/>        Cards represent loyalty and motivation. Without a matching card, an army will not enter battle.<br/>        Allegiance is represented by hand size, which fluctuates each turn.<br/>        Battles are a series of deployments, from hidden unit stacks, based on hidden loyalty factors. Loyalty Challenge cards create potential defection events.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Sekigahara is a 3-hour block game based on the Japanese campaign waged in 1600. The 7-week war, fought along Japan's two major highways and in scattered sieges and backcountry skirmishes, elevated Tokugawa Ieyasu to Shogun and unified Japan for 265 years.<br/><br/>Sekigahara is designed to offer an historically authentic experience within an intuitive game mechanic that can be played in one sitting. Great effort has been taken to preserve a clean game mechanism. (Despite a healthy amount of historical detail, the ruleset is a brief 6 pages.) Chance takes the form of uncertainty and not luck.<br/><br/>No dice are used; combat is decided with cards. Blocks = armies and cards = motivation. The combination of army and motivation produces impact on the battlefield. Armies without matching cards don't fight. Battles resolve quickly, but with suspense, tactical participation, and a wide range of possible outcomes.<br/><br/>Legitimacy is represented by hand size, which fluctuates each week according to the number of castles a player holds. Certain events deplete legitimacy, like force marches and lost battles. Recruitment, meanwhile, is a function of a daimyo's control over key production areas. Objectives (enemy units, castles, resources) exist all over the map.<br/><br/>The initial setup is variable, so the situation is always fresh. Concealed information (blocks and cards) lends additional uncertainty. In this way the game feels like the actual campaign.<br/><br/>Blocks are large and stackable. Every unit on the board is visible at once, and the strategic situation is comprehensible at a glance. Components use authentic clan designations and colors, and have a Japanese feel.<br/><br/>True to history, the objectives (castles and economic centers) and forces (armies of allied daimyo) are dispersed. Support for one front means neglect for another. The player is pulled between competing priorities. Each side wonders where his opponent wants to fight, and where he is unready. There is a great deal of bluff in the game.<br/><br/>Each player must rally the several daimyo of his coalition, managing the morale and motivation of each clan. The forces are dispersed, and while there are reasons to unify them, the objectives are also dispersed, and the timeframe compact, so skirmishing will occur all over the island.<br/><br/>TIME SCALE     2 weeks per turn<br/>MAP SCALE     Point to point<br/>UNIT SCALE     One block = 5000 soldiers<br/>NUMBER OF PLAYERS     2<br/><br/>COMPONENTS<br/>    Mounted Map<br/>    119 wooden pieces<br/>    1 and 1/2 sticker sheets<br/>    110 cards<br/>    Rulebook<br/>    Two player aid cards<br/><br/>DESIGNER: Matthew Calkins<br/>MAP &amp; BLOCK ART: Mark Mahaffey<br/><br/>(source: GMT website)<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": {"98724": "First edition"}, "average": "8.05804", "name": "Sekigahara: The Unification of Japan", "playingtime": "180", "boardgamemechanic": {"2040": "Hand Management"}, "age": "12", "usersrated": "2424", "boardgameaccessory": {"144294": "Sekigahara 3-inch Game Box"}, "boardgamesubdomain": {"4664": "Wargames"}, "boardgamefamily": {"9470": "Asian Theme"}}, "25022": {"boardgamedesigner": {"3": {"name": "(Uncredited)"}}, "poll": {}, "name": "Jurassic Dinosaurs", "playingtime": "30", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": {"2035": "Roll / Spin and Move"}, "yearpublished": "1993", "usersrated": "2", "boardgamefamily": {"7559": "Animals: Dinosaurs"}, "maxplayers": "4", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic141152_t.jpg", "average": "2", "statistics": {}, "boardgamepublisher": {"5820": {"name": "Legends"}}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic141152.jpg", "maxplaytime": "30", "boardgamecategory": {"1089": {"name": "Animals"}}, "age": "6", "minplaytime": "30", "description": "Summary from the box:<br/>The race is on!

Not much later, they all descend on an unspoiled planet which they call Laura-2. The land grab and inter-tribal bickering starts as soon they settle into, and on to, their new home.<br/><br/>A simple abstract placement game for 2-6 players that is played in two phases. In the first phase players scatter their 18 tribe members and 2 item counters (a throne and a private saucer) on to the circular planet's surface. In the second phase the Lauranians will swap places until one tribe manages to get all family members unified into one single group that includes their own flying saucer and chief's throne.<br/><br/>In the settling phase, the first player places one counter in the defined central area of the board, and each subsequent player places one more settler as the previous player next to other Lauranians on the board, until all counters have disembarked. In this phase, no tribes may form a family group larger than 4.<br/><br/>In the relocation phase, in turn, each player will swap two tiles as long as they contain one own family member and the 2 tiles are lying in a straight line on the board. But a family member that is part of the tribe leader's group, including the tribe leader, can only be prized away by swapping it with another tribe leader. When you move your tribe leader more than once, you unnerve the other families, and each other tribe leader will see one of their own people take shelter under the tribe leader's throne, making it much easier for them to keep their family together.<br/><br/>The flying saucer can be used for one of two special moves that replaces the normal swap-2-tiles turn. One is to lift it up and move it in a straight line to land on an empty space besides a friendly tribe member. The other is to beam a family member in a straight line  on to an empty field besides the saucer.<br/><br/>Throughout the game, no move is allowed that would leave the entire Lauranian split into two groups at the end of a turn.<br/><br/>Publication history: this game appeared in Spielbox magazine (2/1984 apr-jun), as one of the earlier entrants in the &quot;Spiel zum Herausnehmen/Game to Remove&quot; series.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": {"21459": "Spielbox edition"}, "name": "Laura-2", "playingtime": "30", "boardgamemechanic": {"2026": "Hex-and-Counter"}, "average": "5.5", "usersrated": "1", "boardgamesubdomain": {"4666": "Abstract Games"}, "boardgamefamily": {"135": "Spielbox"}}, "25068": {"boardgamedesigner": {"28393": {"name": "Istv\u00e1n v.

Each radar is surrounded by three rings, marked 1 (=inner) to 3 (=outer), and each radar zone is divided into 6 pie-parts, except for the central radar zone, which has 12 pie-parts. The radars themselves are small dots at the center of each zone. The outer 6 radars each have 2 pie-bits connected to a neighbor. One movable radar beam is placed on each station, covering a sixth of each circular area, and a beam half that size is  placed in the central zone. Each player takes ownership of an equal amount of outer radar posts, and gets a small squadrons in the same color. These are then placed on the starting fields on the outer edge of the board, just outside their own radar post zone.<br/><br/>Using dice, 2-6 players try to keep their fleet of planes under the radar, and the first one to sneak 3 planes of one color into the center zone is the winning commander.<br/><br/>In turn, players will first move the radar beam at their own station forwards. The beam speed depends on the activity within the zone. Any planes that get caught by the sweeping beam have to abort their attempt to reach the center, and return to their start location to start another approach.<br/><br/>After that, the planes move, by rolling 4 dice. Planes are under no obligation to move, but when a die gets allocated to a plane, the entire move has to be made. Planes start on the outer rim and move, avoiding the area covered by the radar beam, clockwise or anti-clockwise, along the ring it is currently occupying. However, in the pie-part that touches its neighbor, planes have an opportunity to &quot;flop&quot; radar stations instead of continuing on their current track. When they do flop, they move their plane to the other station's pie-part, but place the plane one ring closer to that's station's radar than the one they just left.<br/><br/>When a plane leaves the most central track and flops right on top of a neighboring radar, called the blitz-field, that plane is then immediately moved to the outer ring of the central radar, which is surrounded by 2 rings. Each subsequent plane of that color that manages to make it to the central zone undetected, arrives one ring closer to its center.

Each player starts at level 1 and the winner is the first player to reach level 10. Players can acquire familiar D&amp;D style character classes during the game which determine to some extent the cards they can play.<br/><br/>There are two types of cards - treasure and encounters. Each turn the current players 'kicks down the door' - drawing an encounter card from the deck. Usually this will involve battling a monster. Monsters have their own levels and players must try and overcome it using the levels, weapons and powers they have acquired during the game or run away. Other players can chose to help the player or hinder by adding extra monsters to the encounter. Defeating a monster will usually result in drawing treasure cards and acquiring levels. Being defeated by a monster results in &quot;bad stuff&quot; which usually involves losing levels and treasure.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "3", "boardgameversion": {"263765": "Brazilian First edition"}, "average": "6.2788", "name": "Munchkin Cthulhu", "playingtime": "90", "boardgamemechanic": {"2072": "Dice Rolling"}, "age": "10", "boardgameexpansion": {}, "usersrated": "3972", "boardgameaccessory": {"187880": "Munchkin: Blank Cards"}, "boardgamesubdomain": {"5496": "Thematic Games"}, "boardgamefamily": {"5141": "Cthulhu Mythos"}}, "25072": {"boardgamedesigner": {"3": {"name": "(Uncredited)"}}, "poll": {}, "name": "Strategy Golf", "playingtime": "45", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": {"2040": "Hand Management"}, "yearpublished": "1990", "usersrated": "5", "boardgamefamily": {"5652": "Sports: Golf"}, "maxplayers": "4", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic573726_t.jpg", "average": "5.2", "statistics": {}, "boardgamepublisher": {"5838": {"name": "Strategy Golf Inc."}}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic573726.jpg", "maxplaytime": "45", "boardgamecategory": {"1104": {"name": "Math"}}, "age": "0", "minplaytime": "45", "description": "From the back of the box:<br/><br/>Love to play cards?

When a rendezvous takes place, the visiting player needs to guess the local way to say &quot;hi&quot;, which is made through a sequence of gestures and salutations, 4 in all. Depending on how accurate a player's greeting is, that player will receive a gift, which gives a clue to how close the attempt was to the real McCoy. The question is, which mastermind can deduct all the secret alien handshakes?<br/><br/>The board shows six solar systems arranged in a circle. A seventh solar system is placed at the center of this. Each solar system has 13 planets orbiting a sun, in 3 orbits. Where solar systems touch each other, there are planets facing each other on the outer ring, creating places where UFOs can hop between systems. With the exception of the central system, each solar system has one distinctive home planet. There are unique 24 handshake cards, grouped in 4 sets of 6. Each player gets 5 gift counters.<br/><br/>At the start of the game, each player picks a home planet and places the two flying saucers on it. All players then get their unique 4 part hand-shake sequence, which gets written down on a private note sheet. Unused cards are exposed, so players can cross them off as possible candidates. Each player then allocates the values 0-4 to their 5 gifts, which is also written down on the sheet and kept hidden from opponents.<br/><br/>In turn, players can allocate between 1 and 4 movement points to their 2 UFO's, in any way they see fit. UFO's move clockwise from planet to planet, and are allowed to change orbit, and even solar system. Each planet offers room for only 2 UFO's though, and these have to belong to different players too. When 2 UFO's meet on the same planet, a rendezvous takes place.<br/><br/>The arriving player takes a guess (aloud) at the correct greeting sequence of the other alien. Depending the amount of correctly guessed elements, the alien will return a gift to this player. This gift has the same value as the amount of correct guesses, but what that value is, is another thing that has to be deduced by the other players. When a player has already handed over the gift with that value, the visiting player will be told that no gift can be made. All this information is available to all players.<br/><br/>Landing on another player's home planet opens up another opportunity to get that player to reveal another clue. When a player gives back a gift previously obtained from that tribe, the owner of the home planet must return a greeting that has the same value as the returned gift, but also one that has not been made before.<br/><br/>A players cannot establish a rendezvous between the same two spaceships in 2 subsequent turns, and must leave a solar system before another landing on the same home planet may be made.<br/><br/>When a player greets all other players with the correct salutations, than that player is the winner. You're only allowed one guess though, so don't expect it to be made fast.<br/><br/>This is a great addition to the deduction genre, sitting comfortably next to Cluedo and Mastermind, despite lower production values. With each additional player, game length increases a bit, and an alternative victory condition, guessing only the handshake of the players on your immediate left and right, is suggested for 5 and 6 player games. Where most of these games use indicators that give players direct clues about the accuracy of a guess (for instance, a red peg is a correct guess but not in its right place), here the added complication is that the true meaning of these pegs (the gifts) must also be established, setting player's quite a puzzling logic challenge.<br/><br/>Publication history: this game appeared in Spielbox magazine (1/1985 feb-mar), as one of the earlier entrants in the &quot;Spiel zum Herausnehmen/Game to Remove&quot; series.

Combat involves a series of formulas taking in as many factors as possible including number and training of troops, armor, troop types, leaders, weather, terrain, and other factors.  This results in a modified strength of each force.  When these are compared the relative strength determine losses for each side as well as the victor in the battle. <br/>  The rules come in two books, a Player's Manual and The Realm Controller's Manual.<br/><br/>"}, "25110": {"boardgamedesigner": {"3": {"name": "(Uncredited)"}}, "poll": {}, "name": "Team Out!

There are pawns in four colors, but players do not lay claim to them.  Instead, the players play cards capable of moving one of the pawns forward along the paths.  The paths diverge often, giving players a chance to send pawns on longer routes or to get them back onto shorter routes.  Getting a pawn to certain spaces rewards the player who moved it with gold, diamonds or additional cards (randomly assigned by face-down &quot;stepping-stone&quot; markers).<br/><br/>Once a player moves a pawn onto the temple, the end-zone of the path, the first round ends.  That player gets 1 diamond.<br/><br/>Next, the players are rewarded and/or penalized for the cards left in their hands, based on the zone the pawns have ended in.  A card for the pawn in the end zone (the one that ended the round) earns +3 gold, +2 for pawns in the second zone, +1 for those in the third, 0 for those in the fourth and -1 for those in the fifth.<br/><br/>Now the board is flipped to the second side and a similar adventure embarked upon.  This second side has an additional feature: bridges that are destroyed after crossing, further complicating the choices about divergent paths.  At the end of the second side, when a pawn reaches the goal, diamonds are counted and the player with the most diamonds gets 12 gold and second-most gets 6 gold.  Cards remaining in hand are again paid off according to the zone the pawn of that color finished in.

Too many of these game systems require an excessive amount of log keeping and the use of overly long sets of tables. A need for referees and a lot of pencil pushing detracts from the enjoyment of the game.<br/><br/>The other problem with many fantasy rules is that they bear little relation to the literary fantasy tradition. These games tend to rely upon vast numbers of omnipotent beings and spell-casting wizards rather than the strategic capabilities of a kingdom's legions of ordinary soldiers.<br/><br/>Archworld is intended to provide a reasonable and easy-to-understand accounting of the uses of weapons and armor of the period, and the strategy of empire making and the like. The gamer who is not interested in the re-fighting of Archworld battles may simply disregard the fantasy elements and still use these rules to create realistic battle situations for any period up to the late 1600s.<br/><br/>Bases and Scale:<br/><br/>Scales is given in terms of paces, with one real inch equaling ten paces, one scale pace equals 2 1/2 feet (or 1 mm. equals 1 foot). All movement and the proper sizes of bases can be worked our from this scale. As a rule, one figure equals twenty men, except in the case of personality figures, which obviously are one to one.<br/><br/>Archworld also contains a complete set of rules for naval combat.<br/><br/>Archworld also includes a 4 panel paper foldout map of Archworld, 3 single sided sheets of cardboard ship cutouts (these are not counters-the cut outs of the ships are much larger and are used for naval miniatures combat), and 2 single sided cardstock sheets of reference charts.<br/><br/>"}, "25162": {"boardgamedesigner": {"6366": {"name": "George Schimpf"}}, "poll": {}, "name": "The Little Mermaid Under the Sea Card Game", "playingtime": "15", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": {"2048": "Pattern Building"}, "yearpublished": "2006", "usersrated": "2", "boardgamefamily": {"28829": "Celebrities: Hans Christian Andersen"}, "maxplayers": "4", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic142462_t.jpg", "average": "5.5", "statistics": {}, "boardgamepublisher": {"1349": {"name": "Briarpatch"}}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic142462.jpg", "boardgameversion": {"176238": "Briarpatch Disney Princess Limited Edition"}, "maxplaytime": "15", "boardgamecategory": {"1002": {"name": "Card Game"}}, "age": "3", "minplaytime": "15", "description": "This is a pattern recognition and matching game with a theme from the Disney The Little Mermaid film.

The Tour was opposed by a coalition of anti-racist groups in New Zealand. The result was a watershed in NZ politics, as the previously peaceful and harmonious country was bitterly divided by the violence that resulted from the confrontation between these opposing elements. In particular, the NZ Police force emerged without its previous positive image as an agent of fairness and social cohesion.<br/><br/>The name &ldquo;Political Football&rdquo; is a play on the common expression in NZ and elsewhere, where a contentious issue may be referred to in this way, particularly where the original problem has a non-political nature but when there may be an element of political opportunism apparent. In the case of the Rugby Tour, as well as being literally descriptive, there was an element of cynicism readily evident in the controversy.<br/><br/>The Game<br/><br/>Game Play is generally intuitive, and the number of Counters ( total 21 only) means play is readily comprehensible as well as fast moving. There are no dice, but some small randomness in the appearance of some features earlier or later. There is only one &ldquo;scenario&rdquo; and the whole Game must be played to determine a winner. Time for whole Game is about 2 hours<br/><br/>The Game has four protagonists<br/>1. The Demonstrators, who seek to disrupt the Tour to the extent that it must be abandoned<br/>2. The Rugby groups, who seek to complete the scheduled Tour.<br/>3. The Police, who seek to allow the Rugby to conduct their lawful business of playing Rugby<br/>4. The Government, which manipulates the other Players, seeking to extract maximum political advantage from a Law &amp; Order issue<br/><br/>Everybody except the Government has an inventory of Counters, which are able to move about the board under a movement allowance system, interacting with opposing counters. Players also have a suite of Action Cards which allow certain Actions to be played. Government uses its Turn to play certain cards influencing the other Players.<br/><br/>The Board is a stylized representation of <br/>&amp;#61623; four Sports Grounds, where the Rugby matches are scheduled ; <br/>&amp;#61623; a Court, where arrested demonstrators are processed;  <br/>&amp;#61623; a Hospital, where &ldquo;injured&rdquo; Counters wait till released by Government. <br/>&amp;#61623; between these venues, a gridded surface of &ldquo;streets&rdquo;, across which the Counters move from place to place. Only one Counter is allowed on any one square; counters cannot &ldquo;jump&rdquo; other counters.<br/><br/>The Tactics of the Game involve each Player trying to <br/>a. achieve certain mandatory objectives ( eg Rugby fielding sufficient Counters at the same time and place to actually play a match !).<br/>b. prevent Opposing Players establishing themselves in such a way as to frustrate opposition objectives.<br/><br/>Progress is measured and the Game won, by accumulation of Points for performing certain Actions ( eg for Rugby ,&ldquo;Play the Match&rdquo;; for Demonstrators &ldquo; Destroy the Goal posts&rdquo; or &ldquo;Confront Police&rdquo;).<br/><br/>In short, each Player can ( and must) adopt a mix of Offensive and Defensive play.<br/>In general, all Counters can &ldquo;bash&rdquo; all other counters, putting them out of action for an extended but indeterminable time; while the Police have the power to arrest Demonstrators, removing them (briefly) from play. All counters can be also used to form defensive &ldquo;walls&rdquo;, preventing opponents from achieving their objectives (eg preventing Rugby Counters from getting to the Sports ground to play their game&hellip;).<br/><br/>These tactics will be familiar to anyone who has ever attended a political demonstration, particularly a violent one.<br/><br/>This Game has a number of very interesting features :<br/>1. the protagonists are a-symmetrical in numbers, capacities and objectives yet play is finely balanced,<br/>2.  Both the Police and Rugby lose Points by attacking Demonstrators, but may lose more by NOT doing so!<br/>3. While the non-Demonstrator Players have mutual interests, these are NOT identical &ndash; leading to subtle conflicts that preclude any lasting alliance.<br/>4. The result see-saws wildly throughout the Game<br/>5. Novice Players learn rapidly how their tactics need to change<br/>6. No Player is ever permanently eliminated, which upsets novices !<br/>7. Players offensive capacities are governed by non-recurring Action Cards : when to use them is a matter of judging opportunity.<br/>8. Play often appears counter-intuitive to novices, but in fact is an accurate simulation of this particular variety of conflict, ie the maintenance of Law &amp; Order in a democratic society where Police powers are limited by Human Rights considerations. Playing the Game itself demonstrates these principles powerfully.<br/><br/>In summary, this is a unique and workable game system that provides for very subtle calculations of both short term tactics as well as longer term objectives, within a simple set of rules.<br/><br/>"}, "25167": {"boardgamedesigner": {"6503": {"name": "Jung Je Ho"}}, "average": "5.18987", "poll": {}, "name": "Project Skyline", "playingtime": "45", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": {"2072": "Dice Rolling"}, "yearpublished": "2004", "usersrated": "79", "maxplayers": "4", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic147375_t.jpg", "boardgameartist": {"22496": "Hans-J\u00f6rg Brehm"}, "statistics": {}, "boardgamepublisher": {"8": {"name": "AMIGO Spiel + Freizeit GmbH"}}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic147375.jpg", "boardgameversion": {"91549": "Amigo German first edition"}, "maxplaytime": "45", "boardgamecategory": {"1029": {"name": "City Building"}}, "age": "10", "minplaytime": "45", "description": "Project Skyline allows players to play as big-time investors.

Each player, in their turn, chooses a card from their hand. A typical card will have three boxes at the bottom and in each box there will be a number. For example, the first box might say 8, the second box 7 and the third box +12. The first box is how many spaces you go up the track on the board. The second box is how many you go back, so, in my example, you go forward 8 and back 7 (a gain of 1 forward). The third box is the risk number.

Commerce was the source of its richness, because from all its territory countrymen, artisans and also adventurers brought to the city every kind of merchandise: weapons, ancient books, precious relics, and rare dragon eggs. In this city, you can buy and exchange everything. This made Hermagor famous and merchants came from afar to buy and sell all kinds of goods at the market. Some even undertook perilous adventures to acquire especially rare items. They criss-crossed this wealthy region, creating new paths and roads, adding markets to towns, but always with the aim to become the richest!<br/><br/>Set in the imaginary land of Hermagor, each player takes on the role of a merchant striving to be the wealthiest trader. While playing, they aim to acquire goods in the marketplace and then sell those goods profitably in the towns and villages across land of Hermagor. Players first gain access to goods tiles in the marketplace by placing their agents in proximity to the tiles they want.  Then the players move one agent across the map of Hermagor, visiting and selling goods in the towns requesting goods that match the tiles the player acquired in the marketplace.<br/><br/>Hermagor is played in five rounds with two phases in each round.  Each round begins with the marketplace phase. Players pay to place their four agents in the market trying to control the goods tiles they will use in the second phase of the round.  Control of a tile goes to the player who has the most agents next to the tile.  Ties are broken by the priority of the adjacent locations.  Agents adjacent to the sides of a tile take priority over agents adjacent to the corner of tiles.  An agent placed on a tile has the highest priority.  After all agents have been placed and tiles claimed by the players, the marketplace agents also generate income.  Agents in the same row or column generate income at the rate of 1 for 1 agent, 3 for 2 agents, 6 for 3 agents, and 10 for 4 agents.  The price for placing agents depends on the location.  Locations that apply control to more tiles cost more.<br/><br/>Each round concludes with selling phase.  Players take turns moving one agent across the map of Hermagor, paying a price for each road segment they use so that they can sell goods in a town or village.  Importantly, each player may only sell in any town or village once during the game.  Players mark each town or village where they have sold goods with a house. Players receive a small monetary reward when other players sell in a town or village that the player has already sold in. Selling goods in all the towns or villages surrounding a region of the map defined by a set of roads potentially gives the player the right to a production facility in that region, supplying additional income immediately and at the end of the game.<br/><br/>Hermagor ends when the last player finishes his turn of the selling phase of the fifth round. End game bonus money is awarded for production facilities, most sales along the major road, and for the smallest of each players sales locations in each of the three Hermagor regions defined by its rivers.<br/><br/>The player with the most money at the end of the game wins.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": {"25238": "Mind the Move English first edition"}, "name": "Hermagor", "playingtime": "120", "boardgamemechanic": {"2080": "Area Control / Area Influence"}, "average": "6.93142", "usersrated": "1659", "boardgamesubdomain": {"5497": "Strategy Games"}, "age": "12"}, "25225": {"boardgamedesigner": {"3": {"name": "(Uncredited)"}}, "poll": {}, "name": "Soap Opera Challenge:  General Hospital", "playingtime": "0", "minplayers": "1", "boardgamemechanic": {"2072": "Dice Rolling"}, "yearpublished": "1987", "usersrated": "2", "maxplayers": "999", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic986039_t.png", "average": "3", "statistics": {}, "boardgamepublisher": {"468": {"name": "The United States Playing Card Company"}}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic986039.png", "boardgameversion": {"126302": "First Edition"}, "maxplaytime": "0", "boardgamecategory": {"1064": {"name": "Movies / TV / Radio theme"}}, "age": "12", "minplaytime": "0", "description": "[From back of card deck:]<br/><br/>&quot;Challenge yourself and your friends to remember great moments from General Hospital including the stormy marriage of Alan and Monica and the adventures of Anna, Duke and Scorpio.&quot;<br/><br/>This is a trivia game consisting of 54 cards and a &quot;drama die&quot;.

This allows players with DBx-based armies to play Hoplon with only minimum changes necessary.   <br/> Although designed for 15mm miniatures, the system also supports 25/28mm play.  Hoplon has been extensively play-tested in clubs and by members of a dedicated Yahoo group, and this testing has led to a number of revisions which have been incorporated into the third edition.<br/><br/>The philosophy behind Hoplon is to provide an easy-to-learn but deep system emphasizing the relative capabilities of different troop types and morale classes, the difficulties of effective command and control and -most of all - the close matching of historical tactics and performance.<br/><br/>In Hoplon, armies are separated into commands, and commands are separated into units. Troops are activated and controlled by means of command points. While single elements can function individually, they do so at a cost when detached from their parent formations, losing their unit's stamina, cohesion bonus, and ability to maneuver in groups. This in turn forces players to deal with the tactical control problems inherent in commanding large bodies of ancient and medieval troops. Sequence of play is by interleaved-Command (both players moving on the same round by order of initiative of their commands) rather than alternating on every round, which makes tactical decision-making all the more interesting.<br/><br/>While it uses a points system and army lists loosely based on the DBM model, Hoplon has taken a fresh approach to game-play which provides a realistic and historically satisfying simulation of ancient and medieval warfare.

First are the ORBS, which are circular pieces with red, yellow, green or blue in the center. The second type of pieces are ARCS, which have a stripe of color matching those of the orbs.  The arcs are 120 degrees in extension, so three arcs fit around an orb.  HALOS are the third piece type, and are either white or black.  They are rings which fit outside the orbs and arcs.  There are four orbs, four arcs and six halos of each color, made of plastic.<br/><br/>The orbs are set up on the 1 and 4 rows with the matching color arcs with those orbs.  Play consists of each player moving one orb one square horizontally, vertically or diagonally.  The matching color of arc MUST be then moved.  Arcs can move to any other legal square on the board.<br/><br/>The easiest way to win is to trap an opposing orb with three arcs of any color around it (an Arc-win).  If you can box in your opponents orbs so that he has no valid moves, then you have gained an Orb-win.  Finally, if you can move your four pieces inside four halos of your own color you have completed a halo win.  A draw is an option through player agreement or stalemate from repeated moves.<br/><br/>A halo is &quot;earned&quot; by moving three of your arcs so that they form a complete ring, with no orbs inside it.

One quarter of play was one complete pass through the 20 plays card deck. Thus, the deck would be gone through twice per half and 4 times to complete one game. The offensive player would select a play. The card would be turned over to reveal the results. Following the rules of football i.e., 4 downs to gain 10 yards, 4 quarters of play, etc.) the ball would move up and down the field based on the play called and the associated gain or loss in yardage on the card associated with the play called.

Unlike the traditional card game, the board game can only be played with two teams and therefore cannot be played by three players. Fortunately (and uniquely) this cribbage game can be played very well with six players forming two teams of three. Each team alternates play by placing a card on the board from their dealt hand. The board is a five by five grid with a face down card in the center revealed only after all cards are played. At the end of each round one team will score the cribbage &ldquo;hands&rdquo; that form the &ldquo;rows&rdquo; while the other team scores the cribbage &ldquo;hands&rdquo; that form the &ldquo;columns&rdquo;.  Every card placed will become a card in one of your cribbage &ldquo;hands&rdquo; on the board but will also be a card in one of your opponents &ldquo;hands&rdquo;. The trick therefore is to strategically place cards in such a way to help yourself but hinder your opponent. The board also has card values printed on some spots for instant scoring. Placing a queen on a spot on the board with a queen printed on it will score an instant two points - just as matching a pair during regular play would in a traditional cribbage game. Placing a five on the same queen spot would similarly score an instant two points for the fifteen. Final scoring is done after all spaces are filled using the same procedure one uses for a traditional cribbage hand. First team to 121 wins.

It is the middle of the 16th Century and young, ambitious noble families are reclaiming the dry hinterlands, building fields, forests, and lakes around their castles. Piece by piece - parcel by parcel - their holdings increase. Farmers work the fields, and in especially successful areas, monks found their influential cloisters. But everything happens under the watchful eyes of the nobility. Intrigues are hatched, tax collectors fleece the landowners, and far too often entire tracts of land are lost to locust plagues. Only he who keeps a cool head will become the Duke of Salamanca.<br/><br/>Through clever use of cards in hand, players obtain tiles for placement (buildings, landscapes, privileges) as well as the ability to carry out certain actions. The tiles obtained are placed on tactically important spaces on the game board. Players can also place ownership markers onto buildings. By cleverly placing landscape tiles adjacent to the proper buildings, valuable regions can be formed that will bring in doubloons. Through the actions that can be gained by playing cards, players can bring plague stones (among other things) onto the board, and thereby block their opponents' tiles. The winner is the player with the most doubloons at the end of the game.<br/><br/>"}, "25411": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic145057.jpg", "poll": {}, "boardgamedesigner": {"65280": {"name": "Bruno Ruegg"}}, "statistics": {}, "yearpublished": "1995", "maxplayers": "6", "boardgameartist": {"65279": "Wade Snyder"}, "boardgamepublisher": {"1332": {"name": "GamePlan Inc."}}, "maxplaytime": "30", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic145057_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "30", "boardgamecategory": {"1041": {"name": "Children's Game"}}, "description": "Take Rudolph's place at the head of Santa's sleigh as you guide the team through adventure-filled skies.

The rules operate in three dimensions while only physically using two, height being indicated beside an aircraft.<br/><br/>There are guns, air to air rockets, Infra Red and Radar guided air to air missiles, SAM sites, etc. Data for over 200 aircraft in use by many nations from the 1950&rsquo;s onward are included.<br/><br/>The skill of aircrew is very important and the system provides for this. The players can decide how good the crew are by deciding the level of training they think is appropriate, though a random system for skill generation is also provided.<br/><br/>Radar and electronics are handled within the rules by means of a Tech Level system that allows for systems to be improved or obsolete within the game, but without extra complication. Ground attacks are possible as part of the game mission mix, though the effect of the attack will depend on using the right weapon. SAM and AAA sites are also included.<br/><br/>Note<br/><br/>The game rules were developed specifically with jet fighters in mind and the data calculation reflects this. We took a decision NOT to include propeller driven aircraft (with a very few specific exceptions), and this has provoked comment from some users, especially if fighting the Korean war.<br/><br/>Summary of Contents<br/><br/>INTRODUCTION: Scales; Definitions and concepts; Technology Levels; Designers&rsquo; Notes<br/><br/>MEN AND MACHINES: Aircrew Training and  Skills; Skill Rolls; Dazed, Wounded or Dead Aircrew; Crew Survival; Aircrew Experience; Aircraft Capability; Equipping Stores; Miscellaneous Stores; Jettisoning Stores; Destruction of Aircraft<br/><br/>SETTING UP A GAME, DEPLOYMENT: Points Values; Organizing a Game; Starting the Game; Deploying Surface Targets; Deploying aircraft; Off Table Reserves; Air Superiority Missions; Ground Attack Missions; Intrusion Missions; Interception Missions; Rearming and Repairs; Victory and Defeat<br/><br/>SEQUENCE OF PLAY: Ending the Game; Summary of Crew Activities and Skill Rolls<br/><br/>FLIGHT FUNDAMENTALS: Formations and Movement; The Effect of Altitude on Performance; Speed and Fuel Use; Order of Movement Actions; Movement; Turning; Effects of Damage on Turning; Climbing; Zoom Climb; Climbing Half Loop; Diving; Diving Half Loop; Displacing Models and mid air collisions<br/><br/>GAME ARCS<br/><br/>RADAR AND DETECTION: Contact Markers; Detection&mdash;Visual; Detection&mdash;Search Radar; Detection of Objects on the Ground; Losing Contact<br/><br/>SHOOTING GUNS AND AIR TO AIR ROCKETS: Guns; Arcs of Fire; Lines of Fire; Target Priority and Timing; Aircrew Shooting; Shooting Procedure; Modifiers; Hitting the Target; Multi-barrel weapons; Automatic Hit Bonus; Ammunition Supply; Damaging the Target; Critical Hits; Effect of Formations on Shooting; Air to Air salvo rockets; AIR-2 Genie air to air nuclear missile<br/><br/>SHOOTING AIR TO AIR MISSILES: Air to Air Missiles; Obtaining a Lock; Losing a Lock; ECM Aircraft; Breaking a Lock; Firing Missiles; Damaging the Target<br/><br/>ATTACKING A SURFACE TARGET: Spotting the Target; Identifying the Target; Attack and Ammunition Types; Attacking an Identified Target; Defensive Fire; Attacking an Unidentified Target; Ground defenses; Unlisted Air to Ground Weapons<br/><br/>GROUND DEFENSES: AAA Guns; Air defense Zones; SAM Batteries<br/><br/>AIRCRAFT DATA: Understanding the Aircraft Data Tables; Filling in the Aircraft Record Sheets; Data for Civilian and Transport Aircraft; Data for Combat Aircraft; Aircraft in Action<br/><br/>TABLES: Payload types and location; Miscellaneous Equipment; Surface to Air Missiles; Air to Air Missiles; Air to Surface Weapons<br/><br/>1 AND 2 SEATER RECORD SHEET; LARGE AIRCRAFT RECORD SHEET<br/><br/>"}, "25423": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic166650.jpg", "is_expanded_by": {"99207": {"name": "5th Martian Coaster"}}, "poll": {}, "boardgamedesigner": {"122": {"name": "Andrew Looney"}}, "statistics": {}, "boardgamecompilation": {"187988": "Pyramid Arcade"}, "yearpublished": "2006", "maxplayers": "5", "boardgamepublisher": {"76": {"name": "Looney Labs"}}, "maxplaytime": "0", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic166650_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "0", "boardgamecategory": {"1009": {"name": "Abstract Strategy"}}, "description": "Martian Coasters is an Icehouse game playable with a single Treehouse set, a set of Martian Coasters (each with a colored 3x3 maze printed on it), and a standard d6.<br/><br/>The coasters are arranged in a square and the pieces are placed on differently-colored coasters.<br/><br/>The objective is to move the pieces of your color through the maze printed on the coasters and onto a goal square at the center of your coaster.<br/><br/>The game additionally makes use of the Treehouse die, allowing the players to reorient and move the coasters, creating a constantly changing maze.<br/><br/>The game is also playable by 5, with an expansion coaster.

No ship may ever sink a more powerful ship, even during group action.<br/><br/>Each player commands a fleet of nine warships: one flagship, two frigates, two sloops and four corvettes.<br/>Only a flagship may sink the enemy flagship, and only if it has the required support.  <br/>Frigates, dominant in an open sea, can lose maneuverability as the fleets close for action.  <br/>Sloops, wayward and easily outflanked, can also be unreliable in support.  <br/>Corvettes, vulnerable at the outset, can determine the outcome of the closest battle.<br/><br/>Playing on a hexagonal shaped hex board of 37 hexagons, the two fleets are disposed as if sailing from opposite directions;<br/>Each player in turn moves one piece in any permitted direction, moving from one hexagon to the next across their common dividing line.

Sloops may not support an attack while lying abeam of the target because they may neither move nor attack in that direction.

Army lists are provided for Philippian/Alexandran Macedonian; Late Achaemenid Persian; Roman Marian/Caesarian; Celtic/Gallic Barbarian; Norman Conquest; and Late Saxon armies.<br/><br/>Turn sequence is determined through an initiative system.  Armor and Shield protection is key to defining defensive capabilities.  Multiple categories of mounted, infantry and missile troops are distinguished.  Leadership is represented through several tiers of Leaders.<br/><br/>The system is primarily geared for 25/28mm figures.  Conversion instructions are included for 15mm and 40mm armies.  Armies usually compose from 100 to 300 figures per side; the standard system figure ratio is 1?40.<br/><br/>Army statistics, including General characteristics, War Machine attributes and Army List Templates are recorded on copies of forms provided with the rules.

The game goes over five rounds giving a scoring after the 1st, 3rd and 5th round. Victory points are awarded for majorities of allocated buildings (very similar to the original game Alhambra). To get the buildings you roll 8 dice each showing the six building-symbols. Each player has 3 rolls on his turn to get as many similar symbols as possible (up to a max of 8). A player can only note his result for one type of building. The results of the dice rolls from every player is marked on the game board. So everybody can compare his dice rolls with those of the other players. After a round is completed the player with the highest dice-roll can choose between 2 buildings of the respective category or 1 building and a special counter giving a certain bonus. (Bonuses can be: additional 1-3 VPs, extra dice-roll,  exchange one building, determine Starting player, etc.) The second best player in that category will get the other part. Each round has a certain number of turns depending on how many players are playing (3, 4 or 5 turns).
