The events include the declaration of Emancipation, the elections of 1862 and 1864, and the possible intervention by European nations.<br/><br/>Events are often double-edged swords, sometimes providing a military advantage while negatively affecting the popular will to fight. In addition, both sides may attempt to develop and manufacture new technologies, both historical and speculative, such as ironclads, submarines, torpedoes, observation balloons, repeating rifles and Gatling guns. Both sides can introduce espionage and even sabotage, which can have many unexpected consequences, including assassination. Scenarios are included for each year as well as the entire ACW.<br/><br/>Beyond the ACW proper, there are two introductory scenarios: Alamo, a mini-game of the War for Texas and Manifest Destiny, a Mexican-American War mini-game. These short campaigns will give new players an excellent place to start playing and veteran players will have two scenarios that can be finished in an evening. In addition there is Crisis &amp; Compromise, a card play oriented game of the period from the end of the Mexican-American War to the start of the Civil War.

Had he lived, the most likely start date would&rsquo;ve been one closely coinciding with the signing of the Korean War armistice in July (in order to achieve a surprise effect).<br/><br/>His main goal in starting such a war wouldn&rsquo;t have been immediate global conquest; rather, in Europe he would&rsquo;ve been seeking to seize or thoroughly wreck the Ruhr &ndash; then, as now, one of the world&rsquo;s main industrial regions &ndash; or otherwise abort the still young Federal Republic of Germany (&ldquo;West Germany&rdquo;) as an effective member of the Western alliance.

Give each player a score card and two cubes. Players place one cube on the 0 space of their score tracks and keep the other aside for later scoring in the tens columns of the score track.<br/><br/>2.

For each card that is adjacent to the card played (left or         right, above or below), and matches the color of the played         card, gain one victory point.

These cards must never match in color and the card being         played must have a higher value than the one it is covering.         Gain victory points equal to the sum of both cards (the card played and the one below it) and then remove both cards from the game.<br/><br/>The current player then draws a new card from the draw deck to place in their hand.

Each bean card has a number that indicates how many cards of that type are in the deck, as well as a &quot;beanometer&quot; on the bottom of the card that tells you how many Talers you earn when you harvest those beans from your field. The more beans of a type that you have, the more Talers you earn.<br/><br/>On a turn, a player must plant the first card in hand into one of their fields, and they may plant the second card. All cards in a field must be of the same type. The player then reveals two cards from the deck and optionally trades those cards and cards in their hand with cards in the hands of other players; all traded cards must be planted, not returned to hand. Players can trade cards from anywhere in their hand, and doing so lets you set up good plays in future turns. To end a turn, a player draws cards and places them at the back of their hand. You can harvest a field at any time to collect Talers, keeping some cards to represent these coins and returning others to the discard pile to be recycled when the deck is shuffled.<br/><br/>Bohnanza: 20 Jahre adds one new type of bean to the game: the spring bean. Whenever a player harvests two spring beans, they draw cards from the deck equal to one more than the number of players. They plant one of these cards for themselves, then pass the cards around the table so that each other player can do the same. The final card is returned to the active player, who keeps it for a Taler.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "3", "boardgameversion": ["German first edition"], "average": "7", "name": "Bohnanza: 20 Jahre", "playingtime": "45", "boardgamemechanic": ["Hand Management", "Set Collection", "Trading"], "age": "10", "usersrated": "5", "boardgamefamily": ["Bohnanza"]}, "217262": {"rpgdesigner": ["Keith J.

Can you complete the ship in time?<br/><br/>The game is played with a small deck of cards representing the commands you can use to control the machines, some cards that are the blueprints of the ship and some tokens that represent the rooms of the spaceship.<br/><br/>The game's objective is to place and lock the rooms into the their correct locations (given by the random allocation of the blueprint cards) before time runs out.<br/><br/>Overview of Play<br/>1. Discard 1 Command card for its action OR discard 3 Command cards to perform any action.<br/>2. Flip any locked locations and if required apply effects.<br/>3. Draw Command Cards up to your hand limit (3 cards).<br/>Note: The deck may be cycled a limited number of times.

This game has three modes of play: hidden identity mode (saboteurs may exist), limited communication co-operative mode (players may not speak words), and random co-operative mode (players may not choose walls).<br/><br/>In hidden identity mode, players are secretly assigned a role: Builder or Saboteur. A Builder's goal is to build an eight-tier tower, and a Saboteur's goal is to make one of the builders collapse the tower.<br/><br/>Each player has three cards in their hand. In your turn, you place a floor card, which is numbered 1-5, face-up, and other players place a floor card face-down, saying a hint (saboteurs might be misleading you). Then you reveal one of these face-down card, combine it with yours to make a hexagonal floor, and take two walls that correspond to floor numbers. You must place the floor and the walls on top of tower without making it collapse. Height of walls gradually vary over floor numbers, so you should pick the same number if you want to build an upright tower.<br/><br/>If you are a saboteur, it's up to you whether you secretly or explicitly betray the builders. You may try to mislead builders to take unbalanced walls, or boldly build up a skewed tower in your turn. But beware. Your side loses the game if you make the tower collapse yourself. You may also reveal your identity during your turn, in which case builders need to complete one more floor to win the game.<br/><br/>The game can be played as a solitaire but only in random mode. You randomly take two floor cards and use the corresponding walls to build one tier. Repeat the process until you build 12-tier tower without it falling.<br/><br/>There is an instructional manga by \u4e03\u8272\u6d0b\u54c1\u5e97 (Nanairo Youhinten) which is on the Game Market webpage for the game (see links below).<br/><br/>Publisher's summary<br/>BABEL\u306f\u4e0d\u63c3\u3044\u306e\u9ad8\u3055\u306e\u58c1\u30ab\u30fc\u30c9\u3092\u7a4d\u307f\u4e0a\u3052\u5854\u3092\u5b8c\u6210\u3055\u305b\u308b\u30d0\u30e9\u30f3\u30b9\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u3067\u3059\u3002\u88cf\u5207\u308a\u8005\u304c\u6697\u8e8d\u3059\u308b\u6b63\u4f53\u96a0\u533f\u30e2\u30fc\u30c9\u3001\u795e\u8a71\u306e\u5f8c\u65e5\u8ac7\u3092\u697d\u3057\u3080\u6bcd\u8a9e\u304c\u4f7f\u3048\u306a\u304f\u306a\u308b\u5b8c\u5168\u5354\u529b\u30e2\u30fc\u30c9\u3001\u30e9\u30f3\u30c0\u30e0\u306b\u58c1\u30ab\u30fc\u30c9\u3092\u7a4d\u3080\u9aea\u306e\u622f\u308c\u30e2\u30fc\u30c9\u30011\u30d1\u30c3\u30b1\u30fc\u30b8\u30673\u3064\u306e\u30e2\u30fc\u30c9\u304c\u697d\u3057\u3081\u307e\u3059\u3002\u3000\u25cf\u6b63\u4f53\u96a0\u533f\u30e2\u30fc\u30c9\u25cf\u3000\u4eba\u6570\uff0b\uff11\u679a\u306e\u4eba\u683c\u30ab\u30fc\u30c9\u3092\u914d\u308a\u3001\u5efa\u8a2d\u8005(\u5efa\u3066\u305f\u3044\u4eba)\u72c2\u4fe1\u8005(\u58ca\u3057\u305f\u3044\u4eba)\u3092\u6c7a\u5b9a\u3057\u307e\u3059\u3002\u5e8a\u30ab\u30fc\u30c95\u7a2e\u3092\u54043\u679a\u914d\u308a\u3001\u624b\u756a\u30d7\u30ec\u30a4\u30e4\u30fc\u306f\u305d\u306e\u4e2d\u304b\u30891\u679a\u3092\u8868\u306b\u3057\u3066\u51fa\u3057\u307e\u3059\u3002\u4ed6\u306e\u30d7\u30ec\u30a4\u30e4\u30fc\u306f\u4e00\u8a00\u305d\u3048\u3066\u88cf\u5411\u304d\u306b\u30ab\u30fc\u30c9\u3092\u51fa\u3057\u307e\u3059\u3002\u624b\u756a\u30d7\u30ec\u30a4\u30e4\u30fc\u306f\u305d\u306e\u4e2d\u304b\u30891\u679a\u9078\u3073\u5e8a\u30ab\u30fc\u30c9\u3092\u7d44\u307f\u5408\u308f\u305b1\u679a\u306b\u3057\u3001\u5bfe\u5fdc\u3059\u308b\u3001\u9ad8\u3055\u306e\u9055\u3046\u58c1\u30ab\u30fc\u30c9(5\u7a2e\u985e\u3042\u308a\u307e\u3059)\u3092\u305d\u308c\u305e\u308c\u306e\u5e8a\u306e\u4e0a\u306b\u306e\u305b\u307e\u3059\u30028\u6bb5\u7a4d\u3081\u305f\u3089\u5efa\u8a2d\u8005\u306e\u52dd\u3061\u3001\u5854\u3092\u5d29\u3057\u305f\u3089\u305d\u306e\u9663\u55b6\u306e\u8ca0\u3051\u306b\u306a\u308a\u307e\u3059\u3002\u307e\u305f\u3001\u72c2\u4fe1\u8005\u306f\u81ea\u5206\u306e\u624b\u756a\u306b\u6b63\u4f53\u3092\u660e\u304b\u3059\u3053\u3068\u3067\u3001\u5b8c\u6210\u6bb5\u6570\u30921\u6bb5\u4e0a\u3052\u308b\u3053\u3068\u304c\u3067\u304d\u307e\u3059\u3002<br/><br/>"}, "217379": {"boardgamedesigner": ["Frank Bebenroth"], "poll": [], "name": "Der Landvogt und die fraechen Luegner", "playingtime": "20", "minplayers": "2", "usersrated": "0", "yearpublished": "2015", "boardgameimplementation": ["Drecksau"], "maxplayers": "4", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3364672_t.jpg", "average": "0", "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["Ludit GmbH"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3364672.jpg", "boardgameversion": ["First edition"], "maxplaytime": "20", "boardgamecategory": ["Card Game", "Medieval", "Renaissance"], "age": "7", "minplaytime": "10", "description": "The card game is based on Frank Bebenroth's Drecksau.

These spirits can inhabit the bodies of novice adventurers to share their knowledge and abilities.  The first player to defeat their guilds nemesis wins the game.<br/><br/>The game begins with each player getting a random nemesis quest which is kept secret. Players then proceed to draft their guilds starting hero spirits. Players are given a number of dice relative to the hero types drafted. There are four types of dice used which are distinguished by their colors: red for Might, blue for Magic, white for Faith, and black for Deceit.  The dice will act as the novice adventurers and can be used as &lsquo;workers&rsquo; to activate various spaces on the board. They can also be used to activate the hero spirit cards, enabling hero abilities while on an adventure.<br/><br/>Adventures must be completed in order to unlock access to a player's nemesis, which would be their final quest to win the game.  Each adventure can be attempted by multiple players and will likely help more than one player get closer to unlocking their quest.  An adventure consists of staged pattern matching from dice rolls and any augmentations from heroes or items to complete.<br/><br/>There&rsquo;s a single resource in the game called essence. Essence can be acquired from successful adventures and be used to unlock hero abilities, gain new heroes, and to purchase or upgrade equipment.<br/><br/>The nemesis quest will need to be completed solo and will require a lot of preparation and some luck to defeat. Similar to adventures, the quests will consist of more difficult pattern matching from dice rolls and various augmentations. Be the first to complete your nemesis quest and earn the honor that your guilds fallen heroes deserve.<br/><br/>"}, "217389": {"rpgdesigner": ["Keith Garrett", "Eric S.

Starting from a historical set up, if you play alone, you will find the command rules make it easy to be logical about what orders should be given to each side.<br/><br/>The game includes the rules book, two summary rule sheets, armor penetration table sheet, ready to cut order chits and unit identification markers. Optional extra time and event cards can be purchased separately, which facilitate play and speed the game.<br/><br/>"}, "217428": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3371814.jpg", "poll": [], "boardgamedesigner": ["Rory O'Connor"], "statistics": [], "boardgamecompilation": ["Rory's Story Cubes: Enchanted", "Rory's Story Cubes: Medieval", "Rory's Story Cubes: Mythic"], "yearpublished": "2017", "maxplayers": "12", "age": "6", "boardgamepublisher": ["The Creativity Hub", "Gamewright", "REBEL.pl"], "maxplaytime": "20", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3371814_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "20", "boardgamecategory": ["Dice"], "description": "Description from the publisher:<br/><br/>With Rory's Story Cubes: Fantasia, you can tell stories of thrilling and magical creatures.

Filled with various monsters, you must collect supplies and weapons to fight your way through the night. Can you survive until dawn? Can you escape the horrors of the town? Fight through asylums, schools, the meat factory and other horrific places as monsters hunt you. Build barricades, help other survivors for supplies. Kick doors down and fight for survival. Will you be the hunted, or the hunter?<br/><br/>Set in the 1980's and like a classic horror movie there are dozens of survival horror weapons to choose from but are you lucky and brave enough to find them?<br/><br/>Choose your survivors, each with their own strengths and weaknesses. Each with their own unique skills and starting weapon. Work alone or fight together and try to resist the madness that is slowly turning your survivor into another monster.<br/><br/>The game is played on a D12 (12 sided dice).  Standard melee attacks are 5+ to hit but some survivors have better melee skills. Shooting is standard 5+ too. There is no shooting distance negative. Each survivor gets 5 actions for things like movement, shooting, building barricades etc.  There are dozens of weapons but only 1 and some 2 of each scattered around found in crates and given by in game story survivor's on successful missions. Plus most melee weapons breaks after an 10 uses and most monsters require 3-4 hits each so stocking up is Essential. There is also limited ammo supplies to be found. You can build special weapons too like a spear if you have tape, knife and a pole cue.  Most weapons and supplies are found in crates around the map. Break them open and take the said amount from the equipment card pile.<br/><br/>Helping in game survivors can gain you more weapons. Read the story card objective the survivor has task you with and complete in a certain amount of turns. Failing will result in the in game survivor turning mad. You then have the fight him. Killing him you can then take his supplies found on him but you will not get the crate of good stuff as he never told your where it was located.<br/><br/>Standard game is 10 missions. Your survivors have a certain amount of wounds each, some have 18 other 23-28. Having a tougher survivor does not mean the are better, instead sacrificing wounds for better accuracy or agility to avoid taking hits.  The Paratrooper is excellent at shooting and tough as nails but he is not as fast at running but someone like the Actress has few wounds but is very agile meaning its easy for her to avoid taking hits plus she can hide easier is sneaking around avoiding those horrid beasts.<br/><br/>Some monsters require light to die so carrying a torch is ideal. Other are messed up real bad by fire and others have longer reach meaning they can attack your from further away and also ignore barricades by simple walking along the wall or roof.<br/><br/>The movement is played in inches. Some can move 4 inch per action or 5. You can not run past enemies if they are within 1 inch and others have long arms so even more difficult to run past.  The monsters are played by the game.<br/><br/>Starting the game you have 1 survivor and as time goes on you unlock more playable survivors as the story goes on and you can trade weapons etc with them if next to them.  Each player starts with 1 survivor and same goes, unlock more throughout the missions.<br/><br/>Each survivor has their standard attack without weapons but they can attack like head butt or kick etc for a more powerful or multiple target attack but have to roll higher on the D12.  They also have a sanity attack which is a special powerful attack. To get a sanity attack you must kill the enemy. Some require 12 kills other 16 etc.<br/><br/>Madness is a thing that slowly affect your survivor throughout the game. Collect Essene by killing monsters to slow your madness or find essence statues through the map.  Going mad puts your character in the mad room were you have to fight your own demons. In the mad room you don't use the weapons you have collected instead you take new cards for this 1 mission. Completing the mad room puts you back in the game with your prevous weapons, supplies. To lose to the madness means you characters becomes a monster and hunts your other survivors. He is now controlled by the game.<br/><br/>Over all the co-op or 1 player experience is a story game were after completing each small mission you have a few turns to roam and find supplies etc. Then you take another story card and your next objective begins to completing your over all mission of escaping and surviving until sunrise.<br/><br/>There are various difficulty modes. Easy mode grants you a shop which you can buy new weapons and weapon mods like a silencer, scope plus supplies. Money is spent via sanity and madness points. Spending madness increases your madness and sanity spends sanity points meaning you have to kill more monsters to get your sanity attack back.<br/><br/>Normal mode does not have the shop and Nightmare mode has more monsters and less weapons / supplies. There is also the serial killer mode which you play a killer. The problem is his madness degrades faster but you can choose to kill other survivors for a big halt or kill monsters for a small halt to the madness.<br/><br/>"}, "217457": {"boardgamedesigner": ["Vander McLeod"], "poll": [], "name": "War Zone Vector 1", "playingtime": "90", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": ["Action / Movement Programming", "Area Control / Area Influence", "Area Movement", "Deck / Pool Building", "Dice Rolling", "Roll / Spin and Move", "Variable Player Powers"], "yearpublished": "2017", "usersrated": "1", "maxplayers": "0", "average": "10", "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["10th Dimension Studios"], "boardgameversion": ["First edition"], "maxplaytime": "90", "boardgamecategory": ["Abstract Strategy", "Card Game", "Dice", "Horror", "Miniatures", "Modern Warfare", "World War II", "Zombies"], "age": "6", "minplaytime": "30", "description": "Who is the greatest special forces unit?

Command elite CQB units with their SMG and Shotguns. Head shot the enemy with your sniper. Suppress them with your machine gunner and blast them with your rifleman's grenade launcher. And don't forget, your unique Op. swap out or use your specialist depending on the team which could be a flame thrower or anti material sniper or perhaps at PDW etc.<br/><br/>More teams will become available like the Royal Marines Commandos, the Spetsnaz, the US Army Green Berets and many more.<br/><br/>And don't forget the expansion, Zombies. Put your 5 members against a zombie infested town with various zombie types.<br/><br/>Feeling historical. Let go WW2 with your British Commandos, Waffen SS, Japanese Para Marines, the US Airborne, Russians and Chinese.<br/><br/>Build a deck too and kit out your ops with various skills and equipment.<br/><br/>Each player takes 3 cards and places them onto each Commandos dash board but keep them secret from the other players. Example of cards are tactics and equipment e.g. Kill box tactic, which means your unit will open fire on the first enemy unit to cross his line of sight. Kill box is used in the enemies turn meaning the enemy player has the risk of being shot at as he does not know if your unit as the kill box card.  Another example is grenades. Your unit could be carrying a smoke grenade and HE grenade on top of their standard equipment. A standard CQB operator for say comes with a SMG and shotgun plus a flash bang and grenade. So you could kit him up with extra grenades or medi packs etc with the extra equipment cards.<br/><br/>The game is played with a D12 (12 sided dice).  Each unit in the attackers turn has 5 actions each and the player uses them how he wants eg move, shot, reload, use rocket launcher etc. Some actions like rocket launcher cost 2 actions.  The defending player also get to use actions in their turn but only 3 and only if shot at or attacked.  Example if your shotgunner fires and hit or misses, the defender gets options. The defender can shot back, run, run and shot or charge. Each option has various negative and more negatives if your unit happened to be hit. Running for say means he can run to cover if in range as each member can only move 3-4-5 inches per action depending on their equipment load. If running then the attacker can choose to shot again but at -1 accuracy to the roll. The defender can use 1 action up to 3 action per defence turn. If he is attacked a 4th time then he can do nothing about it.<br/><br/>Each unit has 10 wounds unless the have the skill Airborne which gives them 11 wounds. Face shots take off 2 wounds. Being hit in the arm twice will decrease accuracy. Legs 2 twice decreases movement. Having only 1 wound left means your unit can only crawl and lay.  Laying down or kneeing however increases your defence meaning the attacker has -1 or -2 to his accuracy when rolling to hit.  Medi packs increases wounds by 2.<br/><br/>Reloading is required for every 3 shots and cost 1 action. Changing weapons like taking out a pistol cost 1 action unless you have the transition skill meaning it costs nothing to swap weapons.<br/><br/>The game is highly tactical and there are various distances for weapons. Point blank. Close range. Short range. Medium. Long and extreme. Some weapons can not shot into long and extreme like shot guns etc.<br/><br/>Standard mission is kill the enemy team.<br/>Embassy siege is an Expansion which gives you 20 bad guys and hostages. Basically rescue the hostages. You can also play this as bank robbery too or town take over. Kill the bad guys.<br/><br/>Zombie is another Expansion. 3 missions. Your unit is trapped with minimal weapons and you can open crates found for better, extra weapons and escape. Or mission 2, storm the town and kill the zombies. There are various zombie types with different abilities and strengths.

Hail storm them with your arrows and Kung Fu monks.<br/><br/>Box set 2 comes with the Roman Legions, the Samurai and the Scottish Highlander's with their huge claymores.<br/><br/>Add mercenaries to your army too. Will you add some British Red Coats, or Musketeers to name a few.<br/><br/>With extra units coming too like the rock throwing Trebuchet, Valkyries, Geisha assassins, Bees nest rocket arrows etc.<br/><br/>Commands powerful Heroes like Thor or Arch Angel Michael or military strategists like Julius Caesar or Sun Tzu.<br/><br/>28mm miniatures<br/><br/>Each unit counts as a large squad with a certain amount of health. Each unit as 3 attack statistics and 3 defense. Martial counts as a units attack speed (how fast they can use their sword). Strength is how powerful your soldier or weapon is. Aggression is how many times your unit can attack per turn so your unit may strike 3 times with a strength of 1 totaling 3 damage. However for defence they enemy unit has agility meaning they may be able to avoid all or some attacks. Toughness may decrease an attacker strength meaning a strength 5 attack against heavy armour toughness 3 possibly equals only receiving 2 damage. The defenders may even attack first if their martial is higher than the attacking units. So attacking someone like Thor wouldn't be wise in close combat has he would likely attack first and with great strength and aggression.<br/><br/>Ranged weapons has 3 stats.  Accuracy. Rain and meteor. Rain is mostly for arrows, like a hailstorm of arrows raining down and meteor is for things like big rocks.<br/><br/>You don't roll to hit instead once your within melee range you see who hits first (martial) then calculate how many attacks and some strength minis the defenders agility and toughness.<br/><br/>Melee can change also depending on the formation your units are in. Declare which formation your using and place the formation token next to your unit. The defender also has a chance to change formation depending on how far they are from you and their leadership command skill. Example an arrow head formation from cavalry would decimate a unit of Axe men in a standard line formation. You add the formation score of the successful formation charge to the score of your attack. So attacks in melee for say is 6 damage plus 2 damage for the formation charge totaling 8 damage.<br/><br/>As you units health decrease so does the amount of attack you can perform for that unit.  a unit with 10 health at aggression 2 = 20 attacks.  if your unit has decreased to health 5 then the total attacks is 10 because have your squad is dead. For heroes it does not decrease as they represent one model.<br/><br/>The game has been designed to be as realistic to ancient combat tactics as possible with many units having various formation choices.<br/><br/>Maybe units has Reach. Reach is like spears and pike.  An axe men unit would be hit first by Pikemen even if the Axemen have a higher Martial because the Pikemen have big long spear. Standard Reach is 1 meaning can hit the enemy if within 1 inch. Spear are Reach 2 and Pike are 3 inch hit.<br/><br/>20% of your army can be made up from mercenary units from another army.<br/><br/>At the beginning of the game you also have a certain amount of points to spend on upgrades like flaming arrows, smoke bombs, traps and flaming logs etc.  You can buy oil and place it on the battlefield then Use your flaming arrows to light it up.  These items are represented by cards. Keep them secret from the other player and use the item when you would like.  example 10 points may buy you 1 turns of flaming arrows but 30 points buy you flaming arrows for all turns.<br/><br/>Standard mission is kill the enemy. <br/>Other missions are castle siege etc.<br/><br/>"}, "217463": {"rpgartist": ["(Uncredited)"], "rpgitemversion": ["PDF Version"], "poll": [], "name": "Forgotten Traditions", "rpgdesigner": ["Claire Hoffman", "Travis R.

In the two- and three-space columns formed by the rows, no number can be repeated, but numbers can be in any order.<br/><br/>Aside from the score sheet, the game includes 32 cards, with the cards numbered 0-6 and -2 in four colors (yellow, orange, purple, gray). Each player starts with a random hand of three cards, then four cards are laid in a 2x2 square. On a turn, a player lays a card from their and onto one of the cards in the square, then sums that card and the two adjacent cards, stating this number and the color of all non-grey cards out loud, e.g., &quot;13 in purple and yellow&quot;. Each player can then write a 13 in either the purple or yellow row on their score sheet. If the number is less than 1 or all the cards are grey, then no one can write anything; if the active player can't write anything on their score sheet, then they must mark a penalty box instead.<br/><br/>If a player has two cards with the same number, they can lay down one of them, then the matching number in an adjacent space, thus possibly changing the sum drastically. A player refills their hand to three cards to end their turn.<br/><br/>When a player has completely filled two rows with numbers or all four penalty spaces on their score sheet, the game ends. Each player tallies the points for each of their rows: 1 point per number if spaces are empty, or as many points as the rightmost number if the row is full. For each three-space column, if all spaces are filled, then the player scores points equal to the number in the pentagon. For each penalty point, the player loses 5 points. Whoever has the highest sum wins!<br/><br/>"}, "217471": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3328526.jpg", "boardgameimplementation": ["Quarriors!"], "poll": [], "boardgamedesigner": ["Mike Elliott", "Eric M.

During your turn you allocate 3 actions to cast spells, use items, and grab items from the 8 face-up WARdrobe piles. The more powerful the effect, the more actions it costs, so keep an eye out for boots and familiars that can give you extra actions.<br/><br/>Gear Up!<br/>The more items you are wearing, the harder you are to hit. The innovative hit roll system supports the theme nicely: When a wizard deals damage to other wizards, they roll an 8-sided hit die and refer to the hit location on each affected players&rsquo; playmat. If the wizard has an item in that location, it is moved to the junk pile and no damage is dealt. If the wizard does not have an item in that location, then the damage is rolled and dealt to the wizard&rsquo;s HP.<br/><br/>Throw Down!<br/>There is a vast repertoire of offensive and defensive effects in the base game (over 200 cards), with more to come in the preset expansion boosters. Once your wizard is suited up with synergetic buffs, you are ready to use your spells and items to attack your opponents and defend yourself. The last wizard standing wins!<br/><br/>Wizard&rsquo;s WARdrobe is quick to set up and very easy to learn: the game pieces laid out almost teach the game itself. It is fast-paced (you can start slinging right off the bat) yet still highly strategic (with dozens of spells and 8 WARdrobe piles to choose equipment from, there are many lines of play). So far, in the hundreds of private and public playtests at conventions and stores, almost every game has been unique and exciting.

That of the eighties, that of John Carpenter. You liked it, did not you? Well, look no further. If you want to relive the best moments of the film (if you suffer a horrible death you consider a good time), then The Creature is your game.<br/><br/>The Creature is a competitive card game in which you will all have to fight against all to escape with life from the scientific base in which you are locked together with an Being from Another World known as The Creature.<br/><br/>In this hidden role-playing game you will not have friends, because anyone can be infected. The only thing that matters is to survive and to escape in the only available place of the rescue helicopter ... although that supposes to finish with your companions.<br/><br/>The Creature is a card game for 3 to 10 players in which no one is who they seem to be and where paranoia reigns throughout the game. Use your event cards to beat your teammates, vote against them to sedate them, collect weapons for the final showdown and try to prevent The Creature from taking over your body. Does it feel like little stress? Then wait for the helicopter to land and you have to fight everyone to occupy the only seat.<br/><br/>A game of The Creature lasts from 30 minutes to an hour, depending on the number of players.<br/><br/>The game is not recommended for children under 13, we do not want children to become accustomed to crushing their friends.<br/><br/>The objective of the game is to escape from the research base on the helicopter. The bad thing is that there is only one place for a scientist, so only one of the players can escape the horror. Will it be a human who gets on the helicopter, one of the infected scientists or the creature itself?<br/><br/>The helicopter will arrive when all the turns of game are finished. There are as many turns in a game as participating players minus one, which are controlled in the time marker with the clock tab. The minimum number of turns to play is 2, and the maximum 10. This represents the difficulty or ease of the creature to infect scientists when the group is more or less numerous.<br/><br/>It can neutralize the Creature so that it does not continue to infect the scientists, sedating it twice (the first time the silk manages to escape).<br/><br/>The scientist who escapes in the helicopter wins the game, even if it is the creature or one of the infected will mean the end of humanity ...<br/><br/>Overview.<br/><br/>The game is divided into turns, and there are as many turns as players are present in the game minus one (maximum 10 turns), plus the final turn of the game, the helicopter phase where everyone fights against everyone to sit in the available seat and Escape from base. Each turn is divided into three phases:<br/><br/><br/>     Event Phase<br/>     Voting phase<br/>     Movement phase<br/><br/><br/>During the events phase players put their event cards into action to produce effects during the game.<br/><br/>In the voting phase players use their voting to decide which scientist they will sedate.<br/><br/>The movement phase is played after the voting, and in it all players deliver their character cards (including that of The Creature) to the boss, who shuffles them and re-allocates them among the players, in such a way that the Creature moves from one scientist to another, infecting them.<br/><br/>The objective of the game is to escape in the helicopter. Players who have had the creature's card at some point become infected, and therefore will try to help the creature carry out its plans, complicating the existence of other players who are still human.

Even though the Law has triumphed over the powers of Chaos, banishing idolatry and superstition in favour of science and reason, humanity is still threatened by a dangerous, otherworldly force. The Realm of Nightmares invades the physical world, sending incursions in the form of dungeon to undermine and destroy society.<br/><br/>The Nightmares Underneath conforms to the following common assumptions of other old school games: six attributes, 3d6 in order, class and level, xp for treasure, spells are memorized, and there is a simple system of rolling under your attribute scores for saves and skill tests.<br/><br/>Some aspects of the game are less common:<br/><br/>    Initiative is rolled again each round, but only by the players&mdash;monsters always use the same initiative scores.<br/>    There are 5 alignments, instead of the usual 3 or 9, and they affect the way a character interacts with magic and social institutions.<br/>    Instead of hit points, this game uses a Disposition score, which you roll for each day of adventuring. Once your character runs out of Disposition, instead of dying, successive damage reduces your attributes, and may cause you to be crippled, maimed, or knocked unconscious before being killed. The special attacks of monsters may also reduce your attribute scores instead of causing normal damage.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>So what is unique about The Nightmares Underneath?<br/><br/><br/>Nightmare Dungeons<br/><br/>The justification for dungeoncrawling in this setting is that adventurers are raiding nightmare incursions, to find the treasure that keeps an incursion anchored to the physical world. Once the treasure is looted, the incursion is destroyed, and the adventurers profit. Individual creatures made of nightmares can be killed, but as long as the incursion exists, it will continue to spawn more. This is reflected by a countdown die, used in addition to encounter checks for wandering monsters.<br/><br/>The rules also include procedures for creating nightmare incursions, the creatures that stalk them, and how they grow larger and more dangerous the longer it takes adventurers to deal with them.<br/><br/>Nightmare Curses<br/><br/>The terrible experiences adventurers face inside these nightmare incursions can leave lasting damage in the form of nightmare curses. When the darkness creeps into your soul, the result is madness, or supernatural restrictions, or even physical changes.<br/><br/>The players&rsquo; characters only suffer these curses when they are severely injured inside an incursion, while normal people can be driven mad simply by being inside an incursion to long. Be careful what hirelings you take into the dungeon with you!<br/><br/>Social Institutions<br/><br/>Once the dungeons have been looted, the carousing chapter includes guidelines for investing money in social institutions that can then provide favours and much-needed services to adventurers later on. Once you&rsquo;ve spent enough money in town, you can attend classes at the local university to become more intelligent, the local druggist starts stocking the good stuff, and the geographical society lets you use its maps of the wilderness.<br/><br/>Characters can also turn communities against them, by committing crimes or leading villagers to their deaths inside the dungeon. Settlements have resentment ratings with each of the players&rsquo; characters, which may cause them to be forcibly driven out, if they get too high.<br/><br/>Spellcasting<br/><br/>Any character may cast spells, though wizards are much better at doing so safely. There are 100 spells, and though they have levels, this does not restrict them to characters of specific levels, it only makes them harder to control. Beginning characters have the same chance of knowing any spell.<br/><br/>But you can always read it for yourself: this version is free and contains the entire text of the game.<br/><br/>"}, "217065": {"rpgartist": ["(Uncredited)"], "rpgitemversion": ["DOC Version 0.1"], "rpgseries": ["FUR - Living Greyhawk Furyondy Regional Adventures", "FUR7 - Furyondy Season Seven", "Living Greyhawk", "Living Greyhawk Interactive Adventures", "Temple of the Bee"], "name": "Temple of the Bee (Levels 1 - 4)", "rpgdesigner": ["John du Bois"], "rpgproducer": ["John du Bois", "Britt F.

New available &quot;worlds,&quot; which determine background and terrain appearance on a map, are a chief addition. New hazards, such as phase blocks, which disappear and reappear on a set timer (and consequently can tear apart players or monks standing in the location of a vanished block in the process of reappearing), and items are among other additional features; notably, editors can specify certain items to be able to be picked up by only the player of corresponding color (e.g. bombs with blue outlines can only be picked up by the second player, Wes Reckless, not Jake Peril).<br/><br/>The level editor is also more complex than in the original game. Including all of these innovations, an editor may place multiple exits throughout a level, and the exits can be programmed to lead to differing levels in a pack.<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;[en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lode_Runner_Online%3A_The_Mad_Monks%27_Revenge Lode Runner Online: The Mad Monks' Revenge]&quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "217075": {"poll": [], "name": "Kalaban", "videogamemode": ["Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["Windows Downloadable edition"], "average": "0", "videogametheme": ["Horror"], "usersrated": "0", "videogamedeveloper": ["Rayhouse Productions"], "videogamegenre": ["Action Adventure"], "videogameplatform": ["Windows"], "statistics": [], "videogamepublisher": ["Rayhouse Productions"], "description": "Horror-themed action-adventure set in alternate history Finland.<br/><br/>Source: The Developer Website.<br/><br/>"}, "217076": {"poll": [], "name": "HVR-01", "videogamemode": ["Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["Windows Downloadable edition"], "average": "0", "videogametheme": ["Flight"], "usersrated": "0", "videogamedeveloper": ["(Self-Developed Video Game)"], "videogamegenre": ["Simulation"], "videogameplatform": ["Windows"], "statistics": [], "videogamepublisher": ["(Self-Published)"], "description": "User Summary<br/><br/>HVR puts you inside of an armored suit and straps jetpacks to your hands that let you fly.<br/><br/>"}, "217077": {"boardgamedesigner": ["Jonathan Rivera"], "average": "7.8125", "poll": [], "name": "Gingerdead House: The Walking Bread", "playingtime": "0", "minplayers": "2", "yearpublished": "2016", "boardgameexpansion": [], "usersrated": "8", "maxplayers": "4", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3366134_t.jpg", "boardgameartist": ["Ben Lopez"], "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["Zafty Games"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3366134.jpg", "boardgameversion": ["First edition"], "maxplaytime": "0", "boardgamecategory": ["Expansion for Base-game"], "age": "13", "minplaytime": "0", "description": "10 New Monsters, Actions, and Defenses filled with zombies and resurrection related madness!<br/><br/>"}, "217078": {"boardgamedesigner": ["Vander McLeod"], "poll": [], "name": "StarCrusade Deus Vult", "playingtime": "180", "minplayers": "1", "boardgamemechanic": ["Area Control / Area Influence", "Campaign / Battle Card Driven", "Dice Rolling", "Roll / Spin and Move", "Secret Unit Deployment", "Variable Phase Order", "Variable Player Powers"], "yearpublished": "2017", "usersrated": "1", "maxplayers": "6", "average": "10", "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["10th Dimension Studios"], "boardgameversion": ["Publisher Edition"], "maxplaytime": "180", "boardgamecategory": ["Abstract Strategy", "Card Game", "Dice", "Fan Expansion", "Fighting", "Horror", "Miniatures", "Modern Warfare", "Science Fiction", "Wargame", "Zombies"], "age": "5", "minplaytime": "60", "description": "28mm miniatures 23rd Century sci fi wargame.

Command massive tanks and mechs. Destroy with arch demons and arch Angels. Lead your army to victory with hundreds of units and heroes to choose from.<br/><br/>For those liking the western armies, the Alpha Omega and Invictus Dominae are to command. For Asia fans, the Ming styled with manga art. For the darkness, choose the rough art of the demons.<br/><br/>An average game is 800 points with around 30 miniatures per side. deploy first and take your turn first.  set up the scenery or play on the massive multi tiled board maps provided.<br/><br/>Move and attack. you can move all your units then attack or move and attack with which ever model you choose.  Average moment is 10 inch and fast units are 12, jet packs 14 and heavy unit 8.  Firearms like shotgun have a range of 10.  Sub Machine Gun 14, Light Machine Gun 16 and rifles 18.  Sniper rifles are 22 and 24. Once within range declare you target. you do not roll instead the target is hit automatically.  If your unit has a firepower of 6 then it does 6 damage. But there are things that could affect this result for say the defending unit may has Relfex skill which is -1 to all incoming firearms damage or maybe they are wearing one of the many types of armour available which could avoid the attack all together. Stealth armour can be shot at from more than 12 inch.<br/><br/>Each unit has many skills and levels. the higher the level the better but more points they cost. Heroes are the best at level 5 and have around 10 skills each and can shoot 3 different weapons per turns or attack like melee and psychic abilities etc.<br/><br/>Some abilities are Lock On which means the enemy do not get a cover save. At the beginning of the game you also choose 3 army powers which you can use one powerful army power per turn but only once. Do not tell the other player your powers. You also choose your Dominus (General) and give that unit a Dominus power which is very powerful but if that unit dies and you've not yet used your power then tough luck.<br/><br/>Melee is the same as shooting.  Move within 1 inch and attack. do the calculation of - and + for the skills in affect to give the total damage caused.<br/><br/>Blast weapons use a scatter dice. Pick the target and roll a D6 (6 sided dice) and the arrow scatter dice.  If its a hit then anyone under the Blast marker is hit. Small blast is a 3 inch circle, large is 5 and there are other like flamer templates.<br/><br/>Each units gets  Grimm Reaper roll (saving throw) once there health is gone.  Roll the dice and its a 50/50 chance of life or death. If its life then place a 1 nect to them for 1 health left.  Level 1 units only get to roll the saving throw once. nect time hit they die. Level 2's get two throws up to level 5. Heroes though get to reroll failed throws.<br/><br/>Standard game is kill the enemy army.<br/><br/>HQ mission is destroyed the enemy HQ which has 50 health points. You can upgrade you HQ with guns and traps. Also you can capture building throughout the map. Different building grant various positives like orbital strikes, shields, forward drop zones etc.<br/><br/>void missions is a 1 player or co-op which your uses only your heroes to move around the map trying to find tech to close the worm holes. the worm holes continues to bring in evil flesh eating demonic cannibals (Ravenger's) Each wave bring more baddies and tougher monsters.<br/><br/>Vector missions is a Hero vs Hero combat only. choose your 4-5 unit squad and fight the other unit.<br/><br/>During the standard mission after turn 3 your map is invaded by the Ravenger's which can be a game changer.
