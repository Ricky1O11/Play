If clearing a line is impossible with the player's hand or if no action cards may be played, then the player must discard a card of their choice and draw the top card of the draw pile.  The next player takes their turn and play proceeds until one player has flipped all ten cards in their matrix.<br/><br/>"}, "93523": {"boardgamedesigner": ["Oscar de Curbans"], "average": "5.9125", "poll": [], "name": "Jarjais", "playingtime": "40", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": ["Auction/Bidding", "Card Drafting", "Memory", "Trading"], "yearpublished": "2011", "usersrated": "24", "maxplayers": "4", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic934835_t.jpg", "boardgameartist": ["Nele Klumpe"], "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["(Self-Published)", "Oscar de Curbans"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic934835.jpg", "boardgameversion": ["First edition"], "maxplaytime": "40", "boardgamecategory": ["Card Game"], "age": "10", "minplaytime": "40", "description": "A history card game in a background of French Revolution, in which players try to understand, through clue collect, Where, When and Who finally kept the lost treasure destined to free the imprisoned French Queen Marie-Antoinette.<br/><br/>First, players have to select secretely one of the characters (Marie-Antoinette, Borel or Fran&ccedil;ois de Jarjayes), a place (Jarjayes Castle, Highlands, Temple prison) and a year (1791, 1792,1793).<br/>When the scenario is completed, each player earns an investigation sheet, 6 gold pieces, and a pencil.<br/>Note that each clue (characters, places and years) are in 4 copies in the game, only discriminated by a specific iconography.<br/><br/>After a drafting phase (memory needed!), the players will bid to collect new clues, spending carefully their gold pieces in order to find new informations.<br/>Sometimes, they only catch rubbish, but often, they can find news info cards or secrets hiding places full of money to help them in their prospections.<br/>Then, they may deal their cards, and lies are permitted.<br/>When an entire year of searching actions (the full game is made of 2 phases) is over, the players may bet about their suspected scenario, allowing them to score bonuses or maluses points.<br/>If there is a tie at the end of game, the richest player is the winner.<br/><br/>"}, "93525": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic929127.jpg", "poll": [], "boardgamedesigner": ["Philip C.

To supply far-flung colonies, they look to the Rocket Jockeys! The planets depend on timely cargo arrivals &ndash; but this is not enough for the rocket jockeys. They compete with one another to see who can complete the fanciest maneuvers, transport the most important cargo, and visit the most planets.<br/><br/>In Rocket Jockey, you must be daring and you must be quick. You must also be tough, for first contact with alien life is near at hand. Deliver your cargo with the most flair and speed and you will win the game!<br/><br/><br/>Game Summary<br/>Place 9 numbered planet cards in a row, with a random cargo card, showing a DIFFERENT destination planet, under each one. Players are each dealt 2 maneuver cards, which allow maneuver between 2 specific planets; the rest of these cards forms a draw deck, from which 3 are placed face up. Players also each start with 4 Copilot cards. The 2nd time through the maneuver deck, shuffle an Alien card into the bottom several cards.<br/><br/>On your turn, draw a maneuver card from the deck, the 3 face up cards, or the top of the discard pile. Then, either draw another or make a delivery run. When making runs, may start on any planet and pick up that cargo; use maneuver cards to chain, until you get to destination planet. If possible, may pick up that cargo and begin new chain ... all stops in these consecutive chains count towards the number of stops; chains with more stops are worth more VP. Alternatively, may make multiple deliveries with different starts/ends, but you must calculate VP for each such chain separately. Save all delivered cargo in your score pile; at end of game, you get bonus VP for having visited more planets. You can use Copilot cards in 2 ways:<br/>- use max 1/maneuver card, to alter one of the 2 planets shown by 1<br/>- place on a cargo to reserve it until your next turn; if someone else takes it, they lose 5VP; if you fail to make the run next turn, you lose 5VP and the card. Otherwise, you get your card back next turn.<br/><br/>At the end of your turn, draw up to a hand size of 2 (if you had fewer), then replenish the face up display. If you reveal the alien, place it at just beyond Pluto. At the end of each turn, it advances 1 step. Alternatively, it can be picked up like cargo and delivered to Earth.

Gearmageddon is kind of a zero-calorie asphalt death match.<br/><br/>- From the Introduction of the Gearmageddon Core Rules Book<br/><br/>In Gearmageddon, there are three basic actions: move, shoot, and ram. Movement is determined by a player setting the speed of a vehicle and selecting maneuvers. Combat is performed using a target number system. Collision damage is calculated based on speeds and structures of vehicles. Driver Cards provide opportunities for rule-breaking events that can instantly change the tide of battle. Weapon and Upgrade Cards are used for quick reference during games.<br/><br/>In addition to rules for arena combat, Gearmageddon has rules for combat races based on the 2008 movie Death Race.<br/><br/>The Core Rules includes rules for cars, motorcycles and tractor-trailers. Gearmageddon was designed to be used with 1/64 scale vehicle miniatures and 3D components. The game's simple rule of erring on the side of a rules decision that causes maximum damage accelerates gameplay.<br/><br/>In 2011, Exploding Goat Games, LLC started the Worldwide Arena Series, a tournament that ranks Gearmageddon players according to their performance in each game played. Standings are posted weekly on the Exploding Goat Games, LLC Web site.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": ["Gearmageddon Box Set First Edition"], "average": "4", "name": "Gearmageddon: The Turbo-Charged Vehicle Combat Game", "playingtime": "90", "boardgamemechanic": ["Modular Board", "Simulation"], "age": "10", "usersrated": "1", "boardgamefamily": ["Sci-Fi Sports"], "boardgamepodcastepisode": ["Episode 40"]}, "93645": {"rpgartist": ["(Uncredited)"], "rpgitemversion": ["PDF Version"], "statistics": [], "name": "Yags Campaigns", "rpgdesigner": ["Samuel Penn"], "rpgproducer": ["(Uncredited)"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic928199.jpg", "usersrated": "1", "average": "8", "rpggenre": ["Generic / Universal"], "rpgpublisher": ["(Web published)"], "rpg": ["Yags"], "rpgcategory": ["Core Rules (min needed to play)"], "poll": [], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic928199_t.jpg", "description": "User Summary<br/>This article details some of the factors in running campaigns using the Yags RPG system.<br/><br/>"}, "93646": {"rpgartist": ["(Uncredited)"], "rpgitemversion": ["PDF Version"], "statistics": [], "name": "Yags Combat", "rpgdesigner": ["Samuel Penn"], "rpgproducer": ["(Uncredited)"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic928201.jpg", "usersrated": "1", "average": "8", "rpggenre": ["Generic / Universal"], "rpgpublisher": ["(Web published)"], "rpg": ["Yags"], "rpgcategory": ["Core Rules (min needed to play)"], "poll": [], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic928201_t.jpg", "description": "User Summary<br/>This article details combat and conflict for the Yags RPG system.<br/><br/>"}, "93647": {"rpgartist": ["(Uncredited)"], "rpgitemversion": ["PDF Version"], "statistics": [], "name": "Yags Equipment", "rpgdesigner": ["Samuel Penn"], "rpgproducer": ["(Uncredited)"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic928202.jpg", "usersrated": "1", "average": "8", "rpggenre": ["Generic / Universal"], "rpgpublisher": ["(Web published)"], "rpg": ["Yags"], "rpgcategory": ["Core Rules (min needed to play)"], "poll": [], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic928202_t.jpg", "description": "From the Introduction<br/>The following sections of this article list the most common items of equipment that it is possible to buy.

These determine the number of points a player has to build their character and the maximum levels they can start with on their attributes and skills.

It was generally packaged in a double ended cartridge along with one of three other games in an effort to appeal to budget conscious buyers who would purchase two games for the price of one cartridge. There was also a more limited release of single ended cartridges containing Ghost Manor by itself. The double ended cartridges paired Ghost Manor with the platform game Spike's Peak, the fighting game Chuck Norris Superkicks, or a strategy game called Artillery Duel.<br/><br/>The game consists of five stages:<br/>Stage 1 (the Graveyard)<br/>The player must guide their character around and touch Bones or the Rainbow Ghost a set number of times. In order for the contact to count, the contact must be made on a gravestone and while the player is moving. Each contact that meets these criteria awards the player a single Spear. The number of Spears that can be awarded depends on the difficulty setting of the game.<br/><br/>Stage 2 (the Gate)<br/>The player must use the Spears to shoot down Spooks. When all seven Spooks are shot down, the player must use one final spear to shoot the Chopping Mummy. During this time, the Chopping Mummy will chop at the player in an attempt to touch the character with his blade and end the game. The Chopping Mummy does chop to a rhythm. Learning this rhythm enables players to avoid the Mummy's blade entirely with some practice. It is possible to run out of Spears. If that happens, the player cannot defeat any more Spooks or the Chopping Mummy, and the game will run until either the Chopping Mummy's blade comes in contact with the character or the player resets their console.<br/><br/>Stages 3 and 4<br/>Although the layouts and colors change, these two stages are nearly identical. The player must move their character to the staircase in Stage 3, and then from one staircase to the other in Stage 4. Touching any of the stationary walls may stun the character. The character can press up against the trailing side of the moving walls to earn extra points, however, touching the leading side of a moving wall will end the game. Players may search the coffins in these stages by touching them from the correct side. A tone is played for each successful search. One coffin in each stage contains a Cross, which is used to repel Dracula in the final stage of the game. If the character has a Lamp, the playfield will be illuminated the entire time the character is in either stage 3 or 4. If the character does not have a Lamp, the playfield will only be illuminated for brief periods when lightning strikes near Ghost Manor.<br/><br/>Stage 5 (the Prison)<br/>Situated atop Ghost Manor, the Prison is where the game's final battle takes place. Players must guide their character underneath Dracula and press the red button on their Joystick to force Dracula upward into one of the cells at the top of the screen. Players cannot force Dracula to move any direction other than up, however when Dracula is not being repelled he will follow the character left or right. To successfully restrain Dracula, players must use their character to bait him into moving underneath a cell, then press the button to force him upward into that cell. Repelling Dracula requires the character to have at least one Cross. Each Cross only lasts a few seconds, so players must keep the battle as short as possible. As soon as Dracula is restrained in either cell, the character's friend is released and will follow the character to the stairwell. Once both the character and their friend reach the stairwell, the player wins the game.<br/><br/>Ending<br/>When the game is over, the Boy and Girl are both displayed in the Graveyard holding hands. If the rescue was not successful, both characters will sink into the ground along with the tombstones and Ghost Manor itself. The tune &ldquo;Taps&rdquo; plays during this ending. If the rescue was successful, the characters will remain standing in the Graveyard while everything else sinks. A &ldquo;happy melody&rdquo; plays for this ending.

The maze is now two times the width of the display, and a virtual camera pans left and right along the maze to follow Jr. Pac-Man, sometimes resulting in the ghosts being off-screen. A total of seven mazes appear throughout the game, and unlike previous Pac-Man games, none of the mazes have tunnels that wrap around from one side of the screen to the other. Most mazes have six energizers instead of four. Like Pac-Man and Ms. Pac-Man, Jr. Pac-Man has a kill screen; when the 146th screen is reached, the maze is invisible and there are no dots to eat, effectively preventing the player from completing the level.<br/>As in prior games, bonus prizes appear in each level. These prizes were called keys and fruits in Pac-Man, but none of the prizes in this game are fruits. Prizes appear in the middle of the maze, and similar to Ms. Pac-Man, bounce around for a time, but as a prize encounters dots, it changes them into larger dots that slow Jr. Pac-Man down more than regular dots but are worth more points. If not eaten beforehand, a prize self-destructs when it encounters an energizer (also known as a power pellet) and destroys them both.<br/>There are also a few cosmetic differences: The main character is Jr. Pac-Man (who wears an animated propeller beanie); Clyde, the orange ghost, is now called Tim; and the game's graphics and sound have been updated, including a lower-case anti-aliased font for scores and game text. The game's intermissions center around the developing relationship between Jr. Pac-Man and Yum-Yum (apparently the daughter of Blinky).<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;<a target='_blank' href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jr._Pac-Man,&quot' rel='nofollow'>http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jr._Pac-Man,&quot</a>; available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "93667": {"rpgartist": ["(Uncredited)"], "rpg": ["Gamma World Roleplaying Game (7th Edition)"], "statistics": [], "name": "Factory of Misfit Omega Tech", "rpgdesigner": ["Bart Carroll", "Steve Winter"], "rpgproducer": ["(Uncredited)"], "usersrated": "3", "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic927969.jpg", "rpgitemversion": ["PDF version"], "rpgsetting": ["Gamma Terra"], "average": "7.33333", "rpggenre": ["Comedy / Satire", "Science Fiction (Post Apocalypse)"], "rpgpublisher": ["Wizards of the Coast"], "rpgcategory": ["Scenario / Adventure / Module"], "poll": [], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic927969_t.jpg", "description": "From publisher blurb:<br/><br/>Well, folks, here we are in the thick of the holiday season&mdash;and all of us at Wizards of the Coast wanted to wish gamers and their families worldwide a very happy holiday season and merry New Year.

The delay is most likely due to the video game crash of 1983. As Atari's second attempt at a video game simulation of pinball, Midnight Magic features more realistic ball physics and graphics than the older Video Pinball. The game was programmed by Glenn Axworthy. In spite of its similar name, the Atari version of Midnight Magic uses a completely different table design than David's Midnight Magic, a pioneering pinball simulation for early 1980s home computers.<br/>Midnight Magic features actual simulations of a pinball machine ball shooter, flippers, bumpers, and spinners, as well as improved simulation of the ball's actual physics. Midnight Magic was also the first home video game pinball simulation to feature four flippers instead of two (two sets of two).[citation needed]<br/>[edit]Gameplay<br/><br/>Midnight Magic utilized the Atari 2600 joystick for performing simulated pinball functions, such as activating the flippers and shooting the ball. Moving the joystick controller down pulls the pinball machine plunger back while pressing the joystick button shoots the ball into the playfield. The left and right flippers are activated by moving the joystick controller left or right. Hitting all five drop targets at the top of the table increases the bonus multiplier (2x, 3x, and so on). Extra balls can be earned when hitting the rollover targets at the top left and right corners of the table when the bonus multiplier is activated.<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;<a target='_blank' href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midnight_Magic_(Atari_2600),&quot' rel='nofollow'>http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midnight_Magic_(Atari_2600),&qu...</a>; available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "93669": {"poll": [], "name": "Sum Word Game", "playingtime": "25", "minplayers": "4", "boardgamemechanic": ["Acting", "Paper-and-Pencil"], "yearpublished": "2011", "usersrated": "0", "maxplayers": "0", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic933256_t.jpg", "average": "0", "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["Talicor"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic933256.jpg", "boardgameversion": ["First edition"], "maxplaytime": "25", "boardgamecategory": ["Deduction", "Educational", "Party Game", "Word Game"], "age": "13", "minplaytime": "25", "description": "The party will be roaring as players sum up the 1-2-3 or 4 part(s) of a word by sketching, speaking or acting them out!

The place: a Gaulish village near the Roman outposts of Totorum, Aquarium, Laudanum, and Compendium. Here we find the last outpost of resistance against the legions of Julius Caesar. And who are the leaders of these indomitable fighters against the mighty Roman empire? Who has the gall to oppose Caesar's will? Why, none other than a humble menhir deliveryman named Obelix, and his small but shrewd friend, Asterix. <br/> Your job is to help Asterix stun Roman soldiers while Obelix knocks them off with menhirs (What's a menhir? It's a... um... Oh, here it is. Menhir n.: A rough-hewn rock). Each time Asterix runs into a soldier, the soldier turns white with fear and stops in his tracks. If Obelix drops a menhir on a stunned Roman, you'll score points (in Roman numerals, of course). The faster the soldier is moving when Asterix stuns him, the more points you'll receive. If a stunned soldier is not knocked off by Obelix's menhir, he turns red with anger and becomes a dangerous foe. Asterix can only overcome angry Romans if he catches a pellet of magic potion, which the village druid, Getafix, drops from above. The potion gives Asterix superhuman speed and strength. Unfortunately, the potion wears off quickly, and as soon as it does, Asterix is vulnerable to red Romans again.<br/><br/>There are two types of Roman soldiers: fat legionnaires and smaller centurions. The centurions are worth twice as many points as the legionnaires (as Obelix says, &quot;Romans are like oysters - the little ones are often the best!&quot;). The Romans march in lanes; Asterix can only move between lanes by means of red footbridges (see figure).<br/><br/>There are four rounds of play: when one round is over all the soldiers temporarily disappear from the screen and a new round begins.

It was released for the Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis, Sega Master System and Commodore Amiga. It spawned two sequels in 1994 and 1995 named F1 World Championship Edition, and the game engine was reused in Kawasaki Superbike Challenge. It was one of the most popular racing games in the console, mostly thanks to the smooth and fast game engine<br/><br/>There are no major differences between the European and American Sega versions, except naming (The European version is simply named F1), and the lack of battery save in the American version.<br/><br/>The game is fully licensed by the FIA and Fuji Television, which means all drivers, teams and tracks are fully licensed. The player drives in the fictional Domark team with James Tripp (a programmer within Domark and producer of the game billed as Jim Tripp), facing drivers such as Riccardo Patrese and Michael Schumacher (Benetton), Jean Alesi and Gerhard Berger (Ferrari), Mark Blundell and Martin Brundle (Ligier), Johnny Herbert and Alessandro Zanardi (Lotus), Michael Andretti and Mika H&auml;kkinen (McLaren), Andrea de Cesaris and Ukyo Katayama (Tyrrell) and finally Damon Hill and Alain Prost (Williams). Ayrton Senna (then in McLaren) is absent due to his endorsement to Sega's Ayrton Senna's Super Monaco GP II.<br/><br/>There are 12 tracks (Interlagos, Imola, Barcelona, Monte Carlo, Montreal, Castelet, Silverstone, Hockenheim, Spa, Monza, Estoril and Adelaide. Compared to the real 1993 season, several tracks are missing, such as Kyalami, Donington Park, Magny-Cours (replaced by Castelet), Hungaroring and Suzuka, but the order of the races is correct. While the track layouts are correct as of 1993, due to the impossibility of actually replicate the physics behind a Formula One car all tracks are filled with obstacles close to the track, such as signs, adboards or platforms above the track to increase the difficulty level, and are 7 laps long.<br/><br/>The player can train on a given track, play an arcade mode (where points are given for overtaking and running, and subtracted for being overtaken) or the whole championship, that can be composed by any number of tracks, from just one to the complete twelve. There are four difficulty levels (Novice, Amateur, Professional and Expert), each one of each increases not only the player and competitors' speed, but also decreases the damage tolerance of the car. In addition to a 2 player Split-screen mode, a &quot;turbo&quot; mode allowed to increase the sense of speed by reducing sprites and polygons (making them roughly the same size as in split screen) and running the game at a higher speed.<br/><br/>Before and after the race the player is able to setup tyre hardness, wing angle and the transmission, and can be forced to quit if the player fails to make a pitstop to replace worn out tyres, or simply overheats the engine by rapid downshifting at high speed, (over-revving is possible with automatic gears by knocking on other cars tyres, making the player car jump, causing a drastic increase in the RPM) noticeable by a loud squealing noise.

The tribe was led by a powerful kurasatch udareen, however, who bore a valuable resource: an ancient and very knowledgeable lore pool.

Many of the slain orcs have risen as Fell, who lumber and prowl throughout the spirit&rsquo;s demesne yet radiate no heat. In a few cases, the corpses of a few of the undead suffered substantial bodily damage at the hands of the spirit&rsquo;s wrath; these Fell do not so much prowl as lay in wait within sealed caverns for fresh meals to come to them.

If the games turn out to be nearly identical, the two entries will be merged in the future. &mdash;WEM<br/><br/>    <br/><br/><br/>Game description from the publisher:<br/><br/>The year is 1922 and the Texas Oil Boom is in full swing. Prepare to head West, surveying the Permian Basin for profitable gushers and gaining more wealth than your fellow prospectors. Are you part of a burgeoning oil family fixed on becoming a dynasty, or a shrewd yankee, tired of watching southerners making their fortune? Whatever your reasons, join the race to become the wealthiest son of a gun in West Texas.<br/><br/>Black Gold is a board game of drilling and discovery for 2-5 prospectors, and play can last from 1-2 hours. Competitors attempt to claim the best wells, bid wisely against their neighbors, and sell their oil at the highest price in order to finish the game with the most money when the Oil Baron&rsquo;s train reaches the last track.<br/><br/>To secure wealth, players explore the terrain of the provided map tiles for oil wells, and they survey and build their derricks. Map tiles are double-sided and modular, ensuring a unique experience every time. Money is made if a player can transport his oil to one of three oil companies, and win the right to sell at auction. The Oil Baron's train moves nearer every turn, counting down the rounds of the game's thrilling ride; all the while it begs you and your fellow prospectors to ask the question: Am I making enough money?<br/><br/>The landscape of the Texas Oil business can be fickle and lonely as it is arid. Players can strategize against their opponents, and upset their play through special actions. During auctions, players can even lie about the value of their Sales Licenses in order to force their neighbors to bid more! But careful, you future tycoons &ndash; if you're caught bluffing, you're penalized.<br/><br/>Although Black Gold is a satisfying bidding game, it is also an exciting contest of strategy and exploration. Every game variable can offer an advantage or variation in play each round. The round's starting player has the first choice for powerful Action cards, which dictate his options for that round. Subsequent prospectors can be savvy and alter their exploration based on other players' surveying, or the last player could choose to sell his oil at a different company than his neighbors and find an easier auction at which to bid.<br/><br/>Black Gold is easy to learn, but offers an abundance of intriguing game play choices. Black Gold also provides players with optional rules that can shorten or extend game play, increase the challenge, give inexperienced players a handicap, or even reduce the randomness of well distribution. With all of these options players will discover that Black Gold is a new experience every time, even offering unique variation depending on player number, map tile setup, and well placement.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": ["English first edition"], "average": "6.91235", "name": "Black Gold", "playingtime": "120", "boardgamemechanic": ["Auction/Bidding", "Commodity Speculation"], "age": "13", "usersrated": "894", "boardgamesubdomain": ["Strategy Games"], "boardgamefamily": ["Oil, Gas, and Petroleum"]}, "93725": {"poll": [], "name": "Alice in Wonderland Game", "playingtime": "0", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": ["Roll / Spin and Move"], "yearpublished": "1984", "usersrated": "0", "boardgamefamily": ["Characters: Alice In Wonderland"], "maxplayers": "4", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic942668_t.jpg", "average": "0", "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["Cadaco"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic942668.jpg", "boardgameversion": ["First Edition"], "maxplaytime": "0", "boardgamecategory": ["Children's Game", "Movies / TV / Radio theme", "Novel-based"], "age": "6", "minplaytime": "0", "description": "Players take turns spinning the spinner and move according to the direction on the outer ring.

The past decade has been a boom time for superhuman activity, and it has left the world somewhat different from the one the players are used to. But now, fewer new superheroes are appearing each month, and the supervillains seem to be quieting down and going into more lucrative and less splashy areas. A few of the more iconic figures like Avatar and Shade are still active, but there seem to be more heroes leaving the timeline every week.<br/><br/>However, some believe it's merely a breather. Superhuman activity has never been more intense than in the last ten years...the previous two Heroic Ages were mere flashes in the pan compared to this. Some experts believe it would take more than the normal &quot;winding down&quot; forces to stop the current wave of superhuman activity, and that it's only a matter of months before things heat up again.<br/><br/>All in all, it's an interesting time to be a superhuman. <br/>And you know what they say about living in interesting times....<br/><br/>Modern Knights is presented in two parts. The first presents a simple cinematic roleplaying system perfect for any four color setting.<br/><br/>Using the Toolkit system you can create virtually any power seen in comics past and present without spending hours hunched over the calculator balancing out an arbitrary point system. Modern Knights character generation is entirely concept based, allowing you to create the character you envision rather than having to compromise with the game mechanics. The innovative sliding damage scale allows vastly differential power levels without an increase in complexity or dice rolls. Physical powerhouses can walk alongside high skilled normals and ancient mystics.<br/><br/>The second part of the book presents Knights World, our official setting for Modern Knights. The Knightsworld setting is designed to be usable as either a &quot;standard&quot; superhero universe or as a radically changing world where the old concepts are getting turned on their heads.

Hence, there are a lot of old familiar elements...government agencies, supervillain societies, global conquerors, a long tradition of superheroing, etc.<br/><br/>While Knightsworld is designed to function under the base Modern Knights rules, there are a few unique mechanics, notably in the realms of magickal and psychic powers. These are intended to show beginning Referees interested in creating their own worlds how the rules can be modified to fit a new setting.<br/><br/>KnightsWorld comes fully stocked with heroes, villains, interstellar bad guys and super-powered presidents.

Well, it means many things to many people, but in this case it means that while the characters have reasonably rich backgrounds, you can actually remember most of the important parts in their careers without resorting to a computerized database.

They tore and gnawed and gnashed their way through the dirt and bedrock until their roots were buried deep within the earth. They sucked the life from the surrounding land.<br/><br/>Their sinews coursed with cement and rusted metal, their veins pumped sewage. They choked the air when they inhaled into steam-filled lungs; and when they exhaled, only smog and fire escaped. With a thousand limbs they reached up and scraped the sky.<br/><br/>As years passed and these horrors grew and grew beyond all reason, pieces of them died and fell away. Most of the time, they would cannibalize their dead extremities and grow new ones in their place. Sometimes, though, these places were left to rot.<br/><br/>It was in these dead places that ghosts came to live; in the shadows and tunnels of the urban nightmare. In the Forgotten Places. These ghosts inhabit a world most have never seen. It exists in disharmony with the reality we&rsquo;ve come know, at once overlapping and contradicting it. It exists in the shadows and back alleys and tunnels of the urban landscape; in abandoned train stations and condemned buildings. Great rotting palaces lie within these places, vast labyrinths within the tunnels of the city.<br/><br/>Kingdom of Nothing is a game about people who&rsquo;ve lost everything, and their struggle to crawl their way back out of the cracks through which they&rsquo;ve slipped. In it, players take on the role of a forgotten person. Something happened to them that was so horribly traumatic it brought their lives crashing down and forced them onto the street and into homelessness. A mysterious force called the Nothing has eaten their memories and manifested their fears as twisted monsters that threaten to destroy them.<br/><br/>Through the course of the game, they come to grips with the thing that destroyed their lives and regain their memories piece by piece. Players at the table collaborate to create your character&rsquo;s backstory as you collaborate to create theirs. Throughout the course of the game, players discover the intense drama that led their character to get lost in the Nothing.<br/><br/>"}, "93799": {"rpgartist": ["(Uncredited)"], "rpgitemversion": ["PDF Version"], "poll": [], "name": "Lakeland", "rpgdesigner": ["Paul \"Wiggy\" Wade-Williams"], "rpgproducer": ["Lee F.

The Certain Other RPG Company catered for this by presenting an antagonist faction that catered to the needs of power gamers, misfits and the just plain crazy.<br/><br/>So how do we make this funny?<br/><br/>Simple we create the Batshit. The Batshit are outcasts from regular Bloodsucker society. Rather than gather in courts, playing politics and whining a lot they aspire to the B movie vampire archetypes. This involves lots of running round, causing chaos and freaking the Mundanes. They&rsquo;re not quite successful at living up to their monstrous aspirations. Most of them would balk at the typical acts of the antagonist faction in that Certain Other Game. However they are vicious little buggers if somewhat more like a Terrier than an Alsatian.<br/><br/>You can rely on us to continue to populate the Shadow World with parody horror gribblies for the foreseeable future. For now enjoy this third look at the world of the Bloodsuckers. Remember the more of these books you buy the more we can be bothered to write new ones.<br/><br/>"}, "93809": {"rpgartist": ["(Uncredited)"], "rpgitemversion": ["PDF Version 2003", "PDF Version 2005"], "poll": [], "name": "Piety", "rpgdesigner": ["R.

This fact can aid a GM in creating a truly exciting and vibrant world. Unfortunately, the default assumption for most settings is that there is a single unified pantheon that runs the world, even if the gods are seen differently by separate cultures. For many, the author included, this does not ring true, and ignores infinite opportunities for campaign development. This article will explore a few game-expanding options for faith as they appear in Morningstar, presented for use in any setting.<br/><br/>The world of Morningstar has no single unifying pantheon. Each culture has its own myths, filled with its own gods, and for most of the world&rsquo;s history, they were distant. Until recently, divine attention was rare for mortals, the stuff of half-forgotten tales. Now, there are newcomers &ndash; usurper gods, vying for the hearts of the worshippers who sustain the elder gods. The native gods are virtual forces of nature, or the living dreams of a people, while many of the usurpers are little more than immensely powerful planar beings. The power of the usurpers is more brazen, and more easily given than that of the autochthonic deities. While the invaders are wont to appear in their avatars, the native deities are more ephemeral, and not naturally inclined to shows of divine prowess. In order to survive, however, the elders have had to resort to similar tactics, such as granting clerical spells, and on occasion, manifesting before mortals. They battle not in some distant heaven or hell, but upon the souls of humanity. This divine tug of war is but one of many revolutions raging across the globe, but it may prove to be the most decisive for the citizens of the Nine Empires.<br/><br/>From publisher blurb:<br/><br/>&quot;Faith and Lies&quot; is an article on religion that introduces new ways of looking at faith in Morningstar, originally published in EN World Player's Journal #4.<br/><br/>"}, "93856": {"poll": [], "name": "Galactic Protector", "videogamemode": ["Cooperative", "Local Multiplayer", "Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["Japan Sega Master System edition"], "average": "0", "videogametheme": ["Space"], "usersrated": "0", "videogamedeveloper": ["SEGA Corporation"], "videogamegenre": ["Action", "Shooter"], "videogameplatform": ["SEGA Master System"], "statistics": [], "videogamepublisher": ["SEGA Corporation"], "description": "User Summary<br/><br/>You are control a ship with the purpose of defending your planet from space debris such as asteroids, mooons, and blue spheres, think of it as a cross between Asteroids and Space Invaders.

It starts out with your character (named Steven according to the arcade flyer, Takeshi in Japan) on a city street watching as a street thug runs off with your girlfriend (named Remy, also according to the arcade flyer, Mari in Japan). As you pursue him you must fight off gangs of other various street thugs. Half way through the level, you have an opportunity to save a captive bystander who (if rescued) will help you fight until he is killed. Soon (after jumping across platforms and dodging fireballs) you will arrive on a beach and fight the thug that has captured your girlfriend (Remy). After you defeat the level boss (the thug) by landing the allotted amount of hits (10), you have completed the level. This same process repeats for the remainder of the game, only with two other bosses and stage designs.

It is also possible to use a joystick and mouse in combination to control the satellite and crosshair at the same time, emulating the arcade game's controls.<br/><br/>Each stage is split into two sections; offensive mode and defensive mode. During offensive mode the player engages a number of enemies, with the aim of destroying them all without the satellite being destroyed by the enemy. Should the player destroy all enemies during offensive mode, they are awarded 20,000 bonus points and begin the next stage on the offensive.

The title literally translates to High School! Funny-face Club or High School! Weird Face Club. An anime TV series (1985&ndash;1987) and movie (1986) based on the series were also released.[1][2] The High School! manga series was preceded by Third Year Funny-face Club (3\u5e74\u5947\u9762\u7d44, Sannen Kimengumi?) (1980&ndash;1982), and followed by Flash! Funny-face Club (\u30d5\u30e9\u30c3\u30b7\u30e5!\u5947\u9762\u7d44, Furasshu! Kimengumi?) (2001&ndash;2005).<br/><br/>Kimengumi is an episodic chronicle of the bizarre adventures of a group of misfit junior high school (and later, high school) boys who form a club known as the &quot;Kimengumi&quot;. All of the character names in the series are puns. For example, &quot;Kawa Yui&quot; is another way of saying &quot;kawaii,&quot; and &quot;Uru Chie&quot; is a slang form of &quot;urusai,&quot; meaning &quot;obnoxious&quot; or &quot;annoying.&quot;<br/><br/>Other romanizations of the title include High School! Kimen-gumi and Highschool! Kimengumi. In a 2006 survey of celebrities by TV Asahi, Kimengumi was listed as #87 on a list of the top 100 favorite anime series.<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;Highschool!

What I've tried to create is a system which allows for easy conversion from any of the published games out there. At low attribute levels the game is rather deadly, while high-level characters can do some very cinematic things and survive. But whatever the power level, there is not much bookkeeping, even for vehicles. West End Games' STAR WARS RPG is complex compared to this.<br/><br/>WWII is based on my generic science fiction RPG known as WAR. This version incorporates all of the refinements made after the initial release of the original rules. There are also some additions, which were not included in the last released version (1.3). Some things have been left out because they do not belong in a WWII game. This file does not include equipment or vehicle lists.
