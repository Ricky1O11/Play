Two continental heavyweights duel for supremacy in the conflict that smashed the French Second Empire, triggered the Paris Commune, and birthed the German Reich, with fateful consequences for Europe and the world. The German player must strike fast while holding the advantage in numbers, careful not to overextend his forces and put his tenuous supply lines at risk.

Just because it can regenerate doesn&rsquo;t mean it can&rsquo;t feel my attacks. Let me see that book (grabs for the game master&rsquo;s book pile).<br/><br/>This is a familiar scene. Combat is running along smoothly until a strange power leads to an argument and the game grinding to a halt as books are opened and rules are referenced. This is particularly true when dealing with all the unique defenses monsters can possess. All those seemingly conflicting rules and minor variations can lead to a major headache and a stoppage of game play. Well, have no fear; your friends at Healing Fireball Publications have the answer to this problem in the form of the next expansion in our Combat Cards line. The Combat Cards: Monstrous Defenses are a collection of index card-sized cards with a quick reference to some of the most common defenses that are used by monsters. From damage reduction, to gaseous form, to regeneration, all the most common monstrous defenses are right here.

Chase goes on the hunt for criminals, with various moves at his disposal, such as swinging across poles and performing wall jumps; he can also gain disguises that give him additional abilities, such as a robber disguise that lets him break locks. Chase can also pilot vehicles, such as cars and helicopters, and use loose bricks to build various objects. The Wii U GamePad can be used as a device including a communicator and as a scanner to locate criminals.<br/><br/>Lego City Undercover's gameplay borrows heavily from the Grand Theft Auto series. However the game is role-reversed with the player taking on the role of a police officer enforcing the law, rather than a criminal committing crime, although the player is required to commit criminal acts on some occasions in order to infiltrate criminal gangs.

Classically associated with the wrath of the gods and the acrid scent of brimstone, hellfire is also one of the background elements of hell and the torments that await there. Hellfire represents a common element of many fantasy stories and classic mythologies, but has very little presence within the Pathfinder Roleplaying Game. The Genius Guide to Hellfire Magic adds hellfire as a new option for a broad range of spellcasters, adding options for grim antipaladins wielding hellfire scourges, determined inquisitors calling down hellfire cages to imprison their enemies, and even good-aligned clerics and wizards drawing on the building blocks of hell to fight for justice and honor &ndash; though facing constant temptation to call upon more vile forces as they do so.<br/><br/>So, what is hellfire? For purposes of this product, hellfire is both a supernatural form of energy (which is similar to, but not exactly the same as, the mystic fires mortal spellcasters call upon to fuel such spells as burning hands and fireball), and a planar material (similar to magic force effects, such as those used to create everything from a simple shield to a forcecage, though not as resilient as force effects). Entire planes of existence are composed largely of hellfire, where it serves as both unescapable prison and endless and unforgiving torment to the spirits and outsiders consigned to those planes. Like the magic forces it is similar to, hellfire can be conjured, evoked, and bound into tools and defenses by mortals using powerful spells.<br/><br/>Hellfire is an important part of Hell and the Abyss, and as a result of being exposed to its supernatural heat, most demons and devils are either immune to normal fire or extremely resistant to it. Many evil outsiders have been so infused with hellfire that they can call upon less cosmic flames as natural abilities, and their constant manipulations and exposure have infected hellfire itself with a link to the raw powers of evil.<br/><br/>"}, "121166": {"rpgartist": ["Storm Cook", "Rick Hershey", "RedPeggy", "Sade"], "rpg": ["Pathfinder System Compatible Product"], "poll": [], "name": "What's in my Pocket?", "rpgdesigner": ["Rich Redman"], "rpgproducer": ["Jeremy Miller", "R.

While these may be appreciated and hoarded for the few coins they can raise at low-levels, fairly early in most campaigns players stop caring much about items taken from the standard equipment tables (players only appreciate so many sunrods). However, sometimes a GM wants to spark some interest and mystery without handing out a major magic item, or at least make a world seem more in-depth by providing some colorful items that suggest they have a backstory behind them. To assist in such efforts, this product provides 110 odd little items, none of which will be of great use to players, but all of which might pique their interest.<br/><br/>To be on the list, an item had to be small enough to fit in a pocket, belt pouch, or backpack. Its weight had to be negligible, and its value low. None of these items give bonuses to rolls or checks. Rather, the items were designed to encourage players to ask questions and to act as starting points for GMs who wanted to introduce some new story hooks. These are creative motes and ideas rather than specific story elements, and they are best used by GMs who like creating stories and rumors on the fly. Even if one of these items didn&rsquo;t encourage further investigation when found, it may provide another great opportunity for a GM to create a colorful background when characters attempt to sell it.<br/><br/>Unless an item gives a specific value, these items are worthless (or if the GM prefers worth 1 cp) or valued at 10 gp. While in most cases it should be obvious whether an item is a minor valuable or essentially junk, ultimately it&rsquo;s left as an exercise for the GM to decide which is which &ndash; while mithral shards may be valuable in one campaign and a rat jawbone worthless, it would not be difficult to conceive of an economy that reverses those valuations.<br/><br/>"}, "121167": {"rpgartist": ["Tsailanza Rayne"], "rpg": ["Pathfinder System Compatible Product"], "poll": [], "name": "Automatons", "rpgdesigner": ["Dean Siemsen"], "rpgproducer": ["Erik Nowak", "Shane O'Connor", "Jeremy Smith"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1246701.jpg", "usersrated": "0", "rpgitemversion": ["PDF Version"], "average": "0", "statistics": [], "rpggenre": ["Fantasy (High Fantasy)", "Occult (Psionics / Mentalism)"], "rpgpublisher": ["Dreamscarred Press"], "rpgcategory": ["Sourcebook (rules/options to enhance play)"], "rpgseries": ["The Psionic Bestiary"], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1246701_t.jpg", "description": "Publisher's blurb:<br/><br/>In 2011, Dreamscarred Press held a contest for a Psionic Bestiary.

Archer plans on war profiteering in the resulting war, in part by selling copies of the technology that controls Bishop. Moments before Bishop launches a warhead equipped with a biological agent, a woman known as &quot;Duchess&quot; takes over Bishop, in the process causing a surge that kills Controller. Duchess uses Bishop to attack the base Controller is operating from and eventually restore Bishop's memories. It is revealed that the woman from Bishop's memories was his new wife. She was killed by Archer when Archer captured Bishop. Archer wanted the technology in Bishop for resale. Freed, Bishop makes a final assault on Archer.

After witnessing the brutal execution of her father Ryo, the girl is brutally hung with a tetsugen (&quot;iron string&quot;, or &quot;wire&quot;) from a tree and left to die. Miraculously, she survives and is rescued and adopted into a ninja clan where she obtains complete mastery of her adopted weapon, the tetsugen. Pledging her undying loyalty to her new family, Kurenai now lives to avenge her father's death and will go to any means necessary.<br/><br/>Gameplay employs a third-person perspective with a limited rotatable camera. Enemies are dispatched with either a kunai blade or fundo (a blunt iron weight) attachment to the tetsugen. The tetsugen also has a hook attachment that allows Kurenai to swing to various places. Melee attacks can be performed with either the blade or fundo. By repeatedly annihilating enemies and avoiding injury, Kurenai can build her ninjutsu gauge, which allows her to enter a sort of &quot;bullet time&quot; in order to more efficiently eliminate enemies. When Kurenai is being chased by three or more enemies while targeting one of them, she can perform a powerful melee attack to annihilate all enemies in range.<br/><br/>However, as Kurenai is without armor and significant reach (enemies are armed with bows, spears, or katana), most battle encounters will either injure her seriously or kill her outright. It is best to avoid physical altercations either by sneaking, stealth-killing, or using Kurenai's feminine charm to eliminate threats. Stealth attacks are possible when Kurenai sneaks up on an enemy undetected or uses the blade to slice off an unaware enemy's head from a distance. A seduction stealth kill is also possible to perform on a single enemy: during such an attack, Kurenai will perform a vaguely suggestive activity and when the enemy approaches, will drag him down and kill him. Bodies of dead enemies can be dragged in order to conceal Kurenai's presence from the enemy, though only decapitated or defeated enemies can be dragged (in other words, Kurenai cannot pick up two separate halves of a body to hide them). The game is impossible to complete without killing people.<br/><br/>Kurenai has several different methods of moving. In addition to running, walking, and jumping, she can stealth walk in order to creep up on enemies or move behind low barriers. She will stealth run if an enemy is targeted, unaware of her presence, and she is being made to run. Kurenai can also wall-jump, that is to say jump from surface to surface, up to three times in order to surmount large obstacles. Kurenai can flatten herself against certain walls, cling to ledges, hang upside down from her tetsugen to kill people, and if she is running fast enough, can zoom straight up walls until she either runs out of momentum or smashes into something. Wall running cannot be done on all walls, and can only be done if Kurenai is running at full speed. If Kurenai is crouching, she can also roll rapidly when the jump button is pressed. When faced with tight, narrow spaces, Kurenai can dislocate her right shoulder in order to go through.<br/><br/>Areas can be navigated by looking at the (anachronistic) sonar circle in the corner. A green circle signifies successful infiltration, while yellow, orange, and red signal caution, alert, and full-out alarm/attack modes. Enemies are represented by arrowheads, with the point of the arrow being their direction of vision. A white X indicates the general direction Kurenai should go in order to complete the mission.<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;Red Ninja: End of Honor&quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "121243": {"poll": [], "name": "Reel Fishing III", "videogamemode": ["Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["English/European PlayStation 2 edition", "Japanese PlayStation 2 edition", "North American PlayStation 2 edition"], "average": "0", "videogameseries": ["Reel Fishing"], "videogametheme": ["Fishing"], "usersrated": "0", "videogamedeveloper": ["Victor Interactive Software"], "videogamegenre": ["Sports"], "videogameplatform": ["PlayStation 2"], "statistics": [], "videogamepublisher": ["Natsume"], "description": "Reel Fishing III (known as Fish Eyes 3 in Japan) is a fishing game about a man and his dog.

The game takes place in a world where there are only cars and no people. Road Trip Adventure was released on the Playstation Store for the PS3 on February 15th 2012 as part of the PS2 Classics release.<br/><br/>When you start a new game in Adventure Mode, after the player chooses their name and currency a scene appears where the President says that he will organize a World Grand Prix, where the winner would become President himself. After that you are transported to a Q's Factory (place where the player changes everything in your car from wheels to engines). This Q's Factory is located in Peach Town, a gentle classic-styled city. The main goals of the game are to become President and to get all the stamps. Stamps are earned by doing other cars favors such as deliveries or simply by visiting houses and also by completing mini-games. A secondary goal is completing your picture album. To take pictures you have to visit a Quick-Pic Shop appearing on the map with a black mark. After you take the picture, the owner (always a pink Toyota Vitz) will tell you where the next shop is located. Another goal is completing &quot;My City&quot;, your own city. To complete it, you must talk to many different cars in all the towns and sometimes they will ask you if you know somewhere to start a new life or to build their shops. After the city completed, you should have besides regular houses a school, a Fire Department, a police station and the group of 4 factories (composed by a Q's Factory, a Body Shop, a Parts Shop and a Paint Shop), among others. To get into the World Grand Prix,you must have two teammates. To acquire teammates, simply talk to other cars and if they are recruitable they may ask you to consider allowing them to join your team. However, you must have a licence of b or higher to gain teammates that are fast and worth your time. Of course your teammates' qualities depend also of the parts you give them.<br/><br/>At the start of the game, you are asked to specify a name for the currency used in the game. Money is a large factor in Road Trip Adventure. It is used to trade parts and deposit in banks, and to advertise. To win money, you can race, sell parts and advertise. There are five shops where you can advertise, the coffee shop in Peach Town (10 of your currency per km), a noodle restaurant in Fuji City (20 of your currency per km), a cake shop in Sandpolis (30 of your currency per km), a wool shop in White Mountain (40 of your currency per km) and a coconut shop in Papaya Island (50 of your currency per km). Each shop gives you some money for each kilometer you drive with their respective advertisement. You can also put one sign on each of your teammates.<br/><br/>There are around 20 mini games in Road Trip Adventure. Completing them inherits money, stamps and parts.

Subsequent Game Boy Advance and Gamecube versions were cancelled due to a declining interest in extreme sports titles. To date, it is one of the few other games depicting aggressive inline skating apart from Aggressive Inline and the Jet Set Radio series. It was originally developed by the now defunct Rage Software, who were aiming to create a more authentic recreation of the sport (the box art claims the game features 250 tricks), unlike Aggressive Inline which focused on exaggerated, fantasy-themed levels and high scoring, fairly unrealistic tricks.<br/><br/>The game plays similar to the Tony Hawk's Pro Skater series of video games, in that the user holds a button to increase their speed, and releases it to jump. Also, much like Tony Hawk's Pro Skater, various 'tricks' can be performed by pressing one of the face buttons, including grabs, flips and grinds, while in the air or near edges of objects. While skating normally, the user can also 'cess slide' by using the shoulder buttons, and 'manual' by pressing the Up and Down directional buttons in quick succession. The choice of a similar layout is most likely due to the immense popularity of the Tony Hawk's Pro Skater games, whose control setup is almost becoming de facto within the genre (one of the few games to challenge this is Thrasher: Skate and Destroy). Similarly, the player can also change the button combinations of their skater's tricks to their liking.<br/><br/>Players pick a professional skater (or create their own using the editor) and work their way up to the top of the rankings by completing objectives within each of the 14 levels (10 street, 4 competition) in a succession of 3 minute 'runs'. In each of the street levels, the player must always get a certain amount of points (which increases with each level), a VideoGroove logo and Rolling logo, and a certain point amount for a cameraman. In some of the levels, the player may participate in a 'photoshoot', where a specific trick must be performed for a photographer.<br/><br/>The competition levels work in a similar way as Tony Hawk's Pro Skater. The player has three one minute runs to perform tricks in and is then judged on overall point score, variation and linking of tricks, difficulty of tricks and avoidance of 'bails', i.e. not performing the trick correctly. Unlike Tony Hawk's Pro Skater, however, the first run is a qualifier where the player has to score at least 50%. The second and third runs are judged on the above criteria.<br/><br/>As the player progresses, he or she will unlock several items. Completing objectives in the levels gains reputation, which in turn unlocks more levels, sponsors and tricks. Simply doing tricks within the levels will boost one of the skater's 10 statistics (grinding repeatedly will increase the 'grind' statistic, for example).<br/><br/>Once levels have been unlocked in the career mode, the player can skate in them freely in this mode. There is no time limit, so the player can explore the levels without hindrance in order to find the best 'lines' (to perform high scoring point combos). The only downside to this mode is that statistics cannot be increased, tricks cannot be mastered (when a trick is done enough times to 'master it', which then increases its point scoring by 25%) and there are no objectives to complete.<br/><br/>The game features several different multiplayer modes that can be played simultaneously with 2 human players. Any unlocked or created level can be played in these modes, including the competition parks. The different games are as follows.<br/><br/>High Score - The players compete to get the highest overall score within the set time limit.<br/><br/>Stealing Scores - When tricks are performed, pickups are placed at the location. These are first only allowed to be picked up by the opponent, but after a certain amount of time they turn green and are available to any player.<br/><br/>Time Bomb - One person has a time bomb which must be passed to the other player by physical contact. The person who is holding the bomb when the timer reaches zero loses the game.<br/><br/>Close Up - When 'follow' appears on the screen, getting close to the opponent will gain points. When 'lead' appears, moving away will do the same.<br/><br/>In the Zone - Beat the opponent by doing a specific trick in a certain area of the level before they are able to. The player with the most points gained by doing so in the time limit wins.<br/><br/>Tagging - Similar to the Graffiti game mode in the Tony Hawk's Pro Skater series. The players spray their logo on as many of the 30 zones in the level as possible - the most tags in the time limit wins.<br/><br/>Another feature similar to Tony Hawk's Pro Skater. The game features a fairly powerful editor that allows the player to assign biographical details, different hair, skin, tattoos and clothing (unlocked in career mode), among others.<br/><br/>An editor that allows the player to create their own skatepark that can be used in the Practice and Multiplayer modes. It is not quite as powerful as the Tony Hawk's Pro Skater series', but features many different objects and items that are not present in those games, making it a worthy addition.<br/><br/>Players can choose to skate as one of the twenty available skaters (excluding the twenty first, and hidden, skater) and work their way through a progressively difficult &quot;career mode&quot; featuring a total of fourteen levels, gaining reputation, sponsorship deals, as well as unlocking new 'tricks' and videos of the pro skaters.<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;Rolling (video game)&quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "121252": {"rpgartist": ["Ana Bruno"], "rpgitemversion": ["Softcover version"], "statistics": [], "name": "Choose Your Doom!

It was the first Nintendo DS accessory to utilize the slot. In North America, it was first made available bundled with Metroid Prime Pinball,[11] but is now available through other promotions or as a stand-alone purchase from Nintendo's online store. The accessory was released differently in Europe due to a delay of Metroid Prime Pinball in that region. Various DS games supporting the Rumble Pak (Metroid Prime Hunters, Mario &amp; Luigi: Partners in Time, and 42 All-Time Classics) had been released in Europe before the accessory was available. The accessory was eventually released as a pack-in with the game Actionloop in the UK.<br/><br/>Although the Rumble Pak works with both the Nintendo DS and the redesigned Nintendo DS Lite, it protrudes from the Nintendo DS Lite when inserted, as do Game Boy Advance cartridges, because of the Nintendo DS Lite's smaller size. For this reason, a smaller version of the Rumble Pak is available in Japan, which is flush with the system when inserted. It was initially available in just black, but other colors produced by unlicensed accessory manufacturer eWin, such as white (see picture), have been released. Other color variations been released by eWin.<br/><br/>The Nintendo DS Rumble Pak is incompatible with the Nintendo DSi and Nintendo DSi XL, as both consoles lack a SLOT-2. However, none of the games supporting the Rumble Pak require it for proper operation of the game, meaning that the games themselves are still compatible with DSi (some software titles, such as Nintendo DS Browser and Guitar Hero: On Tour, have SLOT-2 peripherals that are required for operation, and are hence incompatible with DSi and DSi XL, although the former already has an alternative version made specifically for the Nintendo DSi and later consoles). Despite Nintendo DSi and Nintendo DSi XL's lack of SLOT-2, some Nintendo DS titles released post Nintendo DSi's introduction continue supporting the Rumble Pak accessory, mainly due to the fact the Nintendo DS Lite console is still being sold concurrently to the Nintendo DSi and Nintendo DSi XL.<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;List of Nintendo DS Rumble Pak games&quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "121262": {"poll": [], "name": "Fugitif", "videogamemode": ["Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["French Amstrad CPC edition"], "average": "0", "videogametheme": ["Crime", "Science Fiction"], "usersrated": "0", "videogamedeveloper": ["Lankhor"], "videogamegenre": ["Adventure"], "videogameplatform": ["Amstrad CPC"], "statistics": [], "videogamepublisher": ["Lankhor"], "description": "User Summary<br/><br/>An icon-driven adventure game set in a far future in a distant galaxy.<br/><br/>The back of the box says (translated from French):<br/>&quot;A group of renegades led by convicted murderer XOCANN has escaped the prison planet Orlano II and is heading towards the heart of the Foundation, hungry for vengeance...<br/><br/>You are Jack BLUDFIELD, bounty hunter and formor Foundation agent.<br/><br/>Your mission: find and apprehend the fugitive.<br/><br/>This manhunt will take you to several galaxies...<br/><br/>Don't forget that Xocann is also the murderer of your wife, the one to whom you owe your disfigured face and your reliance on a cerebral computer for life support.<br/><br/>Succeed in saving the world and free yourself of your past...&quot;<br/><br/>"}, "121263": {"poll": [], "name": "Globe-trotter", "videogamemode": ["Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["French Amstrad CPC edition"], "average": "0", "videogametheme": ["Other"], "usersrated": "0", "videogamedeveloper": ["Excalibur (Video Game)"], "videogamegenre": ["Adventure"], "videogameplatform": ["Amstrad CPC"], "statistics": [], "videogamepublisher": ["Excalibur (Video Game)"], "description": "User Summary<br/><br/>A Graphical text adventure in which you must travel across the world.

There IS the faint chance of someone falling down from the conveyor belts and getting scrapped. Fortunately, those unfortunate robots can be accounted for as collateral damage...<br/><br/>In Robot Factory, players guide their robots in a maze-like factory floor, using conveyor belts that keep moving every turn. Players operate their construction robots by playing programming cards, in an effort to collect parts for the most advanced robots as required by the given assembly instructions. Once a player has enough parts for assembly, they assemble the robots in the assembly lines and are awarded Victory Points. However, the players&rsquo; construction robots may be pushed off the board, and they only have a limited number of &ldquo;lives&rdquo; &ndash; CPU's &ndash; to reboot themselves after falling.<br/><br/>You want to gather all the parts, but so does everyone else.

This version is the first non-arcade version based Sega Rally, as a consequence it was not created by Tetsuya Mizuguchi's AM5, but by Jun Taniguchi's team. Its action footage was used in World Rally Championship.<br/><br/>Sega Rally 2006 does not have a 480p option for a progressive capable display. It does however have a 16:9 mode.<br/><br/>Sega Rally Championship - a direct port of the original 1995 arcade game was bundled with this game, and has a 480p option for a progressive capable display. It does not have a wide screen option.<br/><br/>Sega initially planned the PlayStation 2 release date for 2005 as a 10-year anniversary celebration version, and was to be named &quot;Sega Rally 2005&quot;, but the launch date was postponed. A significant change in Sega Rally 2006 involves the development team's change to a new one led by producer Jun Taniguchi, replacing Tetsuya Mizuguchi (Sega Rally, Sega Touring Car Championship). Taniguchi turned Sega Rally into his own vision; First, several features have been removed from the previous Sega Rally 2 for Dreamcast, both Network Battle and two-player Battle multiplayer modes are not available anymore. The music genre has been changed from instrumental Hard Rock with classic tunes such as &quot;Conditioned Reflex&quot; (the 1996 &quot;Plus&quot; edition BGM being performed by the Japanese act &quot;X-BAND&quot;) to Lo-Fi synthesizer driven pop becoming a key change in the series. When Sega Rally 2 offered 3ch Surround sound, the 2006 edition is only Stereo/Mono, which is a surprising backstep on a 6ch Dolby Digital/Pro Logic II capable machine.<br/><br/>Additionally, the depicted &quot;fog&quot; effect from Sega Rally 2, which was pointed to be a consequence of the use of Windows CE devkit, has been replaced by a heavy &quot;clipping&quot; effect. The increased speed in the driver's view can be explained by the removal of the rear view mirror. The change is also noticeable within the car selection.<br/><br/>Sega Rally Championship was introduced with '92 &amp; '94 World Rally Championship winner cars, being both Didier Auriol's French flagged cars, the Sega Saturn version adding Sandro Munari's hidden Stratos HF Gr4 WRC '77. Sega Rally 2 Arcade followed this path with four WRC '97 cars: Carlos Sainz's Corolla WRC, Tommi M&auml;kinen's Lancer Evo IV WRC, Colin McRae's Impreza WRC, Gilles Panizzi's 306 Maxi plus Ari Vatanen's Escort WRC '98 &amp; Sandro Munari's Stratos HF Gr4 WRC '77. The original Celica &amp; Delta from Sega Rally 1995 were hidden in the Arcade version. Due to its &quot;10-year Championship&quot; mode, Sega Rally 2 Dreamcast had added a large number of cars to the ones already available in the Arcade. Switching from Europe based FIA (F&eacute;d&eacute;ration Internationale de l'Automobile) WRC (World Rally Championship) to North American based SCCA (Sports Car Club of America) ProRally, the latter allowing more powerful specs, Sega Rally 2006 abandon all the vehicles from Sega Rally 2 to introduce a brand new selection. The three original 1995 classics, Celica WRC '94, Delta WRC '92 &amp; Stratos WRC '77 being also included as hidden Extra cars. Some Sega Rally 2006 Open Class cars are Mark Lovell's Pikes Peak International HillClimb winning Impreza WRX ProRally '03 (the same model appearing in Enthusia Professional Racing), Tim O'Neil's Focus SVT ProRally '03 and the Lancer Evolution VIII MR ProRally '03.<br/><br/>Sega Rally 2006 features three game modes: Career Mode, Arcade Mode and the classical Time Attack Mode.<br/><br/>The Arcade Mode is based on checkpoints. The driver select between &quot;Series 1&quot; (Easy), &quot;Series 2&quot; (Normal) or &quot;Series 3&quot; (Hard) for a 4-stages championship with the goal to reach the pole position by the end of the series and to become the Champion. The driver starts each series from the 15th position and race on various predetermined weather/daytime conditions in European, Asian, African, North American, Scandinavian or Circuit rounds. It is possible to race the Arcade Mode with Professional, Extra or Career tuned cars. After completing the first Series, another set of stages is unlocked as &quot;Series 4&quot;, &quot;Series 5&quot; &amp; &quot;Series 6&quot;. Beating this second set of stages unlock the three &quot;Extra&quot; cars taken from Sega Rally Championship 1995.<br/><br/>Career is Sega Rally 2006's core with four race types: 1on1 Versus CPU, Race against seven AI controlled cars, Time Attack &amp; Total time series Rally. The Career mode is divided in two steps Amateur and Professional each one with its own &quot;Open&quot;, &quot;Class 1&quot; &amp; &quot;Class 2&quot; series.

It features a series of games based on previous Sega titles. It also contains Chao, the virtual pets from the Sonic series.<br/><br/>More games in the Sega Superstars series were produced, including Sega Superstars Tennis and Sonic &amp; Sega All-Stars Racing. Both were developed for multiformats, including Xbox 360, PlayStation 3, Wii and Nintendo DS. However, rather than having been developed by Sonic Team themselves, instead, they were developed by Sumo Digital.<br/><br/>Gameplay is similar to that of Eyetoy: Play, in which players use their body to play a variety of minigames. However, while that game only picked up player's movement, Sega Superstars uses a more advanced system. Before the start of each game, a setup screen with an orange area is shown. In order to start the game, players have to stand in a position where the orange area won't pick up any movement and select the continue button. This method determines what area is the background, allowing Eyetoy to pick up the player's position, as opposed to just what areas are moving. This is particularly prominent in games like Puyo Puyo, that uses the player's entire body.<br/><br/>There are a total of 12 different full games to play in the main mode of Sega Superstars:<br/>    Sonic the Hedgehog &ndash; As Sonic runs down a round tunnel, he follows the position of the player's hand. Using this method, the aim of the game is to gather rings and Chaos Emeralds in order to obtain the highest score at the end of the game. It is much like the Special Stage on Sonic the Hedgehog 2, Sonic Heroes, and especially Sonic Rush.<br/>    Samba de Amigo &ndash; Players choose a song, and then must hit 6 different targets around the screen as the 'beat balls' reach them in time with the music. Posing with hands over 2 of the targets, or holding one position until a trail of beat balls is complete, may also be required from the player.<br/>    ChuChu Rocket! &ndash; Movement over a certain target on the screen will cause a bridge to raise, which the chu-chus then follow to the goal. The bridge also must be dropped at certain moments to prevent KapuKapus from destroying the score.<br/>    Puyo Pop Fever &ndash; Differently colored puyos will fall from the top of the screen, and the player's body must be positioned to guide them into the corresponding pots and allow bombs to topple off the bottom of the screen.<br/>    Crazy Taxi &ndash; Large movements and loud sounds must be undertaken to stop the Crazy Taxi and complete the level.<br/>    Super Monkey Ball &ndash; The player must move their arms into different positions in order to guide the monkey ball around obstacles and towards the goal, picking up as many bananas as possible along the way.<br/>    NiGHTS Into Dreams &ndash; NiGHTS must be controlled and navigated through rings, collecting chips along the way, by raising the arms into a 'flying' position and adjusting them along the way.<br/>    House of the Dead &ndash; A multitude of different zombies must be attacked and defeated by hitting them. Innocent people who occasionally appear must also be avoided.<br/>    Virtua Striker &ndash; As footballs drop from the top of the screen, the aim is to head them into differently colored and scored balloons on the opposite side of the screen in order to obtain the highest score.<br/>    Virtua Fighter &ndash; Standing to one side, players kick and punch the corresponding attack prompts on the screen in order to defeat the opponent. Block and counter prompts also appear, and must be reacted to accordingly.<br/>    Space Channel 5 &ndash; Different dance move combination must be remembered when shown by the Morolians, and then repeated in time to the music by hitting six different buttons on the screen.<br/>    Billy Hatcher and the Giant Egg &ndash; By waving their hands over two different targets, players must move Billy and the egg around, and crush enemies and collect fruits along the way to the goal.<br/><br/>Extra modes:<br/>    In the &quot;Sonic the Hedgehog&quot; game, successfully completing all three difficulties with Sonic will unlock Shadow's story, which allows to control Shadow instead of Sonic, although this story is much harder.<br/>    In the &quot;Puyo Pop Fever&quot; game, by successfully completing all three levels, the player will unlock a mode called &quot;Free Mode&quot; that allows players to simply play around with puyos and experiment with moving them around.<br/>    In the &quot;NiGHTS into Dreams&quot; game, successfully completing all three levels opens up a new night-time area (Twin Seeds) with harder levels and different scenery.<br/>    Completing all three levels on both &quot;Samba De Amigo&quot; and &quot;Chu Chu Rocket&quot; unlocks an extra-hard difficulty setting.<br/>    Also available is a variation of the Tiny Chao Garden from different Sonic games. Here, a Chao can be hatched and petted via different movements. It is also possible to interact with some scenery (shaking trees for fruit) and purchase items for the Chao using rings collected in the main game mode.<br/>    In the &quot;Samba De Amigo&quot; game, if every song is played, DLC songs from the first game will be added.<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;Sega Superstars&quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "121346": {"poll": [], "name": "Of Orcs and Men", "videogamemode": ["Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["English/European PlayStation 3 edition", "English/European Windows edition", "English/European Xbox 360 edition", "North American PlayStation 3 edition", "North American Windows edition", "North American Xbox 360 edition", "Windows Downloadable edition"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1485454.jpg", "videogametheme": ["Fantasy"], "videogamegenre": ["RPG"], "videogamecharacter": ["Styx"], "videogamedeveloper": ["Cyanide Studio", "Spiders"], "videogamefranchise": ["Of Orcs and Men"], "videogameplatform": ["PlayStation 3", "Windows", "Xbox 360"], "usersrated": "3", "average": "5.33333", "statistics": [], "videogamepublisher": ["Focus Home Interactive"], "vgcharacterversion": ["Styx"], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1485454_t.jpg", "description": "Of Orcs and Men first puts you into the role of an elite Orc soldier from the legendary legion of Bloodjaws, a league of warriors deeply involved in the war opposing the Orcs and Goblins on one side to their persecutors, Humankind.

However, each die must be selected carefully to fit the building requirements. Push your luck too far &ndash; or select carelessly &ndash; and a player may find himself demolishing his city instead of building it up. Choose each die wisely and build efficiently in order to erect magnificent skyscrapers and create the best skyline!<br/><br/>Skyline is a quick push-your-luck dice game involving set collection. Unlike other dice games that provide no relationship from turn to turn and no player interaction, this game allows players to literally build upon their decisions each turn and react to their opponents' actions.<br/><br/>Each turn, players choose to roll dice from either the Construction Yard or the Abandoned District, with the goal of erecting urban buildings. Buildings are made up of three types of dice: Ground Floor dice, Mid-Floor dice and Penthouse dice. Some buildings are safer to build but provide little reward, while other buildings have poor probabilities but can have substantial impact on the success of a player's skyline.<br/><br/>After rolling their selected dice, the player must use at least one of these dice to take one of three possible actions: Abandon, Build, or Cancel Construction. The Build action is the desired outcome, of course, but can be carried out only if the die result matches what they need to build. For instance, all Ground Floor dice can be built without restriction, but a High-Rise Mid-Floor die result can be built only on top of a High-Rise Ground Floor die. Likewise, a Mid-Rise Penthouse die can be built only on a Mid-Rise Mid-Floor die. If the rolled results do not allow them to Build, then the player must Cancel Construction on one of their existing buildings. If a player does not want to Cancel Construction, then they must Abandon by placing that die in the Abandoned District, which gives their opponents the opportunity to capitalize on this failure.<br/><br/>At the end of the game, points are rewarded for completed buildings according to their height. A Level 3 building &ndash; that is, a building comprised of three dice &ndash; is worth 9 points, while a Level 4 building is worth 16, and so on.<br/><br/>Remember, the dice control the results...but the players control the dice.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "1", "boardgameversion": ["English first edition"], "average": "6.03249", "name": "Skyline", "playingtime": "20", "boardgamemechanic": ["Dice Rolling", "Press Your Luck", "Set Collection"], "age": "10", "usersrated": "1167", "boardgamesubdomain": ["Family Games"], "boardgamefamily": ["Games by Gamesmiths", "Solitaire Games", "TMG Originals"], "boardgamepodcastepisode": ["The One About Prezcon"]}, "121424": {"poll": [], "name": "Auf geht's mit der Rheinischen Post", "playingtime": "0", "minplayers": "0", "boardgamemechanic": ["Roll / Spin and Move"], "yearpublished": "0", "usersrated": "0", "maxplayers": "0", "boardgamefamily": ["Country: Germany", "Promotional Board Games"], "average": "0", "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["Rheinische Post"], "boardgameversion": ["First edition"], "maxplaytime": "0", "boardgamecategory": ["Trivia"], "age": "0", "minplaytime": "0", "description": "A promotional Game by a regional newspaper for cultural attractions in the Rheinland region in the West of Germany.<br/><br/>Players roll a die and move a pawn along a track through the region &quot;discovering it&quot; by drawing and reading cards when they land on certain spaces.<br/><br/>"}, "121425": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2621572.jpg", "poll": [], "boardgamedesigner": ["Micha\u0142 Oracz"], "statistics": [], "yearpublished": "2012", "maxplayers": "4", "boardgameartist": ["Piotr Foksowicz", "Maciej Mutwil"], "boardgamepublisher": ["Portal Games", "Z-Man Games"], "maxplaytime": "30", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2621572_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "30", "boardgamecategory": ["Expansion for Base-game", "Fighting", "Science Fiction"], "description": "The Steel Police is a wandering brigade of law and order fanatics, clad in pre-war, experimental power armor.

An astonishing Italian victory and the very first one of the young nation.<br/><br/>S3 Coatit:<br/>The Italian Army in Eritrea, led by General Baratieri, wins its last victory before Adowa, attacking the overhelming Ras Mangasha&rsquo;s Army at Coatit, fighting two days and performing a perfect redeployment under enemy fire. Tactically a draw, but stra-tegically a victory.<br/><br/>S4 Amba Alagi<br/>The political quarrel between Gen. Arimondi and Eritrea Governor Baratieri led the IV Native Bat-talion to be put in the advanced position of Amba Alagi, just in front of the full Negus Menelik Ethiopian Army. Arimondi wanted to repeat Agordat, when with few troops managed to win the day, and therefore, despite Baratieri&rsquo;s order to withdraw the Battalion, he didn&rsquo;t forward it to Lt. Toselli, condemning hime and his men to sure death&hellip; it will be the prelude to Adowa!<br/><br/>S5 Metemma<br/>After the sack of the historic capital city of Gondar in 1888, Negus Neghesti Johannes IV gathered an army to repel the Mahdists from the city of Metemma. While on the way to victory, the Ethiopians melt away demoralized by the killing of their Emperor during the final assault.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": ["English first edition"], "average": "7.3875", "name": "Ascari", "playingtime": "60", "boardgamemechanic": ["Hex-and-Counter"], "age": "10", "usersrated": "40", "boardgamesubdomain": ["Wargames"], "boardgamefamily": ["Italian Colonial Battles"]}, "121430": {"poll": [], "name": "Hot Wheels:  Road Race Game", "playingtime": "15", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": ["Pick-up and Deliver", "Roll / Spin and Move"], "yearpublished": "2010", "usersrated": "1", "boardgamefamily": ["Hot Wheels", "Sports: Auto Racing"], "maxplayers": "4", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1249162_t.jpg", "average": "6", "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["Fundex"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1249162.jpg", "boardgameversion": ["Fundex First Edition"], "maxplaytime": "15", "boardgamecategory": ["Children's Game", "Racing"], "age": "4", "minplaytime": "15", "description": "It is a race to get to the race!

Klonoa of the Wind: Dreaming Empire) is a video game published by Namco for the Game Boy Advance and released in Japan and North America in 2001 and Europe the following year. Falling somewhere between Klonoa: Door to Phantomile and Klonoa 2: Lunatea's Veil, Empire of Dreams is a two-dimensional adventure game with puzzle elements that takes place in the new realm in the Klonoa series, the Kingdom of Jillius.<br/><br/>Taking place after Klonoa 2: Lunatea's Veil, Klonoa: Empire of Dreams follows the adventures of Klonoa after he awakens one morning in the Kingdom of Jillius, and is dragged by the emperor's royal guards to his throne room for seemingly no reason. Emperor Jillius himself informs Klonoa that he broke the sacred law of his kingdom by dreaming, which he views as a worthless endeavor and a total waste of time. The Emperor himself suffers from insomnia, and decrees that if he cannot be allow to dream, then no one can. Rather than punish Klonoa outright, he instead offers him a challenge: defeat the four great monsters that are wreaking havoc on the land, and he will be set free. Joined by his friend Huepow, Klonoa has no choice but to travel to the surrounding lands and do battle with the monsters living there, hoping to earn his freedom and bring peace to the kingdom at last.<br/><br/>Klonoa: Empire of Dreams works like a typical 2D sidescroller with the player moving Klonoa left or right on a scrolling screen while defeating enemies using his &quot;wind bullet&quot;, a special ring that can shoot a small gust of wind forward and draw an enemy in, allowing Klonoa to lift them over his head. From this position, he can either throw them straight forward like a projectile, taking out any enemy they hit, or he can perform a double-jump, allowing him to reach places he couldn't normally. In addition to enemies, Klonoa can also pick up large square blocks and place them wherever the player chooses. By holding the jump button after Klonoa has left the ground, Klonoa flaps his ears can float in mid-air for a short duration, which also somewhat increases his jumping height.<br/> The game is progressed by finding the exit to a stage after collecting three stars within the level. Other items like crystals and hearts can be collected in addition, and 1-up items (resembling Klonoa's hat) are usually hidden within a level as well. Hearts can also be found to increase Klonoa's health.<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;Klonoa: Empire of Dreams&quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "121435": {"poll": [], "name": "Klonoa 2 Dream Champ Tournament", "videogamemode": ["Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["eShop Wii U Downloadable edition", "North American Game Boy Advance edition"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3005961.png", "videogameseries": ["Klonoa"], "videogametheme": ["Cute Fantasy"], "usersrated": "1", "videogamedeveloper": ["Now Production"], "videogamegenre": ["Platform"], "videogameplatform": ["Game Boy Advance", "Wii U"], "average": "8", "statistics": [], "videogamepublisher": ["Namco Bandai Games Inc.", "Namco Ltd."], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3005961_t.png", "description": "Klonoa 2: Dream Champ Tournament (Japanese: Kaze no Klonoa G2: Dream Champ Tournament) is a video game published by Namco and released on the Game Boy Advance in Japan in 2002 and North America in early 2005. As the third game in the Klonoa handheld series, the game retains many of the gameplay elements of the previous titles, while adding in a few of its own.<br/><br/>Klonoa 2: Dream Champ Tournament takes place sometime after the events of Klonoa: Empire of Dreams. The game begins shortly after Klonoa defeats the King of Despair, and receives an invitation letter that floats from the sky telling him that he has been selected to compete in the prestigious &quot;Dream Champ Tournament&quot; among other accomplished adventurers for the title of &quot;Greatest Hero&quot; as well as a cash reward. After Klonoa finishes reading, he is enveloped in a bright light and finds himself transported inside a gigantic arena alongside several other adventurers. He meets up with Lolo and Popka, only to learn that they are taking part in the competition as well, and a pompous rogue named Guntz who brushes him off immediately. The master of ceremonies, and sponsor of the tournament itself, Garlen, makes his appearance and informs everyone that they will be paired off in a single-elimination tournament that has them racing across several worlds of his own choosing. The first one to reach the end will be the winner and will advance to the next round.<br/><br/>As the third handheld Klonoa game, Dream Champ Tournament plays very similarly to the rest of the games in the series. Using traditional platformer elements, the player can move Klonoa left and right, moving the screen forward as they progress. To defeat enemies, Klonoa will have to use his special weapon, the Wind Bullet, to pull them towards him so he can pick them up. From this position, he can either toss them forward to defeat other enemies, or use them to perform a double-jump to reach places he couldn't normally. In addition, by holding the jump button, Klonoa can flap his large ears to float in place for a short time, which also somewhat increases his jump height or distance.<br/> The game consists of five worlds split into nine small levels called &quot;visions&quot;, including a boss level where Klonoa must compete in a foot-race with another adventurer and battle a boss at the same time. One vision is also devoted to a special stage where Klonoa must navigate his hoverboard over water or other terrain while avoiding enemies.<br/> In each vision, there a number of items Klonoa can collect, including exactly 3 stars (Moon Stones), 30 crystals-like objects called &quot;Dream Shards&quot;, and one sun-shaped item called a &quot;Sun Stone&quot;. The three stars are needed to open the exit door at the end of each vision, but the remaining items are optional. By collecting all 30 Dream Shards, a section of a piece of original artwork is revealed (5 in all, one for each world). If every Sun Stone in the game is collected by the time the player beats it, special stages called &quot;EX Stages&quot; will become available. Beating these new stages has no bearing on the actual game, and are included just for fun.<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;Klonoa 2: Dream Champ Tournament&quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "121436": {"poll": [], "name": "Kaze no Klonoa: Moonlight Museum", "videogamemode": ["Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["Japanese WonderSwan edition"], "average": "0", "videogameseries": ["Klonoa"], "videogametheme": ["Cute Fantasy"], "usersrated": "0", "videogamedeveloper": ["Namco Ltd."], "videogamegenre": ["Platform"], "videogameplatform": ["WonderSwan"], "statistics": [], "videogamepublisher": ["Namco Ltd."], "description": "Kaze no Klonoa: Moonlight Museum (\u98a8\u306e\u30af\u30ed\u30ce\u30a2 \u30e0\u30fc\u30f3\u30e9\u30a4\u30c8\u30df\u30e5\u30fc\u30b8\u30a2\u30e0?, Kaze no Kuronoa Muunraito Myuujiamu, lit. &quot;Klonoa of the Wind: Moonlight Museum&quot;) is a video game developed and published by Namco and released exclusively in Japan for the Bandai Wonderswan in 1999. As Klonoa's first handheld adventure, it is the first game in the series to place him in a fully two-dimensional world, and establishes the system that his Game Boy Advance titles will use.<br/><br/>Taking place sometime before Klonoa: Door to Phantomile, Klonoa's first game, Kaze no Klonoa: Moonlight Museum stars Klonoa and his friend Huepow as they come across a young crying girl who tells them that the moon has been divided into fragments and stolen by a mysterious group of artists that reside in the nearby Moonlight Museum. Determined to help, the duo rush off to the Museum's entrance, and once they come inside, they are greeted by a painter named Picoo who traps them inside a piece of artwork. Klonoa and Huepow must fight their way through five worlds within the Museum itself before finding the source of all their troubles and restoring the moon to the sky.<br/><br/>Setting the standard for all the future Klonoa handheld titles, Moonlight Museum displays several standard features for an action sidescroller. The player controls Klonoa as he runs, jumps, and fights his way across several worlds, solving small puzzles in the process. Klonoa defeats enemies by picking them up using a special weapon called the &quot;wind bullet&quot;, a ring-shaped object inlaid with a small blue jewel that can fire a small burst of wind straight forward and draw in an enemy, allowing for Klonoa to pick them up over his head. Once he has them, Klonoa can either throw them straight forward, taking out any enemies they happen to hit, or use them to perform a double jump, giving him access to places he otherwise couldn't reach. Also, by holding the jump button, Klonoa can hover in midair for a short duration by flapping his large ears, which also slightly increases his jump distance.<br/> By completing all five worlds and beating the game, Klonoa can access special bonus stages called &quot;EX Stages&quot;. These visions are included just for fun, and beating them has no effect on the actual story.<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;Kaze no Klonoa: Moonlight Museum&quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "121437": {"rpgartist": ["Rowena Aitken", "Bradley McDevitt", "Claudia Silva"], "rpgitemversion": ["PDF version", "Print Version"], "poll": [], "name": "Gosh, Spies!", "rpgdesigner": ["James Desborough", "Filamena Young"], "rpgproducer": ["James Desborough"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1750895.png", "usersrated": "0", "average": "0", "statistics": [], "rpg": ["Agents of S.W.I.N.G."], "rpgpublisher": ["Postmortem Studios"], "rpgcategory": ["Sourcebook (rules/options to enhance play)"], "rpggenre": ["Action / Adventure", "Animation / Comics", "Crime (Spy / Espionage)", "Kid-Friendly", "Modern", "Modern (Pop Culture)"], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1750895_t.png", "description": "From Postmortem's blog preview:<br/><br/>Gosh, Spies! is a supplement for Agents of SWING and will expand the SWING world into the realms of children&rsquo;s, tweens and teens adventure fiction, drawing on such diverse sources as Enid Blyton, Hanna Barbera and &lsquo;Keene&rsquo;/'Dixon&rsquo; as well as later skits and reinterpretations of the same ideas and characters, giving our own spin on them.<br/><br/>As well as a catalogue of pre-generated characters from these sources you&rsquo;ll get rules expansions for making youthful characters, rules changes for running child-investigations, suggestion on how to run games for a younger audience &ndash; particularly girls and a bunch of background information on SWING&rsquo;s younger agents, their training and the boarding schools where they teach them to be spies.<br/><br/>Essentially, Gosh, Spies! will provide you with a bunch of characters and villainous organisations suited to the sub-genre (though I&rsquo;ll try to avoid &lsquo;Gypsies&rsquo; as a villainous group) and a whole lot of expansionary material.

This is a roleplaying game system meant for, uh, roleplaying. Other games have cutesy acronyms for their names, but not NAA! It's got a downright horrible name. NAA began as a &quot;Spirits of Eden&quot; RPG system. I later realized I would rather make it a more generic system. I designed this system because I wanted to play it. I was feeling a bit dry of feeling for other RPG games so I thought I'd make my own. I thought I would also provide it for free to anyone on my site, so they could play it too if they wanted.<br/><br/>What sets NAA apart from other games? Nothing in particular. This game does not have wiz-bang artwork, laser-guided exception-based design, &quot;old school&quot; design principles that challenge players instead of characters, nor skills and rules for every possible situation, no revolutionary story-gaming design principles, advanced player input technology that allows story to develop throughout play, or quirky dice mechanics never before unleashed upon an unsuspecting public. It does, however, have six sided dice, so it delivers upon the one thing promised by the name. No other dice will ever into this relationship, and you will not have to buy any props in order to play the game. So at the very least, it is a very cheap game to play.<br/><br/>"}}
