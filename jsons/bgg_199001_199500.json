It follows the story of the tribes of Jacob, having relocated to Egypt during a severe famine. Initially welcomed due to the favor earned by Jacob's son Joseph, generations later forced into slavery by a Pharaoh who no longer remembered or cared for the growing nation of outsiders. The God of Jacob (re-named Israel before his death) hears the plight of the nation, and delivers them out of the hand of Pharaoh through a series of plagues which break down the hardened will of Pharaoh as well as show His power in the eyes of the region. Led by the prophet Moses, the Israelites are granted their freedom, and immediately make their migration (Exodus) back to the land promised them by God. The journey was not a pleasant one. Being in the desert with stressed resources, it often led to complaining, and sometimes outright rebellion against Moses and God Himself despite leading and providing for them.<br/><br/>This game is for 2-4 players, and at essence is a roll-and move game suitable for children. However there are also several elements of choice involved, and anyone with an interest in the Exodus story would enjoy following the path of the Israelites and being re-acquainted with the joys and pitfalls experienced along the way. The game can accommodate non-readers and readers alike, and has been designed to be playable independent of direct parental supervision.

Each counter should be placed on its appropriate slot, according to the shape and color of the room.<br/>How to do it? Each turn a player move his own cat (the one corresponding to the color of his room&rsquo;s frame) and according to the his counters he chooses the room where hiding the cat. If he chooses his own room then he can place the cat on any slot of his choice. But if he chooses to move his cat to a room controlled by an opponent, it&rsquo;s up to the owner to choose where to place it.<br/><br/>When your cat is placed on a slot that corresponds to one of your hideout counters (according to the shape and color of the room), discover it and place it on the corresponding position; but remember, each room cannot host more than one cat because they are not willing to share a territory. If you place your cat on a board occupied by another cat, the brawl starts.<br/><br/>After this phase starts the &ldquo;Housekeeper moment&ldquo;.<br/>The current player rolls a die. All players compete to grab the matching colored kitten, wherever it is. The fastest hand moves the caught kitten to the garden and pass one of his remained counters, of his choice, to the player with less counters.

When matching sides of two opponent warriors are aligned, they can do battle. The trait scores determine the handicap of the fight, but rolls of the dice determine the victor.<br/><br/>Will your team be the last one standing?<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": {"309668": "First edition"}, "age": "8", "name": "Warrior Clash", "playingtime": "60", "boardgamemechanic": {"2072": "Dice Rolling"}, "average": "0", "usersrated": "0", "boardgamefamily": {"22184": "Admin: Unreleased Games"}}, "199062": {"rpg": {"356": "Generic / Universal"}, "poll": {}, "name": "Generic Village 01", "rpgproducer": {"75191": "P\u00e4r Lindstr\u00f6m"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2996729.jpg", "usersrated": "0", "rpgitemversion": {"309669": "PDF version"}, "average": "0", "statistics": {}, "rpggenre": {"961": "Fantasy"}, "rpgcategory": {"2086": "Accessory (dice, maps, screens, cards)"}, "rpgseries": {"26207": "Imaginary Maps"}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2996729_t.jpg", "description": "From publisher blurb:<br/><br/>This map package includes a generic village that you can use in your adventures.

The Xbox version includes all of the levels from both of the PC games. As a result, weapons from The Second Encounter were added to the levels that were part of The First Encounter on PC. The levels were made smaller by removing the areas outside of the playing area. Unlike the PC version, Sam can't exit too far out of the playing area. This is due to the smaller amount of memory available in the Xbox. The gameplay was given a more arcade touch. A life system was implemented into the single-player game making use of the score. Every 100,000 points grants the player a new life, which allows respawning at the place of death rather than at a save point. Combo points were added for killing multiple enemies at the same time, which allows the player to increase his/her score at a fast pace.

On a 5x6 square grid board, players have five hare tiles each. Their goal is to capture four of their opponent's hares or to occupy their opponent's burrow for one turn. There are three types of hares, which determine their movement directions allowed, and each type has a flip side that alters its direction. You may flip your tile by consuming one turn, or moving into a special square.<br/><br/>This intellectual game is suitable for those who began to enjoy thinking.<br/><br/>There are two editions of the game. The original Version was produced for the Spring 2015 Tokyo Game Market (TGM). Each TGM, designers are invited to face a challenge, to design a game under certain conditions. This is where the &yen;500 microgames came from, which included Love Letter. The Spring 2015 TGM challenge was '2\u7a2e\u30ab\u30fc\u30c9\u30b2\u30fc\u4f01\u753b' which was to bring games using only two types of cards. The first edition of Eat Or Eaten was produced to satisfy the 2\u7a2e\u30ab\u30fc\u30c9\u30b2\u30fc\u4f01\u753b challenge. The components were only cards and the field was only 3 x 4 square. The Hares behaved differently between editions too. In the first edition, when a Hare was flipped over, it changed the power relationship with opponents' Hares, leading to a fourway stand-off. In the second edition, produced for the Autumn 2015 TGM, the Hares have equal power, but flipping a Hare changes the way it moves. In both Versions, the Hares are competing for food.<br/><br/>Publisher's summary<br/>\u3046\u3055\u304e\u306e\u990c\u5834\u4e89\u3044\u3092\u30c6\u30fc\u30de\u306b\u3057\u305f\u3001\u4e8c\u4eba\u7528\u306e\u30a2\u30d6\u30b9\u30c8\u30e9\u30af\u30c8\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u3067\u3059\u3002\uff15\u5339\u306e\u3046\u3055\u304e\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u3066\u4e89\u3044\u3001\u76f8\u624b\u306e\u5de3\u7a74\u30de\u30b9\u306b\uff11\u30bf\u30fc\u30f3\u7559\u307e\u308b\u304b\u3001\u76f8\u624b\u306e\u3046\u3055\u304e\u3092\uff11\u5339\u306b\u3059\u308b\u3068\u52dd\u5229\u3057\u307e\u3059\u3002\u99d2\u306f\u88cf\u8fd4\u3059\u3053\u3068\u306b\u3088\u3063\u3066\u3001\u52d5\u304d\u65b9\u304c\u5909\u5316\u3057\u307e\u3059\u3002\u982d\u3092\u3057\u3063\u304b\u308a\u3068\u4f7f\u3046\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u3067\u3001\u8003\u3048\u308b\u3053\u3068\u304c\u697d\u3057\u304f\u306a\u3063\u3066\u304d\u305f\u65b9\u306b\u304a\u3059\u3059\u3081\u3067\u3059\u3002<br/><br/>"}, "199133": {"rpg": {"25418": "5e Game System Product (D&D 5th Edition Compatible)"}, "poll": {}, "name": "Faerie Passions (5E)", "rpgproducer": {"67321": "Timothy K.

The system provides the player with a large array of moves and combos, and multi-step throws are available, though both normal and multi-throws can be countered by pressing a button that flashes on the screen. Game speed is rather slow (one of the reasons for it not to become an arcade game), and relies more on timing, strategy and accurate knowledge of attack ranges to land successful combo strings and juggles. Button-mashing is often a bad tactical choice, since the characters remain vulnerable for long times after performing an unsuccessful combo. Jumping is realistic, albeit for some extra height. Sidestepping is allowed but is a much slower move, aside from some characters who integrate special sidesteps in their movesets.<br/>The guard button acts rather as a &quot;dodge&quot; button, as the characters' animation shows them avoiding the attacks rather than taking them on their guard. Characters may assume rapidly a counter-offensive position or be &quot;bounced back&quot; to dodge, and the recovery time relies on the player's ability to press the guard button with sufficient time. Low attacks must be guarded by pressing Down + Guard Button, while pressing Up + Guard Button may allow the character to sidestep at the end of a combo.<br/>The Arcade game structure of Kensei comprises 10 stages, with the first eight being made up of random opponents. The specific playing character will encounter a sub-boss in the ninth stage while the tenth one will have them facing off against the crime lord Leimeng and the eleventh (and final) one will have the playing character battle against Leimeng's bodyguard Kaiya. Along with the classical Survival, Training, and Time Attack modes, a special mini-game can be activated once all characters have been unlocked: it's a &quot;racing&quot; mode where the player controls a character and makes it run through a circuit, using button mashing to gain speed.&quot;<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;[en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kensei%3A_Sacred_Fist Kensei: Sacred Fist]&quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "199142": {"poll": {}, "name": "Rustle: the Card Game", "playingtime": "60", "minplayers": "3", "boardgamemechanic": {"2040": "Hand Management"}, "yearpublished": "0", "usersrated": "3", "boardgamefamily": {"22184": "Admin: Unreleased Games"}, "maxplayers": "5", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3021009_t.jpg", "average": "6.33333", "statistics": {}, "boardgamepublisher": {"4": {"name": "(Self-Published)"}}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3021009.jpg", "boardgameversion": {"309799": "First edition"}, "maxplaytime": "60", "boardgamecategory": {"1089": {"name": "Animals"}}, "age": "0", "minplaytime": "20", "description": "Rustle: the Card Game is a card drawing farm animal themed game where the goal is to possess the most points by the end of the game.

It is a genre inspired<br/>by steampunk, but one that took a radically different turn, both in terms of culture and technology. While it certainly has some similarities to steampunk as a genre, stormpunk trades steampunk's monocle, Victorian sensibilities, and top hat for a drinking horn, a gear-shaped torque, and a gun-sword. It embraces electricity, but throws off the yoke of Earth's normal history and asks the question&mdash;what if Tesla had been a magician? What if magic and electricity had developed side by side? What if &quot;steam&quot; had lost the technological race and man learned to call power from the very sky itself? All of these questions, alongside the explorations they give birth to, are what give life to stormpunk.<br/><br/>Well, that's how I describe it in the book, at least. The fact is, Stormpunk for me is something intensely personal and, in its own way, an extension of my own exploration into alternate fantasy futures, a sort of &quot;what if&quot; that plays out in my own pet universe. Except I've invited all of you to come and play, too.<br/><br/>Cheers,<br/>Jaye<br/><br/>(and yes, if this looks similar to what exists on the Rhune page it is, because I copied it here for consistency). ;)<br/><br/>"}, "199188": {"rpg": {"2791": "Pathfinder System Compatible Product"}, "statistics": {}, "name": "Technology Unleashed", "rpgproducer": {"15781": "Christopher A.

Really difficult. Not only are there complicated incantations and gesticulations involved, but a wizard has to be able to draw power out of the very air while remembering to do everything just so. Failure generally means explosions. A large number of bright, if methodical, individuals who would otherwise make excellent wizards are locked out of their desired profession by these mental gymnastics that reward the quick mind rather than the contemplative mind. Luckily, there exists a path for them.<br/><br/>Rune magic removes the temporal connection between going through the motions of a spell and drawing energy from the air to power it. By etching, painting, or carving complicated runes ahead of time, a runesmith prepares devices that channel magical energy for him, thus rewarding the methodical over the agile. All a runesmith need do is pump the rune full of energy and aim.<br/><br/>This reliance on physical objects for spellcasting may be a bit of an Achilles heel, but it is also the means to a unique specialization. As the absolute masters of magic with and upon &quot;stuff&quot;, the runesmith is an accomplished warder and manufacturer of temporary magic items. While he may not warp reality as does a wizard, a party with a runesmith will never want for constantly-shifting equipment.<br/><br/>Product Features<br/><br/>    The runesmith base class, featuring a new system of magic with tiered runes in two styles of casting: equipment and projection<br/>    Three archetypes - the campaigner, the forgemaster, and the projectionist<br/>    11 feats<br/>    Nearly 200 rune variants, ranging from boots that grant bonus kick attacks to a hat that unleashes guard dogs on command<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>"}, "199198": {"rpgitemversion": {"324360": "ePUB Version"}, "statistics": {}, "name": "Zarrakan: Where the Adventure Never Ends (2015)", "rpgproducer": {"41128": "Andrew James Carvin"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2999581.jpg", "usersrated": "0", "average": "0", "rpggenre": {"173": "Generic / Universal"}, "rpg": {"7794": "Zarrakan"}, "rpgcategory": {"2083": "Core Rules (min needed to play)"}, "poll": {}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2999581_t.jpg", "description": "Where the Adventure Never Ends<br/><br/>From the introduction:<br/><br/>Zarrakan is a diceless narrative role-playing game (RPG) with no set genre that focuses more on storytelling than detailed rules.<br/><br/>User summary:<br/><br/>This version of the game core rules document corrects several errors present in the prior version (notably, the typographical error on the cover), as well as several simplifications.

Faced with this sudden threat, even your once friendly neighbors seem to have turned against you as they withdraw to their keeps to defend their own frightened kingdoms, focusing on their own villages and tower.<br/><br/>Your kingdom is at siege by the living dead. You raise troops, build walls, lay traps, prepare magical spells and even wake your pet dragon. Hopefully they can be slowed, or if you're devilishly crafty, they can be turned toward those traitorous adjoining kingdoms. In this battle, your best asset is your brave and proud hero, who stands ready to slay those piles of walking bones. Alas, he can't fight everywhere, so if things get truly desperate, you could offer them your treasure to get some relief.<br/><br/>The ivory invaders want somewhere to call their own to live out their death in peace, and they have their eye sockets on you!

The invasion cannot be defeated, so you must outlast your opponents to win the day. At your disposal are a range of weapons that defeat, slow, or even deflect the skeletons towards the other players. The game ends when one player's tower or village is wiped out.<br/><br/>A game turn takes place in four phases:<br/><br/>1] Hero Movement and Combat: Move your hero and eliminate the skeletons from the destination square.<br/>2) Trap Placement: Place or remove traps on your personal board.<br/>3) Skeletons Move: Move the skeletons forward, damaging your tower or your village if they move far enough.<br/>4) Skeletons Spawn: Place new skeletons among the streams and on the edges of the player boards.<br/><br/>Each phase happens simultaneously for all players on their own player board, which means a game with up to eight players can take only thirty minutes. Multiple copies of the game can be combined to play with as many players as you have space for, and the game can also be played solo.

However, no player knows any player's identity, including themselves, and their identities often change.<br/><br/>Each player is dealt one identity card: Hero, Satan, Hero's friend, or Satan's servant. During your turn, you can gain a clue by looking at another player's card or by exchanging your card with other player's. When a player looks at another player's card, that player's comment or expression can also be a clue.<br/><br/>Only the Hero can defeat Satan, so even if you know who Satan is, you cannot defeat Satan until you have the Hero card, and vice versa.

It's designed to avoid analysis paralysis and avalanching by favoring the defender and easing the pressure of each move - all while still keeping the strategic depth of Chess. It also has a bunch of fun unique pieces. The main difference from Chess is that players can chose to upgrade pieces or even put new pieces on the board.<br/><br/>There is a risk versus reward mechanic as higher value pieces limit the player's ability to upgrade and make new units. On the flip side, losing a high value piece may actually be an opportunity in disguise. It frees up the player to be able to place new pieces, which makes recovering easy. Also since you can place pieces anywhere on your own side, you can really easily block a checkmate. The increased complexity introduced by upgrading and placing new units makes it essentially becomes impossible to predict your opponent more than a few moves in advance. Each move is important, but not crushingly so. Each player feels like they have a chance to win up until the very end.<br/><br/>There are two modes of play. The default mode plays the most like Chess. In it, the goal is simply to force a checkmate on the opponent. When pieces are captured, they are removed from play, so each player only has a set amount of pieces to work with. In the other mode, players earn points for each piece they capture. Captured pieces go back into the player's pool. The goal of the game is to capture 100 points worth of their opponent's pieces without losing their King.<br/><br/>"}, "199265": {"rpg": {"35353": "The Last Hour"}, "poll": {}, "name": "The Last Words of Dutch Schultz", "rpgproducer": {"46142": "Clark B.

I have always been an avid rally and all around race fan. I started to design a game based on what I wanted a table racing game to be and something that I had never played before. Once, I got together with Ben M, the game really started to pick up steam. He brought the same passion I had for making a fun and exciting table top rally game. When we decided to bring on randomly laid out stages every time you play, dice driven events and a driver confidence system really brought the project to life.<br/><br/>Playing a different track varies the game dramatically. Never again will you have to have to play the same board over and over again or are you forced to spend money to buy a new track, just to add variety. The confidence system allows the player to push their luck with a smaller risk of an event happening, but the catch is that you only have a limited number of confidence points to start the entire rally with. The points are also carried over stage to stage, so you have to be careful not to use all yours up at the beginning or you won't have any left for later stages. This really helps to determine how hard you want to attack a turn or how fast you want to push your driver. You also get penalties for running out of confidence, so that is always on your mind. There are various ways to regain confidence points and also many ways to lose them. During Event rolls you might gain more back by taking a turn perfectly or lose a point for botching it.  At the end of each Stage the players each get four driver points to spend to repair drivetrain or add confidence points. You can also use those to buy more Pace cards. Pace cards are various cards that the players can use to benefit themselves or play against their opponents. There are six, six sided dice that the players use to play out events throughout Rally On. Each die side has a unique symbol that corresponds to an event that could happen to player. Some are good and some are bad. Depending on how hard you are pushing your driver determines how many dice you will be rolling for the event. You could come out a head and gain a few extra movement spaces, shave some time off your current run, damage your car, lose time or wreck. Don't forget you always can use your precious confidence points to re-roll an event die if needed.<br/><br/>The goal of Rally On is to complete each stage of the rally with the least amount of time ticks. It is meant to be played as a three stage rally, but you can do less. At the start of each turn the player decides if they will up shift or downshift their gear. Once that is determined they roll the corresponding gear die. They then move that number of spaces on the stage. Each time the player comes up to a turn tile they have to decide which lane to take the turn in. Each lane has a maximum gear the player can enter in. The player has the option to attack the turn in the inside lane or outside lane. The inside lane is usually safer, but slower. The outside lane will be faster but adds a higher chance of rolling a bad event, due to rolling a higher number of event dice. This makes the outside lane a higher risk and you could potentially take damage, slide, spin off track, lose time or even gain confidence for a perfect turn. At the end of each stage the players tally their time. The player with the least amount of time wins that current stage.<br/><br/>"}, "199377": {"rpg": {"25418": "5e Game System Product (D&D 5th Edition Compatible)"}, "statistics": {}, "name": "Binding Arbitration", "rpgproducer": {"18071": "Shauna Wolf Narciso"}, "usersrated": "0", "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3005284.jpg", "rpgitemversion": {"310149": "PDF Version"}, "rpgsetting": {"196": "Forgotten Realms"}, "average": "0", "rpggenre": {"155": "Fantasy (High Fantasy)"}, "rpgcategory": {"2084": "Scenario / Adventure / Module"}, "poll": {}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3005284_t.jpg", "description": "Can't we all just get along?<br/><br/>From the introduction:<br/><br/>Two wizards are engaged in a long-running feud.

Most Florentine guilds performed such activities, but the Calimala distinguished itself from other guilds through the number and prestige of the projects and the sites administered, including the construction and decoration of some of the major churches of the city.<br/><br/>Players of Calimala are cloth merchants in medieval Florence, with a number of trusted employees that they assign to various streets within the city to carry out actions.

Otherwise, the weather, animals and other gardeners can destroy the garden. In this war over the garden, there is no compromise, no surrender. You either win or become rabbit food.<br/><br/>This game uses the Looney Pyramids, some dice and a checkerboard to recreate the sense of total victory of your crop surviving while others fail.<br/><br/>Included with the Kickstarter shipment of Pyramid Arcade as one of the twelve bonus Looney Pyramid cards created for $333 level backers.<br/><br/>Number of Players: 2 or 4<br/><br/>Equipment: Timer (optional), 8x8 board, a rainbow stash per player (up to four), a Pyramid die and a Color die<br/><br/>Who Starts: The player who has spent the most time in a garden goes first. If it is a tie, rock-paper-scissors to see who goes first.<br/><br/>Setup: For a two player game, set up the a chessboard with one red trio and one yellow trio on one corner of the board just off the side of the board (they represent the carrots) &amp; one green trio and one blue trio on the opposite corner of the board just off the side of the board (they represent the broccoli). Place the remaining red, yellow, green, and blue pyramids off the board at a neutral corner.<br/><br/>On the diagonal of the board in between the two players, form a line of random black pyramids. One pyramid per space. There should be an empty square at the corners of the board. The black pyramids represent the garden wall. For a four player game, set up the chessboard with each color at a corner just off the board. Form an x of black pyramids in the middle of the board. One pyramid per space. There should be an empty square at the corners of the board.<br/><br/>Each of the open spaces represents a part of the backyard. Place two of the same color trios off each side of the board near the opening of each of the x sections, touching the edge. The remaining trios should be accessible to the other players off the side of the board.<br/><br/>Gameplay: The first player rolls the Color and the Pyramid die. The player selects the pyramid based on the color and size rolled on the dice. If the dice roll shows two pieces, select one of the two pieces. If the dice roll shows the atom (*), select any color. You may place that pyramid any square on the board that does not have a pyramid already. This represents planting the seed in the garden.<br/><br/>If you roll black, you may move one of the black pyramids from the wall that matches the pyramid from the other dice. The black pyramid can only be moved one orthogonal space and must be no more than two squares away from the other black pyramids.<br/><br/>If your roll matches a combination that is already on the board, you may move one of the pyramids one square orthogonally on the board. If there is already a pyramid on that square, a player can not move into that square. If the pyramid was moved by the previous player, it can not be moved this turn.<br/><br/>Winning: During a two player game, the player wins when they have ten of their pyramids in their corner of the chessboard. All of the pieces must be orthogonally touching with one of the pieces in the corner of the board. In addition, all of the pieces must be on the same side of the wall. If a piece in on the wall line, it does not count as being on your side of the wall.<br/><br/>During a four player game, the player wins when they have ten of their pyramids in their side of the yard.

Of course, such experience and versatility comes at a price, so captains are going to want more than the retainer given to most soldiers &ndash; they want a cut of the treasure! Also included in this expansion are three new scenarios designed to give soldiers more of a chance to shine. All feature some type of limitation or obstacle to spellcasting that will force wizards to think a bit more about how much they rely on their magic.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": {"310203": "ePub version"}, "name": "Frostgrave: Sellsword", "playingtime": "120", "boardgamemechanic": {"2001": "Action Point Allowance System"}, "age": "12", "boardgameexpansion": {}, "usersrated": "9", "expands": {"177354": {"name": "Frostgrave"}}, "average": "7.77778"}, "199412": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3012201.jpg", "poll": {}, "boardgamedesigner": {"15770": {"name": "Joseph McCullough"}}, "statistics": {}, "boardgamecompilation": {"222317": "The Frostgrave Folio"}, "yearpublished": "2016", "maxplayers": "2", "boardgameartist": {"3": "(Uncredited)"}, "boardgamepublisher": {"7360": {"name": "Osprey Publishing"}}, "maxplaytime": "120", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3012201_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "60", "boardgamecategory": {"1017": {"name": "Dice"}}, "description": "From the publisher:<br/><br/>Dark Alchemy is an ebook only mini-expansion for Frostgrave that includes a three-scenario campaign which can be played by either solo by one player or by two players working co-operatively.

There is also a grand campaign game, utilizing 14 of the scenarios linked together, as well as a Company Game (play a single scenario four times, one per platoon in your company).  There are enough individual soldiers--using men from this expansion, along with those from PBI: Somme--to form an entire company of 180 individual soldiers (with men left to spare).  Finally, notes about British Army organization in 1916, and a section devoted to Battle Plans and Combat Details provide you with background information to help bring the game (and history) alive.<br/><br/>With this expansion, you will have scenarios covering each of the fourteen British divisions involved on the first day of the Big Push.
