Only one gets to be called the Number One Killer. Enough said.<br/><br/>Hitman Holiday is game of deduction and strategy where as many as up to ten players take on the roles of ten of the deadliest assassins mankind has ever known. Gathered at the world's most beautiful resort, otherwise known as Paradise, they are out to play a game of death in a bid to eliminate competition in business as well as claim the much coveted title of Number One.<br/><br/>A truly unique game, one may say it is what happens when Cluedo meets Battlestar Galactica meets Werewolf. The game begins with each player having a secret target to assassinate. The fun part is that the targets do not know yet which player is targeting them. This means that while you are trying to find a way to secretly kill off your assigned target, somewhere out there among the players is also someone trying to kill you, and it is up to you to find out who before it is too late! This is all done at the resort, which provides a ton of ways to kill someone, such as shoving them off a balcony, or dropping that accidental flower pot from three stories above. The game also takes on a different angle from the generic James Bond killer image, presenting its killers from all walks of life, even including old women and innocent looking young ladies. Instead of purely guns, they also use almost anything around the resort, turning innocent objects into lethal weapons.<br/><br/>This game is highly recommended for players who enjoy hidden actions, and having to deduce who is killing who based on clues that drop now and then. Observing how each player behaves on the board also gives away clues sometimes as to whether or not they are your assigned killer. A must-have for assassin fans!<br/><br/>WARNING: This game is highly strategic and can induce Analysis Paralysis. If your gaming group is new to strategy, it is highly recommended to go no more than 7 players per session as the more players there are, the longer the downtime.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": ["First edition"], "average": "5.86458", "name": "Hitman Holiday", "playingtime": "60", "boardgamemechanic": ["Hand Management", "Memory", "Player Elimination", "Point to Point Movement"], "age": "12", "usersrated": "24", "boardgamefamily": ["Admin: Unreleased Games", "Crowdfunding: Kickstarter"], "boardgamepodcastepisode": ["Dice Tower News 376 - March 6, 2015"]}, "166049": {"rpgartist": ["Aaron Acevedo", "Jason Engle"], "rpg": ["Pathfinder System Compatible Product"], "poll": [], "name": "Isle of the Frog God (Pathfinder)", "rpgdesigner": ["David Jarvis"], "rpgproducer": ["Aaron Acevedo", "Mike Chaney", "Genevra Harker", "Miles M.

A KILL refers to the elimination of another enemy player by reducing his/her LIFE to 0 during a player&rsquo;s turn. If a player is self-eliminated due to an unfulfilled deck out cost, this will not be considered a KILL. The eliminating player will get all remaining Oinks of the eliminated player. The game ends when it is evident that it is not possible to score more KILLs than any leading player who will become the winner. If all players are self-eliminated or there are players tied with equal number of KILLs, the last player to deck out will be the winner of the game.<br/><br/>Players start the game by each drawing a card from the top of a common shuffled DECK. The player with the highest number starts first and the players get their turns in a clockwise manner. The drawn cards go back to the bottom of the DECK. In the case of ties, the tied players draw again till the turns are resolved. Each player may attack each other according to the rules as described in TKG ARENA: Rise of the Magi.<br/><br/>The FULL SPELL DECK is shuffled and the top 5 cards are drawn and placed face up. During a player&rsquo;s turn, he/she may choose to expend 1 Oink in acquiring a special card of the same element among these 5 cards. The special card replaces its counterpart card (of the same ELEMENT and FACE VALUE) and the counterpart card is removed from play in the game. After replacement, the DECK is reshuffled. The acquired special card(s) goes to the bottom of his/her DECK and the player draws sufficiently from his/her DECK to recover his/her hand to 5 cards.<br/><br/>If a counterpart card is in a player&rsquo;s CURRENT HAND during his/her turn to acquire spells, the player may acquire it without cost. A player may make as many acquisitions as long as he/she has the necessary counterparts in his/her CURRENT HAND. If there are no counterparts cards in his/her CURRENT HAND, the player may still acquire the special card(s) by expending the appropriate cost as above. In addition, the player must end his/her turn immediately after the transaction. If the player does not acquire any special card(s) during his/her turn, he/she can choose to engage in battle with any other player in the group and the same rules of engagement (for the usual 2-player mode) apply including the use of the CHARGE BAR.<br/><br/>Every time a special card is acquired by a player, another is drawn from the FULL SPELL DECK pile to replace it. If a cycle of turns (from player back to the same player) passes with no players acquiring any special cards, all the available 5 special cards will be placed at the bottom of the FULL SPELL DECK pile and another 5 new ones are drawn.<br/><br/>Players may wish to use their own customised DECK in tournament mode for this scenario and omit the oracle (spell source) altogether.

Country Clubs will now be able to house up to 100 members, and a customizable day/night cycle is also included. A new &quot;Quick Tournament&quot; mode was also added, which simulates only the final round of a tournament.<br/><br/>For the first time ever in the series, Tiger Woods PGA Tour 14 also adds support for playoffs in tournaments; Tiburon's developers considered the lack of support for playoffs to be a &quot;long overdue&quot; addition due to its complexity, as all of the playoff formats used by each Major tournament are implemented in-game. Due to complex issues surrounding player licensing and outcomes for playoffs, the strokes of other players are not shown.<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;Tiger Woods PGA Tour 14&quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "166118": {"poll": [], "name": "Darkfall Unholy Wars", "videogamemode": ["Network Multiplayer"], "videogameversion": ["Windows download edition"], "average": "0", "videogametheme": ["Fantasy"], "usersrated": "0", "videogamedeveloper": ["Aventurine S.A."], "videogamegenre": ["Action RPG", "MMO", "RPG"], "videogameplatform": ["Windows"], "statistics": [], "videogamepublisher": ["Aventurine S.A."], "description": "Darkfall Unholy Wars is a massively multiplayer online role-playing game developed by Aventurine SA. It was announced on 18 September and is a sequel to Darkfall. It is a PvP MMORPG where players are encouraged to form clans and battle for dominance across Agon, the fantasy world in which the game takes place.<br/><br/>The initial launch date was 20 November 2012, but it was postponed.<br/><br/>On 28 November 2012, Darkfall Unholy Wars was submitted on Steam Greenlight. Two days later, the game was greenlit by the community.<br/><br/>On 11 December, Aventurine announced another launch delay due a several internal and external factors. Instead of commercial release, the company decided to offer beta access to all customers who would pre-order the game. After a lengthy 5-month beta, the game was released on 16 April 2013.<br/><br/>Interface<br/><br/>The Darkfall Unholy Wars Graphical User Interface was mostly based on First-person shooter and action games.<br/><br/>Character progression<br/><br/>The character progression system in Darkfall Unholy Wars is based on prowess. Prowess can be gained from any game interaction. The amount of prowess that a player gains depends on the difficulty or rarity of each achievement. It can be used as a form of currency to acquire different skills and boosters while spending prowess is the only way to improve the character's attributes, combat, and harvesting skills.<br/><br/>Roles and skills<br/><br/>The new roles system introduced in Darkfall Unholy Wars requires the player to pick up a role, along with 2 schools from that specific role. One of the schools is set by the player as the primary and the other as the secondary, and each school contains 4 skills/spells, and the ultimate, the most powerful in that school.The biggest difference between the primary and secondary schools is that you can only use the ultimate from your primary school. The skills/spells available in the secondary school have full potential, but require more mana and stamina, and have increased cooldowns and charging times compared to the primaries.<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;Darkfall Unholy Wars&quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "166119": {"rpgdesigner": ["Grayson Arango", "Stephen R.

The player assumes the role of a commander of an Infantry Platoon during its grueling and miserable turn in the Trenches before they are relieved. As the Platoon Leader, you are responsible for securing your Sector of Front by successfully taking enemy positions and defending yours with the least amount of casualties. Although there are many support units available to you, they may often times be limited to you by political, logistical or geographical obstacles.<br/><br/>GAME OBJECTIVE: The objective of Trench War is to successfully survive a Tour in the trenches along the Western Front during World War I. A Tour consists of a number of Rotations in the Trenches. The Player can play a Short Tour (1 Rotation), an Average Tour (2 Rotations) or a Long Tour (3 Rotations). Each Rotation consists of making a Rotation Deck of 20 &ldquo;Trench War&rdquo; Cards and once all Trench War Cards have been drawn and resolved, the Rotation is over and the Player totals his Rotation VP and adds it to his Tour VP. Once all Rotations have been completed, the Player totals his Tour VP and then compares it to the Victory Determination Table to determine the level of success.<br/><br/>GAME FEATURES: Trench War features plenty of colorful Game Counters, Map and Battle Mat, used for resolving Combat. The Game provides plenty of grim themes associated with the War in the Trenches. Counters include Infantry Soldiers, HMGs, Flamethrowers, MK-IV Tanks, A7 Tanks, FT-17 Tanks, Pillboxes, Aircraft, Sub-Machineguns and Light Machineguns.<br/>If you enjoy movies like &quot;All Quiet on the Western Front&quot;, &quot;The Lost Batallion&quot;, &quot;Sergeant York&quot;, &quot;Westfront 1917&quot; or World War One in general, you will enjoy this game.<br/><br/>"}, "166141": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic5164.jpg", "poll": [], "boardgamedesigner": ["C.

It should come as no surprise, then, that wizards, witches, and other powerful spellcasters are always on the lookout for new and exciting spells to add to their repertoires. While many spells from the Pathfinder Roleplaying Game Core Rulebook received a facelift and an upgrade in Mythic Adventures, the sourcebook that introduced mythic power to the game of Pathfinder, dozens of spells were left behind. Missing Mythic Magic Volume IX, and its predecessors, aim to give each and every spell from the core rules a full-fledged mythic upgrade, all the way from A to Z, with a special focus on making mythic spells that feel as over-the-top and larger-than-life as possible.<br/><br/>This installment includes 19 mythic spells, from gate to helping hand. A mythic gate allows you to restrict which creatures can and can&rsquo;t pass through it, and, with the expenditure of additional mythic power, can open to other locations on the same plane, and be held open for hours. They can even be used as weapons, slicing into the fabric of reality in the middle of creatures or objects and rending them asunder. A mythic gentle repose is actually capable of undoing the damage decay has inflicted on a corpse, or, when augmented, can forever preserve the corpse in miniature form. Mythic ghoul touch not only lasts longer and has a wider-reaching stench, but with extra mythic power, it can become contagious, spreading from creature to creature.

Grab your wire cutters and steady that shaky hand, because it&rsquo;s going to be an explosive night!<br/><br/>In Bomb Squad Academy there are four decks of cards representing the four &ldquo;wires&rdquo; of the bomb, and a trigger track next to each deck. Every round, each player secretly decides (then simultaneously reveals) the wire that they will cut this round (or perhaps they&rsquo;ll chicken out, or even call &ldquo;Wait!&rdquo; preventing a wire from being cut). After actions are revealed, the chosen wires are &ldquo;cut&rdquo; by flipping cards from those decks. When a card is flipped, its value dictates how far the trigger moves down the trigger track and how many points are earned; cutting wires alone is worth a lot more than cutting the same wire as other players. Push the triggers too far and the bomb will explode! Whoever causes the bomb to explode loses points. Players earn useful Tools during the game that they can use to break the rules.

One minute before close, the door swings open. Outside, you see parked school buses and a line of people all the way to the street corner! The high school girl&rsquo;s volleyball tournament has just gotten out, and everyone is craving a smoothie for the ride home. Becca cuts a deal: whoever blends the most smoothies tonight gets free smoothies for a month!<br/><br/>The Blend Off has begun, and only one can win. There&rsquo;s just one problem: Kevin. Skittish at best on normal days, he flies into a frenzy, grabbing fruit for you from the fridge at random. Grab the fruit, complete the Orders, and blend your way to victory!<br/><br/><br/>Overview<br/><br/>Blend Off! is a game of skill and speed for two to four players from designer Scot Eaton. Master Mixers roll the die (Kevin) to collect fruit to fill Orders from the deck (Becca). When a Master Mixer's fruit matches the Order, they can blend the ingredients and claim the Order for gold stars. There are no turns; everyone plays at the same time in a race for the finish. The winner is the player with the most gold stars at the end of the game.<br/><br/><br/>Gameplay<br/><br/>The actions the player may take at any time are: Collect, Blend, Dump, and Blunder.<br/><br/>Collect - Roll your die to send Kevin to the fridge for fruit. You may take one of the fruit from the table and put it on one of your Blenders. You don&rsquo;t have to take the fruit; you may reroll the dice until Kevin brings you what you want.<br/><br/>Dump - You may dump the fruit out of one of your Blenders. Because the fruit is already mixed together, you may not dump just one or two ingredients; you must dump the whole Blender. You may, however, choose to dump one Blender into another, combining ingredients.<br/><br/>Blend - When the fruit in one of your Blenders matches the recipe on one of the faceup Orders, shout out &ldquo;Blend!&rdquo;<br/><br/>Blunder - If you catch another player make a mistake like calling &ldquo;Blend!&rdquo; with wrong or extra ingredients in their Blender, shout &ldquo;Blunder!&rdquo; They must correct their mistake by dumping their Blender and, returning the Order card for their botched recipe to Becca&rsquo;s deck.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": ["English first edition", "English second edition"], "name": "Blend Off!", "playingtime": "15", "boardgamemechanic": ["Dice Rolling", "Hand Management"], "age": "6", "boardgameexpansion": ["221134"], "usersrated": "56", "average": "6.74911", "boardgamepodcastepisode": ["Episode 98- Yokohama"]}, "166211": {"boardgamedesigner": ["Marcell Nemes"], "average": "5", "poll": [], "name": "Hexagonal Wars", "playingtime": "90", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": ["Action / Movement Programming", "Area Control / Area Influence", "Co-operative Play", "Deck / Pool Building", "Grid Movement"], "yearpublished": "2014", "usersrated": "2", "maxplayers": "4", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2562387_t.jpg", "boardgameartist": ["Marcell Nemes"], "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["(Self-Published)", "(Web published)", "The Game Crafter, LLC"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2562387.jpg", "boardgameversion": ["Game Crafter green-yellow two players edition", "Game Crafter red-blue two players edition", "Game Crafter two-four player edition", "Print & Play edition"], "maxplaytime": "90", "boardgamecategory": ["Fantasy", "Medieval", "Print & Play"], "age": "12", "minplaytime": "60", "description": "Hexagonal Wars is a flexible strategy game for 2 to 4 players.

It is based on the Black Rock Shooter franchise created by Huke. The game was released in Japan on August 25, 2011. NIS America published the game digitally on the PlayStation Store in North America (United States only) and Europe on April 23 and April 24, 2013 respectively.<br/><br/>Black Rock Shooter: The Game is an action RPG in which players take on the role of the eponymous Black Rock Shooter (BRS for short). The game is divided up into several missions in which the player must clear objectives to progress. On the main overworld, BRS can explore the available areas and look for certain items. Battle begins when the player comes into contact with an enemy on the overworld. During battle, BRS can aim and shoot with her rock cannon at enemies, block against attacks and sidestep to avoid them completely. If the player fires the rock cannon or uses the sidestep too much in a short time, the system will overheat, leaving the player vulnerable to attack until it cools down. Throughout the game, players can earn abilities that can be equipped to BRS and used in battle, each with their own cooldown periods. These include offensive attacks such as a powerful blast, a sniper rifle, or support abilities that can increase BRS' stats such as her attack or defense. Certain sections will also see BRS ride a motorcycle, in which she can attack enemies on either side of her or use weapons to fire in front of enemies.<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;Black Rock Shooter: The Game&quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "166220": {"poll": [], "name": "Class of Heroes 2", "videogamemode": ["Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["PSP Download edition", "PSP Japan Physical edition", "PSP US Physical edition"], "average": "0", "videogameseries": ["Class of Heroes"], "videogametheme": ["Cute Fantasy"], "usersrated": "0", "videogamedeveloper": ["ZeroDiv"], "videogamegenre": ["RPG"], "videogameplatform": ["PSP"], "videogamehonor": ["2013 Operation Rainfall Awards Best PlayStation Handheld Game of the Year Nominee"], "statistics": [], "videogamepublisher": ["Acquire", "MonkeyPaw Games"], "description": "Class of Heroes 2 (\u5263\u3068\u9b54\u6cd5\u3068\u5b66\u5712\u30e2\u30ce\u30022 Ken to Mah\u014d to Gakuenmono Ts\u016b) is the sequel to Class of Heroes released in Japan on June 24, 2009 and includes more jobs and majors for the characters. Recently, a Kickstarter project was initiated by MonkeyPaw Games and Gaijinworks to fund the localization and the production of the sequel's limited edition. Although the project did not fund, MonkeyPaw and Gaijinworks promised to continue the translation and release the game digitally with the game set to be released on PSN in mid 2013, and have started a signup to gauge interest on a possible limited physical release, which would also include a code to obtain the game digitally. The campaign proved successful, with 2700 signing up and even more people pre-ordering the game when the pre-sale started. About 200 physical copies were made available through the Canadian online shop Video Games Plus, the rest of the production run being exclusive to those who had pre-ordered via the Gaijinworks website until May 12, 2013. The copies sold at VGP are limited to one copy per customer and also do not come with download codes for digital copies. Also, fans could vote for the cover artwork used for the physical release, with people who had backed the unsuccessful Kickstarter campaign getting a special cover different from that of the copies pre-ordered on the website. The physical release had to be delayed when players of the digital version that was released on June 4, 2013 reported several bugs. The bugs were later fixed in an update to the digital version on October 15, 2013 and the UMD release started shipping in the same month.

You're eager to improve your own lot in the land by placing envoys and nobles in positions of power in the six regions represented in this game.<br/><br/>The game lasts five rounds with each player having three actions per round. Players take actions in order of their family members on the action board from top to bottom; on a turn you either take a supply action (moving to one side of the action board) or a move/deploy action (moving to the other side).<br/><br/>For a supply action, you pick one of the spaces on the supply table, move the indicated number of envoys and nobles from the province to your personal court, then claim any chests underneath that space. The treasure chests come in different colors, with each color having a different function in the game: the brown treasure chests score points based on how many you collect, the orange ones provide immediate points or figures, the blue ones provide a one-shot bonus, and the purple ones let you collect one of the privilege cards on display. The privilege cards often modify other actions or give you a bonus for doing a particular thing.<br/><br/>For a move/deploy action, you decide which office seat you want to occupy in a particular region. If this seat isn't in the region where the king is located, you need to spend one envoy as you move clockwise away from the king, placing each envoy in the top part of those regions, until you reach the region that you want to occupy. You then pay the cost of the office seat, placing one figure &mdash; possibly a noble if the seat demands it &mdash; in that seat and all the other figures in clockwise order, one per region. When you occupy a seat, you claim the chest underneath it.<br/><br/>After everyone has finished their actions, you score for the round &mdash; but you score only in the region indicated in the current row of scoring tiles (Aachen, Nijmegen, Palermo, etc.) and the region that best meets the condition laid out in a separate part of the current row of scoring tiles (fewest chests, most occupants, where the king is located, etc.) If these two regions turn out to be the same one, you score that region only once. Players score points for having the most office seats in a region (or the second- or thirdmost most office seats) based on the point tile placed in the region at the start of the game. Each region also has a printed bonus that players receive, such as bonus chests or additional envoys.<br/><br/>To end the round, you remove all of the office occupants of the region that scored, add new chests under each office seat in those scoring regions and each space on the supply table, then sweep the king clockwise 1-3 regions. As the king moves, he returns all of the envoys that he encounters in the regions that he enters to their owners. After five rounds, players score for their treasure chests as well as for how well they completed their secret job cards, and the player with the most points wins.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": ["English first edition", "German first edition", "Japanese first edition"], "average": "7.24882", "name": "The Staufer Dynasty", "playingtime": "90", "boardgamemechanic": ["Area Control / Area Influence", "Card Drafting", "Modular Board", "Pattern Building", "Set Collection"], "age": "13", "usersrated": "1347", "boardgamesubdomain": ["Strategy Games"], "boardgamefamily": ["Country: Holy Roman Empire"], "boardgamepodcastepisode": ["Episode 46- Patchistory and RobbCon 2015", "Episode 50- The Staufer Dynasty and Rulebooks", "Episode 9: Panamax, They Live, and Solforge", "Essen 2014 - Hans im Gl\u00fcck", "Heavy Cardboard Episode 30 \u2013 Rococo", "Podcast #080 - Five in Your Face", "What Did You Play This Week Podcast Thing Week 83!"]}, "166227": {"poll": [], "name": "Social Justice Warriors", "videogamemode": ["Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["Linux Downloadable edition", "Macintosh Downloadable edition", "Windows Downloadable edition"], "average": "0", "videogametheme": ["Comedy"], "usersrated": "0", "videogamedeveloper": ["Nonadecimal Creative"], "videogamegenre": ["RPG"], "videogameplatform": ["Linux", "Macintosh", "Windows"], "statistics": [], "videogamepublisher": ["Nonadecimal Creative"], "description": "Social Justice Warriors is a satirical role-playing game that transforms you into a crusader for online morality, a champion of internet justice, and the lone defender standing valiantly against the encroaching morass of willful human ignorance.<br/><br/>Inspired by the ridiculous list of &ldquo;social justice warrior&rdquo; videogame journalists to avoid, Social Justice Warriors translates the standard medieval fantasy heroes of role-playing games into social media crusaders facing an endless horde of ignorant, bigoted internet trolls.<br/><br/>Source: The Developer Website.<br/><br/>"}, "166228": {"poll": [], "name": "Astroloco: Worst Contact", "videogamemode": ["Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["Windows Downloadable edition"], "average": "0", "videogametheme": ["Comedy", "Space"], "usersrated": "0", "videogamedeveloper": ["Hungry Planet Games"], "videogamegenre": ["Adventure"], "videogameplatform": ["Windows"], "statistics": [], "videogamepublisher": ["Hungry Planet Games"], "description": "A hilarious new point &amp; click adventure from Hungry Planet Games!<br/><br/>Features<br/>Trains in space!<br/>Feature-length, compelling story.<br/>Classic 1990s adventure gameplay!<br/>Two playable characters!<br/>Full voice-acting!<br/>Did we mention there are trains in space?!<br/><br/>Source: The Developer Website.<br/><br/>"}, "166229": {"poll": [], "name": "Three Fourths Home", "videogamemode": ["Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["Linux Downloadable edition", "Macintosh Downloadable edition", "PlayStation 4 Downloadable edition", "PlayStation Vita Downloadable edition", "Windows Downloadable edition", "Xbox One Downloadable edition"], "average": "8", "videogametheme": ["Other"], "usersrated": "1", "videogamedeveloper": ["[bracket]games"], "videogamegenre": ["Visual Novel"], "videogameplatform": ["Linux", "Macintosh", "PlayStation 4", "PlayStation Vita", "Windows", "Xbox One"], "videogamehonor": ["2015 IGF Awards Excellence in Narrative Nominee"], "statistics": [], "videogamepublisher": ["[bracket]games", "Digerati Distribution"], "description": "In her mid-20's, Kelly has moved back into her parents' house.

It isn't glamorous but it is profitable. The salvage of a lifetime just drifted into nearby space. Unfortunately, you're not the only salvage crew to respond. Since you all arrive at the derelict together, interstellar salvage laws apply. Within the ship are dangers and rewards alike, just waiting for you.<br/><br/>In this fast-paced game of risk-taking and decision-making, you and up to four additional players try to claim the most salvage from the derelict ship before its failing engines finally explode. You'll go room to room gathering up salvage and avoiding deadly hazards. Will you get out of the derelict and tuck away your acquired salvage, or press your luck against the growing threat of the deadly hazards?<br/><br/>This game can be played in under 30 minutes and is simple enough to be grasped by young players. Older players, however, will enjoy it even more as they weigh the odds and make their decisions.<br/><br/>Each player is a faction that has an immunity, and the push your luck aspect comes from flipping the top card of the deck.  You can get salvage points that are evenly distributed among the players left on the ship and the left over goes to a kitty.  You can also flip over a hazard, which only kills you the second time a hazard of the same type is revealed.  Before you flip the next card, you have a tile that says, stay, or to back to ship. If you go back to ship, you keep the points that you have gathered and take the kitty points.  If you stay, you keep going until everyone dies or leaves for their ship.  There are five stages of the game.  Each stage you also shuffle an artifact and a black hazard which no one is immune to into the deck.  Each faction also has an artifact that will score them 20 points, whereas if you don't get your special artifact, it is only 10 points.  At the end of the five stages, whoever has the most points wins.<br/><br/>"}, "166258": {"statistics": [], "name": "iPad Mini", "usersrated": "2", "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2353059.jpg", "videogamehwversion": ["1st Generation: 16GB \u2013 WiFi Only Model"], "videogamehardwarecategory": ["Console"], "average": "8.4", "videogamehardware": ["iPad"], "poll": [], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2353059_t.jpg", "videogamehwmfg": ["Apple"], "description": "User Summary<br/>iPad Mini (branded and marketed as iPad mini) is a line of mini tablet computers designed, developed, and marketed by Apple Inc.<br/><br/>It is a sub-series of the iPad line of tablets, with a reduced screen size of 7.9 inches, in contrast to the standard 9.7 inches.

Kunlun is what is called a 'deck-building game,' for up to four players. The game is based on the story &ldquo;Warriors of Magic Mountain.&rdquo; Each player takes control of one Sect of the Kunlun Immortals, and they must compete with each other in defeating the dread forces of the Heart-Eaters. By defeating the Heart-Eaters, each player accumulates Cultivation. At the end of the game, once all the Heart-Eaters are defeated, the player with the most Cultivation is the winner.<br/><br/>Every turn, players play a &ldquo;hand&rdquo; of cards, building up the player&rsquo;s &ldquo;ready deck&rdquo; and attacking the demon enemies. In each turn, players can &quot;obtain&quot; a card once, and attack once. Players can obtain spells as well as obtain &quot;meditation&quot; cards which are used to obtain more, stronger cards.  Players may also &quot;obtain&quot; Immortal warriors from their Immortal Roster area; Immortals are the foot-soldiers in the war against the Heart-Eaters.<br/><br/>Each turn of the game is strategically important; one wrongly played hand can mean the difference between first and last place.<br/><br/>There are four Sects of Immortals in Demonslayer, and each plays differently from each other. The Kunlun Sect excels at bringing high-powered Immortal warriors out quickly, each building on the other&rsquo;s strength. The Qicheng sect is good at calling on reserve Immortals to join the battle. The Kongtong Sect is proficient at Alchemy; creating powerful artifacts which help the Sect in it&rsquo;s battle&rsquo;s against the Heart Eaters. The noble Wuyi Sect Immortal Warriors sacrifice themselves for devastating combo attacks. Every sect also has 1 Sect Leader Immortal, who provides special powers which serve to define how the sect plays.<br/><br/>The enemy of the game are the &ldquo;Heart-Eaters;&rdquo; demonic warriors who have attained immortality by reveling in lustful destruction and excess. Many of the heart eaters have spiritual parasites &ndash; called &ldquo;Miasma&rdquo; which infect the players after slaying. However, players also sometimes attack &ldquo;Treasure Beasts&rdquo; which can grant players special abilities once they are won.<br/><br/>In one &quot;wave&quot; of Demonslayer, there are 8 Heart Eaters and one &quot;Overlord;&quot; a leader of that wave of Heart-Eaters. Demonslayer: Siege of Mt. Kunlun is not, strictly speaking, a game of inter-player competition. Players compete with each other to have the honor of being the most successful at protecting the heavens and Earth from the demon hoards. Yet, players are are essentially cooperating to defeat the enemy.<br/><br/>This English-language version of the game already incorporates one expansion, called The Alchemist's Fortune. In time, we will release new expansions for you to enjoy, incorporating more players, more cards, more options, more strategy, and most of all &ndash; more fun.<br/><br/>"}, "166261": {"boardgamedesigner": ["Oliver Freudenreich"], "poll": [], "name": "2 erste Spiele", "playingtime": "5", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": ["Dice Rolling"], "yearpublished": "2013", "usersrated": "7", "maxplayers": "4", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2258787_t.jpg", "average": "5.42857", "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["Ravensburger Spieleverlag GmbH"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2258787.jpg", "boardgameversion": ["Ravensburger first multilingual edition"], "maxplaytime": "5", "boardgamecategory": ["Children's Game"], "age": "3", "minplaytime": "5", "description": "Two simple games of (color-)dice for children 3 and up, both set in a playground setting.<br/>In the first one, the players try to collect sandbox toys in 5 different colors, whoever has all five colors first, wins.<br/>In the second one, the players move across color-coded steps by throwing a color dice.

As a gift to customers of RPGNow and DriveThruRPG, we present this free battle map and associated VTT maps!  Thanks to everyone for giving us such an enthusiastic and warm welcome during our first year.<br/><br/>This map is inspired by scenario from a campaign I once ran.  It is a homestead, where the residents were charged with protecting a pair of bridges in case the nation's walls were ever breached and an enemy was marching on the capital.  Should an enemy breach the nation's walls, it was the job of these homesteaders to bring what were the only two bridges within a hundred leagues down, thereby delaying the enemy from advancing any further, and giving the defenders time to rally and hopefully push the invaders back.<br/><br/>There are two trebuchet's placed on either side of the bridge.  There is also a pair of towers and a gate that has been neglected throughout the years.  It has a portcullis, but the portcullis is rusted shut.<br/><br/>In my game, the players were faced with an epic end of chapter battle where they were charged with destroying at least one bridge before the bulk of an invading army arrived.  At the same time, enemies that were hiding in the brush around the homestead attacked.  So not only did my players have to fire the trebuchets and attempt to bring the bridges down, but their guards had to protect the trebuchets and their operators from being destroyed at the same time.<br/><br/>And with every passing turn that those bridges didn't fall, the army advanced, until it reached a point where soldiers began to cross.  In the end, the bridges fell, but not before enemy soldiers began to cross and had to be dealt with to bring an end to a tense fight.<br/><br/>Features:<br/><br/>     120&quot; x 120&quot; in size.  10' x 10' if you printed out the entire map!<br/>     HEX and SQUARE grids for each type of map listed below, as well as a NO GRID version for people that prefer to set their own scale.

At the start of each turn, players have five cards in hand, with six cards being face-up on the table as a card market. During the turn, players first have a chance to exchange some cards from their hands with those in the market, then they play and resolve their cards step by step, performing actions, trading and gathering resources, and most importantly, refining certain resources into other resources to earn victory points. Crystals on the players' individual resource boards keep track of their resources as they are bought and sold. Crystals placed beside the board represent player's coins. The final score is determined after the fourth turn, with players selling any remaining resources to score additional victory points (one point per four coins).

Spearheaded by sea and air power, the vehicles presented in this book were used on the islands of the Pacific as the war leapt from one to another. Though not facing the massive armoured conflicts of Europe and Africa, the vehicles the Japanese employed during the war were nevertheless interesting and varied.<br/><br/>This supplement for Traveller introduces many vehicles that formed the fighting arm of Japan in the Second World War, and provides full details of each, allowing them to be used within games. The weapons unique to Japan are also covered, along with enough information for you to use them in your own games and own vehicle designs.<br/><br/>Uses in Traveller<br/><br/>The vehicles found in this book could potentially form the basis of a campaign set in the Second World War. They may also be of interest to those who are simply curious as to how real-world vehicles can be implemented using the Traveller vehicle design system. However, we suspect many more players will want to actually use them in their games, even on planets far in the future and hundreds of light years away!<br/><br/>We have provided game mechanics for many vehicles, from the devastatingly agile Mitsubishi Zero, to the Type 95 tank but, at the end of the day, a Type 95 need not look like a Type 95 if it were built to these specifications on an alien world. It could end up looking very different but have the same characteristics listed in this book. By this token, what this book provides is a solid set of military vehicles available at Tech Level 5. A referee can use them to fully flesh out a military force on a Tech Level 5 world and provide interesting variations on themes in order to give his world more depth.<br/><br/>For example, a referee creating a military force for a new world may simply design a single main battle tank for it before moving on to the artillery piece, the fighter plane, and so on. With this book, he can present a military force that has a defined timeline with the development of its vehicles, so there is not just one main battle tank but several, each a replacement of the one before though with all still in service, with the very best units getting the latest generation of tank.<br/><br/>Players can have fun with this book as well, especially if they are engaging in paramilitary actions or running their own mercenary force. What this book will provide them is a list of Tech Level 5 vehicles that, while outmatched by more sophisticated enemies, will be perfectly serviceable (and at a cheaper price!) on more primitive worlds and will be capable of standing up against infantry from higher Tech Levels &ndash; at least, until plasma weaponry and missiles become prevalent.<br/><br/>"}, "166378": {"rpgdesigner": ["David Henley"], "rpg": ["Generic / Universal"], "statistics": [], "name": "Nysilor: Archipelago of Ashes", "rpgartist": ["David Henley", "Nicolas Vall\u00e9e"], "rpgproducer": ["David Henley", "Juliet Shea"], "usersrated": "0", "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2248833.png", "rpgitemversion": ["PDF version"], "rpgsetting": ["Nysilor: The Archipelago of Ashes"], "average": "0", "rpggenre": ["Culture (Asian / Far Eastern)", "Fantasy (High Fantasy)", "Fantasy (Science Fantasy)"], "rpgpublisher": ["Coin Toss Games"], "rpgcategory": ["Campaign Setting (game world)", "Scenario / Adventure / Module", "Sourcebook (rules/options to enhance play)"], "poll": [], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2248833_t.png", "description": "From publisher blurb:<br/><br/>Ancient races, unseen enemies, and dark supernatural forces surround you.

You can play with two copies of the game to allow 5&ndash;8 players.  An unusual feature of this game system is that there are core rules that all the games use.

In addition to forming a pyramid, you must form a &quot;straight&quot; and a &quot;rainbow&quot;, but these things must be done in a particular sequence. Unlike the previous two games, you calculate your score for the round based on the combinations you form.<br/>     Splitting Headache (90 minutes, ages 8+) is billed as a bonus game. In this game, you try to form the four different types of &quot;splits&quot;, after which you may work to form the &quot;banana split&quot; out of the remaining dice.

It is just a coincidence that the original scarab is a species of &ldquo;dung beetle&rdquo; and this class of ship is often employed moving garbage and other unseemly cargos. The extended-hull version of the ship is known as the Kiboko-class, which is a Swahili word for hippo (a reference to its bulk and ungainly nature outside of the void). Both are cheap and dependable, though lacking in amenities. Each carries a crew of 2 to 12 and is designed to haul large quantities of everything from cargo crates, to shipping containers, to ore, trash, and even liquids like fuel or water.<br/><br/>The components built into these ships are about a decade behind &ldquo;state of the art&rdquo;. Using older designs and refurbished parts keeps the cost down but doesn&rsquo;t produce a ship worth bragging about. Where the ship gets good marks is in durability. The hull is strong and well reinforced. This is necessary in order to haul dense cargo loads but also means the ship can withstand a lot of punishment. The older systems are also easy to maintain since any problems are well known and spare parts are plentiful. Lastly, the relative cost of these ships is low. That is, after all, the point. Both the Scarab-class and the Kiboko-class are unapologetically designed to get the job done, reliably, for the minimum price possible. These common ships are not much respected by ambitious independent pilots or status-conscious smugglers, but are very popular with companies and agencies that need a large number of cheap haulers.<br/><br/>The Scarab package contains four highly detailed, layered PDF files:<br/><br/>     Main Book<br/>         20page PDF file detailing the ships, interior areas, and exo-frame cargo movers.<br/>         Contains several 3D rendered scenes as well as orthographic views of the ships.<br/>         Includes system independent statistics designed for easy adaption to your game of choice.<br/>         Background, art, and text are on different layers for custom display and printing.<br/>    <br/>     Map Pages<br/>         21 page PDF file containing complete interior maps and instructions for assembly.<br/>        Miniature-scale maps for tactical combat with an optional 1 inch = 5 ft grid.<br/>        Divided into pages for easy printing in full color or printer-friendly black and white.<br/>        Selectable layers include: grid, black &amp; white version, optional objects, and more.<br/>    <br/>    2 Uncut Map Images<br/>        Two single page PDF files containing giant images of the complete deckplans.<br/>        The Scarab image is 24x36 inches; Kiboko 24x52.<br/>        Select either a light or dark background (for printing or projection/display).<br/>        Includes layers for grid, black &amp; white version, optional objects, and background choice.<br/>    <br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>These ships are bulk haulers and much of their interior is dedicated to a single, cavernous hold.  In a game setting the huge cargo hold could be used to store several ground vehicles or fighters instead of cargo, or could just be a great place to have a fight. The layered maps allow for the cargo to be shown or hidden &ndash; meaning you can have an empty hold or one crowded with palettes, crates, and barrels.<br/><br/>As always, this product is designed to give you ready-made ships to plug into your setting and rules of choice - lending depth and detail to your campaign.

Players will be controlling a mining company working in harsh conditions to acquire the most credits.<br/><br/>GENERAL INFO: A euro game for 1-5 players that plays in about 30-45 minutes.<br/><br/>THEME: Science Fiction. Space is a hostile environment with a known alien presence. Resources are scarce and it is commonplace for companies to mine asteroids to acquire them. It is known that aliens raid these asteroids and therefore mining companies are geared accordingly in preparation of being attacked. Lives are lost in this line of work daily, but if you run a good crew you can make it out alive and rich!<br/><br/>HOOK: Richly thematic euro incorporating dice and dice manipulation, with worker placement, resource farming and exporting.<br/><br/>WINNING CONDITION: Highest Credits when the end of the game is triggered. Credits are acquired primarily from exporting minerals mined from the asteroid.<br/><br/>MECHANICS: A round begins with rolling a set of Power Dice, these are community dice that players will use in order to successfully mine the asteroid. Players then take turns placing workers throughout different space stations and on a mineral rich asteroid.<br/><br/>After all the workers have been placed a third and more volatile Power Die is rolled. A player starts his/her turn by rolling his/her Rig Dice, these represent the a power element of his/her mining equipment that is to be paired with the community Power Dice in order to successfully mine resources from the asteroid. Then he/she resolves all his/her workers. As soon as players begin exporting minerals, hostile alien ships begin patrolling and will attack every round making it more difficult to resolve all the workers successfully.<br/><br/>Throughout the game, players will be increasing their worker count, gaining and spending credits (which are the victory points), gaining additional Rig Dice and acquiring explosive Neutronium bombs to protect them from the alien attacks.<br/><br/>When 3 of the 6 resource nodes on the asteroid are void of minerals the end of the game is triggered. The round is finished and the player with the most credits wins the game.<br/><br/>Darkrock Ventures will also include special 2-player game rules, as well as a Solo/Co-Operative variant.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "1", "boardgameversion": ["English first edition"], "average": "7.08264", "name": "Darkrock Ventures", "playingtime": "45", "boardgamemechanic": ["Area Control / Area Influence", "Dice Rolling", "Pick-up and Deliver", "Variable Player Powers", "Worker Placement"], "age": "14", "boardgameexpansion": ["208856"], "usersrated": "106", "boardgamefamily": ["Crowdfunding: Kickstarter"], "boardgamepodcastepisode": ["CnC First Impressions - DarkRock Ventures", "CnC Interview - Ian Stedman Of Magic Meeple Games", "Vox Republica 091: Arkham\u2019s Finest - An Interview with Richard Launius", "Vox Republica 092: Can I Make A Suggestion?"]}, "166419": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2467503.png", "poll": [], "boardgamedesigner": ["David Carl"], "statistics": [], "yearpublished": "2014", "maxplayers": "4", "age": "12", "boardgamepublisher": ["Privateer Press"], "maxplaytime": "45", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2467503_t.png", "minplaytime": "45", "boardgamecategory": ["Card Game", "Fantasy"], "description": "EXPAND YOUR COMMAND<br/>Bolster your armies with Escalating Conflict, an 84-card expansion for WARMACHINE High Command Faith &amp; Fortune!

It was released in Europe on August 30, 2013 and in the U.S. on September 3, 2013.<br/><br/>The game no longer uses a canon story like the original. Instead it uses an original story that take place two years after the Straw Hats Pirates entered the New World. Battles have been changed to focus more on the warrior gameplay, and the player will have to fight through higher numbers of enemies than the previous game. The quick time events from the first game has been removed completely. The game also features a coin system, in which players can spend the money they earn from stages to level up new characters quickly, instead of training them from level 1.<br/><br/>One noticeable change from the previous game is how support is handled. Players can build up a support gauge throughout gameplay, and use it to go into &quot;Haki mode&quot;. When in this mode they have the option of temporarily switching characters, and playing as the new character until the support gauge runs out. Haki mode also gives a different benefit depending on the characters used: &quot;Armament&quot; characters do more damage when attacking, while &quot;Observation&quot; characters effectively slow down time, while retaining their normal speed.<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;One Piece: Pirate Warriors 2&quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "166432": {"poll": [], "name": "Hot Wheels: World's Best Driver", "videogamemode": ["Local Multiplayer", "Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["Norht America Nintendo Wii U physical edition", "North America Nintendo 3DS physical edition", "North America PS3 physical edition", "North America Windows download edition", "North America Xbox 360 physical edition"], "average": "0", "videogametheme": ["Driving"], "videogamegenre": ["Racing"], "videogamedeveloper": ["Warner Bros.

The in-game race tracks are filled with elements, such as ramps, loops, and obstacles that are made to resemble actual Hot Wheels toys.<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;Hot Wheels Track Attack&quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "166434": {"poll": [], "name": "2 Games In 1 Double Pack - Hot Wheels: World Race / Velocity X", "videogamemode": ["Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["North America Game Boy Advance physical edition"], "average": "0", "videogametheme": ["Driving"], "usersrated": "0", "videogamedeveloper": ["Saffire"], "videogamegenre": ["Racing"], "videogameplatform": ["Game Boy Advance"], "statistics": [], "videogamepublisher": ["THQ"], "videogamecompilation": ["Hot Wheels World Race", "Hot Wheels: Velocity X"], "description": "User Summary<br/><br/>Contains the games Hot Wheels: Velocity X and Hot Wheels: World Race.<br/><br/>"}, "166435": {"poll": [], "name": "Pirate's Island: The Escape", "playingtime": "60", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": ["Card Drafting", "Set Collection", "Worker Placement"], "yearpublished": "2014", "boardgameimplementation": ["Oath of the Brotherhood"], "usersrated": "6", "maxplayers": "6", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2402046_t.jpg", "average": "5.33333", "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["Desyllas Games"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2402046.jpg", "boardgameversion": ["First edition", "Second edition"], "maxplaytime": "60", "boardgamecategory": ["Exploration", "Pirates"], "age": "12", "minplaytime": "60", "description": "Can you escape from the Pirate's Island?<br/>Words are out about the Royal Navy's discovery of the Pirate's Island.

The player with the strangest face begins, by taking a card and placing it face up in the middle of the table, within reach of all the players. Clockwise, each player will take a card and place it in the central stack. The moment two cards showing the same alien or the same letter coincide, any player can cover the central stack with his/her hand and the fastest in doing so must shout out a word beginning with the letter on the covered card.<br/><br/>Then, he/she must take all the cards from the central stack and, mockingly, distribute them how he/she chooses among the remaining players. This player will place a new card in the central deck to continue the game. The cards that players receive are incorporated to their stack of cards at the bottom.<br/><br/>4.

If a mistake is made while shouting out the word sequence or if a word is invalid because of a spelling mistake or if he/she has covered the central deck when two cards do not match, the player receives the central stack of cards and places a new card in the central deck to continue the game.

They are the treacherous, twisted cousins to the Kresh. In her madness, their creator, Sa'ra, decided to pay back her brothers for an earlier wrong, making the Skin Eaters dependent upon others' skins in order to live. They are not mindless, but no tribe trusts them as historical attempts to have a respectable relationship have always ended in bloodshed. Then there is the prophecy that they will one day convert the Kresh to their cause to conquer the other Tunse'als in honor of Sa'ra's predicted awakening.

The point of the game is to bake cookies as fast as possible, to have a large number of cookies, and to have a lot of milk, which gives a clicking multiplier. However, there is no true end to the gameplay. To start the game, the player bakes cookies solely by clicking on a giant cookie, gaining one cookie each time it is clicked. With sufficient cookies to use as currency, a player can buy items and upgrades that will bake more cookies automatically, and increase the number of cookies per click.<br/><br/>At first, the player clicks on the cookie on the left side of the screen to earn cookies per click, initially at a rate of one cookie per click. With these cookies, the player can purchase items that automatically make cookies for them, such as grandmas, farms, and cursors; and the player may upgrade the number of cookies produced per click. The more cookies produced, the better items that are available for purchase. The player is progressively able to purchase better items and make cookies at a faster rate. New items and features are added with ongoing updates of the game.<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;Cookie Clicker&quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}}
