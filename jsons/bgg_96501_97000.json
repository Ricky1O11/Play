The artwork is reminiscent of an arena filled with gladiators being cheered on by thousands of fans.<br/><br/>Game-play:<br/>The game board consists of a 5&quot; by 5&quot; grid, players start in the corners, are given 10 life tokens, and dealt 5 cards each.  There are 3 different types of cards in the full deck of 126 cards: black Movement Cards, red Combat Cards, and full color Item Cards.  The players draw back up to a full hand of 5 cards at the beginning of each turn, allowing the player to use all their cards on their turn or hold some back to defend against attacks on the other players' turns.  Each successful attack causes the defender to lose a life token.<br/><br/>The Center Square:<br/>The center square of the 5&quot; by 5&quot; grid has special properties for both attackers and defenders.  If an attacker is occupying the center square and successfully lands an attack on the defender, the defender loses 2 life tokens.  If the defender is in the center square and the attacker successfully lands an attack, the attack has the choice of the defender taking the hit (and losing one life token) or knocking the attacker out of the center square and into any available adjacent square.  This can setup the attacker for various combinations for dealing additional damage on a second attack on the defender by first occupying the now available center square.<br/><br/>Movement Cards:<br/>Movement Cards allow the players to move their miniature one square either diagonal or orthogonal as denoted by the image on the card.<br/><br/>Combat Cards:<br/>The Combat Cards are used to attack opponents either diagonal or orthogonal as denoted by the image on the card.  The strength of the attack is determined by the number in the corner of the card.  Combat Cards are also used to defend against attacks and are successful if the defender's card is equal to or greater than the number on the attacker's card.  Combat cards can only be played against another player if their miniatures are adjacent, unless using the throwing axe (see Item Cards below).<br/><br/>Item Cards:<br/>The Item Cards include various weapons, armor, and other items to modify the numbers on the Combat Cards.  If a player has the two handed axe equipped (+4 to attack) and plays a Combat Card with a 7, the defender must counter the attack with an 11 or higher.  If the defender had a shield equipped (+3 to defense), then only an 8 or higher is required to defend the attack.  Bonuses to attack and defend do stack, but each player can only have 2 cards equipped and certain cards cannot be equipped at the same time as any others.<br/><br/>Goal:<br/>Be the last player standing.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": ["First edition", "Game Crafter Kickstarter Only Edition"], "age": "12", "name": "Arena of Heroes", "playingtime": "30", "boardgamemechanic": ["Area Control / Area Influence", "Campaign / Battle Card Driven", "Hand Management"], "average": "6.83333", "usersrated": "3", "boardgamefamily": ["Crowdfunding: Kickstarter", "Gladiators"]}, "96506": {"rpgdesigner": ["William (Bill) Hart"], "rpgitemversion": ["First Printing", "Third Printing"], "poll": [], "name": "Dargon's Dungeon (1st Edition)", "rpgartist": ["Leonard J.

It is the first in our new series of &ldquo;Blitzkrieg Campaigns&rdquo;, two player wargames covering the great mobile campaigns of World War II. Blitzkrieg in the West puts you in command of either the German armed forces, or the Allies, during the epic campaign for the Low Countries and France in 1940. The system uses a combination of counters, maps and cards to give players the full range of options in emerging modern warfare, with a new twist: each player has different operational capabilities, generated by cards picked in secret before start of play.<br/><br/>This allows for tradeoffs between additional mobile capabilities for armor, enhanced fortification effects, specialized types of air missions, and even airborne special operations. This allows for a wide range of game strategies, and ensures that every play of the game will be different. It also allows players to explore the various &ldquo;what if&rdquo; options of the original campaign. Players will be in the position of their historical predecessors, who can exploit new forms of warfare.<br/><br/>Mechanized ground unit are represented as divisions, while infantry are corps level. Headquarters can provide non-divisional support. Air units are different types of groups, differentiated by aircraft models. Special rules include shock effect, national morale, flooding lowland areas, establishing bridgeheads across rivers, open cities, and much more.<br/><br/>The counters are beautifully printed and die cut with full color on both sides.

Welcome to The Game of Science, where you can do all this and more--in an hour or less.<br/><br/>The game moves forward as you hire new scientists and outfit them with the tools of their trade. You'll use your scientists and equipment to make discoveries, which give you science credits (credibility and prestige, the currency of the trade). Your scientists can also mess with the research of other players as you compete with them to accumulate the most scientific credibility. And finally, you'll use your accumulated credibility to propose theories, the key to winning the  game.<br/><br/>But the fun isn't over yet. Now the challenge is to convince your fellow players that you can use your theories to explain something new about the world. If they believe you, they'll let you win--but if they're not convinced, one of them might steal the show!<br/><br/>Every game will be different, as you explore new ways to combine scientists and decide on your favorite theories.

There are a selection of options of which scene to reach next (often depending on the events in the first scene). One is selected, you move onto the next scene (room) and repeat the process again.<br/><br/>What a wonderful concept! Brilliant in the way it cuts right to the heart of what makes a role-playing game fun. Immediately after (or before in the case of the Monster Manual) and in the years following several of these items were given great support. Across the various iterations of Dungeons and Dragons there are literally thousands of monsters and dozens of books and tables devoted to traps.<br/><br/>But what about the other 70% of the table?<br/><br/>I've already addressed the treasure entry, in my document &quot;Treasure&quot;, available at <a target='_blank' href='http://hackslashmaster.blogspot.com/2010/11/treasure-update.html' rel='nofollow'>http://hackslashmaster.blogspot.com/2010/11/treasure-update....</a> giving you the tools to create tons of interesting treasure. Instead of &quot;gold+magic&quot; it provides tables and keys to produce and describe anything from furniture to goods to gems to detailed works of art. It does more than just give a gold piece value to objects, it lets you describe each unique item then grin as your players struggle to move the antique armoire out of the dungeon.<br/><br/>But what of empty rooms? What of &quot;special&quot;? What of tricks? Surely Gygax didn't intend for the Dungeon Master to say, &quot;This is a bare room with nothing of interest.&quot; 60% of the time. As for specials and tricks, he gives an excellent, really outstanding list of features and attributes, and then has this to say. &quot;From these examples you will note that nearly endless combinations are possible, even without your own ideas for additions - and these will surely come.&quot; Surely they will, right? And they do - but suddenly, you're making the classic mega dungeon, and you need two of these per twenty rooms - an average of five or six per sheet of graph paper! To say nothing of empty room after empty room!<br/><br/>He does give relatively excellent tools, but this doesn't resolve the problem. It's just lists of items. And it's necessary to come up with example after example in any long term campaign. Just randomly using the lists doesn't fix the situation either. &quot;This room has *clatter* a slight breeze and *clatter* dung on the floor&quot; is no better and no more meaningful than &quot;This room is empty.&quot;<br/><br/>It's not that we all can't come up with empty rooms or tricks - it is simply the sheer volume of such that we must create. I know if you've ran a game before, you know the feeling. That is what this document is designed to do, assist with this process.<br/><br/>It contains lists, much like those in other rule books, but it also does something more - it catalogs the ways a room may be empty or special in exhaustive detail. Now, instead of trying to fit together a bunch of disparate random stuff in an interesting way without a guideline, you have a structure - a guide to your creativity!<br/><br/>"}, "96537": {"rpgdesigner": ["Courtney Campbell"], "rpg": ["Generic / Universal"], "poll": [], "name": "Treasure", "rpgartist": ["Courtney Campbell"], "rpgproducer": ["Courtney Campbell"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic962150.png", "usersrated": "0", "rpgitemversion": ["PDF Version"], "average": "0", "statistics": [], "rpggenre": ["Fantasy (High Fantasy)"], "rpgpublisher": ["(Web published)"], "rpgcategory": ["Sourcebook (rules/options to enhance play)"], "rpgseries": ["DM - Dungeon Master Resources"], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic962150_t.png", "description": "From the Preface:<br/><br/>Treasure tables suck.<br/><br/>No really, it's like a video game. I open the chest, what do I find? Wait, wait for it.<br/><br/>Gold.<br/><br/>Gems.<br/><br/>Magic Items.<br/><br/>Every time.<br/><br/>There's this cool list of items, with an extensive random table that doesn't take into account the power level of your group or the environment at all. How do I generate an appropriate list of items and treasure for an area without favoring certain PC's? How can I match the treasure with the approximate danger in the area? How can I randomly generate treasure that doesn't instantly unbalance my game because of a bad random roll (1% chance of an artifact I'm looking at you).<br/><br/>So I like to run a game that feels, I don't know, simulationist. And what did historical looters find of value?<br/><br/>Art.<br/><br/>Goods.<br/><br/>Furnishings.<br/><br/>Where are the tables for these things? Well, completely unsatisfied with every hodgepodge treasure table scattered all over the universe, I decided to compile a little document that would help me when preparing my games. Now you can roll up an 800 gp armoire that the players will walk right past when you roll that 20 for room contents. (Unguarded treasure?!) Now you can put more than enough treasure in the game for the players, and leave it up to them if they want to sell their diamond bells, or try to figure out how to move their 500 pounds of iron ingots. Now you can actually *know* how difficult to move whatever they find actually is.<br/><br/>The tables in this document are assuming that 60% or so of rooms are empty, and only 20% of the rooms contain treasure of any sort. All values are vaguely accurate and are designed to not break the suspension of disbelief in play.<br/><br/>There is little description. Most of the following should be fairly self-explanatory. Enjoy. If there isn't a table for something, pick. Or roll 1d20 and count words, cycling around till you run out of numbers.<br/><br/>"}, "96538": {"rpgdesigner": ["(Uncredited)"], "statistics": [], "name": "Aventurischer Bote (Issue 37 - 1992)", "rpgartist": ["(Uncredited)"], "rpgproducer": ["(Uncredited)"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic962291.jpg", "usersrated": "1", "average": "10", "rpgissue": ["Aventurischer Bote"], "rpg": ["Das Schwarze Auge (DSA) (2nd Edition)"], "rpgpublisher": ["Schmidt Spiele"], "rpgissueversion": ["German printed version"], "poll": [], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic962291_t.jpg", "description": "user summary<br/><br/>This is the infamous Coup issue, issued after Duke Answin of Rabenmund proclaimed himself Emperor.<br/>The whole issue is a joke, modelled after the biggest boulevard paper in Germany called &quot;Bild&quot;.<br/>Apart from several short, unrelated and more or less senseless articles and in-game commercials in a yellow press style, and a picture of a naked elven Girl on page 3, it has the following major articles:<br/><br/>Das ist Praios' Wille: Answin Kaiser!

His imperial carriage was equipped with an alveus, a Tabula playing board, so that he could play while travelling. Tabula is also the game which was primarily responsible for the gambling mania which swept Rome prior to its being declared illegal under the Republic. The fine for gambling at any other time except the Saturnalia was four times the stakes, although this law was only weakly and sporadically enforced.<br/><br/>Setup: The equipment for Tabula is the same as in backgammon except that each player has three dice instead of two. <br/>All checkers start off the board. Both players enter their fifteen checkers into the same starting table and move them around the board in the same direction.<br/><br/>Object: The object of the game is to move all of your checkers to the finishing table and then bear them off. The first player to bear off all his checkers wins the game.<br/><br/>"}, "96555": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1160019.jpg", "poll": [], "boardgamedesigner": ["Loren Overby"], "statistics": [], "yearpublished": "2011", "maxplayers": "6", "boardgameartist": ["Loren Overby"], "boardgamepublisher": ["Atomic City Games"], "maxplaytime": "120", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1160019_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "120", "boardgamecategory": ["Humor"], "description": "Welcome to SuperMegaCon, the convention board game.

One of the great things about this game is that no one sits on the sidelines and waits for the other players to get done. For the casual gamer, Agent Saboteur is easy to teach, fun to play, and will quickly become the game you play most often. For the hobby gamer, it will become the go-to game you get out when friends or family stop by.<br/><br/>The Story: &ldquo;Welcome, handler XXXXXXXXXX. Your reputation precedes you. That little matter you took care of in XXXXXX was quite impressive. Some believe you may be ready, so from here on your organization will only be tasked with stopping the type of incidents that end up on the front page. The last agents that got sent got themselves XXXXXX within a week and we&rsquo;re still explaining the glow in XXXXXXXXXXX. Everything you hear, see, or do from this point forward is strictly classified. Good luck. You&rsquo;ll need it.&ldquo;<br/><br/>The Gameplay: Your assignment is to use the spies and mission updates in your hand to stop the terrorists. Whichever player gathers the most points in incidents wins. To do so you'll work the source to gain more agents to your team, but if you push your luck, you may get made and lose them all. Then you'll need to send your agents on missions, traveling incognito using your fake passports. Beware, if the other agents guess where you're sending them, they can sabotage the attempt.

It is loosely based on the Chinese classic Journey to the West. The player assumes the role of a monkey boy (who is patterned after Sun Wukong from the story) and fights their way from one side to another, eventually reaching the statue of Buddha. One battles bats, rats, and mad bombers along the way with his stout fighting rod that shoots balls of fire. The game was ported from the arcade to the Nintendo Famicom in Japan. A sequel, entitled Son Son II, was released for the NEC PC Engine.<br/><br/>It is possible to play the game co-operatively with partner who plays as TonTon (who is Zhu Wuneng in the original story).<br/><br/>The game is a 2-D sidescrolling platformer. The screen scrolls automatically, only stopping to fight major enemies. The screen features six continuous platforms that occasionally feature small gaps. Sonson and Tonton walk automatically across these platforms. Pressing up or down will cause them to jump up or down to the next platform. Pressing left causes them to move more slowly than the screen scrolls, essentially continuing to move forward but at a reduced pace. Pressing right does the opposite - SonSon and TonTon will move across the platforms faster than the screen scrolls. The duo have only one attack - the ability to fire energy blasts from their stalves. Touching an enemy or an unfriendly projectile causes the player to lose a life. If a player has any additional lives, they will return to the screen riding on a cloud that will give them temporary invincibility. If the player presses the control stick in any direction, the cloud will disappear and the character will resume its usual walking mode. The cloud will eventually disappear on its own if the control stick is not used.<br/><br/>Power-ups come in the form of various fruits which produce points (with enough points giving the player an extra life). Gathering certain fruit will cause all enemies currently on a screen to turn into point-bearing fruits. Walking across certain platforms will randomly cause a bamboo shoot to sprout, yielding many extra points.<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;SonSon&quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "96567": {"poll": [], "name": "Buzz!: Brain Of Switzerland", "videogamemode": ["Network Multiplayer", "Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["Swiss PS2 edition", "Swiss PS3 edition", "Swiss PSP edition"], "average": "0", "videogameseries": ["Buzz!", "Buzz!: Brain of the World"], "videogametheme": ["Cartoon"], "usersrated": "0", "videogamedeveloper": ["Relentless Software"], "videogamegenre": ["Trivia"], "videogameplatform": ["PlayStation 2", "PlayStation 3", "PSP"], "statistics": [], "videogamepublisher": ["Sony Computer Entertainment"], "description": "Buzz!: Brain of... is the eighth title in the Buzz! series of quiz video games.

You don't want to be that guy. You don't &quot;go all in,&quot; you don't always keep your promises, and you don't do &quot;what's best for the group.&quot; Instead, you do everything you can to become indispensable, and &quot;everything&quot; is literal here &ndash; even if it means stealing from, betraying, and blackmailing other players.<br/><br/>In order to escape from Alcatraz, the players need to complete six parts of a plan. Each part is a &quot;pick-up and deliver&quot; task requiring specific items obtained in different parts of the prison. Once each part of the plan is completed, every player but the scapegoat moves a little closer to escaping, with the scapegoat being voted on each round by all the players &ndash; most likely the player who contributed the least to completing that particular task, but you never know. Thus, you could say that Alcatraz is a cooperative game &ndash; but with a twist.<br/><br/>The map of the prison constituting the play area is generated randomly each game, providing high replayability.

Play as Highlord Tirion Fordring, Lady Jaina Proudmoore, or Queen Sylvanas Windrunner and battle against the Lich King! Each player takes a deck, and the three heroes of Azeroth team-up to free the land from the threats of Icecrown Citadel. If the 3-on-1 seems unfair, know that the Lich King raid deck has some of the most powerful cards you've ever seen. He's no mere mortal! Plus, each deck comes with the hero's legendary weapon: the Ashbringer, Staff of Antonidas, Frostmourne, and Deathwhisper. The decks also feature new art for Fire Blast, Frostbolt, Counterspell, Multi-Shot, Redemption, Hammer of Justice, and others!<br/><br/>Cryptozoic has streamlined the raid deck experience, making it far more friendly to new players. There are no new rules to learn; each player takes his or her turn just as they would in a normal game of World of Warcraft TCG. The included rulebook ensures that even completely green recruits can jump in the action.<br/><br/>The three raiding decks easily convert into tournament-legal Core decks as well. Just replace the hero card, remove the legendary weapon, and you can battle at your local Core Constructed or Battlegrounds event.<br/><br/>Each four-player game comes packaged with an Assault on Icecrown Citadel Treasure Pack, and the Treasure Packs are sold separately as well. There are 20 uncommons, 7 rares, and 3 epics in the set. Each pack contains 9 foil cards (8 uncommons and 1 rare or 1 epic) unleashing never-seen-before allies, abilities, quests, and equipment cards into the World of Warcraft TCG card pool.

Never released in the arcade, two versions of the game were developed independently from each other (for the NES and Game Boy formats), with each game receiving a different storyline as a result. The Game Boy version is known in Japan as Bubble Bobble Junior.<br/>(This entry is for the NES title)<br/><br/>Story<br/>According to the NES version's manual, this game would supposedly star Bub and Bob as the original duo. However, the protagonists are actually intended to be Cubby and Robby, their descendants (hence the name &quot;Junior&quot; used both in the NES game's bonus rounds and in the alternate title of the GB version).<br/><br/>As seen in the game intro, Cub, and a girl named Judy, were sitting in a park. Suddenly, a floating skull character captures Judy into a bubble, and sends her and Cub into the air. Two characters named Drunk (from the original Bubble Bobble) follow the skull and take Judy away. Cub turns (or is turned) into a bubble dragon and heads off to rescue his girlfriend. There is also a two-player mode, implying that Rob has suffered the same events as Cub had. However, the manual states that Judy is a friend of both.<br/><br/>Among Collectors<br/>Because of its late release on the NES, Bubble Bobble Part 2 is exceptionally hard to find and is sought after by collectors.<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;Bubble Bobble Part 2&quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "96646": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic982929.png", "poll": [], "boardgamedesigner": ["Dan Best", "Tom Meier", "Paul Works"], "statistics": [], "boardgamecompilation": ["The Very Best of March Madness (Vol. 1)"], "yearpublished": "2011", "maxplayers": "2", "boardgamepublisher": ["Kansas City Irregular ASL Club"], "maxplaytime": "0", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic982929_t.png", "minplaytime": "0", "boardgamecategory": ["Expansion for Base-game", "Wargame", "World War II"], "description": "This scenario pack focuses  on the rebellion of the Georgian 822nd Battalion against the German Army on the island of Texel in Holland during the last days of the war.<br/><br/>Texel Island was part of the Atlantic wall, and the key battles of this rebellion involve fighting for control of these strongpoints.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": ["First edition"], "average": "6", "name": "March Madness 2011 Texel Pack", "playingtime": "0", "boardgamemechanic": ["Hex-and-Counter"], "age": "14", "boardgameexpansion": [], "usersrated": "1", "boardgamefamily": ["Advanced Squad Leader"]}, "96647": {"rpgdesigner": ["Bridget Buxton", "Brian McNeilly"], "statistics": [], "name": "Other Hands (Issue 21 - Apr 1998)", "rpgartist": ["Bridget Buxton", "Quentin Westcott", "Patrick Wynne"], "rpgproducer": ["Chris Seeman"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic966068.jpg", "usersrated": "1", "average": "7", "rpgissue": ["Other Hands"], "rpgissuearticle": ["Adventuring Among Second Age Edainic Peoples", "Broken Covenant", "Broken Covenant: Artwork", "Broken Covenant: Character and Hoard Stats", "Broken Covenant: Maps", "Communications", "Cover Page", "Editorial: Survey Says...", "Frontlines", "Rastarin's Log (part III)", "Secret Vice Cartoon"], "rpg": ["Middle-earth Role Playing (1st & 2nd Editions)"], "rpgpublisher": ["(Self-Published)"], "rpgissueversion": ["PDF Version"], "poll": [], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic966068_t.jpg", "description": "Previous Issue<br/><br/>Other Hands<br/>Issue 21<br/>April, 1998<br/><br/>ISSN: 1081-8359<br/><br/>Next Issue<br/><br/>"}, "96648": {"rpgdesigner": ["Carl Brodt", "Bridget Buxton", "Chris Seeman", "Chris Tubb", "Jason Vester"], "statistics": [], "name": "Other Hands (Issue 22 - Jul 1998)", "rpgartist": ["Bridget Buxton", "Alan Dep", "Quentin Westcott"], "rpgproducer": ["Chris Seeman"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic966069.jpg", "usersrated": "1", "average": "7", "rpgissue": ["Other Hands"], "rpgissuearticle": ["Advertisement: The Oathbreakers", "Communications", "Cover Page", "Dwarven Magic", "Editorial: On-line", "An Interview with Chris Tubb", "Rastarin's Log (part IV)", "Rastarin's Log (part IV) - Map", "The Balrogs", "The Balrogs - Artwork", "The TA 1640 Campaign: Facts and Problems"], "rpg": ["Middle-earth Role Playing (1st & 2nd Editions)"], "rpgpublisher": ["(Self-Published)"], "rpgissueversion": ["PDF Version"], "poll": [], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic966069_t.jpg", "description": "Previous Issue<br/><br/>Other Hands<br/>Issue 22<br/>July, 1998<br/><br/>Next Issue<br/><br/>"}, "96649": {"boardgamedesigner": ["R.

The number rolled dictates the direction of movement, for all players, this round. Then the Leader throws a black die and moves his ship that many spaces in the correct direction. Each player after that does the same, throw the black die and move, but not the red die as that is only thrown at the start of the round. There is a little choice in movement. You can decide to 'tack' and move in the direct opposite direction of the compass throw, but you don't move so far, in fact, you might not move at all.<br/>There are perils to be avoided, like rocks or the dreaded Seaweed Sea where you just float randomly until clear of it.<br/>The first player to sail into Treasure Bay wins.<br/><br/>"}, "96681": {"rpgdesigner": ["Bekkah Anderson", "Eric Chronister", "Harley Herrin", "Michelle Rogers"], "statistics": [], "name": "The Camarilla Mortem Post (Issue 9 - Dec 2006)", "rpgartist": ["Bryan Gilligan"], "rpgproducer": ["Wes Contreras", "Will Laymance", "Dineh Torres"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic964299.jpg", "usersrated": "0", "average": "0", "rpgissue": ["The Camarilla Mortem Post"], "rpgissuearticle": ["Cam Does Charity Right", "Camarilla Wiki Page", "Getting into Character", "Items and Approvals", "NC Speaks"], "rpg": ["Mind's Eye Theatre (nWoD)"], "rpgpublisher": ["White Wolf Publishing (White Wolf)"], "rpgissueversion": ["PDF version"], "poll": [], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic964299_t.jpg", "description": "<br/>Contents:<br/><br/>1, NC Speaks<br/>2, Cam Does Charity Right by Bekkah Anderson<br/>3, Camarilla Wiki Pages by Michelle Rogers<br/>4, Items and Approvals by Eric Chronister<br/>5, Getting into Character by Harley Herrin<br/><br/>"}, "96682": {"rpgdesigner": ["Bekkah Anderson", "Pearce Dreadin", "Bill Fry", "Christopher Leeson"], "statistics": [], "name": "The Camarilla Mortem Post (Issue 10 - Jan 2007)", "rpgartist": ["(Uncredited)"], "rpgproducer": ["Wes Contreras", "Will Laymance", "Dineh Torres"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic964298.jpg", "usersrated": "0", "average": "0", "rpgissue": ["The Camarilla Mortem Post"], "rpgissuearticle": ["Announcements Summary", "Blood Bonds Elucidated", "Camarilla Chairty 2006", "Constructive Criticism", "NC Speaks", "Player Spotlight: Adam Smythe", "US Camarilla Convention \u201806"], "rpg": ["Mind's Eye Theatre (nWoD)"], "rpgpublisher": ["White Wolf Publishing (White Wolf)"], "rpgissueversion": ["PDF version"], "poll": [], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic964298_t.jpg", "description": "<br/>Contents:<br/><br/>1, NC Speaks <br/>2, Constructive Criticism by Pearce Dreadin<br/>3, Player Spotlight: Adam Smythe by Bill Fry<br/>4, Announcements Summary  <br/>5, Blood Bonds Elucidated by Christopher Leeson<br/>6, US Camarilla Convention &lsquo;06 <br/>6, Camarilla Chairty 2006 by Bekkah Anderson<br/><br/>"}, "96683": {"poll": [], "name": "Turnover", "playingtime": "60", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": ["Tile Placement"], "yearpublished": "1939", "usersrated": "0", "maxplayers": "4", "average": "0", "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["Pepys (Castell Brothers)"], "boardgameversion": ["First edition"], "maxplaytime": "60", "boardgamecategory": ["Word Game"], "age": "9", "minplaytime": "60", "description": "A word game that has elements of Reversi in that you turn over letters to your colour when you form a word.<br/>2 player or a 4 player (partnership) game.

When the editor of the magazine told Artwick that subscribers were interested in purchasing such a program, Artwick founded subLOGIC Corporation to commercialize his ideas.<br/><br/>The new company sold flight simulators through mail order. January 1980 saw the release of Flight Simulator (FS1) for the Apple II. subLOGIC soon followed this up with versions for other systems and from there it evolved into a long-running series of computer flight simulators.<br/><br/>The original simulator had black and white wireframe graphics, featured a very limited scenery consisting of 36 tiles (in a 6 by 6 pattern, which roughly equals a few hundred square kilometers), and provided a very basic simulation (with only one aircraft simulated). Despite this, it ended up being one of the most popular Apple II applications of the early eighties.<br/><br/>The simulator was later ported to the TRS-80 Model I, which had only rudimentary graphics capability.

These included improved aircraft models, as well as an upgraded model of the Cessna Skylane, programmable dynamic scenery (non-interactive air and ground traffic on and near airports moving along static prerecorded paths). The basic version of FS4 was available for Macintosh computers in 1991. Like FS3, this version included an upgraded converter for the old subLOGIC Scenery Disks.<br/><br/>A large series of add-on products were produced for FS4 between 1989 and 1993. Some add-ons allowed users to create custom scenery, aircraft, and scripted adventures. Others provided upgraded graphics and audio.<br/><br/>FS 4 was also compatible with a large number of scenery add-ons. Scenery files produced by subLOGIC could be used with FS4, including subLOGIC's final massive USA East and West scenery collections.<br/><br/>With its many options and add-ons, yet still relatively tight &quot;in program&quot; integration and overall ease of use, the FS4 suite of programs presented a type of VR Toolkit for users with a flight simulator slant. While complex in some aspects, FS4 environment building options (including scenery and aircraft design) would provide an unsurpassed access to these activities for average users; an option, which in later versions of FS, was much less available and increasing complex.<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;History of Microsoft Flight Simulator&quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "96702": {"rpgartist": ["(Uncredited)"], "rpg": ["Apocalypse World"], "poll": [], "name": "The Faceless", "rpgdesigner": ["D.

As a cowboy on the wrong side of the law you know just how to take control of this shanty-town: threaten, fight, and kill off your rivals.<br/><br/>Deadwood is a wild-and-wooly board game with a quick and deadly twist on classic worker placement games. Your gang consists of three different classes of cowboys with different strengths: greenhorns, gunslingers, and trail bosses. Cowboys ride into town to gain control of (annex) buildings and fight other gangs' cowboys in shootouts.<br/><br/>At the beginning of the game, the town of Deadwood consists of the Town Hall, the Church, the Sheriff's Office, the Saloon, and four other randomly drawn buildings. Additional buildings are constructed whenever a cowboy annexes the Town Hall. Each building has at least one unique ability that is used immediately, with some buildings offering more long-term advantages.<br/><br/>A cowboy accesses these advantages by controlling the building. To gain control a player simply places one of his gang on a building tile, &quot;annexing&quot; it. Other gang leaders can try to gain control of your buildings through shootouts. The player that instigates the shootout receives a Wanted Poster token; the more cowboys you try to kill off, the more Wanted Poster tokens you collect, and the higher the fine you must pay at the end of the game.<br/><br/>Deadwood can end one of three ways: the Train Station is placed on the board once the railroad is built and completed, there are no more Wanted Poster tokens in the Crime Pool, or any player has no more cowboys alive.

It was even more successful than its predecessor. Kick Off 2 retains the pace and accuracy of the universally acclaimed Kick Off, with a full size multi directional scrolling pitch and the players, markings, goals etc, in correct proportions. Both teams play the game strictly according to tactics. Players move into position to receive passes and gain possession. The ball, as in real game, travels ahead of the player thus making a tackle a matter of skill rather than of choice.<br/><br/>Kick Off 2 like real soccer, requires skills in ball control for passing, dribbling, shooting etc. Accuracy in shooting, the ability to swerve or bend the ball to score, when taking free kicks need a lot of practice. The practice option allow to practice the ball skills and set pieces, without being harassed by the opposition and practice the skills to perfection. If two players are to team up, it is an ideal opportunity to practice ONE - TWO up and down the pitch.<br/><br/>Each player on the pitch has a unique combination of attributes and skills suitable for the skill level at which the game is being played. An International is superior to 4th div. player in all departments. One of the most useful options is the provision to set the skill levels of both teams independently. A novice with International Squad can give a professional with 4th Division Squad a run for his money.<br/><br/>There is a league and a cup tournament with sudden death penalty shoot outs, in case of a draw. The teams in the league are on the whole evenly matched but with different styles of play and the player skills to match, that style. There is an option to load your own team from &quot;Player Manager&quot; along with your own tactics, to play against another &quot;Player Manager&quot; team in a single game or enter league and cup tournament.<br/><br/>The special events selection in the main menu allows data disks to be loaded. Kick Off 2 also provides the facility to change strip colours and on expanded Atari ST's (1 MB or above) there are additional sound effects. The &quot;Action Replay&quot; facility allows you to see the goals at normal pace or in &quot;Slow Motion&quot; and compile your own &quot;Golden Goals&quot; disk. There are 24 referees and have their own distinctive temperaments. Some referee turns a &quot;blind eye&quot; and someone has a pack of red cards to distribute.

Interactive Entertainment. The game's visual style is inspired by anime and its narrative style takes the form of a dynamic voice-over. Bastion was released on July 20, 2011 for Xbox Live Arcade and will be released later in 2011 for digital download on PC.<br/>The game takes place in the aftermath of the Calamity, a catastrophic event that suddenly fractured the world as people knew it into many pieces and led to an infestation of hostile creatures. Players take control of the Kid, a silent protagonist who awakens on one of the few remaining pieces of the old world and sets off for the titular Bastion, where everyone agreed to go in troubled times. He finds almost nothing left upon arrival, but is told by a wise old man that together, they could build something special. The Kid then embarks on a quest to reconstruct the world the way it used to be, while the old man narrates his adventure and provides details on what exactly has happened.<br/>Bastion is an action RPG with a level structure. As a hero known as the Kid, the player moves through fantasy-themed environments that form paths on the fly. In order to progress, the Kid must defeat enemies using a variety of melee and ranged weaponry, collecting items and levelling up his attributes with experience points along the way. Between levels, the Kid visits the Bastion, where he can use the money he has accrued to install new buildings. Here, he can utilise establishments, such as a shrine, an armory and a distillery.<br/><br/>The game incorporates a unique feature called 'dynamic narration'. Rucks, the old wise man (voiced by Logan Cunningham), serves as the game's narrator. As well as delivering story exposition, he will constantly give different commentary based on the player's actions and style of play - for example, he might remark upon the player's affinity for a certain weapon if said weapon is used frequently during battle.<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;Bastion (video game)&quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "96748": {"boardgamedesigner": ["Austin Searles"], "average": "0", "poll": [], "name": "Bloodline \"The Family Tree\"", "playingtime": "30", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": ["Hand Management"], "yearpublished": "2011", "usersrated": "0", "maxplayers": "6", "boardgameartist": ["Chad Winkler"], "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["The Game Crafter, LLC"], "boardgameversion": ["First Edition"], "maxplaytime": "30", "boardgamecategory": ["Card Game"], "age": "10", "minplaytime": "30", "description": "The Kings Health is failing.

The idea for this and future volumes is that we will take multiple existing games from the VPG Napeoleonic 20 series, add an as-yet-unpublished game to the mix, and create a GMT boxed game with 3-4 games in the box, using larger (3/4&quot;) counters and GMT production.<br/><br/>The Napoleonic 20 game system from Victory Point Games features lower-level wargame complexity on maps where, generally, 20 pieces or fewer are in play at one time (total, for both sides).  This creates tense, dramatic and fast-playing situations on the board where higher echelon troop formations (generally corps) vie for position and dominance. Subscribers to C3i have recently enjoyed Jena 20, a game in this series which features eight pages of Standard rules and one-to-two pages of exclusive rules per title.<br/> Veteran game designer Joe Miranda, with developers Alan Emrich and Lance McMillan, have created and refined a highly popular game series that is growing all the time. (Based on Joe's series rules, Alan, Lance, and Steve Carey have each designed one of the games in this multi-pack - in addition to Joe's Waterloo game.) A hallmark feature is the use of narrative random event cards that help &ldquo;tell the stories&rdquo; unique to each battle and small campaign. This &ldquo;friction of war&rdquo; element, combined with the operational-level maneuvers, combat, and even lulls, provide players a fun exercise in the Napoleonic parry-and-thrust of grand battles as armies close to bayonet-point to see which will break first.<br/><br/>This edition includes the latest version (3.0) of the Standard series rules.<br/> Morale plays an vital role, as both sides can &lsquo;spend&rsquo; this resource to force march their units, help rally stragglers, or commit reserves to a key attack or defense. But look out&hellip; when a side&rsquo;s morale is reduced to zero, it has lost the game!<br/><br/>Included in this Multi-Pack are:<br/><br/><br/>    Salamanca 20 (Wellington vs. Marmont, 1812)<br/>    Smolensk 20 (Napoleon vs. Barclay de Tolly in the near-battle to decide the Russian Campaign, 1812)<br/>    Borodino 20 (Napoleon vs. Kutusov before Moscow, 1812)<br/>    Waterloo 20 (Napoleon vs. Blucher and Wellington, 1815) <br/><br/><br/>Game Components:<br/><br/><br/>    Four 17&rdquo; x 22&rdquo; mounted  maps (2 boards, backprinted)<br/>    117  3/4&quot;  Counters (thick, with Rounded corners, like No Retreat)<br/>    48 Event cards (12 for each game)<br/>    One 8-page Standard Rules booklet<br/>    4 Exclusive Rules sheets<br/>    One Player&rsquo;s Aid mat<br/>    Two Player Aid charts<br/>    2 six-sided Dice<br/><br/><br/>DESIGN: Joe Miranda<br/>DEVELOPER: Alan Emrich &amp; Lance McMillan<br/>ART DIRECTOR: Rodger B.

A player must complete whatever task is given to him within the time limit (usually a few minutes). There are three main objectives that appear in the game: the more common objective involves leading stray Troddlers to an exit, somewhat similar to the gameplay in Lemmings. Another objective commonly given is the destruction of zombie Troddlers. The third involves collecting gems. Many levels combine two of these objectives and sometimes all three. There are, naturally, many obstacles and enemies throughout the game.<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;Troddlers&quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "96764": {"poll": [], "name": "Croc 2", "videogamemode": ["Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["English/European PlayStation edition", "English/European Windows edition", "Japanese PlayStation edition", "North American PlayStation edition", "North American Windows edition"], "average": "0", "videogameseries": ["Croc"], "videogametheme": ["Furries / Talking Animals"], "usersrated": "0", "videogamedeveloper": ["Argonaut Games", "Natsume"], "videogamegenre": ["Platform"], "videogameplatform": ["PlayStation", "Windows"], "statistics": [], "videogamepublisher": ["Electronic Arts Inc.

It was created in collaboration between Akira It\u014d (Yu-Gi-Oh! R), Satoshi Nakamura (Duel Masters), and Bushiroad president Takaaki Kidani. The game was also released in conjunction with a TV anime series, &quot;\u30ab\u30fc\u30c9\u30d5\u30a1\u30a4\u30c8!! \u30f4\u30a1\u30f3\u30ac\u30fc\u30c9&quot; (Cardfight!! Vanguard).<br/><br/>In the game, players &quot;ride&quot; a unit as their Vanguard, which represents them on the board. They may also summon other units as Rear Guards to attack or support. The game is won by doing 6 points of damage to the opponent's Vanguard.<br/><br/>As players attack, if they are using their vanguard they can &quot;drive check&quot; whereby they check the top card of their deck for &quot;triggers&quot; which increase power and have other effects, and add these cards to their hand. Triggers can also be revealed when players take damage to their vanguard by performing a &quot;damage check&quot;.<br/><br/>At the start of the game, each player places their grade 0 starting vanguard face down in the &quot;vanguard circle&quot; and then draws 5 cards. They may return any number of cards to the deck and re-draw to form their starting hand, but only once. It's a good tactic to return trigger cards from your first hand as these are better utilised when drawn from the deck as part of a &quot;drive check&quot; or &quot;damage check&quot;.<br/><br/>Once the players are done setting up their initial hand they determine who goes first (often, rock-paper-scissors is used for this) and then each turn follows the same turn order:<br/><br/>1. Stand up (only at the start of the game, and both players perform this action simultaneously whereby they flip over their vanguard)<br/>2. Stand and Draw<br/>3. Ride<br/>4. Call<br/>5. Attack<br/>6. Guard<br/>7. Drive Check<br/>8. Damage Check<br/>9. (more attacks? Go back to 5)<br/>10. Turn end - change to other player and go back to 2<br/><br/>It's worth noting that strategically, taking damage early in the game can be beneficial as you can use cards in the damage zone to &quot;counter blast&quot; (flip the cards over to activate special actions on certain units).<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": ["Bushiroad English Edition", "First edition"], "name": "CardFight!!

These were added to help move away from gameplay that was &quot;just going, playing a venue, and then moving on to the next one&quot; and instead to &quot;open the world up&quot;.

An entire fleet of ships can be represented on a single standard sheet of paper.<br/><br/>Play is simultaneous. Each player takes turns giving orders to his units by placing a marker on top of one ship to indicate the orders it has been given. Once all ships have orders, initiative is determined. The player losing initiative moves all his ships first (giving the non-moving player an advantage), but then fires first in the subsequent fire phase (gaining an advantage).<br/><br/>Movement and firing are both simplified and sped up from Admiralty Edition, reducing the amount of record keeping and the number of die rolls.

Putty has many moves that he could use to attack enemies or to navigate around the level. These abilities include being able to stretch out upwards, downwards, left and right to access far-off ledges. He also has the ability to inflate. This allows him to provide a cushioned landing for any falling bots. Over-inflation also acts as a &quot;smart bomb&quot;, with Putty bursting, killing all of the enemies on the screen, whilst reducing his health in the process.<br/>Putty is able to form part of himself into a fist, allowing him to punch left or right to dispatch enemies.<br/>Putty is also able to melt into the floor, making him invulnerable and also allowing him to absorb enemies, recovering a small amount of health in the process. With certain enemies in the game, such as the clockwork orange, once Putty has absorbed one he is then able to morph into the enemy's shape to use its abilities.<br/>A final ability of Putty's is being able to create a mug of coffee from part of himself, which will distract bots and make them stand still.<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;Putty (computer game)&quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "96821": {"rpgdesigner": ["Greg Porter"], "rpgitemversion": ["PDF Version 1.0 for Acrobat Reader", "PDF Version 1.0 for pdfExpert"], "poll": [], "name": "Verne Character Creator", "rpgartist": ["Greg Porter"], "rpgproducer": ["Greg Porter"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic967934.png", "usersrated": "2", "rpgsetting": ["Verne"], "average": "10", "statistics": [], "rpg": ["EABA"], "rpgpublisher": ["BTRC (Blacksburg Tactical Research Center)"], "rpgcategory": ["Software (for maps, char sheets, etc)"], "rpggenre": ["History (Victorian Era)", "Steampunk"], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic967934_t.png", "description": "From the Introduction:<br/><br/>This is a semi-automated adventurer creator for Verne. The way it works is pretty simple:<br/><br/>     Go to the next page<br/>     Initialize things by hitting the red reset button<br/>     Answer the questions from your adventurer's point of view, or hit the &quot;random&quot; button to generate a semi-random selection of answers<br/>     When you are happy with the answers, hit the &quot;calculate&quot; button. This will generate both a nationality and a profession for the adventurer<br/>     Go to the adventurer sheet on the last page and hit the &quot;make adventurer&quot; button. This will generate a full selection of Attributes, skills and Traits for the adventurer.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>There a number of ways you can do this for generating adventurers, and some hidden tips and tricks. We recommend that if you are going to generate adventurers using the questions, that you get three tries at it. If you do not like the results of your first questions, you can change up to three answers and try again, and then one more time if you still do not like it. As long as you keep track of the changes, this gives you three adventurers to choose from.<br/><br/>Now for some detailed stuff. This adventurer creator works off of Victorian stereotypes. Each answer has weighting factors that will lean it towards a nationality and a profession. The total result of your answers is in the bar graphs on the lower left of the page. And because it is based on stereotypes, you can &quot;game the system&quot; fairly easily. For instance, if you choose a sexist Catholic who values his reputation above all else, thinks his nation is strong (but is not sure of it) and prefers style over substance, you're well on your way to a Spaniard (an Italian would value love over all else). Or, if you choose a Protestant who knows his nation is a major player, is slightly racist, prefers order to chaos and believes troubles are to be endured, then congratulations, you're probably going to be an Englishman.<br/><br/>The wealth of an adventurer is based on the Verne rules and EABA guidelines. This means there can be extraordinary variation in wealth. Some professions pay more than others, the Wealth Trait magnifies this, and skill levels also adjust things. You can have a starting adventurer who is destitute, or one who has a country manor and owns their own ocean-going steamship.<br/><br/>"}, "96822": {"rpgartist": ["Dan Algstrand", "Don Maitz", "\u00c5ke Rosenius"], "rpg": ["Gondica"], "statistics": [], "name": "Gondica", "rpgdesigner": ["Thomas Allvin", "Anders Blixt", "Leif Eur\u00e9n", "Michael Leck", "\u00c5ke Rosenius", "Dag St\u00e5lhandske"], "rpgproducer": ["(Uncredited)"], "average": "5.5", "usersrated": "2", "rpgitemversion": ["Softcover Version"], "rpggenre": ["Action / Adventure (Swashbuckling / Pirates)", "Fantasy"], "rpgpublisher": ["R\u00e4vspel"], "rpgcategory": ["Core Rules (min needed to play)"], "poll": [], "description": "Back of the book (in Swedish):<br/><br/>Gondica &auml;r ett action-inriktat fantasy-rollspel.

Each player has five man tokens (for example meeples), called sockers, and there is a ball token.<br/><br/>To set up the game, the ball is placed in the center space of the board. Players toss a coin to see who plays first. Starting with the toss winner, each player places all his or her sockers upright on any empty spaces that are in their nearest half of the field, but not adjacent (vertically, horizontally or diagonally) to the ball and not in the center row.<br/><br/>Players continue alternating turns and do the following.<br/><br/>On a turn, a player must perform one to three actions listed below using any of his or her upright (referred to as active) sockers.<br/><br/>     Move.  An active socker may be moved to any adjacent empty space. This includes the goal and out of bounds areas. However, at the end of a player&rsquo;s turn, no more that three of his or her sockers may be in the goal and out of bounds regions.<br/> Kick. If an active socker is adjacent to the ball, the ball may be kicked directly away one space provided the destination space is empty.<br/><br/>Sock. If an active socker is adjacent to an opponent&rsquo;s socker, then the opponent&rsquo;s socker may be pushed directly away one space provided the destination space is empty. The pushed socker is then put on its side to indicate that it is inactive and will not be able to perform any actions for one turn.<br/><br/>Any action or active socker may be used multiple times. Player may use any combination of actions and active sockers, and in any order they like.<br/><br/>When a player completes his or her actions all that player&rsquo;s inactive sockers are put upright and become active again. This ends the player&rsquo;s turn.<br/><br/>The goal of the game is to kick the ball over your goal line, into your farthest 1x9 row.  Players can choose either of the following winning conditions: first to score a set number of goals (usually one), or most goals after a set number of turns followed by sudden death if necessary. After a goal, players should use the setup procedures with the non-scoring player going first. For sudden death, only two sockers per player are used, and a coin toss is used to determine who plays first.<br/><br/>Special Rules<br/><br/>Out of Bounds: The first and last columns of the playing field excluding the goal spaces are out of bounds. If the ball is pushed out of bounds, the ball is immediately moved to the center space of the same row. If the center space is occupied, the owner of the occupying socker can choose any empty space adjacent to the center space.<br/><br/>Repeat Positions: When a position is repeated, the player that plays next gets one extra action (total of four instead of three) to break the deadlock.<br/><br/>Static Positions: The maximum number of sockers on the edge is three. This prevents unmovable defensive positions behind the goal line or along the sides of the board. That is, positions where the offensive player can not push the ball or an opponent's socker.<br/><br/>"}, "96839": {"rpgdesigner": ["Will Broderick", "Valarie Broderick", "Matthew Dobson", "Robert Hodges", "Walter Holt", "Roo James", "Chad LaNier", "Jeff Schaller", "John Scott"], "statistics": [], "name": "The Camarilla Mortem Post (Vol. 2, Issue 8 - Nov 2008)", "rpgartist": ["Cari Neujhar", "Shelly Welch", "A.

There are many different buildings and characters you can produce, each depending on which of the 3 races you choose to be: European, Asian or Arabian. The main differences are the types of special buildings available, and the types of troops you can make. There is also a campaign option for single players in which the player must complete specific goals, such as destroying an enemy force, or protecting a citadel from attack.

The punch and kick buttons are pressure-sensitive, so the harder the players press, the more powerful the punches or kicks become, while lighter taps can create weaker, but faster punches or kicks. The throw button C, if close enough to the opponent, grabs and throws the opponent across the stage; however, if standing near either side of a stage, the opponent would be tossed the opposite direction. Introduced in the fighting game genre by World Heroes are some abilities exclusive to some characters that were used in several later fighting games, such as multi-jumping using Hanzou and Fuuma, and shooting projectiles from the air using Rasputin.<br/><br/>There are two different play modes for players to choose from: &quot;Normal Game&quot; and &quot;Death Match&quot;. In &quot;Normal Game&quot;, players have to select one of the eight playable characters in the roster, and defeat the other seven playable characters in a random order, followed by a battle against the final boss Geegus (misspelled as &quot;Gee Gus&quot; in localized English versions), all by using the chosen character. If the player loses a battle, he or she will decide whether to continue (by inserting coin) or quit. If the player defeats an opponent, he or she will move on the the next opponent; however, if the player wins against the final boss Geegus, the game will show the ending of the player's chosen character, followed by the &quot;game over&quot; screen, and back to attract mode; however, if a player beats a high score, he or she will type in three letters or text symbols to record his or her record before the &quot;game over&quot; screen appears. In &quot;Death Match&quot;, players will fight in a ring with environmental hazards such as electricity and fire surrounding it, which players must avoid while fighting.

After that, the player must defeat the two bosses, Neo Geegus and Dio to win the game. The rule in each battle against a character, like in most fighting games at the time of its release, requires the players to win two-of three rounds to completely win against the opponent. If the timer runs out before anyone is knocked out, the one with the most health in his or her lifebars wins.<br/><br/>In &quot;Death Match&quot; mode, the object of this mode is the same as &quot;Normal Game&quot; mode, but with new stages that feature new environmental hazards and a unique lifebar. Unlike most fighting games at the time, the lifebar in &quot;Death Match&quot; mode has a different rule. If the player hits his or her opponent, the arrow on the lifebar will move toward the opponent's side at a distance depending on certain moves performed against the opponent. If the arrow scrolls at the end of the opponent's side, he or she loses.

Control of the land is achieved by controlling the various cities.

On a roll of 1, 2 or 3 the Spanish side is up, on 4, 5 or 6 the Dutch side. Each player gets three leaders to control their armies and 15 units of infantry. The Spanish get an extra two units of cavalry and the Dutch two units of naval troops (watergeuzen)<br/>Each round both players roll a die. Their separate scores are the number of action points they have for that round. The combined number of both dies is used to decide on a random effect to be carried out before the round is started. <br/>Victory points can only be scored as the result of a specific random effect. For each province (there are 16 provinces with 1 to 8 cities) where one players controls all cities that player scores a victory point for each city in the province. <br/>The player with the highest roll starts the round, in case of a tie the Spanish player. Units are moved over the board by leaders, they cannot move alone. The naval units can move independently but only from one coastal city to another. Movement costs actions. A player can conquer cities by spending action points storming, starving or tricking them. A random event can cause the city to change its alliance at the start of a new round as well.<br/>Battles between armies are  a special affair: both sides take only one turn rolling dies, one die for a unit of infantry, three for cavalry and three for each point their best leaders ability is higher than the other players best leaders. First the defending player rolls the dies, scoring a hit for each 6 rolled. Then, after taking her losses, the attacker does the same, the defender taking her losses. The winner of the battle is the player who rolled the most sixes or, when both rolled the same number, the defender. The defeated player loses the entire army, both units and leaders!<br/>After the last round there is a final victory point calculation. In this calculation a point is awarded for each city the player controls, regardless of province control.<br/><br/>"}, "96928": {"rpgdesigner": ["(Uncredited)"], "rpg": ["Pathfinder Roleplaying Game"], "poll": [], "name": "Carrion Crown Poster Map Folio", "rpgartist": ["Robert Lazzaretti"], "rpgproducer": ["(Uncredited)"], "usersrated": "7", "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1090273.jpg", "rpgitemversion": ["PDF Version", "Print Edition"], "rpgsetting": ["Golarion"], "average": "7.42857", "statistics": [], "rpggenre": ["Fantasy (High Fantasy)", "Horror"], "rpgpublisher": ["Paizo Publishing"], "rpgcategory": ["Accessory (dice, maps, screens, cards)"], "rpgseries": ["Carrion Crown", "Pathfinder Campaign Setting"], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1090273_t.jpg", "description": "From the publisher:<br/><br/>Uncover the mysteries of the mist-haunted realm of Ustalav with the Carrion Crown Poster Map Folio.

The board consists of a traditional 8 square x 8 square checkerboard grid divided into two Land areas separated by a Sea area. Vehicles are restricted to movement within their assigned battlefields: Through the Air, On Land and/or In the Sea.<br/><br/>Pieces transverse the board in a Chess-like manner.  Play evolves, turn by turn, with each player analyzing the current battlefield situation, adjusting their game plan accordingly and executing commands (movements of the playing pieces) in a collective effort to achieve the game's objective. Certain Air pieces (Bombers and Helicopters) can Go Over pieces; likewise certain Sea pieces (Submarines) can Go Under pieces. Additionally, certain pieces (Bombers and Tanks) can Block. The complete Original Release Basic Training Game Rules include &quot;Object of the Game&quot; options, &quot;Team Game Play&quot; options and &quot;Advanced Game Play&quot; options. &quot;Future&quot; options will include new movements, expansion pieces, additional damage control options, new attack features, mini wars and expanded terrains as variants to the Original Release Game Rules.<br/><br/>While this abstract strategy war game does not include random chance, it does allow for piece enhancements both during game play and during board set up which increases come from behind opportunities and can be used to level the playing field between players of various skill levels. The game can be played one-on-one or as a social game with teams. The military theme, the terrain feature of Air, Land and Sea areas of the board and the movements of the pieces themselves relative to the military vehicles they represent give the game a real world appeal.<br/><br/>The two Armed Forces consist of the following fifteen pieces per side: one Commander, two stealth Fighters, two army Tanks, one stealth Bomber, two submersible Submarine warships, two Helicopters, four amphibious assault vehicles (Amphibians) and one surface combatant Destroyer warship.

Five elite automobiles from around the world that speak one common language--performance. Now, with The Duel: Test Drive II, you can race them in head-to-head competition.<br/><br/>'88 Lotus Turbo Esprit--If you're expecting typical British reserve, guess again. This Esprit is as sensuous and aggressive as any exotic to come out of Italy. And any car capable of pegging its 160 mph speedometer is certainly worthy of Supercar status. The Lotus handling is world famous. The 2.2-liter turbocharged engine, irresistible. Keep a stiff upper lip and let Esprit's 228 horses stampede.<br/><br/>Ferrari Testarossa--A legend in its own time. The elite of Grand Touring cars. This Ferrari hits 185 mph with twelve cylinders singing in perfect harmony. 0-60 mph strikes in 5.3 seconds and the quarter mile blurs by at 13.3--well over 100 mph. But speed isn't the only thing to snap necks. Take one look at its styling, its wrap around leather interior--and you'll know exactly what you'd do with $134,000.<br/><br/>Porsche 911 RUF--Introducing Louis Ruf's gift to the automotive world--a custom built, twin-turbo Porsche 911. Top speed: 211 mph. 0-60 mph: 4.0 seconds. Blindingly quick. Acceleration that sucks you into the seat. Supreme ruler of the German Autobahn, this 469 bhp bullet is perfectly street legal. But don't let that fool you. The space program would provide better preparation for this experience than driving school.<br/><br/>'88 Lamborghini Countach 5000S--Stunning. No other word best describes the Lamborghini's look--or performance. How can a car so outrageous be so darn fast? Take a look under the hood. The Countach sports a powerful V-12 with four valves per cylinder. Before you can say &quot;Giotto Bizzarrini&quot; you're at 179 mph. And nothing can match its stability at top speed. Go out on the open road. Count how many times &quot;WOW&quot; leaves your mouth.<br/><br/>'89 Corvette ZR1--Tough to keep a 185 mph Corvette under wraps but the ZR1 stands as one of Detroit's best kept secrets. Designed with one goal: &quot;create the world's fastest production car.&quot; It's engine, code named LT5, is a legend before its time. An all-aluminum, four cam, 32 valve V-8 so strong that Chevrolet engineers has to completely redo the rear end to accommodate more rubber. Is there anything similar to the ZR1?

This beautifully illustrated deck of 51 full-color cards gives you a new way to run chases and races in your Pathfinder Roleplaying Game adventures. Each card presents an obstacle in one of three classic adventure settings - a bustling city, a tangled forest, or a deadly dungeon - challenging heroes to overcome or fall behind. Get in the race with Chase Cards and don&rsquo;t get left in the dust.<br/><br/>By laying a line of these cards down on your table, you can track each character's progress through a path fraught with perils - along with all of the die rolls needed to avoid or navigate these unexpected dangers. Lay out a desperate pursuit through a crowded city, a dangerous race through hostile wilderness, and a nerve-wracking run through deadly ruins and abandoned buildings - or mix and match the cards to create a chase that moves through multiple regions!<br/><br/>"}, "96994": {"rpgdesigner": ["(Uncredited)"], "rpgitemversion": ["First printing"], "poll": [], "name": "Urban NPCs", "rpgartist": ["(Uncredited)"], "rpgproducer": ["(Uncredited)"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic999025.jpg", "usersrated": "8", "rpgsetting": ["Golarion"], "average": "7.375", "statistics": [], "rpggenre": ["Fantasy"], "rpgpublisher": ["Paizo Publishing"], "rpg": ["Generic / Universal"], "rpgcategory": ["Accessory (dice, maps, screens, cards)"], "rpgseries": ["GameMastery", "Pathfinder Cards"], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic999025_t.jpg", "description": "From the back of the Deck:<br/><br/>Be it a sinister sneer, a welcoming glance, or a sly wink, first impressions count in any game.

Runner<br/>Super Off Road (including its upgrade/add-on pack, Super Off Road Track Pack)<br/>Hydro Thunder (console version)<br/>San Francisco Rush 2049 (console version)<br/><br/>Furthermore, while most of the games in this collection are emulations or recreations of the arcade versions, Hydro Thunder and Rush 2049 are based on the console versions, specifically ports of the Sega Dreamcast releases.<br/><br/>Super Off Road/Track Pack is the only game on this collection, and in the entire trilogy, that was not developed by Williams, Midway, or Atari Games. It was developed and published by The Leland Corporation. For legal reasons, the image of &quot;Ironman&quot; Ivan Stewart has been altered in the two Super Off Road games; he now has sunglasses and a moustache and both games are now known as simply &quot;Super Off Road&quot; (the original arcade versions were known fully as &quot;Ironman Ivan Stewart's Super Off Road&quot;). &quot;Ironman's&quot; Speed Shop was re-named Off-Road Speed Shop, and Ivan himself (the gray, AI-controlled racer) was renamed &quot;Lightning&quot; Kevin Lydy.
