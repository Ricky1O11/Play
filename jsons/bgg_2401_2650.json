During those years, several editions appeared with differing artwork and game pieces.  Some of these editions are entitled Dixie or Dixie-Pollyanna and some are subtitled &quot;The Great Home Game,&quot; &quot;The Glad Game,&quot; or &quot;Parker Brothers Track Pursuit Game.&quot; In 1917 it was completely rethemed as The Popular Game of Broadway, with artwork of New York scenes featuring famous buildings of the time.  Pollyanna itself gets its name from the title of the 1913 children's novel by Eleanor H. Porter.  Each piece color in the game is associated with one of the characters in the novel.  In the original 1915 edition blue was Aunt Polly; green was Nancy; red was Jimmy; and yellow was John Pendleton.  These color associations changed in future editions.<br/><br/>The game is widely recognized as a variant of Parcheesi, which is itself derived from Pachisi, a classic game of India.  The object of Pollyanna, as in all games of the Pachisi family, is to be the first player to move his or her four men from the start space around the board to the home space.  During the course of the game, players may also land on single opposing pieces and send them back to start.  Two or three opposing pieces on the same space can neither be captured nor passed.<br/><br/>Pollyanna differs from Parcheesi in several important ways.<br/><br/><br/>     The track is laid out as a square and is 62 spaces long between start and home (in Parcheesi it is laid out as a cross and is 72 spaces long); furthermore Pollyanna employs four turnouts&mdash;short semi-circular paths off the main path (known as the broadway).  Only single pieces may occupy a turnout space, but pieces there may not be passed and are invulnerable to capture.  Turnouts are the most important difference between Pollyanna and Parcheesi.  They make the two games play quite differently.  <br/><br/><br/><br/>     The bonus move for capturing an opponent's piece is only 10 spaces, and there is no bonus for a piece reaching home (in Parcheesi these pay a 20-space and 10-space bonus respectively).  <br/><br/><br/><br/>     Doubles are handled differently. In Pollyanna each double earns the right to another roll, provided that the player was able to use both dice. (In Parcheesi, on the third consecutive roll of doubles a player loses his/her turn and must return one of his pieces to start.) In addition, only the obverse faces of dice are counted in doubles.  (In Parcheesi, both the obverse faces and reverse faces of the dice are counted.)<br/><br/><br/><br/>     Up to three pieces of the same color may occupy a space on the broadway.  This effectively means that a player can pass his or her own blockade, by first landing exactly on the blockade and joining it, and then moving on.  This is not possible in Parcheesi.<br/><br/><br/><br/>     Pieces are started on a roll of six (on either of the two dice or as the sum of the two dice).  In Parcheesi, the roll required is a five.  This means that starting a piece in Pollyanna is somewhat easier than in Parcheesi.   <br/><br/><br/><br/>     There are safe spaces for each color; there are no general safe spaces.  If a pawn is on a safe space of its own color no other player's pawn may land there, but it may pass through.  <br/><br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": {"76733": "Parker Brothers Edition 1967"}, "average": "6.09375", "name": "Pollyanna", "playingtime": "30", "boardgamemechanic": {"2035": "Roll / Spin and Move"}, "age": "0", "usersrated": "16", "boardgamesubdomain": {"4666": "Abstract Games"}, "boardgamefamily": {"4214": "Pachisi-Ludo"}}, "2562": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic87991.jpg", "poll": {}, "boardgamedesigner": {"53": {"name": "Pascal Bernard"}}, "statistics": {}, "yearpublished": "1999", "maxplayers": "6", "boardgameartist": {"12317": "Thierry Masson"}, "boardgamepublisher": {"42": {"name": "Tilsit"}}, "maxplaytime": "120", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic87991_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "120", "boardgamecategory": {"1021": {"name": "Economic"}}, "boardgamehonor": {"12525": "2002 Lucca Games Best Translated Game"}, "description": "In the XVIth century, during a Japanese civil war, you are a Da&iuml;myo (samourai clan chief) and are attempting to end the civil war by becoming Shogun.

Instead of rolling dice, the attacker simply chooses with a single D6 how many pieces they wish to attack with (subject to restrictions based on terrain).  The D6 is then concealed and the defender attempts to guess it.  If they guess correctly the attacker loses that number of armies; if they guess wrongly one defender is lost, and if the territory is now left unoccupied the selected number of attacking pieces or greater are advanced into the territory to capture it.<br/><br/>Alliances are allowed (and can be broken at will).<br/><br/>A-bombs and the more devastating H-bombs are used in the game.

Along the Soviet border, the relatively open terrain in conjunction with possible outflanking moves through Finnish Lappland allows a rapid Soviet advance. The rest of the Norwegian Arctic is mountainous and can be a formidable barrier if well defended. The Soviet player must make full use of his airmobile, airlanding, and marine forces to penetrate this region, while guarding against raids from U.S. marines and British commandos.<br/>The complex relations between the Soviet Union and the neutral Scandinavian nations - Finland and Sweden - has its effects in the game. Soviet forces may attempt to pass through the Finnish Arctic, and Finland may allow violation of its neutrality or offer limited or full resistance. Sweden will always defend its territory, but its effort may not be total. Also, Sweden may volunteer an expeditionary force to join NATO in Norway even if Sweden neutrality is not violated. Finally, the Soviet high command may mandate a general offensive in Scandinavia rather than just operations against Norway, providing additional forces from the strategic reserve for combat in Finland and Sweden.<br/>Additional rules allow Arctic Front to be combined and played with The Third World War and Southern Front, thus covering all the European war zones of the Third World War. Players can reinforce one front with forces from the others, requiring a host of new decisions on the strategic level.

Both sides try to gain control of the various Iranian factions and influence the other Middle Eastern nations. As the superpowers' confrontation continues, fighting breaks out between committed factions. Either side can decide to send troops to support their factions; the U.S. may send the Rapid Deployment Force while the Soviet Union may use its forces along its southern borders and in Afghanistan. Each move, however, escalates the conflict until the superpowers are directly fighting one another in the Middle East and their alliances in Europe are mobilizing for war.<br/>The four game maps cover the Persian Gulf region in detail.

Mountains and sand dominate this area of the world, and wilderness rules show the effects of the scarcity of roads on military operations. <br/>Vying for control of the nations on these maps are the regional forces and those of the superpowers. These forces range greatly in capabilities: from the poorly-equipped and trained Iranian Revolutionary Guards and Soviet-controlled Afghan Army to the capable Turks to the elite Israeli and Jordanian intervention contingents. The Soviets have large forces available in their southern border regions and in Afghanistan. The small but strong U.S. RDF is on hand, and they can call on B-52 strikes for support.<br/>The rules cover the special political and military situations of the Middle East and the various Arab and Arab-Israeli rivalries are shown.

As I grabbed for the hatch, I was already giving the order to the gunner to traverse the turret. &ldquo;Schnell.&rdquo; One comprehensive glance had taken it all in and fear all but overwhelmed me. Not 50 yards away, a slowly-rising wisp of white smoke gave away the position of the 45mm anti-tank gun pointed straight at the panzer, pointed...so it seemed anyway, straight between my eyes. &ldquo;Hard Right!&rdquo; Beyond it were supporting Russian infantry&mdash;all too visible now behind their chattering small arms fire and the louder, staccato hammering of a supporting heavy machine gun. &ldquo;CLANG&rdquo; The tank shuddered with the reverberation of a direct hit against the front of the revolving turret.

Following in the footsteps of its amazingly successful predecessor, CROSS OF IRON comes replete with an entirely restructured armour and artillery system, which does for armour combat what its predecessor, SQUAD LEADER, did for infantry actions. In fact, the first thing the game instructs you to do is throw away your old artillery and armour counters to make way for their expanded revised counterparts. Each AFV now has three separate MG factors, turret position differentiation, &ldquo;button up&rdquo; penalties, and advantages, target size differentiation, varying amour modifiers and much more. CROSS OF IRON again utilizes programmed instruction to guide you through 8 scenarios of increasing realism and complexity. The 36-page rulebook starts in where the SQUAD LEADER rules left off...at section 63 and continues on to section 103. An expanded Campaign Game enables players to simulate virtually any action of their choosing with a vastly enlarged counter mix encompassing virtually every AFV which saw action WWII...from the diminutive BT5 to the mammoth King Tiger.<br/><br/>CROSS OF IRON is more than just a game.

One human moves at a time, but there is a die face that moves a group of up to 3 at once.  The dinosaurs are restricted to separate zones of the board and only act whilst humans are on their territory.  Like with the humans, only one dinosaur moves per turn, except that a die face allows *all* dinosaurs to move 1 space.  There are some board spaces usable only by humans and vice-versa.<br/><br/>Combat is dice driven as well.

Frodo and his companions journey from Bag End to the destruction of the Ring at Mount Doom. The coverage of the cards is largely loyal to the movies, but it does take some of its lore from the book, and make references to certain atmospheres within the book. Some card sets, such as the Expanded Middle Earth Draft collection, have actors playing roles that were not seen in the movie, replete with costume. This allows for Tom Bombadil and Ghan Buri Ghan (among others) to be considered part of the card game. Nonetheless, they are rare, and typically you feel as if you are playing the movie rather than the book.<br/><br/>The game will be fairly familiar to veteran CCG players with a couple of important exceptions: firstly, combat is magic-like in execution but more incremental in resolution: each &quot;lost&quot; combat results in only a wound, not elimination as in Magic, L5R, Star Wars, or most other CCGs. Each character can suffer a limited number of wounds before being eliminated, but this &quot;health&quot; rating is also expended for card special actions - there is no &quot;tapping&quot;. Also importantly, this is not a &quot;draw one&quot; game but a &quot;hand-filling&quot; game, which results in a very different dynamic. Lastly, like ICEs Middle-Earth CCG that came before, cards are either &quot;hero&quot; or &quot;shadow&quot; cards; when you play Free Peoples cards in your turn, you effectively pay their cost in Twilight Points to your opponent, who then turns around and uses those points to play Shadow Cards to attack you.<br/><br/>As a final comment, Decipher finally saw the light and put a 4-card cap on every card during deck building (and this includes variations; so there is an Aragorn: Ranger of the North and an Aragorn: King in Exile; you can only have total of 4 combined). Additionally, there is a much more sane rarity distribution than previous Decipher products (many - in fact most - familiar characters are common or uncommon, or at least have common or uncommon variations that are no less powerful than the rare versions).<br/><br/>This game &quot;ended&quot; when Decipher ran into financial difficulties and let the license expire.

This game DOVER PATROL along with L'Attaque and Aviation: The Aerial Tactics Game of Attack and Defence were each designed by Harry Gibson along with a more complicated incorporation of all three, a game called  Tri-Tactics<br/><br/>Note: L'Attaque was patented in 1909 in France by a woman with a French name.  Whether Harry Gibson designed that game is therefore open to some doubt.<br/><br/>Stratego is very much like L'Attaque, published after World War II when the patent would have expired.<br/><br/>The board, which supposedly represents an area of sea, is superimposed with a rectangular grid. A Base is shown on two of the opposite edges of the board. The area round each base is protected by a harbour wall.<br/><br/>Each player has a fleet of forty playing pieces. These pieces are rectangles of cardboard which stand upon plastic supports. The two sides are distinguished by the colour on the back of each card, red and blue in this case. The fronts of the cards depict various ships, mines and a flying boat. Each piece has a printed value from 1 for a Patrol Vessel to 10 for the Flagship. These values represent the relative strength of each ship and also indicate the type of ship; battle cruisers, light cruisers, etc.. The ships are also named, H.M.S. Lion, H.M.S. Glasgow and so on. The object of the game is to capture the enemy Flag and transport it back to one's own base while still retaining possession of one's own Flag.<br/><br/>To start the game, the players place their Flag on their Base and then set up their pieces, one per rectangle, on their own side of the board and with the backs of the cards facing the opponent. In turn the players move a piece one space orthogonally until two opposing pieces are back-to-back. The moving player may then call 'Attack', the two relevant pieces are then revealed and the one with the lower value is sunk and removed from the board.<br/><br/>In addition to the fighting ships, the players have a number of auxiliary pieces. Mines will automatically blow up virtually all ships that are moved into an attacking position, regardless of whether the owner of the moving ship attacks or not. Once placed, mines may not be moved. Only the mine sweepers can destroy mines. The mine layers act as floating mines. They can be moved but may not attack, but have the same effect upon enemy shipping as a mine. Only the destroyers can sink them. Submarines have a marauding role and can sink all ships except mine layers and MTB's. The good old flying boat has a very important role as it is principally used to capture the enemy flag because it can fly over the harbour walls. Only MTB's and destroyers can shoot it down. When the opposing flag is captured, it is clipped to the top of the capturing piece and thus its whereabouts are known to all. The Flag can be transferred to any other piece standing orthogonally adjacent to the piece which is transporting it.<br/><br/>It is a fairly straightforward game to play, though tactics can well be employed, particularly in the setting up phase.<br/><br/>"}, "2607": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic156545.jpg", "poll": {}, "boardgamedesigner": {"11656": {"name": "Walter Lee"}}, "statistics": {}, "yearpublished": "1938", "maxplayers": "6", "age": "8", "boardgamepublisher": {"253": {"name": "Editrice Giochi"}}, "maxplaytime": "90", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic156545_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "90", "boardgamecategory": {"1031": {"name": "Racing"}}, "description": "The object of the game according to the early editions of the rules is to own the horse that wins the race.

Players race mules and men to the end of the track and back. However, it has some interesting features, particularly in the determination of the winner. Depending upon the number of players, in addition to the mules, there are either 1 or 2 men in the race, each of a unique color. Each player guides either a mule or a man. On a turn, two color dice are rolled and the appropriate tokens moved forward. If two of the same color are rolled, then that token moves backwards one space. Simple enough so far.<br/><br/>The twist is that the next player may opt to keep intact one of the dice and only roll the remaining die. This subtle rules twist allows for some 'catch-up' ability, as well as some nice hoseage as it makes it possible to move one player's token on several consecutive turns if all players keep that die intact. This may sound like a good thing for the affected player, but in reality being the first to cross the finish line is NOT always the best occurrence. What? Well, the game has a very clever mechanism to determine the winner.<br/><br/>If you are the first player to have your token cross the finish line, then you only win if the last piece remaining on the track is a man piece. Otherwise, if the final piece remaining is a mule, then that player is the winner! So, you have to make a judgment during the game as to whether you want to try to finish first or last, then attempt to move the other pieces accordingly.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "3", "boardgameversion": {"139817": "Klee Edition 1999"}, "name": "Das St\u00f6rrische Muli", "playingtime": "20", "boardgamemechanic": {"2035": "Roll / Spin and Move"}, "average": "6", "usersrated": "36", "age": "8"}, "2610": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic514076.jpg", "boardgameimplementation": {"5795": "Richelieu"}, "poll": {}, "boardgamedesigner": {"86": {"name": "Michael Schacht"}}, "statistics": {}, "yearpublished": "2001", "maxplayers": "5", "boardgameartist": {"22496": "Hans-J\u00f6rg Brehm"}, "boardgamepublisher": {"1001": {"name": "(Web published)"}}, "maxplaytime": "45", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic514076_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "45", "boardgamecategory": {"1002": {"name": "Card Game"}}, "description": "Kardinal &amp; K&ouml;nig - Das Kartenspiel is the card game based on the &quot;Kardinal &amp; K&ouml;nig&quot; boardgame from Goldsieber Spiele (also issued as &quot;Web of Power&quot; by Rio Grande Games).  <br/>  <br/>Idea of the game  <br/>Europe, the center of power in the 12th century.

Only after 3 bidding rounds will you get more small cards in your hand.<br/><br/>The idea is to place the stones in the right order, which is stated on the card you have hidden from your opponents. You may score a row or column five times during the game even when it isn't your turn. When both color and position match you you place a so-called &quot;2F&quot; or &quot;3F&quot; marker at the row/column which will bring you 2 or 3 points for each correct stone - which can amount to quite a good score in the long 5 stone row. If only the color, but not the position, is correct you use the &quot;2A&quot; or &quot;1A&quot; markers.  One or two points per stone won't get you far, especially in the short 3-stone row, but the most important aspect is not to use the markers too soon.  Firstly, because you cannot score a particular row/column more than once, secondly because you can get your points in the second half of the game.<br/><br/>When all stones have been placed onto the board the second half of the game beings.  Here you may rearrange the stones. Before the game is over you may you exchange two stones with each other five times.  You shouldn't use your 2- or 3-marker on the short rows/columns, but rather concentrate on the longer. The board has two 5-, four 4- and four 3-rows, and if you don't get the maximum points early in the game will you have to look foolishly on as your opponent places his markers on the two 5- and three of the 4-rows to score maximum points.<br/><br/>"}, "2621": {"boardgamedesigner": {"1067": {"name": "Oliver Deiser"}}, "poll": {}, "name": "Claim", "playingtime": "30", "minplayers": "2", "yearpublished": "1999", "usersrated": "17", "boardgamesubdomain": {"4666": "Abstract Games"}, "maxplayers": "4", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1264722_t.jpg", "average": "7.74706", "statistics": {}, "boardgamepublisher": {"573": {"name": "Caroli Spiel"}}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1264722.jpg", "boardgamefamily": {"24777": "Dots and Boxes"}, "maxplaytime": "30", "boardgamecategory": {"1009": {"name": "Abstract Strategy"}}, "age": "12", "minplaytime": "30", "description": "Claim is an abstract tactical game for 2, 3, or 4 players (two teams of 2), age 12 and up.

With luck you will be able to help him find his treasure again. The player that finds the most of the Pharaoh's treasures and thereby collects the greatest number of search cards is the winner.<br/><br/>After chips have placed in the game board, pyramids placed on top and the board spun around a few times in the hopes the players won&rsquo;t know where treasure chips are located, the first player chooses a treasure card which assigns the number or points that the treasure will be worth would the player find it. The treasure cards have been separated into three piles marked 1, 2 and 3. Once pile 1 is exhausted, game continues with pile 2, etc. Then the player slides a pyramid into an empty space on the board. If no treasure chip is found, the player moves another pyramid. If the chip does not match his card, their turn is over. If the treasure is found, the player keeps the treasure card but the token stays where it is.<br/><br/>Mixed in with the treasure cards are event cards as follows:<br/><br/>Sandstorm: Turn the board through 180 degrees and take the next pile from the card.<br/><br/>Gift: Move to one of the twelve treasures.  Each player that has one or more search cards depicting this treasure must give you one of them.<br/><br/>Risk: Nominate two treasures that are not currently displayed on the board.  Move first to one and then to the other.  If you succeed - well done!  If you don't then you must give one of your opponents' one of your search cards.<br/><br/>Mirage: You draw a search card from your right hand neighbor's collection.  If you are able to move to this treasure without making a mistake then you may keep the card.  If you do not manage it then you must give your right hand neighbor one of your cards.<br/><br/>Desert Poker: A player of you choice must try to find a treasure that you nominate.

The British have four armies of 5 units each, 3 warships and a troop carrier with 2 reinforcements on board. The Americans have 16 units spread all over the board (including a special &quot;Continental Army&quot; unit), 1 warship and a troop carrier with 4 reinforcements on board.<br/><br/>The Americans use two dice for movement (unless down to just one unit), the British one. All three dice are 0-1-1-1-2-3. Both players roll their dice using shakers and peek at them. The British player designates the unit he'll move, then the American reveals his throw and moves. Finally, the Bristish reveals his throw and moves.<br/><br/>A single unit is moved by each die --the grid is square and no diagonals are allowed. Units that end up on the same spot stack to form an army (which cannot be split), but each army is limited to 6 units. Naval moves are harbour to harbour except for the troop carriers (and any warship attempting to intercept them).<br/><br/>A Skirmish occurs when opposing units are adjacent. A card is drawn to resolve the Skirmish. This can result in a unit loss for either side (sometimes two), a major battle being triggered, or one or both armies moving a space or two. Major battles normally occur when an army lands on an enemy army by exact count; numerical superiority is added to the stronger side's throw, and the adjusted throw difference indicates how many units the losing side lost (however, that loss is limited to the number of units in the winning army).<br/><br/>Once the British have lost an army, they can call for Reinforcements. The Americans can do this once they've won a Major Battle. Reinforcement play is resolved separately from normal play. Two dice are used by both sides, one player trying to bring in his troop carrier whilst the other attempts to intercept with a warship (if the opponent has no warships left, the reinforcements automatically succeed). If the troop carrier makes it to a harbor, the reinforcements land (triggering a major battle if the harbor is enemy-held) and the troop carrier remains as a normal warship henceforth.<br/><br/>The British win by eliminating the Continental Army, whilst the American wins by eliminating all four British armies. To keep the game from dragging on, if there is no skirmish nor major battle in 10 moves, the weaker side surrenders.<br/><br/>The asymmetrical mechanics work surprisingly well; the British lacks mobility and try to force Major Battles on the Americans, whilst the latter skirmish as much as possible until they can muster a large enough army together to win a major battle and call in their reinforcements.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": {"108302": "Milton Bradley First Edition"}, "average": "6.05613", "name": "Skirmish", "playingtime": "60", "boardgamemechanic": {"2072": "Dice Rolling"}, "age": "10", "usersrated": "155", "boardgamesubdomain": {"4664": "Wargames"}, "boardgamefamily": {"3161": "American Heritage Games"}}, "2428": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic52510.jpg", "poll": {}, "boardgamedesigner": {"3": {"name": "(Uncredited)"}}, "statistics": {}, "yearpublished": "1961", "maxplayers": "4", "age": "10", "boardgamepublisher": {"20": {"name": "Milton Bradley"}}, "maxplaytime": "60", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic52510_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "60", "boardgamecategory": {"1048": {"name": "American Civil War"}}, "description": "One of the American Heritage Command Decision Strategy Games.<br/><br/>This one is the American Civil War game.

On your turn, you roll two dice for movement, resulting in between 2 and 12 movement points to allocate.  Infantry moves 1 per pip, cavalry and artillery 2 per pip (a one-square move still consumes 1 pip).  Mountains force pieces to pause (they must stop until the next turn).  Railroads link stations and can be used to accelerate movement (one station per pip).<br/><br/>Combat is handled by lining pieces up (horizontally or vertically) to face (or flank) an enemy column.  You must have battle strength superiority to resolve the battle, and this is done after movement is concluded.  Infantry and artillery have combat strength 2, cavalry has combat strength 1.  The rear piece then jumps to the other end of the combined columns, and the entire enemy army is removed.  To be used, cavalry must have a piece at the front; artillery, if at the rear of your column, eliminates the enemy army without jumping.  Artillery cannot attack by itself.  Double jumps can happen, if the jumping infantry piece ends up facing a lone cavalry.  An open square must exist to jump to, so some map deployments are &quot;safe&quot; --but not against artillery.  However, pieces trapped so they cannot move are also removed as if they had lost a battle, so this strategy can backfire.<br/><br/>You win by completely eliminating the enemy army --but a player may concede earlier when a loss becomes unavoidable.

Using a unique movement system that forces players to deal with momentum, and a fast and simple combat system, LNL is a great addition to the space game genre.<br/><br/>The game involves combat between the Moon and Earth, with individual ships represented by each counter.  Each side has from 3-8 ships.  Each ship has a log covering armament, fuel, engines and defence.  These logs are reminiscent or the Task Force Game 'Starfire', but have fewer options, but a more sophisticated layout.<br/><br/>The heart of the game is a vector-momentum system (like the one in Yaquinto's Shooting Stars or SPI's Vector Three).  Ships have a facing, use fuel to thrust towards the current facing, but speeds carry over from turn to turn.  Therefore ships can only decelerate only by turning and thrusting in the opposite direction of travel.  Speed is marked by placing numbered counters in the relevant direction.<br/><br/>Combat involves the use of missiles, guns (i.e. projectile weapons) and lasers.  Missiles are launched and move much like ships.  They are more manoeuvrable, but have a limited amount of fuel, used for acceleration and turning.  As a defence ships may have point defence weapons.  Guns and lasers are ranged weapons, with different arcs of fire, but essentially the same resolution.  Damage is assessed by throwing the requisite number of dice - any dice will do, or  even coins - the game using an EOR (even/odds randomiser) - with odd rolls yielding a hit.  Damage is then marked off the ship, with the affected area depending on the side through which fire was taken.<br/><br/>Each side (Moon and Earth) has a choice of 8 types of ships and 5 basic scenarios are available, each with a great deal of flexibility.

Time to learn is from 30-45 minutes.<br/><br/>Players take the role of squadron commanders, the principal tactical leaders in the battle fleet.  As such, they are in charge of a manageable force of capital ships, generally 3-12.  Designed for 2 players, Queen Victoria's Navy is also suitable for solitaire or multiple players, each scenario taking about 1 hour to complete.<br/><br/>This game manages to blend three often contradictory goals together seamlessly: affordability, game-play, and authenticity.  The focus of the game is to recreate the conditions of a capital ship battle.  Torpedo boats, gunboats and sundry other smaller vessels have been left out of the game as they were not critical components of the Battle Fleet concept, and their inclusion would have added complexity and cost to the game.

There are therefore 18 stories to the Jenga tower. Since stacking the blocks neatly can be tedious, a plastic loading tray is included.<br/><br/>Once the tower is built, the person who built the tower moves first. Moving in Jenga consists of taking one and only one block from any story except the completed top story of the tower at the time of the turn, and placing it on the topmost story in order to complete it. Only one hand at a time may be used to remove a block; both hands can be used, but only one hand may be on the tower at a time. Blocks may be bumped to find a loose block that will not disturb the rest of the tower. Any block that is moved out of place may be left out of place if it is determined that it will knock the tower over if it is removed. The turn ends when the next person to move touches the tower, although he or she can wait 10 seconds before moving for the previous turn to end if they believe the tower will fall in that time.<br/><br/>The game ends when the tower falls in any significant way -- in other words, any piece falls from the tower, other than the piece being knocked out to move to the top.

Each player chooses a color and places that set of 21 pieces in front of his/her side of the board.  The order of play is as follows: blue, yellow, red, and then green.<br/><br/>2.  The first player (blue) places any of his/her pieces in a corner square.  Play proceeds clockwise around the board (yellow, red, and green), each player putting their first piece down in one of the corner squares.<br/><br/>3.  Play continues as each player lays down one piece during a turn.<br/><br/>Each new piece must touch at least one other piece of the same color, but only at the corners.<br/><br/>No flat edges of same color pieces can touch.<br/><br/>There are no restrictions on how pieces of different colors can touch one another.<br/><br/>4.

It's your job to ward off this threat before it's too late.<br/>Published in 1983, the Zaxxon Board Game was one of Milton Bradley&rsquo;s numerous attempts to translate video games to board games.<br/><br/>HOW TO PLAY THE GAME: <br/>1. ROLLING THE DIE: both players roll their die AT THE SAME TIME. Reroll the die if there is a tie. On EACH turn, the player rolling the Lower Number on the die ALWAYS plays first. Then the player rolling the Higher Number plays second. <br/>2. USING THE SPINNER: the player rolling the Lower Number spins the spinner. The spinner controls enemy fire directed at fighter planes from missile silos and gun turrets (later in the game the spinner will also control the movement of Zaxxon). When RED is spun, any plane that is in or enters a missile silo area CONTAINING A MISSILE SILO is shot down and returned to its home base. When BLUE is spun, any plane that is in a gun turret area CONTAINING A GUN TURRET is shot down and returned to its home base. If a missile silo or a gun turret has been shot and removed from the board, there is no enemy fire from that area so any planes in that area are safe. Notice that the missile silo areas are surrounded by a red border and the gun turret areas are surrounded by a blue border. See Figures 5A and 5B for locations. When WHITE is spun, all planes are safe. Please Note: if your plane is shot down by a missile silo or gun turret in the inner fortress, return it to a RESTART space in your outer fortress. <br/>3. ORDER OF PLAY: after spinning the spinner, the player who rolled the Lower Number moves his or her plane or planes according to the die count just rolled. Then the player who rolled the Higher Number moves his or her plane or planes according to the die count just rolled. You can move one of your planes the full amount on the die or move both of your planes, splitting the die count between them in any combination<br/>4. HOW A FIGHTER PLANE MOVES: a fighter plane can move from one space to any adjacent space by die count as shown in Figure 6. A plane can change direction or land on the same space more than once on the same turn. A plane cannot pass over or land on a space occupied by another plane. A fighter plane can &quot;fly&quot; at High Altitude or Low Altitude by raising or lowering it on its base. Each change in altitude (either High to Low or Low to High) counts as ONE on your die count. Your plane must be at Low Altitude to shoot a target and at High Altitude to cross a wall.<br/><br/>HOW TO WIN THE GAME: <br/>Be the first player to destroy your enemy targets and shoot Zaxxon with both of your fighter planes.<br/><br/>"}, "2483": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic69149.jpg", "poll": {}, "boardgamedesigner": {"1013": {"name": "Allen Hammack"}}, "statistics": {}, "yearpublished": "1982", "maxplayers": "2", "boardgameartist": {"11998": "James Holloway"}, "boardgamepublisher": {"5018": {"name": "Encore (for boardgames)"}}, "maxplaytime": "45", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic69149_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "45", "boardgamecategory": {"1010": {"name": "Fantasy"}}, "description": "A wargame simulating the battle of Ragnar&ouml;k between Odin and the other Gods of Asgard and Loki and the Forces of Chaos.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": {"110091": "Encore Polish Edition"}, "average": "6.06818", "name": "Viking Gods", "playingtime": "45", "boardgamemechanic": {"2072": "Dice Rolling"}, "age": "8", "usersrated": "110", "boardgamesubdomain": {"4664": "Wargames"}, "boardgamefamily": {"13300": "TSR Minigames"}}, "2484": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic335384.jpg", "poll": {}, "boardgamedesigner": {"8395": {"name": "O.

Points can also be picked up in later turns for being the general in charge at a victorious battle, and for winning elections in specific provinces.<br/><br/>Normally the player with the most victory points will win.  However, there are two sudden death game end conditions that may alter the outcome.  The first is a radical electoral landslide, triggered by the red faction gaining 17 or more votes.  The second is  successful Royalist counter-revolution, precipitated by Royalist control of seven counter-revolutionary provinces.  In both cases, victory is determined by a different set of criteria, in which accrued victory points do not count.  The player who is ahead on points must be aware that one mistake could lead to defeat at the hands of the Jacobins or Royalists!<br/><br/>It is likely that you will never have played a game quite like this one and you may find yourself wondering what strategies to employ.  Do not despair!  Once you have completed your first game you will realize that amongst the apparent chaos of the game there are many opportunities for long-term planning.<br/><br/>Libert&eacute; is #6 in the Valley Games Classic Line<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "3", "boardgameversion": {"21355": "Multilingual first edition"}, "average": "7.18994", "name": "Libert\u00e9", "playingtime": "120", "boardgamemechanic": {"2080": "Area Control / Area Influence"}, "age": "12", "usersrated": "2279", "boardgamesubdomain": {"5497": "Strategy Games"}, "boardgamefamily": {"11006": "Country: France"}}, "2508": {"boardgamedesigner": {"3": {"name": "(Uncredited)"}}, "poll": {}, "name": "Caverns Deep", "playingtime": "360", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": {"2035": "Roll / Spin and Move"}, "yearpublished": "1980", "usersrated": "10", "maxplayers": "2", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic51336_t.jpg", "average": "4.75", "statistics": {}, "boardgamepublisher": {"547": {"name": "Ral Partha Enterprises"}}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic51336.jpg", "boardgameversion": {"172603": "Ral Partha First Edition"}, "maxplaytime": "360", "boardgamecategory": {"1022": {"name": "Adventure"}}, "age": "10", "minplaytime": "360", "description": "The game of life-or-death combat between the dwarves and their mortal enemies, the goblins.

Players build up armies of equivalent point values to fight each other.  The point value of a basic unit can be cheap, but can be increased by giving the unit better weapons, skills and spells.  Players are free to customize the standard units presented in the rulebook or create their own.

During a turn, Class 1 units (the most mobile) act first.  The player who won the roll for initiative at the start of the turn enacts his or her orders for her Class 1 units before the opponent moves theirs.  They then repeat the same for their Class 2, Class 3, and lastly Class 4 units.

As an admiral of an ocean-going war fleet you must command your ships - which can be either  squadrons of Ships of the Line or heavily armored Men O' War, in the battle for supremacy of the high seas.<br/><br/>Players choose fleets from the multitude of races of the Warhammer world. Every ship is represented by a template showing individual areas, each with a description of the items (masts, cannons etc.) in those areas - as well as the damage that they can take before being destroyed. Each location has a value that must be rolled to hit that area when attacked, along with another value that can be rolled by the defending player to possibly prevent any damage that might occur. Ships are classified as Ship of the Line (SOL) - which are designed to move as a group of three (each moving and fighting to completion before continuing on with the next ship in the squadron), a Man O' War (MOW)- which are single ships that are much larger, more powerful and crewed by larger numbers than a single SOL classed ship, or finally as an Independent (IND) - which are used individually like a Man O' War but are more in line in strength and abilities to that of a Ship of the Line.<br/><br/>At the beginning of each turn, players determine Initiative by each rolling a die which determines either who will go 1st in each phase - if the numbers are different, or how the wind direction changes if they both roll the same number. If the wind changes, the initiative roll and resolution is repeated until one player wins the die roll.<br/><br/>Players then conduct the Magic Phase with each Admiral having his Wizard make one spell attempt if desired. If a spell is successful, the other player can try and dispel that cast spell if they have a corresponding type of magic to make the attempt.<br/><br/>Next comes the Battle phase which is based on the previously determined initiative roll and players alternate between phases of Movement/Combat, each choosing a single MOW, IND or SOL Squadron and then conducting movement and making attacks before passing the turn sequence back to their opponent. This process continues until all ships have moved on both sides. Once that has occurred, the turn is over and a series of quick turn ending/record keeping events occurs before moving to the next turn. Game play continues for a predetermined time or until one side is destroyed, surrenders or flees the battlefield.<br/><br/>There were two separate expansions to the main game. The first was Plaguefleet which added rules and templates for the Chaos fleets of Khorne, Slaanesh, Tzeentch and Nurgle (collectively known as a Plaguefleet), the Skaven and finally the Chaos Dwarfs. This expansion effectively doubled the number of available fleets for the game. This expansion also included color templates for the original 6 races as well (Imperial, Bretonnian, Dwarf, High Elf, Dark Elf and Orc).<br/><br/>The 2nd expansion Sea of Blood mainly introduced new rules for Airpower, Sea Monsters &amp; Beasts and Allies as well as new ships for the Dwarfs and Imperial fleets. The inclusion of the Norse fleet wrapped up the content for this expansion.<br/><br/>Finally, complete rules for an Undead fleet - as well as some expansion rules for a few of the other races, were included in several of the issues of Game Workshop's Citadel Journal magazine.<br/><br/>A wide variety of miniatures were produced to represent the many ships detailed in the main game and expansion sets but no miniatures were ever officially made for the Undead fleet. Assembling and painting the miniatures gave the game a feeling of being &quot;collectible&quot; as well as being a hobby in itself. Many players have created customized ships and new ships (and even complete fleets) including rules, ships templates and completed miniatures. The largest collection of these creations is housed at the Yahoo group Sea of Claws.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": {"155211": "Games Workshop First Edition"}, "average": "7.14075", "name": "Man O' War", "playingtime": "180", "boardgamemechanic": {"2072": "Dice Rolling"}, "age": "12", "boardgameexpansion": {}, "usersrated": "675", "boardgamesubdomain": {"5496": "Thematic Games"}, "boardgamefamily": {"4327": "Warhammer Fantasy Wargames"}}, "2517": {"boardgamedesigner": {"3": {"name": "(Uncredited)"}}, "poll": {}, "name": "Ulcers", "playingtime": "90", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": {"2078": "Point to Point Movement"}, "yearpublished": "1969", "usersrated": "139", "maxplayers": "4", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic252332_t.jpg", "average": "5.41367", "statistics": {}, "boardgamepublisher": {"858": {"name": "Grow Jogos e Brinquedos"}}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic252332.jpg", "boardgameversion": {"151223": "Grow Portuguese edition"}, "maxplaytime": "90", "boardgamecategory": {"1017": {"name": "Dice"}}, "age": "10", "minplaytime": "90", "description": "This game's theme is fairly unique: you are trying to assemble a full staff of personnel (two secretaries, two salesmen, one sales manager, one vice-president and one president) to run your company.

It is played on a map which displays 74 star sytems in a three-dimensional &quot;sphere&quot; of space measuring roughly 40 light years in diameter, with our home system at the center. A grid of hexagons printed over the map is used to regulate movement and position of pieces.<br/><br/>The pieces in the game represent groups of four interstellar spaceships (StarForces) and space stations (StarGates). Each Player maneuvers his pieces (via Stellar Shifting) to engage those of the enemy. Battles take place when units are in the same three-dimensional position. The total variable strengths of the involved units are compared. The attacking Player consults a simple probability table to determine the outcome of each battle. Movement is plotted and executed simultaneously. The game proceeds this way (for a specified number of turns) as the players try to achieve the objectives set forth in the rules. No prior knowledge is required to play the game - just a little ingenuity and common sense.&quot;<br/><br/><br/>Part of the StarForce Trilogy box set, along with Outreach and StarSoldier.

(Copper Kettle, or since it's about witches, Copper Cauldron Co.) we imagine witches or wizards shopping for ingredients for their magic potions.  Your token moves around the perimeter of an array of cards (ingredients) and you pick one from the row or column where you stop.  The number on the card you pick dictates how many spaces you move on your next turn.  You try to collect sets of four matching ingredients and get penalty points if you have only one of a particular ingredient.  The scoring rules can be made more complicated if the players desire, but for most the basic rules are satisfying.  A touch of memory is involved since you can see only the last ingredient you picked up on your stack of cards.<br/><br/><br/>Game Summary<br/>Create a 6x6 grid of ingredient cards (numbered 1-4, 14 ingredient types; 2 each in 5 colors, and the player colors black and white) minus the corners. Place the 2 player pawns on opposite corners. Each player gets a random card (not of their color) in front of them. For the advanced game, players also get 2 recipe cards = bonus points at end of game if you meet the conditions (e.g., at least 3 cards of both ingredients in a color; fewer 4s than the other player, etc.).<br/><br/>On your turn, move clockwise as many spaces around the grid as the number showing on your card stack, then take a card in that row and place on top of your stack (may never look through your stack) -- if land on corner, get nothing. Place the top card from the draw deck in the empty spot. If you drew a card with a magic hat/wand icon, take a second turn (max 2 consecutive turns). If you got a card with an exploding icon, the other player places their top card on the bottom of the draw deck (if deck empty, remove card from game instead).<br/><br/>The game ends when any row is empty. Then sort your cards by ingredient type and score according to number of each type:<br/>- 1 = negative points<br/>- 2 = 0<br/>- 3 = sum<br/>- 4 = sum + 5 (i.e., 15 VP)<br/>- then, if in your own color, double the value<br/>- score any bonus points from end-game recipes.<br/>Most points wins!<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": {"23705": "German edition with 2002 Spiel des Jahres Recommendation"}, "average": "6.93634", "name": "Kupferkessel Co.", "playingtime": "30", "boardgamemechanic": {"2011": "Modular Board"}, "age": "8", "usersrated": "1013", "boardgamesubdomain": {"5499": "Family Games"}, "boardgamefamily": {"22783": "Admin: Better Description Needed!"}}, "2534": {"boardgamedesigner": {"1813": {"name": "Didier Jacob\u00e9e"}}, "poll": {}, "name": "Stargate SG-1: La Vengeance d'Apophis", "playingtime": "120", "minplayers": "2", "yearpublished": "2001", "usersrated": "7", "boardgamefamily": {"16966": "TV Series: Stargate"}, "maxplayers": "6", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic151540_t.jpg", "average": "4.64286", "statistics": {}, "boardgamepublisher": {"42": {"name": "Tilsit"}}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic151540.jpg", "boardgameversion": {"158963": "Tilsit First Edition"}, "maxplaytime": "120", "boardgamecategory": {"1020": {"name": "Exploration"}}, "age": "10", "minplaytime": "120", "description": "Tilsit &Eacute;ditions gives you the chance to travel across the universe to prevent the accomplishment of the revenge of the Goa'Uld System Lord, Apophis.

The deck consists of four suits of cards numbered 1 to 7. The 1s have three stars, the 2s have two stars and all other cards have one star. Players start with 150 points (which serves as a starting score and a money pool for bidding). For 2 players, use 16 cards, for 3 players use 21 cards, for 4 players use 24 cards (so that players do not know which cards are in play) and these are auctioned off one at a time. Bid increments must be at least as great as the number of the card being auctioned but can be more - i.e. while bidding on a card with the number 4, a bid of four would require a bid of 8 or more from the next bidder). The first bid can be lower, the same or higher than the number of the card.  Bidding goes clockwise around the table.  First bid also moves clockwise around the table. When all cards have been auctioned, suits are scored separately for each player by adding the card numbers and multiplying that figure by the total number of stars in the suit. Scores for each suit are added to any remaining points from a players' starting pool (points remaining from the original pool of 150) to determine the final score.
