During a RED AEGIS campaign, your decedents, called scions, will lead successive generations from the setting's ancient past to the far future from axe-wielding savages to planetary soldiers packing gravity hammers, and everything in between. Choose your flavor of dominance through aggressive conflict, crafty subterfuge, or spiritual supremacy.<br/><br/>RED AEGIS is about making difficult choices. These decisions will impact not only your tribe's future, but also the fate of your descendants and the world they inhabit.<br/><br/>The stories that emerge from playing RED AEGIS are a direct result of your unique exploits while traversing through time.<br/><br/>We would like to give a special thank you to our cadre of associate game designers. They have been instrumental in ironing out the kinks in the alpha version of this document. Each of them is a great asset to this team and their input has been invaluable.<br/><br/>From the Core Book's Introduction<br/><br/>RED AEGIS is a game that at once feels both familiar and unique indeed, it is a curious fusion of traditional tabletop roleplaying and 4X turn-based strategy games. In RED AEGIS, players assume the role of clan scions the would-be champions of their age. Together, the players must unite the disparate clans into a cohesive tribe to thwart a looming peril that threatens to scour their civilization from the history books.<br/><br/>RED AEGIS combines the fast, tactical gameplay of a boardgame with the narrative storytelling and worldbuilding of traditional roleplaying games. The campaign plays out over nine game sessions, each set in a time period more advanced than the last. By the final session, thousands of years will have passed, seeing your tribe advance from primitive hunter-gatherers to a spacefaring civilization colonizing the stars.<br/><br/>Reflecting back upon your campaign, you'll discover a vibrant game world, its unique history and cultures designed entirely from the imaginations of you and your fellow players. That's the real secret of RED AEGIS.<br/><br/>"}, "164037": {"rpgdesigner": ["D. T. Butchino"], "rpg": ["Mutants & Masterminds (3rd Edition)"], "poll": [], "name": "DragonFire", "rpgartist": ["D. T.

When the cat enters the same tile as a rat, he or she must discard a card in hand. When the ratcatcher enters the same tile as a rat, he or she must lose a card from his or her buffet.

Each component has a unique number of bugs with a unique level of severity. The test leads take turn to analyse the application (to learn where bugs are likely to find) and to place testers in the application (to find those bugs). Each bug scores a value according to its severity level.<br/><br/>Once a set of components is perceived to be bug free, a test lead may let a tester cover the entire set and thus increase the probability of finding bugs in the next round. However, if the test lead is wrong, the tester's effort is lost so don't be too fast!<br/><br/>The winner is the one who finds most bugs.<br/><br/>Find the Bug! is mainly designed for IT professionals who want to learn testing in a fun way. However, ordinary gamers may also enjoy this deductive challenge where you must use your limited resources efficiently and monitor the other player's actions carefully to Find the Bug!<br/><br/>Game mechanisms include:<br/><br/>1. Changing and hidden game board: The number, value and location of the bugs is different in each game and they are hidden to the players.<br/>2.

It also utilizes the High School map put together by the always-awesome Fabled Environments, and while this adventure does not require it, it was built specifically to use their map!<br/><br/>"}, "164098": {"rpgdesigner": ["David Baymiller", "Kevin Rohan"], "rpgitemversion": ["PDF version"], "statistics": [], "name": "Brain Slugs from Planet X (Savage Worlds)", "rpgartist": ["Brian Brinlee", "Ben Overmyer"], "rpgproducer": ["Kevin Rohan"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2204416.jpg", "usersrated": "1", "average": "5", "rpggenre": ["Childhood", "Science Fiction"], "rpgpublisher": ["Silver Gryphon Games"], "rpg": ["Savage Worlds"], "rpgcategory": ["Scenario / Adventure / Module"], "poll": [], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2204416_t.jpg", "description": "From publisher blurb:<br/><br/>What you are about to read is a treatment of B-movies as translated into Savage Worlds.

The tile might feature a city, a road, a cloister, grassland or some combination thereof, and it must be placed adjacent to tiles that have already been played, in such a way that cities are connected to cities, roads to roads, etcetera. Having placed a tile, the player can then decide to place one of his meeples on one of the areas on it: on the city as a knight, on the road as a robber, on a cloister as a monk, or on the grass as a farmer.

Included are the buzzsaw drone (CRs 3 and 4), the harvester (CRs 9 and 11), and the witchstalker engine (CRs 13 and 16). The buzzsaw drone is a flying reconnaissance robot with a body shaped like (and used as) a buzzsaw, allowing it to cut through enemies and obstacles alike. While it can perform powerful sweeping dive attacks, its flight is easily disturbed, and successive strikes can quickly knock it to the ground. The harvester also features buzzsaws: one on each arm, which the mythic version can even launch into the air to act as buzzsaw drones. It travels on powerful treadmills which can crush its foes, and has a swivel-mounted laser drill. Finally, the witchstalker engine is built to hunt down and capture spellcasters, and features a number of abilities that allow it to negate the power of such creatures, including a special chamber for storing them, which prevents dimensional travel and&mdash;in the mythic version&mdash;all magic, entirely.<br/><br/>"}, "164143": {"boardgamedesigner": ["Christine Antonellis"], "average": "0", "poll": [], "name": "Scary Cape Creatures", "playingtime": "0", "minplayers": "2", "yearpublished": "2007", "usersrated": "0", "maxplayers": "4", "boardgameartist": ["Ethan Renoe"], "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["Cockle Cove Press"], "boardgameversion": ["First edition"], "maxplaytime": "0", "boardgamecategory": ["Card Game"], "age": "8", "minplaytime": "0", "description": "Scary Cape Creatures is a card game for 2-4 players, ages 8 to adult.

Denkbar einfach sind dabei die Regeln. Karte spielen, Aufgabe erf&uuml;llen und Punkte kassieren. Aus drei Kategorien k&ouml;nnen die Spieler eine Aufgabe w&auml;hlen: Quizfragen, Knobel- und Geschicklichkeitsaufgaben.<br/><br/>Eine Quizfrage stellt man einem beliebigen Mitspieler. Kann dieser die Frage richtig beantworten, bekommt auch der Fragensteller Punkte. Man muss also kein Quizmaster sein, um Punkte zu bekommen. Die Mitspieler richtig einsch&auml;tzen zu k&ouml;nnen, ist viel wichtiger. Bei den Knobelaufgaben gilt es Kombinationen mit den verschiedenen Eigenschaften der Karten zu bilden: Farbe, Buchstabe oder Zahl zu Drillingen, W&ouml;rtern oder Stra&szlig;en formen und Punkte kassieren. Die Geschicklichkeitsaufgaben fordern Balance, Fingerfertigkeit und Spontanit&auml;t von den Spielern. Aber auch eine gute Beobachtungsgabe kann hilfreich sein um Punkte zu machen, gibt es ja noch diese &bdquo;Geheim&ldquo;-Karten. Passt man nicht gut auf, landet so eine fiese Karte schnell auf dem eigenen Punktestapel. Oder man verpasst eine Blitzaufgabe und kassiert Minuspunkte.<br/><br/>Interaktivit&auml;t wird bei &bdquo;Um Himmels Willen&ldquo; gro&szlig; geschrieben.

In this game, you and your friends can participate in two separate games. The campaign game pits the limitless troops and resources of the Galactic Empire against a crack team of elite Rebel operatives as they strive to break the Empire&rsquo;s hold on the galaxy, while the skirmish game invites you and a friend to muster strike teams and battle head-to-head over conflicting objectives.<br/><br/>In the campaign game, Imperial Assault invites you to play through a cinematic tale set in the Star Wars universe. One player commands the seemingly limitless armies of the Galactic Empire, threatening to extinguish the flame of the Rebellion forever. Up to four other players become heroes of the Rebel Alliance, engaging in covert operations to undermine the Empire&rsquo;s schemes. Over the course of the campaign, both the Imperial player and the Rebel heroes gain new experience and skills, allowing characters to evolve as the story unfolds.<br/><br/>Imperial Assault offers a different game experience in the skirmish game. In skirmish missions, you and a friend compete in head-to-head, tactical combat. You&rsquo;ll gather your own strike force of Imperials, Rebels, and Mercenaries and build a deck of command cards to gain an unexpected advantage in the heat of battle. Whether you recover lost holocrons or battle to defeat a raiding party, you&rsquo;ll find danger and tactical choices in every skirmish.<br/><br/>As an additional benefit, the Luke Skywalker Ally Pack and the Darth Vader Villain Pack are included within the Imperial Assault Core Set. These figure packs offer sculpted plastic figures alongside additional campaign and skirmish missions that highlight both Luke Skywalker and Darth Vader within Imperial Assault. With these Imperial Assault Figure Packs, you'll find even more missions that allow your heroes to fight alongside these iconic characters from the Star Wars saga.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": ["Brazilian First Edition", "English first edition", "French first edition", "German First edition", "Italian first edition", "Polish First Edition", "Spanish first edition"], "average": "8.20155", "name": "Star Wars: Imperial Assault", "playingtime": "120", "boardgamemechanic": ["Dice Rolling", "Grid Movement", "Modular Board", "Partnerships", "Role Playing", "Variable Player Powers"], "age": "14", "boardgameexpansion": ["194901", "226836", "205902", "180621", "180622", "175213", "194900", "218254", "205903", "167886", "181688", "181690", "226837", "181629", "167883", "199911", "167889", "226839", "218255", "177087", "167885", "194902", "205904", "205900", "218253", "175214", "194903", "181689", "205905", "226838", "199909", "175212", "167888", "167887", "181621", "167884", "177088", "194897", "199910", "175211", "177086"], "usersrated": "11245", "boardgameaccessory": ["Star Wars: Imperial Assault \u2013 Anchorhead Cantina Skirmish Map", "Star Wars: Imperial Assault \u2013 Coruscant Landfill Skirmish Map", "Star Wars: Imperial Assault \u2013 Dice Pack", "Star Wars: Imperial Assault \u2013 ISB Headquarters Skirmish Map", "Star Wars: Imperial Assault \u2013 Jabba's Palace Skirmish Map", "Star Wars: Imperial Assault \u2013 Nelvaanian War Zone Skirmish Map", "Star Wars: Imperial Assault \u2013 Training Ground Skirmish Map"], "boardgamesubdomain": ["Thematic Games"], "boardgamefamily": ["Campaign Games", "Fantasy Flight Big Box", "Star Wars", "Star Wars: Imperial Assault"], "boardgamepodcastepisode": ["#80 \u2013 Tabletop \u2013 Fantasy Flight Star Wars Games", "1P 103 - Burgle Bros.", "7LandHand: Episode 51 \u2013 Imperial Assault", "BGA Episode 100 - Top 100 Games of All Time", "Boardcast News 4.3.2015 | Podcast of Nonsensical Gamers", "Cult of the New Board Game Podcast Episode 018 \u2013 Star Wars: Rebellion vs Star Wars: Imperial Assault", "Dukes of Dice - Ep. 28 - Between Two Droids", "Ep 022 \u2013 Ringing in 2016 with Board Gaming!", "Ep 33 STAR WARS with Alex Eding", "Episode 1 - Blood Rage vs Champions of Midgard", "Episode 1 - Our Introduction Into Gaming", "Episode 10 - 7 Wonders vs Among the Stars", "Episode 10 - Space: The Final Frontier", "Episode 11 - Notre Dame vs Ulm", "Episode 11: The one about our 10x10 Challenge", "Episode 12 - Tammany Hall vs Rialto", "Episode 18: Codenames Review - Games of the Year - Giveaways", "Episode 2 - Quarriors vs Dice Masters", "Episode 2 - Star Wars Special And Imperial Assault Review", "Episode 3 - Scare Tactics", "Episode 3 - Witch of Salem vs Elder Sign - Gates of Arkham", "Episode 35 - Interview with Greater Than Games Christopher Badell", "Episode 4 - Fury of Dracula vs Letters from Whitechapel", "Episode 49 - Star Wars: Rebellion Two Year Anniversary", "Episode 4: Star Wars: Imperial Assault, Neuroshima Hex Contest, Castles of Mad King Ludwig and Medieval Night", "Episode 5 - Sentinels of the Multiverse vs Legendary: A Marvel Deck Building Game", "Episode 56: Assaulting Settlers?", "Episode 5: Kemble\u2019s Cascade, But Wait, There\u2019s More!

Since there are so many ways to get points, like using words which have lots of vowels, or completing heaps of objectives, by the end of the game, the winner could really be anyone.<br/><br/>Cards are one of the most important part of the game, as they are used to interact with other play ers, like stealing their letters, or stopping another player make a word, but also are used for perks, like increasing the value of vowels or allowing you to make two words in a turn.<br/><br/>Pick a Vowel has many different levels of complexity, offering a light,gentle game for children, or an intense, challenging game for adults. The use of objective cards, and letter penalties increases the difficulty dramatically. The length of the game can be adjusted by simply deciding the word limit at the beginning.<br/><br/>&quot;Very cool word game with lots of interaction, interesting twists, and very little waiting time.

In botNET it is represented by White or Black glass tokens that indicate if the Cred is &lsquo;Whitehat&rsquo; or &lsquo;Blackhat&rsquo;. Connecting nodes to Botnets earn Cred from one of the two hacker groups. One earned, Cred can be used to the Hackers advantage by acquiring contacts and issuing exploits. <br/> Contacts are shadowy individuals that will assist you but may switch allegiances at the drop of a hat. Contacts have secret knowledge that can make hacks easier and will pay you if you can gain control over the Nodes they desire. Unscrupulous rivals may turn informant and report Contacts to the police. Who will keep their mouth shut and who will rat?<br/><br/>"}, "164196": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2208617.jpg", "poll": [], "boardgamedesigner": ["Bryn K.

After the king's death, the powerful dukes and counts of the land are fighting for supremacy. You are one of these nobles, looking to write your name in the annals of history. You will use your citizens to develop your lands, muster armies, and amass wealth. You may even try to secure the goodwill of influential public figures, like the remainders of the royal family. But never forget to keep the dishonest parts of your society in check: Excessive corruption may lead to your downfall sooner than you think. The goal is clear!<br/><br/>But the path you take to get there is yours to decide: Will you be a peaceful protector of the royal family? Or maybe a warlord, taking what you want by force?

Each round offers tough choices on how to expand your pool of citizens and buildings. Using the resources you acquire, you may raise powerful armies or secure the support of powerful characters. In the game, you will use several kinds of citizens (cubes and prisms) in different ways, with the ultimate goal of earning prestige points. Your pool of citizens is represented by your pouch: You draw available citizens from there and return used citizens to the pouch only when you cannot draw any more because it is empty. (This concept is similar to the deck-building concept seen in other games.)<br/><br/>The game takes place over nine rounds. At the end of rounds 3, 6 and 9, a great council allows for the scoring of additional prestige points from influential characters and conquered territories. After the ninth round, the game ends with the third great council and a final scoring in which you can gain or lose points depending on your corrupt officials and buildings, then the player with the most prestige points wins.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": ["Multilingual first edition"], "name": "King's Pouch", "playingtime": "60", "boardgamemechanic": ["Area Control / Area Influence", "Deck / Pool Building", "Worker Placement"], "age": "10", "boardgameexpansion": ["167839"], "usersrated": "158", "average": "6.79304", "boardgamepodcastepisode": ["The Game Pit: Episode 32 - Essen 2014 Treasure Hunt Special (part 2)"]}, "164207": {"rpgartist": ["Gy\u00f6rgy Csik\u00f3s", "Kl\u00e1ra Lexa", "L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Lipt\u00e1k", "S\u00e1ndor Szigeti", "Zsolt Udvarhelyi"], "statistics": [], "name": "B\u00edborhold (Season 2, Issue 4 - Apr 1993)", "rpgdesigner": ["M\u00e1ty\u00e1s Mass\u00e1r", "Gergely N\u00e1dori", "Zsolt Szigeti", "Mikl\u00f3s Tihor", "P\u00e9ter Vask\u00f3"], "rpgproducer": ["M\u00e1ty\u00e1s Mass\u00e1r", "Gergely N\u00e1dori", "Gergely Papp", "G\u00e1bor Szegedi", "Zsolt Szigeti", "Mikl\u00f3s Tihor"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2236972.jpg", "usersrated": "1", "average": "6", "rpgissue": ["B\u00edborhold"], "rpgissuearticle": ["A B\u00f6lcs tan\u00e1csai", "Druid\u00e1k, b\u00e1rdok \u00e9s filik", "Editorial", "\u00c9gi Lapok", "Gal\u00e9ria - Aliens", "Gal\u00e9ria - Dragonlance", "Az illuzionista", "Kuan Jin birtoka", "Levelez\u00e9s", "Mes\u00e9k a Gyapjas S\u00fcnb\u0151l", "Mitol\u00f3giai ABC - Rakshasa", "Pszionika az AD&D-ben", "Rejtv\u00e9ny", "Rune Quest", "Set\u00e9t Patk\u00e1ny napl\u00f3ja", "Sz\u00e1m\u00edt\u00f3g\u00e9pes rovat - Darklands", "Sz\u00f6rny-Lexikon - Homoki khran", "Sz\u00f6rny-lexikon - Ylthrahk"], "rpgpublisher": ["Odin Bt."], "rpgissueversion": ["First edition"], "poll": [], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2236972_t.jpg", "description": "Editorial - mass&aacute;r - 1<br/>Mes&eacute;k a Gyapjas S&uuml;nb\u0151l - gergely n&aacute;dori - 2<br/>A B&ouml;lcs tan&aacute;csai - sylva theomer - 6<br/>Druid&aacute;k, b&aacute;rdok &eacute;s filik - P&eacute;ter Vask&oacute;

The game of faro is played with only one deck of cards and allows for any number of players.<br/><br/>A game of faro was often called a faro bank. It was played with an entire deck of playing cards. One person was designated the &quot;banker&quot; and an indeterminate number of players, known as &quot;punters&quot;, could be admitted. Chips (called &quot;checks&quot;) were purchased by the punter from the banker (or house) from which the game originated. Bet values and limits were set by the house. Usual check values were 50 cents to $10 each.<br/><br/>The faro table was typically oval, covered with green baize, and had a cutout for the banker. A board with a standardized betting layout consisting of all cards of one suit pasted to it in numerical order, called the &quot;layout&quot;, was placed on top of the table. Traditionally, the suit of spades was used for the layout. Each player laid his stake on one of the 13 cards on the layout. Players could place multiple bets and could bet on multiple cards simultaneously by placing their bet between cards or on specific card edges. Players also had the choice of betting on the &ldquo;high card&rdquo; bar located at the top of the layout.<br/><br/>Faro was popular in eighteenth century Europe and nineteenth century America, particularly on the frontier.

Players can attack either with their LRIG or summoned beings called SIGNI that come from the Main deck. <br/>Over the course of the game, players can &quot;Grow&quot; their LRIG with cards from the LRIG deck, getting access to more powerful SIGNI and various LRIG abilities. Both decks also have cards with one-shot effects: Arts (in the LRIG deck) and Spells (in the Main deck). These cards, as well as Growing a LRIG, require spending a certain amounts of Ener, which is represented by cards in your Ener Zone. You can put cards from both your hand and your side of the field into your Ener Zone once a turn. It is also the zone where defeated SIGNI and crashed Life Cloth cards go to. Some cards also produce additional effects called Life Bursts if they are crashed from the Life Cloth.<br/><br/>"}, "164289": {"rpgartist": ["John Bolton", "Richard Corben", "Jeff Dee", "Larry Elmore", "Erol Otus", "Darcy Perry", "Sidney Sime", "David A.

By default you can Mad-Lib your way through target generation, but if you'd like a few suggestions to get you going (all contributed by fellow backers), grab this bonus deck!<br/><br/>'Machine of Death: The Game of Creative Assassination' is a storytelling game set in a world in which a machine can predict how a person will die with 100% accuracy with only a small blood sample. However, the machine delights in being vague and twisted. A card reading &quot;Old Age&quot; could mean you die in your sleep at age 120, or it could mean you're run over tomorrow by an elderly driver who forgot to take his pills today. Players of the game take the role of assassins, who must use the various tools at their disposal -- from storytelling to a slew of items available from specialty Black Market shops -- to create a situation in which a target is killed in a way in line with their Death Prediction. The Machine of Death Game uses this basic idea, of assassins working in a world were cause of death is known to create various game modes.<br/><br/>The General Gameplay of most modes works like this:<br/><br/>&bull; A target is assigned, and given certain details (including Death Prediction, and possibly extra details like a favourite food or crippling phobia).<br/>&bull; Players &ndash; assassins &ndash; are given Black Market Gift Cards. This is their inventory, what they have to use in order to accomplish their goal: killing the target.<br/>&bull; Players use the Gift Cards to devise a plan.<br/>&bull; The plan is greenlit, either by a Chief player, or via consensus, depending on game mode.<br/>&bull; The timer starts and the plan is put into action. This is represented by dice rolling to beat a &quot;difficulty score.&quot; An unlikely plan hinging on a single item may need to roll a 6 for that item, but a rock-solid intricate plan may need to only roll a 2 for all Black Market Gift Cards used.<br/>&bull; The plan is revised, in case of failure of one or more dice rolls. The details of this portion vary greatly from mode to mode, but involve either replacing Black Market Items, creating a new viable plan with the existing items, or calling in &quot;Specialists&quot;<br/>&bull; The target is either killed or escapes. Again, depending on mode, this is either the end of the round or the game.<br/><br/>Game Modes:<br/><br/><br/>    Head-to-Head Mode that's very similar to Cards Against Humanity or Apples to Apples. There's a judge (&quot;the Chief&quot;), who decides whose assassination plan is the best, and gives them a chance to try it out.

However, the machine delights in being vague and twisted. A card reading &quot;Old Age&quot; could mean you die in your sleep at age 120, or it could mean you're run over tomorrow by an elderly driver who forgot to take his pills today. Players of the game take the role of assassins, who must use the various tools at their disposal -- from storytelling to a slew of items available from specialty Black Market shops -- to create a situation in which a target is killed in a way in line with their Death Prediction. The Machine of Death Game uses this basic idea, of assassins working in a world were cause of death is known to create various game modes.<br/><br/>The General Gameplay of most modes works like this:<br/><br/>&bull; A target is assigned, and given certain details (including Death Prediction, and possibly extra details like a favourite food or crippling phobia).<br/>&bull; Players &ndash; assassins &ndash; are given Black Market Gift Cards. This is their inventory, what they have to use in order to accomplish their goal: killing the target.<br/>&bull; Players use the Gift Cards to devise a plan.<br/>&bull; The plan is greenlit, either by a Chief player, or via consensus, depending on game mode.<br/>&bull; The timer starts and the plan is put into action. This is represented by dice rolling to beat a &quot;difficulty score.&quot; An unlikely plan hinging on a single item may need to roll a 6 for that item, but a rock-solid intricate plan may need to only roll a 2 for all Black Market Gift Cards used.<br/>&bull; The plan is revised, in case of failure of one or more dice rolls. The details of this portion vary greatly from mode to mode, but involve either replacing Black Market Items, creating a new viable plan with the existing items, or calling in &quot;Specialists&quot;<br/>&bull; The target is either killed or escapes. Again, depending on mode, this is either the end of the round or the game.<br/><br/>Game Modes:<br/><br/><br/>    Head-to-Head Mode that's very similar to Cards Against Humanity or Apples to Apples. There's a judge (&quot;the Chief&quot;), who decides whose assassination plan is the best, and gives them a chance to try it out. Designed for 4+ playes.<br/>    Co-op Mode, where you players are a team of assassins, and have to come up with a plan together to kill targets that the group comes up with.<br/>    Co-op can be diced further: you can play individual rounds, or Mission Mode, where targets are predetermined and have different levels of difficulty. There's also the more strategic Chief Mode, where there's no timer, but the Chief can rate your plan's likelihood of success and let you take risks on whether it'll work or not.<br/>    Cutthroat Mode, where players can actually assassinate each other (should you want a more competitive version)<br/>    The Day Off Mode, which isn't about murder at all but rather draws upon your bevy of assassin skills to accomplish tasks like &quot;opening a stuck jam jar&quot; and &quot;transplanting a tulip bulb.&quot;<br/><br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": ["First edition"], "name": "Machine of Death: The Game of Creative Assassination \u2013 Webcomics Pals/Chums", "playingtime": "0", "boardgamemechanic": ["Dice Rolling", "Storytelling"], "average": "6.15789", "boardgameexpansion": [], "usersrated": "19", "boardgamefamily": ["Crowdfunding: Kickstarter"]}, "164338": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2551380.jpg", "poll": [], "boardgamedesigner": ["Luigi Ferrini"], "statistics": [], "yearpublished": "2014", "maxplayers": "4", "boardgameartist": ["Alexandre Roche"], "boardgamepublisher": ["Quined Games", "Ediciones MasQueOca", "Ergo Ludo Editions", "Ghenos Games", "Schwerkraft-Verlag", "Stronghold Games"], "maxplaytime": "90", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2551380_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "90", "boardgamecategory": ["Civilization", "Territory Building"], "boardgamehonor": ["2014 Meeples' Choice Nominee", "2015 Goblin Magnifico Nominee", "2015 Nederlandse Spellenprijs Best Expert Game Nominee"], "description": "In The Golden Ages, you lead your civilizations through history.

However, the machine delights in being vague and twisted. A card reading &quot;Old Age&quot; could mean you die in your sleep at age 120, or it could mean you're run over tomorrow by an elderly driver who forgot to take his pills today. Players of the game take the role of assassins, who must use the various tools at their disposal -- from storytelling to a slew of items available from specialty Black Market shops -- to create a situation in which a target is killed in a way in line with their Death Prediction. The Machine of Death Game uses this basic idea, of assassins working in a world were cause of death is known to create various game modes.<br/><br/>The General Gameplay of most modes works like this:<br/><br/>&bull; A target is assigned, and given certain details (including Death Prediction, and possibly extra details like a favourite food or crippling phobia).<br/>&bull; Players &ndash; assassins &ndash; are given Black Market Gift Cards. This is their inventory, what they have to use in order to accomplish their goal: killing the target.<br/>&bull; Players use the Gift Cards to devise a plan.<br/>&bull; The plan is greenlit, either by a Chief player, or via consensus, depending on game mode.<br/>&bull; The timer starts and the plan is put into action. This is represented by dice rolling to beat a &quot;difficulty score.&quot; An unlikely plan hinging on a single item may need to roll a 6 for that item, but a rock-solid intricate plan may need to only roll a 2 for all Black Market Gift Cards used.<br/>&bull; The plan is revised, in case of failure of one or more dice rolls. The details of this portion vary greatly from mode to mode, but involve either replacing Black Market Items, creating a new viable plan with the existing items, or calling in &quot;Specialists&quot;<br/>&bull; The target is either killed or escapes. Again, depending on mode, this is either the end of the round or the game.<br/><br/>Game Modes:<br/><br/><br/>    Head-to-Head Mode that's very similar to Cards Against Humanity or Apples to Apples. There's a judge (&quot;the Chief&quot;), who decides whose assassination plan is the best, and gives them a chance to try it out. Designed for 4+ playes.<br/>    Co-op Mode, where you players are a team of assassins, and have to come up with a plan together to kill targets that the group comes up with.<br/>    Co-op can be diced further: you can play individual rounds, or Mission Mode, where targets are predetermined and have different levels of difficulty. There's also the more strategic Chief Mode, where there's no timer, but the Chief can rate your plan's likelihood of success and let you take risks on whether it'll work or not.<br/>    Cutthroat Mode, where players can actually assassinate each other (should you want a more competitive version)<br/>    The Day Off Mode, which isn't about murder at all but rather draws upon your bevy of assassin skills to accomplish tasks like &quot;opening a stuck jam jar&quot; and &quot;transplanting a tulip bulb.&quot;<br/><br/><br/>"}, "164367": {"poll": [], "name": "Europe 1300", "videogamemode": ["Massively Multiplayer"], "videogameversion": ["Europe 1300"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2225943.png", "videogametheme": ["Medieval"], "usersrated": "0", "videogamedeveloper": ["(Self-Published)", "Silver Lemur Games"], "videogamegenre": ["MMO", "RPG", "Simulation", "Strategy"], "videogameplatform": ["Web Browser"], "average": "0", "statistics": [], "videogamepublisher": ["(Web published)", "Silver Lemur Games"], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2225943_t.png", "description": "Historical Realistic Medieval sim (around year 1200-1400).<br/><br/>Become a citizen of a medieval kingdom (craftsman, merchant, clergyman, knight, baron, count, king, etc).<br/>(commoners) Work in your workshop, trade, compete for guild master position, defend your town in battles, obtain local offices.<br/>(nobles) Make claims to provinces, construct mansions, manage your fiefdoms, fight glorious battles, challenge to duels, participate in tournaments &amp; crusades, obtain royal offices.<br/><br/>from the official website:<br/>europe1300.eu<br/><br/>"}, "164368": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2263140.png", "poll": [], "boardgamedesigner": ["Matt Hyra"], "statistics": [], "yearpublished": "2014", "maxplayers": "5", "age": "15", "boardgamepublisher": ["Cryptozoic Entertainment"], "maxplaytime": "30", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2263140_t.png", "minplaytime": "30", "boardgamecategory": ["Card Game", "Expansion for Base-game", "Fantasy"], "description": "Set of 2 extra cards for Cryptozoic's The Lord of the Ring: The Return of the King Deck-Building Game:<br/><br/>- Faramir: another playable hero.

Each player starts with three cards in hand, and one crest card of each type is laid in a row, with one card placed face up next to each crest.<br/><br/>Each round, players take turn laying one card face up in front of them, then they resolve the cards from high to low. Whoever played the highest card places it on the opposite side of the leftmost crest card, then takes 1-4 cards from those on display next to the crests as determined by the power of the card played. Then the player with the next highest card goes, etc. Any cards unclaimed are placed to the right of played cards, then the row is filled with cards from the deck until seven cards are on display once again.<br/><br/>With each card claimed, the player can either add it to his hand (up to a maximum of three cards in hand) or place it in his scoring pile.

The object of the game is simple: defeat the other players (human or computer) and conquer the world!<br/><br/>You begin the game with 56 Armies (actually divisions) placed in a randomly selected country.  Your strategy will likely be heavily influenced by this initial positioning.  You can only attack countries that border a country that you already own.  Also, attacking one continent from another can only be done from certain countries.  For example, an attack launched at Asia from Europe can only be accomplished through the Ukraine - an attack launched at Africa can only be accomplished through Spain.<br/><br/>Also at the beginning of the game, each player is assigned an IDEOLOGY, or set of beliefs, for which he will fight for the duration of the game.  A randomly selected number of countries around the world are also assigned that player's ideology.  These ideologically &quot;friendly&quot; countries are easier to conquer than those who are friendly to another player.  They also require only ONE army of occupation.<br/><br/>The winner of individual attacks is determined randomly by electronically throwing dice (though you don't see this).  If you get the highest result, you win.  If these &quot;dice&quot; come up doubles and the country you are attacking shares your ideology, then you win the battle.  If, however, that country shares someone else's ideology you lose the tie.<br/><br/><br/>User Summary<br/><br/>The game was released as shareware with the full game available via mail order.

From spells that force lethal orgasms to spells that transform the caster into a horrific spider demon, these unique new spells blend traditional Japanese myth with hentai horror.<br/><br/>New class archetypes and character options for spellcasters offer new possibilities inspired by Japanese gaming tropes, from the White Mage Cleric archetype to the suicide-based revision of the Summoner.<br/><br/>Finally the real meat of Enchantments of Black Tokyo are the exhaustive collection of magic items. Some of these items previously appeared in various Black Tokyo sourcebooks, and are collected here to build the ultimate toy box for your campaign. Others are all new, never before seen, ranging from enchanted school uniforms to mystically empowered laptops and game consoles or a diverse array of weapons and sorcerous armors. Black Tokyo is a very high magic modern fantasy/horror campaign, where magic is common place, found on every darkened corner.

Send your minions around the globe to execute nefarious plots such as marketing evil soda, hijacking a nuclear submarine, building a time portal, or ruining a beloved movie property. Each turn you&rsquo;ll send your minions to exotic locales such as London, Cairo, Machu Picchu, or Antarctica to gather the resources you need to carry out your plans: Finance, Occult, Science, and of course Unobtainium. Watch out for your opponents&mdash;they&rsquo;re trying to pull off their own schemes. Each sinister plot you execute is but one small part of your secret Ultimate Scheme!<br/><br/>A game turn consists of five steps: draw new schemes, move minions (perform twice), collect resources (perform twice), execute schemes, and the end step. Players perform each step in play order, so if Player 1 collects the resources in Cairo, Player 2 can't get Cairo's resources that turn. During the course of the turn, players move their minions to sites and collect the resources each site provides. Then they pay resources to execute schemes held in their hand, and earn progress points toward victory by doing so. To execute a scheme, a player must meet the scheme resource cost, and have a minion located in the scheme's site (for example, to subvert the U.N., a player must have a minion in New York). Action cards give players special advantages in moving minions, collecting resources, gaining new minions, or destroying enemy minions. The &quot;first player&quot; rotates each turn.<br/><br/>Each player begins the game with a secret &quot;Ultimate Scheme&quot; card such as Ruin Christmas or Destroy Rock 'n' Roll. The Ultimate Scheme card dictates how many progress points the player needs to win, and what *kind* of schemes he or she needs to pull off. The game ends at the end of the turn in which the first player to complete his or her Ultimate Scheme does so. If multiple players finish their Ultimate Scheme on the same turn, various tiebreakers determine victory -- but the easiest way to win is to be the first villain to pull off your grand plan.<br/><br/>"}, "164429": {"poll": [], "name": "Find them all", "videogamemode": ["Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["Web browser edition"], "average": "0", "videogametheme": ["Words"], "usersrated": "0", "videogamedeveloper": ["(Self-Developed Video Game)"], "videogamegenre": ["Action"], "videogameplatform": ["Web Browser"], "statistics": [], "videogamepublisher": ["(Web published)"], "description": "User Summary<br/><br/>A series of images are shown.

While many spells from the Pathfinder Roleplaying Game Core Rulebook received a facelift and an upgrade in Mythic Adventures, the sourcebook that introduced mythic power to the game of Pathfinder, dozens of spells were left behind. Missing Mythic Magic Volume IX, and its predecessors, aim to give each and every spell from the core rules a full-fledged mythic upgrade, all the way from A to Z, with a special focus on making mythic spells that feel as over-the-top and larger-than-life as possible.<br/><br/>This installment includes 17 mythic spells, from fear to freezing sphere. A mythic forcecage can create cages of much greater size, but with the expenditure of additional mythic power, they can also be made to last for hours at a time, or to slowly enclose on those within, crushing them in a grisly demise. A mythic freedom protects the target from a variety of other things that could inhibit movement, including being dazed, entangled, paralyzed, petrified, and more. A mythic flaming sphere can last indefinitely, as long as you continue to concentrate on it, and a mythic flame arrow can supply flaming arrows to an entire army.

In extensive testing the average team runs and hits were within 3% of actual game stats. TTL Baseball comes with 6 teams from the 2011 season. Each team has 23 players printed on 3 separate 8 1/2&quot; x 11&quot; card stock ivory paper. The player sheets come in 3 hole punched sheet protectors that make the game easily transportable in a standard binder. (binder is not included)<br/><br/>The game has 4 different player modes; intro, basic, advanced, and 'Ultra Simulation Mode' which consists of using the advanced version along with all optional rules. After familiarity with the rule set, average game times range from 20 minutes for intro games to 40 minutes for advanced games. USM games would take a bit longer.<br/><br/>The game is for 1 to 2 players and is highly suitable for solitaire play. TTL Baseball has over 1800 hours in development. The advanced game was designed first, then to shorten average game times a simpler pitching system was designed for the basic game. Finally, the intro game is a simplified version to allow players to start playing games without knowing all the advanced rules.<br/><br/>Think you could have managed a team to a better season record than the actual manager did? Now you have the opportunity. Play a single series or an entire season with season player stat sheets available separately. In addition, extra player sheets are available for most seasons that add an additional 4 players to every team. This would bring each teams roster to 27 players.<br/><br/>This game features base stealing, squeeze plays, maximum pitch counts, pitch guessing, defensive depth adjustments for infield and outfield. The advanced games pitching system is perhaps the most accurate available. Optional rules limit use on how often each pitcher may be used within any 5 game period. Bullpen managements are included to keep track of pitcher use. There are also ballpark ratings that make parks either allow more or less home runs just as in reality. A rare play table accounts for almost every possible play possible in baseball. ie. triple plays, double steals, power outages, rain delays leading to arm stiffness for starting pitchers, outfielders colliding....etc.<br/><br/>TTLB uses a unique pitching check mechanic that uses a separate roll on 50% of key batting outcomes. This 'Pitcher Check Roll' (PCR) ensures that both hitter and pitcher attributes are taken into account. This makes both pitchers ERA's and hitters BA's as accurate as possible.<br/><br/>"}, "164464": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2754459.jpg", "poll": [], "boardgamedesigner": ["Christopher Guild"], "statistics": [], "yearpublished": "2014", "maxplayers": "99", "boardgameartist": ["Christina Gugliada", "Chris Raimo"], "boardgamepublisher": ["WizKids"], "maxplaytime": "60", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2754459_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "60", "boardgamecategory": ["Aviation / Flight", "Dice", "Expansion for Base-game", "Movies / TV / Radio theme", "Science Fiction", "Wargame"], "description": "The Officer Cards are a participation prize given to players who participated in Month 3, &quot;Battle of Sector 001,&quot; of the Star Trek: Attack Wing Storyline Organized Play Event, The Collective.

This doujinshi (self-published work) is a simulation of the 1156 battle in Heiankyo (modern day Kyoto), Japan, between feuding factions of the Fujiwara family of kuge (nobles) fighting over who would hold the position of Tenno (Emperor).<br/><br/>Without getting too deeply into the complex web of politics surrounding the battle, the sitting Tenno Go-Shirakawa was involved in an ongoing succession battle with his half-brother Sutoku (the retired Tenno). Sutoku had been forced out by his father Toba years earlier in favor of another son (Konoe), and when Konoe died, Sutoku saw this as his chance to install his own son as Tenno. However, Toba insisted on installing another of his sons, Go-Shirakawa. When Toba eventually died, Sutoku took advantage of his death to plot with supporters to force Go-Shirakawa from the throne. As if this doesn't sound messy enough already, Go-Shirakawa and Sutoku both had supporters among the three major families of the day-the Fujiwara, Taira, and Minamoto. Supporting Go-Shirakawa was Fujiwara no Tadamichi, Taira no Kiyomori, and Minamoto no Yoshitomo. Supporting Sutoku was Fujiwara no Yorinaga, Taira no Tadamasa, and Minamoto no Tameyoshi.<br/><br/>Historically the fighting took place mainly on July 28-29. Minamoto no Tametomo (a Sutoku supporter) suggested a night attack, but was unwisely overruled by Fujiwara no Yorinaga. Instead, the next evening, Minamoto no Yoshitomo and Taira no Kiyomori led a night attack of their own on Sutoku's palace. Despite being frustrated in their initial attacks on the west gate by the incredible archery prowess of Minamoto no Tametomo, Yoshitomo and Kiyomori simply broke off the attack, moved to other gates, and torched the palace, circumventing that whole messy combat thing. Sutoku was exiled and most of his allies were killed in battle or executed. On the winning side, rewards were handed out, but what was seen as an uneven distribution by the Minamoto resulted in another conflict (the Heiji no Ran) three years later.<br/><br/>Hogen No Ran shares its game system with its follow-up, Heiji No Ran. The game runs for 11 turns, taking the action from the tenth day of the seventh month in the first year of Hogen to the 13th day (July 28-31, 1156, two turns per day with a night turn). Forces of the various factions are individual leaders with associated clansmen, rated for both troop strength and leader ability. Chrome rules put an emphasis on the favored tactics of the day, mainly the use of fire to flush out the enemy. There are also special rules for night attacks, allowing players to see if Minamoto no Tametomo's strategy would have brought victory to Sutoku. Victory is determined by unit losses and possession of the Emperor/retired Emperor. Counter numbers are low, the game system is clean and well thought out, and it does an excellent job of simulating the battle as it was recorded in the Hogen Monogatari (a gunkimono-'war tale'-written around the year 1200).<br/><br/>"}, "164471": {"boardgamedesigner": ["Kai Haferkamp"], "average": "0", "poll": [], "name": "Die Fit-Esser", "playingtime": "0", "minplayers": "2", "yearpublished": "2009", "usersrated": "0", "boardgamefamily": ["Superheroes"], "maxplayers": "3", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2316160_t.jpg", "boardgameartist": ["Studio Mattigatti"], "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["Ravensburger Spieleverlag GmbH"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2316160.jpg", "boardgameversion": ["German edition"], "maxplaytime": "0", "boardgamecategory": ["Educational"], "age": "5", "minplaytime": "0", "description": "The players try to make their superhero fit for the next race.

Ie not wanted to achieve a very large number of possibilities via increasing dimensions of the board, but actually achieve infinite number of possibilities with finite dimensions. I am aware that the property of &quot;infinite possibilities&quot; does not necessarily imply a high degree of complexity. Analyzing the subject I found that a way to achieve endless possibilities in a space of finite dimensions is eliminating the mechanics of boxes and introducing another type of metrics.<br/>I was essentially inspired by the game of chinese origin here known as &quot;GO&quot; which is characterized by extremely simple rules and at the same time maintaining a high degree of complexity. The dynamics of this game is quite similar to the GO, share many aspects, and in fact the purpose is similar, and yet at the same time, they also differ substantially in many aspects. This will be understood by analyzing the rules of the game.<br/>The rules were analyzed consistently with certain typical aspects of war.<br/>Another parameter of design was to attempt to emulate, if not increase, the intrinsic characteristic of the GO of being a chaotic and stochastic game.<br/><br/>The name of the game derives from the Latin expression for the word &quot;dominion / control&quot;.<br/><br/>Equipment<br/><br/>Pieces<br/>The pieces are circular, with a thickness that allows its easy handling. These pieces are characterized in that each has a range (a circular area whose diameter is three times the diameter of the piece). Each piece has one side painted white and the other black (like in Othello), and each player may chose one side (color) to play. Both sides have in the center a gray circle (its just decorative), whose diameter is equal to a quarter of the pieces' diameter. <br/>To tell if a piece is within the range of another, just take a piece and place it over the two pieces. If the piece used to measure is supported by the two pieces, one can ensure that a piece is within the range of the other (and vice versa).<br/>    As in the GO, it is assumed that virtually there is an infinite supply of pieces.<br/><br/>Board<br/>    The board has two concentric squares: the peripheral (whose side is equal to 20x the diameter of the pieces) and the central (whose side is equal to 14x the diameter of the pieces). The peripheral defines the playing area, and the central only serves as a visual reference to place the pieces.<br/><br/>Rules<br/><br/><br/>    Start: At the start of the game the board is empty. Black plays first. Then both players play alternately. In his turn, a player must make appear a piece in an empty space on the board.<br/><br/><br/><br/>    Disappearance: A piece disappears when it is within the range of four or more opponents pieces.<br/><br/><br/><br/>    End: When a player makes a &quot;suicide&quot; move, the game ends and that player loses. If the game comes to a point where that may never happen, then it's a tie.<br/><br/><br/>Notes about the terms used:<br/><br/>Note 1: it is said that a player makes a &quot;suicide&quot; move when he makes appear a piece in a place where it is within the range of four or more opponents pieces, and since this move does not make opponent pieces disappear (then, only that piece disappears, by the rule of disappearance).<br/>Note 2: it is said that a player makes a &quot;sacrifice&quot; move when he makes appear a piece in a place where it is within the range of four or more opponents pieces, and since this move makes one or more opponent pieces disappear (then, that piece and the respective opponent pieces disappears, by the rule of disappearance).<br/><br/>"}, "164493": {"poll": [], "name": "Cook, Serve, Delicious!", "videogamemode": ["Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["Android edition", "iPad edition", "iPhone edition", "Linux Downloadable edition", "Mac Downloadable edition", "Windows Downloadable edition"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2215744.jpg", "videogametheme": ["Business/Construction", "Food / Cooking"], "usersrated": "23", "videogamedeveloper": ["Vertigo Gaming"], "videogamegenre": ["Simulation"], "videogameplatform": ["Android", "iPad", "iPhone", "Linux", "Macintosh", "Windows"], "average": "6.9", "statistics": [], "videogamepublisher": ["Vertigo Gaming"], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2215744_t.jpg", "description": "Cook, Serve, Delicious is a hardcore restaurant sim, one of the few in its genre that gives the players total control over where they want to take their restaurant.<br/><br/>The game centers on an old, worn down restaurant in the SherriSoda Tower, which was once the heart of the building but closed down as business (and tenants) dropped to an all time low.
