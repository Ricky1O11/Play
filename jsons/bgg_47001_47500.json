The names of arcanas are same as Arcaeus' ones and named with Latin, for example: Mater (clergy), Adamas (knight), Dextra (alchemist) and Ignis (archer). Players choose three arcanas during character creation. Three arcanas represent character's past, present and future. For instance, he might have lost the throne in the past if his past arcana is Corona (represent royal). In contrast, He may have the destiny that he will ascend to the throne if his future arcana is Corona.<br/><br/>The person who has more than three stigmatas is called Marauder and slayed by Engraveds because he has the sin of arrogance and unbelief. But every player character also will become Marauder if his Dignity Point (DP) is lost. At the game's climax, Marauders always shout that &quot;Dedicate Stigmata! We shall hold Lammas tonight.&quot; as a traditional statement.<br/><br/>The game system uses only 20 sided dice and special tarot cards.&quot;&quot;<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;Blade_of_Arcana,&quot; available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "47155": {"rpgdesigner": ["Jeff Mackintosh", "John R.

Everyone's always involved in the game, even when it's not their turn to move their playing piece!  The game is completely different every time you play!<br/><br/>Warning:  If a board game needs to be all about strategy, setup, and &quot;the win&quot; in order for you to enjoy it, then you may want to avoid The Tower of Mystery because it's a rapidly changing game that's frequently outside of your complete control.<br/><br/>But if you enjoy a purely social game that's all about player interaction, fun, laughter, and &quot;the journey&quot;, then chances are great that you'll love the Tower of Mystery!  Social gamers of all ages (adults, college students, teens) and Families enjoy the game!<br/><br/>The Tower of Mystery contains no occult elements, magic, spells, or evil characters.<br/><br/><br/>Detailed Game Description<br/> The Tower of Mystery combines luck, unpredictability, and a dash of strategy make this an exciting, lively game for everyone. Because up to eight players can play, nobody is left out! It's competitive, interactive, rapidly changing, and fun!<br/><br/>Everyone starts in the Garden outside the Tower. Travel around the tower's seven levels, take secret passages, and use staircases, in an attempt to visit each of the four turrets in the tower (in no particular order) and collect a turret token. Once you have all four turret tokens, and have collected Mystery Cards that spell the word &quot;TOWER&quot;, declare your impending win to the other players and then head back to the Garden!  The first person to return to the Garden with Mystery Cards spelling &quot;TOWER&quot; and has a turret token from each of the four turrets, wins the game!<br/><br/>When playing The Tower of Mystery, you win by constantly adjusting your game-play based on unexpected events.  No matter how masterful you think your plan for winning the game is, it WILL be up-ended by your opponents, and the crazy events that occur within the tower. Your goal is to keep moving towards achieving the game objectives as best you can!  During the game, players move around the seven levels, up and down staircases, and into the four turrets, landing on board spaces where &quot;things happen&quot;. Sometimes a player may get money or lose money, get or lose Mystery Cards, may get to roll the dice and see what happens, might have the chance to swap the location of their playing piece with another player's piece, steal cards or money from other players, or any of many different scenarios and possibilities.<br/><br/>In addition to the &quot;TOWER&quot; Mystery Cards, there are Mystery Cards that allow you to do nice things to yourself, or try to stop your opponents.  There are several ways to collect Mystery Cards. Some ways are free, others cost money. The fastest but most risky way to collect free Mystery Cards is to stay in a turrent for multiple turns. However, while in a turret, a player is vulnerable because they cannot play any Mystery Cards. Players can collect up to 3 free Mystery Cards per turn while in a turret so even though it's risky to stay in a turret for very long, there's definitely a benefit to visiting the turrets even though playing Mystery Cards there is a no-no.<br/><br/>Players can play any number of Mystery Cards on any other players (or themselves) even when it's not their turn! This can cause &quot;mayhem&quot; when several players suddenly jump into the action at the same time!  You will have to alter your plans over and over in order to stay ahead of your opponents!  Almost constant player interaction keeps everyone on their toes, all the while laughing and having fun every step of the way!<br/><br/>At the end of each turn that a player's piece is in a turret, they must draw a Turret Card. Turret Cards might affect only the player drawing the card, might affect everyone in the game, or several players but not all.  One thing is for sure: Turret Cards often dramatically change the game for everyone in an instant! Some Turret Cards are helpful, but most of them cause unexpected, often funny events to happen to some or all of the players in the game!<br/><br/>While money is a component of the game, it has no bearing on winning the game! Tower Bucks are used to buy Mystery Cards and pay penalties. Being broke is risky, because if a player is completely broke and they have to pay a fine to the bank or a penalty to another player, they lose three turns!  Hoarding money serves no purpose, however, so each player has to decide how much money is enough to keep and how much is safe to spend.<br/><br/>The Tower of Mystery is a great Party Game for all ages! Adults young and old enjoy playing The Tower of Mystery when together for their regular social Game Night. Families enjoy it for Family Game Night because it's equally playable for both the kids and the parents. It is suitable for children as young as about eight as long as they are able to read the cards and know the best time to play their cards. Teens enjoy The Tower of Mystery because it's so unpredictable and lively.  Even retired yacht club ladies have been known to give up their Friday afternoon dominoes to play The Tower of Mystery!  If you enjoy great player interaction, surprises, laughter and fun, then the Tower of Mystery is the game for you!<br/><br/>"}, "47171": {"rpgartist": ["Christos Achilleos", "David Andrews", "John Blanche", "Dave Carson", "Charles Elliot (I)", "Pete Knifton", "Russ Nicholson", "Dave Stevens", "Stephen Tappin"], "statistics": [], "name": "White Dwarf (Issue 91 - Jul 1987)", "rpgdesigner": ["Jim Bambra", "John Blanche", "Mike Brunton", "Paul Cockburn", "Matt Connell", "Carl Critchlow", "Graeme Davis", "Ashley Dennison", "Paul Freeman", "Phil Gallagher", "David Langford", "Mark Lee", "Allan Miles", "Simon Nicholson", "Tony Osborne", "Richard Priestly", "Marcus L.

Players must carefully allocate their resources as they seek to build their kingdom, complete quests, and attack the enemy&rsquo;s capital.<br/><br/>Set in the rich and diverse Warhammer universe, player's can choose different factions that each have their own style. Will you play the indestructible grudge-bearing Dwarfs, the shrewd and manoeuvrable Empire, the savage and destructive Orcs, or the entropic and mutating forces of Chaos. Or will you cleverly craft an alliance, playing the combined might of the forces of either Order or Destruction?<br/><br/>Warhammer: Invasion follows a similar model to that of Magic: The Gathering. Players will construct a deck of cards to their liking that they will use to battle against each other by drawing cards and using resources to play them. Cards can consist of monsters or heroes, one-off spells or abilities, and permanent structures, devices, or equipment. However, there are many differences which make W:I very different from Magic. Two of the main differences are in the release model and the ordering of the gameplay area.<br/><br/>Rather than a blind collecting model, W:I follows Fantasy Flight Games' LCG model. Each expansion or chapter pack is released with the full contents known to the purchaser. Rarity is not a factor.<br/><br/>Rather than playing your cards into the same area and relying on card draws for resources or extra cards, each player has a 3-zoneCapitol that they must protect and those sides are generally where cards are played. If an opponent causes enough damage to a section of your capitol it is &quot;burned.&quot; If two sides of your capitol are burned you lose. Depending on which side of your capitol you put a card into it will be able to different things. Units and buildings in the Kingdom Zone contribute to your available resource pool while ones in your Quest Zone cotribute to your card draws. Cards played into the Battlefield are used to attack opponents. Also, units in a zone being attacked by an opponent can be used to defend that zone from damage. This adds a large amount of tactical decisions when it comes to playing your cards. You must carefully balance building your economy with the ability to attack and defend.<br/><br/>Warhammer Invasion LCG Core Set contains:<br/><br/>* 1 Rulebook<br/>    * 220 Cards representing 4 factions<br/>    * 4 Capital Boards<br/>    * 35 Resource Tokens<br/>    * 60 Damage Tokens<br/>    * 4 Burning Tokens<br/><br/><br/>Battle Pack Expansion Cycles:<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>    <br/>        <br/>1) The Corruption Cycle:<br/><br/>    The Skavenblight Threat<br/>    Path of the Zealot<br/>    Tooth and Claw<br/>    The Deathmaster's Dance<br/>    The Warpstone Chronicles<br/>    Arcane Fire<br/><br/><br/>2) The Enemy Cycle:<br/><br/>    The Burning of Derricksburg<br/>    The Fall of Karak Grimaz<br/>    The Silent Forge<br/>    Redemption of a Mage<br/>    The Fourth Waystone<br/>    Bleeding Sun<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>        <br/>3) The Morrslieb Cycle:<br/><br/>    Omens of Ruin<br/>    The Chaos Moon<br/>    The Twin Tailed Comet<br/>    Signs in the Stars<br/>    The Eclipse of Hope<br/>    Fiery Dawn<br/><br/><br/>4) The Capital Cycle:<br/><br/>    The Inevitable City<br/>    Realm of the Phoenix King<br/>    The Iron Rock<br/>    Karaz-a-Karak<br/>    City of Winter<br/>    The Imperial Throne<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>        <br/>5) The Bloodquest Cycle:<br/><br/>    Rising Dawn<br/>    Fragments of Power<br/>    The Accursed Dead<br/>    Vessel of the Winds<br/>    Portent of Doom<br/>    Shield of the Gods<br/><br/><br/>6) The Eternal War Cycle:<br/><br/>    Days of Blood<br/>    Oaths of Vengeance<br/>    Battle for the Old World<br/>    Glory of Days Past<br/>    The Ruinous Hordes<br/>    Faith and Steel          <br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>        <br/>7) Deluxe Expansions:<br/><br/>    Assault on Ulthuan<br/>    March of the Damned<br/>    Legends<br/>    Cataclysm<br/>    Hidden Kingdoms<br/><br/><br/><br/>    <br/><br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": ["Chinese Edition", "English edition", "French edition", "German edition", "Italian edition", "Polish edition", "Spanish Edition"], "average": "7.27398", "name": "Warhammer: Invasion", "playingtime": "45", "boardgamemechanic": ["Hand Management", "Variable Player Powers"], "age": "13", "boardgameexpansion": ["95610", "65217", "63787", "130622", "83194", "138110", "108809", "127668", "136592", "96654", "118006", "132208", "143775", "104690", "95624", "73150", "129972", "85637", "57940", "123483", "100237", "75996", "114678", "124349", "93313", "119550", "68722", "89184", "61739", "69881", "80311", "110517", "98764", "102797", "133701", "72322", "55916", "90489", "64651", "58157", "122130"], "usersrated": "5044", "boardgamesubdomain": ["Customizable Games", "Strategy Games"], "boardgamefamily": ["CCGs (Collectible Card Games)", "Living Card Game", "Warhammer Fantasy Card Games", "Warhammer: Invasion \u2013 Living Card Game"], "boardgamepodcastepisode": ["D6G Ep 42: PaintedFigs Interview &amp; Detailed Review of Warhammer: Invasion", "Episode 1, Version 1.1: Hitting you in both ears at the same time", "Episode 1: Let\u2019s ambush those raiders!", "Episode 2: We don\u2019t need another hero", "Episode 3: Two chumps and a champ", "Episode 4: A rush of fists to the face", "Episode 5 : There, wolf!

Designed as the backbone of a full campaign, Return to the Temple of Elemental Evil takes characters from 4th level to as high as 14th level.<br/><br/>This deluxe adventure builds on the groundwork of the original Temple of Elemental Evil (published in 1985), as well as other classic adventures. However, none of those products are necessary to enjoy this one. To use this adventure, a Dungeon Master also needs the Player's Handbook, the Dungeon Master's Guide, and the Monster Manual.<br/><br/>Expanded by;<br/>Caves of Ancient Secrets<br/><br/>"}, "47244": {"rpgartist": ["Tony Ackland", "John Blanche", "Paul Bonner", "Paul Campbell", "Gary Chalk", "Mark Craven", "Les Edwards", "Wayne England", "Jes Goodwin", "Gerry Grace", "Tony Hough", "Colin Howard", "Pete Knifton", "Martin McKenna", "Ian Miller", "Bob Naismith", "Bil Segwick", "Adrian Smith", "Kevin Walker"], "statistics": [], "name": "White Dwarf (Issue 118 - Oct 1989)", "rpgdesigner": ["Graeme Davis", "Simon Forrest", "Anthony Ragan", "Andy Warwick"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic511968.jpg", "usersrated": "1", "average": "7", "rpgissue": ["White Dwarf"], "rpgissuearticle": ["'Eavy Metal", "'Eavy Metal", "'Eavy Metal", "Advanced Heroquest", "Blood Bowl Magic", "Culture Shock", "Genestealer Patriarch", "Ignorant Armies", "Illuminations", "Marienburg", "Modlling Workshop", "Ork Warbike", "Orks", "Ratspike", "Vindicator"], "rpg": ["Warhammer Fantasy Roleplay (1st Edition)", "White Dwarf"], "rpgpublisher": ["Games Workshop Ltd."], "rpgissueversion": ["Soft Cover"], "poll": [], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic511968_t.jpg", "description": "Games Workshop's monthly games magazine.<br/><br/>Roleplaying articles:<br/><br/>Warhammer Fantasy Roleplay<br/>Marienburg - Introduction and history of the city and the Wasteland (Anthony Ragan and Graeme Davis)<br/>Ignorant Armies - Characters from the short stories (Andy Warwick)<br/><br/>Other content:<br/><br/>Culture Shock<br/>Ratspike<br/>Orks<br/>'Eavy Metal<br/>Ork Warbike<br/>Vindicator<br/>Modelling Workshop<br/>Blood Bowl Magic<br/>Illuminations<br/>Advanced Heroquest<br/>Genestealer Patriarch<br/><br/>"}, "47245": {"rpgartist": ["Thomas Denmark"], "rpg": ["Orkworld"], "statistics": [], "name": "Orkworld", "rpgdesigner": ["John Wick"], "rpgproducer": ["John Bacon", "Jennifer Brandes", "Chris Hepler", "Richard K.

The GM prepares all the details of an adventure, and then &quot;runs&quot; the players through that adventure. This usually requires a great deal of preparation on the part of the GM.<br/><br/>Mythic is different in that it requires no preparation from the GM. Mythic adventures are meant to be played off the cuff, with perhaps a few minutes of brainstorming to come up with the initial setup. Mythic can also be played entirely without a GM. The same mechanics in Mythic that allow a GM to run an adventure without preparation also allows a group of players to do without the GM.<br/><br/>In a Mythic adventure, the GM (or players sans GM) can start an evening's entertainment with about five minutes of preparation. As the adventure unfolds, the GM is just as surprised by the twists and turns as the players are.<br/><br/>There are various ways in which Mythic can be used:<br/><br/><br/>     No GM, multiple players: Players decide on an opening scenario, and perhaps a few details or two, and Mythic takes it from there. All action is decided through the asking of yes/no questions and the application of logical principles. By answering questions, the adventure moves along, with the occasional random event throwing players a curve ball. The action is broken into scenes, just like in a movie, to keep everything straight. <br/><br/><br/><br/>     No GM, one player: Mythic can be used to go solo. There have been many solo systems in the past. But let's be honest, they weren't so great. Solo play in Mythic works the same as group play. You're just alone.<br/><br/><br/><br/>     One GM, any number of players: For those who like to be a GM, we have something for you, too. The same tools that allow Mythic to automatically generate adventures on the fly without a GM also work with a GM. This means very little to zero preparation, if you don't want to prepare. Simply create an opening scenario (hey, you can come up with that on the drive over!) and follow Mythic as it guides you along. Mythic will throw in its own twists and turns, so the GM will be just as shocked as the players.<br/><br/><br/><br/>     Mythic, stand-alone: Mythic can be played as a complete role-playing game. The same logic-based tools that guide an adventure along can also answer other questions, such as &quot;Did Boltar's sword hit the goblin?&quot; On its own, Mythic is a free-form and interpreted system. Much of the details defining a campaign world will come up as the adventure proceeds. <br/><br/><br/><br/>     Mythic with other RPGs: Mythic's main strength is the ability to generate dynamic, unfolding adventures on the fly. Mythic can replace the GM even if you're playing another role-playing game and not using Mythic rules as the core rules for your campaign. Mythic takes the place of the GM, but the main RPG's rules still handle character creation, combat, task resolution and everything else. Questions that players would normally ask the GM are now asked to Mythic, instead.<br/><br/><br/>"}, "47393": {"boardgamedesigner": ["(Uncredited)"], "poll": [], "name": "The Good Health Game", "playingtime": "30", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": ["Roll / Spin and Move"], "yearpublished": "2008", "usersrated": "0", "maxplayers": "0", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic513254_t.jpg", "average": "0", "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["R.J.E.

Catchy modular rules support the exciting background. Cutting edge meets one of the most important issues currently. That which all fear now happens - with a dose of fantasy - in Heredium: Nature take revenge for her exploitation.<br/><br/>Unlike other RPGs, that play out after disaster, this act of chance gives humanity a new beginning. The innovative roleplaying system starts in October 2008 with this positive perspective.<br/><br/>The world is on the brink. In the year 2190 AD an explosion rips the lunar surface. The force of the impact catapulted a chunk of the Moon towards blue planet - the piece flies by just above the Earth's atmosphere and throws the world's oceans into torment.<br/><br/>On the surface states and cultures are shaken by natural disasters shaken for a millemia. Finally, old foundations collapse, and the world community as such no longer exists.<br/><br/>Ten years pass, until the Earth regains its inner balance again.<br/><br/>Now, only five civilizations exist, each dominated by the bulk of their continent, uniting technology and philosophy in a new foundation. A largely peaceful coexistence, but it is not be long until the nature of Humans drives them to new conquests and wars. And to exploit the natural world once more.<br/><br/>But Gaia awakes, and in her lap germinates poisonous seeds, willing to crawl to the surface to bloom and finally destroy the parasites on her back.&quot;<br/><br/>"}, "47424": {"rpgdesigner": ["Stewart Wieck"], "rpgitemversion": ["PDF Version", "Soft Cover"], "statistics": [], "name": "The Secret in the Swamp", "rpgartist": ["Patrick Zircher"], "rpgproducer": ["Scott B.

The creatures described in this work are presented from a medieval point of view to help set the mood of your game.<br/><br/>The creatures described within this bestiary are ones known to the people of Mythic Europe, the setting of Ars Magica. Thus, there are familiar animals -- horses and hounds, cats and cows -- and exotic creatures -- dragons, gryphons, and sirens. Each creature is presented with a description written by Caprea of House Bjornaer, which reflects her views as a maga and scholar in the Order of Hermes. Statistics are presented for creatures when appropriate, and are compatible with Ars Magica Fourth Edition.<br/><br/>"}, "47040": {"rpgdesigner": ["Baldassarre Minopoli", "Mirko Pellicioni", "Claudio Verri"], "rpgitemversion": ["Print Edition"], "statistics": [], "name": "Manga Fantasy", "rpgartist": ["Auro Daviddi", "Cristian Guerreschi", "Andrea Longhi", "Rosa Maiorano", "Mirko Pellicioni", "Valeria Romanini", "Daniele Rudoni"], "rpg": ["Vento dell'Est: Manga Fantasy"], "usersrated": "0", "rpggenre": ["Animation / Comics (Anime / Manga)", "Culture (Asian / Far Eastern)", "Fantasy"], "rpgpublisher": ["Wild Boar Edizioni"], "rpgcategory": ["Core Rules (min needed to play)"], "poll": [], "average": "0", "description": "Vento dell'Est - Manga Fantasy<br/><br/>Set in a fantasy Imperial Japan, ideally the same setting of anime like Inuyasha and such, Vento dell'Est - Manga Fantasy is just what the name implies: high adventures in an imaginary orient.<br/><br/>Players take the role of samurai, monks, martial artists, wise wizards and go about adventuring.

In Gambit 7, all players simultaneously write their answer to the same question and place it face-up on the Betting Board. All questions have a numerical answer, so even players that don't know the subject matter at hand can make a guess!<br/><br/>Players then have a limited time to either bet on themselves or bet on another player's answers. The winning answer is the one that is closest to being correct, but no higher! Players earn points for either getting the winning answer or for betting on the player who does. The one with the most points after 7 rounds of questions is the winner!<br/><br/>Gambit categories include: Business &amp; Economy; Art &amp; Literature; Geography &amp; Nature; History &amp; Government; Pop Culture; Science; Sports &amp; Leisure; and Wild Card. The set of questions in Gambit 7 were designed to be culturally appropriate for each specific language version.<br/><br/>While Gambit 7 can be played with as few as 3 players, the more friends and family you gather, the more fun and excitement you will experience!

Whoever develops ISRU technology able to glean water from space rather than Earth will gain the strategic high ground to make money through exoglobalization.<br/><br/>In High Frontier, players are Earth governments which are racing to put together a functioning space program to extract resources and colonize the other planets, moons, and asteroids in our solar system.  Players use water in LEO as currency to bid on space-related patents for thrusters, refineries, and robotics.  Putting together a functional craft is not easy, as the heavier the craft becomes, the less maneuverable it is and the more fuel (also water in LEO) the craft will require, so players have to balance useful heavy parts with lighter, less functional parts.  Victory points are awarded for successful mineral extractions, and for being the first to reach key technologies and exploration points in the solar system.<br/><br/>Now in its second edition.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": ["First Printing", "Second edition /  \"First Reprint\" edition"], "name": "High Frontier", "playingtime": "180", "boardgamemechanic": ["Auction/Bidding", "Dice Rolling", "Hand Management", "Pick-up and Deliver", "Point to Point Movement", "Simulation", "Variable Player Powers"], "age": "12", "boardgameexpansion": ["124147", "68305", "149689"], "usersrated": "1367", "boardgameaccessory": ["High Frontier Poster Map"], "boardgamesubdomain": ["Strategy Games", "Thematic Games"], "average": "7.4443", "boardgamepodcastepisode": ["Episode L \u2013 Ryan\u2019s Reviews", "Episodio 11 \u2013 Especial verano 2013: Juegos no jugados", "Episodio pre alfa \u2013 High Frontier \u2013 As\u00ed, a lo bruto\u2026", "I've Been Diced! episode 12: High Frontier", "I've Been Diced! episode 13: Guilty pleasure board games", "I've Been Diced! episode 27: An expanding universe of expansions", "I've Been Diced! episode 47: Ignoble successes and serious SF games", "Ludology Episode 50 - 50 for 50, Part 1", "OBG 049: Social Contracts", "The Good, The Board, and the Trying to Be Consistant:  Episode 27 \u201cHeavy Games\u201d", "\uc81c109\ud68c \uac8c\uc784 \ub300 \uac8c\uc784 - \uc9c0\uad6c\ub97c \ub5a0\ub098\ub294 \uac1c\ucc99\uc790\ub4e4"]}, "47056": {"rpgartist": ["Christos Achilleos", "Declan Considine", "Carl Critchlow", "Mark Harrison", "Gary Mayes", "Rowan Moore", "John Mould", "Bil Segwick", "Cathy Wood"], "statistics": [], "name": "White Dwarf (Issue 60 - Dec 1984)", "rpgdesigner": ["Andrew Baker", "Kath Bilgora", "Simon Burley", "Robin Cameron", "Gary Chalk", "Russell Clarke", "Doug Cowie", "Carl Critchlow", "Graeme Davis", "Joe Dever", "Dougal Dixon", "Albie Fiore", "Mark Harrison", "Alan Heaven", "Stuart Hunter", "David Langford", "Ian Marsh", "Alex McCunn", "Andrew Miller", "Dave Morris", "Lindsey D.
