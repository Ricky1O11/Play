As in Klondike, players try to remove all tiles from play by creating stacks from Ace to King, but unlike in Klondike players have an incentive to keep Aces in play rather than removing them; if a player has one Ace in play, then he can move Queens to empty columns in addition to Kings, and with two or more Aces in play he can also move Jacks to empty columns. A player can place only the rightmost tile in the &quot;talon&quot; &ndash; the row of exposed tiles from the stock &ndash; but if he cashes in a joker, he can move any tile in the talon to the rightmost position.<br/><br/>Solitaire for Two plays similarly to Six-Suit Solitaire, but the players take turns drawing tiles from the stock &ndash; three at a time &ndash; and trying to place them in the layout and score as many tiles as possible.

Frodo and his companions journey from Bag End to the destruction of the Ring at Mount Doom. The coverage of the cards is largely loyal to the movies, but it does take some of its lore from the book, and make references to certain atmospheres within the book. Some card sets, such as the Expanded Middle Earth Draft collection, have actors playing roles that were not seen in the movie, replete with costume. This allows for Tom Bombadil and Ghan Buri Ghan (among others) to be considered part of the card game. Nonetheless, they are rare, and typically you feel as if you are playing the movie rather than the book.<br/><br/>The game will be fairly familiar to veteran CCG players with a couple of important exceptions: firstly, combat is magic-like in execution but more incremental in resolution: each &quot;lost&quot; combat results in only a wound, not elimination as in Magic, L5R, Star Wars, or most other CCGs. Each character can suffer a limited number of wounds before being eliminated, but this &quot;health&quot; rating is also expended for card special actions - there is no &quot;tapping&quot;. Also importantly, this is not a &quot;draw one&quot; game but a &quot;hand-filling&quot; game, which results in a very different dynamic. Lastly, like ICEs Middle-Earth CCG that came before, cards are either &quot;hero&quot; or &quot;shadow&quot; cards; when you play Free Peoples cards in your turn, you effectively pay their cost in Twilight Points to your opponent, who then turns around and uses those points to play Shadow Cards to attack you.<br/><br/>As a final comment, Decipher finally saw the light and put a 4-card cap on every card during deck building (and this includes variations; so there is an Aragorn: Ranger of the North and an Aragorn: King in Exile; you can only have total of 4 combined). Additionally, there is a much more sane rarity distribution than previous Decipher products (many - in fact most - familiar characters are common or uncommon, or at least have common or uncommon variations that are no less powerful than the rare versions).<br/><br/>This game &quot;ended&quot; when Decipher ran into financial difficulties and let the license expire.

Whether Harry Gibson designed that game is therefore open to some doubt.<br/><br/>Stratego is very much like L'Attaque, published after World War II when the patent would have expired.<br/><br/>The board, which supposedly represents an area of sea, is superimposed with a rectangular grid. A Base is shown on two of the opposite edges of the board. The area round each base is protected by a harbour wall.<br/><br/>Each player has a fleet of forty playing pieces. These pieces are rectangles of cardboard which stand upon plastic supports. The two sides are distinguished by the colour on the back of each card, red and blue in this case. The fronts of the cards depict various ships, mines and a flying boat. Each piece has a printed value from 1 for a Patrol Vessel to 10 for the Flagship. These values represent the relative strength of each ship and also indicate the type of ship; battle cruisers, light cruisers, etc.. The ships are also named, H.M.S. Lion, H.M.S. Glasgow and so on. The object of the game is to capture the enemy Flag and transport it back to one's own base while still retaining possession of one's own Flag.<br/><br/>To start the game, the players place their Flag on their Base and then set up their pieces, one per rectangle, on their own side of the board and with the backs of the cards facing the opponent. In turn the players move a piece one space orthogonally until two opposing pieces are back-to-back. The moving player may then call 'Attack', the two relevant pieces are then revealed and the one with the lower value is sunk and removed from the board.<br/><br/>In addition to the fighting ships, the players have a number of auxiliary pieces. Mines will automatically blow up virtually all ships that are moved into an attacking position, regardless of whether the owner of the moving ship attacks or not. Once placed, mines may not be moved. Only the mine sweepers can destroy mines. The mine layers act as floating mines. They can be moved but may not attack, but have the same effect upon enemy shipping as a mine. Only the destroyers can sink them. Submarines have a marauding role and can sink all ships except mine layers and MTB's. The good old flying boat has a very important role as it is principally used to capture the enemy flag because it can fly over the harbour walls. Only MTB's and destroyers can shoot it down. When the opposing flag is captured, it is clipped to the top of the capturing piece and thus its whereabouts are known to all. The Flag can be transferred to any other piece standing orthogonally adjacent to the piece which is transporting it.<br/><br/>It is a fairly straightforward game to play, though tactics can well be employed, particularly in the setting up phase.<br/><br/>"}, "2607": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic156545.jpg", "poll": {}, "boardgamedesigner": {"11656": {"name": "Walter Lee"}}, "statistics": {}, "yearpublished": "1938", "maxplayers": "6", "age": "8", "boardgamepublisher": {"253": {"name": "Editrice Giochi"}}, "maxplaytime": "90", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic156545_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "90", "boardgamecategory": {"1031": {"name": "Racing"}}, "description": "The object of the game according to the early editions of the rules is to own the horse that wins the race.

Players race mules and men to the end of the track and back. However, it has some interesting features, particularly in the determination of the winner. Depending upon the number of players, in addition to the mules, there are either 1 or 2 men in the race, each of a unique color. Each player guides either a mule or a man. On a turn, two color dice are rolled and the appropriate tokens moved forward. If two of the same color are rolled, then that token moves backwards one space. Simple enough so far.<br/><br/>The twist is that the next player may opt to keep intact one of the dice and only roll the remaining die. This subtle rules twist allows for some 'catch-up' ability, as well as some nice hoseage as it makes it possible to move one player's token on several consecutive turns if all players keep that die intact. This may sound like a good thing for the affected player, but in reality being the first to cross the finish line is NOT always the best occurrence. What? Well, the game has a very clever mechanism to determine the winner.<br/><br/>If you are the first player to have your token cross the finish line, then you only win if the last piece remaining on the track is a man piece. Otherwise, if the final piece remaining is a mule, then that player is the winner! So, you have to make a judgment during the game as to whether you want to try to finish first or last, then attempt to move the other pieces accordingly.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "3", "boardgameversion": {"139817": "Klee Edition 1999"}, "name": "Das St\u00f6rrische Muli", "playingtime": "20", "boardgamemechanic": {"2035": "Roll / Spin and Move"}, "average": "6", "usersrated": "36", "age": "8"}, "2610": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic514076.jpg", "boardgameimplementation": {"5795": "Richelieu"}, "poll": {}, "boardgamedesigner": {"86": {"name": "Michael Schacht"}}, "statistics": {}, "yearpublished": "2001", "maxplayers": "5", "boardgameartist": {"22496": "Hans-J\u00f6rg Brehm"}, "boardgamepublisher": {"1001": {"name": "(Web published)"}}, "maxplaytime": "45", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic514076_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "45", "boardgamecategory": {"1002": {"name": "Card Game"}}, "description": "Kardinal &amp; K&ouml;nig - Das Kartenspiel is the card game based on the &quot;Kardinal &amp; K&ouml;nig&quot; boardgame from Goldsieber Spiele (also issued as &quot;Web of Power&quot; by Rio Grande Games).  <br/>  <br/>Idea of the game  <br/>Europe, the center of power in the 12th century.

The situation is that of the beginning of the film.  Players secretly place swimmers on individual boards with the aim of recreating the exact placement of the swimmers on the game board.<br/><br/>The game is played with 19 small rocks in grey, brown, yellow or white and beautiful handmade materials, and is performed in two parts.  During the first part the stones are placed onto the playing field via auctions.  Two stones at a time are drawn from the bag and auctioned by having each player bidding using one big and one small card.  The small cards have a value from 1 to 3, the big from 1 to 12.  The player with the highest product of the two cards may place both stones onto the board.  The big card is removed from the game, the small card will stay open until the last card of the same type is played.   Only after 3 bidding rounds will you get more small cards in your hand.<br/><br/>The idea is to place the stones in the right order, which is stated on the card you have hidden from your opponents. You may score a row or column five times during the game even when it isn't your turn. When both color and position match you you place a so-called &quot;2F&quot; or &quot;3F&quot; marker at the row/column which will bring you 2 or 3 points for each correct stone - which can amount to quite a good score in the long 5 stone row. If only the color, but not the position, is correct you use the &quot;2A&quot; or &quot;1A&quot; markers.  One or two points per stone won't get you far, especially in the short 3-stone row, but the most important aspect is not to use the markers too soon.  Firstly, because you cannot score a particular row/column more than once, secondly because you can get your points in the second half of the game.<br/><br/>When all stones have been placed onto the board the second half of the game beings.  Here you may rearrange the stones. Before the game is over you may you exchange two stones with each other five times.  You shouldn't use your 2- or 3-marker on the short rows/columns, but rather concentrate on the longer. The board has two 5-, four 4- and four 3-rows, and if you don't get the maximum points early in the game will you have to look foolishly on as your opponent places his markers on the two 5- and three of the 4-rows to score maximum points.<br/><br/>"}, "2621": {"boardgamedesigner": {"1067": {"name": "Oliver Deiser"}}, "poll": {}, "name": "Claim", "playingtime": "30", "minplayers": "2", "yearpublished": "1999", "usersrated": "17", "boardgamesubdomain": {"4666": "Abstract Games"}, "maxplayers": "4", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1264722_t.jpg", "average": "7.74706", "statistics": {}, "boardgamepublisher": {"573": {"name": "Caroli Spiel"}}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1264722.jpg", "boardgamefamily": {"24777": "Dots and Boxes"}, "maxplaytime": "30", "boardgamecategory": {"1009": {"name": "Abstract Strategy"}}, "age": "12", "minplaytime": "30", "description": "Claim is an abstract tactical game for 2, 3, or 4 players (two teams of 2), age 12 and up.

Knapp, the originator of the popular 1930s game &quot;Krazy-Ikes.&quot;<br/><br/>Knapp was eventually bought out by Parker Brothers for $10,000--a significant sum at the time.

The board represents a web with two nests at opposite ends, and stands up between the players.  Each player uses his side of the board to move his spiders on (three small ones and a large one).  Each spider has two long flexible legs with which it steps over the web; each leg ends in a peg which fits into holes in the web.  The catch is that if you insert your peg in a hole occupied by an opponent's spider, it pushes his peg out.  A spider hanging by only one leg is a &quot;dangler&quot; and is in danger of being pushed off the web altogether (and out of the game) should the opponent push its other leg out.  Re-attaching a dangler uses up one's entire turn.<br/><br/>The object of the game is either to eliminate all of the opponent's spiders or put a leg in his nest.<br/><br/>On your turn, you move two different legs, belonging to the same or two different spiders.  The small spiders' leg span confines them to adjacent holes.  The big spider, the Daddy Long Leg, has a greater span and can use holes two spaces apart.  A move consist of detaching a leg, pivoting around the other, and plugging the free leg back in.<br/><br/>"}, "2650": {"boardgamedesigner": {"1076": {"name": "Dan Sullivan"}}, "poll": {}, "name": "Infection", "playingtime": "60", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": {"2035": "Roll / Spin and Move"}, "yearpublished": "1998", "usersrated": "30", "maxplayers": "8", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic325392_t.jpg", "average": "5.25", "statistics": {}, "boardgamepublisher": {"580": {"name": "Earwig Enterprises"}}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic325392.jpg", "maxplaytime": "60", "boardgamecategory": {"2145": {"name": "Medical"}}, "age": "9", "minplaytime": "60", "description": "Players roll dice to race around the board, catching diseases and trying to be cured.

A Mighty Fortress is designed with a mechanical simplicity that is matched only by the subtlety of the game's interplay among contesting forces.<br/><br/>A Mighty Fortress simulates the conditions, which made possible the spread of the Lutheran Reformation and the subsequent Catholic reaction (the Counter-Reformation) in the years 1532-1555. The game recreates the actual historical objectives of the major countries in Europe in the Sixteenth Century as well as their military strengths and resources. There are six players in the game representing the six major countries, England, France, the Ottoman Empire, the Hapsburgs, the Pope, and the collection of German states we will call The Lutherans.<br/><br/>The Lutheran player is intent on promoting the Protestant cause throughout Europe, and the Papacy is equally resolved to gather any straying nations back into the Catholic fold. The Hapsburg Empire -- strong in arms and sprawling across half the continent -- seeks to maintain its possessions in the face of pressure from all directions. In England, Henry VIII is engaged with his own confrontation with the Pope; and French forces are marshalling to dismantle the Hapsburg dominions. And Suleiman the Magnificent is constantly watching for the opportunity to expand his Ottoman empire -- at anyone's expense.<br/><br/>The Hapsburgs have, by far, the largest number of combat forces. Unhindered by other problems, they could easily suppress Lutheranism. However, other players have objectives that can usually be achieved only at the expense of the mighty Hapsburgs. Therefore, depending on the rapidly shifting political situation, there will probably be several alliances against Hapsburg influence. Because of this convoluted political situation, the players will often find themselves at cross-purposes with other players whom they were aiding the Game-Turn before. Thus, the possibilities for political and military interaction are extensive.<br/><br/>A Mighty Fortress covers the twenty-four years from 1532 to 1555 -- a period fraught with shifting alliances, political and religious fervor, and frantic efforts to shift the balance of power. Theological debates, treaties of peace, declarations of war, excommunication, taxation, and missionaries -- all are included in this simulation of one of the most violent and implacably hostile eras of European history. The game covers all actions from the year 1532 -- right after formation of the Schmalkaldic League -- until 1555 and the Peace of Augsburg, which guaranteed Lutheranism as a religion [sic] and allowed the German estates to choose between that and Catholicism.<br/><br/>Other notes:<br/><br/>Special rules include those for missionaries, conversion, peace treaties, formal alliances, truces, ultimata, ceding territory, income and borrowing, theological debates, excommunication, Henry VIII's divorce and hidden, variable victory conditions.<br/>Counters = 200<br/><br/>Other credits:<br/><br/>Graphic Design: Redmond A.

If the mousetrap doesn't malfunction, the mouse is captured and out of the game.  The winner is the last mouse who avoids being trapped.  The main appeal of Mouse Trap is the ridiculously complex contraption that is the mousetrap.

In this game, players take the part of the Tai-Pans of major corporations doing business in Hong Kong in the early 1960's, as portrayed in the Clavell book. Each player is head of a large business conglomerate and is striving to be the most influential and powerful leader in the Hong Kong business community. The route to power lies in the manipulations of the stock market, banks, and holding companies, and other typical corporate skull duggery.<br/><br/>Synopsis of play:<br/><br/>During a turn, players draw event cards, which can be used in many ways to affect one's own future, or the future of an opponent. Players then buy and sell stocks on a volatile stock market, which can fluctuate due to purchase and sale of stocks, failed contracts, or even loss of face (bad faith deals). Contracts are then announced, and if a player has sufficient assets, and can maintain those assets, lots of money can be made. Unfulfilled contracts go up for a general bid amongst the players. Players can then attempt to acquire loans from 3 Hong Kong banks, but, if the Bank Directors, or their proxies, so vote, a player can simply be denied a loan. Furthermore, bank directors, in the person of voting cards held by players, can call in outstanding loans, which must be immediately paid. Players now purchase various assets, such as airlines, railroads, shipping lines, industry, land, and human services, which the player must have to fulfill contractual obligations. Players can buy their own assets, or even lease them from other players. All possible wheeling and dealing is allowed, and no one is ever required to keep his or her end of a bargain. Lastly, if a player's stock falls far enough, and they have been unfortunate enough to lose enough of their own &quot;voting&quot; stock, they can be voted out of the game, which will end the game at the end of that phase.

The Gnummies &amp; their friends are shown on the Gnumies card, &amp; the guests on the party cards. There are 4 of each party card valued from 1 to 10, &amp; one of each party card valued from 11 to 15. The players try to win the most party cards, worth the most points, by playing their Gnumie cards.

These of course can only be done with the cards that are valued from 1 to 10. A player who wins a Wullawaki, loses points. Having 1 Wullawaki will force you to lose the lowest valued party card that you have. Having 2 Wullawakis will force you to lose the highest valued party card in his party room. With 3 or more Wullawakis, the player will discard as many party cards as he has Wullawakis, (players choice in this case). Of course, the player with the most points at the end of the game is the WINNER!!!<br/><br/>GAME PLAY:<br/><br/>1) Any player turns over the top-most card in the party supply stack. <br/>2) Now each player selects a Gnumie card from his hand (Cards have a value from 10 to 100), and places it face-down in front of him (in his Party Room!). When all players have placed their bids face-down on the table, all players then reveal their bids. <br/>3) The player who played the highest valued bid in his party room wins the face-up party card. <br/>4) If 2 or more players tie with the highest bid, the player who has the the most Luckynits (small figures at the bottom of each Gnumie card), wins the party card. <br/>5) The player who wins the party card must discard the Gnumie card that he won with that bid. <br/>6) The other players take back their losing bid party cards. The round is now over and we repeat with Step 1 again.<br/><br/>7) There is a little twist in the bidding when the Wullawaki card (bad card) comes out. The player with the highest Gnumie card still wins the Wullawaki card, but gets to take back his Gnumie card into his hand and the other players lose their Gnumie cards!<br/><br/>8) The is also a &quot;WILD CARD&quot; in this game. It is called the &quot;COPICASTOR&quot;. It is a card used to make at least a pair of party cards. The Copicastor takes on the form of the lowest valued party card that the player has in his party room. This insures that a player will have at least a pair of cards and also make the low valued cards somewhat valuable to have, since some people may avoid making a high bid on a low value card. But, if you get this Copicastor it makes that low valued card at least worth 20 points (for a pair).<br/><br/>9) The game ends when 1 player is left with his Gnumie cards. Since, he can't bid against anybody else, he takes the top most party cards as he has Gnumie cards in his hand.<br/><br/>10) Scoring is based on attaining pairs, three-of-a-kind &amp; 4-of-a-kind of the numbered party cards that the players bid on (check the Overview paragraph above). If no pairs are attained, the value of that card is scored. So, if you have two 5-point cards, you score 20 Points for having a pair. But, if you have only one 5-point card you score 5 points!<br/><br/>10) The player with the most points at the end of the game wins!!!<br/><br/>Ages 8 and up<br/>Re-implements:<br/><br/>    Asterix: Das Kartenspiel<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": {"26473": "German first edition"}, "name": "The Gnumies", "playingtime": "20", "boardgamemechanic": {"2012": "Auction/Bidding"}, "average": "5.35635", "usersrated": "197", "age": "8"}, "2739": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic789380.jpg", "is_expanded_by": {"207599": {"name": "Cosmic Supreme"}}, "poll": {}, "boardgamedesigner": {"34": {"name": "Bill Eberle"}}, "statistics": {}, "yearpublished": "1992", "maxplayers": "8", "boardgamepublisher": {"10": {"name": "Mayfair Games"}}, "boardgameintegration": {"1566": "Simply Cosmic"}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic789380_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "90", "boardgamecategory": {"1002": {"name": "Card Game"}}, "description": "This expansion set for Mayfair's Cosmic Encounter (1991) adds 54 more powers (and flares), Moons, Lucre, Special Destiny Cards, Comets and more.<br/><br/>Expands:<br/><br/>    Cosmic Encounter<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": {"26931": "Mayfair English First Edition"}, "maxplaytime": "90", "average": "7.67397", "name": "More Cosmic Encounter", "playingtime": "90", "boardgamemechanic": {"2015": "Variable Player Powers"}, "age": "12", "boardgameexpansion": {}, "usersrated": "469", "boardgamesubdomain": {"5497": "Strategy Games"}, "boardgamefamily": {"133": "Cosmic Encounter"}}, "2740": {"boardgamedesigner": {"2421": {"name": "Dick de Rijk"}}, "poll": {}, "name": "Jumbo Jet", "playingtime": "240", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": {"2035": "Roll / Spin and Move"}, "yearpublished": "1975", "usersrated": "191", "boardgamefamily": {"100": "Monopoly"}, "maxplayers": "6", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic65273_t.jpg", "average": "4.76283", "statistics": {}, "boardgamepublisher": {"335": {"name": "Jumbo"}}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic65273.jpg", "boardgameversion": {"29309": "International Edition"}, "maxplaytime": "240", "boardgamecategory": {"2650": {"name": "Aviation / Flight"}}, "age": "10", "minplaytime": "240", "description": "This game is a Monopoly variant, with an international airways theme.

Roberts Best Twentieth Century Game Nominee"}, "description": "&quot;A game of plane to plane combat in World War I&quot;<br/><br/>There is plenty of goodies in the box, including three geomorphic map boards, plenty of thick counters, and as much rules as you can stomach. Luckily, you can select both your level of realism (i.e. complexity: ranging from the Mass Game to the Duel Game) and the length of the scenario (30 min to 4 hours), so the game is pretty flexible in this regard.<br/><br/>(what follows is abstracted from the ZOCO Historical Simulations Archive review)<br/><br/>Wings is a simultaneous movement job and can get pretty complex. This is traditional heavy duty boardgaming, not as complex as Advanced Squad Leader but harder than Wooden Ships &amp; Iron Men and only workable with very few planes per player. Thankfully the rules do not all have to be used and Wings works pretty well with basic rules, with some of the advanced and optionals as required. The advanced rules are supposed to be used as a block but consist largely of tricky maneuvers as opposed to the turns and slides of the basic rules. A simpler fleet-style game using plenty of planes is also provided. The scenarios provided include the legendary Wings 6 hex Zeppelin counter, boat targets, bombing, trench-strafing and photo runs.<br/><br/>The basic problem of WWI air combat as presented in Wings is that the planes are not very good, not very fast, grossly underpowered, turn poorly and chances are that when they get a shot off they tend to miss. As a result, there is a lot of manoeuvring (more than the columns provided on the plotting pad) and relatively little damage (it could have been jotted down separately instead of occupying part of the pad). 3-D is simulated through altitude levels (0 to the 800s --although many planes will not get that high); planes go faster when diving and lose speed when climbing. Go too slow and you will stall and spin downwards until you can pick up enough speed or crash.<br/><br/>Simultaneous movement games often involve a lot of ESP because it is hard to tell where the opposition is going. Things are not so bad in Wings because planes have bank attitudes showing which way they lean, like in Blue Max. Turning, manoeuvring and climbing restrictions are such that you can narrow down the other plane's intent by carefully paying attention to its banking attitude. Likewise, firing arcs are restricted, and the penalties for firing in a turn and the like are pretty steep, so naturally a plane that thinks it has a good shot will keep pretty straight and level, not too hard to out-manoeuvre. The general problem of planes chasing each other over an endless sky and having limited powers of turning and climbing means they will not often be in each other's guns. Having missed, it will take some time for the planes to all move around back into suitable combat positions. The game is considerably improved by having more than 1 plane on each side, thus ameliorating the chance of someone being able to fire at someone else.<br/><br/>Gunnery is based on 2D6 rolled as 11 to 66 (a frequent mechanism in Yaquinto games). Results will rarely destroy a target on 1 hit but affect some part of the plane. When not hitting Structure, your hits will likely reduce the limited performance of the planes. Some hits can reduce the power rating of planes. If the target only has 1<br/>power to spend each turn and it loses that, then it is in trouble --it can no longer climb or turn without losing speed and will be forced to dive to get anywhere. It is thus more sensible to fly off when suitably blooded rather than prolonging the game as planes slowly drag themselves back into combat.<br/><br/>Solitaire gaming works quite well because the rules severely limit what a plane can do so the guessing is kept low. Play actually improves with more players as this generates more opportunities for mayhem. 50 plane types are provided although Yaquinto never published Wings II so other planes are referred to in the force tables that have no details (although it just may be possible to figure out those &quot;missing&quot; planes' characteristics from their counterparts in Blue Max and Knights of the Air). The planes are rated differently, but unfortunately performance varies with altitude so you need to check the plane reference card frequently --whilst the gun data is on the opposite side of the card.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "1", "boardgameversion": {"109499": "Excalibre English Second Edition"}, "name": "Wings", "playingtime": "120", "boardgamemechanic": {"2689": "Action / Movement Programming"}, "average": "6.93571", "usersrated": "119", "boardgamesubdomain": {"4664": "Wargames"}, "age": "0"}, "2743": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic308784.jpg", "poll": {}, "boardgamedesigner": {"1101": {"name": "Michael E.

Each team represents the combined resources of a bloc of nations at war with the other team.  Points are accumulated by conducting offensives, opening new fronts and successfully countering enemy offensives.  The game ends once all the cards have been drawn and played.<br/><br/>On your turn, you may shift a combat card between two of your fronts before drawing and playing or discarding a card.  Fronts are prepared face down, until the offensive is declared.  Fronts are laid out like in Caesar &amp; Cleopatra (or Hera &amp; Zeus --those kinds of games).  Cards come in two types, combat and &quot;special&quot;.  The combat cards represent units of infantry, armor, mine fields and so on.  Special cards include Strategic Bombing (which permanently reduces a player's hand size), New Front, Offensive/Supply (which launches or sustains an offensive, or can be used to shift Airborne combat cards between fronts).<br/><br/>Points are scored mostly during offensives; every turn an offensive goes on, the difference between the attacker's total offense and the defender's total defense is scored by the stronger side.  There is also a bonus point score when opening a new front.<br/><br/>The cards are very bland looking with a simple APP-6 or SPI-style symbol, a pair of offense/defense ratings and some explanatory text.  Most combat units lack character: Armour, Infantry and Combat Engineers work nearly the same way except for their different offense/defense ratings.  I'd have given the Combat Engineers a special power against Mine Fields, for example.<br/><br/>"}, "2753": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3636532.jpg", "poll": {}, "boardgamedesigner": {"1101": {"name": "Michael E.

Set within this field are a series of Buoys that must be recovered to score victory points.  Some of the Buoys are in fixed positions, others move randomly.  The most valuable of all are the Astaroth, Belial and Lucifer Buoys which are locked in tight orbit in the intense radiation zones surrounding the monstrous Hell2 and Hell3 black holes.  Players must design their ships' maximum function levels in each category of ship operation and must pilot the ship through the treacherous course in the quest of Buoys.  Players must always be aware of the course obstacles, the positions of the other racers, and the remaining fuel supply of their ship.

This game is much easier than cards game, because it's always wholly displayed to the players, and, being in the form of a snail or spirally folded snake, it's appropriate to print the things that one wants to learn...'.<br/><br/>The game became an instant hit in France in the 1600s, and engendered a lot of variants (educational, commemorative, ...) up to the present day.<br/><br/>It turned up later in England about 1750, according to Whitehouse, under the title &quot;Royall &amp; most pleasant game of the goose - Invented at the Consistory in Rome and are printed and sold by H. OVERTON at Ye White Horse without Newgate where all sorts of Fine Prints and maps are Sold and Framed at Reasonable Rate&quot;.<br/><br/>By 1851 it had been copied by the American publisher J.P.

These sequences must be along the top row dice face of the cards. Bonus points are scored for also forming certain combinations along the bottom row.

Each player may roll up to 3 of their 4 dice in an attempt to capture 1 or more of these cards.<br/>Cards are captured by rolling the two numbers corresponding to the two dice on a card.

Roberts Best Graphics and Physical Systems Nominee"}, "description": "War in Europe is a compendium of three modules, War in the East 2nd ed., War in the West, and War in Europe. The two base games, War in the East 2nd ed. and War in the West, are both playable individually and are both designed for two sided play. War in Europe provides an integrated linkage between these two and provides for three player play.<br/><br/>The game system traces its lineage from SPI's earlier Kursk and Destruction of Army Group Centre but was primarily inspired by War in the  East 1st. ed.  War in Europe is played on nine full sized (22&quot;x34&quot;) coloured  maps and employs about 3600 1/2x1/2&quot; cardboard pieces.<br/><br/>The three sides in the full game are the Italo-German Axis, the Anglo- French-American Allies, and the Soviet Union. Political rules govern the  alignment of neutral states and restrict the use of active minor power units  by the controlling players. Rules also restrict the degree of co-operation between units of differing nationalities, whether Axis or Allied. The victory  conditions are also constructed to limit the degree of co-operation between  independent Allied and Soviet players.<br/><br/>Each 3/4&quot; hex represents 20 miles. A single game-turn consists of three sequential player turns and represents one week elapsed time. Four game- turns form a 'cycle' at the beginning of which strategic warfare and economic production takes place. Thirteen cycles form a game year. Both Axis and Soviet power produce additional forces via a simplified economic  production process. Allied forces are received only by a preset reinforcement schedule.<br/><br/>Player pieces called units represent division and brigade sized military formations. In addition to units, all powers also possess air-point counters representing abstract air power at an estimated scale of 500 sorties per point. Markers are a third category of playing piece used to note some temporary alteration to the map or to a unit.<br/><br/>Allied and Axis powers have amphibious point counters representing invasion lift assets. Each amphibious point is capable of lifting a single divisional sized unit and as acting as a 'beachhead' supply source. The Axis powers also have counters for Naval Transport points and Naval Surface Combat points. The Axis may build these points via his production routines.<br/><br/>Naval points (of all types) risk interception and elimination (along with any transported unit) by air power when used to transport land units, enable  supply, or provide escort. Axis naval points also risk Allied naval interception and elimination when conducting transport operations on the high seas (anywhere other than the Baltic). The Allied player has a  standard number of naval transport points (15) that does not change from turn to turn and which cannot be destroyed when intercepted, though their cargo may be. Expended (not destroyed) amphibious points are automatically returned to play after a nine turn delay.<br/><br/>The Soviet power possesses one transport point in the Baltic so long as Leningrad remains uncaptured and one naval transport point in the Black Sea so long as the Soviet retains at least one Black Sea port. If the Soviets ever lose their naval transport capability in either sea then it is lost for the rest of the game and cannot be restored.<br/><br/>The Axis power possesses counters for sub points and markers for land fortifications (the Atlantic Wall). Both of these must be produced using the economic system employed during the strategic inter-phase conducted at the start of each cycle. Sub points are used to determine the rate of Allied reinforcement and are themselves subject to loss.<br/><br/>The Allied power receives Strategic Bomber Points which are used to disable Axis Production and Transportation during the Strategic Inter- phase. These are subject to loss by German Strategic Air Defence air- points and Flak Points.<br/><br/>A number of scenarios are provided covering the entire war or significant campaigns. Victory is determined by the Axis political point total and the possession of specified hexes. The Axis political point total is adjusted during the game based on Allied and Axis actions together with the control of specific hexes or the conquest/occupation/liberation of nations. A novel feature in the design is the use of varying CRTs by nation/year to account for the changing relationships in the combat power of units over the course of a six year war without recourse to replacement counters for the units.<br/><br/>The original game was issued in SPI notorious 'flat-pack' plastic tray packaging that required three units to contain the product. Later (1978?) War in Europe was retailed in the large bookcase box format (the Soap- box). The game was ported to a MS-DOS computer program published by  Decision Games in 1996 and a revised reprint of the original boardgame was published by Decision Games in 1999. A New PC version of war in Europe will allow players to battle one another PBEM or face to face and is currently under development.<br/><br/>The game contains: <br/>- 3600 counters<br/><br/>        (Three identical Axis 400 counter contersheets)<br/>        (Three identical Russian 400 counter contersheets)<br/>        (Three identical Western Allied 400 counter contersheets)<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>- Nine maps (A-H,J)<br/>- Four Rulebooks<br/><br/>        (Standard Rules)<br/>        (War in the East 2nd Edition Exclusive Rules)<br/>        (War in the West Exclusive Rules)<br/>        (War in Europe Exclusive Rules)<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>- Axis Production Spiral<br/>- Soviet Production Spiral<br/>- Axis Game-Turn Cycle Record Track<br/>- Soviet Game-Turn Cycle Record Track <br/>- Allied Game-Turn Cycle Record Track<br/>- Two Identical War in the East Comvbat Results Tables<br/>- Two Identical War in the West Comvbat Results Tables<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": {"29137": "English first edition"}, "average": "7.03079", "name": "War in Europe", "playingtime": "360", "boardgamemechanic": {"2072": "Dice Rolling"}, "age": "14", "boardgameexpansion": {}, "usersrated": "151", "boardgamesubdomain": {"4664": "Wargames"}, "boardgamefamily": {"6380": "War in Europe"}}, "2803": {"boardgamedesigner": {"41": {"name": "Valentin Herman"}}, "poll": {}, "name": "Ave", "playingtime": "150", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": {"2002": "Tile Placement"}, "yearpublished": "2000", "usersrated": "5", "boardgamefamily": {"5606": "Ancient Rome"}, "maxplayers": "4", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic7228_t.jpg", "average": "6.4", "statistics": {}, "boardgamepublisher": {"33": {"name": "Fanfor-Verlag"}}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic7228.jpg", "boardgameversion": {"70373": "Fanfor-Verlag first edition"}, "maxplaytime": "150", "boardgamecategory": {"1050": {"name": "Ancient"}}, "age": "14", "minplaytime": "150", "description": "Ave is a game by Valentin Herman for 2-4 Romans, published as a game-kit in 2000 by Fanfor with the intent of developing it into a full game later.

There are 6 tiles of each, numbered from 1 to 6. The board is a simple grid of columns, having starting and finishing squares with patterns matching the tiles. Players draw 6 tiles each and place them on their starting squares, stacking them if necessary. Then they move a tile, or a stack or an upper part of a stack, up their column to the next free space.<br/><br/>When you place a tile, if there is another player's tile on the same row with the same value, it is taken under protection of yours, by placing it under yours to make a stack. You then have another move. So if the 4 Minstrel ends on the same row as the 4 Lady, she is taken under his wing. This can be done in the finishing area too and if this reveals a tile beyond its station, that is removed as a penalty to its owner. When a tile reaches its matching finishing square, it is turned over and is done with. When only one player can move, the game ends and you score. For each tile that reached its place or beyond, you score its value, deducting any penalties. Most points wins. There is a variant using a die to control your moves.<br/><br/>An odd movement game, with some thought and memory needed for the knock-on effect, but not a great game.
