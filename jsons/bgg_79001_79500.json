Four characters are now used during battles instead of eight, and the most powerful spells require cooperation between two different characters. Additionally, movement through the land now happens on an overland screen rather than on a map with pre-chosen destinations, and interaction in towns has also become more like most other RPGs.<br/><br/>There are six main characters to use during the course of the game: the protagonist, Slayn Wilder, who has amnesia; Annette Burns (voiced by Jennifer Stigile in the English version), daughter of the president of Xironia Federation, who seeks to stop the war over the world's remaining food; Hugh Foster (voiced by John Haas in the English version), an amiable fellow with a mysterious past; Monika Allenford (voiced by Jackie Powers in the English version), half-human and half-Featherian, who has a hard time fitting in anywhere; Viktor Hugo (voiced by Dean Williams in the English version), a Russian-inspired inventor and mechanic; and Yayoi Tachibana, a shrine maiden from the East in pursuit of a mysterious fugitive.<br/><br/>Other characters from Growlanser II can be used, provided you have a save file from said game.<br/><br/>On December 7, 2004, Growlanser III, along with Growlanser II: The Sense of Justice, was released under a single title in North America, titled Growlanser Generations<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, Growlanser III: The Dual Darkness , available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "79004": {"statistics": {}, "name": "Paganitzu", "videogamemode": {"2149": "Single-Player"}, "videogameversion": {"57035": "DOS Edition"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1141716.png", "videogametheme": {"2466": "Other"}, "usersrated": "2", "average": "6", "videogamegenre": {"2165": "Puzzle"}, "videogameplatform": {"4714": "DOS"}, "poll": {}, "videogamecompilation": {"189674": "3D Realms Anthology"}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1141716_t.png", "description": "&quot;Paganitzu (Aztec for &quot;Temple of the Gods.&quot;) is a tile-based, CGA/EGA computer game created by Keith Schuler  and published by Apogee Software in October, 1991.

Jumpman defuses a bomb by touching it. According to the story, these are placed on Jupiter by terrorists. Jumpman can climb up and down ladders, and of course jump, and there are two kinds of rope each allowing a single direction of climbing only. Hazards include falling, &quot;smart darts&quot; (small bullets that fly slowly across the screen, but when orthogonally lined up with Jumpman, greatly speed up and shoot straight in his direction) and other hazards that are unique to a certain level.<br/><br/>Points are awarded for each bomb defused, with bonus points available for completing a level quickly.

It was developed and published by Cyberdreams in 1992. It exhibits a normal world and a dark world counterpart, which is based on the artwork by H. R. Giger. It was one of the first adventure games to use high-resolution (640 x 400 pixels) graphics, to Giger's demand. A sequel, Dark Seed II, was released in 1995. The original game was released for Amiga, Amiga CD32, DOS, Macintosh, Sega Saturn and PlayStation. Both console versions were released only in Japan; however, the Saturn version is not dubbed in Japanese, only subtitled[1], making the game's story still accessible to English speakers.

Fleeing to a mysterious mansion, you must gather any materials you can find to protect yourself and fight for your survival against a legion of infected beings!<br/><br/>The Resident Evil DBG brings the story to life in a game of strategy where players construct their card decks while they play.  Choose one of your favorite characters from Resident Evil such as: Chris Redfield, Jill Valentine, or Albert Wesker among others. Players start with only the most basic of items and weapons. As the game progresses, players build their arsenal with additional Weapons, Ammunition, Action or Item cards to customize their deck and improve their ability in defeating the Infected!  Your deck will be your lifeline to survival.  How will you survive the zombie outbreak?<br/><br/>The Resident Evil DBG will consist of 250 playing cards, 3 different game modes (Story, Mercenary and Versus) and hundreds of possible scenarios within each mode for unlimited replay value.  No two games will ever be the same!<br/><br/><br/>     Story mode is the main version of the game where players must race to claim the best weapons, items, and ammunition before others get to it first. Quick thinking and a good instinct will help you survive the Mansion and be the one to escape to safety.  <br/>     Mercenary mode is similar to Story mode but this mode rewards the players that take the offensive. Players must prove their skills by defeating as many zombies as they can in a limited amount of time. This mode can be played in teams.<br/>     Versus mode removes the Infected from the game and pits the human characters against each other in a battle for dominance. Players must watch their back as they attempt to defeat each other while staying alive themselves. Watch out because you may find that players are not as merciful as the Infected!<br/><br/><br/>Players take on the role of one of the Heroes of Resident Evil. They start with a deck of 10 cards, which consist of Weapons and Ammo. Players must use their resources to obtain more powerful Weapons, Ammo, Items, and Action Cards that they add to their deck.

To win the game you must defeat more &quot;Infected&quot; creatures then your opponents, but the game only ends when the strongest &quot;Infected&quot; creatures is killed. Once he is killed, the player that has gained the most Decorations wins the game.<br/><br/><br/>     Ammo cards are used to power your Weapons as well as purchase new cards.<br/>     Weapon cards are used to battle the &quot;Infected&quot; creatures.

The German army then pushed on into France and as its columns closed in on Paris, victory seemed a foregone conclusion. However, defying all odds, the weary French and British made an about face and counterattacked along the Marne, defeating the Schlieffen Plan and halting the German advance.<br/>The 1914 campaign in France would be the opening act of a gruesome war that would not end until 1918, a war which would end with the overthrow of many of the monarchs in Europe, and consume the lives of over eighteen million people. The First World War would mark the end of the Napoleonic old European order, and would be the catalyst for an even greater struggle known as World War II.<br/><br/>France '14 is the first title in a new series entitled First World War Campaigns. This series attempts something that has never been attempted before: to cover all the major campaigns of World War One, with units going down to battalion level. The history of the war itself is often plagued by inaccurate stereotypes and assumptions, and this series attempts to dispel them and bridge what is otherwise a relatively empty wargaming void in history.<br/><br/>The First World War Campaigns series also seeks to demonstrate the evolution of warfare between the Napoleonic period and the Second World War by demonstrating the evolution of weapons and tactics: it will show the rise of tanks, poison gas, assault infantry, and airpower.

In the role of the Germans,  you have your chance to try to storm through the Ardennes and reach the coast at Abbeville in two short weeks of fighting. Or,  playing as the Allies, can you stem the tide and prevent the Nazis from overrunning Europe? For it is May of 1940. Germany has overrun Poland and Scandinavia, but now must face the Western Allies. The combined British-French armies have more tanks than the Wehrmacht, and the Maginot Line blocks any German advance westward. Yet within six weeks, the Wehrmacht will fight one of the most decisive campaigns in history and change the course of warfare as a continent shakes.<br/>  <br/>Smaller scenario lets players re-fight battles such as Sedan (1940), The Gembloux Gap, Dinant, Stonne, and Arras. This was a time when tank tactics were in their inception, and players can use their armor to gain the decision. Campaign optional setups allow for either free Allied play from 10 May or Allied commitment to deploy historically in central Belgium while lightly screening the Ardennes --until it is almost too late.<br/><br/><br/>France '40 contains twenty-five scenarios and campaigns focusing primarily on the period from 10- 24 May. This was the critical time while the panzers cut like a scythe through the Ardennes, and when the Luftwaffe was unleashed against the British and French troops trapped in the pocket at Dunkirk. For players who want to see what would happen had Hitler not halted the panzers before Dunkirk, there is an extended campaign portraying the apocalyptic battle on the English Channel. How long could the remnants of the Allied armies have held Dunkirk if the German had not let up the pressure?<br/><br/>By default, units are of battalion size. However, players may break them down into companies for more realistic play. France '40 comes with an extensive historical order-of-battle that includes German, French, British, Belgian and Dutch units. It is played on a massive map covering over 78,000 hexes that encompasses northern France, Belgium, Luxembourg and southern Holland.<br/><br/>Source: The Publisher Website.<br/><br/>"}, "79098": {"statistics": {}, "name": "Alfred Chicken", "videogamemode": {"2149": "Single-Player"}, "videogameversion": {"98093": "EU Amiga CD-32 Edition"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic987660.png", "videogametheme": {"2471": "Animals"}, "usersrated": "2", "average": "5.5", "videogamegenre": {"2164": "Platform"}, "videogameplatform": {"4415": "Amiga"}, "poll": {}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic987660_t.png", "description": "From the back of the box:<br/><br/>Oh no!

The Germans had already marched across France in a spectacular victory. Now both sides faced each other, with only the English Channel between them. The British Army had been rescued by the miracle at Dunkirk but, as a result of leaving much of its equipment in France, was a poorly equipped, broken force; backed up by untried British Reserves along with some under trained Canadian and Anzac units. The Germans facing them were the juggernaut that had won stunning victory after victory, were full of confidence, but with little experience crossing water. &quot;What if&quot; the RAF had been beaten in the Battle of Britain and events had transpired to create conditions where Hitler might have launched Operation Sealion - the invasion of Great Britain.<br/><br/>While the previous 17 titles in this award-winning series have focused on historical campaigns that were planned and executed across Europe &amp; Africa - this is the first venture into a purely &quot;what if&quot; campaign. With that said, the core game is based solidly on historical plans that the Germans had in place under consideration of execution. Additionally the OOB&rsquo;s are based on the actual forces available to the combatants at the time. This is alternative history at its best!<br/><br/>Sealion &lsquo;40 features the familiar Panzer Campaigns interface and game scale: one hex represents 1 kilometer and each turn is 2 hours. The main campaign takes place on a 340 x 180 hex map of the south-eastern English coast line, from Ipswich in the north to Weymouth in the south. Hundreds of English hamlets will be the scene of house-to-house fighting as the British people defend their homeland from the invaders.<br/> Sealion &lsquo;40 also features several scenarios specially optimized for Human vs. Human play and others specifically for play against the computer AI. A total of 25 scenarios are included ranging from small 10 turns actions covering a snapshot of the action to the monster 378 full campaign game. The September Sealion CG is based on historical German plans while the July CG with Strategy Operations is less historical but makes for a great play with a lot of variations in the CG and with that replayablity. Gamers can use Normal (AI) play, play by e-mail (PBEM), LAN &amp; Internet &quot;live&quot; play, and two-player hotseat.<br/><br/><br/>"}, "79101": {"statistics": {}, "name": "The Renaissance", "videogamemode": {"2410": "Asynchronous Multiplayer"}, "videogameversion": {"57206": "Windows CD-ROM Edition"}, "average": "0", "videogameseries": {"8049": "Musket & Pike"}, "videogametheme": {"2345": "Historical"}, "usersrated": "0", "videogamegenre": {"2158": "Strategy"}, "videogameplatform": {"4977": "Windows"}, "videogamehonor": {"21212": "2009 Charles S.

The period starts with the French invasion of Italy in 1494 and the armies are still largely Medieval in weaponry and organization.<br/> While firearms and artillery are present on the battlefield they have yet to secure a dominant tactical role. However, by the close of the sixteenth century, traditional missile weapons such as the longbow and crossbow had been supplanted by arquebuses, muskets and pistols, while the proportion of firearms to pike had greatly increased since 1500.<br/><br/>The pike, once the primary infantry weapon for many armies - and often a decisive battle-winner in the hands of professional Swiss and Landsknecht mercenaries - was, by the close of the period retained primarily as a protection against cavalry, a role it continued to perform for another century until the invention of the bayonet made it redundant.<br/> With Renaissance, you can refight the Italian Wars between France and Spain as well as the various Anglo-Scottish battles of the 16th century, or lead Ottoman armies against Persians, Mamelukes and Western Christendom! Experience the pike &amp; shot warfare of the French Wars of Religion and the Dutch Revolt against Spanish rule. These conflicts involve a wide range of different troop types and weaponry, providing a diverse and rewarding gaming experience. <br/> 112 stand alone scenarios and 5 campaigns to choose from with another 115 scenarios specifically for the campaigns<br/> A wide sampling of battles from small to large actions<br/><br/>60 unique maps ranging in size from 480 hexes to 76,800 hexes providing ample ground for scenario designers to create their own actions.<br/><br/>Note that the game disk as shipped does not include a 3d mode, however this is available in all patch downloads off of the HPS Simulations' site.<br/> This title is the first in a new series of games by John Tiller and his team called &quot;Musket &amp; Pike&quot;.

There is a fascinating chapter devoted to Wells the Man and his journey with his &quot;Little Wars&quot; from inception to the day in 1916 when he put the game away for good. For fans of Wells' work, The Padre may surprise you with information you did not know, or could even guess.<br/><br/>Retaining many of Wells' original rules (such as the use of spring-loaded toy cannon), there are now additional rules for Shell Bursts, machine guns, observation balloons and aircraft, field hospitals, supply wagons and dumps, spies, military bands, unit Colors and Standards, Brigade up to Division Commands, hidden movement, skirmishers, snipers, unpredictable effects of terrain, signals, morale, and much more.<br/><br/>Infantry units are a standard 20 figures strong, Cavalry 12, and Artillery can appear as single Guns with crews, or as Batteries of up to three strong. From two to four such units, with a Battery, typically form a Brigade, the perfect command for each Player. Two or more Brigades form a Division, and this is the post for the Player who will act as Commanding Officer for his side.<br/><br/>Each Brigade and the Divisional HQ is represented by a variable number of Staff and ADC's, marching on foot, mounted on prancing steeds, or even seated in Rolls Royce, Cadillac, Renault, or other grand Staff Cars from the Golden Age of Motoring. From these HQ's must come the orders to the units on the firing line, but the traffic isn't all one way! Back to the Brigadiers and the Commanding General, come the reports of the scouts--and the desperate messages from the front lines delivered by Runners, Gallopers, and even Pigeons! There is far more skill than luck required to lead your miniature minions to victory, and the rules provide this without complicated systems. In many respects, there is far less abstraction in Funny Little Wars in the spaces of your garden than there is on the traditional table top.<br/><br/>While designed for yard games, the rules can be played on the floor or table top. Figures used can range from antique and modern &quot;Collectibles,&quot; to readily available plastics. Included are detailed lists for 14 different Armies identified by their &quot;Colors,&quot; (&quot;Army Red,&quot; &quot;Army Black,&quot; &quot;Army Red/Gold,&quot; etc) with complete information on how to build your favorites. Each Army has its unique strengths and weaknesses, and a personality which will definitely suggest its historical counterpart.<br/><br/>Much as Wells' rules did, FLW covers the quarter century prior to WW I, when war was still romantic, the uniforms were dashing, and the Generals still waltzed. This is the very era that gave birth to the Military Pentathalon, and a player may find himself having to excel in one or more of its challenges to deliver a crucial dispatch! Padre Paul's rules reflect the late Victorian and Edwardian spirit in both the substance of the rules and the delightful style of his writing. Designed for &quot;The Better Sort of Chap,&quot; the book contains suggestions for proper Dress during the game, etiquette on the field, and more. Nor are the Ladies and &quot;Girls of the better sort&quot; forgotten. The Padre's Wife, Georgina, provides a charming account of a &quot;proper dinner&quot; served after an especially Gentlemanly game at Dover Castle one recent Summer.<br/><br/>Not only are there the Basic Rules, but many Optional Rules allowing players to set their own levels of play. There are lists of providers of toy soldiers in every price range, as well as all manner of accessories, and recommendations on how to shop inexpensively on the Internet for those items you will not find so readily in the stores. Sections describe how to set up a yard, park, rockery, beach, or other site to be your Battlefield. For once, you WILL have room to perform that wide flanking maneuver! Light Cavalry and Infantry come into their own, screening your forces while trying to detect your enemy's. Once more, War Gaming is as much fun as when any of us discovered the hobby, no matter how many years--or decades!--ago.<br/><br/>Rules for basing figures are flexible and encourage players to work with what is best for their needs. And while comprehensive, there are no complex rules or formulae, and nothing more than traditional six-sided dice are required--besides measuring tapes and a beautiful day under the shade of the trees. Childlike, but never &quot;Childish,&quot; FLW goes back to the Hobby's roots, and even our own as we play once more with the toy soldiers so many us first had as kids.<br/><br/>"}, "79123": {"statistics": {}, "name": "Kingdoms of Germany", "videogamemode": {"2409": "Hotseat"}, "videogameversion": {"57276": "PC 3.5\" version"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic786605.jpg", "videogametheme": {"2345": "Historical"}, "usersrated": "0", "average": "0", "videogamegenre": {"2158": "Strategy"}, "videogameplatform": {"4714": "DOS"}, "poll": {}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic786605_t.jpg", "description": "User Summary<br/><br/>A turn-based war game.<br/><br/>From the back of the box<br/><br/>&quot;Kingdoms of Germany is the second in the KINGDOMS series of medieval conquest games.

The game is normally shown from a third-person perspective  behind Raziel, but players can rotate the viewpoint around him by using the control pad. Gameplay relies largely on shifting between the material and spectral planes  of existence to progress through areas. Although interaction with objects is limited in the spectral realm, this can be advantageous because Raziel can easily traverse water and phase through otherwise impassable gates there. However, blocks, doors, and switches can be manipulated only in the physical realm.  Many puzzles are based on the differences between the two realms; for example, platforms and environment features in one realm may change form to open new paths in the other. Block puzzles  are also common and require the rotation, flipping, and moving of large blocks to progress, often with a time limit and while avoiding enemies.<br/><br/>Combat in Soul Reaver is a hack and slash system, involving the use of combinations of various different attacks before a finishing move. Raziel's enemies are grouped into humans, spectral creatures, and most commonly, vampires. Human enemies include peasants, vampire hunters and vampire worshippers. In the spectral realm, players fight minor enemies called Sluagh and the souls of dead vampires who have become wraiths. Each brood of vampire enemies has unique powers reminiscent of their clan leader. Human and spectral enemies can be killed with Raziel's claws or any weapon, but vampires must be bludgeoned into a stunned state and then destroyed by impaling them, lighting them on fire, or tossing them into a hazard such as sunlight or water. When killed, enemies leave behind souls that replenish Raziel's health, which automatically decreases in the material realm and increases in the spectral. Possession of the Soul Reaver sword stops automatic degeneration of health in the physical realm, but Raziel loses the sword instantly if he sustains damage and can regain it only by restoring his health to full.<br/><br/>At first, Raziel can jump, glide using his torn wings, move blocks, and pick up and throw enemies. Initially unarmed, he fights using his claws, but can alternatively use weapons such as rocks, torches, spears and staffs, and the Soul Reaver. Raziel can freely shift to the spectral realm, but can return to the material realm only through special portals when at full health. Raziel automatically shifts to the spectral realm if he runs out of health. As the game progresses, Raziel becomes able to phase through gates in the spectral realm and climb walls in the material realm. Initially vulnerable to water, he overcomes this weakness and learns to swim. Players can find an ancient relic that gives Raziel the power to fire bolts of telekinetic energy, which cause little damage by themselves but can knock enemies into hazards and push objects from a distance. Baptism in holy flame can transform the Soul Reaver into the Fire Reaver, which can set enemies aflame and adds fire to Raziel's telekinetic bolts. Players can also find magical glyphs that allow Raziel to expend magical energy to attack groups of enemies simultaneously.<br/><br/>"}, "79127": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1081488.jpg", "is_expanded_by": {"156502": {"name": "Star Trek: Fleet Captains \u2013 Dominion"}}, "poll": {}, "boardgamedesigner": {"615": {"name": "Mike Elliott"}}, "statistics": {}, "yearpublished": "2011", "maxplayers": "4", "boardgamepublisher": {"221": {"name": "WizKids"}}, "maxplaytime": "75", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1081488_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "75", "boardgamecategory": {"1046": {"name": "Fighting"}}, "boardgamehonor": {"20116": "2012 Golden Geek Best 2-Player Board Game Nominee"}, "description": "Star Trek: Fleet Captains, designed for two or four players, is set in the &quot;Prime Universe&quot; of STAR TREK (as seen in the various TV series and movies up to Star Trek: Nemesis) and is more adversarial in nature when compared to Star Trek: Expeditions.  Each player takes the role of a faction (or race) from the universe.  In the base game, the choices are Klingons and Federation.  Each faction has a number of ships (on Clix dials similar to the Heroclix line of components) of varying ability and with a corresponding &ldquo;size.&rdquo;  Fleets of ships are drafted to a given size total which reflects the victory points required to win.  Thus, larger fleet sizes lead to higher point (and longer games).<br/><br/>Players then &ldquo;shuffle build&rdquo; a deck of command cards.  Choosing four decks from a set of ten decks per faction.  Each deck has a unique flavor or theme, with corresponding major characters.  For instance the Klingons have a deck themed around larger ships and imperial domination and Gowron is a central character.  The four decks chosen will help to set the player&rsquo;s strategy for winning.<br/>The ships chosen have physical stats like weapons, shields, engines, and sensors. They also have mission totals for science, influence, and combat missions.  These determine the kinds and numbers of each kind of mission cards the player draws to form a mission deck.  Completing missions gains the player points, which will win them the game.   Missions could be as simple as damage an opposing ship that is larger than your own (combat), to as complex as claiming the spaces connecting your command post to your opponents (influence). Thus a player&rsquo;s chosen ships sets the types of missions they will need to earn points and the deck they build determines the way they will complete missions.<br/><br/>Points can also be earned for non-mission actions such as destroying a ship or building a starbase.<br/><br/>The game itself plays out on a randomly built board of hex cards, called sectors that start the game unexplored.  As each ship progresses through the sector, the cards are turned face up, revealing what is in that part of the sector (a Class-M planet, a Class-J Nebula, empty space, etc...). There are additionally random events that can occur when exploring, which usually correspond to a single episode of a series (for instance one encounter is &ldquo;trouble with tribbles.&rdquo; Some of these encounters also give victory points.<br/><br/>Overall, the game can best be thought of as playing out an entire season of Star Trek with the conflict between players representing the major story arc and the turns, missions, and random encounters representing individual episodes.  Players will move their ships, explore space, complete missions, play cards to upgrade their ships (and staff them with famous and not so famous crewmembers), or boost their stats in combat.  Combat, while important, is not the sole path to victory, with the mission cards being the primary factor (some of which will encourage combat).  The style of game will depend heavily on individual player decisions, but no matter what, it will feel like Star Trek.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": {"57287": "English first edition"}, "average": "7.57676", "name": "Star Trek: Fleet Captains", "playingtime": "75", "boardgamemechanic": {"2001": "Action Point Allowance System"}, "age": "14", "boardgameexpansion": {}, "usersrated": "2772", "boardgamesubdomain": {"5497": "Strategy Games"}, "boardgamefamily": {"18459": "Clix"}}, "79128": {"statistics": {}, "name": "Star Trek: Deep Space Nine \u2013 Harbinger", "videogamemode": {"2149": "Single-Player"}, "videogameversion": {"57288": "English/French/German/Italian/French DOS edition"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1715783.jpg", "videogametheme": {"2355": "Detective / Mystery"}, "videogamefranchise": {"5236": "Star Trek"}, "videogamecharacter": {"30662": "Benjamin Sisko"}, "average": "8.25", "videogamegenre": {"2152": "Adventure"}, "videogameplatform": {"4714": "DOS"}, "usersrated": "2", "poll": {}, "vgcharacterversion": {"293802": "Captain Sisko"}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1715783_t.jpg", "description": "From the CD Case<br/><br/>A powerful plasma storm has rocked Deep Space Nine and a Federation diplomat has been murdered.

Despite its name, it has no relation to the 1969 film but is set in the Wild West. The title refers to a fictitious gang of outlaws featured in the game, loosely based on the real Wild Bunch gang who were prominent in the 1890s.<br/><br/>The Wild Bunch is a text-based adventure game, with limited use of graphics. The player controls a protagonist who finds a dying man who was attacked by a member of the Wild Bunch gang. Before dying he describes the culprit and gives you his colt 45, just as the local sherriff arrives on the scene. You are assumed to be the murderer and the sherriff tries to arrest you but you escape. The object of the game is to prove your innocence by tracking down the real murderer and handing him over to the law. Along the way you can also arrest and hand in other members of the gang, whose descriptions you obtain from wanted posters. Scoring is based on the money you earn from rewards, gambling at poker or find as gold nuggets while travelling. The game ends if you die due to your strength reaching zero, you are killed in a gunfight or are arrested. It is, however, won by successfully tracing, identifying and handing in the real murderer, which usually involves killing him in a gunfight.<br/><br/>At the start of the game, the player can choose to start off in one of five towns. Each town has a number of premises which you can visit to obtain information about the Wild Bunch gang and how to avoid being arrested yourself. The player can also earn money by playing poker, increase their strength by drinking in the saloon bar or buy items of use in the store. The player can travel between towns (journey time is reduced by buying a horse and saddle). When travelling, food and water are consumed on a daily basis and each day the player runs a risk of encountering enemies which must be dealt with by fleeing, fighting or bribing them.

Instead of the familiar depiction of White Bomber, the characters in this game resemble mechanical cyborgs  based on the original game's boxart. The player can choose between a male or female Bomberman, as well as his or her armor color.<br/><br/>Act Zero is the traditional 2D styled gameplay that the Bomberman  series is known for. One of the few changes in the game is FPB mode (first person battle). Despite the title, the game mode plays in a 3rd person perspective, where the player is given control of the camera which follows the character being played. The player still has the option of playing on standard mode, which sets the camera to an overhead view like other various 2D bomberman titles.<br/><br/>The game also features a life meter in the FPB mode which depletes if the player is hit by a blast. The player can take multiple hits from the same explosion if the blast lingers for a while. Players can collect various power ups which allows them to lay more bombs, have stronger and longer blasts, and can give the player higher speeds. The standard mode still operates on a one-hit death rule, with each hit depleting a single Heart item or killing the player.<br/><br/>The single player campaign contains both FPB and standard modes with a total of 99 levels. The player has no option to save in between levels unless they are connected online, and if the player dies, they must restart at the beginning, making it the most challenging single player experience for a Bomberman game. The game features an online battle mode called world battle which supports up to 8 players at once on Xbox live.

Missions require speed, quick judgement or pinpoint accuracy.<br/><br/>The game consists of non-violent, all ages, shooting contests like shooting targets (and avoiding bombs), shooting cardboard targets, shooting the target of player color, protecting the iconic Dr. Don and Dr. Dan, and other miscellaneous challenges.<br/>The player chooses the desired difficulty level which will determine how many stages must be finished to complete the game in order to finish, as well as their overall difficulty. Players are shown four missions in each grouping, and may attempt them in any order. Players have only three lives for the entire game. Players can lose lives by:-<br/><br/>- Failing to complete a mission in the time limit<br/>- Shooting a bomb (a black ball with skull and fuse)<br/>- Letting Dr. Dan or Dr. Don die in any mission where the player must protect them<br/>- Incorrectly answering questions by shooting wrong answers<br/>- Shooting a cardboard civilian<br/>- Shooting the opposite targets<br/><br/>Point Blank was originally created for the arcades in 1994 but a console version was later for the PlayStation in 1997, this version included an arrange mode which added an alternate version of Arcade mode, as well as adding many gameplay modes alongside an RPG mode titled Quest.<br/><br/>At the 2006 Game Developers Conference in San Jose, CA a Nintendo DS port of the game was announced. The console's stylus and touch screen is used in place of the light gun.

The main objective of the game is to collect keys which unlock the level exits, as well as coins and jewels along the way.<br/><br/>Various elements and obstacles are introduced as one moves on to new levels, which means that the complexity and level of puzzle solving required gradually increases as the game progresses. The game involves making ingenious use of the various types of platforms and surrounding objects, from moving platforms and transporters to bouncing platforms and jumping pills.<br/><br/>Bonus levels can be unlocked by gathering five fruits (one available in each stage). If one enters a bonus level, the word &quot;BONUS&quot; appears. Completing the bonus stage requires one to 'activate' all the cubes on all platforms by rolling over them. The bonus stages also become more complex as the game progresses.<br/><br/>Points are awarded when the player collects keys, treasures, and fruits and also when they complete levels. Points are deducted if the Kula ball is spiked, captured, melt, burnt by laser, or falls/slides off or simply runs out of time, all of which require the player to restart the level - providing the score has not fallen below zero, in which case, the game ends.<br/><br/>A two-player mode is available, with two variations of the game. A time trial and a version called &quot;copycat&quot;. In the time trial the players take turns to determine who can complete each stage in the quickest time possible. The &quot;copycat&quot; version is a kind of memory tester. It involves one player starting off making two moves, and the next player then copies those moves and adds two of their own. The first player then has to copy all of the moves so far and add two more moves at the end. This continues until one of the player makes a mistake, after which the opponent is awarded a point. A move constitutes either changing direction, moving forward or jumping (either on the spot/forwards or onto another platform).<br/><br/>This was one of the first games to make use of the DualShock vibration function of the original PlayStation game controllers, which induces the feel of the ground breaking, the feeling of the Kula ball about to burst, or the shock of getting suddenly captured or spiked.<br/><br/>Kula World was also extremely popular when released, which made acquiring it quite difficult. Ordinary copies can cost over &pound;60 due to its rarity. Sony announced Kula World for download to PlayStation 3 via Playstation Store priced at &pound;3.49, which was released on November 29, 2007.<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, Kula World , available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "79157": {"statistics": {}, "name": "Wrath of the Black Manta", "videogamemode": {"2149": "Single-Player"}, "videogameversion": {"57364": "European NES Edition"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic784688.jpg", "videogametheme": {"2495": "Ninjas"}, "usersrated": "5", "average": "5.4", "videogamegenre": {"2147": "Action"}, "videogameplatform": {"4430": "NES"}, "poll": {}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic784688_t.jpg", "description": "&quot;Wrath of the Black Manta, known in Japan as Ninja Cop Saizou (\u5fcd\u8005COP \u30b5\u30a4\u30be\u30a6), is a 1989 action platform game for the Nintendo Entertainment System developed by A.I and published by Kyugo in 1989 in Japan and later by Taito in North America in 1990 and in Europe in 1991.<br/><br/>This side scrolling action game has the player control a ninja who has to save the kidnapped children.<br/><br/>In the game, the player goes through five levels, using throwing stars and special ninjutsu abilities called the &quot;ninja arts&quot;, to stop a gang and the evil mastermind behind a slew of kidnappings, El Toro. One of the kidnapped is a student of the Black Manta's sensei, Taro.<br/><br/>The Black Manta has many powers, which he gets after beating a level. The player can choose which power to use by pressing start. These powers can help the Black Manta defeat enemies and bosses more quickly. The Black Manta can save kidnapped children hidden throughout each level, however, it plays no role in completing the game and does not warrant any kind of special bonus.<br/><br/>Part of the last level is seen through a first person perspective. Towards the end of this stage, the Black Manta has to defeat one of the bosses from the previous levels before he goes face-to-face with El Toro himself.<br/><br/>Before Wrath of the Black Manta was released to the U.S. and Europe, it was known in Japan as Ninja Cop Saizou, with several notable differences.<br/><br/>Graphically, many of the sprites and artwork were altered between versions. All of the cut scenes in Ninja Cop Saizou are different from those used in Black Manta. The graphics in these scenes are more in the style of anime or manga than the more realistic graphics used in the U.S. and Europe games. Tiny, the boss of the first stage, is also different in both versions, with the Ninja Cop version of him being more in the style of anime and manga and is a little more animated than the Black Manta versions. The Japanese game also has him shoot a projectile from his fists, where the other versions do not. The Rio de Janeiro stage on the Japanese game has a boss creature made of electricity, where in Black Manta the boss is replaced with the Voodoo warrior. The backgrounds for these boss fights are different in both versions. Finally, the sprites used for jumping upward are different in both versions. The Japanese game's sprite is drawn to show speed lines rather than the Manta's feet while jumping upwards.<br/><br/>There are six stages in Ninja Cop Saizou where Wrath of the Black Manta only has five. The second stage in Ninja Cop is completely removed from Black Manta. This Japanese exclusive stage also has a floating eyeball boss that isn't in Black Manta. In the final stage of the game there are also a couple alterations. In the Japanese game, you must take on all of the bosses from the previous levels, where in Black Manta, you only have to take on one of them. The final boss is also completely different in both games. In Black Manta, the player only has to fight a character named El Toro using four of the ninja arts. In Ninja Cop, the player has to take on a space ship which drops a variety of enemies from the game. After that, the games final boss transforms into an alien, which the player must fight normally, unlike having to use ninja arts like in Black Manta.<br/><br/>In addition to all of these aforementioned changes, both games have completely different soundtracks. Lastly, many of the ninja arts are learned in a different order between each game.&quot;<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, Wrath of the Black Manta , available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "79158": {"statistics": {}, "name": "Campaign Austerlitz", "videogamemode": {"2410": "Asynchronous Multiplayer"}, "videogameversion": {"57365": "CD-Rom Edition"}, "average": "0", "videogameseries": {"6938": "Napoleonic Battles"}, "videogametheme": {"2345": "Historical"}, "usersrated": "0", "videogamegenre": {"2158": "Strategy"}, "videogameplatform": {"4977": "Windows"}, "videogamehonor": {"21212": "2009 Charles S.

The player simply chooses a transmission type, qualifies, and race. The player must qualify in under 45 seconds in the shortened track in order to actually race. If he fails, the game ends (though, in the home versions, even if the player fails to qualify, he still starts off the race at the last position). When in the race itself, there is also a position limit, which starts off on 20th (15th in the home versions) and decreases as the player bypasses checkpoints along the track, ultimately stopping on 3rd. If the player falls behind the indicated position and does not manage to recover fast enough, a game over happens.<br/><br/>The Sega Mega Drive/Genesis version of Super Monaco GP adds a World Championship mode. In the World Championship mode, the goal is to win a season of races, and then go on to defend the title. The circuits are modeled on the ones used in the 1989 Formula One season, with background scenery similar to the real-world circuit venues, though without the wealth of details the Arcade version had.<br/><br/>The Genesis version was highly acclaimed, garnering an at-the-time-unprecedented 10-10-9-9 rating from Electronic Gaming Monthly's Review Crew and a 93% from Mean Machines.<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, Super Monaco GP , available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "79170": {"statistics": {}, "name": "The War of 1812: The Conquest of Canada", "videogamemode": {"2410": "Asynchronous Multiplayer"}, "videogameversion": {"57388": "CD-Rom Edition"}, "average": "7", "videogameseries": {"8047": "Early American Wars"}, "videogametheme": {"2345": "Historical"}, "usersrated": "1", "videogamegenre": {"2158": "Strategy"}, "videogameplatform": {"4977": "Windows"}, "poll": {}, "description": "From the Publisher Website<br/><br/>The War of 1812 is a tactical/operational level game covering the major battles of the War of 1812 from the pre-war Battle of Tippecanoe to the post-war Battle of New Orleans.

Bounce across the arroyos at Buena Vista on the seat of a caisson in a battery commanded by Captain Braxton Bragg, or ride with the US Dragoons alongside Dick Ewell, back in the days when he still had hair. Mexican-American War is a grand tactical level simulation of this conflict using the Early American Wars engine.<br/><br/>The war with Mexico presents some fascinating parallels and contrasts with our current history. Mexico in 1846 had a standing army of about 35,000 men, while the Regular Army of the United States mustered only about 7,000 soldiers, with most of them scattered across the western borders of the country, protecting settlers and battling Indians. Employing advanced tactics and superior technology, especially that of the artillery, the US prevailed. Luck, boldness, and skill had something to do with it, too.<br/> You have an opportunity with this game to rewrite the history of a forgotten war, fought in 1846 and 1847 between The United States of America and the nation of Mexico. In scope, in the sweeping panorama of deserts and mountains, from lush California to Mexico City's verdant basin, it is unrivaled in the Western Hemisphere, even by the American Civil War which began only fifteen years later. From Texas to the Pacific, from Northern California to Central Mexico, battles, skirmishes - and diplomacy - over a period of two years determined the ultimate outline of the continental United States as we know it today. You will also do battle in a conflict only slightly better known to Americans - the Texas War of Independence, fought in 1835-36.

It is also available on the Wii Virtual Console in North America on May 31, 2010 and in the PAL region on August 13, 2010.<br/><br/>The game's setting is that of the Wild West but various science fiction elements are present; most notably robots, who serve as most of the bosses in the game. This mixture is a prime example of the Steampunk genre.<br/><br/>The objective is to seek revenge against a murderous gang that killed the family member of one of the playable characters. The female character, Annie, has searched down a bounty hunter by the name of Clint to help her get revenge and to rescue the few family members she has left. The player or players navigate through several different levels fighting everything from towering machines to armored trains.<br/><br/>The game employs a third-person, fixed viewpoint and is primarily about shooting, similar to Cabal. The player controls the movement of both the on-screen character and the targeting reticule with the directional pad. While shooting, the character stands still. Various maneuvers, such as jumping, double jumping and dodge-rolls are possible. Beyond the standard gun several other weapons are obtainable, such as a gatling gun, shotgun, or a grenade launcher though these hold only limited ammunition. As is common in shooter games, the player has access to a number of screen-clearing bombs.<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, Wild Guns , available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "79185": {"boardgamedesigner": {"38195": {"name": "Richard Morris (II)"}}, "average": "7", "poll": {}, "name": "Snark", "playingtime": "60", "minplayers": "3", "boardgamemechanic": {"2012": "Auction/Bidding"}, "yearpublished": "2010", "usersrated": "1", "maxplayers": "8", "boardgameartist": {"23771": "Chen Changcai"}, "statistics": {}, "boardgamepublisher": {"1001": {"name": "(Web published)"}}, "boardgameversion": {"57422": "Print and Play edition"}, "maxplaytime": "60", "boardgamecategory": {"1002": {"name": "Card Game"}}, "age": "10", "minplaytime": "60", "description": "A set collecting deck-building auction game, using the Rainbow Deck.

The game features firefighters in realistic situations saving civilians in burning buildings, mining incidents, and industrial accidents.<br/><br/>The game is a 2D adventure where the player controls a firefighter through emergency situations in differing locations. Each level consists of multiple rooms, areas, or building floors where players can possibly explore, extinguish fires, and rescue people. Most levels dictate a specific number of people that must be saved within a set time limit for the mission to be considered a success. Fire spreads throughout an area automatically, and the player can be injured when touching a patch of fire on screen. The player can also be harmed by falling through holes in the floor.<br/><br/>The player has various tools of firefighting at their disposal. Before a level begins, the player may choose the primary and secondary equipment they wish to begin the level with. Only one of each type of equipment can be equipped at once. Primary equipment consists of an oxygen mask and tank and three types of fire extinguishers that correspond to the different types of fires that can be encountered in the game; regular, chemical, and electrical. These fires and their extinguishers are red-orange, green, and blue, respectively. As these are used, a counter goes from 99 to 0. The counter of the regular extinguisher rapidly increases back to 99 after a brief period of inactivity, while the oxygen tank and mask and the other extinguishers can only go back to 99 after being resupplied by allies in the level. Secondary equipment consists of a trusty fireman's axe, a rope for crossing gaps, a metal pole to reveal holes by checking for weak places in the floor, plastic explosives to blow through debris and certain wall sections, and CO2 bombs to extinguish large areas of fire. Only five plastic explosives and CO2 bombs can be carried at one time and can be replenished by an ally on the map.&quot;<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, The Ignition Factor , available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "79237": {"statistics": {}, "name": "Far East of Eden: Zero", "videogamemode": {"2149": "Single-Player"}, "videogameversion": {"57506": "Japanese SNES Edition"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic796471.jpg", "videogameseries": {"7457": "Far East of Eden"}, "videogametheme": {"2148": "Fantasy"}, "usersrated": "0", "average": "0", "videogamegenre": {"2155": "RPG"}, "videogameplatform": {"4440": "SNES"}, "poll": {}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic796471_t.jpg", "description": "User Summary<br/><br/>A role playing game set in Jipang, a fantasy world based on feudal Japan.<br/><br/>"}, "79238": {"statistics": {}, "name": "Syvalion", "videogamemode": {"2422": "Local Multiplayer"}, "videogameversion": {"57507": "Japanese Super Famicom edition"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1562481.png", "videogametheme": {"2148": "Fantasy"}, "usersrated": "0", "average": "0", "videogamegenre": {"2505": "Shoot 'em Up"}, "videogameplatform": {"4781": "Arcade"}, "poll": {}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1562481_t.png", "description": "&quot;Syvalion\u200b (\u30b5\u30a4\u30d0\u30ea\u30aa\u30f3) is an arcade video game released by Taito in 1988.

Each map has at least two bases - one for green team, and one for the yellow team. Initially, the base locations were hidden from the players, so an extensive search of the landscape had to be conducted first.<br/><br/>Each base had several different types of buildings, such as armories, barracks, and bio-domes. The objective is to capture the flag from inside the enemy base by blasting through walls and destroying any defenses. You could also rescue prisoners of war by destroying the POW camps that were scattered throughout the enemy base. Destroying the camps would allow the captives to hop in your tank for a ride back to your base.

In the years since, the Sarafan have imposed harsh martial law on Nosgoth's human population, and started an industrial revolution.

It is technically a port of the critically acclaimed Sandbox Survival Horror Dead Rising, although Chop Till You Drop features so many changes from the original version it can be considered a unique game in its own right!<br/><br/>Just like in the original game you take the role of Frank West, a freelance journalist who finds himself in the middle of a Zombie outbreak in the small fictional suburban town of Willamette. Frank lands on the roof of the town's shopping complex by helicopter, but upon realising what has happened decides to stay there for the duration of the game in order to help the survivors stuck inside and uncover the truth behind the outbreak.<br/><br/>In Chop Till You Drop you must navigate around a Sandbox style shopping mall environment rescuing survivors, collecting supplies such as weapons, ammo and food (health), and fighting through hordes of zombies. Occasionally you will also have to kill homicidal humans driven to psychosis by the outbreak.<br/><br/>Chop Till You Drop is a major overhaul of the original Dead Rising, with various aspects changed, removed, added and altered.<br/><br/>Unlike in the original, Chop Till You Drop features a much more structured set up. Rather then having just 72 hours in which to achieve all goals and plot points players are given all the goals as separately timed missions. The player can choose when to attempt them and sometimes in what order. Also because it is impossible to miss any of the plot related 'case' missions the bonus part of the original game (known as 'Overtime') is merged into this game as standard. The player is normally not timed at all when on a case mission, meaning they will have several opportunities during the game to explore the mall freely without time constraints.<br/><br/>One of the other major changes between the two is the removal of Frank's ability to take pictures. Players could originally take photos and score exp. for certain content caught on film, but this function doesn't exist at all in Chop Till You Drop.<br/><br/>Other changes include different graphics, no longer being able to jump, a stronger emphasis on using Guns (with a Resident Evil 4 shooting style utilising the Wii remote), less variety of items, the removal of some areas, psychos and survivors, and new bonus Mini-games unlocked by completing the main game.<br/><br/>Due to a smaller budget and development period coupled with the Wii's lower graphical capabilities less Zombies appear on screen then in the original (with no more then 100 been visible at one time). Despite this Chop Till You Drop features several new types of Zombie not seen in the original game. Three psychos that were removed from Chop Till You Drop make recurring appearances as special Zombies instead. This game also features Zombie Animals and players must contend with Zombie Poodles and Parrots amongst the regular human Zombies.<br/><br/>"}, "79260": {"videogame": {"101756": "The Quake Collection"}, "statistics": {}, "name": "Quake III: Team Arena", "videogamemode": {"2310": "Network Multiplayer"}, "videogameversion": {"57567": "PC/CD-ROM Version"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic787483.jpg", "videogameseries": {"4762": "Quake"}, "videogametheme": {"2264": "Science Fiction"}, "usersrated": "16", "videogameexpansion": {"77630": "Quake III: Arena"}, "average": "7.25", "videogamegenre": {"2160": "First Person Shooter"}, "videogameplatform": {"4977": "Windows"}, "poll": {}, "videogamecompilation": {"101756": "The Quake Collection"}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic787483_t.jpg", "description": "From back of box:<br/><br/>Never before have the forces aligned.

It was developed by Image Works from 1989.  Its box featured artwork by Chris Achilleos.<br/><br/>The plotline identifies the player as a champion of Trazere who, after recruiting up to three fellow champions, travels through dungeons and mazes fighting creatures along the way to find and destroy the evil Zendick, and banish the Lord of Entropy.<br/><br/>Gameplay:<br/>All of the champions fall into the four classes of Warrior, Mage, Adventurer or Thief, each with their own particular capability. Within each class there are four characters available, each with their own colour of Red, Blue, Green or Yellow. Each colour also has its own particular advantage, largely with respect to the families of spells the character will be most adept at casting and developing. However, that colour is also important when it comes to matching up coloured rings later in the game to magnify the effects of spell-casting.<br/><br/>One particularly memorable quirk of the game is the ability granted to players to hold simple conversations with traders, other champions, and even enemies during combat. Stock pseudo-medieval phrases such as &quot;Truly my courage is remarkable&quot; and &quot;Begone, thou oaf&quot; are selected using a menu, and can be used in combination to flatter a desired companion, aggravate an enemy, or lower the price of an item which the player wishes to purchase. Many gameplayers have found that the price of a long sword (RRP 10 gold pieces) can fall to as little as 6 or 7 after the shopkeeper has been buttered-up with phrases such as &quot;Thou seems fine&quot; - particularly when this strategy is used in conjunction with the Beguile spell (most effectively cast by Megrim).<br/><br/>Bloodwych is also remarkable for the sheer scale of its maps. Gameplay can easily last weeks until the player eventually navigates his way though mazes and past monsters to the start of the enormous and fiendish &quot;towers&quot;, in which the gameplay becomes focused on the task of collecting crystals, with a view to destroying Zendick and his associates.<br/><br/>Similar games of the time included Eye of the Beholder and Dungeon Master.<br/><br/>"}, "79278": {"statistics": {}, "name": "Devil's Crown", "videogamemode": {"2149": "Single-Player"}, "videogameversion": {"57619": "Amstrad CPC version"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic788302.jpg", "videogametheme": {"2148": "Fantasy"}, "usersrated": "1", "average": "4", "videogamegenre": {"2147": "Action"}, "videogameplatform": {"5203": "Amstrad CPC"}, "poll": {}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic788302_t.jpg", "description": "&quot;'...as the pirates slowly remove the Sparkling Stones they feel a cold eerie wind pass through their hair.

It is a fishing game played with a Baraja, a pack of 40 Spanish playing cards. The game can also be played with the standard 52 card pack of Anglo-American playing cards, but all 10s, 9s and 8s are omitted (ace is low).<br/><br/>Cuarenta is Spanish for the number 40. This refers to the number of points that are required to win a chica (small division of the game) and also to the number of cards used to play it. Two chicas or the first chica with zapater&iacute;a (loss of the chica by scoring less than ten points) win the game (a completed game is called a &quot;mesa&quot;, which means &quot;match&quot;). The game can be played by 2 players, or 4 players split into two teams.<br/><br/>Five cards are dealt to each player, given out as a batch of five cards at a time. Each player plays one card face up onto the table. Cards on the table may be captured by the opponent. If cards are captured, they are placed face down in front of the player or his teammate. Played cards remain on the table until they are captured or the round ends.<br/><br/>Cards can be captured in the following three ways: matching (card same rank as on the table; player places matching card onto own pile), addition  (two cards add to the value of the other; a 2 and a 4 can be captured by a 6; an ace, a 2 and a 4 can be captured by a 7; cards with pictures have no value and cannot be captured this way), and sequence (a card captured by matching or addition entitles the picking of the next higher card; matching a 2 entitles the capturing of the 3 and 4 (etc.), as well, should there be any).<br/><br/>If a player clears the table by capturing all cards, they score a limpia. If a player captures the card just played by the player before, this is called a ca&iacute;da. In either case, the player scores 2 points.<br/><br/>Before the first individual turn after each deal, special announcements have to be made by each player if applicable. These are the doble ronda (four cards of the same rank) and the ronda (three cards of the same rank). A doble ronda  automatically wins the game; a ronda scores two points. After all five cards are played, there is a new deal. After all cards have been played (2 deals with 4 players, 4 deals with 2 players), each player or team counts their collected cards. If the number of collected cards is 20, 6 points are scored; an additional point is given for each captured card in excess of 20, rounded to the next even number.<br/><br/>A chica is won when a player or team reaches 40 points. The game is won when a player or a team wins two chicas or when the opponent doesn't reach ten points at the end of the first chica.<br/><br/>"}, "79281": {"statistics": {}, "name": "Tom Clancy's Ghost Recon: Jungle Storm", "videogamemode": {"2310": "Network Multiplayer"}, "videogameversion": {"57624": "English n-gage version"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic798113.jpg", "videogameseries": {"5915": "Tom Clancy's Ghost Recon"}, "videogametheme": {"2317": "War - Modern"}, "videogamefranchise": {"5922": "Tom Clancy"}, "average": "5", "videogamegenre": {"2167": "Shooter"}, "videogameplatform": {"4744": "N-Gage"}, "usersrated": "1", "poll": {}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic798113_t.jpg", "description": "Taking place just after Island Thunder the Jungle Storm campaign is set in Bogot&aacute;, Colombia, the drug cartel that had aided and financed the FDG in their efforts in Cuba, the FARC, has initiated a number of terrorist  attacks against the Colombian government who has allied themselves with America. After Colombia's call for help following an attack on a U.S. Embassy, America responds by deploying the Ghosts to restore order and put the cartel out of business. Once deployed, the Ghosts mobilize to face off with a newly-formed militia group called the MFLC (Movimiento de las Fuerzas Libres Colombianas), which is basically the southern equivalent of the FARC. The chaos caused by the MFLC is spreading into Ecuador and Peru, making the peacekeeping effort especially vital. Throughout the campaign, the Ghosts hunt down several of the MFLC's leaders, defend civilian centers spread throughout the region, free civilian prisoners, and cut off the flow of drugs in order to deny the MFLC financial backing. Although the Ghosts cause massive damage to the MFLC's war efforts, the MFLC and the FARC have connections to sleeper cells holed up in democratic Cuba. Unless they are told to hold back their use of force by their commanders in Colombia, they will cause widespread damage to Cuba and its populace. To prevent this senseless act of violence, the Ghosts assault the last major MFLC campsite in the hills, which surrounds a large radio tower. With the help of U.N. peacekeepers and captured personnel at the tower, the Ghosts shut down the sleeper cells in Cuba, paving the way for them to strike at the heart of the MFLC and ending their rebellion permanently. The game goes into little detail as to what happens after the MFLC are defeated, but supposedly their defeat shuts down the rebellion put up by the other rebel factions and the FARC across Colombia.<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, Tom Clancy's Ghost Recon: Jungle Storm , available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "79282": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic799335.jpg", "is_expanded_by": {"85988": {"name": "Era Of Inventions: The Golden Goal"}}, "poll": {}, "boardgamedesigner": {"40638": {"name": "Anthony Daamen"}}, "statistics": {}, "yearpublished": "2010", "maxplayers": "5", "boardgameartist": {"40634": "Hans Janssen"}, "boardgamepublisher": {"3490": {"name": "HUCH!"}}, "maxplaytime": "90", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic799335_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "90", "boardgamecategory": {"1088": {"name": "Industry / Manufacturing"}}, "description": "From rules:<br/>Explore the lives and minds of Alexander Graham Bell, Karl Benz, the Wright brothers and other pioneers of invention and experience the thrill of the industrial revolution.

There have been quite a few clone systems made in recent years, but the difference with this one is that it plays American, European, and Japanese games and has the highest compatibility over any other clone system. Another notable difference is that S-video is now compatible when playing SNES games and it makes the games look noticeably better. The console is not licensed by Nintendo and is not fully compatible with every game released for the two game systems, however the majority of games will function properly. While it has only been released in Canada and the United States, it can still be used in Europe and Japan with a power plug adapter. The console is compatible with official and third party SNES controllers. The console can be purchased on many online stores, such as ThinkGeek.<br/><br/>Reviews of the Retro Duo have praised its compatibility for games many other clone consoles struggle with (due to hardware issues) such as Castlevania III: Dracula's Curse on the NES, Star Fox on the SNES, and the Game Genie cheat cartridge.

For decades peace, freedom, and the rule of law in galaxy Cobra 2 have been enforced by the United Planets Freedom Forces. The United Planets Ship, the Avalon 1, is drifting through the outer reaches of the known universe. Colonel Ardon C. Striker and his crew are preparing for the final passage through the barrier of the galaxy.<br/><br/>Suddenly, a huge battlecruiser materializes in close proximity of the Avalon 1. The crew hurry to take up their battle stations amid the sounding of the alert sirens. The automated defence systems of the ship activate, the anti-radiation shields surround the ship and finally the weapon systems are armed. Somehow, with some unknown technology, the enemy battlecruiser, with a flash of blinding light, neutralizes every defence system on the Avalon 1. The sound of an explosion fills the air as an airlock of the ship disintegrates and mutants begin to pour through. The crew fight desperately to save their ship with their phasers and dozens of the invaders fall to death, but they press forward their attack and the crew of the Avalon 1 start to fall down while desperately engaging them in hand-to-hand fighting. One of the Avalon 1 soldiers, Bren McGuire, with tears in his eyes, fires the last of his phaser bolts, downing a mutant and diving to the ground as a chunk of structure falls from above.<br/><br/>After a intense fight that wipes out all tripulants of the ship, there is silence as the evil emperor known as The Machine, half man half robot, enters the airlock and commands his mutants back to the battle cruiser. The Machine surveys the carnage, steps forward and comes to halt with one foot on the prone body of Bren McGuire. &quot;Excellent&quot;, he says to himself, &quot;the crew of Avalon 1 are no more&quot;. Then, without any further hesitation, he turns and leaves the ship. Bren McGuire lays still until he is certain that he is alone on the ravaged ship. Realizing that he is the only left to combat the evil of the invaders and restore peace and freedom to the galaxy, he gets up and hurries to the equipment room. There, Bren sights the new Turrican fighting suits, which are built of the most advanced technology known to mankind. Climbing into the suit, one last cry is heard from him: &quot;Revenge!&quot;<br/><br/>Gameplay:<br/><br/>Turrican II can be described as a cross between Metroid  and Psycho-Nics Oscar.  While the huge detailed labyrinth levels and the morph-ball function were inspired by Metroid, the overall graphics design and weapons were inspired by Psycho-Nics Oscar.<br/><br/>The game is divided into five distinct &quot;worlds&quot; each with its own themed music provided by Chris Huelsbeck, plus a final showdown with the Boss known as &quot;The Machine&quot;. There is a music menu accessible by pressing the Space-Bar (AMIGA version), where all the ingame music is available to be listened to. The music to Turrican II is widely regarded as one of Huelsbecks best compositions, and it was performed live by a full orchestra at the second Symphonic Game Music Concert in 2004.<br/><br/>Individual credits:<br/>Chris Huelsbeck: Music<br/><br/>"}, "79287": {"boardgamedesigner": {"3": {"name": "(Uncredited)"}}, "poll": {}, "name": "Assideum", "playingtime": "60", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": {"2080": "Area Control / Area Influence"}, "yearpublished": "1991", "usersrated": "2", "maxplayers": "2", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1022672_t.jpg", "average": "4.5", "statistics": {}, "boardgamepublisher": {"4": {"name": "(Self-Published)"}}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1022672.jpg", "boardgameversion": {"57667": "First edition with pewter game pieces"}, "maxplaytime": "60", "boardgamecategory": {"1009": {"name": "Abstract Strategy"}}, "age": "8", "minplaytime": "60", "description": "From the box:<br/><br/>Welcome to a world of the Imagination<br/>Where subtle, yet cunning decisions pave the way to Victory<br/><br/>In this time of peril, your most trusted and elite Forces have heard your call to Battle.

Chaos Strikes Back was released in 1989[1] and is also available on several platforms (including Atari ST, Amiga, X68000, PC-98, FM Towns and PC). It uses the same engine as Dungeon Master, with new graphics and creatures.<br/><br/>Whereas the first game saw the player following a fairly linear path through the adventure, with the completion of each flat level marked by a staircase leading down onto a new slightly harder level below, Chaos Strikes Back features a choice of paths which twist back and forth over all levels. The puzzles are far more convoluted, often demanding quick mastery of the control system to deal with intense combat, along with brain vexing riddles and room layouts.<br/><br/>The game is therefore pitched at a much higher difficulty level than its predecessor. The player can choose from a selection of moderately high-level characters or can import characters from a Dungeon Master saved game. In an indication of the game's uncompromising toughness, the player's very first task is to get out of a dark, enclosed room filled with ferociously toothed man-eating giant worms. The game is made a little easier by the inclusion of a separate program which dispenses cryptic hints based on the player's current saved game.<br/><br/>The player's task is to collect four pieces of corbum, a magical material from which the eponymous Lord Chaos draws his power. This requires the traversing of four separate paths each leading to a piece of corbamite and each themed around one of the disciplines open to characters in the game. These disciplines are fighter, wizard, priest and ninja (as with many role-playing computer games of this period, a great though unacknowledged debt was owed to Dungeons and Dragons, of which Chaos Strikes Back has plenty of both).<br/><br/>"}, "79292": {"statistics": {}, "name": "Bio Miracle Bokutte Upa", "videogamemode": {"2149": "Single-Player"}, "videogameversion": {"57673": "Famicom Disk System Japanese edition"}, "average": "0", "videogametheme": {"2337": "Cute Fantasy"}, "usersrated": "0", "videogamegenre": {"2164": "Platform"}, "videogameplatform": {"4430": "NES"}, "poll": {}, "description": "Upa is the prince of a magical kingdom and the most recent in a line of brave fighters.

And so, in order to save his kingdom, Upa crawls into action...<br/><br/>Bio Miracle Bokutte Upa's main character is a baby called Upa that uses a rattle to attack his enemies. When injured by the rattle, the enemy inflates and floats away. These inflated enemies can then be used as temporary floating platforms to climb to higher places or they can also be used as weapons if pushed in any direction. If used as a platform, Upa must not stay on top for too long or otherwise it will explode. But if used as a weapon, Upa has to pounce or use his rattle on the inflated enemy to cause it to careen. The enemy will then ricochet off objects and potentially cause damage to both the protagonist and other enemies if it comes in contact with them.<br/><br/>The game uses a health meter to monitor the player's remaining life which can be replenished by obtaining bottles of milk scattered throughout the levels. A heart icon can also be obtained, increasing the maximum health by one unit for the duration of the current world.<br/><br/>Most items, including the milk bottles and hearts, can be collected by striking special blocks which feature Upa's face. Other items include: Apples, which increase the player's score; hourglasses, which temporarily freeze enemies in place; bells, which give Upa temporary invincibility and the ability to run; and scorpion blocks, which kills all enemies on screen when it is pushed off a platform and hits the ground.<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, Bio Miracle Bokutte Upa , available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "79294": {"statistics": {}, "name": "Urban Champion", "videogamemode": {"2422": "Local Multiplayer"}, "videogameversion": {"57685": "European NES edition"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1213383.png", "videogametheme": {"2466": "Other"}, "videogamefranchise": {"28200": "NES Black Box (1980s NES Games, US)"}, "average": "3.85714", "videogamegenre": {"2159": "Fighting"}, "videogameplatform": {"4430": "NES"}, "usersrated": "7", "poll": {}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1213383_t.png", "description": "The purpose of the game is to knock the other player into a sewer manhole.

It was designed and developed by Zippo Games for Rare and released in the US by Tradewest in 1990, and in Europe by Nintendo, for the NES. It was later released by Nintendo for their NES-based Play Choice 10 arcade system.<br/><br/>Solar Jetman has twelve planets and one hidden planet, each with its own gravity and system of enemy-infested caverns. The goal is to navigate these caves with small jetpods launched from an immobile mothership, on each world bringing back a piece of the warpship and enough fuel to journey to the next one. Items are collected with a tractor beam/tow cable that makes flight more difficult, and released over the mothership or deposited in small wormholes deeper in the caverns. Points are earned by retrieving valuables and destroying enemies, and can be spent after every other stage to buy power-ups, both pod-specific and permanent. The most vital ones are found on the field. If a pod is destroyed, the pilot ejects in an agile but feeble spacesuit and can be returned to the ship or a wormhole for another craft. Losing a spacesuit costs one of four lives.<br/><br/>While the main character belongs to the &quot;Federation of Space Loonies&quot;, Solar Jetman has no space for more humor other than the occasional irreverent touches. Crates of valuables may turn out to contain rare radioactive elements or Easter Island heads, or in some cases, &quot;absolutely nothing&quot;.<br/><br/>Like many other games published by Tradewest, Solar Jetman is widely considered a very difficult game. This led to the development of a fan-made password generator that allows players to access all of the planets directly.

Once in a while, the game breaks the mold from the typical action and plunges the player into various other types of gameplay, such as flying a plane, riding a mine cart, and going down a mountain on a raft.<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, Indiana Jones' Greatest Adventures , available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "79303": {"videogame": {"130180": "Kirby's Dream Collection"}, "statistics": {}, "name": "Kirby's Dream Land 3", "videogamemode": {"2422": "Local Multiplayer"}, "videogamecompilation": {"130180": "Kirby's Dream Collection"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic801913.jpg", "videogameseries": {"5696": "Kirby's Dream Land"}, "videogametheme": {"2337": "Cute Fantasy"}, "videogamegenre": {"2164": "Platform"}, "videogamecharacter": {"5397": "Kirby"}, "usersrated": "10", "average": "6.9", "videogamefranchise": {"5695": "Kirby"}, "videogameplatform": {"4440": "SNES"}, "videogameversion": {"57727": "SNES Japanese edition"}, "poll": {}, "vgcharacterversion": {"219946": "Kirby"}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic801913_t.jpg", "description": "The game's platforming mechanics are very similar to most other Kirby games, as is Kirby's skillset. Kirby is able to jump, duck, slide, fly (by inflating himself), as well as perform his signature move: inhaling enemies. When Kirby inhales an enemy, it can be spit back out as a projectile, or swallowed. Normally this has no effect on Kirby, although specific enemies grant Kirby copy abilities, a staple of the Kirby games. Copy abilities replace Kirby's standard inhaling move with a special attack, depending on the enemy Kirby ate. For example, swallowing a fire-based enemy allows Kirby to become a fireball.<br/>Kirby's allies<br/>Kirby gets a ride with Coo the owl.<br/><br/>At any time during play, Kirby can summon Gooey&mdash;a blue, long-tongued blob first seen in Dream Land 2. Doing so costs Kirby two hit points. When controlled by the computer, Gooey follows Kirby around and helps him to defeat enemies. (Gooey can also be controlled by a second human player.) Gooey's abilities are similar to Kirby's: He can swallow enemies using his long tongue, then either spit them out or copy their abilities to a limited extent. Kirby can also inhale Gooey and swallow him, reclaiming his two hit points.<br/><br/>In addition to Gooey, Kirby can team up with any one of his six other friends, three of which were introduced in the previous game in the series. This friend mechanic allows Kirby to be ridden, carried or rolled, enabling new team-based abilities, as well as variations of Kirby's copy abilities.<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, Kirby's Dream Land 3 , available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "79304": {"statistics": {}, "name": "Ella's Hope", "videogamemode": {"2149": "Single-Player"}, "videogameversion": {"57737": "Windows edition"}, "average": "0", "videogametheme": {"2148": "Fantasy"}, "usersrated": "0", "videogamegenre": {"2155": "RPG"}, "videogameplatform": {"4977": "Windows"}, "poll": {}, "description": "The angels have long since stopped interfering in the matters of the world yet there are a group of select few who watch over the land below as powerful Guardians.<br/><br/>Each year the most promising individuals from across the lands are invited to take part in the Trials - their prize is to become a Candidate for Guardianship, to train amongst the clouds for a chance to join the elite ones.<br/><br/>Yet our story is not focused on those specially invited ones - instead meet Ella, a girl with a mysterious past having been found on the mountainside in a storm just under a year ago and now working as a maid in the local Inn.<br/><br/>Source: The Game Website.<br/><br/>"}, "79305": {"statistics": {}, "name": "The Karate Kid", "videogamemode": {"2149": "Single-Player"}, "videogameversion": {"57739": "US NES edition"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic793401.jpg", "videogametheme": {"2493": "Martial Arts"}, "usersrated": "7", "average": "3.87143", "videogamegenre": {"2159": "Fighting"}, "videogameplatform": {"4430": "NES"}, "poll": {}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic793401_t.jpg", "description": "User Summary<br/><br/>The Karate Kid video game is loosely based off the events of the first two Karate Kid films.

Players assume the roles of Divisional or Corps  commander. Although there are other ways to play the game, in the historical scenarios the goal is not to &quot;win&quot;, but rather to do better than the historical commanders whose role the players have overtaken. The series' scale encompasses both the Operational and Tactical  levels. Although the product is a wargame its publishers prefer to call it a simulation. It is developed by game designer Glenn Davis and published by Diffraction Entertainment, Ltd. based in Scotland, UK.<br/><br/>Foxhole's first product Utah Beach can be played by two to six players, while future installments are to allow additional players.<br/><br/>The product comes with three ways to play the game: <br/>1) The historical scenario that comes with each product where the goal is to do better than the historical results, <br/>2) A competitive (called tournament-style in the rulebook) system with over two dozen orders similar to Warhammer 40k like sieze and hold, rearguard action, etc. where your goal is to &quot;beat&quot; your opponent to the goal.  Interestingly, in this version you each take one of the hexagonally shaped maps, set up your forces, and then push them together, giving you a bit of fog of war.  <br/>3) TSWW conversion: Although seemingly not fully supported in the original product, the rulebook implies that with later releases of TO&amp;E data players will be able to play out TSWW battles at the Foxhole scale, giving gamers the first opportunity ever to play out World War II at the company scale ... everywhere.<br/><br/>As for playing the game; the following is ripped straight from the rulebook: &quot;A Primer on Foxhole&trade; in 400 Words or Less<br/>Each Player Turn consists of 6 essential Phases:<br/><br/>    Supply-Movement Phase: Units which are adjacent to enemies, plan on firing an artillery barrage or conduct an Activity this turn must Trace Supply instead of do anything this Phase.  Otherwise they may move as usual.<br/>    Barrage Phase: Barrages may be fired this Turn by Sorties and Artillery.  In the case of Artillery, they must have Traced Supply in the prior Phase and not move in the next in order to do so.  Note that the Reacting Player may also be able to fire Barrages.<br/>    Activities-Movement Phase: It is during this Phase and only if the Unit Traced Supply in the Supply-Movement Phase that Units may conduct Activities other than Movement such as digging entrenchments, demolishing them, bridges, etc., crossing a river or un-pin a Vehicle Platoon (which represents Vehicles bogged down).  Units may also move unless they fired a Barrage in the prior Phase.<br/>    Combat Phase: There are two kinds of Combat and each hex may be attacked only once.  Assaulting allows Units to enter and, if successful, secure a hex.  Its disadvantages are that it allows the opposing Player to make Covering Fire against your Assaulting Units, you have less terrain benefits and are limited to 4 Units Assaulting the Hex.  By contrast, Fights allow Units to attack enemy Units from range and has none of the above hindrances, but cannot secure a Hex and is less likely to do serious damage to the opposition.<br/>    Motorized Movement Phase: Motorized Units are all Vehicle Platoons plus any other Unit with the little wheels at the bottom.  Any of such Units can move during this Phase.  In lieu of moving, they may instead make a 50/50 attempt to Un-pin themselves from the hex (but they couldn't have moved anyway).<br/>    Vehicle Assault Phase: During this Phase Vehicles Platoons (not all Motorized Units) may make Assaults.<br/>    Full Turn: A Full Turn consists of Weather Determination and Forecasting followed by a Player Turn from each Player.  The Offensive Player always goes first, which is also the Allied Player in the Utah Beach Historical Scenario.  There are three Full Turns each Day representing the Morning, Afternoon and Night.  Preceding each Morning Turn and the beginning of the day both Players should conduct a Dawn Briefing.&quot; - Foxhole Rulebook, page 36.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>The only thing the above misses is a fun little weather forecasting and resolution where players forecast the weather two turns ahead of time, and it may or may not actually end up being the weather they thought it was going to be (but *probably* will), adding a lot a pressure/tenseness as the commanders look overhead to see whether those clouds will clear up, start a drizzle, or remain overcast as predicted.<br/><br/>"}, "79333": {"statistics": {}, "name": "Median XL", "videogamemode": {"2313": "Cooperative"}, "videogameversion": {"57798": "Mac Downloadable edition"}, "average": "7.5", "videogameseries": {"4751": "Diablo"}, "videogametheme": {"2148": "Fantasy"}, "usersrated": "1", "videogameexpansion": {"71031": "Diablo II: Lord of Destruction"}, "videogamegenre": {"2339": "Action RPG"}, "videogameplatform": {"4729": "Macintosh"}, "poll": {}, "description": "Median XL is the most popular mod, or unofficial modification, for Diablo II Lord of Destruction.

With dozens of new features, new art, and engine improvements, War in the Pacific: Admiral's Edition brings you the most realistic and immersive WWII Pacific Theater wargame ever!<br/><br/>Source: The Publisher Website.<br/><br/>.<br/><br/><br/>War in the Pacific - Admiral's Edition<br/><br/>Many additional man-years of development from a dedicated and experienced team including subject matter experts and experienced programmers has resulted in an improved War in the Pacific experience across the board. This is the entire War in the Pacific down to individual aircraft, vehicles, ships, guns and squads - more than just a game, it's an encyclopedia of the war compiled from many sources to an unmatched level of detail. Add in a much improved AI and more secure PBEM play and you have the makings of a new classic!<br/><br/>The Entire War in the Pacific on One Map! - If you thought the original map was something to behold, wait until you see the new one!   Completely redone to a 40 nautical mile per hex scale (instead of the original 60 mile per hex scale) and with the original distance distortions and inaccuracies greatly reduced, this is the most accurate and most stunning map of the theater ever created.  In addition, the smaller scale has allowed us to add a number of important bases that would not fit in the larger scale, but which played a key role in the strategy of various operations.  On top of that, Admiral&rsquo;s Edition now has off-map movement through map edge boxes representing major bases across the world, allowing more realistic movement of Allied assets and arrival of reinforcements and resources.<br/><br/>The War At Sea - A waypoint system has now been added for Task Force movement, with up to three waypoints possible.  These can also be used to define a patrol zone with loiter times.  Waypoints can also be used for automated convoys along with a &quot;return same route&quot; option, making setting up your supply routes easier than ever.  Task Force Movement is now handled on a hex by hex basis, with mid-ocean intercepts now possible!  Many additional ship classes have been added and the entire naval order of battle has been overhauled with new ships, new subs (including midget subs for the Japanese) and new devices.<br/><br/>The entire upgrade system is now much more capable, allowing conversion of ships between classes as well as multiple upgrade levels (for example, a US Navy four stack destroyer can now convert to APD, AVD, DM or DMS, as the player wishes).  Ports have also been reworked to allow for realistic limits for ability to handle ships, cargo and repairs, with much more control given to the player on how repairs are managed (especially at shipyards).<br/><br/>Shore bombardment, landing craft, major and minor ship damage, Engine vs. System damage, brand new ship art and improved task force and ship displays are just some of the many additional improvements!<br/><br/>The War in the Air - The air combat, pilot replacement and training systems of the original War in the Pacific have all been revisited and improved for the Admiral&rsquo;s Edition.  CAP is now partly in the air and partly scrambled, based on your CAP percentage, radar, climb rate, HQs and other factors.  Fighters now have new more realistic air combat ratings, with maneuver adjusted based on altitude bands and top speed factored into relative maneuver calculations, to allow both styles of air combat to have their due.  The end result is a better simulation of the historical matchups and less of the &quot;uber CAP&quot; that could happen in the original release.<br/><br/>On top of that, plane damage is now tracked across turns and each plane type is assigned a service rating which affects the difficulty of keeping that plane repaired, maintained and in the air.  In addition to ops losses, perpetually damaged planes can now become &quot;write offs&quot; with their parts scavenged to make other planes operational.  Operational losses overall are now at a higher, more realistic level for the Pacific theater.  Fog of war also now applies to the indicator for enemy planes at a base as well and air balance and bomber/escort assignment depends on what you actually know of the enemy&rsquo;s air power.<br/><br/>Pilots are now rated in a dozen different skill levels and can no longer gain the equivalent of combat experience by flying non-combat missions.  Combined with a much more realistic multi-pool pilot training and reserve system, this eliminates certain balance loopholes that could cause unrealistic training rates.<br/><br/>Barrage balloons, blimps, over 500 airplane types, new aircraft art, more realistic coordination limits, configurable resize for squadrons and tracking of air attack vectors for ship flak are some of the many additional improvements!<br/><br/>The War on Land - From the original War in the Pacific&rsquo;s eight terrain types, the Admiral&rsquo;s Edition now has up to sixteen and transportation is now handled based on hex-sides rather than hexes, allowing for realistic land movement rates.  A new dynamic hex-side and hex zone of control system also ensures realistic control over directions of movement and retreat.  Land units now have several modes, rather than just a few - Combat, Movement, Strategic Movement, Reserve, Rest and Disorganized combine to give the player more choices to make about the stance and effectiveness of his land units.  A division in Reserve will be able to Pursue, while a Division in Combat will be able to fight much more effectively and a division in Strategic Movement will be able to use rail movement, for example.<br/><br/>Tactical movement also now allows plotting and executing moves from any one hex to any adjacent hex - supply routes no longer need to be followed.  Improved fog of war, limitations on fort construction, forced withdrawals and disbands and overstacking rules for atolls and small islands are some of the additional improvements that bring the land combat aspect of the Admiral&rsquo;s Edition to a new level!<br/><br/>The War at Home - Economy and Industry have also been improved to more accurately simulate the wartime economies, with the addition of Light Industry and Oil Refinery centers and the removal of fuel and supply production from Resource and Oil centers.  These changes allow for more realistic economies while keeping the game balance at a historical level.  Moving the arrival of some off-map resources to off-map bases, requiring them to be transported on map also removes some issues, such as with Karachi.  The end result is an economy that is not significantly more complex, but works more historically.<br/><br/>The Grand Campaign - All of these improvements will come wrapped up with a new full campaign scenario as well as five other scenarios, ranging in size from smaller to larger, many never before done for the War in the Pacific engine!  The new campaign and scenarios are based on new, thorough and painstaking research to place every starting historical land, naval and air unit where it was historically and to do the same for reinforcements and withdrawals, to maintain a historical balance of forces.  The new orders of battle, planes, ships and devices represent a leap forward in realism and historicity from War in the Pacific, which set the benchmark when it was first released.<br/><br/>The Editor - Finally, scenario and mod-makers will rejoice at the entirely new editor, built from the ground up for the Admiral&rsquo;s Edition.  This editor significantly increases the number of slots available for both devices and locations, has text search, auto-refresh of units from changes TO&amp;Es, display of art work for ships and planes, enables editor-defined LCU breakdowns and task force contents.  It also allows viewing of the contents of a given hex for the entire scenario being worked on (including reinforcements).  The editor also allows you to upgrade the complete TO&amp;E of a unit at a specified date, which is used to good effect in the new scenarios and campaign to allow 2-5 TO&amp;Es for a division, for example, rather than having to abstract those into one for the entire war.<br/><br/>War in the Pacific: Admiral's Edition includes all of these great new features and improvements, along with a host of minor fixes, while maintaining the same great gameplay and game balance that gamers have enjoyed for years in War in the Pacific.<br/><br/>As our first &quot;Collector's Edition&quot;, the boxed version also comes with a Full Color Printed 330 page manual!<br/><br/>Source: The Publisher Website - More Info.<br/><br/>"}, "79352": {"statistics": {}, "name": "Napoleon in Italy", "videogamemode": {"2410": "Asynchronous Multiplayer"}, "videogameversion": {"57838": "Napoleon in Italy"}, "average": "6", "videogametheme": {"2345": "Historical"}, "usersrated": "1", "videogamegenre": {"2158": "Strategy"}, "videogameplatform": {"4977": "Windows"}, "poll": {}, "description": "Step back to the age of Napoleon and follow in the earliest footsteps of this military genius!

After being discovered by Tom Hall and John Romero at the Russian Game Developer's Conference (KRI-2004), distribution rights were discussed, and a localized version of the game was released (via download only) over Steam in 2006. According to staff from the 1C display at KRI-2004, the game created such a favorable impression upon Mr. Hall and Mr. Romero that the pair had to be removed from the demonstration by force.<br/><br/>The game revolves around navigating a main character named Dude from the third-person perspective about a secret landscape under his bed in search of a lost slipper. The game is in 2D and consists of a number of puzzles centered on using items collected and interacting with the 45 other NPCs. There is no dialogue in the game and the difficulty often derives from trying to determine why a character behaves in the way it does. Solutions to the puzzles are often illogical, in keeping with the atmosphere of the game which has been described as psychedelic.&quot;<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, Full Pipe , available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "79488": {"statistics": {}, "name": "Guitar Hero: Smash Hits", "videogamemode": {"2313": "Cooperative"}, "videogameversion": {"117245": "EN/EU PlayStation 2 edition"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic787004.jpg", "videogameseries": {"4827": "Guitar Hero (Core Series)"}, "videogametheme": {"2316": "Music"}, "videogamegenre": {"2163": "Rhythm"}, "average": "6.21053", "videogamefranchise": {"4853": "Guitar Hero"}, "videogameplatform": {"4434": "PlayStation 2"}, "usersrated": "19", "poll": {}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic787004_t.jpg", "description": "Guitar Hero Smash Hits (titled Guitar Hero Greatest Hits in Europe and Australia) is a music video game and the fourth expansion game to the Guitar Hero series.

It is an official mod, and is available through Steam for purchase; however, it is free for those who purchased the retail version of Half-Life prior to the release of Steam.<br/><br/>Ricochet is a deathmatch game notable for its apparent simplicity, inspired by arcade games and platform games in both concept and design. One of its main sources of inspiration is the film Tron in which a similar game is played. Players jump between neon-lit platforms suspended above an abyss, and shoot disks at one another, trying to push the opponent off the platform and into the depths.<br/><br/>There are also horizontal barriers which the disks can bounce off (hence the name Ricochet); a direct hit resulting in a fall scores 1 point, a single-bounced hit scores 2 points, double-bounced 3 points, and so on. Ricochet also features a second attack (done by the alternate fire key) which cuts off the head of your opponent. The decapitation attack (as it is called) uses all three of your discs, but recharges all of them at once quickly.<br/><br/>Unlike in other Half-Life mods, the number of player deaths is not shown on the scoreboard, only the number of kill points. The aiming is effectively two-dimensional, and the movement is reduced to automated jumping between the platforms, though some maneuvering can be performed in mid-air by advanced players.<br/><br/>Three maps come with the mod, two for deathmatch and one for duel combat. Maps for Ricochet use the prefix &quot;rc&quot;.

Banks, building sites, sewage works and other everyday recognisable buildings form the basis of many of the levels in SiN. One major difference in the world of SiN is the lack of a police force. 10 years prior to the game, it is revealed that the police force collapsed due to inefficiency and ineffectiveness against the rising tide of crime. Private security companies have taken their place, some patrolling the streets like the former police, some in charge of protecting their employer's assets.<br/><br/>One of these companies which employ their own armed security forces are SiNtek, a large multi-national biotechnology firm owned by the beautiful and charismatic Elexis Sinclaire. Elexis took over the firm following the disappearance of her father, Dr. Thrall Sinclaire, who formed it in 2005.<br/><br/>The protagonist of the game, Col. John Blade, is the commander of one of the largest security forces in the city of Freeport, HardCorps. Prior to the beginning of the game, John is working to rid the streets of a potent new recreational drug named U4, which is gaining in popularity in Freeport. Yet, the source of the drug is still unknown, and its effects not entirely studied. As the game begins, the player is placed into the shoes of John Blade as he responds to a full scale bank heist and hostage situation perpetrated by a well known criminal, Mancini. But as the player progresses and pursues the criminals behind the heist, further questions are raised: Who is really behind the heist? And is this linked to the reported appearance of mutants in the city?<br/><br/>Throughout the missions, Blade is aided via radio link by a computer cracker working at HardCorps, JC. JC is a skilled cracker, capable of breaking into even the tightest of networks. In fact, Blade first found out about JC when investigating a cracker who had broken into the HardCorps system. After tracking down the hacker, Blade, recognizing the perpetrator's talents, decided to make him a job offer at HardCorps instead of arresting him. Thus, JC became one of HardCorps most valuable assets.&quot;<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, SiN (video game) , available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "79495": {"statistics": {}, "name": "SiN Episodes: Emergence", "videogamemode": {"2149": "Single-Player"}, "videogameversion": {"58127": "Windows Steam Edition"}, "average": "6.25", "videogameseries": {"5578": "SiN"}, "videogametheme": {"2264": "Science Fiction"}, "usersrated": "6", "videogamegenre": {"2160": "First Person Shooter"}, "videogameplatform": {"4977": "Windows"}, "poll": {}, "description": "SiN Episodes is the title of a series of episodic games for the PC that would have expanded upon the 1998 computer game SiN.
