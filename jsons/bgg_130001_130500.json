They often compete, although it usually ends in a tie or close win. In Fencing however, Prince Richard is always the victor. One day a messenger arrives from a small neighboring kingdom, warning the princes that the evil King Delarin has invaded the Mille-Feuille Kingdom and captured the beautiful princess Tiramisu. In yet another boastful attempt to best the Sabure Prince, Richard grabs a boat and rushes towards the kingdom. The Sabure Prince is left trying to catch up. While on his journey, he and Richard (and many others) are transformed into frogs in an attempt to reveal the true happenings in this kingdom.<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;Kaeru no Tame ni Kane wa Naru&quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "130008": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1406697.jpg", "poll": {}, "boardgamedesigner": {"2762": {"name": "Emanuele Ornella"}}, "statistics": {}, "yearpublished": "2012", "maxplayers": "4", "boardgameartist": {"63366": "Mattia Mentastro"}, "boardgamepublisher": {"1850": {"name": "Mind the Move"}}, "maxplaytime": "120", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1406697_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "90", "boardgamecategory": {"1021": {"name": "Economic"}}, "description": "Game description from the publisher:<br/><br/>In 1477, the French king Louis XI created the royal mail service.

You&rsquo;ve just returned from a trip to San Bernardino, California, where you ate at the McDonald brothers restaurant and witnessed their &ldquo;Speedee Service System.&rdquo; Sure, there are other fast food restaurants like White Castle, Kentucky Fried Chicken and Jack in the Box, but you can tell this assembly line based cooking system is innovative and will revolutionize the way the fast food industry operates. You can tell there is money to be made and you intend to be the one making it. You decide to start opening your own fast food restaurants, but unfortunately for you, you&rsquo;re not the only one.<br/><br/>How will you distinguish yourself from your competitors? Will you start with the idea of the assembly line and focus on becoming even more productive? Will you focus on marketing to win people&rsquo;s hearts (and dollars)? Maybe you will focus on regulations, making friends with the politically powerful (all in the name of the consumer, of course). Or maybe you will just be a criminal, offering &ldquo;protection&rdquo; \u009dto your rivals and laundering money through your restaurants. Whatever you choose, do you have what it takes to defeat your opponents and become a fast food legend?<br/><br/>In addition to the four business focuses (production, marketing, regulatory, criminal), knowing how to play the market is a very important part of the game and adds a whole level of strategy. What you can do is directly tied to which franchises you have purchased during the auction phase. Will you try to corner the chicken market to keep your prices low and margin high or will you try to drive up everyone's prices knowing (hoping?) they won't be able to keep up with your production deck?

It was followed by a sequel, Willy the Worm Part II: The Big Trip Home.<br/><br/>The game puts the player in control of a small invertebrate named Willy who must make his way along platforms and past various hazards in order to ring a bell that hangs at the end of each of the game's eight levels. Lethal hazards consist of cannon balls, which roll along the levels' platforms and ladders, and sharp tacks.<br/>Willy has a limited amount of time to make his way through each level, as indicated by a bonus counter at the bottom of the screen which counts down from 1000 in increments of 10; when the counter reaches zero, one life is lost and the level restarts. Points remaining at the end of the level are added to the player's score. The player also earns points by jumping cannon balls (20 points) or collecting presents (100 points).<br/>The four arrow keys control movement left and right along platforms or up and down ladders, and the space bar makes Willy jump. Other keys make Willy stop in place. The game uses PC speaker beeps for sound effects and ASCII characters as graphics and can run in either monochrome or color (blue and white) display modes.<br/>The Willy the Worm Screen Editor, included with the game, allows players to design their own levels.<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;Willy the Worm&quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "130025": {"statistics": {}, "name": "Tinkle Bavard #1", "average": "0", "usersrated": "0", "rpgissue": {"19420": "Tinkle Bavard"}, "rpgissuearticle": {"120546": "Avant-premi\u00e8re [Preview]"}, "rpg": {"3413": "Animonde"}, "rpgissueversion": {"178528": "Softcover Version"}, "poll": {}, "description": "Les lasers<br/>Avant-premi&egrave;re In Nomine Satanis<br/>Avant-premi&egrave;re Magna Veritas<br/>L'araign&eacute;e-fileuse<br/>Le Symbiosivore<br/>Sur les traces de l'arc<br/>Le pudding<br/>Un univers impitoyable<br/>P&eacute;nurie de soleils<br/><br/>"}, "130026": {"statistics": {}, "name": "Tinkle Bavard #2", "average": "0", "usersrated": "0", "rpgissue": {"19420": "Tinkle Bavard"}, "rpg": {"323": "Ars Magica (2nd Edition)"}, "rpgissueversion": {"178530": "Softcover Version"}, "poll": {}, "description": "L'acier<br/>Sur les traces de l'acier<br/>Faah<br/>Personnaliser les Terres m&eacute;dianes<br/>Cyberpunk &agrave;

While the Germans were outnumbered, especially in tanks, they had superior command control and tactics, allowing them to defeat the Soviets piecemeal. Moreover, the Red Army at this stage of the war was in the midst of reorganization, and suffering from severe logistical shortfalls. Still, the Germans got a surprise when they ran up against T-34 and KV tanks which were far heavier than the German AFVs, and were largely impervious to their anti-tank fire, except for the infamous 88mm flak guns.

The game ends at the close of a round in which a player erects her eighth building. Players then tally their points, and the player with the highest score wins.<br/><br/>Players start with a number of building cards in their hand; buildings come in five colors, with the purple buildings typically having a special ability and the other colored buildings providing a benefit when you play particular characters. At the start of each round, each player secretly chooses one of the eight characters. Each character has a special ability, and the usefulness of any character depends upon your situation, and that of your opponents. The characters then carry out their actions in numerical order: the assassin eliminating another character for the round, the thief stealing all gold from another character, the wizard swapping building cards with another player, the warlord optionally destroys a building in play, and so on.<br/><br/>On a turn, a player can either earn gold or draw two building cards and discard one, then optionally construct one building (or up to three if playing the architect this round). Erecting buildings costs gold. At the end of the game, each building is worth a certain number of points. In addition to points from buildings, at the end of the game a player scores bonus points for having eight buildings or buildings of all five colors.<br/><br/>The 2012 release of Ohne Furcht und Adel includes fifteen cards not included in the original base game, with seven different types of action cards. These cards are mixed into the building card deck, and one action can be played each turn. Action cards in hand are worth one point at the end of the game. The cards, their actions and their counts are:<br/><br/><br/>     (x2) Wahrsagerin (Fortune Teller)  &ndash; Look at an opponent's hand and take one of their cards.<br/>     (x2) Direktor (Director)  &ndash; Build up to two more buildings this turn.<br/>     (x2) Rasputin   &ndash; Negate an assassination.<br/>     (x1) Akrobatin (Acrobat)  &ndash; If there is no king this round, take the crown.<br/>     (x3) Kassenwagen (Ticket Booth)  &ndash; Once per turn, the active player may place one gold on this card to draw two cards and keep one. You may trash this card to gain all gold on it.<br/>     (x2) Lebende Kanonenkugel (Living Cannonball)  &ndash; Replace one of your buildings with a more expensive one from your hand, paying the difference.<br/>     (x3) Zirkuszelt (Circus Tent)  &ndash; You may build this, which counts as a zero point building without color that the Warlord cannot destroy.<br/><br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": {"271989": "Czech first edition"}, "name": "Ohne Furcht und Adel", "playingtime": "60", "boardgamemechanic": {"2041": "Card Drafting"}, "age": "10", "usersrated": "391", "average": "7.10599"}, "130061": {"rpg": {"19493": "Mechanika"}, "statistics": {}, "name": "Mechanika: Empires of Blood and Steam Demo Packet", "rpgproducer": {"93736": "Joshua Baker"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1407202.png", "usersrated": "0", "rpgitemversion": {"178615": "PDF version"}, "average": "0", "rpggenre": {"961": "Fantasy"}, "rpgcategory": {"2622": "Quick Start / Fast Play Rules"}, "poll": {}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1407202_t.png", "description": "From Introduction:<br/><br/>This pamphlet is your guide to a world much like our own, but at the same time very different, very alien and very dangerous.<br/><br/>Enclosed within these pages is a glimpse of Mechanika: Empires of Blood and Steam.

A typical two player game takes less than 20 minutes, while four player games have been known to last over an hour.<br/><br/>In the game, each player controls a team of 4 gods, goddesses, and/or other entities, each with a different ability: some abilities may help their teammates, or hinder the opposing teams; others grant special attacks, or bring in extra reinforcements. New gods and/or goddesses are revealed as the game progresses, and each one in play gets an attack each round. Attacks are determined by comparing the attacking entity's Attack score (plus a die roll) to the defending entities Defense score (plus a die roll). Similarly, two entities may Clash, comparing their Energy scores (plus die rolls), with varying results. Entities remain in play until they run out of Energy points, at which point they are removed from the game, and the winning player is the last one with any gods and/or goddesses left.<br/><br/>The gods, goddesses, and other entities come from various mythologies, and are grouped together by their culture of origin. Each culture has eight Entity cards (gods and goddesses), and each &quot;Battle Set&quot; has two cultures, for a total of 16 cards per set. Battle Set 1 (Greeks vs. Norsemen) was released as a print-and-play game on August 25th, 2012. Battle Set 2 (Egyptians vs. Japanese) will be released similarly on September 9th, 2012. Battle Set 3 and 4 are slated for early and mid-2013, respectively.<br/><br/>The game itself has a deck building element, as any four gods or goddesses can be brought together for a team, and some combinations are more useful than others. There is also an element of luck, as dice are used in determining attacks and Clashes, and which is amplified by the game's Critical Roll system (wherein a roll of 6 &quot;almost always&quot; wins).<br/><br/>The full rules and the card information (including the card images) were publicly released under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported (CC BY-NC-SA 3.0) license.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": {"178648": "First edition"}, "average": "7.75", "name": "MythWars: Clash of the Gods", "playingtime": "20", "boardgamemechanic": {"2664": "Deck / Pool Building"}, "age": "12", "usersrated": "4", "boardgamefamily": {"6040": "CCGs (Collectible Card Games)"}}, "130080": {"boardgamedesigner": {"4852": {"name": "Wendy L.

Most gamers ignore the issues of time in a campaign, unless they are on small-scale events (combat rounds) or specific long-term consequences (like ability adjustments due to character age). As such, our intent is to show you the many options possible when you introduce time-related effects into your game. These ideas are just that. They are not meant to take the importance of a Core Rulebook, but to allow your minds to open new vistas in your campaigns and adventures.<br/><br/>Through this book, there will be a number of new ideas presented. These ideas are meant to be useable in most campaigns, but we realize that information and ideas may need to be adjusted to fit your specific needs. For instance, this is especially true with the gods, goddesses, and domains section, as typically each world has set gods and goddesses in place. Additionally, any major changes (such as those involving implementing the new classes, feats, and/or spells found below) will involve individual tweaking to fit the continuing enjoyment that is key to role-playing.<br/><br/>"}, "130113": {"rpgitemversion": {"178762": "PDF version"}, "poll": {}, "name": "Barracks", "rpggenre": {"173": "Generic / Universal"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2219935.jpg", "usersrated": "0", "rpgproducer": {"60450": "Christian Hollnbuchner"}, "statistics": {}, "rpg": {"356": "Generic / Universal"}, "average": "0", "rpgcategory": {"2086": "Accessory (dice, maps, screens, cards)"}, "rpgseries": {"18350": "Battlemaps (by Christian Hollnbuchner)"}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2219935_t.jpg", "description": "From the Introduction:<br/><br/>While other rooms in the dungeon are downright hostile and not fit for permanent occupation and most others are designed to be utilitarian at best this room looks homey if not cozy.

The following features are included:<br/><br/>EA Sports Hockey IQ (AI): Makes CPU-controlled players and teammates smarter by reacting to everything on the ice, not just what they see in front of them. Skaters will be more easily able to prevent scoring opportunities. For goaltenders, Hockey IQ opens up for a lot of new different types of desperation saves as they are better able to identify &quot;potential&quot; scoring threats. As part of Hockey IQ, there are over five times as many strategy options in NHL 13 compared to previous titles of the current generation of the NHL series to replicate the real-life plays in the National Hockey League (NHL). Also, players can now develop their own plays and implement them for the computer AI in gameplay. According to Dean Richards, general manager of the NHL series, the development team spent more time on the AI development in NHL 13 than in the past three years combined.<br/><br/>True Performance Skating, a new skating engine based on physics, makes the player skating more dynamic and realistic with over 1,000 new animations created using motion capture. The engine is divided into three parts: explosiveness, top-end speed, and momentum. Explosiveness refers to how quickly a player can accelerate when gliding, being in a stationary state or how far a player can skate quickly. Top-end speed means that the players can skate as quickly as in real-life in their top speeds. Momentum is part of the physics; for example, a player skating at top speed may not turn around as quickly when carrying the puck as compared to when skating at normal speed or just gliding. Also, a player skating at top speed has his shooting and passing accuracies decreased. Momentum also means that players have a harder time recovering from mistakes. The new animations, combined with the Skill Stick features, allow for a lot of new plays and dekes that can be pulled off. True Performance Skating is taglined &quot;Every Stride Matters&quot;.<br/>Improved rating system: In NHL 12, each player's overall rating is based on that player's role in the team (playmaker, enforcer, defensive defenceman etc). In NHL 13, however, the player's overall rating is based on that player's skill in their position (i.e. forward, defenceman, or goaltender). For example, in NHL 12, George Parros (at that time playing for the Anaheim Ducks) was rated 81 overall (out of 99) based on his role as an enforcer. In NHL 13, Parros' overall rating has been lowered down to 69 as determined by his skill as a forward. EA Sports stated that this was &quot;a fan-requested change&quot;. Based on their attribute values, the players are now also given 5-star ratings for these six categories: shooting, puck skills, senses, skating, physical, and defense. Further, the teams' overall ratings for offense, defense and goaltending are now also 5-star based ratings instead of out-of-100 ones.[14]<br/>Team First Presentation aims to make the in-game experience more authentic than previously. Team-specific presentations for the NHL teams have been added, and it's also possible to manually customize the experience.<br/><br/>GM Connected: Allows players to play in online Be a GM leagues with human-controlled teams. Players can keep track of what's happening in their league with a mobile app.<br/>NHL Moments Live: taglined &quot;Can you recreate history?&quot;, this mode allows players to re-play and re-live great moments from the 2011&ndash;12 NHL season. In addition, new moments will be uploaded as the 2012&ndash;13 NHL season progresses.<br/><br/>Hockey Ultimate Team: The design of HUT has been revamped, the reward system improved and a new playoff format for HUT has been added. New features for player-card collections have been added to make it easier to create a HUT team.<br/><br/>All new GM Brain: Revamped Trade logic between AI GMs and users.<br/>EA Sports Hockey League remains in the game and features like club captains and improved matchmaking have been added.<br/>Be a Pro: Players are now able to demand a trade from their teams. Once the user demands a trade, their GM will evaluate the player's preformance and place the user on the trading block. Players can also choose to retire at any given point at their career.<br/><br/>Refined goalie controls: In previous games of the current NHL generation, the right stick was used to make a manual save. In NHL 13 the right stick is now used to anticipate a save instead of actually attempting to make a save.<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;NHL 13&quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "130133": {"statistics": {}, "name": "Azrael's Tear", "videogamemode": {"2149": "Single-Player"}, "videogameversion": {"178831": "North American DOS edition"}, "average": "0", "videogametheme": {"2264": "Science Fiction"}, "usersrated": "0", "videogamegenre": {"2161": "Action Adventure"}, "videogameplatform": {"4714": "DOS"}, "poll": {}, "description": "Azrael's Tear is a 1996 first-person role-playing video game adventure game published by Mindscape and developed by Intelligent Games.

Moondust is also considered to be the first interactive music publication, and it sold quite successfully.<br/><br/>Moondust's gameplay is characterized by graphical complexity, and the game features an abstract ambient score. The goal of the game is to guide a spaceman around the screen creating strange patterns and getting bullet-shaped spaceships to pass through the trails that the spaceman creates.

A pioneer in the field of VR, Lanier and Thomas G. Zimmerman left Atari in 1985 to found VPL Research, Inc., the first company to sell VR goggles and gloves. In the late 1990s, Lanier worked on applications for Internet2, and in the 2000s, he was a visiting scholar at Silicon Graphics and various universities. More recently, he has acted as an advisor to Linden Lab on their virtual world product Second Life, and as &quot;scholar-at-large&quot; at Microsoft Research where he has worked on the Kinect device for Xbox 360. Lanier is also known as a composer of classical music and a collector of rare instruments; his acoustic album, Instruments of Change (1994) features Asian wind and string instruments such as the khene mouth organ, the suling flute, and the sitar-like esraj. Lanier was the director of an experimental short film, and teamed with Mario Grigorov to compose the soundtrack to the documentary film, The Third Wave (2007). As an author, Lanier has written a column for Discover magazine; his book, You Are Not a Gadget (2010), is a critique of Web 2.0. In 2010, Lanier was nominated in the TIME 100 list of most influential people.<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;Jaron Lanier,&quot; available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "130160": {"statistics": {}, "name": "Game Geek (Issue 33 - Sep 2012)", "rpgproducer": {"5349": "Robert Hemminger"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1409013.png", "usersrated": "0", "average": "0", "rpgissue": {"5874": "Game Geek"}, "rpgissuearticle": {"86055": "Arcana"}, "rpg": {"2791": "Pathfinder System Compatible Product"}, "rpgissueversion": {"178904": "PDF"}, "poll": {}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1409013_t.png", "description": "<br/>     Musing of the Avalon Stogie <br/>     Behind the Game, Road Rage <br/>     Coral Throne Interlude X <br/>     HWM.

One animal is chosen at random for each player, then after receiving a hand of seven cards, each player places one of his cards face-down (possibly the same animal) as an additional bet. Players then take turns laying down 1-4 cards, with all cards needing to show the same animal, then refilling the hand to five cards. As soon as eight total cards have been played or four cards of any one animal, the animals move (maybe).<br/><br/>Each animal has a distinct characteristic that players can use to their advantage. The turtle always moves one space, but it moves two if four of its cards were played. The rabbit always moves two spaces as long as cards are played. &mdash; unless four cards are played and it's at the head of the pack, in which case it sleeps and doesn't move. The fox moves as many spaces as the number of cards played. The lamb moves one more space than the number of cards played &mdash; but if it reaches water, it stops moving to take a drink. The wolf moves 1 space if one to two cards are played, and one less space than the number of cards if more are played.  The wolf also has 3 cards with a howl, if one of these is played no one but the wolf moves.(The track consists of eleven road cards, two covered with water.)<br/><br/>After the animals move, players start a new round of card-playing. A round ends when three of the five animals reach the goal, after which each player scores points based on the ranking of the animals and how they bet. After three rounds, the player with the most points wins.<br/><br/>The original title of Royal Turtle is a homage to Reiner Knizia's Royal Turf, another betting game about animals racing (albeit horses in that game).<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": {"278260": "Chinese First edition"}, "average": "7.19913", "name": "Tales & Games: The Hare & the Tortoise", "playingtime": "15", "boardgamemechanic": {"2014": "Betting/Wagering"}, "age": "7", "boardgameexpansion": {}, "usersrated": "2263", "boardgamesubdomain": {"5499": "Family Games"}, "boardgamefamily": {"24244": "Tales & Games"}}, "130177": {"rpgitemversion": {"178937": "PDF version"}, "poll": {}, "name": "The West Wood Barony", "rpgproducer": {"18166": "Mike Johnstone"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1410531.png", "usersrated": "0", "rpgsetting": {"19513": "Karathis"}, "average": "0", "statistics": {}, "rpg": {"1788": "d20 System / OGL Product (D&D 3.0 Compatible)"}, "rpgcategory": {"2107": "Campaign Setting (game world)"}, "rpggenre": {"155": "Fantasy (High Fantasy)"}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1410531_t.png", "description": "From Introduction:<br/><br/>The following pages offer an introduction to Fiery Dragon Productions&rsquo; in-house campaign world called Karathis, which has served as the default setting in Fiery Dragon&rsquo;s published adventures now for the span of twelve or so releases.

Falk, on Wed, 7 Jun 1995 11:33:10 -0400<br/><br/>What follows is a collection of articles written for NERPS books that never were: Shadows of the Mind, ShadowLore II, and DragonLore. The reasons for their not appearing before are numerous, and include things such as disinterest on the part of the NERPS list in continuing the projects, lack of time on behalf of the original editors, and more. Now, they&rsquo;ve been brought together into one book.<br/><br/>Shadows Of The Mind was to be a psionics handbook for Shadowrun; although it was never finished, a very incomplete version can be found on various WWW sites, and more articles intended for it appear in old NERPS logs. I&rsquo;ve dug through those logs, and added all missing articles I could find into the basic text; however, as you can see in this book, a lot still remains unwritten. At the end I&rsquo;ve added a short thread about Shadows Of The Mind I also found in the logs, on the basis that it clarifies some of the things brought up in the preceding chapters. You&rsquo;ll spot a lot of &ldquo;to be written later&rdquo;s in the text, showing just how incomplete this document actually is; the logs weren&rsquo;t helpful there, unfortunately.<br/>Note that Awakenings tells us that psionics are normal magicians doing their magic under some self-imposed rules that makes them believe they are psionics, but this NERPS document was written before Awakenings came out. (So what if several listmembers did obtain a copy of what, at the time, we knew as the Neo-Anarchists Guide to Magic? :)<br/><br/>ShadowLore II was to be a follow-up to the very first NERPS book, ShadowLore (hence the title), and was completed by late spring 1995, as evidenced by the quote at the top of this page. J.D. was to do the editing, but for various reasons it took him so much time that in the end we decided it would be best to read through the old logs and gather all the articles together, then edit them ourselves (J.D. having quit the Shadowrun-related mailing lists in early 1996, if I recall correctly). However, instead of opting for careful editing the texts to make all the articles fit smoothly together, as I believe J.D. had planned to do, I chose to add in everything I could find, and only edit out things like typos, spelling and grammar errors, etc. My reason for doing so is because this fits better with the thought behind Lost And Found, namely to bring old material back in the picture.<br/><br/>DragonLore started out as a new NERPS project in spring 1995, around the time the articles for ShadowLore II were finished; the idea behind it was that we knew little about the dragons that live in the Shadowrun world, and it was to gather together much of the material we knew, and speculate about the rest. It never was as successful or popular as was envisioned; not all that many articles about dragons were submitted, and it was then decided to expand it to include other paranormal animals as well.<br/>NERPS veterans will notice that the articles written for DragonLore don&rsquo;t appear in ShadowLore II in this book, which was the plan when it turned out there were less dragon-related articles than was originally anticipated. Instead I&rsquo;ve made it a separate section of this book, I felt that would fit in better with the whole &ldquo;compilation book&rdquo; idea.<br/><br/>Now you know (more or less) the story behind NERPS: Lost and Found.

And the cards are not traditional at all. They feature British Royal 'houses', such as the Normans or the Tudors, etc. Because of the uneven number of monarchs in each family, the suits are uneven. For example, the Norman suit consists of five cards, four being monarchs and the fifth is an honour card and features illustrations of the four monarchs in that House. However the Tudors consist of 6 cards; Five monarchs and the honour card showing them all. Others vary according to how many monarchs were in that lineage.<br/><br/>Mark out on the table four areas (called Pools). In order they signify;<br/>Ace of Fleur-de-Lis or William the Norman<br/>The 5 of the Red and White Rose, which is represented by Elizabeth the 1st<br/>The five of the Oak, represented by William IV<br/>and just one known as Game<br/>Each player puts 1 counter into the William the Norman Pool and 1 into Elizabeth Pool and 1 into the Game Pool. And each player puts two counters into the William IV Pool.<br/><br/>The game is one of following suit really. If a card is chosen as the first card in a suit, the 'next' card in the suit can be played on it, and so on. If the highest card in a suit is played. that player can choose to start with a card in one of the other suits. Play goes on until one player plays their last card. That player gets the Game counters. In addition, every player pays the 'out' player one counter for every card still in their hand (or two counters for every card if you happen to still hold the Cromwell card) The other Pools are collected during the game. If a player plays the next card in sequence and that card happens to be William the Norman, Elizabeth or William IV, then that player takes the counters in the associated Pool.<br/><br/>Play as many games as you want and the one with the most counters when you stop, is the winner.<br/><br/>Notes:<br/>There are seven suits:<br/>Fleur-de-Lis (sic) or the Norman line<br/>Broom Tree or the Plantagenets<br/>Red Rose or the House of Lancaster<br/>White Rose or the House of York<br/>Red and White Rose joined or the House of Tudor<br/>Thistle or the House of Stuart<br/>Acorn or the House of Hanover<br/>Plus one special card representing Oliver Cromwell (the Usurper as the rules describe him). He does not belong to a royal house at all so does not have an emblem. He can only be played between the two Charles cards. In other words, when Charles I is played, then Cromwell can be played and then Charles II could be played. If you are caught with Cromwell in your hand then you have to pay double for the cards in your hand once someone has gone out.<br/><br/>There are 42 cards and the rules run to 16 pages but do include a sample game. That must have been pretty rare. I have dated it 1838 because the last Monarch is William IV and Victoria was crowned a year later.<br/><br/>"}, "130215": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1439828.jpg", "poll": {}, "boardgamedesigner": {"9516": {"name": "Chas Argent"}}, "statistics": {}, "boardgamecompilation": {"86445": "Tannenberg 1914"}, "yearpublished": "2012", "maxplayers": "0", "boardgameartist": {"11857": "Nicol\u00e1s Eskubi"}, "boardgamepublisher": {"196": {"name": "Multi-Man Publishing"}}, "maxplaytime": "0", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1439828_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "0", "boardgamecategory": {"1042": {"name": "Expansion for Base-game"}}, "description": "Special Ops Issue #3 includes the game Tannenberg 1914, articles and errata counters for several MMP games.<br/><br/>It also contains ASL/ASLSK material.<br/><br/>ASL/ASLSK articles:<br/><br/>     ASL Etiquette by Dave Ramsey<br/>     Don&rsquo;t Go Off Half-Tracked: Getting the Most Out Of Your Halftracks in ASL by John Slotwinski &amp; Phil Palmer<br/>     Teaching ASL by Robert Wolkey<br/>     Forward to Elst! by Ken Dunn<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>ASL scenarios:<br/><br/>     O5 The Tsar&rsquo;s Infernal Machines (Brian Youse &amp; Ken Dunn)<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>This 7-turn scenario is a 1914 World War I action between Russian and German forces and features two new vehicles: the Russo-Balt armored car and the Mannesmann-Mulag armored truck.

But the task to gain hands-on knowledge about what makes the devices go off and what damage they can do is no picnic, and not even a lifetime of resurrections can change that. The goblins want out and the only way to do that is to survive long enough to earn the gold coins needed to bribe their way out of their miserable situation.<br/><br/>To win players need to keep their heads, perfect their timing, make every card count and, above all, make sure not to be the one holding the bomb when it explodes.<br/><br/>Compared to the original game, Big Badaboom has five more bombs, five more mechanisms, and a new category of cards: the resurrection cards. These optional cards add even more slapstick humor to the game.

Clues in the vault unravelled some of the dark secrets he kept during his lifetime, and the characters should have determined that his wife Amelia was captured by Lisette and held prisoner somewhere. This adventure expands on these clues and secrets as the characters attempt to find out what really happened to Amelia and bring her back -- if she is still alive.<br/><br/>The Quest for Amelia is designed for 4 characters of 2nd -3rd level and takes place within the town of Weston (as detailed in NeMoren's Vault) and the small forest located directly northwest of it. This area should be easy to drop into an existing campaign; even the minotaur's cave can be placed in any type of terrain; the dryad encounter, however, will need to be removed if the cave is not located in a forested area.<br/><br/>"}, "130273": {"poll": {}, "name": "West Point A Game For The Nation", "playingtime": "30", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": {"2035": "Roll / Spin and Move"}, "yearpublished": "1902", "usersrated": "0", "maxplayers": "4", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1513513_t.jpg", "average": "0", "statistics": {}, "boardgamepublisher": {"5073": {"name": "J.

We toss half the deck on the table, sit down, then while the hourglass runs try to create different card combinations that bring us victory points (VPs).<br/><br/>One side of a Confetti card shows three differently sized and colored circles; by collecting cards with a small, medium and large circle of the same color, the player receives 1 VP. The other side has different shapes, but the idea is the same; a small, medium and large shape of the same color is worth 1 VP.<br/><br/>What makes the game tough is that you can take cards from the table only by using the fingers on your right hand and sliding them across the table.  You'll also need to use your left hand to hang on to cards already taken or else other players can steal them from you. Finally, any cards you collect that aren't used in a combination with others cost you 1 VP at the end of the game. (Bear in mind that any shape on a card can be used in only one combo!)<br/><br/>Confetti lasts three rounds. During the first and second rounds you can collect and keep six cards in your play area; during the third round nine cards.

Smart characters stay away from loose, heavy objects that can fall on them. The GM must determine the strength of the earthquake in terms of how much damage it does to structures. All buildings and structures (such as roads) are dealt this amount of damage every round, for the duration of the quake. If damage overcomes a structure&rsquo;s hardness, pieces fall from it, possibly damaging anyone below. Quaking buildings threaten an area around themselves equaling their height.

Laconic fascination of traditional Japanese architecture, ancient European card-building passion and a native Russian talent of constructing magnificent edifices without any nail are united in this game.<br/><br/>The game concept is familiar to everyone who has built a card castle at least once: vertical piers are leaned together and horizontal cards are placed at their top becoming a base for the new floor, and it continues till there are no cards left or one clumsy movement ruins all the construction. Moreover standard cards called heki which are used only for walls there are some other building elements: gamen screens (twice bigger than heki) and yanegae overlaps with the special fixed stops for heki. Vertical cards stay at their places because of it so castle levels can be built as a tower one right above another, not only like a pyramid. Yanegae cards are of two sizes &ndash; small ones with the space for one leaned pair of heki (this construction is called karigoya) and big for two pairs which can be placed transversely to each other as well as parallel. The last variety of big yanegae with two perpendicular pairs is called antei and works as the basic unit for the most of constructions.<br/><br/>Rules offer many varieties of the game: for one player or for the company of 2-4 builders. There can be up to 8 players if two game kits are used. Solo gameplay is simple &ndash; you need to build a castle as high as possible. There are no strict rules &ndash; you can use any element conditionally to your imagination. Competing versions usually offer to build a tower of exact height in a pelter or make the most solid building &ndash; in this case players jolt the table trying to ruin opponent&rsquo;s castle and not to damage own. Especially amusing version tenders to take your castle and move it to another table keeping it all-of-a-piece, of cause. There is also some kind of gameplay resembling Jenga &ndash; players put some cards into a heap, place a few karigoya at the top and try to pull the cards out of the heap without busting the buildings.<br/><br/>Building castles with special elements is easier than with common cards but still the same interesting. Japanese castle can be even built by a child nevertheless nobody suggests to play it in the after-party morning. <br/>The game differs favorably from the common cards by design &ndash; building elements show off the authentical Japanese pictures and interiors from the rich collection of the &ldquo;Yugen&rdquo; antiques gallery. Japanese castle will give you hours of creativity and excitement and maybe can become a first step to a high-altitude card building champion title for someone.

Eventually, one player will remain in the round and earn one point.  This is repeated except that the lowest number will win the second round.  Continue until a single player scores six.<br/><br/>Odd Even Game - Roll all dice and divide them into even and odd piles.  Earn one point for each roll.<br/><br/>Addition Game (Adding 2 numbers) - Roll all dice.  Select two, add them and announce the sum.  One point is given for each correct answer.  Play to ten points.<br/><br/>Addition and Subtraction -  As above for Addition Game, but continue, subtracting the lesser die from the greater die and announcing the difference.  One point is given for each correct answer.  Play to ten points.<br/><br/>Addition Game (Adding 3 Numbers) - Roll all dice and choose three.  Add them together and announce the sum.<br/><br/>Challenging Variation of Additiona &amp; Subtraction Games - Instead of granting one point per correct answer, players earn the answer as the number of points, thus encouraging players to select harder dice.<br/><br/>Place Value Game - Roll dice until all show single-digit numbers.  Select any three and name the three-digit number they form.  Earn one point for each roll and play to 28.  Optionally, offer an extra point for each number that is written out long-hand.<br/><br/>________________________________________<br/>Games and Activities for 3rd and 4th Grades:<br/><br/>Multiplication Game I: Each player writes down a set of five numbers.  Before rolling, each player will announce which of those numbers they will be using.  After rolling all the dice, select three and multiply each by the number chosen before the roll, scoring one point per correct answer.  On his next turn, the player must choose a new multiplicand.<br/><br/>Multiplication Game II: Roll six dice.  Divide the rolled dice into three pairs and multiply each pair, announcing the product.  Earn one point per correct answer.<br/><br/>Challenging Variation to Multiplication Games I and II: Play as above except that players add the products to their scores instead of one point, thus challenging them to select higher-yielding combinations.<br/><br/>Division Game: Roll all dice, removing any duplicate numbers.  Identify any pairs of dice where one can be evenly divided into the other.  Die may be used more than once.  Earn one point per pair identified.  Before the next player rolls the dice, they may review the pairs and earn two points for any missed pairs they identify.  Play to 30 points.<br/><br/>Equation Game: Roll all dice.  Identify any valid equations - addition, subtraction, multiplication or division.  Each equation will require at least three dice, but may use more.   Earn one point for each die used.  Continue making equations, re-using dice as needed.  Play to 25 points.<br/><br/>________________________________________<br/>The dice are of good quality and have the following faces:<br/><br/>A:  1 -  2 -  3 -  4 -  5 -  6<br/>B:  2 -  3 -  4 -  5 -  8 -  9<br/>C:  2 -  9 - 10 - 10 - 11 - 12<br/>D:  3 -  4 -  5 -  6 -  7 -  8<br/>E:  3 -  5 -  6 -  7 -  9 - 10<br/>F:  8 -  8 - 16 - 24 - 32 - 40<br/>G:  9 - 18 - 36 - 54 - 72 - 81 <br/>H: 10 - 15 - 20 - 25 - 30 - 40<br/><br/>"}, "130290": {"rpg": {"763": "A Thousand and One Nights: A Game of Enticing Stories"}, "statistics": {}, "name": "Le Mille e Una Notte", "rpgproducer": {"63088": "Michele Gelli"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1652725.jpg", "usersrated": "1", "rpgitemversion": {"179217": "wrap around cover edition"}, "average": "7", "rpggenre": {"278": "Culture (Asian / Far Eastern)"}, "rpgcategory": {"2083": "Core Rules (min needed to play)"}, "poll": {}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1652725_t.jpg", "description": "user summary<br/><br/>The italian edition of the game.

If  possible,  it  will  always  try  to make some sense of input although this may mean that it has to  check that  you really did mean to say what it thinks you meant. For example, you might type in: &quot;Listen to the acrobatic little wombat.&quot; The game will politely(ish) inform you that it  didn't understand all the words you used, but: &quot;Do you want to listen to the wombat? ...Y/N&quot; If you  type 'Y',  then the  noises the  wombat is making will be revealed in all their wonderment. If you type 'N', then  you will be free  to go on and do something more boring.

Covering the period 450AD to 600AD the rule book combine all you need to fight tabletop games and to run a virtually paper-free campaign.<br/><br/>The rules are designed to be played with relatively small forces. A Saxon starter Army is just 38 figures, a British starter army is only 44 figures, both of which can be purchased from our web site in 28mm although the rules play just as well with larger or smaller figures. Forces are grouped into six figures for most warriors and four figures for skirmish and missile troops or cavalry. The tabletop rules are D6 based and simple to use, with the single page playsheet on the rear cover of the rules covering 99% of situations. Activation is determined by a speedy card driven system where all units get to act in any single turn.<br/><br/>Included with the rules is an A3 pull out map of Britian in around 450AD which provides the background setting to the Dux Britanniarum campaign. Your characters start their campaign as a Saxon Lord or a Romano-British Tribune and will attempt to gain fortune and reputation on the battlefield as you fight to defend or conquer a Romano-British kingdom. Included with the rules are four detailed maps which together cover moderd Britain, Wales and lowland Scotland along with an historical background to each kingdom.<br/><br/>A character generation system will add colour to your campaign as your Nobles assume their own personalities.

It's a game in which the theme and the mechanisms of play really tie together. You will guide your Pure Hawaiians, emigrating and settling in the Prologue. In the three main chapters of the game, you will migrate from island to island, vying for control of the islands and their resources such as commerce, aloha and people. You will be able to play event cards based on the history of the islands, and you will elect chiefs and kings and a even a queen. Between chapters you will score victory points and generate the actions necessary for success in the next chapter. In the Epilogue, all of your planning will come to fruition as you try to become elected governor, the most valuable position in the game.<br/><br/>The game takes 10-15 minutes to learn, and 60-90 minutes to play. It is recommended for ages 10 and higher. It plays well for 2,3 or 4 players due to the scaling of the scoring &ndash; to keep all the games tight and fast paced. The theme is inviting and a great experience for hobby gamers and those just getting into euro-style games.<br/><br/>"}, "130353": {"boardgamedesigner": {"8266": {"name": "John Poniske"}}, "average": "6", "poll": {}, "name": "Hugs", "playingtime": "0", "minplayers": "2", "yearpublished": "2012", "usersrated": "1", "maxplayers": "4", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1413631_t.jpg", "boardgameartist": {"63642": "Ella Marcelin"}, "statistics": {}, "boardgamepublisher": {"8007": {"name": "Victory Point Games"}}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1413631.jpg", "boardgameversion": {"179332": "First edition"}, "maxplaytime": "0", "boardgamecategory": {"1041": {"name": "Children's Game"}}, "age": "6", "minplaytime": "0", "description": "Everybody needs a hug now and again!

The coach that handles better his economics, will sign in the new soccer star!<br/><br/>During the match the home team coach gets 6 Attack and 6 Defence cards and the away team coach gets 5 Attack and 5 Defence cards. The home team coach attacks first using one of his Attack cards and the away team coach tries to defend his team using one of his Defence cards. Then the away team coach makes his move using one of his Attack cards and the home team coach uses his Defence cards. Each Attack card describes an event, for example &quot;Injury&quot; or &quot;Goal&quot; or &quot;Penalty&quot; etc. and the Defence cards deactivate the Attack cards. When all attacks have ended, the coach who has scored more goals is the winner.<br/><br/>The game can be played for as many seasons as you like and never ends. Every match is different than the previous and this is what makes this game really exciting! One season lasts about 1 hour.<br/><br/>Man of The Match is a very entertaining, easy-to-play, fast and funny game which can be played by people of all ages.

You will need the Dust Devils print edition or PDF edition to use this game expansion.<br/>The game also requires a standard deck of playing cards and a handful of poker chips or other tokens.<br/><br/>Preliminary Briefing<br/><br/>This game expansion is a role-playing game of espionage in the tradition of Ian Fleming&rsquo;s famous character James Bond and other spy thrillers popular in movies and novels. Players portray super spies, secret agents and even devious masterminds who play a complicated, high-stakes spy game.<br/><br/>Much like its parent game, DUST DEVILS, this game focuses on a crucial character-centric issue. In DUST DEVILS, that issue is the Devil &mdash; will your character &ldquo;shoot or give up the gun?&rdquo; That is, will the Devil get the best of him, or will the character overcome his own faults to be a man the Old West can respect and admire?<br/><br/>Deathwish emphasizes a slightly different theme. Here, the issue is &ldquo;How far will you go for queen and country?&rdquo; Contrary to the James Bond film title, spies do not &ldquo;only live twice.&rdquo; Espionage is dangerous business. This game examines how far an agent is willing to go to risk his own safety for some greater motivation. Deathwish provides a mechanic for that ultimate moment &mdash; when the agent must choose between his mission and his own life.<br/><br/>"}, "130439": {"rpgitemversion": {"179517": "Softcover Version"}, "statistics": {}, "name": "Total Chaos", "rpgproducer": {"11717": "Herbert A.

Three mercenary commands struggled to find their footing and profit from the all-encompassing warfare. As they navigated their way through the conflicts erupting on hundreds of worlds, these mercenaries grew in power, prestige, and character. Facing adversity, victory, defeat, and enemies within and without, they were typical of many commands touched-for ill or for good-by the Jihad. As the Jihad unfolded through the Jihad Hot Spots plotbooks, players were introduced to the Chaos Campaign, a new game play system that gave players the opportunity to craft their own games around specific battles and events of the Jihad. Now that campaign, spanning fourteen years of conflict, has been collected and updated. Presented here are all of the Chaos Campaign tracks from the Hot Spots plotbooks and interwoven with select tracks from the Jihad Turning Points e-publication series and several all-new tracks and mini-campaigns. This volume also includes detailed reports on nearly forty planetary campaigns, providing context and details previously clouded by interstellar media, local reports, and personal journals.

The game is simply won by the first player to find and recover the artifact.<br/><br/>Players take turns rolling the dice, moving &quot;Scouts&quot; throughout the island, collecting jewels and other resources, and unlocking and trading clues.<br/><br/>The game's signature feature is its suspense inducing mechanism for trading clues: before any trade takes place, the two players involved must secretly decide whether to honor or dishonor the trade. Dishonoring a trade gives a player the chance to steal the clue from the other player without giving up his or her own clue, but is risky and can have serious consequences.

Each strand connects any two of eight positions spaced equally around the perimeter of the square, with no two strands sharing edge positions.   The images on the two faces of each tile are mirrors of each other.  In addition to the 144 unique tiles there are 6 single stranded tiles that each appear twice, forming a 150 tile set.  Tiles have a colored background that indicates the number of strand crossings contained on the tile:<br/>Blue - no crosses - 50 tiles, 44 unique<br/>Green - one crossing - 40 unique tiles<br/>Yellow - two crossings - 30 unique tiles<br/>Orange - three crossings - 10 unique tiles<br/>Red - four crossings - 6 unique tiles<br/>Purple - one each of five, six, seven or eight crossings<br/><br/>OBJECT OF GAME:<br/>The object of the game is to have the highest total points when the game ends.<br/><br/>HOW TO SCORE POINTS:<br/>(1) Each player scores points whenever they arrange one or more tiles, alone or in conjunction with other tiles already played, such that some of the strands on the tiles meet up to form a closed loop. Points scored are equal to the number of times the loop crosses itself or any other strand.<br/>(2) Bonus points are awarded when tiles are placed in such a way as to form a ring of tiles enclosing an empty space.  Bonus points scored are equal to the number of free strands pointing into the empty space, but only if it is an even number.<br/><br/>HOW TO PLAY:<br/>1. Each player draws twelve tiles at random from the box.<br/>2. Players attempt to arrange their tiles to form a closed loop. The first to succeed places his loop in the center of the table, counts his score, and then draws enough tiles from the box to return his pile to twelve.<br/>3. Play continues to the left until some player reaches an agreed upon value or until the last tile in the game has been drawn.<br/><br/>RULES OF PLAY:<br/>1. Adjacent tiles must always be placed edge-to-edge and corner to corner, and strands along touching edges must always line up - no dead ends or jogs are allowed.<br/>2. If you cannot build a loop you must forfeit your turn.<br/>3. You may build more than one loop on a single turn, but you cannot place any tile that is not part of a closed loop.<br/>4. If you forfeit your turn you may set aside one or more tiles from your pile and draw new tiles to replace them, returning the others to the box.<br/>5. You may, before placing tiles, swap any tile in your pile with any other tile on the board as long as the swap does not break any closed loop or strand.<br/><br/>"}, "130478": {"statistics": {}, "name": "Bonus Circle", "playingtime": "0", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": {"2072": "Dice Rolling"}, "yearpublished": "1979", "usersrated": "0", "maxplayers": "4", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1418286_t.jpg", "average": "0", "boardgamepublisher": {"3320": {"name": "(Unknown)"}}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1418286.jpg", "boardgameversion": {"179579": "First Edition"}, "maxplaytime": "0", "poll": {}, "age": "7", "minplaytime": "0", "description": "This is a card based game where you roll the dice and travel around the game board collecting cards.

You must now lead what remains of your people safely to Res, the place where your ancestors came from, while simultaneously preserving the Arival, the Soul of the People.<br/><br/>As the Keeper of the Ari people, you must choose a path that allows at least one of your clans to safely reach Res. You build your path as you go by chaining cards, which represent locations you pass in your flight and show which directions you can move to at each step. The cards and how you connect them determine which obstacles, dangers or opportunities you face on your path, and allow you to move on the map and hopefully trace a route from the siege ruins to the place where Res is supposed to be. Different ways may bring advantages or disadvantages, and you must react to what you encounter in a balancing act between saving your people and the Arival.<br/><br/>Scouting ahead gives you some control over where you may go next, and resting allows you to replenish your food reserves or perform rites to strengthen the Arival. But you must be quick, because the enemy Wolfhounds hunt you from behind: if they ever reach you, some of your people must sacrifice themselves to act as baits and lead the hunters away.
