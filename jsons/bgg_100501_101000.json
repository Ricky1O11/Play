You are not a Warrior. You are not a Wizard. You are simply a young lad working at the stables in Port Blacksand, under the care of your guardian-tutor, the stableman.<br/><br/>A kind and goodly fellow, the stableman has looked after you for more than a decade, teaching you to ride and take care of horses. You have worked hard, receiving only meagre wages for your exhausting duties. But you have no complaint, for the stableman, himself, is scratching a living. Nonetheless, you are still well fed and allowed to stay in a small living area above the stables, which is ultimately better than the grubby inns of Blacksand. Best of all, the stables overlook a training ground.<br/><br/>Some time ago, a sergeant of the despicable City Guard, deemed it necessary to train and discipline Lord Azzur's troops. The idea didn't get very far, of course. Most of the soldiers merely lazed around or sat yawning with boredom till each session was over. The sergeant left the city without ever knowing of his greatest pupil.<br/><br/>From a young age, you have dreamt of an adventurous life in the outside world but felt too unprepared. In the time you had to spare, you would constantly spy on the training ground from your window upstairs when a session was in progress. You watched, learned then practiced the art of swordplay and combat manoeuvres in the confines of your room.<br/>  <br/>Years past.<br/> <br/>Now, growing into adulthood, you find that your arduous work has built up your strength and confidence. What's more, you require less sleep to regain energy, and that means more hours to continue your self-training. Soon you will be ready to join the world's heroes on a path of adventure.<br/><br/>"}, "100526": {"poll": [], "name": "A First Class Murder", "playingtime": "180", "minplayers": "6", "boardgamemechanic": ["Role Playing"], "yearpublished": "0", "usersrated": "3", "maxplayers": "8", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1055642_t.jpg", "average": "6.83333", "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["Paul Lamond Games Ltd"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1055642.jpg", "boardgameversion": ["Paul Lamond A First Class Murder"], "maxplaytime": "180", "boardgamecategory": ["Deduction", "Murder/Mystery", "Party Game"], "age": "12", "minplaytime": "180", "description": "Flossie Carrington had it all - she was young and beautiful, she was the heiress to an American steel empire, and she was married to a handsome ex-Guards officer.

For fifteen years you have travelled the width and length of England attempting to use your skills to sell various products. Successful, professional, wealthy, intelligent with good looks and a wicked smile, you have done well in your career and are respected by your colleague's.<br/><br/>As you drive through the storm down the dark country lane in Suffolk you curse your bad luck at being caught in the storm. Wiping your hand across the windscreen that is steaming up you take a quick look at your mobile phone. There us still no call or text message from John. Where is the cottage? It must be around here somewhere?<br/><br/>As you look up from the phone you scream in shock at the pale young woman in the road. The cars headlights light her up and as she throws up her hands across her face you slam down the breaks and turn the car. With a loud screech the car skids across the road and narrowly misses the girl. You scream as the car spins around in full circle and with terrifying speed slides into the embankment and overturns with a crash.<br/><br/>You hit your head on the airbag and feel glass shatter across your face as the car comes to a halt at the bottom of the embankment. In agony you try to unfasten your seat belt and let go of a sudden a cry as you realise your right leg is pinned to the damaged chassis of the car.<br/><br/>&quot;Help me!&quot; you cry above the noise of the car and the storm. In the darkness, alone and afraid you try desperately to get free and suddenly hear your mobile phone. You grasp at the phone and scream for help to the recognisable voice of John. As he asks for directions and you try to give them you feel the signs of nausea and lose consciousness into an inky blackness...<br/><br/>You awake in a warm bed. Facing you is the welcoming face of John and his partner Mirrian. &quot;How are you feeling,&quot; he asks, &quot;You had us worried these last three days&quot;. You look at him in shock, three days. You tell him you have felt better.<br/><br/>&quot;Thank god we found you alive when we did!&quot; Mirrian says quietly. &quot;You have missed some terrible news?&quot; John tells Mirrian to leave her news for now but she hands you a local newspaper.<br/><br/>You read the headline in disbelief and look at the two faces of your friends. Several thousand now dead from plague. Army starts mass vaccination.<br/><br/>&quot;When did all this happen?&quot; you ask.<br/>John tells you that the vaccination program started several days ago. Just after your crash. Unbelievably like some terrible disaster or horror movie the origins of the plague were unknown but the symptoms terrifying. The government had now declared martial law as those perishing from the disease were turning into undead.<br/><br/>Mirrian and John speak to you into the late hours of the evening. They inform you of the plague; how the hospitals are overrun with vacation programs and that a doctor had recommenced you stay at the cottage rather than the city. Vaccinated along with the others you had been left with John who himself is a doctor and his wife.<br/>After discussions of the plague and the crash you are left to sleep until the morning.<br/><br/>"}, "100564": {"poll": [], "name": "Piktee", "playingtime": "0", "minplayers": "3", "boardgamemechanic": ["Set Collection"], "yearpublished": "1900", "usersrated": "1", "boardgamefamily": ["Sports: Football / Soccer"], "maxplayers": "4", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1017492_t.jpg", "average": "4", "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["Glevum Games", "Roberts Brothers Games"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1017492.jpg", "boardgameversion": ["First edition"], "maxplaytime": "0", "boardgamecategory": ["Card Game", "Negotiation", "Sports"], "age": "0", "minplaytime": "0", "description": "A set collecting game.

You spin around and strike the weapon from his hand with an upward swipe of your sword. The dagger spins high into the air. You kick the man in the chest and he falls onto his backside. A second later the dagger lands point-first in the ground between his legs.<br/><br/>He yelps in surprise and his brow glistens in the moonlight as you aim the point of your sword at his throat. &quot;I'm sorry,&quot; he babbles. &quot;B-b-but...&quot;<br/><br/>You lower your sword and tell him with a laugh that if it was gold he sought he only had to ask. You toss him a gold piece. He catches the coin and looks in astonishment at the seal stamped upon it - that of Baron Sukumvit of Fang. &quot;But these,&quot; he exclaims. &quot;These are granted only to one who has survived the Trial...&quot;<br/><br/>You laugh again and sheath your sword. The great riches that you recently acquired in Chiang Mai have indeed come in useful. Gold has bought you everything you ever wanted, except excitement.<br/><br/>Bored with your comfortable dwellings in Chiang Mai you travelled to the city of thieves, Port Blacksand, in search of adventure. Of the many tales you heard in the Black Lobster tavern, one in particular caught your interest. The next day you bought a leaky old boat and sailed down the ruddy waters of the Red River towards the Moonstone Hills. You stopped to buy supplies from the Dwarfs of Stonebridge, along with a sharp new sword. Sailing on you passed the twisted trees of Darkwood Forest and the blood-red peak of Firetop Mountain, before coming to moor at the humble village known as Barn.<br/><br/>The villagers were friendly enough; once they were satisfied you had not arrived on some wicked errand from nearby Darkwood. You quickly found a local man who could help you find what you were looking for. His eyes sparkled at the mention of gold. But his look quickly turned to one of horror when you told him exactly what you were searching for. It took several more coins and several more mugs of ale before he agreed to act as your guide. As night fell the two of you crossed the ferry north and followed a seldom used path by lantern-light, with bleak and lonely hills stretching away on either side, shrouded in moonlit mist.<br/><br/>You have only just arrived at your destination, a neglected graveyard surrounded by a low, crumbling stone wall and a pair of jagged iron gates. The church here apparently burnt down long ago. The rambling headstones that remain have since become so overgrown with weeds and wildflowers that the place has long been known among the locals as, &quot;The Garden of Bones&quot;.<br/><br/>The tale you heard in Port Blacksand concerned events that took place over half a century ago. A warlock named Morbius Kane had struck a bargain with a Demon Prince to forge for him a weapon that would make Kane as mighty on the field of battle as he was in the field of magic. It is said that Kane was a man of great vanity and collected the skulls of his enemies as a way of recording the number of lives he had taken. The Demon knew this and promised Kane a weapon truly worthy of a conqueror such as he, a weapon that would never let him forget the number of lives he had harvested.<br/><br/>The Demon gave Morbius Kane a great spear, carved with runes that glowed like hellfire. The weapon increased its master's ability in combat to such a degree that now not even the mightiest of Kane's warriors could best him. Thus Morbius Kane grew demented with a lust for conquest, seeking more and more skulls to add to his monstrous collection. It was said that Morbius Kane swore upon his Spear that he not rest until he had claimed ten thousand Allansian lives.<br/><br/>He gathered an army of undead beings - Zombies, Skeleton Warriors, Ghouls, Wights and Crypt Stalkers - and with them ravaged the outlying lands. After months of bloodshed, Kane was eventually defeated by the Dwarfs of Stonebridge. In a ferocious battle their hearty leader, Gillibran, smote Kane dead with a blow from his magical hammer. Gillibran brought the Spear of Kane back to Stonebridge for examination. But the weapon was stolen in the night by Kane himself, who had returned from death to reclaim his weapon, bound by his own dreadful oath to claim ten thousand mortal lives.<br/><br/>In the following weeks the villagers of nearby Barn saw ghostly figures wandering the streets at night. Men were found dead, women and children disappeared and word finally reached the wizard Yaztromo in his great tower on the southern edge of Darkwood Forest. The old wizard arrived in Barn and cast a spell that took three days and three nights to perform. In this way he captured the undead Morbius Kane, along with every one of the warlock's followers. Needing a suitable prison in which to house these monsters, Yaztromo bound them within the nearby Garden of Bones, placing a spell around the graveyard that prevented any inside from ever escaping.<br/><br/>Yet legend has it that whenever the full moon shines upon the Garden of Bones its gates swing open once more. Though the undead remain trapped inside, it is possible for the living to enter their shadow realm. Many an adventurer has entered the Garden in search of the fabled Spear of Morbius Kane. None have returned - at least none alive.<br/> <br/>The full moon now shines bright upon the Garden of Bones. A strange fog seems to billow from among the graves. You hear a metallic clink, followed by a slow, grinding creak as the gates swing open to greet you. Your guide scrambles to his feet, gibbering in terror, and dashes back towards the village.<br/><br/>It is said that once a living person enters the Garden of Bones they can never again find their way out. The writhing mist inside has a way of confounding one's sense of direction. But during your visit to Stonebridge you took the precaution of purchasing an enchanted lantern, which will light your way back to the land of the living.<br/><br/>The moon bathes your surroundings with silvery light. The cold mist now curling round your ankles also casts a pale glow. What a tale you will have to tell when you return to Stonebridge holding the legendary Spear of Kane. A sudden shiver ripples down your spine. Then again, it will not do to underestimate the task ahead of you. Gripping the hilt of your sword for reassurance you walk boldly into the Garden of Bones. The gates swing shut behind you like the iron jaws of death.<br/><br/>"}, "100566": {"rpgartist": ["(Uncredited)"], "rpg": ["Fighting Fantasy Gamebooks"], "poll": [], "name": "Grim Holiday", "rpgdesigner": ["Tammy M.

In a rhythmic tune, the<br/>bells chime slowly then quickly. Like a xylophone, each instrument echoes in separate<br/>pounds, vibrant tolling sounds highlighting the festive evening. The temples are alight<br/>with red, green and white lanterns; across the laneway the large tavern has decorated its<br/>walls with the very similar art. The air not only sounds nice but smells of sweet<br/>sandalwood incense. It seems to be yet another year like the last.<br/>You stand there in the winter solstice, listen in, and watch the temple players. A group od<br/>dancers dressed in heavy garb come out and take large steps. They look as though their<br/>acting out a bear or massive beast. They start to dance amidst the onlookers. It has<br/>starting to get colder so you decide to call it a night and return home in the Ming district.<br/>Upon arriving there are soldiers on horseback and one empty horse, its rider is handing<br/>your father a scroll. You hurry into your home as the soldiers depart. You ask what the<br/>scroll is but he ignores you. Your mother tells you that he has been selected to venture<br/>out into the Ice Fingers Mountains. Your father is partially crippled, although he could<br/>walk from one end of Fang to the next there is no chance of his survival hiking the<br/>mountains and possibly a mountain.<br/>That evening and in silence, everyone ate their meal and went to bed. As you step by<br/>your parent&rsquo;s carrying with you a clay lantern with a tiny flame sticking out of the spout<br/>you spy you father practicing Chi. He&rsquo;s moving his hands and legs in perfect unison then<br/>keels over in pain. His hip is hurting him again, and he stays in one spot for some time<br/>until he recovers. He picks up the sword Sukumvit gave to him at the third Trial of<br/>Champions. It is a magnificent piece, with a heart of steel, a head of rubies and<br/>shimmering eyes. The sword looks as though it were made of blue steel. It is nearly light<br/>as a feather. He shakes his head and frowns. You can see him fighting the tears that he&rsquo;s<br/>no longer the champion he used to be.<br/>That night as you lie in bed, you cannot help but feel anxious. You are not trained in the<br/>art of swordsmanship like you father but you do know how to use one, you are not the<br/>proper age since you are only a teenager, and you are the wrong gender but that doesn&rsquo;t<br/>matter to you now. You don&rsquo;t want your father to go. All of these three things could alter<br/>your outcome, but your father is not in faultless shape.<br/>You get up and tiptoe through the chilly house and quietly slide open their door and<br/>sneak the sword and scroll and return to your room. The scroll reads that there is a<br/>danger, unlike any other danger lurking ever closer toward the town. A few selected in<br/>Zengis are setting out to the Ice Finger Mountains to destroy a madman called Father<br/>Grim Holiday who is rumoured to be creating hideous objects for this year&rsquo;s Winter<br/>Festivals, some of which are finding their way down the pass already. You have read<br/>enough. Your father is not going, you reason. Quickly, you go to his wardrobe, and put<br/>on his warrior uniform. Although you do not know what you are doing, you have decided<br/>to guess you way through; it has always worked before, why not now?<br/><br/>"}, "100567": {"rpgdesigner": ["Michael T.

It was the first WWF licensed NES game, meaning it features actual WWF wrestlers as opposed to fictional characters like previous wrestling games. WrestleMania also marked the beginning of a long relationship between Acclaim and the WWF which lasted twelve years.<br/><br/>The game features six wrestlers: Hulk Hogan, Andr&eacute; the Giant, &quot;Macho Man&quot; Randy Savage, The Honky Tonk Man, Bam Bam Bigelow, and &quot;The Million Dollar Man&quot; Ted DiBiase.<br/><br/>Gameplay<br/><br/>All wrestlers possess a limited amount of moves, which comprise of basic standing punches and kicks, headbutts, a running attack, a move off the turnbuckle (which Andr&eacute; the Giant and Bam Bam Bigelow cannot perform), and a bodyslam (which Bam Bam Bigelow and Honky Tonk Man cannot perform). All wrestlers also possess a &quot;back attack&quot; that they can use on an opponent standing behind them (usually a backwards punch). The moves themselves are somewhat tailored to each wrestler (Randy Savage, for example, uses elbow smashes instead of punches, while Bam Bam Bigelow has two running attacks instead of one). It is also worth noting that only Hulk Hogan is able to bodyslam the massive Andr&eacute; the Giant. The wrestlers cannot leave the ring and can only execute turnbuckle attacks from the bottom two corners. Sometimes, while a wrestler is taking punishment, he will turn red, indicating anger. An &quot;angry&quot; wrestler can inflict more damage than normal while in this state. Occasionally, during a match, an icon will come on screen that a wrestler can pick up to gain health. The icons are unique to each wrestler (for example, Honky Tonk Man's looks like a guitar, while Hulk Hogan's looks like a crucifix) and cannot be used interchangeably (wrestlers can only pick up their own icons).<br/><br/>Players can either play a single exhibition match (one player versus the computer or two players head-to-head) or a tournament. In a single player tournament, the player chooses one wrestler and must defeat the other five in a series of matches to win the championship. In a tournament with two or more player-controlled wrestlers (up to six can play), each wrestler faces every other wrestler once (fifteen total matches). At the end of the tournament, the wrestler with the best record wins the championship. In the event of a tie, the wrestler in the tie who achieved the single fastest victory during the tournament will be declared the winner.<br/><br/>In Popular Culture<br/>A scene in the 2008 film The Wrestler features a fictional NES game entitled Wrestle Jam '88.

Las Vegas is a gambling video game produced for the Nintendo Entertainment System and developed by HAL Laboratory that was released in 1988.<br/><br/>General information<br/><br/>Vegas Dream begins with graphics showing the player (or one of the players) arriving at Las Vegas by airplane. Featuring a back-drop of old downtown Las Vegas (with signs featuring thinly veiled references to the Pioneer Club (&quot;Pionee Club&quot; in the game), Binion's Horseshoe and Glitter Gulch), players then choose which to play of the two versions of the game: &quot;Vegas Dream&quot; (storyline version) or &quot;One Spot&quot; (strictly gaming, no storyline). Players then start with a bankrole of $700 at the fictional HAL Palace Hotel, to spend on four games: keno, blackjack, roulette or slot machines. Between rounds of play at the normal casino games, there are randomly occurring social interactions with various characters, such as business people, other patrons, or casino employees (in the &quot;Vegas Dream&quot; version of the game only). These interactions (and the players' responses to them) have different possible results; sometimes the unidentified man is a pickpocket, other times he's just down on his luck and will reward the player for his/her kindness down the road. For whatever reason, the results of interactions are reported on a local Las Vegas news station by a white older male; music with a cheery tone plays for positive happenings, such as the player receiving cash, with more sombre music playing for thefts, injuries, etc.<br/><br/>Vegas Dream also allows the player to date and marry as many members of the opposite sex as you care to; men married a woman named Ms. Sophie while women married a gentleman named Mr. James. However, the marriage(s) don't affect the player's status (apart from the increased cash flow, or perchance the person they married is crooked, a loss of funds from theft).<br/><br/>Vegas Dream includes a password save feature, but the passwords are twenty-six characters long and consist of letters, numbers and symbols making them difficult to record correctly. It is possible to win the game by earning over ten million dollars, at which point the player is seen reclining by a pool with his household staff (assuming the player has moved into a mansion and has hired servants), and then taking a limousine to a show with their partner.<br/><br/>Should the opposite happen - and the player(s) lose all his/her money - the staff at the HAL Palace give the player one final pull on a slot machine in a last ditch effort to win some more money. If the player wins, they get to resume their gaming; if not, the player is bid good bye, and a screen appears showing persons heading towards a plane, ready to depart Las Vegas, ending the game.<br/><br/>Japanese Version<br/><br/>The Japanese version, with gameplay identical to the North American version, uses slightly stronger language in its script and even mentions cigarettes.

The lineup of characters in the game is very close to those appearing in X-Men: Pryde of the X-Men, the only animated incarnation of the X-Men existing prior to the X-Men animated series on Fox.<br/><br/>Gameplay<br/>The object is to use several X-Men characters, each with special powers, to complete a series of missions.

The game required the player to fight their way to the boss in each stage, sometimes requiring the collection of items such as keys. After the boss is defeated, the player has to quickly fight their way back to the beginning of the level before a bomb goes off.

One of the game's criticisms is that the player is forced to choose one of two directions in which to chase the boss. If the player guesses wrong, they have to fight their way to the beginning again and head the other way. Adding to the game's frustration was the fact that the final level could only be accessed with a secret code, which is never hinted at in the game nor in the manual, but rather is merely discreetly printed on the game cartridge's label.<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;The Uncanny X-Men (video game)&quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "100606": {"poll": [], "name": "Numan Athletics", "videogamemode": ["Local Multiplayer", "Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["NA Arcade Edition", "Virtual Console Edition"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1560018.png", "videogametheme": ["Sports - Track & Field"], "usersrated": "0", "videogamedeveloper": ["Namco Ltd."], "videogamegenre": ["Sports"], "videogameplatform": ["Arcade", "Wii"], "average": "0", "statistics": [], "videogamepublisher": ["Namco Ltd."], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1560018_t.png", "description": "Source: Wikipedia, &quot;Numan athletics&quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>Numan Athletics (\u30cb\u30e5\u30fc\u30de\u30f3\u30a2\u30b9\u30ec\u30c1\u30c3\u30af\u30b9?) is an action sports-type arcade game released by Namco in 1993.

OutRunners succeeded in doing this; it brought back the ability to take different paths through forks in the road, returned to a lighthearted atmosphere, and distanced itself well from the &quot;serious&quot; Turbo Outrun. The game featured head-to-head support, and with enough cabinets, up to eight players could challenge each other.

OutRunners was also known for having some of the best looking graphics seen at the time, thanks to creative sprite design and a very skillful use of parallax scrolling, similar to that found in Power Drift, released four years earlier. The game holds up very well today, and plays very similarly to a modern polygon based 3D racer, something not common in a racing game that utilises 2D graphics.<br/><br/>Unlike the original Out Run, some stages are accessible on more than one route combination. After the initial starting stage, the player has the option of either turning east or west. West leads through San Francisco, through the Easter Islands, into Asia and either into Africa or Europe.

In fact, at the time of its creation the company was still known as &quot;Shin Nihon Kikaku&quot;. The game is also known as the second ever vertical shoot 'em up game, after Taito's Space Invaders (which ran on the same arcade hardware), but is also additionally known as the first game with disparate &quot;levels&quot;. The game is also notable for being the first action game to feature a supply of energy, resembling a life bar, a mechanic that has now become common in the majority of modern action games. The game allowed the player to refuel energy between each level, and it featured a large variety of alien enemies. Many of the game's concepts would later be further developed in Sega's Astro Blaster, Sierra On-Line's Threshold, and Activision's Megamania.<br/><br/>The player controls a space ship which most fend off UFO's, meteors, and comets. Instead of lives, the player is given an energy reserve that is constantly decrementing; getting hit by the enemy causes gameplay to stop momentarily while a large amount of energy is depleted. Every so often, a mothership will appear and dock with the player's spacecraft, causing the energy to be refilled. There are 3-4 recognizable &quot;stages&quot; as the game progresses and new enemies begin to appear. After these, the re-filling ship will appear, and the cycle will start over; this occurs indefinitely.<br/><br/>There are two known bootleg versions of this game called Space Phantoms and Solar Flight. In Space Phantoms the player's ship looks like an angel, and the enemies appear as different types of insects. Due to the game being monochrome and a conversion kit for Space Invaders, many Ozma Wars monitors still utilized the Space Invaders color overlay.<br/><br/>"}, "100617": {"poll": [], "name": "Othello Derby", "videogamemode": ["Local Multiplayer", "Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["JP Arcade Edition"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1560033.png", "videogametheme": ["Abstract", "Sports - Horse Riding"], "usersrated": "0", "videogamedeveloper": ["Tsukuda Hobby / Original"], "videogamegenre": ["Classic Games", "Racing"], "videogameplatform": ["Arcade"], "average": "0", "statistics": [], "videogamepublisher": ["Tsukuda Hobby / Original"], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1560033_t.png", "description": "User Summary<br/><br/>A game where you play Othello to take squares.

All the animals were docile. Humans, Sandras, Quarkmen, Tattas, and other races mingled with one another and worked to make Marvel Land into an increasingly beautiful place to live. A large clock tower resembling a stone grandfather clock stood watch over the countryside of Marvel Land. Long ago, an ancient evil had been sealed within the clock tower. The people needn't fret, however. For those days had long since passed, or so they had thought.<br/><br/>The key of time that rested in the center of the face of the clock tower had long since been used to seal away the ancient evil that lies within. Until one day, the clock tower mysteriously stopped working. In an effort to rewind the clock, a villager takes it upon himself to do just that. Fumbling with the key, the villager drops the key of time, foolishly. In a frantic manner, the villager picks up the key and tries to reset it back into place before a catastrophe befalls Marvel Land. But then, it was too late for the villager to accomplish the task. The ancient evil of legend. Zouna, the Dark Wizard who manipulates time itself was unleashed upon the world once more. And to prevent anyone else from sealing him away once again, Zouna takes the key of time for himself.<br/><br/>Finally freed after many years, Zouna wastes no time in wreaking havoc and chaos over Marvel Land. Zouna unleashes his manifested darkness over the land, and lays waste to the countryside. Feeling confident in his reign, Zouna constructs his castle in which to preside over Marvel Land from. The peaceful inhabitants of Marvel Land cried out in terror as Zouna's manifested darkness came after them one by one. Zouna's darkness corrupted the hearts of anyone it came across, and possessed them against their wills. Once thriving towns and villages fell into ruination. Family members were parted from their loved ones. Only a few scattered towns remained standing; forming a last bastion in resistance to Zouna's dark invasion. A futile effort. Even Krino Sandra (known as Whirlo in Europe) would come to meet his heroic demise, subdued by Zouna's power. Marvel Land is in dire need of a savior.<br/><br/>The desperate call has been answered by the heavens. Valkyrie, a fledgling shield maiden descends to Marvel Land from heaven. Her first adventure, she wields a simple shield and a mace of light. Vowing to save Marvel Land from the darkness that has consumed it. Then her adventure begins.<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;Valkyrie no B\u014dken: Toki no Kagi Densetsu&quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "100645": {"poll": [], "name": "Tsuppari \u014czum\u014d", "videogamemode": ["Local Multiplayer", "Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["Japanese Famicom edition", "Nintendo 3DS Virtual Console (NES) edition", "Wii Virtual Console edition (NES)"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1698371.png", "videogameseries": ["Tsuppari \u014czum\u014d"], "videogametheme": ["Sports - Wrestling"], "usersrated": "0", "videogamedeveloper": ["Tecmo, Ltd."], "videogamegenre": ["Sports"], "videogameplatform": ["NES", "Nintendo 3DS", "Wii"], "average": "0", "statistics": [], "videogamepublisher": ["Tecmo, Ltd."], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1698371_t.png", "description": "Tsuppari \u014czum\u014d (\u3064\u3063\u3071\u308a\u5927\u76f8\u64b2?, Shoving sumo) is a sumo video game developed and published by Tecmo for the Family Computer, which was released exclusively in Japan in 1987.<br/><br/>In 2007, Tsuppari \u014czum\u014d was released for the Wii Virtual Console.<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;Tsuppari \u014czum\u014d&quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "100646": {"poll": [], "name": "Challenger (1985/NES)", "videogamemode": ["Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["Japanese Famicom edition", "Nintendo 3DS Virtual Console (NES) edition", "Wii Virtual Console edition (NES)"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1659711.png", "videogametheme": ["Fantasy", "Historical"], "usersrated": "0", "videogamedeveloper": ["Hudson Soft"], "videogamegenre": ["Action", "Platform"], "videogameplatform": ["NES", "Nintendo 3DS", "Wii"], "average": "0", "statistics": [], "videogamepublisher": ["Hudson Soft"], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1659711_t.png", "description": "Challenger (\u30c1\u30e3\u30ec\u30f3\u30b8\u30e3\u30fc, Charenj\u0101?) is a video game developed and published by Hudson Soft in 1985 for the Nintendo Famicom.<br/><br/>The title character, Challenger, is an archaeologist who seeks to rescue the princess, Maria, from the hands of the evil boss, Don Waldorado, in the land called Pleasio Land.

Players must therefore either adapt to new customs, or work to ensure that the existing customs remain in place. As you navigate your way to greatness and victory, you will find yourself arranging marriages, earning titles, erecting grand structures, and fighting alongside your fellow Houses as foreign nations invade the kingdom, but in the end only one house will be celebrated in the history books.

The Family Computer version of Field Combat was later released for the Wii's Virtual Console service exclusively in Japan on June 12, 2007.<br/><br/>The object of the game is to make it all the way to the end of the battlefield using the Genesis; a warship that can fire off missiles. While the player controls the blue forces, the player must defeat the Red forces without dying in the process by either avoiding or shooting helicopters, infantrymen, and tanks. An interesting characteristic of the game is that it is possible to ask for reinforcements from an army, which the player possesses, by pressing both the A and B buttons at the same time. Whenever the player runs out of units to aid him in battle, he can use his special weapon to &quot;absorb&quot; the enemies and add them to his army.<br/><br/>The game used Richard Wagner's Ride of the Valkyries as its background music. There is also an enemy UFO like spaceship that, when in battlefield, attempts to grab and escape with a player friendly unit (if there is any on the battlefield).<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;Field Combat&quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "100650": {"poll": [], "name": "Super Caesar's Palace", "videogamemode": ["Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["NA Sega Genesis Version", "NA SNES Version"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1153956.jpg", "videogameseries": ["Caesar's Palace"], "videogametheme": ["Card / Casino Games"], "usersrated": "2", "videogamedeveloper": ["Virgin Interactive Entertainment Inc."], "videogamegenre": ["Simulation"], "videogameplatform": ["SEGA Genesis", "SNES"], "average": "9", "statistics": [], "videogamepublisher": ["Majesco Entertainment"], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1153956_t.jpg", "description": "User Summary<br/><br/>Super Caesar's Palace is the sequel to the 1992 game Caesar's Palace.

This is first wrestling game to feature a play-by-play announcer, the animated Tom Talker, although his speech was only text bubbles. The game's text, e.g. Tom Talker's commentary, was translated from the Japanese game almost directly, leading to instances of Engrish. For example the Northern Lights Suplex is called &quot;Northern Right Suplex&quot;. The game was released in Japan under the name Gekitou Pro Wrestling!! Toukon Densetsu (\u6fc0\u95d8\u30d7\u30ed\u30ec\u30b9!! \u95d8\u9b42\u4f1d\u8aac)<br/><br/>Gameplay<br/>Tecmo World Wrestling contains more than 20 moves per wrestler, by virtue of not having a dedicated grapple button. Instead, a grapple is initiated whenever the wrestlers walk into each other, and from there, combinations of the joypad and buttons can be used to perform a variety of holds and slams. There are also many situational moves (such as ground attacks, high-risk top-rope aerial attacks, and running attacks) to perform.<br/><br/>In addition, the game was perhaps the first to feature action replays: when certain signature moves are performed on a weakened wrestler, the game introduces a quick cut-scene, showing the move being performed, as if in a close-up television replay.<br/><br/>Matches can be won by a standard three-count pinfall, submission, or by count-out (if a wrestler is tossed out of the ring, a twenty count starts, and if either wrestler is still outside of the ring when the count ends, they're disqualified). In the single-player game, if both wrestlers are counted out, it counts as a loss for the player.<br/><br/>The single-player mode consists of defeating all of the other wrestlers in the game with your chosen wrestler. Between matches, the player is given an option to train; through button mashing exercises, the player performs either squats, situps, or push-ups (with a sumo wrestler on his back). When the meter measuring your progress in training fills up, a sphere above the meter (seven in total) fills up. The more training you do, the more damage your moves will do during a match. Once all seven spheres fill up, you cannot train any further; however, if you lose a match against an opponent, you will lose a sphere, and you must train again to regain it. When all of the other wrestlers are defeated, the player must overcome the challenge of the non-playable final boss, &quot;The Earl of Doom&quot; Blue King, before winning the game.<br/><br/>Two-player mode in Tecmo World Wrestling features the same gameplay as the single-player game. Each player selects a wrestler (the game prevents the same character being chosen for both players) and then proceed directly into the match. The most notable difference from the single-player game is the addition of a momentum meter onscreen that rapidly swings back and forth between both players. This meter determines which player will have the advantage in a grappling situation.<br/><br/>Japanese Version<br/>The Japanese version of the game, released as Gekitou Pro Wrestling!! Toukon Densetsu has some notable differences from the western release. It was released a year earlier and has a password feature. The announcer is also different, sporting black hair and more Japanese looking facial features, his name according to the Japanese manual is Yasushi Geki. The female personal trainer also sports black hair<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;Tecmo World Wrestling&quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "100683": {"poll": [], "name": "Dwyn", "playingtime": "0", "minplayers": "2", "yearpublished": "0", "usersrated": "2", "maxplayers": "6", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1020100_t.jpg", "average": "3", "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["(Unknown)"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1020100.jpg", "boardgameversion": ["First Edition"], "maxplaytime": "0", "boardgamecategory": ["Card Game"], "age": "0", "minplaytime": "0", "description": "A card game containing 6 different welsh characters broken up into a head, a torso, and feet.

This debut was soon followed by with conversions to a number of popular Japanese computers in the early 1980s, including the NEC's line of PCs and the Fujitsu FM series. As a puzzle game, it was well suited to these early systems since it didn't require a tremendous amount of graphical sophistication. Ports for the MSX computer line and the Nintendo Famicom were released in 1985. DB-Soft produced a sequel with more difficult puzzles called King Flappy for the benefit of anyone who managed to clear the original 200 levels. A Nintendo Game Boy port was released exclusively in Japan in 1990 and was published by Victor Musical Industries. Over time, Flappy has continued to see many graphically improved upgrades, such as on the Windows platform and on several mobile phone devices. It was released on Japan's Virtual Console in 2007.<br/><br/>Two officially-unreleased variants of Flappy, Floppy and Beyond Floppy, were programmed by Greg Hale and Ted Cohn for the Apple II platform.[3] Floppy featured special names for each of the game's levels.

Academy of Champions features arcade-style soccer, focusing on tricks, shooting, and the whimsical nature of the academy. It has received a 65.22% on review aggregate website GameRankings.<br/><br/>Gameplay<br/><br/>Academy of Champions has a main story mode and a supplemental quick-play mode to allow the user to play a single match by themselves or with a friend. The story mode takes place at Brightfield Academy, a magical soccer academy featuring Pel&eacute; and Mia Hamm in cartoon form as the masters of the academy. The player is tasked with putting together a five player soccer team to compete in the academy's soccer league. The user can improve his team by recruiting other players outside of his starting five and by training his players with minigames. Characters from other Ubisoft franchises such as the Prince of Persia and Rayman Raving Rabbids appear as help and opponents to the characters.<br/><br/>The game uses little motion controls; the A and B buttons on the Wii remote are used to pass and kick, and other actions are handled by the control pad on the Wii remote and the controls on the nunchuck. The minigames are drills in between matches that help the player hone certain skills. One minigame makes use of the Wii Balance Board to dribble around obstacles, and the game features limited Wii MotionPlus support.

When you register, you decide if you fight as a Christian Crusader, Muslim Saracen or Pagan.<br/><br/>Through assaults, plundering and protecting you will gain experience points. If you reach a certain number of experience points, you rise up to a higher level. To become a better fighter, you not only need a weapon, a shield, a helmet, armour and a horse, but you also have to train your property values and those of your horse (if you have one) upwards. To do this, you need gold coins. To get the gold coins, you can work, plunder, protect or fight.<br/><br/>You can also earn many pieces of gold by recruiting new warriors! To do this, use your own link, which you can find under Status &gt; Diplomacy. Send this link to your friends, put it on your website (you can find banners under 'Download') or use it as a signature for your forum contributions. If somebody clicks on your link and registers at Holy-War within 30 minutes of clicking the link, you will recruit a new warrior! From then on, you will always receive 10% of the gold coins that your recruited warrior wins in warrior vs. warrior fights or in order battles. The 10% is an extra bonus for you! Your recruited warrior will not be charged or put at a disadvantage by being your recruit. Additionally, everytime one of your recruits redeems a ticket you receive 3 days premium status.

It was the final game released by HAL Laboratory as an independent third-party developer before their buy-out by Nintendo. The game's story and character designs were done by manga artist Yoshimiru Hoshi, who loosely based the game on his 1984 manga Ak&ucirc;tens&ocirc; Fixallia\u200b (\u4e9c\u7a7a\u8ee2\u9a12\u30d5\u30a3\u30af\u30b5\u30ea\u30a2, Ak\u016btens\u014d Fikusaria?).<br/><br/>The game's development took more than four years to complete, with graphics and sounds that pushed the Family Computer's hardware to its limit, requiring the need for an 8-megabit cartridge (the largest for any Family Computer game) and the use of a specialized chip known as the MMC5 to render its graphics. However, by the time the game was released, the Super Famicom was already on the market and sales for the game were not enough to cover its advertising budget, which ended Hal Laboratory's business as an independent game publisher. It has since become a sought-after collector's item in the secondhand market due to its quality and its rarity.[1] The game was remade for the Super Famicom on November 29, 2000 under the title of Metal Slader Glory: Director's Cut, which featured improved graphics and sounds, as well as new scenes.

I'm very pleased with them, but this may mean that the description here will change. - Alex<br/><br/>SEVEN WEEKS is a 2 to 3 player Euro-style war game that aims to recreate the maneuvering, bloodshed, and events of the Austro-Prussian War of 1866 in the German and Bohemian theaters. (The Italian front is also represented as an influence upon forces available and overall morale.)<br/><br/>Players represent the Prussians and their North German allies, the Bavarian and Federal German forces (including Baden, Hesse Darmstadt, Nassau, and Wurttemburg amongst others) , and the Habsburgs (who also control the Saxons, Hanoverians, and Kurhessen/Hesse-Kassel forces). The Bavarian and Habsburg forces must work together to stop the Prussians from achieving the historical victory - a crushing blow for the Habsburgs, a defeat for independent states in Germany, and the beginning of a long era of Prussian hegemony over German affairs.<br/><br/>The game utilizes hand management and card driven mechanics. The map is a traditional hex map, depicting major population centers, fortresses, and rail lines. The combat system uses a system of &quot;tactical cards&quot; and battlefield deployment, implementing some fresh ideas intended to represent the player's role as the commander in chief of a military establishment and the necessity of relying upon the battlefield doctrine practiced by his/her forces. Prussian forces, for example, heavily rely upon open order formation and &quot;Schnellfeuer&quot; technique, while the Habsburgs are fond of the &quot;Stosstaktik&quot; approach and rely upon a superior artillery arm. The game is completely diceless.<br/><br/>The aim is to produce an exciting wargame that can easily be played within two hours. The game is currently in playtesting, and hoping for a &quot;Sooner than Later&quot; publication date as we look for a publisher.<br/><br/>"}, "100804": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1130557.jpg", "poll": [], "boardgamedesigner": ["Sean Scott Garrity"], "statistics": [], "yearpublished": "2011", "maxplayers": "6", "boardgameartist": ["James Van Niekerk"], "boardgamepublisher": ["Baksha Games"], "maxplaytime": "120", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1130557_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "120", "boardgamecategory": ["Expansion for Base-game"], "description": "In Evil Doctors and an Angry Mob, an expansion for Good Help, evil doctors get special abilities and several townspeople are added to the action card deck.

Host Phil Keoghan provided voice acting throughout the entire game.<br/><br/>Players get to customize their own characters and can race against other, pre-made characters. These existing teams are showcased in the opening, which closely mirrors the actual show's opening (including the use of the same music). However, when playing the actual game, no-one, not even the player, is referred to by name. Instead, teams are differentiated by color (ex. team yellow).<br/><br/>The rules of the race are fairly similar to the actual race. Teams receive money, fly to a location and complete various tasks. The last team to arrive is eliminated, unless they are saved by a non-elimination leg. However, teams all leave the Pit Stop at the same time. The tasks are represented by a large collection of minigames.<br/><br/>Some of the clues had changes to their rules. The Detour and Roadblock retain their rules, although there is no limit on individual Roadblocks. Fast Forwards appear in the race, but they are not optional. Instead, the team that completes it fastest gets a 2 hour time credit. Also featured alongside the Detour and Roadblock is the Intersection. However, the Intersection's rules are drastically different. It is a task that all teams complete, similar to an additional task on the real race.<br/><br/>The Yield, U-Turn, Speed Bump and Express Pass are not featured in this game.<br/><br/>As an added bonus, completing various tasks and doing certain objectives in the game will unlock &quot;video files.&quot; These are selected clips from the actual American TV show.

It was Atari's fourth game after Pong, Space Race, and Pong Doubles. This was the first maze arcade game, as well as the very first video game to cause a considerable amount of controversy, predating other early examples such as Death Race by several years. The object of the game is for two players to find their way through an on-screen maze, attempting to catch each other. The controversy stemmed from the perception that the game's controls, rather than joysticks, were pink rubber bulges meant to represent breasts. The bulges were squeezed in order to control the action. This was done because some members of Atari jokingly mentioned that joysticks curiously resembled a phallus. As a result, it was decided to create a &quot;female game&quot; and this game was henceforth referred to as &quot;the boob game&quot; by company staff. Later versions of the cabinet replaced the controls with standard joysticks.
