Some play quickly, where you can get a final score with relative ease.  Some are more complex, giving the gamer a more 'head coach' feel.  I'd like to think that Diggin Deep Football falls somewhere in between, and is the perfect game for the Fantasy Football fan.  You can very easily take your fantasy football roster, plug it into Diggin Deep Football, and play a full game of football with full stats in about 60-90 minutes.  It adds an extra dimension to the Fantasy Football craze.<br/><br/>Gameplay is smooth and should be easy to pick up.  Plays should normally take only one roll of the dice to resolve a play.  Before the play, the offense calls the play and the players involved.  The defense attempts to 'call' the play as well.  If they are correct, penalties go against whoever handles the ball.  If they are wrong, the play proceeds as normal with no penalty to the ball handler.  Think Tecmo Bowl from the old Nintendo days, when you called the right play on defense, you got to blitz the QB.  The better your defense 'calls' the play, the better the end result will be for the defense in Diggin Deep Football.<br/><br/>My vision for Diggin Deep Football would be as a great fit for the casual football fan who loves fantasy football.  Anyone can play a game right out of the box and play with stock teams.  Since the game is played with cards instead of team sheets, you can mix and match players across different teams (like Fantasy Football.  The game also can cater to the more hardcore football fan.  When do you put 'Nine in the Box' against a team who relies heavily on the run, or maybe try to fool the defense by setting up a screen with your backup Tight End.  Diggin Deep Football should have something for everyone.<br/><br/>Diggin Deep Football also has some of the aspects that have become the flagship of any Diggin Deep Sports product.  The more talented players can 'Dig Deep' in certain game situations to tilt the scales in their favor.  Imagine TRYING to play defense against a Jim Brown who is Diggin Deep.  How about trying to convert a 3rd and 12 against a Bears Line backing Core that is Diggin Deep?  The Diggin Deep methodology is not only limited to 'skilled' positions.  Anyone on the offense and defense (including offensive lineman), can dig deep in certain game situations.  The Check the Deck is back as well.

The storied history of Chumahassee County reaches back to colonial days when the first settlement of white folk were killed by the Chumahassee Indians, but eventually the Indians were driven...eh...relocated...into The Notch....a rocky barren valley of little worth until the 1950s.<br/><br/>Later during the civil war, Chumahassee County saw exactly one battle; The Battle of the Lost Armies. There is some debate about the specifics, but apparently a Union battalion got lost in the mountains, while a Confederate battalion got lost in the forests. They met in the swamps, fought each other, and by all accounts died mostly from disease and &lsquo;gators.<br/><br/>There is a monument in the town of Two Guns for the only boy from Chumahassee County to die during World War I.<br/>He fought for the Germans.<br/><br/>Black Friday and the Great Depression had absolutely no effect on the county...everyone was dirt poor to begin with. Still, it sounded pretty scary to everyone, but most people spent their time discussing prohibition over jugs of moonshine.<br/><br/>The roaring 30s roared right past Chumahassee County.<br/><br/>World War II was quite and exciting time for Chumahassee County. A factory making rivets for the M3 Lee Tank opened just outside of Doghouse Junction. When it turned out that a riveted tank was no good, the factory closed much to everyone&rsquo;s dismay. A bunch of boys went off to war, but only one came back and he became a local legend and hero, opening the first and only car dealership in the county, right in the county seat of Roachtown, which is still owned by the family to this very day.<br/><br/>The 1950s brought prosperity to Chumahassee in the form of US Route 125, an interstate highway. Several gas stations opened up, along with restaurants, and eventually fast food joints, and the off ramp sprawled into the largest town of Chumahassee County, the pride and joy, Beaver Lick.<br/><br/>Of interest, the US 125 was routed through The Notch, and the Chumahassee Indians became wealthy selling useless pieces of Native American crap at road side stands.<br/><br/>Radio made it&rsquo;s first appearance in the county when station WRNG opened for business in 1964, in Beaver Lick, playing rock and roll music. The station was burned down within a week. A couple of months later, it reopened again, this time playing country and western. For years, it was the most successful business in the county.<br/><br/>County supervisors banned disco music during the 1970s. No one objected and it&rsquo;s still banned today.<br/><br/>The 1980s to today brought attention to the county. A hiker lost on the Happaleechia Trail caught a Big Foot on video tape and it brought hoards of paranormal hunters to the county. Word got out about the natural hidden splendor, the local history, and color, and now the county is overrun with god-damn tourists, hippies looking to get baked in the woods, and Yankee hunters every spring and summer.

Many from the Round Table have set out on the most Holy of quests, even recovering the Grail of Christ, not a cup but a stone of an unearthly green glow.

While created to serve humanity, those in charge were fearful of a race of sentient machines and so never shared the secret of how the process worked to create more thinking robots, nor the location of manufacture. Despite this, robots were treated more or less as equals among men.<br/><br/>With the machines at their side, humanity was able to colonize the moons, putting permanent settlements on the Arest, and outposts on Unaro, and even putting robotic installations out as far as an asteroid belt. Millions of sentient machines existed among the humans for hundreds of years.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, as all living creatures have their time to exist, they must also pass into extinction. Humanity, already showing signs of decreased fertility, finally came to the point where no more human children were born, and the last generation of man came to pass. A select group of people numbering nearly 100,000 were chosen for genetic health, intelligence, and education, and were frozen in cryo-storage, while the machines were tasked to find a cure or some other answer to bring humanity back into the light of the sun.<br/><br/>Not all has gone well. More than 300 years have passed since the last human walked on Korsuth, and the robots are no closer to solving the problem. In the meantime, a form of robotic civilization arose with it&rsquo;s own separate nations and factions, and much of the world has returned to the wild with such vast expanses unpopulated by man or machine. Tragically, with no way to replicate themselves, the robots are also dying off as accident, violence, or malfunction dwindles their numbers. The robots are staring down the same failed path that humanity recently trod.<br/><br/>Stepping out into this violent and uncertain world are robots who are finding new purpose from that which they were created originally to do. Most continue in their roles, but some have given up the old ways and seek the answers to the salvation of the two races. Some work to find a cure for humanity, and some search out for the way to create more like themselves. Others wander the planet looking for enlightenment the way the humans of old would often do.

While created to serve humanity, those in charge were fearful of a race of sentient machines and so never shared the secret of how the process worked to create more thinking robots, nor the location of manufacture. Despite this, robots were treated more or less as equals among men.<br/><br/>With the machines at their side, humanity was able to colonize the moons, putting permanent settlements on the Arest, and outposts on Unaro, and even putting robotic installations out as far as an asteroid belt. Millions of sentient machines existed among the humans for hundreds of years.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, as all living creatures have their time to exist, they must also pass into extinction. Humanity, already showing signs of decreased fertility, finally came to the point where no more human children were born, and the last generation of man came to pass. A select group of people numbering nearly 100,000 were chosen for genetic health, intelligence, and education, and were frozen in cryo-storage, while the machines were tasked to find a cure or some other answer to bring humanity back into the light of the sun.<br/><br/>Not all has gone well. More than 300 years have passed since the last human walked on Korsuth, and the robots are no closer to solving the problem. In the meantime, a form of robotic civilization arose with it&rsquo;s own separate nations and factions, and much of the world has returned to the wild with such vast expanses unpopulated by man or machine. Tragically, with no way to replicate themselves, the robots are also dying off as accident, violence, or malfunction dwindles their numbers. The robots are staring down the same failed path that humanity recently trod.<br/><br/>Stepping out into this violent and uncertain world are robots who are finding new purpose from that which they were created originally to do. Most continue in their roles, but some have given up the old ways and seek the answers to the salvation of the two races. Some work to find a cure for humanity, and some search out for the way to create more like themselves. Others wander the planet looking for enlightenment the way the humans of old would often do. All this is to say nothing of those robots who have taken sides in the new nations and continue to fight and defend and engage in conflict over resources or perceived insults. The robots are not much different from humans who gave them life...<br/><br/>This is the future imperfect, where technology is both failing and the only source of survival.<br/><br/>"}, "133201": {"rpgitemversion": {"186855": "PDF version"}, "statistics": {}, "name": "We the People", "rpgproducer": {"30814": "Brent Wolke"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1464791.png", "usersrated": "0", "average": "0", "rpggenre": {"961": "Fantasy"}, "rpg": {"1402": "Risus: The Anything RPG"}, "rpgcategory": {"2107": "Campaign Setting (game world)"}, "poll": {}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1464791_t.png", "description": "From Introduction:<br/><br/>We the People is a role-playing game set during the War of Independence; the American Revolution.

Just about every other game to feature a track creation system has followed the standard system of including a track editor, which means having to spend maybe an hour or more designing a single track, and then having to save to a data disk, and then physically sending it to anyone who wanted to see your stunning creation. Days, or even weeks, might pass before anyone ever tried your circuits or designs.

The bucket is placed in the middle of the table, within easy reach of all players. Each player has a glass filled with the same type beer that is in the bucket. Players take turns pouring small amounts of their beer inside the floating glass. Usually players agree on a minimum height from which the beer must be poured into the Biz. Also, it is generally acknowledged that just a drop or two of beer are not enough to satisfy one's turn requirement. In case of any ambiguity in this sense, all the other players vote to decide whether or not a pour was enough. If it is decided that the active player did not pour the minimum amount, the active player must pour again before his turn is over.<br/><br/>The player who sinks the Biz must recover it from the bucket and drink all of its content. After that, the Biz is placed back in the bucket, players' glasses are refilled, and the process is repeated. Players may drop out of the game at any time. The game is over when only one player remains in the game. That player is the winner.<br/><br/>The game allows for limited strategic decisions. The main strategy is to fill the Biz as much as possible during one's turn, to make it more likely for the next player to sink the Biz. This is, however, a calculated risk, as the player attempting this technique may end up pouring too much beer and sinking the Biz as a result.<br/><br/>"}, "133228": {"statistics": {}, "name": "SuperCars International", "videogamemode": {"2422": "Local Multiplayer"}, "videogameversion": {"186896": "United Kingdom DOS Edition"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1465902.png", "videogametheme": {"2456": "Driving"}, "usersrated": "0", "average": "0", "videogamegenre": {"2314": "Arcade"}, "videogameplatform": {"4714": "DOS"}, "poll": {}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1465902_t.png", "description": "Box Blurbs<br/><br/>A good, old-fashioned racing game with the added bonus of an excellent management sim.<br/><br/>Hit Names Hit Games<br/><br/><br/>     Choose from 21 drivers and speed along the tracks of 21 different countries.<br/><br/><br/><br/>     Trade and barter for the best equipped car on the track.<br/><br/><br/><br/>     Fast and smooth action through Full, Racing or Battle modes.<br/><br/><br/><br/>     Seven super slick racing seasons.<br/><br/><br/>No frills just rock solid thrills!<br/><br/>"}, "133229": {"statistics": {}, "name": "Superbike Challenge", "videogamemode": {"2422": "Local Multiplayer"}, "videogameversion": {"186898": "United States Commodore 64"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1465896.png", "videogametheme": {"2456": "Driving"}, "usersrated": "0", "average": "0", "videogamegenre": {"2154": "Racing"}, "videogameplatform": {"4420": "Commodore 64"}, "poll": {}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1465896_t.png", "description": "Back of Box<br/><br/>Race on 12 of the world's most exciting Grand Prix courses!<br/><br/>Your 1000cc Superbike growls and rumbles beneath you...the starter's flag slices through the air...and off you roar on the ride of your life.<br/><br/>In Superbike Challenge, you'll race at heartpounding speeds of up to 200 mph as you battle to take--and hold--the lead against superb riders.<br/><br/>Challenge a friend.

Underneath Obelisk Park, a small dog park in the wealthiest neighborhood in the city, was a hidden high-security lab working on bio-toxins that would make enemies go crazy. After the Cold War ended, the lab was closed up and abandoned, its experiments put inside locked vaults. Hardly anyone remembered it was there, until the dogs started howling.<br/><br/>About a week ago, visitors to the park started seeing their dogs act funny. They would get angry, bark and growl, and then break their leashes to run wild. &ldquo;The pack&rdquo; is now refusing to leave the park and defending their turf with tooth and claw, howling with rage. Scientists have visited the site and believe that the dogs drank contaminated water that had seeped up from one of the experiments in the lab below. Your mission, should you choose to accept it, is to get into the lab and stop the leak without being noticed by the rich, influential, and na&iuml;ve residents of the neighborhood.<br/><br/>Character Creation<br/>Standard Risus character creation rules apply. No hooks or tales -- your agents are people of mystery, with nothing to tie them to anyone else and nothing to lose. Pumping clich&eacute;s is allowed, but no double-pumps.<br/><br/>Characters should be appropriate for the mission team. Some good clich&eacute;s would be veterinarian, safe cracker, biologist, construction worker, master of disguise, politician, etc.<br/><br/>At least one character, possibly more, should have a clich&eacute; like &ldquo;I planned for that&rdquo;, to represent just how amazing the planning of such a team can be &mdash; they can anticipate even the most bizarre plot twists. This clich&eacute; can be used to come up with the proper response to an unexpected situation, such as &ldquo;remembering&rdquo; to have the right logo painted on the team\u02bcs van. By its nature, this is always an appropriate clich&eacute;.<br/><br/>Special Rules<br/>To better emulate a certain 60\u02bcs TV show, the adventure is to be run in two separate phases. During the planning phase, the characters are given all the known information about the situation and any maps the GM chooses to draw. They may do research or visit the park to make clich&eacute; rolls against target numbers to discover the hidden information about the lab. The players should use this phase to plan &ldquo;the job&rdquo; in as much detail as they please.<br/><br/>During the action phase, the team puts their plan into action. Any remaining hidden information will come out as the characters encounter it during the job. The GM should make sure that not everything goes off without a hitch, of course. If they made contingency plans or allowed for character communication, they may be able to change their plan on the fly... or not. Proper use of &ldquo;I planned for that&rdquo; should be able to handle problems caused by misunderstandings between the GM and players, like &ldquo;I don\u02bct think I said there was a gazebo in the park&rdquo;, as well as minor failures in planning. You can choose to play this phase for laughs (70\u02bcs style), for serious (90\u02bcs-00\u02bcs style), or both (60\u02bcs style), as fits your group best.<br/><br/>"}, "133257": {"statistics": {}, "name": "Lonpos", "videogamemode": {"2149": "Single-Player"}, "videogameversion": {"186980": "WiiWare edition"}, "average": "0", "videogametheme": {"2351": "Puzzle"}, "usersrated": "0", "videogamegenre": {"2165": "Puzzle"}, "videogameplatform": {"4441": "Wii"}, "poll": {}, "description": "&quot;Lonpos (alternately Lon-pos or LONPOS) is a logic puzzle game in which the player must fit a fixed number of beaded game pieces of various shapes, to fill a set area such as a rectangle or pyramid.

The player must go to elementary school, junior high school, and high school. However, the player can elect to either go to university or start a career immediately. University requires players to pass a &quot;test&quot; in order to graduate and gain access to the better jobs in the game. Unlike the Super Jinsei Game series for the Super Famicom, the computer assigns the proper career for the player based on his avatar's intellectual, social, and physical skills.<br/>This game was released exclusively in Japan on March 17, 1989 and requires Japanese literacy to play successfully. While it lacked in the sophistication factor when compared to other games that are based on the Jinsei Game board game, the success of the game eventually lead to Bakushou!! Jinsei Gekijou 2 and Bakushou!! Jinsei Gekijou 3. Various elements that would be added to sequels with the series included the event squares and opportunity for radical hair cuts. Social interaction with other players (computer or human) is possible. However, the player's &quot;parents&quot; can take money away from players entering the next level in the game if they feel that they have too much money. This event is seen exclusively in this video game and it is not seen in its sequels or any of the games in the Super Jinsei Game series. Another feature not passed on to later games is the job interview. In order to get a job in this game, the player must do an interactive miniature game and &quot;audition&quot; for the new career. Failing the miniature game means not acquiring a job and succeeding means acquiring a paycheck and having job-related events appear on rolls of the dice.<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;Bakushou!!

Theater Life 2&quot;) is a Famicom life simulator game that was released on March 22, 1991 and requires Japanese literacy to play. Like all games in the series, an occupation is chosen for the player regardless of whether he goes to university or not. The concepts of going to prison for crimes and gambling in a casino are introduced in the series for the first time. These events are only experienced by players whose characters have become adults. Even with this limitation in mind, it is next to impossible to find a new career after being released. This is because the player loses their job after being sent to prison and must collect unemployment insurance after being released when he lands on a paycheck square.<br/>By reaching certain squares on the &quot;career&quot; game board, the player can temporarily escape to either an underwater realm or to outer space. However, players can be &quot;plucked&quot; out of the realm by an unsuspecting fisherman and be forced to return to the &quot;normal&quot; game board. Mini games include a Whack-a-Mole clone and a Space Invaders clone that can earn the player valuable game points as well as even more valuable self-esteem (will) points. Even though this game can be considered light-hearted and whimsical at times, there is partial frontal nudity in certain parts of the game. Fortunately, the genitalia are censored and only the other parts are shown. There is no rating on the game, although enough of the genitals are covered up to allow for teenagers to play independently (or for young children to play with parental guidance).<br/>Before the game starts, players must customize their faces using three spinners to create a random face. Possible careers include game designer, construction worker, military officer, rock and roll musician, and baseball player. Unlike its sequel and like its prequel, there is no separate board for attending university. The only difference between going to university and skipping to career mode is that the university graduating player will receive more choices and a higher salary. Careers and other aspects of adult life however can be manipulated by a series of stars and events.<br/>Yellow stars help the player either acquire a job or change to a different career. Red stars are beneficial events to a player's career while blue stars lead to events that are harmful to a player's career. When the player sees themself on top of a mountain, that means they have been promoted in their career. A spotlight on the player means demotion to a lower pay bracket within the career. Children can be taken away in special &quot;scandal&quot; squares that show the unfit parent holding the child on the television news. At the end of the game, God goes through everyone's financial moves and the most prosperous player becomes the winner.<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;Bakushou!!

The game is about a toddler who goes through childhood, adolescence, adulthood, and eventually senior citizenship. There are decisions to make (dating, marriage to one of seven different potential mating patners, telling the truth, whether or not to peek at Christmas presents) and sometimes an elderly figure that represents God intervenes to help players determine their best path in life. Turns can be lost due to illness and bad weather and gained when the player buys an automobile for 15,000,000 yen (approximately $100,000 USD). This money can be earned back much later in the game at a casino if the player decides to go on a vacation. Once all players reach the &quot;finish line,&quot; God tells individual players about their destiny after retiring from work and into the life of a senior citizen. Things that could happen include: the loss of a spouse, becoming a world traveler, becoming terminally ill later in life, and striking oil in the desert.<br/>Marriage almost always results in children but divorce occurs randomly just in real life and is symbolized by a falling leaf. As the player gets older, the female characters' faces get wrinkles and the male characters' faces get facial hair and the shape of the face become more chiseled. Tokyo Disneyland is included as a cameo role in one of the squares that the player can land on near the beginning of the game. The game decides whether the player gets lost in Tokyo Disneyland or not, either adding to or subtracting points from the avatar's intellectual strength. In addition to the standard game boards, there are also game boards for vacations, leaving the parents' home by either airplane or train, and incarceration.<br/>Like other games in the Bakushou!! Jinsei Gekijou series, university education is a completely optional path that leads to all career paths being enabled. Career cards have to be chosen in certain squares in order to represent a successful or a failed venture within the career. However, university education has a mandatory interactive quiz that must be done successfully in order to enter university. Failing this quiz twice will result in the player being bumped into career mode. Since the questions are in Japanese, there is no possible way for a non-Japanese reader to play the game without skipping university and straight into career mode. Choosing this path will offers limited choices and lower pay unless a career book is purchased later in the game for 300,000,000 yen. Only this important tool allows a choice of multiple careers either with or without a university education.<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;Bakushou!!

The player starts in infancy and must progress through the school years, and to a rewarding career. The final stage is senior citizenship where the goal is to retire as wealthy and as skilled as possible. Steps with hearts on them increase the player's statistics while steps with sad faces decrease the player's statistics. Up to four players can play and the game has anime-style graphics. Toys can be purchased at a handsome sum that knocks a player back six squares, makes an opponent's wheel spin slower or faster, creates lightning, among other things. Lightning caused the victimized player to lose a turn and one of the major differences between this game and other games based on Jinsei Game is that the individual &quot;boards&quot; function more as a race than an actual simulation of life.

Jinsei Geikjou series. Instead of moving in a linear fashion in order to reach the ultimate goal, the players move in a circle. During the simulated months of game play, new buildings are eventually constructed and the railway system reveals new areas for travel as the players progress through the months of the year and mature. However, incarceration and having an illness are included in the game. The circle-style game board would later be used in Daibakushou Jinsei Gekijou - Zukkoke Salary Man Hen, depicted the rut of the workday.<br/>Original elements that are used in this game include meeting the opponents' mother, enhanced mother-child interaction like a mother forcing her daughter to wear a long skirt to school, knowledge of what square the player will land on before making the spinner come to a complete stop, and cut sequences that cannot be controlled by the player (with the exception for answering questions). Occasionally, a school uniform inspector comes to the players and gives them marks on how closely they match the proper Japanese school uniform. Certain non-conforming items like a long skirt (instead of a short skirt) can cause the female avatar that was forced to wear the outfit by her mother to be penalized. However, bonus points are assigned as long as certain features are similar to that of a Japanese school uniform.<br/>While traveling is initially restricted to using the convienent railroad and transit bus options in the beginning of the game, eventually airport travel is unlocked as the players evolve in maturity and experience. Traveling to new places in the game constantly increased in cost as players are forced to use more of their in-game currency in order to maintain a balanced character. Eventually, the player must balance traveling &quot;far away&quot; with academics and spending time in the &quot;local area.&quot; There is no formalized year system in the game, the players simply go from January to December and back to January again. The only difference is that new ideas and concepts added during the months help create an illusion of the players growing older, wiser, and more mature in their outlooks. This game can be played with one to four players with computerized players being completely random. Using a similar system that used to name the player's avatar in The Sims and The Sims 2, players must create a given name and a surname in either hiragana or katakana.<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;Bakushou!!

The game also has &quot;Fusion Abilities,&quot; which players can form by setting combinations of certain abilities.<br/><br/>The Jobs available from the beginning for all the eight main characters are Freelancer, Warrior, Monk, Thief, Red Mage, White Mage, Black Mage, and Summoner. Each episode introduces a new Job, which is unlocked after completing the episode. The unlockable jobs for the Warriors of Light are Dragoon, Bard, Memorist, Knight, and Devout, while the jobs unlocked for the Warriors of Darkness are Ranger, Dark Knight, Dancer, Ninja, and Magus.<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;Final Fantasy Dimensions&quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "133297": {"boardgamedesigner": {"28161": {"name": "Kenichi Tanabe"}}, "average": "5.88571", "poll": {}, "name": "Gear's Knights", "playingtime": "60", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": {"2040": "Hand Management"}, "yearpublished": "2012", "usersrated": "14", "maxplayers": "4", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1466308_t.jpg", "boardgameartist": {"64915": "Azuma Azuma"}, "statistics": {}, "boardgamepublisher": {"10782": {"name": "Takamagahara"}}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1466308.jpg", "boardgameversion": {"187067": "Japanese first edition"}, "maxplaytime": "60", "boardgamecategory": {"1010": {"name": "Fantasy"}}, "age": "10", "minplaytime": "60", "description": "It's written in the &quot;Imperial Heizei of the history&quot; in the national library.<br/>300 years ago,<br/>At the beginning of the &quot;steam engine&quot;, the most armies in the world is organized in the Imperial &quot;Heizei&quot;.

There is no moon to brighten the bitter night, perhaps it flung itself into the inky darkness of space. With no source of light the nights are aphotic and terrible. With sunset comes such a penetrating cold that it can freeze one solid before he can even take a breath. Some say that just the winds can cut an unlucky wanderer in half. If those things do not kill you then the animals will.<br/><br/>Cerberus Wyrms and the Ur Bears are kings of the ice, but there are other creatures both above and below in the tunnels that are too numerous to list here. There are rumors of sapient and alien cultures that live out there on the surface ice but the rational do not believe such a thing is possible.<br/><br/>There are those that venture out onto the surface to explore and salvage in the sparse ruins that were left behind. Some return with precious metals, stone, and dirt. Some return with artifacts of unknown purpose, still others have come back gibbering with madness.<br/><br/>At its warmest the surface is literally bone chilling. I dare say it may be impossible to measure how cold it gets during the winter. Many have left for the surface and have never found their way home again.<br/><br/>We survive, though, as our kind always has. Warmed by heat drawn up from an immeasurable deepness through The Pipe. This massive network of conduits was here long before our kind came here and will likely remain here after we have frozen to death. No one can say for certain how far this series of ever branching pipework extends, but we uncover more of it every day. Just as some days we lose some. As insane as it sounds the pipe seems to move on its own.<br/><br/>There are vast caverns cradled along these massive lengths of pipe. In some of these caverns we collect the rare earth that pushes it&rsquo;s way through over the years, in others we make our homes and places of work.<br/><br/>We tap into the pipe as if it were made for us to do so, using the pressure, heat and steam to drive our thermobaric engines and keep us warm down here.

The Pumpkin King had groomed young Voodoo Dolly to be his successor, but the on the day of her coronation she went missing.<br/><br/>Unbeknownst to even the most ancient of Samhain elders, an enemy had been watching Halloweentown for years. The Iron Man, the long-exiled Duke of Screamwork, returned with an army of steam-powered horrors to take over Halloweentown. The Iron Man's forces made war against the denizens of Halloweentown, but soon conquered the land of eternal Oct. 31st. Now the denizens of that spooky realm must live under the heavy metal fist of the grim-faced Iron Man.<br/><br/>The Iron Man's aim was simple: in place of the traditional, organic way in which the residents of Halloweentown went about the business of crafting nightmares, planting fears that turn delight into dread, and spinning yarns that contain a nugget of worldly wisdom with a tale of terror, the Iron Man industrialized the purpose of Halloween. Vast, smoke-belching factories now dot the landscape of Halloweentown; where fears and shivers were once made with an artisan's care for the people of the day-lit world, they are now produced on an assembly line. No care goes into their production, no thought or passion goes into their design. And the morbid creatures of Halloweentown must labor at the machines that create these stereotypical and commonplace dreads.<br/><br/>Nevertheless, the very machinery that is reducing the art of crafting night-time thrills to a mere process and the steam-powered weaponry used by the Iron Man's agents might prove to be the undoing of the Duke of Screamwork's regime. A rebellion is brewing amongst Halloweentown's repressed populace. There are those who gather in the shadows to plot the Iron Man's overthrow, who will stop at nothing to break free from the monotonous shackles of the Screamwork factories, and who are beginning to appropriate the Duke's technology for their own ends.

You need to help your overlord to defend your dungeon by getting more monsters &amp; traps. You may also send your small army to raid the kingdom above or propose a plan to kidnap the lovely princess.

The goal is to gain most favors (VPs)from the overlord, so that you will get the most powerful monsters under your command. At start, a player is assigned to guard one of the 4 floors of the dungeons. The bottom floor is not available yet. You may request to swift floor with another player by playing a plot card in the Court phase. Obviously, you don't want to guard the first floor &amp; let your monsters as cannon fodders.<br/><br/>In Court phase. you may play a plot card to propose a mission like burning the town...etc. If no other player plays a recommendation card, you will lead the mission yourself. If someone play a recommendation card, that player may recommend another player to take the mission instead. VPs will be rewarded for successful missions.<br/><br/>Each player starts with 3VPs. You may lose vps by letting heroes pass your guarding floor, or gain vps by defeating heroes. The more vps you gained, the more say you will have in court phase.

His real name is never revealed in the game. Immediately after being brought back from Anserak (Hell), Locke is sent on a quest by his new master, Sardok, who is the advisor to Lord Tendrick, ruler of the island. The quest is to locate and rescue the Tendricks' long-missing daughter, Andria, who was kidnapped by a mysterious cult calling themselves The Children of the Change. The entire game takes place on the island of Ahkuilon, which is home to the town of Misthaven, where Tendrick rules.<br/><br/>As the player progresses through the story, it is revealed that Locke was once the king of an ancient empire centered on Ahkuilon. This warrior-king made a pact with a demon god, but he found the price of the pact - his beautiful wife's soul - too much to bear and could not go through with her sacrifice. For this reason he was condemned by the demon god to an eternity of suffering in Anserak and his mighty empire was destroyed and pulled into the earth.<br/><br/>The cult that the newly resurrected Locke finds himself facing is in fact led by the avatar of the same demon god he betrayed ages ago. As he explores Ahkuilon in pursuit of the missing Andria, Locke finds himself facing enemies both new and ancient. Many characters in the game hint that there is a &quot;darkness&quot; surrounding Locke and some even seem to know of his past. As the story builds to a climax it becomes clear that not all is as it seems and that history may yet repeat itself.<br/><br/>Gameplay<br/><br/>The main aspect of &quot;Revenant&quot; is its unique combat system that comes in two flavours. Locke can be controlled by the mouse, performing standard attacks. In addition, the player can control Locke with the keyboard, performing different attacks and even attack combos, some of which result in special death animations (fatalities). These specialized kill moves appear to be enemy-specific, and range from a crushing stomp to beheading. A gamepad or joystick can also be used in a similar way to the keyboard method, with nearly every move or command able to be mapped to buttons or button combinations. Locke gains extra fighting abilities after a level cap has been reached (every 3 levels, seemingly up to 24), thus providing the drive to go through the level grind. It is also possible to combine certain movements into a fluid cycle of kicks and thrusts.

No mention has been made thus far as to an international release. It received an overall score of 31/40 in Famitsu (individual reviews: 8/8/8/7). Originally under the working title Xenosaga DS, Xenosaga I &amp; II is a retelling of the first two episodes of the game for the Nintendo DS handheld system. The game's script (with ideas from Tetsuya Takahashi) is by Yuichiro Takeda, who worked on Xenosaga: The Animation. Hiroshi Takeuchi, of Cowboy Bebop fame, is responsible for the character art. Music for the game was composed by Kousuke Yamashita, who scored the soundtrack for Xenosaga: The Animation. Other previous work includes the Hana Yori Dango and Mahou Sentai Majirenjaa Tabidate live-action television series and Nobunaga's Ambition video game series. Yamashita is the fourth composer to score a Xenosaga video game, following Yasunori Mitsuda, Yuki Kajiura and Shinji Hosoe.<br/><br/>Xenosaga I &amp; II is not an exact retelling of the previous two games. Some major changes have been made to the storyline of the game without changing the pre-existing elements the first games have already laid out. Some scenarios have been edited and some new but minor characters have been included in these new parts. The Episode II portion of the game, originally told through Jr.'s perspective, will now focus on Shion, much like Episode I and Episode III. The Episode II portion of the game has been completely rewritten by Xenosaga creator Tetsuya Takahashi, which expands and enhances the storyline. This fills in some of the holes caused by Episode II, allowing for a better understanding of the plot and reducing the amount of questions that will be unanswered in Episode III. The game plays out on the DS' top screen from an isometric perspective while the bottom touch screen is used to issue commands and navigate menus. The game's battle mechanics follow Episode I's style as opposed to Episode II.<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;Xenosaga&quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "133415": {"statistics": {}, "name": "Manfred von Krashenbern's Flying Circus", "videogamemode": {"2149": "Single-Player"}, "videogameversion": {"187283": "North American DOS edition"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1472944.png", "videogametheme": {"2514": "Flight"}, "usersrated": "0", "average": "0", "videogamegenre": {"2314": "Arcade"}, "videogameplatform": {"4714": "DOS"}, "poll": {}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1472944_t.png", "description": "User Summary<br/><br/>This side-view action-arcade style game puts you into the pilot seat of a World War I British fighter plane.

Of course the more equipment present, the more gangsters you'll need to get past everything.

Everybody can join the contest and this is a great opportunity for emerging game designers to see their idea published.<br/>For more information:<br/>giocoinedito@luccacomicsandgames.com<br/><a target='_blank' href='http://www.luccacomicsandgames.com' rel='nofollow'>www.luccacomicsandgames.com</a><br/><br/>&quot;In the forest of Kalesia, the Centaurs and the Mermaids compete for the perfect place for a new temple. But can they overcome the spells of the Queen of Kalesia, who wants to exile all of them from the woods?&quot;<br/><br/>In Kalesia you are secretly part of a mystic alliance. Use your magical weapons to conquer areas of the forest, securing the perfect temple site for your Alliance. But be careful! The weapons you don't use are passed to your rivals, so that good fortune (and information!) will spread around...<br/><br/>Players all hold cards for all three factions competing over the forest (a grid of cards) and must play cards each turn. The faction with the highest total from the played cards wins the section currently being bid for. A faction wins by getting three sections in arow. The first twist is that players' factions are secret. The second is that players pass unplayed cards to the next player after a few turns and take back the cards they played.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": {"187352": "English/Italian first edition"}, "age": "8", "name": "Kalesia: the card game", "playingtime": "30", "boardgamemechanic": {"2012": "Auction/Bidding"}, "average": "5.51429", "usersrated": "21", "boardgamefamily": {"8502": "Miglior Gioco Inedito"}}, "133432": {"rpg": {"11085": "Champions (Hero System 6)"}, "statistics": {}, "name": "Champions Complete", "rpghonor": {"22908": "2013 ENnie for Best Art, Cover - Nominee"}, "rpgitemversion": {"187354": "PDF version"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1471029.png", "usersrated": "10", "rpgsetting": {"2349": "Champions Universe"}, "rpgproducer": {"17459": "Ruben Smith-Zempel"}, "rpggenre": {"171": "Action / Adventure (Superheroes)"}, "average": "8.2", "rpgcategory": {"2107": "Campaign Setting (game world)"}, "poll": {}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1471029_t.png", "description": "From publisher blurb:<br/><br/>The ultimate super roleplaying game returns to reclaim its crown in Champions Complete!

So the tribes of men waged war with one the other to hold it; until their battles brought forth an otherworldly host from the lands Faery, elves, fey, terrible and wonderful, wild men of the woods, giants and other such horrors. In countless battles the four realms struggled to take hold of Bryn Maenhiri, where too often the deep green grasses know the warm stain of blood and the iron of shod boots.<br/><br/>In time the other worlders sent forth their champion, the elf-lord Eifion, and he carried with him the sword Haearndarian. With this blade few could stand against him so that he fell upon the luckless with wild abandon, slaughtering men in droves. But in the end, his vanity undid him and he fell, his blade shattered by the heroes of men. The host of Faery fell back into the hill and upon the red soaked field the three kings of men made peace with one the other and swore a pact to keep the hill closed. They each took a shard of the sword for safety. So peace came to the whole of those people.<br/><br/>But now the shards have gone missing; stolen by some unknown hand and war spreads across the lands. Fear grips men for rumors of a host of fey returned spreads through whispers in every household.

Their goal is to survive and, if they're persistent and lucky, find a relatively safe place to begin building a better life.<br/><br/>The theme of the game is attrition, the steady erosion of one's capabilities and resources in the face of a threat - the zombies - that never rests, never relents, and lives only to eat. Players must work together, keep each other alive, and manage their individual and group resources well. The longer the group goes without hunkering down somewhere secure, the more dangerous things get - but no place is ever truly safe.<br/><br/>Eaten Away is designed to be played with zero preparation.

This game draws on years of reading and enjoying romance novels.<br/><br/>I've called this a narrative game because the aim of Men of Romance is to roleplay and create an enjoyable narrative in a short-term game, rather than create characters who will continue through a number of adventures. All the styles of play in Men of Romance lend themselves to one-shot games or at most two or three game sessions.

One was to make a game about tv shows &ndash; not a roleplaying game structured as a tv show (such as  N/A), but a game about the actual creation of a tv show. That influence should be quite obvious here.<br/><br/>The second idea was to invert the usual roleplaying game structure of one GM and multiple players. Some games play around with this in other ways, usually by making all players game masters in some sense, or by having the GM role rotate between the players, but I wanted to do a straight inversion with multiple GM:s and a single player. The obvious way to do this was to split the various tasks that are normally assigned to the GM (creating the world, setting scenes, portraying NPCs etc). To make this work I felt I had to do two things: make sure there was enough for each GM to do, and have a structure that made the divisions clear since there would be no &quot;super-GM&quot; who could say what everyone should do. By using rough approximations of the roles of the people behind the scenes of a tv show I feel I have found at least one way of doing this.<br/><br/>I know that some may not consider this game a roleplaying game, which is fine. I am not hung up on terminology, but to me this fulfills the basic requirements of a roleplaying game: a game that has as its main function the collaborative creation of stories.

The forces in the conflict during this time had extremely different abilities, methods of fighting, and morale. It varied from the extreme of &quot;crack&quot; British units with rigid discipline to the wild and uncertain Beja tribesmen who relied on ambush, the sword, the dagger, and spear to dispatch opponents.<br/><br/>As with most battle and wargames, including very complex Pentagon computer simulations, random events are part of the game. The winning player, or team,  is often the one who best deals with risk assessment.<br/><br/>Therefore, it is essential that the players have some understanding of chance and probabilities.

Often during such a campaign there will be two or three separate table top battles and sometimes reinforcements can be brought in.

Through force of personality and the ability to read the strengths and weaknesses of those around her, the luminary can bring out the best in her allies and befuddle and vex her foes. A luminary may seem to be little more than a cheerleader or mascot, but her power to control and alter the morale and inspiration of those around her allows the allies of a luminary to do far more with her than on their own, even if they never realize how crucial her presence is to their success.<br/><br/>Since a luminary&rsquo;s force of personality is hard to miss, many take roles that suit the constant attention they inevitably attract. The most well-known luminaries are performers and celebrities, but people with the ability to influence and inspire others can be found in many walks of life. A luminary may be a natural born leader, possibly even a military commander, rebel organizer, or rabble-rouser. Some luminaries work behind the scenes, acting as deal-makers, radio news announcers, extremist writers, or salacious pleasure-providing criminals. More rarely a luminary may even use her power of gaining attention work to &ldquo;hide in plain sight,&rdquo; allowing a spymaster to pose as something innocuous, ranging from a rich playgirl to a vapid celebrity famous only for being famous<br/><br/>Included in this 20 page book are three new archetypes: the celebrity, headliner, and fixer as well as rules expanding the use of the Diplomacy skill to allow characters to influence the attitude of entire groups, be that as small as a gathering on a corner or as large as an entire nation.

When things are calm, a tough can be hard to identify from everyone else, acting the role of anything from anarchist bomb-thrower to peaceful member of the gardening club. But when things get grim, when blood starts to flow and the tough has been smashed and battered, the tough reacts differently than anyone else. The more a tough is bloodied and hurt, the angrier and more determined to survive, to win, the tough becomes.<br/><br/>Toughs often have trouble with authority, and may take the easy route and live lives as bikers, bouncers, rum runners, thugs, and crooks. But just as many fight against their riotous, dangerous nature and seek to channel their anger and strength. Toughs can be found as drill sergeants, beat cops, bounty hunters, and local heroes. But no matter how carefully trained their fighting skills are, or neatly ordered their plans are, a tough is simply different once the fit hits the shan. A tough soldier may be respected, but he&rsquo;s also the guy quietly described as a crazy SOB. A tough firefighter is respected and honored, but people get nervous when they are assigned to his squad. A tough seems to be able to survive things that should leave him a smoldering corpse, and displays a refusal to quit that sometimes gets his more fragile allies killed.<br/><br/>A tough is a heck of an ally... if you can survive the friendship.<br/><br/>Included in this 24 page book are rules for the new &quot;Battered&quot; condition, as well as rules and guidelines for when characters from modern settings bring vehicles from those settings with them into fantasy campaigns with lower-progress levels.

In all these cases, the main action is focusing on character vs. character conflict, and a small number of vehicles interacting with those characters as outliers to the general activity. Also included are rules for when the main focus of the encounter is straight up vehicle on vehicle action!

While the imagination and knowledge looks to those worlds beyond out own solar system, the truth is that there are an infinite number of parallel worlds existing alongside our own world.<br/><br/>For a vast majority of human history these worlds were closed off to us. Not only were they closed to us, but we were entirely unaware of their existence. On November 27, 1933 this changed. At 3:42 PM. When Leon Theremin created the first gate (as they became known) to another world in his New York laboratory. This first gate was unstable and lasted only a short time. During which a white pigeon came through the gate. Theremin initially believed that he had created a portal to another place on Earth. During subsequent trials several of these gates opened to views that were obviously not Earth, though nothing came through the gates after the white pigeon.<br/><br/>Theremin's experiments were observed with keen interest by groups within the United States, Russian, and German governments. In January 1936 Theremin's lab was ransacked and most of his equipment and notes were taken. By the end of the year there were rumors that Germany had been experimenting with their own gates.<br/><br/>Theremin beguan to work with a number of American scientist on new versions of the gate. One of the primay problems with the gates was that they were inherently unstable. Constant adjustments needed to be make to keep the gates open, and even Theremin could only keep a gate open for 10-15 minutes before it would collapse.<br/><br/>In 1938 Theremin disappeared from the United States. His wife, Lavinia would report that a group of &quot;Russian Men&quot; had appeared and kidnapped him. He fate would not be know until 1990 when he was discovered living in Moscow by French tourist who had known Leon Theremin during his time in New York. He would not speak of what had passed in the intervening time, but after the fall of the Soviet Union papers were discovered that implicated he was involved in the Soviet gate program as well as developing technology related to espionage.<br/><br/>During the second World War Allied Intelligence out of Germany seemed to indicate that not only had Germany developed a method for stabilizing a Theremin Gate, but that they had discovered allies on the other side who were providing the German army with advanced technology. In a daring OSS mission in 1943 it was discovered that while German scientists had not developed a method of keeping a Gate stable, they had developed a method of reliably opening a gate to the same place repeatedly. The OSS were able to steal this information as well as destroy the prototype gate machinery as well as any information left behind. While it was true that the German scientist had managed to open a gate reliably to the same location multiple times, the gate opened to a barren, lifeless world which had no atmosphere. No evidence of otherworldly allies was ever discovered.<br/><br/>During the Cold War the United States as well as the Soviet Union spent a great deal of time and money on the gates, the gates remained more a novelty than anything useful. Neither side was able to stabilize the gates.<br/><br/>In 1983 a body was found in the hills above San Juan Bautista, California. Identification on the body indicated it had been a man named Daniel Green, an electrical engineer in the Silicon Valley. Dental records confirmed his identity. There was one problem, Daniel Green was very much alive living with his wife Deborah in San Jose, California. The living Daniel's dental work exactly matched that of the dead Daniel. Authorities were baffled. Several months after the discovery of the corpse, Daniel Green had an apparent mental break down and was committed to Coalinga State Hospital. During his treatment an unbelievable story came out.<br/><br/>Daniel Green was not from our world. He was from one very much like it with only minor differences. One of which was that in his world his wife Deborah had been killed in a tragic car accident. The Daniel Green from this other world had crossed over into ours, murdered this world's version of him, and taken his place. Over time though, his guilt about what he had done coupled with the minor differences between our world and his had caused a mental collapse. While most of the world believed that Daniel Green had simply lost his mind, groups within the United States government caught wind of the tale, and became concerned. A man had crossed over to our world from another, and committed murder. While this incident did not have vast repercussions, the possibility of something more severe occurring put into action the formation of the Gate Management and Intelligence Service. The GMIS was tasked with researching the gates, developing methods of detecting them, and managing any incursions into our reality.<br/><br/>In the 1989 the GMIS developed reliable method for detecting and pinpointing gate activity. It was determined that Gate activity was very uncommon. Between 1989 and 1999 only 7 gates were detected. In only one case, in 1996, did anything cross through, and in that case it was a woman claiming to be a political refugee from the Global People's Republic of Greece.<br/><br/>Between 1999 and 2009 gate activity grew at an exponential rate. By 2009 there was an average of one gate opening every month. The GMIS grew in proportion. In addition to managing these extra dimensional incursions and contacts, the GMIS also worked to suppress knowledge of the gates. With enough technical know how and access to any modern electronics store it was possible to build a gate in less than a year.<br/><br/>In 2010 computing processing power had increased to a point the GMIS was able to prolong the life of a Theremin Gate to nearly 24 hours. Using information gleaned from German research during World War 2 the GMIS was also able to open a gate reliably 3-4 times in the same location before losing the location.<br/><br/>2012: Modern day. GMIS continues to monitor gate activity and manage incursions from other realities. The GMIS also monitors the creation of gates by civilian entities.<br/><br/>The Game<br/><br/>This game is envisioned that the Player Characters are members of the GMIS working to control incursions from other realities. Most of these incursions are relatively harmless. They are human explorers or political refugees. In these cases the GMIS will offer refuge, or attempt to find out if the explorers know anything useful to the GMIS or pose any sort of threat, and then send them on their way. Other incursions are decidedly less benign. They are people like Daniel Green, or worse, criminals feeling the consequences of their crimes, or a new world where they are unknown, and can begin a new life of crime. Some worlds use the gates to dispose of hazardous materials and extremely dangerous people. Sometime the visitors from the other world are decidedly not human and their intentions incomprehensible to humans.<br/><br/>"}, "133102": {"poll": {}, "name": "Mark My Words", "playingtime": "0", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": {"2002": "Tile Placement"}, "yearpublished": "2012", "boardgameimplementation": {"39241": "Letter"}, "usersrated": "4", "maxplayers": "6", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1466236_t.png", "average": "4.5", "statistics": {}, "boardgamepublisher": {"672": {"name": "Family Games, Inc."}}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1466236.png", "boardgameversion": {"186652": "Family Games Inc. edition"}, "maxplaytime": "0", "boardgamecategory": {"1025": {"name": "Word Game"}}, "age": "8", "minplaytime": "0", "description": "The game is played on a grid mat.

The Earth had won and had beaten back the alien menace. From the ruins, the great centers of industry and life shattered, humanity declared that victory had come. But perhaps it had not. Just as our own biosphere had offered a poison to the Martians in time, what they had brought to Earth offered an equally deadly toxin. The Red Weed did not simply vanish with the passing of the Invaders. It seemed briefly to pause and then it returned with a vengeance. What should have been a time of rebuilding became a brief respite before a longer and more insidious war began.<br/><br/>No one knows exactly when the Weed Swarm mutated, when it became some different. Rumors had come from the life-choked countryside, of small animals, insects, birds which had been changed - infected by tendrils from the plants. These crimson animals seemed crazed, rushing towards settlements only to be put down. It drips and drabs it began with a few, then a handful, then a pack off maddened animals. And then after seasons the Weed Swarms became smart - intelligently striking at targets. But even more dangerous were the hybrids and the fusions. Greater beats and monsters - grafted together out of red weed, animal flesh, scrap, and metal. The people of Earth fight a war against this roving menace - utilizing all of the industrial technology they can bring to bear.<br/><br/>And... some say... that is the problem.<br/><br/>There are rumors, dark rumors that the red Weed did not simply awaken itself. They say that experiments, delvings, researches by scientists and engineers across the planet created this threat. The Martians had died but left behind their technology, their organic science, their bodies, and their war machines. How could mankind resist the siren lure? How could they not adapt those techniques to make transports, steam conveyors, high-temperature furnaces, medical advancements, and, of course, weapons?<br/><br/>LONDON 1916<br/><br/>Great Britain still stands, overseen by her Majesty Queen Victoria. She has lost many of her colonies, but remains stronger and more intact than other besieged nations such as Austro-Hungary, The Ottoman Empire, and Czarist Russia. The British have led the way in the adaptation of Martian technologies, using those to fight back against the Weed Swarm and its many and varied minions. The newest secret weapon in the crown's arsenal are the mechanized armored suits or mecha, codenamed Steamlarks. Many hope that these will be the salvation of the Empire and the means for hunting down and destroying the Swarm's dens.<br/><br/>PREMISE<br/><br/>In Arclight Revelation Tianmar players take the role of teens recruited by The Crystal Palace to pilot Steamlarks. They will protect human civilization against the predations of the mutated remnants of the Martian Invasion of 1898. The Red Weed, once a simple symptom of the alien encroachment, has gained sentience, polluting and corrupting native flora and fauna. Weed Swarm now comes in many forms and monstrous shapes. To secretly raise and train pilots for the Steamlarks, The Crystal Palace has co-opted the Spencer House Academy. Those who possess the mental talent necessary to pilot the Steamlarks are brought to South London - one of several splintered enclaves made up from the once great city. The Divided by walls, the eleven London subdistricts are a mix of bordering holdings and towns separated by Weedlands.<br/><br/>The Crystal Palace operates in secret from the hidden Crystal Palace Development Fortress (CPDF). They need pilots with discipline, but also balance in their lives. Military-like living conditions and training resulted in catastrophe. Instead the staff have taken a more psychological approach - splitting pilot's lives between a public face of school-children as a secret existence of training and field operations. But even this is a strain on these young men and women - who must face the awful horror of the Weedswarm and still hope for normal lives. Can they survive?<br/><br/>"}, "133107": {"rpg": {"2791": "Pathfinder System Compatible Product"}, "poll": {}, "name": "Spell Points", "rpgproducer": {"14210": "R.

Each of these products is designed to introduce a carefully balanced, developed, and playtested version of a popular houserule for campaigns using the Pathfinder Roleplaying Game Core Rulebook. Houserule Handbooks aren&rsquo;t for everyone, and should always be considered &ldquo;alternate&rdquo; rules, only for use if a GM and players all want to add something different to a campaign. In the case of Spell Points, the alternate rule is a system to allow all spellcasters to fuel their spells with a pool of spell points, not requiring any spell preparation, and allowing a spellcaster additional flexibility by using a lot of spell points to fuel a few high-level spells, or gain extended staying power by restricting casting to a larger number of lower-level spells. Further, the system is designed only for actual spellcasters, ignoring the spell-like abilities of monks and the infusions of alchemists as dissimilar enough to not need the same kind of spell point houserules. These considerations drive all the design decisions that follow, so if the system as described doesn&rsquo;t sound like your cup of tea, this product likely isn&rsquo;t for you.<br/><br/>Spell points are a resource used to cast spells, as opposed to using the normal rules of spell slots and spell preparation. Rules are given for spell points in general, and then specific rules for each spellcasting class. Every spellcasting class can use spell points. A campaign may only use spell-point characters (at the GM&rsquo;s discretion), or both spell-point and normal versions of classes may exist (in which case the decision to be a spell-point spellcaster must be selected when the first level in a spellcasting class is taken). A character cannot take levels in both a spellpoint and non-spell-point version of the same class (treat using spell points as a kind of archetype for spellcasting classes).<br/><br/>"}, "133108": {"rpgitemversion": {"186660": "PDF Version"}, "poll": {}, "name": "As Luck Would Have It", "rpggenre": {"550": "Modern"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1624936.png", "usersrated": "1", "rpgproducer": {"33439": "Stelio Passaris"}, "statistics": {}, "rpg": {"20428": "As Luck Would Have It"}, "average": "3.5", "rpgcategory": {"2083": "Core Rules (min needed to play)"}, "rpgseries": {"20167": "2012 RPG Geek 24 Hour RPGs"}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1624936_t.png", "description": "From the Introduction:<br/><br/>As Luck Would Have It is a role-playing game wherein everyday people are thrust into incredible situations.

Each volume in this line presents a small set of monsters tied to a single theme, but spread over a range of CRs. For the Threats From Beyond, that theme is outsiders. Rather than just present another set of pitchfork-toting fiends, author Sam Hing has put together an awesome set of outsider oddities to fill the corners and crevices of your extraplanar encounters.<br/><br/>The idea of Threats From Beyond is to expand a campaign&rsquo;s option for outsider encounters, since anything as vast as other planes of existence should have vast and varied creatures dwelling within them. In many cases these threats can be easily added to traditional plotlines centered on devils or demons, but a few other plots can also be presented using these outsider entities. When dealing with creatures as alien as natives to another plane not all the threats come from a desire to do evil (through a prismatic couatl can certainly make life difficult for the agents of a kingdom that prides itself on law-and-order), nor are they all things players are most likely to encounters in combat (though a shax&rsquo;s presence in a village may result in more casualties than an open fight).<br/><br/>Your players may have a handle on brigands, dragons, and other foes they can understand, but things just took a turn for the cosmic. The black chargers are lining up for a cavalry charge, the karkinides have begun to swarm, and there&rsquo;s very little time left to cut a deal with a traveler to make good your escape.

Add a sprinkling of the usual suspects: fluoridation, radio waves, the soundtrack of punk rock, and the combined static electricity of too much nylon clothing. Then the catalyst - a huge meteor strike that lit up the night sky like it was midday, except much, much more neon green.<br/><br/>Suddenly a whole generation had super-powers. Well, most of the powers were more &quot;stupid&quot; than &quot;super&quot; - immunity to wood, the ability to shatter glass just by looking at it, being able to mind-read badgers, or moving at super-speed but only while crawling. And these powers came at a price: a lethal vulnerability to kittens, crippling vertigo if more than 6&quot; from the ground, or being suddenly unable to pronounce the letter &quot;C&quot;.<br/><br/>However, it soon became apparent that those affected did now have a pre-disposition to powers and abilities beyond the normal human, and with judicious use of the right digital, genetic and drug enhancements they could be given true super-powers. Faced with thousands of potentially lethal teenagers, the authorities looked for ways to simultaneously enhance and control their abilities; for a way to channel their potential power to be a force for good and law rather than evil and chaos.<br/><br/>Thus was born the Super Scout Squad or SSS as it is more commonly known. This youth organisation provided a way to marshal the forces of the 'empowered' generation. In return for co-operation, good deeds and civic duty, the SSS offered greatly increased powers. The hope was two-fold: firstly that the youth movement would provide a positive incentive and moral code for the super-powered youth, and secondly that the SSS would provide an army capable of standing up to the swelling ranks of super-villains.<br/><br/>For not everyone responded to their newfound powers in a positive way. I'm sure you can imagine how many of the hormone-racked teenagers reacted. Some sank into anarchy or depravity, while others saw their powers as a signal that the old establishment should be swept away and the new generation of Homo Superior should rule over their parents and former masters.<br/><br/>Super Scout Squad is a tongue-in-cheek, rules-lite roleplaying game of teenage superheroes.
