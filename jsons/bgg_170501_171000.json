Only now is it seeing the light of day, having been given a beautiful makeover to help it grab the attention of gamers in 2015. Gameplay is in the style of &quot;Capture The Flag&quot; as you roll your dice to send your soldiers into the enemy's territory while also claiming cards from a deck that will hopefully give you the edge. Should you manage to steal an enemy crown, you'll race to return it to your own side of the board while also protecting your own, but watch out for the opposition forces that will swarm around you...<br/><br/>Capture also comes with a unique element, adding a need for dexterity as well as strategy. Each game comes with a pair of catapults that allow you to fling boulders at the opposition forces, should you have the card that allows you to do so. Knocking out a soldier will send them home, but it's not just the enemy that's under threat - should your own forces get hit, you'll have to send them back as well!<br/><br/>Capture is a game that works with a wide range of gamer types, from children who delight in hurling boulders across the board to take out their parents' pieces, to experienced gamers who want to take the strategy element to the next level, only occasionally throwing in the chaos of the catapult!<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": ["English first edition"], "age": "8", "name": "Capture: A Medieval Wargame", "playingtime": "120", "boardgamemechanic": ["Dice Rolling", "Pick-up and Deliver", "Roll / Spin and Move", "Take That"], "average": "7.34615", "usersrated": "13", "boardgamefamily": ["Admin: Unreleased Games", "Crowdfunding: Kickstarter"]}, "170584": {"poll": [], "name": "Ted Nugent Wild Hunting Adventure", "videogamemode": ["Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["CD-ROM edition"], "average": "0", "videogametheme": ["Hunting"], "usersrated": "0", "videogamedeveloper": ["Gonzo Games"], "videogamegenre": ["First Person Shooter"], "videogameplatform": ["Windows"], "statistics": [], "videogamepublisher": ["Electronic Arts (EA)"], "description": "Hunting simulation featuring famous rock musician and hunter Ted Nugent who provides video tutorials and original music.

Mother was developed to emulate human thought and emotion, to simulate human desires and aspirations, to better understand the rapid decline in morality. The citizens of Sapporo became the guinea-pigs for this technological experiment. A series of city-wide neural implant programs, dubbed &ldquo;the harvests&rdquo;, enabled the gathering of data directly from a person&rsquo;s cerebral cortex.<br/><br/>Mother&rsquo;s neural net became more and more empowered by the collective thoughts of a city of souls. She soon became her own master, not just reading the minds of her citizens, but controlling them. Mother was in charge and the people were now her automatons.<br/><br/>Only a few, the few who from fear, mistrust or in protest, avoided the harvests and remained untouched by Mother&rsquo;s influence. Like sewer rats they hide in an underground complex in Sapporo's Susukino district. While society at large became free from crime, free from poverty, free from emotion, without free-will or faith, from these few there came the criminals, the bootleggers, and the self-serving; the hungry, the frightened and the &ldquo;Renegades&rdquo;.<br/><br/>Renegade is an abstract-euro thematic deck-building game for 1 to 4 players. You are a new breed of Decker - a Renegade. You will hack into a network of five servers, operated by one of four Super-Massive-Computers (SMCs). Each of these four SMCs have their own AI and increasing complexity to defeat.  You must survive a series of Countermeasure events before the network becomes overrun by Sparks and Guardians. Once you are jacked into an SMC&rsquo;s servers, with a profile bringing its own special ability, you will move across its partitions and fight to take control of the network by using informational, destructive, deceptive and cognitive attacks.<br/><br/>Your Decker can seek upgrades (tools, software, apparel and information) by visiting the local bar, the &quot;Electric Sheep&quot;. Once a fashionable hang-out for attractive young lovers seeking a voyeur's view of the city, it has now gone underground. An intimidating bar full of hit men and debt collectors, fixers and dealers, trading contraband from all across Sapporo, it's not the sort of place to take a date.

Written by S&amp;S author, Matt Forbeck, and powered by the just announced Cypher System&trade; from Monte Cook Games, the Shotguns &amp; Sorcery core book contains all you need to play in one book. Defy the power of the Imperial Dragon Guard. Try your luck against the undead outside the Great Circle. New challenges, old foes and allies: a whole new setup to explore.<br/><br/>Shotguns &amp; Sorcery is set in Dragon City, a grim and gritty fantasy metropolis built on top of and inside of a walled-off mountain and ruled over by the Dragon Emperor. Legions of zombies scratch at the cut stones of the Great Circle every hour of the night, trying to tear the wall down for their mysterious necromantic commander, the Ruler of the Dead.<br/><br/>Inside the wall, the people work and scheme to find an edge and get ahead on the city&rsquo;s dark alleys and magically lit streets. The green-skinned folk squat down in Goblintown, stacked right up against the wall, where they can hear the constant moaning of the dead all night long. Above them, the rest of the survivors live in neighborhoods of their own, each stratified by their longevity and social standing, which make for the kind of barriers no hack on an enchanted carpet can fly you past.<br/><br/>Robbing the ruins that lay outside the Great Circle is illegal, but it&rsquo;s the best way for people with questionable talents with rune-laced shotguns to keep the gold flowing. And most days it beats selling dragon essence to the addicts who use it to fuel their magics, or hiring out as muscle for the dwarven gangs. As long as you keep your nose clean and give a wide berth to the Imperial Guard, there&rsquo;s a fortune to be made in Dragon City.<br/><br/>Just hope you live long enough to enjoy it.<br/><br/>"}, "170658": {"rpgartist": ["(Uncredited)"], "rpgitemversion": ["PDF Version"], "poll": [], "name": "Cheat Your Own Adventure", "rpgdesigner": ["Shane Mclean"], "rpgproducer": ["(Uncredited)"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2391592.jpg", "usersrated": "8", "average": "8.6875", "rpggenre": ["Generic / Universal"], "statistics": [], "rpg": ["Cheat Your Own Adventure"], "rpgpublisher": ["Pompey Crew Design"], "rpgcategory": ["Core Rules (min needed to play)"], "rpgpodcastepisode": ["Episode 54 - Fall of Magic, Cheat Your Own Adventure, Witch: The Road to Lindisfarne"], "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2391592_t.jpg", "description": "From the Game:<br/><br/>A good-natured Game Poem parodying the Adventure Books of old.<br/>For three or more players (best with four or five)<br/>Relax, no actual poetry involved!<br/><br/>You eagerly open the book at page 1 and begin your journey of page-flips and hard choices.

Players can either play the French, English, Spanish, or Dutch with the goal of building your empire and collecting Glory for the Crown.

All this will build up Glory Points in the name of your King.<br/><br/>The game plays quickly with each player on their turn having a choice of a single action from either:<br/><br/>1) Exploring: Paying to launch expeditions to place tiles, claim/purchase land, and placing influence markers (representing traders and missionaries) in the hopes of Allying and trading with the tribes.<br/>2) Economic Turn: Building up your Colony by creating new settlements, building Forts, repairing settlements that were damaged, maintaining troops, and collecting wealth from taxes and trade <br/>3) War: Eventually you will have to deal with the enemies of your King here in the The New World. If you choose this action this is where you will raise your armies and send them across the frontiers. Be forewarned though. War is not cheap. You will need a strong economy to wage successful war. There is only so much that the Crown can do to help your fledgling colony.<br/><br/>The New World is buffed by a large Event deck that brings out the historical events of the times. It also serves to pace the game by having Events that represent the Peace Treaties that ended the big European Wars that spilled over into North America. Whenever a Peace Event is drawn, there will be a few turns of truce and Glory Points will be awarded based on the number of Settlements, the number of claimed territories, and by your Alliances with the Native Tribes. Once 3 Peace Events are drawn the game will be over.<br/><br/>This game is rather unique by it's Exploration/Tile laying mechanic, it's quick engaging turns, it's streamlined easy rules including a nice combat resolution, the ability to bounce back from a disaster, and and a unique, more historical, representation of the native tribes.<br/><br/>"}, "170666": {"poll": [], "name": "Destiny - Expansion I: The Dark Below", "videogamemode": ["Network Multiplayer", "Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["PlayStation 3 Downloadable edition", "PlayStation 4 Downloadable edition", "Xbox 360 Downloadable edition", "Xbox One Downloadable edition"], "average": "6.45714", "videogametheme": ["Science Fiction"], "usersrated": "7", "videogameexpansion": ["Destiny"], "videogamedeveloper": ["Bungie"], "videogamegenre": ["Action RPG", "Sandbox", "Shooter"], "videogameplatform": ["PlayStation 3", "PlayStation 4", "Xbox 360", "Xbox One"], "statistics": [], "videogamepublisher": ["Activision"], "description": "User Summary<br/><br/>Destiny - The Dark Below adds new weapons, armor, and gear as well as new story quests and missions and a new cooperative Strike and Raid with three new competitive multiplayer arenas.<br/><br/>"}, "170667": {"image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2347228.jpg", "boardgameimplementation": ["Memory"], "poll": [], "boardgamedesigner": ["(Uncredited)"], "statistics": [], "yearpublished": "1998", "maxplayers": "0", "boardgameartist": ["(Uncredited)"], "boardgamepublisher": ["Mattel"], "maxplaytime": "15", "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2347228_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "15", "boardgamecategory": ["Children's Game", "Memory"], "description": "Help pair up each of the animal types and Simba and Nala's daughter, Kiara, with Kovu the male cub she has fallen in love with.<br/><br/>The game is a variant on a memory match game, but the pairs are a male and female of a species and the male and female tiles are different shapes, that form a heart shape when matched.<br/><br/>The game also comes with a display area that is set up to the side of the play area where all the matched pairs are placed.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": ["First edition"], "average": "0", "name": "The Lion King: Simba's Pride \u2013 Pride Rock Pairs", "playingtime": "15", "boardgamemechanic": ["Memory"], "age": "4", "usersrated": "0", "boardgamefamily": ["Celebrities: Walt Disney"]}, "170668": {"poll": [], "name": "Dark Souls II: Scholar of the First Sin", "videogamemode": ["Network Multiplayer", "Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["English/European Windows edition", "North American PlayStation 3 edition", "North American PlayStation 4 edition"], "average": "8.42857", "videogametheme": ["Horror"], "videogamefranchise": ["Souls"], "videogamedeveloper": ["From Software"], "videogamegenre": ["Action RPG", "Sandbox"], "videogameplatform": ["PlayStation 3", "PlayStation 4", "Windows"], "usersrated": "7", "statistics": [], "videogamepublisher": ["BANDAI NAMCO Games Inc."], "videogamecompilation": ["Dark Souls II", "Dark Souls II - The Crown of the Ivory King", "Dark Souls II - The Crown of the Old Iron King", "Dark Souls II - The Crown of the Sunken King"], "description": "User Summary<br/><br/>Dark Souls II: Scholar of the First Sin is an enhanced release of Dark Souls II with updated visuals, rebalanced gameplay, new enemies, a new NPC to discover, expanded lore, new in-game events, and a higher maximum number of players for online play.

They enslaved hundreds of people and they conquered thousands of worlds. For untold generations, the Myriad people served them, and worlds were stripped of all resources, and left barren and dead. And then, a century ago, the Syndics were gone. Did they retreat to another universe? Are they hiding on undiscovered worlds, in radio silence?

You will find lost treasures . . . and you will find horrors best forgotten. The risks are great, but the rewards are greater.<br/><br/>Built using the Cardinal rules engine (as seen in IRONCLAW, NOGGLE STONES, and USAGI YOJIMBO RPG), our game lets you build your character to be as straightforward or as complex as you like.  Play a no-nonsense adventurer ready for anything, or play a master specialist who has no equal in their field.  Play an ordinary human thrust into extra-ordinary circumstances, or play a fantastic alien or machine, made from unknown science and with powers and abilities far beyond our normal space.

It is similar in feel to the Call of Duty: Modern Warfare series, although it actually pre-dates the first game in that series by 3 years. Players proceed through linear levels while battling terrorists and hostile Russian soldiers using an assortment of modern firearms.<br/><br/>Like many games from the time period, Shadow Ops: Red Mercury does not have regenerating health, with the player instead relying on health pickups found throughout each mission. At the beginning of each mission, the player is assigned 3 weapons (typically a sidearm, an assault rifle, and a special weapon such as a shotgun, sniper rifle, or light machine gun) and cannot obtain different weapons during the mission. The player can aim down their weapon's sights for increased accuracy (this is presented with a stylized zoom, the player still relies on the crosshair and does not truly aim down the weapon's iron sights, although telescopic sights are utilized correctly from a first-person perspective); while aiming down sights the player is unable to move, but can lean in order to fire around corners or over cover. Combat options include firing the player's held weapon, throwing grenades, and melee attacking utilizing the butt of their held weapon. One unique gameplay element is the ability to roll grenades along the floor, instead of simply throwing them through the air.<br/><br/>The game does not feature either a manual saving or a checkpoint saving system, each individual level must be completed from beginning to end without the player dying or quitting. However, completed levels can be re-visited at any time from the level selection menu.<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;Shadow Ops: Red Mercury&quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "170767": {"poll": [], "name": "Slave Zero", "videogamemode": ["Local Multiplayer", "Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["European Windows edition", "North American Windows edition", "Sega Dreamcast edition", "Windows Downloadable edition"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3250465.jpg", "videogametheme": ["Science Fiction"], "usersrated": "0", "videogamedeveloper": ["Accolade, Inc."], "videogamegenre": ["Action"], "videogameplatform": ["Sega Dreamcast", "Windows"], "average": "0", "statistics": [], "videogamepublisher": ["Infogrames Entertainment SA (IESA)", "Night Dive Studios", "Retroism"], "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3250465_t.jpg", "description": "Slave Zero is a 1999 Infogrames video game for the Sega Dreamcast and Windows ME.<br/><br/>The game was originally designed to work with Windows ME.

Players roll a single D6 and move any one of their markers the total count on their turn. Markers can land on top of one another, and, in so doing, trap opponents' markers, or their own until the top one is voluntarily moved off the stack.

The marker(s) that reach ELDORADO are stacked in the order that they reach there. Final score is highest for the top marker (last to arrive) and decreases for those lower in the stack.

It is a unique tabletop experience that has the play differently than any other games in the same genre.<br/> If you didn&rsquo;t know already, the game takes place in the Wonderful Land of Oz, but at a time when it wasn&rsquo;t so wonderful. All the great Legends of Oz have disappeared, and four Witches from the Silver Islands. While L. Frank Baum may have written a much happier world, this is still the same place, with all the characters and places you know in love&mdash;but in a time of great terror. The game consists of animals, beasts, and mythos&mdash;it is your task to get the World back to the way it once was, with the characters you know and love. If you are able to compile the best deck filling each of the four categories (HEART, COURAGE, BRAIN, HOME), you win!<br/><br/><br/>What makes it different?<br/><br/>    Consisting of a 90 Card Deck<br/>    And a Completely New Card Playing Experience<br/>    Reclaim OZ with your cards in hand<br/>    Defend your Deck from the Evil Witches of OZ<br/>    Find a New Ruler to Lead Ozonians back to Prosperity<br/>    Rescue the Legends of Oz and take Back the Emerald City<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>The one thing that makes this card game different than a traditional deck building game is the lack of currency and ability to purchase cards. The cards are given to you each turn, Cards are marked with symbols letting you know how they are used in the game, the symbols include: Heart, Courage, Brain, Home, and Wicked. All of these cards are used in different ways. *All Card Designs Are Subject to Change<br/><br/><br/>How to Play<br/>Each Player is dealt 5 Cards. During their turn they will play two cards; one card face down in their vault and place one card face up in their discard pile. Another option is to play an action card against another player in replace of playing a card in their vault--this will trigger a PvP event giving the attacked player the option to play a defense card in return. These cards become Trash and not played again. If you choose to Vault instead of Attack, please note the vault card is safe from play and will go towards your final deck at the end of the game. The only cards that can harm your Vaulted Cards are Witch Cards. Cards present statistics and points, Each card is given a value in the form of gold bricks called Road Points the higher rated the card the better it will serve you in the end game.<br/><br/>The Game Board includes places for the following:<br/><br/>HOME: Cards that are played against or in defense<br/><br/>BRAIN: Ruler/Legend/Key Section (3 Cards per board)<br/>HEART: Foundation Section (3 Cards per board)<br/><br/>COURAGE: Ozonian Section (3 Cards per board)<br/>WICKED: Curse Section (1 Card per board)<br/><br/><br/>Throughout the Game you must build your Deck via placing it on the Game Board, once an item is placed--it&rsquo;s there until the game ends.<br/><br/>Each player can have up to nine cards on their Board and one card can be given to them as a curse, making each deck build a total of ten cards. When a player is cursed the card is played face down on their Game Board the player does not know what curse is given to them until the final tally.<br/><br/>Witch/Curse Cards are used to play against other players in order to damage their vaults. Curse cards can be played toward another player by placing it on the Player you want to curse, each player can only be cursed once and it cannot be taken back or discarded. Witch cards are PvP actions that will cause a player to be affected. That player can use what is in his or her hand to replenish their board, in case of the attack ending the game.<br/><br/>If at any time the player must draw a card from the main deck, but the deck is empty, they shuffle their discard pile and use it as their personal deck. for the remainder of the game.<br/><br/>The game ends when all four witches have been played, Witches can not be discarded but played into their discard pile that will affect one or all players  in the game. To play a Witch Card place the character face up on the table and explain the action that must take place, some witches have you attack single players while others affect everyone in the game. The Witch Cards play a pivotal role in the gameplay and can only be diverted if a Defense Card in Hand is playable and not vaulted. All Witch Cards caused whichever players/cards affected to be Trashed and will no longer be used in gameplay.<br/><br/>Once the game ends and the cards on the Game Board are tallied, the winner has the most Road Points in their Vaulted Deck is the winner. In the result of a tie the player with the highest Road Point Legend is the Winner.<br/><br/>Nearly all cards but Witches/Curses have double or triple uses, for Example Quox the Dragon can be used as an Attack card or as a Courage Board Card saved face down on your personal game board. Because of the value of that card, he can be used as a great boost on your Final Game Points&hellip; However as an attack card he can significantly harmful to another player, giving you the advantage. The cards you choose to save on your Board impact your final score--it&rsquo;s up to you to choose how to play your cards.<br/><br/>Each Card has Road Points value that is tallied at the end of the game to determine the winner, but high Road Point Cards may not want to be vaulted due to their Additional Properties--such as saving you from Attack. Road points are the the key to a 'Victory'.<br/><br/>Curse cards, which are like the other cards, but have a negative Road Point value that counts against the player at the end of the game. It is uncertain which curse is given to a player until the end count.<br/><br/>Defense cards, though they may have a high Road Point Value and can double as Assist or Support in your Vault, will usually be kept in hand in order to be playable (though Trashed) in order to save other cards in your deck.<br/><br/>Attack cards generate effects during a player's turn, allowing that player to Attack another players hand or rarely their vault cards. Witches are considered Action Cards because they attack every player and usually the Vault (which in some cases will affect the game drastically). Defense and Action cards can be played each turn unless the player chooses to Vault a Card instead of using it as an action.

These environments interlock greenery and stone of ruins with futuristic technology.The puzzles require the player to locate tetromino-shaped &quot;sigils&quot; by navigating mazes and overcoming obstacles within them.<br/><br/>The unnamed protagonist - a robotic android - gains consciousness in a serene environment. A disembodied voice, identifying itself as Elohim, informs the robot that it has created several worlds that it should explore and collect the sigils hidden within various puzzles as part of a path to enlightenment.<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;The Talos Principle&quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "170860": {"rpgartist": ["Andreas Schroth"], "rpgitemversion": ["German PDF"], "poll": [], "name": "Im gro\u00dfen Wald", "rpgdesigner": ["Sebastian Witzmann"], "rpggenre": ["Fantasy"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2803965.jpg", "usersrated": "1", "rpgproducer": ["Tobias Freund", "Sebastian Witzmann"], "statistics": [], "rpg": ["Aborea"], "rpgpublisher": ["13Mann Verlag"], "average": "5", "rpgcategory": ["Solitaire Adventure"], "rpgseries": ["Der Dunkle F\u00fcrst"], "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2803965_t.jpg", "description": "<br/>Publisher Blurb<br/><br/>Das erste eigenst&auml;ndige Solo-Abenteuer f&uuml;r ABOREA ist da!

Thirty-six scenarios track the operations and battles that took place or could have taken place between the fleets and air forces of Germany, Poland, Lithuania, Latvia, Estonia, the Soviet Union, Finland and Sweden. In addition to their complete Baltic Sea orders of battle, the Soviets, Swedes and Finns all have additional ships they planned or began to construct but did not complete.

This is a big game, at least in terms of pieces. The map is not so big: the Baltic Sea is pretty small and almost completely land-locked, with ports and airfields in abundance. Aircraft are very potent in this theater, and ships have very little room to hide. The map by Guy Riessen shows the full Baltic on a single 11x17-inch panel.<br/><br/>The scenarios cover all of the action from the Polish &ldquo;Operation Peking&rdquo; in which three destroyers escaped to England just before the war began, to the planned Swedish invasion of German-held Denmark in May 1945.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "1", "boardgameversion": ["First edition"], "average": "6.75", "name": "Second World War at Sea: Sea of Iron", "playingtime": "30", "boardgamemechanic": ["Dice Rolling", "Hex-and-Counter", "Secret Unit Deployment", "Simulation"], "age": "14", "boardgameexpansion": ["Second World War at Sea: Plan Z"], "usersrated": "4", "boardgamesubdomain": ["Wargames"], "boardgamefamily": ["Second World War at Sea"]}, "170933": {"poll": [], "name": "APOC-X", "videogamemode": ["Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["APOC-X iOS"], "average": "0", "videogametheme": ["Science Fiction"], "usersrated": "0", "videogamedeveloper": ["(Self-Developed Video Game)"], "videogamegenre": ["Action Adventure", "Tactical Role-Playing Game"], "videogameplatform": ["iPad", "iPhone"], "statistics": [], "videogamepublisher": ["(Self-Developed Video Game)"], "description": "Summary written by developer for VGG<br/><br/>APOC-X is a top down dual stick tactical and action shooter with 3 game modes:<br/><br/>ARCADE: Non-linear sandbox like levels where you have to find your way out, action, adventure, exploration, secret areas and puzzles also included in the level design.

Each player in turn must now either play the same number of cards of a better rank, or pass. Play continues around the table until everyone has passed; at that point, the cards are cleared and whoever played the last set of cards leads the next round. After everyone has gone out, the players are ranked. The person who first got rid of all his cards becomes the Trailer Park Supervisor. The last becomes the Shit Puppet. Players change seat position to represent the new hierarchy and begin another round.<br/><br/>TPB: Supply and Command also includes two optional decks, Supervisor and Trailer Park.
