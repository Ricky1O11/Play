Each player begins with two of their own unique Doomtroopers imbued their Corporation's special ability.  They make decisions and plan strategies to prevent the Dark Legion and its leader, the vile Nepharite, Alakhai, from conquering the solar system. Each successful mission brings a new one with the modular Citadel and events that can help or hinder you in battle. Each promotion gives credits to access more powerful weaponry!  Grab a Punisher Shortsword and Plasma Carbine to make your mark in the Mutant Chronicles!<br/><br/>Gameplay:  The game begins by choosing which of the 5 players will be the Dark Legion Player for the current mission.  A player fulfills this role by setting their Doomtroopers aside for the current mission and controlling the enemies.  The Dark Legion player can earn promotion points for their inactive Doomtroopers by wounding the other player's Doomtroopers.  Thus, taking a turn as the baddies is not totally thankless.  10 different scenarios are included with the game.<br/><br/>The Corporation players take their Player tray and 2 Doomtrooper miniatures, two Doomtrooper cards and a Secondary Mission card if specified by mission (these allow extra points if the requirements of the card can be met).  The Dark Legion Player sets up the current mission's Citadel layout with the modular boards and gathers his mission specified Force Cards.  The Force cards are deployed in rooms face-down and are revealed when a Doomtrooper enters and the corresponding Dark Legion miniatures are placed on board.  All miniatures may move 3 squares per move action and most figures get 2 actions per turn.  A figure can do one of the following: Move then Attack, Attack then Move, Attack twice or Move twice.  Corporation Players go first.  Order is determined by flipping over a face-down Corporation token.  The revealed Corporation player then takes their turn with both Doomtroopers and the next Corporation token is flipped.  Play is semi-cooperative for the Corporation players as they compete for points, but want the overall mission to succeed.   The weapon card the Doomtrooper has equipped determines whether he can attack long range, close combat or both.  There are various miscellaneous equipment that can be equipped in addition to the weapon (healing kits, laser targeting, Grenade launcher etc...).  Attacks are carried out by rolling dice and comparing the number of hits to the armor value of the target.  If the number of hits exceeds the armor value of the creature it is eliminated.  In addition Doomtroopers can use a Doomtrooper card to affect the game in some way.  These cards list two effects but only one can be used per card and are then discarded.  The possible effects range from modification of combat or movement to messing with your opponents (jamming their gun for example).  After all Corporations have taken their turns it is the Dark Legion players turn.<br/><br/>The Dark Legion(DL) Player at the start of his turn draws the top event card, reads it out loud and follows the instructions.  The DL player then receives the reinforcements listed on the card and places them on the board.  The DL player then looks to see if any Force cards are still face-down. If there are, the player reveals one and places the revealed units in the same room the card was in.  The DL player then takes his actions with all of his creatures.  Play continues in this way until mission is successful or the time runs out and it fails.<br/><br/>Game End: Successful Doomtroopers receive promotion points for the creatures killed in battle and credits specified for the mission.  If they gain rank Doomtroopers improve the combat dice they use and gain extra actions.  With their credits Doomtroopers can purchase improved weaponry and gadgets (Gehenna Puker, Nimrod Autocannon).  The Dark Legion player's inactive Doomtroopers gain 1 promotion point per point of damage inflicted upon the opposing players' Doomtroopers by creatures.<br/><br/>A rare poster-magazine called &quot;Sinkadus&quot; 41# &amp; 42# that was produced by Target Games AB only in Sweden, added an expansion to Siege of the Citadel.

Each hero comes from a different people. The Barbarian has traveled far from the savage north, a land of bitter cold and ferocious warriors. The Wizard hails from the cities of the Empire, the largest and most important of the realms of men. The Dwarf is drawn by the goldlust for which his race is famous. Dwarfs are grim and rather abrupt, but they are good fighters and loyal friends who remember debts of gratitude as readily as debts of coin. The Elf comes from the green woods of Loren where his kin spend their days hunting and making merry, protected from evil by the strange magic of their land. Elves are incredibly quick and agile, and they are also the best archers in the world.<br/><br/>In the Warhammer Quest game the players enter a dark and forbidding dungeon. Together they must face the horrific dangers that wait for them. They will be attacked by monsters such as Orcs, Goblins, Skaven and Minotaurs. Other perils lurk in the darkness: scurrying venomous things like spiders, deadly pit traps, and decayed tunnels that cave in at the slightest touch. If they complete their quest the players will be rewarded with gold, treasure and artefacts of magical power. The more gold and treasure you can discover the better.., and the player whose warrior amasses the greatest fortune has done best of all!<br/><br/>Warhammer Quest is probably unlike other games you have played. Rather than each player competing against the others, all the players must co-operate if they are to win. Also, there is no single board. Instead, the different rooms and corridor sections are clipped together to make a dungeon that is different every time you play. The game rules may seem a little complex at first - but don't worry a lot of the rules are designed to extend the game and are not vital to begin with. The actual game rules you need to play are in this book or printed on the various cards.

You do this by spamming mailing lists. The more closely related the mailing list is to the type of scam you're trying to pull, the easier it is to score.<br/><br/>Scams come in 4 types - sex, internet, money and free stuff. The text and art flavor are quite wonderful. Of course the sex scams appeal the most - highlights were the Virtual Jellorama, Walter's Wankery and Disgusting Dog Tricks. If you're geeky, some of the internet scams are witty. All the standard 'make money doing nothing' and free stuff scams are there as well.<br/><br/>You play scam cards in front of you (up to 5) and then play mail-out cards (spams) trying to lure people in. There are a number of mailing lists of various sizes in the middle for anyone to mail to, plus each player has some private mailing lists that only they can spam. The action is to play a 'mail' card, nominating both a scam and the list that you're mailing the scam offer to. If you roll a d6 less &lt;= the size of the list, you succeed, and that scam scores a point. If you roll way under (4 or more), your scam scores 2 points. Some lists specialize in one of the 4 scam types ... if your scam and the list matches, you get a modifier of +2 making it easier to score, plus the mail-out cards have modifiers between 0 and +5.<br/><br/>Simple so far, but every time a mailing list gets spammed, it decreases in size by 1 (1 million thematically which equals 1 on the die) - these are subscribers getting disgruntled by the amount of spam they're receiving who leave the list.<br/><br/>The winner is the first person to get 20 points across all their scams, or who gets a single scam of 12 points BUT it's only checked at the start of your next turn.<br/><br/>A turn consists of 3 actions surrounding 2 decks - list cards and action cards. An action is pick up a card, play a card or merge 2 lists (making one bigger list you can then mail to). The action cards consist of scams, mail-outs or hardware cards. Hardware cards are played in front of you and allow you to break the game rules in a prescribed way (eg can mail other's private lists). Mail-out cards also list special effects which vary from mundane to wildly powerful but generally allow you to hose other players. When you play one, you say whether you're mailing or playing the special effect.<br/><br/>To the game play itself. You try to get a mail-out going every turn (you're only allowed one) and pick a scam / list combination that gives you the best chance of scoring 2 points rather than 1 point. If you only get 1 point, you may well be falling off the pace. You're generally picking up at least one card each turn, and this can be a slow process as any special action needs to be read and understood to work out whether you want to use the card as a mail-out or for the special effect. So it's not the fastest game in the world. These hostage cards also make it a big hit the leader game. If you're going to make a dash for the lead have plenty of protection cards because you have to maintain your winning score for a full round before you win - everyone gets a shot at you.<br/><br/>"}, "1648": {"boardgamedesigner": {"3": {"name": "(Uncredited)"}}, "poll": {}, "name": "Kan-U-Go", "playingtime": "30", "minplayers": "2", "yearpublished": "1934", "usersrated": "41", "maxplayers": "7", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic196443_t.jpg", "average": "4.86585", "statistics": {}, "boardgamepublisher": {"2179": {"name": "Jarvis Porter Ltd"}}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic196443.jpg", "boardgameversion": {"108098": "Jarvis Porter Registered Badge Edition"}, "maxplaytime": "30", "boardgamecategory": {"1002": {"name": "Card Game"}}, "age": "10", "minplaytime": "30", "description": "An old crossword card game from the 30s, I was given my copy of Kan-U-Go in 1975.

The object of the game is to have that character cast a magic Ring into Mount Doom. Along the way from the Shire to their final destination, players have opportunities to pick up *several* Rings. These rings may be spent to get past opposing creatures. However, to win the game, a player must have at least one Ring when they reach Mount Doom.<br/><br/>Cards allow a player to move 1-3 clear spaces ahead, to defeat Orcs or Nazgul, to bypass the various opposing creatures on the board, or to traverse mountain terrain, dictate movement. Cards are also useful for stealing rings from an opponent, relocating Nazgul on the board, and other functions. Each player has a hand of 5 cards with which to play the game.<br/><br/>Die rolling comes into play for fighting Orcs, Nazgul, Shelob and Gollum when you don't have a card to defeat (or escape from) them, or to traverse the mountains.

At the start of the game, each player picks a profession likely to benefit from the smoking of others (Doctor, Undertaker, etc.) and then starts moving around the board.

When a smoker ends up sharing a space with another player, there's a chance he'll pawn one of his brand habits to him.

The game ends once the first player dies (in the short game) or when only one player remains alive (in the longer game).<br/><br/>The game is extremely simple to play and is filled with all kinds of horrible (but sometimes amusing) puns.  The game's claim that it has the power to cause smokers to quit and to discourage people from ever picking up the habit is rather questionable, but since it's easy enough to be played by young children, its anti-smoking message might actually be able to reach an audience that hasn't heard it all before.  Unfortunately, the game's simplicity may well work against it; for some players, once all the jokes have been heard (and there aren't all that many), there's really not much reason left to play the game.

In the darkest part of the night, the doppelganger kills the Archmage, triggering a spell that seals the castle until the monster is caught. Now, in the grand tradition of Clue, the six suspects must determine which one of them is the doppelganger: Regdar the Human Fighter, Tordek the Dwarf Fighter, Lidda the Halfling Rogue, Mialee the Elf Wizard, Ember the Human Monk or Nebin the Gnome Wizard. The heroes try to figure out Who killed the Archmage, Where the crime occurred, and Which magical weapon was used.<br/><br/>For the most part, gameplay in Clue: Dungeons &amp; Dragons is identical to standard Clue as players roll a die, move into different locations on the game board, then make accusations against a particular combination of who/where/which cards and a particular opponent; if that opponent holds one of those cards, she must reveal it to you. Eventually someone will narrow down the possibilities and make an accusation as to exactly which cards have been removed from the game; if correct the player wins, and otherwise she's out of the game and play continues for everyone else.<br/><br/>One optional element in Clue: Dungeons &amp; Dragons is the Wandering Monsters deck. After landing on a &quot;claw-marked&quot; space on the game board, the player draws the top card from this deck, then battles the creature shown by rolling a die. If she wins, she gains a magic item that confers a single-use special ability, such as looking at a random card from an opponent's hand or taking an extra turn. If she loses, her token is placed in the center of the game board, from where it will take several turns to move back into a room (and get back into the game).<br/><br/>"}, "1664": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic862576.jpg", "poll": {}, "boardgamedesigner": {"24": {"name": "Alex Randolph"}}, "statistics": {}, "yearpublished": "1999", "maxplayers": "4", "age": "4", "boardgamepublisher": {"265": {"name": "Drei Magier Spiele"}}, "maxplaytime": "10", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic862576_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "10", "boardgamecategory": {"1041": {"name": "Children's Game"}}, "description": "A motorcycle racing game for young children with beautiful wooden pieces.

The more aircraft there are on a single route, the lower the payment received for each aircraft. For example; on the New York to Seattle route, one aircraft will make $40,000. If there are 5 aircraft on the route, then each aircraft will earn $15,000, for a total of $75,000. All players receive payment for their aircraft on the route regardless of who landed on the square. Other squares on the board require the players to make certain payments (such as landing fees or ground service charges).<br/><br/>The players are also required to perform maintenance on their aircraft. Airport cards can be drawn which give individual players bonuses (such as a mail cargo route) or penalties (such as a strike). The players also have the option of buying or leasing new aircraft or of selling old aircraft back to the bank. The first player to reach a net worth of one million dollars is the winner.<br/><br/>This game is another variant on the venerable Monopoly game. The varying amount of payment based on the number of aircraft on a route is actually somewhat realistic, but otherwise it has about as much to do with how airlines are actually run as Monopoly does with actual real estate investment. But the flavor is good, and the game is interesting to play and reasonably fast. It can be seen as a foreshadowing of Avalon Hill's Air Baron.<br/><br/>"}, "1666": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic56290.jpg", "is_expanded_by": {"1667": {"name": "Battle Hymn: Leatherneck"}}, "poll": {}, "boardgamedesigner": {"680": {"name": "Joseph Reiser"}}, "statistics": {}, "yearpublished": "1986", "maxplayers": "1", "boardgameartist": {"15063": "Ted Koller"}, "boardgamepublisher": {"1391": {"name": "Hobby Japan"}}, "maxplaytime": "240", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic56290_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "240", "boardgamecategory": {"1019": {"name": "Wargame"}}, "description": "Battle Hymn is a solitaire game of combat, adventure, and heroism in the Pacific during World War II.

Action is fast paced and tension-filled as characters exchange blows, fire spells, and even attempt to backstab. It is the fantasy battle at its best. <br/>More than simply hack and slash, strategy IS the key to victory, with cunning and skill playmg a central role in your success. Game play is an exercise in diplomacy and subterfuge, as \ufefftreaties and trickery can make all the difference between victory and defeat. <br/>While The Challenge is easy to learn (start playing in less than 15 minutes), it has a depth far beyond that of the typical card game. With its excitment filled, strategy oriented, fullthrottled action, The Challenge is sure to become a classic. If you always loved combat the best ... take The Challenge.<br/><br/>Sequence of Play:<br/><br/>The player who rolled the high die goes first. Play moves clockwise around the table. The player can either challenge an opponent, pass, or declare a defensive turn.<br/><br/>\ufeff1) Challenge another character by using a Weapon Action Card, casting a spell (Advanced), using a magic item (Advanced) or using a thief skill (Advanced) from one of your characters against another character in another party. Both Character Cards involved are turned face-up (if they are not already). Then the defending player may retaliate with any appropriate card or pass. The challenging player may then continue by playing an appropriate Action Card or passing, followed by the defending player, etc., until both players have passed or one of the two characters involved in the challenge has died. After the challenge is resolved, the player whose tum it is can move one of his characters from one rank to another, discard any number of Action Cards, and draw from the Action Deck(s) until he has seven cards. The player that was defending in the challenge cannot discard, but can refill his hand up to seven. It is then the next player's tum.<br/><br/>\ufeff2) Pass - Do no actions, moving of characters, or discarding of cards.<br/><br/>\ufeff3) Defensive turn - You can't play any Action Card that directly affects another party. Play party Defensive Cards (Advanced), allocate Magic Cards (Advanced) to characters, move any number of characters from one rank to another, discard any number of Action Cards, and draw up to seven cards from either the Weapon Action deck or the Mystic Action deck (Advanced). Remember, you can't do two defensive turns back-to- back.<br/><br/>"}, "1683": {"boardgamedesigner": {"3": {"name": "(Uncredited)"}}, "poll": {}, "name": "Hot Property!", "playingtime": "90", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": {"2001": "Action Point Allowance System"}, "yearpublished": "1985", "usersrated": "9", "maxplayers": "6", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic4566_t.jpg", "average": "5.11111", "statistics": {}, "boardgamepublisher": {"847": {"name": "Chieftain Products"}}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic4566.jpg", "boardgameversion": {"309927": "Chieftain Products edition"}, "maxplaytime": "90", "boardgamecategory": {"1064": {"name": "Movies / TV / Radio theme"}}, "age": "8", "minplaytime": "90", "description": "&quot;Welcome to the glamor and glitter of movies!

Both players have 16 tiles (which are divided into 8 squares in a 2x4 grid).  The squares show either red roofs or gray plazas.  One set, used by the 'roof' player, has roofs on 6 of the 8 squares on each tile.  The other set, used by the 'plaza' player, has plazas on 6 of the 8 squares on each tile.  Each player shuffles their stack of tiles and places them FACE UP before them.  (Thus you can see what your opponent's next tile will be.)  The tiles will be placed onto a 17x17 board.<br/><br/>Players alternate placing tiles onto the board with a few placement restrictions:<br/><br/>1) The first tile must cover the center square of the board.<br/><br/>2) Later tiles must be placed so that at least one square of the player's color touches a square of the player's color on a previously placed tile.<br/><br/>The object is to form as large area of connected roofs or plazas as possible by the end of the game.  Each tile you have in this connection scores one point.  There are little 'tiddly wink' markers to aid in this counting process.  Each player tallies the tiles in their largest connected group, and the player with the greatest total wins.  The rules call for two games, with players alternating sides in the two games.<br/><br/>The only other feature of the game is the veto.  Each player has the opportunity to 'veto' an opponent's tile ONCE per game.  A chip is simply placed atop the tile atop your opponent's stack to indicate that you are 'vetoing' that tile.

Dawn breaks on the combined might of four Legions arrayed on the heights of Mount Scopus, starting their methodical advance across the valley to the ancient walled city of Jerusalem.  Siege lines have been secured tight about the city.  There is no hope of escape.  The besieged must persist behind their stout walls or perish before a vengeful Rome.  Five grueling years of campaigning in Judea is now culminating in the Siege of Jerusalem.<br/><br/>But the fortified city defies even the might of Rome.  The thick walls atop the steep slopes literally bristle with natural and manmade fortifications.  It will take all of Rome's considerable engineering skills to winch their war machines into position for an assault up the slopes to the city.  Only here in the north plain can the city's walls be taken by escalade.  The rhythmic approach of the Legions is muted by the rumble of the siege engines as an assortment of towers, rams, and artillery precede the maniples.  The distant walls seethe with the frenzied activity of an alerted populace as the antagonists draw near.  This majestic view is abruptly halted by the blare of trumpets which soon gives way to the cacophony of the clash of arms and screams of the dying.<br/><br/>Morning turns to dusk before the walls are breached and the weary legions exact their vengeance.  The sky turns bright again, aglow in the reflection of a thousand fires as the northern outskirts burn.  But what price victory?  Another day such as this will break the Roman Army and only one of the city's ten walled sections has fallen this day.  They will have to find another way.  Shafts must be dug to undermine the walls or earthen ramps built with which to scale them.  It will be a long campaign.<br/><br/>This is The Siege of Jerusalem...An epic battle simulation with all the trappings and majesty of a Cecil B. DeMille film spectacular.  Facing the greatest army of antiquity, the Judeans must rely on the stoutness of their walls to halt the unbeatable Roman legions and therein lies the fascination:  the immovable object vs the unstoppable force.  As Eliezar Ben Yair, leader of the Zealots, you must conduct a skilled defense of the city's ever shrinking perimeter - exacting from the Romans a price so terrible that they will be forced to lift their siege - or break out to continue your struggle for freedom at Massada.  As Titus, commander of the Roman army, you must decide when, where and how to renew the assault - gauging your troop needs against the progress of your siege works and the press of time caused by outside threats.

There are six different styles of performers, and at different times in the game, public opinion will favour different styles.  Public preference is determined by dealing out cards from a special deck.  The current opinion is always known, and a possible (but not necessarily accurate) forecast of future preferences is also provided.<br/><br/>Each turn, public opinion changes (sometimes to match the forecast, and sometimes into something completely random), then players use a bidding system to acquire contracts with performers.  Once contracts have been negotiated, profit is calculated depending on how well performers match the public's desires.<br/><br/>By the time twelve turns have been played (and possibly one or two turns sooner), the game will come to an end and the player with the highest score is declared the winner.<br/><br/>The game was originally published by the designer in 1985.

Moonstar added planets and variants (variant number 8 is Corona, without sand timer). Orbit is new game from 1993. Harun is not new game, it is a rethemed copy of Moonstar! Finally, Randolph recycled most of the game into his Rasenden Robotern (Ricochet Robots) , although the course mechanism and the objective were completely changed.<br/><br/>Quite possibly the first &quot;German&quot; game to cross the Atlantic...<br/><br/>About the game (from the back of the box)<br/><br/>Moonstar is a game unlike any other game for any number of people. All the action is governed by dice, yet there is no luck involved. The dice simply establish the situation. It is up to the players to act upon it. A game with endless variety.<br/><br/>Playable by any number of people, from one to a hundred, Moonstar combines numbers calculations, memory, and quick-thinking into a fast-playing, action-packed, exciting contest of pure skill.<br/><br/>The board represents the twelve constellations (stars) of the Zodiac and the playing pieces represent moons and planets. Each game consists of a number of rounds of play. In each round, the board and playing pieces are first setup by one of the players. Then the dice are thrown. A one-minute auction period begins. Each player may bid any number of times in the auction or not at all. Each bid, however, must be higher than the previous one. When the one-minute runs out, the highest bidder plays that round.<br/><br/>The play of the round also lasts one minute. A player plays a round by placing one die on each moon on the, board and then moving that moon (and die) a number of stars equal to the number of the die. The die is then removed and the moon may not be moved again. This procedure is followed for each moon. The player must move each moon before the time runs out, or those moons which have not been moved may not move.<br/><br/>The player's score is then totaled to see if he has made his bid, by scoring a number of points for each moon, depending on which stars and planets they have landed on, If a player makes his bid, he scores a number of points equal to his bid. If he fails, he scores nothing. Rounds are setup and played in this manner until one player has scored enough points to win.<br/><br/>But this is only the beginning. Moonstar is actually twelve games in one. Game One is simply the Basic Game. Games Two-Twelve each change one or more parts of Game One, or add something to it. They introduce things like challenging bids, side bets, more moons, more dice, different planet values, no planets. and advanced scoring methods.<br/><br/>Includes:<br/><br/>    16&quot; x 16&quot; gameboard<br/>    15 moon pieces<br/>    21 planet pieces<br/>    1 minute sand timer<br/>    11 6-sided dice<br/>    rulebook<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Re-implements:<br/><br/>    Corona<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Re-implemented by:<br/><br/>    Orbit<br/>    Ricochet Robots<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": {"108197": "Avalon Hill first edition"}, "name": "Moonstar", "playingtime": "30", "boardgamemechanic": {"2012": "Auction/Bidding"}, "age": "12", "usersrated": "75", "boardgamesubdomain": {"4666": "Abstract Games"}, "average": "5.07347"}, "1715": {"boardgamedesigner": {"730": {"name": "David Tennes"}}, "average": "5.30465", "poll": {}, "name": "Od", "playingtime": "45", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": {"2014": "Betting/Wagering"}, "yearpublished": "1985", "usersrated": "43", "maxplayers": "4", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic253833_t.jpg", "boardgameartist": {"12261": "Jean Baer"}, "statistics": {}, "boardgamepublisher": {"5": {"name": "The Avalon Hill Game Co"}}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic253833.jpg", "boardgameversion": {"108206": "Avalon Hill First Edition"}, "maxplaytime": "45", "boardgamecategory": {"1002": {"name": "Card Game"}}, "age": "12", "minplaytime": "45", "description": "Components<br/><br/>62 card deck <br/>2 dice <br/>An od is an element of theoretical force.

This game might not be for you...unless you are a student of the international money market.  Or, you are just plain curious as to why the US dollar is worth less and less despite the fact that we are still the strongest nation in the world.<br/><br/>Simply put, Foreign Exchange is not a toy.<br/><br/>A perfect simulation of the international currency situation, it is!<br/><br/>International companies realize gains and losses when changing currency rates alter the value of their income and assets in foreign countries.  This game simulates this situation by letting players own and manage multi-national companies in various cities throughout the world.  As in the real world, changing conditions require each player to make constant decisions after considering his company's financial resources - and what he expects his opponents to make - against the cost of alternative protective strategies.<br/><br/>The Iranian oil situation of early '79 is a classic real-life example.  Iran furnishes less than 7% of America's petroleum needs.  Yet its unavailability has done more to devalue the dollar against gold than any economic crises since the depression of 1939. Why so, you may ask.<br/><br/>Playing Foreign Exchange will give you insight into this question, and you'll have fun doing so because the game focuses on the interplayer relationships.  Without such interplay relationships, no game is fun to play.  With it, Foreign Exchange might just be the greatest money game to come along since Monopoly.<br/><br/>Ironically, it doesn't come with any money.  All financial transactions are recorded on a variety of accounting pads included.  If you're into pencils, you'll love this game (some enterprising money -market enthusiasts have already programmed this game on computer).<br/><br/>You - as company head - decide where in the world (literally) you want to establish sales and manufacturing offices.  This is done at the beginning through a round of trading City Cards among players until everyone is satisfied they've outsmarted their opponents.<br/><br/>From this point on, a variety of situations and happenstances will determine likely changes in currency rates.  You - the manufacturer - must plan the strategies you think best to maximize gains.<br/><br/>Foreign Exchange was designed by a professional money-management expert and executive officer of the leading financial institution.  What is duck soup to him, however, might be unfathomable to the novice.

It is convoluted, Byzantine, and entertaining.  It is also cost effective, feasible, and administratively impossible.  In its early stages, Bureaucracy required a fifteen story parlor, a six acre gameboard, 200,000 pieces, and a 15,000 page rulebook.  Of course, this prototype was unwieldy.  Consequently, we were forced to simplify the game.  The present version is good for two to eight players.<br/><br/>Each player starts the game at the lowest organizational level.  The winner is the player who rises up through the masses to become the Director of the Bureaucracy.<br/><br/>Players may select one of four lifestyles, each with its own advantages and disadvantages: lifer, over achiever, empire builder, or hustler.  To be promoted from level to level, a player will need the required number of promotional prerequisites and that's where the fun comes in.  All sorts of things can happen.  Players may be demoted.  They may be involved in scandals.  They may become involved in power plays.  They may have to go before a Grievance Committee.  A player may even go bankrupt and have to start all over from the bottom again.  There is no one sure formula for success.  Players will have to stay out of trouble and use all their cunning to succeed.<br/><br/>This is a game that makes being a part of the bureaucracy fun  It will make you laugh at government and yourself at the same time.    For civil servants, it's required recreation.  For just you and me, it's a must.  Don't be surprised though, when you open the box and hear the call of the jungle.  It's a wild game.<br/><br/>Game includes a 22 x 24 gameboard, 2 dice, 240 promotional prerequisite pieces, 20 power play pieces, 64 player tokens, a pack of money, 80 lifestyle cards, 20 memo cards, 20 consumer goods cards, 8 bucks, 1 power file, and two rulebooks (one to explain what it says in the simple game rules)<br/><br/>"}, "1725": {"boardgamedesigner": {"736": {"name": "Robert J.

There were 9 games in this series, which were released near the end of the 3M venture into the gaming market.<br/><br/>The game is extremely simple, yet requires quite a bit of 'bluffing' in order to win.  Each player begins with six metal pawns along the back row of a 6x6 grid.  The board fits snuggly into the box itself and is quite sturdy.  The game is, as is the entire Gamette series, ideal for bringing along while traveling.<br/><br/>Each player secretly places a teeny magnet under two of his pawns.  The object is to be the first player to maneuver one of these 'magnet-bearing' pawns to the opposite side of the board.  If you manage to accomplish this feat, you win.<br/><br/>Movement is simple.  You simply move one of your pawns one space to an adjacent space ... vertically, horizontally or diagonally.  If this lands you atop an opponent's pawn, you are both 'frozen' and can no longer move.  If you make the mistake of moving one of your 'magnet' pawns onto an opponent, he instantly wins.  &quot;Well&quot;, you say, &quot;Why wouldn't I just check the pawn to make sure it wasn't carrying a magnet before making such a questionable move?&quot;.  The rules allow for this, but if you do check, you are prohibited from 'freezing' an opponent that round.  So, it's best to remember which two of your pawns are carrying magnets.<br/><br/>As mentioned, the game ends as soon as one player manages to get a magnet-bearing pawn to the opposite side of the board.  If both players fail to accomplish this, the game is a draw.<br/><br/>The game is very simple and the primary tactic is 'bluff'.  Are you going to be bold and move one of your 'magnet' pawns to the front, figuring your opponent will guess that this cannot possibly be your magnet pawn as he could freeze it too easily?  Or, do you protect your magnet pawns and try to create a path that it can squeeze by your opponent's pawns and scoot to the opposite side?  As with most bluff-style games, there's some guesswork and plain old luck involved, but there is still enough maneuvering and tactics to keep it interesting.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": {"26514": "English first edition (3M Gamette)"}, "name": "Evade", "playingtime": "10", "average": "5.73448", "usersrated": "58", "boardgamesubdomain": {"4666": "Abstract Games"}, "boardgamefamily": {"61": "3M Gamettes"}}, "1736": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic11292.jpg", "poll": {}, "boardgamedesigner": {"741": {"name": "Edward Campbell"}}, "statistics": {}, "yearpublished": "1986", "maxplayers": "6", "boardgameartist": {"13910": "Christos Achilleos"}, "boardgamepublisher": {"1876": {"name": "Altar Games"}}, "maxplaytime": "240", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic11292_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "240", "boardgamecategory": {"1022": {"name": "Adventure"}}, "description": "This is the second expansion set for Talisman - The Magical Quest Game.

Otherwise, they might not end up just dead, they&rsquo;ll end up as someone&rsquo;s dinner!    Ogres are not evil as such. Just permanently hungry and frighteningly violent.

As they peered into the shadows, they saw a sinister figure on a rocky throne. A solitary traveler stepped forward from the huddled and dripping group and addressed the presence on the throne. My lord Morcar, we come bearings grave tidings. We must report the failure of your plan to raise the Ogre Horde against the Empire. Once again we were routed by his accursed Champions and once again we were forced to flee. The figure on the throne shifted and a voice like death broke the silence. I am aware of your failure, Festral. But as in all things I have learned from my failures. Firstly I have learned not to underestimate the Emperor&rsquo;s Heroes. Secondly, I have learned not to rely on fools. I have therefore conceived a new scheme to destroy the Emperor&rsquo;s Heroes forever. I have chosen four Lieutenants to carry out my plan. Come forth my Lieutenants. With that command, four silhouettes stepped from the shadows. Let me present Zanrath, High Mage of Sarako. An ancient bearded man wearing a pointed hat and carrying a staff topped with a crescent moon bowed down towards Festral and his retinue. Fanrax, the Malicious. At the mention of his name, an evil-looking man adorned with skull symbols and toying with a wickedly sharp dagger gave a sneering smile at the group. Boroush, the Storm Master. With sweep of his oaken staff, a ragged and bearded figure greeted the refugees. And finally, Grawshak, Orc Shaman of the Northern Tribes. The last of the four Lieutenants, an Orc decorated in skins, feathers and skulls, carrying a massive totem wand growled what might have been a greeting or a curse at the party. I believe that these four Sorcerers will succeed where you have so miserably failed. And it is they who will punish you for your failure. With this final word, Morcar disappeared into the shadows. From here he watched with great satisfaction as his four sorcerous Lieutenants erased all trace of Festral and his followers. Mocar smiled.

At the same time as this computer development, the author of the King's Bounty board game was wrapping up the development of the board game, which at the time had a working title of &quot;Bounty Hunter.&quot; New World Computing decided to adopt a storyline and theme similar to that of the board game being prepared for production by Task Force Games, which New World Computing owned.<br/><br/>New World Computing shut down development at Task Force Games and transferred ownership of the company prior to the board game production completing, which delayed its release. The major remaining component that had to be completed prior to release was final production and layout of the rule book, which is why interior artwork changed from that produced for other components.

Each person places his 'boat' on the start space with one of the numbers facing forwards. Each person also starts with a number of 'Logs'. These are used to move your boat forward 1 space for each log spent. (You can also decide to move backwards - gaining 1 log for each space moved back).<br/><br/>Now comes the complication - bumping. If your boat stops in a space that is adjacent to 1 or more others, bumping occurs. To determine where your boat ends up you look at the hex sides facing each other (on your boat and on the adjacent one(s)). You subtract the adjacent boat's hex side number from yours - and if it is positive your boat moves forward that number of spaces, and if negative - the other boat moves forward that number of spaces. Now you check to see if your boat is adjacent to another boat and if so repeat the bumping procedure.<br/><br/>If your boat is next to more than 1 boat, and has at least 1 positive difference, your boat moves forward. If you have more than 1 positive, add them together and move forward that distance. If you have a negative difference the other boats move in clockwise order.<br/><br/>For subsequent turns - you can freely change the facing (&amp; thus the hex side number facing forward) by 60 degrees.

Like Hannibal: Rome vs. Carthage, the fortunes of war turn as the game goes on: the French are masters early, with the crushing British manpower advantage accruing late.<br/><br/>A lot of the interesting aspects of this war are covered through rules or special cards, from the early recalcitrance of the colonial assemblies and infighting amongst the colonials to the very different natures of the battles of outposts and sieges and the raiding in the backwoods.<br/><br/>Wilderness War is by the designer of the more recent Labyrinth: The War on Terror, 2001 \u2013 ? and Andean Abyss and other GMT COIN Series games.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": {"47118": "Deluxe edition"}, "average": "7.74829", "name": "Wilderness War", "playingtime": "180", "boardgamemechanic": {"2018": "Campaign / Battle Card Driven"}, "age": "12", "usersrated": "1399", "boardgameaccessory": {"31093": "Wilderness War Deluxe Map"}, "boardgamesubdomain": {"4664": "Wargames"}, "boardgamefamily": {"9793": "Age of Kings"}}, "1823": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic224206.jpg", "is_expanded_by": {"26806": {"name": "1829 Conversion Kit"}}, "poll": {}, "boardgamedesigner": {"58": {"name": "Francis Tresham"}}, "statistics": {}, "yearpublished": "1974", "maxplayers": "9", "boardgamepublisher": {"333": {"name": "Hartland Trefoil Ltd."}}, "maxplaytime": "360", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic224206_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "360", "boardgamecategory": {"1021": {"name": "Economic"}}, "description": "1829 was the first of the 18xx series. First published in the mid-'70s it was way ahead of its time. The game works by alternating stock dealing rounds and operating rounds. Stock dealing rounds allow players to buy shares in the available railway companies. Operating rounds allow the presidents of those companies to build track, run trains &amp; generate revenue for shareholders.<br/><br/>This basic system has been much copied and is an integral part of all 18xx games.<br/><br/>The original board covered the southern half of Britain, from the south coast to Darlington. In 1981 a northern board was published covering northern Britain &amp; Scotland.<br/><br/>Where 1829 differs from most others in the 18xx series is the means by which track is laid. Companies each have a token on the board called a Survey Party. Track is laid by moving the company's Survey token and placing a track tile in the area just vacated... if it is still vacant. This mechanism was discarded in the later 18xx titles, and creates much more of a tactical tile-laying game. It also slows down the game, and 1829 is one of the longer 18xx titles. A typical game can take anything from 4 to 10 hours to play.<br/><br/>In 1994 Francis Tresham published 1825, which is largely a modular version of 1829 with simpler rules and a few other enhancements. It plays quite differently from 1829, though, as 1829 was always about competition for routes.<br/><br/>The board gaming hobby has in its history a few landmark games, which redefine a part of board games in general, or even spawn an entire genre. 1829 is just such a landmark.<br/><br/>Expanded By:<br/><br/>    MSK 1 Extension Kit for 1829 (Northern & Southern Boards)<br/>    MSK 2 Extension Kit for 1829 (Southern & Northern boards)<br/>    MSK 3 Extension Kit for 1829 (Northern & Southern Boards)<br/>    MSK 5 Extension Kit for 1829 (Northern & Southern Boards)<br/>    MSK 6 Extension Kit for 1829 (Northern & Southern Boards)<br/>    1829 Conversion Kit<br/>    1829 Northern Board<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>", "minplayers": "3", "boardgameversion": {"31512": "Hartland Trefoil First Edition"}, "average": "7.06304", "name": "1829", "playingtime": "360", "boardgamemechanic": {"2013": "Commodity Speculation"}, "age": "12", "boardgameexpansion": {}, "usersrated": "204", "boardgamesubdomain": {"5497": "Strategy Games"}, "boardgamefamily": {"19": "18xx"}}, "1824": {"boardgamedesigner": {"8083": {"name": "Jeffrey Breslow"}}, "poll": {}, "name": "Trump: The Game", "playingtime": "90", "minplayers": "3", "boardgamemechanic": {"2012": "Auction/Bidding"}, "yearpublished": "1989", "usersrated": "557", "boardgamesubdomain": {"5499": "Family Games"}, "maxplayers": "4", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1175306_t.jpg", "average": "4.47226", "statistics": {}, "boardgamepublisher": {"20": {"name": "Milton Bradley"}}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1175306.jpg", "boardgameversion": {"40858": "First Edition"}, "maxplaytime": "90", "boardgamecategory": {"1021": {"name": "Economic"}}, "age": "12", "minplaytime": "90", "description": "In Trump: the Game players compete in two parts.

From there, play mechanics are reminiscent of Steve Jackson's Illuminati: cards representing potential cult members (a/k/a Sheep) are dealt into a common pool in the middle of the table. Players in their turn use Influence to recruit Sheep for their Flock (cult); each new Sheep you control adds to your Influence, and many of them grant special abilities as well. In addition to recruiting uncontrolled Sheep, you can also try to convert (steal) or &quot;deprogram&quot; (make uncontrolled) Sheep belonging to other players' Flocks, or declare jihad and have one of your Sheep making a suicide attack on one of your rivals' Sheep.<br/><br/>When your chosen Doomsday comes around, all of the Sheep you currently control commit ritual mass suicide in an attempt to trigger the apocalypse. A die roll determines whether they succeed; the more Sheep you sacrifice, the better the odds.

But besides its fighters, the RAF has other weapons to help deal with the &quot;Huns&quot;: a chain of RDF (radar) towers along the British coast, and an elaborate system of communications, signal evaluation and fighter control and guidance.
