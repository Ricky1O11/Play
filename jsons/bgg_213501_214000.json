Gygax.  Arneson.  Come experience the Golden Age ...<br/><br/>THE CREATION of the world&rsquo;s preeminent Fantasy Role-Playing Game (FRPG), Dungeons &amp; Dragons&reg;, is one of the most fascinating tales to be told in all the shared histories of entertainment, play and game design.  Two very different men, David Lance Arneson and Ernest Gary Gygax, undertook an unprecedented collaboration which gifted us &mdash; as their shared legacy &mdash; with one of the most intriguing games the world has yet experienced.  Their game did not just simulate one isolate corner of reality; it dared to encompass the entirety of all realms of adventure, the consensual playground of the human imagination.<br/><br/>HAWK &amp; MOOR tells the story of Dave and Gary, and the many other people whose efforts gave first life to the game we know and love today.  Arneson had spectacular ideas, but Gygax knew how to refine them.  Collaboration soon turned to conflict as Arneson believed his game was being taken from him, and Gygax crystallized systems where incomprehensible riddles had stood before.  Both men were creative geniuses, but the game they created from Gygax&rsquo;s Chainmail (1971) was the end result not only of their teamwork, but also of their clashes and disagreements.<br/><br/>HAWK &amp; MOOR chronicles that first legendary game to arise from the Golden Age of Fantasy Role-Playing.  Herein you will find Gary&rsquo;s life story, the history of Gen Con and the Castle &amp; Crusade Society, and details concerning the conception of Castle Greyhawk.  This first book also includes new revelations pertaining to Arneson&rsquo;s Blackmoor and its influences; tales from the Blackmoor Dungeons and Loch Gloomen; details on Gary&rsquo;s first dungeon adventure; an exploration of the links between H. P. Lovecraft, Robert E. Howard, and the earliest underworld adventures; the secrets of the asylum which inspired Castle Greyhawk; and much more.<br/><br/>HAWK &amp; MOOR, The Unofficial History of Dungeons &amp; Dragons&reg;, includes 107,300 words on over 470 pages, supported by a detailed chronology, extensive research into the inspirational origins of D&amp;D, and over 490 footnotes and annotations.<br/><br/>The adventure begins here.

Each one of them has a unique set of traits: movement, attack power, abilities, etc. At the beginning of a game, the player will configure the abilities the hero will be able to use during the fight: these abilities will make the hero more defensive, capable of helping other heroes and/or having access to powerful attacks.<br/><br/>The y\u014dkai are the enemies of the game: inspired in the ones from the Japanese folklore, these supernatural beings will follow &ldquo;behavior cards&rdquo;, so their acting is managed by the own players. Those will indicate in an easy to follow way what the y\u014dkai will do in each given situation. The y\u014dkai will be constantly spawning from settled points in random amounts, decided by drawing cards from their specific deck.<br/><br/>Heroes and Y\u014dkai take turns to play: they will move, attack and use abilities while fighting in the tiled boards.

Its gameplay is divided into three phases: Genesis (focusing on world-building), Exodus (letting your group act out characters in this world), and Revelation (giving you time for reflection and revision before the next round). Your group determines the pocket universe the game is set in for that session. Everyone creates roles for each other to play in the upcoming story. These character archetypes are privately given goals to achieve. Roles are distributed randomly and secretly. Players then adopt a character befitting their role and try to achieve their goals through diplomacy and storytelling. Since many objectives conflict, players obfuscate their true motives to get others&rsquo; support. After the story has concluded, the goals and roles are tweaked to keep things fresh and mysterious and a new round begins.<br/><br/>Aside from storytelling and persuasion, the primary mechanic during the discussion phase is &lsquo;influence&rsquo;. Every player gets three influence tokens to spend which make anything about the world true. These must not contradict existing facts or remove agency from players, but can still drastically alter reality. The world of Conspire quickly becomes unique, bizarre, and wonderfully twisted.<br/><br/>Think of Conspire as a back-room meeting between powerful Illuminati-style leaders. Everyone has the power to shape the world and control humanity. The powerful and greedy have the opportunity to rise even further, using their wit and words to manipulate the rest of the group. Authority is easy to gain and lose, with victors growing complacent and underdogs striking from the shadows.<br/><br/>"}, "213589": {"rpgdesigner": ["Jacob Blackmon", "Mike Lafferty"], "rpg": ["ICONS"], "poll": [], "name": "Death Stalker", "rpgartist": ["Jacob Blackmon"], "rpgproducer": ["Jacob Blackmon"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3259242.jpg", "usersrated": "0", "rpgitemversion": ["PDF version"], "average": "0", "statistics": [], "rpggenre": ["Action / Adventure (Superheroes)"], "rpgpublisher": ["Fainting Goat Games", "Rogue Genius Games"], "rpgcategory": ["Sourcebook (rules/options to enhance play)"], "rpgseries": ["Jacob E.

The game was produced in a polybag, with an A4 map, an A5 booklet of rules and history, and a small sheet of counters. This game was later substantially revised and upgraded and published in a new game Battle of Oshi-jou, with a larger map, revised rules and more than double the number of units.<br/><br/>The 1590 Siege of Oshi (\u5fcd\u57ce\u306e\u6226\u3044 Oshi-j\u014d no tatakai) was a battle during Japan's Sengoku period. Oshi Castle, a stronghold of the Narita clan, was besieged by forces loyal to the Toyotomi clan. The castle was famously defended for over a month by a force consisting of only 619 samurai and 2000 local conscripts against forces numbering over 20,000. The battle is also famous for the actions of Lady Kai (\u7532\u6590\u59eb / Kaihime), who led 200 Narita men into battle to rout the initial attack against the castle.<br/><br/>The game incorporates standard hex-and-counter movement on a map representing the region around the castle. The game proceeds in an &quot;IGO-UGO&quot; manner. Units may perform ranged fire in an attempt to cause enemy units to become disordered (recovery from disorder may be attempted at the beginning of each turn). Enemy units may also return fire to cause disorder on their attackers. Close combat proceeds on a simplified, odds-based combat resolution table using a single die (d6), and can result in disorder, losses and retreat. If an army suffers enough losses, it becomes demoralized, suffering combat penalties and the elimination of any unit that becomes disordered. The game includes special rules for Lady Kai's ability to boost the morale of conscript units under her.<br/><br/>Components:<br/>A4 map (210mm &times; 297mm / 8.3&quot; &times; 11.7&quot;)<br/>50 mounted, back-printed counters (not die-cut)<br/>A5 rulebook: two pages historical notes, four pages &quot;Warring States Folio&quot; series rules, two pages game-specific rules<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": ["Japanese first edition"], "name": "Oshi-j\u014d no tatakai (\u5fcd\u57ce\u306e\u6226\u3044)", "playingtime": "120", "boardgamemechanic": ["Dice Rolling", "Hex-and-Counter"], "average": "0", "usersrated": "0", "age": "10"}, "213646": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3309908.jpg", "poll": [], "boardgamedesigner": ["Geoff Greenwood", "Lucy Greenwood"], "statistics": [], "yearpublished": "2017", "maxplayers": "2", "boardgameartist": ["Nicky Honey"], "boardgamepublisher": ["Golden Ratio Games"], "maxplaytime": "90", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3309908_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "45", "boardgamecategory": ["Fantasy", "Science Fiction"], "description": "Description from the publisher:<br/><br/>Before the planets, before the stars&hellip;<br/>Before the galaxies, before the universe&hellip;<br/>Before time began&hellip;<br/>Incomprehensibly powerful sentiences sought to dominate the preconceptual chaos of their existence and annihilate those that opposed their will.<br/>To the victor, the ultimate prize: creation itself.<br/><br/>In Elementa, each player takes the role of one of these sentiences, aiming to defeat their opponent to ensure they are free to shape a universe to their own design.

The Chaotic Star allows flexible tactics, as players may move a life marker from one planet to another, as long as that planet has the same life creation requirements. Finally, the Red Dwarf allows players to exchange one Space tile in hand for another after creating a planet.<br/><br/>The Space expansion provides more Space tiles for added variety! These special tiles provide no goals, but they do have two effects to choose from, such as taking a tile underneath a planet and transferring it to another planet, or protecting a planet from any Space tiles that might affect it.

The heat of the volcano is being channeled into the crystal! Soon we will have enough energy to perform the ritual.&mdash;Crystal Cult Leader<br/><br/>Crystal Temple includes the exterior dirt path with rock outcroppings and sparse vegetation that leads to the temple entrance and the interior of the crystal temple which features a long hallway of pillars that leads to a large crystal on a dais and benches in side areas to the north and south to view the crystal dais during worship and rituals.<br/><br/>Crystal Temple is intended for use in fantasy or horror games.<br/><br/>Adventure hook for use with this map:<br/><br/>The Cult of Crystalytes: A cult has formed around the worship of a crystal. The cult leader calls his flock crystal acolytes or Crystalytes and urges them to bring more and more people to worship the crystal. With enough people, he promises they will witness a miracle.<br/><br/>As the cult grows, more and more local youth come up missing. Their parents search for adventurers to find their lost sons and daughters, pooling their resources together as payment for the return of their children. The adventurers can figure out the location of the crystal temple in many ways. They could witness a kidnapping and follow them to the temple, track the spoors of the kidnappers and those taken, pose as local villagers to provoke a kidnapping to become kidnapped to arrive at the crystal temple, defeat Crystalyte kidnappers, interrogate them on the crystal&rsquo;s location and steal their robes to infiltrate the cult, etc.<br/><br/>Once they get to the crystal temple, they find the Crystalytes both sitting on benches and standing watching their cult leader on a dais. He seems to be drawing heat through strange mirrors behind the dais that are being collected by the crystal on the dais. As the crystal nears full, the long dormant volcano begins to erupt. The windows and mirrors behind the dais shatter and then lava starts flowing into the crystal temple! The adventurers need to save as many Crystalytes as they can to get back to their families or they may choose to slay the cult leader. The slow lava flowing into the room seems to be drawn towards the crystal before the crystal is engulfed. Once engulfed, the lava gushes out suddenly and starts spreading throughout the temple while flowing much faster than before.<br/><br/>"}, "213689": {"statistics": [], "bgaccessoryversion": ["English edition", "Spanish edition"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3271262.jpg", "description": "This is a promo card contained Summer 2016 Tournament Kit - participation prize.<br/><br/>", "usersrated": "0", "average": "0", "boardgameaccessory": ["Android: Netrunner"], "boardgamepublisher": ["Edge Entertainment", "Fantasy Flight Games"], "poll": [], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3271262_t.jpg", "name": "Android: Netrunner \u2013 Alternate Art Bank Job"}, "213692": {"rpgartist": ["Cliff Kurowski", "Jeremy Mohler"], "rpg": ["Pathfinder System Compatible Product"], "poll": [], "name": "Las Vegas Crawl", "rpgdesigner": ["Brendan LaSalle"], "rpgproducer": ["Joseph Goodman", "Alvin Helms"], "average": "0", "usersrated": "0", "rpgitemversion": ["PDF version"], "rpgsetting": ["Xcrawl"], "statistics": [], "rpggenre": ["Action / Adventure (Sports)", "Fantasy (High Fantasy)", "Modern"], "rpgpublisher": ["Goodman Games"], "rpgcategory": ["Scenario / Adventure / Module"], "rpgseries": ["Maximum Xcrawl"], "description": "From publisher blurb:<br/><br/>An Adventure for Character Levels 6-8 <br/><br/>In Xcrawl, the players are superstar athletes taking their chances in a live-on-pay-per-view death sport.

Their hope was to destroy the southern wing of the German army while it was still reeling from its defeat at Stalingrad. There were large gaps in the German lines and a quick advance here could turn the tide of the war. Time after time the Panzergrenadier Division Grossdeutschland was called upon to reinforce, fill and stabilize weak points, and to close the gaps before the onslaught of Soviet troops could pour through. Oftentimes they were outnumbered and arrived just in the nick of time. As the front stabilized they were called upon again to spearhead the German drives against the Soviet 40th and 69th Armies.<br/><br/>The Soviets made several coordinated attacks during these months, one including Operation Star (February 2-19). During this offensive the Soviets took Belgorod and Kharkov. On the German side Manstein initiated his &quot;Backhand Blow&quot; on February 20. These battles went on through March 5 and beyond. Kharkov was taken back by the Germans in March during this push. Further German advances set up the upcoming summer&rsquo;s battle for Kursk.<br/><br/>The areas around and cities of Belgorod and Kharkov were key points in many of the battles above. Both cities were major transportation hubs and control of the roads between them was critical to both the Soviets and the Germans. Advancing, reinforcements and supply was dependent upon whoever controlled these cities. By the end of February the Soviets were pushing the limits of their endurance and were very near the end of their supply lines. The Germans needed these same cities to stop the enemy advance, form a semblance of a solid line, and prepare for the inevitable counterattacks. Fierce battles raged on and on with many villages and hills along the path changing hands multiple times. Each side's positions for the summer of 1943 campaigns were now at stake.<br/><br/>In this expansion for Fighting Formations we feature the Grossdeutschland Division as it fought in 1943 and early 1944 around the Ukrainian city of Kharkov. In each scenario, one player will take command of elements of this elite German formation while the other assumes control of the opposing forces of the Soviet Union.<br/><br/>Fighting Formations: Grossdeutschland Division's Battle for Kharkov expands upon the original Fighting Formations game by taking the Grossdeutschland Division into 1943 and the winter of 1944. This expansion features ten new scenarios, many using new units for the German and Soviet sides, played on ten new maps.<br/><br/>The new Battle for Kharkov playbook includes the following:<br/><br/>&bull; 10 new scenarios, including many smaller and shorter engagements<br/>&bull; Updated order of battle for GD, encompassing units and hardware added in 1943<br/>&bull; Historical notes covering GD&rsquo;s fighting in the Ukraine<br/><br/>In addition to the new playbook, the game includes 3 large and 2 small back-printed game maps (10 maps total), and a half-sized counter sheet containing new pieces for both the German and Soviet arsenals. New units include:<br/><br/>&bull; The Soviet SU-76M &ldquo;Suka&rdquo; open-topped assault gun;<br/>&bull; SU-85 tank destroyer;<br/>&bull; T-34C;<br/>&bull; T-26b light tank;<br/>&bull; The German Mk VI Tiger I<br/>&bull; PzIII M;<br/>&bull; 7.5cm PaK 40 anti-tank gun;<br/>&bull; Low quality troops representing GD artillerymen forced to fight on the front lines<br/><br/>The new scenarios included in Battle for Kharkov are:<br/><br/>&bull; Cut Off&mdash;Units of the Grossdeutschland Regiment find themselves surrounded by advancing Soviet forces on the highway leading north to Belgorod on 11 February 1943.<br/><br/>&bull; Who&rsquo;s Who&mdash;On 4 November 1943 near Krasny Orlik, Major Frantz, the Assault Gun Battalion commander, became quite wary when he heard the sounds of combat to his north. This northern flank was to be held by 9th Panzer. However, nothing could be seen over the high rail line that divided their two sections of the front. Were they still there and holding the line? Major Frantz decided to investigate the situation for himself and crossed the rail line with another assault gun. As he watched German troops and guns stream by in retreat he found himself in the midst of a tall cornfield with Russian T-34s streaming by at a range of 20 yards. They were faster than he was, and were by him in an instant&hellip;.<br/><br/>&bull; Duel&mdash;General Koniev's 2nd Ukrainian Front launched a major offensive in December of 1943, with the aim to break through the German lines in the Kirovograd area. Multiple attacks were launched and Soviet troops were pouring through. The Panzergrenadier Grossdeutschland Division was brought up to close the gaps and help create a continuous defensive line. There was a critically vulnerable point along the road to the east of the village of Anniska. Here II Battalion, Panzergrenadier Regiment GD was struggling to hold its position. They were reinforced by the anti-aircraft troops of GD's Army FlaK Battalion just in the nick of time.<br/><br/>&bull; Welcome to Kharkov&mdash;21 January 1943: Reports from the Soviet Voronezh Front were that they had broken through the Hungarian army's positions and were advancing into the Novy Oskol area northwest of Kharkov. The Oskol river was being breached and preparations were in progress for further attacks towards Belgorod and Kharkov. General Kazakov's 69th Army was to attack southeast taking Volchansk and then on into Kharkov. Before the city, however, lay Volokonovka, which would provide an opportunity to hit the German's defensive line and test their resolve. Were the German forces finally weakening?<br/><br/>&bull; Charge&mdash;9 March 1943: The 3rd Squadron of &ldquo;Battle Group Strachwitz,&rdquo; after taking fire from nearby Alexandrovka, was assigned the job of taking out the Soviet forces there. Rather than wait, they immediately charged down the slopes into the heavy defensive fire coming directly at them.<br/><br/>&bull; Can We Hold?&mdash;March 17 started out quietly, but it was not to stay that way. The II Battalion of the Grenadier Regiment was sent into Borisovka to free up other GD units for attacking elsewhere. The relieved units left mid-morning. In the late afternoon about a dozen Soviet tanks and infantry charged in from the northeast, broke through the outer line, and drove directly into the village.<br/><br/>&bull; Overrun&mdash;18 February 1943: Kharkov had just fallen to the Soviets and a realignment of the German defensive line was formed to its south. The Grossdeutschland Division's Fusilier Regiment was given the assignment of defending a section of road leading to the west out of Kharkov towards Ljubotin. Rybalko's Soviet 3rd Tank Army was trying to break through this new line southwest of the city. One of his attacks took place on the outskirts of the town of Korotich near a collective farm.<br/><br/>&bull; Just in Time&mdash;The Soviet Voronezh Front had three armies poised to attack towards Kharkov in early February &lsquo;43 as part of Operation Star. Their forces had taken the city of Belgorod as this progressed and they were continuing to push southward to achieve their goal. Delaying actions to slow the advance was all the Germans were capable of at this point in time. The Soviet 40th Army was now northeast of Kharkov and was trying to find a seam between SS Reich units and the Grossdeutschland Division defending outside of Veseloye. They were looking for easy openings in the German line that could be taken advantage of and thus move down the Belgorod-Kharkov highway and into Kharkov itself. Grossdeutschland's reinforced Fusilier Regiment was in the direct line of this advance....<br/><br/>&bull; A Change of Orders&mdash;The Soviets 2nd Ukrainian Front launched a major offensive in late December of 1943 in southern Russia. The attacks began in earnest on 5 January 1944 with the goal of breaking through the German lines in the Kirovograd area. These caused multiple gaps in the German lines. On the evening of January 7 Grossdeutschland units were close at hand and were called upon to help remedy the tenuous situation.<br/><br/>&bull; Tigers&mdash;In early March &lsquo;43 the momentum in the area around the city of Kharkov was turning towards the Germans. Manstein's counterattack was pushing the Soviets back and gaining ground on all sides. Gaps were developing between the Soviet 40th and 69th Armies. On March 4 Grossdeutschland Division received its first Tiger tank company. Three days later GD jumped off, attacking towards Bogodukhov to the northwest of Kharkov.<br/><br/>"}, "213803": {"poll": [], "name": "Konflikt '47: British Starter Set", "playingtime": "0", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": ["Action Point Allowance System", "Dice Rolling", "Point to Point Movement", "Variable Player Powers"], "yearpublished": "2016", "usersrated": "1", "maxplayers": "2", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3300088_t.jpg", "average": "1", "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["Warlord Games"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3300088.jpg", "boardgameversion": ["English edition"], "maxplaytime": "0", "boardgamecategory": ["Miniatures", "Science Fiction", "Wargame", "World War II"], "age": "12", "minplaytime": "0", "description": "March 1947.

The most individually powerful of genie kind, they are undisputed masters of the Elemental Plane of Water, forcing all beneath the waves to bow to their capricious whims. Their underwater kingdoms are said to be beautiful beyond comparison, rivaled only by the grace and beauty of the marids themselves. Free spirits one and all, they chafe at the thought of being enslaved by mortal wizards, though no matter how many times they avenge such injustices, the mortals never seem to learn. It is rumored among these mages that there are some marids who rival&mdash;or even exceed&mdash;the greatest marid nobles in power, and these are the mythic marids.<br/><br/>This book presents game statistics for a mythic marid, which has several unique abilities never seen elsewhere. A mythic marid can bestow her favor on another creature, only to take it away later and force them to suffer from withdrawal. Her mercurial nature makes her incredibly difficult to ensnare. Perhaps a mythic marid&rsquo;s most notorious power is her ability to strip the ability to breathe water from others, dooming them to a watery grave. Finally, in addition to the mythic marid itself, the book contains rules for performing special rituals that can be enacted by characters of any class in order to summon a mythic marid, as well as two such rituals: the cerulean current step, and the chorus of the highest tide.<br/><br/>"}, "213834": {"boardgamedesigner": ["Robert Murelli"], "poll": [], "name": "Four Elements", "playingtime": "25", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": ["Area Movement"], "yearpublished": "2017", "usersrated": "3", "maxplayers": "4", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3528538_t.jpg", "average": "8.46667", "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["(Self-Published)", "Bomber"], "boardgamepodcastepisode": ["Cult of the New Board Game Podcast Episode 031 \u2013 All About Airecon", "JTRPodcast 003 \u2013 Kickstarter Preview \u2013 Four Elements"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3528538.jpg", "boardgameversion": ["First edition"], "maxplaytime": "25", "boardgamecategory": ["Action / Dexterity", "Children's Game"], "age": "6", "minplaytime": "5", "description": "Description from the publisher:'<br/><br/>Fire, Earth, Air, Water.<br/><br/>Four Elements is a quick turn based game, packed with action.<br/>There are no dice, no cards and no rulebook.

Based on the epic, bestselling DC Universe, this game includes many of the well-loved characters that have thrilled comic book fans for generations.These mighty <br/>heroes and their arch nemeses can now assemble at your call, ready to save the world&hellip; or destroy it.<br/><br/>In the DC Universe Miniature Game, you and your friends collect a set of beautiful miniatures of your favorite DC heroes and villains, bring them to life by painting them, and then use them as playing pieces in an exciting multi-faceted, three-dimensional tactical game. You will be weaving your own stories, worthy of the greatest comic book sagas. Whether you&rsquo;re a seasoned veteran of tabletop miniature games, or a new recruit to this rewarding hobby, you&rsquo;ll soon be controlling your own super-team, and battling for control of Metropolis, the Earth at large, or even the entire galaxy!<br/><br/>The DC Universe Miniature Game is designed for two or more players, with each taking control <br/>of a number of finely detailed miniatures, representing their faction, or team. The miniatures are in essence playing pieces, much like those you&rsquo;d find in a board game. But unlike most board games, a miniature game doesn&rsquo;t take place on a readily defined board, but rather the players take an active role in designing their own custom gaming area, usually on a tabletop <br/>populated by scratch-built scenery. The rules use a sophisticated system of power counters <br/>and unique character abilities, allowing you to move your models freely and utilize a large <br/>range of skills and powers to give you a tactical edge over your opponents.<br/><br/>The game is scenario based, although You can play a simple deathmatch just for fun.<br/><br/>Sequence of Play<br/><br/>Each Round is broken down into four distinct phases, which proceed in the following order:<br/><br/>1.  Power Phase: Players distribute Power counters to each of the models in their team, usually <br/>up to the character&rsquo;s Power value. If a character is KO, Power counters are instead generated.<br/><br/>2.  Initiative Phase: Players determine the order in which they will proceed through the round. This <br/>stage adds a level of unpredictability to the game &ndash; you might go first this round, but end up <br/>going last in the next.<br/><br/>3.  Action Phase: The players activate each character in turn &ndash; moving, fighting, shooting, and <br/>resolving special actions. Play alternates, with the player who went first activating a single <br/>model, then the second player activates a model, and so on, until all models that can act <br/>have done so.<br/><br/>4.  Final Phase: Some special effects must also be resolved in this phase. This is also a &lsquo;tidying up&rsquo; phase, where Power counters are removed and scenario victory conditions are checked. If, at the end of the Final Phase, one player&rsquo;s entire crew is Knocked Out and/or has been <br/>removed from play, the game ends and the other player is declared the victor.<br/><br/>Every test/combat (To Hit, Agility etc.) is resolved by rolling dice, usually 2d8.<br/><br/>About the starter set:<br/><br/>This is the incarnation of Batman, Superman &amp; Wonder Woman from the DC cinematic Universe.<br/><br/>Now you can take to the streets of Gotham, Metropolis or even Themyscira with the DC Miniatures game. Take control of Henry Cavill's Superman, Ben Affleck's Batman or Gal Gadot's Wonder Woman and take on DC villains or recreate the fight scenes from Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice.<br/><br/>This blister contains:<br/><br/>- 3 metal miniatures and stat cards for the miniatures.<br/><br/>1x Batman<br/>    1x Superman<br/>    1x Wonder Woman<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": ["English edition"], "maxplaytime": "0", "name": "DC Universe Miniature Game: Batman V Superman Trinity Starter Set", "playingtime": "0", "boardgamemechanic": ["Action Point Allowance System", "Dice Rolling", "Variable Player Powers"], "average": "7.7", "boardgameexpansion": ["225624", "225620", "225827", "225625", "225621", "225622", "225623"], "usersrated": "5", "boardgamefamily": ["Comics: DC Universe", "Components: Miniatures", "Superheroes"]}, "213857": {"poll": [], "name": "Twixel", "videogamemode": ["Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["Windows/Mac Downloadable edition"], "average": "0", "videogametheme": ["Puzzle"], "usersrated": "0", "videogamedeveloper": ["Caesoose Studios"], "videogamegenre": ["Puzzle"], "videogameplatform": ["Macintosh", "Windows"], "statistics": [], "videogamepublisher": ["(Self-Published)"], "description": "Control two independent pixels as you avoid any and all obstacles in the crazily hard and addictive game that is Twixel!<br/><br/>Source: The Developer Website.<br/><br/>"}, "213858": {"poll": [], "name": "Doodle God: 8-bit Mania", "videogamemode": ["Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["Android Edition", "iOS edition", "Windows Downloadable edition"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3428727.png", "videogameseries": ["Doodle God"], "videogametheme": ["Puzzle"], "usersrated": "0", "videogamedeveloper": ["Joybits Ltd."], "videogamegenre": ["Puzzle"], "videogameplatform": ["Android", "iPad", "iPhone", "Windows"], "average": "0", "statistics": [], "videogamepublisher": ["Joybits Ltd."], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3428727_t.png", "description": "Doodle God Has Gone Old School!

If the color of your bee matches the color of the flower you can take 1 or 2 point chips depending on the size of the flower. The point chips are puzzle pieces you can attach to your hive.

These characters represent a declining pagan population that is caught between the New Religion and the spiteful counter religion known as the Growing Evil. This latter division includes ruffians, malicious necromancers, the infamous NecroFiend occultists, and demons from foul depths.<br/><br/>The game is divided into 3 stages to represent the different missions to be undertaken. Each mission/stage involves coping with the New Religion in some way. In the first stage you seek to undo damage created by the New Religion. In the second stage you must impede the New Religion. And finally the third stage requires that you directly confront the New Religion.<br/><br/>GAME-PLAY:<br/>Player guided characters will travel on a map that is generated by land tiles. These tiles are drawn and placed as the characters move from turn to turn. At the same time, game controlled characters known as NecroFiends will be spawned; eventually traveling the tile map through an automated movement system. When player characters run into a NecroFiend, conflict is likely to occur.<br/><br/>In addition to NecroFiends, opposition can emerge through the Occurrence deck (from entering a tile) or through the Demon deck (upon exiting a tile). These encounters gnaw away at a characters vital resource --their followers. Followers are represented by purple cubes. When a game character (aka Leader) takes losses due to conflict, some or all of their followers are removed. A lack of followers makes a character extremely vulnerable and will often lead to elimination from the game if more followers cannot be acquired soon.<br/><br/>Combat in the world of Black Metal is resolved through two means, Brute Conflict and DarkArts Conflict. The former combat type is associated with physical conflict and uses a Combat Results Table involving up to three 4-sided dice. The latter combat type is associated with sorcery and uses a simpler system involving the combatants INSIGHT ratings and a single 4-sided die.<br/><br/>OBJECT:<br/>The player aims to fulfill at least one mission during the game. The game offers the opportunity to perform up to three missions. Missions are drawn from a deck and will describe locations that must be visited, along with actions that must be performed at these locations. Actions often include a special die roll procedure to solidify the outcome. The third mission will always involve conflict (using the games conflict resolution system).<br/><br/>WINNING THE GAME :<br/>To win Black Metal a player must fulfill every mission that is embarked upon. There are 3 levels of success --one for each mission that you accomplish. The game is lost if all player characters perish during the performance of missions, regardless of how many missions have been completed. The earned titles of success are as follows:<br/><br/>1 Mission Fulfilled  = Hero Status<br/>2 Missions Fulfilled  = Liberator Status<br/>3 Missions Fulfilled  = Legend Status<br/><br/>Without losing, you may end a game after any mission (but before another has begun).<br/><br/>"}, "213965": {"rpgdesigner": ["Carl Cramer"], "rpg": ["Pathfinder System Compatible Product"], "poll": [], "name": "Blood Mage", "rpgartist": ["Brett Neufeld"], "rpgproducer": ["Perry Fehr", "Mark Gedak"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3266540.jpg", "usersrated": "0", "rpgitemversion": ["PDF version"], "rpgsetting": ["Porphyra"], "average": "0", "statistics": [], "rpggenre": ["Fantasy (High Fantasy)"], "rpgpublisher": ["Purple Duck Games"], "rpgcategory": ["Sourcebook (rules/options to enhance play)"], "rpgseries": ["Prestige Archetype"], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3266540_t.jpg", "description": "From publisher blurb:<br/><br/>Obsessed with the study of the effects of blood and bloodlines on magic, bloodmages swell their bodies and magnify spell power, attempting to replicate the powers of sorcerer bloodlines by mastering blood magic.<br/><br/>Prestige Class Source: Bloatmage<br/><br/>Build Class Options: The bloodmage is built on the wizard, but the following optional build classes are described below: arcanist, druid, psychic, sacerdote, sorcerer, or witch.<br/><br/>"}, "213967": {"rpgartist": ["Empty Room Studios", "Rick Hershey"], "rpg": ["Generic / Universal"], "poll": [], "name": "Creatures", "rpgdesigner": ["Chris Kentlea"], "rpgproducer": ["Chris Kentlea"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3266539.jpg", "usersrated": "0", "rpgitemversion": ["PDF version"], "average": "0", "statistics": [], "rpggenre": ["Action / Adventure"], "rpgpublisher": ["Ennead Games"], "rpgcategory": ["Sourcebook (rules/options to enhance play)"], "rpgseries": ["Campaign Chunks"], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3266539_t.jpg", "description": "From publisher blurb:<br/><br/>A Campaign Chunk is an item, place or something else that can fit into any campaign or story with little or no modification although some will be more suited to certain genres than others.

The game plays out in twelve rounds, with each round representing one month in a year that seems to go from bad to worse. Disease, drought, and attacks from the Mongols may claim lives, but make sure you have enough money to offer a tribute to the Emperor.<br/><br/>The game play is easier than it may appear. Every player has a set of &quot;person&quot; cards. Each round, you choose one action (most of which call on your workers' abilities) to help you prepare for the months ahead. Then you play one person card, recruiting that person and placing them into one of your palaces. Each person brings different skills and abilities to help you ride out the year. (Farmers help you gain rice to survive a drought month, tax collectors raise money, etc.) At the end of each round, that month's event is triggered, which may cost you some of your workers, some money, or give you points.<br/><br/>Careful planning is the key to surviving &quot;the year of the dragon&quot;, but survival alone may not win you the game.<br/><br/>When you add The Great Wall of China expansion to the game, every player takes the six Great Wall tiles in their color. When a player choose the new action &quot;build Great Wall&quot;, they choose one of their remaining Great Wall tiles, receive from the supply the symbol shown on the tile, then place this tile under the first event tile. The tiles give 1 rice, 1 rocket, 2 yuan, 1 palace level, 3 VP, and 3 spaces on the order track.<br/><br/>For The Super Events, shuffle the ten super event tiles face down, then randomly draw one of them and place it face up on the seventh event tile.
