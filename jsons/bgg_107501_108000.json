The active player draws a card which contains a location (like the Giseh Sphinx, for instance) and then places a transparent round disc on the world map, centering it where s/he believe the thing is located. Then an semi-circular marker is placed around the disk to show where it was placed and the disk is removed. The card is now turned around and reveals which quadrant of the board it belongs to. The quadrants are card-sized, and the cards show a cross with the precise location. Afterwards, the disc is put back on top of the cards - it contains concentric rings which mark how far the player was off. Points are scored depending on how close the player guessed the location.<br/><br/>"}, "107502": {"rpgitemversion": {"124089": "PDF version"}, "poll": {}, "name": "Edge Role Playing Game", "rpghonor": {"20219": "2012 ENnie - Judge\u2019s Spotlight Award Winner"}, "rpgproducer": {"51836": "Caitlin Bergeron"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2339729.jpg", "usersrated": "0", "average": "0", "statistics": {}, "rpg": {"12841": "Edge"}, "rpgcategory": {"2083": "Core Rules (min needed to play)"}, "rpggenre": {"961": "Fantasy"}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2339729_t.jpg", "description": "From publisher blurb:<br/><br/>Where all things collide, there is the Edge.

Players are divided into teams, and then each team will take turns: one player has one minute to explain as many words as possible while the other team members try to guess them quickly to gain more points. Words will be worth more or less points depending on their difficulty, as they could be anything from ordinary objects to entire phrases.<br/><br/>In addition, the team can use special cards that can change the entire course of the game. These &quot;U-cards&quot; can be played before the player begins explaining words, and include abilities such as:<br/>- &quot;First letter&quot;: You are allowed to say the first letter of the word;<br/>- &quot;Additional minute&quot;: You are given one additional minute to explain;<br/>- &quot;Replace a player&quot;: You can change the player who is going to explain the words - this lets competing teams gain an advantage by preventing good players from participating. <br/>- &quot;With closed eyes&quot;  - Have you ever tried to explain something without seeing others?<br/>- &quot;Robbery&quot;: You can guess the word of another team and steal their points<br/><br/>The game contains 200 cards with words.

It was expected to be a normal working day when suddenly the upper galleries of the gold and copper mine collapsed, causing the miners to be trapped for months. In this rescue mission game, you and your team must try to overcome all odds in order to rescue these thirty three (33) trapped miners. To be successful, you and your team must meet all the government&rsquo;s mandatory health, safety and environment (HSE) standards, acquire the necessary gears, and endeavor to avoid danger zones. Remember, the perils and rewards are high - just when you think you are about to enter the chamber to rescue a trapped miner, your mission might suffer a setback as the other rescue team progresses. This game is about individual effort, team work, risk, strategy and sacrifice.<br/><br/>NUMBER OF PLAYERS: 2 - 6. <br/>AGES: 12yrs to adult.<br/>PLAYING TIME: 45-60 minutes.<br/><br/>YOUR CHALLENGE <br/>Your team&rsquo;s objective is to rescue as many trapped miners as possible. This process is not without its challenges such as: the unavailability of cash to acquire the necessary gears, risky danger zones, overcoming fluctuating gear costs imposed by the Greedy Merchant and the ability to meet the mandatory standards imposed by the government through its agency The Bureau of Standards. Lives are at stake! The longer you wait, the more unlikely it will be that the trapped miners will survive. Can you rise to the challenge?

Each player begins with 7 cards from one of the 2 decks and must attempt to play his cards to a community board.  The board is divided into 2 sections, and players must play cards only to their designated spaces on the board, only when adjacent to other placed cards, and only into 1 section per turn.  Players may choose to (or may occasionally be forced to) draw simultaneously from both the Book Deck (which has more of the same cards that were dealt initially) and the Providence Deck (which enables special placements).  Some cards are setbacks when drawn, while others allow opponents to save each other from the setbacks (and benefit themselves in the process.)<br/><br/>The game can be played in either of 2 ways.  The Standard Version contains a few extra cards which force play to the board and which create blockages on the board that can be removed only through cooperative effort.  This extra layer of complexity provides opportunity for cooperative play and additional strategy which is not available in the much simpler Family Version of the game (which is better suited for children and casual gamers.)  In addition to removing a few cards from the decks, the Family Version allows for a different ending to the game: where the Standard Version is resolved in a Discard Phase that awards victory to the lowest scorer, the Family Version is won simply when any player goes out, having played all their cards on their turn.<br/><br/>Words of Wisdom: the Game has an overtly Biblical theme.

Additionally, this player can choose to play one or more market barker cards to &quot;call&quot; the customer past one or more stalls, presumably to bring the customer to that player's own stall.

Due to the beat 'em up and fighting game genres being popularized by the successes of Capcom's arcade-hits Final Fight and Street Fighter II, Tatsumi added two different modes to Big Fight: a beat 'em up mode and a versus fighting game mode.<br/><br/>In &quot;Mission Mode&quot; (or &quot;STORY Mode&quot; according to the official website and arcade flyer), similar to Final Fight, one or two players must choose between three characters Kevin, Gear or Zill, before beginning the game simultaneously. Each character has their own fighting style, special moves and statistics. Players control with a joystick and two buttons: one for attacking and one for jumping. Like Final Fight, players can press both buttons to perform special moves that attack in both directions, which costs health. Players are also able to attack their opponents laying on the floor, throw their opponents, pick up health items for health recovery and use weapons as additional ways to protect themselves while fighting enemies. Some weapons can be used several times, some only once.<br/><br/>Unlike Final Fight, at the half of the first level, players will have to choose between three routes to walk through, each having their own difficulty. At the end of each later level, players will face a boss, and when he or she is defeated, he or she will join in and become playable while the players can select whoever teamed up with the last characters players played, except for the last two Dr. D and TX-No.3. Another feature that differentiates it from other beat 'em ups is when a player is knocked to the ground, an &quot;Angle Power&quot; bar appears, requiring the player to rapidly press the punch button to fill it up before it vanishes. When successfully filled, the players' characters will be lightning charged and automatically perform their special moves while setting any nearby enemies on blue fire and stay charged up for a short time. Players are also able to shoot blue flames with the punch buttons while charged.<br/><br/>In order to access &quot;1P vs. 2P Mode&quot; (or &quot;VS.

The scrolling battlefield shows every detail a real combat leader would see: hills, forests, depressions and rough terrain.  Your troops are always on-screen while realistic visibility rules have enemy units flashing on or off (this depends on whether at least one of your men has spotted them or not).<br/><br/>You can even choose the level of command you want: company commander, platoon leader, or squad leader.  At your disposal are over 70 tanks, each historically rated for armor thickness and strength, speed and fire accuracy.  You can choose from the classic Nazi Tiger tank to the ultra-modern Abrams M-1.<br/><br/>When you use the joystick and simple one-key keyboard commands, your men will execute your orders in real time.  They look, move, stop, retreat, advance, patrol and fire the instant you tell them to do so.  No waiting, no delaying.

The 74th Division of the Chinese 57th Army (nicknamed as &quot;Growling Tiger Division&quot;) was ordered to defend Changde and fate will decide the outcome of the battle.<br/><br/>The Battle of Changde began on 18th November 1943 when the Imperial Japanese 11th Army under the command of Isamu Yokoyama already approached the strongholds in the suburbs of Changde with around 20,000 men under three divisions. The Japanese 116th Division in the northwest began to attack the Chinese defenders at Huangtu Mountain and the Hefu Mountain while the Japanese 68th Division in the east began to attack Shigongmiao and Xinmin Bridge (XinminQiao). The Japanese 3rd Division in the south advanced towards the southern bank of Yuan River after they took Deshan. On 25th November 1943 these three Japanese Divisions were outside Changde City.<br/><br/>The Chinese garrisons in the fortifications inside the city near the eastern, northern and western gates engaged the Japanese Forces continuously without any rest with the Japanese having firepower supremacy in both air force bombardments and artillery fires. On 28th November 1943, Japanese General Yokoyama launched simultaneous attacks on all the four gates. Despite the Chinese 57th Division fought valiantly, the city wall had fallen.<br/><br/>At the same time, reinforcements from the Chinese 19th Division were advancing towards Hefu and the 190th Division had begun to counterattack from the east. At this very moment, the overall commander of the defending garrison at Changde, Division Commander Yu Ching Man issued his last telegraph to Sun Lianzhong in this battle. &quot;No more ammunition, without reinforcement, the city has fallen.&quot;<br/><br/>Sun was the deputy commander of the Sixth Front On 1st December 1943, reinforcements from the Chinese 10th Army have captured positions at Deshan and the Chinese 3rd Division and the 10th Division were approaching from the southern bank to help the Changde garrison though they were unable to contact with the 57th Division, thereby failing to make concerted attack. On 3rd December 1943, the Chinese Regiment Commander Chai Yee Sun died gloriously while leading the last Chinese combat unit when covering the retreat of General Yu Ching Man and the remnants of the 57th division. On 6th December, the Japanese found themselves attacked by seven corps from the Chinese Sixth Front and the Ninth Front and the Japanese high command decided to withdraw to prevent the annihilation of the Japanese 11th Army.<br/><br/>On 7th December, General Yu Ching Man led the remnants of the 57th Division and coordinated with the 11th Division to attack Changde. On 9th Division, the Chinese entered the city through the Eastern gate and recovered Changde City. The Japanese withdrew back to the original frontline in early January 1944. In this battle, less than 300 of the original 8,000 defenders survived and the Japanese lost more than 4,000 soldiers in the sieget with total casualties of the campaign around 10,000. Chinese casualties were more than 100,000 but they held the City of Changde at a terrible price.<br/><br/>Scale<br/>1hex = 800m , unit = bataillon.

Each player starts with a lord, a castle and some troops in one of the villages.<br/><br/>At the end of each round, check to see whether one or more players have won, with shared wins being possible through alliances created by marriage. Winning solo is tough, so players need to negotiate, make deals and form alliances. To do this, players use their three embassy pawns; by spending a pawn, a player can have a three-minute-long private conversation with one or more other players to make whatever deals they wish. You have only three pawns, so plan well for these talks!<br/><br/>Players draw cards each round: character cards that can bring new lords into play and event cards such as good harvests, good weather and taxes. They pay the costs to play cards, with some cards being playable at any time to upset current events with a surprise assassination or underground invasion. Players then receive income, with which they can buy troops and buildings, and move lords and troops among villages, with troops never being able to travel without a lord. If troops from more than one player end up in the same village, they battle until one side is eliminated or forced to flee.<br/><br/>If a player controls all villages in a fief and has at least one castle there, he can purchase the title of the fief and assign it to a lord, with the title being passed to an heir if the lord subsequently dies. Players also try to secure the titles of king and pope, which provide benefits of their own, as well as points.

Octavian has declared Marc Antony and his Egyptian queen, Cleopatra, enemies of Rome and the legions march south toward Alexandria. The situation seems dire for Marc Antony following destruction of his fleet at the Battle of Actium, but in the dusty hills of Macedonia a dark secret of the empire is waiting to be unveiled.<br/><br/>Governor Publius Artorius Stabo thought he was comfortably distant from the war. He was happy taking bribes and tribute from the local Macedonian nobles, indulging himself with slave girls, and avoiding his shrew of a wife. Then, a ragged band of survivors from Actium washed up on his shores, a group of Marc Antony&rsquo;s legionnaires and a collection of Egyptian priests and priestesses who claim they are carrying a secret weapon to crush the forces of Octavian.<br/><br/>Suddenly, his palace is full of opinionated nobles, Roman officials, and military men, all with different opinions of what need to be done with these castaways. Something&rsquo;s not sitting right in the pit of the governor&rsquo;s stomach, and it&rsquo;s not just the pickled larks tongues in aspic.

The Russians, alerted by their intelligence network, were well prepared for the attack.  The battle that followed was to be the largest tank battle of World War II.  Germany's IX Army, responsible for the northern strike, advanced only six miles and was immediately repulsed.  The IV Panzer Army, attacking from the south, was more successful.  Before being defeated, it was able to penetrate 25 miles to the town of Prokhorovka, just 50 miles short of Kursk.  OBJECTIVE: KURSK is the grand-tactical simulation of this southern conflict.<br/><br/>The Game<br/>Consider its scope: 12 Panzer and Panzer Grenadier divisions and 9 Soviet armored and mechanized infantry corps - a sum total of more than 4000 tanks!  It is the first computer game ever to resolve such a massive battle down to every tank, every gun, every infantryman!  How did we do it?  By harnessing the power of the computer to its fullest.  Our sophisticated program takes care of all of the number crunching and administrative headaches so you won't have to.  Not only is a game of such detail and scale practical, it is also fun and fast!<br/><br/>Starting early in July 1943, this game gives the Germans 11 days to take their objective: Kursk.  As in the real battle, the task is anything but easy.  If you're playing the Germans, your advance will be impeded by the endless minefields that your engineers must clear.  Then, there is the rain - the frequent, awful downpour that turns the Russian countryside into paralyzing gullies.  All this before you even worry about the 2000 T-34 and KV-1 tanks of the Russian Army waiting for you!  Your only advantages are the superior morale of your troops and the fact that you move first.  But perhaps, these two factors - coupled with your skill and cunning - will be enough to change the historical outcome of the Battle of Kursk.<br/><br/>By Gary Grigsby<br/><br/>"}, "107730": {"statistics": {}, "name": "Rugby Challenge", "videogamemode": {"2313": "Cooperative"}, "videogameversion": {"124564": "Australian PlayStation 3 edition"}, "average": "7.33333", "videogameseries": {"28146": "Rugby Challenge"}, "videogametheme": {"2405": "Sports - Other"}, "usersrated": "3", "videogamegenre": {"2157": "Sports"}, "videogameplatform": {"4435": "PlayStation 3"}, "poll": {}, "description": "Rugby Challenge for console and PC is a new title in development by Wellington based games developer Sidhe and published by Sydney based Home Entertainment Suppliers (HES) under their Tru Blu Games label.

In common with their other titles, the Beagle Bag software was released in unlocked and unprotected form, and is now in the public domain.<br/><br/>Buzzword!<br/><br/>In Buzzword!, a children's game based on Mad Libs, the computer relates a short story in which certain key words are replaced with blanks. Each time the story reaches a blank, the user selects a letter and the computer then randomly inserts a word from its vocabulary starting with that letter. Buzzword! comes with five pre-made stories and also allows users to create their own.<br/><br/>In addition to entering a custom story, the Beagle Bag manual also includes instructions about how to edit Buzzword!'s vocabulary.<br/><br/>Elevators<br/><br/>Elevators challenges the player to use four elevators to deliver as many carloads of passengers as possible in a short period of time (5:00 to 5:30). Passengers appear on any of ten different floors in a high-rise building and must be collected by sending one of four elevator cars to the correct floor and back down again. The movement of each car can be controlled separately by three rows of keys: 1, 2, 3 and 4 to move up, A, S, D and F to move down, and Q, W, E and R to stop. Power can also be cut to certain cars, allowing others to move more quickly.<br/><br/>Each carload of passengers delivered to the ground floor earns the player a point. Points are displayed to the left of the building, the time of day to the right.<br/><br/>Gas Crunch<br/><br/>This simple game involves taking turns with the computer to remove gas cans from a wall. Both the player and the computer can choose to remove one, two or three cans each time, with the object of not having to take the last remaining can.<br/><br/>Hang Person<br/><br/>Hang Person is a simple hangman-style game in which the player must guess the letters of a word or short phrase. For each incorrect guess, another piece of the person is drawn in; six incorrect guesses lose the game. Hang Person allows a user to play by themselves against the computer, or to enter a word of their own (up to 14 characters) that a second user must guess. Instructions on how to edit the computer's vocabulary of 150 words are given in the manual.<br/><br/>Magic Pack<br/><br/>This program acts as an aid to performing four separate magic tricks described in the accompanying manual: &quot;Plenty Questions&quot;, in which the computer attempts to guess the object someone's thinking of; &quot;21 Numbers&quot;, a number guessing trick; &quot;Next Word&quot;, in which the computer and the player create a logical series of words; and &quot;Card Scanner&quot;, in which the computer purports to identify a playing card held against the screen.<br/><br/>Oink!<br/><br/>Oink! is a two-player dice-rolling game with each player taking turns rolling to score points. Players can reroll to achieve better results, but lose their turn if the dice show doubles. First to 200 points wins the game.<br/><br/>A version of Oink! was used in experiments conducted in the mid-1980s to test for the existence of psychokinesis, the results of which were published in the Journal of Parapsychology.<br/><br/>Pick-A-Pair<br/><br/>Similar to Concentration or H\u016bsker D\u016b?, Pick-A-Pair is a two-person memory game played on a 4x4 array of 16 numbers, behind each of which is a symbol. Players take turns revealing, two at a time, the symbols behind each number; if the two they pick match, the two are removed and the player earns points equal to the sum of the two numbers. The first player to earn 68 points wins the game.<br/><br/>Quick-Draw!<br/><br/>Quick-Draw! is a two-player cowboy shoot-out game. Each round the computer selects an abstract &quot;firing symbol&quot; which it displays between the two gunmen, then quickly cycles through various random symbols including the one it selected. If a player fires while the correct symbol is shown and does so quicker than his opponent, he'll win the round. If he fires while the wrong symbol is shown, his opponent get a free shot.<br/><br/>Points are awarded on how quickly players can make successful shots and are displayed beneath each cowboy. Scores rounded off to the nearest whole number appear on each cowboy's hat. First player to 10 points wins.<br/><br/>Slippery Digits<br/><br/>This game is a sliding puzzle that challenges the player to sequentially order 15 numbered tiles within a 4x4 playing area using as few moves as possible. Slippery Digits has two styles of play: one in which the number of each tile is shown, and another more challenging one in which each numbers begins hidden and only appears when it's in its proper position.<br/><br/>Sub Search<br/><br/>In this submarine-hunting game, the player must identify the locations of a random number of submarines hidden within the playing area. The player moves his ship north, south, east or west, and the areas over which the ship travels light up green. If a submarine is within the area through which the ship has moved, it will appear as a black silhouette; moving directly over a submarine marks it as found. To help direct the search, the player can use a sonar-like scanner to faintly reveal where submarines are located.<br/><br/>The player must manage oxygen and fuel supplies, both of which are assigned in random quantities at the beginning of the game and quickly diminish. An &quot;equalizer&quot; balances the two, and a &quot;jump&quot; function allows the player to jump to a random location in the playing area. The final score is based on the percentage of subs found multiplied by one thousand, plus the amount of fuel and oxygen remaining.<br/><br/>TextTrain<br/><br/>TextTrain is a train simulator that uses a word or other series of letter to represent the cars of a train. The game's object is to couple together a pre-defined series of freight cars and pull them to the Check Station at the top of the track as quickly as possible. The player can move the train forward or backward around the tracks and onto sidings, open and close switches and couple and uncouple cars. Coupling a car ahead of the engine or driving into a closed switch will derail the train and end the game.<br/><br/>Triple Digits<br/><br/>TripleDigits is a numbers game for two players. Each player is dealt a set of thirteen digits (0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 and 8); one plays white, the other black. Numbers are placed one at a time in the unoccupied squares of a 9x8 board according to the computer's instructions. Scoring is based on the number that was played and its two adjacent digits, read together as a single number; for instance, a row of 2, 4 and 6 would yield a score of 246. Rows can be vertical, horizontal or diagonal. TripleDigits ends when all the numbers have been played or one of the players resigns.<br/><br/>Wowzo<br/><br/>The object of Wowzo is for each player to move his &quot;man&quot; (represented on the board by the first three letters of his name) through the maze and land on each letter of a five-letter keyword before his opponent does. The letters of the keyword, which is entered by a player at the start of the game, are scattered randomly throughout the maze. Players can move their men left, right, up or down; the man will continue to move in that direction until it hits a wall or encounters one of the letters of the keyword (which grants a free turn).<br/><br/>Each player on his turn can also open or close one of many &quot;gates&quot; in the maze's walls, represented by letters. Doing so can open shortcuts to letters or block one's opponent. The first player to collect all the letters of the keyword wins.<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;Beagle Bag&quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "107788": {"poll": {}, "name": "The Game of Pegpen", "playingtime": "0", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": {"2043": "Area Enclosure"}, "yearpublished": "1929", "usersrated": "0", "boardgamefamily": {"24777": "Dots and Boxes"}, "maxplayers": "2", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic658581_t.jpg", "average": "0", "statistics": {}, "boardgamepublisher": {"329": {"name": "Whitman"}}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic658581.jpg", "boardgameversion": {"124706": "Whitman edition 1929"}, "maxplaytime": "0", "boardgamecategory": {"1009": {"name": "Abstract Strategy"}}, "age": "0", "minplaytime": "0", "description": "The Game of Pegpen is a sort of Dot and Boxes game on the 5x5 grid with a significant twist.

You start out with a single character (from one of seven regular species), and can add up to 9 additional, individually defined followers. All characters start in their home system, Star Date 2918.1, with a Transport Cyborg and 30,000 Frilbees (the standard interstellar currency). Armed with this basic stake, and a few weapon and advanced skills, the player guides their character through life in the interstellar society of the 30th century. This life, at first, consists primarily of meetings with an ever-changing variety of your fellow creatures, including some very strange ones. These meetings are your source for money (job offers and seffing rare items), skill advancement (job offers and RNA tabs) and, most importantly, fellow adventurers. You can get followers by hiring them from the creatures you meet or by buying a special species, for example, a warrior robot.<br/><br/>After you've gotten a band of adventurers together, equipped them, and trained them, you'll be ready for the next step -- taking them out on an adventure. These adventures can vary from exploring strange alien worlds for the Adventurer's Guild to working on cases for the Agency or the Space Patrol to visiting the ancient sites of a vanished race for the Sensitive's Guild to whatever your imagination can devise. If you survive your first adventure, you'll become a Trial Adventurer. This is just the first step on the road to the highest honor: the title of Independent Adventurer. There are many possible paths to the top, but they are all long, dangerous, and exciting.<br/><br/>Galactic Adventures, in addition to being a role-playing game, is an adventuring system. The various home systems and existing adventures provide a framework within which you can create your own adventures. These adventures can include activities such as piloting your own space ship through a hyper-gate; space battles with Gorsai pirates; hand-to-hand combat with such creatures as berserk robots, the Mole People, mutants, and anything else you want to create; and performing jobs ranging from picking a lock to working with a quantum black hole.

It models the Lockheed-Martin F-16C Block 50/52 in a full-scale war on the Korean Peninsula. F4 has been popular among combat sim pilots due to its dynamic war campaign engine, detailed aircraft avionics, and multi-player capabilities. Continual development of the simulation by community members has allowed F4 to live on years after the MicroProse studios were shut down and official development of the sim ceased.<br/><br/>Who are we?<br/><br/>Benchmark Sims is one of the few remaining F4 development groups comprised of &quot;community members&quot;. Our first beta release for an F4 mod was in September of 2003. We've done our best to add still more improvements to F4 in the meanwhile. &quot;Falcon BMS&quot; is now the official name of our community mod for the original Falcon 4.0.<br/><br/>What have we accomplished?<br/><br/>BMS has worked on an array of features and our goal with the articles is to try and bring back that same excitement the old MicroProse developer's notes gave us all years ago. We could just say something like &quot;we've coded a new flight model&quot; but without any documentation, there would be no appreciation as to just how difficult it was, how long it took to get right, or how detailed it is. We think some of our features will make your jaw drop--it does ours!

The objective is to collect the best Fortune Hand from several rounds of drafting. The twist is that players control the number of cards to draft, points they score, and Fortune Hands they make through a common mechanism that leads to many strategic decisions and tactical plays.<br/><br/>Players begin with ten cards and starts by drafting five cards. Players will then play cards or pass. Each card they play will reduce the number of cards to be drafted next, as well as be the additional stakes of the player. The cards played will also form a common pool of cards that players can use to form the best Fortune Hand. Once four cards have been played, players can either play the fifth and final card or draw and discard a card.<br/><br/>The discarded card can be stolen by other players, so players have to be careful with discards and the ever-increasing stakes as the game progresses. Once the fifth card is played, the players will compare Fortune Hands and the winner will score points based on stakes played and a Fortune Modifier. The game ends after every player has a chance to deal, or after a pre-agreed number of rounds.<br/><br/>To excel in F3, you will need the cunning of a boardgame player, the opportunistic instincts of a Hold'em player, the tactical savvy of a Mahjong player, and the risk-taking skills of a Hanafuda player.

Nestled on the northern shores of Lake Winandermere (nowadays known as Lake Windermere), it&rsquo;s a place where everyone knows their neighbors, works hard from dawn until dusk and attends mass every Sunday. They bring in their crops, haul in their fishing nets and work in their shops.<br/><br/>However Dunbriar is a place with a sinister past. Not long ago the village suffered a drought, a Viking raid and a plague all in the same year. After so much tragedy the people of Old Dunbriar, those who were left, fled. For three years the village lie abandoned. There were tales of witchcraft, strange creatures stalking the forests around the village and satanic influence over the village, which people took to calling &quot;Thrice Damned Dunbriar.&quot;<br/><br/>Things are different now, people have returned, building new lives for themselves. The people of the Dunbriar colony are looking forward, to the future. However the past is not dead, but lurking all about the peaceful seeming community. Secrets are waiting to be discovered, old threats are returning and dangers lurk around every hillside, behind ever tree, beneath the still waters of Lake Winandermere and even under the very feet of those living there. No one knows the truth of Dunbriar&rsquo;s past, and those ignorant of the past may be doomed to repeat it.<br/><br/>Thrice Damned Dunbriar is a fully detailed setting for Cthulhu Dark Ages, in the style of the classic &quot;Lovecraft County Series.&quot; It contains four scenarios, allowing players to take on the role of new colonists of the Dunbriar Colony, although the setting is perfect for use as a pre-established setting.<br/><br/><br/>admin comment<br/>moved to (Unpublished Products) on August 23, 2016<br/>we assume this was never published due to the death of Keith Herber<br/><br/>"}, "107820": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1085622.jpg", "poll": {}, "boardgamedesigner": {"9": {"name": "Alan R.

However, more recently it has been made available free.<br/><br/>Captain Comic II is a platform game and like its predecessor has the concepts of shield points (health), lives, a score, items, enemies, zones and objectives.<br/><br/>The primary health indicator is the shield. Once the shield points are exhausted by coming into contact with enemy units and then he is struck again (or if he is hit for more damage than his remaining shields), Comic loses a life. Additionally, if Comic falls off the bottom of a screen a life is lost. If Comic finds a bonus shield it will restore the points to maximum, or add the shield to his inventory for later use if already at full. The game is over when Comic loses all of his lives (or completes the main objective of the game).<br/><br/>Bonus items can generally be found in strategic locations or inside boxes or crates that need to be opened up or destroyed by use of the pick-axe tool (one of the first goals of the game should therefore be to obtain the pick-axe). Items range from gems (points), shields (health), to tools that can be used for other purposes. A notable addition is the magic wand which can turn some useless items into useful items, ranging from powerups to keys. Generally, items also add to the game score when collected. One new feature in this version of the game is the ability to change &quot;active&quot; it (perhaps a requirement since there are now many more items to collect and use). For example, the primary item in use is the firing weapon, but when it is time to use the pick-axe tool (or key, or screwdriver, etc), Comic can select that item from his inventory.<br/><br/>Comic must also avoid or destroy various enemies in the game, primarily by use of his firepower which he obtains by collecting Blastola Cola (again, one of the first goals early in the game should be to acquire this item). Enemies range from simple units on pre-set paths to more difficult combatants that follow Comic or seek him out directly. Some enemies move faster than others, and most are restricted to their domain (fish enemies in water, for example). All enemies have the same general property in that when they come in contact with Comic they are destroyed, but reduce his shield points accordingly (from one to four shield points depending on the enemy, as opposed to two regardless of type in Captain Comic). Destroying enemy units by shooting them also increases the game score (100 to 400 points, depending on how many shield points would normally be deducted - note that some enemies cannot be destroyed by shooting them).<br/><br/>The game is divided into major areas, each with smaller zones. Passing from one zone or area into another marks a safe point (although this version of the game also has a save-game feature). Typically areas are identified by the presence of doorways, which require the correct key (in the previous Episode one key opened all doors; in this Episode there are multiple keys denoted by color or design).<br/><br/>Comic can complete the main objective in the game, by successfully navigating areas and obtaining items (particularly tools) in what can be viewed as smaller objectives. For example, Comic must find the local leader to get the storyline, but also direction on obtaining the 'Temple Key' as a first objective. But there is also the side effect of learning where to acquire the pick-axe (from the guys working on the Escape Pods). As Comic works his way through the stages of the game, he collects more and better items to help with the increasingly difficult areas (particularly with regard to the enemies he must face).<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;Captain Comic II: Fractured Reality&quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "107824": {"statistics": {}, "name": "Megapanel", "videogamemode": {"2422": "Local Multiplayer"}, "videogameversion": {"124819": "JP Mega Drive edition"}, "average": "0", "videogametheme": {"2455": "Abstract"}, "usersrated": "0", "videogamegenre": {"2165": "Puzzle"}, "videogameplatform": {"4426": "SEGA Genesis"}, "poll": {}, "description": "MegaPanel is a 1990 puzzle video game produced by Namco for the Sega Mega Drive.

The roar of the aircraft's engines were hardly drowned-out by that of the crowds as they witnessed aerial duels in which planes and pilots were pushed to their limits and sometimes beyond.<br/><br/>September's Eagles is a low level, fun to play game on the Thompson Trophy Air Race of 1929-1939. Players use cards to activate their planes and pilots, and to stymie (Trump) the moves of their opponents. Play is very interactive, intense and true to the history.<br/><br/>The colorful counters represent all of the major aircraft of the period, and pilot cards portray the famous aviators. In more detail, the game includes 36 different planes, from the first race winner (the Travelair R 'Mystery Ship') to the iconic Gee Bee R-1 and Roscoe Turner's 'Gilmore'. Planes are rated for endurance, turning radius, ability to climb or dive and speed. Thirty-three different pilots are represented, including pilots such as Jimmy Doolittle, Steve Wittman and Howard Hughes. Each pilot is rated for his skill level and fatigue. A deck of 54 Action Cards are used by players to move and maneuver their planes as well as rallying their planes and pilots. Players may also play cards on other players to disrupt their game.<br/><br/>Each game of September's Eagles comes with a full color and extensively illustrated Rules of Play booklet. In it is a comprehensive example of play to assist in learning the game. Along with the Rules of Play booklet comes a Racing Program which allows for the gaming of all the Thompson Trophy Races starting with the first in 1929 through to the final one in 1939.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": {"125037": "English first edition"}, "age": "12", "name": "September's Eagles: The Thompson Trophy Air Races, 1929-1939", "playingtime": "120", "boardgamemechanic": {"2014": "Betting/Wagering"}, "average": "4.75", "usersrated": "2", "boardgamefamily": {"8374": "Crowdfunding: Kickstarter"}}, "107908": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1366480.jpg", "poll": {}, "boardgamedesigner": {"812": {"name": "Paul Rohrbaugh"}}, "statistics": {}, "yearpublished": "2012", "maxplayers": "2", "boardgameartist": {"46618": "Bruce Yearian"}, "boardgamepublisher": {"17180": {"name": "High Flying Dice Games"}}, "maxplaytime": "90", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1366480_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "90", "boardgamecategory": {"1019": {"name": "Wargame"}}, "description": "Blitzkrieg Undone: The Battle of Hannut: May 12-13, 1940, is a low complexity level game of the battle between the Allied Armed forces and Germany's Wehrmacht on May 12th and 13th, 1940 at Hannut, Belgium (near Gembloux). Hannut was the largest tank battle to yet occur during the Second World War. The Germans launched Operation Yellow, the invasion of France and the Low Countries, on May 10, 1940. The Allies anticipated the Germans would strike through neutral Belgium as they had in WWI, and planned on confronting them there on the Belgian plain.

Spin the spinner and turn over the top card from the centre of the board that matches the colour on the spinner. If the card selected has footprints on it, move your Gruffalo's Child playing piece forward. The card may have 1, 2 or 3 footprints. This game has strong educational components and helps children learn through social interaction as well as taking turns and co-operation, all whilst having great fun.<br/><br/>"}, "107925": {"poll": {}, "name": "Inspector McClue: The Red Rose Murders", "playingtime": "0", "minplayers": "6", "boardgamemechanic": {"2073": "Acting"}, "yearpublished": "2010", "usersrated": "0", "maxplayers": "8", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1091341_t.jpg", "average": "0", "statistics": {}, "boardgamepublisher": {"486": {"name": "Paul Lamond Games Ltd"}}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1091341.jpg", "boardgameversion": {"125079": "First Edition"}, "maxplaytime": "0", "boardgamecategory": {"1039": {"name": "Deduction"}}, "age": "13", "minplaytime": "0", "description": "Murder mystery dinner party game.<br/>In the dog-eat-dog world of 1950s Hollywood there's only room for one top-dog - and he's the cigar-chomping agent to the stars, Rich Toad.

The result is a fast-paced game in which players must constantly calculate the best path to take and the best way to hinder the opponent's tokens.  Although the experienced player will usually win, still there is often a chance for both players right up until the last move.<br/><br/>Quorsum avoids both the predictable setup of most strategy games, and the swings of luck in most dice games.

For demonstration purposes in ECTS September 1993, a 486 DX4 100 MHz was used.<br/><br/>Ideally it is desired to run this combat flight simulation on a 80486 based PC @ 66 MHz or higher with an SVGA PCI graphics card to obtain good video graphic frame rates. The simulation runs rather nicely in DOS mode on an Intel Pentium microprocessor based PC.<br/><br/>The pilot could fly 3 planes: The Eurofighter, the F-22 and the F-117. The payload for each plane could be fine-tuned by the player according to mission type.<br/><br/>The possible modes of play included an instant-action arcade mode, custom missions or the campaign (Tour of Duty).<br/><br/>The campaign mode sees you taking the role of a pilot flying for the fictional, United Nations Air Force flying missions in one of five theatres (Colombia, Somalia, Libya, the Balkans and also the South Georgia Islands). The tour of duty was designed to offer a &quot;soap opera&quot; approach, where actions from the players would affect the world and following missions, as well as reaction in the front page of journals according to what the player did. The Eurofighter finally flew for the United Nations for real in March 2011 as part of the UN no-fly zone enforcement in Libya.<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;TFX (video game)&quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "107971": {"poll": {}, "name": "QI the Board Game", "playingtime": "0", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": {"2035": "Roll / Spin and Move"}, "yearpublished": "2011", "usersrated": "60", "maxplayers": "6", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1089581_t.jpg", "average": "4.70833", "statistics": {}, "boardgamepublisher": {"486": {"name": "Paul Lamond Games Ltd"}}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1089581.jpg", "boardgameversion": {"125233": "First Edition"}, "maxplaytime": "0", "boardgamecategory": {"1064": {"name": "Movies / TV / Radio theme"}}, "age": "8", "minplaytime": "0", "description": "Game based on the very funny 'quiz' show.

Designed for those players, that enjoy strategic planning and quick thinking.<br/><br/>QF is played using the same cards as the core set &ndash; each card has two symbols on it, there are 12 different symbols altogether. Most of the cards are identical to the ones in the core set, while others have different symbol combinations on them. The set also includes a few special text cards (action cards).<br/><br/>The goal of the game is the same as in The Enigma of Leonardo, to collect Secret Keys, by making sequences of identical symbols but this time the game is played on one big field. The field itself is made during game play, the only restriction being its size &ndash; 5x5 cards. The first card is placed in the middle of the playing field, players then take turns at playing cards, increasing the field. In the end, the first card that was played might not even be in the middle anymore, it could be on the edge.<br/><br/>Players can not only play cards on empty spaces, they can play cards on top of each other and can even replace cards from their hands with the ones on the playing field. The only condition is that the cards being replaced must share a common symbol. This playing mechanic allows for more complex combos, by careful planning, one can gradually replace all the cards on the field with symbols that the player needs.<br/><br/>Just like in The Enigma of Leonardo, in QF players receive Secret Keys when they successfully make a row of cards with the same symbol. But now you can get symbols not only for 3 cards in a row, but for four and even five identical symbols. Qunitis fontis actually means &ndash; &ldquo;the fifth symbol&rdquo;, when translated from Latin. Rows can be made horizontally, diagonally and vertically just like in the core game but now you can receive the same key more than once by first making a row of three symbols and then adding cards with the fourth and fifth symbol.<br/><br/>But it sounds much easier than it actually is. The game now uses a special counter-marker called &ldquo;veto&rdquo;. After playing a card, the player may choose to move the marker on any card (even the one he just played) on the playing field. The next player cannot play any cards that share a symbol with the marked card. It&rsquo;s up to the players to decide should they move the marker each turn or keep it in one place blocking a certain symbol combination for the entire game.<br/><br/>Another new addition to QF are the action cards. There aren&rsquo;t much compared to another expansion of the game The Enigma of Leonardo &ndash; Novem &ndash; but they can alter the flow of the game. With these cards you can steal symbols from your opponents and prevent them from gaining new ones.<br/><br/>The player who successfully collects seven Keys is the winner. If the deck is used up and no one has collected seven Keys, the one to collect the most is the winner. In case of a tie a key gradation has been provided.<br/><br/>QF is basically a harder version of The Enigma of Leonardo: the rules are different but the cards used are practically identical. Meaning you can try playing The Enigma of Leonardo using QF or vice versa. It will be a slightly different game, but it&rsquo;s still possible.<br/><br/><br/>Reimplements:<br/><br/>    The Enigma of Leonardo<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>"}, "107977": {"boardgamedesigner": {"51974": {"name": "Julien Percot"}}, "poll": {}, "name": "Point Final", "playingtime": "0", "minplayers": "2", "yearpublished": "2010", "usersrated": "2", "maxplayers": "10", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1275243_t.jpg", "average": "5.5", "statistics": {}, "boardgamepublisher": {"18556": {"name": "Percot Rondeau \u00c9ditions"}}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1275243.jpg", "boardgameversion": {"125240": "Percot Rondeau French first edition"}, "maxplaytime": "0", "boardgamecategory": {"1023": {"name": "Bluffing"}}, "age": "10", "minplaytime": "0", "description": "Most of the cards in this card game are letter cards, with which a word is formed; the rest are special action cards.
