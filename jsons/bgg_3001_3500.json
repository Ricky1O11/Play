Each player on their turn draws, rolls their dice, and places one of them in the dice tray. Any dice added to the tray must match by colour, number or letters. The first player to get rid of her dice is the winner.<br/><br/>Game 2<br/><br/>Game 2 is a variant of Yacht where the object is to have the highest points score after 11 rounds of play. The player draws five dice out of the bag and rolls all of them. The player may then take up to two more rolls with their choice of one or more of these five dice. Simply put aside the dice you do not want to roll, and roll the rest. Any of these dice may be rolled in any of your three rolls, except that all five must be rolled on the first roll. At the end of your turn, you must score your exposed dice faces in one of the eleven spaces in your column of the scoring sheet. If you cannot or do not wish to enter a score in any of the eleven spaces, then you must score a zero in your choice of one of the eleven spaces.<br/><br/>Game 3<br/><br/>All 24 spaces in the dice tray are used for Game 3. A player draws one die out of the bag, rolls it, and places it face up in any one of the 24 dice spaces in the tray. After the starting die is placed in the tray, the player to the left of the starting player draws four dice out of the bag and rolls them. The player looks at the dice to see if any of these can match the die already in the tray. The dice can match by either number, color or letter in any combination. If a match can be made, the player places the die in the tray and scores points. Dice are scored by making strings of two or more adjacent dice, all of the same color or kind. All numbered faces (0 through 9) score as their numerical value. The R, S and D2 each score as 20 points. The W and WD4 are not scored.<br/><br/>After a player finishes their turn, the next player takes a turn using the same dice. Thus a player will usually begin her turn with one less die than the previous player. In this way, the first player will have four dice to roll, the second three, the third will have two, and so on. When a player, down to only one die, is able to play it, then the next player starts the pattern over again by drawing four fresh dice from the bag, rolls them and play proceeds from there.<br/><br/>The game ends when the dice tray is full.

The fielding player sets the field, the board showing concentric circles around the wicket divided into segments, selects Pace or Spin for the over and spins the delivery, eg. Good Length, Long Hop, Bouncer/Googly. Upon seeing the field and the delivery, the batting player declares a stroke, eg Cut, Cover Drive, Pull, Hook, Leg Glance. There are 12 strokes and an avoiding action if a bouncer is bowled. A card is drawn and the result determined. Initially, the delivery may defeat the batsman, so if a Cut was played, the card might read Bowled if Yorker, whereas a Straight Drive gets an LBW if Good Length. If the bowler wasn't out, the next column shows the segment the ball was struck to. If there is no fielder there, the runs are scored from the card, 0 to 4 with a very rare 6. But if there is a fielder present no runs are scored, and if the card is also marked catch, a catch is possible.

If you pass GO, get 200 laughs.<br/>     Double 4s: You are out of control like the TASMANIAN DEVIL: Remove a TV set (aka house) from the board.<br/>     Double 5s: You are smart like BUGS BUNNY: Build a TV set for free.<br/>     Double 6s: You are fast like the ROAD RUNNER: Next turn roll the dice twice and use either result.<br/><br/>"}, "3021": {"boardgamedesigner": ["(Uncredited)"], "poll": [], "name": "Origins", "playingtime": "30", "minplayers": "2", "yearpublished": "1995", "usersrated": "69", "maxplayers": "6", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic27212_t.jpg", "average": "4.87971", "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["Great American Puzzle Factory", "Top Drawer Publishing, Inc."], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic27212.jpg", "boardgameversion": ["Great American Puzzle Factory Edition 1995", "Top Drawer Edition"], "maxplaytime": "30", "boardgamecategory": ["Trivia"], "age": "12", "minplaytime": "30", "description": "Basic question-and-answer trivia game about the origins of customs, cliches, inventions, words and superstitions.<br/><br/>Though named the same and on the same subject matter, it is unclear if this is the same game as Origins, as the games appear to have different question and game-board styles.<br/><br/>"}, "3022": {"boardgamedesigner": ["Ed Buffman", "Hy Conrad", "Isabel Garrett", "Phil Orbanes Sr."], "poll": [], "name": "Clue VCR Mystery Game", "playingtime": "60", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": ["Memory", "Role Playing"], "yearpublished": "1985", "usersrated": "246", "boardgamefamily": ["Cluedo", "VCR Board Games"], "maxplayers": "10", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic139848_t.jpg", "average": "5.75447", "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["Parker Brothers", "Waddington's Games, Inc."], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic139848.jpg", "boardgameversion": ["First Edition", "Parker French Edition", "Parker German Edition", "Waddingtons British Edition"], "maxplaytime": "60", "boardgamecategory": ["Deduction", "Electronic", "Murder/Mystery"], "age": "13", "minplaytime": "60", "description": "The classic whodunit brought to life.

There was no room for retreat - any reverse would mean utter catastrophe. Bonaparte rode five horses to death, covering 122 kilometers in 42 hours; but the French commander regained the initiative. He routed the Austrians at Lonato, while Wurmser approached Castiglione, a mere five miles away.<br/><br/>Though he succeeded in turning about and driving Wurmser back into the hills, the contest for Italy was far from over; the Austrian Army would return to hurl themselves against the understrength French forces covering the quadrilateral of fortresses - Verona, Legnano, Peschiera, and the ultimate prize - Mantova.<br/><br/>Rules: Napoleon at Bay System (48 pages incl. notes)<br/>Quick Set-up Tables: six 8.5&quot; x 11&quot; Sheets &amp; Displays<br/>Scenarios: Four (July, September, November 1796 and January 1797<br/>Map: One 22 x 34&quot; section by Joe Youst<br/>Counters: 280 (300 including blanks) two-sided pieces by Youst and Yamazaki<br/>Game Design: Kevin Zucker<br/> If you have played Napoleon at Bay, 1807: The Eagles Turn East, or The Emperor Returns, you already know the rules to Bonaparte in Italy.

Each player manages a team of 11 players (10 players and a goalkeeper) on a rectangular board with the lines of a football pitch printed on it and overlaid with a grid.<br/><br/>In a regular game, the two players set up their teams (of 10 players and a goalkeeper) in their halves.  One side is nominated the home team (the other, the away team) and starts off the game.  The game is played in turns.  During each turn, the team in possession of the ball passes or kicks the ball, and moves 3 players.  The opposing team then moves 3 of its players to interfere with the other's play.  Different playing positions of the team (e.g. striker, dribblers, etc) move differently.<br/><br/>The aim of the team in possession of the ball is to put the ball into the net of the opposing team (thus scoring a goal), and its opponent aims to stop it from doing so by blocking the paths towards goal and tackling opposing players to gain possession of the ball.  Whether a ball is kicked accurately to its target location or how much it deviated off-course is determined by the roll of a die.  The results of tackles are determined by comparing dice rolls.<br/><br/>The game lasts until a pre-determined time elapses (in which case the team who has scored the most goals wins) or a team has scored a pre-determined number of goals (and wins).  The game includes rules for variants such as Hocus Pocus cards that allow players to change the events of play, customization of each individual player (introducing ability points and skills), and league play.<br/><br/>"}, "3059": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic453889.jpg", "poll": [], "boardgamedesigner": ["(Uncredited)"], "statistics": [], "yearpublished": "1971", "maxplayers": "4", "boardgameartist": ["Edison Girard"], "boardgamepublisher": ["Ideal", "Mattel", "Old School Sports", "Tyco"], "maxplaytime": "10", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic453889_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "10", "boardgamecategory": ["Action / Dexterity", "Sports"], "description": "In Rebound,  each player or team controls four pucks, red or blue.

Because of the nature of 16th century Japanese warfare, it is also the easiest game in the series to play.

Also included are individual samurai used to challenge opponents and collect the important severed heads. Ignore the challenge and lose face, or even be forced to commit seppuku on the spot.<br/><br/>Battles include the most unusual Okehazama, complete with burning castles, thunderstorms, and a historically victorious army out-numbered six to one; Anegawa; Kawanakajima; Mikata-ga-Hara; Nagashino, with the famous Takeda cavalry corps charging Oda's volley-firing musketeers; and the most famous battle to take place in Japan, Sekigahara.

Basically, you try to score points by getting either a complete hand of one color (but no doubles), or several cards of the same type. Furthermore, there are wild cards like the Priest, the Emperor, the Heir and of course the Shogun which all have special values in certain combinations. Several other cards like a joker (the &quot;Buddha&quot;) or an elimination card (the &quot;Ninja&quot;) are also part of the deck. Unlike many other card games, you don't hold the cards in your hand; four of your five cards are displayed face up in front of you, while the fifth lies face down to be kept secret till the end of the turn. This makes bluffing as important a factor as luck and strategy in this game.<br/><br/>But that's not all. Right before the end (and before revealing their face-down card), players can choose a final strategy, represented by small strategy markers. &quot;Passive&quot; means you get the points your hand is worth (if any), while &quot;Power Play&quot; can double your score (or even turn a zero point hand into 20 points), but only if either you're the only one to play &quot;Power Play&quot;, or if you're the player with the highest score this round.

Also, the deck is only reshuffled when all the cards have been used up, which may take a few rounds and will make sure that certain powerful cards only show up ever so often, and not always in the right order to be played.<br/><br/>Another noteworthy part of this game is it's unique atmosphere. The rules successfully impose a courteous oriental gameplay where cards aren't simply dealt, but offered, and where Favors can be used to influence a hand. At the same time, there's always the shadow of the Ninja looming over the table, and even though it rarely strikes, it can re-arrange the whole score sheet.<br/><br/>The game ends when a player has reached 500 points (or 1,000 points for &quot;epic games&quot;).

The aim of the game is to amass victory points by shipping goods to Europe or by constructing buildings.<br/><br/>Each player uses a separate small board with spaces for city buildings, plantations, and resources. Shared between the players are three ships, a trading house, and a supply of resources and doubloons.<br/><br/>The resource cycle of the game is that players grow crops which they exchange for points or doubloons. Doubloons can then be used to buy buildings, which allow players to produce more crops or give them other abilities. Buildings and plantations do not work unless they are manned by colonists.<br/><br/>During each round, players take turns selecting a role card from those on the table (such as &quot;Trader&quot; or &quot;Builder&quot;). When a role is chosen, every player gets to take the action appropriate to that role. The player that selected the role also receives a small privilege for doing so - for example, choosing the &quot;Builder&quot; role allows all players to construct a building, but the player who chose the role may do so at a discount on that turn. Unused roles gain a doubloon bonus at the end of each turn, so the next player who chooses that role gets to keep any doubloon bonus associated with it. This encourages players to make use of all the roles throughout a typical course of a game.<br/><br/>Puerto Rico uses a variable phase order mechanic, where a &quot;governor&quot; token is passed clockwise to the next player at the conclusion of a turn. The player with the token begins the round by choosing a role and taking the first action.<br/><br/>Players earn victory points for owning buildings, for shipping goods, and for manned &quot;large buildings.&quot; Each player's accumulated shipping chips are kept face down and come in denominations of one or five. This prevents other players from being able to determine the exact score of another player. Goods and doubloons are placed in clear view of other players and the totals of each can always be requested by a player. As the game enters its later stages, the unknown quantity of shipping tokens and its denominations require players to consider their options before choosing a role that can end the game.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": ["Brazilian Portuguese first edition", "Chinese edition", "Chinese/English first edition", "Czech edition", "Dutch edition 2003", "English first edition 2002", "English second edition 2003", "Finnish/Swedish edition 2006", "Finnish/Swedish second edition 2011", "French edition 2009", "French first edition 2004", "German first edition 2002", "German second edition with Bestes Strategiespiel cover", "Greek edition", "Italian first edition", "Italian second edition", "Korean edition", "Polish first edition", "Polish second edition", "Spanish edition 2008", "Spanish second edition 2012"], "average": "8.08957", "name": "Puerto Rico", "videogamebg": ["Puerto Rico (Text Game)", "Puerto Rico HD"], "playingtime": "150", "boardgamemechanic": ["Variable Phase Order"], "age": "12", "boardgameexpansion": ["69178", "12382", "159761", "40688"], "usersrated": "48152", "boardgamesubdomain": ["Strategy Games"], "boardgamefamily": ["Alea Big Box", "Colonial Theme", "Country: Puerto Rico", "Puerto Rico", "Tableau Building"], "boardgamepodcastepisode": ["#24: The HYPE Episode!

The game's premise is simple - be the first to rid yourself of all your cards and ascend to supreme power. But beware - a strategic misstep may find you in a struggle to survive.<br/><br/>History<br/>The term, Gang of Four, was first used to describe four powerful radicals in Communist China that rose to power during the Cultural Revolution (1966-1976) and dominated Chinese politics during the early 1970s. Led by Jiang Qing, a former actress and the power-hungry wife of Chairman Mao, the Gang of Four dominated political, economic and cultural life in China for years. One month after Mao's death, they were arrested and jailed, thus ending China's slide into radicalism.<br/><br/>The Gang of Four card game was first conceived during the upheaval of the Cultural Revolution. The game's inventor, Lee Yih, wanted to convey the mystery, intrigue and intense struggle for power that embodied not only China's recent political history - but also its past.<br/>Like the political Gang of Four, the game embodies a never-ending battle for supremacy - where the weak perish and the strong dominate. Good players, like good politicians, must show cunning, flexibility and ruthlessness.<br/><br/>What's in the box?<br/>Gang of Four features a special 64-card deck, illustrated using a traditional Chinese theme, plus 2 rules summary cards to make learning and playing the game easier, a full-color rules booklet, scorepad and a Days of Wonder Web-Card, providing you with access to Gang of Four Online at <a target='_blank' href='http://www.gangoffour.com' rel='nofollow'>www.gangoffour.com</a><br/><br/>Gameplay<br/>All the cards are dealt to the players. The player who was dealt the multi-colored &quot;1&quot; card starts the hand and must use this card on the first play.  The players proceed taking turns clockwise and then counterclockwise on subsequent hands. On one's turn one must play the same number of cards but a higher ranked set than the previous player. A player may play  more cards if those cards are four or more of a kind. A round continues until all players pass because they can not or choose not to play cards. All cards played are discarded and the winner of the previous round leads. The hand continues until one player has used all the cards in his or her hand. The other players are penalized points on an escalating scale according to the number of cards in their hands. The game is over when one player has scored one hundred and the player with the lowest score wins.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "3", "boardgameversion": ["Dargaud French first edition", "Dargaud French second edition", "Dargaud French third edition", "Days of Wonder English first edition", "Days of Wonder English reinforcement pack edition", "Days of Wonder French first edition", "Days of Wonder Multilingual first edition", "The Game Dealers English first edition", "The Game Dealers English second edition"], "average": "6.59957", "name": "Gang of Four", "playingtime": "40", "boardgamemechanic": ["Hand Management", "Set Collection", "Trick-taking"], "age": "8", "usersrated": "1888", "boardgamesubdomain": ["Family Games"], "boardgamefamily": ["Climbing Games", "Country: China", "Shedding Games"], "boardgamepodcastepisode": ["Rules #19: Gang of Four"]}, "3086": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic401239.jpg", "poll": [], "boardgamedesigner": ["Michael Gray"], "statistics": [], "yearpublished": "1992", "maxplayers": "4", "boardgamepublisher": ["MB Jeux", "MB Juegos", "MB Spellen", "MB Spiele", "Milton Bradley"], "maxplaytime": "35", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic401239_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "10", "boardgamecategory": ["Deduction", "Electronic", "Science Fiction", "Space Exploration"], "description": "You and the three other greatest heroes of planet earth must save the BattleSat1 space station from the evil Omega Virus.

Although it sold out, Roberts wasn't happy with it.  He then re-released it in 1964 with squares again, like the 1958 version.  However, the rules were significantly changed.<br/><br/>The 1958 version was basically a miniatures game on a map.  You used range cards (shown in the illustration) both to move your units and then to check their firing range.  Units could rotate on their centers before checking with a range card, which was placed along the front side of the rectangular pieces.  You got better odds hitting from a flank.  Artillery had double range the of infantry or cavalry (this was only optional as far as I know). There were at least 3 slightly different rule books for the '58, '59, &amp; '60 Ed., all were basically the '58 one.<br/><br/>The game also had optional rules for hidden movement.  You left the room while your opponent put his pieces on the board and moved them, recorded their new positions and removed them again!  If they came within sight of a unit (including an outpost unit), he had to tell you where they were seen, or leave them on the board if still in sight.  Line of sight rules for all this.<br/><br/>The 1964 version required you to keep your units aligned with the square grid rather than the free form miniatures style movement of the 1958 version.

The other colourful side shows creatures like penguins, spiders, octopii, cats, mice and more fantastic creatures like chimera, sphinx, dragon, and concepts like death, explosion, ruin, nature, puppet-theater, dice, maze, TV and free-public-radio! The Colour tiles have values, multipliers and different abilities, such as removing tiles, affecting distant tiles and so on. These are not obvious, so constantly refering to the rules will slow the game.<br/>Grey has a starting fund and must buy and place or move tiles to generate income. Colour must turn Grey tiles over to disrupt the boring real world and prevent Grey from finishing with a profit. The game can be made harder for Colour by giving Grey more starting money. A totally weird and original game, very nice production, with lovely tiles painted in a naive style. Rules in German, French and English.<br/><br/>"}, "3121": {"boardgamedesigner": ["(Uncredited)"], "poll": [], "name": "Succession", "playingtime": "45", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": ["Set Collection"], "yearpublished": "1976", "usersrated": "1", "maxplayers": "6", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1010101_t.jpg", "average": "3", "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["Waddington's Games, Inc."], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1010101.jpg", "boardgameversion": ["First Edition"], "maxplaytime": "45", "boardgamecategory": ["Card Game"], "age": "8", "minplaytime": "45", "description": "A game based on the kings and queens of England.

The more Clippers that land at an island, the more points a settlement there will be worth.<br/><br/>Players control creation of trade routes by six trading companies by laying down wooden sticks that advance the appropriate clipper. The different islands have point values, as well as a set amount of potential settlements and a number of ports that clippers can land at.

Duplicate landings by the same company do not increase the score. For every settlement you have on an island, you will score points.

Players play sets of animal cards trying to knock over each other's pyramids of buckets. Cards in hand can be used to attack and defend their colour buckets, taking out lower buckets causes cascades.<br/><br/>The deck is five colours (farm animals) numbered 1-8, with two 1s and two 8s. Players start with 12 cards.  The start player plays 1-3 cards of one colour, giving a total sum. This total attacks the player to their left, who either plays 1-3 cards of the same colour totalling higher to defend, or loses a bucket. If they do defend though, that total then attacks the player to their left and so on, round the table. If it gets back to the start player, then can add 1-3 more cards to their original play, increasing the total. At some point, a player cannot defend, and buckets go tumbling. If you match the total attacking you this reverses the direction of play, meaning the cards already played are being added to additional cards to create high totals.<br/><br/>Players look at their starting hand before building their pyramid o' buckets, so it pays to put your weak colours at the top.<br/><br/>If you play a cards or cards, you draw back only one card from the draw deck. If you forget, tough! The game ends when a pre-set number of players lose all their buckets, the number increases with the number playing. The player with the most remaining is the winner.<br/><br/>A game comes with enough buckets for 6 players, but you can play with multiple sets to allow larger groups to play. This works well as action down the far end of the table means you are safe, while the reversal mechanism means that there can be a build up of a lead to an unmatchable number before it breaks out of that end of the table.<br/><br/>Seemingly a game of luck, but noticable that the same players keep winning and with experience the winning margins keep getting reduced.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": ["German first edition, rectangular box without logos", "German second edition", "Kosmos rectangular edition with SdJ and Spiele Hits logos", "Rio Grande English Edition"], "name": "The Bucket King", "playingtime": "45", "boardgamemechanic": ["Hand Management", "Take That"], "age": "10", "usersrated": "1442", "boardgamesubdomain": ["Family Games"], "average": "6.34189"}, "3142": {"boardgamedesigner": ["(Uncredited)"], "poll": [], "name": "Willow", "playingtime": "20", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": ["Hand Management", "Roll / Spin and Move"], "yearpublished": "1988", "usersrated": "14", "boardgamesubdomain": ["Children's Games"], "maxplayers": "4", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic8034_t.jpg", "average": "5.67857", "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["Parker Brothers"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic8034.jpg", "boardgameversion": ["First edition"], "maxplaytime": "20", "boardgamecategory": ["Card Game", "Children's Game", "Deduction", "Fantasy", "Movies / TV / Radio theme"], "age": "10", "minplaytime": "20", "description": "Players move their pawns along the board drawing cards and taking them from other players.

The game is essentially a batting simulation of major league baseball, built around a spinner and player disks that are divided into sections in such a manner that a hitter has the probabilty of reproducing his real-life statistics in such important categories as home runs, triples, doubles, singles, walks, and strikeouts. In general, the game follows the basic rules of major league baseball.  Teams are created from the player disks supplied with the game (often a mix of current players and all-time greats such as Babe Ruth) and from player disks for other seasons published separately.  The team at bats places the appropriate player disk on the spinner, spins, and reads off the resulting number.  The game does not attempt to realistically simulate pitching and defense.  Thus a hitter's result from a time at bat is not affected by the opposing pitcher or the defensive prowess of the fielder to whom the ball may be hit, although the player in the field on some play outcomes is required to spin a second spinner to determine the advancement of base runners and other certain details.

The players represent the owners and jockeys of the horses in the race and the people betting on the race.<br/><br/>To start the game, each player is given a certain amount of cash. This money is used to bid on horses. Each horse is represented by an &quot;Ownership Card&quot; which shows the horse's name, stable and &quot;Speed&quot;. Speed is used to determine the likelihood of gaining an &quot;Advantage&quot; during the race. Bidding for each horse lasts three rounds and the high bidder gets the horse.<br/><br/>Once the horses have been assigned their starting positions are determined and the Ownership Cards are placed in the &quot;Readout Machine&quot;. This is a tray which holds the cards and will be used to determine movement. After all the horses are in the tray &quot;Odds Cards&quot; are placed below each Ownership Card. Odds Cards will determine the actual movement of each horse.<br/><br/>Players may now make wagers on any horse they choose. Wagers may be made on any number of horses and may be made for Win, Place or Show. The player records their bets on a &quot;Betting Slip&quot; and places it face down on the board, then pays the total amount of the bets.<br/><br/>To run the race the spinner is used to generate a random number. This number is used on the Readout Machine to determine the number of spaces moved and the &quot;Diagonal Allowance&quot; for each horse. Each Odds card has a column of numbers for total movement and a second column for Diagonal allowance. The Diagonal Allowance is the number of diagonal moves the horse may make and is therefore the number of times the horse can change lanes. The horse must use all of its movement but does not have to use all of its allowed lane changes.  The spinner's random number determines which row of numbers on the Odds cards will be used in the current round for moving the horses along the track.<br/><br/>Sometimes the spinner will indicate &quot;Advantage&quot;. When this happens an Advantage card is drawn. Advantage Cards each show the name of one horse and that horse is allowed a free move of 6 with a diagonal allowance of 2. Other horses may not move. The better a horse's speed, the more Advantage Cards that horse has in the deck.<br/><br/>The race continues until all of the horses have crossed the finish line. If more than one horse crosses the line in the same turn the horse which moves the furtherest past the finish line is the winner. The second and third place horse is determined the same way.<br/><br/>Once all the horses have crossed the finish line the betting slips are revealed and winning wagers are paid. The players then set up the horses and the Readout Machine for the next race. Ownership of the horses remains the same but the starting order and Odds Cards change.<br/><br/>A total of six races are run. The player with the most cash at the end of all six races is the winner.<br/><br/>This is a very good game. Players can spend a good deal of money buying the best horses at the start of the game, but they then have less cash to place bets with. Meanwhile, other players can bet on their horses anyway. Also, the randomness of the appearance of the Advantage Cards mean that a good horse can have a bad showing and the slowest horse may come from behind to win. There is nothing to prevent a player from betting on another horse and racing theirs badly to influence the outcome but the other players may be doing the same thing and the fact that six races are run means that no one is likely to try it more than once (though it may show up as a race 6 strategy). A very interesting game.<br/><br/>"}, "3159": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic204715.jpg", "poll": [], "boardgamedesigner": ["Franz-Benno Delonge"], "statistics": [], "yearpublished": "2002", "maxplayers": "4", "boardgameartist": ["Atelier Wilinski"], "boardgamepublisher": ["Ravensburger Spieleverlag GmbH"], "maxplaytime": "45", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic204715_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "30", "boardgamecategory": ["Card Game", "City Building"], "boardgamehonor": ["2002 Japan Boardgame Prize Best Foreign Game for Beginners Nominee"], "description": "From the Rules:<br/><br/>&quot;Our city should be more beautiful!&quot;  The mayor has decided to engage a big construction plan to bring the somewhat decrepit city back to the forefront.

Apparently they were common on the Continent and are still used in places where lift doors would be unsafe, such as nuclear power stations. Anyway, this game has 9 thick cards showing various odd looking passengers going up or down in the lift, with some only partially shown. Each player has a deck of cards showing the same people, in different poses. The cabin cards are shuffled and laid out face-down in two columns of 5, with a gap and a pawn is placed next to the gap. First player to grab the die rolls it and moves the pawn clockwise to face a cabin. Players call out which person they think is in the cabin and the cabin card is turned up. If you're correct, you dump the matching card from your hand; if not, you keep it. But the cabin card is replaced face-down in the original empty space, not where it was previously. In this way, the cabin cards will be moved around as you play, and you'll have to use your memory to clear your hand to win.<br/>There are also tempo chips you can draw for correctly guessing a card you've already dumped. You can use the chips to move the pawn fore or back from the numbered rolled (so it goes to a cabin you remember and want to dump). But get it wrong and you pick the card back to your hand.<br/>A surprisingly hard memory game but still lots of fun. Published as Comings &amp; Goings in the UK and Vanished in the US, it is now in print as Think: Paternoster by Ravensburger, with the player's cards being simply objects held by the people, like a Handy (that's German for mobile phone).<br/><br/>"}, "3183": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic9452.jpg", "boardgameimplementation": ["Car Wars Compendium"], "poll": [], "boardgamedesigner": ["Chad Irby", "Steve Jackson (I)"], "statistics": [], "yearpublished": "2002", "maxplayers": "2", "boardgamepublisher": ["Steve Jackson Games"], "maxplaytime": "60", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic9452_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "60", "boardgamecategory": ["Dice", "Racing", "Transportation"], "description": "The 5th Edition release of Car Wars.

If you enjoy the game you can invest more money in it by purchasing the different 15mm regiment packs.  The game supports several races typical of the fantasy genre (elves, dwarves, orcs, dark elves) and adds a few unique ones as well (Thain[Norse], Isthak [chaos-like]).  The regiments generally consist of 8 to 10 counters.<br/><br/>Gameplay:  Players are free to set their objectives for each battle, though some simple scenarios are provided to get you started.  Players spend points to add regiments for their armies.  Armies are set up on the edge of the mapboard and maneuvered to contact.  Orders are selected for each unit for each turn indicating whether it will skirmish (move and fire), attack (move to contact), move (move long distance), or hold (defend and fire at incoming attackers if missile equipped).  Use of ordered formations help a unit fight and move.  Combat bonuses are given to units who are able to hit their target in the flank or rear, use terrain to advantage, and use weapons that confer advantage in special cases (ie lance from a charging knight).  Morale rules determine whether a unit is going to hold their position, rout, or in some cases become 'impetuous' and aggressively continue an attack without orders to do so.<br/><br/>As a player you assume the role of General of an army.   <br/>The game begins by recruiting an army. Each army is made up of several units. A unit is a group of soldiers who fight together in an organized fashion. Most units have 40 foot troops or 20 mounted models on ten individual hex bases. Sometimes a unit might be a single large creature like a dragon or war machine such as a catapult. Every unit has a points value and when you create an Army, both players will have an agreed upon amount of points to spend to create their army. This is most often 1200 points, the amount used for tournament play. For your army you may also want to recruit special heroes, commanders or wizards. Every unit in the Demonworld game has its own recruiting card which is included in the army book. These handy little cards make recruiting an army easy because they include all the information about a unit including its points cost.<br/><br/>Once both players have spent all their points and created their army, it is time to create the battlefield. Demonworld is played on a large flat surface like a table. This could be a kitchen, dining room, or work table or even the floor. The Demonworld game is great because the battlefield consists of four or more of the Demonworld maps. You can also augment the maps with model trees, buildings or hills. This is not really necessary however, because the maps look great. Using the maps makes setting up a game really fast. Four of these maps are provided with the basic game. If you would like more variety several additional map sets are available.<br/><br/>Once the maps are laid out each player will deploy their units on the battlefield. Where you place your units is crucial to the success of your army. Try to take advantage of the terrain. This could mean creating an ambush by hiding a unit in the woods. Or putting a unit on a hill where your opponent will have to fight uphill to attack them. If you can, also try to imagine what your opponent will do and then you may be able to set a trap for them or otherwise create a plan to defeat them.<br/><br/>Once both armies are deployed (put on the table) play begins. Demonworld uses a simultaneous turn sequence. In each turn both players will have an opportunity to move all of their units and shoot missile weapons like bows, engage in hand to hand combat, or cast spells. The rules on how to perform these actions are in the Demonworld rule book. The army books have extra rules for special units which only that army may recruit and special spells which only that army can cast. As the turns progress each player will try to move their units to a position of advantage and eliminate the opponents units. Sometimes people play a game with a specific set of objectives. These games are called scenarios. In scenarios achieving your objectives is often more important than destroying your opponents army or preventing your own losses. Once one side has achieved its objectives or destroyed the opposing army, they are the winner and the game is over. Most games take about three hours. Experienced players play much faster than novices and can handle larger armies.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>"}, "3220": {"boardgamedesigner": ["Andrej Wiatkin"], "poll": [], "name": "Lost World", "playingtime": "45", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": ["Storytelling"], "yearpublished": "1994", "usersrated": "4", "boardgamefamily": ["Admin: Better Description Needed!", "Animals: Dinosaurs"], "maxplayers": "4", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic8302_t.jpg", "average": "5.25", "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["(Unknown)", "Centre of Prospective Projects", "Polina"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic8302.jpg", "boardgameversion": ["First edition"], "maxplaytime": "45", "boardgamecategory": ["Novel-based", "Prehistoric"], "age": "10", "minplaytime": "45", "description": "Based on Sir Arthur Conan Doyle&rsquo;s novel.<br/><br/>"}, "3221": {"boardgamedesigner": ["Andrej Wiatkin"], "poll": [], "name": "Nieznaika on the Moon", "playingtime": "60", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": ["Storytelling"], "yearpublished": "1994", "usersrated": "0", "boardgamefamily": ["Admin: Better Description Needed!", "Moon/Lunar"], "maxplayers": "8", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic8294_t.jpg", "average": "0", "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["(Unknown)", "Centre of Prospective Projects", "Polina"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic8294.jpg", "boardgameversion": ["First edition"], "maxplaytime": "60", "boardgamecategory": ["Economic"], "age": "8", "minplaytime": "60", "description": "Based on the novel by Nikolai Nosov and on cartoon TV-series.<br/><br/>"}, "3222": {"boardgamedesigner": ["Andrej Wiatkin"], "poll": [], "name": "Wizard of Oz's Emerald Town", "playingtime": "45", "minplayers": "1", "boardgamemechanic": ["Co-operative Play"], "yearpublished": "1998", "usersrated": "1", "boardgamefamily": ["Admin: Better Description Needed!", "Wizard of Oz"], "maxplayers": "4", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic8316_t.jpg", "average": "6", "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["Centre of Prospective Projects", "Polina"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic8316.jpg", "boardgameversion": ["First edition"], "maxplaytime": "45", "boardgamecategory": ["Fantasy", "Novel-based"], "age": "10", "minplaytime": "45", "description": "Based on the novels by Frank Baum and Alexander Volkov<br/><br/>"}, "3223": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic302712.jpg", "poll": [], "boardgamedesigner": ["Jacques Thiriat", "Nadine Thiriat"], "statistics": [], "yearpublished": "1986", "maxplayers": "6", "boardgamepublisher": ["Descartes Editeur", "Sleuth Publications"], "maxplaytime": "180", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic302712_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "180", "boardgamecategory": ["Deduction", "Expansion for Base-game", "Murder/Mystery", "Novel-based"], "description": "&quot;As the events unfold, day by day, can you clear Anny Forster of the charges against her?

And when the Chieftain lands on the corners of the track, he looks down on the Pueblo from above, and all visible player's blocks gain them more points. Now, on each subsequent pair of turns, you have a choice of a colored block and a neutral block.

The ensuing battle began their summer offensive that would take them across the Ukraine to the Dnieper River.<br/>During August the two sides were equally matched and a tremendous war of attrition raged from Kharkov to the Sea of Azov with neither side willing to give ground. In September, bled white by the never-ending Soviet attacks, the German army retreated in haste to the safety of the Dnieper River. In October, the battle raged along the length of the Dnieper and for the Perekop Peninsula, the only land exit to the German 17th Army in the Crimea. During this three month period German reinforcements poured in from every sector, but it was never enough.

The Battle of the Bulge is a card game for 2-4 players recreating the famous WWII battle in which the German Army mounted a surprise attack on the thin U.S. forces deployed in the Ardennes region, hoping to break through to the English Channel and split the Allied Forces.  Each player controls either the German or the U.S. and British forces.  Players draw cards in each daily turn from their own decks, then play the cards as they see fit.  Many cards can be played during the opponent's turn so there is constant interaction.  Each deck is complete; there are no cards to collect or trade.  NUTS! comes in two 150-card sets (North and South).  Each set is complete and can be played on its own, or the two sets can be played together.  (From the back of the box by Decision Games)<br/><br/>The cards have actual photographs of units, events, cities, and equipment from the battle.  Cards comprise of units (infantry, artillery, mechanized), events like bad weather or supply drops, and terrain to include cities, major forest, rivers, and ridges.  Units are rated in strength values for infantry, armor, artillery, and cohesion.  The objectives are for the Germans to get three panzer units (six if playing both decks) from their start side off the Allied side of the board.  The Allies must prevent this and stall the offensive until adequate reinforcement arrival.  Although this is a card game, it plays very much like a board game.  Battles are resolved via dice rolling.  The rules do include important factors such as supply, town encirclement, weather, blitzes, cohesion checks, and the like.  Overall, an easy to medium game to grasp the rules and play.

As the game progresses, competition for the explorers' services increases as each explorer has fewer expeditions available for investment. In the end, only one ship for each explorer makes the final trip and only one king earns those rewards.<br/><br/>Firstly, the board is set up from two double-sided boards, giving four possible configurations with slightly different versions of each explorer. Each player has six ships and money cards numbered 1 to 9. There are three turns. In the first, each explorer has 3 ships, but only two of these will proceed to the second turn and only one will win through to the third.<br/><br/>A set of cards with explorers is used for each turn - 3 of each explorer in turn one, 2 of each in turn two and 1 of each in the last turn. The top card is revealed and an auction held, going round the table until all but one player has passed. The winning bidder puts the card in front of them and places one of their ships on to the relevant explorer area on the board. This process is repeated until all the cards have been bid on.<br/><br/>Each explorer has a different power, some giving victory points, others money or a special ability like being able to delay a subsequent auction, or a combination of these. At the end of a turn players gain two new money cards, plus any which explorers they have a ship on give them. The second turn work in the same way, but only players with a ship invested in an explorer can bid on it, and because there are only two ships of the three on each explorer moving to the second area, one will be left behind. Similarly, the third round sees just one ship of the remaining two move to the third and final area for each explorer. Scoring is then done, with more points available for players with ships reaching the third area.<br/><br/>Money is always tight so it is a good idea to try and get some extra income, though this conflicts with the need to score points. Two of the explorers score a lot of points but have no income so each player must balance the two needs. Money cards are worth points as well, so there is also a trade off between using these to win auctions to advance your ships and keeping them to score with.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "3", "boardgameversion": ["Dutch first edition", "English first edition", "German first edition", "Greek first edition"], "average": "6.56205", "name": "Pizarro & Co.", "playingtime": "45", "boardgamemechanic": ["Auction/Bidding"], "age": "12", "usersrated": "1274", "boardgamesubdomain": ["Strategy Games"], "boardgamefamily": ["Country: Portugal"], "boardgamepodcastepisode": ["The Long View: Tom Lehman Interview", "The Spiel #23 - Tony Danza &amp; Co."]}, "3268": {"boardgamedesigner": ["Phillippe Aucagos"], "poll": [], "name": "Bunker Poker", "playingtime": "20", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": ["Dice Rolling", "Secret Unit Deployment"], "yearpublished": "1999", "usersrated": "34", "maxplayers": "4", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic310902_t.jpg", "average": "4.92353", "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["Gigamic"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic310902.jpg", "boardgameversion": ["First Edition", "Gigamic multilingual edition"], "maxplaytime": "20", "boardgamecategory": ["Dice"], "age": "9", "minplaytime": "20", "description": "Very simple luck driven game.

Each player is a (model) cat that lives in its own house. To win the game a cat must fill its larder with six items of food. There is milk at the Dairy, vitamins at the Vet, fish from the Fishmonger and a tin of cat food from the corner shop. There are also (model) birds and mice, which the cats have to catch. Of course, each cat begins the game with nine lives; any cat that loses all of its nine lives is out of the game. Players are dealt a hand of Mog cards; these and a die provide the means to move the cats, birds and mice. The players can choose to move their cats along garden walls or paths or, the more adventurous can travel round the road, this route is a lot quicker but there is a car. Cats can raid other cats larders and attack one another. A pack of Curiosity cards dictate, at random, when the shops open and close and movements of the (model) car.

But victory did not come cheap. <br/>After showing the British the color of their mettle at Bunker Hill, Washington's little army was plagued by one defeat after another, shunting from one battlefield to the next; always beaten but never destroyed. No power of the period believed that the upstart colonials and their unborn nation had the slightest chance of emerging victorious against the strongest military machine of the era after the dismal summer of 1776. But then came the cruelest winter of the decade when even nature seemed to join forces with the British against the tattered American troops. Undaunted, Washington led his small force in the historic crossing of the Delaware to twice surprise and rout British forces at Trenton and Princeton. Their resolve thus strengthened, the ill-clad Americans retired to Valley Forge to face winter beset by the hunger and deprivation that cost the lives of 2500 patriots. But the coming spring found Clinton facing a revitalized and strengthened rebel army which proceeded to chase him across New Jersey in the Monmouth Campaign.

It is a realistic simulation of the strategic situation faced by British and American alike in that fiery decade when the United States won its independence. <br/>Actually, 1776 is six games in one: a Basic Game that gets you quickly and easily into the routine of simulation gaming; an Advanced Game with scenarios that provides additional complexity and realism; and a Campaign Simulation Game that encompasses the entire war and balances successes in one region against failures in another - truly the ultimate in a simulation gaming experience! <br/>And if you don't have the time for a complete Campaign Game, there are four scenarios to choose from; each of which poses a challenge for everyone; from the most erudite of military historians to the fellow who just managed to pass American History:<br/><br/>Scenario 1: The Invasion of Canada - 1775 to 1776 - Can YOU do better than the bumbling General Schuyler and Benedict Arnold in the vain American atttempt to make Canada a 14th colony?<br/><br/>Scenario 2: The Saratoga Campaign - 1777 - Can YOU as General Horatio Gates surround and destroy the forces of the British General Burgoyne in this reinactment of the turning point of the Revolution?<br/><br/>Scenario 3: Greene's Southern Campaignv - 1780 to 1781 - Can YOU as General Nathaniel Greene lead Cornwallis' tested regulars on a merry chase with your force of rag-tag militia and Guerilla bands without being crushed in a major engagement?<br/><br/>Scenario 4: The Yorktown Campaign - 1781 - Can you duplicate Washington's encirclement and crushing defeat of Cornwallis in the battle that won the Revolution?<br/><br/>Contents: <br/><br/>     a 16&quot; x 44&quot; four-section, full color mapboard depicting colonial America from Quebec to Georgia; <br/>     two sets of die-cut troop counters representing over 400 units of Continentals, British Regulars, Rebel and Tory Militia, French Regulars, Indians, and naval units of the British and French fleets; <br/>     1 die; <br/>     1 Terrain Effects Chart; <br/>     2 sets (8 per set) of Tactical Combat Cards used in the innovative, new Sustained Combat system; 1 set of scenario, CRT, and play chart cards organized on an index-card format that puts a summary of all levels of the game at your fingertips; <br/>     a 32-page Rules &amp; Designers' Notes Manual telling you how to play all 6 game versions plus the inside story on research and development and why the game was designed the way it was.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Rated &quot;Tournament Level&quot; on Avalon Hill's Simulation-complexity scale.<br/><br/>Note: 1st edition has 416 counters (this includes some blanks)<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": ["Avalon Hill Bicentennial edition", "Avalon Hill First Edition", "Avalon Hill Second Edition"], "name": "1776", "playingtime": "120", "boardgamemechanic": ["Dice Rolling", "Hex-and-Counter"], "average": "6.43148", "usersrated": "812", "boardgamesubdomain": ["Wargames"], "age": "12"}, "3313": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic272331.jpg", "poll": [], "boardgamedesigner": ["Michael Kuby", "John Miller"], "statistics": [], "yearpublished": "1987", "maxplayers": "4", "age": "7", "boardgamepublisher": ["Alga", "Brio AB", "Damm / Egmont", "Educational Insights", "Glacier", "Mitra"], "maxplaytime": "30", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic272331_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "30", "boardgamecategory": ["Abstract Strategy"], "boardgamehonor": ["1992 Mensa Select Winner"], "description": "Traverse is played on a square &quot;checker&quot; game board with a 12 1/2&quot; x 12 1/2&quot; grid.

Players can jump over their own or another player's piece. Jumped pieces are NOT captured, akin to Chinese Checkers. Players can string together a series of jumps if each individual jump in the series conforms to the rules governing single jumps.

The game consists of five sets of octahedral stiff paper dice, about 2&quot; per edge, with five team members per set.  These dice have full-color comic-book style artwork by Eduardo Muller and game information printed on each face, and each die represents a character. Each die is pre-cut and scored, and assembles easily with just tabs and slots.  Despite being made from &quot;mere paper,&quot; the dice are surprisingly sturdy, and the use of a good quality card stock means they tend to stay in good condition. Unless you accidentally sit on one, of course.<br/><br/>The basic goal is to be the first person to reach 50 points, which are earned by &quot;killing&quot; your opponent's characters.  Each turn, you may throw a new character into the arena (if you have any available to throw), have one of your characters use his or her action or power, or have one of your characters move.  Movement is done by rotating a die onto a new face on the table.  If you throw a new character into play, he or she may immediately use his or her power on the side that lands face up. Available powers may be an attack or a special action. Some of the special actions allow you to, in turn, use the powers of other teammates, triggering a cascading reaction across the table.<br/><br/>Attacking is simple: Each attack has a power rating.  If it exceeds the block rating of the defending dice, the defending dice is killed, and the attacker scores its points (printed on side one of each die).  If it is equal or less than the defense value, the defending die is merely moved so that a lower value face is face-up, unless it's been &quot;wounded&quot; so many times that it's already on its lowest face, in which case, it dies.<br/><br/>A basic game of Diceland lasts about 20 minutes.<br/><br/>List of Diceland sets and armies<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": ["First edition"], "average": "6.48206", "name": "Diceland: Deep White Sea", "playingtime": "20", "boardgamemechanic": ["Dice Rolling", "Variable Player Powers"], "age": "10", "boardgameexpansion": ["67969", "19626"], "usersrated": "269", "boardgamesubdomain": ["Thematic Games"], "boardgamefamily": ["Diceland Series"]}, "3340": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic235374.jpg", "poll": [], "boardgamedesigner": ["Darrell Hayhurst", "Neal Sofge"], "statistics": [], "yearpublished": "2000", "maxplayers": "8", "boardgameartist": ["Darrell Hayhurst", "Angela Smith", "Neal Sofge"], "boardgamepublisher": ["Fat Messiah Games", "Sierra Madre Games"], "maxplaytime": "45", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic235374_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "45", "boardgamecategory": ["Fighting", "Science Fiction", "Wargame", "World War II"], "description": "Hard Vacuum is a sci-fi space combat game based in a fictional World War II. The players take on the roles of pilots from either the U.S. Space Corps or the German Raummacht in about a dozen well balanced scenarios spanning from around 1942 to 1945. The game requires you to supply the playing surface (the rules are designed for either a hex field or a completely free form field) and the dice (which ideally should read 0-5 instead of 1-6). The counters are supplied on a laminated piece of paper roughly the same quality as the cover of the book, you must cut them out.<br/><br/>Each turn begins with each player secretly marking down how much thrust they are applying to which thrusters on their ships. These are simultaneously revealed, and thrust markers are added/removed as needed. Because space is a vacuum, thrust applied in one direction will mean you go in that direction until you compensate for it!<br/><br/>The next part of the turn is the combat phase. Players must roll the dice to determine if they can still see their opponent. If they can see their enemy can they shoot. All the players fire their weapons simultaneously, and then they apply the results of hits and criticals at the same time. The turn is now complete.<br/><br/>There are significant technological differences between the American and German spacecraft. The German craft are generally more powerful, but have a limited supply of fuel and weapons, while the American craft are weaker, but their fuel and weapons supply automatically recharges each turn.<br/><br/>Hard Vacuum is aimed at any fan of classic sci-fi, dogfight, or space combat games. It has a lighter, almost comic book quality in its setting and the game does not get bogged down by complex rules or mechanics.

The more different lines arriving at a city, the higher the score will be for that city.  Later in the game 4 short lines  also become available.<br/><br/>An updated version of Alan R. Moon's White Wind game Santa Fe.<br/><br/><br/>Game Summary<br/>The deck is composed of city cards (with some short lines shuffled into the middle third). Players have a hand of 4 city cards to start the game. Each round, players simultaneously select a card to play, then reveal. City cards are added to your personal display -- essentially, you have a share in that city. There are also several special cards (2x, 3x, 4-in-one, Branch Line, Boomtown) that modify the basic game turn. These specials are on public display, and can be acquired at the end of each round (some cost $1; the 2x may be held, but the rest must be played immediately after acquiring them).<br/><br/>Then, in turn order, going twice around, players add a single track to any of the railheads (each of the 5 lines has specific starting locations on the board). If the link is to a previously unconnected city, collect $2. In addition, if the city is one of the goal cities of that train line, collect $4.<br/><br/>After all players have gone (twice), pass the start player marker to the left. THEN, in turn order, players bring their hand total back to 4 (draw from deck and/or from cards on display). If a Short Line card is revealed, discard the card and draw again; that Short Line is now in play. They choose a card to play, and repeat above.<br/><br/>The game ends when 3 (or is it all?) track lines are completely used up. Each city's value is equal to its base value, printed on board, multiplied by the number of different train lines connected to it. The player with the most cash and city value wins!<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": ["GMT first edition"], "average": "6.82265", "name": "Santa Fe Rails", "playingtime": "60", "boardgamemechanic": ["Card Drafting", "Route/Network Building", "Simultaneous Action Selection", "Stock Holding"], "age": "12", "usersrated": "805", "boardgamesubdomain": ["Strategy Games"], "boardgamefamily": ["Admin: Better Description Needed!", "Cities: Santa Fe (New Mexico, USA)", "Santa Fe System"]}, "3349": {"boardgamedesigner": ["Stefan Dorra"], "average": "5.90533", "poll": [], "name": "Die Safeknacker", "playingtime": "30", "minplayers": "3", "yearpublished": "1996", "usersrated": "30", "maxplayers": "5", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic294303_t.jpg", "boardgameartist": ["Gunter Grossholz"], "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["ASS Altenburger Spielkarten"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic294303.jpg", "boardgameversion": ["German First Edition"], "maxplaytime": "30", "boardgamecategory": ["Card Game"], "age": "10", "minplaytime": "30", "description": "In this card driven game, safe-crackers co-operate but must share the spoils.

Poland has long since vanished from the map. Denmark, Norway, and the Low Countries have been overrun. France, the victor of 1918, has fallen. Greece and Yugoslavia have now been crushed. Britain stands alone, freed from the threat of invasion by the courage and skill of its air force and navy. But Britain is stalked and assaulted by the Nazi wolfpacks, and in North Africa a mixed garrison of British and Commonwealth forces is besieged in Tobruk by Rommel and his Afrika Korps.<br/><br/>Then, on June 22, Hitler launches Operation Barbarossa, the invasion of Stalin's Soviet Union. As the panzer spearheads slice through the bewildered Russian defenders, it appears that nothing can halt the Nazi tide. But the course of History has just taken a major turn. The Last European War is over; World War II has begun. It will end four years later, in a bunker in the ruins of Berlin.<br/><br/>World War II: Barbarossa to Berlin covers those four years of epic struggle, from Moscow to Stalingrad, from Tobruk to Tunis, from Sicily to Rome, from D-Day to the Rhine, to the final battles for the Reich. Designed by Ted Raicer as a follow-up to his award-winning WWI strategic game, Paths of Glory, World War II: Barbarossa to Berlin modifies the Paths of Glory systems to capture the strategic and operational dynamics of WWII in Europe.<br/><br/>As in Paths of Glory, World War II: Barbarossa to Berlin uses a point to point map, this time covering all of Europe from France to the Urals, and from Norway to North Africa. Units are armies and corps (fronts and armies for the Soviets), and each turn represents three months. The movement and combat systems will be familiar to Paths of Glory players, but have been modified to recreate the blitzkrieg campaigns of 1941-45.<br/><br/>As in Paths of Glory, the heart of the game lies in the 110 Action Cards (55 each for the Axis and Allied players). Each card can be used for operational movement and combat, strategic movement, replacements, or for an Event. Events include:<br/><br/><br/>    Individual leaders (Patton, Guderian, or Rommel the Desert Fox) <br/>    Tactical innovations and new weapons (Fortified boxes, Tiger tanks) <br/>    Strategic Warfare (U-boats, Bomber Command, the 8th Airforce) <br/>    Reinforcements (Soviet Mechanized Fronts, PanzerArmee Afrika, Patton's Third Army) <br/>    Allied Invasions, actual or potential (Torch, Sledgehammer, Husky, Overlord) <br/>    Politics and Diplomacy (Hitler Declares War, Casablanca, Yalta, Operation Axis) <br/>    Irregular Warfare (Partisans, the Maquis, Otto Skorzeny)<br/><br/><br/>World War II: Barbarossa to Berlin presents both the Allied and Axis players with a wide range of exciting game choices, while illustrating the key historical factors of the war; from the importance of mechanized forces in combat to the importance of oil to fuel them, but without the complexity of other strategic WWII designs. And unlike many of those games, World War II: Barbarossa to Berlin lives up to its title: an Axis player who fails to win the war may still win the game. The winner is often decided on the last turn as the Allied player struggles to extinguish the last traces of the Nazi empire.<br/><br/>It is June 22, 1941: Will WWII end in German triumph in Barbarossa or collapse in Berlin?

It is the first in the GMT Musket &amp; Pike Battle System covering warfare in the 17th Century. The system emphasizes Command and Control and the unique style of combat in that era. Armies are divided into three of four wings. Each wing has an order that limits the types of actions that units of that wing may perform. Wings may change their order, but it is not an easy task to accomplish. Victory goes to the commander who can coordinate the actions of these wings in the heat of battle. Units are infantry brigades, cavalry regiments, and artillery batteries. Rules include Cavalry Charges, use of the Cavalry's pistols to skirmish or use in close combat, artillery grazing fire, Infantry techniques of fire including advancing, retreating, and salvo firing. Play is highly interactive, and a battle can be played through in one sitting.<br/><br/>The battles included in this game are:<br/><br/>Edgehill, 23 October 1642<br/>    Is the King beholden to Parliament or is he truly sovereign? King Charles and his army, their way to London barred by the army of Parliament, have drawn up to give battle. Edgehill was the first major battle of the war. Robert Devereax, Earl of Essex, commands the army of Parliament sent to prevent the King's army from reaching London. The fighting is indecisive as the bloodied Royalist foot fall back, but Essex conceded the field despite receiving reinforcements. A major victory for either side could have ended the war here.<br/><br/>First Newbury, 20 September 1643<br/>    Outmaneuvered, Essex, with the Royalists under King Charles between his army and London, is forced to fight. Essex spies a hill southwest of Newbury and in the early morning occupies it. Hedges line the area and help minimize the King's advantage in Cavalry.<br/><br/>Marston Moor, 2 July 1644<br/>    The largest battle of the war. It decided the fate of Northern England. An allied army of Scots under the Earl of Leven, the Northern Association under Ferdinando Fairfax, and the Eastern Association under the Earl of Manchester laid siege to the King's Northern Army under the Marquis of Newcastle at York, the key to the North. King Charles dispatched his nephew, the talented Prince Rupert, to effect a relief. The defeat was complete; the Royalist army was utterly destroyed and the North lost to Parliament. A new hero arises here: Cromwell, a name synonymous with the English Civil War and the key player in the later two civil wars.<br/><br/>Second Newbury, 27 October 1644<br/>    The disaster that precipitated the forming of the New Model Army. Three Parliamentary armies come together and catch the King by surprise just north of Newbury. The most unconventional of all the battles; the superior Parliamentary force attacks from either end, but is short on time. Various options on gaining more time by shortening the flank march give this action high replay value.<br/><br/>Naseby, 14 June 1645<br/>    The debut of the New Model Army and the battle that broke the back of the King's army. The New Model Army was created by combining the elements of the major armies in the field. While this worked well for the cavalry, there were serious problems in the infantry ranks. The King's army was outnumbered, but it retained its corps of veteran infantry. The final result was a decisive defeat for the King and the end of his military fortunes. Though fighting would last another year, the King would never field a potent army again.<br/><br/>COUNTERS: 635 full-color die-cut counters.<br/><br/>MAP: Two 22&quot;x34&quot; full-color back-printed mapsheets<br/><br/>OTHER: <br/><br/>    One 10-sided dice<br/>    16-page Rulebook<br/>    24-page Playbook<br/>    2 11x17 Player Aid cards<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>DESIGNER: Ben Hull<br/>DEVELOPER: Marty Arsndorf<br/>ART DIRECTOR: Rodger B.

Rooted soundly in Mark Herman's award-winning We The People system, The Napoleonic Wars provides refinements that allow two-to-five players to play an exciting game requiring two to ten hours. The majority of your games will easily end in a single evening, thanks to sudden death victory conditions providing variable game lengths that eliminate the &quot;end of the world&quot; phenomenon that plague many games. Often, you'll set 'em up and knock 'em down twice a night, and once in a great while your Campaign game will require two nights of play for the terrific panoramic history to unfold before your eyes.<br/><br/>Like similar card-driven games, The Napoleonic Wars provides strategy cards that are played as events or to activate leaders, armies or fleets (by play of command points) to move on the map. Players must constantly weight the value of an event or reaction card against the need for its command points. Command points themselves can be played for a wide variety of activities, making play unpredictable and fresh with each sitting.

This was His Majesty's Royal Army, commanded by General Sir William Howe. They were marching through the extreme southeastern corner of Pennsylvania and heading toward fledgling America's capital at Philadelphia. Only short weeks earlier this army had disembarked at Head of Elk, Maryland, after a 32-day voyage from New York City aboard the largest armada North America has ever seen. With some 14,000 troops, including crack German mercenaries and elite American Loyalist units, Howe's army was about to execute a flanking maneuver of &quot;Jacksonian&quot; proportions.<br/><br/>General George Washington, holding interior lines at Morristown, New Jersey, was unsure whether Howe would move north in support of the British invasion from Canada (see Saratoga, 1777), or whether he would move south against the Capital. Once the armada set sail, however, Washington shifted southwest and took up a naturally strong defensive position, on high ground behind Brandywine Creek, astride the main road to Philadelphia. Washington posted his troops advantageously and in depth. Control of the fords of the Brandywine would be the key to his position and although a possible flank attack was discussed, it's likelihood was discounted on the strength of local information.<br/><br/>Thus the stage was set. Howe, pursuing a strategy of posts, sought European style victory in a sudden taking of the enemy capital. Washington wrote, &quot;Should they push their designs against Philadelphia...they will put the contest on the event of a single battle. If they are overthrown...the war is at an end.

The float and march south from Canada had almost a surreal quality juxtaposed against the Adirondack wilderness. Hundreds of vessels making up an immense inland navy on Lake Champlain transported nearly 9,000 combatants together with 138 cannon. Burgoyne's objective was Fort Ticonderoga and from there, Albany, and a rendezvous with British forces coming from New York City. The strategic purpose of the campaign was nothing short of an end to the American Rebellion.<br/><br/>The intrigue on the American side lay in the cult of personality. Saratoga was to be Benedict Arnold's greatest victory in a string of successes which rank him among the finest field commanders of the era. Known to all Americans as the great traitor, it is ironic to discover that twice he salvaged the Revolution from certain collapse. It was Arnold's conspicuous gallantry and bold leadership which assured America victory at Saratoga and, by extension, its independence.<br/><br/>The fighting at Freeman's Farm would be savage. Here no farmer's militia, but rather Continental Regulars (anxious to redeem a recent reputation for retreat), stood toe to toe with Europe's finest. The sanguinary nature of the fighting was summed up best by American Brigadier General John Glover who said, &quot;Both sides seemed determined to conquer or die.&quot;<br/><br/>It's the 19th of September, 1777. Do you, as the British, attempt to storm the prepared American positions on the high ground at Bemis Heights in order to open up the River Road and the most direct route to Albany? Or do you attempt to turn the American left where intelligence reports the American defenses are incomplete and the ground favors your approach? How will you employ the large number of Hessian mercenaries in your army? Will their performance match their reputation?<br/><br/>As the Americans do you wait on Bemis Heights for the approach of the enemy as General Gates preferred, or do you sortie and meet the approach of the British in the forests where their artillery will be of little value? Will Generals Gates and Arnold cooperate, or will their feud spell disaster for the American cause? And what of the fog on this chilly Autumn morning? Will it be an ally to the Americans by impeding the progress of the enemy?<br/><br/>These are only a few of the challenges facing you as you relive one of history's most decisive battles and the turning point of the American Revolution.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": ["First Edition", "Second Edition"], "average": "7.11692", "name": "Saratoga", "playingtime": "180", "boardgamemechanic": ["Hex-and-Counter"], "age": "12", "usersrated": "333", "boardgameaccessory": ["Saratoga: Mounted Mapboard"], "boardgamesubdomain": ["Wargames"], "boardgamefamily": ["Battles of the American Revolution", "Country: USA"], "boardgamepodcastepisode": ["ET79: Volvemos a dar la BRASSa"]}, "3414": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic361595.jpg", "poll": [], "boardgamedesigner": ["Dean Essig", "Al Sandrick"], "statistics": [], "yearpublished": "1995", "maxplayers": "2", "boardgameartist": ["Dean Essig", "Sawshun Yamaguchi"], "boardgamepublisher": ["The Gamers", "Kokusai-Tsushin Co., Ltd.

Fresh from his victory in Poland, Hitler planned a blow that would knock France out of the war. key to this plan was knife-like attack through the Ardennes to the English Channel which would split the Allied forces moving north to block the expected replay of 1914 and the Maginot Line forces immobile in the south. To add to the trap, the Germans planned the first massive airborne operation of the war. This attack would capture the hinterland of Holland, pave the way for subordinate German Armored thrusts crossing the Maas, and to continue the lure the Allies northward.<br/><br/>Fallschirmjaeger covers this bait. The German player plops down an airborne invasion force with the goal of fighting off all-comers until relieved by advancing ground forces. The Dutch, all but abandoned by their French and British Allies, put up a fight for the record books. The German air bridge held on by its fingernail. While the main German drive was never in doubt, these scattered paratroopers had the fight of their lives against a small nation unwilling to succumb without giving the fight everything.<br/><br/>In the end, the Dutch government had to be evacuated along with the Dutch Gold Reserve, to form a government in exile. They would return after liberation.<br/><br/>The player must do all these things, or smash the German paratroopers before they are rescued by the Panzers, to win. Any German player thinking he'll have an easy time, must be reminded his is not Nazi Germany's main effort and that he must make-do on a shoestring.<br/><br/>Fallschirmjaeger is the eighth game in the popular Standard Combat Series by The Gamers.

If a car spins out, a &quot;wet track&quot; marker is placed on the corner, subsequently requiring all cars to roll for a chance when going through it.<br/><br/>If a car is blocked and cannot move the entire number of spaces required (and the car has no more hard braking left and cannot down shift enough), the cars collide.

However, in Risikard, battles are resolved by use of cards, instead of dice, and the board serves more as a visual indicator than a gaming area.<br/><br/>The game consists of 1 small map board, 2 tank pieces, a rule book and 110 cards.<br/><br/>There are 42 Territory Cards, each representing one of the areas on the map. Of the information on these cards, the most important are the number 'Value', of which a certain amount are needed to win the game, and the 'Winning Symbol' (explained below). There are 54 Army Cards and one Wild Card. All army cards have symbols representing either infantry, cavalry or artillery and a value from 1-6. There are also 13 Mission Cards, which remain hidden to others throughout the game, and state the formula one must obtain to win.<br/><br/>At the beginning of the game, territories are selected one at a time and starting army hands and a mission card are drawn.<br/><br/>Each turn then commences with an attack by declaring war on an adjacent territory. Cards are revealed from the attacker and defenders hand and whoever has the higher number wins, the wild card trumping any other value. When one player wins two battles, that person gains the other's territory card.<br/><br/>The second stage of the turn is the protection of territories. In this turn you may choose to defend territories by presenting three Territory Cards with different 'Winning Symbols' from the same continent (also known as a &quot;set&quot;). Protected territories may not be attacked but also can't aid to increase your number of army cards. Army cards in hand are then discarded and the same number of cards are drawn at which point the player may attack again.<br/><br/>In the final stage of a turn, the player adjusts his/her hand based on the number of sets that aren't part of protected territories that they control.<br/><br/>The game is won when a player fulfills the requirements of the 'victory formula' stated on his/her Mission Card. An example of this formula is you must control all of Africa, Oceania and you must have additional territories totalling a value of 12 or more.

Star Trek Chess) was first detailed in Franz Joseph Schnaubelt's book, the Starfleet Technical Manual, published by Ballantine in 1975. A fan, Andrew Bartmess, got in touch with Mr. Schnaubelt and fully fleshed out the rules. It adds a third dimension to the game making chess more difficult. Vertical movement, as well as the tradition horizontal movement, creates many new moves and strategy.<br/><br/>Reproductions of the original prop were sold by the Franklin Mint for a time.<br/><br/>Roughly, there are three fixed 4x4 boards staggered so that the lower board's last two rows are under the middle board's first two, and likewise the middle board's last two rows are under the top board's first two. Four 2x2 movable attack boards attach to the corners of the fixed boards, above or under, so that the game actually has a total of seven planes (but only 16 of the 96 extra squares are &quot;in existence&quot; at any one time). The attack boards are also necessary as bridges between the fixed boards. Notation of positions and moves (since now there are sometimes several possible paths between any two starting and ending squares) is initially problematic, but well addressed by Mr. Bartmess.<br/><br/>The standard set up is uneven, with the lower (white) board's attack boards starting above instead of under as called for by symmetry. This gives an advantage to white since he can reach the neutral board faster than black as a consequence.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "average": "5.87143", "name": "3-D Chess", "playingtime": "90", "boardgamemechanic": ["Grid Movement"], "age": "0", "usersrated": "112", "boardgamesubdomain": ["Abstract Games"], "boardgamefamily": ["3D Games", "Chess Games", "Star Trek", "Three Dimensional Chess Variants"]}, "3500": {"boardgamedesigner": ["Detlef Wendt"], "average": "6.31286", "poll": [], "name": "Schmuggler an Bord", "playingtime": "30", "minplayers": "3", "boardgamemechanic": ["Roll / Spin and Move", "Set Collection"], "yearpublished": "1992", "usersrated": "35", "maxplayers": "6", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic262975_t.jpg", "boardgameartist": ["Georg Hornberger"], "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["Ravensburger Spieleverlag GmbH"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic262975.jpg", "boardgameversion": ["Finnish/Swedish edition", "French first edition", "German first edition", "Italian first edition"], "maxplaytime": "30", "boardgamecategory": ["Memory"], "age": "8", "minplaytime": "30", "description": "The game consists of a board, showing 30 different types of contraband goods, Gold, Cigarettes etc, each marked by a small picture and it's name. Each picture has a matching tile, which is placed face down over it. Players each receive a number of chips and then take two or three (depending on the number of players), of the tiles for themselves, announcing which they have taken and then laying them face down in front of them. Now play begins.<br/><br/>The players take turns to roll the die and then move around the board. At first they generally land on a space where the picture is covered by a tile. They take this tile for themselves, and lay it face down in front of them announcing as they do so which it was. As the tiles start to disappear though, players land on spaces where the tile is already missing. They then have to say who they think has that tile. If correct, they receive the tile. If the named player however thinks that he hasn't got the tile, then he may in turn name another player, and so on until either a named player accepts that he has the tile, or a player who has already been named is named again. Then it is sorted out who really did have the tile, working backwards through the chain of accusations until it is found. The owner, when unmasked, passes it to the first player correctly to have named him, and all players who have falsely accused someone must pay chips into the Bank, one chip for each false accusation made in that turn.<br/><br/>Obviously, the passing on of tiles complicates matters terribly. It is simple enough to remember who took the tile in the first place, but by the time you have unraveled a chain of four or five false accusations, trying to remember who now has the tile is not so simple. The game goes on until either someone has collected a specified number of tiles, dependent on the number of players, or someone has no chips left. A player's tiles count two points each and every remaining chip one point, so it is quite possible to win without collecting many tiles, you merely have to avoid guessing falsely.<br/>(Jon Webley from GameCabinet)<br/><br/>"}}
