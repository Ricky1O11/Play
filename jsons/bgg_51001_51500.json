Grappling or covering an opponent makes the threat of violence as effective and dramatic as charging in guns blazing. --publisher's description<br/><br/>"}, "51304": {"rpg": {"356": "Generic / Universal"}, "statistics": {}, "name": "Jonril:  Gateway to the Sunken Lands", "rpgproducer": {"3": "(Uncredited)"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic526240.jpg", "usersrated": "0", "rpgitemversion": {"6995": "Saddle Stapled (modules/pamphlets)"}, "average": "0", "rpgissuearticle": {"16097": "Capsule Reviews"}, "rpggenre": {"961": "Fantasy"}, "rpgcategory": {"2107": "Campaign Setting (game world)"}, "poll": {}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic526240_t.jpg", "description": "Jonril:  Gateway to the Sunken Lands is a fully populated, predominantly human city designed to be used with the Midkemian Game System, The Tome of Midkemia.

The only ones still willing to argue the point were hill-men savages and the glorified bandits that populate the Scavenger Lands. The Empress had it all, a never-ending reign. And then, she vanished.<br/><br/>Now, it seems like the Realm&rsquo;s dominion is nothing but a fading memory. The world tears itself apart. Great powers come out of hiding in the Empress&rsquo; absence. The dead have destroyed a city in the East, and the Realm&rsquo;s armies marched to defeat against the Bull of the North. Every kingdom is full of war profiteers and prophets of woe. An age of war approaches with the certainty of an onrushing storm.<br/><br/>As a mortal in the Age of Sorrows, you must survive as best you can in a time of warring heroes. As the world trembles on the eve of the Time of Tumult, you must find your way without special might or wisdom. Will you rise to defend your ideals or merely seek to survive? What stories will they tell of you?<br/><br/>From the Introduction:<br/>The Exalted Players Guide is intended to supplement the rules of the main Exalted book. It adds new options for character creation, enhances the original combat system, provides rules for mass combat, allows for new character types and generally expands upon the main Exalted rules to make them more complete. Each of the following chapters may have something to add to your game. Evaluate each of them, go over them with your players, and if you all agree, then integrate them into your game. In many cases, such as for Merits and Flaws, it may be best to wait until everyone makes new characters or someone else begins storytelling to integrate the changes.<br/><br/>Chapter One: Merits and Flaws details Merits and Flaws, special Traits that some characters possess and others do not.<br/><br/>Chapter Two: The God-Blooded contains comprehensive rules for portraying those individuals touched by the divine through their lineage or the use of certain powerful divine blessings.<br/><br/>Chapter Three: Mortal Thaumaturgy covers the intricacies of mortal magic. Frail though it is, mortal magical workings are one of the few sources of might available to the unExalted, and thaumaturgy has a powerful impact on the day-to-day life of the average inhabitant of Creation.<br/><br/>Chapter Four: The Dragon Kings provides rules for playing the prehuman masters of Creation, the saurian Dragon Kings.<br/><br/>Chapter Five: The Exalted contains the Mail and Steel mass-combat rules and the Exalted Power Combat combat-system enhancements, and it details the learning and practice of the supernatural martial arts among all the Exalted.<br/><br/>Appendix: Writing in the Age of Sorrows includes guides to writing in two of the alphabets of Creation and a short essay on writing in the Realm.<br/><br/>"}, "51407": {"rpg": {"405": "Exalted (1st Edition)"}, "statistics": {}, "name": "Kingdom of Halta", "rpgproducer": {"9821": "John Chambers"}, "usersrated": "8", "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic907327.jpg", "rpgitemversion": {"16202": "PDF Version"}, "rpgsetting": {"2315": "Age of Sorrows"}, "average": "6.625", "rpggenre": {"174": "Animation / Comics (Anime / Manga)"}, "rpgcategory": {"2107": "Campaign Setting (game world)"}, "poll": {}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic907327_t.jpg", "description": "Threshold kingdom sourcebook for Exalted, first edition.<br/><br/>Back Cover:<br/>Lords of the Forest<br/>The Linowan call the Haltans man-apes and jape they lie down with their pets as with their husbands and wives. Savants of the Realm claim that the Republic's inhabitants are no more than Wyld-twisted slaves of the Fair Folk. Yet, the Haltans and their beast companions live free and prosperous in the forests of the Northeast and pay no tribute to the despotic Realm. Now, at the dawn of the Age of Sorrows, the trees can no longer shelter them. Where will the Haltan nation stand in an age of warring gods and heroes?<br/><br/>Masters of the Beasts<br/>Kingdom of Halta details the Haltan people, with their arboreal society, their animal companions and their endless war with the Linowan. Inside, players and Storytellers alike will discover the secrets of the Haltans' trade with the Far East, their pacts with the Fair Folk and their ancient resistance to the Realm.<br/><br/>From the Introduction:<br/>The Threshold of Exalted is home to many kingdoms. Most are petty autocracies, miniature Realms ruled by despots who are themselves tiny imitation Empresses. But though these are the majority, they are not the only sort of nation to exist in the Threshold. Many large states maintain stable governments with distinct cultures. These nations are profoundly influenced by the gods and magical world around them, and foremost among these nations (both in terms of political importance and degree of magical influence) is the arboreal Kingdom of Halta.<br/><br/>Kingdom of Halta explores this wooded kingdom, a redwood paradise that serves as the very instrument of its forest gods, who do not rule it as princes, though they are in its people&rsquo;s hearts. It was likewise shaped by Lunars, but it is not their tool. It is forever a product of its endless rivalry with the ground-dwelling Fair Folk, but it has come to an uneasy understanding with the fey and is not defined entirely by its opposition to faerie. Finally, Halta is forever locked in a brutal war for land with the Linowan, a great tribal nation whose people are the protectors and servants of their deciduous gods just as the Haltans are the guardians of their redwood habitat. All of these conflicts serve to create a diverse and flexible society.<br/><br/>"}, "51408": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic530209.jpg", "rpg": {"2029": "De Profundis"}, "rpgseries": {"8378": "Nowa Fala"}, "boardgamedesigner": {"5143": {"name": "Micha\u0142 Oracz"}}, "poll": {}, "boardgameartist": {"5143": "Micha\u0142 Oracz"}, "boardgamepublisher": {"9762": {"name": "Cubicle 7 Entertainment"}}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic530209_t.jpg", "boardgamecategory": {"1024": {"name": "Horror"}}, "rpgitemversion": {"12637": "De Profundis"}, "boardgamehonor": {"13343": "2002 Diana Jones Award for Excellence in Gaming Nominee"}, "description": "From the back cover:<br/><br/>&quot;De Profundis is a radical GM-free role-playing game of modern and 1920s horror in the style of H.P.

This process continues until finally the player throws 2 or 5 with his remaining di(c)e, thus losing them and ending his throw.

The winner is the person who scored the highest total in a set number of turns or predetermined time.<br/><br/>Yankee Grab: A game for 3 or 4 players using 3 dice.<br/>Each player in turn throws the three dice. The highest of these is set aside, and the player rolls the two remaining dice. The highest of these is set aside again. These two numbers are totalled and then multiplied by the last dice after it has been thrown again. The score is noted and the next player has his three throws.<br/>The player with the highest score wins the round. It is traditional to play 10 rounds with the winner having won the majority of rounds.<br/><br/>5000: A game for any number of players using 6 dice.<br/>The object of the game is to accumulate 5000 points. The dice score as follows:<br/>Any 5 scores 50 points<br/>Any 1 scores 100 points<br/>Three 2's score 200<br/>Straight 1 to 6 scores 1500<br/>6 of a kind = instant win 5000 points<br/>Three 5's score 500 points<br/>Three 6's score 600 points<br/>Three 1's score 1000 points<br/>3 pairs score 500 points<br/><br/>To play: The 1st player throws the 6 dice. The dice which score are set to one side and the remaining dice can be thrown again. Scoring dice are again put to one side. This can be repeated as many times as necessary. A player does not have to put aside all scoring dice if he does not wish. In each turn a player must score at least 350. This is called the BASE SCORE. After the base score is reached the player has the option to STICK or continue throwing. If he sticks the points scored in that turn are noted and play passes to the next player. With each throw of the dice at least one die must score and increase the point count of that turn or the whole score for that turn is lost, and play passes to the next player. If all 6 dice score and have been placed to one side, all six may be thrown again. One can continue as long as the score is improved with each throw.<br/>When a player has stuck or lost his turn, the dice pass to the next player, who must either score 'base' ot at least 50 points more than the previous player's score for that turn, whichever is greatest. Failure to do so means that the score for that round is lost.<br/><br/>Rotation: A game for any number of players using 2 dice.<br/>The possible totals that two dice can make are: 2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12.<br/>There are 11 rounds to this game - one for each total. In teh first round the players each try and score a total of 2. If he suceeds 2 is added to his score. In the second round players try to score a total of 3 etc. E,g. in round 7 when players are trying to achieve a total of 8, a player throws a 5 and a 3. 8 points are therefore added to his score.

The anthropomorphic character races are portrayed as races in their own right, rather than simply being people dressed in furry animal suits.<br/>        Albedo aims to be very different from run-of-the-mill science fiction adventure games.

Clever adventure plots, political intrigue, and interpersonal relations become readily playable, encouraging a very different type of game.<br/>        Albedo's background material is notable for its well thought out technological base and the unique society it describes. The game includes details on languages and alphabet, societal attitudes, and day-to-day life, as well as outlining dozens of different critter races.

The first 84 pages are sourcebook material, beginning with Clint Staples material describing the cultures that dominated the New World before the arrival of Columbus, with particular attention to the details of the religious themes that dominated the region: blood, sacrifice, death. There is also information on the modern states of the region including revolutionary Mexico and Banana Republics like Honduras, and the histories of the most important figures in the study of these ancient peoples. Brian Appleton has written articles on the ancient weapons of the Mesoamericans, as well as cataloging the deities and monsters of local mythology. Besides his exquisitely bloodcurdling illustrations, Blair Reynolds has also contributed an article on Maya calendrics, which should be of interest to everyone as the winter solstice of 2012 continues to approach. The four independent scenarios do not form a cohesive campaign, but as all of the scenarios require the same skill set (experts in Mesoamerican archeology) from player characters, a Keeper could easily run all four of the scenarios in sequence. The Well of Sacrifice, by John H. Crowe III, is a bit of a legend around Pagan Publishing. Playtested again and again, the scenario gained the nick-name The Boneyard. Let's hope your players fair better than we did. The Mehirs in the Grotto, by Brian Appleton, brings the Investigators to central Mexico, where an ancient evil is being unearthed by modern progress. The Heretics, by John H. Crowe III, places the Investigators between two warring groups of Mythos cultists, with very few good options open to them. The Temple of the Toad, by Brian Appleton, provides a grim epilogue to a classic tale of the Cthulhu Mythos, one that could easily consume the members of an expedition into the jungles of Honduras.<br/><br/>"}, "51155": {"rpgitemversion": {"6832": "Softcover Version"}, "poll": {}, "name": "Everyday Heroes", "rpghonor": {"14043": "2006 ENnie for Best Supplement - Runner Up"}, "rpgproducer": {"20638": "Sherry Willet"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic525507.jpg", "usersrated": "3", "average": "7.66667", "statistics": {}, "rpg": {"847": "Deliria"}, "rpgcategory": {"2108": "Sourcebook (rules/options to enhance play)"}, "rpggenre": {"848": "Fantasy (Modern Urban Fantasy)"}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic525507_t.jpg", "description": "From the back:<br/><br/>&quot;Anyone can be a hero, especially in faerie tales.

Each game lasts around 20 minutes.<br/><br/>An adaptoid is a creature that constantly evolves to adapt itself to its surroundings. To survive it needs to be fed. In adaptoid, two armies of adaptoids must confront one another with the aim of eliminating all opponents.<br/><br/>The game is played on a 37-space hexagonal board. Each player receives a supply of adaptoid bodies in either white or black which are plastic discs with laser-cut sockets ready to receive one of the small pile of claws and legs in the colour of each player. The capabilities of each of the adaptoids varies through the game depending on how many and what type of appendage are added.<br/><br/>Each player turn has 3 phases: Movement, Growth and Feeding. In the movement phase, the player may move one of their adaptoids as many spaces as it has limbs. Adaptoids cannot move through occupied spaces, but they can move on top of an opposing adaptoid to initiate a capture.<br/><br/>In the growth phase the player must either spawn a new, empty, adaptoid next to one of their existing pieces or add a leg or a claw to any adaptoid already on the board.<br/><br/>In the feeding phase, every enemy piece is checked for starvation. An adaptoid requires space to graze equal to its number of limbs. Any enemy piece which has fewer empty spaces around it than limbs starves to death and is removed. Starving your opponent to death (or indeed having them incautiously starve themselves) is worth a point.<br/><br/>The resolution of capture move is simple. The adaptoid with the most claws wins and the other adaptoid is removed from the board. If both pieces have the same number of claws, both are removed with a point going to each player. Starved or captured pieces are returned to the supply ready for further use.<br/><br/>The game ends when one player has either obtained 5 points by capturing and starving enemy adaptoids or has been completely eliminated from the board.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": {"75842": "Deluxe edition"}, "average": "6.99915", "name": "Adaptoid", "playingtime": "20", "boardgamemechanic": {"2043": "Area Enclosure"}, "age": "8", "boardgameexpansion": {}, "usersrated": "118", "boardgamesubdomain": {"4666": "Abstract Games"}, "boardgamefamily": {"26432": "Combinatorial"}}, "51196": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic527295.jpg", "poll": {}, "boardgamedesigner": {"9393": {"name": "N\u00e9stor Romeral Andr\u00e9s"}}, "statistics": {}, "yearpublished": "2009", "maxplayers": "4", "boardgameartist": {"9393": "N\u00e9stor Romeral Andr\u00e9s"}, "boardgamepublisher": {"10094": {"name": "nestorgames"}}, "maxplaytime": "20", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic527295_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "20", "boardgamecategory": {"1009": {"name": "Abstract Strategy"}}, "boardgamehonor": {"19811": "2009-2010 Premio Jugamos Tod@s Winner"}, "description": "A strategy board game for 2 or more players designed by N&eacute;stor Romeral Andr&eacute;s in 2009 .<br/><br/>In HEXELLATION, the players try to create a previously fixed star constellation named &lsquo;MODEL&rsquo; without creating a different one named &lsquo;AVOID&rsquo;.
