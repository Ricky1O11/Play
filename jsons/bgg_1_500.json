Players are in charge of national political parties, and must manage limited resources to help their party to victory. The winning party will have the most victory points after all the regional elections. There are four different ways of scoring victory points. First, each regional election can supply one to eighty victory points, depending on the size of the region and how well your party does in it. Second, if a party wins a regional election and has some media influence in the region, then the party will receive some media-control victory points. Third, each party has a national party membership which will grow as the game progresses and this will supply a fair number of victory points. Lastly, parties score some victory points if their party platform matches the national opinions at the end of the game.<br/><br/>The 1986 edition featured 4 parties from the old West Germany and supported 3-4 players. The 1997 edition supports up to 5 players in the re-united Germany and updated several features of the rules as well.

The game is set in the mythical world of the elves.  A group of fledgling elves (the players) are charged with visiting as many of the twenty Elfencities as they can over the course of 4 rounds.  To accomplish the task they will use various forms of transportation such as Giant Pigs, Elfcarts, Unicorns, Rafts, Magic Clouds, Trollwagons, and Dragons.<br/><br/>Gameplay:  Players begin in the Elf capitol, draw one face down movement tile, and are dealt eight transport cards and a secret 'home' city card that they must reach at the end of the 4th round or lose points for each city space away from 'home' they are at the end of the game. Markers of each player's color are placed in each city on the board and are collected when the player visits that city (each counts as 1 point).<br/>  <br/>     The round proceeds in 2 stages.  The first part of the round consists of the drawing of Tiles showing the differing types of transport (except rafts) from a combination of face up and face down tiles (if a player doesn't like the 5 tiles that are face up; they can always draw blind from the face down tiles and hope to get one they need).  These transport tiles need to match the Transportation cards in your hand to use them most effectively.  After each player has a total of 4 tiles they take turns placing a tile on any one of the roads that run between the elf cities.  Only one transport tile may be placed on each road; so players may use other players tiles to travel if they have the matching cards in their hand.  This frequently causes a readjustment of planned travel routes as other players tiles can allow you to move farther or shorter than you had first thought.  Players can play their tiles to help themselves or hinder others by playing a slow mode of transport on another players (perceived) path.<br/><br/>Each mode of transport has certain terrain it can travel through quickly or slowly, and those that it cannot. These are listed on the top of each transportation card by the number terrain symbols.  The number of terrain symbols equals how many matching cards you must play to move across a given tile in a given terrain.  For example, a Magic Cloud tile placed in a mountain would take one Magic cloud card to travel across (1 mountain symbol on card means Magic clouds are fast in mountains). If the same tile was placed on a road in forest terrain it would require 2 Magic Cloud cards to travel that route (2 Forest symbols on card means Magic Clouds are slow in Forest).  Magic Clouds cannot travel in desert terrain at all (no desert symbols on card). All modes of transport are different and Rafts can be used on rivers or lakes without needing tiles. Rafts go slow upstream (2 raft cards needed) and fast downstream (1 card needed).  The small lake requires 1 raft card to travel across and the larger lake requires 2 cards to travel across.  Players may keep one unused transport counter and up to 4 Transportation cards from one round to the next.<br/><br/>The second part of the round begins after all players have finished placing their transportation tiles for the round.  Each player plays his cards and moves his elf-boot around the board collecting his tokens from the cities visited.  If there is a Transport tile on a route and a player has no matching Transportation card he may 'Caravan' across it by playing any 3 Transportation cards from his hand.<br/><br/>As a bit of 'take that' each player has a trouble tile which can be placed next to any transportation tile during the first part of the round.  This counter means that in order to travel that path an additional card of the transport type must be played or 4 cards to 'Caravan'.<br/><br/>Victory: if at the end of round 3 a player has visited all 20 cities he is the winner.  If not the game ends after round 4 when 'Home' cities are revealed and each player subtracts points for each city he is away from his 'home' subtracting that from his collected city tokens.

Tension builds because the round may end before all players have had a chance to win their three lots for the epoch.  The various tiles either give immediate points, prevent negative points for not having certain types at the end of the round (epoch), or give points after the final round.

On each turn dice are rolled to determine what resources the island produces. Players collect these resources (cards)&mdash;wood, grain, brick, sheep, or stone&mdash;to build up their civilizations to get to 10 victory points and win the game.<br/><br/>Setup includes randomly placing large hexagonal tiles (each showing a resource or the desert) in a honeycomb shape and surrounding them with water tiles, some of which contain ports of exchange. Number disks, which will correspond to die rolls (two 6-sided dice are used), are placed on each resource tile. Each player is given two settlements (think: houses) and roads (sticks) which are, in turn, placed on intersections and borders of the resource tiles. Players collect a hand of resource cards based on which hex tiles their last-placed house is adjacent to. A robber pawn is placed on the desert tile.<br/><br/>A turn consists of possibly playing a development card, rolling the dice, everyone (perhaps) collecting resource cards based on the roll and position of houses (or upgraded cities&mdash;think: hotels) unless a 7 is rolled, turning in resource cards (if possible and desired) for improvements, trading cards at a port, and trading resource cards with other players. If a 7 is rolled, the active player moves the robber to a new hex tile and steals resource cards from other players who have built structures adjacent to that tile.<br/><br/>Points are accumulated by building settlements and cities, having the longest road and the largest army (from some of the development cards), and gathering certain development cards that simply award victory points. When a player has gathered 10 points (some of which may be held in secret), he announces his total and claims the win.<br/><br/>Catan has won multiple awards and is one of the most popular games in recent history due to its amazing ability to appeal to experienced gamers as well as those new to the hobby.<br/><br/>Die Siedler von Catan was originally published by KOSMOS and has gone through multiple editions. It was licensed by Mayfair and has undergone four editions as The Settlers of Catan. In 2015, it was formally renamed Catan to better represent itself as the core and base game of the Catan series. It has been re-published in two travel editions, portable edition and compact edition, as a special gallery edition (replaced in 2009 with a family edition), as an anniversary wooden edition, as a deluxe 3D collector's edition, in the basic Simply Catan, as a beginner version, and with an entirely new theme in Japan and Asia as Settlers of Catan: Rockman Edition.

If only 1 player chose a particular action, they simply perform that action. If 2 players chose the same action, they barter back and forth with gemstones. One player will eventually accept the other's offer of gems, and the other will take the action. If 3 or 4 players all chose the same action card, that action is cancelled.

They put in hard hours building high-speed supercars they never get to see in action. But on Saturday nights, the factory becomes a world of mad machines and dangerous schemes as these robots engage in their own epic race.It takes speed, wits, and dirty tricks to become a racing legend! Each player chooses a robot and directs its moves by playing cards. Chaos ensues as all players reveal the cards they've chosen. Players face obstacles like industrial lasers, gaping pits, and moving conveyer belts -- but those can also be used to their advantage! Each player aims to make it to each of the checkpoints in numerical order. The first player to reach all of the checkpoints wins. (source: <a target='_blank' href='http://avalonhill.wizards.com/games/robo-rally/comingsoon' rel='nofollow'>http://avalonhill.wizards.com/games/robo-rally/comingsoon</a>)<br/><br/><br/><br/>In RoboRally players each control a different robot in a race through a dangerous factory floor. Several goals will be placed on the board and you must navigate your robot to them in a specific order. The boards can be combined in several different ways to accommodate different player counts and races can be as long or as short as player's desire.<br/><br/>In general, players will first fill all of their robot's &quot;registers&quot; with facedown movement cards. This happens simultaneously and there is a time element involved. If you don't act fast enough you are forced to place cards randomly to fill the rest. Then, starting with the first register, everyone reveals their card. The card with the highest number moves first. After everyone resolves their movement they reveal the next card and so on. Examples of movement cards may be to turn 90 degrees left or right, move forward 2 spaces, or move backward 1 space though there are a bigger variety than that. You can plan a perfect route, but if another robot runs into you it can push you off course. This can be disastrous since you can't reprogram any cards to fix it!<br/><br/>Robots fire lasers and factory elements resolve after each movement and robots may become damaged. If they take enough damage certain movement cards become fixed and can no longer be changed. If they take more they may be destroyed entirely. The first robot to claim all the goals in the correct order wins, though some may award points and play tournament style.<br/><br/>The game was reprinted by Avalon Hill (Hasbro/WotC) in 2005.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": ["Avalon Hill Edition", "Avalon Hill edition 2010", "Dutch edition", "German edition", "Play Factory edition", "Wizards of the Coast edition", "Wizards of the Coast Second Edition"], "average": "7.15242", "name": "RoboRally", "playingtime": "120", "boardgamemechanic": ["Action / Movement Programming", "Grid Movement", "Modular Board", "Simultaneous Action Selection"], "age": "12", "boardgameexpansion": ["1569", "1968", "1967", "88354", "1966"], "usersrated": "19434", "boardgamesubdomain": ["Strategy Games", "Thematic Games"], "boardgamefamily": ["Robots"], "boardgamepodcastepisode": ["BGTG - June 11, 2005 (Mike Mayer and Robo Rally)", "BGTG 136 - 100 Great Games, part 3 (with Stephen Glenn and Mark Jackson)", "Ep 39 Real Time", "Ep 42  Illustrations with Henning Ludvigsen", "Ep 47 Grey Fox Games with Josh Lebkowicz", "Episode 10: Cosmic Encounter/Why We Play", "Episode 33 - Top 50, Picks 20-11", "GameBreak Audio Episode #013 - Domo Arigato, Mister Roboto", "I've Been Diced! episode 10: Gateway games", "I've Been Diced! episode 3: Games that stood the test of time", "Ludology Episode 78 - Here We Are Now, Entertain Us", "MN 0035 Racing Games", "OBG 30: Start Your Engines", "Podcast #14: That Heart-Restarting Moment", "Polyhedron Collider Cast Episode 2"]}, "19": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic786075.jpg", "poll": [], "boardgamedesigner": ["Klaus Teuber"], "statistics": [], "yearpublished": "1991", "maxplayers": "4", "boardgameartist": ["Chris McGloughlin", "Franz Vohwinkel"], "boardgamepublisher": ["Hans im Gl\u00fcck Verlags-GmbH", "Mayfair Games"], "maxplaytime": "45", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic786075_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "30", "boardgamecategory": ["American West", "Bluffing", "City Building"], "boardgamehonor": ["1991 Deutscher Spiele Preis Best Family/Adult Game 3rd Place", "1991 Spiel des Jahres Winner"], "description": "A long time ago, in a village far, far away, some disturbed townsfolk decided to destroy their entire town in order to rid themselves of an evil menace (it's technically a dog-mouse, but I think it's an idiomatic thing).  Anyway, so the villagers rebuilt all the buildings in the town (including their precious outhouses), but forgot to include city walls, a river, or roads.  To rectify this, players lay tiles with one of these three things onto the board, and any building caught underneath them is automatically eliminated, except for outhouses.  When an outhouse would be destroyed, players take a vote on whether to place that particular section.  Each player is trying to retain the most of one type of building, and once all the pieces have been placed the winner is the person with the highest valued buildings still standing.<br/><br/>Wacky, Wacky West re-make description:<br/><br/>Fans of Klaus Teuber will be interested in this remake/redesign of Drunter und Dr&uuml;ber, a 1991 Spiel des Jahres winner.<br/><br/><br/>Just south of nowhere, there's the junction of the Mayfair &amp; Rossdorf RR and the Turvy Trunk Line. Springing up from the desert like a tumbleweed lies the eccentric little town of Rossdorf. Like most western towns, Rossdorf has a Land Agent: Guy Dough, the brother of that wicked varmint Black Benny. A shrewd opportunist, Guy's done sold all the town land ('ceptin' the outhouses) four times over! Every acre in town that ain't got an outhouse on it is owned by the miners, the railroads, AND the fort captain. Just about a year ago, miners digging in the shadow of Fort Rossdorf struck the mother lode! But it wasn't gold, and it wasn't silver. No, my friend, it was just a little spring. Not any ordinary spring, though! It was a torrent of that mind-marbling drink the locals call &quot;Wacky Water!&quot; <br/><br/><br/>Now that water's done what the sun and the wind couldn't do: it's made those landholders brave enough to take matters into their own hands. Now they'll use whatever means they can to bowl over the competition and lay claim to the only fertile spots left in town! Now the only thing stoppin' 'em is the Town Charter Amendment #5, which states: &quot;no landholder may move, remove, or detonate any outhouse without a majority vote of the Town Citizens...&quot; Now one thing's for sure: something's gonna stink in Rossdorf, purty darn soon.....<br/><br/><br/>In Wacky Wacky West you and your fellow townfolk place track tiles, street tiles, and river tiles hoping to destroy your rivals' buildings.

The scene is set in the ruins of a mighty kingdom, now inhabited by sparse groups of natives and swarms of monsters. Beneath it all are the rich remnants of a magical civilization, scattered and lost across the map.<br/>To this scene come the adventurers, seekers of riches and fame, to make a name for themselves in this promising field. Swordsman and Dwarf, Magician and Sorceror, the humans and the half-humans come seeking to loot the legendary riches of a lost civilization. Now you can play the part of one of these adventurers, stepping into an unknown Realm of magic and monsters, battles and treasures.<br/><br/>As a player, you will take on the role of one of the sixteen major characters who are represented in detail in the game. You will control where he goes, what he tries to do, how he handles himself in combat, and much more. In the course of the game, you will run into deadly monsters, tribes of humans ranging from old friends to sworn enemies, and treasures that will enhance your abilities in many ways.<br/><br/>MAGIC REALM is a complex game designed to recapture the suspense and desperate struggles of fantasy literature. The game creates a small but complete fantasy world, where each game is a new adventure with a new map where everything lies hidden at new locations. The game includes many more playing pieces than are actually used in a single playing. The additional pieces are set up and can appear, depending on the directions in which the characters explore, but many of the treasure troves, treasures, and spells will still be set up, unfound, when the game ends, and many of the monsters and natives might never be met. The result is an extremely unpredictable game full of surprises, a game that plays very differently each time it is played.<br/>The complete game system includes hiking, hiding and searching, fatigue, wounds, rest, trade, hiring natives, and combat between characters, monsters, and natives using a variety of weapons on horseback and afoot, as well as many magical effects.<br/><br/>Between exploring a new land where the mountains, caves, valleys, and woods change every game, and not knowing what you will find in each place, you will find each game a new and unpredictable adventure, filled with surprises.

A player can only advance three different columns in a turn and cannot advance a column which any player has closed out by reaching the end space; if a roll doesn&rsquo;t result in any legal plays, the turn ends with that turn&rsquo;s progress lost.<br/><br/>A predecessor from 1974, The Great Races, exists as a paper-and-pencil game.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": ["Asmodee French Edition", "Borras Spanish Edition", "Clipper Dutch/French edition", "Editrice Giochi Italian Edition", "Face 2 Face Games edition 2007", "Franjos 3rd edition", "Franjos Multilingual Edition 2011", "Franjos second edition", "Franjos Spieleverlag Edition", "German edition 2017", "Gryphon English edition 2011", "Japanese edition 2016", "Miro Meccano edition", "Palitoy English edition", "Parker Brothers first edition", "Parker Canadian Edition", "Parker German edition", "Ravensburger German edition 2007", "Ravensburger Multilingual Edition 2007", "Ravensburger Nordic edition"], "name": "Can't Stop", "videogamebg": ["Can't Stop"], "playingtime": "30", "boardgamemechanic": ["Dice Rolling", "Press Your Luck"], "age": "9", "boardgameexpansion": ["164592"], "usersrated": "9165", "boardgameaccessory": ["Can't Stop: Cones"], "boardgamesubdomain": ["Family Games"], "average": "6.85578", "boardgamepodcastepisode": ["32 \u2013 The Family Gamers Podcast \u2013 Anticipation!", "38 \u2013 The Family Gamers Podcast \u2013 Twice Married", "BGA Episode 100 - Top 100 Games of All Time", "Can't Stop!", "Episode 72 March Craziness Dice Game Style Part 1", "Episode 73 March Craziness Dice Game Style Part 2", "Episode 86- Terraforming Mars and Game Therapy", "Episode 8: 2011 Wrap-up", "Episode 97-- March Madness Filler Tournament", "Episode 9: Panamax, They Live, and Solforge", "HLG 8: Gelukzoekers", "Ludology Episode 76 - I Like Dice To Roll", "MN 0021 5 Minute Reviews - Love Letter and Push your Luck", "OBG 88: The Rules of Rules", "Podcast EP06 \u2013 Board Game Arena", "The One About Family Ties", "The Spiel at Essen 2011 - Eagle/Gryphon Games", "What Did You Play This Week Podcast Thing Week 15!!!!"]}, "42": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2338267.jpg", "boardgameimplementation": ["Euphrates & Tigris: Contest of Kings"], "poll": [], "boardgamedesigner": ["Reiner Knizia"], "statistics": [], "yearpublished": "1997", "maxplayers": "4", "boardgameartist": ["Bascu", "Christine Conrad", "Doris Matth\u00e4us", "Tom Thiel", "Ricarda Thiel", "Stephen Graham Walsh"], "boardgamepublisher": ["Hans im Gl\u00fcck Verlags-GmbH", "999 Games", "Devir", "Edge Entertainment", "Fantasy Flight Games", "Giochi Uniti", "Heidelberger Spieleverlag", "Lacerta", "Matagot", "Mayfair Games", "Pegasus Spiele", "Smart Ltd", "Top Licence Games", "Wargames Club Publishing"], "maxplaytime": "90", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2338267_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "90", "boardgamecategory": ["Abstract Strategy", "Ancient", "Civilization", "Territory Building"], "boardgamehonor": ["1997 Meeples' Choice Award", "1998 Deutscher Spiele Preis Best Family/Adult Game Winner", "1998 Spiel des Jahres Recommended"], "description": "Regarded by many as Reiner Knizia's masterpiece, Tigris &amp; Euphrates is set in the ancient fertile crescent with players building civilizations through tile placement. Players are given four different leaders: farming, trading, religion, and government. The leaders are used to collect victory points in these same categories. However, your score at the end of the game is the number of points in your weakest category, which encourages players not to get overly specialized. Conflict arises when civilizations connect on the board, i.e., external conflicts, with only one leader of each type surviving such a conflict. Leaders can also be replaced within a civilization through internal conflicts.<br/><br/>Starting in the Mayfair edition from 2008, Tigris &amp; Euphrates included a double-sided game board and extra components for playing an advanced version of the game. This &quot;ziggurat expansion&quot;, initially released as a separate item in Germany for those who already owned the base game, is a special monument that extends across five spaces of the board. The monument can be built if a player has a cross of five civilization tokens of the same color by discarding those five tokens and replacing them with the ziggurat markers, placing a ziggurat tower upon the middle tile. The five ziggurat markers cannot be destroyed. All rules regarding monuments apply to the ziggurat monument as well. If your king is inside the kingdom of the ziggurat, you will get one victory point in a color of your choice at the end of your turn.<br/><br/>Some versions of Tigris &amp; Euphrates are listed as being for 2-4 players, while others incorrectly state that they're for 3-4 players.

The game consists of a single deck of cards of rank 2&ndash;10 in 5 different colors with 3 special &quot;handshakes&quot; (&quot;HS&quot; in scoring examples below) in each suit. There is also a board which functions only to hold and organize discarded cards and is largely superfluous. Games last around 15 minutes. This is generally considered a good &quot;couples&quot; game and is often recommended for people with non-gamer partners.<br/><br/>The object the game is to gain points by mounting profitable archaeological expeditions to the different sites represented by the 5 colors. On a player's turn they must always first play one card, either to an expedition or by discarding it to the appropriate discard pile, and then draw one card. There is a separate discard pile for each color and a player may draw the top card of any discard pile or the top card of the deck. Cards played to expeditions must be in ascending order but they need not be consecutive. Handshakes are considered lower than a 2 and represent investments in an expedition. Thus, if you play a red 4, you may play any other red card higher than a 4 on a future turn but may no longer play a handshake, the 2, or the 3.<br/><br/>The game continues in this fashion with players alternating turns until the final card is taken from the draw pile. The rest of the cards in hand are then discarded and players score their expeditions. Each expedition that has at least one card played into it must be scored. Cards played into an expedition are worth their rank in points, and handshakes count as a multiplier against your final total. Expeditions start at a value of -20 so you must play at least 20 points of cards into an expedition in order to make a profit. If you are left with a negative value and have a handshake, the multiplier still applies. A 20-point bonus is awarded to every expedition with at least 8 cards played into it. The player with the most points wins the game, but it is typical to play 3 matches and add your score from each to see who wins.<br/><br/>Scoring example 1: an expedition has a 2,3,7,8,10 for a total of 30. This expedition is worth 10 total points: 30 minus the initial -20.<br/><br/>Scoring example 2: an expedition has 2 HS, and 4,5,6,7,8,10 for a total of 40. This expedition is worth 80 total points: 40 points for cards, minus the initial 20, &times;3 for the 2 multipliers, plus the 20-pt bonus for playing 8+ cards.<br/><br/>Scoring example 3: an expedition has 1 HS, and 4,6,7 for a total of 17. This expedition is worth -6 total points: 17 minus initial 20, &times;2 for the multiplier.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": ["999 Games Dutch edition 1999", "999 Games Dutch second edition 2013", "Albi Czech edition", "Devir edition 1999", "Devir Spanish/Portuguese edition 2006", "Devir Spanish/Portuguese edition 2015", "Filosofia French edition 2007", "Kaissa Greek edition 2001", "Kaissa Greek edition 2006", "Korea Boardgames Korean edition", "KOSMOS English edition 2014", "KOSMOS English edition 2015", "KOSMOS English second edition", "KOSMOS German edition 2015", "KOSMOS German first edition", "KOSMOS German fourth edition 2012", "KOSMOS German second edition", "KOSMOS German second edition 1999", "KOSMOS German third edition in tin", "KOSMOS/Rio Grande English first edition", "Laser Plus Slovenian edition", "Marektoy Finnish edition", "Midgaard Scandinavian edition 1999", "Piatnik Hungarian edition", "Playhouse Greek edition 2011", "Polish first edition", "Polish second edition", "Slovenian Third Edition", "Stupor Mundi Italian second edition", "Swan Chinese edition 2010", "Tilsit French edition 1999", "Tilsit Italian first edition", "Zvezda Russian edition 2007"], "average": "7.14909", "name": "Lost Cities", "videogamebg": ["Lost Cities", "Lost Cities (iOS)"], "playingtime": "30", "boardgamemechanic": ["Hand Management", "Set Collection"], "age": "10", "boardgameexpansion": ["206374"], "usersrated": "26900", "boardgamesubdomain": ["Family Games"], "boardgamefamily": ["Archaeology", "Card Games: Draw and Discard Games", "Kosmos two-player series", "Lost Cities"], "boardgamepodcastepisode": ["#19: Viticulture on tap, Quadropolis &amp; TableTop Day", "#36: 2016, A Year in Review", "#39: Two Player Games six-pack; Citrus on tap; Isle of Skye &amp; Avenue", "BGA Ep 52 - 15 Predictions for 2015", "BGWS 007 \u2013 Lost Cities", "Cubepushers - Episode 4: Let the Nerd-Rage Flow", "Dukes of Dice - Ep. 63 - The Space Between", "Episode 16:City of Iron/Blue Peg Patrick Hot Seat", "Episode 1: Troyes, Willow, and Warhammer Quest", "Episode 7: Terra Mystica, Rambo: First Blood, and a Digital App Medley", "GameBreak Audio: Episode #009 - Fill-er Up!", "GenCon 2015 - Thames &amp; Kosmos", "If You Buy One Game - KOSMOS Two Player Series", "Il Giocatore - Episodio 4 - Juegos Introductorios", "Low Player Count - Ep. 6 - Mano a Mano: Co-op or Competitive", "Ludology Episode 78 - Here We Are Now, Entertain Us", "MN 0040 Two Player Games", "Podcast EP06 \u2013 Board Game Arena", "Podcast EP07 \u2013 Rentr\u00e9e 2016 et retour de voyage", "Podcast EP10 \u2013 Top 10 jeux de soci\u00e9t\u00e9", "What Did You Play This Week Podcast Thing Week 81", "What Did You Play This Week Podcast Thing Week 93!!"]}, "51": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1766273.jpg", "boardgameimplementation": ["Micro Robots"], "poll": [], "boardgamedesigner": ["Alex Randolph"], "statistics": [], "yearpublished": "1999", "maxplayers": "15", "minplayers": "1", "boardgamepublisher": ["ABACUSSPIELE", "Devir", "G\u00e9m Klub Kft.", "Hans im Gl\u00fcck Verlags-GmbH", "Korea Boardgames co., Ltd.", "Oya", "Playgo Hungary", "Rio Grande Games", "Swan Panasia Co., Ltd.", "Z-Man Games"], "boardgameintegration": ["Micro Robots", "Micro Robots"], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1766273_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "30", "boardgamecategory": ["Abstract Strategy", "Maze", "Puzzle", "Real-time"], "description": "Ricochet Robots is less of a game and more of a puzzle, which explains why there's such an odd number of solutions possible.

The king's power is flagging, and these powerful lords are vying for control of the various regions.  To that end, you draft caballeros (knights in the form of colored cubes) into your court and subsequently move them onto the board to help seize control of regions.  After every third round, the regions are scored, and after the ninth round, the player with the most points is the winner.<br/><br/>In each of the nine rounds, you select one of your 13 power cards to determine turn order as well as the number of caballeros you get to move from the provinces (general supply) into your court (personal supply).<br/><br/>A turn then consists of selecting one of five action cards which allow variations to the rules and additional scoring opportunities in addition to determining how many caballeros to move from your court to one or more of the regions on the board (or into the castillo - a secretive tower). Normally, you may only place your caballeros into regions adjacent to the one containing the king pawn. The one hard and fast rule in El Grande is that nothing may move into or out of the king's region. One of the five action cards that is always available each round allows you to move the king to a new region. The other four action cards varying from round to round.<br/><br/>The goal is to have a caballero majority in as many regions (and the castillo) as possible during a scoring round. Following the scoring of the castillo, you place any cubes you had stashed there into the region you had secretly indicated on your region dial. Each region is then scored individually according to a table printed in that region. Two-point bonuses are awarded for having sole majority in the region containing your Grande (large cube) and in the region containing the king.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": ["999 Games Dutch edition", "Anv\u00e4ndbart Litet F\u00f6retag Swedish First Edition", "Descartes French Edition", "Gabinete Ludico Spanish Edition 2012", "Hans im Gl\u00fcck Danish First Edition", "Hans im Gl\u00fcck German First Edition", "Hans im Gl\u00fcck German SdJ Edition", "Hans im Gl\u00fcck German Second Edition", "Rio Grande English First Edition"], "average": "7.80465", "name": "El Grande", "playingtime": "120", "boardgamemechanic": ["Area Control / Area Influence", "Area Movement", "Auction/Bidding", "Card Drafting", "Hand Management", "Memory", "Simultaneous Action Selection"], "age": "12", "boardgameexpansion": ["583", "597", "3146", "370", "5754", "27759"], "usersrated": "18527", "boardgameaccessory": ["El Grande: English Cards"], "boardgamesubdomain": ["Strategy Games"], "boardgamefamily": ["Country: Spain", "El Grande"], "boardgamepodcastepisode": ["BGA Episode 100 - Top 100 Games of All Time", "BGTG - April 16, 2005 (Game of the Month)", "BGTG 112 - Five-Player Games (with Dave O'Connor)", "Cubepushers - Episode 4: Let the Nerd-Rage Flow", "DdJ 029.

In these instances the Boarding Parties portion comes into play.  Here players line up their ships next to one another and attempt to storm the other ship and kill the opposing captain.  Players can only move a limited amount of their units each turn and so some planning is required to hem in the opposing captain.<br/><br/>The components for the game are quite elaborate.

These hired swords were contracted to fight for individual city-states by an agreement known as a condotta. The most elite of these men were the mercenary leaders known as the Condottiere.<br/><br/>The object of Condottiere is to acquire four connected provinces in renaissance Italy. To do this players auction off different provinces on the board and bid on these provinces with a hand of cards representing mercenaries, seasons, scarecrows, and political figures. However, unlike standard auctions in which only the highest bidder loses their bid, in Condottiere every player loses their bid.  Players are, in effect, bidding the number of troops they are willing to lose in order to win a province. However, several special effect cards shake the contests up and keep the players guessing.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": ["Arclight Japanese edition 2011", "Chinese edition", "Edge Spanish edition 2007", "Eurogames / Descartes German wooden figure edition 1995", "Eurogames / Descartes multilingual edition", "Eurogames demonstration copy edition", "Eurogames English edition", "Eurogames French edition 1995", "Eurogames French edition with metal figure", "Eurogames German first edition with metal figure", "Fantasy Flight / Lautapelit.fi Nordic edition 2007", "Fantasy Flight English edition 2007", "Fantasy Flight Hungarian  edition 2007", "Giochi Uniti Italian edition", "Heidelberger German third edition 2007", "Polish first edition", "Russian edition", "Ubik French edition 2007"], "average": "6.74159", "name": "Condottiere", "playingtime": "45", "boardgamemechanic": ["Area Control / Area Influence", "Auction/Bidding", "Hand Management"], "age": "14", "usersrated": "6338", "boardgamesubdomain": ["Strategy Games"], "boardgamefamily": ["Admin: Better Description Needed!", "Country: Italy", "Fantasy Flight Silver Line Games"], "boardgamepodcastepisode": ["OBG 112: A Touch of Elegance"]}, "113": {"boardgamedesigner": ["Klaus Palesch"], "poll": [], "boardgamehonor": ["1999 Fairplay \u00c0 la carte Winner", "2000 International Gamers Awards - General Strategy; Multi-player Nominee"], "name": "Mit List und T\u00fccke", "playingtime": "60", "minplayers": "4", "boardgamemechanic": ["Trick-taking"], "yearpublished": "1999", "usersrated": "204", "maxplayers": "6", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic78039_t.jpg", "average": "6.61422", "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["Berliner Spielkarten"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic78039.jpg", "boardgameversion": ["German edition"], "maxplaytime": "60", "boardgamecategory": ["Card Game"], "age": "10", "minplaytime": "60", "description": "This trick-taking game has quite a few twists.

Take It Easy is a true multi-player solitaire in which each player individually completes a hexagon-shaped board with spots for 19 hexagon tiles. There's no limit to number of players if you've got enough sets on hand. One person (the caller) draws a tile randomly and tells the others which of the 27 tiles featuring colored/numbered lines crossing in three directions, with numbers from 1 to 9, it is. &quot;The 9-8-7,&quot; for example. Each player then chooses which empty spot on his own board he'll play the 9-8-7. This is repeated until the boards are filled.<br/><br/>The idea is to complete same-numbered lines across your board. Scoring is calculated by multiplying the number on the tile with the number of tiles in the completed line. A complete column of three 9s is worth 27, for example...but a lot of players will hope for five 9s to fill the big column down the middle.<br/><br/>Take It Easy is often compared to Bingo because of the familiar pattern of a number being called and then everybody looking at their cards to play it, and then scoring if a line is completed. But that's as far as the comparison goes.

The first edition in 1903 had a deck of 63 cards, 9 each of 7 commodities, each with a value (ranging from 40 for Flax to 100 for Wheat). Players offer trades by crying out the number of cards they want to swap (&ldquo;One! One! One!&rdquo;, or &ldquo;Three! Three! Three!&rdquo;) but not their identity. The winner of the hand is the first to collect all of one commodity, declaring &ldquo;Corner on Wheat!&rdquo; or whatever commodity has been collected. The winner of the hand scores points equal to the value of the commodity, and the winner of the game is the first to 500 points.<br/><br/>The 1904 Edition of Pit added much fancier artwork and the famous Bull and Bear cards, which provide wild-card and penalty features. The early editions allowed a maximum of 7 players, but later versions supported 8 and in at least one case up to 10.<br/><br/>Pit&rsquo;s designer, noted psychic Edgar Cayce, is often accused of having stolen the idea from the game Gavitt&rsquo;s Stock Exchange (G-S-E) invented by Harry Gavitt. While G-S-E claimed patents dating as early as 1896, it involved trading railway shares, and was only copyrighted and published in 1903, the same year as Pit.  In addition, the only related patent assigned to Gavitt is     US746492 A, filed October 7, 1903, and granted December 8, 1903.  Also hitting the market in 1903 was Bourse, a remarkably similar open-outcry commodity trading game from Flinch Card Co., using an 80-card deck with 10 each of 8 commodities, and Panic, using a 65 card deck with 8 each of 8 commodities and a Panic card, roughly equivalent to the Bull.  Pit, however, seems to have cornered the market on open-outcry games, as neither of its competitors were seen again after 1904.<br/><br/>Printings:<br/><br/>    Parker Brothers (1903-???)<br/>    Out of the Box Publishing (2004-Present)<br/>    Winning Moves Games (USA)<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Microbadges<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>", "minplayers": "3", "boardgameversion": ["Clipper Dutch/French edition", "Crown & Andrews edition 1984", "Crown & Andrews Edition 2000", "Crown & Andrews edition 2006", "Crown & Andrews English edition", "Dutch edition", "Editrice Giochi Italian edition 1988", "Fundex edition 2009", "Gavitt Publishing and Printing edition 1903", "Grimaud French edition 1978", "Holdson edition", "In the Morning edition 2011", "Nordic Games edition 2010", "Out of the Box Anniversary Edition 2003", "Parker British edition in red box", "Parker Bros.

Players take actions by collecting sets of cards which correspond to the the various planets.  The game also features a unique trading system which facilitates the card collecting. Careful card trading and calculating risk of establishing economic centers, and some variants, mitigate some of the luck factor.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Game Summary<br/>Setup: 9 cards/player. Place 1 cube per planet per player, plus additional cube per planet matching cards dealt out; remaining cubes on earth. Each gets 2 special action cards.Each round: First, players may play a single special action card, in order. Then, Trade Step.

Start player must trade; recipient either accepts cards into hand, or leaves out.

Row by row, the players draft cards, and the dealer declares who would have won each row's trick, if it had been played that way.  Players use this information to deduce what the trump number and suit are.  After all the cards are drafted, each player - except the dealer - selects one of the task tiles she drafted, which will be her mission for the hand.  The dealer is stuck trying to uniquely accomplish someone else's task for the round - but at least doesn't have to preselect which person's goal he is trying to &quot;steal&quot;.

Complete a delivery and make the money you need to buy larger, faster trains, and expand your railroad empire.  Win the game by building the most effective railroad empire!<br/><br/>The original and flagship of Mayfair's crayon-rails line allows players, using washable crayons, to draw their train routes over a map of North America.  Players start with an initial sum of money which they use to build short lengths of track during their first couple of turns.  For the rest of the game, players operate their trains over the track network drawn on the board to pick up and deliver loads to various cities, and then have the opportunity to add to their track network or improve their train.  The game uses demand cards which list three demands, each of a commodity to be delivered to a specified city for a given payoff.  Each player has three demand cards to provide opportunities for income.<br/><br/>Each turn consists of an operations phase and a building phase.  During the operations phase, trains are moved to cities where commodities are picked up at no cost and moved to one of the cities on that player's demand cards.  When the commodity is delivered, the player receives the payoff and trades that demand card for a new one.  Event cards are mixed in the deck with the demand cards.  When an event card is drawn the instructions are followed.  During the building phase a player may pay to build more track or upgrade his train.<br/><br/>A player wins by being the first to connect his track network to six of the seven major cities on the board and acquire $250,000,000 in cash on hand.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": ["English edition 1988 in grey box", "English first edition 1982", "English fourth edition 2004 with Canada and Mexico", "English revised fifth edition 2008", "English second edition 1984", "English third edition 1996", "English third edition 1999 with 'New Edition Now Contains Mexico'"], "average": "6.92049", "name": "Empire Builder", "playingtime": "180", "boardgamemechanic": ["Action / Movement Programming", "Area Enclosure", "Crayon Rail System", "Pick-up and Deliver", "Route/Network Building"], "age": "12", "boardgameexpansion": ["30889", "71082", "68119", "124304"], "usersrated": "2488", "boardgameaccessory": ["Empire Builder pewter miniatures", "Empire Builder: Laminated Flat Map"], "boardgamesubdomain": ["Strategy Games"], "boardgamefamily": ["Country: USA", "Empire Builder Rail Games"], "boardgamepodcastepisode": ["BGTG 133 - 100 Great Games, part 2 (with Stephen Glenn and Mark Jackson)", "Episode 31 - Top 50, Picks 40-31", "Ludology Episode 76 - I Like Dice To Roll", "PGGK 033: Empire Builder", "Scythe - Episode 042", "The Vintage Gamer #17: Empire Builder (BG)"]}, "169": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic620883.jpg", "boardgameimplementation": ["Duell"], "poll": [], "boardgamedesigner": ["Reiner Knizia"], "statistics": [], "yearpublished": "1993", "maxplayers": "2", "boardgameartist": ["Pier\u00f4"], "boardgamepublisher": ["ABACUSSPIELE", "Eagle-Gryphon Games", "Ferti", "New Games Order, LLC"], "maxplaytime": "30", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic620883_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "30", "boardgamecategory": ["Card Game", "Sports"], "boardgamehonor": ["1993 Fairplay \u00c0 la carte Winner"], "description": "Experience the thrill of fencing&mdash; board game style!

In a game with this little structure, it's possible for everyone to gang up on one unlucky soul, or for the damage to be fairly evenly spread.  Either way, the last family standing is victorious.<br/><br/>Each player starts with a gang of nine characters. To try to get rid of other gangsters, contracts are played on them. If these contracts are not blocked by anyone, the targeted gangster is placed on the hitlist. As soon as six gangsters are on the hitlist a mobwar is started. This means that, at the start of every turn, the first character on this list is eliminated. This goes on until the list is empty.<br/>Mobwars can also be triggered by cards being played. When no more than the last six or fewer characters are in play a constant mobwar is going on, until only one player has characters left.<br/><br/>In general players take turns clockwise, however, the turn goes to any player who plays a response card and then clockwise mode is resumed with the player next to him/her. Lots of interaction as players play cards to put gangsters on the list, save them, have them replaced, start a Mob War, or stop it...<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": ["ADC Blackfire Czech edition", "Cutting Edge German Edition", "French edition", "Italian Edition", "Mayfair English fifth edition", "Mayfair English first edition", "Mayfair English Fourth Edition", "Mayfair English revised Edition", "Mayfair first edition, second version", "Mayfair Games English Version 1989", "Spielfreaks British First Edition", "Truant German Edition"], "average": "6.11345", "name": "Family Business", "playingtime": "30", "boardgamemechanic": ["Hand Management", "Player Elimination", "Take That"], "age": "8", "boardgameexpansion": ["142452", "151120"], "usersrated": "3416", "boardgamesubdomain": ["Family Games", "Thematic Games"], "boardgamefamily": ["Cities: Chicago (Illinois, USA)", "Country: USA"], "boardgamepodcastepisode": ["Episode 4: Imperial Settlers &amp; Underrated Games", "Family Business", "I've Been Diced! episode 10: Gateway games", "OBG 107: Kickstart My Heart", "The Spiel #76 - A Kind Word &amp; A Gun"]}, "171": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic260745.jpg", "boardgameimplementation": ["3 Man Chess", "Archchess", "Chess 2: The Sequel", "Chess Empire", "Chesstique", "Heretik Chess", "Intrachange", "Rogue Chess", "Seizer's Chess", "Yamie Chess"], "poll": [], "boardgamedesigner": ["(Uncredited)"], "statistics": [], "boardgamecompilation": ["Ancient Conflict Treasure Chest", "Apocalypse Pack", "The Boardgame Book", "Chess Empire", "Giant 30 Game Cube", "Miscellaneous Game Compilation", "Pirates of the Caribbean Dead Man's Chest: 3 in 1 Pirate Games Collector's Edition", "Seizer's Chess"], "yearpublished": "1475", "maxplayers": "2", "boardgameartist": ["(Uncredited)", "Paolo Chiari", "Honor\u00e9 Daumier", "F.

Opposing pieces, traditionally designated White and Black, are initially lined up on either side. Each type of piece has a unique form of movement and capturing occurs when a piece, via its movement, occupies the square of an opposing piece. Players take turns moving one of their pieces in an attempt to capture, attack, defend, or develop their positions. Chess games can end in checkmate, resignation, or one of several types of draws. Chess is one of the most popular games in the world, played by millions of people worldwide at home, in clubs, online, by correspondence, and in tournaments. Between two highly skilled players, chess can be a beautiful thing to watch, and a game can provide great entertainment even for novices. There is also a large literature of books and periodicals about chess, typicially featuring games and commentary by chess masters.<br/><br/>The current form of the game emerged in Southern Europe during the second half of the 15th century after evolving from a similar, much older game of Indian origin. The tradition of organized competitive chess began in the 16th century. The first official World Chess Champion, Wilhelm Steinitz, claimed his title in 1886. The current World Champion is Magnus Carlsen, Norway. Chess is also a recognized sport of the International Olympic Committee.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": ["3M Bookshelf edition 1970", "3M Gray Box Bookshelf edition", "Adams & Shardlow edition 1941", "Air France Promotional edition 1970", "Athol edition 1978", "Bar-Zim edition", "Bar-Zim edition", "Bar-Zim edition 1967", "Berwick Presentation edition", "Big League Promotions Chicago edition", "Big League Promotions edition 2002", "Big League Promotions New York edition", "Blatz Blue edition", "Bozart Toys edition", "Cardinal Classic Games Series edition 2007", "Cardinal edition", "Cardinal edition 1979", "Cardinal edition 1997", "Cardinal Simpsons Metal Tin edition 2005", "\u00e0 la carte AG edition 1999", "CCI India Travel edition", "Chad Valley British edition", "Chad Valley British edition", "Chad Valley Green Box edition", "Chad Valley Superior Quality edition", "Chad Valley Superior Quality edition", "Challenge Master edition", "Character Games Collector's edition 2005", "Character Games edition 2002", "Character Games Looney Tunes edition", "Character Games Simpsons edition", "Childrens Press Learn To Play Edition", "Classic Games Edition II Napoleon Bonaparte edition", "Coca-Cola Promotional Edition", "Collector's Edition", "Creative Educational Aids English edition", "Crisloid edition", "DeAgostini Greek Battle of Camelot edition", "DeAgostini Star Wars edition", "Donauturm edition", "Dourios Greek pocket edition 1995", "Dragon and Knight Medieval Chess", "Dreamworks edition 2007", "Drueke First edition", "Drueke First edition", "Drueke Players' Choice Standard Edition", "Dutch Travel edition", "Dynamic edition", "E.S.

But once its basic rules are understood, Go shows its staggering depth. One can see why many people say it's one of the most elegant brain-burning abstract games in history, with players trying to claim territory by walling off sections of the board and surrounding each other's stones.  The game doesn't end until the board fills up, or, more often, when both players agree to end it, at which time whoever controls the most territory wins.<br/><br/>The earliest mention of Go (\u570d\u68cb (w&eacute;i q&iacute;)- &quot;surrounding game&quot;) appears in the &quot;Analects&quot; of Confucius (551-479 BC), while the earliest physical evidence is a 17&times;17 Go board discovered in 1952 in a tomb of the former Han dynasty (206 BC- 9 AD). There is a tangle of conflicting popular and scholarly anecdotes attributing its invention to two Chinese emperors, an imperial vassal and court astrologers. One story has it that Go was invented by the legendary Emperor Yao (ruled 2357-2256 BC) as an amusement for his idiot son. A second claims that the Emperor Shun (ruled 2255-2205 BC) created the game in hopes of improving his weak-minded son's mental prowess. A third says the person named Wu, a vassal of the Emperor Jie (ruled 1818-1766 BC), invented Go (as well as games of cards). Finally, a fourth story suggests that Go was developed by court astrologers during the Zhou dynasty (1045-255 BC).<br/><br/>A Go set, consisting of a very general-purpose grid and colored stones, can also be used to play a variety of other abstract strategy games, such as  Connect6, Go-Moku, Pente, and others.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": ["3M Bookshelf Edition", "Alga Orange Spotted Robe Edition", "Ariel British Edition", "Avalon Hill Bookshelf edition", "Barnes and Noble English edition", "Borras Red Edition", "Carlton second edition by Matthew Macfadyen", "Cathay Magnetic edition", "Cayro Juegos Spanish edition", "Crisloid Mounted Samurai Edition", "Drueke Intellectual Edition", "Dujardin French Edition", "Dynamic Games Edition 1974", "E.S.

Actions include accusing other politicians of espionage (potentially exiling them to Siberia), pardoning them, reshuffling the politburo and others. But each action a politician takes lets him (or in one case, her) age by one or more years. Once a turn each politburo member must face a health roll which can result in sickness marker or even instant death (the older, the most likely). At the end of each turn, the reigning head of state must wave to the crowd at the October parade without collapsing (which gets harder the sicker the politician is). A politician who succeeds in this three times makes the player who controls him/her the winner.<br/><br/>The original Fata Morgana edition included rules requiring the players to hold funeral speeches for deceased party chairmen and drinking vodka with it, for instance. The later Avalon Hill edition scrapped these rules and gave the game a less satirical and more serious tone.<br/><br/>The Jolly Roger edition provides three different KREMLIN games in one box:<br/><br/>1: The 'original' with fictional politicians, set in a USSR where KGB investigations send those found guilty to Siberia. This version will have victory conditions based on the original Fata Morgana rules.<br/><br/>2: A version inspired by the Avalon Hill variant titled 'Revolution'. Set in the 1920s, it uses historical politicians as well as fictional politicians. It's a more violent game as those arrested by the KGB are shot and removed from the game<br/><br/>3: A new version, set in the modern USSR and Russia, an era of entrenched bureaucracy and alternatives for escaping KGB persecution. This version introduces the concept of &quot;Going into Exile&quot; to avoid Siberia. It also includes modern politicians from the 1960s onwards, whether it is Kosygin or Putin and Gorbachev.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "3", "boardgameversion": ["English first edition", "English second edition", "English third edition", "German first edition", "Japanese first edition"], "average": "6.99156", "name": "Kremlin", "playingtime": "75", "boardgamemechanic": ["Secret Unit Deployment", "Voting"], "age": "12", "boardgameexpansion": ["64895", "1685"], "usersrated": "2465", "boardgamesubdomain": ["Strategy Games", "Thematic Games"], "boardgamefamily": ["Country: Russia", "Country: Soviet Union", "Crowdfunding: Kickstarter"], "boardgamepodcastepisode": ["Episode 19: Orleans Review - Boards Alive Interview - Free Games", "ET118: R O R - Rancio Octubre Rojo"]}, "197": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic122523.jpg", "poll": [], "boardgamedesigner": ["James Kyle"], "statistics": [], "yearpublished": "1999", "maxplayers": "4", "boardgameartist": ["Angelo Porazzi"], "boardgamepublisher": ["Giochi Rari", "Glastyn Games"], "maxplaytime": "75", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic122523_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "75", "boardgamecategory": ["Card Game", "Trains", "Transportation"], "description": "Based on Dante's Inferno, HellRail: 2nd Perdition has players creating rail to deliver the souls of the damned to the appropriate circles of Hell.

Individual pieces of a set are worthless at game's end, but are able to be sold during the course of the game in order to provide a cash-flow.<br/><br/>These 'properties' are represented on cards. There are 12 different types of properties, varying from 3 - 6 pieces per set. Naturally, the sets containing six pieces are much more valuable than the sets containing only three pieces as it is much more difficult to complete these larger sets.<br/><br/>Each player is dealt six cards and given a starting 'fund' of $2,000. The top 'property' card is revealed and a bidding ensues. The winner pays the bank and takes the card into his hand. The player then has the option of selling 1 - 3 properties to the bank. The idea here is to rid yourself of properties that you do not wish to collect and provide a source of income.<br/><br/>There is danger, however. The sales price is determined randomly via the roll of two dice. The price can vary from 25% - 100% of the listed worth of the item. Further, if a '0' is rolled on one of the dice, then the item is NOT sold outright, but rather an auction takes place amongst the players. This can result in a substantially reduced price to the seller, or a higher price, depending upon the demand for the item. Further, it is quite possible that no one desires the item, so the seller must take the item back into his hand. There is also the possibility that the player will earn a $200 bonus if the proper digit is rolled on one of the dice.<br/><br/>When a property is sold, it is placed on the appropriate section of the 'board' - 25%, 50%, 75%, or 100% (there really isn't a board, just a card holder that indicates these sections). After a player sells properties, he may surrender one of the special 'buyer' cards and purchase from 1 - 3 cards from one of these markets. The player must pay the indicated price (based on the particular percentage market where the property is located) and take the property into his hand.<br/><br/>Again, there is a decision to be made here. Buyer cards are very valuable, as they can be used in a number of fashions:<br/><br/>1) Purchase properties, as described above;<br/><br/>2) Used as a 'wild' card to complete a set; or<br/><br/>3) Valued as $500.00 at the end of the game.<br/><br/>So, a player has to weigh the advantages of each of these options and play accordingly.<br/><br/>Buyer cards are purchases at auction in conjunction with a property card. When a Buyer card is revealed, another card is then revealed, and both cards are then auctioned together. The auction is a 'sealed' auction, however, so the stakes are often high as these cards carry tremendous advantages.<br/><br/>The game continues in this fashion until the property deck expires or a player calls an end to the game. One can only do this, however, if he has a total value (property sets plus cash) in excess of $5,000. Even then, a player should only do this when he feels he has more assets than any of his opponents.<br/><br/>As High Bid, this game was published for the 3M Bookshelf Series and 3M Gamette Series.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": ["3M bookcase edition 1965", "3M Bookcase First Edition", "3M Bookshelf Edition 1975", "3M Bookshelf Test Marketing Edition", "3M Gamette edition 1967", "3M Gamette edition 1970", "3M oversized gamette edition", "Avalon Hill edition", "Avalon Hill edition 1977", "Casper/Target Games AB Swedish edition"], "average": "5.79214", "name": "High-Bid", "playingtime": "25", "boardgamemechanic": ["Auction/Bidding", "Set Collection"], "age": "12", "usersrated": "229", "boardgamesubdomain": ["Family Games", "Strategy Games"], "boardgamefamily": ["3M Bookshelf Series", "3M Gamettes"]}, "219": {"boardgamedesigner": ["Stefan Dorra"], "average": "6.20346", "poll": [], "name": "Volle H\u00fctte", "playingtime": "30", "minplayers": "3", "boardgamemechanic": ["Hand Management", "Tile Placement"], "yearpublished": "1997", "usersrated": "159", "maxplayers": "5", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1300663_t.jpg", "boardgameartist": ["Wilfried Gebhard"], "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["ASS Altenburger Spielkarten"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1300663.jpg", "boardgameversion": ["First edition"], "maxplaytime": "30", "boardgamecategory": ["Economic"], "age": "12", "minplaytime": "30", "description": "Players take on the role of club-owners vying for customers' Deutsch Marks in this unique board game, called Full House in German.<br/><br/>Each player is given a small board representing their cafe or pub. In your turn, you can either place a tile in your pub, representing different types of seating (bar, patio, formal) &amp; activities (dancing, shooting pool, playing fooseball), or you can select a customer card, to draw in customers to those specific tiles, if you have the seating available. A third choice is to take a Billing card, which gives you a tip in cash money, and makes all customers in all the players bars pay their bills too. Yellow customers are worth 10 DM, red 20 DM and blue customers pay 30 DM.<br/><br/>When there are at least ten customers floating around, players can also spend a Action card which moves customers around. The cards either move off a specific tile type to a type you choose, or from a tile type you choose to a specific tile. So you might move customers specifically from the terrace seating to any other type of your choice (such as the disco floor), or from a tile of your choice (such as the bar) to specifically a Pool Table. The cards allow from 1-4 customers to move, depending on the tiles.<br/><br/>This is the clever part. As the customers move, they normally pay their bill, unless the Action card shows a No Pay symbol, making them bill-dodgers. When customers move, they first look for a suitable spot within the same pub! Only if they can't find one (either it lacks that type of tile, or there isn't enough room to accommodate them), do they then start wandering clockwise to the next pub, and keep going until they find a suitable spot. If they can't, they leave the game.<br/><br/>So if you have an Action card that pays a bill, and you have the right empty spaces in your bar (because you've carefully put in a variety of attractions), you move your customers around inside your bar and collect the money (&quot;Hey, we're paying our bar tab now, we're gonna shoot some Pool&quot;). If you have a suitable Action card with a No Pay symbol, you move customers from another player's bar into yours (&quot;This place stinks guys, let's skip out and find a Fooseball!&quot;). It is this clever management of customers that will net you big profits.<br/><br/>And if your bar is pretty full, especially with blue and red customers, you call a billing as your first action. The other players also collect, but you should have a margin on them, plus the tip (from 30-70 DM).<br/><br/>There are always three Customer cards and three Action cards face up, and two fresh tiles, so you should be able to make good choices and plan ahead a little. The game ends when the Action cards or the Billing cards are exhausted.<br/><br/>The winner is the player with the most money, having milked the punters as much as possible.<br/><br/>"}, "220": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1513386.jpg", "poll": [], "boardgamedesigner": ["Reiner Knizia"], "statistics": [], "yearpublished": "1995", "maxplayers": "5", "boardgameartist": ["Mateusz Bielski", "Wesly Gibs", "Alvin Madden", "Ulf Marckwort", "Paul Niemeyer", "Bj\u00f6rn Pertoft", "Markus Wagner"], "boardgamepublisher": ["AMIGO Spiel + Freizeit GmbH", "Eagle-Gryphon Games", "Foxgames (Poland)", "Kanga Games", "Ravensburger Spieleverlag GmbH", "\u00dcberplay", "University Games", "Wargames Club Publishing"], "maxplaytime": "30", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1513386_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "15", "boardgamecategory": ["Card Game"], "boardgamehonor": ["1995 Fairplay \u00c0 la carte Winner"], "description": "In Reiner Knizia's High Society, players bid against each other to acquire the various trappings of wealth (positive-number and multiplier cards) while avoiding its pitfalls (negative number and divisor cards).

The game is played out over 7 epochs or rounds, from the ancient 3000 B.C. Sumerians to the pre-WW1 Germany, with every player controlling a new rising empire from history.  Some empires are stronger than others (like the Romans), but the game's clever mechanisms can help balance that out.  At the end of each epoch, players score points for all units of their color (from both the current and any previous empires) remaining on the board.<br/><br/>Gameplay:  Each player selects a color and takes all pieces of that color, as there are different miniatures for each of the 7 Epochs, these should be sorted by Epoch.  The game board is a stylized version of the globe.  The Event cards should be separated into Greater and Lesser Events.  Each player is dealt 3 Greater Events. These are either Minor Empires, Leaders, Weaponry or Reallocation.  Each player is also dealt 7 Lesser Events.  There are 22 different types of Lesser Events (Disasters, Diseases, and Special abilities, to name a few).  Players roll 2 dice and determine first player and begin drawing their first Epoch empires.  One unique mechanism is that the drawing player can examine their drawn empire and decide whether to keep it for themselves or give it to another player who hasn't gotten one yet.  If it is given to another player, the receiving player has no choice but to keep it for himself to play that Epoch.  Then the next player draws and makes his decision.  The player who gives their drawn Empire has to wait until given an empire by another player or until the last player draws.  Each Empire card contains the Empire name, how many troops the Empire has for expansion, the Empire's starting land space, if it has a Capitol or not (barbarian or nomadic nations frequently do not) and if it has any Navigation (Seas and Oceans to travel by).  One player reads out the Epochs Empires in order and turns are taken, in this roughly historical order, when a player's Empire is called.<br/><br/>Before the start of their turn a player may play up to two Event cards from their hand.  The Events played are resolved before the player starts his Empire's actions.  If the player's active Empire has navigation a ship token is placed in each sea or ocean listed (if an ocean is listed all adjacent seas to the ocean have ship markers put into them).  A Reallocation Greater Event allows an Empire with Navigation to exchange Fleets in seas and oceans for Coins that can be used to buy back defeated troops (1 coin per troop).  If the active Empire has a capitol it is taken and placed in the Empire's starting land with one unit of the Empire's available troops.<br/><br/>Since each land space may only contain one troop the player begins expanding from their starting land by placing troops in any adjacent land space that they wish to occupy or conquer.  To conquer a land the attacker moves one unit into the land space either from adjacent land or through a sea with a ship in it.  Then dice are rolled, the attacker gets 2 dice and the defender only one, unless the attacker traveled across a strait or the defender's land has either a forest, the great wall of China, or mountains on the border of the land that the attacker came from.  In this case the defender receives 2 dice as well.  If the attack comes from the sea the defender gets 3 dice for defense.  Highest score wins with ties killing off both the defender and attacker.  In this case the attacker can merely place the next troop, if he has any left, in the now-empty land space.<br/><br/>At any time the active Empire player may exchange an unplaced troop for a fort.  On later turns, a fort gives the player a +1 to defensive rolls in that land.  Also, if the defender in a fort loses or ties with an attacker only the fort is removed and the battle continues.  Whenever an army conquers a land with a capitol the capitol mini is flipped reducing it to a city (if it was a city to begin with it is removed from board when conquered).  After the active player's Empire is finished with it's actions check to see if it conquered to land spaces with resource symbols, if so it can build a monument.<br/><br/>Then scoring takes place.  Each area (Middle-East, Northern Europe, Eurasia, etc...) has a tile with 3 values for the current Epoch.  One value is for having a presence in the area (at least one land).  Another value is for having Dominance in the area (at least 2 lands and more than any other player in area). The last value is for having Control of an area (at least 3 lands and no other player has any in area).  These values vary from Epoch to Epoch and Area to Area (Middle-East is more valuable in early Epochs and fades in later Epochs, for example).  Total the scores from each area for all pieces of the player's color from all Empires controlled that remain on board.  Then add 2 points for each capitol controlled, 1 point per city and one point for each monument controlled. After all areas are scored the next Empire called takes its turn.<br/><br/>After all players have taken their turns and scored, for the first Epoch, the player with the highest score gets to take a pre-eminence marker and places it in front of him.  These are secret bonus points (worth somewhere from 3 to 6) for the end of the game and may not be examined till then.  This bonus to leader helps balance the Empire-draw mechanic and makes it valuable to score maximal points even early in the game, rather than tanking to get a better draw later. Then drawing begins for the next Epoch with the player having the lowest score drawing first on up to the person with the highest score drawing last (and likely being given a less than optimal Empire by another player).<br/><br/>Victory: After the last player has scored for Epoch 7 and the leader has drawn a pre-eminence marker, all players reveal their pre-eminence markers and add them to their scores.  The player with the highest score wins.<br/><br/><br/>Online Play<br/><br/><br/>    <a target='_blank' href='http://gamesbyemail.com' rel='nofollow'>http://gamesbyemail.com</a> (English, turn-based)<br/><br/><br/>", "minplayers": "3", "boardgameversion": ["Avalon Hill edition", "Avalon Hill/Hasbro edition", "Compendium Games Dutch edition", "Compendium Games English edition 1992", "Gibsons Games edition", "Ragnar Brothers First edition", "Welt der Spiele German edition"], "name": "History of the World", "videogamebg": ["History of the World"], "playingtime": "180", "boardgamemechanic": ["Area Control / Area Influence", "Dice Rolling", "Hand Management"], "age": "12", "usersrated": "3973", "boardgamesubdomain": ["Strategy Games", "Thematic Games"], "average": "7.12978", "boardgamepodcastepisode": ["Episode 21: Above and Below Review - Kevin Wilson Interview", "I\u2019ve Been Diced! episode 52: Steve Kendall of Ragnar Brothers", "Show # 9: History of the World -and- Pizza Box Football"]}, "225": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2038742.jpg", "poll": [], "boardgamedesigner": ["John Cooper", "Andrew Looney"], "statistics": [], "boardgamecompilation": ["Playing With Pyramids"], "yearpublished": "1989", "maxplayers": "5", "boardgamepublisher": ["Crystal Caste", "IcehouseGames", "Looney Labs"], "maxplaytime": "20", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2038742_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "20", "boardgamecategory": ["Abstract Strategy", "Game System", "Real-time"], "description": "This is the game that introduced Icehouse Pieces.

The Mediterranean was a sea of great prosperity - the only route between East and West. The greatest fleets of the age battled for the most lucrative trade routes.<br/><br/>Trade cities like Venice, Genoa, Barcelona or Istanbul grew as powerful as whole nations, establishing trade routes as far as North Africa or Middle East, bringing back Spice, Gems or Gold to the western Mediterranean. SERENISSIMA recreates this era, when the Mediterranean was at the centre of world trade.<br/><br/>The Game<br/><br/>Each players assume the role of one of those four city-states. Their goal is to establish their sphere of influence in the Mediterranean, and share all sorts of commodities to make their trading empire the most prosperous. In the course of a game, players must build galleys, hire crew and buy/sell commodities. The value of goods can be influenced by players having monopolies in certain commodities. Players can also take control of ports, thereby earning extra income from players using the port, as well as being able to get this port's specific commodity.<br/><br/>In the end, the scoring is based on the number of ports each player control, but also on the fact that those ports have commodities of different kind available. Ports come in three types : small, medium, and city-states. Whereas small ports are quite easy to satisfy (they need only two commodities to be considered &quot;full&quot;), the four starting city-states are far more difficult to please, as they will need all kind of commodities available (6 additional commodities, plus the one they produce).<br/><br/>During the course of the game, the number and type of commodities available in ports also controls the number of crew members you can hire, if you can build galleys or forts, and the price of commodities when you sell them. For example, a player won't be able to build new galleys until they have wood and iron available in one of the ports they control. Once a galley has been built, it has 5 spaces available, that can be filled by the crew or the goods. Every crew member allows movement through one space, and makes the galley more powerful. But those spaces are also needed to carry the goods that are worth money. Money that can be used to hire new crews, build new galleys, or commodities. A balance thus needs to be struck between trading commodities and taking control of ports - between a fleet of merchant galleys and a fleet of warships.<br/><br/>The game lasts between 5 to 8 turns depending on the number of active players. Turn order is defined by bidding. The winner of the bid choose whether he will play first, second, third or last. Depending on the situation and what the player wants to do, playing first or last might be equally interesting. For example, by playing first, a player would be unable to react to other players move, but he could avoid having his galleys blockaded.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": ["Dutch edition", "English edition", "French edition", "German edition", "German edition with DSP logo", "Italian edition"], "average": "6.89065", "name": "Serenissima (first edition)", "playingtime": "120", "boardgamemechanic": ["Pick-up and Deliver", "Trading"], "age": "12", "usersrated": "2096", "boardgamesubdomain": ["Strategy Games"], "boardgamefamily": ["Cities: Barcelona (Spain)", "Cities: Genova", "Cities: Marseille", "Cities: Naples", "Cities: Venice"]}, "234": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic188579.jpg", "boardgameimplementation": ["Hannibal & Hamilcar: Rome vs Carthage"], "poll": [], "boardgamedesigner": ["Mark Simonitch"], "statistics": [], "yearpublished": "1996", "maxplayers": "2", "boardgameartist": ["Joe Amoral", "Mike Doyle (I)", "Rick Gondeck", "Pawe\u0142 Kaczmarczyk", "Kurt Miller", "Mark Simonitch", "Rafal Szymanski", "Piotr S\u0142aby"], "boardgamepublisher": ["Valley Games, Inc.", "The Avalon Hill Game Co", "Descartes Editeur", "Smart Ltd"], "maxplaytime": "200", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic188579_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "40", "boardgamecategory": ["Ancient", "Political", "Wargame"], "boardgamehonor": ["2008 Golden Geek Best 2-Player Board Game Nominee", "2008 Golden Geek Best 2-Player Board Game Winner", "2008 Golden Geek Best Wargame Nominee", "2008 Golden Geek Best Wargame Winner", "2008 JoTa Best 2-Player Board Game Nominee", "2008 JoTa Best Wargame Nominee"], "description": "This game uses the very popular card system which first appeared in Avalon Hill's We the People game to detail the struggle between Carthage's Hannibal and the Roman Republic in approximately 200 BC.<br/><br/>Hannibal: Rome vs. Carthage is an asymmetrical card driven game for 2 players set in times of epic struggle between ancient Rome and Carthage.

Each player becomes one or more pirates and attempts to amass a fortune and retire before a King's Commissioner tracks him down, a Warship stumbles across him, or his own crew cuts his throat! Merchant ships plying the trade routes are the targets. Prizes range from near-worthless supplies to the fabulous Spanish and Mogul treasure ships. Luck, skill and cunning all play a part as you comb the Seven Seas (well ... at least three of them) for fame and fortune. Players should be aware that the game simulates 18th century piracy and therefore features random happenstance. Little can be planned. Players who are ready to strike when opportunity presents itself and are wily and aggressive without being rash will fare best in the long run.<br/><br/><br/>Players take up the roles of famous pirates navigating the major sea lanes during the golden age of piracy.  Plunder and pirateering await as each player moves about on the map in a variable system through a deck of cards.  Rather than the normal turn order in games, players move when their designation is drawn in a deck.  When not in the role of their pirate they can take on the role of one of the English military ships hunting the sea for pirates.  By making shrewd choices and having some luck the player can end the game a wealthy and retired pirate with a large fleet of ships that have been accumulated over the years.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "1", "boardgameversion": ["Avalon Hill English Edition", "Descartes French Edition"], "average": "6.34805", "name": "Blackbeard", "playingtime": "180", "boardgamemechanic": ["Hex-and-Counter", "Variable Player Powers"], "age": "12", "usersrated": "1269", "boardgamesubdomain": ["Thematic Games", "Wargames"], "boardgamefamily": ["Solitaire Games", "Solitaire Wargames"], "boardgamepodcastepisode": ["ET60: Ferrocarriles Pampas Yarrrr!!!

A president for life (El Presidente) is elected and then she or he allocates roles for all other players.  Depending upon his or her office and the various cards they hold, each player has a certain number of votes. These are important for the first vote to elect El Presidente and then there are votes each turn on the budget proposed by the President. The budget starts when the President draws 8 money cards face down from the money deck (which varies in denomination from $1 to $3) and proposes allocations. Not everyone will be included in the budget and the amounts are at the President's discretion. The President can keep undisclosed foreign aid money.<br/><br/>Players may attempt to assassinate the other players including the President by guessing where they will be from among five locations. Players who successfully assassinate another player take that player's unbanked money, the only safe money is the money that has been deposited in a players' Swiss bank account, and the only way to get to the bank is to survive the assassination round.<br/><br/>If players are unhappy, see an advantage, or just want to, and there is a 'coup excuse', they can start a coup. A coup sees players compete using armed forces to control a majority of the 5 power centers. Rebel players control the forces of the role which they were assigned prior to the coup  (e.g. army, navy, air force), and players loyal to the President do the same, seeking to control the strongholds until the coup is over. At the conclusion of each coup players who have control of the 5 power centres vote to be pro-President or pro-Junta determining if the President stays, or the Junta wins and elects a new President.

Players vie for dominance of early 19th Century Europe. As the French player, you'll set Napoleon and his armies upon a continent whose differing political statures plays right into your hands. The greatest army in Europe is at your hands...<br/><br/>Divide and conquer! As the British player, you'll utilize diplomacy, clever event play, a powerhouse economy and the greatest navy in the world to become the dominant nation. As Russia, Austria, Prussia, Spain or the Ottoman Empire, you must strike a balance between expansionist aggression and diplomatic harmony among your neighbors. Indeed, a nation must expand to triumph. However the means chosen to that end will largely decide the level of success. Play  the part of being everyone's friend and your nation will likely live in relative safety...and lose the game miserably. Play the part of the blind aggressor and you'll likely go down faster than the peace broker. Striking a balance is critical.<br/><br/>The game map covers the territories from Scandinavia in the north to the Mediterranean and North Africa in the south, and from deep Russia in the east to Portugal and the Atlantic in the west. Movement is by areas (provinces) on land, and sea zones at sea. On land, the units of maneuver are (roughly) corps, while at sea each unit represents a naval squadron. When opposing land armies meet for battle, corps are broken down into divisions (loosely) and deployed on a eight zone battle map for combat resolution. The dice-less combat engine uses a system of battle options which are played and cross-referenced for resolution of actual casualties and morale loss. The number of battle options distributed, along with the initial army morale of the opposing sides, is determined by army size, nationality and leaders present. The battle options are of offensive and defensive nature. The offensive options cover standard maneuvers such as &quot;Flank Attack&quot;, &quot;Cavalry Charge&quot; and &quot;Assault&quot;, while the defensive options are things such as &quot;Refuse Flanks&quot;, &quot;Squares Formed&quot; and &quot;Reverse Slopes&quot;.<br/><br/>The rules are relatively simple and fast moving, even though a host of subtleties and complexities of the Napoleonic period are represented within the game system. The means by which this relative simplicity was achieved was (largely) through the use of self-explanatory strategic event charts. Be warned: This game is easy to understand and play, but very difficult to master.<br/><br/>The game system works the same whether you're playing with two players or seven. With multiple players, you'll need all of your diplomacy skills to enlist aid in achieving your goals. With fewer players, the event charts will handle the bulk of the diplomatic duties. Regardless of how many players you have, all seven major powers will actively participate to a greater or lesser degree.<br/><br/>"}, "277": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1101876.jpg", "boardgameimplementation": ["Res Publica: 2230AD"], "poll": [], "boardgamedesigner": ["Reiner Knizia"], "statistics": [], "yearpublished": "1991", "maxplayers": "5", "boardgameartist": ["Peggy Coleman", "Marko Fiedler", "Jo Hartwig", "Howard David Johnson", "Claus Stephan"], "boardgamepublisher": ["Queen Games", "Avalanche Press Ltd.", "Hexagames (I)"], "maxplaytime": "60", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1101876_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "30", "boardgamecategory": ["Card Game", "Civilization"], "boardgamehonor": ["1991 Fairplay \u00c0 la carte Winner", "1998 Fairplay \u00c0 la carte Winner"], "description": "In Res Publica you are the will of the people, guiding five ancient civilizations to greater heights of power and technology.<br/><br/>Each turn, the active player makes a trade offer... and each player in turn responds in kind.

In the box are fourteen games themed on ancient Rome. The games are themed to cover, albeit in a highly abstract fashion, the rise of Rome, the Roman Republic and finally, the Empire.<br/><br/>(7 of the games are described below)<br/><br/>The Wheel of History : 2-5 players<br/><br/>This is an early version of what was to become Bunte Runde. 25 cards are laid out in a large circle, representing the tribes to be united under early Rome. Players may advance a pawn one, two or three spaces forwards and collect a card. Cards are scored on face value, but there are some quirks that vary this.<br/><br/>The Seven Hills of Rome : 2 players<br/><br/>This is one of the easier games in the compendium. The theme here is you are battling your opponent for control of the seven hills of Rome. The hills are represented by seven cards, numbered 1 to 7, laid out between the players. Cards are played from a hand against the 'hills' in an attempt to influence them to your side. You sum the hills you control at the end of the game, and the highest total wins.<br/><br/>Mercator : 3-7 players<br/><br/>This game is Medici's ancestor. It is a simplified version of Medici, with the chief differences being you can hold six cards on your ship, and you are competing for highest value totals only. The number of each suit taken is meaningless, except in a variant where you get paid a bonus if you get one of each. The game lasts only one round. Medici is worth purchasing on its own, but this is still worth a look.<br/><br/>Imperium : 3-5 players<br/><br/>The aim is to earn points for control of each of the 9 areas on the board. The game lasts 9 turns, and at the end of each turn, the area matching the turn number is evaluated for control and points are awarded. On your turn, 3 cards are revealed simultaneously. These cards are numbered 1 to 9, with 2 additional banner cards. The numbers correspond to the areas you want to place control markers into. The banner cards indicate you want one or two extra chips placed in the indicated area. After control markers are placed, the current turn's area is evaluated - points being awarded to the winner and perhaps the second and third places as well. After 9 turns, the player with the most points wins. As you progress, the points awarded for each area increases, giving a nice feeling of acceleration.<br/><br/>Senator : 2-3 players<br/><br/>You play a Roman faction trying to position your people (a hand of cards) into the senate. They can only get their via the senate steps. The board is a grid of 5x5 spaces, The 9 spaces in the center are the senate, while 12 of the remaining 16 are the steps spaces that run around the perimeter of the senate. Cards are placed initially on the steps, and then pushed into the senate by placing more cards on the steps.<br/><br/>Circus Maximus : 3-5 players<br/><br/>A simple chariot racing game where players are competing to be the first to get their team of three chariots around the hex map circuit and onto the podium. Each player has a set of cards face up in front of them, numbered 1 to 5. To move a chariot they select up to three cards per chariot which that is the movement allowance for that piece. The movement off each card must be in a straight line, so some rather clumsy cornering ability is built into the game. Cards used by a chariot are turned face down, becoming unavailable for the other chariots still to move. Each chariot must be moved at least once per turn, if possible. Therefore, the trick is to maximize your movement with your 15 points each turn.<br/><br/>Consul : 2-4 players<br/><br/>This is an intriguing memory game, that, like most of the games in this compendium, have a hard time being fitted into a theme! Twenty-five cards are turned face down in a grid. Players start the game each holding three cards in their hand. On their turn, players make a bid to take a turn. The highest bid gets to turn up cards until they choose to finish, or make a mistake. Cards in a set can be of the same value, or same color, or both. The value of the set must equal of exceed the bid made, simply by summing the face values of the cards. If a mistake is made, the cards are turned face down, and the player must discard a card from their hand into the grid. If the bid is made, the cards are taken into the players hand. At the end of the game, the highest total held wins.<br/><br/>--<br/><br/>Translated rulebook to the contrary, this game has never been published by an English publisher.<br/><br/>Note: 3 of these have been printed/repackaged in English by GMT in Rome: Imperium, Circus Maximus, Hannibal vs Rome<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": ["German first edition", "Japanese second edition"], "average": "6.81829", "name": "Neue Spiele im alten Rom", "playingtime": "0", "age": "10", "usersrated": "175", "boardgamesubdomain": ["Abstract Games"], "boardgamefamily": ["Ancient Rome"]}, "281": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1851288.jpg", "poll": [], "boardgamedesigner": ["Dan Glimne"], "statistics": [], "yearpublished": "1991", "maxplayers": "5", "boardgameartist": ["Jacob H\u00e4gg", "Ann-Marie Hedstr\u00f6m"], "boardgamepublisher": ["G&RRR"], "maxplaytime": "0", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1851288_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "0", "boardgamecategory": ["Economic", "Nautical"], "boardgamehonor": ["1992 \u00c5rets Spel Best Family Game Winner"], "description": "from the translation:<br/>The Swedish East India Company loaded their ships in G&ouml;teborg with Swedish export goods.

The odd combination of mechanisms is a bit tricky to grasp at first, but soon reveals a nice contest. There are various ships in different colors marked on the board and players are dealt 3 random cards to show a share in three of the ships. Also on the board are treasure chests with rising values, and colored markers for each ship move from chest to chest, showing the worth of that vessel. Players begin with cash, 3 Smithy &amp; 3 Trade card, and some lucky horseshoes that they keep on a rack hidden from the other players. These are variously numbered and two dice are rolled at each turn to provide the lucky number.<br/><br/>As the Flying Dutchman sails the seven seas, it can either move onto islands or the ships. If it is moved onto a ship, players reveal if they are share holders and pay the current value back to the bank as its marker is moved down to zero. On your turn, you can opt to use your Trade card to exchange 2 of your share cards, effectively dodging the Dutchman's threat. Or you can play a Smithy card, to allow you to take horseshoes at the end of the turn. But mainly you can attempt to control the Dutchman's move, by secretly laying down horseshoes to match the lucky number, the closest winning control. A nice rule, if there's a tie, the players are meant to try to agree, then barter, and finally compete with more horseshoes (all to the benefit of the Smithy card players!). Played horseshoes are pooled until Smithies divy them up.<br/><br/>If the Dutchman is moved to an island, the controlling players reveal a share card and take the value of that ship from the bank. The round ends with all the chest markers moving up once, including a black marker, which ends the game when it reaches the highest chest. Players reveal their share cards and take the final value on the chests, most money wins.<br/><br/>Puzzling to begin with, but you quickly realize whether your shares are under threat from a Dutchman's move, so you either trade out or try to gain control. If you're not under threat, it may be worth use your Smithy to grab the pool of horseshoes. Get your timing right and the whole thing becomes very rewarding.

Since the trains begin their expansion from the easternmost part of the board, the farther west the city, the higher its number value.

(Players may only hold one Branch Line Card in their hands at any one time.)

Players do not control any specific rail line. Each player can place track on any color provided that the played track connects to an existing corresponding rail network on the board.

The name roughly translates to &quot;Tigers Moving&quot;. It is an abstract strategy game with an asymmetric setup, i.e. a different number of pieces per side (like Hnefatafl and its ilk). One opponent plays four tiger pieces and the other plays twenty goats.<br/><br/>The board bears a passing resemblance to a Chinese Chess board in that the pieces move along lines from intersection to intersection. However, the gameplay is more similar to Alquerque, Checkers or Draughts. At the start of the game, there are four tigers on the board while there are no goats. The goat player places his/her pieces on the board one by one wherever they choose, with the tiger player getting a move between each placing. Once all the goats are on the board, the two players take turns moving one of their pieces one space. A tiger can alternatively capture a single goat by jumping over it in a line  to an empty space. The tigers win if they can capture five goats. The goal for the goats (who cannot make captures) is to hem the tigers in, giving them no opportunity to move or jump.<br/><br/>It is one variant from a family of similar Asian games played with varying numbers of tigers/leopards/goats/cows/etc and varying board topologies.<br/>See also Cows and Leopards and Fox and Geese.<br/><br/>Games played on exactly the same board layout (same lines connecting the intersections and same size) include the traditional Spanish Alquerque and Fanoron-Dimy, the smaller variant of Fanorona from Madagascar.

Finally is the '43 scenario.  This is imbalanced in favor of the Soviet player and is essentially Barbarossa in reverse.  It is very, very important that players practice this one.

The game has nothing to do with Monopoly. The name was obviously chosen in an attempt to capitalize on that mega-selling monster.<br/><br/>There are four tracts of land illustrated on the board, which depicts an ocean-front boardwalk. Each tract of land contains five properties valued from $1 million to $8 million. Each turn, a player rolls two regular dice and one special die. The special die has four sides depicting a color matching one of the land tracts, with the other two sides depicting a 'W' and 'F' respectively. The number rolled on the regular two dice is the amount of money the player can spend on development, while the color depicted on the special die is the tract of land he may build on. Thus, if a player rolled an 8 and a red, he has $8 million to spend on developing buildings in the red tract. He can split this $8 million as he sees fit. For example, he may build a building on the $5 million plot and one on the $3 million plot; or he may opt to build one building on the $8 million plot. Quite a few building options here.<br/><br/>If a 'W' was rolled instead of a color, the player may select which tract he wishes to build on. The 'F' means that a player draws a Fortune card and does not build that turn. Fortune cards allow a player to perform a variety of actions, including constructing extra buildings, moving one of his already placed buildings, removing an opponent's building, etc. A player may play one of these Fortune cards per turn.<br/><br/>When a player constructs a building and obtains the most buildings on a particular plot, he takes the deed to that property and moves his token along the boardwalk an amount equal to the value of the deed. If a player wrested control of the deed from an opponent, the opponent is then moved back that number of spaces. Buildings are placed on the board in a fashion identical to that used in Manhattan...they are stacked on top of existing buildings. If there is a tie for the most buildings, the player who built first on that plot possesses the deed.<br/><br/>Some have described this game as 'Manhattan lite', and they're not far off. One certainly has similar thought processes and must constantly keep an eye out for optimum plays which will wrest control of deeds (control of buildings in Manhattan) from opponents. There's another planning element thrown in, too. Certain spaces along the boardwalk are marked with an 'F'. If a player advances his token to one of these locations, he draws a Fortune card. These cards can be extremely powerful and cause a severe swing in deed controls. Thus, it is not always wise to go for the largest deed acquisition if a lesser gain would allow you to move your token onto an 'F' location. Clever.<br/><br/>The game continues until one player has placed all of his buildings (sounds a bit like Rheinl\u00e4nder, doesn't it?) or until one player has reached the end of the boardwalk. The player with the highest total value of deeds is the victor.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": ["Dutch edition", "English edition", "English first edition", "French edition", "German edition", "Italian edition", "Parker Swedish Edition", "Spanish edition"], "name": "Advance to Boardwalk", "playingtime": "60", "boardgamemechanic": ["Area Control / Area Influence", "Dice Rolling", "Hand Management", "Take That"], "average": "5.34258", "usersrated": "631", "boardgamesubdomain": ["Children's Games", "Family Games"], "boardgamefamily": ["Monopoly"]}, "335": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic119969.jpg", "poll": [], "boardgamedesigner": ["Alex Randolph"], "statistics": [], "yearpublished": "1965", "maxplayers": "2", "age": "10", "boardgamepublisher": ["3M", "The Game Crafter, LLC"], "maxplaytime": "15", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic119969_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "15", "boardgamecategory": ["Abstract Strategy", "Nautical"], "description": "Part of the 3M Bookshelf Series.<br/><br/>Breakthru is a modern member of the Hnefatafl family of games, where the players have unequal forces and different objectives.

The deck is one through nine in six suits, with two of each card (two 1s, two 2s, etc.).  After the initial hand of eight is dealt, players select one card value to collect, which is placed face-up in front of each player.  A fairly standard trick-taking game takes place with the remaining cards, with players following suit if they can.  If you cannot, the card you play can be trump, if you desire.  If two cards of the same suit/value appear, the second can be declared as either high or low.  When a player wins a trick, the cards of the same value he's collecting are placed in his 'good' pile, with each worth one point.  All the rest are put in the 'bad' pile, with each worth minus one point.  However at the end of each hand, you can convert one value of cards from your 'bad' pile onto the 'good' pile.

A very nice mechanic makes the money paid for the stock go into that company's coffers.

Players bid with coins in their closed fist. Highest bidder wins, but pays the cost of the second bid! Try to double-think the other players and you'll buy a tile you don't want! The winning condition is good too. You have to finish with more money than you started with.

Now the tradition continues with Express, a unique card game for the 90's. Reminiscent of classic card games but including new play twists, Express is as easy to learn as rummy. Players start with one or two car trains and build on their meld to maximize points and bonuses. But players must be wary of train wrecks and derailments. Unique play allows partners to pass key cards to each other during the game.<br/><br/>The cards represent various train cars, freight, passenger and way, diesel locomotives and disasters.<br/><br/>Cards are shuffled and dealt to each player, and remaining cards form a draw pile.  Turns consist of drawing either two cards from the face down draw pile or one face up card from the discard pile, melding cards from one's hand and discarding a card.  Players must end their turns with no more than five cards in their hands.  Players meld cards to form freight trains or passenger trains, or they meld individual way cars.  Freight trains are melded so that all the cars are of the same type, such as box car, tank car or auto carrier.  However, a wild card car can be used to have two types of cars in the same freight train.  Passenger trains may contain any or all of the different types of passenger cars.  Each train needs a locomotive which can be any card placed face down.  There is a locomotive pictured on the back of each card.  During the melding phase of their turn, players may exchange face down locomotive cards with any card in their hand.  This feature allows partners to share cards when the game is played by four or six.<br/><br/>Disaster cards may be played as discards.  They can change the direction of play, allow theft of an opponent's car or wreck an entire train.  Way car cards either absorb the damage of corresponding disasters or remedy them in a fashion similar to the Coup Fourre' of Mille Bornes.<br/><br/>Hands end when a player or partnership &quot;goes out.&quot;  To do this the player's melds must consist of at least one five car train, one four car train and all other trains must be at least three cars long.  The player then melds all but one card which he discards.  Trains and way cars are scored.  Cards left in players hands count against them.<br/><br/>The game is played in hands until one player or partnership accumulates the points needed to win.

The plastic coated pieces look like Reversi/Othello discs, with black and white faces. Each piece contains a magnet, with the black side being North and the white side being South. Each player gets a stack, one plays black one plays white. A neutral red piece goes in the center of the game cloth and players start by place five each of their stack around the cloth. These flat pieces are the foundations.<br/><br/>On your turn, you take one piece from your stack into your hand, then bring it to bear against one of your foundations. You keep your color face up, so the opposing polarity bears against your foundation piece. This way, you can very carefully balance your new piece in the air against the foundation stone! This is just fantastic to see. The board fills up with lots of discs teetering at 45 degrees, ready to fly about if the balances are upset.<br/><br/>Get it right and your stack is one piece smaller. Make a mistake and  your turn ends. Either a piece falls flat somewhere (becoming a new foundation) or pieces jump together making towers or into your hand. Your opponent takes the tower you accidentally made and places it their side up where they like. Towers get you points at the game end.<br/><br/>If a piece jumps to the stone in your hand, they both go back on your stack. The game ends when one player finishes their stack and points are calculated based upon towers and discs remaining. Causing the red piece to jump to another loses you the game outright.<br/><br/>To be honest, the scoring matters less than the tension and joy of watching the natural but weird force of magnetism at play. Because the discs are discs, they can easily roll around, causing domino effects. Because the towers increase the magnetic pull, they make it so much harder to find a safe spot to play.<br/><br/>If you want a strange fun game to amaze your friends and family, Polarity is hard to beat. If you want a serious 2-player game, you may prefer other abstracts. The rules could do with being shorter and simpler. Otherwise, a joyous game.<br/><br/>Comment from the designer &quot;Polarity began as a sculpture. Polarity is zen. It represents that point where absolute opposites merge. In this case, the poles of the magnetic field. The quality of play is determined by one's ability to perceive balance in the midst of extremes. Each game is unique and can never be reproduced. It is in that uniqueness that I was awarded a patent from the U.S. Pat. &amp; Trdmks. office for magnetic principle. The strategy must be viewed 3-dimensionally.

The board is two-sided, and hurdles are provided so that players can choose flat racing or steeplechases (races with fences that the horses must jump).<br/><br/>Players each have their own deck of 32 movement cards, dice and a horse of their own colour.  Ten cards are randomly selected for each race, with two cards left over which can be drawn for use in any one race.  Cards played in a race are removed from the game.<br/><br/>A round consists of two parts.  First all players simultaneously select a card and move the number on the played card (if able), in position order.  After this, a single pair of dice is rolled by one player (the rolling player rotates throughout the game).  The player rolling the dice decides if all horses move the value of one or both of the dice and all horses move (again in position order).<br/><br/>Like a real horse race, inside position is important.  The game has rules for lane changing, blocking and handicaps on the leaders which restrict the values of the cards the players whose horses are in the first three spots are able to play, or how much (or even IF) a horse in one of those spots can move on a dice roll.  To try to counter this, players have &quot;joker&quot; cards which can be used to avoid being handicapped when in one of the first three spots.  The steeplechase introduces additional rules for jumping fences.  Horses can be forced to pull up short of a fence (because they are blocked on the other side and have nowhere to land safely) or can occasionally fall if their movement ends on a fence - which takes four movement points to jump.  Players will need to plan their moves carefully to prevent other players from getting their full amount of movement, and to avoid having players doing that to them.<br/><br/>The first four horses to finish each race are awarded points towards their final total.<br/><br/>The game comes in two versions.

Players control different expeditions which they equip to explore the Lost World.  Victory is achieved through finding various species of dinosaurs and collecting specimens.  The game comes with a modular board to ensure that no two games are alike, and lots of dinosaur stand-up pieces.  One of the most entertaining parts of the game occurs when a dinosaur chases an expedition back to base camp!<br/><br/><br/>This Avalon Hill game has features beyond most family games that appeals to strategy gamers and increase replayability.  First, the board is modular; the location of all the dinosaur sites and required items is completely random every game.  This sort of feature, unusual before the German games of the 90's, puts Dinosaurs of the Lost World years ahead of its time.<br/><br/>Second, players may influence and interact with other players both indirectly by moving dinosaurs in their path or directly by either trading items amicably or attacking their expedition mercilessly.<br/><br/>Third-The sharp limits set out in the rules on weapons and ammunition force the players to pick their battles carefully and makes each dinosaur encounter thrilling and high stakes.  Followed strictly, the rules give the dinosaurs a real possibility of winning a combat and requires strategic planning from players if they hope to avoid being chased right out of the game.<br/><br/>Fourth- The consequences of losing a dinosaur combat are serious.  During the chase you may lose one or more useful tools and even victory points.  Once you escape from the dinosaur, you are returned to camp and lose your next turn.  Because actions that can be taken in camp are somewhat limited, a lost dinosaur battle completely knocks out one turn and diminishes what can be accomplished in two additional turns.<br/><br/>Finally- The game has excellent style.

Will you play as the ubiquitous Elves, the barbaric Uthuk Yllan, the stalwart Dwarves, the vile Undead, the medieval Knights, the desert dwelling Acolytes, the mighty Dragon kin, or the vicious Orcs?  Players choose a faction from the eight available in the base game and an army point value for the battle. Each must then build an army using the double-sided cardboard disks and battle it out.  At least half of the army points must be from one faction and the remaining points are made up of like aligned or neutral disks and spells.<br/><br/>Each double-sided disk represents either a faction homeland (your starting area), a terrain (ruins, forest, swamp etc... with effects on combat and line of sight), a spell(levels 1-3), a missile or one unit with its alignment (Good, Neutral, or Evil) with values for its Attack, Defense, Toughness, Movement and the army point cost of the disk. The disks have varying sizes (Giants and Dragons tend to be larger) and most units have a wide variety special abilities such as flying, the spell-casting ability or the missile ability to launch boulders, bolts, arrows or fireballs for example.  Players take it in turn activating 3 units(disks) and resolving battles, casting spells, and firing missiles.<br/><br/>Activated Unit disks are moved around the table by flipping them end over end a number of times up to their movement value.  If the disk lands on top of an opposing army disk a battle ensues with the top disk (the attacker) doing its attack damage value to the lower disk (the defender) who applies its defense value to the attacker if the damage is equal or greater to either unit's toughness it is either wounded or killed. Combats can involve numerous disks upon top of each other and are resolved top down. Missiles can be fired by missile capable units at disks within range by dropping them upon the target from a foot above the table. Those which land upon the target do damage otherwise they miss or can hit other disks they land on.  This can result in 'friendly fire' damage on your own troops and adds an element of luck/dexterity to the game.<br/><br/>The game rules come with multiple scenarios that accommodate 2 to 8 players.

One of the things some gamers like about this game is that the game has 'no chance' element. That is to say, if players wished to play two games with the same moves, the outcome would be the same also.<br/><br/>This game takes the basic mechanics from Tresham's 1829, and adds several new elements. Players are seeking to make the most money by buying and selling stock in various share companies located on eastern United States map. The stock manipulation aspect of the game is widely-regarded as one of the best. The board itself is actually a fairly abstract hexagonal system, with track tiles placed on top of the hexes. Plus each 18xx title adds new and different elements to the game. This game features private rail companies and an extremely vicious, 'robber baron' oriented stock market.

Each player controls one of Earth's factions, each of which is trying to exert power over the planet Thunder's Edge. To win, players must gain the support of important lobby groups within the government, hold key locations on Thunder's Edge by military force, and fight for control of vital off-world locations.<br/><br/>from review by Nickjost:<br/>Play begins by setting up the board. The board is composed of hexes a la Settlers of Catan. These hexes are dealt out to the players who may look at them and then deploy them face down one at a time. The players then receive an initial allotment of money. They may spend this money to purchase units for the initial planet-fall. Any money that isn't spent is doubled. Opening strategies are based on buying enough infantry to hold any cities that you can know of (from the hexes dealt) and deploying those infantry to guard those cities.<br/><br/>There are also several other components. First, is the tension track. This is essentially a turn marker. Once the tension track is exhausted the game ends. There are also a few off-world locations that provide special bonuses. Military units also make use of the transit and orbit boards. Units in &quot;transit&quot; are moved to &quot;orbit&quot;. Units in &quot;orbit&quot; can be deployed to the board.

Alhambra, is itself derived from Stimmt So!. The original version of the game, Al Capone, was published in 1992 by a self-publishing company, db-Spiele, which was owned by the game designer Dirk Henn.<br/><br/>The re-theming of Stimmt So! and Alhambra: The Card Game resulted in the same game with different themes and only minor differences. Changes between Stimmt So! to Alhambra: The Card Game include:<br/>1) The initial money rules from Alhambra are used.<br/>2) The 2 player variant rules from Alhambra are used.<br/><br/>Stimmt So! A description of this version:<br/>Using mechanics similar to Union Pacific or its predecessor, Airlines, this game is about acquiring stock interests in the various aspects of a large corporation.  There are six <br/>different types of stock, which will reward the majority and sometimes the minority stockholders throughout the game.  Stock is made available by drawing cards on a four-card queue.  Each of the positions on the queue is a different stock market, which means there are four different currencies (Dollar, Euro, Ruble, Yen).  The currency cards are drawn from another queue on the same board.  A turn is quite simple - either take one of the four available currency cards or use some of your currency cards to purchase one of the available stocks.  If you pay more than the amount indicated on the stock card, the excess is lost.  However, if you purchase the stock for the exact printed price, then you can buy another stock, and so on.  After two randomly distributed payouts, the game ends with a final payout with the final stock card.  The player with the highest payout point total is the winner.<br/><br/>Al Capone  A description of this version:<br/>Using Influence cards, you collect Trade cards from different areas of town under the Mafia control, giving you control over the Distillery, the Chinese Laundry, the Betting Shop, etc. If you spend the exact amount of Influence required, you get another turn, and so on. Scoring occurs randomly twice during the game and at the end. When the first scoring occurs, only the majority holder in each Trade scores. When the second scoring occurs, the first and second majority holders score, and at the final scoring, the first three majority holders score. Ties are split accordingly.<br/><br/>Other versions/re-themes:<br/>Alhambra Bonn card game is Alhambra the card game with the Bonn theme. Originally as a limited run for Bonn, Germany and surrounding areas. There is also a Alhambra New York card game which is currently out of print, as well as an Alhambra Nederland card game.

Each turn, players simultaneously choose and reveal a card from their hand, then add the cards to the rows, with cards being placed in ascending order based on their number; specifically, each card is placed in the row that ends with the highest number that's below the card's number. When the sixth card is placed in a row, the owner of that card claims the other five cards and the sixth card becomes the first card in a new row.<br/><br/>In addition to a number from 1 to 104, each card has a point value.

Each round features a simultaneous selection of 2 of the 10 cards and a designation of which of the several pastures (the number of pastures in the game depends on the number of players) you'll try to place the cows in.

Whenever you cannot make a complete car, you cannot take part in that race.<br/> Specials: When your coach work, tires and engine have the same value, the combination is worth 21 points, in spite of their original value. Then you add the value of the driver. When your driver is also of the same value, the total combination is worth 28 points.<br/> Changing: When it's your turn, you can choose on of the following actions:<br/>1.Hand in 1 of your cards (visible) and draw 2 new ones. The new cards can be drawn from the visible cards or from the closed pile. The 4 open piles are sorted by their kind.<br/><br/>2.Keep all your cards and draw 1 new card.

At the beginning of the game, however, players don't know which mission they must fulfill!<br/><br/>In the standard four-player game, each player guides one of four secret agents. The four characters are allied in pairs: Lord Fiddlebottom and Colonel Bubble are always partnered against Agent X and Madame Zsa Zsa. Each of the four agents is represented by one of four different figures, with different builds: tall, short, fat, thin. Only one of them represents the actual character controlled by a player. The other three figures represent spies which are friendly to him and that are trying to confuse the opposition.<br/><br/>On a turn, a player shakes the Phantom of Prophecy randomizer to determine his three available actions, e.g., moving on a land route or a sea route. The player moves his figures, trying to reach spaces already occupied by the other players' figures or the Ambassador. When figures are in the same space, the current player gets the right to &quot;ask questions&quot; and inspect some of the cards of that player. By deduction and a logical process of elimination, he can draw conclusions as to the identity and intentions of the other players.<br/><br/>The first goal of every agent is to discover which of the other players is his partner. This partner has the other half of the &quot;code&quot; indicating his secret mission. After discovering (or thinking he has discovered) the real identity of the other players, an agent must trade his secret mission card with his ally. This will reveal the final mission and what must be done to complete it. If either agent on a team completes the mission, both he and his partner win the game.<br/><br/>There is another character with an important role in the game: the Ambassador. He can be used to get clearer information about the other characters. Everyone wants to meet him because he is well-informed and can be useful to accomplish your purposes, but he can also help your rivals, so do everything you can to keep him far from them.<br/><br/>The 2013 version of Inkognito from Ares Games raises the maximum player count to five by allowing someone to play the Ambassador and move it during his turn. He can still gather clues when the other players question the Ambassador during their turn, and the other players can still gather clues from him. The goal of the Ambassador's player is to know everything about the other characters, guessing their identities and builds. If the Ambassador achieves &quot;perfect knowledge&quot; before a team accomplishes its secret missions, he wins the game.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "3", "boardgameversion": ["Ares Games English edition 2013", "Devir Catalan edition 2013", "Devir Spanish edition 2013", "IELLO French edition 2013", "Kaissa Greek edition 2013", "MB Dutch edition 1988", "MB French edition 1988", "MB German second edition with SdJ", "MB italian edition", "MB Spanish edition", "MB Spiele German edition 1988", "MB spill Danish/Norwegian edition 1989", "Milton Bradley Swedish edition 1989", "Piatnik German, Hungarian & Czech edition 2013", "Rio Grande Edition", "Winning Moves first edition"], "average": "6.5973", "name": "Inkognito", "videogamebg": ["Inkognito"], "playingtime": "90", "boardgamemechanic": ["Partnerships", "Point to Point Movement", "Roll / Spin and Move"], "age": "10", "usersrated": "2370", "boardgamesubdomain": ["Family Games"], "boardgamefamily": ["Cities: Venice", "Country: Italy"], "boardgamepodcastepisode": ["Episode 16 : BGGcon 2015 Recap - Codenames - Favor of the Pharoah - Time Stories", "Herner Spielewahnsinn Prototypen 2013", "The Spiel #8 - Whodunnit?!", "Vox Republica 085: Going Inside L5R Card Design"]}, "467": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic248734.jpg", "poll": [], "boardgamedesigner": ["Uwe Rosenberg"], "statistics": [], "yearpublished": "1997", "maxplayers": "7", "boardgameartist": ["Bj\u00f6rn Pertoft"], "boardgamepublisher": ["AMIGO Spiel + Freizeit GmbH"], "maxplaytime": "45", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic248734_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "45", "boardgamecategory": ["Card Game", "Expansion for Base-game", "Farming", "Negotiation"], "description": "This is an expansion for the Bohnanza card game.

With money, you can buy &quot;organization&quot; in a state, acting as a multiplier to all subsequent votes you get in that state. You can buy &quot;advertising&quot; - most useful in buying votes in piddly states that you're too busy to visit. You can buy &quot;surrogates&quot; which are additional pawns who may travel, garnering votes, just like your candidate. You can buy &quot;special flights&quot; that help you get to places without the luck of the dice.<br/><br/>The most characteristic part of the game comes in the &quot;issues&quot;. Each player picks a politician with his own profile on how he stands on various issues. Then either through choice or chance cards, issues become &quot;active&quot;. As long as the issue is active, politicians with a relevant stand will have bonuses or penalties when he visits certain states. The game strongly encourages role playing.<br/><br/>The climax of the game comes at the end, as you go down each state to see who has the most votes, thereby winning that state's delegates. There is a smart balloting system, in which the lowest scoring player drops out, giving his states' votes to the next strongest in each state.

The tower serves as a semi-permanent control marker, as well as a way to win.  If two land pieces are controlled by the same player, the land pieces are combined into one, which makes the position harder to take by the other players.<br/><br/>The first player to place a set number of towers wins the game, but the game can also end when the land masses are reduced to three or fewer, in which case the player with the most towers placed wins.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": ["Rio Grande edition", "Venice Connection edition", "Winning Moves German edition", "Winning Moves German edition with SdJ"], "name": "Carolus Magnus", "playingtime": "60", "boardgamemechanic": ["Area Control / Area Influence", "Dice Rolling", "Hand Management", "Modular Board", "Partnerships"], "age": "12", "usersrated": "3074", "boardgamesubdomain": ["Strategy Games"], "average": "6.85263", "boardgamepodcastepisode": ["Gaming Rules! \u2013 Podcast 11", "Gaming Rules! \u2013 Podcast 12", "MN 0008 Carolus Magnus"]}, "482": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic650195.jpg", "poll": [], "boardgamedesigner": ["Dan Glimne", "Erik Karlsson", "Joel Sevelin"], "statistics": [], "yearpublished": "1999", "maxplayers": "5", "boardgameartist": ["Franz Vohwinkel"], "boardgamepublisher": ["Anv\u00e4ndbart Litet F\u00f6retag", "Ravensburger Spieleverlag GmbH"], "maxplaytime": "30", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic650195_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "30", "boardgamecategory": ["Racing"], "description": "Players take on the role of cat burglars and use a simultaneous bidding mechanism similar to Raj/Hol's der Geier to get cards that allow them to move up a skyscraper.

Play begins in the Spring of 1901, and players make both Spring and Autumn moves each year. There are only two kinds of military units: armies and fleets. On any given turn, each of your military units has limited options: they can move into an adjoining territory, support an allied unit in an attack on an adjoining territory, support an allied unit in defending an adjoining territory, or hold their position. Players instruct each of their units by writing a set of &quot;orders.&quot; The outcome of each turn is determined by the rules of the game. There are no dice rolls or other elements of chance.

Later, the game was revamped into Ausgebremst, with the most notable changes being modular boards and options to reduce the luck.<br/><br/>The new Cafe Games/Pro Ludo edition has only 2 different tracks compared to the Ravensburger edition with 2 track variants on both sides of the board.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": ["Asmod\u00e9e Dutch edition", "Asmodee English Edition", "Cafe Games English edition", "German Pro Ludo edition", "Grow Portuguese first edition", "M\u00f6bius Red Car Edition", "Pro Ludo English Edition", "Ravensburger Dutch First Edition", "Ravensburger Dutch Second edition", "Ravensburger French First Edition", "Ravensburger German First Edition", "Ravensburger German Second Edition", "Ravensburger Italian First Edition", "Ravensburger multi-lingual edition 1989", "Ravensburger Nordic edition with \u00c5rets familjespel award", "Ravensburger Nordic First Edition", "Ubik French Edition"], "average": "6.63797", "name": "Ave Caesar", "playingtime": "30", "boardgamemechanic": ["Hand Management"], "age": "12", "boardgameexpansion": ["30701"], "usersrated": "3834", "boardgamesubdomain": ["Family Games"], "boardgamefamily": ["Ancient Rome"], "boardgamepodcastepisode": ["Episode 16: Ave Caesar", "Meeples &amp; Miniatures Episode 15 - Bread and Circus"]}, "495": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic72230.jpg", "poll": [], "boardgamedesigner": ["Alan R.

Each turn, a player rolls a pair of color dice and chooses one of the showing die colors to perform an action with. Each color is tied to one type of recyclable material. A player can choose to receive a single new recyclable good to his delivery yard, or he can choose to move a single recyclable good from his delivery yard to his treatment area, or he can choose to sell one good from his treatment area to the market grid in the center of the board.<br/><br/>The market grid has 5 rows, and each row can hold only one variety of recyclable materials. When selling to the market, if it is the first time that good has been sold, the player may choose which row to sell into (left-most position in the row only), otherwise he must sell into the next empty space in the row that variety already occupies. He receives the amount of money shown on the space where he places his recyclable good. When the row is full, all goods of that type are removed from the game. The game ends when four of the market rows are completely filled.<br/><br/>If the player rolls both dice of the same color, he has no choice in which recyclable material to choose, but may perform two actions (delivery, treatment, or sale) with that type of good. In addition, there are two special symbols on the dice (one on each). One is a star symbol, which acts as a wild. The player can choose whatever color he desires. The other is a gavel, which triggers an immediate auction for the type of good shown on the other die, after which the player takes another turn. The auction is a closed-fist auction.<br/><br/>At the beginning of the player's turn, he must pay 5 dollars in storage fees if he has more than 2 recyclable materials in his delivery yard. He must also pay 5 dollars in storage fees if he has more than 2 recyclable materials in his treatment area. This provides tension between waiting for bigger pay-outs and selling recyclable materials early.<br/><br/>The player with the most money at the end of the game wins.<br/><br/>"}}
