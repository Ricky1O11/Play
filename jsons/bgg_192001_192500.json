While the northern group of armies (Army Group North) pushed towards Leningrad in a war of rapid maneuver its 16th Army covered the flank in the Lake Ilmen &ndash; Valday Hills area. Here, fighting began to settle down in early fall 1941 and by January had become static. Then the Soviets attacked. By late January the Soviet 11th Army had broken the German front in several sectors and threatened to surround perhaps 70,000 Germans around Demyansk. When 3rd Shock Army broke the southern wing of German 16th Army Soviet advances threatened now to destroy 16th Army and open the flank to Leningrad. It is at this stage that game-play begins.<br/><br/>General Introduction - Demyansk Shield recreates the World War II campaign in the Valday Hills region of Russia, from late January 1942 through May 1942. One player will control the Axis forces (Germans), while his opponent controls the Soviet forces (Russians). The playing pieces represent the actual units that participated in the campaign and the map represents the terrain over which those units fought. The players maneuver their units across the map and conduct combat according to the rules of play. One player wins by capturing certain specified objectives while his opponent wins by avoiding those victory conditions.<br/><br/>"}, "192024": {"poll": [], "name": "Car Washer: Summer Of The Ninja", "videogamemode": ["Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["Windows Downloadable edition", "Xbox 360 Marketplace edition"], "average": "0", "videogametheme": ["Ninjas"], "usersrated": "0", "videogamedeveloper": ["Pen and Sword Games"], "videogamegenre": ["Arcade"], "videogameplatform": ["Windows", "Xbox 360"], "statistics": [], "videogamepublisher": ["Pen and Sword Games"], "description": "Summer break, a time to relax and have fun.

Scenarios are included for both battles with historical deployments, free-set-up, and for Preston a short introductory scenario and a three-day campaign game.

John Lambert&rsquo;s 4,000 Parliamentarians could only slow Hamilton&rsquo;s 20,000 invading army as it joined 3,500 Royalists under Sir Marmaduke Langdale and marched through Lancashire. When Langdale encountered Lambert near Preston on 17 August 1648 it was dismissed as another delaying tactic, and Hamilton continued south across the River Ribble. What they did not know was that Oliver Cromwell had forced-marched 4,500 &ldquo;Ironsides&rdquo; of the New Model Army 300 miles to join Lambert. Langdale desperately tried to hold off the assault, but was overwhelmed, and Hamilton&rsquo;s divided and disorganised army was destroyed in a three-day running battle. With the Royalists defeated the Army purged Parliament so they could bring &ldquo;Charles Stuart, that man of blood, to an account for that blood he had shed&rdquo;.  His trial was a forgone conclusion and the King and Hamilton were beheaded.<br/><br/>WORCESTER 1651 In 1650 the Scots invited King Charles II to succeed his father, so Cromwell invaded Scotland, destroying their army at Dunbar and taking Edinburgh. Charles II raised a new army, but with little chance of victory in Scotland he slipped past Cromwell and marched south to Worcester, hoping to rally English Royalists to his cause. Cromwell followed, joining the county militias raised by Fleetwood and Harrison, marching on the 16,000 Royalists with 31,000 men, intent on a battle of annihilation that would end the Civil Wars for once and for all. On 3 September 1651 Cromwell crossed the River Severn with a bridge of boats, dividing his army in order to encircle the Royalist army. Charles seized his chance and attacked the militia east of the river, but was repulsed, and the Ironsides chased his army through the bloody streets of Worcester, killing 3,000 and taking 13,000 prisoners. Charles fled to France, famously hiding in an oak tree to escape capture, while Cromwell would overthrow Parliament and make himself Lord Protector.<br/><br/>&bull; Two Mapsheets (11&Prime;x34&Prime; and 17&rdquo;x22&rdquo;) <br/>&bull; One Countersheet (216 9/16&Prime; counters) <br/>&bull; One Rules Booklet <br/>&bull; Two Players Aid Charts (one for each player)<br/>&bull; Two Generals Display Charts (one for each side) <br/>Two six-sided dice are required to play the game, but are not included.<br/><br/>"}, "192070": {"poll": [], "name": "Age of Steel:  Recharge", "videogamemode": ["Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["Windows Downloadable Edition"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2847779.jpg", "videogametheme": ["Post-Apocalyptic"], "usersrated": "1", "videogamedeveloper": ["Quaint Emerald"], "videogamegenre": ["Real Time Strategy", "Tower Defense"], "videogameplatform": ["Windows"], "average": "2", "statistics": [], "videogamepublisher": ["Pirozhok Studio"], "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2847779_t.jpg", "description": "User Summary<br/><br/>You defend a base using turrets, tanks, ships, and air units to repel attackers.

Inspired by the game from George R. R. Martin's A Song of Ice and Fire fantasy novels (HBO's Game of Thrones is based on this series), Battlemind combines the strategic elements of Chess, Stratego, and Blitzkrieg to create a an easy to learn but hard to master game with infinite replayability. This game is for anyone who loves strategy games - not just fans of the books!<br/><br/>What makes Battlemind special? Instead of being played like a typical card game (dealing/drawing), it is played more like a board game, with players setting up a &quot;board&quot; made of terrain cards and moving character cards across them.<br/><br/>Like chess, each character card has a certain number of spaces in which it can move. But that's where the similarities end. Each character has a strength value (1-8) which dictates whether it can capture/kill another character as well as certain advantages and disadvantages over other characters. From the lowly Rabble (rabble is like an angry mob) to the powerful Dragon, every unit has a purpose.  How you use them is up to you!<br/><br/>Finally, each terrain type can benefit or hinder your character. Use terrain to slow your enemy down, protect your fortress, and even hide from Dragons!<br/><br/>Ultimately, how you set up your terrain, arrange your army, and advance your units will determine whether you will be the victor or the vanquished. You'll laugh at your opponent when he places a crucial unit on his front line that you are able to capture easily, but will be crushed when that same placement allows him to capture your dragon on his first move in the next game!<br/><br/>Will you create a defensive stronghold and make your advesary come to you?  Or will you storm the front lines in hopes of catching your opponent off guard?<br/><br/>It's your decision.  The fate of the Kingdom rests on your shoulders. Fight for honor.  Fight for glory.  But remember: in the game of Battlemind, every move can mean victory or crushing defeat.<br/><br/>"}, "192076": {"poll": [], "name": "Solid Africa", "videogamemode": ["Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["Commodore 64 edition"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2849520.jpg", "videogametheme": ["Military"], "usersrated": "0", "videogamedeveloper": ["(Self-Published)"], "videogamegenre": ["Shoot 'em Up"], "videogameplatform": ["Commodore 64"], "average": "0", "statistics": [], "videogamepublisher": ["(Unknown)"], "videogamecompilation": ["C64 Classix"], "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2849520_t.jpg", "description": "User Summary: Solid Africa is a shoot'em-up game by Joachim Coche in 1988.

But when an ominous force invades the world, Bethel Woods becomes a distant memory, lost inside the thickets of the forest.<br/><br/>Now a group of young people, wearing the crest of the orphanage, return to finish the work that was started long ago. They must work diligently, however, to repair and restore the machines scattered throughout the forest, before the ominous force finds the technology and destroys the only chance the world has in surviving.<br/><br/>The cooperative game Bethel Woods is set in the universe of &quot;Hours&quot;, created by author, Jessy Ribordy (Falling Up/The River Empires) and uses a mancala-like mechanism. Players first pick up all the Workers from any one of the 6 Machines surrounding the Orphanage, then move either clockwise or counter-clockwise around the board, dropping one worker on each Machine and fixing Malfunctions as they go. There are 4 Malfunction types, each with a matching Worker type to fix it. All Malfunctions that players fix are added to their personal supply as &quot;Knowledge&quot;.<br/><br/>To win, players need to send 6 of the 12 Workers into Bethel Woods Orphanage with increasing amounts of Knowledge to construct the &quot;Daydreamer&quot; (a machine that will rescue the orphanage's inhabitants from the impending downfall). The first Worker needs just 1 Knowledge of their type, the second 2, the third 3, and so on.<br/><br/>Players also need to use their acquired Knowledge to uncover spies, hidden within each of the Machines. Players may uncover 1 Spy only on the last Machine they place a Worker on each turn.<br/><br/>After each turn, three random Malfunctions are drawn and added to the various Machines. If a Machine has more than 3 Malfunctions and/or Spies, it goes into the critical state. These all make the task of maintaining the Machines and constructing the Daydreamer that much harder. Also, any round where at least one Machine goes critical, results in a Spy being placed.<br/><br/>Players lose the game if at the end of a player's turn, there are 4 critical Machines. They can also lose immediately if there are ever 6 Spies on the board or not enough Malfunctions when placing them.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": ["English first edition"], "name": "Bethel Woods", "playingtime": "40", "boardgamemechanic": ["Co-operative Play", "Set Collection", "Variable Player Powers"], "average": "7.43306", "usersrated": "49", "age": "12", "boardgamepodcastepisode": ["18.

When he is gone his neighbors drop by to &ldquo;help themselves&rdquo; to the garden produce. Can Mr. Cabbagehead succeed with his garden dreams and finally win the blue ribbon - all the while keeping his tiresome neighbors away?<br/><br/>In Mr. Cabbagehead's Garden, you will be placing vegetable cards in a grid of six cards by three cards, this being your garden plot. Of the 18 possible positions you will, by the end of the game, have at most 15 cards placed. The game is played in three phases:<br/><br/>1. The &ldquo;Mr. Cabbagehead plants vegetables in the garden while his neighbors peer over the fence at him and make tedious and tiresome comments.&rdquo; Phase<br/><br/>Deal the top three cards of the vegetable deck face up in front of you in a row. The leftmost card costs 1 Bee to plant (place one of the Bee tokens from your supply on the Beehive. If you do not have any Bees, you may not choose this card). The center card does not cost any Bees and is free to plant. The rightmost card can be planted for free as well, and as a bonus, you may take one of the Bees from the Beehive and add it to your supply (If Bees are not available on the Beehive you may not choose this card).<br/><br/>When planting the card you may place it anywhere in your garden plot. You may remove a card already in the plot and plant the new card in that position.<br/><br/>Cards may not otherwise be moved once planted. The grid of garden plot cards does not have fixed borders until the 6th card in a row is placed and/or the 3rd card in a column.<br/><br/>Of the two remaining drawn cards, locate the card with the highest Neighbor number. Draw a number of Tedious Neighbor tokens from the token area equal to the Tedious number on this card and place the drawn token(s) on the matching Tedious Neighbor card. Then place these two remaining cards off to one side. They will not be used again.<br/><br/>Repeat this phase until 15 cards have been drawn, 5 have been planted, and the On Vacation card is showing on top of the vegetable deck. Remove the On Vacation card and go to Phase 2.<br/><br/>2. The &ldquo;Oh those vegetables look ripe! Be a shame to let the birds get them while Mr. Cabbagehead is on holiday. Maybe I should just pop over and grab a few for myself.&rdquo; Phase<br/><br/>Whichever Tedious Neighbor card has the most tokens on it will determine which neighbor takes a vegetable card from the garden plot. The removed vegetable is placed off to once side and not used again, and all Tedious Neighbor tokens are shuffled back into the supply with their On Vacation side facing up.<br/><br/>The 1st and 2nd Phase will alternate until all 45 vegetable cards have been dealt and 15 cards have been planted (If you or your neighbors have removed cards during Phases 1 and 2 there may be fewer than 15 cards in your garden plot at this point).<br/><br/>3. The &ldquo;Ms. Eudora Brassica and the Garden Club arrive to judge Mr. Cabbagehead&rsquo;s garden for the annual Blue Ribbon Garden Contest.&rdquo; Phase<br/><br/>Scoring of the garden plot now takes place. Vegetables only score if they are orthogonally adjacent to other matching vegetable cards. No single vegetables score any points.<br/><br/>For each vegetable type, the score equals: the point value x number of adjacent matching cards<br/><br/>For each vegetable you have removed from the garden plot subtract 2 points. Score each set of adjacent vegetables and then apply any Awards of Merit as shown on the back of Eudora&rsquo;s card, adding them to your total.<br/><br/>You may score one or more awards if your garden plot matches the specific award requirements.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "1", "boardgameversion": ["English edition 2017", "English first edition"], "name": "Mr. Cabbagehead's Garden", "playingtime": "20", "boardgamemechanic": ["Card Drafting", "Pattern Recognition", "Set Collection"], "average": "7.66951", "usersrated": "41", "age": "10", "boardgamepodcastepisode": ["1P 099 - Project Dreamscape", "If You Buy One Game - Relaxing Games", "What Did You Play This Week Podcast Thing Week 77!"]}, "192313": {"rpgartist": ["(Uncredited)"], "rpgitemversion": ["PDF Version"], "statistics": [], "name": "Villains & Dragons", "rpgdesigner": ["Errin Famiglia"], "rpgproducer": ["Errin Famiglia"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2853988.jpg", "usersrated": "0", "average": "0", "rpggenre": ["Fantasy"], "rpgpublisher": ["(Web published)"], "rpg": ["Villains & Dragons"], "rpgcategory": ["Core Rules (min needed to play)"], "poll": [], "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2853988_t.jpg", "description": "User Summary:<br/><br/>All characters in the game are Villains.

The game is made up of 9 double-sided cards that consist of different sections of the race track. As you move around the track you will move these card section around to produce a full race track.  Each player has his own d6 and two tokens; one to represent his/her horse on the track and the other to represent the Jockey Boost token.<br/><br/>Components:<br/>[9 cards] - on [1] A4 letter size Double sided PDF sheet <br/>[1] - A4 Letter size Double sided PDF sheet - Rules<br/>[4] - d6 dice [1 Green, 1 Blue, 1 Yellow and 1 Red]<br/>[8] - Wood cubes - [2 Green, 2 Blue, 2 Yellow and 2 Red]<br/><br/>GAME PLAY:<br/>It's racing day is played in turns with each player rolling his/her d6 and moving his horse token the same number of spaces, as rolled on the d6, around the track.  The player with the lowest die roll moves his/her horse token first, which also means that player could roll the lowest die and still cross the finish line before a player with a higher dice roll!<br/><br/>On each turn a player can decide to use one of his two Jockey Boost actions, which would allow the player to reroll his/her d6.  If a player decides to take this action the move their Jockey Boost token on the 1st token space and rerolls their d6 die.  The player MUST use this new roll, even if it is less than the previous roll, to move his/her horse token around the track.  Each player is only allowed a maximum of two Jockey boosts per game.<br/><br/>CROSSING THE FINISH LINE:<br/>As the players get closer to the finish line each die roll becomes critical.  Since the player with the lowest die results moves first, this player could cross the finish line before a player who is closer but rolls a higher number!<br/><br/>If two or more players roll the same number they move there pieces at the same time.  If those two or more players can all cross the finish line with their die results, the player that is closest to the finish line will cross first followed by the next closest player and so on.<br/><br/>The BLUE player is one space away from winning.  The RED player is two spaces away from winning and the GREEN and YELLOW players are both three spaces away from winning.  The following dice results are rolled: BLUE=5, GREEN=3, RED =3, and YELLOW=1.  Since the YELLOW player rolled the lowest die roll he/she moves first but still doesn't cross the finish line.  Since the BLUE player rolled the highest die roll he moves last.  Now we come to the RED and GREEN players who both rolled 3, which means they move their horse tokens at the same time.  Since the RED player is one space closer to the finish line, he/she ends up crossing the finish line one length ahead of the GREEN player.  The results so far are RED player comes in 1st, the GREEN player comes in 2nd, and the BLUE and YELLOW players still need to take another turn to finish the race.<br/><br/>ADVANCED GAME PLAY:<br/>It's racing day can also be played with an ADVANCED race track layout by using the Hedge cards.  Hedge cards add an hazardous obstacle to the game.  Whenever a player tries to jump over a HEDGE space and they roll a 5 or 6, their speed is too fast, causing their horse to stumble and slow down.  The player must immediately stop their horse token directly beyond the hedge space and lose their next turn.   A player could avoid this roll by using their Jockey Boost action but if the second roll is low enough to prevent them from reaching the hedge, they would still have to roll again on the next turn to try and clear the hedge.<br/><br/>WINNING THE GAME:<br/>To win the game a player's horse token must be the first to pass the finish line before any other player!  As each player passed the finish line they will place their horse token in the corresponding winners box.  Each player continues to roll his d6 until he passes the finish line and his/her horse token is placed in one of the four winners boxes.<br/><br/>"}, "192348": {"image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2932462.jpg", "poll": [], "boardgamedesigner": ["Ryan Miller", "Luke Peterschmidt"], "statistics": [], "yearpublished": "2015", "maxplayers": "4", "boardgamepublisher": ["Alderac Entertainment Group (AEG)", "Fun to 11", "Pegasus Spiele"], "boardgameintegration": ["Epic PvP: Magic", "Epic PvP: Magic"], "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2932462_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "15", "boardgamecategory": ["Fantasy"], "description": "Never put a Dark Elf and an Orc in the same room &mdash; unless you're playing Epic PvP: Fantasy, that is!

Following a simple set of rules, it is your duty to lead your fighters to glory.<br/><br/>Before the game each player selects their gladiators (wooden tokens). <br/>The arena is divided into a number of fields on which the gladiators can move. <br/>The game is played in turns. Each turn a player can move one of his gladiators or attack his opponents.<br/><br/>The goal of the game is to have at least one gladiator as a sole survivor in the arena.<br/><br/>When fighting your opponents the player must move one of his gladiators in the same field as the opponent's gladiator. A player then tries to determine the action by rolling the combat die, which can result in attack, defend or critical miss. The attack action allows the player to roll the attack die and the opponent rolls the defense die. The defend action means that the opponent is now counterattacking and the roles are reversed. Critical miss wastes the turn for the attacker.<br/><br/>Each turn a player draws an event card that can affect the gameplay and lasts for one turn. Even cards can be beneficial or harmful.<br/><br/>The arena is also a place for NPCs: warriors and animals, when defeated they yield weapons and armor respectively. Players can then use this to equip their gladiators.<br/><br/>There are other ways to gain the advantage over your opponents. Every gladiator has a unique ability which can have a significant impact if used in the right situation.
