It is part chance (dice) and part strategy (players decide whether or not to 'eat' the food card they land on) based. The theme in general is also to introduce younger players to the above mentioned food attributes and make them more informed about nutrition.<br/><br/>The players start off with all food attributes on the 'good' row of the 'nutritional grid'. Depending on the food choices they make, their counters move up or down the grid until one of the food attribute counters reaches the &quot;lose a life&quot; row, at which point they lose a life. Players can also un-balance other players nutrition grids via the &quot;Payback time&quot;, &quot;switch identity&quot; and &quot;Chance&quot; events.

He is pushed to his limits and beyond, undergoing not just physical and emotional hardship, but is also the subject of extensive psychological screening. The training regimen of the SICON Mobile Infantry Trooper, from his first day at boot until the day he cashiers out or breathes his last on some distant rock, is deliberately brutal and relentless. Particularly in boot, every peacetime Trooper is given every opportunity, indeed is encouraged, to give it up and, in the words of a particularly infamous drill sergeant, to &lsquo;take a stroll down Washout Lane.&rsquo;<br/><br/>In times of peace, SICON demands only the very best. In times of war, SICON does not have the luxury of being so discriminating. The proposed invasion of Klendathu prompted an incredible response from the recruitment and training arms of the Mobile Infantry. The Light Trooper concept had been gathering dust, unneeded, in SICON&rsquo;s files for many years &ndash; the Klendathu Invasion saw the idea taken from contingency plan to realisation within a few short months.<br/><br/>The Light Trooper is the infantry produced by SICON during wartime, when the necessity of rushing large numbers of troops to the battlefield trumps any concerns about the thoroughness of their training. Light Troopers are recruited, obviously, from the civilian population, but tend to be older when they enter boot than most Troopers. They are primarily university students, young professionals and tradesmen, even artists and drifters. They are the people who thought about enlisting in Federal Service, but never did, choosing to follow a different course with their lives. They are the people who never gave Federal Service a second thought, until they realised the benefits of citizenship. If war had never come, no doubt most would have lived out their lives as civilians, but there is no finer marching tune than the drums of war, a tune that calls them in droves to Federal Service.<br/><br/>A Light Trooper is not some poor buffoon given a Morita assault rifl e and thrust into combat; he does undergo training. While this training may pale in comparison to what a normal Trooper endures, it is nonetheless sufficient to prepare him for combat and give him at least a chance at survival. Many Light Troopers join Federal Service having already taken a level or two in the Civilian class.<br/><br/>There are two major differences between the Light Trooper and the regular Mobile Infantry. First, the Light Trooper&rsquo;s training does not prepare him for combat the way a normal Trooper&rsquo;s training would. For example, while he is deadly with a Morita assault rifle, the Light Trooper receives no training in any manner of vehicle operation, including power armour, normally a staple of Trooper training. Second, he is often considered a liability, at least at first, by &lsquo;true&rsquo; Mobile Infantry Troopers.<br/><br/>"}, "139525": {"rpgdesigner": ["Christopher J.

They might not have always had everything they wanted, but they did have everything they needed.<br/><br/>All was fine for many years, and the town lived in a pleasant peace. According to legend, that peace came to a horrific end at the hands of a horde of mercenaries hired by a nearby baron intent on owning Pellios and taxing its citizens. Unknown to most of the towns&rsquo; residents, the baron, named Merris, had offered his protection and resources to the town if they would agree to become part of his barony. The Collective politely declined his offer, stating that Pellios had existed as a free town for many generations, and had no need for anyone else&rsquo;s<br/>protection. As for resources, the fertile valley provided everything the town needed.<br/><br/>Not to be swayed, Merris proposed his offer repeatedly, always to have it declined by the Collective. Before the mercenaries arrived, Merris had proposed his final offer, along with a threat. According to rumor, the Collective received a messenger of Merris who told them that the baron was going to own Pellios, be it by peace or by war. The Collective, as it is told, instructed the messenger to return to his baron and tell him that Pellios will remain a free town no matter what threats he made.

Just like in any zombie story the object of the game is to survive the zombie apocalypse. Before you begin, you set up the Zombie Cards in this nifty &quot;Z&quot; shape and pick your Survivor Card to represent you in the game.<br/><br/>Everyone is dealt 5 cards that are a random set of weapons, some of which offer a utility function, but ALL of them can be used to Attack Zombies and other Survivors.<br/>Zombie Shuffle cycles between a Night Phase, where you must defeat incoming zombies, and a Day Phase that offers the opportunity to prepare for the next zombie attack. The game begins when the first zombie in the &quot;Z&quot; is flipped. Survivors must Attack the zombie with ANY 2 through 10 card corresponding with that zombie's suit.<br/><br/>The winner keeps the Zombie card to track their number of kills. If a player does not lay down a card corresponding with that zombie's suit then they are considered Attacked and either lose equipped armor or become a zombie!Before the next zombie card is flipped, Survivors can use the Zombie Cure, Equip Armor (which protects from Attacks), Steal another Survivor's Weapons/Supplies or may instead decide to Attack another Survivor.<br/><br/>Just like Attacking a Zombie, the Attack Card must correspond with the Survivor you're Attacking. If a Survivor is a Zombie and loses one of these battles then they are Dead for the remainder of the game. The other Survivor gets to keep their card, again to track their number of kills, and scavenge the dead player's cards.<br/><br/>The Day Phase ends when  everyone has had a chance to play a Utility or Attack Card and everyone has drawn enough cards to have 5 cards in their hand again.<br/><br/>The winner is the Survivor with the most kills at the end of the game. This has been a quick rundown of the game play and there are a few more awesome quirks to Zombie Shuffle not listed above.

This is a complete stand alone game that puts two or more players in control of history&rsquo;s greatest fighting machines using Dynamic Movement, Abilities Pooling and pure Cunning! The rules allow for play of one off games to settle old scores, bracketed tournaments or full immersion in the Ancient world using the Victus Campaign system. In the campaign, Gladiators battle to win their freedom or to gather glory as they advance in both wealth and skill. The Fortuna tables are used to expand a Gladiator's fate beyond the arena.  The rulebook comes with it&rsquo;s own board and paper models to allow for quick start to play; however, since gameplay takes place on a hex board, scale is not limited.<br/><br/>Players use a system to record their actions each turn and perform them in the order of a contested Initiative, which is determined by a roll off with modifiers for gear based on weight. Although Actions are recorded, maneuvering takes place in each turn as players perform counter strikes and have chances to maneuver in response to their opponent. Guard and Facing play a role in this.  Gladiators use their Fortitudo (used for striking), Agilito (used for defense and movement), and Virtus (used for stamina and as a resource pool) to perform their Actions each turn through the phases. As wounds are dealt, Gladiators become weaker.<br/><br/>Weapons have different effects against different armor and carry their own advantages and disadvantages in relation to the fighting styles. For example the Thracian's Sica is able to reach behind a Myrmillo's shield more effectively.  Striking takes place with models either targeting specific areas of the body or attacking untargeted areas with both players rolling in Attack/Defense. Armor for specific areas hit are taken into account and then if the attack passes through the armor the player rolls on a Wounding Table which can lead to anything from a Stun to a Fatal Wound. Fatal Wounds are worked up to, Stuns count as Modifiers to Abilities and subsequent rolls on the Wound Table.

Rick knows exactly how far he can push himself and what to do when something goes wrong.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, Rick was in the hospital after a rough stunt when the zombies came and got most of his friends.  His ribs still hurt, but that won't last.  Then it will be time for payback.<br/><br/>Rick has been wary of other people for a long time - they can break so easily under pressure.  He acts like a moody loner for now but is slowly beginning to trust some of his teammates.<br/><br/>Rick is an optional promotional survivor available to those that raise an extra amount on their pledge for the Zombicide Season Two Kickstarter campaign.

For the foundation of the greatest empire, You must build establishments connected with combo among a lot of others, and use their functions to produce victory points and to keep the other nations in check.<br/><br/>Overview<br/>Players play the game with the cards representing various establishments and political systems. Players take their turns in order. During their turns, they should RESEARCH to draw cards or BUILD to play their cards. The cost for the build is paid by selling cards from their hands, so players should choose which card to build and which card to sell prudently. And players can use the functions of the  cards in their tableau to draw extra cards, to get victory points, to steal cards from the other players, or to keep them in check by getting some advantages triggered by them. In the simple play, making the combos with various cards and maximizing the effects will be a key for the game.<br/><br/>In a simple explanation, Stardust Imperium is a game which is hybrid of &quot;Race for the galaxy&quot; and &quot;Magic the gathering&quot;. I'm a huge fan of them, but I had to make a game which can substitute them because those games are little bit hard for my friends. Consequently, I made a game in which players use abilities of their cards so they directly interact with each other like &quot;Magic the gathering&quot; in a frame in which players build their nations like &quot;Race for the galaxy&quot;. It took the merits of those games, but it was easy, simple and short. I'm satisfied with the basis of this game and while I'm continuing balancing tests, I decided to open this game in 3 languages so that more people enjoy this game and give me feedbacks.

Plagues swept the lands, indiscriminately thinning the ranks of humans. Seismic eruptions toppled skyscrapers and sent towering tsunamis crashing against densely inhabited coastal cities. Around the world, loss of life was catastrophic. Making matters worse, reports began streaming in from areas surrounding the great chasms of strange humanoid, even demonic beings permeating the wilderness.

From the ashes of Manhattan Island, the new city of Halcyon is being constructed. In this new city of opportunity, beneath the towering skyscrapers and the gleaming arcology, wars have begun over who will claim the spoils and rise to power in what is to become the keystone city of the Federation. The Federation and its military, foreign governments, megacorporations, organized crime syndicates, arms dealers, drug runners, fanatics, anarchists, and countless other factions all enter the fray to control the rise (or demise) of Halcyon and place their claim on the future of civilization.

On his turn player can do next actions as many times as he can afford in free order:<br/>-Buy one development tile.<br/>-Activate development tile with his/her worker.<br/>-Donate money to planetary fund to avoid catastrophes.<br/>-Trade with other players (one on one)<br/>-Remove catastrophe markers (with two money)<br/>After player has made as many actions as she/he wishes, it's next players turn. <br/>3. After every player has had turn, then global warming kicks in. First you remove two carbon cubes from the atmosphere and then temperature marker goes up as many places as there is carbon cubes left. (New carbon cubes emerge when you burn coal in power plants.)<br/>4. And then environmental catastrophes kick in. The temperature track tells you how many catastrophe cards you turn over. Now the chairman of the international community (i.e. starting player of this round) decides how to use planetary funds to overcome catastrophes. If he/she can't defeat catastrophes they will hit every player.<br/>5. At the end of the round every country has to feed its workers and produce needed energy. Player loses points and workers if she/he can't. And finally chairman of the international community marker goes to next player.<br/><br/>During the game you get points from some of the development tiles (cities, schools, laboratories) and at the end of the game you get points from workers, money and all your development tiles. Catastrophes make you lose money when they happen and points at the end.<br/><br/>To succeed you collectively most have more than 50 points (minimum 0, maximum 100). If the game is played in the classroom with many copies, then you can also see which group got the best overall score.<br/><br/>"}, "139764": {"poll": [], "name": "Torment: Tides of Numenera", "videogamemode": ["Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["Linux (Collector's Edition) edition", "Linux Downloadable edition", "Macinotosh Downloadable edition", "Macintosh (Collector's Edition) edition", "PSN PlayStation 4 Downloadable edition", "Windows (Collector's Edition) edition", "Windows Downloadable edition", "Xbox One Downloadable edition"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3449250.jpg", "videogametheme": ["Fantasy"], "usersrated": "3", "videogamedeveloper": ["InXile Entertainment"], "videogamegenre": ["RPG"], "videogameplatform": ["Linux", "Macintosh", "PlayStation 4", "Windows", "Xbox One"], "videogamehonor": ["2016 PAX Curse Award Best RPG of the Year Winner"], "average": "8.16667", "statistics": [], "videogamepublisher": ["InXile Entertainment"], "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3449250_t.jpg", "description": "From the Developer Website:<br/><br/>Single player, story-driven, isometric role-playing game.

Set in Monte Cook's new tabletop role-playing world, Numenera&trade;, the newest Torment asks: What does one life matter?<br/><br/>Numenera's Ninth World is a fantastic vision of a world in which massive civilizations have risen and fallen - disappeared, transcended, overwhelmed, or destroyed - and left their cities, monuments, and artifacts behind. As each rose and fell, their achievements became part of the accumulated detritus of eons... but much of it did not decay.

Besides the languages listed in this entry, the rules are also printed in Farsi (Persian) and Swahili.<br/><br/>There are 106 tiles (each measuring 27 mm x 33 mm) used in the game. There are 2 jokers and 104 numbered tiles. The numbered tiles are in four colors: Black, Red, Blue and Yellow. Think of these as card suits. Each color consists of 13 &quot;ranks&quot; (numbered 1 to 13) and there are 2 sets of 1-13 in each color.<br/><br/>The tiles are mixed up and placed face down in the middle of the table. Each player draws one and the player drawing the lowest number goes first. 14 tiles are drawn by each player into their rack.<br/><br/>Objective: The first player to play out all their tiles in their rack wins the hand. The winner scores the tile points that are left in their opponent's racks. First player to get 500 points is the winner.<br/><br/>A player's turn begins with drawing a tile. Players lay down melds of 3 or more tiles (&quot;sets&quot; of the same rank or &quot;runs&quot; (consecutive ranks in the same color)). Once each player has laid down 1 meld, they can play on the melds of other players. If the player can't play on their own or another person's meld, they must pass. There's a sand timer, so player's lose their turn if they spend too much time analyzing their options.<br/><br/>Splitting runs and sets:<br/>As an example, if you have a Black 7 tile, you can split a Black run 9-8-7-6-5 into 2 runs - Black 5-6-7 and Black 7-8-9. If you have a Red 8-9, you can split 4-10's (Red, Black, Blue, Blue) into run Red 8-9-10 and set of 3-10's (Black, Blue, Blue).<br/><br/>The Jokers have some restrictions on their use, but they can be powerful options for a player's strategies. If you have the right tile, you can play it to replace a Joker, but then you must play the Joker right away; you cannot place it back in your rack.<br/><br/>Besides the tiles, the game comes with 4 tile racks (some assembly required) and 2 sand timers.<br/><br/>"}, "139768": {"poll": [], "name": "Final Fantasy VII (ShenZhen)", "videogamemode": ["Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["Chinese Famicom edition"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2480148.png", "videogametheme": ["Fantasy", "Steampunk"], "videogamegenre": ["RPG"], "videogamedeveloper": ["ShenZhen Nanjing Technology"], "videogamefranchise": ["(Unlicensed Games)"], "videogameplatform": ["NES"], "usersrated": "0", "average": "0", "statistics": [], "videogamepublisher": ["ShenZhen Nanjing Technology"], "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2480148_t.png", "description": "<br/><br/><br/>    <br/>        <br/>UNLICENSED GAME<br/><br/>    <br/>    <br/>        <br/>This game is an unlicensed version of Final Fantasy VII.<br/><br/>    <br/><br/><br/>Final Fantasy VII (simplified Chinese: \u6700\u7ec8\u5e7b\u60f37; traditional Chinese: \u6700\u7d42\u5e7b\u60f37; pinyin: Zu&igrave; Zh\u014dng Hu&agrave;n Xi\u01ceng 7), also called Core Crisis (Chinese: \u6838\u5fc3\u5371\u673a; pinyin: H&eacute; X\u012bn W\u0113i J\u012b), is a Chinese unofficial, unlicensed &quot;Shanzhai&quot; remake of the 1997 role-playing video game Final Fantasy VII, originally developed by Square for the PlayStation.

Players trade off activating squadrons during each turn, ensuring that a player never has to sit and wait while his opponent moves and attacks with his entire army. By using alternating activation of squadrons, the game's action unfolds at a fast and furious pace, allowing large scale battles to be easily carried out in a single evening. Each player receives a number of Command Points each turn based on the number of mecha they have on the field, and the quality of their officers. Command Points are spent throughout the turn on maneuvers such as boosted movement, devastating weapon salvos, breakneck dodging counterattacks, and potent special abilities.<br/><br/>The wide variety of mecha in the boxed game bring to bear the myriad and awesome weapon systems from the Robotech universe to lay waste to your foes.

Offering gamers a slew of dynamic new Match types, traps, boons, build kits, and over 30 pre-made combat optimized characters.<br/><br/>Whether you're looking to step up your combat, test your insane character build, or simply grind your table-mates into the dirt, Conflict PvP: Tactics and Teams has the tools you need to show your friends a bloody good time.<br/><br/>Like conventional Pathfinder or D20 campaigns, Conflict PvP uses a game master to run the matches smoothly, handle meta-gaming, hidden movement and ensure everyone is having a good time. Conflict PvP has dedicated chapters to the art of GMing, where any  Gamemaster can find great nuggets on improving their craft. Moreover, the Conflict PvP: Tactics and Teams rulebook offers up many ways to sprinkle player vs. player competitions into existing campaigns. Several well-organized lists of plot hooks, magic items, artifacts, rule adjustments and dos and don&rsquo;ts are added in, which means not only can GMs shake their campaigns up with PvP, but they also have another great resource for their traditional campaigns.<br/><br/>Conflict PvP is chock full of light-weight rules like the Battlepoint system, which allows players to measure their crazy character builds. Each match is assigned a maximum number of points. Participating characters' total values must be under the match maximum in order to be part of the match. This simple structure keeps combat fair and consistent.<br/><br/>By adding easy-to-use coordinates to official battlemaps, and providing double-sided passcards, the game designers of Conflict PvP have finally cracked the age-old problem of hidden movement in tabletop RPG games. This means opposing players will be unaware of each other&rsquo;s movements when using stealth or magical effects like invisibility. In these cases, the players' miniatures are actually removed from the battlemap. Their characters' map&rsquo;s coordinates are shared through a passcard until a revealing attack is made; making surprise sneak attacks truly a surprise.<br/><br/>included are<br/>two full-color 24&rdquo; by 36&rdquo; Battlemaps<br/><br/>"}, "139831": {"poll": [], "name": "Monopoly: La Rochelle", "playingtime": "90", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": ["Card Drafting", "Dice Rolling", "Set Collection", "Trading"], "yearpublished": "2011", "usersrated": "0", "boardgamefamily": ["Country: France", "Monopoly"], "maxplayers": "8", "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1605279_t.png", "average": "0", "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["Winning Moves France"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1605279.png", "boardgameversion": ["First edition"], "maxplaytime": "90", "boardgamecategory": ["Dice", "Economic", "Negotiation"], "age": "8", "minplaytime": "90", "description": "A monopoly (from Greek monos &mu;\u03cc&nu;&omicron;&sigmaf; (alone or single) + polein &pi;&omega;&lambda;&epsilon;\u1fd6&nu; (to sell)) exists when a specific person or enterprise is the only supplier of a particular commodity.<br/><br/>Monopoly is a roll-and-move game where players move around the game board buying or trading properties, developing their properties with houses and hotels.

To get a job as an apprentice, you must have influence in that guild, there must be an available apprentice slot (only one per guild every turn) and you must have enough money to pay the admission fee.<br/><br/>Other ways of getting influence in otherwise inaccessible guilds, is by marrying your daughters to one of the meeples already in that guild. By doing so you gain access to that guild as long as that daughter lives or if you have already sons working in that guild.<br/>Some guilds can only be accessed by bribing the master a fixed amount of money.<br/><br/>3. Wedding day: each clan marries as many daughters from the resource pool as they want and can afford. To marry your daughters you need to pay the dowry to the lucky husband-to-be.<br/>When choosing which husband in a guild you would like to marry, your clan needs to have someone (son or daughter) in a guild of the same class as the target one. For example, someone in a minor guild, can only marry someone in a minor guild, whereas someone in a major guild can marry anyone.<br/><br/>4. Pay day: in this phase salaries get paid, products get made and products get exchanged for money.<br/><br/>5. Time goes by: apprentices may become journeymen. Journeymen may become masters or keep improving their skills and maybe get a higher wage. Masters may improve their mastery and gain increased reputation and produce more products. Masters that  reached the highest in their career, when time goes by, will sadly pass away. Same applies to their wives, who will also suffer the same fate.<br/><br/>6. Going to the market: each player buys as many products as they want and can afford. They can also exchange certain products for different products as a barter according to the market table. They CANNOT sell products for money; only masters can sell their own products for money.<br/><br/>7. Adjusting turn order:  in turn order, and one at a time, players may exchange sets of products for licences (VP). Move the VP tracker for those players accordingly. Once all players have passed in sequence, the new starting player will be the one with the most VP at this point in time.<br/><br/>End of the game and scoring<br/>The game ends when all players run out of meeples as they have all passed away.<br/>The game also ends immediately if after one full turn, none of the guilds have any meeple on them but there are meeples in the clan or resource pools.<br/>The winner is the player with most Victory Points.<br/><br/>"}, "139845": {"poll": [], "name": "Monopoly: La France Agricole", "playingtime": "90", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": ["Card Drafting", "Dice Rolling", "Set Collection", "Trading"], "yearpublished": "2012", "usersrated": "0", "boardgamefamily": ["Country: France", "Monopoly"], "maxplayers": "8", "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1600373_t.png", "average": "0", "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["Winning Moves France"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1600373.png", "boardgameversion": ["First edition"], "maxplaytime": "90", "boardgamecategory": ["Dice", "Economic", "Negotiation"], "age": "8", "minplaytime": "90", "description": "The classic Monopoly with constructions and other elements from La France Agricole, a interest group (lobbying) for farmers in France.<br/><br/>"}, "139846": {"poll": [], "name": "Monopoly: Morbihan", "playingtime": "90", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": ["Card Drafting", "Dice Rolling", "Set Collection", "Trading"], "yearpublished": "2011", "usersrated": "0", "boardgamefamily": ["Country: France", "Monopoly"], "maxplayers": "8", "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1600371_t.png", "average": "0", "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["Winning Moves France"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1600371.png", "boardgameversion": ["First edition"], "maxplaytime": "90", "boardgamecategory": ["Dice", "Economic", "Negotiation"], "age": "8", "minplaytime": "90", "description": "A monopoly (from Greek monos &mu;\u03cc&nu;&omicron;&sigmaf; (alone or single) + polein &pi;&omega;&lambda;&epsilon;\u1fd6&nu; (to sell)) exists when a specific person or enterprise is the only supplier of a particular commodity.<br/><br/>Monopoly is a roll-and-move game where players move around the game board buying or trading properties, developing their properties with houses and hotels.

Each card bears a symbol &ndash; Rock, Paper, Scissors, Bomb &ndash; that makes the deck ideal for fans of Live Action Role Playing (as they often need some randomizing element during play).<br/><br/>What's more, each card contains one or more unique (and sometimes hidden) symbols, which allows the deck to be used for Succubus: The Reborn, the first title in the Party Poker RPG line of games which is playable by 8-90 players (with one deck needed for each ten players). One player serves as the Dealer, who oversees gameplay and leads others in what to do; everyone else is divided as evenly as possible into four teams, the teams being vampires who are members of four great Lineages represented by the four card suits:<br/><br/><br/>    Diamonds &ndash; The Marquisi (The Elite Ones) blend in among mortals that they might trade in money, power, and control, all while clinging to an old world sense of protocol and social decorum.<br/><br/><br/><br/>    Hearts &ndash; The Copeadora (The Beautiful Ones) are universally insane, but also very beautiful &ndash; a benefit which they utilize in order to slake their unholy thirsts at the necks of beautiful socialites and wealthy benefactors.<br/><br/><br/><br/>    Clubs &ndash; The Bas-Bazouk (The Outlaws) are the enforcers, criminals, anarchists, and street-toughs of the Vampire world, plying their wits and their supernatural strength to devastating effect in combat.<br/><br/><br/><br/>    Spades &ndash; Unlike other Vampires, the Profugos (The Forlorn) do not possess a soul; they are therefore cursed with deep, soulless, black eyes, and are prone to acts of immorality and depravity.<br/><br/><br/>Succubus: The Reborn is played over three acts, and in each act, players try to improve their hand of cards to create the best poker hand. In the first round players can trade however they wish amongst each other as long as each player always has five cards; if a player manages to trade away a joker, that player takes a card at random from the other person's hand instead of any card agreed upon. When the Dealer calls time, the player on each team with the highest card in that team's suit is the Captain, and all the Captains then compete in a single poker hand with the cards they hold, trying to win chips in the process.<br/><br/>From the second act on, players can trade cards with the Dealer for the cost of one chip, taking a random card from what remains in the deck. To trade cards in the second act, you trade in the same manner as the first act or you challenge another player, paying them a chip to do. In a challenge, each player chooses and reveals a card from his hand, with scissors beating bomb, which beats rock, and so on. The winner of the challenge decides whether or not to trade. For the third act, you can trade only with your teammates. After the second and third acts, each team Captain again competes in a poker hand, with the winner of the third such hand winning the entire game and bringing glory to his team.<br/><br/>Succubus: The Reborn includes a number of advanced rules that add quests, shadow symbols that allow for better trades with the dealer, character sheets that add special powers to the game, and more.<br/><br/>"}, "139948": {"videogame": ["LEGO Star Wars II: The Original Trilogy"], "poll": [], "name": "LEGO Star Wars: The Complete Saga (DS)", "videogamemode": ["Cooperative", "Network Multiplayer", "Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["Australian Nintendo DS edition", "English/European Nintendo DS edition", "North American Nintendo DS edition"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1115421.jpg", "videogameseries": ["LEGO Star Wars"], "videogametheme": ["Flight", "Movie, Book, TV show", "Science Fiction", "Space"], "videogamefranchise": ["LEGO", "Star Wars"], "videogamedeveloper": ["TT Fusion"], "videogamegenre": ["Action", "Adventure"], "videogameplatform": ["Nintendo DS"], "usersrated": "0", "average": "0", "statistics": [], "videogamepublisher": ["LucasArts"], "videogamecompilation": ["LEGO Star Wars II: The Original Trilogy"], "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1115421_t.jpg", "description": "Lego Star Wars: The Complete Saga is a video game based on the Star Wars-themed toy line by the Lego Group.

The Town sees a great deal of business pass in through its gates; river barges coming down from the lakes, seagoing merchant vessels and privateers, as well as caravans coming in from the Ust-Aan steppes. The town serves as a trading centre, a rest stop, and as a place to refit vessels, caravans and parties of adventurers. In Kalas dusky islanders, and ebony visitors from the Dark Continent mingle with steppe men, pale blonde barbarians from the north, and the swarthy, warm-eyed locals. Grass elves, their skins painted brown and green - grey elves from the forest, even sea elves from the shore bargain in the bazaar with Ebony dwarves from the desert, pale Dwarves from the north, leaf gnomes, marsh Halflings and the dark skinned Halfling wanderers from far distant veldts. Kalas is THE location for an adventuring party. Walking in from little villages off the river, or arriving by ship or caravan, the characters can begin to hunt about and purchase equipment, find a place to stay and have fun crawling the bars. Every location and every character here have been created with the potential for adventures! This is a sandbox adventure setting. Written by Paul Kidd the Town of Kalas is a wonderfully contained town setting easy to port to any game. It includes all the details on the town, with maps, as well as everything you need to on the major NPCs. The Town of Kalas is filled with hosts of adventure hooks good for long range campaigns or short one night adventures.<br/><br/>"}, "139979": {"videogame": ["P51 Mustang Flight Simulator", "PT-109", "Sub Battle Simulator"], "poll": [], "name": "Sea and Sky", "videogamemode": ["Network Multiplayer", "Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["North American Macintosh edition"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1602827.jpg", "videogametheme": ["War - World War II"], "usersrated": "0", "videogamedeveloper": ["Alliance Interactive"], "videogamegenre": ["Flight Simulator", "Simulation"], "videogameplatform": ["Macintosh"], "average": "0", "statistics": [], "videogamepublisher": ["Alliance Interactive", "TX Digital Illusions"], "videogamecompilation": ["P51 Mustang Flight Simulator", "PT-109", "Sub Battle Simulator"], "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1602827_t.jpg", "description": "User Summary<br/><br/>A Mac only compilation of three WWII-themed &quot;simulation&quot; games.

Kingdom Builder: Big Box ramps up this variability by including all expansions to date, ensuring you'll never play the same game twice!<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": ["English/German first edition", "German first edition", "Kickstarter edition"], "average": "7.68402", "name": "Kingdom Builder: Big Box", "playingtime": "45", "boardgamemechanic": ["Area Control / Area Influence", "Area Enclosure", "Grid Movement", "Modular Board", "Route/Network Building"], "age": "8", "boardgameexpansion": ["Kingdom Builder: Harvest", "Kingdom Builder: Marshlands", "Kingdom Builder: The Island"], "usersrated": "604", "boardgamefamily": ["Crowdfunding: Kickstarter", "Kingdom Builder", "Queen Big Box Series"]}, "139994": {"rpgartist": ["Randy Bathurst", "Doug Blanchard", "Amy K.
