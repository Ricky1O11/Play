Players gather minions great and small, ranging from Riff-Raff to Horrible Monsters, battle each other, and fend off attacks by occasional do-gooders (such as adventuring bands and small children). The game takes about an hour to play.<br/><br/>The goal is to eliminate all other players and become the Big Bad Overlord. Players start with six cards, half of which they can keep face-down. The face-up cards serve as the players' armies and can be used to attack other players. Each turn, players draw a new card and add it to their army. (Unless they draw a do-gooder, in which case the player has to fight it off!) There are three combat abilities - Mind control, Magic, and Melee. Most cards have at least one ability, and some have more. A successful Mind-control attack allows you to capture an enemy card; magic blows things up (especially cards weak against magic, such as the otherwise powerful Machines-O-Death); and melee allows you to chop things up.<br/><br/>Players fight each other using all available attacks, rolling 2 six-sided dice to determine the winner of each battle. Die rolls are modified according to the relative attack and defense strengths of each side's army in each combat category. But even the most lopsided of battles isn't in vain - a natural 12 always wins, no matter what the modifiers, and a natural 2 always fails.<br/><br/>In addition to the evil minions and do-gooders, the deck contains two magical artifacts. They're important because players need them to survive the endgame. When all the cards are drawn from the deck, only players who have an artifact survive. At that point, if two players are still in the game, there's a final battle in which the evil Dukes use the artifacts to smash each other's troops.<br/><br/>Players can gang up on each other, help each other defend against attack, backstab each other, and more. Defeat your foes, play them against each other, hoard a precious artifact or obtain one at all costs - Big Bad Overlord is a game where it's good to be bad.<br/><br/>"}, "199514": {"rpgitemversion": {"310372": "PDF Version"}, "poll": {}, "name": "Grind Them Down", "rpgproducer": {"91179": "Kevin Farnworth"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3007452.jpg", "usersrated": "0", "average": "0", "rpggenre": {"946": "Modern (Pop Culture)"}, "statistics": {}, "rpg": {"35492": "Grind Them Down"}, "rpgcategory": {"2083": "Core Rules (min needed to play)"}, "rpgseries": {"27642": "Game Chef 2015: A Different Audience"}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3007452_t.jpg", "description": "A depressing story game about humans who give up on their dreams<br/><br/>From the introduction:<br/><br/>This game is about people giving up on their dreams, due to unseen forces trying to ruin their lives.

Who doesn&rsquo;t want to fight a dragon, even if it is above your pay grade?<br/><br/>Dragons are Above My Pay Grade is an adventure for 3 &ndash; 6 first level PCs using the Pathfinder RPG rules. It is 23 pages long, fully illustrated and in color.<br/><br/>Sunstone Island seemed like the perfect opportunity.  Idyllic weather, pleasant beaches, docile animals, and, most importantly, a mine absolutely bursting with gold.  Peter Grimples, owner of the Grimples Mining Corporation, was so enthusiastic to exploit these virgin resources that he personally headed the mining colony on this remote island.<br/><br/>The volcano?  Looks pretty quiet.  The tribe of kobolds?  Nothing a group of wide-eyed heroes can&rsquo;t handle.<br/><br/>That is, until the kobolds resurrect the red dragon Varaug onto the island.  With reinforcements weeks away, suddenly the cheapest heroes money can buy don&rsquo;t seem quite up to the task.<br/>To combat this sudden and unexpected threat, the heroes must follow in the footsteps of the legendary native A&rsquo;uapa who slew Varaug many centuries ago.  Following the instructions of a turncoat kobold who would like nothing more than the death of the merciless dragon, the heroes collect the dragon-slaying tools of A&rsquo;uapa hidden across Sunstone Island.  These poisons, blessings, spells, and weapons are heavily guarded, sequestered in dungeons or protected by kobolds.  As the heroes traverse the island, following clues, unlocking riddles, and completing challenges, their already formidable adversary grows stronger and the colony town that they call home grows weaker.<br/><br/>Can the heroes collect enough dragon-slaying weapons to defeat Varaug before he destroys the mining colony along with any chance of future employment?  How could the party&rsquo;s first contract go so wrong?<br/><br/>Dragons Are above My Pay Grade features a mining town, a fleshed out island with wild beasts and tropical hazards, a range of mini-dungeons and challenges,  and a host of original enemies, spells, poisons, items, and traps.

The Druid, Calistin by name, befriended the local animals, encouraged the local plant life to grow and conceal his home, and conducted his research free of interference from other Druids, or anyone else for that matter. He experimented in human-animal hybrids, among other twisted past-times. His crowning achievement was a spell that would transform humans into a unique species of tree, while allowing the transformed subjects to retain full cognizance. Unfortunately, he was unable to perfect the spell, despite repeated attempts. Invariably, every human-turned-tree withered and died shortly after transformation, some lasting as much as a tenday and others less than twenty-four hours. It is possible that the spell itself was not flawed, and that the subjects simply succumbed to the shock of the event. (Calistin did not use volunteers interested in experiencing a tree&rsquo;s life, preferring instead to prey on small parties of travelers foolish enough to camp for the night within the Vale&rsquo;s confines.)

This mysterious installation, code named &ldquo;the Facility,&rdquo; uses unknown energies to morph and transform itself at will to keep horrid villains, dangerous creatures, alien entities, and top-secret research projects trapped within. Rumors of the Facility&rsquo;s existence and its most prized possessions have leaked, and the Valiant Universe&rsquo;s most powerful organizations&mdash;The Harbinger Foundation, the Renegades, GATE, and more&mdash;are taking an interest. The world may never be the same.<br/><br/>In Valiant Universe: The Deck-Building Game you command an organization attempting to seize the secret Alcatraz base. Purchase cards to craft a unique deck, and battle your way through the ever-changing Facility grid that moves during play to gain access to a card or damage another player. Maneuver your superhero miniatures to battle it out with other superheroes for ultimate control!<br/><br/>From the rules:<br/>&quot;Each player assumes the role of an<br/>Organization within the Valiant Universe,<br/>attempting to infiltrate the Facility and gain<br/>control while fighting off any other Organizations<br/>along the way.<br/>The Facility is abstractly represented by a grid<br/>of cards: 5 Levels (rows) x 5 Blocks (columns), for<br/>25 decks of cards. Each deck on this grid is known<br/>as a Sector.<br/>To gain ultimate control of the Facility, each<br/>player will play cards from their hands to deal<br/>damage to other Organizations and manipulate<br/>the cards in the grid&mdash;which represents the Facility<br/>morphing and changing. Players will also have the<br/>opportunity to purchase cards from their Zone of<br/>Influence (ZOI) on the Facility. Additionally, players<br/>can move their Superhero miniature around the<br/>Facility&rsquo;s Sectors to deal additional damage to<br/>Opponents, while making use of their Abilities on<br/>their Power card.<br/>Along the way, the Facility may also strike<br/>back at the players. As fighting rages throughout<br/>the underground complex, damage is also inflicted<br/>not just to Organizations but to the Facility as well,<br/>marked using the Facility Durability Tracker. As<br/>more damage is received, more Sectors<br/>go into shutdown, making those cards<br/>unavailable for purchase, as well as<br/>potentially causing damage to a player&rsquo;s<br/>Organization.<br/>As Organizations take damage, their<br/>Cohesion drops; a measure of their overall<br/>strength, morale, leadership, and ability to keep<br/>fighting. If an Organization&rsquo;s Cohesion ever drops<br/>to 0, they retreat from the Facility and are<br/>out of the game.<br/>The last player remaining in the game<br/>is the winner as they seize control of the<br/>Facility and its exotic treasures!&quot;<br/><br/>"}, "199592": {"statistics": {}, "name": "Space Moth DX", "videogamemode": {"2149": "Single-Player"}, "videogameversion": {"310494": "Windows Downloadable edition"}, "average": "0", "videogametheme": {"2658": "Aliens"}, "usersrated": "0", "videogamegenre": {"2505": "Shoot 'em Up"}, "videogameplatform": {"4977": "Windows"}, "poll": {}, "description": "Space Moth DX is an intense, old skool shoot 'em up featuring gorgeous pixel art, over 30 unique enemies, 5 massive stages and finger-blistering difficulty!<br/><br/>Source: The Developer Website.<br/><br/>"}, "199593": {"poll": {}, "boardgamedesigner": {"79222": {"name": "Christopher Brown"}}, "statistics": {}, "boardgamecompilation": {"199598": "Slaughterville: Jack the Ripper Expansion"}, "yearpublished": "2015", "maxplayers": "6", "boardgameartist": {"79222": "Christopher Brown"}, "boardgamepublisher": {"4": {"name": "(Self-Published)"}}, "maxplaytime": "120", "minplaytime": "60", "boardgamecategory": {"1022": {"name": "Adventure"}}, "description": "The following items came with the Kickstarter edition of Slaughterville.

The next time they'll play, each player is going to start with his own old deck and new cards will be available in the market (cards from Era II). After 5 games (5 eras), the player with the highest sum of points is the winner.<br/><br/>Fast mode: Use less copies of each card; players play a one-shot game purchasing cards from the market and refilling it with cards of the next eras. The player with the highest sum of points at the end of the single game is the winner.<br/><br/>The game mechanics are both similar and different from the original Dominion; basically, players can play a card and purchase a card from the market, as in Dominion. However, the market is a row of cards instead of different deck containing the same card in multiple copies. Moreover, there is only one type of card in the game. Each card has a point value, an effect, a cost, a colour, and can be discarded from hand together with other cards of the same colour to purchase a new card from the market. There are Leaders and Wonders too; Leaders are multicolour and have powerful effects while Wonders can be purchased at any time and they provide more ways to score extra points or other bonuses. Keep them separated from your deck.<br/><br/>In the Legacy mode: players choose and obtain a Leader at the end of each game, with the player with the highest score being the first to choose. Wonders can be purchased at any time (max. 1 per era) in place of a card of the market, and players keep all their Wonders until the end of the 5 eras.<br/><br/>"}, "199648": {"poll": {}, "name": "What of It?", "playingtime": "0", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": {"2004": "Set Collection"}, "yearpublished": "1889", "usersrated": "0", "maxplayers": "6", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3020501_t.jpg", "average": "0", "statistics": {}, "boardgamepublisher": {"32720": {"name": "Chapman & Smith Company"}}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3020501.jpg", "boardgameversion": {"310621": "First edition"}, "maxplaytime": "0", "boardgamecategory": {"1002": {"name": "Card Game"}}, "age": "0", "minplaytime": "0", "description": "Subtitled in the rules as &quot;A Game of Family Supplies&quot;, this 1889 card game is based on the familiar mechanics of Happy Families, where players try to assemble sets of cards by asking each other for cards related to ones they already hold.<br/><br/>In this case, the 40-card deck is divided into 10 sets (called orders) comprised of a variety of household ingredients.

The 60-card deck is divided into four suits of 15, each representing one of the four colleges. In addition to being numbered from 1 to 15, each suit contains cards with letters spelling out the name of its college. The object of the game is to complete the name of one of the four colleges using only the letters from its suit.<br/><br/>Players are dealt five cards each, and five more go face-up on the field between them. Each player on his turn has the opportunity to capture cards on the field by playing a card that adds up to the same number (e.g. a 13 can be played to capture a 9 and 4). He plays until unable to capture any more, and then adds one of the cards from his hand to the field. When a player exhausts his hand, he gets a new hand of five cards.<br/><br/>Players must declare which college they are playing for, and if there is competition for one, the first player to get the 15 of that suit takes over and the other player must go after a different college.<br/><br/>Letter cards of the desired college are placed in front of the player as successfully used or captured, and the remaining cards go into a discard stack which becomes the replacement deck when needed. While two colleges have only four letters (PENN and YALE), the values of the letter cards ensure that each college is as hard to complete as the others (e.g. PENN has letter cards of 12, 13, 14 and 15, while PRINCETON includes 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9 and 15).<br/><br/>"}, "199652": {"statistics": {}, "name": "The Excellent Travelling Volume (Issue 5 - Apr 2016)", "rpgproducer": {"76587": "Matt Hildebrand"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3016649.jpg", "usersrated": "0", "average": "0", "rpgissue": {"26865": "The Excellent Travelling Volume"}, "rpg": {"567": "Empire of the Petal Throne"}, "rpgissueversion": {"310632": "First Printing"}, "poll": {}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3016649_t.jpg", "description": "The Excellent Travelling Volume<br/>Issue #5<br/>April 2016<br/><br/>Cover art by Zhu Bajie.<br/><br/>"}, "199653": {"statistics": {}, "name": "Steel Rivals", "videogamemode": {"2313": "Cooperative"}, "videogameversion": {"310634": "Windows Downloadable Edition"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3008077.jpg", "videogametheme": {"2284": "Medieval"}, "usersrated": "1", "average": "4", "videogamegenre": {"2147": "Action"}, "videogameplatform": {"4977": "Windows"}, "poll": {}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3008077_t.jpg", "description": "User Summary<br/><br/>From an array of fighters and opponents (and backgrounds) you face off in a duel with special attacks.<br/><br/>"}, "199654": {"rpg": {"413": "Fighting Fantasy Gamebooks"}, "poll": {}, "name": "Return of the Centaurs", "rpgproducer": {"70079": "Martin Knight"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3009538.png", "usersrated": "0", "rpgitemversion": {"310635": "Return of the Centaurs PDF"}, "average": "0", "statistics": {}, "rpggenre": {"1013": "Fantasy (Sword & Sorcery)"}, "rpgcategory": {"2136": "Solitaire Adventure"}, "rpgseries": {"10604": "Fighting Fantasy Amateur Adventures"}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3009538_t.png", "description": "From publisher blurb:<br/><br/>The Centaurs have returned and are waging war on the three races again after almost three centuries.

He masquerades as a samurai and is talented in horsemanship, stealth, deception, and wilderness survival.<br/><br/>Because of heavy multiclassing, this character uses fractional base bonuses for both saving throw and base attack bonus progression.  See &ldquo;Fractional Base Bonuses&rdquo; section in Chapter 1 of Pathfinder&reg; Roleplaying Game: Pathfinder Unchained&trade; (PZO1131).<br/><br/>Product Overview<br/><br/>We love our fantasy villains.  We find them in films, on posters, in commercials, on snack foods, and even as action figures.  Our societies flirt and play with villains at a safe distance, and we adore them.  That same sense of awe and wonder can be captured by a player roleplaying an evil character.  It does not work for all gaming groups, but for those able to handle it, the experience can be rewarding.<br/><br/>This product can serve several purposes.  Some game groups dabble in evil adventures as a one-shot or short run campaign.  Others want to experiment with evil characters and add one or two in to see how it affects the game.  Still others fully embrace evil characters and find they sometimes need replacement characters after a sudden and unexpected character death.  For whatever reason you need a ready-to-play character sheet, this product is for you.<br/><br/>Welcome to Wicked Wanderers!  In this product, you will discover twenty complete stat blocks for a single PC, level 1 through 20, adhering to the Pathfinder&reg; Roleplaying Game rules.  The core format adheres to the standard non-player character (NPC) stat block most GMs are already familiar with minus the Tactics section.  This makes it easier for the GM to assist with finding information and also prepares the player for the day he or she is running games!  The Special Abilities section includes more detailed write-ups of feats and character abilities than a standard NPC stat block to facilitate faster play.  Sources for spells, races, classes, archetypes, and prestige classes from sources other than the Pathfinder&reg; Roleplaying Game Core Rulebook&trade; (PZO1110) are listed in the Sources section and can be referenced in the Pathfinder&reg; Roleplaying Game Reference Document.<br/><br/>On Evil Characters<br/><br/>Evil neither means &ldquo;stupid&rdquo; nor &ldquo;irrational.&rdquo;  Some evil campaigns implode because characters mistake an evil alignment for the inability to ever follow a rule or make a decision for the greater good.  Evil is an absent or inhibited sense of responsibility for the hurtful consequences of one&rsquo;s own actions for society or individuals that can lead to actions others would deem &ldquo;wrong.&rdquo;  This does not mean an evil character does not feel love or value lawful society or desire the betterment of mankind.  In the real world, there are many evil people who would never consciously describe themselves as such.  Evil characters can work together and form bonds of friendship.  They possess many of the same insecurities, fears, hopes, dreams, and goals as other people; however, they are more willing to go to extremes to fulfill their needs.  An evil character may disregard laws in his pursuit of his desires, but in a roleplaying game setting the player still must abide by the rules of the game:  the game is about the shared story of every character and each story is equally important.  Play the evil character, and have fun!  Make sure you allow your fellow players to have fun as well.<br/><br/>"}, "199701": {"rpg": {"2791": "Pathfinder System Compatible Product"}, "poll": {}, "name": "Avalon Spell Book 5", "rpgproducer": {"5349": "Robert Hemminger"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3009558.png", "usersrated": "0", "rpgitemversion": {"310760": "PDF version"}, "average": "0", "statistics": {}, "rpggenre": {"155": "Fantasy (High Fantasy)"}, "rpgcategory": {"2108": "Sourcebook (rules/options to enhance play)"}, "rpgseries": {"35157": "Avalon Spell Book"}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3009558_t.png", "description": "From publisher blurb:<br/><br/>Avalon takes a common spell and provides you with a number of alterations and additions to add excitement and useful options for your next adventure.  Each issue of Avalon Spell Books will focus on a new spell, discussing different versions of the spell, providing different components that can be used to alter the way the spell works, and even adding feats and new magical items linked to the spell in question.<br/><br/>Tree Shape. Most spellcasters do not even remember this spell exists except under some extraordinary circumstances.  Lacking any natural inclination towards serene photosynthesis, they use it when they need to stay motionless and unnoticed somewhere dangerous for many hours, or when their companions need a &ldquo;large, dead, tree trunk&rdquo; to get across a particularly nasty stream.<br/><br/>Or maybe when the group wants some shade in the middle of a desert.<br/><br/>Rooting and vegetating still offer more interesting experiences for patient spellcasters, ready to look for new magics in arboreal life. The first option of interest is the fact that a tree can sleep wherever it can root, ignoring many inconveniences that would give a humanoid a bad night. It is fully possible to sleep while being a tree, even getting a proper night&rsquo;s rest, provided the shapechange duration is long enough. Much like a normal sleeping character, the dormant tree has reduced Perception abilities. If the spell duration ends before the character gets enough rest, the event should be treated as any other hazardous awakening in the game.<br/><br/>Then there is using Tree Shape underwater. Yes, contrary to popular belief, one can do so&mdash;in this case the spell transforms the caster into a large kelp, firmly attached to the river- or seabed, instead of a common shrub. In case of any doubts, the Game Master may require the character to succeed at a Knowledge (nature) check DC 15 to choose a proper plant type in which to transform. Since kelp can &ldquo;breathe&rdquo; water perfectly, the caster does not need any additional means of water-breathing for as long as the spell duration lasts.<br/><br/>This and much more is discussed in this issue of Spell Books!<br/><br/>"}, "199702": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3010217.jpg", "poll": {}, "boardgamedesigner": {"90961": {"name": "Andrew G.

With more than 100 adventures in print and the single longest-running adventure module brand on the market, Goodman Games has established a track record for writing adventures that don&rsquo;t suck.<br/><br/>At Gen Con 2007 we ran a seminar called &ldquo;How To Write Adventure Modules That Don&rsquo;t Suck,&rdquo; which was packed to standing room only. This has quickly become one of our most popular Gen Con events. This year, we&rsquo;ve expanded our offerings to include this book of essays. Compiled from experienced adventure writers with multiple published adventure credits, these essays should provide tips to improve your adventure writing skills. We hope you benefit from improved home games and perhaps drive some quality submissions in our direction.<br/><br/>Regardless of the advice offered here or elsewhere, remember that the primary definition of an adventure that doesn&rsquo;t suck is one that your players enjoy. If your gaming group walks away happy and has stories to tell for years to come, it was a great adventure.

Settlements along the coast walk a thin line between land and sea, with farmers, fishermen, traders, and sellswords plying their trade alongside merchants, nobles, rogues, and adventurers.

However, space limitations required that I cut some details. The first list of names I wrote for a roleplaying game came years before then. While running a Star Wars game (WEG d6, 2nd Edition), I had to come up with a planet name in a hurry, and I named it &ldquo;Yaffa&rdquo; after the blocks, because it was on a commercial the group saw before playing the game. Afterwards, one of the players suggested I write a list of names of people and planets so I would not have to think of one in the moment. That is a trick<br/>I have used in every game I have run since. So, the first D66 lists I published were lists that I created for my own use.<br/><br/>No matter what edition of Traveller you play, this book is ideal for it. Additionally, this book can help you beyond the Traveller Roleplaying Game, in any science fiction roleplaying game.

You choose from 16 different Capos to manage a crew of street thugs to grow your criminal empire. All players play against one another competing for territory and control of the criminal market.  You will operate criminal establishments all while evading police and gunning your rivals into extinction.  You could even bribe police, judges, and city councilmen to work for you and leverage their positions of power to hinder your enemies!<br/><br/>Object of the game is to be the first gang to satisfy one of four different winning conditions before prohibition is repealed.  Winning conditions are as follows:<br/><br/>1. Control the largest criminal empire<br/>2. Bankrupt all rival gangs<br/>3. Kill three rival Capos<br/>4. Bribe all City Officials<br/><br/>A game round will consist of all players drawing an Event card which will consist of additional weapons or abilities.  Next, each player starting with the first player takes a turn moving their thugs and Capos to try to control as many illegal establishments as possible.  The more establishments you control the more money and more powerful your empire becomes.  If any rival gangsters work their way into your territory you could remove them by force.   This will consist of either a fight or a gun attack.  Both are resolved easily by rolling dice and adding the total.  At the end of each turn, the player will total up their income and make any purchases.<br/><br/>After each player has taken their turn, then the RAID phase will begin.  During the RAID phase, the first player will draw  a RAID card.  This could range from establishments being raided or having to accomplish a task to prevent something negative.  When the RAID phase is complete, then the Prohibition Chart moves down one level closer to repeal.  The player to the left becomes the new first player and the next round begins.<br/><br/>So get dressed in your best suit, put on a pot of spaghetti sauce, and don&rsquo;t forget your machine gun.

That card enters in Katnap and cannot attack or defend during this turn unless otherwise stated.<br/>Play any number of skratch cards you wish as long as you can afford the associated DKP cost.<br/>Play passes to your opponent.<br/><br/>Unlike other TCGs, 9DKP&rsquo;s 2 phases keep the turn lengths short and simple.

An adventure designed for four to five players from levels one to two. Smuggler's Run, once considered the primary pipeline for Corinthean contraband in the great City of Jor-Carmin, has been dormant for quite some time now. Officially claimed by Corinthea nearly 20 years ago when a toll was placed on the road; the farmhands and settlers along the old route have enjoyed peace and fair trade since, albeit heavily taxed. The humble villagers of Hamilton, who once would have to sneak their goods throughout the kingdom, now are simple farmers, traders, and craftsmen who are happy to play by the rules. Still, the dangers along Smuggler's Run have not entirely vanished. The players in this adventure are hired to investigate a lost caravan. What seems a simple task that any farmhand could do turns into something much more intriguing. The path to becoming a hero starts somewhere. The mysteries of Smuggler's Run may be more than just urban legends and are filled with more questions than answers, but will the players have the guile to investigate it's shady past?

Not so fast! You need to use secret signals to let your partner know when your device is ready to explode. Don&rsquo;t make it too obvious or you&rsquo;ll get caught. But if it&rsquo;s not obvious enough, your partner won&rsquo;t notice it&hellip; And don&rsquo;t forget to watch your opponents or you&rsquo;ll miss their secret signals!<br/><br/>Game Play: <br/>At the start of the game, each player gets a secret signal card, 3 explosives cards (the player's hand) and a stack of unknown explosives cards. To start a round, each player takes a card from the top of their stack and places it face up in the center of the table. Then the player tries to collect 3 of a kind by discarding a card from their hand and collecting one from the center of the table. There are no turns - players collect cards simultaneously. As soon as a player has 3 of a kind, he or she performs the secret signal described on the secret signal card (e.g. touch your nose, tap the table, etc...). If the player's partner sees the signal and shouts 'BOOM!' that team wins the round. If an opponent sees the signal and shouts 'SNIP!' the opponent's team wins the round. The first team to reach 10 points wins (7 points for a 6 player game).<br/><br/>Advanced strategies:<br/><br/>     Bluff! Send fake signals to make your opponents mistakenly say &lsquo;SNIP!&rsquo;. <br/>     Watch what explosives your opponents are collecting. Enjoy the look of surprise on their faces when you say &lsquo;SNIP!&rsquo; before they have even made their signal. <br/>     Alternatively, if you see an opponent collecting a particular explosive, grab it when it appears on the table before they manage to grab it themselves. <br/>     Even better, if you already have an opponent&rsquo;s card in your hand, play it and say &lsquo;SNIP!&rsquo; as soon as he or she picks it up. <br/>     You should also watch what your partner is collecting, maybe you have a card he or she can use. <br/>     Watch for players who aren&rsquo;t collecting any cards, they probably have collected 3 of a kind already. <br/>     Confuse your opponent by constantly dropping and collecting extra cards so that they can&rsquo;t see what explosives you are really collecting. <br/>     There are blank signal cards in the Signals deck. Make up your own signals. <br/>     For more advanced players - don&rsquo;t use the Signals deck at all! Each team makes up 3 Signals before the game and uses them from start to finish.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>"}, "199850": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3012506.jpg", "poll": {}, "boardgamedesigner": {"90961": {"name": "Andrew G.

It is played with a regular deck of playing cards, and two jokers, and a 4 by 4 grid that has each space holding a card face up.<br/><br/>The cards are dealt out face up and in the basic game, the players simultaneously look over the board and the first player who places their piece on the board determines the Trump suit by where they place their piece.  That player then needs to score more points than their opponent to win the round, or their opponent wins the round.  Game can play a set number of rounds or to a set number of points.  In the advanced variant of the game (recommended using after players played the game a few times), players would bid points in order to be able to determine Trump, to place their piece first, and also move first.<br/><br/>The basic play mechanics consist of players moving like a chess rook, not through an enemy piece, and landing on a card to play it. The card the player lands on is removed from the grid and played like it would out of a hand in a regular trick-taking game.  After the first player moved, their opponent must move to a card with the same suit as moved to if they can.  After this initial move and following by the two players, who won the trick is determined.  The player who won the trick then would then move before their opponent, making it possible for a player to get two moves in a row.  Player who wins the trick keeps all cards played for trick, and scores them at the end of the round/hand.<br/><br/>Scoring for a round (cards dealt onto the 4x4 grid), consists of 1 point per trick won.  In addition, if a player happened to win more cards in a suit than any other suit they won, the player scores one point for each of the cards in the suit they won of the most cards in.  In the case of where a player has had at least two suits tie for the most cards they won in it, then the player doesn't score any bonus points.  This score for the round is only used to determine if the player won the round.<br/><br/>"}, "199856": {"statistics": {}, "name": "Game of Thrones (2015)", "videogamemode": {"2149": "Single-Player"}, "videogameversion": {"311011": "North American PlayStation 4 edition"}, "average": "5.9625", "videogameseries": {"26449": "Game of Thrones - A TellTale Game Series"}, "videogametheme": {"2350": "Movie, Book, TV show"}, "usersrated": "8", "videogamegenre": {"2152": "Adventure"}, "videogameplatform": {"21674": "PlayStation 4"}, "poll": {}, "videogamecompilation": {"178236": "Game of Thrones -  Episode 4: Sons of Winter"}, "description": "User Summary<br/><br/>Only the first 5 episodes are on disc.

The mighty Realm spreads out from the center of Creation, oppressing all other nations into the service of its rulers, the Dragon-Blooded, a family of ten thousand nobles commanding the power of the elements.<br/><br/>But the Dragon-Blooded are not alone in their power. They are but the most numerous of the Exalted - heroes granted the divine power of the gods - and those they overthrew long ago to claim rulership of Creation have now returned. You are one of the Solar Exalted, carrying the power of the mightiest of the gods into a world that has been taught to hate you and to hunt you. But yours is the power to smash armies, bind demons, devour ghosts, and make the mountains weep with a song, and you are not alone.

Each tile has six symbols on it and no two tiles are the same. Players compete to build the biggest honeycomb possible. To build a honeycomb, players connect two tiles by matching their symbols. Don&rsquo;t forget to keep an eye out for the honeybee. It is wild and can be connected with any other symbol. One point is awarded for every connection made.  honeycombs&trade; has three distinct ways to play, each varying in its speed and competitiveness. Choose the one that&rsquo;s right for your group.<br/><br/>Game Option A &ndash; Worker Bee<br/>Each player receives 13 tiles and races to build their own honeycomb before their opponents build theirs. Once the first player has completed their honeycomb all other player must stop building immediately. However, finishing first doesn&rsquo;t necessarily mean you have won because another player may have made more matches than you and therefore have more points. In a nutshell, players are racing to finish their honeycomb first but also to make the most matches. So grab your tiles and get busy.<br/><br/>Game Option B &ndash; One Big Honeycomb<br/>Players earn individual points as they build one big honeycomb. Players take turns placing one tile at a time until all tiles have been used. During each turn, players place one tile anywhere on the honeycomb earning 1 point for every symbol they match.  Since each tile has 6 symbols, there is a possibility of earning up to 6 points per turn. So, &lsquo;bee&rsquo; strategic on where you place your tiles.<br/><br/>Game Option C &ndash; Honeycomb Puzzle<br/>One or more players work at a leisurely pace to build a honeycomb puzzle.  Like a traditional puzzle, there is no time limit or taking turns; everyone works together simultaneously. Unlike a traditional puzzle, tiles can be moved from one position to another at any time, by any player. You&rsquo;re finished when all the tiles are connected to everyone&rsquo;s satisfaction.

The Card Game of Oz introduces an innovative new game system called the Storyline Game System that adds strategy to your challenging and fun adventures through Oz. Each player takes on the role of an author attempting to construct the best story in the world of Oz. During the game, players will attempt to bring together objects, characters and locations that are appropriate together - for example, the Tin Woodman and his Oil Can - while avoiding hazards like the field of poppies and terrible beasts and villains like the Kalidahs or the Wicked Witch of the West. Each round players roll a special set of dice to determine the number of points they have for drawing and playing cards. The number of dice increases during the game, allowing the game to scale naturally while you play. The game ends when a player is able to move a Prime character - that is, one of the main characters of the story - from her Title card all the way to The End, but doing so is no simple race because the character who triggers the endgame is worth no points toward victory. Featuring hundreds of fascinating characters, events, and vistas, Oz is a world that has stood the test of time. Construct an iconic tale that is all your own!<br/><br/>This expansion has three new pre-constructed story packs.

Monstrous invaders are gathering at the borders, aiming to invade and plunder the realm! Your king has chosen you to take charge of a province on the border; you will manage your province and help defend the realm. To accomplish this, you must influence the King's advisors and the Royal Family to obtain gold, wood, stones, and soldiers to expand and defend your lands. But you are not the only governor seeking the aid of the advisers! The other players also seek to collect the best resources for their own territories.<br/><br/>King Tritus is waiting for you. Will you be able to be the most influent and powerful governor of the realm?<br/><br/>The game of Kingsburg takes place over five years, a total of 20 turns. In every year, there are three production seasons for collecting resources, building structures, and training troops. Every fourth turn is the winter, in which all the players must fight an invading army. Each player must face the invaders, so this is not a cooperative game.<br/><br/>The resources to build structures and train troops are collected by influencing the advisers in the King's Council.  Players place their influence dice on members of the Council, and each adviser awards different resources or allocate soldiers, victory points, and other advantages to the player who was able to influence that adviser for the current turn. The player with the lowest influence dice sum is the first to choose where to spend their influence; this acts as a way of balancing poor dice rolling. Even with a very unlucky roll, a clever player can still come out from the Council with a good number of resources and/or soldiers.<br/><br/>At the end of five years, the player who best developed their assigned territory and most pleased the King through the Council wins.<br/><br/>Kingsburg (Second Edition) includes six expansion modules for use with the base game.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": {"354908": "Chinese first edition"}, "name": "Kingsburg (Second Edition)", "playingtime": "120", "boardgamemechanic": {"2072": "Dice Rolling"}, "average": "7.31818", "usersrated": "11", "age": "10"}, "199967": {"rpgitemversion": {"311205": "PDF Version"}, "statistics": {}, "name": "Succession: being a tale yet untold, of myth, might, and mystery", "rpgproducer": {"3": "(Uncredited)"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3015102.png", "usersrated": "0", "average": "0", "rpggenre": {"961": "Fantasy"}, "rpg": {"35740": "Succession"}, "rpgcategory": {"2083": "Core Rules (min needed to play)"}, "poll": {}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3015102_t.png", "description": "From the designer's marketing materials:<br/><br/>Succession is a lightweight, narratively focused fantasy roleplaying game for creating and exploring a dark, dangerous world as your adventurers embark on their quests.

The gods are the main element defined in the setting you and your friends will create, and while none is purely good or evil, each god has difficult tenets to adhere to, and in return each offers a chance for greatness.<br/><br/>Your god will strongly influence your life, as you overthrow tyrants, traverse and tame frightening landscapes, explore forgotten temples, and defend your home and people from conquest, plague, and worse.

Resolution uses ordinary six-sided dice, and a typical session lasts four hours, including setup and character creation.<br/><br/>Succession is intended for 'GMless' play, in which every player has some of the responsibilities and privileges of a traditional GM, however the rules will still work if your group prefers to use a more conventional GM/player division.<br/><br/>Will you stand by as your world crumbles?

Set in the village of Plonk on the world of Epigaea, this adventure picks up where the introduction to Epigaea leaves off. Garvin the Minstrel spoke truly: the sages have arrived. Well, not quite. Perhaps if goblin bandits hadn't waylaid them along the way... Moon of the Goblin Sage presents a complete adventure that can start a DCU campaign or fit nicely into an existing one. It has new monsters, new magic items and a complete example of the DCU dungeon generator.<br/><br/>"}, "199975": {"statistics": {}, "name": "Houserule (Issue 1 - Jun 2015)", "rpgproducer": {"6999": "Duncan Timiney"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3015340.jpg", "usersrated": "0", "average": "0", "rpgissue": {"35593": "Houserule"}, "rpgissuearticle": {"181760": "Archetypes (5e)"}, "rpg": {"1789": "4e Game System Product (D&D 4.0 Compatible)"}, "rpgissueversion": {"311218": "PDF Version"}, "poll": {}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3015340_t.jpg", "description": "Houserule<br/>Issue 1<br/>June 2016<br/><br/>The D&amp;D Wiki<br/>Magic<br/><br/>"}, "199976": {"statistics": {}, "name": "Houserule (Issue 2 - Sep 2015)", "rpgproducer": {"6999": "Duncan Timiney"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3015344.jpg", "usersrated": "0", "average": "0", "rpgissue": {"35593": "Houserule"}, "rpgissuearticle": {"181786": "Author Index"}, "rpg": {"1789": "4e Game System Product (D&D 4.0 Compatible)"}, "rpgissueversion": {"311219": "PDF Version"}, "poll": {}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3015344_t.jpg", "description": "Houserule<br/>Issue 2<br/>September 2015<br/><br/>The D&amp;D Wiki<br/>Magic Weapons<br/><br/>"}, "199977": {"statistics": {}, "name": "Houserule (Issue 3 - Mar 2016)", "rpgproducer": {"6999": "Duncan Timiney"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3015348.jpg", "usersrated": "0", "average": "0", "rpgissue": {"35593": "Houserule"}, "rpgissuearticle": {"181801": "Author Index"}, "rpg": {"1789": "4e Game System Product (D&D 4.0 Compatible)"}, "rpgissueversion": {"311220": "PDF Version"}, "poll": {}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3015348_t.jpg", "description": "Houserule<br/>Issue 3<br/>March 2016<br/><br/>The D&amp;D Wiki<br/>Castles<br/><br/>"}, "199978": {"statistics": {}, "name": "Houserule (Issue 0 - Mar 2015)", "rpgproducer": {"6999": "Duncan Timiney"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3015353.jpg", "usersrated": "0", "average": "0", "rpgissue": {"35593": "Houserule"}, "rpgissuearticle": {"181807": "Archetypes (5e)"}, "rpg": {"1789": "4e Game System Product (D&D 4.0 Compatible)"}, "rpgissueversion": {"311221": "PDF Version"}, "poll": {}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3015353_t.jpg", "description": "Homebrew<br/>Issue 0<br/>March 2015<br/><br/>The D&amp;D Wiki<br/>Fire<br/><br/>Although Issue 0 was titled &quot;Homebrew&quot; the periodical's name was changed to &quot;Houserule&quot; almost immediately.<br/><br/>"}, "199979": {"boardgamedesigner": {"91808": {"name": "Patrick Little"}}, "poll": {}, "name": "Trigger Discipline", "playingtime": "60", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": {"2046": "Area Movement"}, "yearpublished": "2017", "usersrated": "3", "boardgamefamily": {"22184": "Admin: Unreleased Games"}, "maxplayers": "4", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3028563_t.png", "average": "7.66667", "statistics": {}, "boardgamepublisher": {"32778": {"name": "Dinogami Games"}}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3028563.png", "boardgameversion": {"311222": "First edition"}, "maxplaytime": "60", "boardgamecategory": {"1002": {"name": "Card Game"}}, "age": "13", "minplaytime": "30", "description": "One by one, the Capulan city-states have fallen, and risen again under a single banner&hellip;<br/>To the West, the machinists of the Uhrstadt demand autonomy&hellip;<br/>To the North, the ancient Chonokhat clans swear to die before they kneel&hellip;<br/>The balance of power is delicate, and the will of a few will decide the fate of the land&hellip;<br/>Take part in the duels of these heroes, the greatest fighters ever to live&hellip;<br/>Take part in the exciting combat of &ldquo;Trigger Discipline&rdquo;<br/><br/>Trigger Discipline is a fast-paced, mix-and-match, tactical card game set in the world of Gevahlt.

Like other major national powers the United States was finding that maintaining a space navy capable of defending her interstellar colonies was an expensive exercise and the hoped for economic offset from those colonies was, in reality, much lower than the projected outcomes had promised. In order to reduce the operating costs of the fleet without reducing its strength, it was determined that a smaller and thus less operationally expensive warship class was needed.<br/><br/>In 2293 Congress authorized the construction of the Strikemaster-class brig. The selection of the classification of &ldquo;brig&rdquo; caused some surprise as the US had not operated a brig for over four hundred years, that role, back in the age of sail, being replaced by fast frigates and corvettes. However, the use of the hull classification was revived with the new design performing exactly the same roles as those larger vessels but at a much reduced cost.<br/><br/>Ships of Clement Sector 13: Strikemaster-class Brig comes complete with beautiful views of the ship.  The prospector is presented with full deckplans and statistics to make your use of our product simple, easy and fun. In addition, the ship comes with a set of adventure hooks to get your characters right into the action as well as a short story written by Bradley Warnes.<br/><br/>Though designed specifically with our Clement Sector setting in mind, this ship could easily be used in any science fiction setting.<br/><br/>Get on board!
