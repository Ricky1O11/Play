The object of the game is to capture the highest total of numbered yellow tokens, without your own token being captured by your opponent. The tokens are designed so that they can be easily pressed together, so that the players' red and blue tokens gradually accumulate a stack of yellow tokens underneath them as the game progresses.<br/><br/>The board consists of ten circles, connected by lines in a geometric pattern. There are two variant configurations, one printed on each side of the cloth bag. The game is played in two phases: firstly, each player alternately places one numbered token on a circle until all ten have been placed; secondly players take turns moving their red or blue token along the lines from circle to circle, capturing tokens as they move, until either all ten numbered tokens have been captured - or one player has blundered allowing their own token to be captured! The advantage of going first is mitigated by placing an upper limit on the first token that the starting player may capture - in the basic game, this is fixed at 6; in the advanced game this is decided by auction.<br/><br/>"}, "207562": {"rpgartist": ["Anthony Cournoyer"], "rpgitemversion": ["PDF Version"], "poll": [], "name": "War Machines of the 21st Century Volume 1: Robots", "rpgdesigner": ["Mark Gedak", "David Jarvis", "J.

Every wargamer knows this battle was a severe Allied setback. What is not obvious, however, is that Allied troops on the ground gave a good account of themselves against the remnants of Rommel's vaunted Afrika Korps, despite the ineffective and confused leadership that existed at Corps level.<br/><br/>In the end, while GIs and Tommies fought their guts out to make up for the mistakes of their leadership, the advantages achieved by initial Axis successes were allowed to blow away in the wind by an equally detached and confused Axis High Command. In its case, how to best exploit the results of their initial attack depended on an argument raging within the Italian Commando Supremo and the persuasive abilities of Albert Kesselring and Erwin Rommel. After much discussion and the loss of several crucial days, the Axis decided on the less ambitious plan, which was itself no longer even possible.<br/><br/>Baptism By Fire is the second game in the Battalion Combat Series, which took players by storm with its block buster initial release Last Blitzkrieg. The game is designed as a more accessible entry to the system for those who want something smaller and faster than the earlier monster game. Here the wide open desert, limited number of Formations, and short scenario length provide players with a rapid and fun introduction to the series, the chance to develop their play skills to become a more effective BCS player overall, and to take a good look at this poorly understood battle.<br/><br/>Once again, the masterful order of battle research by Carl Fung showcases the forces involved with more fine detail than ever before. As a result, the common misconceptions of hapless GIs and Afrika Korps supermen is put to rest.<br/><br/>To give players a better feel for the pulse of the battle, the Germans run rampant for a few turns but then must idle back for several more while their commanders figure out what the overall objective will be. The player selects this objective randomly in the middle of the game, and it determines his Victory Conditions. This precludes the Axis player from overusing his limited combat power beforehand (since he might be going down the wrong road, literally) and keeps the Allies off balance as they must protect against both possibilities.<br/><br/>With a campaign game of only 10 turns, multiple plays are readily possible and various strategies for both sides can be explored.<br/><br/>Scenarios:<br/>Kasserine Campaign, 2 maps, 10 Turns<br/>Operation Spring Wind, 1 map, 4 Turns<br/>Mid-Campaign Start, 2 maps, 5 Turns<br/>Between a Rock and a Hard Place, 1 map, 5 Turns<br/>End Campaign Start, 2 maps, 3 Turns<br/>High Water Mark, 1 map, 3 Turns<br/>Components:<br/><br/>BCS rulebook (version 1.1, in full color)<br/>Two BCS Charts and Tables<br/>BCS Crib Notes Booklet<br/>BBF Game Specific rulebook<br/>Two 22&rdquo; x34&rdquo; Full Color Game Maps<br/>560 Counters (one sheet of units and one BCS marker sheet)<br/>6 scenarios total, 3 one-map scenarios<br/>Box and Dice<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "1", "boardgameversion": ["First Edition"], "age": "0", "name": "Baptism By Fire: The Battle of Kasserine", "playingtime": "0", "boardgamemechanic": ["Dice Rolling", "Hex-and-Counter", "Simulation"], "average": "9.13125", "usersrated": "16", "boardgamefamily": ["Battalion Combat Series (BCS)"]}, "207569": {"rpgdesigner": ["Sharang Biswas", "Stephen Bugg", "Lea Culliton", "Mike Elliott", "Steve Ellis (I)", "Rob Herman", "John Kaufeld", "Rebecca Kaufeld", "Steve Kenson", "Jon Leitheusser", "Nate Murray", "Mim Paquin", "Bryan Pope", "Thomas Riccardi", "Gutier Lusqui\u00f1os Rodr\u00edguez", "Olivia Ryan", "Max Seidman", "Philip Smith", "Eric Steiger", "Jane Trudeau-Smith", "Joey Vigour", "Cassidy Werner"], "statistics": [], "name": "Game Trade Magazine (Issue 198 - Aug 2016)", "rpgartist": ["John Kovalic"], "rpgproducer": ["Matt Barham", "Jerome Gonyeau", "Todd A.

You will never know for sure how your units will respond until they are needed.<br/><br/>Although casualties can be caused by artillery and heavy weapons (which makes them prime battlefield targets), squads will never cause significant casualties shooting at range at dug in, first line troops. Their goal is to fire and maneuver. Sections of the enemy force must be pinned down and eliminated from up close. The system itself forces this realistic play.

But apart from this primary role, hospital ships such as the Milligan-class have a wide variety of secondary roles, often tasked to provide emergency response support where needed. They are in reality fully equipped mobile hospitals that are able to bring medical care directly to the location most needed.<br/><br/>Being only armed with sandcaster turrets and a point defense node array the Milligan-class relies on her ship&rsquo;s identification beacon to announce her non-combatant, humanitarian role within naval service.

However, they don't get far before they hear the distant howling of wargs. And where the warg howls, there also the orc prowls.<br/><br/>The new scenario in Race Across Harad pits the heroes against these wargs and their riders, all within the treacherous wilds of Harad. Their towering oliphaunts may give the heroes an advantage, however, even their oliphaunts cannot keep the heroes safe for long from the warg-riders and their barbed arrows. Instead, their only choice is to quicken their pace and race toward the Ford of Harnen. There, the heroes' massive oliphaunts might be able to crash through waters too deep for the wargs to cross&hellip;<br/><br/>Featuring scenario-specific rules that allow the Orcs and wargs to pursue the heroes from their own staging area, Race Across Harad brings this frantic chase to life in dramatic fashion, as you and your friends need to progress through your quest stages more quickly than the Orcs progress through their own.<br/><br/>Simultaneously, the Adventure Pack introduces a new D&uacute;nedain hero in the Lore sphere, as well as three copies each of nine different player cards that enhance a wide range of the game's existing keywords, Traits, and mechanics.

But sometimes, it can be fun to take on the mantle of the otherworldly, and to embrace the alien terrors of the cosmos. Each installment of Weekly Wonders: Eldritch Archetypes contains five archetypes for eldritch characters&mdash;those that are weird, alien, and otherworldly, who don&rsquo;t fit in with normal society&mdash;as well as a cleric domain devoted to a specific mythos entity or race.<br/><br/>For this book, we focus on Yog-Sothoth. One of the most frequently used of H.P. Lovecraft&rsquo;s creations, Yog-Sothoth first appeared in The Case of Charles Dexter Ward. A being of unimaginable power, Yog-Sothoth is said to be coterminous with all of time and space, and yet somehow outside it. The archetypes presented in this book, whether they reference Yog-Sothoth directly or not, adhere to themes of teleportation and space-time manipulation, as well as the creation of gates and portals. This book contains the following archetypes:<br/><br/>    The dimensional sharpshooter, a gunslinger archetype that can fire bullets that phase through obstacles, or even make their bullets cause their victims to teleport to strange and far-off places.<br/>    The disciple of Yog-Sothoth, a monk archetype that can teleport himself and his foes, and whose touch can cause blindness, insanity, or even cause the creature to merge with Yog-Sothoth itself.<br/>    The servant of Umr-at-Tawil, a paladin archetype that can see the future and warp the fabric of reality in close proximity.<br/>    The keyholder, a summoner archetype, that specializes in summoning aberrations, rather than outsiders, and can teleport his eidolon and summoned creatures around the battlefield.<br/>    The Yog-Sothoth&rsquo;s blade, a swashbuckler archetype that can teleport up to foes and deliver nasty surprise attacks, or even freeze victims in time.<br/>    A bonus cleric domain devoted to those who worship Yog-Sothoth.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>"}, "207641": {"rpgdesigner": ["Cliff Billing", "Kevin Cowtan", "Eddie Curtis", "Louise Holden", "Richard Lambert", "Derek Muir", "David O'Rourke (II)", "Mike Sanderson", "Chris Terry", "Martin Wykes"], "statistics": [], "name": "Aslan International Issue #11", "rpgartist": ["Eddie Curtis"], "rpgproducer": ["Andrew Rilstone"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3154798.jpg", "usersrated": "0", "average": "0", "rpgissue": ["Aslan"], "rpgissuearticle": ["Arthur, Greg and Me", "Coconuts: The Lettercolumn", "Could do better", "Eureka!

You will build railroads, establish stations in your connected cities, expand the network of telegraph lines, and chase your objectives, increasing the value of your company with every action you take.<br/><br/>You start with mainly a team of non-specialized workers, but during the game you can hire additional ones with specific skill sets. The cost or effect of an action is determined by the type of worker that does it. To complete your company objectives, you will have to remove some of your workers from your active pool, promoting them to managerial positions. You must carefully assign each of your workers to perform the right action at the right time in order to exploit their specializations in the best way. You need to decide which ones to promote and which are instead still needed to take actions, as your priorities will change from turn to turn.<br/><br/>Railroad Revolution is a fast paced game with relatively simple rules, and it provides you with interesting and challenging decisions.

Its a comprehensive World War 2 system aimed at historical accuracy, balance and fun. The rules have been streamlined over the years, and we would consider it &quot;fast play&quot; - Its quick, brutal and rewards bold commanders with sound tactics.<br/><br/>Ostfront covers Infantry, Light Vehicles, all varieties of Tanks and Self-Propelled guns, Artillery in the form of Field Guns and Howitzers, Air Support and Air defense, as well various other forms of support and fortifications. It can be played in any theater of WW2, from North Africa to the Pacific. Aimed at 1/72, 1/100 or smaller scale miniatures. It would also work fine for 28mm.<br/><br/>The Ostfront system is all about combined arms - it plays at a Company to Battalion level, with the smallest unit being the Infantry Platoon. Infantry are deployed in bases, each one representing about 25 men for regulars, and about 10 men for the veteran Assault Infantry units. At 1/72 scale we usually use 3-4 miniatures per base, meaning you can make a large amount of bases from any cheap infantry box - one airfix box of 48 miniatures would give you 10 bases.<br/><br/>Tanks are of course a large part of Ostfront battles, with the average game fielding anywhere from 1 to 20 of them per side, sometimes more in larger games. Light vehicles play an important role, and reconnaissance has a tangible effect in-game - he who scouts out the area first can gain a tactical advantage.<br/><br/>We Split WW2 into 3 periods, allowing balanced battles to be fought and still capture the feelings of operations like Barbarossa and Operation Torch. Its not always about who has the most heavy tanks - in fact heavy tanks are somewhat expensive in the points system, due to the difficulty with which they were produced, maintained and transported. During early war players will need to rely on light tanks, Infantry, Artillery and air strikes to secure their objectives. Mid war covers Kursk style battles - with the Tiger, Panther and Sherman all making an appearance, but before heavier Soviet tanks like the IS-2 or T-34/85 had come into action. Late war covers all the late war toys, from the JagdTiger and Tiger II to the Pershing, to the aforementioned IS-2, among many others.<br/><br/>Ostfront also has a campaign system for combination map-and-tabletop play, allowing you to get that glorious combination of grand strategy and tabletop tactics. The campaign allows up to 5 players to go head-to-head on a map of Europe and North Africa, from Spain to Russia, Scandinavia to Egypt. Each faction fights to control production centres - where they produce more forces each turn, and to spread their supply lines out to the places they need to conquer. A technology race is also implemented, with players who control Tech Centres able to produce slightly more advanced units - even extending to post war tanks if the game is currently in late war - ever wanted a good reason to use a Maus or IS-3? Well here's your chance.<br/><br/>Every time forces make contact on the Campaign map, an Ostfront tabletop battle is fought, with the amount of points on the campaign map dictating how many points you can use in your table top battle. After the battle the results are applied to the Campaign: if you lost 50% of your forces during the game, your force on the Campaign map will also lose 50%. If you were able to win the objectives and cut off your enemies supply train on the table, you will be able to force him back on the campaign map.<br/><br/>This connectedness makes each tabletop battle have a purpose, and adds a lot of flavor to the game as a whole. You might know you're horribly outnumbered, but you need to give the enemy force a bloody nose while you wait for your main force and your allies to come to your aid, and so you will build a specific list for that game, and that purpose. The campaign also allows for combined attacks, out-flanking maneuvers, encirclement and cutting off of supply lines, and a free-form diplomacy system is also implemented.<br/><br/>Two Campaign maps are available for free download, one is a balanced map for a slightly ahistorical but balanced campaign. The other is a realistic map for a  more accurate WW2 campaign.<br/><br/>"}, "207780": {"poll": [], "name": "Our USA: Products and Resources", "playingtime": "0", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": ["Roll / Spin and Move"], "yearpublished": "0", "usersrated": "0", "boardgamefamily": ["Country: USA"], "maxplayers": "4", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3160811_t.jpg", "average": "0", "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["Selchow & Righter"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3160811.jpg", "boardgameversion": ["First edition"], "maxplaytime": "0", "boardgamecategory": ["Educational"], "age": "7", "minplaytime": "0", "description": "This was an educational game from Selchow and Righter that was part of a series of at least 3 &quot;Our USA&quot; games.

Your task will be to take decisions which satisfy the residents and indicate the direction of the development of the city, and at the same time avoid bringing it to bankruptcy.<br/><br/>This experiment may reveal new future leaders, so, even if you do not succeed, this game might be the beginning of something fantastic, both for you and the entire world.<br/><br/>CreaCity is a live action board game, during which players take on the role of councillors during the meetings of the Small City Council.<br/><br/>Each player will receive their character card stating their objectives and the committee they belong to. Each round of the game means very intense 45 minutes, during which committee members will be entrusted with Small and Big Challenges. It is these Challenges that CreaCity will be based on and, depending on the decisions taken by the players, the situation in the city will be changing.<br/><br/>The city is symbolized by a map divided into 8 regions. There are two dice placed in each region: a satisfaction dice (blue) and a dissatisfaction one (red).<br/><br/>Every time players take a binding decision, its effects will be transferred onto the board &ndash; satisfaction in the region will change (by changing the values on the dice), general satisfaction in the city and the available budget will change as well, and special buildings will appear.<br/><br/>Players start with a high degree of social trust and their decisions are aimed at gaining the largest general satisfaction possible. Af ter 5 rounds the game ends and the players check who accomplished the greatest number of objectives. Depending on the condition of the city, the entire Small Council receives appropriate number of victory points<br/><br/>GAME OBJECTIVES<br/>For a period of 5 rounds you must not let the city go bankrupt. It happens when:<br/><br/>     on the board, there will be 5 region bankruptcy tags.<br/>     The Dissatisfaction Tag will cross field number 30.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>What is more, fight for your personal result and accomplish your objectives.<br/><br/>"}, "207852": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3160856.png", "poll": [], "boardgamedesigner": ["Aaron Weissblum"], "statistics": [], "yearpublished": "2016", "maxplayers": "5", "boardgameartist": ["Gaetan Noir"], "boardgamepublisher": ["ABBA Games"], "maxplaytime": "0", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3160856_t.png", "minplaytime": "30", "boardgamecategory": ["Adventure", "Aviation / Flight", "Card Game"], "description": "When you leave the airship for treasure and the captain succeeds in the next leg of the voyage you may shoot your grappling hook and get back on board.

It is shared by both players to draw cards. There are 20 different kinds of units in the deck and these units are commanded onto the battlefield. Each unit has an ATTACK and a DEFENSE value. These values are used to dominate (attack) and hold (defend) a column. Some units also have ABILITIES (band, flank, rage, rally, and support) which give units additional skills than these two.<br/><br/>The battlefield is divided into five sections. Each section is called a &quot;column&quot; and players compete to dominate those columns. To dominate a column a unit's ATTACK must be at least equal to the unit's DEFENSE that is holding it.<br/><br/>Players have 10 Command Points (CP) for each round and they can command as many units as they please -provided they don't go over CP.

A little lying, some stealthy scheming, and the sense to know a good time to tell the truth might just help give a leg up over the rest of the herd. Who will out-law the other applicants to become the new deputy?<br/><br/>OutLawed! is a social game of bluffing, truth-telling, and out-thinking your opponents. Each player has an identical set of eleven outlaw cards imagined as animals escaped from the zoo somewhere in the wild, wild west. Over a series of rounds, players take turns playing a card face down and making a claim about which character card they played. Players are free to tell the truth about the character played or to make a bold-faced lie! After players have played cards and made their claims, all the characters are revealed and each player assesses whether or not they have met their outlaw's &quot;apprehend if&quot; condition. Players who were successful add their outlaws to their jail pile while all other players place the card back in their hand. Lionel Manesworth, for example, can be captured only if you tell the truth. The Vixen Twins get nabbed when others are convinced to play the same card during the round. Lawman Croc Holliday will catch anybody who isn't on the up and up.<br/><br/>Once a player fills up their jail, everyone compares their total reward value of apprehended cards to see who has earned the most rewards and gets to fill the vacant position as deputy of Bandit Bluff.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": ["English first edition"], "average": "7.025", "name": "OutLawed!", "playingtime": "30", "boardgamemechanic": ["Hand Management"], "age": "10", "usersrated": "28", "boardgamefamily": ["Admin: Unreleased Games", "Crowdfunding: Kickstarter"], "boardgamepodcastepisode": ["#42: A Trip to Asheville, Herbaceous on Tap, Well Played games cafe, Dream Home, OutLawed, Heroes &amp; Tricks and lots more", "The First Roll - What's New on Kickstarter? - Episode 66: Thursday, September 15th", "WDYPTW Conversation Thing Ep 96.14"]}, "207884": {"boardgamedesigner": ["Francesco Berardi"], "poll": [], "name": "MasterChef Junior", "playingtime": "30", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": ["Memory", "Pattern Recognition", "Voting"], "yearpublished": "2015", "boardgameimplementation": ["MasterChef"], "usersrated": "1", "maxplayers": "6", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3176794_t.jpg", "average": "2", "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["Clementoni"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3176794.jpg", "boardgameversion": ["First edition"], "maxplaytime": "30", "boardgamecategory": ["Card Game", "Movies / TV / Radio theme"], "age": "7", "minplaytime": "20", "description": "The official board game of MasterChef Junior TV Show.<br/>You can play the kids or the family version.<br/>KIDS<br/>Play 5 challenges with the ingredient cards and tiles: the challenges are based on pattern recognition, fast catch, memory and deductive skills.<br/>FAMILY<br/>Create a dish using some ingredient cards drawn from the deck.<br/>The players vote the best and the more original dish, and score points accordingly.<br/><br/>The player with the most points will win and can wear the chef hat!<br/><br/>"}, "207885": {"poll": [], "name": "Shooty Space", "videogamemode": ["Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["eShop Wii U Downloadable edition"], "average": "0", "videogametheme": ["Space"], "usersrated": "0", "videogamedeveloper": ["RCMADIAX"], "videogamegenre": ["Shoot 'em Up"], "videogameplatform": ["Wii U"], "statistics": [], "videogamepublisher": ["RCMADIAX"], "description": "User Summary<br/><br/>A standard shoot em' up.<br/><br/>"}, "207886": {"boardgamedesigner": ["Martin Nedergaard Andersen"], "poll": [], "name": "Brain Flip", "playingtime": "20", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": ["Memory"], "yearpublished": "2016", "usersrated": "0", "maxplayers": "6", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3160845_t.png", "average": "0", "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["FoxMind"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3160845.png", "boardgameversion": ["First edition"], "maxplaytime": "20", "boardgamecategory": ["Children's Game", "Memory", "Party Game"], "age": "6", "minplaytime": "15", "description": "Give the wrong answer on purpose!

Your objective is to be the most badass by the end of the game while making your friends look lame.<br/><br/>Now how? With the playing deck, each player has a &quot;formation card&quot; to show you how your &quot;body&quot; is formed. Your body is made up of six tattooable limbs (two arms, two legs, a chest, and a back); and each limb holds enough space for 3 designs each (so 18 designs in total).<br/><br/>To fill these limbs, you have to get tattooed. The game consists of three types of cards: Positive Tattoos (indicated by their blue title color and positive value), Negative Tattoos (indicated by their red title color and negative value, and Modifier Cards (which have no number value and have only a gold bar at the bottom of the card).<br/><br/>Now game play is easy to learn. Each players starts with a hand size of 5 cards... which will remain for the game unless you have a card that says other wise. And you have four main actions on your turn.<br/><br/>1. Get tattooed:<br/>This can be a positive or a negative tattoo. To get a positive tattoo, you have to discard either another positive tattoo or a modifier (which is good as gold even though it doesn't have a number value) since good tattoo artists don't work for free. To get a negative tattoo, you probably know someone working out of a van or basement that will give you tetanus along with a free tattoo, so negative tattoos are free and don't require a discard payment. Some cards, both positive and negative, have extra effects that are in their description bars under their titles.<br/><br/><br/>    Note if you can't or choose not to do either, you can discard two cards to pass. But to get to your second action, you have to get a tattoo on yourself first.<br/><br/><br/>2. Open play:<br/>This is where you can do as much as your hand allows. If you can pay for a second tattoo, you can get one. This is also where the use of modifiers come into play and where the pvp aspect comes in. There is a dreaded modifier known as &quot;Bad Advice&quot;. This modifier is what mainly allows a player to play negative tattoos on other players. And there are other great modifiers that also will effect tattoos that are already in play.<br/><br/>3. Is a require discard.<br/>This allows for a more balance deck as well as forces more strategy and less hording. There are cards that will effect the discard.<br/><br/>4. Is basically refresh. Fill your hand back to five (unless you have a card that says other wise).<br/><br/>The end game is determined when one player has filled their body, that player receives 5 bonus points, and everyone then totals their tattoo values to determine the winner.

Then the sky began to fall and everything changed.  Fire streaked across the sky raining disaster upon their world.  When the fires and earthquakes dissipated and the sky once again cleared, the inhabitants of Quoddria emerged from hiding and began to rebuild their lives.  Amid the fragments of meteors in the ruins of towns and villages, altered landscapes and vanished seas, the people encountered wondrous crystals.  The inhabitants of Quoddria soon discovered that crystals had miraculous properties, bringing new life and unlocking incredible powers in some who encounter them.<br/><br/>In Fringe, a town on the edge of a valley that was once a vast inland sea, Quoddrians are gathering to rebuild and have discovered an ancient lost city in the dry seabed nearby.  Brave heroes, you are called to adventure!   Do you have what it takes to challenge the wild and dangerous new world and return with the mysterious crystals and wondrous relics of a lost civilization?<br/><br/>Quodd Heroes is a fast-paced modular, scenario-based adventure board game system that plays like a combination of Super Smash Bros., Mario Cart and Legend of Zelda all wrapped into one. Whether it&rsquo;s a simple point-to-point rally-style race, capture the flag or a quest to uncover hidden secrets each game is filled with unexpected events, lots of player interaction, ever-changing boards and a dash of mayhem.<br/><br/>The core mechanism in Quodd Heroes is something you&rsquo;ve never see before. Each player controls a different cube-shaped character miniature and player board.  You then assign a different movement skill to five of the six sides of your character (the sixth side has an ability unique to your character). When you begin the movement phase on your turn you &ldquo;tumble&rdquo; your character into an adjacent space and perform the movement skill associated with the face-up side of your character. Skills include: Tumble, Jump, Slide, Diagonal Slide, and Dash.<br/><br/>While you work to complete the scenario&rsquo;s objective(s), either on your own or cooperatively, game boards which are laid out in grids present obstacles like walls, raging rivers, chasms, moving platforms, rotating board sections, trap doors, tunnels, teleporters and more. As you navigate the world you create new obstacles and shortcuts while battling your opponents by pushing them into pits, blocking their paths and fouling their plans.<br/><br/>As you explore the world you will find food, runes, items and pets in the form of cards. These cards enhance your abilities, slow your opponents and modify the world around you. If you use your movement skills and cards strategically you'll emerge as the greatest of the Quodd Heroes.<br/><br/>A turn in Quodd Heroes involves: <br/>1.  The Main Phase: Players are required to make exactly one move, they may also play any cards they wish (or save them for a nasty combo!)<br/>2.  Exploration Phase: Draw cards from the common deck according to your exploration upgrade level.  Cards are very powerful but you may not have more than five <br/>cards in your hand at the end of your turn.<br/><br/>At the end of each round is a training phase where each player chooses of their 7 two-sided upgrade tiles to apply to their character.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "1", "boardgameversion": ["English first edition", "German first edition"], "average": "9.3", "name": "Quodd Heroes", "playingtime": "75", "boardgamemechanic": ["Action / Movement Programming", "Co-operative Play", "Grid Movement", "Modular Board", "Pick-up and Deliver", "Variable Player Powers"], "age": "10", "boardgameexpansion": ["225336"], "usersrated": "50", "boardgamefamily": ["Admin: Unreleased Games", "Crowdfunding: Indiegogo", "Crowdfunding: Kickstarter", "Crowdfunding: Spieleschmiede"], "boardgamepodcastepisode": ["27.
