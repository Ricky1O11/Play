It creates an atmosphere of exhilaration, where a couple can experience something similar to those initial &quot;falling in love&quot; feelings. During this process, true intimacy is developed and deepened. That being said, the game is also competitive; the couple competes one against the other as they both enjoy the benefits of their new-found intimacy. It is simply a great date night in a box&mdash; accessible anytime and anywhere&mdash; no costs, no distractions, no preparations, no planning.<br/><br/>The Discovery Game is effective for the newlywed, the empty-nester, for couples that are very close and those who are struggling. This is possible because the couple controls the content and the pace of intimacy. The discovery game simply provides the environment and the parameters necessary for a great date to take place. Consequently, the game provides the perfect environment for a connected couple seeking an exciting night of physical intimacy, while also providing the perfect environment for a couple hoping to re-establish friendly lines of communication.<br/><br/>The game is a Focus on the Family &quot;Reviewed&quot; product. It has also received endorsements from FamilyLife, The American Association of Christian Counselors and Shaunti Feldhahn (the best-selling author of &quot;For Men Only and For Women Only&quot;).<br/><br/>In that there are property spaces one may purchase, and because the Reality Check spaces often impart financial setbacks similar to those encountered in real life, The discovery Game is sometimes said to be similar to Monopoly and the Game of Life. The discover Game is different from those games in that it was designed to generate intimacy in a relationship. To that end, the discovery spaces are among the most important spaces on the board. For when a player lands on a discovery space he or she draws a discovery card. The cards prompt the player to several types of actions&mdash; all of which promote intimacy. The discovery Game is also unlike many adult board games which are purposed on inducing sexual intercourse. Sexual intercourse is often the outcome for many couples as they play, and The discovery Game does encourage mild physical intimacy and hugs, it is never coercive. Sexual intimacy that is spawned by The discovery Game is always the free choice of the players&mdash; as a couple&mdash; and the natural result of emotional intimacy.<br/><br/>Spaces unique to the game are:<br/><br/>     The &quot;Wish Space&quot; (when a player lands on this space, using the included sand-timer, he or she must perform the wishes of his or her partner for two minutes. These wishes might be sexual in nature, but they might also involve household chores&mdash; It is always up to the players and the actions must be mutually consensual).<br/>     The &ldquo;Center Square&rdquo; (is a jackpot where monies from the players are directed at various points in the game. If a player enters the Center Square and rolls doubles, he or she acquires all of the money in the jackpot. If a player cannot roll doubles he or she can use his or her &ldquo;Get Out of Center&rdquo; card. If he or she has already used that card, the player may exit the Center Square by removing an article of clothing (socks, shoes, shirt, it is the players choice). A player can enter and exit this space from any Reality Check or discovery space on the board, and the Reality Check and discovery spaces are located all around the board. This makes the Center Square an extremely helpful way of navigating the board.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>One of the greatest things about The Discovery Game is, no one feels like they are working on their marriage! It's just fun! This is a tool that has been used by thousands of strong and struggling marriages alike, to move them toward passion. It normally takes at least an hour to complete. However, because much of the game is dependent on the discussions which ensue from the discovery cards, the discussions themselves determine the time it takes to play the game.<br/><br/>"}, "181011": {"boardgamedesigner": {"2": {"name": "Reiner Knizia"}}, "poll": {}, "name": "Der Schatz des K\u00e4pt'n Flint", "playingtime": "10", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": {"2080": "Area Control / Area Influence"}, "yearpublished": "1991", "usersrated": "0", "maxplayers": "2", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic949310_t.jpg", "average": "0", "statistics": {}, "boardgamepublisher": {"3001": {"name": "W.

Players have to play the right card at the right situation as they rally it out on the court. But beware &mdash; stamina management is a critical part of the game!

Powerful Tactic cards can tilt the balance and are at the same time highly thematic - Bench allows one to regain more stamina in between rallies, Crowd Cheering allows one to perform better at critical moments and Egg Shot hits the ball so high in the sky that the opponent cannot take an accurate read on its position when it comes down.<br/><br/>The game features more than eight characters with unique character abilities, and over thirty different famous moves in the tennis world.

A world of social intrigue, popularity and betrayal. In a game of &quot;Hipster&quot;, you will fight over the current trendy location and its hipsters. By spending items or purchasing items, you can pretend to be something, that you are not. The hipster who persuade the most followers, win the game.<br/><br/>Are you ready to become a pretentious board gamer?<br/><br/>GAME PLAY:<br/><br/>Setup: Each player draws a random Hipster card from the Hipster cards deck. Add it facedown in front of the player. Add the &ldquo;In the City&quot; starting location card to the middle of the table. Each player draws 5 single value Item cards from the Item cards deck.<br/><br/>Shuffle the Item cards deck and split them into X piles face up (X is the number of players). Shuffle the Hipster deck and split them into X piles face up.<br/><br/>The player with the lowest Hipster initiative, chooses the starting player. Players take their turn clockwise.<br/><br/>Round: Starting with the first player, the player can play five Item cards from their hand. Each card has a printed status value, which can be used to purchase other Item cards. Item cards also have bonuses, when paired with other items. The more you combine, the bigger the pay off.<br/><br/>The player can also &ldquo;make a move&rdquo; on a new hipster, from the Hipster deck, at the current location (not another players hipster). They do this, by spending items equal to or higher then the Hipsters printed status value. They place these item cards facedown at the location, and in that players turn, other players can fight for attention, buy spending items which subtract from the cards added by the initiating Hipster. When another player choose to spend items, the cards are discarded afterward and they will have that amount of card less in their turn, as they have played their card out of turn.<br/><br/>Each Hipster card, has different status values with each an attached event. The player can choose to &ldquo;buy&rdquo; one of these statuses and activate the attached event. When buying a hipster, it becomes part of that players following. Each hipster card also has a printed association (i.e. Cafe Hipster). The players gathers hipsters, which match their starting hipster association, as they are the only one giving credit when ending the game.<br/><br/>If a player has spotted, that another player is collecting a specific association/trait, they can challenge that player by naming the trait. If they are correct, the player can once per game, select that players current hand. If they are incorrect, they must give the other player their hand. When a Hipster is bought, the player can choose to change location, as each location has events or abilities that might make things better or worse for the other players as the location will alter items and hipster values, traits and abilities.<br/><br/>Ending the game: The game ends, when there are no more hipsters in the hipster deck.<br/><br/>Winning Condition: The Hipster with the most like-minded hipsters win the game (cards of the same trait).<br/><br/>"}, "181082": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2641983.jpg", "poll": {}, "boardgamedesigner": {"4207": {"name": "Matthew Sprange"}}, "statistics": {}, "yearpublished": "2014", "maxplayers": "8", "boardgameartist": {"12503": "Simon Bisley"}, "boardgamepublisher": {"2826": {"name": "Mongoose Publishing"}}, "maxplaytime": "180", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2641983_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "30", "boardgamecategory": {"1116": {"name": "Comic Book / Strip"}}, "description": "Blood on the Streets is a 132 page hardback book which supplements the Judge Dredd Miniatures Game.<br/><br/>From the back of the book:<br/><br/>Life has never been easy in Mega-City One but, with BLOOD ON THE STREETS, it's about to get a lot tougher!<br/><br/>With Blood on the Streets, you will now have a new way to fight in Mega-City One, the Cursed Earth and beyond, with a new range of scenarios tailored specifically for each force.

Can you a small time merchant battle the stormy oceans and avoid the scourge of piracy to rise up with a fleet of merchant ships and enough wealth to become the leading merchant the world has ever known. Or will you get drawn in to a life of piracy, fighting and stealing your fortune. Or perhaps you will find wealth in war and help your nation conquer the world.<br/><br/>Players begin the game representing one of the major nations of 1750 as a small time merchant with limited ships and wealth, they have to trade goods across the world visiting ports until they can expand. With each new ship they add to their convoy their power across the oceans grows and they must decide when the time is right how they will gain a victory and win the game.<br/><br/>There are four ways to win the game, by trade, piracy, war or a mixture of all three. Each turn players roll a dice and move across the seas from port to port, where they can either trade, attack, offer passage, repair or buy another ship. Attacking ports and other convoys will lead to piracy unless first a letter of marquee is obtained from the players government. Becoming a Pirate has few rewards and will immediately alienate you from ports unless it too flies the Jolly Rodger.<br/><br/>The game evolves quickly and as the players get closer to their winning objectives, a race emerges to either beat them to the pip or to sabotage their efforts and gain some more time to build on their own convoy. Only the brave and unscrupulous can hope to gain a foot hold in the war on the high seas.<br/><br/>"}, "181143": {"boardgamedesigner": {"83357": {"name": "L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Czigl\u00e9dszky"}}, "average": "5.5", "poll": {}, "name": "Deadlock City Bounty Hunters", "playingtime": "15", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": {"2040": "Hand Management"}, "yearpublished": "2015", "usersrated": "2", "maxplayers": "5", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2599095_t.jpg", "boardgameartist": {"83358": "G\u00e1bor Turi\u00e1k"}, "statistics": {}, "boardgamepublisher": {"1001": {"name": "(Web published)"}}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2599095.jpg", "boardgameversion": {"279931": "First edition"}, "maxplaytime": "15", "boardgamecategory": {"1055": {"name": "American West"}}, "age": "12", "minplaytime": "5", "description": "There is a place in a godforsaken corner in the wild west called Deadlock City.

During your hunt, you'll face native enemies that can be combated, challenges to face and obstacles to overcome, all of which are completed using a simple dice-based system.<br/><br/>Combat in Hunters uses a mix of card-based Abilities, dice and a simple resource management mechanic. A Hunter can only take a limited number of abilities with them on a contract, so choosing the right combination for the job is key. These abilities are then used in conjunction with dice to determine the results of attacks. Once a contract is completed, the players can earn experience and rewards, before heading back to town to take on a new contract and a new adventure.<br/><br/>"}, "181157": {"boardgamedesigner": {"82486": {"name": "Akio Nomura"}}, "poll": {}, "name": "Kinnikuman: Title Match of the Hell", "playingtime": "70", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": {"2003": "Rock-Paper-Scissors"}, "yearpublished": "1984", "usersrated": "0", "maxplayers": "4", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2606293_t.jpg", "average": "0", "statistics": {}, "boardgamepublisher": {"934": {"name": "Bandai"}}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2606293.jpg", "boardgameversion": {"279953": "First edition"}, "maxplaytime": "70", "boardgamecategory": {"1041": {"name": "Children's Game"}}, "age": "8", "minplaytime": "40", "description": "Part of Bandai's Party Joy series of lighter boardgames.

Once a much needed beacon of strength for a foundling kingdom, he has now grown old and is no longer a vital part of a now robust and powerful country. Others have risen to prominence and power within his council. Adept in their machinations and plots, the councilors have their own self serving ambitions. In a shadowy battle of subterfuge they ruthlessly vie against one another for true control of Blackthorn. In this dance of treachery, each must seize as much power as able without drawing suspicion for whispers of treason echo through the halls of the King of Blackthorn. Whispers from fellow councilors designed to implicate and see the competition shortened by a head. The King will call for the axe for any he deems a traitor and there is always the risk that he is not as ignorant of the schemes as he seems.<br/><br/>As a member of the Council of Blackthorn, you must build influence with the kingdom&rsquo;s factions to expand your political influence.

The player with the most treason points at the end of the game is beheaded for treason and is removed from the game.

You will also find ant magic cards which can be used in place of any resource card that you need. Each fire card that you extinguish is worth a certain value. The higher the point value on the fire cards, the more resources that are needed to extinguish that fire. At the end of the game, if all fires were extinguished then whoever scored the most points from their fire cards win. However, the game can beat you when seven fire cards are played at the same time and no one can put out the fires. When this happens, your entire colony has burnt to the ground.<br/><br/>Box Contents: The game comes in a small box that easily holds the 90 playing cards within it.<br/><br/>Game Play: At the start of the game, each player is dealt three cards and a five point double sided fire card is placed in the middle of the table. This fire will not be extinguished for a few rounds with players drawing a single card. You will need a total of 11 resources (2 metal, 4 plastic, and 5 waters) to capture this card and to put out this fire. While players are drawing cards to get that five point boost to their score, other fire cards may be drawn. When this occurs they are placed down onto the table. There are two five point fire cards, two four point fire cards, three three point fire cards, four two point fire cards, and five one point fire cards. If at any point, seven fire cards are placed onto the table, one of the players must put out a single fire without drawing any additional cards. If no one can, the game is over and the colony has burnt down and everyone loses. If you are able to get through the entire deck, then you know someone will win. You will need to reshuffle the cards and then it is a race to get the remaining cards to determine the overall winner.<br/><br/>--Chad Osborn (thedicehaveit)<br/><br/>"}, "181179": {"rpgitemversion": {"280002": "PDF version"}, "statistics": {}, "name": "Ultima Forsan: A Taste of Macabre", "rpgproducer": {"82105": "Luca Basile"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2598977.jpg", "usersrated": "1", "rpgsetting": {"28318": "Ultima Forsan"}, "average": "8", "rpggenre": {"167": "History (Alternative)"}, "rpg": {"286": "Savage Worlds"}, "rpgcategory": {"2107": "Campaign Setting (game world)"}, "poll": {}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2598977_t.jpg", "description": "From publisher blurb:<br/><br/>This document offers a sample of the Savage Setting Ultima Forsan for Savage Worlds.

Each player begins with an identical party of a level-zero Warrior, Cleric, Sorceror, and Thief, but parties develop differently over time as players make skill- and item-purchasing decisions.<br/><br/>Players' parties work together to defeat the Mamono, a chimerical monster whose five-parted body changes randomly from game to game. Players compete, however, to obtain larger shares of the rewards for successfully destroying monster parts and, ultimately, more victory points then their fellow adventurers. Most games end with the Mamono's defeat, at which time the player with the most VPs wins.<br/><br/>A player's party has a single hit point count, which is both the party's life and its available action points. Individual characters do not die, whole parties do, and incur a victory point penalty. Damage dealt to the party is based on hate markers, which accrue to players in proportion to their success against the monster. Dealing more damage to the Mamono will mean greater incoming damage to manage.

Only a squad of stubborn heroes stands between the enemies and their ultimate victory.<br/><br/>Bastion is a cooperative castle defense game set in the Berserk universe, with 1 to 4 players taking on the roles of magical castle defenders. The castle is located in the center of the game board and is menaced by a great variety of invading enemies: dangerous beasts, ferocious warriors, terrible monsters, giants, mages, and even mighty dragons.<br/><br/>You will travel the bastion districts, draw energy from sources of magic, build obelisks, bombard the enemies by magical devices and learn new spells. You will be gathering specific mana that is required to defeat each of the invaders. Victories allow castle defenders to gain new abilities, build powerful artifacts, and perform magic rituals.<br/><br/>To defeat a monster you usually must travel to its location and spend a specific amount of mana of a required color. Each defeated monster provides you with a new spell. The tougher the defeated enemy, the better spell you will get. Castle defenders should try to be as efficient as possible. If you take too many actions to defeat your threats, the bastion will fall.<br/><br/>Bastion is a cooperative adventure: you either defend the city by concerted efforts or it will fall under the pressure of the attacking hordes.

While many locations on the map are familiar from old Necromancer Games titles and more recent Frog God Games products, the map itself did little to tell the story of this region and even less to answer questions that it raised: Who rules beyond the Gaelon River? What hazards and ruins await south of the well-known dungeons of Rappan Athuk and Barakus? And, what has led to this land becoming known as the Sundered Kingdoms?<br/><br/>As part of the ongoing strategy of Frog God Games to take older and hard-to-find Necromancer Games products and update them not only to new Pathfinder Roleplaying Game and Swords &amp; Wizardry Complete rules but also to incorporate them into the Lost Landssetting as a way to introduce them to fans old and new alike, Cults of the Sundered Kingdoms takes three classic Necromancer Games adventures: Patrick Lawinger&rsquo;s Morrick Mansion, Casey W. Christofferson&rsquo;s Aberrations, and Dave Brohman&rsquo;s Crystal Skull and integrates them into a continuous plot for an adventure path that takes PCs from level 3 to 15+, perfect for the party that has finished exploring the dungeons beneath Barakus and is looking for the next road to adventure.<br/><br/>But Cults of the Sundered Kingdoms is much more than just an update of those three previously published adventures. To the adventure path it adds three new original adventures written by Greg A. Vaughan called The Beast Within, Shades of Yellow, and Vengeance in the Hollow Hills that both tie in with the three older adventures and also move the plot from one to the next to create the continuity of the adventure path. While you could play any or all of the six adventures as standalone sessions, you can also use them as a single contiguous campaign to explore a large region of the Lost Lands.&quot;<br/><br/>"}, "181242": {"rpgitemversion": {"280111": "PDF Version"}, "poll": {}, "name": "Deluxe Tunnels & Trolls", "rpghonor": {"34523": "2015 Golden Geek RPG of the Year Nominee"}, "rpgproducer": {"14501": "Steven S.

Michael Witwer has written a dynamic, dramatized biography of Gygax from his childhood in Lake Geneva, Wisconsin to his untimely death in 2008.<br/><br/>Gygax's magnum opus, Dungeons &amp; Dragons, would explode in popularity throughout the 1970s and '80s and irreversibly alter the world of gaming. D&amp;D is the best-known, best-selling role-playing game of all time, and it boasts an elite class of alumni--Stephen Colbert, Robin Williams, and Junot Diaz all have spoken openly about their experience with the game as teenagers, and some credit it as the workshop where their nascent imaginations were fostered.<br/><br/>Gygax's involvement in the industry lasted long after his dramatic and involuntary departure from D&amp;D's parent company, TSR, and his footprint can be seen in the genre he is largely responsible for creating. But as Witwer shows, perhaps the most compelling facet of his life and work was his unwavering commitment to the power of creativity in the face of myriad sources of adversity, whether cultural, economic, or personal. Through his creation of the role-playing genre, Gygax gave two generations of gamers the tools to invent characters and entire worlds in their minds. Told in narrative-driven and dramatic fashion, Witwer has written an engaging chronicle of the life and legacy of this emperor of the imagination.<br/><br/>"}, "181257": {"statistics": {}, "bgaccessoryversion": {"280140": "First edition"}, "boardgameartist": {"76496": "R\u00e9gis Torres"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2600523.png", "description": "King of Tokyo: Draccus is a promo character that can be used in either King of Tokyo or King of New York.<br/><br/>Draccus comes from Patrick Rothfuss's novel The Name of the Wind, and all funds raised from the sale of King of Tokyo: Draccus go toward Rothfuss's charity Worldbuilders, which donates to Heifer International.<br/><br/>", "usersrated": "10", "average": "8.35", "boardgameaccessory": {"160499": "King of New York"}, "boardgamepublisher": {"8923": {"name": "IELLO"}}, "poll": {}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2600523_t.png", "name": "King of Tokyo: Draccus (promo character)"}, "181259": {"statistics": {}, "name": "A Mass of Dead", "videogamemode": {"2149": "Single-Player"}, "videogameversion": {"280142": "Windows Downloadable edition"}, "average": "0", "videogametheme": {"2659": "Zombies"}, "usersrated": "0", "videogamegenre": {"2748": "Survival"}, "videogameplatform": {"4977": "Windows"}, "poll": {}, "description": "User Summary<br/><br/>A zombie survival game.

The player who first succeeds wins. Possible actions that players can take are:<br/><br/><br/>     Grabbing: The active Kumotori can grab and move another Kumotori (opponent or ally) one tile vertically or horizontally.<br/>     Throwing: The active Kumotori can throw another Kumotori (opponent or ally) one tile vertically or horizontally.<br/>     Running: The active Kumotori can move from his original position to neighboring tiles either vertically or horizontally.<br/>     Jumping: The active Kumotori can jump over one or more neighboring Kumotori (not diagonally) and/or the Stone of Balance to arrive at the next free tile.<br/>     Blocking: The active Kumotori can sit on top of a neighboring (not diagonally placed) opponent to block him.

Napoleon's French Army of the North faces Wellington's hodge-podge Army of the Low Countries, who are fighting for time while awaiting the arrival of Blucher's Prussian Army of the Lower Rhine. The maps use natural contours to show elevations, withterrain features including the critical chateaux, villages and farms, walls, woods, hedges, sunken roads, slopes, streams, and marshes.<br/><br/>Most of the vividly colored counters represent combat units: infantry battalions, cavalry squadrons, artillery batteries, and engineer detachments. Many battalions have additional counters for specialist skirmishers, or additional counters to represent greater size. Unit capabilities are modified by a number of formation markers, from infantry squares to cavalry vedettes. Individual leaders enhance unit performance, while each army's high command is represented by key commanders and unit headquarters.<br/><br/>The game mechanics have been streamlined; a single dice roll inflicts casualties and disorder. Units and larger organizations wear down over time and must be rested or risk a catastrophic collapse. Finesse trumps brute strength in combat; players must utilize a variety of arms, formations, and tactics to seize key ground and destroy enemy units. Hidden movement allows each player to prepare surprises for the other. Multiple scenarios cover everything from the historical battle to a fight for an individual chateau. The French player may decide on an early start, or even on turning the battle into a demonstration.<br/><br/>The Prussian arrival can occur early with fewer troops, or later with more, at the will of the allied player.

He gathered eminent mediums of his time for an extraordinary s&eacute;ance, and they have seven hours to contact the ghost and investigate any clues that it can provide to unlock an old mystery.<br/><br/>Unable to talk, the amnesic ghost communicates with the mediums through visions, which are represented in the game by illustrated cards. The mediums must decipher the images to help the ghost remember how he was murdered: Who did the crime? Where did it take place? Which weapon caused the death? The more the mediums cooperate and guess well, the easier it is to catch the right culprit.<br/><br/>In Mysterium, a reworking of the game system present in Tajemnicze Domostwo, one player takes the role of ghost while everyone else represents a medium. To solve the crime, the ghost must first recall (with the aid of the mediums) all of the suspects present on the night of the murder. A number of suspect, location and murder weapon cards are placed on the table, and the ghost randomly assigns one of each of these in secret to a medium.<br/><br/>Each hour (i.e., game turn), the ghost hands one or more vision cards face up to each medium, refilling their hand to seven each time they share vision cards. These vision cards present dreamlike images to the mediums, with each medium first needing to deduce which suspect corresponds to the vision cards received. Once the ghost has handed cards to the final medium, they start a two-minute sandtimer. Once a medium has placed their token on a suspect, they may also place clairvoyancy tokens on the guesses made by other mediums to show whether they agree or disagree with those guesses.<br/><br/>After time runs out, the ghost reveals to each medium whether the guesses were correct or not. Mediums who guessed correctly move on to guess the location of the crime (and then the murder weapon), while those who didn't keep their vision cards and receive new ones next hour corresponding to the same suspect. Once a medium has correctly guessed the suspect, location and weapon, they move their token to the epilogue board and receive one clairvoyancy point for each hour remaining on the clock. They can still use their remaining clairvoyancy tokens to score additional points.<br/><br/>If one or more mediums fail to identify their proper suspect, location and weapon before the end of the seventh hour, then the ghost has failed and dissipates, leaving the mystery unsolved. If, however, they have all succeeded, then the ghost has recovered enough of its memory to identify the culprit.<br/><br/>Mediums then group their suspect, location and weapon cards on the table and place a number by each group. The ghost then selects one group, places the matching culprit number face down on the epilogue board, picks three vision cards &mdash; one for the suspect, one for the location, and one for the weapon &mdash; then shuffles these cards. Players who have achieved few clairvoyancy points flip over one vision card at random, then secretly vote on which suspect they think is guilty; players with more points then flip over a second vision card and vote; then those with the most points see the final card and vote.<br/><br/>If a majority of the mediums have identified the proper suspect, with ties being broken by the vote of the most clairvoyant medium, then the killer has been identified and the ghost can now rest peacefully. If not, well, perhaps you can try again...<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": {"280253": "Bulgarian first edition"}, "average": "7.51411", "rpgpodcastepisode": {"189129": "Episode 220: Sociology and Gaming"}, "name": "Mysterium", "playingtime": "42", "boardgamemechanic": {"2023": "Co-operative Play"}, "age": "10", "boardgameexpansion": {}, "usersrated": "13467", "boardgameaccessory": {"219565": "Mysterium: Intuition Tokens"}, "boardgamesubdomain": {"5499": "Family Games"}, "boardgamefamily": {"7479": "Ghosts"}}, "181306": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2601949.png", "poll": {}, "boardgamedesigner": {"69895": {"name": "Caleb Grace"}}, "statistics": {}, "yearpublished": "2015", "maxplayers": "4", "boardgameartist": {"67030": "J.

There is an extra penalty for winning the last trick.

Turn to deal passes to the right after each hand.<br/><br/>There are no trumps. The player to dealer's right leads first. Any card may be led, and the other players must play a card of the suit led if they have one. A player with no card of the suit led may play anything. The highest card of the suit led wins the trick, and the winner leads to the next trick.<br/><br/>When all tricks have been played, the values of cards taken in tricks are counted. Each player except the winner of the last trick scores as penalty points the value of the cards they have taken, disregarding any fractions - for example a player who has taken three and one thirds point scores 3; a player who has taken just two thirds of a point scores nothing. The scores of all the players for one hand should add up to 11, so the player who won the last trick scores the difference between 11 and the total of the amounts scored by the other players.<br/><br/>If one player wins all the points, this is called Cappotto. The player with all the points scores zero for the hand and the opponents score 11 each.<br/><br/>Any player whose cumulative score is 31 or more points drops out of the game and does not play any more. The last people left in play (1, 2 or 3 as players as agreed in advance) win the match.

Each emperor raises and moves armies in order to control more empires, or clusters of territories. They will develop their society in order to gain special abilities and victory points. The moment a player has 3 victory points, they win! The moment you have no armies on the board, you are out of play. Will you be Lord Protector, Warlord or Great Reformer?<br/><br/>Each turn, you'll choose one action to take from those unlocked on your empire mat.  At the beginning you'll either raise an army, move an army or improve one of the development ranks on your ship mat. These ranks will grant new and more powerful abilities which you can choose from during subsequent turns. Agriculture advancements will allow you to raise more armies and better defend your lands - you'll also earn a victory point for a high rank in agriculture. Military allows more troop deployments and the ability to gain victory points for each completed set of territories you control. Finally, there's Civilization. You will eventually gain a victory point for civilization, but the real gem of this category is being able to take multiple actions each turn. Once a player has achieved three victory points, they win and the game is over.<br/><br/>World events kind of throw a wrench in the best laid plans. You can see what is going to happen three turns in advance. This allows you to better plan to take advantage of global events.<br/><br/>You'll quickly get to a point where you are watching other players and acting against their strategies. You can keep a high military kingdom from receiving its victory points or keep highly civilized kingdoms from taking extra actions by breaking up their empire. A well placed strike can have lasting effects. But, it's costly to you because at the very least it takes your turn.<br/><br/>Did you notice what I never mentioned? Money.

In 1919, the requisite number of legislatures of the States ratified the 18th Amendment to the Federal Constitution, enabling national Prohibition within one year of ratification. Prohibition began on January 16, 1920 when the Eighteenth Amendment went into effect. During this time, the sale, manufacture, and transportation (a.k.a. bootlegging) of alcoholic beverages was illegal throughout the United States. Federal Prohibition agents were given the task of enforcing the law. Even though the sale of alcohol was illegal, alcoholic drinks were still widely available at &quot;speakeasies&quot; and other underground drinking establishments.<br/><br/>Welcome to the Opulent, a posh speakeasy located in vibrant Atlantic City! In The Opulent 1-4 players are tasked with the operations of a successful nightclub during the historic Jazz Age. Each player takes on a distinct role that plays a vital part in the success &mdash; or failure &mdash; of the Opulent. Cater to the recognizable social classes of the 1920s. Politicians, mobsters, aristocrats, and social celebrities are all seeking a grand time in your club. Entertain your patrons with upbeat jazz tempos, or melodic waltzes, with the Opulent jazz band. Fancy the illegal indulgences of your patrons by preparing them an exotic mixed drink, a good whisky on the rocks, or even a simple brew. Pay lookouts to deter Federal Agents seeking to shut the club down. Hire flappers, a chanteuse, cocktail waitress, or other helpful hands and amenities to improve your club.<br/><br/>Manage the Opulent in ten scenarios dating from 1920-1929 during one of the most historic periods of U.S. history! Each scenario has a dollar value that is associated with the cost of operating The Opulent for that particular year. Players must have enough money in the club coffers to cover this cost in order to win the scenario if playing a single session game, or to progress to the next scenario if players are taking on the Opulent campaign.<br/><br/>With a focus on theme and history, &quot;The Opulent&quot; is a light cooperative asymmetrical game set during 1920's prohibition where players operate a campaign driven upscale speakeasy.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "1", "boardgameversion": {"280394": "English first edition"}, "age": "16", "name": "The Opulent", "playingtime": "90", "boardgamemechanic": {"2023": "Co-operative Play"}, "average": "7.42679", "usersrated": "56", "boardgamefamily": {"24281": "Campaign Games"}}, "181378": {"poll": {}, "name": "Falling Clowns", "playingtime": "0", "minplayers": "2", "yearpublished": "0", "usersrated": "1", "maxplayers": "4", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2646400_t.jpg", "average": "5", "statistics": {}, "boardgamepublisher": {"30262": {"name": "Four Star International Trading Company"}}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2646400.jpg", "boardgameversion": {"280395": "First edition"}, "maxplaytime": "0", "boardgamecategory": {"1032": {"name": "Action / Dexterity"}}, "age": "7", "minplaytime": "0", "description": "Falling Clowns is &quot;an exciting balancing game for up to 4 players.&quot;  In this dexterity game, players take turns hanging their plastic clowns on a central clown.

The tougher the bandit the more suit symbols will appear.  The player can roll and re-roll the 6 dice up to 3 times to try to capture the bandit by matching these symbol.  Jokers are wild and can be used as any suit. Skulls, if rolled, render the die out of play.  Once captured you can stop &amp; collect the bandit by moving them into you jail, or you may press your luck &amp; try to grab more bandits.  If you decide to continue on your hunt you get to re-roll all of your dice, minus any skulls previously rolled, for three more chances to capture the new bandit.  Lose any bandit on your turn &amp; you lose ALL the bandits collected this round!<br/><br/>Each bandit has a reward amount for their capture as well as 1 to 2 reputation points to put towards your promotions.
