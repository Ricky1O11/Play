It creates an atmosphere of exhilaration, where a couple can experience something similar to those initial &quot;falling in love&quot; feelings. During this process, true intimacy is developed and deepened. That being said, the game is also competitive; the couple competes one against the other as they both enjoy the benefits of their new-found intimacy. It is simply a great date night in a box&mdash; accessible anytime and anywhere&mdash; no costs, no distractions, no preparations, no planning.<br/><br/>The Discovery Game is effective for the newlywed, the empty-nester, for couples that are very close and those who are struggling. This is possible because the couple controls the content and the pace of intimacy. The discovery game simply provides the environment and the parameters necessary for a great date to take place. Consequently, the game provides the perfect environment for a connected couple seeking an exciting night of physical intimacy, while also providing the perfect environment for a couple hoping to re-establish friendly lines of communication.<br/><br/>The game is a Focus on the Family &quot;Reviewed&quot; product. It has also received endorsements from FamilyLife, The American Association of Christian Counselors and Shaunti Feldhahn (the best-selling author of &quot;For Men Only and For Women Only&quot;).<br/><br/>In that there are property spaces one may purchase, and because the Reality Check spaces often impart financial setbacks similar to those encountered in real life, The discovery Game is sometimes said to be similar to Monopoly and the Game of Life. The discover Game is different from those games in that it was designed to generate intimacy in a relationship. To that end, the discovery spaces are among the most important spaces on the board. For when a player lands on a discovery space he or she draws a discovery card. The cards prompt the player to several types of actions&mdash; all of which promote intimacy. The discovery Game is also unlike many adult board games which are purposed on inducing sexual intercourse. Sexual intercourse is often the outcome for many couples as they play, and The discovery Game does encourage mild physical intimacy and hugs, it is never coercive. Sexual intimacy that is spawned by The discovery Game is always the free choice of the players&mdash; as a couple&mdash; and the natural result of emotional intimacy.<br/><br/>Spaces unique to the game are:<br/><br/>     The &quot;Wish Space&quot; (when a player lands on this space, using the included sand-timer, he or she must perform the wishes of his or her partner for two minutes. These wishes might be sexual in nature, but they might also involve household chores&mdash; It is always up to the players and the actions must be mutually consensual).<br/>     The &ldquo;Center Square&rdquo; (is a jackpot where monies from the players are directed at various points in the game. If a player enters the Center Square and rolls doubles, he or she acquires all of the money in the jackpot. If a player cannot roll doubles he or she can use his or her &ldquo;Get Out of Center&rdquo; card. If he or she has already used that card, the player may exit the Center Square by removing an article of clothing (socks, shoes, shirt, it is the players choice). A player can enter and exit this space from any Reality Check or discovery space on the board, and the Reality Check and discovery spaces are located all around the board. This makes the Center Square an extremely helpful way of navigating the board.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>One of the greatest things about The Discovery Game is, no one feels like they are working on their marriage! It's just fun! This is a tool that has been used by thousands of strong and struggling marriages alike, to move them toward passion. It normally takes at least an hour to complete. However, because much of the game is dependent on the discussions which ensue from the discovery cards, the discussions themselves determine the time it takes to play the game.<br/><br/>"}, "181011": {"boardgamedesigner": ["Reiner Knizia"], "poll": [], "name": "Der Schatz des K\u00e4pt'n Flint", "playingtime": "10", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": ["Area Control / Area Influence"], "yearpublished": "1991", "usersrated": "0", "maxplayers": "2", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic949310_t.jpg", "average": "0", "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["W.

Players have to play the right card at the right situation as they rally it out on the court. But beware &mdash; stamina management is a critical part of the game! If you are not careful enough, you might end up breathless too quickly.<br/><br/>Sweet Spot uses a uniquely designed 'numbers system' to simulate the tennis ball's position and allows players to feel a realistic strength control of their swings where they can literally hit the ball lightly or drive it down hard. Powerful Tactic cards can tilt the balance and are at the same time highly thematic - Bench allows one to regain more stamina in between rallies, Crowd Cheering allows one to perform better at critical moments and Egg Shot hits the ball so high in the sky that the opponent cannot take an accurate read on its position when it comes down.<br/><br/>The game features more than eight characters with unique character abilities, and over thirty different famous moves in the tennis world. It also adds an additional layer of intensity with its hidden card mechanism that will keep players on their toes as they try to predict whether a ball was given a spin or not, and even then, whether it was a topspin or an underspin...<br/><br/>"}, "181034": {"boardgamedesigner": ["Bruno Cathala", "Emmanuel Guilhaumond"], "average": "0", "poll": [], "name": "Pirates Fantasy Island", "playingtime": "30", "minplayers": "4", "boardgamemechanic": ["Area Movement", "Area-Impulse", "Co-operative Play", "Memory", "Point to Point Movement", "Simulation", "Simultaneous Action Selection"], "yearpublished": "2015", "usersrated": "0", "maxplayers": "4", "boardgameartist": ["Cyril Bouquet"], "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["Hurrican"], "boardgameversion": ["French first edition"], "maxplaytime": "30", "boardgamecategory": ["Action / Dexterity", "Fighting", "Pirates", "Racing"], "age": "7", "minplaytime": "15", "description": "Translated from the publisher:<br/>An old Pirate locked in prison who must whisper to his apprentice on the outside the pieces of the treasure map.

By spending items or purchasing items, you can pretend to be something, that you are not. The hipster who persuade the most followers, win the game.<br/><br/>Are you ready to become a pretentious board gamer?<br/><br/>GAME PLAY:<br/><br/>Setup: Each player draws a random Hipster card from the Hipster cards deck. Add it facedown in front of the player. Add the &ldquo;In the City&quot; starting location card to the middle of the table. Each player draws 5 single value Item cards from the Item cards deck.<br/><br/>Shuffle the Item cards deck and split them into X piles face up (X is the number of players). Shuffle the Hipster deck and split them into X piles face up.<br/><br/>The player with the lowest Hipster initiative, chooses the starting player. Players take their turn clockwise.<br/><br/>Round: Starting with the first player, the player can play five Item cards from their hand. Each card has a printed status value, which can be used to purchase other Item cards. Item cards also have bonuses, when paired with other items. The more you combine, the bigger the pay off.<br/><br/>The player can also &ldquo;make a move&rdquo; on a new hipster, from the Hipster deck, at the current location (not another players hipster). They do this, by spending items equal to or higher then the Hipsters printed status value. They place these item cards facedown at the location, and in that players turn, other players can fight for attention, buy spending items which subtract from the cards added by the initiating Hipster. When another player choose to spend items, the cards are discarded afterward and they will have that amount of card less in their turn, as they have played their card out of turn.<br/><br/>Each Hipster card, has different status values with each an attached event. The player can choose to &ldquo;buy&rdquo; one of these statuses and activate the attached event. When buying a hipster, it becomes part of that players following. Each hipster card also has a printed association (i.e. Cafe Hipster). The players gathers hipsters, which match their starting hipster association, as they are the only one giving credit when ending the game.<br/><br/>If a player has spotted, that another player is collecting a specific association/trait, they can challenge that player by naming the trait. If they are correct, the player can once per game, select that players current hand. If they are incorrect, they must give the other player their hand. When a Hipster is bought, the player can choose to change location, as each location has events or abilities that might make things better or worse for the other players as the location will alter items and hipster values, traits and abilities.<br/><br/>Ending the game: The game ends, when there are no more hipsters in the hipster deck.<br/><br/>Winning Condition: The Hipster with the most like-minded hipsters win the game (cards of the same trait).<br/><br/>"}, "181082": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2641983.jpg", "poll": [], "boardgamedesigner": ["Matthew Sprange"], "statistics": [], "yearpublished": "2014", "maxplayers": "8", "boardgameartist": ["Simon Bisley", "Clint Langley", "Dermot Power", "Greg Staples", "Kevin Walker"], "boardgamepublisher": ["Mongoose Publishing"], "maxplaytime": "180", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2641983_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "30", "boardgamecategory": ["Comic Book / Strip", "Miniatures", "Science Fiction", "Wargame"], "description": "Blood on the Streets is a 132 page hardback book which supplements the Judge Dredd Miniatures Game.<br/><br/>From the back of the book:<br/><br/>Life has never been easy in Mega-City One but, with BLOOD ON THE STREETS, it's about to get a lot tougher!<br/><br/>With Blood on the Streets, you will now have a new way to fight in Mega-City One, the Cursed Earth and beyond, with a new range of scenarios tailored specifically for each force.

The plot has certain demands on its stars though and if they hope to get better and continue upping the ante on the evil forces of the world they will have to strive to earn Action points. Task Force H.A.T. is intended for 2-4 players.<br/><br/>Players earn Action Points by killing bad guys, making cheesy action movie puns and just doing cool stuff in general. Action Points are used to avoid attacks and activate certain special abilities that give players an advantage against their foes.<br/><br/>The heroes must complete a series of missions to level up their characters and equipment.

Or will you get drawn in to a life of piracy, fighting and stealing your fortune.

With each new ship they add to their convoy their power across the oceans grows and they must decide when the time is right how they will gain a victory and win the game.<br/><br/>There are four ways to win the game, by trade, piracy, war or a mixture of all three. Each turn players roll a dice and move across the seas from port to port, where they can either trade, attack, offer passage, repair or buy another ship. Attacking ports and other convoys will lead to piracy unless first a letter of marquee is obtained from the players government. Becoming a Pirate has few rewards and will immediately alienate you from ports unless it too flies the Jolly Rodger.<br/><br/>The game evolves quickly and as the players get closer to their winning objectives, a race emerges to either beat them to the pip or to sabotage their efforts and gain some more time to build on their own convoy.

Once a much needed beacon of strength for a foundling kingdom, he has now grown old and is no longer a vital part of a now robust and powerful country. Others have risen to prominence and power within his council. Adept in their machinations and plots, the councilors have their own self serving ambitions. In a shadowy battle of subterfuge they ruthlessly vie against one another for true control of Blackthorn. In this dance of treachery, each must seize as much power as able without drawing suspicion for whispers of treason echo through the halls of the King of Blackthorn. Whispers from fellow councilors designed to implicate and see the competition shortened by a head. The King will call for the axe for any he deems a traitor and there is always the risk that he is not as ignorant of the schemes as he seems.<br/><br/>As a member of the Council of Blackthorn, you must build influence with the kingdom&rsquo;s factions to expand your political influence. Rumors, bribes, spies and poison are the tools of your trade. Council of Blackthorn is about secretly gaining power while convincing your rival council members that you are not a threat.

Each player assumes the role of a member of the Council of Blackthorn. There are several different council member characters to play.

As players gain influence and power, they also gain hidden treason points. The players that appear to have the most power will typically gain more treason points. The player with the most treason points at the end of the game is beheaded for treason and is removed from the game.

Fire Ants! is a card game where you play as an ant and fires are breaking out throughout the ant colony. As a fire ant, you must extinguish those fires by collecting resources from the card deck. The fires can only be extinguished by collecting a certain number of metal cards, a certain number of plastic cards, and a certain number of water cards. You will also find ant magic cards which can be used in place of any resource card that you need. Each fire card that you extinguish is worth a certain value. The higher the point value on the fire cards, the more resources that are needed to extinguish that fire. At the end of the game, if all fires were extinguished then whoever scored the most points from their fire cards win. However, the game can beat you when seven fire cards are played at the same time and no one can put out the fires. When this happens, your entire colony has burnt to the ground.<br/><br/>Box Contents: The game comes in a small box that easily holds the 90 playing cards within it.<br/><br/>Game Play: At the start of the game, each player is dealt three cards and a five point double sided fire card is placed in the middle of the table. This fire will not be extinguished for a few rounds with players drawing a single card. You will need a total of 11 resources (2 metal, 4 plastic, and 5 waters) to capture this card and to put out this fire. While players are drawing cards to get that five point boost to their score, other fire cards may be drawn. When this occurs they are placed down onto the table. There are two five point fire cards, two four point fire cards, three three point fire cards, four two point fire cards, and five one point fire cards. If at any point, seven fire cards are placed onto the table, one of the players must put out a single fire without drawing any additional cards. If no one can, the game is over and the colony has burnt down and everyone loses. If you are able to get through the entire deck, then you know someone will win. You will need to reshuffle the cards and then it is a race to get the remaining cards to determine the overall winner.<br/><br/>--Chad Osborn (thedicehaveit)<br/><br/>"}, "181179": {"rpgartist": ["Francesca Baerald", "Chris Bivins", "James Denton", "Sebastien Ecosse", "Mariusz Gandzel", "Hans Holbein, the Younger", "Carly Sorge"], "rpgitemversion": ["PDF version", "Ultima Forsan, Gu\u00eda de Inicio"], "statistics": [], "name": "Ultima Forsan: A Taste of Macabre", "rpgdesigner": ["Mauro Longo", "Giuseppe Rotondo"], "rpgproducer": ["Luca Basile", "Jorge Coto Bautista", "Matteo Ceresa", "Gionata Dal Farra", "Adolfo \"Fito\" Garc\u00eda", "M.

Only a squad of stubborn heroes stands between the enemies and their ultimate victory.<br/><br/>Bastion is a cooperative castle defense game set in the Berserk universe, with 1 to 4 players taking on the roles of magical castle defenders. The castle is located in the center of the game board and is menaced by a great variety of invading enemies: dangerous beasts, ferocious warriors, terrible monsters, giants, mages, and even mighty dragons.<br/><br/>You will travel the bastion districts, draw energy from sources of magic, build obelisks, bombard the enemies by magical devices and learn new spells. You will be gathering specific mana that is required to defeat each of the invaders. Victories allow castle defenders to gain new abilities, build powerful artifacts, and perform magic rituals.<br/><br/>To defeat a monster you usually must travel to its location and spend a specific amount of mana of a required color. Each defeated monster provides you with a new spell. The tougher the defeated enemy, the better spell you will get. Castle defenders should try to be as efficient as possible. If you take too many actions to defeat your threats, the bastion will fall.<br/><br/>Bastion is a cooperative adventure: you either defend the city by concerted efforts or it will fall under the pressure of the attacking hordes.

Michael Witwer has written a dynamic, dramatized biography of Gygax from his childhood in Lake Geneva, Wisconsin to his untimely death in 2008.<br/><br/>Gygax's magnum opus, Dungeons &amp; Dragons, would explode in popularity throughout the 1970s and '80s and irreversibly alter the world of gaming. D&amp;D is the best-known, best-selling role-playing game of all time, and it boasts an elite class of alumni--Stephen Colbert, Robin Williams, and Junot Diaz all have spoken openly about their experience with the game as teenagers, and some credit it as the workshop where their nascent imaginations were fostered.<br/><br/>Gygax's involvement in the industry lasted long after his dramatic and involuntary departure from D&amp;D's parent company, TSR, and his footprint can be seen in the genre he is largely responsible for creating. But as Witwer shows, perhaps the most compelling facet of his life and work was his unwavering commitment to the power of creativity in the face of myriad sources of adversity, whether cultural, economic, or personal. Through his creation of the role-playing genre, Gygax gave two generations of gamers the tools to invent characters and entire worlds in their minds. Told in narrative-driven and dramatic fashion, Witwer has written an engaging chronicle of the life and legacy of this emperor of the imagination.<br/><br/>"}, "181257": {"statistics": [], "bgaccessoryversion": ["First edition"], "boardgameartist": ["R\u00e9gis Torres"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2600523.png", "description": "King of Tokyo: Draccus is a promo character that can be used in either King of Tokyo or King of New York.<br/><br/>Draccus comes from Patrick Rothfuss's novel The Name of the Wind, and all funds raised from the sale of King of Tokyo: Draccus go toward Rothfuss's charity Worldbuilders, which donates to Heifer International.<br/><br/>", "usersrated": "9", "average": "8.5", "boardgameaccessory": ["King of New York", "King of Tokyo"], "boardgamepublisher": ["IELLO"], "poll": [], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2600523_t.png", "name": "King of Tokyo: Draccus (promo character)"}, "181259": {"poll": [], "name": "A Mass of Dead", "videogamemode": ["Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["Windows Downloadable edition"], "average": "0", "videogametheme": ["Zombies"], "usersrated": "0", "videogamedeveloper": ["Dev Arc"], "videogamegenre": ["Survival"], "videogameplatform": ["Windows"], "statistics": [], "videogamepublisher": ["Dev Arc"], "description": "User Summary<br/><br/>A zombie survival game.

Napoleon's French Army of the North faces Wellington's hodge-podge Army of the Low Countries, who are fighting for time while awaiting the arrival of Blucher's Prussian Army of the Lower Rhine. The maps use natural contours to show elevations, withterrain features including the critical chateaux, villages and farms, walls, woods, hedges, sunken roads, slopes, streams, and marshes.<br/><br/>Most of the vividly colored counters represent combat units: infantry battalions, cavalry squadrons, artillery batteries, and engineer detachments. Many battalions have additional counters for specialist skirmishers, or additional counters to represent greater size. Unit capabilities are modified by a number of formation markers, from infantry squares to cavalry vedettes. Individual leaders enhance unit performance, while each army's high command is represented by key commanders and unit headquarters.<br/><br/>The game mechanics have been streamlined; a single dice roll inflicts casualties and disorder. Units and larger organizations wear down over time and must be rested or risk a catastrophic collapse. Finesse trumps brute strength in combat; players must utilize a variety of arms, formations, and tactics to seize key ground and destroy enemy units. Hidden movement allows each player to prepare surprises for the other. Multiple scenarios cover everything from the historical battle to a fight for an individual chateau. The French player may decide on an early start, or even on turning the battle into a demonstration.<br/><br/>The Prussian arrival can occur early with fewer troops, or later with more, at the will of the allied player.

Build your ship, research tech, and explore the galaxy for anything &mdash; or anyone &mdash; you can exploit.<br/><br/>At the start of the game, you can produce (draw) two cards each turn, store two cards, and assemble (use) one. Cards have a number from 1-4 on them as well as 1-3 colored squares on each end. The squares represent currencies, with blue building technology, green exploring planets, red fueling military growth, and yellow (seemingly always a single square) being a joker that can apply toward anything.<br/><br/>Each turn, you take one action. You might store two cards to be used as money to buy something later, or work toward discovering a planet (with each additional planet requiring more effort than earlier ones), or use a special, single-use action acquired on a planet previously discovered, or buy a technology card (with these cards being color-coded for expand, explore, exterminate, and exploit categories), or complete a technology previously purchased. If you spend money from storage or take a planet action, then you keep your cards in hand for use next turn; otherwise you assemble what you can, then throw away the rest.<br/><br/>As you increase your holdings, your abilities increase. More military leads to more production, giving you more cards in hand each turn. More technology allows you to assemble more, letting you tuck more cards each turn to find planets and complete technology faster. More planets gives you more storage, letting you bank more money toward future purchases, such as a dreadnought or a mothership, which will then allow further military growth, which gets you more cards, which lets you buy more technology, etc.<br/><br/>Alternatively, you can use money to buy more production, storage, and assembly, but ideally you want to build tech, military, and planetary holdings since those things will help with everything else you're doing.<br/><br/>You play twice through the giant money stack with two players and three times through with three or four players.

He gathered eminent mediums of his time for an extraordinary s&eacute;ance, and they have seven hours to contact the ghost and investigate any clues that it can provide to unlock an old mystery.<br/><br/>Unable to talk, the amnesic ghost communicates with the mediums through visions, which are represented in the game by illustrated cards. The mediums must decipher the images to help the ghost remember how he was murdered: Who did the crime? Where did it take place? Which weapon caused the death? The more the mediums cooperate and guess well, the easier it is to catch the right culprit.<br/><br/>In Mysterium, a reworking of the game system present in Tajemnicze Domostwo, one player takes the role of ghost while everyone else represents a medium. To solve the crime, the ghost must first recall (with the aid of the mediums) all of the suspects present on the night of the murder. A number of suspect, location and murder weapon cards are placed on the table, and the ghost randomly assigns one of each of these in secret to a medium.<br/><br/>Each hour (i.e., game turn), the ghost hands one or more vision cards face up to each medium, refilling their hand to seven each time they share vision cards. These vision cards present dreamlike images to the mediums, with each medium first needing to deduce which suspect corresponds to the vision cards received. Once the ghost has handed cards to the final medium, they start a two-minute sandtimer. Once a medium has placed their token on a suspect, they may also place clairvoyancy tokens on the guesses made by other mediums to show whether they agree or disagree with those guesses.<br/><br/>After time runs out, the ghost reveals to each medium whether the guesses were correct or not. Mediums who guessed correctly move on to guess the location of the crime (and then the murder weapon), while those who didn't keep their vision cards and receive new ones next hour corresponding to the same suspect. Once a medium has correctly guessed the suspect, location and weapon, they move their token to the epilogue board and receive one clairvoyancy point for each hour remaining on the clock. They can still use their remaining clairvoyancy tokens to score additional points.<br/><br/>If one or more mediums fail to identify their proper suspect, location and weapon before the end of the seventh hour, then the ghost has failed and dissipates, leaving the mystery unsolved. If, however, they have all succeeded, then the ghost has recovered enough of its memory to identify the culprit.<br/><br/>Mediums then group their suspect, location and weapon cards on the table and place a number by each group. The ghost then selects one group, places the matching culprit number face down on the epilogue board, picks three vision cards &mdash; one for the suspect, one for the location, and one for the weapon &mdash; then shuffles these cards. Players who have achieved few clairvoyancy points flip over one vision card at random, then secretly vote on which suspect they think is guilty; players with more points then flip over a second vision card and vote; then those with the most points see the final card and vote.<br/><br/>If a majority of the mediums have identified the proper suspect, with ties being broken by the vote of the most clairvoyant medium, then the killer has been identified and the ghost can now rest peacefully.

The values of the cards are as follows:<br/><br/>Each ace                           1 point<br/>Each 3, 2, re, cavallo or fante    1/3 of a point<br/><br/>Deal (anticlockwise) 8 cards to each player for 5 players, 10 each for 4 players and 13 each for 3 players (in this case the dealer receives 14 cards and discards one card, which will be given to the winner of the last trick). Turn to deal passes to the right after each hand.<br/><br/>There are no trumps. The player to dealer's right leads first. Any card may be led, and the other players must play a card of the suit led if they have one. A player with no card of the suit led may play anything. The highest card of the suit led wins the trick, and the winner leads to the next trick.<br/><br/>When all tricks have been played, the values of cards taken in tricks are counted. Each player except the winner of the last trick scores as penalty points the value of the cards they have taken, disregarding any fractions - for example a player who has taken three and one thirds point scores 3; a player who has taken just two thirds of a point scores nothing. The scores of all the players for one hand should add up to 11, so the player who won the last trick scores the difference between 11 and the total of the amounts scored by the other players.<br/><br/>If one player wins all the points, this is called Cappotto. The player with all the points scores zero for the hand and the opponents score 11 each.<br/><br/>Any player whose cumulative score is 31 or more points drops out of the game and does not play any more. The last people left in play (1, 2 or 3 as players as agreed in advance) win the match. Alternately, some play that when a player reaches or exceeds 31, the player with the lowest score wins.<br/><br/>"}, "181310": {"poll": [], "name": "Dreamscapes: The Sandman", "videogamemode": ["Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["iOS edition", "Windows/Macintosh Downloadable edition"], "average": "0", "videogameseries": ["Dreamscapes"], "videogametheme": ["Fantasy"], "usersrated": "0", "videogamedeveloper": ["Shaman Games"], "videogamegenre": ["Hidden Object"], "videogameplatform": ["iPad", "iPhone", "Windows"], "statistics": [], "videogamepublisher": ["1C Company", "G5 Entertainment", "Playrix Entertainment"], "description": "With the help of the mad Professor you get into the subconsciousness of the girl Laura lying in coma.

Each emperor raises and moves armies in order to control more empires, or clusters of territories. They will develop their society in order to gain special abilities and victory points. The moment a player has 3 victory points, they win! The moment you have no armies on the board, you are out of play. Will you be Lord Protector, Warlord or Great Reformer?<br/><br/>Each turn, you'll choose one action to take from those unlocked on your empire mat.  At the beginning you'll either raise an army, move an army or improve one of the development ranks on your ship mat. These ranks will grant new and more powerful abilities which you can choose from during subsequent turns. Agriculture advancements will allow you to raise more armies and better defend your lands - you'll also earn a victory point for a high rank in agriculture. Military allows more troop deployments and the ability to gain victory points for each completed set of territories you control. Finally, there's Civilization. You will eventually gain a victory point for civilization, but the real gem of this category is being able to take multiple actions each turn. Once a player has achieved three victory points, they win and the game is over.<br/><br/>World events kind of throw a wrench in the best laid plans. You can see what is going to happen three turns in advance. This allows you to better plan to take advantage of global events.<br/><br/>You'll quickly get to a point where you are watching other players and acting against their strategies. You can keep a high military kingdom from receiving its victory points or keep highly civilized kingdoms from taking extra actions by breaking up their empire. A well placed strike can have lasting effects. But, it's costly to you because at the very least it takes your turn.<br/><br/>Did you notice what I never mentioned? Money. There's no fiddly money mechanic. No huge army bum-rushing. No tedious marching of vast armies across huge masses of territories. Reign of Man takes the best parts of the best war games of the past and leaves all the good stuff. Check it out! And may the world kneel to the one true emperor!<br/><br/>"}, "181358": {"boardgamedesigner": ["Francis Tresham"], "statistics": [], "bgaccessoryversion": ["First Edition"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2611141.jpg", "description": "Enhanced money set for  '1835' and other games.<br/><br/>Contents:<br/>40 @  1     30 @  20<br/>15 @  4     20 @  50<br/>20 @  5     24 @ 100<br/>30 @ 10     14 @ 500<br/><br/>Total Value 12,000<br/><br/>comment<br/>no year for this product is available<br/>the game was published in 1990<br/>this accessory may not have been available since 1995 or earlier<br/><br/>", "usersrated": "0", "average": "0", "boardgameaccessory": ["1835"], "boardgamepublisher": ["Hartland Trefoil Ltd."], "poll": [], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2611141_t.jpg", "name": "1835 Extension Kit MEK 1: Enhanced Money"}, "181360": {"boardgamedesigner": ["J\u00fcrgen Diehl", "Anne Diehl"], "poll": [], "name": "Wertvolle Sch\u00e4tze", "playingtime": "35", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": ["Set Collection", "Tile Placement"], "yearpublished": "1992", "usersrated": "1", "maxplayers": "4", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2683958_t.jpg", "average": "5.5", "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["Ulj\u00f6"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2683958.jpg", "boardgameversion": ["German first edition"], "maxplaytime": "0", "boardgamecategory": ["Ancient", "Educational", "Exploration", "Religious"], "age": "10", "minplaytime": "35", "description": "Wertvolle Sch&auml;tze (Precious Treasures) is a tile laying game, presenting 20 treasures named in the Bible.

In The Opulent 1-4 players are tasked with the operations of a successful nightclub during the historic Jazz Age. Each player takes on a distinct role that plays a vital part in the success &mdash; or failure &mdash; of the Opulent. Cater to the recognizable social classes of the 1920s. Politicians, mobsters, aristocrats, and social celebrities are all seeking a grand time in your club. Entertain your patrons with upbeat jazz tempos, or melodic waltzes, with the Opulent jazz band. Fancy the illegal indulgences of your patrons by preparing them an exotic mixed drink, a good whisky on the rocks, or even a simple brew. Pay lookouts to deter Federal Agents seeking to shut the club down.

Set-up time is approx. 2-3 minutes with playtime amounting to 5-10 minutes, and this game can be played with up to 6 players.<br/> GAMEPLAY:<br/>1st) dump out the hexagonal pieces onto your playing surface and find the queen chit (she has an image on each side of the chit so it should be easy to find her).<br/>2nd)Place the queen in the middle of the playing surface.<br/>3rd)Arrange the rest of the pieces (beekeeper logo side facing up) around the queen piece until you have 3 rows around the queen. (The playing surface should resemble a giant hexagonal shape, or honeycomb)<br/>4th) Youngest player gets to go first by pulling 1 chit from the game (*NOTE* only pieces with 3 open sides can be removed from the arranged pieces).  He/She will then flip over the piece and find the following;<br/>BEE POINTS:  These give you points to win the game<br/>ANIMALS:  These guys make you lose turns<br/>HONEY TOKENS: You need at least 6 honey tokens to pull the queen from her throne when she has at least 3 open sides and end the game and with her you get 10 bee points.<br/>BEE NET or HONEY EXTRACTOR:  Use these cards once during gameplay to steal a bee chit or honey chit from an opposing player (once used they must be discarded to the side)<br/>  Once the first player's turn is complete, then the person to the left is next to pull a piece from the hive.<br/><br/>ENDING AND WINNING THE GAME:<br/>  The game is ended when the Queen chit is removed from the playing surface, which can happen two ways;<br/>  One way is if she has at least 3 open sides and someone has 6 or more HONEY TOKENS.<br/>  The other way is if there are no more chits to pull from the game, then the queen is rewarded to the next player's turn.<br/>  The game is won by the person with the most Bee Points, so count up all of your drones', larvas', workers' and queen bee's chit values and that will be your Bee Point count.<br/><br/>Norshanks Game Cause:<br/> As with most of the games that Norshanks Games will be marketing, this game is tied to Beekeeping Associations in various countries, and every time a game is sold, part of the profits will be donated to the Purchaser's Current Country of Residence National Beekeeping Association.<br/> The donated funds will go to the Beekeeping Associations to help save the bees by; researching colony collapse disorder, increasing bee populations, educating the public about the importance of bees, and many other great projects!<br/> With your help we can help reverse the collapse of bee populations everywhere!<br/><br/>Game is expected to be ready for shipment in Winter.<br/><br/>"}, "181421": {"boardgamedesigner": ["David Parlett"], "poll": [], "name": "Star Wars: Duell der M\u00e4chte", "playingtime": "0", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": ["Auction/Bidding"], "yearpublished": "2015", "usersrated": "6", "boardgamefamily": ["Star Wars"], "maxplayers": "4", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2609153_t.jpg", "average": "5", "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["Ravensburger Spieleverlag GmbH"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2609153.jpg", "boardgameversion": ["Multilingual first edition"], "maxplaytime": "0", "boardgamecategory": ["Card Game", "Movies / TV / Radio theme"], "age": "8", "minplaytime": "0", "description": "A simple Star Wars themed Card game.<br/>Each turn a villain card is revealed and players use their 8 hero cards to bid on them.

A player with an ineligible character can create a new 1st-level character or use a pregenerated character.<br/><br/>The adventure is set in the Moonsea region of the Forgotten Realms, in and around the city of Mulmaster and the Flooded Forest to the south of the city.<br/><br/>"}, "181440": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2614239.jpg", "poll": [], "boardgamedesigner": ["J\u00f3zsef Dorsonczky"], "statistics": [], "yearpublished": "2015", "maxplayers": "4", "boardgamepublisher": ["Fullcap Games", "Mind Fitness Games"], "maxplaytime": "25", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2614239_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "15", "boardgamecategory": ["Abstract Strategy", "Card Game", "Deduction"], "description": "1:34 a.m. --- A fired bookkeeper&rsquo;s message on Twitter: 3-SAME or SUM-15.<br/>1:39 a.m. --- The information leaked out few minutes ago, and already the cartel chief's server has been attacked. <br/>The stake is high, therefore the hackers not only have to break the firewall but to fight against each other ... <br/><br/>Hack Trick is a game of deduction and combinations where players generate numbers to finally obtain a valid password - a three-digit code with the same digits (ex. 222, 555) or with their sum being 15 (ex. 852, 159, 357). Each time a card is played, the player adds a number to the sequence, and marks the generated number - the sum of the last two numbers - on the keypad (places a marker on the key). Because the keypad is a magic square (the sum of each row, column or diagonal is 15) the object of the game is to line up three markers or place three on the same key.<br/><br/>Hack Trick gameplay is deceptively simple, but you&rsquo;ll see, that it hides many combinations. In his turn, the player may ask the sum of the opponent&rsquo;s hand, than play a card or draw. When he plays a card he may capture opponent markers, moreover, he may sacrifice a marker to force his opponent to play a card in the next turn, or contrarily, protect himself from being forced. Markers can be used in five different ways, but be careful, the player who runs out loses!<br/><br/>Finally, the winner will be the player who knows how to defend and attack the positions, when to gather information, when to use the doubles, when to start a forced series, but above all how to find the right balance between forming a strong hand and tend to the final goal on the board.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": ["English first edition", "English second edition", "Polish first edition", "Romanian/Hungarian first edition"], "average": "6.81404", "name": "Hack Trick", "playingtime": "25", "boardgamemechanic": ["Area Control / Area Influence", "Hand Management", "Variable Player Powers"], "age": "10", "usersrated": "321", "boardgamesubdomain": ["Abstract Games", "Family Games"], "boardgamefamily": ["Hackers"], "boardgamepodcastepisode": ["Cult of the New Board Game Podcast 004 \u2013 Essen 2015 Diary!", "Cult of the New Board Game Podcast Episode 017 \u2013 Our Podcast Subscriptions"]}, "181441": {"boardgamedesigner": ["Robin David"], "poll": [], "name": "Litterateur", "playingtime": "45", "minplayers": "3", "boardgamemechanic": ["Card Drafting"], "yearpublished": "2015", "boardgameimplementation": ["Movable Type"], "usersrated": "2", "maxplayers": "5", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2615131_t.jpg", "average": "4", "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["Uncanny Cardboard"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2615131.jpg", "boardgameversion": ["First edition"], "maxplaytime": "45", "boardgamecategory": ["Card Game", "Print & Play", "Word Game"], "age": "10", "minplaytime": "20", "description": "Litterateur is a card-drafting and word-building game for up to five players.<br/><br/>For five rounds, players will draft cards into their hands and use these cards, along with three common cards, to produce a word. the player with the best word will get to choose any three cards in play to put into their score pile.

Better hurry, you are not the only one after the job!<br/><br/>The game includes over 100 game cards, 10 General Store cards &amp; 6 custom shooter dice. On each player's turn, they flip over a card to hunt for a wanted bandit.  Each bandit has a sequence of suit symbols (heart, diamond, spade &amp; club).  The tougher the bandit the more suit symbols will appear.  The player can roll and re-roll the 6 dice up to 3 times to try to capture the bandit by matching these symbol.  Jokers are wild and can be used as any suit. Skulls, if rolled, render the die out of play.  Once captured you can stop &amp; collect the bandit by moving them into you jail, or you may press your luck &amp; try to grab more bandits.  If you decide to continue on your hunt you get to re-roll all of your dice, minus any skulls previously rolled, for three more chances to capture the new bandit.  Lose any bandit on your turn &amp; you lose ALL the bandits collected this round!<br/><br/>Each bandit has a reward amount for their capture as well as 1 to 2 reputation points to put towards your promotions. Higher ranks gain the ability to re-roll a certain number of skull dice.<br/><br/>Reward money can be traded in for General Store cards which can help you on your journey or played to hinder another player's.
