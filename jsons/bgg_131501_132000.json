The players buy, assemble and paint miniatures for use with the game. The miniatures come with stat cards, these stats will also be available in a rulebook. The stat card tells the player how far the model can move, how many dice it uses to attack, how many dice it gets while defending, how far its combat reach is how many hits the model can sustain before being removed from gameplay as dead and the level of faith it has in its God.<br/><br/>Monsters, heroes, and gods of different pantheons battle in a miniatures skirmish game. Intuitive dice-based combat.  Cards list what models can accomplish, and dice rolls determine hits and blocks. Rolling the power die in special situations can prevent un-blockable hits.<br/><br/>Using entire pantheons to build war bands adds a twist, and models sculpted by industry greats makes for a well-executed presentation.<br/><br/>Players start off by choosing a God from a pantheon to play as their main character. Players then decide on a point total for the game they want to play. Once the point total is decided, each player puts together an army with models (using the models point cost) that equal up to the point total decided by the players. Players can only use models from their chosen pantheon at this time. There is the possibility that some  pantheons may be able to benefit from rogue legends in the future.<br/><br/>Players are allowed to select one coin that they possess to use during the game. Different coins will be manufactured with different abilities. Some coins will be standard while others will be collectible items sold only during certain times of the year or at specific locations.<br/><br/>Models have a movement number listed in inches that they may move. Every model gets to actions, one used to move and the other used to attack or move.<br/><br/>Special dice are used in the game. Attack dice are six sided dice with three blank sides, two sides with a picture of a single sword (these count as single hits) and one side with crossed swords (this counts as a double hit.) Models may roll the number of attack dice that is listed in their attack statistic on the card.<br/>Defense dice have for blank sides and two sides with the image of a shield. Defense dice are rolled as a reaction to a model being attacked. Every shield that is rolled removes one hit from the attacks that were rolled.<br/>Lastly there is the power dice. Power dice are a special kind of dice that players get through either magic, attacking a prone model or by charging an enemy. Power dice have three blank sides, one side with a single sword (this counts as a single hit) one side with three swords crossed (this counts as a triple hit) and the final side has the word &quot;power&quot; on it. If the dice are rolled and the word power comes up, the defender does not receive his defense dice roll in response to this attack.<br/><br/>If a God is killed during the game, the faith scores of all the models on that team are reduced making them more likely to fail psychology checks. If a God is the only model left on the board, the God loses the ability to use any influence. Influence is a score that tells a God how much magic he can use every round. When a God is left without followers, he loses his magic ability.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": ["First edition"], "age": "0", "name": "Dominion of the Gods", "playingtime": "20", "boardgamemechanic": ["Dice Rolling"], "average": "0", "usersrated": "0", "boardgamefamily": ["Crowdfunding: Kickstarter"]}, "131519": {"poll": [], "name": "Transcripted", "videogamemode": ["Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["Windows Downloadable edition"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1439478.jpg", "videogametheme": ["Puzzle", "Science / Technology"], "usersrated": "0", "videogamedeveloper": ["Alkemi Games"], "videogamegenre": ["Action", "Puzzle"], "videogameplatform": ["Windows"], "average": "0", "statistics": [], "videogamepublisher": ["TopWare Interactive"], "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1439478_t.jpg", "description": "History&rsquo;s greatest battles have always been fought at scales too small for the human eye to see.

They have convinced Bilbo to embark on a most unexpected journey &ndash; but first Gandalf, along with the Dwarves Dwalin, Kili and Fili, must find the other ten Dwarves who are lost in the Hobbit holes of Hobbiton.<br/><br/>In The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey, the players first build the game out of LEGO bricks, then they take turns rolling a special six-sided die. If a player rolls 1-3, he moves his figure the number of spaces rolled and uses a torch to lift a piece out of the Hobbit hole on which he landed. Hopefully the bottom of the piece shows a Dwarf. If so, the player keeps the Dwarf and play passes to the left. If a player finds a Hobbit instead, he lifts a piece out of any other Hobbit hole on the board in an attempt to locate another Hobbit; if the player finds a match, he keeps the pair of Hobbits and is rewarded with the opportunity to peek at the bottom of a piece from any other Hobbit hole.<br/><br/>Instead of a Hobbit or Dwarf, some pieces feature a picture of breakfast. Matching two breakfasts allows a player to take a Dwarf piece already obtained by an opponent and return it to the Hobbit hole of his choice. The last possibility when revealing a piece is to find a picture of a rune. Matching two runes allows a player to select another Hobbit hole of his choice; if he finds a Dwarf in this location, he keeps it and play passes to the left. The custom die also features a picture of a map on one side. Rolling the map allows a player to move to any Hobbit hole on the board.<br/><br/>After all ten Dwarves have been found, the player with the most Dwarves wins. The game comes with variant rules, including one that shifts the location of Hobbit holes by swinging portions of the board into different configurations. Another variant requires players to find Thorin, the leader of the Dwarves, last.

These pieces are placed on the board to create a particular board configuration before the main game starts: this is called the setup phase.<br/>A given board configuration may be played repeatedly, with players taking turns to play as black and as white. Since each board configuration will have its own nuances, repeated play enables players to experiment with strategies best suited to each setup.<br/>Alternatively, Mapello can be played in free-play mode. In free-play mode, players take it in turns to setup the board. In order to encourage balance in the setup, the player not setting up the board has the option to play as black or as white (hence to move first or second).<br/><br/>The extra pieces are as follows:<br/>-    Walls: They act like the walls of the board border, but placed inside the board. They are immovable obstacles that cannot be played on.<br/>-    Bonuses: They reward the player with extra points when captured.<br/>-    Jokers (addition by N&eacute;stor Romeral Andr&eacute;s): They are placed on the border and act as pieces of the colour of the player in turn.<br/><br/>By combining these pieces, players can create millions of different boards.<br/><br/>COMPONENTS<br/><br/>-    Game board of 10x10 squares. The inner 8x8 board is used for playing, while the border is only used to place the jokers during the setup phase. <br/>-    64 Reversi discs (black/white).<br/>-    8 walls (gray squares).<br/>-    8 bonuses (blue discs).<br/>-    8 jokers (red squares).<br/><br/>SETUP PHASE<br/><br/>Optionally, the players may agree some constraints on the number of each type of piece to be placed during the setup phase. Then, subject to these constraints the setup player places their chosen number of pieces. Walls and power-ups can be placed anywhere on the inner 8x8 area (except on the four centre squares), and jokers can be placed anywhere on the outer 10x10 border. The game commences with an initial 2x2 configuration of black and white pieces in the following diagonal pattern:<br/> PLAYING PHASE<br/><br/>Two players (black and white) alternate turns placing a piece with their colour facing up onto an empty cell of the inner 8x8 board. Black always plays first. Each piece must be placed adjacent to an opponent's piece (either horizontally, vertically or diagonally). Then, all the opponent's pieces that are trapped in a contiguous straight line (either diagonal, vertical, or horizontal) between the newly placed piece and an existing piece of that colour, or a joker, are flipped over to the player's colour. A legal move must case at least one opponent piece to be flipped. If a player cannot make a legal move then they pass.<br/>      <br/>If a player places a piece on top of a blue bonus disc, they take the disc (this will score 3 points at the end of the game).<br/><br/>The game ends when neither player can make a legal move. Players count the pieces of their colour facing up and add the points of the blue discs. Highest score wins. Over a series of games the first aim is to win the most games. In the event of a tie in the number of games won, the point difference over the set of games decides the winner.<br/><br/>Re-implements:<br/>    Othello<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": ["English first edition"], "average": "6.6", "name": "Mapello", "playingtime": "20", "boardgamemechanic": ["Area Enclosure", "Modular Board", "Tile Placement"], "age": "8", "usersrated": "5", "boardgamesubdomain": ["Abstract Games"], "boardgamefamily": ["Combinatorial"]}, "131568": {"image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2995800.jpg", "boardgameimplementation": ["Clacks: A Discworld Board Game"], "poll": [], "boardgamedesigner": ["Leonard Boyd", "David Brashaw"], "statistics": [], "yearpublished": "2012", "maxplayers": "4", "boardgameartist": ["Leonard Boyd"], "boardgamepublisher": ["Backspindle Games Ltd.", "Ninja Division"], "maxplaytime": "30", "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2995800_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "30", "boardgamecategory": ["Abstract Strategy"], "description": "Deep within the rain forests of the Yucatan, rival teams of treasure hunters have recently discovered the lost city of Codinca.

Examining them closely you discover an intricate series of mechanisms which allow the tiles to switch places and turn over, which reveals that each tile has a stone side and a gold side. Carvings on each side of the pillar indicate that a sequence of four key patterns must be made with the tiles to open the temple. Can you be the first to unlock the secrets of Codinca?<br/><br/>In Codinca, each player has control of a set of four matching symbol tiles: Air, Water, Earth or Fire. Players take turns attempting to move their tiles into a series of four specific key patterns indicated on the key discs drawn at the beginning of the game; those patterns are a block of four, a line of four, four corners (can be four corners of any nine tiles as well as outside corners) and a diagonal line of four.<br/><br/>On each turn a player must either switch and flip one of their own tiles with any adjacent tile, or switch one of their tiles with any adjacent tile and switch the same or another of their tiles with any adjacent tiles or flip two tiles, one of which must be one of their own tiles. In addition, players are allocated three Spirit Card that gives them the bonus move choice of Line Push or Rotate Four. This allows players to disguise their planned moves. On the back of the Spirt Card is a Trap Pattern. This can be used to change a set display of tiles from gold to stone and visa versa to match the pattern on the Trap Pattern. Players can match their required patterns in any order, and the first player to match all patterns wins.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": ["English first edition", "English pre-production edition (Spiel 2012)", "Multilingual second edition"], "average": "6.57154", "name": "Codinca", "playingtime": "30", "boardgamemechanic": ["Tile Placement"], "age": "8", "usersrated": "176", "boardgamefamily": ["Crowdfunding: Kickstarter"], "boardgamepodcastepisode": ["Episode 121 - Codinca Kickstarter project with BackSpindle Games", "Episode 66 - Codes and Keys", "Episode 80- Cry Havoc and Our Still Gotta\u2019 Get/Play List", "The Game Pit Podcast: Episode 63 - UK Games Expo 2016", "The Polyhedron Collider Cast - UK Games Expo 2016"]}, "131570": {"rpgdesigner": ["Chris Clark (I)"], "rpgitemversion": ["1982 Version"], "statistics": [], "name": "Inner City", "rpgartist": ["Daniel Lewis"], "rpgproducer": ["Marcia Lang"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1416096.jpg", "usersrated": "0", "average": "0", "rpggenre": ["Crime (Criminal / Law Enforcement)", "Modern (Urban)"], "rpgpublisher": ["Inner City Games Designs"], "rpg": ["Inner City"], "rpgcategory": ["Accessory (dice, maps, screens, cards)", "Core Rules (min needed to play)"], "poll": [], "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1416096_t.jpg", "description": "From inside the book,<br/><br/>&quot;Inner City is a contemporary role-playing game.

In addition, there are cards which have the various countries/territories listed on the card, and plastic figures which represent the player's army.<br/><br/>At the beginning of the game, all cards are passed out to the players, which represents the starting countries for each player.  Afterward, the players are allowed a certain number of army units, relative to the total number of players, which they are allow to place on their starting countries.<br/><br/>At the beginning of each round, players are given a piece of paper to write all their actions on.  Included is new unit deployment (based on total countries controlled, largest connected empire, continents controlled, and any matching card set the player can turn in), attacks, and the player's surge attack.  Players may attack any country using army units they control on adjacent countries, but must leave at least one unit in their country as a defender.  In addition, players may elect to make one surge attack, where if one of their attacks is successful, after all other attacks are resolved, they may make one more attack to attempt to conquer another country.<br/><br/>Once all players have completed their decisions for the round, they reveal said decisions, deploy new units, and announce all attacks.  If there are any border clashes (two countries trying to attack each other), they are resolved first.  Battles are resolved using custom 12-sided dice.  There are multiple dice that are rolled relative to the army size.  Each die is numbered 1-6, but the distribution of numbers changes relative to the army size (eg. the larger the army, the more likely the die is to roll higher numbers).  Each player rolls the die, with the player rolling the lowest number losing a number of units relative to the smallest army (the larger the army, the more units lost per roll).  In the event of a tie on the die roll, both players reroll.  The battle is over once one attacking army in the border clash is eliminated.<br/><br/>After border clashes are resolved, mass invasions are resolved.  Mass invasions occur when multiple countries attack the same country.  This can be multiple armies from one player, or more than one.  Mass invasions are resolved the same as border clashes, the only difference being that, unlike border clashes where there is not a specific attacker, the attacking player wins ties.  Just like border clashes, the player who loses the roll also loses units relative to the smallest army size in the battle.  The mass invasion is completed when one of the armies is eliminated.<br/><br/>Invasions are then resolved, which are the same as mass invasions, but are only from one country to another.  After invasions are resolved, spoils of war are resolved.  Spoils of war occur when two or more players attack the same country in a mass invasion and multiple attacking armies remain.  Spoils of war are resolved like border clashes, where ties are resolved with a reroll.<br/><br/>After all attacks are resolved, players will resolve the surge attack they noted on their paper.  Surge attacks are resolved like invasions, or mass invasions if multiple players surge into country.  In the event of a successful mass invasion surge attack, the players resolve the conquest with a spoils of war.<br/><br/>Each round occurs the same as listed above, until one player finishes the round with a previously agreed upon control limit (60% control of countries, 80%, etc).  That player is the winner of Concurrent!<br/><br/>"}, "131577": {"poll": [], "name": "NFL Kicker 13", "videogamemode": ["Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["Android edition", "iPhone/iPad edition"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1499699.png", "videogametheme": ["Sports - American Football"], "usersrated": "1", "videogamedeveloper": ["Full Fat Productions Ltd"], "videogamegenre": ["Sports"], "videogameplatform": ["Android", "iPad", "iPhone"], "average": "7", "statistics": [], "videogamepublisher": ["Apple", "Google"], "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1499699_t.png", "description": "Experience the glory of being an NFL&rsquo;s top kicker!<br/><br/>Play the ultimate football game of the season on mobile, featuring all 32 NFL teams and the authentic 2012 uniforms and equipment.<br/><br/>Pick your favorite team, customize your jersey and kick field goals and punts across 3 game modes.<br/><br/>Take the challenge and compete with Facebook friends, unlock classic &amp; alternate team uniforms and upgrade your stadium into a high tech temple to football.<br/><br/>Source: The Developer Website.<br/><br/>"}, "131578": {"statistics": [], "name": "Amiga 2000", "videogamehardwarecategory": ["Console"], "usersrated": "0", "average": "0", "videogamehwmfg": ["Commodore International Limited (Commodore)"], "poll": [], "videogamehwversion": ["Amiga 2000"], "videogamehardware": ["Amiga"], "description": "Aimed at the high-end market, the original Europe-only model adds a Zorro II backplane, implemented in programmable logic, to the custom Amiga chipset used in the Amiga 1000.

Missing a prey animal means that the higher animal type starves, which gives you penalty points as a wildlife manager. Thus, you want to maintain all species in your wildlife park, especially the rarest species as they give you prestige points.<br/><br/>In each of the eight game years (i.e., rounds), you can add 1 or 2 animal groups to your park; each group first consists of 1-4 animals of one species. When you attract them to your park, these are young animals. They can grow old and die naturally after five years, but to do this they need enough prey to feed on during their lifetime. Otherwise they starve. At the same time, higher predators in the food chain can eat these animals.<br/><br/>An animal's age is shown by its location on your lifetime track, which uses four sticks to divide the track into five sections (i.e., years). After each year, you shift your rightmost stick to the leftmost side, which ages all of your animals by one year.<br/><br/>When you don't have all four different species, you gain one penalty point per missing species (and higher level animals may starve). If you have the most (or second-most) of an animal which was rare before, you score 1-2 prestige points. After year eight, you add the number of your animal groups to your prestige point total to calculate your final score.<br/><br/>The challenge in Tricky Wildlife is to balance your desire for prestige points with the need to preserve your complete food chain.<br/><br/>"}, "131612": {"poll": [], "name": "Fishy!", "videogamemode": ["Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["Web Browser edition"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1443024.jpg", "videogameseries": ["Fishy!"], "videogametheme": ["Animals"], "usersrated": "2", "videogamedeveloper": ["XGen Studios"], "videogamegenre": ["Arcade"], "videogameplatform": ["Web Browser"], "average": "4.75", "statistics": [], "videogamepublisher": ["XGen Studios"], "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1443024_t.jpg", "description": "It&rsquo;s getting pretty crowded down here, and if you want to last in this underwater arena, you&rsquo;ll need to outsmart and outmaneuver the larger predators, all the while building your strength by eating any smaller prey you can find.

As master of one of the four great Ninja clans you must train your warriors so they are ready to carry out the missions offered. But beware, if you take too long one of your rival clans may undertake a mission before you and steal the rich reward offered for carrying it out.<br/><br/>In Shinobi: Way of the Ninja, you control a ninja clan and must perform different missions in order to obtain wealth and win the game. The missions you are called on to carry out are represented by three Mission cards that will tell you what you need to do (the task), where the mission is to be carried out (the location), and what problems may arise that will hinder you in the missions execution (complications). Each of these things requires one or more Skill cards from your hand to overcome. For example, if the mission required the use of unarmed combat you would need to play that Skill card in order to carry it out.<br/><br/>Once you have collected all of the Skill cards you need you may carry out a mission and reap the rewards for your clan. Unfortunately you will rarely have the right cards in your hand to perform a mission straight away. Instead you will need to store cards from your hand for future use by placing cards face-down from your hand into one of two dojos you control. Storing cards in this way represents you training the ninjas in your clan to perform a mission.<br/><br/>Keeping track of the cards placed in each dojo is challenging as you are not normally allowed to examine the cards once they are placed. You must use your powers of concentration and memory to remember which cards you have placed so that you can use them when you are ready to carry out a mission. Although this is difficult at first, you will find that your mental abilities quickly sharpen and that you will become increasingly skilled at the game. This is as it should be: being the master of a ninja clan requires great mental fortitude, and Shinobi: Way of the Ninja will test it to the utmost. However, if you get completely stuck, you can always visit the sensei who will (at a cost) allow you to examine the cards you have placed.<br/><br/>You receive a reward for completing each mission in the form of gold. The harder a mission the more gold you will receive, but the more cards you will need to play to carry the mission out.

The game was released through Steam, an online distributor, as part of their Free to Play catalog on September 30, 2011. Iron Grip: Marauders became available on Amazon.com through their Games Connect feature in 2012.<br/><br/>Gameplay<br/>In Iron Grip: Marauders there are two parts to the game: the strategic resource management and the tactical 3D battles. Players decide on plans for scientific research, unit production, and which battles to enter. When a battle begins, the game switches to a 3D view using the Unity game engine where players are asked to deploy troops that were produced in the management phase.<br/>The game allows PvP battles once players reach a certain level, and cooperative boss fights, where a number of players each fight single-player battles to defeat a boss for greater rewards. There are also tournaments where players play several rounds to compete for a grand prize.<br/><br/>Economy<br/>There are currently three resources in the game: gold, iron, and gems. Gold and iron are earned through raids, smuggling or assault missions, and are used to produce units, construct buildings, and perform research. Gems can be purchased with real world currency. Gems can be used to buy clothes for the in-game avatar, to develop special units on the black market, to buy perks which can increase research speed, unit production speed, or XP gain, or Gems can be used to buy energy, allowing players to participate in more battles in a given day.<br/><br/>Battles<br/>Marauders uses the Unity game engine to depict fights on a 3D battlefield. At the beginning of a battle, players decide whether they want to perform a raid to capture resources or attempt a conquest to capture a base. Players must then strategize to spend a limited number of deployment points by selecting which of their units to set up on the battlefield. Battles are then effected through turn-based combat. At the beginning of each turn, every unit is given eight action points which can be used to move or attack. Each unit class has associated strengths and weaknesses when attacking which must be considered in order to choose the most effective unit for a specific task.<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;Iron Grip: Marauders&quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "131695": {"poll": [], "name": "Rain (Web Browser)", "videogamemode": ["Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["Web Browser edition"], "average": "0", "videogametheme": ["Puzzle"], "usersrated": "0", "videogamedeveloper": ["DarkRealmStudios"], "videogamegenre": ["Puzzle"], "videogameplatform": ["Web Browser"], "statistics": [], "videogamepublisher": ["(Web published)"], "description": "Rain is an arcade game that mixes puzzle gameplay with Tetris-like gameplay to produce a unique and challenging game.

Despite all their technological knowledge, much of Humanity lives in rural and badland settings. Everyday, these people struggle for survival and are barely able to produce enough food.<br/><br/>A dependency on steam power emerged with advances in manipulating the unique properties of water. To keep the peace, the Central Council hired Marshalls to work with local towns.  Due to the disparate layout and distances between towns, the law of the gun became the common law, where the Marshalls arrested, tried, and convicted most criminals on their own.<br/><br/>With an inherent reliance on steam and bullets, Westward is a fast-paced and cinematic Steampunk Western setting.

Through doing this, the player becomes caught up between various factions competing for control over the desert and it's most valuable asset, the Hoover Dam; ultimately coming to shape the future of its inhabitants.<br/><br/>Dead Money<br/>In the first DLC pack, named Dead Money, the Courier is captured by an insane ex-Brotherhood of Steel leader known as &quot;Father&quot; Elijah and must work alongside three other captives to find the fabled treasure of the Sierra Madre Casino. The pack adds new achievements/trophies, perks, terrain, enemies and decisions for the player, as well as raising the level cap by 5.<br/><br/>Honest Hearts<br/>In Honest Hearts, the Courier is part of an expedition to Utah's Zion National Park, when they are attacked by tribal raiders. While trying to return to the Mojave, the player becomes involved in conflicts between the tribes and between a &quot;New Canaanite&quot; missionary and an individual known as the &quot;Burned Man&quot;, Caesar's former Legate, who, after losing the first battle of Hoover Dam, was covered in pitch, set on fire, and thrown into the Grand Canyon. The pack adds new achievements/trophies, perks, terrain, enemies and decisions for the player, as well as raising the level cap by 5.<br/><br/>Old World Blues<br/>In Old World Blues, the Courier unwittingly becomes a lab rat in a science experiment gone awry and discovers how some of the Mojave's mutated creatures came to exist. Old World Blues takes place in the Pre-War research centers of Big Mountain, known colloquially as &quot;the Big Empty&quot; or &quot;Big MT&quot; (where Father Elijah had found most of his equipment prior to Dead Money, such as the bomb collars and the holorifle, along with Christine also from Dead Money). The player can also choose to either turn on their kidnappers or join with them to fight an even greater threat. This pack offers new achievements/trophies, perks, a vast area to explore, and raises the level cap by 5 like the previous two packs. The player can only explore in the area until the main storyline of the DLC has been completed, but after completing it, can return back to the area at will.<br/><br/>Lonesome Road<br/>Lonesome Road concludes the story of the Courier, focusing on Ulysses, a former Frumentarii of Caesar who had discovered the &quot;Divide&quot;: a glorious land until the New California Republic annexed it. This caused Caesar to retaliate and send a small army to seize the Divide, resulting in the NCR ordering the Courier to deliver a package which would trap the armies of the NCR and the Legion and turn the Divide into a tornado strewn land full of ghouls, called Marked Men, and other dangers. Ulysses believes the Courier to be responsible for the mess of the Divide and when he is ordered to deliver the Platinum Chip, he realizes Benny's plan and discovers the Courier to be alive. When discovering the Courier is not dead, Ulysses contacts the Courier and asks him/her to enter the Divide, evoking the start of Lonesome Road.<br/><br/>Gun Runners' Arsenal and Courier's Stash<br/>Gun Runners' Arsenal adds various new weapons and weapon mods (along with new ammo types) to the game, which can be found throughout the game world. Courier's Stash contains all bonus content that was previously only available for pre-ordering the game (the Caravan Pack, Classic Pack, Mercenary Pack and Tribal Pack).<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;Fallout: New Vegas&quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "131815": {"rpgdesigner": ["Joshua L.

A Warrior beaver is an elite beaver that has been trained in the art of war. To represent this he is given a +2 while attacking.

If the Architect beaver is eliminated, that player can not build dams. This is the beaver holding a book. <br/>5. A King beaver is an elite beaver that is cautious and effective in his war tactics.

In addition, a &quot;Memory Track&quot; cartridge (sold separately) was available to store saved games and high scores for Jaguar CD games.<br/><br/>The CD unit featured a double-speed (2x) drive and built-in VLM (Virtual Light Machine) software written by Jeff Minter. The VLM provided a sophisticated video light show when an audio CD was played in the machine. Bundled with the unit were two games (Blue Lightning and Vid Grid), a music CD (Tempest 2000 soundtrack), and a Myst demo disc.<br/><br/>When the Jaguar CD was installed in a console the startup screen was different. A random 'light show' that was different every time the console was switched on was created using the VLM. However, the startup was silent and did not feature the characteristic &quot;roar&quot; of the Atari Jaguar.<br/><br/>Jaguar CD games could include as much as 790MB of data, considerably more than conventional CD-ROMs. The designers chose to ignore established CD-ROM formats and instead created their own based on the audio CD format.

Players compete to lure and destroy hapless adventurers, racing to outbid one another to see who can build the most enticing, treasure-filled dungeon. The goal of Boss Monster is to be the first Boss to amass ten Souls, which are gained when a Hero is lured and defeated &mdash; but a player can lose if his Boss takes five Wounds from Heroes who survive his dungeon.<br/><br/>Playing Boss Monster requires you to juggle two competing priorities: the need to lure Heroes at a faster rate than your opponents, and the need to kill those Heroes before they reach your Boss. Players can build one room per turn, each with its own damage and treasure value. More attractive rooms tend to deal less damage, so a Boss who is too greedy can become inundated with deadly Heroes.<br/><br/>Players interact with each other by building rooms and playing Spells. Because different Heroes seek different treasure types, and rooms are built simultaneously (played face down, then revealed), this means that every &quot;build phase&quot; is a bidding war. Spells are instant-speed effects that can give players advantages or disrupt opponents.<br/><br/>As a standalone card game with 155 cards, Boss Monster contains everything that 2-4 players need to play.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": ["English fifth edition", "English first edition", "English fourth edition", "English Revised Edition, 2nd printing", "English Revised Edition, 3rd printing", "French edition", "Game Crafter prototype limited edition", "German first edition", "Italian first edition", "Legendary Edition", "Polish first edition", "Portuguese first edition", "Spanish first edition"], "maxplaytime": "20", "average": "6.37042", "name": "Boss Monster: The Dungeon Building Card Game", "playingtime": "20", "boardgamemechanic": ["Auction/Bidding", "Hand Management", "Player Elimination", "Take That", "Variable Player Powers"], "age": "13", "boardgameexpansion": ["Boss Monster:  Final Form!

The game is housed in an attractive tin box.<br/><br/>Other games are included that bring in to play the special dice. One dice is what wargamers would call a Fire Die. It has 1 x two on it, 2 x two on it and 3 times two.The other die has letters on each face, four letters or five letters. And sometimes they use the wooden Wizard figure that is included with the game.<br/><br/>In game 1,2,3 - Magic! each player gets a hand of five cards and 12 cards are laid out in a circle, like a clock. However, a clock with 24 divisions because the cards are laid end-on thus forming a chequered track, picture, letter, picture, and so on. The Wizard is placed on one of them. The number die is used in this game. In your turn, you roll the die and advance the Wizard that number of spaces. When he has moved and lands on a picture space, the player looks at the picture and sees if he can think of a word that describes the picture. If he can then he must check his hand and see if the word he wants to use begins with one of the letters in his hand. If he does have such a card he can return that card to the box. If the Wizard lands on a letter space the reverse applies. The player looks to see if he has a picture card that begins with the letter. The first to use up all their cards, wins.<br/><br/>In Enchanting Fairy, the letter die is used. Each gets a hand of cards. The Wizard is placed in the centre of the table comfortably in reach of all the players. The die is roilled and all the players look to see if they have a picture beginning with one of the letters face-up on the die. If they do think they have the right answer, they can grab for the Wizard. Whoever gets it first (several players might grab for it at the same time), announces his answer and, if correct, returns his card to the box. If he is wrong he must draw another card from the shuffled deck.The first to use all their cards, wins.<br/><br/>Interesting additional fact. HABA add the usual disclaimer that the game is not suitable for under threes as some components could be swallowed. Nothing unusual in that except they write it in 40 languages!!<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": ["Haba Tin First Edition"], "age": "6", "name": "Zauberdomino", "playingtime": "0", "boardgamemechanic": ["Pattern Building"], "average": "5", "usersrated": "1", "boardgamefamily": ["Dominoes"]}, "131853": {"rpgartist": ["Christophe Bouvet", "Nicolas Jamme", "Bruno Laurent", "R\u00e9mi \"Remton\" Le Capon", "Nelyhann", "Fred Pinson", "Olivier \"Akae\" Sanfilippo", "Yvan \"Gawain\" Villeneuve"], "rpgitemversion": ["English First Edition", "English PDF Version", "Gratisrollenspieltag 2014 Edition", "Kickstarter Limited Edition", "Kickstarter Special Edition"], "rpgseries": ["Gratisrollenspieltag 2014"], "name": "Shadows of Esteren - Book 0: Prologue", "rpghonor": ["2013 Golden Geek Best RPG Artwork/Presentation Nominee"], "rpgproducer": ["Asami", "Jo\u00e4o Bento", "Franck Bouvot", "Nicolas Bowyer", "Franck Florentin", "Chris Fournier", "Natalie Gallecier", "Kr\u00easterion", "V\u00e9ronique Lejeune", "Stuart MacDonald", "Merryneils", "Nelyhann", "Odliz", "Aldo \"P\u00e9nombre\" Pappacoda", "Ian Stone", "Guillaume \"Ikaar\" Vasseur"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1441775.png", "usersrated": "22", "rpgdesigner": ["Nelyhann", "Aldo \"P\u00e9nombre\" Pappacoda"], "average": "6.90909", "rpgissuearticle": ["Brian's Picks"], "poll": [], "rpggenre": ["Fantasy (Low Fantasy)", "Horror"], "rpgpublisher": ["Agate RPG", "ForgeSonges"], "rpg": ["Les Ombres d'Esteren"], "statistics": [], "rpgcategory": ["Quick Start / Fast Play Rules", "Scenario / Adventure / Module"], "rpgpodcastepisode": ["Ausflug 01 \u2013 Shadows of Esteren"], "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1441775_t.png", "description": "From the Foreword:<br/><br/>Picture a peninsula with steep hills, thick forests that barely let the sunlight through, misty valleys, and fortresses clinging to the mountainside... and beyond the oceans, the vast and mysterious Continent.

Thankfully you are an influential figure in the empire. Quickly lay claim to the throne and ensure the rock-solid unity and peace of the continent.

Each player's deck starts with seven &quot;Rural&quot; territory cards and three &quot;Apprentice Handmaid&quot; succession cards (an unreliable subject). Using the currency (coins) generated by your &quot;Rural&quot; territory cards, you incorporate cards from the market into your deck according to your own strategy.<br/><br/>Each player's main goal is to give the princess he's fielded the throne. First, collect stronger territory cards such as &quot;City&quot; and &quot;Metropolis&quot; to increase your coins, and declare fielding a princess using these coins. There are five princesses and one set of twin princesses, totaling six princess cards. Each princess has special support abilities, but with only one of each, you need to be quick to field the right princess and get the support you need!<br/><br/>For your princess to take the throne, you must collect Succession Points, which represent the support of your loyal subjects and influential figures in the empire. Once you control 20 Succession Points, you may declare a coronation. Your opponents get one more turn to interrupt your coronation, but if your points remain at or above 20 by your next turn, the coronation succeeds and your princess takes the throne!<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": ["English first edition", "Japanese first edition"], "average": "7.66286", "name": "Heart of Crown", "playingtime": "30", "boardgamemechanic": ["Card Drafting", "Deck / Pool Building", "Hand Management", "Variable Player Powers"], "age": "12", "boardgameexpansion": ["Heart of Crown: Far East Territory", "Heart of Crown: Northern Enchantress", "Heart of Crown: Path Before Heaven", "Heart of Crown: Six City Alliance"], "usersrated": "105", "boardgamefamily": ["Anime & Manga", "Heart of Crown"], "boardgamepodcastepisode": ["HLG 7: Op de foto"]}, "131905": {"poll": [], "name": "The Card", "videogamemode": ["Local Multiplayer", "Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["English/European PlayStation 2 edition"], "average": "6", "videogametheme": ["Card / Casino Games"], "usersrated": "1", "videogamedeveloper": ["D3 Publisher"], "videogamegenre": ["Classic Games"], "videogameplatform": ["PlayStation 2"], "statistics": [], "videogamepublisher": ["Digital Bros S.p.A."], "description": "From the Back of the Case<br/><br/>Ultimate Casino is the best way to live out your dreams of making a forthune the easy way.

Fearless adventurers from throughout the kingdom gather forces under their banners, while prominent lords fortify their castles to withstand a siege. The whole world has turned upside down in the fever of war: dwarves have been seen defending the elves&rsquo; woodland strongholds against legions of the undead, great dragons have razed ancient obelisks to the ground, while heroes have used both brute force and cunning to capture enemy castles. The King can barely keep up with awarding commanders their well-earned titles for valor and heroism on the field of battle, and there&rsquo;s not a single distinguished title that hasn&rsquo;t already changed hands at least a dozen times. After all, it&rsquo;s not the strength of your castle or the size of your army that counts &mdash; only the favor of the supreme ruler will decide who ultimately merits receiving the King&rsquo;s Bounty.<br/><br/>Gameplay:<br/><br/>Based on the bestselling video game of the same name, King&rsquo;s Bounty is a board game that&rsquo;s played with cards. The players take control of one of five races &mdash; elves, dwarves, orcs, humans or the undead &mdash; and use their armies to capture castles and obelisks, earning victory points in the process. However, the main battle will be fought over titles, which are far more valuable than land in ensuring victory. At the end of the match, the players who have completed the required objectives earn the titles and the victory points that go with them. Finally, the scores get tallied up, and a winner is determined.<br/><br/>Game contents:<br/><br/><br/>    48 Troop cards of 5 races <br/><br/><br/>Every race except for humans has 9 troop cards: 3 archers, 2 fighters, 2 wizards, 1 hero and 1 monster.

Playing the game without a decent variety of treats (using generic tokens for treats for example) eliminates much of the fun in choosing which delicious morsels your monsters get to grab from the pot, and steal from other players.<br/><br/>The game is played by rolling 3 custom dice (which have to be assembled from the files included here) in order to roll a MONSTER(s) which then can use the other 1 or 2 dice to perform an action.  One-headed and two-headed MONSTERS can GRAB a treat, STEAL a treat, or EAT a treat, for each head they have.  A player who GRABS takes a treat from the pot and puts it on their STASH plate, a player who STEALS can take a treat from the pot OR take a treat from another player's STASH.  A player who EATS a treat puts it in their STOMACH CONTENTS bag and that treat can not be stolen by any other players.  Rolling triples has special effects, like being caught stealing.  After all the treats are gone from the pot, players score 1 point for each treat in their STASH and 2 points for each treat in their STOMACH CONTENTS bag.  I suggest having at least 10 treats per player to play with.  For fairness reasons, sometimes the players agree that if they don't roll at least one monster they can physically eat one treat from the pot.<br/><br/>The dice are made by cutting out and gluing the sides on 3/4 inch wood blocks, or printing them out with adhesive backed paper and pasting them on cubes.  The file might have to be re-sized to fit smaller dice; it contains enough icons to fill 6 dice even though you only use 3 to play.

The game was developed by Backbone Entertainment and supervised by Sega Studio USA, exclusively for the PlayStation Portable handheld videogame console. Sonic Rivals 2 was released on November 13, 2007 in North America. Like the original, Sonic Rivals 2 was not released in Japan.<br/><br/>Sonic Rivals 2 has four main Single Player modes. Story Mode is the main single player mode. Players will go through each of the game's battle modes and levels to advance the plot. Each zone has three acts and a boss, with the exception of the final zone. The characters are divided into four teams (Sonic and Tails, Shadow and Metal Sonic, Silver and Espio, Knuckles and Rouge) and each character has their own story. The game introduces a new mode called Free Play. In this single player mode, players can choose any one of the eight characters and play through the zones in traditional 2D Sonic fashion. They can also try Time Attacking, or finding the ten hidden Chao in the levels. There are no opponents for this mode. This is a first for many of the characters featured. In addition, players can also try the Cup Circuit and Single Event modes. Races and battle can be customized in every aspect, and players can try to earn cards by completing challenges. There are 150 different cards to collect, and each is tied to a certain achievement. For example, getting an S Rank in Knockout Mode unlocks a card of Mephiles the Dark. The cards themselves contain art from various older Sonic games, and can unlock things such as alternate suits for the characters. Unlike the first game, only one card is needed to unlock a suit; and each character has four suits instead of the original three. The cards also unlock the Cup Circuits, and Chao Detectors for the Zones.<br/><br/>Sonic Rivals 2 boasts a new multiplayer &quot;Battle Mode&quot; with six different types of competition in addition to the main race mode. These modes are also worked into the story. The lengths of the battles can be set though the selection menus. In Knockout, each player starts with three rings. Players must knock all of the rings out of their opponent and then attack them to win. First player to the set number of knockouts wins. In Rings Battle, players have a set time to collect as many rings as possible. The player with the most rings at the end of the time limit wins.<br/><br/>Capture the Chao is a Sonic themed version of Capture the Flag. Players must steal a set number of Chao from their opponent's base and bring them back to their own base with their own Chao still there to win. In Laps Race, the first player complete a set number of laps around the track wins. King of the Hill has an Omochao is stationed at the top of the level with a light beam. Players earn points by simply standing under it. The first player to the set number of points wins. Tag is a Sonic themed cross between Hot Potato and Tag. Each player has a time limit that drops when they hold the bomb. Players pass the bomb by attacking the other player. The first player to have their time limit expire loses.<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;Sonic Rivals 2&quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "131993": {"image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2554635.png", "poll": [], "boardgamedesigner": ["Garrett Herdter"], "statistics": [], "yearpublished": "2016", "maxplayers": "6", "boardgameartist": ["Blackwell Hird"], "boardgamepublisher": ["Lock 'n Load Publishing, LLC."], "maxplaytime": "75", "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2554635_t.png", "minplaytime": "30", "boardgamecategory": ["Card Game", "Dice", "Fighting", "Science Fiction"], "description": "The Distant Reaches of space hold a planet whispered in tales to frighten children, to threaten criminals and sway tyrants.

The Axis enemy battered at the gate and had to be repelled at all costs. SSU forces considered it fortunate if their heavy equipment could be salvaged or repaired, but many damaged machines were simply left to rust on the battlefield. Now, the SSU&rsquo;s development of VK-powered walkers has led to a change in philosophy. Even destroyed, these units are still  valuable for their rare minerals and parts. Accordingly, SSU forces operate under standing orders to salvage their wreckage or, at the least, destroy fallen vehicles properly, in order to prevent their enemies from capturing their VK technology.<br/><br/>The KV47 Recovery &amp; Demolition Walker introduces one medium combat walker that can be configured as one of four different models: Maksim, Marlen, Melor, or Mikhail. Each of these walkers affords the SSU strategic advantages from its salvage operations and can pack a punch in close combat.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "0", "boardgameversion": ["English first edition", "Fantasy Flight Premium Edition", "Fantasy Flight Premium Edition", "Fantasy Flight Premium Edition", "Fantasy Flight Premium Edition"], "average": "8.05556", "name": "Dust Tactics: KV47 Recovery & Demolition Walker \u2013 \"Maksim / Marlen / Melor / Mikhail\"", "playingtime": "0", "boardgamemechanic": ["Action Point Allowance System", "Dice Rolling", "Modular Board"], "age": "0", "boardgameexpansion": ["Dust Tactics", "Dust Tactics: Revised Core Set"], "usersrated": "9", "boardgamefamily": ["Dust"]}, "131999": {"image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1474126.jpg", "poll": [], "statistics": [], "yearpublished": "2013", "maxplayers": "0", "boardgameartist": ["Paolo Parente"], "boardgamepublisher": ["Fantasy Flight Games"], "maxplaytime": "0", "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1474126_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "0", "boardgamecategory": ["Expansion for Base-game", "Miniatures", "Science Fiction", "World War II"], "description": "Game description from the publisher:<br/><br/>Dust Tactics: Horten HO-347 comes with one miniature that can be configured in either of two jet variations that have placed the Axis on the brink of a long-awaited resurgence of air superiority in the fierce battles of Dust Tactics and Dust Warfare.
