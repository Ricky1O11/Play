Instead of his left-jab through lowland Holland to the Rhine, we have Patton's proposed right-hook, starting at Metz and swinging north and east toward the Ruhr for a war-winning knockout blow. Or, as an alternative within an alternative, the Allied player may try for a more conservative push straight east to the Rhine, there to create a bridgehead over that German river, thereby likely advancing the advent of V-E Day by at least three or four months.<br/><br/>As soon as you begin to game Patton's alternative to Montgomery's all or nothing plan, it becomes clear what a huge opportunity Eisenhower missed by backing the wrong subordinate. That is, for the British field marshal's plan to have succeeded, it really did have to go all the way, or at least get across the Rhine in some significant way. Failing short of both the Rhine and the Ruhr, as happened historically, meant a month had been wasted and a lot of lives lost only to create a salient to nowhere. Had Patton's idea been tried, only to fail as badly, a salient of that same size &ndash; but  jutting north into the Rhineland from a base at Metz &ndash; would've done much more for the Allied cause.<br/><br/>We've broadened the appeal of this design beyond those who enjoy alternative history by including a second, historical, scenario. At first we were only going to cover the actual Market-Garden portion of Montgomery's operations in September 1944. It quickly became apparent, however, portrayed at these time, space and unit scales, such a game would be a dud, with a map only nine hexes long and three wide. So we broadened the thing's shoulders by expanding the coverage to take in all Montgomery's possibilities that fateful month. So now you can choose a straight-up historic approach, or you can have alternative history within your actual history.<br/><br/>Each hex on the map equals seven miles from side to opposite side. Each game turn represents three days. Playing pieces represent divisions, brigades, combat commands, Kampfgruppen and regiments of various kinds of infantry and armor formations, each containing from about 3,000 to 14,000 men and 50 to 400 or so armored fighting vehicles.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "1", "boardgameversion": ["Command japan edition", "Strategy & Tactics edition"], "name": "Dagger Thrusts", "playingtime": "180", "boardgamemechanic": ["Hex-and-Counter", "Secret Unit Deployment", "Simulation"], "average": "6.59732", "usersrated": "41", "boardgamesubdomain": ["Wargames"], "boardgamefamily": ["Magazine: Strategy & Tactics"]}, "20515": {"boardgamedesigner": ["Dan Abbott"], "poll": [], "name": "A Sky Full of Ships", "playingtime": "120", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": ["Action / Movement Programming", "Dice Rolling", "Simultaneous Action Selection"], "yearpublished": "2004", "usersrated": "12", "boardgamesubdomain": ["Wargames"], "maxplayers": "6", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic101663_t.jpg", "average": "7.66667", "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["HardPoint Games"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic101663.jpg", "boardgameversion": ["English First edition", "Second edition"], "maxplaytime": "120", "boardgamecategory": ["Aviation / Flight", "Miniatures", "Science Fiction", "Wargame"], "age": "12", "minplaytime": "120", "description": "[From the Book]<br/>A simple (but not too simple) set of starship combat rules, which allow huge fleets to engage each other in epic battle <br/>(and finish in a reasonable amount of time).<br/><br/>You take the place of an admiral, commanding entire fleets. <br/>Using simple, fast-moving game mechanics, these rules attempt to portray the important aspects of huge fleet engagements without becoming to bogged down in time consuming detail.<br/><br/>They're for those players willing to sacrifice some complexity to achieve a fast-moving, playable and most importantly, FUN game.<br/><br/>"}, "20516": {"boardgamedesigner": ["Wolfgang Kramer", "Udo Nawratil"], "poll": [], "name": "Das grosse Hollywood Spiel", "playingtime": "90", "minplayers": "3", "boardgamemechanic": ["Card Drafting", "Dice Rolling", "Hand Management"], "yearpublished": "1995", "usersrated": "1", "maxplayers": "6", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic101704_t.jpg", "average": "5", "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["F.X.

Players are dealt five-card hands (or equal hands of less than five cards, if the deck is nearly exhausted).  The highest card played wins a trick, and players must follow suit if possible.  Players who cannot follow suit can play a non-trump card (automatically losing the round) or a trump card (potentially winning the round, unless a higher trump is played).  The trump suit is determined by rolling a special die showing the four suits plus one side with both red suits and another side with both black suits.  When a side with multiple suits is rolled, the dealer gets to pick which suit is trump.  The trump suit and dealer change every time the deck is exhausted.<br/><br/>Small plastic poker chips also play a part in the game.  Players start with an equal amount of chips.  A plastic tray is kept at the center of the board during play.  At the end of every trick in which a trump was played, all losing players have to place a chip in the &quot;Suits&quot; section of the tray.  Whenever a King is played, players place chips in the &quot;Jackpot&quot; section of the tray.  Each player has a game card showing the four suits.  Whenever a player wins a trick, he or she places a special yellow &quot;Hoyle&quot; tile under the leading suit for the trick.  Whenever a player fills all three spaces under a suit, he or she wins the chips in the &quot;Suits&quot; area of the tray and the other players have to put chips into that area.  Whenever a pre-determined number of suits are filled in, the &quot;Jackpot&quot; is won along with the &quot;Suits&quot; area.<br/><br/>After a player has filled in a suit, he or she gains the ability to &quot;freeze&quot; the suit -- upon winning a suit for the fourth time, the player can flip over one of the tiles on his or her card.  This prevents any other player from placing a tile under this suit -- instead, the only option they have is to &quot;unfreeze&quot; the suit by flipping their opponent's tile back over.  It's possible for all three tiles to get flipped, making it very difficult for anyone else to win in the suit.<br/><br/>The game has no predefined end.  The rules suggest playing for a certain amount of time, eliminating players who run out of chips until only a single player remains, or playing for a pre-determined amount of time.

A session consists of seven hands, of diminishing size.<br/><br/>A 52-card pack is used, with four suits ranking from high to low A K Q J 10 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2. A player is selected to deal, and deals seven cards each, clockwise. The uppermost of the undealt cards is turned face upwards to indicate the trump suit.<br/><br/>The player on dealer's left leads to the first trick. Players must follow suit if they can, otherwise they may play any card. Each trick is won by the highest trump in it; otherwise by the highest card of the suit led. The winner of a trick leads to the next trick.<br/><br/>After the first hand, a second hand is dealt, by the next player in order around the table, with only six cards each. The game continues like this, with one fewer card per player on each hand, until the final hand consists of one card each.<br/><br/>The winner of most tricks on a hand chooses the trump suit on the next hand. If there is a tie for who took most tricks, the players involved in the tie cut cards for the right to choose trumps.  A player who takes no tricks at all in a hand is knocked out, is dealt no more cards, and takes no further part in the game.  There is one exception to the rule about being knocked out: the first player during the game who takes no tricks on a hand is not knocked out immediately but is awarded the &quot;dog's life&quot;.<br/><br/>The game is won by the winner of the one trick on the final hand.

A liberally-illustrated rulebook teaches gamers ASL using a conversational style to teach the concepts of ASL.

TANKS! The famous and deadly German &quot;Tiger&quot;. The reliable &quot;Sherman&quot;. The tank which won the east - the T-34.<br/><br/>We know we'll get the inevitable question &quot;Do I have to buy ASLSK#1 and/or ASLSK#2 to get ASLSK#3?&quot; The Starter Kits are self contained. Each has everything you need to play what's in the box, with the higher numbers adding to the ASL knowledge you'll have from playing previous Starter Kits. We do not anticipate changing what you've learned from prior Starter Kits (for example, ASLSK#3 adds about 6 pages of rules to the base built by ASLSK#1 and ASLSK#2). A better question would be &quot;Do I need ASLSK#2 if I buy ASLSK#3?&quot;. The short answer is a resounding no! You can dive right in with ASLSK#3. But if you do, and you like the game, ASLSK#1 and ASLSK#2 both add more boards and scenarios for you to enjoy.

The 54 images were designed by Rory O'Connor of Ireland, a trainer in creativity and creative problem-solving. They can be used to arrive at answers or decisions in an indirect and ingenious way.<br/><br/>Originally Rory had put the images on the faces of a Rubik's Cube, and players would turn the Cube to scramble the images, then choose one side to play with. Kate Jones of Kadon Enterprises suggested putting the 54 images on 9 separate cubes, to allow for quicker ways to generate more varied combinations, including conceptual puzzles. Rory readily agreed, having considered the 9-cubes idea himself earlier. At a creativity conference held at Kadon headquarters in May 2004, a prototype was whipped up, and in 2005 Kadon launched the cubes version of Rory's Story Cubes.<br/><br/>Each jumbo 1&quot; cube has 6 images or icons, with a total of 54 all-different hand-inlaid images that can be mixed in over 10 million ways. You roll all 9 cubes to generate 9 random images and then use these to invent a story that starts with &quot;Once upon a time...&quot; and uses all 9 elements as part of your narrative.<br/><br/>Play it as a game for one or more players, or as a party game for three or more. Or play it as an improv game where each player contributes part of the story, picking up where the last one left off. Win award points for speedy delivery, inventiveness, imagination, drama and humor.<br/><br/>Full instructions include several other ways to use the cubes to solve problems, break up writer's block, enhance your imagination and heighten your ability to find unifying themes among the diverse images. Interpret or get at the meanings of your answers more quickly. It's fun, easy, and mind-stretching.<br/><br/>As a puzzle the cubes will really give your imagination a work-out. You'll practically feel both sides of your brain dancing. The challenge: Fit the 9 cubes into a 3x3 square. Now examine the cubes in any one row and turn them so their tops have something in common. Do this for all 3 rows. Explain your choices, or challenge another player to identify the element they share. More than one answer may be right, and there are thousands of possible combinations.<br/><br/>Rory's Story Cubes are recommended for all ages over 8, though it's fun to watch a younger child create combinations with the cubes and make up stories.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "1", "boardgameversion": ["Brain Games Baltic edition 2012", "Creativity Hub edition", "Creativity Hub edition 2011", "Creativity Hub MAX Edition", "Creativity Hub second edition", "Gamewright \"Max\" edition 2014", "Gamewright Blister Pack edition", "Gamewright English edition", "Gamewright English Edition with Dr. Toy Winner Seal", "G\u00e9m Klub Hungarian first edition", "Gigamic French first edition", "Huch Multilingual edition", "MINDOK Czech first edition", "REBEL Polish edition"], "boardgameintegration": ["Rory's Story Cubes: Actions", "Rory's Story Cubes: Adventure Time", "Rory's Story Cubes: Batman", "Rory's Story Cubes: Doctor Who", "Rory's Story Cubes: Looney Tunes", "Rory's Story Cubes: Moomin", "Rory's Story Cubes: Scooby Doo", "Rory's Story Cubes: Voyages", "Rory's Story Cubes: Actions", "Rory's Story Cubes: Adventure Time", "Rory's Story Cubes: Batman", "Rory's Story Cubes: Doctor Who", "Rory's Story Cubes: Looney Tunes", "Rory's Story Cubes: Moomin", "Rory's Story Cubes: Scooby Doo", "Rory's Story Cubes: Voyages"], "average": "6.37882", "name": "Rory's Story Cubes", "videogamebg": ["Rory's Story Cubes"], "playingtime": "20", "boardgamemechanic": ["Co-operative Play", "Dice Rolling", "Pattern Recognition", "Storytelling"], "age": "8", "boardgameexpansion": ["182952", "142556", "142557", "182953", "165522", "165521", "192324", "182954", "192355", "142558", "192323", "165523"], "usersrated": "1981", "boardgamesubdomain": ["Family Games", "Party Games"], "boardgamefamily": ["Rory's Story Cubes"], "boardgamepodcastepisode": ["07 \u2013 The Family Gamers Podcast \u2013 Story Time!", "09 \u2013 The Family Gamers Podcast \u2013 Types of Play", "11 \u2013 The Family Gamers Podcast \u2013 Travel Games", "12 \u2013 The Family Gamers Podcast \u2013 The \u201cCrate-y\u201d Holiday Season", "1P 034 - D-Day Dice", "1P 061 - Rory\u2019s Story Cubes", "36 \u2013 The Family Gamers Podcast \u2013 Learning through Games", "48 \u2013 The Family Gamers Podcast \u2013 Restaurant Games", "Episode 010 \u2013 Dynamic Storytelling", "Episode 24 - Tales of Derring-do", "Episode 24: DXV is the Homie.", "Episode 60: Rorys Story Cubes", "Game Gab: Gamewright", "Rory\u2019s Story Cubes", "What Did You Play This Week Podcast Thing Week 50!!!

Each Daimyo has the same 10 possible actions to develop his kingdom and secure points.  To do so he must deploy his armies with great skill.  Each round, the players decide which of the actions are to be played out and in which of their provinces.  If battle ensues between opposing armies, the unique Cubetower plays the leading role.

Pieces are set up on a board in a manner similar to Stratego, but rather than being linear (numerical values), the units have a rock-paper-scissors relationship.  i.e. the tank unit is superior to infantry and engineers but is inferior to aircraft, artillery, and mine units.<br/><br/>For those who want to recreate the (army) game, the pieces are as follows:  Private, corporal, sergeant, staff sergeant = 3 each.  Second lieutenant, first lieutenant, captain, major, lieutenant colonel, colonel, 1, 2, 3, and 4 star generals = 1 each. Tanks=2, plane=1, Anti-aircraft/anti-tank=5. Mines=6, Engineers=6. A-Bomb=1.<br/><br/>Infantry take each other according to rank; infantry also takes anti-aircraft/anti-tank and engineers.  Tanks and planes take infantry and engineers. Plane takes tank, anti-aircraft/anti-tank takes planes and tanks, engineers take mines without damage.  Mines are stationary pieces that explode and destroy anything that triggers it except an engineer. The A-Bomb is essentially a movable mine that destroys every piece in a surrounding square when it explodes.<br/><br/>The pieces are like mah jongg tiles arranged so that the opponent cannot see what kind they are -- he just sees blank pieces advancing toward him. When a piece is attacked or attacks, it is turned over so that the face is visible.  It then becomes a known piece for the rest of the game.<br/><br/>We played the game in Hawaii in elementary school in the late 1950s.  There were two blank pieces included, presumably in case a piece got lost.  We sometimes used these to create two additional pieces, the brainwasher and the kamikaze.  The kamikaze was simply a flying bomb.  The brainwasher changed an opponent's piece into one of your own.  It was not possible to brainwash the A-Bomb.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": ["First Edition"], "average": "0", "name": "Ato-Blitz War Games", "playingtime": "0", "boardgamemechanic": ["Rock-Paper-Scissors", "Secret Unit Deployment"], "age": "10", "usersrated": "0", "boardgamesubdomain": ["Wargames"], "boardgamefamily": ["Block wargames"]}, "20554": {"boardgamedesigner": ["Eamon Bloomfield"], "poll": [], "name": "Rolf Harris Cartoon Pics", "playingtime": "30", "minplayers": "3", "boardgamemechanic": ["Dice Rolling", "Line Drawing", "Paper-and-Pencil"], "yearpublished": "1988", "usersrated": "1", "maxplayers": "10", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1332742_t.jpg", "average": "1", "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["Paul Lamond Games Ltd"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1332742.jpg", "boardgameversion": ["Paul Lamond First Edition"], "maxplaytime": "30", "boardgamecategory": ["Movies / TV / Radio theme", "Party Game"], "age": "12", "minplaytime": "30", "description": "From the Box:<br/>Let's see who's Quickest on the Draw with Rolf Harris's new drawing game!

Each star system has a cost to build, ranging from 10-50, which indicates the value and number of deliveries that can be made to that system.<br/><br/>On each turn, players are dealt two delivery cards, which specify a cargo and three destinations, varying in value.  The cargo is automatically available at the system where the player's rocket pawn is located.  The player may keep as many cards as their spaceship has cargo holds, freely selecting between new cards and previously retained cards.  On a player's turn, they may move their rocket pawn a number of systems equal to the number of engines on their spaceship.  Upon arrival at a system specified by their cards, they are paid for the cargo.<br/><br/>There are no restrictions on arrival at a system.  However, to depart from a system a player must possess a matter transporter at that system, or pay another player to rent their transporter.  If no transporter is present, the player must build one on a later turn in order to move.<br/><br/>During the game, players choose from a limited number of special actions, such as upgrading ships, building new transporters, advertising (to receive two extra delivery cards) or simply taking money (the least appealing option).

There, ships maneuver and fight using their gunnery and torpedo factors. Each player rolls a number of dice according to the ship&rsquo;s capabilities, hitting on a result of 6. Gunnery and torpedo damage tables give the results: ships can suffer damage to engines, hull or armament.<br/><br/>The game includes 24 pages of rules and 12 scenarios which feature not just the Bismarck chase, but also the North Atlantic raids made by the German warships Admiral Hipper, Admiral Scheer, Gneisenau and Scharnhorst.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": ["First edition", "Second edition"], "average": "7.11702", "name": "Second World War at Sea: Bismarck", "playingtime": "30", "boardgamemechanic": ["Hex-and-Counter", "Simulation"], "age": "12", "boardgameexpansion": ["28852", "39808", "95004", "49164", "41000", "123660", "40796"], "usersrated": "94", "boardgameaccessory": ["Second World War at Sea: Torpedo Boats", "Second World War at Sea: Transports"], "boardgamesubdomain": ["Wargames"], "boardgamefamily": ["Second World War at Sea"]}, "20591": {"boardgamedesigner": ["(Uncredited)"], "poll": [], "name": "E!

Luckily good answers not only turn over tiles, but also give players green card that they can use to remove blockades.<br/>The game is cooperative because everyone wins if the last tile is turned over, and everyone loses when the clock runs out.<br/><br/>"}, "20608": {"boardgamedesigner": ["(Uncredited)"], "poll": [], "name": "Stikord", "playingtime": "45", "minplayers": "3", "boardgamemechanic": ["Dice Rolling"], "yearpublished": "1991", "usersrated": "10", "maxplayers": "8", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic439683_t.jpg", "average": "5.8", "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["danspil"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic439683.jpg", "boardgameversion": ["Danish edition"], "maxplaytime": "45", "boardgamecategory": ["Party Game"], "age": "10", "minplaytime": "45", "description": "Roll four dice with a letter on each.

Roberts Best World War II Boardgame Nominee", "2008 Golden Geek Best Wargame Nominee", "2008 International Gamers Awards - Historical Simulation"], "description": "from GMT website:<br/><br/>We are proud to announce the companion game to GMT Games' award winning Europe Engulfed. In Asia Engulfed the action takes place across Asia and the Pacific covering the entire war from the attack at Pearl Harbor to the final collapse of the Japanese empire.<br/><br/>Asia Engulfed is a complete stand alone game or it can be combined with Europe Engulfed to simulate the entire Second World War. A complete set of combined game rules allow for unit transfer, production allocation, and combined victory conditions.<br/><br/>Asia Engulfed focuses on playability and making players feel the pressures their historical counterparts were under. Players actually feel the pressures and stresses felt by the strategic level commanders in the real war. The game achieves this level of playability without sacrificing historical detail. The entire campaign is playable in 6-to-9 hours once players become familiar with its elegant game systems.<br/><br/>Wood Block Units:<br/>Wood blocks are used for both land and naval units to provide a realistic fog of war. Different colors are used for not only the different nations but also for land and naval units so there is no confusion as to what is what and who is who. Only the controlling player knows where their elusive carriers are until combat is engaged. Players will have to decide during their naval reaction move if they have the guts to intercept the enemy's unknown forces.<br/><br/>Supply and Oil:<br/>Asia Engulfed incorporates a unique and simple system to realistically portray the Japanese resource limitations. The further your empire expands from Japan the harder it is to supply and operate your far-flung forces, not to mention defend your perimeter with a navy limited by its oil reserves.<br/><br/>China, India, and Australia:<br/>All three are in play and potential targets for Japanese expansion. Could any of them been captured if Japan had focused its resources? While it isn't likely, they are targets that the Allies have to defend and often seem just out of reach. Optional rules can bring the Soviet Union into the game.<br/><br/>Redesigned Air System:<br/>Air assets are critical to a successful campaign in the Pacific, influencing both movement and supply. A carefully designed area map allows air units to exert control into adjacent areas and move across areas to the next airbase without having to worry about tracking range or counting hexes. Carrier air assets are represented by their own counters allowing for their losses to be tracked separately from the carriers and for the Japanese to husband their elite pilots.<br/><br/>Redesigned Naval System:<br/>The naval system is totally redesigned from Europe Engulfed and along with the air system an integral part of Asia Engulfed. Basing limits, extended range movement, naval reaction movement, carrier day or surface ship night combat, surprise effects, port attacks, invasion support, it's all there and when combined with block limited intelligence and a healthy dose of lady luck every engagement brings the thrill of a potential victory and the fear of a devastating defeat. Even submarines get to put in an appearance as they try to pickoff stragglers.<br/><br/>Production and Strategic Warfare:<br/>Asia Engulfed Game Turns represent two months each and production and strategic warfare takes place within each of these turns. Production levels are easy to calculate and production choices include Special Actions, Aircraft Carriers, Battleships, Cruisers, Submarines, Land Based Air and Carrier Based Air units, Infantry, Marines, and an assortment of strategic assets. The USA conducts a strategic submarine campaign against the Japanese naval transport system and later in the war is able to direct strategic bombers over Japan.<br/><br/>Special Actions:<br/>Special Actions are an innovative rule system to allow for not only extended operations during the course of a normal two month game turn but also to represent each sides unique capabilities. From code breaking to emergency rebasing, special actions provide a wealth of options for the player who has been able to commit the necessary resources to build them.<br/><br/>Rulebook and Playbook:<br/>The 24-page rulebook is clearly written with many examples. Also included is a 24-page playbook. The playbook includes player notes, designer notes, combined game rules, optional rules, scenarios, index, and an extended example of play.<br/><br/>Integrates With: <br/><br/>    Europe Engulfed<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": ["GMT edition"], "average": "7.54743", "name": "Asia Engulfed", "playingtime": "480", "boardgamemechanic": ["Area Control / Area Influence", "Area Movement", "Dice Rolling", "Secret Unit Deployment"], "age": "12", "usersrated": "385", "boardgamesubdomain": ["Wargames"], "boardgamefamily": ["Block wargames"], "boardgamepodcastepisode": ["Point 2 Point 43: Jason Flies Solo", "Point 2 Point Episode 12 - Rick Young and Mark McLaughlin"]}, "20610": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic122497.jpg", "poll": [], "boardgamedesigner": ["Richard Marsh", "Colin Rumford"], "statistics": [], "yearpublished": "2005", "maxplayers": "10", "age": "0", "boardgamepublisher": ["Rapid Fire Publications", "Stratagem Publications LTD"], "maxplaytime": "240", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic122497_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "240", "boardgamecategory": ["Miniatures", "Wargame", "World War II"], "description": "Rapid Fire! is a set of fast play miniatures rules which enables players to re-fight brigade-level combined arms engagements during WW II.

Towers are owned by the various guilds. These are the power plants (energy), factories (synthesis), and government facilities (control). Domes are smaller structures used to house the citizens. As with the towers, domes are always associated with a particular guild. Both towers and domes are color-coded to identify guild affiliation; red for energy, blue for synthesis, green for control, and black for builders.<br/><br/>Each of the guilds wants its towers positioned close to the towers and domes of other guilds (their customers) and far away from its own other towers (to avoid competing with other towers of their own guild). Location, location, location! Some things never change, even in the distant future.<br/><br/>The Builder's Guild is unique because there are no Builder's Guild towers, i.e., no black towers. Instead, the Builders are compensated for their efforts by being given the profits of some of the other guilds&rsquo; towers that the Builders choose as they construct the city.<br/><br/>The players in this game are competing builders working to construct the city. At the same time, they are choosing towers for themselves that they hope will be profitable with many close customers and little competition. The choices must be made with care because each builder may only choose three.<br/><br/>Red, blue, and green large Icehouse Pieces are used for the towers, and piecepack coins with the suit side up represent red, blue, green, and black domes. The land area of the city is defined by a 4x5 array of piecepack tiles, suit side up, with each tile representing four building sites. The game-play consists of the players alternating turns, placing a tower or dome each turn until either all<br/>available towers and domes have been placed or until there are no legal construction sites remaining within the city.

The zone of the 16th was south of the highway, and along the Smolensk-Minsk Railroad. They were reinforced with the following units: 148th Tank Regiment (PT mineroller tanks), 63rd Guards Heavy Tank Regiment (KVs), 517th Tank Regiment (FT tanks), elements of several Self-Propelled Artillery Regiments, 2nd Guards Assault Engineer-Sapper Brigade, as well as numerous towed artillery units. The Soviet forces trained as a combined arms team prior to the attack, and were well prepared. In most sectors of Army Group Center, the Germans had relatively thin lines, and most armor and heavy artillery was stripped to defend expected areas of attack. The area of the highway had seen much heavy fighting in the winter of 1943-44, and the Germans expected an attack to come in this direction. When German intelligence detected the buildup of artillery and armored forces, as well as the movement of ammunition, their reaction was to ensure forces in this area retained significant combat strength. The 78th Sturm Division, already the most powerful &lsquo;infantry&lsquo; division in Army Group Center, maintained its structure which included the 189th Assault Gun Battalion (StuG), a Heavy Tank Destroyer Battalion (PzJgIII/IVs), 5th Nebelwerfer Battalion (120mm Mortars), and Army Antiaircraft Battalion 293 (mix of 88s/20s).

Clobber till content.<br/><br/><br/>Wyrd City&mdash;where conflict lies in wait around every corner and the shadows are acrawl with mystery and adventure, where liberty wanes, government waxes, and a chosen few don capes and cowls to take their stand in a world gone Wyrd....<br/><br/>Capes &amp; Cowls: The Superhero Board Game features 32 original Heroes (and/or villains, depending on your perspective) and several Crews of secondary characters, including Freedom Patrols, Liberty Bots, Diabloids, Arachnidrones, Darklings, thugs, and zombies. Each Hero is defined by personalized stats (Attack, Defense, Speed, and Vigor) and 3 unique Powers, while each Crew is defined by personalized stats and 1 unique Power. Altogether, Capes &amp; Cowls provides over 75 characters with over 100 Powers.<br/>    <br/>Capes &amp; Cowls is played on a unique Battleboard whose color- and number-coded spaces influence character abilities, modify power levels, and place strong emphasis on strategic and tactical play. Though certain game situations do require a roll of the Battle Die, skillful players will find themselves seldom relying on luck to determine the outcome of an action. In short, the player who recruits and manages his team of Heroes most wisely will nearly always prove the victor.<br/><br/>Capes &amp; Cowls offers the following 3 modes of play:<br/><br/>1. Basic: In the Basic Game, each player recruits a team of 2 or 3 Heroes, deploys the team to the Battleboard, and dukes it out with his opponent&rsquo;s team for a predetermined number of rounds. The victory goes to the player with the most Heroes left on the Battleboard at the end of the game.<br/><br/>2. Standard: The Standard Game allows each player to recruit a team of 4 or 5 Heroes, and introduces Scene Features such as Rooftops, Walls, and Trees, as well as Objects such as Boulders, Cars, and Mailboxes. These elements enrich the Battleboard environment and call for keener strategies and sharper tactics. The victory, as in the Basic Game, goes to the player with the most Heroes left on the Battleboard at the end of the game.<br/><br/>3. Adventure: The Adventure Game requires the players to select an Adventure from the Adventure Book. Each Adventure includes a full-color map for Battleboard setup, instructions for team recruitment, and special rules for playing the chosen Adventure, including team-specific goals and victory conditions. This mode of play incorporates Crew characters, special items, and plot devices that further define the Wyrd City universe and its colorful assortment of costumed denizens. The victory in an Adventure Game goes to the player whose team succeeds in fulfilling the predetermined goal of the Adventure.<br/><br/>In addition to the above modes of play, Capes &amp; Cowls also allows for solitaire and multiplayer variations.<br/><br/>Wyrd City&mdash;where the &ldquo;good guys&rdquo; are bad, the &ldquo;bad guys&rdquo; are you, and the dress code is decidedly unusual.<br/><br/>Capes &amp; Cowls: The Superhero Board Game!

The move is modified by: spaces that count as two, variable length lanes in the curves, swaping cards with the draw pile without changing the movement #, holding back a card till the next quarter mile, blocking another from holding back a card, chance cards at the start and on the home stretch, chance dice roll is required to pass thru a space directly in front of another horse.  It is recommended to have a race secretary.  This person should be a fair minded person who will set up and referee the race.<br/><br/>The players try to use all of their movement while causing others to waste movement.  This player has observed that it is easy for all of the players to use all of their movement with only 6 horses in the race.  All of the movement robbing mechanisms are easily avoided with 6 horses.  The race is then determined by the movement number combined with the Start and Stretch chance cards.  The use of 12 horses makes a much more interesting game.  With 12 horses the movement robbing mechanisms can not be totally avoided.<br/><br/>John Campbell is a Hall of Fame driver (not rider) that holds many of the sport's records.  John Campbell did not design the game but has endorsed it.  The 1989 instructions invite players to a yearly tournament where the championship is decided by playing against John Campbell.<br/><br/>The instructions promote another game, &quot;Classic Thoroughbred Racing&quot; which is not currently in the BGG database.<br/><br/>"}, "20750": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic101661.jpg", "poll": [], "boardgamedesigner": ["Holger B\u00f6sch"], "statistics": [], "boardgamecompilation": ["Black Stories 1+2"], "yearpublished": "2005", "maxplayers": "15", "boardgameartist": ["Bernhard Skopnik"], "boardgamepublisher": ["Boosterbox.nl", "cosaic", "G3", "Gal\u00e1pagos Jogos", "Gen-X Games", "Kaissa Chess & Games", "Kikigagne?", "Magazzini Salani", "MINDOK", "Mindtwister AB", "moses.

Col. George Armstrong Custer. The battle was the most famous event in the Indian Wars and was a crushing victory for the Indians. Custer, already famous for his Civil War exploits, became an American folk legend. Little Bighorn was the last great victory for the Sioux and Cheyenne. Defiant and proud, they were determined to preserve their way of life but within a year they were broken and defeated by a nation swept up in the emotions of the Centennial and bent on revenge for the death of an American hero.<br/><br/>The Battle of the Little Bighorn is the third game in the Indian Wars of the American West series.  This game also includes the Montana column led by Col. Gibbons.  This column was the third column in the field within General Terry&rsquo;s campaign plan.  Crook&rsquo;s Wyoming column was the other part of this campaign, and included in Volume II of the series, The Battle of Rosebud Creek.<br/>The Montana column includes Col. Gibbon, the 7th Infantry, 2nd Cavalry, and Low&rsquo;s Artillery Battery of Gatling guns(?) and a 12 lb howitzer.  Players may now explore the possibilities and capabilities of these guns, and what effect these forces could have had on the outcome of the battle.  Scenarios included the historical game, the Montana columns arrival, assigning the Gatling guns or the 2nd cavalry with Custer. Is this last line correct?<br/>The new expanded maps (from the original DTP version), allows for the relocation of the Indian village, the arrival of the Montana column, and if Custer had waited for Terry or was delayed because he took the Gatling guns.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "1", "boardgameversion": ["Khyber Pass Games ziploc edition", "Legion Wargames edition"], "average": "7.53043", "name": "Battle of the Little Bighorn", "playingtime": "150", "boardgamemechanic": ["Hex-and-Counter", "Simulation"], "age": "12", "usersrated": "23", "boardgamesubdomain": ["Wargames"], "boardgamefamily": ["Indian Wars of the American West"]}, "20775": {"boardgamedesigner": ["(Uncredited)"], "poll": [], "name": "Department Store Math", "playingtime": "0", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": ["Roll / Spin and Move"], "yearpublished": "0", "usersrated": "0", "maxplayers": "4", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic101793_t.jpg", "average": "0", "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["Creative Teaching Associates"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic101793.jpg", "boardgameversion": ["Creative Teaching Associates Edition 2000"], "maxplaytime": "0", "boardgamecategory": ["Educational", "Math"], "age": "0", "minplaytime": "0", "description": "Let's go shopping!

Through the play of cards representing your supporters and the use of 'cumals' (a cumal is worth three cows), you attempt to promote your followers from Farmers to Herdsmen, through Warriors to Chieftains and finally to the ruling King in the region.<br/><br/>Tara is played in rounds of three cards.  A round is completed when each player has used three cards.<br/><br/>At the beginning of the game the Starting Player deals each player six cards.  Each player chooses three of these cards to use in round one, and puts aside the remaining three cards - you will use the second set of three cards in round two.<br/><br/>In your turn, you select and play one card from your hand.  Then the player on your left takes a turn, and so on, until each player has played all three of their cards in hand.<br/><br/>When you play a card, you choose one of four actions:<br/>A    Place pieces into a region;<br/>B    Play a Stone of Destiny card to swap 2 pieces in a region;<br/>C    Discard the card and pay 4 cumals to declare an amnesty that releases all captives from a region;<br/>D    Discard the card to gain 2 cumals.<br/><br/>If you placed or swapped pieces, you may pay the card's Activation Cost to promote from two of your adjacent pieces to the space immediately above them.  For example, if you placed a herdsman next to another of your herdsmen, you could pay the Activation Cost and put a piece above both herdsmen into the space at the warrior level.  The object is to gain a King in the region by promoting to the King space.<br/><br/>By placing or promoting pieces you might capture opposing pieces and release those of your own that have been previously captured.<br/><br/>After each player has played the three cards in hand, there is an End of Round sequence.  Each region may have a traitor.  The player who owns the traitor swaps one of their pieces for an opponent's piece and may then pay to promote from the traitor's space.  Once all traitors have been actioned, players collect income, dependent on the number of pieces they have on the board and their rank.  Then remove pieces from any region containing a new King; the player with the new King establishes a garrison in the region, captives are removed and exchange or ransom of prisoners may occur.  Finally the Starting Player chooses a new Starting Player for the next round.  A new round then begins, using the three cards set aside by each player if they remain, or by dealing another six cards to each player and splitting them into two sets of three as at the start of the game.<br/><br/>The game continues until one player has a King in two different regions.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": ["First edition"], "name": "Tara, Seat of Kings", "playingtime": "45", "boardgamemechanic": ["Hand Management"], "age": "10", "usersrated": "164", "boardgamesubdomain": ["Abstract Games"], "average": "6.28793", "boardgamepodcastepisode": ["Tara - Seat of Kings Review"]}, "20822": {"boardgamedesigner": ["Jennifer Durand", "Laura Pizzarello Scott"], "poll": [], "name": "The Yoga Garden Game", "playingtime": "30", "minplayers": "1", "boardgamemechanic": ["Acting", "Co-operative Play", "Roll / Spin and Move"], "yearpublished": "2000", "usersrated": "4", "maxplayers": "0", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic186910_t.jpg", "average": "4", "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["Jennifer Durand"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic186910.jpg", "boardgameversion": ["First edition"], "maxplaytime": "30", "boardgamecategory": ["Action / Dexterity"], "age": "4", "minplaytime": "30", "description": "In The Yoga Garden Game you roll a die and move a bumblebee through a circular garden.

The game consists of 64 double-sided wood tiles (each tile consisting of four letters with number values assigned to each letter along with a hole for the placing of a colored peg)<br/><br/>The object of the game is simple.  Players compete for high score by identifying words within a maze of letters and scoring points based on the letters they use.  As players identify words, they insert a colored peg in the hole of each letter used to form the word.  Adjoining letters may be up, down, left, right or diagonal.  The letters must be joined in sequence, and may be used more than once within the same word.  Letters have varying point values, and may be used a maximum of three times during the game.<br/><br/>The first time a letter is used, it counts as a single point value, and a green peg is inserted in the hole of the letter.  The second time a letter is used, the point value is doubled and a yellow peg replaces the green peg.  The third and final time a letter is used, the point value is tripled, and a red peg replaces the yellow peg.  Once a letter has been used three times, it is expired and may not be used again for the remainder of the game.  (While playing the game, think of a stoplight &ndash; first play the green, then the yellow, and finally the red at which time play is stopped for that letter.)<br/><br/>The key to making this game so enjoyable is the ability to use the same letter multiple times within the same word, to move in any direction to connect letters and to limit the use of individual letters to a maximum of three times.<br/><br/>Game contents include a game board, sixty-four wood double-sided tiles (each side contains four letters, numbers and holes), 300 colored pegs, plastic case for the pegs, blue organization bag for the tiles, two-minute sand timer, very descriptive game instructions with color illustrations of the first twelve turns, and score pad.<br/><br/>2006 Mensa Select<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": ["English edition", "English edition"], "average": "6.4481", "name": "Keesdrow", "playingtime": "60", "boardgamemechanic": ["Modular Board"], "age": "8", "usersrated": "105", "boardgamesubdomain": ["Family Games"], "boardgamefamily": ["Mensa Select"]}, "20830": {"boardgamedesigner": ["(Uncredited)"], "poll": [], "name": "Antonym Line Up", "playingtime": "0", "minplayers": "2", "yearpublished": "0", "usersrated": "0", "maxplayers": "3", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic101821_t.jpg", "average": "0", "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["Creative Teaching Associates"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic101821.jpg", "boardgameversion": ["First edition"], "maxplaytime": "0", "boardgamecategory": ["Educational", "Word Game"], "age": "0", "minplaytime": "0", "description": "Three levels of difficulty are included in this fast-paced tic-tac-toe styled game.

The soup was lumpy and the main course was stodgy and overcooked. Now dessert is served&mdash;the table is laden with Chocolate Mousse, Rice Pudding, Cherry Pie, Fruit Salad and so much more. The guests start to grin wickedly&hellip;<br/><br/>The object of Splat! is to furiously flinging food at other players while dodging food they are throwing back at you. The more food that hits you, the messier you get. At the end of the game, the cleanest players are allowed to think that they&rsquo;ve won.<br/><br/>The game uses three types of cards:<br/><br/>Food Cards : Each food card has a special power which takes effect when the food is either eaten, or is thrown at another player and hits.  Some of these powers are long lasting while others are instant (e.g. the banana split is vitamin fortified and so increases a players hand size, while the revolutionary cupcakes contain added additives which force you to throw all your food at other players). Food cards are either green (generally beneficial powers) and red (generally not beneficial).<br/><br/>And Then Cards : Event cards which can be played during the food throwing process to impact the course of the game.  These cards act as interrupts which provide much of the interactive story telling character of the game (e.g. Amy throws Birthday Cake at Clare but Bob catches it and throws it back at Amy on his next turn). These cards can also be played as dodges to avoid food that is thrown at you.<br/><br/>Object Cards : Throughout the game players may also stand in front of objects (e.g. The Children, The Gnu, Uncle Harry or The Mirror).  If a player standing in front of an object dodges then the food hits the object instead and the thrower gets yelled at by either the Host or the Hostess--forcing them to discard all their And Then cards and eat a food (if they have one).<br/><br/>Each player has a 'You' card with 5 hit locations--when food hits someone the thrower rolls to see where (Head, 2 x Arms, 2 x Legs, 1's miss).  Food which hits a location that is already messy replaces the previous food.<br/><br/>The Butler (Jeeves) also has a hit location card--players may choose to throw food at him through the game and in addition any food that is thrown which does not hit a player or an object may hit Jeeves instead.  Once Jeeves is completely covered with food he chases the players out of the house, ending the game.<br/><br/>Splat! is a reworking of Ed Carter's 1992 food-fight card game, Kersplatt!<br/><br/><br/>"}, "20839": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic741619.jpg", "poll": [], "boardgamedesigner": ["Roberto Bonsi"], "statistics": [], "yearpublished": "1984", "maxplayers": "2", "boardgameartist": ["Enea Riboldi"], "boardgamepublisher": ["International Team"], "maxplaytime": "180", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic741619_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "180", "boardgamecategory": ["Wargame", "World War II"], "description": "Mockba International Teams  (W122)<br/><br/>CONTENTS<br/><br/>280 counters<br/>01 rigid map (in two pieces)<br/>01 book of rules<br/>01 book of example and tables<br/>01 6 sided die<br/><br/><br/>GAME DATA<br/><br/>Unit scale: Division through Brigade<br/>Turn length: 1 week<br/>Hex scale: the game doesn't mention it but I think 12 mile for hex<br/>Complexity: IT value OOOO<br/><br/><br/>To the end of September 1941 the forecasts of the Fuhrer seemed to come true: the end of the campaign, before the advent of the winter and the complete destruction of the<br/>Russian army, it was to capacity of hands.<br/>The armed order of the day of the group center very spoke 73 divisions about infantry and 13 destroyed enemy armored divisions.However the situation was not still completely under control regarding the previous experiences, in fact the great created bags did not yield but they continued to<br/>resist beyond every expectation.A last effort was therefore necessary.With a superiority of men and means of 2 to 1 and in sky of 3 to 1 that one began that had to be the last and definitive offensive...<br/><br/>Re-implemented by:<br/><br/>    Moskva<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>", "minplayers": "1", "boardgameversion": ["First edition"], "name": "MOCKBA", "playingtime": "180", "boardgamemechanic": ["Hex-and-Counter"], "average": "6.39474", "usersrated": "19", "boardgamesubdomain": ["Wargames"], "age": "12"}, "20840": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1465163.jpg", "poll": [], "boardgamedesigner": ["Gerhard E.

If the German High Seas Fleet could catch and destroy a portion of the much larger British Grand Fleet, the blockade suffocating Imperial Germany might finally be broken.<br/><br/>Great War at Sea: Jutland is an extensively updated version of the earlier GWAS Vol. II: The North and Baltic Seas published in 1998. It covers not only the signature battle, but also the many other sorties of the High Seas Fleet like the Scarborough, Lowestoft and Gorleston Raids, the Battle of Dogger Bank and Helgoland Bight.<br/><br/>Like all games in the Great War at Sea series, this one is packed with scenarios. Along with the operations in the North Sea, the game also includes the bitterly-fought naval war in the Baltic Sea. Here the roles are reversed, with the smaller Imperial Russian Navy aggressively seeking an advantage against the larger German forces. The Russian cruiser raids are all covered, as well as the climactic Battle of Moon Sound.<br/><br/>The scenario book includes not only more than 40 scenarios, it&rsquo;s packed with the background information about the ships, the men and the battles.<br/><br/>The map covers the North and Baltic Seas, as well as the waters around the British Isles; it&rsquo;s a bit larger than the map in the previous edition. The smaller navies of the region are all represented as well: Sweden, Norway, Denmark, the Netherlands.<br/><br/>But it&rsquo;s the major powers that get most of the ships. The Royal Navy is huge, with ships ranging from ancient paddle-driven minesweepers to modern battle cruisers like Repulse and Renown. Famous ships like the battleships Dreadnought and Iron Duke, the inaptly-named battle cruiser Invincible, and early aircraft carriers like Engadine and Argus are all here.<br/><br/>The German High Seas Fleet has all the ships that challenged England, from the tiny coast defense ship Siegfried up to the huge battleships Sachsen and W&uuml;rttemburg. The Germans have zeppelins and submarines to help redress the balance somewhat, but it will take skilled play to overcome Britain&rsquo;s sea dogs.<br/><br/>Russia has modern dreadnoughts, but will depend on her armored cruisers and a squadron of older battleships for most missions.<br/><br/>As with other games in the series, the tactical map is a generic blue field of hexagons, used to resolve surface combat. There, ships maneuver and fight using their gunnery and torpedo factors. Each player rolls a number of dice according to the ship&rsquo;s capabilities, hitting on a result of 6.

The winner is the player who's earned the most Favor!<br/><br/>All For One is a pickup/deliver game for 3-5 players. Players are not tied to any specific character, rather each turn you choose which character to activate and then take actions with that character. Each player is secretly assigned one of the characters whose score will be added to their own at the end of the game. Your 'secret identity' helps drive decisions during the game, but in order to win you'll have to utilize all of the characters.<br/><br/>The board is an interconnected web of streets, some of which are patrolled by Cardinal's Guards. The guards serve to hinder the musketeers' progress. There are 6 named locations where the characters begin the game, and the other 18 locations are home to 1 plot token each. 2 of the tokens are horses, which can be ridden by the characters.

The four colors are red, blue, green and yellow.<br/><br/>To set up, you attach 12 articles of clothing to the washing line, three of each color of pants, shirt and socks (in increasing order of difficulty), wind up the mechanism and let it go. The clothes line spins and the players hit the paddles to make their dog leap up to grab the clothing.<br/><br/>The winner of the game is the person the highest score. you get 10 points for pants, 15 for the tee-shirt and 20 for the socks in your color. Each article of clothing your dog gets that isn't in your color costs you 30 points, so it pays to be a bit careful.<br/><br/>A warning to parents... This is quite a noisy game to play, but each game only lasts for about two minutes.<br/><br/>"}}
