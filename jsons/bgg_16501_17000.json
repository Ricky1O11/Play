This row can be horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. The cubical building bricks are all unique, come in 4 colours, and the only placement restriction is that each colour is only allowed once in each level or column. When the last brick is added, the completed wall will be 4x4.<br/><br/>On 2 opposing faces of each cube, a groove has been carved out. There are 4 distinct grooves, and the twist is that these grooves rarely mirror each other on either side of a cube. Therefor the wall face will look completely different to each player. The grooves are paired in such a way that within each group of 4 identically coloured cubes, only one cube has an identical shape on both sides (a different one for each colour). The other combinations are unique for that colour, and each combo occurs only one other time within the entire set.<br/><br/>At the start of the game, the cubes are placed on coloured supply strips which show the 4 'footprints' of all the blocks that exist for each colour. The wall is build on the table surface between the players. Players can only see the top cube of each column and the shape of the groove on their side of the wall of the cubes below it. Forward planning, memory skills and deduction all come into play to some extent, as players above all need to prevent that the opponent gets the sequence of 4 first. The supply strips serve as gentle reminders of what is out there.<br/><br/>The pro-version introduces the rule that an opponent can force a player to take back the last played cube if it would prevent the wall from completion, and instead insist on the placement of a cube that would result in a wall with the maximum amount of bricks.

Play, roll the dice and become 'Master of the Game'.<br/><br/>Aim of the Game:<br/>Try to reach the finish first with your swing-top bottle, pay the bill and win the game.<br/><br/>Gameplay synopsis With your swing-top bottle you travel from start to finish. Along the way you need to answer various questions or fulfill assignments. But watch out! Every ring brings you closer to the finish, but the questions and assignments become more difficult too. You go from one ring to the next via the doorman ar an open door. But... you don't reach the finish that easily. First you will need to make sure that you have paid your bill. With the beer voucher you won, you can pay the innkeeper. You win these vouchers by correctly answering the questions or fulfilling the assignments.<br/><br/>The Grolsch Master game is a promotional game from the Dutch brewery Grolsch, world famous (in the Netherlands) for it's swing-top bottles. The game is a party game that combines aspects of Trivial Pursuit, Pictionary, Charades etc.<br/><br/>The Trivia questions are divided into the categories Film, Beer, Sports and Various, each category containing 50 cards of 4 questions with increasing difficulty. The question you are asked depends on the ring you are in, the closer to the center, the more difficult the question should be. There are also 150 'the Pub' cards with 4 assignments that require you to draw, impersonate, act out or imitate persons, animals situations or even your thoughts on a particular matter (that you have written down beforehand). A sixth set of cards (30 brewery cards) are comparable to the 'Chance' cards of Monopoly.<br/><br/>You roll the die to determine the number of steps you have to take (you can decide whether you travel clockwise or counter clockwise), and depending on the square you land upon, you need to answer a question or carry out an assignment, you can get to the next ring or you get to draw a 'Brewery' (Chance) card. If you answer a question correctly, you get a beer voucher, otherwise you have to pay a beer voucher. If one of the other players guesses your assignment correctly, both get a beer voucher.<br/><br/>There a two possibilities to get to the next ring: via an open door, or via a doorman. The doorman requires payment in the form of beer vouchers. When you reach the final ring, you need to have enough beer vouchers to pay your bill.

Tied to the single-line of the Western and Atlantic Railroad for supply, and marching through a wilderness, Sherman could not afford to run up a huge butcher's bill. A too bloody summer's victory in Northern Georgia could easily result in a November defeat for President Lincoln in the forthcoming general election. On the other side General Johnston, commanding the defending Army of Tennessee, was no less vexed. He had attempted to whip his flagging forces into shape, despite sagging morale and a lack of reinforcements, but he knew this was a battle he could not afford to lose.

In this game, players use their favorite shamans to fight one-on-one duels in order to crown a Shaman King. It&rsquo;s fast-paced and furious fun!<br/><br/>The Shaman King TCG is kind of like the traditional card game War. Like War, Shaman King TCG players don&rsquo;t have a hand of cards. Instead, players take turns flipping cards from the top of their decks and comparing their attacks. The Shaman King TCG is also different than War. When you play War, you only have one chance to match or defeat your opponent&rsquo;s attack. In the Shaman King TCG, you have three chances, represented by the three colored zones. In War, cards are free to play, but in the Shaman King TCG, cards cost furyoku to play. Watch your furyoku carefully, and you&rsquo;ll be successful.<br/><br/>The Shaman King TCG is easy to learn. Players take turns attacking their opponents with strike cards while defending against their opponent&rsquo;s attacks at the same time. If your opponent fails to stop your strike in each of his or her three zones, you score a point. The first person to score three points wins the game.<br/><br/>Strikes aren&rsquo;t the only thing you need to win a shaman duel. Sneaky tactics, represented by advantage cards, and help from one&rsquo;s friends, represented by teamwork cards, will mean the difference between winning and losing the game.<br/><br/>Each shaman also has a different set of signature moves that you can find on the special pull-out card inside the Shaman Chamber CardTM.

The object is to put the opponent's Helios in checkmate (or &quot;total eclipse&quot;).<br/><br/>In addition to the rules themselves, the rulebook includes information on the gods and planets represented by the pieces.<br/><br/>"}, "16925": {"boardgamedesigner": ["(Uncredited)"], "poll": [], "name": "Sailboat Race Game", "playingtime": "0", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": ["Roll / Spin and Move"], "yearpublished": "1970", "usersrated": "0", "boardgamefamily": ["Sports: Sailing"], "maxplayers": "4", "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic71475_t.jpg", "average": "0", "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["Built-Rite", "Tee Pee Toys, Jessup Paper Box Co."], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic71475.jpg", "boardgameversion": ["Built-Rite Edition", "Tee Pee Toys Edition"], "maxplaytime": "0", "boardgamecategory": ["Children's Game", "Racing"], "age": "4", "minplaytime": "0", "description": "Simple roll and move game for boys and girls Ages 4 - 8<br/><br/>"}, "16926": {"boardgamedesigner": ["(Uncredited)"], "poll": [], "name": "Super Plug", "playingtime": "15", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": ["Hand Management"], "yearpublished": "1999", "usersrated": "5", "maxplayers": "6", "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic203472_t.jpg", "average": "3.2", "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["Amorphous Blob Games"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic203472.jpg", "maxplaytime": "15", "boardgamecategory": ["Card Game", "Humor"], "age": "10", "minplaytime": "15", "description": "&quot;You don't know the power of the plug!&quot;<br/><br/>Cards and rules in an envelope, following the Cheapass design philosophy.

Having lived in off-campus apartments during college, I can relate.<br/><br/>Each player is given a playing mat with a picture of a toilet on it and is dealt one card.  On each player's turn they may draw from 0-2 cards and play one card, either on their own toilet or another player's.  The winner is the first person to exactly reach a predetermined level of points worth of stuff in their toilet (20 points for a two player game, 18 for three, etc.)  Some cards are worth negative points and are played on opponents.  That person must then remove that many points worth of stuff from their toilet.  If they don't have any cards small enough (say a -2 card was played, for instance) they must discard a larger card (Baby Brother [+5] for instance) and accept the greater loss--no making change allowed.  There are also Pet cards.  While a player has a Pet card next to their toilet they cannot win even if their toilet is full to the required score--the landlord doesn't allow pets.  They may discard the Pet card, but this counts as their entire action for the turn and they may not draw or play any other cards.<br/><br/>Each copy of Super Plug also comes with 5 blank cards.

At the start of play, each player places his pawn in front of one of those rows. Each player also takes twelve polyominoes &mdash; that is, pieces consisting of 2-5 squares in some configuration; players use these pieces each round to try to recreate shapes.<br/><br/>At the start of a round, each player receives a puzzle card that depicts a shape created by some number of squares; one side of this card depicts six rows of 3 pieces, the other side depicts six rows of 4 pieces, for a more difficult puzzle. When everyone is ready, someone rolls a die to determine which row of pieces each player can use to recreate the shape on their individual card. The race is timed by a sand timer, and the outcome of this race determines the action on the main playing board.<br/><br/>Whoever first solves their puzzle in time gets to move their pawn up to three rows left or right, with the second player to finish moving two rows and the third player only one row. Players then collect two gems from the front of the row where their pawn is located, which means that the more rows you can move, the more control you have over which color gems you can collect. After collecting gems, each player receives a new puzzle card, and a new round begins.<br/><br/>After nine rounds, the game ends and whoever has collected the most gems in a single color wins!

The goal is to keep your token on the board longer than anyone else's, but as the board fills up this becomes harder because there are fewer empty spaces left... and another player's tile may also extend your own path in a direction you'd rather not go.  Easy to introduce to new players, Tsuro lasts a mere 15 minutes and actually does work for any number from 2 to 8.<br/><br/>Theme:<br/><br/>Tsuro has an Asian spiritual theme - the lines representing the &quot;many roads that lead to divine wisdom&quot;, and the game as a whole representing &quot;the classic quest for enlightenment&quot;.<br/><br/>This theme is very light and the game essentially plays as an abstract.<br/><br/>Gameplay:<br/><br/>The game consists of tiles with twisting lines on them, a 6x6 grid on which to lay these tiles and a token for each player. Each player has a hand of tiles. On your turn you do two things: place a tile from your hand onto the board next to your token and move your token as far as it can go along the line it is currently on, until it is stopped by an empty space with no tile in (yet), the edge of the board or colliding with another player's token. If your token reaches the edge of the board or collides with another player's token, you are out of the game. The aim of the game is to be the last player left with a token on the board. Strategy therefore consists of trying to drive your opponents either into each other or off the board whilst extending your own route in directions that will make it difficult for your opponents to do the same.<br/><br/>Other notes:<br/><br/>Tsuro was originally patented by McMurchie in 1979 under the name Squiggle Game, but was apparently not published at that time.
