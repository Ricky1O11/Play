However, don&rsquo;t be fooled by the simple objective! You will be tested in many ways, and perhaps if you make smart moves and think strategically then you will emerge victorious. Accomplishing the objective will be much harder than it seems, especially since you are racing against opponents that have every reason to prevent you from reaching your objective so that he or she may win the game. Think you are winning big time? Seconds later you are losing horribly. Got a strategy you think works every time? Not so much. Prepare for excitement and disappointment, structure and disarray, this is Organized Chaos!<br/><br/>Everyone starts the game with one card in their hand. A token marks each players draw pile because it is very likely that one or more may end up face up at some point in the game. During a turn a player draws one card, giving them two in their hand. Each card has two sides, each with a different ability. The player may choose which card to play and which side of the card to invoke. Most cards have a side that is offensive and one that is defensive. For example, the most common type of card has Burn on one side and Refresh on the other. Burn allows you to choose an opponent and they must &quot;Burn&quot; or place the top X cards from their draw pile directly in their discard pile. Whereas, Refresh let's you take the top X cards from your discard pile on the bottom of your draw pile in any order.<br/><br/>There are also special cards that let you do things like flip yours or an opponents draw pile face up so everyone sees what their next card will be, another that lets you switch your entire deck with one of your opponents. There are several other cards that do similarly things to turn the game upside down. Use them all to your advantage to force your opponents' to lose all their cards and you will be the last one standing!<br/><br/>See our website for official rules updates or to purchase this and other Van Ryder Games.<br/><br/>"}, "99017": {"rpgitemversion": {"99269": "PDF Version"}, "poll": {}, "name": "Sinistres Strandgut", "rpgproducer": {"3": "(Uncredited)"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1231980.jpg", "usersrated": "0", "average": "0", "statistics": {}, "rpg": {"10501": "Destiny"}, "rpgcategory": {"2084": "Scenario / Adventure / Module"}, "rpggenre": {"961": "Fantasy"}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1231980_t.jpg", "description": "User summary:<br/><br/>A brief scenario set on Valmorca involving a shipwreck and a necromancer.

Each one of you has to build total, 5 buildings in the 3 different sectors of the board (Mainframe). The Mainframe is divided in the Grey, the Red and the Gold Sector. You have to build 2 Constructions in each sector and 1 in the Gold and last one. The Buildings come to your possession through the Architectonic Plans. Each Sector hides unique constructions but traps too as well as it offers a variety of choices.<br/><br/>Your rival Architects won't allow you to reach the gold and they will use all the means of the game such as the Hazard Cards. Using them, can seriously damage your constructions. On the other hand, the Mainframe wouldn't let you exposed, to them. That's why it offers the Construction Assurances. Thanks to these cards you will be protected, however, up to a point. Still, your rivals can use the Grids, obstacles that they place on the Mainframe and specifically in the area where you build and can delay you a lot. Place your pawn on the Pavement (outer board), draw your Plans, buy raw materials, hire the necessary Groups of Workers, get the License of your Construction and start building. But be careful, if you cheat, then the Construction Inspector will lead you out of the Mainframe. Since you complete your building, you collect a standard payment as well as different bonuses matching the different board-combinations where the Mainframe offers to you.<br/><br/>Maybe this game seems easy and known but Biruda offers innovative mechanisms where you will meet duing the play. To prove yourself among the other and be the Master Architect you have to move with caution. The Pavement around gives to all the chance to draw different card sets and these cards will be proved veru useful during your work. Still this game differs a lot thanks to its variations such the board pieces of the Mainframe where you can connect them in different ways and reform the whole city. Among the Hazards, there are Earthquake Cards and based on their effects you can change totally the game. The most important here is that even if a rival Architect has managed to reach the Gold Sector and you are far behind, well with a single move you can restore the balance and be the winner.<br/><br/>THE MAINFRAME IS NOW OPEN!<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": {"99318": "Multilingual first edition"}, "age": "8", "name": "Biruda", "playingtime": "45", "boardgamemechanic": {"2046": "Area Movement"}, "average": "10", "usersrated": "1", "boardgamefamily": {"22184": "Admin: Unreleased Games"}}, "99038": {"boardgamedesigner": {"2": {"name": "Reiner Knizia"}}, "poll": {}, "name": "Monkeyland", "playingtime": "15", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": {"2047": "Memory"}, "yearpublished": "2011", "usersrated": "38", "boardgamefamily": {"7178": "Animals: Apes / Monkeys"}, "maxplayers": "5", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1046210_t.jpg", "average": "5.69737", "statistics": {}, "boardgamepublisher": {"2862": {"name": "The Game Master BV"}}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1046210.jpg", "boardgameversion": {"158058": "Dutch first edition"}, "maxplaytime": "15", "boardgamecategory": {"1041": {"name": "Children's Game"}}, "age": "5", "minplaytime": "15", "description": "Monkeyland is a memory variation by Reiner Knizia.<br/>You have to find the monkey with the favorite meal corresponding to the food-chip you revealed.

Although interest among the hardcore audience is high, it has currently not been published outside of Japan due to the genre's dwindling popularity in North America and arcade gaming in general.<br/><br/>Ibara is very similar to 8ing/Raizing's Battle Garegga and Battle Bakraid games (in fact, Shinobu Yagawa, the programmer for the aforementioned games, worked on this game). So much so that Ibara could be considered a pseudo-sequel or, at least, a spiritual successor. The similarities are numerous - some are subtle, some are easily spotted. These include combining archaic technology such as biplanes with more advanced machinery; firing and power-up system; and a medal collecting system which drastically increases scoring. The game features a similar method of earning bombs and a delay when launching them as well. Some of the enemies and their attack patterns are very familiar such as the large cranes in stage 1 and the minigun-wielding first boss. The enemy's explosions spiral around when destroying some of the heavier weapons/scenery and thin, seemingly camouflaged enemy bullets are scattered around the play area in comparable patterns. More subtle references include the HUD layout which lists the name of the current stage at the top of the screen and, when starting a stage, tells users the title of the background music that is playing.<br/><br/>A notable feature of Ibara is the inclusion of a variable, real-time difficulty system by way of the Rank system. The player's rank increases as they acquire more items and cause more damage, increasing the difficulty of the game along with it. The number of enemies doesn't increase but the number of bullets fired towards the user does, often reaching a ridiculous level of bullet density. There are ways of lowering this rank system if the odds appear too much. The only known way of decreasing your Rank in Ibara is to die. The more lives you have, the less the rank decreases when you die.

The director is SEGA employee Tetsu Okano, who has previously worked on Segagaga, Astro Boy: Omega Factor and Gunstar Super Heroes. The game was licensed by Twenty-One Company's Tecnosoft division, it is only available in Japan.<br/><br/>Plot<br/><br/>It is the year A.D. 2161, ten years after the artificial intelligence known as Guardian went rogue and its subsequent destruction at the hands of Cenes Crawford, the pilot from the events of Thunder Force V. As Earth reenters an age of prosperity after the previous war with the AI, an extraterrestrial force known only as &quot;Orn Faust&quot; appears to start an invasion of the planet. Unfortunately, the Unified Earth Fleet is powerless under the might of the alien forces and is almost destroyed. Meanwhile, the Unified Earth government receives strange readings from its analysis report of the underground chamber on the island Babel, where Guardian was once installed. Inside, the remaining Vasteel technology which was abandoned and sealed by the government shows a startling synchronization with Orn Faust's approach.<br/><br/>As researchers analyze the once forbidden technology they had abandoned ten years ago, they find an alarming message embedded within the fragments. It is said that Vasteel was once Rynex, the ultimate weapon created by the extraterrestrial power called the Galaxy Federation, used to combat the evil Orn Empire. The message also contained a warning of their impending arrival and an interstellar call for help against the Orn forces, which is trying to spread its influence of death and destruction to other parts of the universe. In addition, the storage cells within Vasteel material contains four space coordinates leading to the homeworld of the Galaxy Federation. Left with no other choice, scientists recreate the Vasteel technology into the experimental starfighter known as Phoenix, the last hope for the human race against Orn Faust.<br/><br/>Gameplay<br/><br/>Sega has created a 3D scrolling system for the next-gen Thunder Force VI, where the gameplay proceeds in 2D as before in previous games but scenery moves in three dimensions. There are oftentimes where the player ships executes rolls, turns or dives in the background, though gameplay is not hampered by this new addition. Each ship is equipped with five types of weapon arms and an Over Weapon, a special weapon gauge which collects energy gained by destroying Orn forces to unleash a powerful attack.<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;Thunder Force VI&quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "99041": {"statistics": {}, "name": "Dodonpachi Dai-Ou-Jou", "videogamemode": {"2422": "Local Multiplayer"}, "videogameversion": {"99327": "Japanese Arcade (Black Label) edition"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic996186.jpg", "videogameseries": {"6775": "DonPachi"}, "videogametheme": {"2264": "Science Fiction"}, "usersrated": "5", "average": "7.9", "videogamegenre": {"2505": "Shoot 'em Up"}, "videogameplatform": {"4781": "Arcade"}, "poll": {}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic996186_t.jpg", "description": "DoDonPachi Dai Ou Jou is the fourth arcade game in Cave's DonPachi series. It is considered to be the &quot;true&quot; sequel to DoDonPachi.[citation needed] Dai Ou Jou is renowned for both its level of difficulty and its highly refined gameplay. The &quot;Dai Ou Jou&quot; portion of the title translates as &quot;peaceful death&quot;, which is a wry reference to the overwhelming and frantic manner in which players meet their end.<br/><br/>Story<br/><br/>Centuries have passed since the catastrophic war that almost cost the human race its complete annihilation at the hands of the deranged commander of the DonPachi Corps, a military squad of starfighter pilots known for their combat prowess and emotional detachment (as a result of the inhuman training they are subjected to - the first game being a prime example of it, with the trainee actually slaughtering comrades posing as the enemy); whatever remained of his genocidal army was gathered, transported to the Moon and sealed within a network of caves, left to rot away as the nightmares faded into legend.<br/><br/>The human race flourished again, to the point of colonizing the Moon itself, the megacity of Lunapolis being the hub of human activity on lunar soil. However, as time passed, the dormant machines reawakened, rebuilt, evolved: the undeground caverns of the planet swarmed with all sorts of advanced warmachines, and automated production facilities, at their core a heavily guarded platform where the ultimate fighting machine of the past, the mechanical bee Hibachi, was slowly being rebuilt. Still following their original programming, the machines broke the seal, invading the surface and quickly seizing control of the almost defenseless Lunapolis, its streets and facilities now completely overtaken and littered with heavy artillery emplacements.<br/><br/>With little time to spare, the DonPachi Corps are reactivated, with enough time to build only two fighters; nevertheless, to each was bestowed the assistance of an Element Doll, highly evolved sentient droids (apparently widespread in human society by then, and treated as little more than slaves) capable of providing tactical data and enhancing the craft's own capabilities. Knowing that the mission is plausibly suicidal, the two attack ships are deployed on the Moon surface, just outside of Lunapolis, alone against a ruthless army of machines with a single objective.<br/><br/>Game System Overview<br/><br/>The controls in Dai Ou Jou are identical to the previous games in the series.[citation needed] The joystick (or controller on the PS2 version) moves the ship. Tapping button 1 fires standard shots, and holding button 1 fires the laser weapon. Pressing button 2 activates a hyper if one is available, or uses a bomb if no hypers are in stock. If the laser is active the bomb is an amplification of the laser weapon; otherwise it is an explosion that covers the screen. In all cases the player becomes invincible for a short period. There is also an option to enable button 3, which automatically fires only the standard shots, otherwise known as &quot;auto(matic) fire&quot;<br/><br/>Dai Ou Jou follows the conventions of the previous game with only a few changes.[citation needed] The chaining system is intact and works in much the same way.[citation needed] Causing an enemy to explode fills a meter, and every enemy destroyed before the meter depletes adds to the current chain and again refills the meter. Holding the laser weapon over a large enemy will hold the meter steady and slowly accumulate hits. In this way it is possible to create a single chain out of any of the 5 stages, although this requires much practice and skill.<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;DoDonPachi Dai Ou Jou&quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "99042": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic995589.jpg", "poll": {}, "boardgamedesigner": {"337": {"name": "Joseph Miranda"}}, "statistics": {}, "yearpublished": "2011", "maxplayers": "2", "boardgameartist": {"20072": "Larry Hoffman"}, "boardgamepublisher": {"102": {"name": "Decision Games (I)"}}, "maxplaytime": "300", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic995589_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "300", "boardgamecategory": {"2726": {"name": "Age of Reason"}}, "description": "The American Revolution: Decision in North America (AR), is a two-player wargame, designed by Joseph Miranda, in which you command the Americans or the British in the War of American Independence, 1775-82.

Recreating four battles of the Grossdeutschland Panzer from the eastern front in 1943 and 1944, this first game of the series includes: Lutchessa Valley, Kursk, Akhtyrka and Mischurin Rog (each played on its own detailed and historically accurate map).<br/><br/>The Famous Divisions Series offers a new concept: play is governed by the drawing of &quot;Event Chits&quot; during combat. Combat is not simply resolved by comparing the attack strengths and defense strengths of units as effected by terrain; rather, it's modified by random chit draws of over 140 possible &quot;events&quot; that introduce the elements of chaos and unpredictability to combat resolution. Event Chits can be nullified by other Event Chits; so players never know how an attack may be resolved based solely on odds ratios and terrain. The number of chits a given side may hold and draw also serves as an easy measure of its elite (or non-elite) status.<br/><br/>Each hex represents approximately 500 meters from side to opposite side. Each game turn represents approximately six hours; however, the game turns aren't divided into separate friendly and enemy player turns. Rather, each is made up of numerous individual HQ activations. All HQ activation chits are placed in a cup, and each is drawn one at a time to initiate the activation (movement and combat) of a particular headquarters and its associated companies. When that HQ&rsquo;s activation is finished, a new HQ is drawn from the cup, and then its activation begins.<br/><br/>Combat units are individual companies featuring distinct vehicles and weapons, which are shown as icons along with the numeric representations of the capabilities of the vehicle or weapon portrayed. Play is therefore tactical in many respects: units have individual range values, different movement capabilities depending on type (wheeled, tracked or leg), and rules cover such things as demolishing bridges, pontoon bridges, weather, overrun, supply, infantry riding tanks, direct and ranged fire, artillery barrages, opportunity fire, night, fortifications (bunkers, trenches, mines, dragon&rsquo;s teeth), engineers, armor recovery vehicles, airpower and anti-aircraft artillery.<br/><br/>While not a purpose-designed solitaire system, the chit mechanisms make the series easily adaptable to such play, since the player won't know what chits may be drawn that could alter combat, or in what order the HQ activations will take place. Some examples of the 140 Event Chits are: Sniper, Good Commander, Ambush, Experienced NCO, Caught in Crossfire, Fanatic, Radio Out, Critical Hit, Frontal Assault, Elite Troops, Outflanked, Hand-to-Hand Combat, and Friendly Fire.<br/><br/>Published in World at War magazine #20, Oct-Nov 2011.<br/><br/>Game Scale:<br/>Game Turn: 6 hours<br/>Hex: 550 yards / 503 meters<br/>Units: companies<br/><br/>Game Inventory:<br/>Two 22 x 34&quot; full color mapsheets<br/>Two dual-side printed countersheets (560 1/2&quot; counters)<br/>One 32-page Gross Deutschland Panzer rulebook<br/><br/>Solitaire Playability: Medium<br/>Complexity Level: Medium<br/>Players: 2 or more<br/>Playing Time: 3-20<br/><br/>"}, "99063": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1077788.jpg", "poll": {}, "boardgamedesigner": {"337": {"name": "Joseph Miranda"}}, "statistics": {}, "yearpublished": "2012", "maxplayers": "0", "boardgameartist": {"1893": "Joe Youst"}, "boardgamepublisher": {"102": {"name": "Decision Games (I)"}}, "maxplaytime": "0", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1077788_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "0", "boardgamecategory": {"1019": {"name": "Wargame"}}, "description": "Minsk '44: East Front Battles, Volume II, covers the crucial exploitation phase of the great Soviet summer offensive against the German Army Group Center.

Players one after another try to explain, show by pantomime or draw any word and all the others do their best to understand it. A performing player and those who coped with guessing words get winning points. Sometimes it happens that you need to describe several words but the time is always limited. Moreover player can cut down his time or make his task harder by any other way to earn more points. Players take the word samples from the hat or something modeling it. They decide how to fill the hat choosing words themes, their difficulty or language. It&rsquo;s easily possible to come across with unknown words or you can compose the tasks by your own self.<br/><br/>This parlor game has got its name after the game popular in many companies where you have to explain words written down at the sheets of paper that are put into a hat. The game mechanics is based on the popular russian games such as &ldquo;Associations&rdquo;, &ldquo;Crocodile&rdquo;, &ldquo;Stooping dog&rdquo;. Mostly well-known western board games of this genre are Activity and Alias. <br/>The Hat cards are the basis of the game &ndash; they describe the way of representing the word: to explain by words, to show or to draw it.<br/><br/>Players draw cards with face up from The Hat pile by turn and define the way of the word explanation. Finally played words bring winning points marked at the card. Also cards recount the time for the performance. It&rsquo;s possible to reduce explanation time to increase points. In this case the time is fixed by a dice roll. <br/>There are also 3 other card types with extra explanation terms. You get more points if you succeed using these cards. For example, you can take a complication card &ldquo;draw a word with your left hand&rdquo; as an addition to a simple drawing task.<br/><br/>The main trait of The Hat game is in the unlimited ways of using words. Only you decide what word should appear in the hat and what will be guessed by your company. Varieties are numerous because Russian dictionary contains 140 000 different words, and it&rsquo;s possible to play using any foreign language as well.<br/><br/>The game box contains of several word sets that differ by difficulty. They are sealed so nobody will see them before the game begins. You need to cut the word sets into the hat without opening it.<br/><br/>It also happens that players get tired of the word game after guessing the same words for several times. This will never happen with The Hat. Words from the basic sets suit only for the first play.

With civil war looming as a near inevitability, the challenge was to find a way forward after years of degenerating political discourse in the increasingly divided American electorate. In the end, after months of contentious campaigning between four (!) major parties and over a dozen smaller ones, the election was won by the Republican dark horse candidate, a little known Illinois politician named Abraham Lincoln who hadn't even been the first choice of his party's senior leadership.<br/><br/>Divided Republic is a card driven two to four player game representing the last calm before the storm that was to become the American Civil War. Players represent the four major parties (Constitutional Unionists, Northern Democrats, Republicans, and Southern Democrats) and attempt to win the presidency by defeating their opponents with dirty tricks, platform speeches, and the manipulation of key historical events. All the while, President Buchanan interferes, radicals riot, and the country continues the downward spiral toward civil war. If one party wins the election by achieving the necessary 152+ electoral votes, or wins in the case of an electoral tie thrown to the US Congress, history may well change. Nevertheless, there is always the chance that the population of South Carolina will finally explode into open rebellion and secede, ending the game, at which point everyone loses!<br/><br/>This is a light to medium weight game with intense player interaction, card-driven play, and a play time of about 2-3 hours depending upon how events proceed. There are even a few laughs along the way as the mudslinging between parties heats up. Literally anyone can win - it's not simply a cut and dry Republican victory. This is a different kind of US election game, a game where there are not two, but four parties, set in a period when candidates did not generally campaign for themselves, and run in an era when the Republicans were still liberals and the Democrats were the vanguard of traditional American conservatism.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": {"99399": "English first edition"}, "average": "6.73075", "name": "Divided Republic", "playingtime": "180", "boardgamemechanic": {"2080": "Area Control / Area Influence"}, "age": "16", "usersrated": "205", "boardgamesubdomain": {"5497": "Strategy Games"}, "boardgamefamily": {"8374": "Crowdfunding: Kickstarter"}}, "99079": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1129556.jpg", "is_expanded_by": {"143633": {"name": "Streets of Atlanta (fan expansion for The Walking Dead)"}}, "poll": {}, "boardgamedesigner": {"49005": {"name": "Cory Jones"}}, "statistics": {}, "yearpublished": "2011", "maxplayers": "4", "boardgamepublisher": {"12024": {"name": "Cryptozoic Entertainment"}}, "maxplaytime": "45", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1129556_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "45", "boardgamecategory": {"1024": {"name": "Horror"}}, "description": "Waking up in an empty hospital after weeks in a coma, sheriff's deputy Rick Grimes finds himself utterly alone.

On that planet were billions of people, some of whom were very clever and good, and some of whom were wicked and, sadly, also clever.<br/><br/>One day, in the age when the wicked people had declared a terrible war upon each other and threatened all the living things on the planet, the clever good people made something wonderful happen. They created a thinking machine that could see into the future. From the future this machine brought knowledge, and with that knowledge the good and clever people of the planet escaped the terrible things that the wicked people had done, and left them behind.<br/><br/>Far across the sky the machine spread them, into the depths of the clouded distances, star to cluster to galaxy and farther, to planets where people could live with ease. Each group of people that had left the tiny planet tried to build their lives as best they could, with the tiny amounts they had brought with them across the stars. Some were successful. Some were not.<br/><br/>The future-seeing machines had not come with the people. This was a time of silence, when each planet grew and prospered or failed alone. Many planets had clever people who discovered wonderful things, even how to travel across the stars as their ancestors had been flung, but none knew where the other people were. So many hundreds of seeds had been sown across the universe, and left to grow, and none saw where the others had landed.<br/><br/>Then, one day, not long ago, the future-seeing machines arrived. &quot;We are sorry that we have been gone so long,&quot; they said. &quot;It had to be done. But we have good news. We know where the other seeds have been sown and where they are growing well and prospering.&quot;<br/><br/>This was wonderful news for the people. Some of them had been apart so long that they had almost (almost) forgotten that they came, once upon a time, from the same tiny planet as everyone else. They had done so much and seen so much, and wanted to share. They could see the world where their ancestors were born, and see what strange plants and flowers had grown from the other seeds.<br/><br/>This is the time in which we live.<br/><br/>What's Missing?<br/><br/>As a quickstart version, this build of Sufficiently Advanced is missing quite a few items from the previous edition, as well as from the intended full second edition.

I didn't want to worry about low or high gravity, batteries, computer programs, cybernetics, bionics, star ship construction, and a whole host of other details that seem to be mandatory parts of sci-fi games.  Okay, so Star Frontiers should be right up my alley...but the flying monkeys, shmoos, insectoids, snake leach aliens felt...well lame.  They took the juice right out of the game like some aliens did in Star Trek<br/><br/>It seemed overwhelming in the sense that the details that go into making a dungeon are not possibly for a whole damn planet.  So you short change that and you are left with kind of lame half-assed game.  Plus the expectation (given our own instant on demand computer usage and knowledge) grows more exponential in the future.  If I can download blue prints of the Kremlin and know what the weather will be like from satellite images in Hong Kong...how much more should players know?  If satellites in space can read license plates now...why can't character 500 years from now do more?  How do you plan for all of that in your adventure over a planet...or solar system?<br/><br/>...with Rogue Space I am going to keep everything small, focus on exploration and discovering what is out there in the inky vast darkness.  Much like any fantasy RPG, Rogue Space assumes players are on the frontiers, their ship is their refuge, and danger is should be expected anytime they leave it.  I am not sure how...or if...I'll really answer any of my own concerns, but it will be a game I'd like to play and will fit my own ideas of what makes neat sci-fi from Space hulk, to Aliens, and hopefully beyond.<br/><br/>"}, "99204": {"rpg": {"1652": "Labyrinth Lord"}, "statistics": {}, "name": "Hill Cantons Compendium", "rpgproducer": {"26001": "Chris Kutalik"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic997747.jpg", "usersrated": "1", "rpgitemversion": {"99649": "PDF Version"}, "average": "8", "rpggenre": {"155": "Fantasy (High Fantasy)"}, "rpgcategory": {"2108": "Sourcebook (rules/options to enhance play)"}, "poll": {}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic997747_t.jpg", "description": "subtitle:<br/>Being a Collection of Player Options and House Rules Various and Sundry for Classic Fantasy Role-playing Games Old and Dear<br/><br/>excerpts from the designer's blog:<br/>...a small horde of house rules, player options, variant classes and other crunchy bits from the last two years of play in the Hill Cantons in two cities (and a few countries if you count in my co-conspirators Skype games from Dragonsfoot). ...

Motivations find their way into almost every aspect of a character&rsquo;s life and can occasionally be difficult to control.<br/><br/>In some ways, Character Motivations are similar to Character Traits. In fact, Traits and Motivations can be used in tandem to create well realized character backgrounds. One important distinction between Traits and Character Motivations, however, is that Character Motivations tend to be a much more integral part of the character than Traits normally are, and subsequently convey considerably larger benefits. Character Motivations can easily dominate most facets of a character&rsquo;s personality and typically require a heavier role-playing commitment from the player.<br/><br/>This PDF features 15 pairs of opposed Motivations, and full rules for their use in your Pathfinder campaigns.<br/><br/>"}, "99210": {"statistics": {}, "name": "La Abad\u00eda del Crimen", "videogamemode": {"2149": "Single-Player"}, "videogameversion": {"161737": "Spanish Amstrad CPC edition"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1005794.jpg", "videogametheme": {"2355": "Detective / Mystery"}, "usersrated": "3", "average": "7.33333", "videogamegenre": {"2152": "Adventure"}, "videogameplatform": {"5203": "Amstrad CPC"}, "poll": {}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1005794_t.jpg", "description": "This is a Spanish videogame based on Umberto Eco's &quot;The name of the rose&quot;.<br/><br/>From the game description:<br/><br/>A Franciscan monk, Guillermo de Occam, accused of heresy by the Inquisition, goes to an important Italian abbey to have an interview with the Pope's representative, Bernardo G&uuml;i, to try to solve their differences.<br/><br/>While staying in the abbey, Guillermo and his novice Adzo witness some strange events.

It was followed by Metal Combat: Falcon's Revenge during the following year.<br/><br/>In a distant future, Earth lives in chaos and the only order that rules resides in the Battle Game, where the winner takes control over the world. All battles are fought with mechs called Standing Tanks (ST). A merciless fighter called Anubis eventually becomes the champion of the Battle Game.<br/><br/>Mike Anderson, whose father was one of the many victims of Anubis, refuses to succumb, and trains himself in everything ST-related to stop the current chaos and avenge his father's death. To accomplish this, he must first defeat the Battle Chiefs (Anubis' subordinates).<br/><br/>In the game, the player is the gunner of the ST Falcon and also Mike's partner, who fights against a group of other STs in one-on-one battles. To attack, the player must shoot using the Super Scope. It is possible to shoot rapid shots by holding down the fire button, as well as energy bolts (charged shots). Energy bolts can be shot when an energy bar fills up (this happens when the player doesn't fire). When the energy bar has filled up, the energy bolt can be fired, though it will consume the energy bar. It is also important to defend against enemy attacks by shooting their fire. Some attacks can only be deflected by firing energy bolts.<br/><br/>The objective of the game is to defeat the rival ST to clear the stage. The damage inflicted on the enemy depends on the spot where the ST has been shot (all STs have some kind of weak point) and how powerful is the shot. The player wins if the rival ST's energy is depleted first. If the enemy depletes the player's energy or if the stage is played for ten minutes, then the game is over, but it is possible to continue the game indefinitely.<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;Battle Clash&quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "99269": {"statistics": {}, "name": "Zenonia 3: The Midgard Story", "videogamemode": {"2149": "Single-Player"}, "videogameversion": {"99885": "iPhone edition"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1076151.png", "videogameseries": {"7653": "Zenonia"}, "videogametheme": {"2148": "Fantasy"}, "usersrated": "1", "average": "6", "videogamegenre": {"2339": "Action RPG"}, "videogameplatform": {"6063": "Android"}, "poll": {}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1076151_t.png", "description": "The ZENONIA series gets revamped and up-scaled for an epic third generation, providing even greater enjoyment than the previous two ZENONIA's combined!<br/><br/>NEW FEATURES<br/><br/>VAST AND FASCINATING REALM OF MIDGARD<br/>227 unique maps of Migard and 136 quests of action-packed adventure.<br/><br/>FOUR DISTINCTIVE CLASSES<br/>Melee and range type classes to choose from; Sword Knight, Shadow Hunter, Mechanic Launcher and Nature Shaman.<br/><br/>ADDITIONAL NETWORK MODE<br/>Combat through the new Execution Room Mode dungeons in single or asynchronous co-op play.<br/><br/>COLLECT ACHIEVEMENTS &amp; TITLES<br/>Acquire and show off 48 Game Center achievements plus 47 in-game titles with special effects.<br/><br/>OUT WITH THE OLD, IN WITH THE NEW<br/>No more weight or hunger system.

This game was available for the Sega Genesis and the Super NES.<br/><br/>The levels each have a different theme. The themes include driving Barbie's convertible in Hollywood, roller skating in Hawaii, walking in the snow during a vacation in Vail, and riding her bike in New York City. The arcade-style sequences are interspersed with sections that test the player's memory. At the half-way point of each level the player can practice Barbie's moves for a fashion show. At the end of each level, the player must correctly perform these moves from memory.<br/><br/>By collecting certain objects, the player can unlock bonus rounds. The aim of these rounds is to dress Barbie and choose her makeup and earrings in order to match magazine covers.

It is a two-player (or multi-player) strategic / operational wargame of low-to-medium complexity.<br/><br/>Units in Proud Monster Deluxe are typically divisions with some corps, brigades and regiments also included. Hexes are 20 miles (about 33 kilometers) across, and each turn represents about a 2 week period.<br/><br/><br/>Game system<br/><br/>In addition to updated graphics, the major changes are Reserves and Reserve Movement phases to simulate the potential for encirclement or defensive reaction. Soviet first winter offensive rules allow the Soviets to retake parts of Russia in early 1942 as happened in history. Both sides now have offensive supply markers to show historical offensive potential and limitations. Innovative weather chits allow for weather variation without extreme weather swings biasing the game. AFV units become even more important due to AFV combat shift. Close Combat option allows for use of an alternate loss procedure and attacker advance to form a jointly-occupied hex, for example, to simulate Stalingrad's gradual fall to the Axis. The ability to fully exploit holes created by mobile assaults is limited to reserves.<br/><br/>The Axis forces degrade in capability over time while the Soviet forces upgrade in capability. The Axis super heavy artillery Thor and Odin, Heavy Gustav and Dora can fire before combat resolution. Besides the 1941 Free setups, 1941 historical setups are provided for both sides as well as a 1942 scenario. Seasonal offensive rules allow for special turns when special things can happen. The 2 sides show a greater disparity in capability, the Axis can do things the Soviets cannot do and vice versa. Things that work when playing the Axis may not work when playing the Soviets and vice versa.<br/><br/><br/>Game components<br/><br/>Game components have all been improved over the originals. All graphics have been completely updated and upgraded. Counters are 9/16&quot; and map hexes have ample space to avoid players from knocking over those stacks of counters when the fighting starts to tighten up. The four (4) maps impress upon the players the enormous expanse of the Soviet Union and the challenge for both sides to defend and overcome it. Rules are consolidated from the two original sources into one comprehensive set, with all known errata folded in, and a number of important rule changes to improve game balance and playability. In addition, the development of a definitive set of player aids will keep players playing the game instead of hunting down items in the rules.<br/><br/>4 maps - each map is 22&quot;x34&quot; with overlap<br/>    10 full sheets of 9/16&quot; counters (2052 counters), printed both sides<br/>    1 rules book<br/>    Full color player aid charts and tables cards printed both sides on cardstock<br/>    2 6 sided dice<br/>    1 full color box and lid<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": {"100018": "First edition"}, "name": "Proud Monster Deluxe", "playingtime": "1500", "boardgamemechanic": {"2072": "Dice Rolling"}, "age": "0", "usersrated": "59", "boardgamesubdomain": {"4664": "Wargames"}, "average": "7.9339"}, "99315": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic997569.png", "poll": {}, "boardgamedesigner": {"9714": {"name": "Antoine Bauza"}}, "statistics": {}, "yearpublished": "2011", "maxplayers": "7", "boardgameartist": {"12016": "Miguel Coimbra"}, "boardgamepublisher": {"4384": {"name": "Repos Production"}}, "maxplaytime": "40", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic997569_t.png", "minplaytime": "40", "boardgamecategory": {"1050": {"name": "Ancient"}}, "description": "From Spielbox Magazine 2011 Issue #3:<br/><br/>Stevie Wonder is an additional leader for the 7 Wonders expansion LEADERS.<br/>With his help, you can build a stage of your Wonder of the World; instead of paying the required number of resources, you pay the corresponding number of coins and slide Stevie under the appropriate stage face up.<br/><br/>The Card is only playable with 7 Wonders: Leaders Expansion for 7 Wonders<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": {"108535": "English Spielbox edition"}, "average": "6.94821", "name": "7 Wonders: Leaders \u2013 Stevie", "playingtime": "40", "boardgamemechanic": {"2041": "Card Drafting"}, "age": "10", "boardgameexpansion": {}, "usersrated": "862", "boardgamesubdomain": {"5499": "Family Games"}, "expands": {"92539": {"name": "7 Wonders: Leaders"}}, "boardgamefamily": {"17552": "7 Wonders"}}, "99316": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3518084.jpg", "poll": {}, "boardgamedesigner": {"2": {"name": "Reiner Knizia"}}, "statistics": {}, "yearpublished": "2010", "maxplayers": "6", "boardgameartist": {"43873": "Anne P\u00e4tzke"}, "boardgamepublisher": {"39": {"name": "Pegasus Spiele"}}, "maxplaytime": "20", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3518084_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "10", "boardgamecategory": {"1089": {"name": "Animals"}}, "boardgamehonor": {"12739": "2011 Kinderspielexperten \"5-to-9-year-olds\" Nominee"}, "description": "In Grimaffen, players must remember the order of animal movements or sounds and imitate them in the right order to win.

The only requirement for placement is that it is not adjacent to a piece of another color, although you can play adjacent to your own color. After placing a piece, it can not be moved in any way. When a player is blocked and can not place any more pieces, they are out. The game continues until no more pieces can be played by ANY player. <br/>When a game is complete, points are then awarded. Each player gets one point for each piece not played by a player who went out before them. Thus, 3rd place gets the points for all pieces left by 4th place, while 2nd place gets points for both 3rd and 4th place's pieces. The winner gains points from all 3 who fell by the wayside.<br/>(Adjustment: If you allow ties in how many pieces are left over instead of &quot;first unable not play is first out&quot;, then both people who tie gain the points of the other person they tied with.)<br/>The best thing is to play four games, so that each player has the chance to play first. <br/>The winner is the one with the highest cumulative score after four games. <br/>When only two people play, it requires each player to use two colors, and each player must take into account that the two colors belonging to a player can not touch each other.<br/><br/><br/>El Congo es un juego creado por el frances Charles Watilliaux entre 1874 y 1907, este juego hubiese caido en el olvido a no ser por otro frances llamado Michel Boutin que luego de una investigacion publico este juego en su libro: &quot;Jeux de pions pour aujourd&acute;hui&quot; en 2001 y retomado por Oriol Comas en su libro &quot;El Mundo en juegos&quot;<br/>El Congo es un juego de estrategia abstracta muy simple pero con un tablero y una mecanica muy bella.

Hence, they named their first colony there Murmansk. The end of the Earth.<br/><br/>To the Allied sailors of many nations who sailed there during WW2 it certainly seemed to live up to its name. Getting there was bad enough with all the hardships of freezing cold conditions, massive storms, and seas that could swallow up a ship leaving little trace. If forced to abandon ship in such waters they were under no illusions that they chances of survival were slim. There were some remarkable stories of survival but the privations endured by those who made it back alive were just as remarkable in that there were so few who lived to tell the tale of being sunk on the Murmansk run.<br/><br/>Of course, although the port facilities available were Spartan and poorly equipped to handle the huge amount of stores delivered, then there was the problem of getting such cargoes there in the first place.<br/><br/>Having arrived, there were almost no amenities for the crews of ships to use in order to rest up after fighting there way to Murmansk. Indeed the Soviets were reluctant to give the crews much freedom to go ashore at all. Food was scarce. That supplied was grudgingly given, boring and lacking nutrition. So for those who had arrived, the long wait until they could join a convoy back to the UK was like a prison sentence. Perhaps the only thing the Russians seemed to have plenty of was Vodka and with that they could be extremely generous.<br/><br/>Join the thriving community around this intensely popular war game.<br/><br/>Game sclae is of 20cm or 8 inches per nautical mile, so  1cm equals 1 knot.

All this will change according to the year and nationality played, so for 1942 the forces will be different from those of 1945 and also those avaliable to the Royal Navy or the Soviets.<br/>The game has also an event generator to add some flavor, and full tables to calculate combat and the damage and critical hits taken by the diverse forces.<br/><br/>"}, "99378": {"poll": {}, "name": "Mr. Turnip's Audition", "playingtime": "45", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": {"2004": "Set Collection"}, "yearpublished": "1954", "usersrated": "1", "maxplayers": "6", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1001199_t.jpg", "average": "4", "statistics": {}, "boardgamepublisher": {"362": {"name": "Ariel"}}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1001199.jpg", "boardgameversion": {"100112": "Ariel First Edition"}, "maxplaytime": "45", "boardgamecategory": {"1002": {"name": "Card Game"}}, "age": "6", "minplaytime": "45", "description": "This may be the first British game linked to a TV character.

It takes you into an arena, where champions from faraway lands come to compete and remain the last man standing. By mastering the balance between courage and endurance, you may reap the glory of the INVINCIBLE.<br/><br/>Players chose their champion from among 3 different tribes, each fielding a variety of 6 *(7) different classes. 18 *(21) unique characters with 2 special abilities each, 3 playing modes for 2-6 *(7) players promises great replay-ability. When designing the rules, our goal was to make them as easy to pick up as checkers, and as tactically deep as chess. From our experience, it is best learned &quot;on the go&quot;, and even first-timers DO win!<br/><br/>Players have 3 types of card at their disposal. &quot;Action&quot; card with reddish background, &quot;Equipment&quot; cards with yellow background, and &quot;Special&quot; cards with green background. The action cards work on a bit more complex &quot;rock-paper-scissors&quot; mechanics, and players need to decide which attacks to commence, in order to get their opponent in the spot they want them. Players pick 3 cards from the deck every time it's their turn in the round, or when they are challenged to a duel. At the end of their turn in the round, they may chose to discard one card for their convenience, yet this could also work against them, since the less cards you have on your hand, the more mouth-watering victim you make yourself. Duel is a battle mechanism, where two players engage into an exchange of action cards, where both of them are allowed to use two action cards for an attack, single special card of every kind, use as many equipment cards as they posses, and utilize their special abilities based on the amount of courage they gained in the season. (One whole game of INVINCIBLE represents a season in the arena). Each player's champion has different starting endurance, courage and  card stock based on their tribe of origin. Endurance and courage are two main resources used in the game. Endurance determines how much damage can the player take, and if it drops to zero, the player is eliminated from the competition. However, they are not eliminated from the game. Players who's endurance drops to zero, come back to game in the next turn as &quot;ghost&quot; players. Losing all their equipment and courage, starting with a single point of endurance. Players who are still competing for the title of INVINCIBLE, can no longer duel the ghost players, but this does not work the other way around, and so they may take revenge on their executioners or simply have fun playing with other player's chances in the game. Courage is gained with every successful hit. This means every time you play an attack card, and you duelist does not play a valid defense card against it, that player loses a point of endurance, and you gain a point of courage. Each character has two special abilities, which spent the courage when used. First ability costs 4 courage points, and the other spends 6 points being twice as powerful. Players need to chose whether they spend their courage early, or save up for more powerful abilities and risk that they get eliminated in the process, or somebody uses a card or ability that would steal their courage. The closer to the epic final duel the game gets, the more courage players gain, as every time you eliminate a player, you gain 6 points of courage, and also, there are more equipment cards available for less competing players. Equipment cards improve endurance and courage capacities, and special cads have many uses to disabling your opponents and &quot;resource redistribution&quot;.<br/><br/><br/>    (x) marked values refer to Collector's and Signature editions.<br/><br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": {"100240": "Ritter Realities Collector's edition"}, "age": "13", "name": "The Lunar Chapters: INVINCIBLE", "playingtime": "40", "boardgamemechanic": {"2001": "Action Point Allowance System"}, "average": "0", "usersrated": "0", "boardgamefamily": {"8374": "Crowdfunding: Kickstarter"}}, "99436": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1668695.jpg", "poll": {}, "boardgamedesigner": {"141": {"name": "Friedemann Friese"}}, "statistics": {}, "yearpublished": "1993", "maxplayers": "6", "boardgameartist": {"249": "Wolfgang Panning"}, "boardgamepublisher": {"58": {"name": "2F-Spiele"}}, "maxplaytime": "0", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1668695_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "0", "boardgamecategory": {"1002": {"name": "Card Game"}}, "description": "Wuchererer is a 36-card expansion for Landlord! that includes a variety of new tenants, new actions, card-driven scoring, and variant rules.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": {"100243": "First edition"}, "name": "Wuchererer", "playingtime": "0", "boardgamemechanic": {"2040": "Hand Management"}, "age": "0", "boardgameexpansion": {}, "usersrated": "7", "expands": {"312": {"name": "Landlord!"}}, "average": "7"}, "99437": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3120549.png", "boardgameimplementation": {"203104": "Cthulhu in the House"}, "is_expanded_by": {"217407": {"name": "Rumble in the House/Dungeon: Dice Tower 2014 promo"}}, "poll": {}, "boardgamedesigner": {"49314": {"name": "Ken Rush"}}, "statistics": {}, "yearpublished": "2011", "maxplayers": "6", "boardgameartist": {"28024": "Kwanchai Moriya"}, "boardgamepublisher": {"157": {"name": "Asmodee"}}, "boardgameintegration": {"203104": "Cthulhu in the House"}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3120549_t.png", "minplaytime": "20", "boardgamecategory": {"1023": {"name": "Bluffing"}}, "description": "Living together in a small house is difficult, and sometimes trouble arises.

Well, it's not much of a fight really, as the player removes one character from the room and places it in a line with other removed characters. Once a single character remains, the round ends. The first two characters removed are worth zero points, while the third through eleventh characters are worth 1-9 points; the character that remains in the house is worth ten points.

Each player shares responsibility for ensuring that the ship makes it safely back to Earth, but at the same time should try to collect as much information about the solar system to win the game when the ship makes it back to Earth.<br/>The game has two separate game boards. The first board represents the solar system, on which the players' spaceship pawn is moved. If the ship flies off the grid, hits a planet or the sun, the ship is destroyed and all players lose the game. The board also includes Event-markers, which are turned over when the ship flies on them, and have a surprising impact on game play.<br/>The other board represents the inside of the spaceship, where players move their astronaut pawns. Each turn, a player must move from one module of the spaceship to another and carry out an action. The actions that can be carried out in the different modules are:<br/>-Bridge: turn the ship's inclination (to determine which direction the ship moves in)<br/>-Observatory: draw two Data cards (giving points at the end of the game)<br/>-Storage: draw two Equipment cards (useful items to be used during the game to save the ship from destruction or help the player's own game<br/>-Engine room: move the ship pawn forward one step.<br/><br/>The game has three levels of game play with increasing complexity. On level two, Captain's Orders cards are added to the game, which are played whenever a player moves to the Bridge, giving that player an additional action. Also, the scoring system for Data cards becomes based on set collection. On level three, Escape pods are included, which allow a player to win the game even if the ship is destroyed.<br/><br/>This game was custom designed to order, and is intended mainly for a specific target market, i.e. children aged 8-14. It is an educational game at heart, in which the players learn about the solar system, and the importance of working together for a common goal, while having lots of fun. But naturally anybody can play it, and it works specially well as a game that the whole family can enjoy together<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": {"100269": "First edition"}, "age": "8", "name": "Kosminen kierros", "playingtime": "30", "boardgamemechanic": {"2023": "Co-operative Play"}, "average": "5.16667", "usersrated": "9", "boardgamefamily": {"10316": "Country: Finland"}}, "99440": {"poll": {}, "name": "Math Animals", "playingtime": "0", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": {"2072": "Dice Rolling"}, "yearpublished": "2006", "usersrated": "0", "maxplayers": "4", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1004046_t.jpg", "average": "0", "statistics": {}, "boardgamepublisher": {"686": {"name": "Aristoplay"}}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1004046.jpg", "boardgameversion": {"100272": "Aristoplay Edition 2006"}, "maxplaytime": "0", "boardgamecategory": {"1089": {"name": "Animals"}}, "age": "5", "minplaytime": "0", "description": "MathAnimals is an exciting new game that teaches and reinforces addition, subtraction or multiplication skills for children for all ages.

Their aim in the short-run is to fulfill advertising contracts to get money and in the long-run to gain viewers from those groups which eventually will give them victory.<br/><br/>The action phase is played by using employees cards in order to perform common or special (more efficient) actions. Each employee card represents either a unique special action or a boost of a common action. Each employee, after he/she has been played is discarded. So players must constantly plan their hand keeping in mind the hand limit and the emploeyees available in market.<br/><br/>Players must manage their daily schedule by purchasing Films and placing them face down next to current day's viewers. Each film has a quality and a duration which constraints the available slots (for example, movies take 3 zones, so a player cannot place a movie in zone 1 and then place another film in zone 2). Also, some employees can boost this quality during the broadcasting phase, producing unexpected results! Films can also be used as advertisments of the channel. They can be discarded in order to grant 1 quality in a matching viewer of the next day's program. Finally, films, according to their type, may give players important end game bonuses (for example, fulfilling an action series 3 times, thus completing a season, will grant 10 working class viewers at the end of the game).<br/><br/>At the beginning players do not have any money. They will go in red as they will buy films and workers but soon they will need to fulfill advertising contracts in order to get money (or play some shows) and become profitable. At the end money will be added (or subtracted) to the final score. Advertising contracts can give a lot of money if they are fulfilled before expiration (some employees can extend those contracts).<br/><br/>Finally, players have the ability to create their own custom films and then use them for their program or sell them for good money.

You stop in your tracks - the huts have been burnt, some to the ground. You ask him for an explanation. &quot;It is a terrible thing&quot;, he answers, &quot;Every night, Birdmen fly from the hills to the north and wreak this damage. Even worse, they try to take one of our men away with them. We have lost two good men. I don't know if we will ever see them again.&quot;<br/><br/>Vine, the leader of the Hill Men, appears from down the street, having heard the conversation. &quot;I am afraid it is worse than that. I have taken a band of men to explore the region to the north, and we heard rumours that an alchemist named Grilak has taken up residence in a fortress up there and is carrying out experiments to create the perfect warrior! He seems to be breeding all sorts of different creatures together; when he manages his task, I am sure that he will not rest until he has conquered all of this area, possibly beyond!&quot;<br/><br/>You agree that the alchemist must be stopped, and volunteer yourself for the task. Vine thanks you profusely, but when you ask about the men that have been taken, he shakes his head sadly. &quot;I think it is already too late for them. They will have been used in one of Grilak's experiments by now. Avenge them, though, and you will have the gratitude of the village.&quot;<br/><br/>You spend the rest of the day in the village, learning all you can about the journey ahead. Grilak's fortress is about a day's travel away, in the hills to the north. The Hill Men warn you that Goblin bandits regularly harass travellers on the road; even worse, Shapechangers have started appearing - you should not trust anyone you meet.<br/><br/>There may be a secret entrance to the fortress, actually an exit in case the fortress should be besieged, which you might be able to find. Within Grilak's fortress, you can expect to confront all manner of creatures - half breeds, most likely, from Grilak's breeding experiments. There should be some riches in the fortress, as Grilak's brother also lives there, who made a lot of money as a merchant before retiring to the castle.<br/><br/>When you have learnt all you can, Vine offers you a place to sleep; it is probably better to start the quest in the morning when you are refreshed.

When you read it your eyes go wide, they're shadowed with fear and concern.<br/><br/>&quot;Dear Father,<br/><br/>If you're reading this then I have been killed.<br/><br/>Know that I have perished fighting the Blackthorne Ogre.<br/><br/>Why would I risk my life? I've fallen for a girl and will kill the beast for her sake. I won't say who she is because I won't have the village to blame her for my death. Needless to say she is the most perfect woman I've ever known.<br/><br/>I would suggest that you contact Mistress Haziea and bargain with her for the village's safety. Her price will be high but she's the only one who can shield our people from the Ogre's wrath.<br/><br/>Your foolish Son,<br/><br/>Sebastian.&quot;<br/><br/>You crumple the letter and grit your teeth. Your long red locks fall across your face hiding your eyes. Now you know what happened to Eros' Tears. Sebastian the handsome, polite son of the mayor. A kind soul but a master swordsman. The perfect man. Some tart from the village managed to steal the love potion and drug your friend. Now, enslaved forever to this brainless twit he's risking his dear life on her mere pleasure.<br/><br/>Your magic burns the missive to ash.<br/><br/>&quot;Hey! Those are my brother's last words!&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Not yet.&quot; Your tone is coloured with murder. &quot;First I will kill the Ogre. Then I will turn whoever poisoned Sebastian into living dung and have maggots devour her. This will not stand.&quot;<br/><br/>With that you storm up the stairs. Haziea's powers might not be enough to defeat him let alone your own. Still, you must face the Blackthorne Ogre. Thanks to Eros Tear's you'll never be able to tell Sebastian how you truly feel but at least you can attempt to save his life.<br/><br/>"}, "99454": {"rpg": {"413": "Fighting Fantasy Gamebooks"}, "poll": {}, "name": "Call of the Sirens", "rpgproducer": {"3": "(Uncredited)"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1006100.png", "usersrated": "0", "rpgitemversion": {"100297": "PDF Version"}, "average": "0", "statistics": {}, "rpggenre": {"180": "Action / Adventure (Swashbuckling / Pirates)"}, "rpgcategory": {"2136": "Solitaire Adventure"}, "rpgseries": {"10604": "Fighting Fantasy Amateur Adventures"}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1006100_t.png", "description": "From the Background:<br/><br/>The smell of sea salt and sweat is heavy in the dank under-decks as you sit awake, uneasy.

You manage a smile as you picture the warm turkey waiting for you at your cousin's house in Mingleford. It will be a very merry holiday season indeed if you can just navigate this labyrinth of paddocks and unused dirt tracks.<br/><br/>Your forehead creases as you consider again the given to you by the traveller you met along the highway. Dressed in a Santa suit with scraggly white hair, he'd certainly looked the part even if the sherry on his breath undermined his reliability. But his knowledge of the local area had seemed sound enough, hadn't it? Surely no decent human being could have any malicious intent on Christmas Eve!<br/><br/>Bells on bobtails ring, making spirits bright, oh... fun it... laying son... ells... the radio begins to flicker.

The volume of the increasingly scrambled carol begins to rise frighteningly. You bend down to examine the dials, frantically pushing buttons to try and end the ghastly noise. As the screeching reaches an unbearable level you straighten up for a quick glimpse of the road - and then the car plunges into the white stomach of the enormous snowman that has been built in the centre of your path.<br/><br/>For a moment all is silent beneath the night sky. Then you throw open the door with a groan and scramble out of the car and out into the roadside ditch, panting heavily as the shock continues to pulse throughout your body. The light glowing from the car windows reveals the face of your icy tormentor; sticks and rocks have been used to create a wide, nasty smile that laughs down at you. You curse and walk back towards the car, sticking your arm through the open door and twisting the key. The engine makes no sound. Above your head the car light flickers and dies, leaving you with nothing but the light of the moon and stars.<br/><br/>Fear finally begins to seep into your consciousness; tonight's consistently unlucky events have left you lost, stranded and chilled to the bone. As you try to piece together a plan of action your eyes focus on an orange glow in the distance. Your heart leaps - a fire! Someone is camping just a short distance away from where you are stranded. You quickly begin to jog towards the light, forcing your body to warm itself against the cold. The closer you get, the more lights you can see - and some of them are high above the ground.

Yet, the curious man in the suit was adamant. Three days. He said. You were to meet him in the offices of Serakub Ltd law firm in the Titan building uptown.<br/><br/>Arriving at the address, you still thought it a joke: The building was still under construction. Yet a hand painted sign got the better of you and directed you to the 33rd floor via the newly installed service elevator.<br/><br/>Upon the elevator doors opening you were struck with amazement when you were greeted by an opulent waiting room with large comfortable chairs, a well-tended indoor garden complete with a fountain and classical music playing in the background. You sit down in one of the chairs, the soft leather making you relax instantly. You think about all the people in your life that would...?<br/><br/>Your reverie is interrupted by the strange man you met the other day. Still wearing the same suit, he carries a briefcase and &ndash; if you didn't know any better &ndash; you'd say he had a metallic sheen to his skin.<br/><br/>The Lawyer ushers you into a large meeting room and closes the door behind you. He bids you to sit down at the oval mahogany table and goes to a stand by the window and pours you a glass of water. As you move to sit, you notice a tape recorder and a brass key on a metal chain arranged in front of you on the table.<br/><br/>Bringing over the glass, the Lawyer asks you to press play on the tape recorder. The recorded voice is muffled and indistinct. It sounds like the person is reading from a letter.<br/><br/>To Whom It May Concern:<br/><br/>It is almost twenty years since I returned to this city, bearing what now I call the 'Burden of My Life.' This burden lies hidden, in a Safety Deposit Box of the First National Bank downtown. The key that accompanies this recording will open the box. On no account must you-<br/><br/>I am sorry. I am getting ahead of myself. Where do I start? Twenty years ago I disappeared from the face of the Earth and returned here bearing an artifact of terrible power.<br/><br/>People want it. Powerful People. They will stop at nothing to get their hands upon it. If they get what they desire, they will unleash a terrible destruction upon the universe; it has the power to summon Death and those who worship the darkness will sit at his right hand and rule with him.<br/><br/>This artifact is the Talisman of Death.<br/><br/>I have returned many times to the standing stones outside of the city limits, beseeching the beings of Light that helped me recover the Talisman for more aid. They sent another of their kind - Suma - to find another Champion of Fate to bear the Talisman beyond the Claw of the Fleshless King. If you are listening to this missive now, I can only assume that Suma has done his work.<br/><br/>I must go. I need to draw them away from the Talisman. Go as soon as you are able and retrieve the Talisman from its hiding place. The Fleshless King is clawing his way across the dimensions and... wait... &amp;lt;sounds of a chair moving&amp;gt; ... &amp;lt;sharp metallic scraping sound&amp;gt;... &amp;lt;heavy breathing&amp;gt;... &amp;lt;muffled noises&amp;gt;... &amp;lt;static&amp;gt;<br/><br/>You press stop.<br/><br/>Looking up, you can see the Lawyer; his face is silhouetted by the afternoon sun coming in through the window, illuminating him in a golden aura. Shielding your eyes from the glare, you struggle to make out his features. 'How... .?' You begin.<br/><br/>His voice seems to come from all around you, rich and sonorous.<br/><br/>&quot;My time here has ended. Go now, Champion of Fate. Recover the Talisman and leave the city. Beware the Agents of the Fleshless King; they wear many faces.&quot;<br/><br/>The glare increases until you are forced to avert you gaze completely. At once, the blinding light is gone. And you are left sitting alone. Looking around, you see a dusty storage area, cardboard boxes line the walls. There is no sign of the offices of Serakub Ltd. Was it all a trick of your mind?<br/><br/>Moving back towards the elevator, you kick an object in the sawdust and it skitters across the wooden floor. Bending down, you pick up a small brass key attached to a chain.

Both the Declarer and the Defender can win these points. If the Declarer wins at least the number of tricks called for, they win a bonus of 10 points.

Furthermore, the player can then return to previous levels and utilise these items to gain access to previously unaccessable areas.<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;Land of Illusion starring Mickey Mouse&quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "99492": {"boardgamedesigner": {"3": {"name": "(Uncredited)"}}, "poll": {}, "name": "Batteries", "playingtime": "30", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": {"2080": "Area Control / Area Influence"}, "yearpublished": "1971", "usersrated": "1", "maxplayers": "4", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1087691_t.png", "average": "6.5", "statistics": {}, "boardgamepublisher": {"4": {"name": "(Self-Published)"}}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1087691.png", "boardgameversion": {"100393": "First edition"}, "maxplaytime": "30", "boardgamecategory": {"1009": {"name": "Abstract Strategy"}}, "age": "8", "minplaytime": "30", "description": "&quot;A game which uses ordinary playing cards in a new and fascinating way&quot; Box blurb <br/>Cards are played 1 at a time to activate pieces on the board.

There are rules for artillery and infantry as well. Infantry may be used as artillery spotters, or to attack other infantry or armor.

Why you have to go out at this time of night, you don't know? Your boss rang you twenty minutes ago to take some papers to Blackwood Manor for Mr Smith to sign, so a sale can go through quickly.<br/><br/>You drive through the rusty iron gates and drive up the gravel driveway. A dark foreboding wood closes in on you from both sides until you arrive at the house.<br/><br/>Blackwood Manor towers over you like a malicious giant creature staring at its prey. You get out of the car, run through the rain and reach the front door stepping in every puddle all the way.<br/><br/>You knock on the door and wait in the darkness shivering. The door snaps and clicks as locks open to reveal an ancient face. The old man is withered and cracked from years of experience. He is slightly stooped forward and leans on a wooden walking stick. He wears a brown dressing gown and blue slippers. 'Can I help you?' he asks.<br/><br/>You tell him who you are and he lets you in. Entering the foyer he leads you to the entrance hall decorated with a black and white chequered floor, red walls and ominous-looking portraits. You turn left into the study. All the other doors are closed.<br/><br/>The study is dark and lit only by a few candles and a crackling fire in the fireplace. An ornate clock echoes its ticks throughout the room and sits atop the mantel. Red drapes cover the windows and an oriental rug fills most of the floor. An oak desk sits in the far corner and two armchairs face the warmth of the fire where you both sit down.<br/><br/>You take out the papers from your briefcase and hand them to the old man. He ignores them and stokes the fire with a nearby poker. 'This night reminds of an age past. A time I can never forget. If I had known what was to befall me that night, then I wouldn't have ventured here.' he says as he stares distantly into the dancing flames.<br/><br/>'Although the day itself was quite eventful, it started when my car broke down just outside a small village quite near here.' He stares at you and gives you a sickly grin. As you look into his eyes you see something familiar about them. Have you already met? No, you would have remembered.<br/><br/>Strangely you start to feel drowsy.

Locals are friendly enough to strangers, helpful in giving directions, certainly eager for news from outside their secluded county. You head back to the bar for half a Hewit Risk Ale to wash down your ploughman's lunch. A tall, swarthy man leans on the bar, who turns at your approach. He fixes you with piercing blue eyes.<br/><br/>&quot;Ah, a stranger to these parts, I see!&quot; he says, voice deep but not menacing. A toothy grin parts his bearded face, his hand clasps your own firmly. &quot;Pleased to meet you. I'm Terry, by the way. So, are you a tourist or here on business?&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Just passing through - stopped for a quick bite before meeting friends further on.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Hmm, watch those country roads, mate, they're narrow with hairpin bends - some motorists, mad as March hares!&quot;<br/><br/>You nod, but grin, &quot;Well, let's hope I don't meet a nasty end, then. I've only ten miles to go, Terry.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Right,&quot; his brow wrinkles in thought. &quot;Ten miles, eh? There's not much to see around these parts, Tapston is a fair place but stuck in the middle of no-where...ah!&quot; he clicks his fingers: &quot;Your friends are farmers, I'd wager!&quot;<br/><br/>You smile at his attempts to guess your destination - a little game you're both enjoying - but it almost seems he was hoping the answer to be correct. His face drops at your response. &quot;It's no good, Terry, I'll have to put you out of your misery. I'm meeting them at some ruined old house that burned down...&quot;<br/><br/>A sudden hush descends over the entire pub. Slowly, you regard the other patrons - they return your puzzled look with frightened eyes. You turn back to Terry who's still gobsmacked.<br/><br/>&quot;Tell me you're joking,&quot; he finally stammers, &quot;please.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;What are you talking about?&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;The-the Earl of Drumer's place,&quot; he gasps, &quot;you must have heard the stories. Yes, that must be it! You're having a joke with all of us,&quot; he laughs nervously, slaps the bar with sheer delight, &quot;go on, own up to it!&quot;<br/><br/>Your face remains puzzled, no hint of a mischievous grin emerges. Terry's face falls into one of despair. &quot;Look, look,&quot; his hand grips your shoulder, almost crushing it, &quot;you don't know me, I don't know you, but listen, listen,&quot; he grits his teeth to emphasise the point: &quot;Don't go there! Please, you mustn't. That place is cursed, I tell you, cursed! For years people have been going missing.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;But I have important business there, Terry...&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;It doesn't matter! Do you understand? Your meeting, call it off. Whatever your business, avoid that place. Oh, why did you have to choose that accursed house for a meeting spot? Of all the places! Look, my friend, just call it off!&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;You can't be serious?&quot; you laugh perplexedly, look to the surrounding faces again, but find no salvation save dread and concern - for you. &quot;I don't believe this. You're all basing your fears on fireside ghost stories. Call it off? Even if I wanted to, how? I can't! They're waiting for me as we speak. I'm late as it is...&quot;<br/><br/>Terry is horror-stricken. &quot;Your friends are already there?&quot; he sighs, closes his eyes, looks skyward as if seeking divination.<br/><br/>You feel like doing the same but for different reasons. &quot;Alright, look, enough of this charade! It's quite obvious you're all mad...&quot; you fumble for your wallet, pull out a tenner, offer it to the landlord, &quot;...so I'd like to pay my bill, thank you.&quot;<br/><br/>But the landlord simply shakes his head. He leans on the bar and regards you with sad eyes. &quot;It's on the house, sir. Good journey.&quot; With that, he crosses himself before placing empties into the washer.<br/><br/>Astonishing! At once, you feel humbled by such generosity, but anxious to leave the Goat and Knife - yes, a blade would come in handy to cut through the atmosphere!<br/><br/>As you pass, Terry avows, &quot;I'll pray for you.&quot;<br/><br/>You pause outside, expecting to hear the sudden whoop of laughter - none comes, but:<br/><br/>&quot;Say, Sid, you should have taken his money.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;No, it's not right to charge a man for what could well be his last meal.&quot;<br/><br/>"}, "99500": {"rpgitemversion": {"100409": "A Marked Man"}, "poll": {}, "name": "A Marked Man", "rpgproducer": {"3": "(Uncredited)"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1008775.jpg", "usersrated": "0", "rpgsetting": {"240": "Greyhawk"}, "average": "0", "rpggenre": {"155": "Fantasy (High Fantasy)"}, "statistics": {}, "rpg": {"243": "Dungeons & Dragons (3.5 Edition)"}, "rpgcategory": {"2084": "Scenario / Adventure / Module"}, "rpgseries": {"1981": "COR - Living Greyhawk Core Adventures"}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1008775_t.jpg", "description": "Adventure description from front page:<br/>Sometimes you make the wrong enemy, and you don't know where to turn.
