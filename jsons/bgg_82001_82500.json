Once the key for the stage is obtained the player must travel through the stage in search of the exit.

Epic Mickey is part of an effort by The Walt Disney Company to re-brand the Mickey Mouse character by moving away from his current squeaky clean image and reintroducing the mischievous side of his personality. Spector has been collaborating with Walt Disney Feature Animation and Pixar in conjunction with the project. The November edition of Game Informer confirmed Epic Mickey's existence. The game was officially announced on October 28, 2009 in London.<br/><br/>A long time ago, Walt Disney, represented in the game by the sorcerer Yen Sid, created a pen-and-paper world (based on his &quot;Disneyland&quot; theme parks) for his forgotten and rejected creations (mentioned as &quot;a world for things that have been forgotten&quot;). This world appeared as an intricate model on a table in Yen Sid's study, which is accessible through a mirror. Mickey, who finds himself inside Yen Sid's study by entering a mirror in his house, sees the model, and waits until Yen Sid is gone before going back to take another look at it. Fiddling with it, Mickey tries to create a model of himself but instead creates the Phantom Blot. Panicking, Mickey quickly erases it by throwing paint thinner onto it and soaking it up with a sponge, accidentally spilling paint onto the model in the process. Hearing Yen Sid approaching, Mickey quickly tries to clean up with the sponge (again accidentally spilling the thinner onto the model in the process) and flees back to his home. However, it's too late-the world Yen Sid created is ravaged; a wasteland. The Phantom Blot (with the thinner at his disposal) takes control of the ruined lands from its first resident-and Mickey's older half-brother-Oswald the Lucky Rabbit. Oswald and the other residents of the Wasteland fight against the Phantom Blot, but he eventually overwhelms them and twists their world into a dark and sinister version of itself, forcing Oswald into hiding.<br/><br/>Years later, Mickey has forgotten his past transgression until the Phantom Blot enters his home through the mirror and pulls him into the Cartoon Wasteland. Oswald, his will lost from years of hiding and his mind twisted by his jealousy of Mickey's rise to fame, has formulated a plan to destroy Mickey. In addition, The Mad Doctor works closely with the Blot, creating &quot;Beetleworx&quot;-robotic creatures made from parts of various Disney cartoon characters (for example, the Beetleworx Cannon robots have the head of Hades). He also creates animatronic &quot;buddies&quot; for Oswald, looking like decrepit robotic versions of Mickey's friends, as Oswald wants Mickey's life and popularity for himself. Armed with a magical paintbrush that he managed to pull into the world with him, Mickey must stop the Phantom Blot, gain Oswald's trust and save the Wasteland.<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;Epic Mickey&quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "82046": {"statistics": {}, "name": "Bandai Golf: Challenge Pebble Beach", "videogamemode": {"2149": "Single-Player"}, "videogameversion": {"63384": "US NES edition"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1062941.jpg", "videogametheme": {"2366": "Sports - Golf"}, "usersrated": "0", "average": "0", "videogamegenre": {"2157": "Sports"}, "videogameplatform": {"4430": "NES"}, "poll": {}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1062941_t.jpg", "description": "Bandai Golf Challenge Pebble Beach was a golf video game, released for the Nintendo Entertainment System.

The objective of the game is to build, sustain, and command an army of troops to defeat Gao's army before January 1127. Players hold certain attributes such as strength, dexterity, and wisdom. Players must also deal with other situations such as taxes, care for the troops, maintenance and replacement of weapons and equipment, forces of nature, and troop unrest and desertion.<br/><br/>Battlefields take place on hexagonal grids, where players move their armies across various terrain in order to strategically engage and defeat the enemy army. Troops have the capability of fighting with either melee weapons, bows and arrows, magic, or dueling swords. When a player defeats an enemy army, they have the option of recruiting, imprisoning, exiling, or executing the captured enemy troops.

The computer's control of Gilligan is often a source of frustration.

However, the player's life bar is considered to be large and the time limit can be forgiving to the expert player (it gets reduced to two minutes if Gilligan goes missing however). The Skipper can attack most of the game's enemies with a punch; bringing a somewhat violent element to a game based on a completely non-violent television program.

It was officially released on 28 May that same year. Features include: a further extension of the game's time frame, the addition of the Byzantine Empire, a revised AI which focuses on strategic toplevel goals, and completely reworked rebellions with their own goals and abilities. Virtual Programming published the In Nomine expansion for Mac OS X on 18 August 2008.  The game now starts earlier, starting in October 1399, at the coronation  of Henry IV of England. Expanding the game time by 50 years, this means the game includes the Byzantine Empire, Tamerlane and the end of the Hundred Years' War.<br/><br/>A key variation of the expansion is the ability to make the decisions that will shape the future of the country. For instance, a player can choose to create the United Kingdom, make Paris &quot;worth a Mass&quot;, or institute an East Indian Trade Company. They can now implement decisions on both country and province level, with the new decision system, including hundreds of different decisions depending on situation (for example state religion), and country.<br/><br/>There is a new mission system, where the player and AI will both be given goals to achieve, such as conquering Ireland (for England), vassalising Lorraine (for France), liberating your countrymen, or reclaiming stolen territory. In Nomine also features 'rebels with a cause'. There are countless types of rebels (Religious, Patriotic, Peasant...), with different goals, and different abilities. For example, patriot rebels mean 10 years more nationalism if they take control of a province, and are more likely to defect. You may get colonial rebels in your colonies determined to get representation or independence, you may get reactionary nobles rising up to put the serfs back where they belong. You can now choose between crushing them by force, negotiating with them, or leaving them and watching them enforce their demands on your country. Religious tolerance now depends on the ideas and decisions you take (rather than the more usual sliders), making it a new layer of strategy, although choices are few and far between. As cardinals stay loyal longer, the power of the Papal Controller has grown, as he can now excommunicate rulers, and call crusades against infidels (giving bonuses for any Catholic nation fighting them). It also features a colonial system, where there is a key metric - the distance between where you want to colonise and the nearest core port. Elections in Republics, scorched earth &amp; new spy missions also feature.<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;Europa Universalis III&quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "82073": {"videogame": {"70560": "Europa Universalis III"}, "statistics": {}, "name": "Europa Universalis III: Complete", "videogamemode": {"2310": "Network Multiplayer"}, "videogameversion": {"172483": "English/European Windows edition"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic811408.jpg", "videogameseries": {"5259": "Europa Universalis"}, "videogametheme": {"2345": "Historical"}, "usersrated": "38", "average": "8.41842", "videogamegenre": {"2166": "Real Time Strategy"}, "videogameplatform": {"4729": "Macintosh"}, "poll": {}, "videogamecompilation": {"70560": "Europa Universalis III"}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic811408_t.jpg", "description": "User Summary<br/><br/>Compilation including the original Europa Universalis III and its two expansion packs, Napoleon's Ambition and In Nomine.<br/>The game can now be played from 1399, the coronation of Henry IV of England, to the Age of Napoleon.<br/><br/>"}, "82074": {"rpgitemversion": {"63440": "Box set"}, "poll": {}, "name": "Spieler-Set", "rpgproducer": {"25836": "Volker Hirsch"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic800087.jpg", "usersrated": "5", "average": "6.8", "statistics": {}, "rpg": {"244": "Advanced Dungeons & Dragons (2nd Edition)"}, "rpgcategory": {"2083": "Core Rules (min needed to play)"}, "rpggenre": {"155": "Fantasy (High Fantasy)"}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic800087_t.jpg", "description": "<br/>User summary<br/><br/>The Spieler-Set (Player's Set) is a German boxed version of the Player's Handbook (AD&D 2e).

Leading an elite group of historians, researchers, scenario designers, writers, and graphic and audio artists, he has woven not just one, but four complete battle threads, each with its own unique core forces, into a single product that truly earns the name MEGA Campaign. Furthermore, it makes full use of the new icons, graphics and units, only available in Steel Panthers: World at War v8.0, some of which were created especially for this Mega Campaign. Based not only on exhaustive research, historical documents, and newly declassified information, but also on interviews and conversations with actual veterans of the units portrayed, this is more than just a game, it's military history at your finger tips. Screaming Eagles 1944-45 offers you more then just some scenarios. In it you will find dozens of pictures, backgrounds, historical documents and insights into the D-Day to VE-Day campaigns, some of them only recently unearthed and declassified, plus numerous maps to guide you to your objectives.

In that respect, this Mega Campaign is unique because you can play any of the four threads, and never repeat a single battle. No other Mega Campaign has ever been designed like this! In a Mega Campaign, you not only face standard attack or defend types of battles, but many unusual missions and variants will also test the limits of your wargaming skills.

What is a Mega Campaign you ask? Mega-Campaigns are specially designed and programmed campaign systems for Steel Panthers: World at War. Mega-Campaigns are non-linear; they branch into dozens of directions, depending on the victory level achieved by the player and also on his choices during play. In a Mega-Campaign, you not only face standard attack or defend types of battles, but many unusual missions and variants are also available for assignment. You may be sent to free POWs, or make an amphibious assault. You'll find dozens of pictures, backgrounds, historical documents and insights included with each Mega-Campaign, plus numerous maps to help find out where you are. As you win (or lose) battles, a map will display each location for you. For exceeding valor you may receive special awards. You will find yourself immersed in the campaign and a stand-alone battle will never feel the same again. The fact is to truly get the feel of a Mega Campaign one must experience it. SP:WaW also includes a timed play feature, giving each player a specific amount of time to conduct his turn before it ends and his opponent's turn begins. Armor, gun and vehicle units are represented by individual icons. Each infantry squad can have up to 25 men in it. Machine guns, mortars and artillery units are also realistically portrayed and crewed. Each hex represents 50 yards (meters) of the virtual battlefield, with many new terrain features added. Each game turn represents a few minutes of real time, and games can last from a few turns to entire campaigns<br/><br/>Source: The Publisher Website.<br/><br/>"}, "82105": {"statistics": {}, "name": "Beetlejuice (NES)", "videogamemode": {"2149": "Single-Player"}, "videogameversion": {"63488": "North American NES edition"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1017128.jpg", "videogametheme": {"2509": "Comedy"}, "usersrated": "6", "average": "4", "videogamegenre": {"2161": "Action Adventure"}, "videogameplatform": {"4430": "NES"}, "poll": {}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1017128_t.jpg", "description": "Beetlejuice is the title of three different video games.

The show also often used sound effects for the actions of not only BigFoot, but others as well.<br/><br/>Gameplay<br/><br/>The gameplay involves racing monster trucks including the title truck, BigFoot (blue). The computer controlled trucks are green (The Growler), and yellow (The Charger) if the computer's truck runs out of money and cannot repair their rig. It was not uncommon for a skilled player to be challenged by three to four different monster trucks during the game. In two player mode the 2nd player's truck is red. The object of the game is to advance to the next level (race) with incurring the least amount of damage as possible. The levels consist of car crushing, mud bog, tractor pull, hill climb, and the later levels is a combination of everything (except the sled pull) and is simply called a drag race. To advance to the next event you must complete a &quot;cross country&quot; race collecting money, points, etc. without damaging your truck.<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;BigFoot (video game)&quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "82108": {"statistics": {}, "name": "Games International (Issue 3 - Mar 1989)", "rpgproducer": {"14039": "Paul Mason"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic801411.jpg", "usersrated": "0", "average": "0", "rpgissue": {"6981": "Games International"}, "rpgissuearticle": {"17514": "Role-Playing Games"}, "rpg": {"1030": "Ars Magica (1st Edition)"}, "rpgissueversion": {"63492": "Issue 3"}, "poll": {}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic801411_t.jpg", "description": "Issue 3 of Games International.<br/><br/><br/>Contents<br/><br/>Cover - Capital Adventure<br/><br/>Up Front - Editorial<br/>Review Section<br/><br/>General Games Reviews;<br/><br/>     Poleconomy<br/>     Orgy<br/>     Family Business<br/>     Mr Trucker<br/>     Bewitched<br/>     Insider Dealing<br/>     Schoko &amp; Co<br/>     Slick<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Up the Poll - Election games<br/>R.I.P. -Square Mile<br/>Question Time - Triva games<br/>The Twilight Zone - Postal Diplomacy<br/>Desert Island Games - with Ellis Simpson<br/>Critics&rsquo; Choice - Pick of 1988<br/>Sniper - Gaming gossip<br/>News<br/><br/>Wargames Reviews<br/><br/>     West of Alamein<br/>     Gulf Strike<br/>     1812<br/>     Team Yankee<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Miniatures Overview - A look at old and new rules<br/><br/>Role-Playing Games Reviews<br/><br/>     Ars Magica<br/>     RuneQuest Cities<br/>     Harnmaster<br/>     Castles of Harn<br/>     Harn: Pilot&rsquo;s Almanac<br/>     Harn: Staff of Fanon<br/>     Warhammer: Realm of Chaos<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Rebound - Letters page<br/>Classifieds<br/><br/>"}, "82109": {"statistics": {}, "name": "Bill Elliott's NASCAR Challenge", "videogamemode": {"2149": "Single-Player"}, "videogameversion": {"63496": "NA NES edition"}, "average": "0", "videogameseries": {"28071": "Konami Silver Box"}, "videogametheme": {"2456": "Driving"}, "usersrated": "0", "videogamegenre": {"2154": "Racing"}, "videogameplatform": {"4415": "Amiga"}, "poll": {}, "description": "Bill Elliott's NASCAR Challenge is a video game developed by Distinctive Software and published by Konami and was released for PCs using MS-DOS in 1990, and the Commodore Amiga and Nintendo Entertainment System in 1991.

The race distance was chosen by the player, which ranged from 10 miles to the realistic distance of 500 miles for the superspeedway races. In the MS-DOS version, the championship consisted of a visit to each of the eight tracks. In the NES and Game Boy versions, the season championship consisted of each of the four tracks run twice, for a total of eight races.

Both of those versions also allowed the player to choose whether they would race with the effect of damage on their car or not.

If you have not acquired a Letter of Marque, every nation will see you as an enemy - you are a pirate.<br/><br/>Ships in this game range from a small Pinnace to a massive Ship of the Line. There are also missions you can complete for money, supplies, or improved relations. At higher levels you can also automate the game to some degree, by setting up trade routes that your trading fleets will follow from town to town.<br/><br/>True to history, home-country politics are fickle and impact the game: One year you might choose to be loyal to Spain and fight England - but a year later, might join the Dutch in their fight against the French.<br/><br/>Famous pirates of the age also make appearances. These sea wolves are likely to attack any ship or town that they please, including those that belong to the player. They usually operate from heavily fortified bases, but if you defeat them, you'll gain favor with any nation you choose.<br/><br/>Initially, you have operating constraints (how many fleets you may have and how many towns you can buy building permits in), but as you gain levels (based on net worth), you can have unlimited fleets and permits.<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;Port Royale 2&quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "82123": {"statistics": {}, "name": "Sports Champions", "videogamemode": {"2422": "Local Multiplayer"}, "videogameversion": {"63518": "American PS3 Edition"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic818948.jpg", "videogameseries": {"22748": "Sports Champions"}, "videogametheme": {"2405": "Sports - Other"}, "usersrated": "28", "average": "6.85714", "videogamegenre": {"2157": "Sports"}, "videogameplatform": {"4435": "PlayStation 3"}, "poll": {}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic818948_t.jpg", "description": "Sports Champions is a 2010 sports video game for the PlayStation 3, which utilizes the PlayStation Move controllers.

The machine featured an all-new grey case featuring a spring-loaded keyboard, dual joystick ports, and a built-in cassette recorder dubbed the &quot;Datacorder&quot; (like the Amstrad CPC 464), but was in most respects identical to the ZX Spectrum 128. The main menu screen lacked the Spectrum 128's &quot;Tape Test&quot; option, and the ROM was altered to account for a new 1986 Amstrad copyright message. These changes resulted in minor incompatibility problems with software that accessed ROM routines at certain addresses. Production costs had been reduced and the retail price dropped to &pound;139 - &pound;149.<br/><br/>The new keyboard did not include the BASIC keyword markings that were found on earlier Spectrums, except for the keywords LOAD, CODE and RUN which were useful for loading software. This was not a major issue however, as the +2 boasted a menu system, almost identical to the ZX Spectrum 128, where one could switch between 48k BASIC programming with the keywords, and 128k BASIC programming in which all words (keywords and otherwise) must be typed out in full (although the keywords are still stored internally as one character each). Despite these changes, the layout remained identical to that of the 128.<br/><br/>The ZX Spectrum +2A was produced to homogenise Amstrad's range in 1987. Although the case reads &quot;ZX Spectrum +2&quot;, the +2A/B is easily distinguishable from the original +2 as the case was restored to the standard Spectrum black.<br/><br/>The +2A was derived from Amstrad's +3 4.1 ROM model, using a new motherboard which vastly reduced the chip count, integrating many of them into a new ASIC. The +2A replaced the +3's disk drive and associated hardware with a tape drive, as in the original +2. Originally, Amstrad planned to introduce an additional disk interface, but this never appeared. If an external disk drive was added, the &quot;+2A&quot; on the system OS menu would change to a +3. As with the ZX Spectrum +3, some older 48K, and a few older 128K, games were incompatible with the machine.<br/><br/>The ZX Spectrum +2B signified a manufacturing move from Hong Kong to Taiwan later in 1987.<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;Zx spectrum  3&quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "82134": {"rpgitemversion": {"63539": "Loose Leaf"}, "poll": {}, "name": "The Freak Show", "rpgproducer": {"3": "(Uncredited)"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic880836.jpg", "usersrated": "0", "average": "0", "statistics": {}, "rpg": {"13236": "AD&D First Edition (1e) Compatible Products"}, "rpgcategory": {"2136": "Solitaire Adventure"}, "rpggenre": {"961": "Fantasy"}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic880836_t.jpg", "description": "User summary:<br/><br/>A 3 mini solo adventures for 1st to 4th level characters.

As a result, the title earned the No.1 sales spot in 15 countries around the world and is now available for iPad featuring 1024x768 HD support.<br/><br/>CHAOS RINGS is set around a battle tournament called Arca Arena, where teams of two compete for victory and eternal life. Characters gain levels and earn experience points from defeating their foes to upgrade their team's combo skills, enabling the pair to launch bigger, stronger and more devastating attacks.<br/><br/>The unique story of CHAOS RINGS unfolds based on the pairing of characters that the players choose. By experiencing the story lines of each pairing, the true mystery of Arca Arena will be unveiled.<br/><br/>Featuring a turn-based battle system, players are given the choice between &quot;solo&quot; moves, where they can enter commands separately, or &quot;pair&quot; moves, to execute actions as a team. Working as a &quot;pair&quot; allows the characters to concentrate their efforts for more effective power. Defeating enemy monsters allows players to obtain specific DNA information called &quot;gene,&quot; which players can equip to learn the monster's magic and special attack moves.<br/><br/>For more information, please visit the official CHAOS RINGS website: <a target='_blank' href='http://dlgames.square-enix.com/chaosrings' rel='nofollow'>http://dlgames.square-enix.com/chaosrings</a><br/><br/>Source: The Publisher Website.<br/><br/>"}, "82146": {"videogame": {"80505": "Gold, Silver, Bronze"}, "statistics": {}, "name": "Winter Games", "videogamemode": {"2409": "Hotseat"}, "videogameversion": {"98740": "North American Atari 7800 edition"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1436980.jpg", "videogameseries": {"24236": "Epyx Sports Games"}, "videogametheme": {"2428": "Minigame Compilation"}, "usersrated": "37", "average": "6.24135", "videogamegenre": {"2157": "Sports"}, "videogameplatform": {"4415": "Amiga"}, "poll": {}, "videogamecompilation": {"80505": "Gold, Silver, Bronze"}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1436980_t.jpg", "description": "User Summary<br/><br/>A sports video game from Epyx; a sequel to Summer Games.<br/><br/>Events include:<br/><br/>Alpine skiing <br/>Ski jumping <br/>Biathlon <br/>Bobsled <br/>Figure skating <br/>Speed skating <br/>Luge <br/>Freestyle skiing<br/><br/>"}, "82147": {"statistics": {}, "name": "One on One: Dr. J vs. Larry Bird", "videogamemode": {"2422": "Local Multiplayer"}, "videogameversion": {"298520": "North American Atari XE edition"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1058510.png", "videogametheme": {"2361": "Sports - Basketball"}, "usersrated": "13", "average": "6.47769", "videogamegenre": {"2157": "Sports"}, "videogameplatform": {"4415": "Amiga"}, "poll": {}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1058510_t.png", "description": "Dr. J and Larry Bird Go One on One, more commonly known as One on One, is a 1983 computer basketball game for the early era of home computers.

The player cannot freely change character; the player begins in control of Wally and, in order to switch to another character, must first locate them.

Famed pilot Chuck Yeager  was a technical consultant in the game and his digitized voice is featured in the game, giving encouragement and praises before and after missions.<br/><br/>The game is characterized for its good balance of an action laden gameplay which focuses on classical dog fights and a simple but still realistic flight model which justifies calling Chuck Yeager's Air Combat a simulation. Unlike in many other flight simulation games of its day, altitude and aircraft characteristics have a big influence on the behaviour of the game's simulated aircraft. Realism has been sacrificed to some degree to enhance gameplay however: E.g. a real fighter plane expends all of its ammunition after a few short bursts, while in Chuck Yeager's Air Combat the rate of fire has been reduced considerably, making dog fights longer.<br/><br/>To assist a newcomer to the game several help features can be activated, such as unlimited ammunition or easier aiming. A virtual Chuck Yeager can be activated, who gives advice.<br/>[..]<br/><br/>Aircraft<br/><br/>The game featured six player-flyable aircraft: P-51D Mustang, F-86E Sabre, F-4E Phantom II, Fw.190A-8, the Soviet MiG-15 'Fagot' and MiG-21MF 'Fishbed'. Other featured AI-driven aircraft were: Me.109E, Me.110B, Me-163B Komet, Me-262 Schwalbe , P-47D Thunderbolt, Yak-9, MiG-17MF 'Fresco' and F-105D Thunderchief as opposing fighters and B-17E, B-29C, B-52 and L-5 as aircraft to either protect or shoot down, depending on the mission.<br/><br/>Flying Modes<br/><br/>Three different fly modes were available: Free Flight, which put the user in a selected airplane in a non-hostile environment; Create a Mission, where the user could specify which airplane to pilot against a selected number of AI-driven aircraft of varying levels of difficulty; and Historical Flight, where user could select among three wars to fly in: World War II, Korean, and Vietnam.<br/>[..]<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;Chuck Yeager's Air Combat&quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "82161": {"videogame": {"136918": "Combat Aces"}, "statistics": {}, "name": "AV8B Harrier Assault", "videogamemode": {"2149": "Single-Player"}, "vgcharacterversion": {"119614": "Harrier Jump Jet"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1547013.png", "videogametheme": {"2514": "Flight"}, "usersrated": "0", "videogamecharacter": {"11871": "Harrier Jump Jet"}, "average": "0", "videogamegenre": {"2295": "Flight Simulator"}, "videogameplatform": {"4415": "Amiga"}, "videogameversion": {"63590": "NA DOS 3.5\" Disk edition"}, "poll": {}, "videogamecompilation": {"136918": "Combat Aces"}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1547013_t.png", "description": "AV-8B Harrier Assault is a combat flight simulator/realtime strategy game developed by Simis and first published by Domark in 1992<br/><br/>Setting and gameplay<br/><br/>The game is set in a fictional conflict between US forces and the Indonesian army occupying East Timor. A battlegroup lead by USS Tarawa  is diverted from a navy exercise along with its escorts and is ordered to aid the Rapid Deployment Force (RDF) Marine units engage the Indonesian forces and occupy the island. The carrier group is equipped with a squadron of 16 AV-8B Harrier II jets, a number of CH-46 Sea Knight and CH-53 Sea Stallion helicopters stationed on Tarawa and the escort vessels and a brigade of AAV-7A1 Amphibious Assault Vehicles, tanks and support vehicles aiding the marines and the special forces units.<br/><br/>The game is a cross between a real time strategy game and a flight simulator. Players can literally completely ignore one of the elements and either play a pure real-time strategy game controlling the forces as the battle plan progresses, or alternatively participate only in combat, flying the AV-8B Harrier missions. In practice however, tweaking the battle plan is essential as enemy re-enforcements or lost ground battles can affect the plan as a whole. Similarly, flying some missions is essential, e.g. intercepting C-130 planes carrying enemy reinforcements, something that the game's AI cannot handle properly. Otherwise, enemy forces may overwhelm their target and re-establish control of strategic locations.<br/><br/>The game starts in the Tarawa command center where a battle plan can be designed on the area maps. Player are given the choice of creating their own battle plans or loading the Ocean Sabre plan in the Tactical Amphibious Warfare Data System (TAWADS), containing navy/army deployments and operations spanning a five day period. The battle plan contains every movement of the navy, army and aerial unit planned for every stage of the operation and it needs to take into account all expected enemy strength at various points in the operation area (cities, villages, airports, fuel dumps, etc.). When the battle plan initiates the first combat flying mission becomes available, where the player can attack a number of targets on the island. As the game progresses new missions become available, ranging from bombing enemy bases and vehicles, reconnaissance, air superiority, interception and close air support of friendly units. The game ends when all enemy forces are destroyed and all strategic locations are occupied by friendly forces.<br/><br/>Flight Simulator<br/><br/>The game's flight simulator quite convincingly portrays the flying characteristics of an AV-8B Harrier II jet. The fighter plane can take-off horizontally or vertically (when payload permits) from the deck of the USS Tarawa and land vertically when the mission ends. Inside the cockpit, the HUD and MFD provide combat information of enemy units along with aircraft and mission data and the point of view  can be rotated left, right and back. There are two external camera views, one following the plane and a stationary flyby camera view, which displays a view of the aircraft as it speeds past the camera.<br/><br/>A variety of weaponry is available to load before each mission, ranging from air-to-air AIM-9 Sidewinder missiles to air-to-ground GBU-12 Paveway II bombs, MK-20 Rockeye II cluster bombs, Hydra rockets, AGM-88 HARM and AGM-65 Maverick missiles. The fighter is also equipped with a GAU-12 Equalizer 25mm gatling cannon which can pack a devastating blow to almost all ground and air targets.<br/><br/>PC versions<br/><br/>The PC version of the game was originally released with VGA resolution (320x200) graphics. A subsequent release in the same year upscaled the graphics to SVGA resolution (640x400)[2], creating the very first SVGA flight simulator. The game in the SVGA release was re-branded to Super-VGA Harrier.<br/><br/>Flying nightmares<br/><br/>Macintosh and 3DO versions of the game were titled as &quot;Flying Nightmares&quot;. Mac version was absolutelly similar to SVGA Harrier assault, while 3DO version had somewhat improved graphics. Sequel to Flying nightmares was in development for PC and various consoles, but was later canceled. Tech demo was ready at the moment of cancellation.<br/><br/>Controversy<br/><br/>The game was banned in Australia due to protests from the Catholic Teachers Federation, on the grounds that the game is offensive to East Timorese<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;AV-8B Harrier Assault&quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "82162": {"rpgitemversion": {"63591": "Hardcover Version"}, "statistics": {}, "name": "Hellfrost Encounters Book 1", "rpgproducer": {"13278": "Paul \"Wiggy\" Wade-Williams"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic904230.jpg", "usersrated": "4", "rpgsetting": {"3961": "Hellfrost"}, "average": "8", "rpggenre": {"155": "Fantasy (High Fantasy)"}, "rpg": {"286": "Savage Worlds"}, "rpgcategory": {"2084": "Scenario / Adventure / Module"}, "poll": {}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic904230_t.jpg", "description": "Publisher Blurb:<br/><br/>BEWARE THE ROAD LESS TRAVELLED!<br/><br/>Designed with the busy GM in mind, this book contains 50 detailed encounters covering a variety of situations and locales.<br/><br/>Whether you&rsquo;re after a random encounter that&rsquo;s more than just a standup fight on featureless terrain, an exciting mini-adventure on the spur of the moment, something to break up the party&rsquo;s travels, or a starting scene for an adventure of your own devising, this book has something for you.<br/><br/>To help speed up play, every encounter is designed to fit one or two pages containing all of its pertinent information, so there's no need to flip between pages.

The US release of the game is called Wings Over Europe: Cold War Gone Hot, however, the tag line is changed to Wings Over Europe: Soviet Invasion for the European market. The time period covered is 1962 to 1984.<br/><br/>The game includes a wide variety of real jets and weapons from the era which can be employed in various mission types such as Combat Air Patrol, Interception, Close Air Support, Iron Hand, Wild Weasel, and Reconnaissance. The game is based on the Strike Fighters: Project 1 engine and was developed by Third Wire Productions.<br/><br/>In 2009, an updated version for the Windows Vista platform called Strike Fighters 2 Europe was released. The original game, however, is still compatible with Vista and Windows 7.<br/><br/> Background'<br/><br/>Wings Over Europe was released in 2006 and was the fourth in a series of &quot;Lite&quot; Flight Simulators. The term &quot;Lite&quot; was applied because they are designed to be relatively easy to learn and play compared to other more hardcore types of flight simulator.<br/><br/>The developer took and improved on its existing Strike Fighters game engine and thus the game was another step forward in terms of quality and game play. The game included better graphics, more planes, improved campaigns, and simulated clouds.<br/><br/>Game Play<br/><br/>Despite the &quot;Lite&quot; tag, a fair amount of realism has been built in; 60s-style bombsights are simulated for the pre 1970&rsquo;s aircraft rather than modern computer-aided aiming reticules. Dive bombing and level bombing techniques have to be worked out by the game player if they are to have success at completing missions. Aircraft that come into service after 1970 have advanced Head Up Displays that allow the player to aim bombs with more accuracy than manual dive bombing techniques. Laser Guided bombs such as the GBU-12 Paveway are included; so are the A and B versions of the AGM-65 Maverick, allowing much easier ground target destruction for the late 1970&rsquo;s aircraft.<br/><br/>US Air to Air missiles in the game consist of versions of the AIM-9 Sidewinder, AIM-7 Sparrow, and AIM-4 Falcon which are simulated to be as unreliable as the real missiles were. So regardless of having a &quot;good lock on the target&quot; there is a good chance the missile will miss. Missiles from 1978 onwards such as the AIM-9L version of the Sidewinder are much improved and more likely to score a hit. Dogfights are usually close in affairs regardless of the time period, however as the Missiles get better over time, longer range kills can be achieved.<br/><br/>The map of Germany has been scaled down slightly so that there is less time spent flying to a target, and also because air-to-air refuelling is not included in the game. The lack of water on the map has meant that aircraft carrier operations have not been included this time.<br/><br/>During a mission the player will fly in a flight of aircraft in which the computer-controlled planes keep in formation as you fly to a target. This flight can be issued commands; attack other aircraft or ground targets, fly home if they are damaged, or jettison their drop tanks. As you fly many other computer-controlled aircraft will be up in the air and can be viewed as they engage in dogfights or bomb targets.<br/><br/>Flying over Soviet held East Germany the player's aircraft will be met with a high level of radar guided Surface to Air Missiles (SAMS), and a variety of lethal Anti-Aircraft Artillery (AAA). The main SAMs are the soviet SA-2 and SA-6, of which early and later versions are included in the game increasing lethality accordingly.<br/><br/>The player can select a fictitious campaign from either Red Thunder (1962), Red Hammer (1968), or Red Lightning (1979); each being from a different time era with different aircraft and weapons forcing the player to employ different tactics in each.<br/><br/>Single Missions are also available, which can be customised to allow the player to practice with specific aircraft and weapons.<br/><br/>Open architecture<br/><br/>The game has been designed so that it can be changed by anyone with a passion to do so. This has spawned a large online community who not only play the game but go out of their way to improve the game as much as they can. Most modders works can be downloaded and used for free by any game player.<br/><br/>Mods include new vehicle models, flight physics and AI behaviour, campaigns, missions, sound and graphics media.<br/><br/>Featured aircraft<br/><br/>The standard game comes with the following flyable allied aircraft:<br/><br/>* A-10 Thunderbolt II - A-10A version of the &lsquo;Warthog&rsquo; for the USAF<br/>    * Hawker Siddeley Harrier - AV-8A version for the USMC and GR.1 and GR.3 variants for the British RAF<br/>    * Hawker Hunter - FGA.9 Version for the RAF.<br/>    * F-100 Super Sabre - F-100D is included for the USAF and French Air Force.<br/>    * F-105 Thunderchief - F-105D is included for the USAF.<br/>    * F-4 Phantom II - The game includes the F-4C, F-4D and F-4E for the USAF, the F-4M for the RAF and F-4F for the German Luftwaffe.<br/>    * F-15 Eagle - F-15A version for the USAF.<br/><br/>The following non-flyable allied aircraft:<br/><br/>* B-52 Stratofortress - B-52D Version.<br/>    * B-57 Canberra - B-57B Version.<br/>    * Cessna L-19 - O-1E Bird Dog version.<br/><br/>The computer-controlled Soviet aircraft:<br/><br/>* Ilyushin Il-28 - Beagle bomber version.<br/>    * Tupolev Tu-16 - Badger A version.<br/>    * Tupolev Tu-22 - Tu-22B (Blinder A) version.<br/>    * Sukhoi Su-7 - Su-7BM (Fitter A) version.<br/>    * An-12 - An-12BP (Cub A) version.<br/>    * MiG-17 - MiG-17 (Fresco A) and F (Fresco C) variants.<br/>    * MiG-19 - MiG-19S Farmer C version.<br/>    * MiG-21 - MiG-21F (Fishbed C), MF (Fishbed J), PF (Fishbed D), PFM (Fishbed F) variants<br/>    * MiG-23 - MiG-23M (Flogger B) version<br/>    * MiG-27 - MiG-27 (Flogger D) version<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;Wings Over Europe&quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "82168": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2792336.png", "poll": {}, "boardgamedesigner": {"40648": {"name": "Mario Porpora"}}, "statistics": {}, "yearpublished": "2010", "maxplayers": "8", "boardgameartist": {"28355": "Giulia Ghigini"}, "boardgamepublisher": {"10768": {"name": "Cranio Creations"}}, "maxplaytime": "45", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2792336_t.png", "minplaytime": "30", "boardgamecategory": {"1024": {"name": "Horror"}}, "boardgamehonor": {"19755": "2011 Diana Jones Award for Excellence in Gaming Nominee"}, "description": "Escape from the Aliens in Outer Space is a card game of strategy and bluff set on a badly damaged deep space research ship.

As you fly many other computer-controlled aircraft will be up in the air and can be viewed as they engage in dogfights or bomb targets.<br/><br/>True to the Vietnam theatre the player's aircraft will be met with a high level of radar guided Surface to Air Missiles (SAMS), and a variety of lethal Anti-Aircraft Artillery (AAA). The main SAM is the soviet SA-2, of which early and later versions are included in the game increasing lethality accordingly.<br/><br/>The player can select a campaign from either Operation Rolling Thunder (1965 to 1968), Linebacker I (1972) or Linebacker II (1972) which are similar in name and aircraft involved to the actual campaigns from the conflict.<br/><br/>Single Missions are also available, which can be customised to allow the player to practice with specific aircraft and weapons.<br/><br/>Open architecture<br/><br/>The game has been designed so that it can be changed by anyone with a passion to do so. This has spawned a large online community who not only play the game but go out of their way to improve the game as much as they can.

It seems that just about every new supplement had to have at least a handful of these feats.<br/><br/>Metamagic feats let casters modify their spells. Want a summon monster spell that lasts longer than normal? Apply Extend Spell. Want some extra firepower? Apply Empower Spell or Maximize Spell. In a hurry? Apply Quicken Spell. Sounds like fun, doesn't it?<br/><br/>Unfortunately, sounds (like appearances) can be deceiving. In my experience, metamagic feats are seldom used. Players don't take them. Feats are precious commodities, after all, and spending a feat for an effect of limited utility can be a hard sell. What's more, the inclusion of metamagic rods combined with the all-too-common Magic Shop Syndrome pretty much makes metamagic feats obsolete.<br/><br/>The coolness that should've been metamagic feats has long rankled me, so I decided to do something about it.

The game is based on the Strike Fighters engine and was developed by Third Wire Productions.<br/><br/>Background<br/><br/>Wings Over Israel was released in 2008 and was part of the Strike Fighters series of &quot;lite&quot; flight simulators developed by Third Wire Productions. The term &quot;lite&quot; was applied because they are designed to be relatively easy to learn and play compared to other more &quot;hardcore&quot; flight simulators.<br/><br/>The game was set in Middle East from 1967 to 1982, player flying the IDF/AF jet fighters in three historical campaigns. The developer took and improved on its existing Strike Fighters engine and thus the game was another step forward in terms of quality and game play.<br/><br/>Game Play<br/><br/>Despite the &quot;lite&quot; tag, a fair amount of realism has been built in; 60s-style bombsights are simulated for the pre 1970&rsquo;s aircraft rather than modern computer-aided aiming reticules. Dive bombing and level bombing techniques have to be worked out by the game player if they are to have success at completing missions. Aircraft that come into service after 1970 have advanced Head-Up-Displays that allow the player to aim bombs with more accuracy than manual dive bombing techniques. The A and B versions of the AGM-65 Maverick, allowing much easier ground target destruction for the late 1970&rsquo;s aircraft.<br/><br/>Israeli air-to-air missiles in the game consist of versions of the AIM-9 Sidewinder, AIM-7 Sparrow, Matra 530, Shafrir-2, and Python-3. Early missiles are simulated to be as unreliable as the real missiles were, so regardless of having a &quot;good lock on the target&quot; there is a good chance the missile will still miss. Later model missiles from such as the AIM-9L version of the Sidewinder are much improved and more likely to score a hit. Dogfights are usually close-in affairs regardless of the time period, however as the missiles get better over time, longer range kills can be achieved.<br/><br/>During a mission the player will fly in a flight of aircraft in which the computer-controlled planes keep in formation as you fly to a target. This flight can be issued commands; attack other aircraft or ground targets, fly home if they are damaged, or jettison their drop tanks. As you fly many other computer-controlled aircraft will be up in the air and can be viewed as they engage in dogfights or bomb targets.<br/><br/>Flying over Egyptian or Syrian territories, the player's aircraft will be met with a high level of radar-guided Surface to Air Missiles (SAM), and a variety of lethal Anti-Aircraft Artillery (AAA). The main SAMs are the soviet SA-2 and SA-6, of which early and later versions are included in the game increasing lethality accordingly.<br/><br/>The player can select a historical campaign from either Six-day War (1967), October War (1973), or Lebanon War (1982); each being from a different time era with different aircraft and weapons forcing the player to employ different tactics in each.<br/><br/>Single Missions are also available, which can generate random missions.<br/><br/>Featured aircraft<br/><br/>The game comes with the following flyable Israeli aircraft:<br/><br/>* A-4 - A-4E Ahit, A-4F Ahit, A-4H Ahit for IDF/AF.<br/>    * F-4 - F-4E Kurnass for IDF/AF.<br/>    * F-15 - F-15A Baz for IDF/AF.<br/>    * F-16 - F-16A Netz for IDF/AF.<br/>    * Mirage III - Mirage IIIC Shahak for IDF/AF.<br/>    * Nesher - Israeli built Mirage 5 copy for IDF/AF.<br/>    * Kfir - IAI Kfir C.2 version.<br/><br/>The computer-controlled AI aircraft:<br/><br/>* Myst&egrave;re - Myst&egrave;re IVA version for IDF/AF.<br/>    * Super Myst&egrave;re - Super Myst&egrave;re B.2 version IDF/AF.<br/>    * Sa'ar - IAI Improved Super Mystere for IDF/AF.<br/>    * Vautour - Vautour IIA bomber version for IDF/AF.<br/>    * Hunter - FGA.50, FGA.59, FGA.73 variants.<br/>    * Mirage 5D - Mirage 5 for Libyan AF.<br/>    * An-12 - An-12BP (Cub-A) version.<br/>    * MiG-17 - MiG-17 (Fresco-A) and F (Fresco-C) variants.<br/>    * MiG-19 - MiG-19S (Farmer-C) version.<br/>    * MiG-21 - MiG-21F (Fishbed-C), PF (Fishbed-D), PFM (Fishbed-F), MF (Fishbed-J), bis (Fishbed-L) variants.<br/>    * MiG-23 - MiG-23MS (Flogger-E export), MiG-23MF (Flogger-B), MiG-23BM (Flogger-H ground attack) variants.<br/>    * IL-28 - Beagle bomber version.<br/>    * Tu-16 - Badger-A version.<br/>    * Su-7 - Su-7BMK (Fitter-A) version.<br/><br/>[..]<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;Wings Over Israel&quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>User addition<br/><br/>The game is only available as download from Third Wire's site<br/>Multiplayer is only possible through direct IP connection<br/><br/>"}, "82176": {"rpg": {"356": "Generic / Universal"}, "statistics": {}, "name": "Anyburg and the Lands Thereabout", "rpgproducer": {"9077": "Mark Wightman"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2430478.jpg", "usersrated": "0", "rpgitemversion": {"63625": "PDF Version"}, "average": "0", "rpggenre": {"961": "Fantasy"}, "rpgcategory": {"2107": "Campaign Setting (game world)"}, "poll": {}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2430478_t.jpg", "description": "From the introduction:<br/><br/>As a Games Master, there will come a point in your career when you will want an urban setting to let your players loose in. Be it a base between adventures or the backdrop to a scenario in itself, a fantasy town offers a nice contrast to wandering around the wilderness or deep underground.<br/><br/>However, there is one problem: how do you make a town seem a realistic, believable, vibrant place, rather than just a set of buildings populated by Non Player Characters just waiting for the party to walk around the corner? How do you know enough about the place to give the party the background information they need?<br/><br/>One solution is to get a ready-made town or city and adapt it to your game world. And this is fine, but there are two potential drawbacks. Firstly, what makes sense to me as a generic-city-designer might not make sense in your campaign world: what if I plan dozens of temples and your campaign world is atheist, for instance? Secondly, you will have to spend quite a lot of preparation time learning the details of my city- and amending them to fit your world.<br/><br/>What I propose is to set down a set of fairly straightforward principles that you can use to help design your own town or city. You can use all the elements I suggest or you can disregard or alter them as you see fit. This will ensure the final product is tailored to fit your campaign world. Also, because you will have been involved in the design process, the town will already have a life of its own in your mind: it will be much easier for you make the place seem real and buzzing than it would if you had to step into someone else&rsquo;s creation cold.<br/><br/>"}, "82177": {"rpg": {"4702": "All for One: R\u00e9gime Diabolique"}, "poll": {}, "name": "Richelieu's Guide to Expanded Characters", "rpgproducer": {"3": "(Uncredited)"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic886892.jpg", "usersrated": "0", "rpgitemversion": {"63626": "PDF Version"}, "average": "0", "statistics": {}, "rpggenre": {"180": "Action / Adventure (Swashbuckling / Pirates)"}, "rpgcategory": {"2108": "Sourcebook (rules/options to enhance play)"}, "rpgseries": {"10012": "Richelieu's Guide"}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic886892_t.jpg", "description": "Publisher Blurb:<br/>This supplement for the All for One: Regime Diabolique RPG delves into enhanced character generation, looking at both female heroes and giving rules for creating characters outside the Musketeers.

He has described the game world as &quot;overwhelming, like an MMORPG&quot; and compared its size to that of Japan, stating that from &quot;one end to the other,&quot; the game's world is &quot;about the size of the Japanese archipelago.&quot;<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;Xenoblade&quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "82246": {"statistics": {}, "name": "X-Scape", "videogamemode": {"2149": "Single-Player"}, "videogameversion": {"63764": "AU DS Edition"}, "average": "0", "videogametheme": {"2331": "Space"}, "usersrated": "0", "videogamegenre": {"2160": "First Person Shooter"}, "videogameplatform": {"4734": "Nintendo DS"}, "poll": {}, "description": "&quot;X-Scape, known in Japan as X-Returns  (X-RETURNS\uff08\u30a8\u30c3\u30af\u30b9 \u30ea\u30bf\u30fc\u30f3\u30ba\uff09)  and in PAL regions as 3D Space Tank, is a first-person combat simulation game developed by Q-Games and Nintendo  released on the Nintendo DSi's DSiWare download service. It is a sequel to the Japan-exclusive Game Boy  title, X.<br/><br/>Players control a commander who has returned to his home after a decade-long tour of duty. However, an evil warlord has taken control of the entire planet, forcing the commander to take control of an enhanced version of the mobile spacecraft from the game's predecessor, VIXIV. Throughout the game, the player will visit 20 different planets as well as completing a number of main missions and side missions.<br/><br/>X-Scape is seen in a first-person perspective. It uses the Nintendo DSi's top screen to show players' surroundings, while the bottom screen acts as a means to control the game and a radar. Moving the stylus to the top of the bottom screen causes players to move forward, while moving from side-to-side allows players to look around. Pushing any of the d-pad or face buttons causes the players' tank to fire. There are two types of missions: tunnel and planet. In tunnel missions, players control the tank, attempting to escape through a narrow tunnel as fast as possible, avoiding barricades, attacking foes, and collecting coins to add to the constantly ticking down timer. In the planet missions, players are able to freely explore the area. They must destroy a set number of enemies throughout the world in order to progress to the next mission. Players are able to fly into the air by hitting pyramid-shaped ramps. Several secrets can be found throughout the game, including an ability to fly into the air at any time. Other tasks on the planet missions include searching for bombs in order to deactivate them, as well as hackable buildings that reveal the game's backstory.&quot;<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;X-Scape&quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "82247": {"rpg": {"356": "Generic / Universal"}, "statistics": {}, "name": "Dungeon Traps", "rpgproducer": {"3": "(Uncredited)"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic880821.jpg", "usersrated": "0", "rpgitemversion": {"63766": "Softcover"}, "average": "0", "rpggenre": {"961": "Fantasy"}, "rpgcategory": {"2108": "Sourcebook (rules/options to enhance play)"}, "poll": {}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic880821_t.jpg", "description": "User summary:<br/><br/>8 unique traps for the Dungeon Master's use.<br/><br/>"}, "82248": {"statistics": {}, "name": "Heart of Africa", "videogamemode": {"2149": "Single-Player"}, "videogameversion": {"63767": "C64 edition"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic803427.jpg", "videogametheme": {"2345": "Historical"}, "usersrated": "3", "average": "8.33333", "videogamegenre": {"2158": "Strategy"}, "videogameplatform": {"4420": "Commodore 64"}, "poll": {}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic803427_t.jpg", "description": "User Description (Haggis):<br/><br/>Electronic Arts' follow-up to The Seven Cities of Gold.

Surrounded by similar transgressors, antagonized by the darkness in their souls, forced to the edges of insanity and suffering, the characters must plead forgiveness for their crimes and transcend, or become manifestations of their wrongs.<br/><br/>The text in Lost Memories assumes that the reader has an understanding of various role-playing conventions, and will not take the time to explain common terminology or concepts.<br/><br/>Lost Memories is not a conventional role-playing game. For one, this game is not intended for long, campaign-style play, the subject matter and progression of the game makes the ideal story to run from 1-6 sessions. Lost Memories also requires a lot of cohesion between the GM and all of the players, it requires a collectively agreed-upon interpretation of morality, a strong understanding of each others' comfort level concerning mature issues, and a strong bond of trust between the GM and players, as the GM has more control over the PCs in this game than in most. The game is also much more single-minded than most games. The entire goal of the game is to have characters question their own concept of right and wrong, and to confront things from the past that they have forgotten. Lost Memories is intended to be an experiment in role-playing, not a universal system for many types of games, or a setting easily converted to other games. With all of this said, I hope that you have fun trying to make sense out of this current version.<br/><br/>To play Lost Memories you need someone to GM, at least one person to play, 1d10 per person, pencils, paper, and maybe a print-off of the character sheets at the end of this PDF.<br/><br/>"}, "82291": {"statistics": {}, "name": "The Duel: Test Drive II", "videogamemode": {"2149": "Single-Player"}, "videogameversion": {"341094": "Amiga re-release"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1035951.jpg", "videogameseries": {"5513": "Test Drive"}, "videogametheme": {"2456": "Driving"}, "usersrated": "10", "videogameexpansion": {"96984": "California Challenge: Test Drive II Scenery Disk"}, "average": "7", "videogamegenre": {"2154": "Racing"}, "videogameplatform": {"4415": "Amiga"}, "poll": {}, "videogamecompilation": {"195164": "Test Drive II: The Collection"}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1035951_t.jpg", "description": "Like the original Test Drive, the focus of The Duel is driving exotic cars through dangerous highways, evading traffic, and trying to escape police pursuits. While the first game in the series had the player simply racing for time in a single scenario, Test Drive II improves upon its predecessor by introducing varied scenery, and giving the player the option of racing against the clock or competing against a computer-controlled opponent.<br/><br/>The player initially is given the opportunity to choose a car to drive and a level of difficulty, which in turn determines whether the car will use and automatic or manual transmission--the number of difficulty options varies between gaming platforms. Levels begin with the player&rsquo;s car (and the computer opponent, if selected) idling on a roadway. Primarily these are two to four lane public highways with many turns; each level is different, and they include obstacles such as bridges, cliffs, and tunnels in addition to the other cars already on the road. Each level also has one or more police cars along the course.<br/>The goal of each level is to reach the gas station at the end of the course in the least amount of time. Stopping at the gas station is not mandatory, and one could drive past it if inattentive. The consequence of not stopping results in running out of gas, a thus losing a car (life). The player begins the game with 5 lives, one of which is lost each time that the player crashes into something. If the player completes a level without crashing or running out of gas, then he or she is awarded a bonus life. In addition to losing a life, crashing adds thirty seconds to the player's time. Cars could crash into other traffic or off-road obstacles such as trees; they could crash by falling off the cliff on one of the mountain levels, or they could sustain too much damage by staying off the roadway for too long on the flatland levels. Players could also lose a life when using a manual transmission by redlining and consequently blowing the engine. Crashing into a police car instantly ends the game, regardless of the number of lives the player has left.<br/><br/>Police cars appear in every level, and if the player is driving faster than the speed limit when encountering one of them, the police car will follow in pursuit. If at any point while being pursued the police car is able to pass the player&rsquo;s car get in front of it, the player is forced to pull over and receives a ticket stating the offense and the speed of the vehicle. While this doesn&rsquo;t cost the player a life, it does take away valuable time. Players can avoid being pursued by police by slowing down before encountering them, anticipating them through the aid of a radar detector, which comes standard in all vehicles in the game.<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;The Duel: Test Drive II&quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "82292": {"statistics": {}, "name": "Test Drive III: The Passion", "videogamemode": {"2409": "Hotseat"}, "videogameversion": {"63902": "US DOS Version"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic968460.jpg", "videogameseries": {"5513": "Test Drive"}, "videogametheme": {"2456": "Driving"}, "usersrated": "6", "average": "7", "videogamegenre": {"2154": "Racing"}, "videogameplatform": {"4714": "DOS"}, "poll": {}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic968460_t.jpg", "description": "Test Drive was one of the original games that had the concept of a free landscape.

It's a combination of guilt and fear.<br/><br/>Just how honourable your samurai is trying to be depends on how wicked they have been in the past. When you create your samurai character you'll be asked to devise a number of secrets about the bad things they have done. Each secret gives your samurai one point of honour. Your character starts off with either two, three or four secrets so your character will have a starting honour score of two, three, or four.<br/><br/>Your samurai has good reason to behave honourably and will be reluctant to depart from the code. Every time you want your samurai to breach the rules of honour, or ignore an obvious opportunity to do something honourable, your GM may force you to make an honour roll.<br/><br/>For an honour roll, roll a single d6 and compare it to your samurai's honour score on your character sheet. If you scored lower than your character's honour then your samurai chooses the honourable course of behaviour dictated by your GM. If you roll higher than your samurai's honour then you are free to ignore the code and have your samurai do whatever suits you.<br/><br/>Every time your GM asks you to make an honour roll they will award you one Will Coin regardless of the outcome of your roll.

It remains a popular DOS game creation systems. ZZT itself is not an acronym for anything; its title was simply chosen so it would always appear at the very bottom of newsgroup listings. However, it was later jokingly mentioned by Sweeney as being short for Zoo of Zero Tolerance, which has mistakenly become a popular belief.<br/><br/>ZZT's graphics were obsolete before it was even created; it used the same style of text-mode graphics that Kingdom of Kroz used 4 years earlier. However, ZZT managed to become fairly popular because of its integration of a simple but effective object-oriented scripting language known as ZZT-OOP. At the time this was groundbreaking, as most functionality in prior games had been hard-coded. The language allowed extensibility that no other game was able to provide, and allowed a large degree of community involvement that extended far beyond simply creating level terrain with the built-in editor, but rather involved writing programs to make the game run.<br/><br/>Originally ZZT was shareware, with only one of the four level-sets or &quot;worlds&quot; released without payment. The level released with the shareware copy is called Town of ZZT. The shareware versions also included Demo of ZZT, which displayed the basic features of ZZT worlds, and Tour of ZZT, which allowed the player to view select rooms (some playable) of the four worlds. Three different versions of shareware ZZT were released, with three corresponding registered ZZT versions. With about 30,000 registrations worldwide, ZZT was successful enough to finance the production of Jill of the Jungle, a game seen as Epic Megagames' answer to Apogee classics such as Duke Nukem. However when the game became obsolete it became freeware, with all four worlds of the registered version released for free. The worlds are: &quot;Town of ZZT&quot;, &quot;Caves of ZZT&quot;, &quot;Dungeons of ZZT&quot;, and &quot;City of ZZT&quot;; they can best be described as adventure games.<br/><br/>In the newsletters for the registered version of ZZT, it is apparent that Sweeney initially had not expected the editor to become the most popular feature of his game. Fans' letters to him quickly established this, and Sweeney responded by encouraging registered users to make their own worlds and submit them to him. The best material from these was released in The Best of ZZT.<br/><br/>Basic gameplay of ZZT is very simple. The player is controlled by the 4 cursor keys, and the shift key and a cursor key pressed will shoot a bullet (if the player has ammo). Items that can be picked up include: ammo (each magazine holds 5 rounds), gems (used for currency in most games), torches (used by pressing the T key in darkened rooms, lighting a small area around the player, that moves as the player does), and energizers that give the player temporary invincibility. Enemies include Lions (randomly moving monsters, that may follow the player), Tigers (randomly moving monsters that fire bullets), Ruffians (monsters that chase the player, then rest, then repeat), slimes, and spinning guns.<br/><br/>Third-party worlds for ZZT are diverse, ranging from shoot 'em ups to complex role playing games to a Lemmings clone (Zem). They range from the simple to the complex, from inane to brilliant. An aspects of the game is the culture that has built up within and around it: catch phrases, programming tricks, and even some rather remarkable internet personalities. Information about the community itself can be found at ZUltimate, the ZZT wiki. Many other games have been inspired by ZZT, such as MegaZeux and ZZT's sequel, Super ZZT, the latter being widely criticized for lacking an easily accessible editor function.<br/>Although it has been many years since Tim Sweeney first wrote ZZT, it still has a cult following. ZZT is still for sale through mail order, according to Sweeney in a Gamasutra interview.<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;Zzt&quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "82298": {"boardgamedesigner": {"33440": {"name": "Philip Jelley"}}, "poll": {}, "name": "Easter Week, Dublin 1916 1922", "playingtime": "300", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": {"2046": "Area Movement"}, "yearpublished": "0", "usersrated": "0", "boardgamefamily": {"11546": "Country: Ireland"}, "maxplayers": "2", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1445562_t.jpg", "average": "0", "statistics": {}, "boardgamepublisher": {"11015": {"name": "White Dog Games"}}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1445562.jpg", "boardgameversion": {"63908": "First edition"}, "maxplaytime": "300", "boardgamecategory": {"1102": {"name": "Civil War"}}, "age": "14", "minplaytime": "300", "description": "Who fears to speak of Easter Week?<br/>Who dares its fate deplore?<br/>The red gold flame of Eire's name,<br/>Confronts the world once more.<br/><br/>Easter Week is an area/impulse game depicting the Easter Rising in 1916 and the Battle of Dublin in 1922.

If a 2, 4, or 6 is played, the score is recorded and the 1st batsman continues play.  If a 1 or 3 is played, the score is recorded and the play moves to the 2nd batsman.  If a &quot;How&rsquo;s That&quot; card is played, the defensive player flip the top card from the &quot;active bowler&quot; pile (i.e., the pile designated as the bowler for the current over) and scores the result (i.e., run out, stumped, Not out, Leg-bye, etc.).  Batting cards are reshuffled every three overs; bowling cards are reshuffled every five overs.<br/><br/>The game flow and rules closely follows the real game of cricket -  an over consists of 6 bowled balls (cards) plus extras, batsman change sides after each over, 10 wickets taken constitute an inning, etc.  As with the real cricket, the goal of the game is to outscore your opponent over two innings.<br/><br/>(description based on text included in the rule book)<br/><br/>"}, "82304": {"statistics": {}, "name": "TOCA Race Driver 3", "videogamemode": {"2422": "Local Multiplayer"}, "videogameversion": {"63915": "North American Windows edition"}, "average": "5.83333", "videogameseries": {"6940": "TOCA Touring Car"}, "videogametheme": {"2456": "Driving"}, "usersrated": "3", "videogamegenre": {"2154": "Racing"}, "videogameplatform": {"4729": "Macintosh"}, "videogamehonor": {"30999": "2006 Spike Best Driving Game of the Year Nominee"}, "poll": {}, "description": "TOCA Race Driver 3 (also known as DTM Race Driver 3 in Germany and V8 Supercars 3 in Australia) is the third title of TOCA racing video game series, developed and published by Codemasters.

The suggested player roles are that of a GM, or game master to run the adventure, and a player to fill the role of Petulla Mary Caston, a literal 'Jane Bond' of her time, which is 1567. An additional player could represent the role of her love interest, her 'Bond Boy' as it were, William Swanwick Geddes, but this is optional.<br/><br/>The play of Thou Spy Hath Embrangled Me is highly focused, intending to represent a classic James Bond movie in 1500's terms, using actual historical research as its foundation. For this reason, the plot flow must remain highly structured, this is without question a plot 'on rails', from which only marginal deviation can be allowed. Far from being a handicap, this is deliberate, maintaining the focus on the subject matter and theme. The value of playing Thou Spy Hath Embrangled Me is not the freeform experience of an open-ended RPG, but is instead to slip into the skin of a specific person in a specific time and place, and to live the most important adventure of her life, and nothing less, and nothing more. In short it is to play a very specific role, as fully as possible. Like the holodeck of Star-Trek, or the body-snatching of Quantum Leap, the player is expected to become Petulla (and possibly William) and see a specific circumstance to a conclusion. However, this circumstance can have any number of outcomes.<br/><br/>If Petulla fails, then history will be disrupted, and Lord Henry will become king of England, England will become ruthlessly Catholic, a new Inquisition will begin, and Scotland will likely dominate the British Isles politically for centuries to come. More than this, hundreds of thousands of people will perish of the Ague, and London will almost certainly become a ghost town.<br/><br/>If Petulla wins, then history will be as we have known it, and will utterly fail to record the very first British Superspy.<br/><br/>Thou Spy Hath Embrangled Me is a specific one-shot, focused role-playing scenario, but with only a small bit of imagination, and adaptation of existing spy movies to time and place, the adventures of Petulla Mary Caston could conceivably continue.<br/><br/>The mechanics of the game are likewise focused to the genre and to immediate and simple action with a focus on narrative.

It was followed by an anime adaptation produced by Seven Arcs, which began broadcast in Japan on January 3, 2009.&quot;<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;White Album (visual novel)&quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "82329": {"statistics": {}, "name": "Contra Force", "videogamemode": {"2313": "Cooperative"}, "videogameversion": {"63965": "NA NES edition"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1102732.jpg", "videogameseries": {"4946": "Contra"}, "videogametheme": {"2508": "Military"}, "usersrated": "6", "average": "6.79167", "videogamegenre": {"2352": "Run-and-gun"}, "videogameplatform": {"4430": "NES"}, "poll": {}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1102732_t.jpg", "description": "Contra Force is a run-and-gun-style shoot-'em-up game released by Konami for the Nintendo Entertainment System in 1992 in North America only. It is a spin-off of the Contra series and the third game in the series released for the NES (following the home versions of the original Contra and Super C). In contrast to previous Contra titles, which featured sci-fi elements, Contra Force centers around a modern task force who must fight human terrorists instead. The game was originally scheduled to be released as an unrelated game in Japan titled Arc Hound\u200b (\u30a2\u30fc\u30af\u30cf\u30a6\u30f3\u30c9?) The Japanese version was canceled and instead Konami localized the game for an North American release as a Contra spinoff.<br/><br/>Contra Force begins with the player being asked to choose between one of four characters. In addition to Burns, the team's leader, the player can also choose between Iron, a heavy weapons expert; Smith, a sharpshooter; and Beans, an demolitions expert. Each character differ from each other not just in what weapons they wield, but also in their speed and jumping ability.<br/><br/>The game consists of five stages: the odd-numbered stages (1, 3, and 5) are played from the standard side-view perspective, while the even-numbered stages (2 and 4) are played from an overhead perspective (similar to the ones in Super Contra and Operation C). The objective is as simple as fighting as getting to the end of each stage, fighting every enemy who gets in the way, before confronting the boss awaiting at the end.<br/><br/>The controls are similar to previous Contra games. At the side-view stages the player can walk left or right, as well as crouch and jump, whereas in the top-view stages the player can move in eight directions (but cannot jump nor crouch). Shooting is possible at any of the eight directions depending on the context. Instead of the instant power-ups from previous Contra games, the player has a power selection meter similar to the Gradius series which shows what power-ups the player can obtain. The player must pick up briefcase-shaped power-ups, which are hidden within the destroyable environment of each stage, to move the cursor on the indicator by one increment. When the cursor is on the power-up the player wants to obtain, the player can confirm their selection with the select button. The items on the indicators includes a standard-issue pistol for every character, two character-specific weapons, a turbo fire power-up that increases the number of bullets on-screen, and a rolling attack that keeps the character invulnerable to enemy fire while in mid-air.<br/><br/>During gameplay, the player can pause the game and go to a sub-menu where they can change their current character. At the sub-menu, the player can assign another character to a second player or call forth a computer-controlled partner. The player can assign from one of six possible strategies to their partner ranging between defensive and offensive. The partner character will then appear for five seconds to assist the player before disappearing. When the partner is gone, the player can summon him again from the sub-menu. Each character has only three lives. If a single player loses all of their lives as one character, the game will end. The player can use the sub-menu to switch to another character that still has extra lives before that happens. In the 2-player mode, if one player loses all of their lives, they can be assigned another character, but the character that lost all of his lives will become unusable. Unlimited chances to continue are provided.<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;Contra Force&quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "82330": {"statistics": {}, "name": "Fenix (Volume 7, Issue 4 - Jul 2010)", "rpgproducer": {"34457": "Anders Gillbring"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic803325.jpg", "usersrated": "1", "average": "6", "rpgissue": {"7442": "Fenix"}, "rpg": {"310": "Call of Cthulhu (2nd - 6th Edition)"}, "rpgissueversion": {"63966": "Magazine"}, "poll": {}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic803325_t.jpg", "description": "RPG material in issue includes a full adventure for Mutant Underg&aring;ngens Arvtagare.

After sifting through a few in my muddled mind, I decided upon an idea that had occurred to me after reading a Wikipedia article about occultism.<br/><br/>Apparently, there's this kind of magic(k) called &quot;Chaos Magic,&quot; that works around the idea of paradigm shifting and such. The idea of a modern magic game suddenly seemed really cool. Of course, I quickly realized that stuff like Mage and Unknown Armies had already treaded this ground, but I thought I could do a good job and bring something different to the table. So here it is, Discord, my 24 hour game about modern mages and casting your way through life. Enjoy.<br/><br/>A Few Words on Style<br/><br/>Throughout this text, I try to keep the tone light, but within the realm of its material. Since this is a game about magic and mystical stuff, I wanted the text to sound kind of &quot;whoOoOOoO&quot; mysterious. More than likely, it will not quite have that effect, but I hope it remains legible.<br/><br/>What You Need<br/><br/>All you need to play are pencils, copies of the character sheets, and a bunch of six sided dice. You will probably need about 5 per person.<br/><br/>Nothing is True<br/><br/>...And everything is permitted. This paradox is the fundamental law of chaos magic. Everyday, everywhere, people are creating their own realities. In every corner, there is the stirring of magic, but most just cannot fathom it. They look at it, all the time, but they do not see it.<br/><br/>What does it mean to see? How can anything be permitted if nothing is true? Understanding comes with time and study. At the surface, it simply means that you can see and do anything you want, but nothing you do is absolutely true. There is no higher Truth, no one great force that governs all. There is only you, and your will.<br/><br/>There is more to it, however, than simple acceptance. Chaos magic is not about accepting, but about rejecting. First you reject the idea that anything is absolutely True, then you learn that anything can be true. Belief, faith, dogma, and ritual are all tools for the magician to wield. They are clothes that the mage wears to aid in creating er effects. The changing of belief systems, the &quot;paradigm shift&quot; is one of the primary rituals of chaos magic.<br/><br/>In this game, you take on the role of a magician. You can be a chaos magician, or you can stick to one paradigm, or something else entirely, whatever works for you. In the next few pages, the various things that make up a character will be discussed. But first, take a look at the character sheet at what a character is made from, then you can explore what the individual parts of each character are.<br/><br/>"}, "82349": {"statistics": {}, "name": "Vandal Hearts: Flames of Judgment", "videogamemode": {"2149": "Single-Player"}, "videogameversion": {"64005": "PlayStation 3 PSN edition"}, "average": "7", "videogameseries": {"7609": "Vandal Hearts"}, "videogametheme": {"2148": "Fantasy"}, "usersrated": "5", "videogamegenre": {"2414": "Tactical Role-Playing Game"}, "videogameplatform": {"4435": "PlayStation 3"}, "poll": {}, "description": "&quot;Vandal Hearts: Flames of Judgment is a turn-based tactical role-playing  video game for the PlayStation Network and Xbox Live Arcade  with a release date of January 20, 2010.<br/><br/>Flames of Judgment is a turn-based tactical role-playing  game, where players engage their band of warriors in turn-based combat on a three-dimensional isometric grid against an opposing force.

It was designed for use with NES' 3x4 dance mat, the Power Pad, making it the first in the rhythm game genre - a genre that would later explode into the mainstream gaming market at the tail end of the 1990s. Dance Aerobics was published in Japan by Bandai and in North America by Nintendo.<br/><br/>Gameplay<br/><br/>The Power Pad's 3x4 Side B (right) was used for all modes of Dance Aerobics.<br/><br/>Dance Aerobics features three distinct modes. In Normal Mode, the player begins with four different aerobics classes to chose from and by playing through the classes may unlock an additional 4. The player must follow the motions of the instructor by stepping on the appropriate buttons on the Power Pad as music plays. The player may also use his hands and in some more advanced levels and in different modes use of the hands is required. In Normal Mode mode, the score begins at 100 and decreases by 10 with each mistake, only going up for routines completed correctly. If the counter reaches zero then the player has failed the song. The games begin simply but as the player passes levels, new harder songs are unlocked and the difficulty increases.<br/><br/>In the Pad Antics Mode, three games are available. In Tune Up, the central two buttons of the Power Pad are de-activated (to allow the player to stand upon them) and the 10 pads surrounding the player are assigned different musical notes. The player can compose his own melody in a free form style by stepping on the appropriate pad to create the produce the tones he wishes to play. In Mat Melodies, the player stands on the center two pads and the game plays a short song to the player who then must repeat it back eidetically by hitting the appropriate pads in the same order. In Ditto, the game plays music and calls instructions about whether to use a hand or a foot to hit the appropriate pad in a Twister-like manner.<br/><br/>In Aerobics Mode, the 4 original songs from Normal Mode (Studio 5, Studio 10, Studio 15, and Studio 20) are all available and the scoring is the same except that when the counter reaches 0 the music continues and the player may continue to attempt to mimic the moves made by the instructor. There is no progression of levels and doing well in Aerobics Mode will not unlock any new content in this mode.<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;Dance Aerobics&quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "82352": {"statistics": {}, "name": "Vancouver 2010", "videogamemode": {"2422": "Local Multiplayer"}, "videogameversion": {"64015": "English/EU Playstation 3 Edition"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3520262.jpg", "videogametheme": {"2428": "Minigame Compilation"}, "usersrated": "3", "average": "5", "videogamegenre": {"2157": "Sports"}, "videogameplatform": {"4435": "PlayStation 3"}, "poll": {}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3520262_t.jpg", "description": "&quot;Vancouver 2010 is the official Olympic video game of the 2010 Winter Olympics held in Vancouver.<br/><br/>Many of the events in the real-world Olympics are playable.&quot;<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;Vancouver 2010 (video game)&quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "82353": {"statistics": {}, "name": "Metagame (Volume 5, Issue 3 - August 1992)", "average": "0", "usersrated": "0", "rpgissue": {"2887": "Metagame"}, "rpgissueversion": {"64018": "Velobound version"}, "poll": {}, "description": "From the Table of Contents:<br/><br/>&quot;My First Time&quot; by Mark C.

This version of EyePet was originally scheduled to be released in North America on 17 November 2009, but was held back. Instead, a newer version of EyePet adapted for the PlayStation Move motion control system is targeted for release in North America in &quot;Fall 2010,&quot; where it will be available in a bundle. In October 2010 the Move-adapted version will be released in Japan and Europe, with the European edition entitled EyePet Move Edition. The game will also support 3D on 3D enabled TVs. The PSP version of EyePet is scheduled for release in the fourth quarter of 2010 in Europe.<br/><br/>The game uses the camera to allow a virtual pet to interact with people and objects in the real world. Using augmented reality, the simian, gremlin-like creature appears to be aware of its environment and surroundings and reacts to them accordingly. The player can place objects in front of the animal and the game will interpret what the object is and respond to it. For example, if the player rolls a ball towards it, it will jump out of the way to avoid being hurt. It will also react to the player's actions and sound allowing the user to, for example, tickle the animal or clap their hands to startle it. A trailer shown at E3 2009 shows the pet being customised with outfits and coloured fur and interacting with virtual objects including a trampoline and bubble machine. The trailers also demonstrate users drawing custom objects (first trailer shows a car, E3 2009 trailer shows an airplane) which are scanned by the camera and converted to virtual objects which the pet can then interact with.<br/><br/>In a presentation at the Gamescom in Cologne the developers showed some aspects of the game. If the pet gets ill, the player can scan his animal, holding the card which will be coming out with the game itself.<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;EyePet&quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "82375": {"statistics": {}, "name": "Naughty Bear", "videogamemode": {"2310": "Network Multiplayer"}, "videogameversion": {"64106": "English/European PlayStation 3 edition"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1088072.jpg", "videogametheme": {"2471": "Animals"}, "usersrated": "7", "average": "6.36571", "videogamegenre": {"2147": "Action"}, "videogameplatform": {"4443": "iPhone"}, "poll": {}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1088072_t.jpg", "description": "Naughty Bear is a video game for the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 consoles.

Originally intended as a local area network interface for use in school classrooms, it was revised before launch to also act as the controller for up to eight ZX Microdrive high-speed tape-loop cartridge drives. It also included a DE-9 RS-232  interface capable of operating at up to 19.2 kbit/s - a rare instance of Sinclair using an industry-standard connector. At hardware level it was mainly a voltage adapter, the serial protocol being implemented in software by bit-banging. This led to problems when receiving data, but not when transmitting.<br/><br/>A wedge-shaped device fitting underneath the ZX Spectrum, ZX Interface 1 contained 8 kB of ROM comprising the control software for the Microdrives, RS-232 port and network interface. This extended the error handler in the Sinclair BASIC to allow extra keywords to be used. As this became an official standard, other developers quickly used this mechanism to create language extensions to Sinclair BASIC.<br/><br/>The device offered two network ports, allowing up to 64 ZX Spectrums to be daisy-chained using network leads up to 3 m (10 ft) long. The network, called ZX Net, used a proprietary CSMA-like protocol. Data could be sent or received at 100 kbit/s either to or from a numbered workstation, or broadcast to all nodes, allowing one machine to act as a server.<br/><br/>Two further revisions of the device's firmware were made following launch. These aimed to improve ZX Microdrive cartridge formatting and access time, printing functions via the RS-232 interface, and other bugs in the firmware held in device's internal 8K ROM. Machine code software which used the officially documented entry points ('hook codes') would experience few incompatibility issues, however programs using non-standard entry points risked incompatibility due to presence of revised entry points.<br/><br/>The same protocol, renamed QLAN, was later used on the Sinclair QL. This was intended to be interoperable with ZX Net, but due to timing differences interoperability was found to be problematic.<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;ZX Interface 1&quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "82391": {"statistics": {}, "name": "Lethal Weapon", "videogamemode": {"2149": "Single-Player"}, "videogameversion": {"64157": "Amiga Euro Squad version"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1293471.jpg", "videogametheme": {"2280": "Crime"}, "usersrated": "2", "average": "3.75", "videogamegenre": {"2147": "Action"}, "videogameplatform": {"4415": "Amiga"}, "poll": {}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1293471_t.jpg", "description": "From the back of the box:<br/><br/>You know what it's all about.

Seeing that it was good, he praised the angel who had contributed the most.<br/><br/>Genesis - In the Beginning gives you the chance to become that angel. By gathering the essence of creation - chaos, matter and life - and turning it into seas and mountains, birds and beasts, you hope to win Gods approval - and the game! But the way to victory is wrought with hard decisions. You must gather essence when it's most advantageous, move at the right time and do your days&rsquo; work where they count the most. And beware of the dark angel who's trying to outshine you all.<br/><br/>Now - let there be light!<br/><br/><br/>Contents<br/><br/>1 game board<br/>1 God<br/>1 dark angel<br/>6 player angels<br/>42 day work markers<br/>1 starting player marker<br/>72 essence cubes<br/>1 rules booklet<br/><br/><br/>Gameplay<br/><br/>Before the creation, the players&rsquo; angels are gathered in the void with God. When God starts the creation with the words &quot;let there be light&quot;, the angels start their monumental task. There&rsquo;s a lot do to and only seven days to get it done in, so every action counts. Throughout the game, God moves over each of the seven days on the game board, stopping morning, midday and evening, allowing the players 21 rounds to act. During their turn, players can choose to collect the essence of creation (chaos, matter and life), to do a day work on the current day using the different kinds of essence they have collected, or to follow in God&rsquo;s path to another day.<br/><br/>When players move from day to day, they&rsquo;re positioned along the essence track. The essence track determines both the order of play and the type of essence a player can gather. The first player to move to a certain day gets the first position, the second player the second position, and so on. As different positions yield different kinds of essence, the players must plan their movement to get the right kind and the right amount of essence. If they&rsquo;re not happy with their position, they can spend essence to swap positions with a neighboring angel, thereby also thwarting other players&rsquo; plans.<br/><br/>When God creates a new day with new tasks for the angels, players can move to that day. The first player to do a day work on a certain day is awarded the highest points, the second player the second highest, and so on. As the week progresses, the points earned for doing a day work increase, which affects players&rsquo; long-term strategy.<br/><br/>As the seventh day is a day of rest, God looks favorably on angels that retire from their hard work. The first player to retire their angel on the seventh day earns the highest points, the second player the second highest, and so on. When God reaches the evening of the seventh day, the game is over. All points will be tallied and the player with the highest score is declared the winner.<br/><br/>To make things even more challenging, a dark angel is mixed in with the players&rsquo; angels, doing his best to snatch as many points as possible. The dark angel follows a pre-determined pattern of actions that the players can predict and delay but never stop. If the players aren&rsquo;t careful, or if they&rsquo;re too caught up in their own plans, the dark angel will surely outshine them, making all of them lose the game.<br/><br/>The mechanics of the game are quite simple: the sooner you do a day work on a day, the higher the points you score, making it a good idea to keep close in God&rsquo;s wake. Unfortunately, simply following God throughout the creation might not give you the exact essence you need to do your day work. Eventually you must stop to collect essence, preferably in the right position, making you lose momentum. In the end it&rsquo;s always about choices: when and what to collect, when to move and when to do a day work. The winner, God willing, is the player who makes the right choices at the right time, a task easier said than done.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": {"64167": "First edition"}, "name": "Genesis", "playingtime": "60", "boardgamemechanic": {"2004": "Set Collection"}, "average": "5.79075", "usersrated": "268", "boardgamesubdomain": {"4666": "Abstract Games"}, "age": "10"}, "82398": {"statistics": {}, "name": "U-Boat: Battle in the Mediterranean", "videogamemode": {"2313": "Cooperative"}, "videogameversion": {"64168": "German Windows 2000/XP CD-ROM release"}, "average": "0", "videogameseries": {"5456": "Silent Hunter"}, "videogametheme": {"2542": "Ocean / Sea"}, "usersrated": "0", "videogameexpansion": {"75421": "Silent Hunter III"}, "videogamegenre": {"2156": "Simulation"}, "videogameplatform": {"4977": "Windows"}, "poll": {}, "description": "User Summary<br/><br/>U-Boat: Battle in the Mediterranean is an expansion for Silent Hunter III.

Because the boards are interlocking the map is easily placed back to the center of the table where the battle rages on!<br/><br/>The grid lines are permanently etched into the crisp white surface which makes drawing straight lines a breeze, because the marker tip falls into the groove and follows it as if you were using a ruler. This speeds up prep time considerably. The white surface allows for the use of any color of dry erase you can find, and makes for amazingly vivid maps.<br/><br/>Want to take your time and draw out a masterpiece for that final climatic encounter? No problem! And you don&rsquo;t have to waste valuable game time to do it. Just draw out the scene in vivid detail ahead of time and then stack the tiles together using small pieces of non slip drawer liner material available for cheap at any grocery store. The rubbery material will provide space between boards to protect your work of art, and since it is non slip, it keeps the stack from sliding around and erasing your masterpiece.<br/><br/>This same technique can also be used to create fog of war effects since only the boards that the players are exposed to need be placed on the table.<br/><br/>"}, "82407": {"rpgitemversion": {"64182": "PDF Version"}, "poll": {}, "name": "Force Majeure", "rpgproducer": {"13283": "Robin Elliott"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic803218.jpg", "usersrated": "1", "average": "6", "statistics": {}, "rpg": {"4702": "All for One: R\u00e9gime Diabolique"}, "rpgcategory": {"2084": "Scenario / Adventure / Module"}, "rpggenre": {"180": "Action / Adventure (Swashbuckling / Pirates)"}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic803218_t.jpg", "description": "Publisher Blurb:<br/>Stand Your Ground, the King Must be Defended!<br/><br/>Force Majeure is an adventure for All For One, and is meant to be played as an introductory mini-campaign for novice musketeers and their lackeys.<br/><br/>It may also be played using the sample musketeers found in the All For One rulebook.<br/><br/>Our heroic musketeers find themselves involved in a seemingly minor dispute between two noblemen; a situation that can be very lucrative, if not a little dangerous.<br/><br/>In the course of the adventure, the characters will discover that not everything is as it appears to be, and that a plot against the King lies at the heart of the matter.<br/><br/>Raise your swords and prepare to defend the King in Force Majeure, the first in a new line of swashbuckling adventures for All For One: R&eacute;gime Diabolique by Triple Ace Games for the award-winning Ubiquity RPG system.<br/><br/>"}, "82408": {"statistics": {}, "name": "Cadillacs and Dinosaurs", "videogamemode": {"2422": "Local Multiplayer"}, "videogameversion": {"64183": "Arcade Version"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic974904.jpg", "videogametheme": {"2427": "Alternate Historical"}, "usersrated": "9", "average": "6.42222", "videogamegenre": {"2314": "Arcade"}, "videogameplatform": {"4781": "Arcade"}, "poll": {}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic974904_t.jpg", "description": "Cadillacs and Dinosaurs\u200b (\u30ad\u30e3\u30c7\u30a3\u30e9\u30c3\u30af\u30b9 \u6050\u7adc\u65b0\u4e16\u7d00 Cadillacs Ky\u014dry\u016b Shin Seiki?) is a 1993 arcade game released by Capcom.

It is the fourth game in the Star Soldier  series and the last one for TurboGrafx-16. In it, players must fight back the Zeograd Army, aliens bent on conquering Earth, using the Soldier Blade fighter ship.<br/><br/>It is one of the games in the Star Soldier series that are available for the Nintendo Wii's Virtual Console, along with Star Soldier, Super Star Soldier, Final Soldier and Star Parodier. This particular game has also been re released on the PlayStation Network.<br/><br/>This game features 7 operations (stages) to play as well as a 2 minute and 5 minute challenge mode.<br/><br/>Story<br/><br/>It is the 21st century. The progress of science and civilization progress remarkably. However, the resources of Earth require more supplements as the global environment is slowly dying. The nations of Earth initiate the Star Light Plan which will search space for additional resources; a large Warp-Drive gate capable of sending multiple spaceships into other solar systems is developed for the project. The resource investigation fleet was equipped with six Security Corps and 5000 military and research personnel.<br/><br/>However, four months later, communication suddenly ceases between the investigation team and Earth. Three nights followed... and suddenly, the resource investigation team returns. However, their ships were severely damaged by an alien space military called the Zeograd Army. Earth&rsquo;s armies retaliate, but fail with every attempt and the Zeograd take control of Earth's Warp-Gate. Soon a lone scientist named John Howard develops a space fighter called the Soldier Blade V.92 based on his research on the Zeograd. The ship was bought out by the SIA (Special Interception Airforce) and was readied to combat the Zeograd Army.<br/><br/>Gameplay<br/><br/>Soldier Blade plays similarly to many Hudson Soft vertical scrolling Shooters: players control the title ship through seven stages, each one having a mid and end-level boss collecting power-ups as they progress. Like Super Star Soldier and Blazing Lazers, the Soldier Blade could take multiple enemy hits only depending on how many power-ups the player collected. Before every power-up collection the ship was vulnerable to one hit, but after collecting three power-ups, the ship could take three hits, each hit degrading the ship's weapon power by one level. The ship has three weapons to choose from as well as a single Option, a robot that provided additional firepower.<br/><br/>Soldier Blade's weapon system was unique in that every weapon the player would pick-up, the previous weapon would be stocked as a Special Weapon. The Special Weapon attack was different depending on the particular weapon. The Red Weapon Special would make the ship's robot temporarily invulnerable, the Green Weapon Special would send out a homing energy blast while the Blue Weapon Special unleashed an enormous laser beam. Collecting a Weapon pick-up of the same color once the weapon in-use was fully upgraded results in a large explosion that clears the screen of smaller enemies and attacks.<br/><br/>Players could earn Extends by amassing more points and the game has no Continue Option; once the player loses all their lives the game is over. Soldier Blade also offers a Score Attack Mode where players can select a two to five minute long game based entirely on earning a high score.<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;Soldier Blade&quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "82431": {"statistics": {}, "name": "TV Superstars", "videogamemode": {"2422": "Local Multiplayer"}, "videogameversion": {"64228": "European PlayStation 3 Edition"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3520164.jpg", "videogametheme": {"2466": "Other"}, "usersrated": "0", "average": "0", "videogamegenre": {"2338": "Party"}, "videogameplatform": {"4435": "PlayStation 3"}, "poll": {}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3520164_t.jpg", "description": "TV Superstars, is an upcoming 2010 party video game for the PlayStation 3, it will utilize the new PlayStation Move controllers.

It was released in Japan on December 15, 1986, and in North America in September of the following year. One of the earliest published titles for the NES in North America, Deadly Towers proved to be markedly unpopular, largely due to the high learning curve and high difficulty level when starting the game.<br/><br/>In Japan, Deadly Towers was titled Mash\u014d (\u9b54\u9418), literally meaning &quot;Evil Bell&quot;. It is a pun of the word mash\u014d (\u9b54\u6027), meaning &quot;devilishness&quot;, and in keeping with this theme, the Japanese cartridge contained a red LED at the top which illuminated when turned on[1]. Fittingly, the original title outside the Japanese market was to have been &quot;Hell's Bells,&quot; but according to the game's producer, Nintendo of America ordered the name changed.<br/><br/>Plot<br/><br/>On the moonlit eve of his coronation ceremony, pensive Prince Myer sits at the lakeside to ponder the future of the kingdom. Suddenly, a shadowy kami called Khan rises from the lake and coalesces into the form of a man.

Created by Eugene Jarvis, it is a sequel to the 1980 game Defender, and was the first of only three productions from Vid Kidz, an independent development house formed by Jarvis and Larry DeMar. This video game has no connection to the subsequent Stargate franchise that began 13 years later.<br/><br/>The game is also known as Defender Stargate and Defender II. The latter name was used in home video game releases, due to legal issues (according to the bonus material for Midway Arcade Treasures, Williams wanted to &quot;make sure they could own the trademark&quot; on the Defender name). The name Defender II has been used on all of its home ports, and game compilation appearances, however there were never any Defender II arcade units. To complicate matters, the Atari 2600 port was originally sold under the Stargate moniker but was renamed to Defender II for a later re-release.<br/><br/>Gameplay<br/><br/>The player flies a small spaceship above a long, mountainous landscape. The land is inhabited by a small number of humanoids. The landscape wraps around, so flying constantly in one direction will eventually bring the player back to their starting point. The players ship can fly through the landscape without being destroyed.<br/><br/>A number of enemy ships fly over the landscape. The player's responsibilities are twofold:<br/><br/>1. Destroy all aliens<br/>   2. Protect the humans from being captured<br/><br/>The player is armed with a beam-like weapon which can be fired rapidly in a long horizontal line ahead of the spaceship, and also has a limited supply of smart bombs, which can destroy every enemy on the screen. The player also has a limited supply of &quot;Inviso&quot; cloaking energy, which makes the ship invisible, and able to destroy any ships it comes in contact with.<br/><br/>At the top of the screen is a radar-like scanner, which displays the positions of all aliens and humans on the landscape.<br/><br/>Ports<br/>In July 2000, Midway licensed Defender II, along with other Williams Electronics games, to Shockwave for use in an online applet to demonstrate the power of the Shockwave web content platform, entitled Shockwave Arcade Collection. The conversion was created by Digital Eclipse. It is currently freely available to be played within the shockwave web applet.<br/><br/>It also should be noted that the music from Punchout (1987) for the Famicom and Nintendo Entertainment System, borrowed some music and sound effects from the 1983 Famicom version of Stargate (later released as Defender II in 1988 by Hal for the Nintendo Entertainment System). For example, the music played when the game begins is a longer version of the entrance music of the Little Mac's opponents. Also, after completing a stage, during the intermission screen between waves, the music played is the same as the screen after Mac loses a match.<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;Defender II&quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "82449": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1165309.jpg", "poll": {}, "boardgamedesigner": {"40740": {"name": "David Haslam"}}, "statistics": {}, "yearpublished": "2010", "maxplayers": "4", "boardgameartist": {"40755": "Kevin Keele"}, "boardgamepublisher": {"9552": {"name": "Mayday Games"}}, "maxplaytime": "45", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1165309_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "45", "boardgamecategory": {"1002": {"name": "Card Game"}}, "boardgamehonor": {"24399": "2009 Ion Award Best Game Winner"}, "description": "The King intends to appoint a new Master for his vineyard and wishes to discover which apprentice has the cleverest way with grapes.

The levels are similar to older side-scrolling games, with Ben needing to defeat all the enemies onscreen before he is able to advance. Along the way the player will see famous US landmarks including the Grand Canyon and Mt.

It was written by Julian Gollop and originally published by Games Workshop.<br/><br/>Chaos was written by Julian Gollop, based on his designs for a traditional card game.  The Chaos card game was in turn inspired by the early Games Workshop board game Warlock.  He was an avid card game designer but then saw computers as a way of hiding game rules too complicated for pen-and-paper scenarios.  Thus the board used in the card game became the tiled map in the video game.<br/> <br/>Gameplay<br/><br/>In Chaos, players take the role of wizards who vie with one another to win the game.  The aim of the game is to be the 'last wizard standing' by destroying all other wizards.  The game allows for anything between two and eight wizards, any of whom can be human or computer controlled.  The level of the computer controlled wizards must be selected, ranging from 1 to 8.  Higher levels improve the computer wizards' combat statistics, but does not improve their artificial intelligence.  Computer controlled wizards do not cooperate; they will attempt to kill each other as well as the human players.<br/><br/>Chaos is a turn-based game.  Each turn, every player in order selects and casts a spell, then moves their wizard and any summoned creatures.<br/> <br/>Spells<br/><br/>Each wizard is given a random selection of spells at the start of the game with which to defeat the other wizards.  Spells are either Lawful, Neutral, or Chaotic, and have a difficulty value expressed as a percentage chance of success when cast.  A spell can only be cast once, with the exception of the &quot;Disbelieve&quot; spell which is always available to every wizard.  New spells can only be acquired via the &quot;Magic Wood&quot; spell.<br/><br/>During the game, the type of spells cast affects the subsequent difficulty of other spells.  Casting many lawful spells results in a more lawful environment, which in turn makes other lawful spells easier to cast.  The same principle applies to chaotic spells.  Spells of the opposite alignment are not more difficult to cast however.  Neutral spells are unaffected either way, and are always cast at the same difficulty percentage.  This feature has a big impact on the strategy of the game, as a viable tactic is to cast lots of easy spells of a certain alignment, in order to make it easier to cast the more powerful spells of that alignment.<br/><br/>Spells fall into various categories and have various ranges.<br/><br/>Creature spells summon a monster adjacent to the wizard, which can then be moved in the movement phase.  These include standard units such as goblins, lions and giant rats; undead creatures which can only be attacked by other undead creatures or magic weapons, such as ghosts, spectres and zombies; flying creatures such as bats, dragons and manticores; mountable creatures which can be ridden by their wizard, such as horses, centaurs and unicorns; some creatures may have a ranged attack, such as the elf's and centaur's bow and the dragon's breath.<br/><br/>Some creatures are harder to cast than others, with the more powerful creatures having a lower base percentage chance to cast.  Creatures can be cast as an &quot;Illusion&quot;, with a 100% chance of being cast, with the disadvantage that they can be destroyed if another wizard casts a &quot;Disbelieve&quot; spell at them.<br/><br/>Creatures have attack and defense ratings which govern how effective they are, move ratings which control how many squares they can move a turn, maneuver ratings which govern how easily a creature can break off combat and magic resistance for governing defence against magical assaults.  Flying creatures movement ratings govern how many square they can fly.  Wizards also have these ratings, as well as a magic rating governing how many spells they initially have.<br/><br/>Several spells create objects on the board.  &quot;Magic Wood&quot; creates eight trees which any wizard may enter for protection and a chance to gain a new spell.  &quot;Shadow Wood&quot; creates eight trees which may attack adjacent enemies.  &quot;Gooey Blob&quot; and &quot;Magic Fire&quot; spread over the course of the game, engulfing enemy creatures.  &quot;Wall&quot; creates four obstructing blocks, whilst &quot;Dark Citadel&quot; and &quot;Magic Castle&quot; may be entered by the wizard for protection.<br/><br/>A player may also receive spells that improve his wizard, such as &quot;Magic Sword&quot; or &quot;Shadow Form&quot;, or spells that directly attack other creatures, such as &quot;Magic Bolt&quot; or &quot;Vengeance&quot;.<br/> Other miscellaneous spells include those that change the global law or chaos level, raise dead creatures to undead status, subvert an enemies creature.  One rare spell, &quot;Turmoil&quot;, moves all creatures and objects on the board to a random location.  The rarity of this spell was due to a bug that caused it to appear only once every 64 games; however, in Julian Gollop's words: &quot;...that's probably a good thing.&quot;<br/> <br/>Turn sequence<br/><br/>Each (human) wizard takes it in turn to view the board (if desired), examine their spells and select one to cast on the next turn (selecting a spell is not compulsory).  Typically, the other human players look away during spell choice to avoid unfair advantage.  Once all players have chosen their spell, they attempt to cast them in order.<br/><br/>Whereas the human players select their spells before each turn begins, the computer wizards actually select their spells during the play stage of each turn.  This is not documented, although it becomes apparent in play, as the computer wizards often cast spells that would have required foreknowledge of the other players' actions.  For example, a computer wizard might cast a 'disbelieve' spell immediately after a human player has conjured a powerful creature, or the computer might fire a 'Magic Bolt' at a player-summoned creature when no targets were in range beforehand.<br/><br/>Once all spells have been cast, surviving wizards take it in turns to move themselves and any creatures under their control (unless they are 'engaged'), and attack other wizards/creatures.<br/> <br/>Combat<br/><br/>Other creatures or wizards are attacked by either moving into them, or flying onto them.  Moving or flying next to an enemy creature automatically 'engages' them, and allows for an immediate attack.  If an attack is successful the enemy creature disappears/dies and the attacking creature moves onto its square.  Flying onto a creature allows an attack, but the flying creature remains in place unless it succeeds in killing its target, in which case it takes its place as above.  Only defending creatures can be killed, attacking creatures are safe until attacked themselves.<br/><br/>Success depends on the attacking creature's combat rating vs. the defending creature's defense rating and a certain amount of randomness.  Some creatures have ranged combat, allowing them to attack other creatures from afar, so long as there is a clear line of sight.  An undead creature can only be attacked by other undead creatures (or magic weapon equipped wizards), but can attack both undead and non-undead creatures itself.<br/><br/>Creatures with ranged attacks may fire, after movement and close combat, at any creature in range.<br/><br/>Once all wizards have taken it in turn to move and fight, the turn sequence starts over from the beginning.  For human players, no actions are compulsory, they may simply skip any actions they do not want to take.  Computer controlled wizards will always move, unless in a Magic Wood, Castle or Citadel, even when it is not in their best interest to do so.  Likewise all computer controlled creatures always attempt to move each turn.<br/><br/>If a wizard is destroyed, all his creations immediately vanish also.<br/> <br/>Critical reaction<br/><br/>CRASH awarded Chaos 8 out of 10 in issue 16, praising neatness of presentation, efficient sound effects, pleasing sprites and concluding that it was a very good multiplayer strategy game.  Criticisms included the sparseness of the initial playing area, lack of status report for the wizards and information on how much damage was being dealt.  The reviewer also felt there could have been a wider range of missile attack spells. Sinclair User rated Chaos 4 out of 5 stars, calling it &quot;fast-moving and colourful&quot; with simple, functional graphics.  It was seen to be complex enough to appeal to players of both Dungeons &amp; Dragons and strategy games.  White Dwarf awarded 7 out of 10, finding particular fun in the spells &quot;Magic Fire&quot; and &quot;Gooey Blob&quot; but criticising the poor quality of the instruction booklet.<br/> In the final issue of Your Sinclair (issue 93, September 1993), Chaos was listed at position 5 of the Your Sinclair Readers' Top 100 Games Of All Time.  The same issue featured a Chaos play-off between various staff members and contributors: Rich Pelley, Steve Anderson, Craig Broadbent, Chris Buxton, Jonathan Nash (then editor), Jonathan Davies, Jeff Braine and Steph (an inflatable shark, filling in for an absent Stuart Campbell).<br/> The September 2006 issue of GamesTM magazine listed Chaos at position 44 of the top 100 games of all time. This made it the second highest rated Spectrum game, behind Manic Miner.<br/> <br/>Influence<br/><br/>The developers of award-winning indie PC strategy game Darwinia cite Chaos as an influence during its early development.
