It is the first in the series to cover the Infantry Regiment Grossdeutschland in World War II.<br/><br/>The German breakthrough at Sedan opened the way for Guderian&rsquo;s dash to the English Channel. What is not commonly known is that this advance proceeded at a pace which the German General Staff thought to be too aggressive, if not rash. It is not an understatement to say that had the French significantly threatened the Sedan bridgehead, the 1940 campaign could have developed quite differently. The French lost their best opportunity to do just that at the village of Stonne. In GD&rsquo;40, players have the chance to change history. A successful French player may cause OKW to put the brakes on Guderian&rsquo;s advance, which could give the French army time to react to the surprise German blow at Sedan. Failure will allow history to take its course&mdash;one of the most decisive victories of modern time. GD&rsquo;40 is the first in a series of TCS games which will portray the Grossdeutschland throughout the war&mdash;from an infantry regiment in 1940 to a Panzer Corps in 1945.

Further south, Guderian&rsquo;s Second Panzer Group captured Orel on 3 October without fighting and pushed on to the Zusha River. While Mtzensk fell on 10 October, further advances would have to wait until the pocketed Russians could be eliminated. The Russian 4th Tank and 201st Parachute Brigades had been fighting rear guard actions as the Germans advanced beyond Orel. Mtzensk&rsquo;s defense fell under the newly formed 26th Army composed of the 6th Guard Rifle  Division, 4th and 11th Tank Brigades, 41st Cavalry Division, and the 5th Parachute Corps (three Parachute Brigades). The German drive on Tula resumed on 22 October in spite of the terrible German<br/>supply situation.

However, ties end that month's play (players draw fresh supply points each month, and the game ends after 20 months).<br/><br/>Second significant mechanic is the use of (limited) supply points to activate stacks of units when it's your turn. Like games such as We the People/Hannibal: Rome vs. Carthage/Rommel in the Desert/Napoleon, you don't have the resources to activate all of your units each turn, you need to decide what the current priority is in line with the current situation. Activation generally allows you to either move stacks or attack with stacks, but with an increased expenditure of supply points, you can take more powerful 'breakthrough' turns involving both movement and attack.<br/><br/>These mechanics (unpredictable turn order, limited ability to activate units each turn) create a game of fluid tactical situations, where your planning has to be flexible - you never know who will get the next turn.<br/><br/>The Allied player has to break out of the beach head and capture additional supply ports (which raise the number of supply points available to the Allies, and hence the number of activations possible) en route to Germany. The German player must contain the Allies in Normandy for as long as possible before falling back to the Rhine, while also denying the valuable supply ports to the Allies as long as possible. The Allies are up against a tight timetable; the Germans must work against as increasing disadvantage in supply points.<br/><br/>Victory is generally determined by the difference in numbers between German units West of the Rhine and Allied units East of the Rhine at game end. Allied paratroops, the German Bulge offensive, reinforcements/replacements and strategic movement add to the game.

Each player is assigned one of the four categories of businesses, each of which sells goods or services costing 100, 200, 300 or 400 $.  Each player starts with 1000 $.  First player to amass 100 Consumer points wins.<br/><br/>On your turn, you roll a die.  If it is 1-4, you go visit the corresponding dealer.  If you rolled yourself, you pick one of the three others.  If you rolled 5-6, you draw a Consumer card and then go visit a dealer of your choice.  The Consumer cards give small Consumer Point bonuses or penalties, or small cash awards (up to 500 $).  At the beginning of each round, all players receive 100 $ each.<br/><br/>Each dealer has six cards, one Catch card, two Rip-Off cards and three Good Deal cards.  They are spread in front of him, face down, in any order of the dealer's choice.  The consumer then decides how much he will spend (100-400 $) and forks the money over to the vendor.  The dealer then rolls a die and picks up the corresponding card (left to right) from his spread; next, he chooses one of the five remaining cards.  Finally, he picks up the card corresponding to the amount spent (100 $ - first card, and so on up to 400 $ - fourth card).  Thus the dealer has limited control over what choice to offer to the consumer.<br/><br/>The consumer then draws one of the three cards proferred by the dealer (still face down).  If a Good Deal, he receives 10-40 Consumer points.  If a Catch, he receives half as much.  If a Rip-Off, he *loses* 10 Consumer points but has the option of suing.<br/><br/>To sue, pay 500 $ to the Bank, then dice off against the vendor.  If the consumer rolls lower, he lost the suit.  If he tied or bested the vendor, he is awarded compensation depending on the margin of success.  The least result is that he recovers the lost 10 CPs and is refunded the court costs by the vendor.  The vendor may be forced to pay such a large penalty that he goes into debt.  If your debt gets larger than 1000 $, you are  bankrupt and out of the game.  Whilst in debt, you cannot buy when your turn comes, but instead just draw a Consumer card.

Unfortunately, they have no real idea of how these modern sports were played, besides what they can guess from old photographs and what they know about the sports of their day. If all future sports use multiple balls, surely so did the sports of the twentieth century, right?

The sport is played on the streets and overseen by flying robot referees, and it's played by the weirdest assortment of folks you're likely to see in a game.<br/><br/>Basically, Fightball is like basketball. Players build a &quot;court&quot; out of 24 cards and play four rounds. The play is fast and furious, with each player playing as fast as he can. When one player reaches the &quot;BUZZ&quot; card (at the bottom of the deck) the round is over. Now, players score each location on the court, looking for a sequence of cards starting with a player, then a ball, then a shot. Other cards, like blockers, can affect the quality of the shot. Some shots succeed, and are worth points. Others fail, and are worth nothing. The highest score at the end of four rounds wins the game!<br/><br/>Fightball was released as three sets of double decks, and any two decks can be played against one another.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": {"33044": "English first edition (Aztecs vs. The Dark)"}, "age": "12", "name": "Fightball", "playingtime": "20", "boardgamemechanic": {"2048": "Pattern Building"}, "average": "5.8764", "usersrated": "214", "boardgamefamily": {"6924": "Sci-Fi Sports"}}, "4353": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic69066.jpg", "poll": {}, "boardgamedesigner": {"498": {"name": "Greg Costikyan"}}, "statistics": {}, "yearpublished": "1979", "maxplayers": "2", "boardgameartist": {"22502": "Rick Bryant"}, "boardgamepublisher": {"120": {"name": "SPI (Simulations Publications, Inc.)"}}, "maxplaytime": "120", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic69066_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "120", "boardgamecategory": {"1120": {"name": "Print & Play"}}, "description": "Two-player SF wargame positing a space war in the &quot;Gilgamesh Cluster&quot; between the &quot;humano-cetacean civilization&quot; and the &quot;Xandri-Bratcom Coalition.&quot; The war is fought with modular Vector 3 ships that can carry an assortment of pods: lasers, torpedo launchers, defensive-screen generators, and tractor/pressor beams.

The frightfully fearsome feudal lord Fieso has held the fascinating fairy Fabula in captivity since the famous February festivities. In order to free the fairy must you redeem her from the Fieso's fetid and fusty feculent fetter. Frustrated you flee into the Finnish fjords in order to fetch a few of the fascinating fetishes so highly favored by the foul prince. Frantically you begin bartering with the local folks: a few Florins will get you some Fish which can be traded for Flowers, which again can be traded for Fur, Fruits, Flutes, Fettucine, Furniture, Fuel, Fiddles or maybe even a fridge. When your finances allow you to obtain 3 different fetishes you have won the game.<br/><br/>In Fische Fluppen Frikadellen, players are traders running (or sailing on a raft!) around a town, visiting various market stalls in order to buy, sell, or trade goods.  There are three different types of stalls in the game.  Merchants will sell you a specific good of the 5 base goods in the game according to current market prices, and will also buy a specific good from you, also according to market prices.  Traders will accept a specific good and give you two of a specific good in return.  Finally, there are dealer stalls which offer fetishes.  They each want specific combinations of goods, offering you a fetish in return.  There are three different fetishes in the game, and the first player to trade for all three fetishes wins!<br/><br/>Furthermore, whenever a player visits a market stall, a special ability of that stall activates.  These special abilities cause all sorts of game events, such as production of goods at merchants (you can't buy a good at a merchant if he doesn't have any available), price increases of goods, getting an extra turn or free commodity, changing the position of two merchants, etc.  Often times, players will need to utilize these special abilities to conquer their goals.<br/><br/>The really unique feature of Fische Fluppen Frikadellen is that there are three different versions of the game, so it can be played by up to 15 people on three different, interconnected tables!  You'll need one copy of the game for every 5 players.<br/><br/>At the start of a 15-player game, for example, there will be three boards, with 5 players at each board.  Each board is set up individually by the players starting there, and there are 36 merchants in the game with only 12 of them used per board, so it is very possible for each board to be significantly different than the others!  Furthermore, there will only be one of the three fetishes available at each board, so players will need to sail off to all three boards over the course of the game in order to win!  This means picking up all of your things and moving to a different table.<br/><br/>You aren't allowed to peek at the other tables before you move, which means it is a complete surprise what the market conditions and various stalls will be on the board that you move to.  This mechanic also means that there will not always be an equal amount of players at each board throughout the game, so players at boards with less players will likely get turns more frequently than players at boards with more players; another reason to leave your current board for a different one!<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": {"24846": "Version A"}, "name": "Fische Fluppen Frikadellen", "playingtime": "90", "boardgamemechanic": {"2007": "Pick-up and Deliver"}, "age": "10", "usersrated": "927", "boardgamesubdomain": {"5497": "Strategy Games"}, "average": "6.61486"}, "4371": {"boardgamedesigner": {"1127": {"name": "Jim Dietz"}}, "poll": {}, "name": "Last Man Standing", "playingtime": "120", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": {"2001": "Action Point Allowance System"}, "yearpublished": "1999", "usersrated": "26", "maxplayers": "8", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic27640_t.jpg", "average": "4.57308", "statistics": {}, "boardgamepublisher": {"206": {"name": "Jolly Roger Games"}}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic27640.jpg", "maxplaytime": "120", "boardgamecategory": {"1046": {"name": "Fighting"}}, "age": "12", "minplaytime": "120", "description": "Each player chooses one of eight characters that spoof popular spy/action-movie characters or actors: James Blonde, Emma Shell, Austin Flowers, Indiana Smith, Jackie Chang, Dirty Larry, Shift, or Arnold Weissenmeiner.

Unique aspects of the game include its method of capture (either approaching or withdrawing your piece from a line of enemy pieces), and the &quot;vela partie&quot; (debt game) after winning a decisive game (the winner must let the loser &quot;eat&quot; one man each turn for 17 consecutive moves). Because of the density of the board (only one open spot at the games beginning) and the unique method of capture, strategy is complex and enigmatic, with fewer pieces often beating more pieces.

This collection brings together three of the finest, covering three very different aspects of the Roman Empire: Hannibal versus Rome, Imperium and Circus Maximus.<br/><br/>Hannibal versus Rome is a 30-minute two-player game depicing the initial struggle for supremacy between Rome and Carthage, which finally established Rome as the leading power in the Mediterranean. It draws on the events of the Second Punic War, during which Hannibal crossed the Alps with his elephants, and defeated Rome in the battle of Cannae. The Roman general Scipio succeeded in moving the fighting away from Italy, into Spain and Africa, where he defeated the Carthaginians at Zama.<br/><br/>The map covers the Western Mediterranean. Players move Legions and Fleets, deciding conflicts by the use of cards in order to determine who will be the dominant power in the Mediterranean region.<br/><br/>Imperium (a game for two to five players) focuses on Rome's political and territorial expansion during the Imperial period. Powerful families controlled the individual provinces in order to increase their wealth and power in Rome, until the Roman Empire reached its zenith in size in the year 100 under the Emperor Trajan.<br/><br/>In each round the two to five players distribute markers onto areas of the Empire, with control of one area being decided each round. The players need to have the right influence at the decisive moment to take control, without neglecting long-term development. It is a game of planning and timing.<br/><br/>Circus Maximus leads us into the heart of Rome itself with its renowned public entertainment for the masses; chariot racing.<br/><br/>Chariot races were immensely popular in Rome. The Circus Maximus offered room for 200,000 spectators who avidly followed the races, roaring and cheering on their favourites. The courageous charioteers were divided into teams distinguished by different colours. The most successful were worshipped as heroes, but the risks were high and many paid for their fame and daring with their lives.<br/><br/>Each of two to five players controls a team of three chariots. In a game of pure tactics, players receive five movement cards that they can assign each turn to individual chariots as they wish.
