Trial of Strength is a strategic level board wargame set in the Eastern Front of WWII, originally published by Panther Games in 1985.  A new second edition is being published by Lock 'n Load Publishing, LLC.<br/><br/>Trial of Strength is a turn-based board wargame that puts the players in the shoes of armed forces commanders who must determine objectives, allocate forces and execute operations designed to achieve victory over your opponent.  The battlefield the game is played on is a hexagon-style 1:4,000,000 scale map of Eastern Europe with each hex represents 72 kilometres (45 miles) from side to side.  Each turn represents approximately 10 days, with 3 turns per month. Units are generally corps of the Axis and armies for the Soviet Union, both about 60,000 troops each, while also consisting of smaller battle groups of specialist formations.<br/><br/>Trial of Strength heart comes from it's novel and sophisticated integrated movement and combat system called CLIMACS, units conduct combat during the movement phase by expending movement points.  The game is played at Corps / Army scale. There isn't a combat phase in Trial of Strength.  All combat is done somewhat like overruns in the operations phase. A unit in range of a HQ  can roll for initiative to react when a combat is declared. Each HQ gets to do this once during the opponent's turn.<br/><br/>The air and naval aspect of the game is easy.  There are Armor effects in combat and rules to allow more than one stack at a time to combine their movement. When Armor effects are used the Tanks must take the first loss if any (you will see the way those Panzers get worn down in Barbarossa). Losses are by step with possible retreats and even morale rolls to hold your ground and take more losses instead of retreating.  There is also limited intelligence with many units off the map (Army / Front markers).

All players are working in a junk yard where a teasing monkey has appeared. Your job is to climb up to the monkey and spank it.<br/><br/>There are 5 types of cards in the game. Junk cards, like the totem pole, surfboard, and garden gnome, are used to pile on top of each other and form the &quot;board&quot; in front of each player. Each junk card has its own height, strength, and often a special ability when played. The combined height of your junk cards is used to see if you have reached the monkey. Some junk cards are a bit fragile, but they can be strengthened by reinforcement cards like duct tape, ivy, and a hired security guard. Each junk card also belongs to at least one category of which there are 7 in the game.<br/><br/>During the game, you attack the junk card of other players in an attempt to make them fall down, or at least lower them a bit. There are three kind of attacks; throwing attacks (bowling ball, flock of seagulls, and dynamite) that you can use on any junk card, hand attacks (chainsaw, blind, and crowbar) that you can only use on cards at the same height as yourself, and the sneak attacks (lawyer, wasp&rsquo;s nest, and ball cannon) that all have special abilities.<br/><br/>A die roll is used to solve the attack. You add the attack value of your attack card and compare it to the combined strength of the attacked junk card and any reinforcement cards it might have. The defending player may play defense cards that either lower the die roll (umbrella, satellite dish, and wok) or completely stop or redirect the attack (electric force field, tennis racket, and trampoline).<br/><br/>If a junk card is destroyed, you have effectively lowered that player's height by the height of the card, and if there are junk cards above the destroyed card, they fall down, and the defender is forced to make a collision roll to see if the junk cards also are destroyed.<br/><br/>The fifth card type is called special, and it is a kind of catchall for all the crazy special effect you may do in the game.

Clockwise, players are first obliged to move the figure representing Alexandros across a triangular grid. They do this by playing cards with symbols matching those on destination spots. This is the core concept of the game - when the figure of Alexandros is moved, it leaves a trail of borders behind it. Soon, these borders begin to form provinces composed of triangular spaces: either with symbols or empty.<br/><br/>After moving Alexandros, players either build their hand of cards by drawing them, take over provinces or trigger scorings if the situation on the board suits them.<br/><br/>Players can occupy provinces by playing cards from their hand and placing tokens representing their leaders on spaces with corresponding symbols. When a scoring is triggered, provinces earn points equal to the number of empty spaces in them. Players can take over empty provinces and/or those occupied by other players. Each player has only four generals and placing them costs valuable cards - the game requires careful hand management and point-to-point movement - to create worthy provinces for scoring.<br/><br/>Awarded title of &quot;Best Family Strategy Game&quot; by Games Magazine in 2005.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": {"29505": "Rio Grande English/Italian Edition"}, "average": "6.18961", "name": "Alexandros", "playingtime": "45", "boardgamemechanic": {"2043": "Area Enclosure"}, "age": "12", "usersrated": "852", "boardgamesubdomain": {"5497": "Strategy Games"}, "boardgamefamily": {"10640": "Country: Greece"}}, "8274": {"boardgamedesigner": {"41816": {"name": "Hiroshi Kawase"}}, "poll": {}, "name": "Combat Wings", "playingtime": "180", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": {"2026": "Hex-and-Counter"}, "yearpublished": "1986", "usersrated": "1", "boardgamesubdomain": {"4664": "Wargames"}, "maxplayers": "2", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic34992_t.jpg", "average": "6", "statistics": {}, "boardgamepublisher": {"1034": {"name": "Tsukuda Hobby / Original"}}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic34992.jpg", "maxplaytime": "180", "boardgamecategory": {"2650": {"name": "Aviation / Flight"}}, "age": "12", "minplaytime": "180", "description": "The Game of Eighth Air Force Bombing Target in Germany.<br/><br/>A historical board wargame dealing with the strategic bombing campaign against Germany in the latter stages of World War II.

To make progress in the game you must form a coalition with at least one other player, but to actually win requires betraying your coalition.  It is said that 'The four authors still occasionally talk to each other' and the initial tests of the game resulted in married couples going home from parties in separate cabs.<br/><br/>The objective is to be the last player with a stockpile of chips.  (Each player starts with seven of a unique color.) Each play reduces your stockpile by one chip, and it is replenished through captures or gifts from other players. Players have some measure of control over who plays next, but captures either benefit another player or require that another player chooses to let you make a capture.<br/><br/>Players may form any non-binding agreements provided that all discussion is done at the table.  Working together allows players to capture chips and force other players out of the game.  In the end, one player must betray their coalitions to win.<br/><br/>The authors are also responsible for inventing the dollar auction and a great deal of economic theory.<br/><br/>"}, "8305": {"boardgamedesigner": {"890": {"name": "David F.

The strongest cards (Strength from 10 to 6) have a Fame score of 11, 10, 4, 3 and 2 points.<br/><br/>The classical version is played in four, with the persons sitting in front of each other forming a team (but in the booklet there are variants for different numbers of players).<br/><br/>Before the game begins, one of the four players shuffles the deck and places it in front of the player to his left who must &quot;cut&quot; it. The dealer then distributes three cards to each of the four players (either singly or all three at once), in a counterclockwise rotation, beginning with the player on his immediate right.<br/><br/>He then uncovers the thirteenth card and places it prominently in the center of the table. This card, regardless of its rank, identifies the Elemental plane on which the Tournament takes place: the Dominating one. The remaining cards are usually placed, face down, as a stack on top of the Dominating card, but not obscuring it.<br/><br/>The game begins with the player to the dealer's immediate right, and goes around the table until the dealer has played last. Each round of four cards played constitutes a round of tournament. The winner of each rounf gathers all four cards and places them, face down, on his side of the table<br/><br/>The winner of each hand is determined by the Strength and the Element of the cards. The winner is the player that dropped the strongest card of the Element that has been played first on that round; but if somebody played a card of the Dominating element, the winner is the strongest of that element.<br/><br/>The winner of each round then draws one card from the deck. Then the others also draw one card, in sequence. Play continues until all the cards have been played.<br/><br/>At the end of the game the total number of Fame points is added up for each team. As there are 30 points for each Element, the maximum number of points is 120. The winner of the game is the team which scores 61 or more points.

To a limited extent combat losses can be converted into retreats and enemy retreats can occasionally result in an additional advance for the attacker.  Occasionally, extreme die rolls allow additional spontaneous activities.  ZoCs are hard except friendly units allow tracing supply through them.  Loss of supply reduces unit effectiveness and can result in attrition.  Victory is determined mostly by units losses but also the Soviet control of objective cities and the presence of even one friendly unit on the other players side of the Donets river provides a healthy number of VPs.  Both players begin with units in this position and so cancel each other out.<br/><br/>All in all it is a tense game.  The Russian player with the benefit of hindsight can avoid many of the hazards of the original campaign by not over extending himself.<br/><br/>Republished in Command Magazine Japan #56.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "1", "boardgameversion": {"32475": "Command Magazine Japan version"}, "average": "6.87176", "name": "Turning the Tables", "playingtime": "180", "boardgamemechanic": {"2057": "Chit-Pull System"}, "age": "0", "usersrated": "51", "boardgamesubdomain": {"4664": "Wargames"}, "boardgamefamily": {"10643": "Country: Germany"}}, "8353": {"boardgamedesigner": {"1253": {"name": "John Desch"}}, "boardgamesubdomain": {"4664": "Wargames"}, "poll": {}, "name": "Triumphant Return: The Soviet Liberation of Kiev, November 1943", "playingtime": "240", "minplayers": "1", "boardgamemechanic": {"2026": "Hex-and-Counter"}, "yearpublished": "1998", "usersrated": "33", "boardgamefamily": {"27513": "Cities: Kiev"}, "maxplayers": "2", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic122009_t.jpg", "average": "7.13091", "statistics": {}, "boardgamepublisher": {"539": {"name": "Moments in History"}}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic122009.jpg", "maxplaytime": "240", "boardgamecategory": {"1019": {"name": "Wargame"}}, "age": "12", "minplaytime": "240", "description": "Triumphant Return: The Soviet Liberation of Kiev, November 1943, is an operational level simulation of the battle for Kiev that took place during November and December 1943.<br/><br/>The successful offensive of early autumn 1943 found the Soviets with several bridgeheads over the Dnepr River.

The game covers the entire war from December 1941 through 1946 and includes the forces of all participants. Players are placed in the positions of the commanders of the Japanese, British, Soviet and American forces in World War Two.<br/><br/>The system is the same one used in Avalanche Press' game, Third Reich. In addition to five scenarios covering all or part of the War in the Pacific, Great Pacific War includes rules to link it and Third Reich to play the Second World War, a simulation of the entire conflict with up to seven players. Included in the game are five scenarios for the Great Pacific War and three scenarios for the linked Second World War. One of the Great Pacific War scenarios covers a possible 1931 conflict between Japan and America as postulated by the British journalist Hector Bywater in his book of the same title.<br/><br/>The facts:<br/><br/><br/>     Game scale is 60 miles per hex covering the battlefield on three 34&quot; x 22&quot; maps. Units are represented at corps, fleet and air army level. Each turn represents three months of actual time.<br/>     The game system is built around players drawing impulse &quot;chits&quot; to determine how they can activate their forces. The emphasis is on the interaction of military, political and economic factors (as in Third Reich).<br/><br/><br/>The game system from our Third Reich game allows players to control the military, political and economic destinies of their nations in a struggle to dominate the world. Land, air and sea forces battle across almost a third of the earth's surface as the two mightiest navies fight for control of the Pacific. Players manage their economies and build and operate their military forces within the capabilities of their nations' abilities.<br/><br/>In Great Pacific War the Japanese player must decide initially whether war with America or the Soviet Union will be his or her strategy. Japan&Iacute;s lack of resources make a war with one or the other a necessity. Also possible is a war with Britain and her ally, The Netherlands, who together control the riches of India, Java and Borneo. This strategy has many risks, the greatest being that America will enter the war on Britain's side. Coloring all is the massive Japanese investment in China and the importance of those conquered territories to the Japanese economy. The American player must move a nation unprepared for war to a position of strength, while attempting to support the Nationalist Chinese in their conflict with the Japanese.<br/><br/>In the linked game players have also to consider the effects of their actions on the global conflict. A Soviet player desperately defending Moscow in 1941 can little afford a Japanese attack on Vladivostok. Likewise a British player fighting Germany with only a seemingly soon-to-be-defeated Soviet Union as an ally, will not welcome a Japanese attack on his eastern possessions unless it brings America into the war. Historically Japan went to war to obtain the resources denied her by the Allies embargo of steel and oil and because German successes appeared to offer Japan the opportunity to join a victory almost already won. The question is whether you and your allies can do any better than your historical counterparts.<br/><br/>Components:<br/>Three 34&rdquo; x 22&rdquo; maps, <br/>560 playing pieces, <br/>rules, <br/>three scenario books, <br/>political events and charts.<br/><br/><br/>Note: <br/>The maps are not mounted like those in JP's Third Reich were.

Based upon the draw of Conflict cards, players may build forces, learn about their opponent, gain a secret advantage, or enter into a battle. The objective is to be the player at the end of the game with the most victory points, or to win the battle for your opponent&rsquo;s homeland. In addition, 20-card expansion packs are available to improve the selection and capabilities of Arsenal cards and Conflict cards for this set. Additionally, this set can be combined with the other World War II Starter Sets so you and your friends may play the entire war as you please.<br/><br/>Africa: Desolate, expansive, and inhospitable. Even in the absence of war, its hostile elements threaten the lives of all who trespass upon it. But war is not absent, as hordes of Italian soldiers and tanks take up arms to establish the New Roman Empire for their leader, Mussolini. Standing in their way is the old established British Empire, and the new up and coming power of America. Reaching out for help from their ally Germany, the Afrika Corps is formed to deal with the Army of the Nile which is now reinforced with fresh American blood and equipment. Thus, the see-saw war across a continent ensues. Can Rommel be victorious at El Alamein? Will the Allies take the fortress at Tobruk? Can Operation Torch penetrate the Italian Navy? Will the French navy be an asset to the Allies, or the Axis? Will Patton's forces be defeated at Kasserine Pass?

Dunnigan turned his eye to the Western Front. Combat Command was described as &quot;Platoon-Company Level Combat, France 1944&quot;.<br/><br/>From the Design Notes:<br/><br/>&quot;PanzerBlitz (published by Avalon Hill) proved to be a very popular game.  It was complex, but most people were enthusiastic about its apparent realism and authenticity.  In point of fact, PanzerBlitz was not all that realistic or authentic.  The game did have its good points.  That it moved at all was a credit to its play-mechanics.  What was lacking was an awareness, and implementation, of some of the more critical aspects of small unit operations.  Chief among these aspects is the &quot;confusion factor&quot;, which becomes nearly decisive at the platoon level.  Other aspects left untreated in PanzerBlitz were the near simultaneity of action and reaction at that scale, as well as a more realistic handling of combined arms coordination.<br/><br/>Not all of these problems (nor others unmentioned) have been solved in Combat Command.  By merely changing the cale and some of the combat and movement mechanics, we have introduced more change in the game than these innovations themselves suggest.  One rather obvious result is that the game is simpler, easier to play.  This is essential for any game.  Too much time spent on the mechanics makes the simulation more of an exercise than a game.  The game-system for platoon level simulation as it now stands in Combat Command is not yet perfect.  But we do feel it's superior to the system we first introduced in Tactical Game 3 and PanzerBlitz.  We are working on still better game-systems for this scale of operations.  When we finish them, we'll publish them!&quot;<br/><br/>The Combat Command game system was quickly discarded as the seventies saw SPI release a string of &quot;new and improved&quot; tactical wargame systems.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": {"34581": "Strategy & Tactics edition"}, "name": "Combat Command", "playingtime": "120", "boardgamemechanic": {"2026": "Hex-and-Counter"}, "average": "4.99697", "usersrated": "33", "boardgamesubdomain": {"4664": "Wargames"}, "boardgamefamily": {"3231": "Magazine: Strategy & Tactics"}}, "8430": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3636536.jpg", "poll": {}, "boardgamedesigner": {"2875": {"name": "Patrick C.

Unlike typical anagram word puzzles, the clues in Anagramania are not just the word or words from which the answer is derived. Instead, Anagramania clues actually provide a hint or definition of the correct solution. Here's an example:<br/><br/>&quot;Sam rang a friend to find out why the letters he wrote were so confused!&quot;<br/><br/>The object is to re-arrange all the letters of the keywords (&quot;Sam rang a&quot;) - which are shown in bold italics on the actual clue cards - to form a single word that solves the clue. The answer is of course &quot;anagrams&quot;.<br/> For each game, every player has an 11&quot; x 4&quot; 'throw away' clue sheet containing twenty clues like the one above. There are 24 sets of six clue sheets in each game pack. That's enough for six players to play 24 separate games.<br/><br/>During game play, players conceal their clue sheets in special 'pockets' that allow them to see only one new clue at a time. In most board games players have to await their turn, which can be quite irritating if each player requires several minutes for his or her turn. That's not the case in Anagramania. In each turn, all players compete simultaneously to solve the same clue. No time limit is set at the start of the turn, but once any one player claims to have the answer (and has written it down) other players have just one minute more to complete their efforts to find the answer (timed by a sand timer).<br/> By solving clues, players move pawns on a 14&quot; x 14&quot; play board. A correct answer earns forward progress - two squares for the first person who answered, one square for others. For a wrong answer, the player moves his/her pawn back a square; and for no answer, the pawn is left in its current position.

The game features various scenarios in which the average infantry squad would become involved.  Typical scenarios simulate meeting engagements, ambushes, raids, snatch missions and assualts on fortified positions.<br/><br/>Sequel to the game Sniper! (first edition) Popular tactical combat system.<br/><br/>As in Sniper, each player controls the equivalent of a squad of 5 to 15 men depending on the period, the scenario, and whether you attack or defend. One scenario corresponds to a few (one to five) minutes of real time action. The scale is a little larger than in Sniper (5 meters/hex, 5 seconds/turn vs 3 and 3 in Sniper), and there is no facing. The game system (though rated 7.1, ie pretty high, on SPI complexity scale), is quite straightforward and easy to learn. In the beginning of each turn, players secretly &quot;buy&quot; actions for all of their men. A normal man has 10 Movement Points to expend per turn. Fire, direct or opportunity, consumes all MP, as reloading one's weapon, or rearming (ie readying to use it after throwing a grenade or shooting a rifle grenade). Standing up, preparing a grenade, throwing it, cost 5MP. And movement costs MP depending on terrain...<br/>After all actions have been plotted, players check for panic: a certain percentage of all your men, depending on their hex number, have their actions canceled, or move randomly. (although very annoying, this rule does wonders at simulating low level control problems). Then, all remaining actions are performed: combat, movement, and finally grenade and artillery impacts. Rules cover a large variety of equipment: weapons like rifles, MP, MG, rocket launchers, grenade launchers and flamethrowers, but also barbed wire, pillboxes, artillery, mines, and up to one vehicle (APC or tank) per side. Five kind of combat situations are covered: patrol, reconnaissance, ambush, raid and assault. Some lending themselves quite well to solitaire play. A large number of scenarios (from WWI to modern) are provided, and you can easily design your own. A standard scenario plays in a couple of hours. Altogether, I think the system is pretty good for such a man to man combat situation. However, be warned that this very detailed scale has a peculiar feeling, which not all &quot;tactical&quot; game players (ie players used to ASL or Gamers TCS, which focus on company/battalion level units) will like:<br/>in Patrol! the player is a sergeant, not a captain.<br/>review by: Francois Charton<br/><br/>Game Scale:<br/>Game Turn: 5 seconds to 5 minutes<br/>Hex: 5.4 yards / 5 meters<br/>Units: Individual Soldiers &amp; Vehicles<br/><br/>Game Inventory:<br/>Six 9 x 9&quot; four color maps<br/>One dual-side printed countersheet (400 1/2&quot; counters)<br/>One 32-page Patrol rulebook<br/>Foure Player Aids Cards<br/>Two 6-sided dice<br/><br/>Solitaire Playability: Medium<br/>Complexity Level: Medium<br/>Players: 1 or more<br/>Playing Time: 2-6 hours<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "1", "boardgameversion": {"93215": "SPI First Edition"}, "average": "6.18928", "name": "Patrol!", "playingtime": "240", "boardgamemechanic": {"2689": "Action / Movement Programming"}, "age": "12", "usersrated": "97", "boardgamesubdomain": {"4664": "Wargames"}, "boardgamefamily": {"3258": "The Sniper Series"}}, "8038": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic276892.jpg", "poll": {}, "boardgamedesigner": {"1269": {"name": "Michael Bennighof"}}, "statistics": {}, "yearpublished": "2002", "maxplayers": "2", "boardgameartist": {"14914": "Peggy Gordon"}, "boardgamepublisher": {"142": {"name": "Avalanche Press Ltd."}}, "maxplaytime": "120", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic276892_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "120", "boardgamecategory": {"1051": {"name": "Napoleonic"}}, "description": "The latest in the Eagles of the Empire series.

Each player takes on the role of one of the minor Condottiere princes, such as the Gonzagas or d'Estes. Then there are the big five major cities: Venice, Milan, Florence, Rome, and Naples. These are not controlled by individual players, but players will gain 'interests' in them as the game progresses. Each city has six tiles, most of which represent a famous character such as Lucrezia Borgia or Lorenzo Medici. Each tile has its own special properties that are linked to the character on the tile. Thus Cesare Borgia will help you to become more treacherous, while a Venetian merchant will increase your income. These tiles are also worth victory points, depending on the status of the city at the end of the game.<br/><br/>A city's status will change as a result of war. When two cities fight, they will each need a Condottiere to fight for them. Players bid, using influence points, to decide who will represent each city. The outcome of the war will depend on a little luck and the size of each player's army. Each player also gets paid for fighting, no matter what the outcome of the war is. Thus players can turn influence into gold, which in turn can be used to buy more City tiles.<br/><br/>No game on the Italian Renaissance would be complete without an element of treachery. Players can be openly treacherous by buying Treachery tiles, which will allow them to do nasty things like steal influence, bribe troops, or knock players out of an auction. However, the game allows players to be devious in other ways, that still remain legal. Making sure that a war goes the way you want it to is an important part of the game, and it is not always the player with the best army who ends up fighting. Want a city to lose, well become Condottiere for them and make sure you have a really bad army, or use Treachery tiles to bribe your own troops not to fight. At some point some player will become the Pope, which means he can form a Holy League (i.e. join one side in a battle). Want to make sure the Pope is on the 'right' side, well why not bribe him? What players negotiate over is up to them. The game does not force negotiation and works perfectly well without it, but it remains an avenue for players to explore.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "3", "boardgameversion": {"327886": "Heidelberger German edition"}, "average": "7.46225", "name": "Princes of the Renaissance", "playingtime": "180", "boardgamemechanic": {"2080": "Area Control / Area Influence"}, "age": "12", "boardgameexpansion": {}, "usersrated": "1836", "boardgamesubdomain": {"5497": "Strategy Games"}, "boardgamefamily": {"18744": "Cities: Bologna"}}, "8046": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic73591.jpg", "poll": {}, "boardgamedesigner": {"1485": {"name": "Lou Zocchi"}}, "statistics": {}, "yearpublished": "1973", "maxplayers": "8", "age": "12", "boardgamepublisher": {"843": {"name": "Gamescience"}}, "maxplaytime": "90", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic73591_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "90", "boardgamecategory": {"1047": {"name": "Miniatures"}}, "description": "This was Zocchi's revamped version of his Star Trek Battle Manual, without the (unlicensed) Star Trek references.

Storm clouds mass on all horizons, dark and brooding, shot with blood red, as the tides of war thunder back and forth across a blistered and broken land.<br/> One man took it upon himself to save his people in a breathtaking and desperate quest. To conquer the time-streams and be reborn. To battle with evil when it finally manifests itself upon the world.<br/><br/>High in the Eternal Tower of Chronopia, the One King sits alone, his mind studying the great and expansive time streams, with their countless possibilities. Looking into futures and pasts, he tries to determine a path among the<br/><br/>myriad possibilities that spring from every point in time.<br/>  <br/>Visions wracked the One King, nightmares born of doubt. Had his actions brought about the terrible events he sought to avoid? What subtleties and nuances must be brought to bear to fashion a future free of this Dark Prophecy?<br/><br/>Once you have chosen your army it will be time to select the troops that you will lead into battle.  Chronopia isn't a game that relies on the strengths of only one model, but rather the abilities of a diverse collection of warriors all working towards a common goal.  You will populate your army with warbands of close combat warriors, soldiers trained in all manner of weaponry from swords to axes; missile weapon warbands that will rain death down upon their enemies in great volleys; and Individuals like spell casters or fearsome monsters or even mighty war chariots.  Whatever the case, you will create a diverse army with which to recreate the epic struggles of the Empires of the Fourth Age of Chronopia.  You will populate your forces with miniatures and models available from Excelsior Entertainment.  <br/>These models will represent your own style of waging war and will be selected for your tastes.  Once you have chosen your warriors you will need to paint them.  A well-painted army will bring your games to life and seize your imagination with the epic battles you will recreate.  There are many resources to help you learn how to paint your miniatures and we recommend that you practice and try new techniques- the results will well be worth it.<br/><br/>You will need a few things to begin your epic journey into the realms of Chronopia.  Most important are this rule book, some Chronopia miniatures from the extensive Chronopia line, Warband Unit Cards (which come with each model), a twenty-sided die (d20), a ruler or measuring tape, and a pen.  In addition to these items you may need some of the counters and templates found in the back of this book.  You will also need a place to engage your armies in battle.  This can be an inspiring custom war game table that you have spent a great amount of time creating or it can be as simple as a dining room table or a stretch of floor.  The site of a well-designed table however, with your armies spread out before you will do wonders to fire the imaginations and invigorate your play.  There are numerous resources for how to create battlefields and just as many manufactured resources to draw upon.

The Allies are gathered to attempt their breakout and begin the race toward the German frontier. Each player has Combat Units and Headquarters available, and is capable of maneuvering across the map and engaging enemy pieces in combat. You must master the deceptively concise rules for Activation and Movement Point expenditure. And at any given time, you will face the decision of which army to Activate in any one phase - and your opponent will have an immediate opportunity to react . The most interesting aspect of the game is that it seriously tries to model time over the course of the player's turn. You activate HQs, which can then control a varying number of infantry or armor units, depending on nationality. There is a track display that you use during movement/combat. As you make decisions about which actions to take, you branch along the track, limiting your options about what you can do next. Essentially this captures the passage of time required for certain actions. It's easier to play than it is to describe.  For example, suppose you have an armor division near the enemy and a couple of infantry divisions further away. If you move up the infantry to attack and make a breakthrough, the armored unit will probably not be able to move very far through the breach. In effect, the armored unit has spent most of the turn waiting around for the infantry to get in position and make its attack.  The game puts emphasis on elite units on both sides and on the brittleness of the powerful British formations (no replacements).

Scenarios that have previously taken more than a day to complete are finished within a few hours.  Once you try this game, you won't want to go back to others, believe me!<br/><br/>Crossfire focuses on infantry action at the company level with squads as the smallest element. Some people play with house rules which add more detail to the armor rules - but the existing rules work fine as Crossfire is primarily and infantry orientated rule set.<br/><br/>Crossfire is actually a step up from our 1:1 preferences, with figures mounted on stands of 2-3 figures representing a squad.  This was a bit of a nervous jump from 1:1 for me, but the result has been very rewarding.  I think one of the reasons I like it so much is that the idea of squads moving about is a bit like Avalon Hill's Squad Leader which we played years and years ago.

Team Yankee presents the expertise that the modern tank company commander needs in easy-to-follow game rules format.  Two players each form their own strategies as they fight out potential, very real situations on the battlefield of World War III.  Soviet units have numbers and firepower; U.S. units have speed and technology.  To each side's advantages and disadvantages the players add strategy and leadership.<br/><br/>Rules cover the essentials of movement and combat between modern combat units.  On this foundation are built special rules covering artillery, morale, chemical warfare, air support, and the other special aspects of modern warfare.<br/><br/>The game maps cover the same ground shown in the novel.  Eight game scenarios walk you through the rules, unveiling the effects of all the rules, and showing you in detail how to play the game.  In the course of playing the scenarios, you will be able to recreate the situations in the book (and perhaps alter their course).<br/><br/>The rules chapter on variants lets players change the scenarios to add new rules and replay scenarios to see what effects they will have on the situation.

However, you can have as many rows and columns as you would like (and your board accommodates). To set-up the game, fill each square with a playing piece, alternating between black and white pieces.<br/><br/>Black moves first, by taking off one of his pieces. He may only remove a piece from the middle of the board or from one of the corners. White removes one of his pieces that is adjacent orthogonally to the empty square created by Black. There should now be two empty squares next to each other.<br/><br/>From there on, players take turns jumping their opponents&rsquo; pieces. A jump may only be made orthogonally, never diagonally. A player may make multiple jumps with the same piece in a turn, provided that he does not change direction. Making a multiple jump is optional.

The auctioneer can accept the highest bid, take the money, and sell the next card, or the auctioneer can take the card by himself, but then he is no longer the auctioneer (next clockwise is). If no one bids on something, the auctioneer must take the card (that can be hard because money is really short) - so you have to be careful what you sell.<br/><br/>The cards you're bidding on are production places, technologies, resources, and improvements (bonus). After the bidding phase you can build production places and improvements and develop technologies, then you immediately get victory points.

In what became known as the Winter War, ferocious Finnish resistance soon shocked the world and inflicted repeated defeats on the invaders.<br/><br/>The Soviet plan included attacks in the dark forests of Eastern Karelia, attempting to outflank the stout line of Finnish fortifications to the south. Their 139th Rifle Division advanced in early December 1939 along the river Aittijoki, faced by only a handful of Finnish battalions. The Finns panicked in some places, and a near-rout seemed inevitable. Finnish Marshal Carl Gustav Mannerheim sent a small group of reinforcements led by Col. Paavo Talvela, previously in charge of buying artillery ammunition for the army.<br/><br/>Talvela proved that a warrior lived within the bureaucrat, as he put new heart into his men and stemming the Soviet advance. After heavy fighting, the Finns had destroyed the 139th Rifle Division and routed the 75th Rifle Division. But they suffered serious losses as well, as the Soviets here had committed ski troops of their own including the &ldquo;Red Finns&rdquo; seldom mentioned by Finnish writers.<br/><br/>Winter Fury re-creates the twin battles of Tolvaj&auml;rvi and Ilomantsi from 1939, as well as the 1941 Finnish offensive over the same ground. It uses a &ldquo;variable impulse&rdquo; game system to model the two armies&rsquo; very different capabilities. Each turn, each player puts a number of markers into a common container. These are then drawn one by one, the number drawn varying with the current weather condition. The Finnish player has weaker forces, but will usually draw more markers and these allow the Finns to conduct more operations. The good Finnish units are better than the Soviet ones, and more mobile in the forests. The Soviet cannot move his or her divisions together, complicating the Red Army&rsquo;s efforts. But Soviet artillery is very powerful while Finnish guns are little more than a nuisance. The Soviet player also has tanks and armored cars, which not only are powerful in battle (at least on the roads), they also might cause the Finns to panic and run away.<br/><br/>Winter Fury is the second in our line of Playbooks: a 64-page book about the battle and the forces involved that also includes a complete historical game on the subject. The book includes a lengthy background piece by David Lippman as well as rules, scenarios and other historical data.

On the o&shy;ne hand it depends surely o&shy;n the fact that the Second World War is a very serious topic which of course does not simplify its realization in a card game, o&shy;n the other hand this very background requires the great historical precision and complexity that seemed difficult to achieve until now.<br/><br/>The alphaBIT company from Hannover (Germany) takes charge of this problematic topic from now o&shy;n and excels by a balance of realism and subtle intuition. History of War (HoW) presents the Second World War solely as the tactical fight of units.  Retaliatory weapons, atom bombs or personal names like those of generals are deliberately excluded from the game.<br/><br/>The goal of the game is a conquest of land cards that should bring together 15 win points. A means to an end in this case are the mentioned units and the HoW really succeeded to bring together three large parts of a war: fight by land, by air and by sea.<br/><br/>It makes the game truly particular as even computer games have difficulties in combining these three types of units. As a rule they are divided into land/air or sea/air. In History of War o&shy;n the contrary  the players can use all the units like infantry, tanks, artillery, fighters, bombers, submarines and cruisers in o&shy;ne and the same deck without problems. In addition just like in all other TCGs they can choose freely in a great card pool and make up their own deck.<br/><br/>There appears another positive aspect  that would please first of all the players with not much means: there is no degree of rarity in HoW. All the cards of an edition are available exactly o&shy;nce in a set which means that a player knows what he buys and already with a few sets is equipped enough for a chosen side. The mentioning of the units provokes the question how they could be paid. The usual  principle in other TCGs  works here as well: some special cards provide the resources. These are called base improvements in HoW. These cards deliver not o&shy;nly the important  technical values (TVs) necessary for payment of units, action cards and effects, but they possess as well useful qualities, so that the mere choice of his base improvements has decisive  consequences for a player. The TVs deliver also the country improvements that can be placed directly in the countries and thus are imminently exposed to the attacks of the enemy, but then dispose of the interesting effects. The units paid with the TVs are played in the so-called deployment zone. The units have different attack and defense values for various areas like land, air and sea. The victory flags o&shy;n the unit cards necessary to conquer the countries are transformed into the win points at the end of the game.<br/><br/>More detailed and profound division of the values, ammunition consumption, moral and so o&shy;n known from other games were deliberately resigned to make a game easy-to handle. Such special characteristics of the units were replaced by useful abilities that make the game fluent and the rules clear. The final transformation of the units into win points is based o&shy;n historical accuracy.<br/><br/>All the cards show the high quality pictures or even photos of the Second World War and the unit cards are enriched by engineering data.

The game appears to have much more in common with games like Necromunda or Mordheim in this respect.<br/><br/>The rules are short, only 44 pages, with sparse hand-drawn artwork; not a single photograph is used.  Two introductory scenarios are included, rules are included for constructing your own forces.

The batter choosing to let the ball pass (if he thinks it'll be a ball), to bunt, or swing. To swing, he places the bat over 4 locations where he thinks the ball may end up. The pitcher then reveals the pitch, and rolls a die to see how many spaces and what direction the pitch moves to determine the final location of the pitch.

Two to four players send ships to explore islands scattered about a 5 x 12 square ocean (the more players, the  more islands). The settlement of the new lands is, however, strictly abstract.<br/><br/>Each player's turn begins with the roll of one 6-sided die. A &quot;6&quot; is a random event (pirates, fire or good fortune - bad twice as often as lucky, and most likely to damage players who are doing well). On other results, each player gains a commodity from one of his five workshops. The player who rolled may then buy commodities from the bank, sell them to his colonists for gold (no trading among players), or use them in various combinations to recruit new colonists, promote existing ones, or build ships. After that, ships can sail for the unknown lands.<br/><br/>Each island bears on its hidden side an outpost, a treasure or a trade agreement. After being discovered, these items are brought back to the home country (and the ship is removed from play, requiring the player to build a new one in order to keep searching). Outposts increase the productivity of workshops. Treasure yields either gold or free colonist promotions. Trade agreements reduce the gold needed to buy commodities from the bank.<br/><br/>Besides being useful in these ways, outposts, gold and agreements are among the game's victory conditions. A player wins by being to first to attain three out of five objectives, namely, four outposts, 30 gold, three trade agreements, three colonists promoted to the top rank of &quot;merchant&quot; and the construction of four public buildings. The buildings (8 types, each bringing some advantage) cost nothing but don't become available until a player has recruited at least four colonists. After that, each new colonist adds a building (unless they've been preempted by other players; there aren't enough for everyone).<br/><br/>Overall, the game falls squarely into the &quot;simultaneous solitaire&quot; category.

Once peaceful and neighborly, the Masters of the competing mountain-folk train their students and send them out across bridges to control neighboring villages. To take control of a village, the students must come together in uncomfortable alliances, regardless of their tribal origin. Eventually students become Masters themselves, train new students and expand to other villages.<br/><br/>There is one thing each student must keep in mind as they travel from village to village -- the mystical powers of Shangri-La mysteriously cause the bridges to collapse, separating villages forever. One crucial question will decide the winner: who will control the most Masters of Shangri-La?<br/><br/>Players take on the roles of leaders of a specific tribe. There is a battle raging over the empty villages of the land and players must quickly fill those villages with their tribal leaders. As players migrate tribal leaders from one village to the next, they must not become too weak or they risk losing leaders to opposing tribes. The ultimate object of the game is to have the most leaders on the board at the end of the game.<br/>It is an abstract game with many options and tense until the end.<br/><br/>2004 Mensa Select<br/><br/>Thematically, players are adding masters and students, and trying to have the students migrate to nearby villages to become masters.  Functionally, this is essentially a military game.  Players either spend their turn reinforcing a village (adding more tokens there) or invading a neighboring village (expanding influence if you have more total tokens than the victim).  The unique twist is that, after each invasion, the connecting bridge is removed.  So over the course of the game, attack options become more and more limited, until the game naturally comes to a conclusion.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "3", "boardgameversion": {"26394": "Dutch edition"}, "average": "6.76567", "name": "The Bridges of Shangri-La", "playingtime": "60", "boardgamemechanic": {"2080": "Area Control / Area Influence"}, "age": "10", "usersrated": "2086", "boardgamesubdomain": {"5497": "Strategy Games"}, "boardgamefamily": {"22783": "Admin: Better Description Needed!"}}, "8191": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic170618.jpg", "poll": {}, "boardgamedesigner": {"53": {"name": "Pascal Bernard"}}, "statistics": {}, "yearpublished": "2000", "maxplayers": "6", "boardgameartist": {"12596": "Emmanuel Roudier"}, "boardgamepublisher": {"42": {"name": "Tilsit"}}, "maxplaytime": "60", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic170618_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "60", "boardgamecategory": {"1041": {"name": "Children's Game"}}, "description": "This is a stand-alone follow-up game to Gast\u00e9rospeed or Snail's Pace introducing six new tracks and some new cards.
