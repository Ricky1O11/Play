It seems to be an incredibly well researched effort to create a game that allows players to simulate life as a noble in Arthur's Britain. The game covers politics, war, economics, personal combat, romance, and more. Apparently this was the only game New Rules, Inc., ever produced.<br/><br/>Here's what the promotional material that comes with the game mentions:<br/><br/>Enter the world of HIDDEN KINGDOM...<br/><br/>A unique adventure game that combines the most exciting elements of three popular gaming systems: fantasy-role playing, historical simulation, and strategic conflict.<br/><br/>HIDDEN KINGDOM is set in the turbulent age of King Arthur -- a world rich in diversity and conflict. It is an age of passion, chivalry, and faith -- of heroes and schemers. There are skirmishes of vengeance and wars to unify the kingdom. Monsters stalk the hinterlands while Christians and Pagans vie for the hearts and souls of men! Sainthood and naked power walk side by side and the Code of Chivalry attempts to reconcile them both.<br/><br/>HIDDEN KINGDOM captures the noble ideals of Arthur, the legends and romance of Camelot, and the high adventure of the knights and ladies of the Round Table!<br/><br/>---<br/><br/>The game components are high quality (especially when considered in the context of the era) and consist of the following:<br/>- Sturdy Three Ring Binder &amp; Slip Cover<br/>- Complete Rules &amp; Reference Guide<br/>- Character information on over 300 characters<br/>- 5 Character information sheets<br/>- 2-part color hex map of Arthur's Britain<br/>- Basic charts folder (this item is essentially a folded up poster that has all the mostly commonly used game charts)<br/>- Dice (two 6-sided, three 10-sided), and one each of 4, 8, 12, &amp; 20-sided).<br/><br/>Character Creation<br/><br/>One of the unique features of this system is that it completely lacks character creation. Each player chooses one of the 300 or so nobles included with the game and plays that person. This means that it's possible to play some of the more famous Knights of Arthurian Legend (or someone much more obscure).<br/><br/>There are only a handful of characteristics...<br/><br/>- LB (Leadership Bonus): Important in Warfare<br/>- SPR (Swordplay Roll): Ability to hit in personal combat<br/>- OB (Offensive Bonus): Damage bonus in personal combat<br/>- DB (Defensive Bonus): Ability to avoid damage in personal combat<br/>- UN/JB: Unseating Bonus &amp; Jousting Bonus: Used in determining a jousting outcome<br/><br/>The Alignment system in the game is also somewhat unusual. Characters are either Christian or Pagan with subdivisions of each of those two categories. These alignments affect how a character's Faith/Power &amp; Chivalry ratings rise and fall... these ratings, in turn, influence how NPCs view the characters and can make certain tasks harder or easier to perform.<br/><br/>Game Sequence<br/><br/>The game also has a somewhat unusual turn progression. The Game Guide (think GM) leads the players through these modes as the adventure progresses.<br/><br/>There are four game modes: <br/>Mode 1 - Traveling<br/>Mode 2 - Encounters<br/>Mode 3 - &quot;Sundries&quot;<br/>Mode 4 - Special<br/><br/>Traveling Mode involves simple moving from place to place. Any sort of impediment or event moves the game into Encounter Mode. The game includes an exhaustive series of tables to determine what sort of encounter happens (based on terrain and province). These can range from a classic damsel in distress scenario, to a monster attacks, to seeing a Black Knight riding in the distance. Mode 3 doesn't seem to have a proper name, but it usually flows as a response to what comes up in the Encounter Mode. This may involve personal combat, negotiating, fleeing, supernatural intervention, hiding, searching, etc. Mode 3 is also the mode where various other needs of the party are addressed (like eating). Mode 4 is reserved for a handful of special actions/events: Warfare, Tournaments, Adventures. An Adventure is a structured encounter involving the sort of activity that is classically associated with a D&amp;D module: traveling to a remote area, overcoming obstacles/creatures, in order to return with a treasure/piece of information/important person. (The time intervals in these modes can be very flexible).<br/><br/>In addition to the stats for the various characters, the Appendices in the back of the book cover the twenty Kingdoms of the game, Heraldry (with images of various shields), and Magical Items. There's also a write-up of a sample play session.<br/><br/>Even leaving aside the game engine, this has a great deal of material useful for any game set during the Arthurian Era.<br/><br/>"}, "56020": {"rpgdesigner": ["Wolfgang Baur", "Adam Daigle", "Ben McFarland", "Jaye Sonia", "Joshua Stevens", "Russ Taylor"], "rpgitemversion": ["PDF Version", "Softcover"], "rpgseries": ["Zobeck Gazetteer"], "name": "Dwarves of the Ironcrags", "rpgartist": ["Gustave Dor\u00e9", "Pat Loboyko", "Arthur Rackham", "Jonathan Roberts", "Elmer Boyd Smith", "Hugo Solis"], "rpgproducer": ["Mike McArtor"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic554607.jpg", "usersrated": "3", "rpgsetting": ["Midgard"], "average": "8", "rpgissuearticle": ["Twenty Questions with Brandon Hodge!"], "rpg": ["d20 System / OGL Product (D&D 3.5 Compatible)"], "rpgpublisher": ["Open Design LLC"], "poll": [], "statistics": [], "rpgcategory": ["Sourcebook (rules/options to enhance play)"], "rpggenre": ["Fantasy (High Fantasy)"], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic554607_t.jpg", "description": "From the back of the book:<br/><br/>Tougher than their own Mountains<br/>Zobeck Gazetteer Volume 2<br/><br/>More than taciturn miners and miserly smiths, the dwarves of Zobeck possess a richly varied culture that includes slavers, secretive fraternal orders, and magical blades containing the souls of the dead.<br/>The Dwarves of the Ironcrags Gazetteer describes all these aspects of Zobeck dwarven culture and more:<br/><br/>    Descriptions of all the dwarven cantons, including those that were lost.<br/>    An examination of dwarven society, from bride-prices to the dwarven view of slavery.<br/>    The Most Honorable and Righteous Fraternal Order of Illuminated Brothers, a secretive fraternal order, complete with prestige classes.<br/>    The Kariv, a downtrodden group of wandering nomads often welcome among the dwarves.<br/>    Dwarven magic, including new spells and magic items of dwarven and derro creation.<br/>    A bestiary containing nine new monsters and templates.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>The Dwarves of the Ironcrags Gazetteer contains many other secrets of the dwarves, including numerous spells, domains, and feats, as well as other new options for dwarven and Kariv characters in the Ironcrags.

European Colonial powers exert barbaric influence. The Quincunx is outraged by the intrusion of Western Cainites, but are the outsiders actually responsible for the chaos? Are the Devil-Tigers party to the Opium Trade? Is the Quincunx's indignation over invasion a ruse to hide its own complicity? Power makes for strange bedfellows.<br/><br/>Sunset Empires is a historical setting for Kindred of the East. Neatly framed between the Opium Wars and the Chinese Boxer Rebellion, this sourcebook not only enables players and Storytellers to participate in a rich period of the Middle Kingdom's history but allows them to shape the future. Welcome to the dawn of the Fifth Age.<br/><br/>Sunset Empires is part of the history of the World of Darkness; therefore nobody gets to play the part of the wholly innocent victim. Everyone takes a role in setting the course of the Victorian Age; everyone must eventually pay the piper. This book serves as a historical setting, covering the 19th century almost in its entirety, but it also serves as a vehicle to involve characters in one of Asia's most trying times. Why discuss the Opium Wars when characters can take part in them? Why mention Japan's rapid modernization if characters can't join the internecine fighting dividing the Japanese uji?<br/><br/>From the introduction:<br/><br/>Chapter One: China revisits the Middle Kingdom during her greatest turmoil. As China unravels and spirals out of control, it loses territory to foreign countries and prestige in the eyes of its own citizens. This chapter offers an overview of the Five August Courts during this turbulent period and invaluable information on the Quincunx&rsquo;s hierarchy.<br/><br/>Chapter Two: India touches upon the fabled subcontinent and the events birthing the celebrated British Raj, including the Great Mutiny. There&rsquo;s also information on the basic structure of Victorian Indian cities to help Storytellers build their own regional settings.<br/><br/>Chapter Three: Japan deals with one of the only Asian countries to successfully adapt to the new world. This chapter illustrates Japan&rsquo;s ability to remake itself from a traditional Asian nation to the only regional superpower to defeat a European country in war. Storytellers may also find the discussion on uji houses, politics and hierarchy especially useful.<br/><br/>Chapter Four: Southeast Asia touches upon the myriad scattered islands and countries of the Golden Courts, as well as the campaigns to tame these wild domains. From the warlike and tribal Burmese, to France&rsquo;s invasion of Indochina, to the Europe-savvy Siam, the region is rich in history, adventure and danger.<br/><br/>Chapter Five: Character Creation summarizes the character creation process with an eye toward keeping it true to the spirit of the era. It also incorporates information offered in Victorian Age: Vampire and Kindred of the East, as well as offering new P&rsquo;o archetypes and martial arts.<br/><br/>Chapter Six: Storytelling Sunset Empires finally compiles all the previous information together by discussing historical events and potential character roles during such notable milestones as the Great Mutiny, the Opium Wars and the Boxer Rebellions.

This game system uses two 10-sid&shy;ed dice. Ideally it uses percentiles, which are a set of same colored 10-sided dice but one has double digits so that when they are rolled together, they create a 1-100 result, otherwise a D100 can be used or two 10-sided dice, one being a different color than the other. That&rsquo;s it, no messing around, no lost dice or scrambling for extra dice around the game table, just two 10-sided dice. You can&rsquo;t go wrong.<br/><br/>Every attribute and roll in W.O.P. is based on percentages which is why the only dice used are 10-sided dice. All rolls are also based on opposed rolls. To succeed at doing something that doesn&rsquo;t involve another person or an active party, the player will be given a target number, and this target number is called Base.

The Japanese expansion reaches its limit in the archipelago of the Solomon Islands and New Guinea. The Japanese initial force, the Army of the South Seas, began to expand reducing the boundaries of the Australian defenses from its base in Rabaul, the logistic center of Japanese control in the zone.<br/>The naval-air battle of the Coral Sea was a hard blow for the Japanese force since the Soho, their light aircraft carrier, was sunk, and the amphibious invasion force destined to take Port Moresby had to return to Rabaul without fulfilling their mission. Afterwards the imperial forces tried to take Port Moresby by a ground assault, extending their way along the Solomon Islands creating air bases and observation stations throughout the archipelago.<br/>The Japanese forces were thus threatening naval communications between the United States and Australia.  In response, the Allies reinforced Australia and the New Caledonia zone looking for an opportunity to counterattack and to stop the imperial tide extending through the region. The return to Australia of veteran units from the Middle East allowed the Allies to initiate an offensive in Papua/New Guinea that would last six bloody months and result in the Allied recovery of the enclaves of Buna and Gona on the North coast of New Guinea.<br/><br/>In the Solomon Islands the North American counterattack began August 8th, 1942 and led to a lasting and bloody campaign through February 1943, with successive attacks and counterattacks of both sides resulting in Guadalcanal Island back in American hands. In addition to the ground forces, the region saw much use of air and naval operations.  Both navies accomplished herculean tasks to support their respective ground forces and supply them.  Their importance was noticeable, so air attacks on navies were numerous, and expensive in lives, planes and ships.  The last of them in this period was the battle of the Sea of Bismarck, which resulted in Allied air supremacy in the region.<br/>The Japanese Imperial navy based on the island of Truk made several raids in the region to support the small naval forces in the South Seas. But eventually the Japanese had to yield the initiative to the allies in the region as they exhausted their resources, fighting on two fronts.  The Allies exhausted the Japanese offensive, and they prepare to take their own offensive.<br/><br/>The game is developed in an operational scale &ndash; area-based map with a scale 1:300,000.  It is designed for two players with one running the JAPANESE forces and the other the ALLIED forces. The game lasts approximately 3-4 hours and uses a two sided system to handle the mechanics of play: cards and counters.  The players will have to use their troops and their resources to obtain victory points while eliminating enemy forces and occupying cities in the map. It is not a card driven game as the cards are used to bring about events that influence battles, secure reinforcements, and provide resources with which to carry on the fight.<br/><br/>In the beginning of the game the JAPANESE player will take the Initiative and will have to expand throughout the map to secure Victory Points. The ALLIED player is on the defensive, and will have to strength his forces as the game progresses. He will have to take advantage of every opportunity to inflict damage on the advancing Japanese forces.  The island of Guadalcanal will be crucial as the game develops, as are the results of actions in Papua/New Guinea.   <br/>The JAPANESE player must face the historical dilemma of concentrating on taking the Solomon Islands, Papua or both simultaneously.  The ALLIED player will have to be patient and force his opponent to extend himself, by accumulating forces and to committing lethal offensives that put the forces of the Empire of the Rising Sun in check. <br/>Like all the games of this Series, the rules are simple and straight forward.  Our objective was to create games that are very interactive, and offer players a pleasant creative experience.  We aim for solid games for players who do not have the time or the space to leave a game setup and in place over a long period of play.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": ["Command Japan edition", "English first edition", "Spanish first edition"], "average": "7.12674", "name": "Coral Sea: Campaign Commander Volume II", "playingtime": "180", "boardgamemechanic": ["Area Movement", "Area-Impulse", "Dice Rolling", "Rock-Paper-Scissors", "Simultaneous Action Selection"], "age": "10", "usersrated": "86", "boardgamesubdomain": ["Wargames"], "boardgamefamily": ["Campaign Commander"]}, "56242": {"boardgamedesigner": ["(Uncredited)"], "poll": [], "name": "Balatoni nyomoz\u00f3", "playingtime": "0", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": ["Storytelling"], "yearpublished": "2006", "usersrated": "0", "boardgamefamily": ["Nyomoz\u00f3 series"], "maxplayers": "8", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic585043_t.jpg", "average": "0", "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["Dft-Hung\u00e1ria"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic585043.jpg", "maxplaytime": "0", "boardgamecategory": ["Deduction", "Humor", "Movies / TV / Radio theme", "Murder/Mystery"], "age": "10", "minplaytime": "0", "description": "In this game players are detectives.

Urban Warfare, Burma Road, Lend Lease, Convoys, International and Territorial Waters, Ports, Elite Infantry, Partisans, Spanish Blue Division, Political Leaders are elements that enhance the realistic feel of the game.<br/><br/>The goal is to win a bronze, silver or gold (historical) victory over your enemies.<br/><br/>Rules for which Axis and Allies and Xeno pieces can not be used:<br/>-Weather effects like rain, heat, snow, fog and wind effect your troop's mobility. You can make your own weather markers or use the Litko Aerosystems weather markers.<br/>-Oil Derricks (we recommend Petropolis pieces) and oil drums (we recommend the supply counters from Axis and Allies Battle of the Bulge)<br/>-Commanders (we recommend 1/72 scale minis, Table Tactics jeeps or Axis and Allies miniatures commanders) Commanders allow surrender or retreat options.<br/>-Elite Infantry (we recommend 1/72 scale minis or AA Miniatures<br/><br/>To get all the miniatures to play all the rules is a bit of work, but remember you can also use them to make house rules for your regular Axis and Allies games or use the Sitzkrieg rules as an expansion to your own games.<br/><br/>"}, "56307": {"rpgdesigner": ["Michael Hammes", "Philip Reed"], "rpgitemversion": ["Electronic version", "Lulu Softcover Version"], "poll": [], "name": "4C System", "rpgartist": ["Louis Porter, Jr."], "rpgproducer": ["(Uncredited)"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic557349.jpg", "usersrated": "6", "average": "6.2", "statistics": [], "rpg": ["4C System"], "rpgpublisher": ["(Self-Published)"], "rpgcategory": ["Core Rules (min needed to play)"], "rpggenre": ["Action / Adventure (Superheroes)"], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic557349_t.jpg", "description": "From the introduction:<br/><br/>4C is a RPG toolkit rather than complete game system; it provides a foundation for you to build upon.

From the remotest primitive tribe to the greatest empire, every culture has created weapons for hunting, protection, conflict, and defense against the same. The record of history measures their successes and failures. No campaign world could ever hope to be as varied and diverse as our own.

From age to age, every culture has approached similar ends and concepts with its own unique perspective. 'From Stone to Steel' is not merely a simple list of items, but rather an explanation of their use, their cultural significance, even their drawbacks. Besides weapons and armor, 'From Stone to Steel' contains new feats, new skills, new prestige classes, and new mechanics. Through each chapter, topics like tactics, special materials, training, and culture are discussed, so that they can be understood and placed in any campaign world. And though these items are based in history, suggestions are made for their inclusion in fantasy world. You'll even find items of myth, fantastic construction materials, new spells to augment weapons and armor, even inclusion of fantasy racial items (based, where possible, on myth or legend).<br/><br/>From stone-age primitives to the height of the Renaissance, history is in your hands.

As the civilized countries of the world exchange gifts of nuclear missiles, the small volunteer population of the Morrow Project sleep far away from the blossoming nuclear fireballs in a deep dreamless winter. These few people, long prepared for the holocaust which rages around them, await the time when their ever-watchful machines will awaken them. They expect the time of their cold sleep to be a mere three or four years but everything had gone well right up to the war and it was now that the infamous gremlin Murphy shifted the gears. The &quot;cryonauts&quot; sleep on for one hundred and fifty years before their delinquent machines finally restore them. One hundred and fifty years of eroding culture and technology; one hundred and fifty years of fall-out boosted mutations; one hundred and fifty years of dog-eat-dog survival.<br/><br/>In the Morrow Project you will take the role of one of these &quot;cryonauts&quot;, and by doing so place yourself in a situation of forced survival. You know nothing of the changeling world around you and find dangers around every turn. You will find yourself face-to-face with the conditions created after a nuclear war. Genetic mutations in almost every form of affected wildlife constantly surprise and endanger you; radioactive &quot;hot spots&quot; are an always present peril; and you find that the most dangerous animal left on Earth continues to be Mankind itself. Survival is the only rule left to a chaotic society.<br/><br/>Somehow the separated Morrow Teams must contact one another, find their main base, and again bring civilization to the human race. They are Man's last hope for a future beyond survival, but mankind and the blasted forces of nature seem to unite in the task of destroying that last hope.

Stories of fairies granting wishes, doing our housework, or replacing teeth with coins are modern sugar-coated versions. In the original stories, the witch eats Hansel and Gretl. These stories weren&rsquo;t told to children to amuse them; they were told to terrify them and teach harsh lessons. Even children smart enough to leave a trail disappear if they wander into the woods.<br/><br/>The question is, where do they go?<br/><br/>The Undying Lands takes ordinary, everyday people and puts them into a fantasy world. A faerie-land, though not in the way most people today think of it. Here are the fae described in the old tales, the sidhe whose beauty surpasses all knowledge, the niskies who live in the streams and oceans, the wee folk who live in tiny cottages. Here are the goblins and trolls, the ogres and pixies, and yes, even tinkerbell-like faeries who fly around on glittering wings. Just don&rsquo;t expect them to live again when you clap your hands.<br/><br/>Getting your characters into the Undying Lands is easy. Getting them back out will be the hard part.

The basic setting is Renaissance Italy &ndash; as it might have been. Had there been fantastic, pre-industrial advanced technologies in the hands of a few. Had the Black Death never come. Had the remnants of highly-advanced civilizations been scattered around the world. Had reality been governed by mystical Forces instead of scientific laws. Had there been maniacal geniuses constantly plotting to take over the world. And, most importantly, had there been superheroes to thwart them.<br/><br/>But these are not the superheroes of our times, or even our parents&rsquo; times &ndash; these are the superheroes of our grandparents&rsquo; times, the action heroes of the pulps. Before the term &ldquo;superhero&rdquo; was coined. Before spandex costumes. When a man with a maniacal laugh, a pair of six-shooters, and the sole power to &ldquo;cloud men&rsquo;s minds&rdquo; had the power to send villains scurrying for their holes. Pulp heroes are only slightly better than the rest of us, not the breed apart of the modern superhero. They may laugh in the face of an armed man, but it is not because they are unthreatened. They may operate outside the law, but only because the authorities have chosen to allow it. And they rarely have the luxury of existing outside the norms of society for more than an evening at a time. In short, while they have exceptional powers, pulp heroes are not so powerful that they may ignore the rest of society.<br/><br/>About the PDF file:<br/><br/>The game rules, as a downloadable PDF of the complete game.
