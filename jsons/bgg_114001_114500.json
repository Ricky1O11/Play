The majority of the included cards have one of the horse's number. First, the cards are shuffled and a number of them are dealt to the &quot;Odds&quot; area of the board and are used with a set of dials to determine the odds for each horse. The players then place their bets. Then the cards are dealt to the race part of the board that has very nice pictures of happy looking horses ready to run.  The first horse to have 5 of its cards dealt from the deck for a 5 furlong race is the winner. The horses need one card per furlong to win a race.  Cards can be added to the deck that cause horses to run slow for a race, thus requiring an addition card.  Cards can be added to the deck that represent a horse not clearing a hedge row in a steeple chase race. There is an alternate way of running a race included.  Running times for each horse are assigned via a chart that uses the quantity of the horse's cards that are turned up to determine that running time.  In this race the lowest time is the winner.  Each game consists of a set of three races and during the set one player represent the Racing Committee or &quot;The House&quot;.

You will have to come up with the name of the middle person. Hollywood Hookups links all kinds of celebrities - actors and actresses, musicians, athletes, and royalty. The trivia questions are in 3 different categories, and span the contemporary era to early 20th century.<br/><br/>The Game<br/><br/>The actual board game consists of a board, more than 500 question cards, 50 tokens, 1 die and 6 colored game pieces (red, yellow, blue, green, pink and orange). This is a family-friendly game for 2 to 6 players, ages 13 and up. The object of the game is to collect tokens by answering trivia questions correctly. The first player to get 8 tokens wins the game. This game can either be a single-player game, or it can be played in teams of 2 or 3. We really like the design of the board - the maroon color of the board contrasts nicely with the gold accents. The outside of the box has a white background, with more than 30 different celebrity names on the box - Marilyn Monroe, Tom Cruise, Britney Spears, to name a few.<br/><br/>The Question Cards<br/><br/>The questions come in 3 different categories - Modern, Classic and Connect 3.

The board is composed of 24x32 squares (18mm) (on a folded A2-sized map) and portrays the geography and transport system of the time. One player assumes the role of Confederate President Jeff Davis and deploys the gray armies (represented by numbered gray cardboard squares) to defend the new Confederate nation. The other player assumes the role of Union President Abraham Lincoln, and deploys the blue armies (represented by numbered blue cardboard squares) in an attempt to crush the rebellion and recapture Confederate territory and cities.<br/><br/>Players take turns to &ldquo;move and fight&rdquo; as they manoeuvre their armies around the map. The game begins in the year 1861 and has the potential to continue until the end of 1865. Each year is made up of 4 Game Turns (except for 1861 which has only 3 Game Turns) with games typically taking 2-4 hours to complete. Victory points are awarded for winning battles, destroying armies, capturing towns and achieving specific objectives. The Victory Point Ladder shows who is winning at any stage of the game. A player wins the game by garnering sufficient victory points or achieving a winning objective such as occupying their opponent&rsquo;s capital.<br/><br/>The game fits into a slim, lightweight white plastic A4 box colourfully decorated. The box contains a folded map, blue and grey numbered army pieces, 3 game charts, a die, round town markers, a 20 page comprehensive rule booklet and a 3 page &quot;Let's get started&quot; rule booklet. Access is also provided to information regarding: strategy and tactics, the historical basis behind the rules and the map, the thinking behind the game's design and suggestions for optional rules to enable players to create more challenging game variants. For example,turning the army markers upside down creates a &quot;fog of war&quot; where although players can see their opponent&rsquo;s armies, their strengths are concealed. Historical and geographical accuracy has been attempted, however, no prior knowledge of the civil war is needed to play.<br/><br/>Specific features of the game include: ease of play, the game feels like an elaborate version of checkers / draughts played out over complex terrain. The blue Union armies can engage in sea-based movements to launch invasions. The game is sufficiently flexible as to allow experienced players to adjust the basic rules, eg to change movement allowances or army strengths to make games more challenging.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": {"139148": "English first edition"}, "name": "Fighting for Virginia", "playingtime": "0", "boardgamemechanic": {"2072": "Dice Rolling"}, "average": "4.5", "usersrated": "2", "age": "9"}, "114029": {"statistics": {}, "name": "Alpine Racer", "videogamemode": {"2422": "Local Multiplayer"}, "videogameversion": {"139150": "Arcade Version"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1549946.png", "videogameseries": {"10702": "Alpine Racer"}, "videogametheme": {"2371": "Sports - Skiing"}, "usersrated": "0", "average": "0", "videogamegenre": {"2157": "Sports"}, "videogameplatform": {"4781": "Arcade"}, "poll": {}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1549946_t.png", "description": "Alpine Racer is a 3D Alpine skiing arcade game released by Namco in 1995.

It is a 2 or 3-player game and can be played with a Shibumi set. The winning conditions vary slightly for the 2 and 3-player games; however, the game play is the same for both versions.  Naturally, team play is also possible.<br/><br/>At game&rsquo;s end, a pyramid of 29 marbles is created, which resembles an Inca temple. The peak level is not used.<br/><br/>The board starts empty. Players choose a color and take the corresponding marbles. Player turns proceed clockwise. Herein, the order is assumed to be White, Black, and possibly Red.<br/><br/>Starting with White, using the phase order below:<br/>1.    A player may move any free marble on the board to any adjacent (orthogonal or diagonal) hole or 2x2 platform which is on the same level as the marble.<br/><br/>A free marble is any marble that does not support two or more marbles in the level above it, and will not cause to move any marble that was moved or placed on the previous player&rsquo;s turn. This includes tumble-downs. And,<br/><br/>2.    A player must place one of his or her marbles on any empty space or 2x2 platform on the board. This completes the player&rsquo;s turn.<br/> Any marble that was relocated, tumbled down or was placed is temporarily locked for the following player&rsquo;s turn. The virtual Shibumi Sandbox implementation at  igGameCenter at <a target='_blank' href='http://www.iggamecenter.com/' rel='nofollow'>http://www.iggamecenter.com/</a>, has moved marbles marked with a plus sign. Nice and convenient. For physical game board play, players will have to keep tract of their last moves by recording them.<br/><br/>When the Inca temple is completed, each player sums the sizes of the smallest of his or her connected groups on each of the four faces of the pyramid. Each of the four faces will yield only one number. For example, if on one face of the temple, a player had group sizes of 1, 1 and 3, the player would only score 1 for that face.

After almost a year of play-testing and messing around with the mechanics we really want to print this game and get it out there.<br/><br/>What comes in the initial deck?<br/><br/>The deck comes with a box with instructions printed on the back. 108 cards in the deck. 12 cards are the decision cards (hopefully to be replaced by DICE) 94 cards that each have two word parts listed on either the yellow or orange side. The final 2 cards are our special thanks and stuff like that cards.<br/><br/>How do you play?<br/><br/>LangGuini is played by one player being selected as the first to deal/judge. The player selects from one of the 12 decision or &quot;dice cards&quot; (hopefully to be replaced by DICE if we get enough pledges) to find out how many word parts and what color(s) will be used. After selecting from that portion of the deck the dealer selects the word part cards and uses the parts to spell out a word of their own design. After laying out the cards the dealer pronounces the new word for the other players to hear. Then in clockwise fashion the players explain what they think is the definition of the word. After all players define the new word the dealer becomes judge and decides who wins that round. The winner keeps the cards that were used and then takes the role of dealer/judge until they pick a winner and so on.

Reviews of the game range from average to negative, with criticism of the game's graphics and acting.<br/><br/>Love Story is an interactive movie in which the story is depicted in continuous full motion videos. The player can make various actions at set moments (such as communicating by writing on sand, chalkboards, or computer screens) which result in slightly different paths and scenes, although the direction of the story remains globally the same. Events similar to the Quick Time Events featured in Sega's game Shenmue are also present. They require the player to trigger an action by quickly pushing a button when an &quot;O&quot; flashes on-screen.<br/><br/>The player can shoot arrows at Lina, which allow to read her mind in text dialogues or cutscenes. Minigames are present, including baseball and rhythm games. All these actions can increase or decrease the player's &quot;love meter&quot; depending on his success, and the objective of the game is to fill the love meter to 100 percent by the end of the sixth day.<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;0 Story&quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "114078": {"statistics": {}, "name": "4x4 EVO 2", "videogamemode": {"2422": "Local Multiplayer"}, "videogameversion": {"139318": "English/European PlayStation 2 edition"}, "average": "4", "videogametheme": {"2456": "Driving"}, "usersrated": "1", "videogamegenre": {"2154": "Racing"}, "videogameplatform": {"4425": "GameCube"}, "poll": {}, "videogamecompilation": {"140687": "Extreme Fun 5 Top Selling Mac Games"}, "description": "4x4 EVO 2 is a video game developed by Terminal Reality for the PlayStation 2, Xbox, GameCube, Microsoft Windows and Mac OS X.

It was released for the PlayStation 2 on January 27, 2005.<br/><br/>Another Century's Episode is the collaboration of Banpresto, best known for their Super Robot Wars franchise, and From Software, the makers behind the Armored Core series. The game is a fast-paced action title featuring characters, mecha and story elements from nine famous Japanese anime. However, while Super Robot Wars is known for combining super robots, like Mazinger Z, and real robots, like Mobile Suit Gundam, A.C.E. exclusively focuses on real robots (later games, however, have include 1-2 Super Robot series in their casts).<br/><br/>In the future, mankind has reached the stars, with colonies orbiting Earth and even Mars. However, political and economical strife have led to a recession that has affected the colonies the hardest. In order to deal with these issues, the multitude of Earth governments have united under the banner of the United Community of Earth (UCE). The UCE's existence has done nothing to prevent the organization of such rebel groups as White Fang and the Lunar Empire of Giganos. To that end, the UCE creates a special taskforce to quell such rebellions.<br/><br/>In order to deal with the energy crisis affecting the Earth Sphere, the UCE develops a new energy source called E2. Though powerful, E2 is also highly volatile, and many groups seek to steal it for their own purposes. Though most of the anime series' plots are followed faithfully, the most notable change is to Mobile Suit Gundam: Char's Counterattack. When Quattro Bajeena realizes how corrupt and self-serving the UCE government is, he leaves the taskforce. Later on, he resurfaces in his Char's Counterattack form, piloting the MSN-04 Sazabi, and leading an attack on Jaburo. Later, he attempts to ram the giant asteroid Axis through A Baoa Qu (as was done in Mobile Suit Zeta Gundam), but the attempt fails, and the two asteroids become stuck together. Unfazed, Char steals a large supply of E2 and sends it to Earth in a civilian shuttle. If the shuttle reaches Earth, it will cause an even greater cataclysm than Axis' impact would have intended. Char had the shuttle sent to Earth, along with a fleet of refugee ships sent under the auspices of Relena Peacecraft. Running low on time and realizing that their situation was grim either way, the heroes attacked the shuttles in an attempt to stop Char's E2 bomb. Though they succeeded in stopping the bomb, the incident caused the heroes to be labelled as traitors, and they were forced to go into hiding.<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;Another Century's Episode&quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "114081": {"statistics": {}, "name": "Another Century's Episode 2", "videogamemode": {"2422": "Local Multiplayer"}, "videogameversion": {"139321": "Japanese PlayStation 2 edition"}, "average": "0", "videogameseries": {"16771": "Another Century's Episode"}, "videogametheme": {"2264": "Science Fiction"}, "usersrated": "0", "videogamegenre": {"2147": "Action"}, "videogameplatform": {"4434": "PlayStation 2"}, "poll": {}, "description": "Another Century's Episode 2 (\u30a2\u30ca\u30b6\u30fc\u30bb\u30f3\u30c1\u30e5\u30ea\u30fc\u30ba\u30a8\u30d4\u30bd\u30fc\u30c9 2 Anaz\u0101 Senchur\u012bzu Epis\u014ddo Tsu), abbreviated as A.C.E.2, is a third-person mecha action video game produced by Banpresto and developed by From Software. It is the sequel to the popular 2005 game Another Century's Episode.<br/><br/>A.C.E.2 is not a direct sequel to its predecessor, as it involves its own original plot, as well as covering events that already happened in A.C.E., albeit differently. This is not an unusual occurrence, as Banpresto has done this with most entries in the Super Robot Wars franchise; most of the games in that series are not connected by an established continuity (exceptions include the Super Robot Wars Alpha games and the titles in the Super Robot Wars Classic Timeline), with remakes or updates abounding.<br/><br/>However, there are some links back to A.C.E. in the sequel. The Ark series, including the main character's Gunark, use as their power source the super-volatile substance E2, which was introduced in the first game. Additionally, most of the A.C.E. original enemies return, this time with a backstory, while in A.C.E. they were simply there to add to the challenge.<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;Another Century's Episode 2&quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "114082": {"statistics": {}, "name": "Another Century's Episode 3: The Final", "videogamemode": {"2422": "Local Multiplayer"}, "videogameversion": {"139322": "Japanese PlayStation 2 edition"}, "average": "0", "videogameseries": {"16771": "Another Century's Episode"}, "videogametheme": {"2264": "Science Fiction"}, "usersrated": "0", "videogamegenre": {"2147": "Action"}, "videogameplatform": {"4434": "PlayStation 2"}, "poll": {}, "description": "Another Century's Episode 3: The Final (\u30a2\u30ca\u30b6\u30fc\u30bb\u30f3\u30c1\u30e5\u30ea\u30fc\u30ba\u30a8\u30d4\u30bd\u30fc\u30c9 3 THE FINAL Anaz\u0101 Senchur\u012bzu Epis\u014ddo Sur\u012b The Final), abbreviated as A.C.E.3, is a mecha action video game produced by Banpresto and developed by From Software. It is the sequel to the popular 2006 game Another Century's Episode 2, and the third game in the Another Century's Episode series. It was released for the PlayStation 2 on September 6, 2007.<br/><br/>Although it has a &quot;The Final&quot; subtitle, it is not the final game entry of A.C.E. series, as after the announcement of Another Century's Episode R in PlayStation 3 platform in April 2010. &quot;The Final&quot; possibly means conclusion of A.C.E.1 to A.C.E.3's stories which connects each others.<br/><br/>A.C.E.3 is set three years after the events of A.C.E.2, between the final battle between the UCE and the Zentradi in A.C.E.2 (the antagonists of Macross), known as The First Defensive War. It also mentions that the UCE forces has been reformed into the Earth Federation forces. The game's overall plot deals with the sudden appearance of a second, war-torn Earth from which new and more deadly enemies emerge. At the same time, enemies who survived the First Defensive War begin reappearing on the original Earth, further complicating matters. The game is primarily divided between two sides with &quot;Earth Side A&quot; (the Earth in A.C.E.2), dealing with the stories for Endless Waltz, Char's Counterattack, Macross, Macross Plus, Dragonar, Wings of Rean and Prince of Darkness, while &quot;Earth Side B&quot; (the new, ruined Earth) involves the plots of Gundam X, Eureka Seven, Shin Getter Robo, and Overman King Gainer. The stories behind the remaining series (Gundam, Turn A Gundam, Gundam SEED, G Gundam, Dunbine, and Brain Powered) are not included (with the latter three's storyline get concluded in A.C.E.2), existing mainly to support the other series. Also, the storylines of Dragonar and Macross are given original treatments, as their main plots have been concluded in A.C.E.2; Endless Waltz only involves with a very brief appearance in certain route (while showing power eliminating hundreds of unit at an instant, through it cannot be seen).<br/><br/>The events of A.C.E.3 are mainly connected by a device called the Baldora Drive, which was originally planned as a teleportation device for outer space travel in Earth A and the invasion of the space colonies in Earth B. However, both sides abandoned the use of the Baldora Drive 18 years ago, but recently got back into service when they had the technology to repair it. Through this device, a wormhole is created in the space between the two Earths, which allows the protagonists to travel between them. However, as the wormhole expands due to the effect of the Baldora Charge (which is used to power the device) obtained from various sources of energy, it would eventually make the size of a wormhole large enough to make the two earths collide with one another, due to gravitational attraction, from which its final outcome will be the destruction of mankind. In order to stop this, heroes from both sides must ally together and find a way to stop the device, before the wormhole fully expands.<br/><br/>The primary battleships in A.C.E.3 are the Gekko from Eureka Seven and the Nadesico B from The Prince of Darkness, with the latter eventually being replaced by the Nadesico C as per the movie's plot. Tower, the main ship from Getter Robo, is also given lots of appearance in the game. The main ship of the Londo Bell (as well as the launching ship in A.C.E.), the Ra Cailum and its captain, Bright Noa, also appears in the game, but due to the death of Hirotaka Suzuoki (the voice actor for Bright) in 2006, most of his scenes in the game are simply cut out (and his voice mainly re-uses the recorded ones in A.C.E.).<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;Another Century's Episode 3&quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "114083": {"statistics": {}, "name": "RPGNow Downloader Monthly (Issue 1 - Dec 2002)", "rpgproducer": {"10543": "Brett M.

All of the games' cutscenes are shown in the style of a comic strip with speech bubbles. A prologue at the start of the game describes Lord Fear escaping from prison in the Sixth Dimension and stealing the Amulet, but is stopped by Ace and the following fight results in the shattering of the Amulet. Both individuals find a single piece of the Amulet and take there fight to the Carnival of Doom. Ace collects the Amulet pieces scattered around the carnival's nightmarish attractions, fighting such villains as Googler, Lady Illusion, Dirty Rat and his own friend Random Virus who suffers from multiple personality disorder and has two personalities, one good and one evil. Ace eventually confronts Lord Fear in the Haunted House, defeating him and his minions before sending them back to prison using the restored Amulet.<br/><br/>The PC and PlayStation 2 games are almost identical, the PlayStation 2 version having better graphics and two bonus levels. The gameplay for each level is to reach the end and collect an Amulet piece to continue the game. There are four distinct worlds, a circus, a funhouse owned by Lady Illusion, a wild west ghost town, and a medieval castle. The final world leads straight into a boss battle against Lord Fear and others. Each world has two or three levels that are unlocked one after the other, the last level ending with a boss battle against a specific antagonist (e.g. Lady Illusion, Googler, Dirty Rat, Random Virus), an Amulet piece appearing after they are defeated using a repeating technique. The Amulet piece at the end of the each level may only be gained after a task is completed, like defeating enemies or a boss, or collecting enough tokens called Doom Dimes.<br/><br/>Most of the game involves platform jumping or locating keys to new areas that appear as actual keys or as large activation buttons. Combat has two stages. First Ace Lightning will fight with a weapon called the Lightning Lance which can fire out lightning bolts or he can use it strike opponents. The lance has an energy bar which will eventually run out and Ace is forced to use his fists and wrist cannons for combat, his cannons capable of stunning an opponent for a period of time. Ace can power up the Lightning Lance by collecting lightning bolt symbols. When enemies are defeated, they leave behind energy balls that can also replenish the lance. Ace can also gain accessories for a period of time, including an energy drink to heal his life bar, the Shield of Justice which protects him with a force field, and an ability to double jump, as he is unable to fly in the games as he is shown to in the television series.<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;Ace Lightning (video game)&quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "114134": {"boardgamedesigner": {"17635": {"name": "Moc & Gianba"}}, "poll": {}, "name": "Pinocchio e il pesce parlante", "playingtime": "30", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": {"2041": "Card Drafting"}, "yearpublished": "1972", "usersrated": "1", "boardgamefamily": {"5607": "3D Games"}, "maxplayers": "4", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1207858_t.jpg", "average": "7", "statistics": {}, "boardgamepublisher": {"253": {"name": "Editrice Giochi"}}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1207858.jpg", "boardgameversion": {"139539": "First edition"}, "maxplaytime": "30", "boardgamecategory": {"1041": {"name": "Children's Game"}}, "age": "6", "minplaytime": "30", "description": "The game includes a 3D representation of the Pinocchio's world (the village and the sea with the whale).<br/>The players move their pawns to both the mainland and the sea trying to gain gold coins and, in the same time, trying to avoid the various hazards because a player could be eaten by the whale during the game.

At the end of the each level is a piece of the Amulet and a boss battle against an antagonist suited to the environment. The levels are based on attractions that are usually seen in an amusement park of small funfair (e.g. a ghost train, carousel, rollercoaster, etc.), the final level being the Haunted House where Lord Fear is battled.

Players have limited resources available and are faced with a choice between positioning balls for strategic effect; or stockpiling them to avoid forced moves later in the game.<br/><br/>Aim: The player who manages to create a string of 4 touching balls at any level visible as a straight line from directly above the board wins the game. In addition, if a player has no balls remaining in their stock and cannot legally remove a red ball they lose the game.<br/><br/>Rules: The board starts with twelve red balls placed around the perimeter of the board. Two players, White and Black, start the game with two balls of their colour in their &lsquo;stock&rsquo;, the remaining balls are kept in a central &lsquo;supply&rsquo;. A player's stock must not be hidden from their opponent.<br/><br/>Randomly determine a start player. On their turn a player must either:<br/><br/>- Place a ball on either an empty board hole or stack it on any 2x2 platform of existing balls, or<br/><br/>- Remove a red ball from the board returning it to the supply and move two balls of their colour from the supply to their stock.<br/><br/>The removal of red balls and placement of black and white balls follows Shibumi stacking in that balls may only stack on 2x2 platforms of existing balls and if a red ball is removed then any others that it supports will drop. A red ball that directly supports two or more on the level above is pinned and cannot be removed.<br/><br/>Managing the numbers of balls in your stock is vital for ensuring your opponent does not force you into making moves that do not improve your position. Running out of balls in your stock will force you to remove a red ball and give the opponent two consecutive placements: this becomes a progressively riskier tactic as the game develops.<br/><br/>THE SHIBUMI CHALLENGE<br/><br/>Sploof was created as part of the Shibumi Challenge and was judged to be the winning entry.<br/><br/>The Shibumi Challenge geeklist: Winners announced!<br/><br/>Included in the Shibumi Rule Book<br/><br/>Soft cover:<br/><br/><a target='_blank' href='http://www.lulu.com/shop/cameron-browne-and-nestor-romeral-andres/shibumi-rule-book/paperback/product-18940123.html' rel='nofollow'>http://www.lulu.com/shop/cameron-browne-and-nestor-romeral-a...</a><br/><br/>Downloadable PDF:<br/><br/><a target='_blank' href='http://www.nestorgames.com/rulebooks/SHIBUMI_EN.pdf' rel='nofollow'>http://www.nestorgames.com/rulebooks/SHIBUMI_EN.pdf</a><br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": {"139665": "First edition"}, "name": "Sploof", "playingtime": "15", "boardgamemechanic": {"2040": "Hand Management"}, "average": "7.12", "usersrated": "10", "boardgamesubdomain": {"4666": "Abstract Games"}, "boardgamefamily": {"5607": "3D Games"}}, "114189": {"poll": {}, "name": "'Over a Thousand' Question Quiz", "playingtime": "0", "minplayers": "2", "usersrated": "2", "yearpublished": "1969", "boardgameimplementation": {"2421": "Tell Me: The Grand Quiz Game"}, "maxplayers": "4", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1170628_t.jpg", "average": "3", "statistics": {}, "boardgamepublisher": {"782": {"name": "Peter Pan Playthings"}}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1170628.jpg", "boardgameversion": {"139666": "Peter Pan Playthings First Edition"}, "maxplaytime": "0", "boardgamecategory": {"1038": {"name": "Sports"}}, "age": "0", "minplaytime": "0", "description": "British game made by Peter Pan Playthings to compete with the Spear's game Tell Me: The Grand Quiz Game.

Roll for initiative. Both sides roll a single 6 sided dice the highest score wins initiative for that turn.<br/><br/>2. Place Agency Focus Marker. The winner of the initiative roll chooses one of the four Agency Focus Actions at the top of his side of the game board and moves his Agency Focus Marker from its agency home space to the chosen action space.

Both sides roll all of their available coloured Spy Dice. Dice that have been placed within the Kremlin or The White House during previous turns may not be rolled again and remain where they are until the end of that round. On turn one both players will have 3 dice to roll.<br/><br/>4. Agency Focus bonuses are applied. The chosen Agency Focus Bonus is applied to any one of the rolled Spy Dice, starting with the player who won initiative in step one.<br/><br/>5. Spies infiltrate places of power. Successful spies (those dice that scored a roll of 5 or 6 with any bonuses applied) are deemed to have successfully infiltrated their chosen place of power i.e. Kremlin for U.S. spies or The White House for soviet spies and are placed into the appropriate area on the game board.<br/><br/>6. Repeat steps 1 to 5. These steps are repeated 3 times or until either player has placed all 3 of his spies into the appropriate spy placement area. The first player to do this is deemed the winner of that round and moves his Event Marker one place closer to the Victory space. Players must raise DEFCON level by 1 if indicated by text above event track. If both players fail to place all 3 of their spies into their appropriate spy placement areas then an intelligence stalemate is declared and the DEFCON Marker is raised one level.<br/><br/>7. Return Spies and Agency Focus Markers. All 3 Spy Dice are returned to each player and the Agency Focus Markers are returned to their Agency Home Space ready for the next round.<br/><br/>8. Repeat steps 1 to 7 until one side places their Event Marker onto the Victory space and reads the printed outcome or until the DEFCON level reaches one indicating the start of a worldwide thermo nuclear war and both sides lose.<br/><br/>"}, "114196": {"rpg": {"6175": "Outbreak: Undead"}, "poll": {}, "name": "December 2011: The Safehouse", "rpgproducer": {"50805": "Christopher De La Rosa"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1170025.png", "usersrated": "0", "rpgitemversion": {"139675": "PDF version"}, "average": "0", "statistics": {}, "rpggenre": {"28957": "Horror (Zombies)"}, "rpgcategory": {"2108": "Sourcebook (rules/options to enhance play)"}, "rpgseries": {"11727": "Free Content Friday"}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1170025_t.png", "description": "From Introduction:<br/><br/>The Safehouse<br/><br/>The survivors decide to create a safehouse that can provide shelter should the characters get stranded outside their Stronghold.

You are placed in the role of the Commonwealth Commander in the theatre, and must utilize every resource at your disposal to fend off unrelenting Axis attacks in order to ensure the survival of the island of Malta.<br/><br/>Built upon the same States of Siege engine as the designer's previous 2010 Charles S. Roberts award-winning release (We Must Tell the Emperor), Malta Besieged features both familiar and innovative game play. Supply was the key element in the Mediterranean Campaign, and so it is here as well. Players will have to safely shepherd vulnerable convoys - and their valuable cargoes - in order to effectively wage war. With the ability to trade Supply for extra Actions at the most crucial moments, this places an additional emphasis on that precious resource and also creates extremely tense convoy battles which will resolve as the game progresses.<br/><br/>ULTRA is a crucial asset in the game, but beware of Axis counterintelligence! Spitfires can rule the skies, Gibraltar can block U-Boat advances, Operation Herkules is a constant threat, and Admiral Cunningham himself can intervene on occasion.<br/><br/>North Africa is not treated as a mere sideshow; indeed, the struggle with Rommel, the &quot;Desert Fox&quot;, holds the ultimate key to victory... if Malta can hold out against the constant pressure. If a fortified Tobruk manages to stubbornly delay the vaunted Afrika Korps long enough, then General Montgomery and his battle-tested 8th Army can possibly make a final dash from El Alamein to capture Tripoli and secure a glorious triumph.<br/><br/>Raiding Axis supply lines to weaken Rommel's Situation, scrambling Hurricanes to provide Air Support for inbound shipping, attacking the Italians early before the dreaded Luftwaffe arrives, requesting British Fleet escort for your individually named convoys, and maintaining the morale of a battered Malta are just some of the important decisions to be made throughout the game. Numerous theatre-wide events such as The Fall of France, O'Connor's desert offensive, the daring raid on the Italian Fleet at Taranto, the Air Assault on Crete, the evacuation from Greece, the sinking of the aircraft carrier Ark Royal, and the Torch landings are all abstracted via card play, and can have a significant impact on the overall conduct of the war.<br/><br/>With That Scorpion of the Sea: Malta Besieged, it's all here - the only question is will you have the wisdom, leadership, fortitude, and luck to prevail?

The book you hold in your hands is a door, leading to the strange and dangerous world of Yeld. You and your friends can use this door to explore the dark forests and drowned castles of Yeld, to trade your childish ways for the strengths of a hero and to face off against the vampire prince Dragul and his mysterious Hunters of Yeld. All great adventures have a cost, but the price of this one is low. All this game requires of you and your friends is your time, creativity and attention, and a little bit of reading. Few adventures ask for so little.<br/><br/>The Magical Land of Yeld is a fantasy adventure game for all ages. By that I mean it's a game that can be enjoyed by both children and adults. Nick and I are trying to tap the feel of classic adventure role-playing video games that we enjoyed as a kids (Final Fantasy 2, Legend of Zelda and Secret of Mana) and young adult oriented adventure anime we enjoy now (Full Metal Alchemist, One Piece, InuYashu). So what you get out of this game, what you get to do, is be a group of kids from our world that discover a magical door that leads to the strange, dark, dangerous land of Yeld. At first you'll be able to explore Yeld and safely return home. But eventually the door home will close, and you'll be trapped! Once you become trapped in Yeld you'll take Heroic Jobs and set out on an adventure to find hidden temples, defeat the Hunters of Yeld and win the magical keys to unlock the door back to the real world. You know how this works, right? It's like Final Fantasy + Alice in Wonderland, or The Legend of Zelda mashed up with Narnia.<br/><br/>Of course that's not what the game is about. That's what you'll be doing while you play the game. The Magical Land of Yeld is about growing up, putting aside childish things and becoming the hero that you were meant to be. Each of us will take the role of a child from our world who finds their inner strengths and becomes a hero in Yeld. We'll take turns at the role of Game Master, directing the game and creating stories for our friends. Together we'll tell the story of how we discovered the magical door to Yeld, became trapped in that land, took on the responsibilities and duties of heroes and faced off against Dragul and the Hunters of Yeld to win back our freedom and find our way home!<br/><br/>Hey, welcome to Yeld!<br/><br/>"}, "114404": {"boardgamedesigner": {"9817": {"name": "Jeremiah Lee"}}, "poll": {}, "name": "Zombie Rush", "playingtime": "30", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": {"2040": "Hand Management"}, "yearpublished": "2012", "boardgameimplementation": {"137156": "Zombie House Blitz"}, "usersrated": "1", "maxplayers": "6", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1176577_t.png", "average": "1", "statistics": {}, "boardgamepublisher": {"1001": {"name": "(Web published)"}}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1176577.png", "boardgameversion": {"140053": "Print and Play edition"}, "maxplaytime": "30", "boardgamecategory": {"1120": {"name": "Print & Play"}}, "age": "8", "minplaytime": "30", "description": "You didn't have time to get ready, didn't have time to make sure everyone could get out of the house.

Each family member left in the house, or dead is worth -1 point.<br/><br/>Players can use their escape routes to get people out of the house before they finally make their escape into the central scoring area. Players place vehicle cards in the center to start piles of escaping family members (the number on the card must go up one each time you place a new family member on the pile).<br/><br/>When zombies appear, they eat whoever is next to them in the deck, but if you've equipped one of the members of your family with a shotgun, you can put the zombie in the dead pile (with any already-dead family members) and save a life.<br/><br/>Plays from 2-6 players, plays best with 3-6. Each round takes about 5-10 minutes, with a full game (to 60 points) playing in about 30 minutes.<br/><br/>Expands, Re-themes, Re-implements:<br/><br/>     Ligretto<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Zombie Rush is nearly language independent. If you know the word 'shotgun', you're in good shape.

Sp&auml;ter sicherten sich valianische Siedler den Reichtum der W&auml;lder, und waelische Seer&auml;uber errichteten an den K&uuml;sten ihre St&uuml;tzpunkte, w&auml;hrend die Zwerge des Artross verbissen ihre Unabh&auml;ngigkeit verteidigten. Zuletzt kamen die Clans aus dem geheimnisvollen Toquine und formten aus all diesen Einfl&uuml;ssen ein neues Reich: Alba.<br/><br/>F&uuml;r Clan und Krone: dieser Wahlspruch spiegelt den Zwiespalt wider, in dem das albische Volk lebt und der immer wieder Anla&szlig; f&uuml;r Streit bietet - von Machtk&auml;mpfen im Hohen Rat &uuml;ber heimt&uuml;ckische Intrigen und Meuchelmorde bis zur offenen und blutigen Fehde. Alter Clanadel widersetzt sich den vom K&ouml;nig ernannten neuen Feudalherren, machtbewu&szlig;te Kirchenf&uuml;rsten neiden der Bruderschaft des Tr&auml;umers ihren Einflu&szlig;, reiche St&auml;dte streben nach mehr Unabh&auml;ngigkeit, und alle buhlen um die Gunst des noch minderj&auml;hrigen K&ouml;nigs - oder hoffen auf seinen vorzeitigen Tod.<br/><br/>Doch nicht nur die Streitigkeiten der M&auml;chtigen bietet Stoff f&uuml;r Abenteuer. Abseits der St&auml;dte und der wohlhabenden F&uuml;rstent&uuml;mer gibt es noch viele wilde und ungez&auml;hmte Orte in Alba - in der Einsamkeit des Hochlandes und der S&uuml;mpfe, in den schroffen Grenzgebirgen und in den Tiefen des Waldes, vor allem des Zauberwaldes Broceliande mit seinen Elfenreichen und seinen dunklen, von wilder Magie verseuchten Winkeln. Dort k&ouml;nnen sich fahrende Ritter und heldenm&uuml;tige Abenteurer mit Geistern wie der Grona oder den Hohlmenschen, mit Ungeheuern wie den Seeoger oder dem Sumpfkraken und mit Unholden wie dem Trollk&ouml;nig, dem Riesen von Maedenstor oder der Schwarzen Annis messen und so selbst Teil der vielen Sagen und Mythen werden, die die Barden an den albischen H&ouml;fen erz&auml;hlen.<br/><br/>Dieses Quellenbuch erh&auml;lt Hintergundmaterial zur schottisch-normannischen Kultur Midgards. Neben der Beschreibung von Land und Leuten, ihren Sitten und Gebr&auml;uchen und ihrem Glauben beinhaltet das Buch landestypische Abenteurer und magische Artefakte, wichtige Pers&ouml;nlichkeiten, ein ausf&uuml;hrliches Bestiarium, eine Farbkarte Albas sowie ein umfangreiches Kapitel &uuml;ber das Halfdal und die Lebensweise der Halblinge Midgards.<br/><br/><br/>Translation:<br/><br/>In olden times the druid kings of the D&ucirc;natha fought here side by side with elves and dwarves against the forces of chaos. Later Valian settlers secured the wealth of the forests, and waelian pirates built their bases on the coasts, while the dwarfs of the Artross fiercely defended their independence. Finally, the clans came from the mysterious Toquin and formed from all these influences, a new realm: Alba.<br/><br/>For Clan and Crown: this motto reflects the discord in the lives of the albian people that always provides the occasion for controversy - of struggles for power in the council, over treacherous intrigues and assassinations to open and bloody feud. Old clan nobility opposes the new feudal lords appointed by the king, powerful princes of the church envy the Brotherhood of the dreamer its influence, rich cities strive for more independence, and all compete for the favor of the king still underage - or hope to his premature death.<br/><br/>But not only disputes of the powerful features material for adventures. Away from the cities and the wealthy principalities there are many wild and untamed places in Alba - in the solitude of the highlands and swamps, in the rugged border mountains, and in the depths of the forest, especially the magic forest Broceliande his elven kingdoms and his dark corners, contaminated by wild magic. There knights errant and heroic adventurers can compete against ghosts as the Grona or the hollow man, with monsters like the Seeoger or swamp octopus and villains such as the Troll King, the giant of Maedenstor or Black Annis and thus become part of the many legends and myths the bards will tell at the albian courts.<br/><br/>This source book contains background material for Midgards Scots-Norman culture. Besides the description of land and its people, their habits and customs and their beliefs, the book contains typical adventurers and magical artifacts, important personalities, a detailed bestiary, a color map of Alba, and an extensive chapter on the Halfdal and the lifestyle of the Halflings of Midgard.<br/><br/>"}, "114417": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1214724.jpg", "poll": {}, "boardgamedesigner": {"2": {"name": "Reiner Knizia"}}, "statistics": {}, "yearpublished": "2009", "maxplayers": "5", "boardgameartist": {"11825": "Michael Menzel"}, "boardgamepublisher": {"34": {"name": "Ravensburger Spieleverlag GmbH"}}, "maxplaytime": "30", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1214724_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "30", "boardgamecategory": {"1089": {"name": "Animals"}}, "description": "The animals bring gifts to the party with and the players have to remember exactly who brought what gift, and who owns what hat.

It is played on the intersections (points) of an odd-sized square board. The suggested sizes are 11&times;11 for experienced players and 9&times;9 for beginners. At the start of the game, Black and White pieces are arranged in an interspersed pattern (see images). The total number of pieces is equal to half the points in the board.<br/><br/><br/>Definitions<br/><br/>In these rules, &quot;adjacent&quot; always means &quot;orthogonally adjacent&quot;.<br/><br/>A unit is a singleton or group. A singleton is a piece with no adjacencies to like-colored pieces. A group is a set of like-colored, adjacent pieces.<br/><br/><br/>Play<br/><br/>Black plays first, then turns alternate. On each turn, players must do one of the following actions:<br/><br/><br/>     Move a friendly singleton to an adjacent empty point.<br/><br/><br/><br/>     Take a piece from a friendly group and place it on a different empty point adjacent to the same group. All pieces which were joined in a single group before the move must remain joined after the move.<br/><br/><br/>Every move must reduce the distance between the moved unit and the closest friendly unit. The distance between two units is the shortest path of adjacent empty points between them, i.e. the number of consecutive moves one would need to join them.<br/><br/>If a player can't make a move on his turn, he wins. This usually occurs when said player has joined all his pieces in a single group.<br/><br/>If a board position is repeated with the same player to move, the game ends in a draw. This is known to be a theoretical possibility if both players cooperate to it, which doesn't happen in actual play.<br/><br/>The pie rule can be used in order to balance the game.<br/><br/><br/>Notes<br/><br/>An essential part of the strategy lies in building long walls between enemy units, thus forcing the opponent to spend many more turns connecting them. Also, playing from the outside inwards is more efficient, as it helps you not to leave any units behind. The distance rule has some interesting tactical effects: sometimes, in order to move a unit (A) in the desired direction, you'll have to first move away the unit (B) which is closest to it so that A isn't &quot;engaged&quot; to B anymore.<br/><br/>Ayu is arguably the quintessential game of approach moves. The rules have been kept to a minimum so as to let the featured mechanism unfold by itself. The result is a very organic and innovative game with great strategic potential.<br/><br/>&quot;Ayu&quot; is short for &quot;Attach Your Units&quot;.<br/><br/>"}, "114485": {"statistics": {}, "name": "Sudden Attack", "videogamemode": {"2313": "Cooperative"}, "videogameversion": {"140251": "North America Windows edition"}, "average": "0", "videogametheme": {"2317": "War - Modern"}, "usersrated": "0", "videogamegenre": {"2160": "First Person Shooter"}, "videogameplatform": {"4977": "Windows"}, "poll": {}, "description": "Sudden Attack delivers one thing: Pure Online FPS Action.

The era of the Roman Republic and early Empire was a time of great military conflict. This period saw the Civil Wars of Julius Caesar, Pompey the Great, Augustus and Marc Antony, as well as Caesar's conquest of Gaul, Crassus' disastrous expedition against the Parthians, and Rome's push over the RhineRiver and into Germania.<br/> It was in these wars that the Imperial Roman army would be forged. The basic legionary unit was the cohort, supported by various auxiliary forces.<br/><br/>The First Triumvirate, 59 BC - 53 BC, saw Caesar, Pompey and Crassus divide the Roman world among themselves. But this fell apart with the death of Crassus at the battle of Carrhae against the Parthians. Caesar and Pompey then fought for supreme power, 49 BC - 44 BC. Caesar triumphed, but following his assassination the second Triumvirate of Octavian, Lepidus and Mark Anthony ruled the Republic from 43 - 33 BC.<br/> The Triumvirate soon fell out among themselves and another civil war was in the offing. The decisive battle of Actium in 31 BC saw Octavian defeat Mark Anthony and become the first of the emperors as Augustus. Octavian consolidated the frontiers and expanded Rome's domain in to Germania. In 9 AD the German disaster of Teutoburger Forest resulted in the destruction of three Roman Legions and temporarily halted Rome&rsquo;s expansion.<br/> So ended a century of warfare, the momentous effects of which are still with us to the present day.<br/><br/>In Roman Civil Wars, you take command.
