Your Task Forces consits of surface ships, submarines, patrol aircraft and tactical fast jet aircraft, represented by data cards, and task force counters on the map. You utilize radar, sonar and visual search to detect your enemy task forces. You utilize naval gunfire, surface-to-surface missiles, and air-to-surface missiles to defeat them, using die-rolls and data cards. The game is easy to learn. It is a wargame, but the heavily themed weapon aspects are abstracted to a very basic level, without loosing it's high technology appeal.

Allied players can fly the game's namesakes, the F4U-1 Corsair and F6F Hellcat, as well as the British Firefly, the P47-N, and the P-61 Black Widow. Japanese players can counter with two models of late war Zero, the Ki-84 Frank, the N1K1 George, and the J2M Jack. New bomber types include the TBF Avenger, the B-29 Superfortress, and the Ki-49 Helen. There's even a new kind of bomber: the Attack Bomber, which can strafe and bomb. Two types are present in Corsair &amp; Hellcats: the B-25C-1 field modification and the solid nose B-25J, which carried a dozen (!) fixed forward-firing .50 caliber machine guns.<br/><br/>All of these aircraft (plus many of the ones in Zero!) are used in seven new campaigns. Eastern Solomons and Santa Cruz are carrier campaigns like those pioneered in Zero!. Solomon Islands, Philippines 1944, and Okinawa use the land campaign structure familiar to players of the previous games in the series. The other two campaigns are quite different, though. Guadalcanal models the drawn out struggle for control of the airspace above that island. Players allocate available aircraft to two missions each week in an attempt to force a withdrawal by their opponent. The campaign also includes the option to play the Eastern Solomons and Santa Cruz campaigns as part of the battle, feeding the results of the carrier encounters back into the main campaign. B-29s in China is a solitaire campaign representing the beginning of the strategic bombing offensive against Japan. The player controls three Superfortresses and must balance their activities between training, carrying supplies, repairing damage, and conducting bombing missions.<br/><br/>In addition, Corsairs &amp; Hellcats includes new target types, skilled pilots, and ordnance. The game also has rules for Kamikazes, supply drops, submarines, and mine laying. There's even a new method of selecting skilled (and green) pilots and crews that reflects the changes in aircrew quality that both sides went through during the course of the war.

The selection of a small scenario allows the novice to play within an hour of opening the box, with several scenarios also being optimal for solitaire play.<br/><br/>Rules come punched for a three ringed binder (not provided) for ease of use and photocopying. They follow the same format as our other rules used in the Trilogy, making them easy to follow for experienced gamers, and novices alike. Tactical turns represent 3 minutes, with intermediate turns (for long distance maneuvering and long stern chases) representing 30 minutes. Gun hit probability is based upon a combination of factors such as visibility, range, target size, number of rounds firing at the target, and speeds of the firing and target platforms. Damage is a function of the type of shell, number of barrels firing and armor of target, and is easy to calculate also. Blank ship forms allow the player to list all the ranges and damages of his ship's particular guns in advance, making it quick and easy to calculate both damage and hit probability. Critical damage is a function of the amount of damage taken last round vs. the amount of damage able to be taken. Critical hits typically scored against systems (engineering, bridge, steering or individual weapon amounts).<br/><br/>The 40+ scenarios include the well known &quot;biggies&quot; such as Jutland (broken into three parts, as well as the grand battle) and Dogger Bank, and many smaller engagements. Often there are variants given, covering important &quot;almosts&quot; and &quot;what ifs&quot;. All aspects are covered, with ships provided for the Japanese, Turkish, Austrian, and Russian navies as well as the British and German fleets.

Munchkin Fu is completely compatible with the entire Munchkin line.<br/><br/><br/>Other<br/><br/>Part of the Munchkin series.<br/><br/>Munchkin is a satirical card game based on the clich&eacute;s and oddities of Dungeons and Dragons and other role-playing games. Each player starts at level 1 and the winner is the first player to reach level 10. Players can acquire familiar D&amp;D style character classes during the game which determine to some extent the cards they can play.<br/><br/>There are two types of cards - treasure and encounters. Each turn the current players 'kicks down the door' - drawing an encounter card from the deck. Usually this will involve battling a monster.

World War II in the West was originally designed for play with Axis and Allies figures and rule, but is now a stand-alone game which includes over 1,600 counters. However, the rules and the hex sizes still allow Axis and Allies fans to get the most accurate World War II wargame they can find while still using the popular rules and pieces if they wish.<br/><br/>In fact, World War II in the West can be used effectively to bring Axis and Allies fans into the wargaming hobby as the game combines some of the features of Axis and Allies and conventional counter wargames to produce a new style of game that is simple yet complex, fun yet challenging.<br/><br/>With World War II in the West, you fight for the convoy routes, have air battles over London, conduct landing operations on the northern French coast, outflank and surround forces on the Eastern Front, and manage the industrial output of your nation.<br/><br/>World War II in the West includes over 1,600 counters depicting the armed forces of the major belligerents as well as informational counters needed to play the game. Along with the major nations, you can find in the counter mix Canadian, Australian, New Zealander, South African, Czech, Indian, and East African units, as well as the well-known Spanish Blue Division that fought on the Eastern Front with the German Army.<br/><br/>The beautifully hand-drawn map is made up of 12-pieces, totalling a size of 50 by 40 inches. Also included is a smaller East African map to be used in play. The map has all of the charts and boxes needed for game play and has a scale of approximately 150km per hex. The hexes are large enough to hold Axis and Allies pieces, but it is ideally played with the counters that are sized to decrease mess and accidents during play.<br/><br/>The game is best played with the grand campaign which runs from September 1939 until the end of 1945, in monthly and bi-weekly turns. Two scenarios are included with the game allowing you to play the war in Africa or Operation Overlord in a shorter time than the campaign game. Also, new scenarios will be posted on the website.<br/> World War II in the West&rsquo;s complexity is what sets it apart. It sets it apart from the other Axis and Allies games as the complexity is far greater and the history  more accurate. It also sets it apart from the conventional  counter wargames as its complexity is slightly more simple, yet still depicts the war accurately while being fun and challenging. This is not a simple game, but its complexity allows both experienced and beginner wargamers to understand the rules and enjoy the game.<br/><br/>World War II in the West can be combined with World War II in the East to play the entire global war, both games combining to use over 2,500 counters and 25 square feet of maps!<br/><br/>"}, "6659": {"boardgamedesigner": ["(Uncredited)"], "poll": [], "name": "Harry Potter Casting Stone Game", "playingtime": "20", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": ["Dice Rolling", "Rock-Paper-Scissors", "Set Collection", "Variable Player Powers"], "yearpublished": "2001", "usersrated": "35", "boardgamefamily": ["Harry Potter"], "maxplayers": "2", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic873271_t.jpg", "average": "4.03854", "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["Mattel"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic873271.jpg", "boardgameversion": ["Mattel starter game"], "maxplaytime": "20", "boardgamecategory": ["Children's Game", "Collectible Components", "Fantasy", "Movies / TV / Radio theme", "Novel-based"], "age": "8", "minplaytime": "20", "description": "Essentially a board game version of &quot;Paper-Scissors-Rock,&quot; Casting Stones uses a &quot;Spells-Potions-Charms&quot; hierarchy for competition between players.

It is played with one or more decks of cards - I play with a shoe box of old, partly complete packs :)<br/><br/>There the similarities end:<br/><br/>1. If you only have one card left, you have to say 'Bartok'. If you don't, you get your hand made back up to maximum.<br/><br/>2. Most other rules violations require you to take one or more cards.<br/><br/>3. Players aren't allowed to ask questions during a game. Ask a question, take a card. This is most entertaining when someone comes along and asks 'What are you playing?'. They'll usually get a card, and then several more when they don't say Bartok.<br/><br/>4. This is the doozy: A player that successfully gets rid of his last card is deemed the winner for that round, and gets to make a new rule, which overrides any later rules. These can be as simple or as brain-hurty as you like. Usually the game gets harder as it progresses, as rules feed off each other and make lethal feedback loops.<br/><br/>5. Some example rules, to give you an idea of the flavor of the game:<br/><br/>When a change of suit changes color, play direction reverses. (easy)<br/>When a two is played, play skips a player. (easy)<br/>Threes don't exist. (somewhat metaphysical)<br/>When a black ace is played, each player must slap a card face down in the middle of the table. The last player to do so takes all of the other cards. (moderate, more of a wakey wakey rule)<br/>When a black queen is played, all of the cards increment their values by one, with kings wrapping to become aces. Red queens decrement the values by one. (somewhat mind numbing)<br/>Prime numbered cards swap to become the suit of the same colour - ie. clubs &lt;-&gt; spades, diamonds &lt;-&gt; hearts. (brain hurty, especially when combined with the rule above)<br/><br/>Any rule disputes are usually settled by voting.<br/><br/>You play until you're bored, or until someone creates a win condition and manages to achieve it.<br/><br/>SURGEON-GENERAL'S WARNING: Do not play this game with mathematicians :)<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": ["Public Domain edition"], "name": "Bartok", "playingtime": "120", "boardgamemechanic": ["Hand Management", "Memory"], "average": "7.00417", "usersrated": "24", "boardgamesubdomain": ["Abstract Games"], "boardgamefamily": ["Card Games: Matching Games", "Card Games: Outplay Games", "Shedding Games", "Traditional Card Games"]}, "6729": {"boardgamedesigner": ["(Uncredited)"], "poll": [], "name": "North to Alaska", "playingtime": "45", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": ["Dice Rolling", "Roll / Spin and Move"], "yearpublished": "1984", "usersrated": "21", "maxplayers": "8", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic26898_t.jpg", "average": "5.32143", "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["Herbert Law, Inc"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic26898.jpg", "boardgameversion": ["Herbert Law Deluxe Edition"], "maxplaytime": "45", "boardgamecategory": ["Adventure"], "age": "8", "minplaytime": "45", "description": "A Roll-and-Move travel boardgame that was apparently released in 1984 as a promotion for Yukon Sam Rest Stops.<br/><br/>Up to eight players attempt to successfully navigate the Alaska-Canada Highway from Seattle, Washington to Anchorage, Alaska.

Facing matters when attacking, but range only matters if one potential target is closer than another.<br/>When a die attacks: if its Attack value is greater than the target's Defense value, the target die is destroyed and the player scores its point value. If the Attack Value is lower (even an Attack of 1 agains the Ogre's 40+), the target shifts one side (effectively losing 1 of its 1d8 hit points).<br/>Instead of attacking, a die can move, rotating on its edge for a better firing position or to expose a better face. The Ogre can both fire and then move, making it hard to kill.<br/>If the Defender can get several dice on the table, they have a Command Post which can activate every die, bringing the Ogre down quickly. The Ogre also has a 'systems card' like the old Steve Jackson game, allowing its weapons and treads to be attacked.<br/>The winner is the first to score 50 points; the Ogre is worth 50 points and the Command Post isn't worth any (destroying it is not the goal).<br/><br/>List of Diceland sets and armies<br/><br/>Related to the Ogre/GEV Family.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": ["English edition"], "average": "6.52409", "name": "Diceland: Ogre", "playingtime": "10", "boardgamemechanic": ["Action Point Allowance System", "Dice Rolling", "Hand Management", "Variable Player Powers"], "age": "10", "usersrated": "94", "boardgamesubdomain": ["Thematic Games"], "boardgamefamily": ["Diceland Series", "Ogre/GEV Family"]}, "6751": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic359297.jpg", "poll": [], "boardgamedesigner": ["Glenn Drover"], "statistics": [], "yearpublished": "2003", "maxplayers": "6", "boardgameartist": ["Paul Niemeyer"], "boardgamepublisher": ["Eagle-Gryphon Games"], "maxplaytime": "180", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic359297_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "180", "boardgamecategory": ["Expansion for Base-game", "Miniatures", "Negotiation", "Political", "Wargame", "World War II"], "description": "From the publisher's web site:<br/><br/>Attack! Expansion will add quite a bit of detail while retaining playability.  Players will be able to choose from many new options including (They will get 3 per turn): Moving Military Units, Playing Political Cards, Attempting a Diplomatic Blitz, Beginning a Trade Route Auction, Purchasing Units, Researching a New Technology, Trading with another Player, or a Strategic Move (Land, Sea, or Air).<br/><br/>Politics: Each player nation and each minor nation will have one of the four political affiliations: Fascist, Monarchy, Democracy, or Communism. Political cards will allow the players to influence the minor nations governments with propaganda, or even overthrow them in an attempt to install a friendly government that they can then influence to join their &quot;sphere&quot;. Other diplomatic cards will allow players to spy on each other or perform various internal political actions.<br/><br/>Trade Routes: Players will be able to bid on Trade Route cards. The highest bidder gets the card. Trade cards act just like any other economic card, except they are &quot;wild cards&quot; and may be used to create sets. They also usually have higher than normal economic values. The downside to Trade Route cards is that they may be blocked or destroyed by blockades or Submarine warfare.<br/><br/>Technology: After the initial expansion, players usually begin to build alliances and the wars begin. Having a technology that gives you an advantage on the battlefield is critical. Players may spend an action (and money) attempting to develop a special technology.<br/><br/>Oil: Oil also takes on its historical importance in Attack! Expansion. Every time a player moves tank, air, or naval units, they must spend oil units from their reserve. The oil reserve may only be replenished when oil cards are used to do so rather than used in a player's economy that turn.<br/><br/>Attack! and Attack!

It is aimed at those game players who enjoy rules that are very simple and easy to get into. The game is not intended to be a simulation of the era, but immerses the players in the flavor of the period.<br/><br/>Gameplay:<br/>Each player starts with a few regions (one of which is his capital), and a few military units. Players expand their power bases by adding regions to their &quot;sphere of influence&quot;. This may be done either through diplomacy (they join willingly), or military conquest (they join, period).<br/><br/>There are three major sub-games in Attack!:<br/>1) Land Combat: A simple system where each unit has certain advantages based on its historical role.<br/><br/>2) Sea Combat: A simple system where each ship type (Battleship, Carrier, Destroyer, and Sub) has certain advantages based on its historical role.<br/><br/>3) Economic: A simple system determines production. The player starts with one card per region owned, and then gets a new one for each new region added. The cards come in four basic flavors (suites): Resources, Factories, Transport Network, and Oil. Each card has a value printed on it that represents the base economic value of that region. If the player is able to create an entire &quot;set&quot; (one of each suite), he doubles the printed value on those cards. There is also a fifth type of card which has a minimum value of &quot;1&quot; that represents a region without any special economic value (just &quot;population&quot;).<br/><br/>The units include: Infantry, Tank, Artillery, and Air. These are high quality plastic minis, which come in two sizes: regular for only one unit and slightly larger for groups of five.<br/>The map shows the world circa 1935 centered around the Atlantic (North and South America, Europe, and Africa).

Players try to contribute the most to the land of Zarahemla by building settlements, cities, roads, and helping construct the temple.

Players collect these resources (cards) - wood, grain, brick, sheep, or stone - to build up their civilizations to get to 12 victory points and win the game.<br/><br/>Game play is similar to Settlers of Catan, but players can add a stone to the temple by paying one brick and one stone.  The player who contributes the most stones gains 2 extra victory points.<br/><br/>A turn consists of possibly playing a development card, rolling the dice, everyone collecting any resource cards based on the roll and position of settlements (or upgraded cities) unless a 7 is rolled, turning in resource cards (if possible and desired) for improvements, trading cards at a port, and trading resource cards with other players. If a 7 is rolled, the active player moves the robber to a new hex tile and steals resource cards from other players who have built structures adjacent to that tile.<br/><br/>Points are accumulated by building settlements and cities, having the longest road and the largest army (from some of the development cards), from having made the biggest contribution to building the Zarahemla temple, and gathering certain development cards that simply award victory points.

Then, you put your R2 unit in the droid control center and the rebel in the hanger bay.  Then place the stormtrooper in the Stormtrooper control center.  You then take 6 explosives and place them near you.  You also shuffle and deal out the Rebel Mission Card.  This tells you the rooms you need to plant explosives in and the key cards you need to obtain to enter the inner level.  You then start the VHS tape.

The game is based on Schafkopf, Ombre (bidding) and Tarock (remaining cards). The latest revision of rules as approved by both the International Skat Players Association (ISPA) and the German Skat Association (DSkV) dates back to 1998.<br/><br/>A play comprises two phases: first an intricate bidding process to decide the solo player who choses the type of game to be played in the second phase, the actual playing of tricks. If he wins (takes more than half the total worth of cards in the game), the solo player alone will score points equal to the announced type of game and other modifiers (listed below); otherwise, the other two players will each score the double amount of these points. Both the bid and the final score depend on <br/><br/>     type of game announced<br/>     combination of Jacks<br/>     margin of winning (score 90+: &quot;schneider&quot;; score 120: &quot;schwarz&quot;)<br/>     (optional) declaration of margin of winning before the first trick is played <br/>     (optional) open play of cards<br/>     (optional) play with the initial hand (&quot;hand&quot; play)<br/>     (optional) doubling of scoring value: *2 (&quot;Kontra&quot;); re-doubling *4 (&quot;Re&quot;); inofficial rules allow re-doubling ad infinitum<br/>     exeption for the Ramsch variant including sub-variants: Highest total worth of cards taken as tricks is scored negatively; the score is doubled when one other player took no trick (&quot;virgin&quot;), also doubled for each passing of the remaining cards without exchanging, if the drafting Ramsch variant is applied (&quot;geschoben&quot;); a player may also try to &quot;shoot the moon&quot; by taking all tricks (consequently scores +120 alone when successful).<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>The solo player can choose between the following game modes:<br/><br/>     Suit (one suit and Jacks are trumps)<br/>     Grand (only Jacks are trumps)<br/>     Null (no trumps, solo player only wins without tricks). <br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Inofficial variants:<br/><br/>     The most popular variant is Ramsch, which is applied when no player bids for the solo. This game mode punishes players who likely avoid the risk of successfully bidding for the solo with an only mediocre, but possible hand. It follows the rules for Grand, but highest score loses (no partnerships!). Due to the sometimes extraorinarily high (negative) scores, Ramsch plays may strongly distort a player's total scoring for the evening, and is therefore not officially sanctioned.<br/>     Revolution (in three variants): bascially a Null in open play, but the counterplayers are allowed to exchange cards.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Skat gained nation wide popularity and a major development of its mechanisms in the course of the first world war. The game as it is today is a result of constant modification and refinement by countless players in the trenches of the German Western front. The current form of bidding with ascending numbers prevailed among the players, and many inofficial variants were introduced. Though first rejected by the Skat association, a lot of the so-called &quot;trench rules&quot; later became officially sanctioned.<br/><br/>The official turnament deck is a compomise that solved another dispute between the German and the International Skat Association by combining the colours of a German Suit (predominantly found in Southern and East Germany, Switzerland, Austria) with the symbols of a French Suit (predominant elsewhere in the regions where Skat is popular, foremost Northern and West Germany).<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "3", "boardgameversion": ["Amigo German Edition 2013", "ASS  German Edition", "ASS Altenburg Couer Edition", "ASS Deutsche Spitzenqualit\u00e4t Edition", "ASS Deutsches Bild Club Edition", "ASS Deutsches Bild Miniature Edition", "ASS e.dis Energie Edition", "ASS Edition", "ASS Edition", "ASS Edition", "ASS Edition", "ASS first edition", "ASS fozzie bear edition", "ASS Frederick the Great Edition", "ASS German Comic Elephants Edition", "ASS German Edition", "ASS German Edition 1985", "ASS German Green Half Edition", "ASS German Landmarks Edition", "ASS German Pink Edition", "ASS German Red Edition", "ASS German Yellow Edition", "ASS Green 'Die Echten' Edition", "ASS Half Green Club Edition", "ASS Hamburg Edition", "ASS Hamburg edition artist's name edition", "ASS Joker Range Blue Edition", "ASS number 200 edition", "ASS number 49 edition", "ASS Oval cards edition", "ASS Preu\u00dfisches Doppelbild Edition", "ASS Promo for Berentzen Edition", "ASS Prussian Pattern Edition", "ASS S\u00e4chs.

Players move around the board, buying and selling stock shares in hopes of creating a profit for themselves so that they can make even bigger investments later on.  Stock prices are always determined by a dice-roll, so prices move up and down quickly and randomly.  Certain &quot;safe&quot; stocks don't move around in price that much and offer higher dividends, while riskier stocks are much more volatile, but tend to offer higher returns.  The challenge is for each individual player to determine how much money he/she can afford to risk in any particular situation since an unlucky dice roll can wipe that player out.<br/><br/>There is also a simple, yet elegant means of borrowing money in this game.  Players are allowed to borrow money from the bank as long as they pay back double the borrowed amount by the time that his/her token completes two full turns around the board.  This helps to make the game more strategic since players will often find themselves in need of extra cash which they can only borrow with a pretty high interest penalty.<br/><br/>Overall, RAGS TO RICHES is a nice blend of strategy and luck (probably 70% strategy, 30% luck).

The first reference about this game goes back to 1745, when Don Manuel de Larramendi, philologist and Jesuit basque, quoted it in the trilingual dictionary (Basque-Spanish-Latin).<br/><br/>It is played by two opposing pairs of players with the Spanish deck, which is a deck of 40 cards without eights or nines and no jokers. Usually all 4 &quot;3&quot; cards count as kings and all four &quot;2&quot; cards count as aces. It has a variety of different rules in the different regions of Spain.<br/><br/>In every round of the game Mus (discard) is either agreed or stopped. Then, four bets are made on the same hand of cards:<br/>    * Grande (Biggest): playing for the highest combination of cards; handiak (big ones) in Basque.<br/>    * Peque&ntilde;a or Chica (Smallest): playing for the lowest combination of cards.<br/>    * Pares (Pairs): playing for the best matching card combination; pareak in Basque.<br/>    * Juego (Game): playing for cards total values of 31 or more. Sometimes replaced by a Punto (Point) special round; jokua in Basque.<br/>At last, accepted bets and passes are counted until one of the pairs of players reaches the previously agreed amount (different standards in different regions of Spain, but most commonly 30). The pair of players winning most out of three games wins a vaca (which means cow in spanish), and the pair winning most out of three vacas win the match.<br/><br/>One other special feature of Mus is that it is a mostly verbal game, with little card-involving action, limited to deal and discard (if any). After cards are dealt and Mus (discard) is stopped, all rounds are played verbally, bets are called, passed, accepted or rejected but cards are not shown, dealt or touched in any further way, and the player only is obliged to show them in the end of the round if needed in order to resolve any accepted bet. This makes it a poor card game to watch other people play, and learning to play it through only watching is rather difficult in comparison with other card games.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "4", "boardgameversion": ["Heraclio Fournier Green Edition", "King Cards edition", "Public Domain Edition"], "average": "7.87156", "name": "Mus", "playingtime": "10", "boardgamemechanic": ["Betting/Wagering", "Partnerships"], "age": "7", "usersrated": "370", "boardgamesubdomain": ["Family Games"], "boardgamefamily": ["Traditional Card Games"]}, "6867": {"boardgamedesigner": ["D.

Why would they want to, you ask?) and a _Party Change_ spot - where you change identities (color, score, seat, beverage?!?) with another player.<br/><br/>Like all such games, it works well with the right crowd.<br/><br/>Second edition:<br/><br/>Hear Me Out, in its latest form, corrects some of the major problems the first edition had. Players take turns rolling a die which will determine what kind of challenge they will take. One such challenge involves matching another player's answer to a fill-in-the-blank question (such as &quot;Nuclear BLANK&quot;). Another challenge has you ranting about a bizarre topic for 30 seconds. This challenge is unique in that rather than earning points right away, players write your color down and give you a score (1-3) on how well you did, and put it into a ballot box. Later in the game if you are unfortunate enough to have to switch colors with someone they all of a sudden will be in control of the points you have in the ballot box. The game continues until one person reaches the finish space, at which point the remaining players have one turn to get as far as possible. Some bonus points are added in to determine the true winner.<br/><br/>What makes this game interesting is that the points you earn are never really yours. In a certain type of challenge, if a challenger wins he can trade colored pawns with the loser of the challenge, which not only affects his position on the board, but can earn him bonus points if that person got lots of votes in his speaking rounds.<br/><br/>"}, "6869": {"boardgamedesigner": ["Glenn M.

It took place in and around the town of Gettysburg, Pennsylvania. <br/>It was the battle with the largest number of casualties in the American Civil War and is often described as the war's turning point.<br/>Union Major General George Gordon Meade's Army of the Potomac defeated attacks by Confederate General Robert E. Lee's Army of Northern Virginia. This battle put an end to Lee's plans for an invasion of the North.<br/><br/>Lee vs Meade is a game that covers the Battle of Gettysburg. It was the first game in a series of games put out by Rand known as the 'Command Series Volume I'.  The later version put out by Gamut of Games featured a mounted map-board while the original Rand Games version had a map on heavy paper.<br/>Lee vs. Meade has a 17&quot;X17&quot; map 72 counters(36 for each player) combat charts and turn records charts along with a rulebook.  The scale used is 1/2 mile per square and each unit is considered to be an entire division.  The two-color map is mainly green but there are also some hills and ridges. There is a clearly shown road network of the area as well as terrain that are suitable for defensive outposts.<br/><br/>The map of the Gettysburg area is broken up into a 12x12 square grid.  This grid system was used in several of the games developed by Rand Game Associates and was called the Time/Space Grid. Movement costs necessary to go from one square to the next are visible on the grid at the edges and corners between the squares making it easier to move without the use of a movement chart. Unlike some games that use a square grid, diagonal movement is permitted.<br/><br/>Another feature common to most of the games offered by Rand Games was fairly elaborate combat sub-routine in which the attacker and defender would each pick a combat method from a 6x6 matrix called the Tactical Analysis Chart and draw the appropriate &quot;Tac Card.&quot; These &quot;Tac Cards&quot; are numbered from 1 to 6. The cell on the Tactical Analysis Chart that corresponds to the intersection of the two players' combat methods determines which combat results table is used. There are 6 different types of CRT used in this game.<br/><br/>The turn sequence is easy. Firstly the Confederate army moves.Any combat resulting is resolved and then the Union army moves and any combat is resolved.<br/>In order to initiate a combat you have to move your units onto a square edge that contains enemy units. <br/>There are four different scenarios in the game. A different time of the battle is used in each one and different victory conditions are required for each one.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": ["Gamut of Games Revised Edition", "Rand Game Associates Edition"], "average": "5.4", "name": "Lee vs. Meade", "playingtime": "360", "boardgamemechanic": ["Simulation"], "age": "12", "usersrated": "21", "boardgamesubdomain": ["Wargames"], "boardgamefamily": ["Command Series Volume I"]}, "6877": {"boardgamedesigner": ["Mike Marine"], "poll": [], "name": "Subway Vigilante", "playingtime": "60", "minplayers": "1", "boardgamemechanic": ["Roll / Spin and Move"], "yearpublished": "1985", "usersrated": "7", "maxplayers": "4", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic31434_t.jpg", "average": "4.52857", "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["Paperback Games"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic31434.jpg", "boardgameversion": ["First edition"], "maxplaytime": "60", "boardgamecategory": ["Adventure", "Humor"], "age": "0", "minplaytime": "60", "description": "Ever wanted to be Charles Bronson in &quot;Death Wish,&quot; just gunning down any punk that gets in your face, sasses you back, or even looks at you funny?<br/><br/>From the box cover:<br/>&quot;You've read about this sort of thing in the newspapers and magazines.

First, I wanted to give the wargamer a realistic simulation of Ranger operations. Second, I felt the need to keep the game playable. Most tactical games have hundreds of complicated rules to memorize, but bear no relation to actual field maneuvers . . . Patrolling suits solitaire gaming fairly well. While conventional operations are the result of the efforts of numerous commanders and staff officers, patrols generally depend entirely on the patrol leader's actions . . . I made every attempt to present the tactical situations as the patrol leader would experience them. I wanted the game system to avoid excessive administrative bookkeeping and rules memorization . . . I tried to simulate patrolling from my own experiences and not be tied to more standard wargame conventions . . . The element of chance throughout Ranger is by design. No patrol leader can control his environment. He can only plan for as many possibilities as he has time and be alert and prepared to implement these contingency plans if necessary. Even the most experienced player making all the correct decisions will occasionally be destroyed.

It is the second volume in the Musket &amp; Pike Battle Series covering warfare in the 17th Century. This volume traces the fall, revival, and pinnacle of Swedish military fortunes after the death of King Gustav II Adolf at L&uuml;tzen in 1632.<br/><br/>The Musket &amp; Pike Battle Series transitions from the English Civil War period (This Accursed Civil War, Vol. I) to the Thirty Years War period with added features such as limbered guns, double-sized batteries, and organic regimental artillery. The system emphasizes command and control.<br/><br/>Armies are divided into three or four wings. Each wing has an order that limits the types of actions that units of that wing may perform. Victory goes to the commander who can coordinate the actions of these wings in the heat of battle. Units are infantry brigades, cavalry regiments, and artillery batteries. Rules include Cavalry Charges, use of the cavalry's pistols to skirmish or use in close combat, artillery grazing fire, infantry techniques of fire including advancing, retreating, and salvo firing. Play is highly interactive, and a battle can be played through in one sitting.<br/><br/>The four battles in Sweden Fights On are:<br/><br/><br/>    N&ouml;rdlingen 1634 <br/><br/><br/>Though the Swedes struggled with command after the death of King Gustav II Adolf, they continued to exploit the momentum he had generated. A strong Swedish force pushed into Bavaria under the joint command of Duke Bernhard and Field Marshal Horn.

The Swedes were drawn into a trap.<br/><br/><br/>    Wittstock 1636<br/><br/><br/>The Cannae of the Thirty Years War. Field Marshal Ban&eacute;r had his lines of communication cut by an Imperial-Saxon army under General Hatzfeld. In a daring plan, Ban&eacute;r divided his numerically inferior force and launched a double envelopment. In a desperate struggle for Vineyard Hill, General Torstensson's cavalry held the line just long enough for General King's cavalry to make the march around the Imperial right flank.<br/><br/><br/>    2nd Breitenfeld 1642 <br/><br/><br/>Field Marshal Torstensson caps a brilliant campaign with a siege of the Imperial fortress of Leipzig. Archduke Leopold commanding a larger Imperial army rushes to engage the Swedes. Within sight of the same ground of Gustav Adolf's greatest victory from eleven years past, the armies met.

The latest version (2002) is currently available for download from the BoardGameGeek files section below.<br/><br/>Two to six players control primitive gliders descending into a deep, sheer-walled pit. Within this natural arena the glider pilots engage in ritualistic gladiatorial combat. A combination of martial and flying skills is required for victory. Every decision a player makes, from the selection of weapons to the anticipation of fickle air currents, helps determine whether a gladiator is on the road to glory... or disaster.<br/><br/>The object of the game is simply to have the last glider airborne. The game features a variable player turn order (depending on the altitude and speed of each glider), five different types of weapons (including ranged weapons and nets), risky ramming attacks, and up/down drafts. Players have the option of controlling more than one glider (up to three each in a two-player game). The competition may be a &quot;last man flying&quot; free-for-all or the players can form competing teams of gliders.<br/><br/>The experimental Campaign Expansion rules allow you to play a continuing gladiator character. The Expansion includes rules for Character Survival, Experience, and Special Abilities and Advantages. Gladiator characters who survive a match (and aren't crippled in the process) receive experience and a chance to gain special abilities and advantages. Gladiators who are victorious are more likely develop skills that will help them gain future victories in the arena. A procedure for randomly generating experienced gladiator characters is also described.<br/><br/>Glider-Pit Gladiators was originally designed (under a deadline of a month or two) for the online 1998 Microgame Design Contest held via the Yahoo Groups Microgame Mailing List. The game was updated under the name Glider-Pit Gladiators 2002 for the second micro-game design competition. The 2002 update focused on cleaning up the rules and making improvements to the spartan components. The experimental Campaign Expansion Rules were developed to provide added depth, and they were also updated in 2002.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": ["Print and Play Edition"], "name": "Glider-Pit Gladiators", "playingtime": "120", "boardgamemechanic": ["Hex-and-Counter", "Partnerships", "Variable Player Powers"], "average": "5.85714", "usersrated": "7", "boardgamesubdomain": ["Wargames"], "age": "12"}, "6942": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic199223.jpg", "boardgameimplementation": ["Fire in the East"], "poll": [], "boardgamedesigner": ["Rich Banner", "Frank Chadwick"], "statistics": [], "yearpublished": "1973", "maxplayers": "4", "boardgamepublisher": ["GDW Games"], "maxplaytime": "12000", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic199223_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "12000", "boardgamecategory": ["Wargame", "World War II"], "description": "Introduction:<br/><br/>Drang Nach Osten! is an historical game/simulation of the German invasion of the Soviet Union on 22 June 1941 that lead to the gates of Moscow and ultimately to the destruction of the Wehrmacht and the fall of the Third Reich.

Here you'll be lit with the ancestral frenzy, you'll fight with spears and hatchets the chiefs of the other tribes. Only if you were brave you'll be able to go to the Circle of the Initiation Sea, where you'll learn how to communicate with other tribes. With this you'll finally have completed your Table of the Language and you'll be able to enter the Final Circle: the Knowledge.
