Then, a bidding session takes place to establish the hand's trump suit and objective. Next, the players play to tricks, with the winner of each trick replacing their card with their choice of one of two exposed cards and the loser receiving the other card. Each trick is worth one mark. This continues until the deck is depleted. Finally, the players play out the remainder of their cards to tricks, each of which is worth two marks. If the player who set the trump suit has earned marks at least equal to a goal based upon the two hand evaluations and his bid, he wins the hand.

It can be played by two, four or six players either singly, in pairs or teams of three. The components of the game are 36 different octagonal tiles or metagons and a playing board.<br/><br/>The object of Metagon is to gain tiles from the playing ground. This can be achieved in either of two ways.<br/><br/>1. The simplest way of winning tiles is to create a straight line with three adjacent tiles having the same coloured motifs in the same relative position on each tile. Lines may be horizontal, vertical or diagonal. When a player has formed a straight line, he removes the two tiles placed earlier in the line and places these in a separate 'scoring stack', face up.<br/><br/>2. The second way of gaining tiles is to form a parallelogram by aligning the same coloured motifs on four tiles in the same relative position on each tile. Parallelograms may be any size and aligned horizontally, vertically or diagonally. When a player has placed a parallelogram he removes the three tiles placed earlier and adds these to his scoring stack.<br/><br/>The game ends when players have placed all their playing stack tiles on the board.  The player with the most tiles in his scoring stack is the winner.<br/><br/>"}, "29602": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic384109.jpg", "is_expanded_by": {"41982": {"name": "Okko, Era of the Karasu"}}, "poll": {}, "boardgamedesigner": {"8758": {"name": "Laurent Pouchain"}}, "statistics": {}, "yearpublished": "2008", "maxplayers": "2", "boardgameartist": {"12391": "Hub"}, "boardgamepublisher": {"157": {"name": "Asmodee"}}, "maxplaytime": "45", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic384109_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "45", "boardgamecategory": {"1116": {"name": "Comic Book / Strip"}}, "description": "Okko is a miniature game that is played on a board with squares.

Units are companies and include assaulting infantry, engineers and amphibious tanks. The game system controls the hidden German defenders in their &quot;Widerstandsnest&quot; resistance points, revealing the defenders and their reserves as the American survivors of the first landing waves make their way up the bluffs.

Tom Wham's younger sisters couldn't say the word elephant when they were toddlers so they said &quot;halfanutz&quot; instead.<br/><br/>The basic game consists of walkabout and scoring phases.  In the walkabout phase the player draws a card.  Then they can either push their luck and draw another card or they can take the cards they already have behind their screen and pass the turn to somebody else.  If they draw a card with the same picture as a card they already have, they lose the cards they've drawn and their turn.  After all the cards have been drawn, the scoring phase happens.  Players sort their cards by the resource pictured on it, then count the largest pile of cards and subtract the smallest pile of cards.  After two sessions the scores are totaled and a winner declared.<br/><br/>The advanced game adds resources and a trick taking phase (called &quot;the rumble&quot;).  During the walkabout for each card turned over, the player also gets a resource of the type on the card.  The player gets to keep the resource, even if the cards end up being discarded.  During the trick taking phase, the players randomly play a card from the cards they have collected.  The cards are numbered and the highest number wins.  The twist is that your card can be reinforced by resources of the same type as the card played.  The players take turns reinforcing their cards or passing.  The player with the highest card number + resources played wins the trick.  Players then score the number of cards they have taken during the rumble.  Again, two sessions are played and the scores are totaled.<br/><br/>The tournament game is like the advanced game, except the card played during the rumble is not chosen randomly.<br/><br/>Halfanutz is self-published by Tom Wham and is available from his web site, <a target='_blank' href='http://www.tomwham.com' rel='nofollow'>http://www.tomwham.com</a>.<br/><br/>"}, "29684": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic214330.jpg", "poll": {}, "boardgamedesigner": {"3": {"name": "(Uncredited)"}}, "statistics": {}, "yearpublished": "1993", "maxplayers": "2", "boardgameartist": {"3": "(Uncredited)"}, "boardgamepublisher": {"6920": {"name": "Alchemia"}}, "maxplaytime": "15", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic214330_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "15", "boardgamecategory": {"1002": {"name": "Card Game"}}, "description": "Produced by Alchemia in 1994, the Hokuto No Ken collectible card game has been available only in Italy.

Distance and style points are important. One lemming diving with style and &eacute;lan is worth as many as five of the more mundane divers. But beware the hungry eagles circling overhead or your lemmings might not even make the cliff edge!<br/><br/>Objective: The player with the most victory points wins the game. To earn victory points, players dive their lemmings over the cliff edge and/or collect Lemming Chow Pellets.<br/><br/>The game board is a hex-based map representing the canyon down which up to six separate lemming clans will travel. The canyon ends with the cliff edge hexes, which are the lemmings' ultimate goal. Between the lemmings and their goal there are two eagles circling overhead hoping for multiple lemming snacks.<br/><br/>Each turn a movement card is revealed which will allow for 2-5 lemming movement points. Card luck is mitigated in that all players use the same card to move that turn. Only the top lemming in each stack is allowed to move, so covering your opponents' lemmings is one tactic that is used to slow them down. The down side is that the top lemming in each stack is the only one in danger of becoming eagle chow.<br/><br/>Special Actions allow players to briefly alter the normal rules of the game to their advantage or to their opponents' detriment.

One of the most important campaigns occurred in southeastern Tennessee and Georgia, as Federal armies pressed toward the Confederacy&rsquo;s vital city of Atlanta, home to much of its remaining industry and gateway to the southern and western lands the Confederates still held. The campaign for and siege of this vital city broke the power of the Army of Tennessee, the key rebel command outside northern Virginia.<br/><br/>The theater of these operations is roughly bounded by the Tennessee River to the north, the Chattanooga area to the west, Atlanta to the south, and the Appalachian Mountains to the east. It was here where the formidable Union command team of Sherman and Thomas plied their trade, dooming the Confederacy's last chance to survive the Yankee onslaught. Here too the soldiers of the rebel Army of Tennessee fought stubbornly to defend their homes.<br/><br/>Look Away! The Fall of Atlanta is a strategic-operational simulation of the Army of Tennessee's campaigns in the Georgia theater of the Civil War. The game covers the fighting between Union and Confederate forces in Tennessee and northern Georgia during the spring and summer of 1864. Each hexagon represents an area roughly 2.6 miles in diameter (4 km). Each turn in the game represents about four days of real time. There are four scenarios dealing with the major engagements of the war plus a campaign game covering the entire period.<br/><br/>Look Away is the third game in John Prados' series on the American Civil War, following The Campaigns of Robert E.

In order to win you must gather all your items before the wolf has all its clothes on. The players take turn drawing from the bag, but be careful, if the wolf's head appears, you have to put an item of clothing on him! This fun game is suitable for players of 3 years and over because there are three versions of the game: all together, one against another or alone... But always against the Wolf.<br/><br/>The game comes with a board representing a forest, onto which six different kinds of items are spread: mushrooms, strawberries, snails, blackberries, flowers and butterflies. In addition, each player receives one leaf-shaped individual board that is uniformly green on one side (for using in cooperative mode), and covered with the shapes of five of the six items on the other side (used in competitive and individual modes). The wolf is drawn on a magnetic board and its five items of clothing (shoes, trousers, jacket, hat and umbrella) are magnetic too. In the bag, eight cardboard discs represent each of the six items that can be picked from the forest, plus the head of the wolf and a clover leaf.<br/><br/>The players draw in turn one disc from the bag. If the wolf's head is drawn, they put an item of clothing onto the wolf. If it is the clover leaf, they can take one item of clothing off the wolf or choose one item of their choice from the forest (competitive and individual mode) or two items from the forest (cooperative mode). Otherwise, they take the item represented on the disc from the forest. The disc is then put back in the bag and passed to the next player.<br/><br/>In competitive mode, the winner is the first player who manages to pick up all the items represented on his board. In cooperative mode, the players win if they manage to empty the forest before the wolf is fully clothed. In individual mode, the player wins if he manages to pick up all the items represented on his board.

There are 8 small glass balls, 4 white and 4 black. The cardboard playing field is inset into the box bottom, and is punched with a variety of holes.<br/><br/>The rules on the side of the box say that when batting, a player puts the bat about 2&quot; from the home-plate corner of the box, mounts a ball of his color on the hole in the bat, and then brings down his finger with a sharp blow to the bat handle. This launches the ball up and onto the playing field. Falling into one of four large oblong holes around the pitcher's mound is a strike. Dropping into the round hole near each fielder  is an out. Dropping into any of the numbered holes is a safe hit of that many bases. There is a home run hole in deep center field. If a launched ball fails to fall into any of the holes, it is a ball. Three strikes cause an out, while four balls of course generate a walk. Successful hits are marked by putting balls into holes on the appropriate bases before batting again.<br/><br/>The game can be found listed in &quot;Baseball Games from Antique Baseball to Modern Baseball Sims&quot;.<br/><br/>"}, "29728": {"boardgamedesigner": {"3": {"name": "(Uncredited)"}}, "poll": {}, "name": "Spy Kids: Mission Master", "playingtime": "0", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": {"2046": "Area Movement"}, "yearpublished": "2002", "usersrated": "2", "maxplayers": "4", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic298721_t.jpg", "average": "6.25", "statistics": {}, "boardgamepublisher": {"6930": {"name": "ToyQuest"}}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic298721.jpg", "boardgameversion": {"156030": "ToyQuest First Edition"}, "maxplaytime": "0", "boardgamecategory": {"1064": {"name": "Movies / TV / Radio theme"}}, "age": "10", "minplaytime": "0", "description": "Objective 1: Be the first to finish all missions.<br/>Objective 2: Avoid the Thumb Thumbs!<br/>Objective 3: Become the ultimate OSS spy!<br/><br/>In this advanced Spy Kids board game, you are working as an OSS spy to help solve important missions.<br/><br/>Control the OSS operatives as they work their way around from mission to mission as quickly as possible.

Players score points by placing tiles on their own country board.  One point is scored for each field tile in the player's largest group of connected field tiles and two points for each tile in their second largest connected group.<br/><br/>Points are also scored for the worker tiles a player places on their country board.  The number of points scored for each worker is equal to the number on the worker tile.  Worker tiles do not count as connecting tiles when calculating the largest group of tiles.  When played, a worker enables a player to take a special action.  Each player has their own team of six workers, known as farmhands.  There are also six townsfolk who can be acquired by any player.<br/><br/>There are usually six field tiles available at any time from the registry.  On their turn a player may bid for up to two tiles using crop counters.  The field tile being bid for and the bid in crop counters are placed in the player's store.  On their turn the other players may match the store owner's bid in both the number and type of crop counters.  If they choose to do so, then they place the field tile on their country board and pay the crop counters to the store owner.  If no other player has matched the store owner's bid, then on their next turn the store owner may place the field tile(s) from their store onto their country board and pay their bid in crop counters to the general stock.<br/><br/>When deciding how much to bid for a field tile, players will need to consider how important the field tile is to them and whether other players are likely to bid for the tile.  It is usually beneficial for a player to place field tiles into their store as that player will either obtain the field tile or receive additional crop counters.<br/><br/>When played, a worker tile must be adjacent to at least the number of field tiles as the number on the worker tile.  A worker tile cannot be adjacent to another worker tile.  If a player obtains a field tile for a space where they have already placed a worker tile, they must remove the worker tile.  However, if the worker tile can be replaced immediately (next to the required number of field tiles), then the player can benefit from the worker's ability again.  Getting these extra benefits is one of the keys to doing well in the game.<br/><br/>Players have two actions per turn.  There are four possible actions.  Each action can only be performed once per turn.  As described above, the actions include placing field tiles from the stores onto their country board - action (c), placing field tiles from the registry into their store - action (d), and placing a worker tile onto their country board - action (b).  Action (c) cannot be performed after action (d).  A player may also harvest crops by turning over some unharvested field tiles on their country board - action (a).<br/><br/>Field tiles taken from the registry are replaced immediately with field tiles from the bag.  The bag also contains a number of event tiles.  The event tiles, when drawn, affect all of the players, not just the player who drew the event tile.  When the tenth event tile is drawn, the game ends after two further rounds have been played.<br/><br/>One point is also awarded to the players who have the most of each of the types of crop counters at the end of the game.  No points are awarded for ties.  Points are tallied using the scoring track on the town board.  The player with the most points is the winner.<br/><br/>Nr. 4 in the QWG Master Print Edition series, as Demetra<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": {"26270": "English / German first edition"}, "average": "6.81209", "name": "Key Harvest", "playingtime": "90", "boardgamemechanic": {"2012": "Auction/Bidding"}, "age": "10", "usersrated": "1528", "boardgamesubdomain": {"5497": "Strategy Games"}, "boardgamefamily": {"48": "Key-series"}}, "29840": {"boardgamedesigner": {"3": {"name": "(Uncredited)"}}, "poll": {}, "name": "Tom & Jerry Game", "playingtime": "0", "minplayers": "0", "boardgamemechanic": {"2035": "Roll / Spin and Move"}, "yearpublished": "0", "usersrated": "0", "boardgamefamily": {"7334": "Animals: Cats"}, "maxplayers": "0", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic217274_t.jpg", "average": "0", "statistics": {}, "boardgamepublisher": {"359": {"name": "Selchow & Righter"}}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic217274.jpg", "boardgameversion": {"133564": "Selchow & Righter English Edition"}, "maxplaytime": "0", "boardgamecategory": {"1041": {"name": "Children's Game"}}, "age": "4", "minplaytime": "0", "description": "This is a spin and move game.

Holding fortified positions and bolstered by the crack Philippine Scouts, the Allied forces would hold for months against the well equipped and trained Japanese invaders.<br/><br/>Bataan! is a two-player game, recreating the battle for the peninsula. Vance von Borries has drawn from his game design experience to create a game engine capable of portraying the tense jungle-fighting which took place on Bataan. While the system is based on a previous success, the changes needed to simulate the fighting on Bataan make this a unique gaming experience.<br/><br/>Japanese forces will move quickly to out-flank and pry the US/Filipino units from their fortifications. Yet the Americans can successfully launch attacks out of these strong points, particularly when the crack Philippine Scouts are in the lead. From time to time a player may lead with his armor and this was the one battle of the war where the lowly US Stuart tank was the superior tank!<br/><br/>A chit-pull system is used to randomly determine activations for the various formations on each side. In general, formation size is based on a division. Each formation activates individually for movement and combat. Players alternate activations based on the random chit-pull until all formations have played. Most Japanese formations receive two activations per turn, thereby demonstrating their combat capabilities, preparedness and motivation in taking an offensive role. Individual unit counters represent battalions or half battalions, and include efficiency ratings for combat comparisons and other functions.<br/><br/>Bataan! features five scenarios. The three early scenarios, which include a learning scenario, all play to a conclusion in one sitting. They feature a surprising amount of movement for a mostly jungle warfare game and rely on sound military tactics. Only the fourth scenario, the last battle, is a true set-piece action. The Japanese planned it that way and yet even the outcome of that battle was not pre-ordained. All scenarios are tied together by a campaign scenario where both players contend with supply and disease to field the best force possible for the final offensive.<br/><br/>Components:<br/><br/>     1 map &ndash; 22&rdquo; x 34&rdquo; - [scale of 1.2 km to the hex] <br/>        2 full sheets of 0.6&rdquo; counters [or 408 5/8 inch counters]<br/>        11 full-color set-up and player aid cards<br/>        1 rules booklet [with historical notes] <br/>        1 10-sided dice<br/>        1 full color box and lid set<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Designer: Vance von Borries<br/>Developer: Mark Guttag<br/>Artist: Tim Schleif<br/><br/><br/>(BGG user description:)<br/><br/>Bataan! is a two-player operational level game of this WW II Pacific theater campaign, January through April 1942. It presents a fascinating contest of two mismatched armies on a subject our hobby has not gamed often. The US/Filipino defense, embattled, isolated and led initially by Gen. Douglas MacArthur, for three months held off a numerically inferior but well-equipped and very aggressive Japanese force led by General Masaharu Homma. While the US and Filipino forces can be said to have won most of the first contests: the Abucay Line, the Battle of the Points and the Battle of the Pockets, it would be the final contest that decided the issue. Only because of continued complete isolation would the US lose that final battle in April 1942. And yet it was that heroic defense of sublime courage that helped motivate the US to endure the reverses of the war and persevere to a complete victory.

This is a two-player, or two-team, operational level game depicting the battles of the southern wing of the Axis invasion of the Soviet Union during 1941. This game picks up where an earlier game in this series, Barbarossa: Army Group South, left off. It begins in mid-August and ends in December 1941, historically near the cities Kharkov and Rostov.<br/><br/>COMPONENTS<br/><br/><br/>     Three 22 x 34 inch maps<br/>     One 24 x 34 inch map<br/>     1120 counters<br/>     Series rule book plus a scenarios book<br/>     Various player aid cards for charts and tables<br/>     Set up cards for each scenario<br/><br/><br/>THE GAME<br/><br/>This comprehensive game system was designed at a scale for divisions but it accommodates the many independent brigades, regiments, and special battalions that were also available for this campaign. These include units for rocket artillery, heavy artillery, armored trains, assault guns, engineers, Stukas, Sturmoviks, anti-aircraft guns, NKVD, Stormtroopers, militia, base units, and more. You can tailor your army to fight a lengthy campaign over variable conditions.<br/><br/>Despite its size we have kept the overall rules within the context of other games in this series thereby leaving nearly all mechanics familiar to veteran East Front Series (EFS) players. Such familiar mechanics include ranged artillery, air units for close support or interdiction, Soviet HQs, retreat or stand orders, weather, reaction movement, railroad movement, strategic movement, overruns, combined arms, fortifications, special supply situations, and more. Veteran players should be able to pick up game play right away. For those who are new to the series, many examples of play will be found in the rules book as well as a Learning scenario to fully illustrate game play and some of the decision making for each battle.<br/><br/>Note that all games of the Barbarossa, or EFS, series are built to fit together. If space is at a premium for you, please note that four of the eight scenarios here in this game alone require only one map or less.<br/><br/>Barbarossa: Kiev to Rostov challenges you to balance your attack and defense in each sector of the game map, regardless of scenario. Neither side has sufficient resources in either troops or supplies so the key to winning will be good game play and a sound plan. Can you do better than the titans that struggled for the Ukraine in the summer and fall of 1941?<br/><br/>THE SCENARIOS<br/><br/><br/>     Learning Scenario: Rostov Redeemed. The German 3rd Motorized Corps has just taken Rostov and now attempts to hold it against a massive Soviet counteroffensive. This was the first in what turned out to be a series of disasters that befell the German army during the winter of 1941/42.<br/>     Kiev Pocket. In mid-August the Germans had just cleared the Uman Pocket (the last battle of the Barbarossa: Army Group South game in this series) and looked to exploit their advantage to quickly conquer the rest of the Ukraine. Meanwhile, the Soviets had built a whole new group of armies to the east of the Dnepr River. This campaign resulted in the greatest encirclement battle of the war, perhaps of all time, as the Soviets over-committed to the defense of the river. Yet this was not a sure victory. Play testers have called this scenario the best yet in the entire series of games. You simply must experience this battle, one of the decisive battles of the war in the east.<br/>     Battle on the Sea of Azov. In late September with disaster looming to the north and a German offensive building against the Crimea, the relatively untouched Soviet 9 and 18 Armies in the southern portion of the Dnepr Bend were called upon to act, this time to save their comrades defending the Crimea by striking toward the rear of the German 11th Army. While their attack made but small headway, some Romanian defenders were overwhelmed. The situation could have opened up to destroy the German rear and then threaten the rear of the rest of German Army Group South. Perhaps this offensive could as well reverse the tide of the German advance. Or was someone in the Kremlin just dreaming?<br/>     Battle of Sumy. Some small battles lend themselves wonderfully to focus treatment and this battle at the end of September near the north Ukrainian town of Sumy certainly qualifies. Handled on its own special map this becomes a contest of mobility between a German motorized corps on the one hand and a strong Soviet cavalry corps on the other, with the Soviets getting timely reinforcements from the 1 Guards Motorized Rifle Division. This very balanced situation plays quickly and perhaps is the best introduction in the series to the game system.<br/>     To Kharkov. It has become almost trite to say Russia is vast but for this scenario the German player will declare this many times. Even though the German has just won the Kiev Pocket Battle, now the great industrial city of Kharkov beckons in the distant east. The Soviets have reassembled their armed forces yet again but this time the German has sent his panzers north to Moscow and out of this game (see GMT's Typhoon! Game). German 6th Army, a true hard-luck formation, gets the honor of leading the advance and they now experience their first starvation of the war, similar to that they will suffer at Stalingrad a year later, although without the desperation of that later battle. Even so, the 6th Army is formidable; so will the arrival of mud be the only thing saving the Soviet's behind? Or, will he have finally mastered the art of war against the Nazis?<br/>     To Rostov. The most dramatic moment of the late drive to the east was the drive to Rostov, the gateway to the Caucasus where lay the oilfields the Germans so vitally needed to run their war machine. The Germans have won victory after victory for nearly six months even though the Soviets have set successive armies in their path. Is this perhaps the Soviet last ditch and their last army? Are the Germans truly at the end of their supply line? Will winter stop the Germans? Historically in this near even contest, the panzers actually got into the streets of Rostov; can you?<br/>     Kiev to Rostov. This is the full campaign, mid-August through December, a very full 57 turns over vast distances. The Germans begin in supply difficulty and will have to pick a pause to advance their main bases. The Soviet player will have to take care he does not expend all his effort too far to the west, thereby leaving nothing for the final battles. Neither player has resources to do it all but it can be fun trying. The East Front experience is not complete without playing this full-size scenario. <br/><br/><br/>", "minplayers": "1", "boardgameversion": {"42946": "First Edition"}, "average": "7.8162", "name": "Barbarossa: Kiev to Rostov, 1941", "playingtime": "240", "boardgamemechanic": {"2072": "Dice Rolling"}, "age": "12", "usersrated": "179", "boardgamesubdomain": {"4664": "Wargames"}, "boardgamefamily": {"27513": "Cities: Kiev"}}, "29876": {"boardgamedesigner": {"8842": {"name": "jim pinto"}}, "poll": {}, "name": "Cookie Jar", "playingtime": "30", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": {"2072": "Dice Rolling"}, "yearpublished": "2007", "usersrated": "2", "maxplayers": "12", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1289391_t.jpg", "average": "5.25", "statistics": {}, "boardgamepublisher": {"6967": {"name": "Knightime Studios"}}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1289391.jpg", "maxplaytime": "30", "boardgamecategory": {"1017": {"name": "Dice"}}, "age": "5", "minplaytime": "30", "description": "From the publisher's web site:<br/><br/>Cookie Jar is an accusations and alibis dice game.

It utilizes the vehicle of the standard game--so universally appealing to children--and the elicitation of responses via token reinforcement. The game has proved helpful in shortening the therapeutic process--not only because it provides the therapist with information earlier than he would have otherwise obtained it, but also because it facilitates the child's freeing himself enough to reveal his previously suppressed and repressed thoughts, feelings, and actions. The game can be useful in both individual and group psychotherapy with children. And even the child who will engage in direct discussion, psychoanalytic inquiry, and fantasy play can find it a pleasurable additional psychotherapeutic experience.

And even those who are, are not likely to have the objectivity with their own children that is necessary for optimum utilization of the game.

Since provinces on either side do not directly correspond to each other, the goal is to place your pieces so that you can attain a majority on the Chinese side (for positive points) while avoiding having a majority on the Mongolian side (for negative points).

Each turn every player gets 6 movement points to share between his daggers (ie move 1 dagger forward 6 footprints, or 2 daggers 3 footprints each, or any combination up to a total of 6). You can 'leapfrog' your own daggers, (but may never have 2 daggers on the same footprint) and at the end of each move the dagger is 'stabbed' into the board. When a dagger is placed in one of the randomly selected footprints the Vampire will let out a bloodcurdling scream causing that dagger to be removed from the game. Players have to remember which footprints will wake the Vampire and avoid them for the rest of the game.

The twist here is that the counters are placed in a series of 5 boards of differing size that are formed to make a pyramid, hence the name &lsquo;Quinamid&rsquo;.<br/><br/>The rules are simple, with any one of  3 options available to the player : <br/>a)    Place a counter in a vacant space<br/>b)    Rotate a board (including those boards &lsquo;above&rsquo; it) through 90 degrees<br/>c)    Move a board (including those boards &lsquo;above&rsquo; it) one &lsquo;position&rsquo; in any orthogonal direction.<br/><br/>An important rule is that the subsequent player may neither move NOR rotate a board which was moved or rotated by the preceding player.<br/><br/>Players take it in turns to make their move until one of them reveals a line of 5 counters, this being in a vertical, horizontal or diagonal direction.<br/><br/>As players use option c) above they will &lsquo;cover&rsquo; boards below, thereby hiding the contents. It follows therefore that there is a bit of memory required to recall what was under the various boards if you are to use it to your advantage.<br/><br/>A game is often completed in 2 or 3 minutes so replay value is high. It is often better to play a &lsquo;best of 5&rsquo; series to employ different strategies, so that would take around 15 minutes.<br/><br/>The game should appeal to players aged 8-80.

Prentice of Holyoke, Massachusetts. Prentice was 17 years old. The patent, for &quot;Electric Baseball,&quot; was granted less than a year later, and Jim Prentice Electric Baseball, under a variety of titles and in a variety of forms, would go on to a production run of more than thirty years.<br/><br/>Prentice initially sold, or at least licensed, the rights to his invention to Parker Brothers, the game-publishing giant of nearby Salem -- probably to help fund his college tuition at the University of New Hampshire, whence he graduated with a degree in mathematics. Parkers produced Electric Base Ball Game, arguably the first electrical boardgame ever, in the very early 1930s.<br/><br/>Despite the enduring popularity of the fondly-remembered Prentice games, their more than two dozen variations and their chronology are poorly documented, and Prentice himself (1910-2005) seems a mysterious figure to most.<br/><br/>Prentice regained control of his patent by the mid-1930s and set himself up in business as Electric Game Co..  One of the first products of The Electric Game Company -- perhaps the very first, and among the simplest of all Prentice baseball games -- was Electric Base Ball &quot;version D02,&quot; featuring the &quot;Electric Bat.&quot;  Prentice evidently got rights to Parker Brothers' graphics as well.  He told the Union-News that in his first year of production, he sold about a hundred games at five dollars each.<br/><br/>Very similar to both the D02 and the Parker Brothers game, another of the earliest varieties of Electric Base Ball was the &quot;version DD24,&quot; also featuring the &quot;Electric Bat.&quot; The &quot;D&quot; and &quot;DD&quot; clearly denoted editions using a single D battery and two D batteries -- perhaps the last obvious indicia in a long list of cryptic Prentice codes. The games were personally assembled by Prentice and a few assistants.<br/><br/>Another early-looking version of Prentice electric baseball is Wonder Baseball Game. The illustrated batter would be reused in later variations of the box lid.<br/><br/>Not only is Wonder again similar to the early models above, the promo literature included in the box trumpets both the Wonder game and Electric Base Ball Model D02, as well as Electric Football, and identifies all as available in 1938. Oddly, the Wonder gameboard indicates &quot;patent pending,&quot; despite the 1928 patent used on much later models.<br/><br/>Wonder Baseball had an edition packaged in a slip-cover sort of box and apparently devoid of battery compartments, control buttons, and lights. It seems to be a non-electric model, perhaps a wartime revision.<br/><br/>Prentice saved a little money by providing box lids but no box bottoms for his games, leaving many vendors of second-hand games today to think that one part's missing. It's not. Adding to some latter-day confusion, Electric Game Co. box lids and gameboards do not always match up.  Prentice was not one to waste a nickel, so it's very likely that, even while new gameboard models were being designed, produced, and sold, old box-lid inventory was being used until it was exhausted, and only at that point would new and redesigned box lids be printed.<br/><br/>The lid most often associated with the earliest 1930s versions of Electric Base Ball is a red box with the batter illustration above the title.  Two words on the gameboard, &quot;Baseball&quot; is one word on the box.  The source of the illustration -- the same batter seen on Wonder Baseball Game -- remains unknown.<br/><br/>Slightly later editions of the lid added the phrase &quot;Big League&quot; above &quot;Electric Baseball&quot; -- all in a new font -- and are in fact usually seen covering <br/>Big League Electric Baseball Model B-4, which was produced from about 1938 through 1941.  Prentice's All-American Electric Football and Collegiate Electric Basketball also debuted by 1938.<br/><br/>Like the earliest versions, the B-4 measures about 16x14&quot; -- the standard dimensions of all Prentice Electric Baseball games until the Super De Luxe editions of the early 1950s.<br/><br/>A fourth edition of the red box replaces &quot;Big League&quot; with &quot;Jim Prentice.&quot;  Jim Prentice Electric Baseball, probably from about 1940, sports a version of the cover illustration on the gameboard itself.<br/><br/>The legend added to the fifth red box variation reads &quot;This Game Operates Electrically Or Mechanically.&quot;  Jim Prentice Electric Baseball Dual Control Model, is a little lighter on the bulbs and wiring and the need for batteries, hinting that this too is not just post-1940 but a wartime product.<br/><br/>A slightly simpler version of Jim Prentice Electric Baseball Dual Control Model (had two knobs, no illustration). The two Dual Control models are the only versions of Electric Baseball so far found carrying a different patent number -- confirming not only their 1942 invention, but also that they were not a Prentice design.  George P Alderman and Herbert H Fredrick had been the people granted the patent on that gameboard.<br/><br/>The patent was later licensed to a company called Mastercraft, which produced the game as Prolectric Baseball in 1951.  Mastercraft also turned out Prolectric Football and possibly other games in the '50s.<br/><br/>The famous &quot;alligator-finish&quot; white box is assumed by many to be early 1930s vintage, but this box lid is almost always seen with Models E120, 68-B, 48-B, and 63-B, all verifiably from the late 1940s. Model E120 dates to 1947. The cartoon of the swinging batter is based on an early-'30s painting by noted illustrator J. F. Kernan.<br/><br/>(Source)<br/><br/>"}, "29957": {"boardgamedesigner": {"3": {"name": "(Uncredited)"}}, "poll": {}, "name": "Base Ball", "playingtime": "0", "minplayers": "2", "yearpublished": "1886", "usersrated": "0", "boardgamefamily": {"5586": "Sports: Baseball"}, "maxplayers": "2", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic858059_t.jpg", "average": "0", "statistics": {}, "boardgamepublisher": {"3210": {"name": "J.H.

The game does not intend to faithfully reproduce the festival, but just be a funny competition among the players grasping some of the feeling of the festival.<br/><br/>Each player represents a group of patumaires (i.e. those participating in the festival) and he or she should lead his or her patumaires through the old city streets, trying to reach the special squares where the festival is held. The final aim of the players is to gather the maximum number of patumaires in these squares at the end of each round. But there is a problem: the squares are pretty small and there is no room for everybody. If the squares are full you'll have to manage as best as you can in order to throw out some competitor, while trying to keep there your own patumaires. To help you in this task you should use wisely the various cards and popular characters of the festival: some ones will help you in reaching the squares, some others will help you in defending yourself from the other players' pushes.<br/><br/>The game has three rounds and each player can use his cards to move the patumaires as well as the character cards, which allows some special (and sort of magical) action. At the end of each round the players obtain points by their mere presence in the squares and, in some cases, even more points by having a majority there. You'll have to maintain always an equilibrium in your cards: will you spend your cards mainly for trying to reach all the places or better keep the highest card for defending against your competitor's pushes? Will you spend that 6-valued card for his movement value or for his character's special action?<br/><br/><br/>    Released October 2007.<br/><br/><br/><br/>    Winner of the 6th Game Creation Contest Award at the Fira JocJoc in Tona, Catalonia, Spain (November 2007).<br/><br/><br/>", "minplayers": "3", "boardgameversion": {"24191": "First edition"}, "age": "10", "name": "PatimPatamPatum", "playingtime": "90", "boardgamemechanic": {"2046": "Area Movement"}, "average": "6.57059", "usersrated": "17", "boardgamefamily": {"22804": "Catalonia"}}, "29961": {"boardgamedesigner": {"3": {"name": "(Uncredited)"}}, "poll": {}, "name": "Eye Spy", "playingtime": "30", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": {"2072": "Dice Rolling"}, "yearpublished": "2007", "usersrated": "6", "maxplayers": "6", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1063544_t.png", "average": "3.66667", "statistics": {}, "boardgamepublisher": {"964": {"name": "Tactic"}}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1063544.png", "boardgameversion": {"147616": "Danish edition"}, "maxplaytime": "30", "boardgamecategory": {"1045": {"name": "Memory"}}, "age": "7", "minplaytime": "30", "description": "(Translated from the box, in Norwegian)<br/><br/>Does your memory last for more than 30 seconds?<br/><br/>&quot;Eye Spy&quot; is an exiting and challenging board game about observation, memory and luck.

The scenarios are all hypothetical, of course, but are based on what generals of either side believed would be the course of a war in the years immediately after 1945.

New pieces include the Soviet Josef Stalin III and Josef Stalin IV heavy tanks, T-44 medium tank and Su101 assault gun. There are also infantry armed with the awesome AK-47 assault rifle, still a front-line weapon around the world 60 years after its development.<br/><br/>An American player will need powerful weapons to counter that arsenal, and Iron Curtain provides. There are M26 &ldquo;Pershing&rdquo; heavy tanks, Sherman &ldquo;Jumbo&rdquo; assault tanks, M24 Chaffee light tanks, M4 Sherman tanks with a 76mm gun, M28 ultra-heavy assault tanks, and M29, M30 and M32 heavy tanks.
