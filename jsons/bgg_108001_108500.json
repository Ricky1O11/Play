It is as close and yet far from Chinese Mahjong as Sh&ocirc;gi (Japanese Chess) can be the same and yet different from original Chess. Mahjong was brought to Japan in 1904, but the Riichi form that is used in modern times probably originated from the 1920s. Today, the worldwide famous Mahjong Association officially recognized the complete rules of Riichi Mahjong for Tournaments.<br/><br/>The main differences are :<br/>1) The 1-Yaku minimum: In order to win a hand, it can only be validated when your hand has at least one of the Yaku (specific hand combinations) in it.<br/>2) Dora: A specific bonus tiles are indicated by the flipped tile from the dead wall and providing other possible Han bonus.<br/>3) Riichi: When a player is Tenpai (one tile away from having a Mahjong hand, valid or not), he can bet a 1000 points chip to add one Yaku to his hand (thus validating a possible invalid hand).  Winning with a Riichi hand allows access to the hidden ura-dora, which is an added dora indicator located underneath the revealed dora tile.<br/>4) Abortive draws: Specific conditions, which ends a hand without winning prior to the drawing of all tiles, aside from the dead wall.<br/>5) Scoring system: Much more complex than in Chinese Mahjong, it is based on hand combinations (Yaku) providing multipliers (Han) that combine with some other circumstantial points like the type of tiles in the hand (Fu) for any 4 han or less.  The combination of Han and Fu correspond to a chart (and even an equation) to finally produce the hand's scoring points (Ten).<br/><br/>Some other minor elements in the Riichi Mahjong differ from the original Mahjong but are not important enough to be fully mentioned, like the Red 5 tiles (a non-official variant sometimes used which gives bonus like the Dora) or the validation of some Yaku (when the hand must be kept hidden or not, depending on the Japanese region where the game is played).<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "4", "boardgameversion": ["Public domain edition"], "average": "8.42061", "name": "Riichi Mahjong", "playingtime": "120", "boardgamemechanic": ["Betting/Wagering", "Hand Management", "Set Collection"], "age": "8", "usersrated": "131", "boardgamesubdomain": ["Abstract Games"], "boardgamefamily": ["Mahjong"]}, "108019": {"boardgamedesigner": ["Mary Danby"], "poll": [], "name": "Rosette Riding School", "playingtime": "15", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": ["Dice Rolling", "Roll / Spin and Move"], "yearpublished": "1985", "usersrated": "2", "boardgamefamily": ["Animals: Horses"], "maxplayers": "4", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1130207_t.jpg", "average": "5.5", "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["Waddington's Games, Inc."], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1130207.jpg", "boardgameversion": ["First edition"], "maxplaytime": "15", "boardgamecategory": ["Animals", "Children's Game", "Dice", "Racing"], "age": "7", "minplaytime": "15", "description": "Juvenile horse-riding themed dice-rolling game in two phases.<br/><br/>In part one, &quot;Schooling Track&quot;, players throw a d6 to move around and collect (or lose) horseshoes.<br/><br/>In part two, &quot;Cross Country Track&quot;, players use a die numbered 1,2,3 to move and attempt jumps.

You built a monster to rend them limb from limb, which your minions assured you was the very worst way to be rended. When it became clear that the only hope for the world was your own benign leadership, you took control of TV to announce this fact. But your broadcast was interrupted by someone else taking control of TV and announcing his own plan for world domination &ndash; and then that broadcast was interrupted by yet another interloper. So. Competition. Well, the world will never be as scared of these upstarts as it will be of you.

(Interesting side note: Eighteen different artists contributed to the artwork on the different inventions in the game.)<br/><br/>Nefarious is played over several rounds. In each round the players simultaneously choose and reveal one of their actions that will allow them to allocate one of their Minions to an area on their Lair, obtain money, obtain a blueprint for an invention, or build one of their inventions if they have enough money to do so. The minions that you allocate to your Lair can earn you additional income depending on the actions that your neighbors choose. The first player to build 20 or more points worth of Inventions AND have more points than any other player wins.<br/><br/>There is a twist to the game, though &ndash; actually, two twists! At the beginning of the game, you randomly draw two Twist cards, which change the environment so that the game plays differently each time. This means that in order to win, the players will have to revise their strategies each time they play Nefarious.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": ["English first edition", "English second edition", "Polish first edition", "Russian first edition"], "name": "Nefarious", "playingtime": "45", "boardgamemechanic": ["Hand Management", "Simultaneous Action Selection"], "age": "8", "boardgameexpansion": ["223495"], "usersrated": "1677", "boardgamesubdomain": ["Family Games"], "average": "6.4473", "boardgamepodcastepisode": ["Ben Goes To Gen-Con And Our Review of Nefarious!", "Carnagecast Extrasode 5: A Dark and Stormy Night", "Episode 107-- Gen Con 2015 Wrap up and La Granja Review", "Episode 45 - Hordes and Awards", "Episode 8: 2011 Wrap-up", "The Polyhedron Collider Cast Episode 6", "What Did You Play This Week Podcast Thing Week 48!!!

Using cards to hire artisans, you will put them to work in six city tower workshops, each devoted to a different kind of book. The Chief Librarian of the City will, in turn, tour the city buying books at what he considers their proper value. Prestige Collection cards generate victory points depending on how well you can fulfill the requirements of the Chief Librarian&rsquo;s collection.<br/><br/>Needed to play: the game board showing the city of Bibliogamo, the 47 Artisan cards, the 7 Prestige Collection cards, 26 black eurocubes representing your Artisans, and 16 red eurocubes to act as track markers in the game. Additionally you&rsquo;ll need one pawn to represent the Librarian.<br/><br/>Win: The game is over when the Time Track eurocube reaches [40] and you complete your turn. For each book you produce, you gain 1VP. For each 5 Florins you have, you gain 1 VP. Prestige VP is awarded as indicated on the Prestige Collection card chosen at the start of the game. Your total VP is your score for the game.<br/><br/>The Five Turn Phases:<br/>1. Move the time track eurocube forward one day closer to [40].<br/><br/>2. Move the Librarian Pawn clockwise 3 spaces, then turn over the top Artisan card from the draw pile on to the discard pile and move the Librarian accordingly as indicated by the Librarian icon on the left-hand side of the card.<br/><br/>3. Look at the small Artisan icon below the Librarian icon on this same card. You may not play any card with that Artisan symbol on it this turn unless you discard a card from your hand with a matching small Artisan icon.<br/><br/>4. You may now do any of the following, but in order:<br/>a. Pay 1 Florin to move the Librarian forward or backward one space. You may pay 1 Florin for each space you wish to move the Librarian.<br/>b. Sell a book, if completed, in the Tower the Librarian is currently standing on. Turn over the next 2 Artisan cards from the draw deck. Place the second card to the right of the first and look at the florin value on the second card as indicated by the Florin icon at on the first card. This is the amount the Librarian is willing to pay for this book. You may pay extra 1 day of time to turn over another card replacing the current Florin amount. You may continue to do this, paying 1 day of time per card turned over, until you are satisfied with the price.     <br/>Mark this amount on your Florin Track and return all Artisan eurocubes from the completed book to your pool. Then mark the production of a book on your Book track, moving the red eurocube forward one space, and if the book is one of those needed for a Prestige Collection, mark that book on the Prestige Collection card as well with a red eurocube. Note: you may pay extra days of time only if they remain on the Time Track. Lastly, place all drawn cards used to calculate the Florin value on the discard pile.<br/>c. Discard one Artisan card from your hand to the discard pile and place that number of black eurocubes on the Artisans indicated by the card, on any one Tower. Then discard one more card from your hand to pay for those Artisans. You may do this action twice if you wish. You do not receive any surplus Artisans from the discarded card. Nor do you receive any surplus Artisans if your tower already has the number required for that Artisan type. The second time you do this action you may add Artisans to the same tower or a different one.<br/><br/>5. Draw back to a hand of 5 cards.

The silent Grayking, brooding upon his throne in the Tower of Ash, is a far-reaching shadow upon Lassadar. We feel his presence in each of our days. His servants grow bold, stealing into our cities, inhabiting the alleys and dark places of our streets. They jeer at us from our mirrors, shaming our reflections.<br/><br/>The books of the Council of Wardens, handed down to us across the years, say that the era of broken barriers is upon us. Omens tell us, by winter, the Grayking will break through the few defenses we have remaining, cross to Lassadar, and our lands will fall to despair.<br/><br/>We few who are left, who remember the Grayking&rsquo;s original imprisonment across the Barrier Planes, struggle to keep his power from growing further, but we have little time and far too few disciples. You are young but have proven to hold the strength of our teaching inside you. We have trained you in the arcane arts of ice, oak and flint magic and have taught you those powers are capricious and can damage your spirit if relied upon too much. We wish we had more time to train you further. We do not.<br/><br/>Go now into the wider world, with our blessings, and seek a means to defeat the Grayking. Find the three Warding Keys stolen by his servants and re-lock the gates to force him back behind the Barrier Planes forever. Our agents, spread thinly across places still untouched in Lassadar, will aid you in your quest as best they can.<br/><br/>Go now, and save us all&hellip;&hellip;<br/><br/>Shadows Upon Lassadar is a solitaire fantasy quest game. You play a young magic adept who has been charged with finding three lost keys to lock the gates between the Barrier Plains and prevent the Grayking from reaching the world of Lassadar. You will journey to different cities using a deck of cards; other cards list spells you learn during the game. Magic in Lassadar is, however, a two edged sword and if you use powerful spells you may end up corrupting your own spirit in the process and lose the game. Three specific cards lead to expanded battle maps where you fight the Grayking&rsquo;s servants for possession of the keys.

These quests are encountered by turning over cards from the draw deck:<br/><br/>City Quest cards showing the name of the city you&rsquo;ve journeyed to, win and loss table reference icons and event instructions for the battle in that city. As you win battles in these cities you will remove these cards from the game. If you lose a battle in this city you will place this card on the Quest discard pile to be shuffled back into the game. Dice are rolled to determine the outcome of these battles.<br/><br/>Council of Wardens Quest cards always have a white top. Their event instructions will help you gain spells and refresh your Mana and Spirit. These cards will always be placed on the Quest discard pile to be shuffled back into the game.<br/><br/>Three Warding City Quest cards, each with a colored band and a numbered Warding Key icon across the bottom will signal when you use the Expanded Battle Maps (wargame hexmap style). On the Expanded Battle Maps you will encounter AI driven servants of the Grayking. Dice are rolled to determine the outcome of these battles. As you win the battles in these cities, and gain the Warding Keys, you will remove these cards from the game. If you lose a battle in this city you will place this card on the Quest discard pile, to be shuffled back into the game.<br/><br/>Winning or losing the game:<br/><br/>Draw cards one by one working your way through the quest.

Taking the fruit they poison the apples, feed the monkeys, draw cards, and hinder the prince charming on his way to save the damsel. The apples if given to the damsel before the prince arrives, will put the damsel into a deep sleep (coma). The player who does this will gain the prestige for doing so, of her wicked guild of witches and warlocks. The charming Prince of each Kingdom is headed towards his Kingdom's damsels, and each round saves one, unless hindered (slipping on a banana peel, perhaps?

If your goods weigh more than the goods that Aunt Trudel has set aside, then you get nothing!<br/><br/>In Tante Trudels Tr&ouml;del, players shop from a 5x5 array of goods, each with their own basket. One item &ndash; a coat hanger, a vase, a dollhouse couch &ndash; is placed on most of the spaces in the array, while a few spaces are covered with vouchers. Three items are set aside at random, and those are the goods that Aunt Trudel will weigh at checkout to see whether you'd met her tough standards.<br/><br/>All players start on the same corner of the game board with a shopping basket. On a turn, a player rolls a die, moves her basket that many spaces around the game board in a clockwise direction, then picks up one item (or voucher) from the row that her basket is next to and places it in her basket. If a player's basket lands on the same location as an opponent's basket, then the player can take an item from the opponent instead.

Unbeknownst to the group, Kali's rhinoceros friend Mambo is eager to bump the group along to keep it moving, possibly pushing an explorer or two into the dung heaps that dot the land. Can you avoid getting a faceful of feces and being bumped by Mambo?<br/><br/>To set up the game, one player places Mambo on a space on the track that circles the game board, then all of the explorer tokens placed in random order in front of it, then Kali placed at the head of the line. Place the dung heaps along the movement track with some space between them. Each player takes a set of movement cards that match the color of her explorer.<br/><br/>Each player secretly chooses a movement card, then they reveal these cards simultaneously; someone also reveals the top movement card from Kali's deck. Whichever player has played the highest card moves her explorer token to the first unoccupied space in front of the group, then the player with the next highest card moves her token, and so on. If two or more players reveal the same number, only the one farthest back in the group moves; all other such explorers remain where they started the round. (Kali moves like an explorer. If you play a zero or are at the front of the group when you are supposed to move, you don't move.)<br/><br/>If a player's token lands on a dung heap, she scores three penalty points. If Kali lands in the dung, the player(s) who played the lowest number that round take the penalty instead of Kali.<br/><br/>Whenever Kali or an explorer token leave the space immediately in front of Mambo, the rhino charges, moving until it rams into the token in back of the line and giving that player as many penalty points as the number of spaces Mambo ran. If Mambo rams Kali, then as with the Kali/dung interaction, the player(s) who played the lowest number take the penalty points instead of Kali.<br/><br/>Remove those played movement cards from the game.

From its military origin comes the peculiar quadrilateral structure divided by the main streets. Later, the city developed to become an important political and cultural center and a prosperous trading city, especially for precious goods, thanks to its convenient and efficient river port. Important monuments such as the Gladiator Arena, the horse-racing Stadium, and the famous theater were built, as well as craftsmen's workshops, patrician villas which completed the architectural network of the city.<br/><br/>In Aquileia, players want to become the most powerful figure in the city by trading and building. Each player, representing a wealthy Aquileian patrician, owns a certain number of henchmen (pawns) which he uses for these main activities: sports playing, culture, trading, and building. Each activity can bring expenses, earnings and sometimes victory points (VPs).<br/><br/>Each round begins with a placement phase in which players take turns placing their henchmen on action spaces and their tiebreaker disc on the tiebreaker track. Placing the tiebreaker is mandatory; placing henchmen is not (but you probably want to place them). Once everyone has passed or placed all of their tokens, players resolve the action spaces in numerical order:<br/><br/><br/>    The Mercatus allows players to buy weapons, arms and slave cards, collect money through a die roll, claim four blue dice for use with the Arena and Stadium, and trade one currency for another. (This is the only way to make change, and some actions require specific currencies; if you must pay bronze and have only silver and gold, then you cannot take that action!)<br/>    At the Arena, players compare fighting strength, with that number determined by the starting strength on the action space claimed, the roll of three dice and the playing of slave and weapon cards. The winner gets three bronze coins and either double his strength in VPs or a slave card. The second and third best players receive lesser rewards.<br/>    The Stadium is similar to the Arena, with the horse cards coming into play and the winner receiving gold or silver coins and his choice of two laurel cards; laurel cards deliver 3-10 VPs or are a multiplier for endgame scoring.<br/>    The Theatrum brings a bid for a dual-colored laurel card, with players needing to ante and raise in particular currencies. <br/>    In the Forum, players build villas and private banks, sometimes scoring points for doing so when they pay the specific costs with the proper coins.<br/>    Finally, the Portus gives players a chance to activate their buildings, thereby earning them VPs or money.<br/><br/><br/>After six rounds, the game ends and players score VPs for their hidden point cards and the product of their villas' values times laurel cards of a matching color. (For example, a total of 8 points of blue villas and three blue villa cards equals 24 points.)

You buy, sell and breed horses, manage jockeys and invest the stable's money in training and veterinary facilities and stud breeding programs. You select Cup and League race entrants from the horses and jockeys in your stable that best suit the conditions and are in top form, plan your tactics before the next race, decide on what training is needed and much, much more.<br/><br/>You can keep yourself continuously updated on the state of your stable by logging on to the Track King website, looking at your race results (or watching the races!) and checking out the latest horses on the transfer market. You can also give your jockeys orders for upcoming races and tell the trainers how the horses will train during the week. Track King has been designed to be as simple - or as difficult - as you want it to be. Just entering a couple of races a week using the invitations on your Stables homepage, and setting a simple training routine for your horses will take less than 15 minutes a week. But if you really want to explore, there's all sorts of stats that you can look into to try and get that extra performance from your steeds.<br/><br/>The best thing about Track King is that there's no 'Game Over'. If your stable goes bankrupt, it's possible to reset. And there's also no right or wrong way to play. Just keep trying, experimenting with different parts of the game, and sooner or later you'll hit a good streak of wins in races, or breed a magnificent foal, or train a superb apprentice jockey...each of which will carry you further along the path to being a successful Track King!<br/><br/>Source: The Game Website.<br/><br/>"}, "108222": {"rpgartist": ["Toren Atkinson", "Jonas Bolander", "Dennis Detwiller", "C.

Each Character Card has a normal and a wounded side.<br/><br/>- Equipment Cards:<br/>Equipment Cards represented the different equipment in the game, like a M16, a PSG-1 or a Bulletproof Vest. Characters can be equipped with Equipment Cards, to increase their fight or defense ability. The equipment cards also serve as dice rolls. Each card has a Fate Number printed on it, which is between 0 and 5. In Combat you can play an Equipment Card from your hand to boost your Attack- or Defense-Value and then you always adds the Fate Number from top card of your Equipment Deck to determine the outcome of this action. Equipped Cards are no longer in your Equipment Deck and so their Fate Numbers are no longer in the dice pool. If your characters have good equipment, than the player will have fewer good Fate Numbers in his Deck. So each player has to find the right balance between right equipment and the remaining Fate Numbers in his deck.<br/><br/>- Terrain Cards:<br/>A Terrain Card represents a part of the arena, where the characters compete against each other.

One was to reflect the slower rate of fire for matchlock weapons. That was easy enough.<br/><br/>The second was to bring in the flair and 'swashbuckling' aspects of the period into the rules. It is often forgotten that schools of martial arts were as thorough and widespread in Europe as they were in Japan in the 1500's through the 1600's. There were all kinds of flashy moves and clever tricks.<br/><br/>So the rules weave in this kind of option to do more than simply move-attack-resolve-repeat. More than just strict combat options, the Swashbuckling rules allow you to be more interactive with your terrain. It opens up more of the game to narrative, or story-telling wargaming.

Move is the distance the unit can move in inches, Attack the number of attacks per turn (most units have only one).<br/><br/>Each game turn, units move or fire, then combat between units in contact is resolved (each unit adds a 2d6 roll to its STRIKE rating, the unit with the lowest result loses 2 points of STRENGTH). After combat resolution, units that have suffered losses must pass a morale test or rout. A routing unit must test morale again in the next turn and is removed from the game if it fails that second test.<br/><br/>The rules also include a few special rules for flank attacks, cover, fortifications and siege engines.<br/><br/>The rules come with a scenario (The Battle of Grey Rock) for which colour counters are included in the magazine.<br/><br/>"}, "108349": {"rpgartist": ["(Uncredited)"], "rpgitemversion": ["The Shrouded Shores of Abanfyl"], "poll": [], "name": "The Shrouded Shores of Abanfyl", "rpgdesigner": ["Donovan Hicks", "Derek Schubert"], "rpggenre": ["Fantasy (High Fantasy)"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1092381.jpg", "usersrated": "0", "rpgsetting": ["Greyhawk"], "rpgproducer": ["Samuel D.

The player also had the option of playing as a famous bass anglers such as Tom Mann Jr. and Hank Parker.<br/><br/>Once the player had selected a mode they then had a number of other choices to make. The tackle shop being first, the player would purchase various lures, rods, motors, depth sounders and other fishing implements. From here the player could practice skill in the practice pond, or begin fishing in their first tournament. While there were a few different lakes that could be unlocked the gameplay remained the same. The player would begin by driving their boat to a spot on the lake they believed would yield the most fish. There they would cast and the screen would switch from overhead view to an underwater camera. The player would then entice the fish into biting their lure and a fight would then ensue.<br/><br/>While no previous knowledge of fishing is needed to enjoy the game, various strategies can help the player.

This, combined with flowing, moderately deep water makes for little plant growth. The river flows from SSE to N, with rock slides in a small, eroded oxbow in the northern portion of the east arm of the river.<br/>    Bronze Lake - Bronze Lake is the site of the Pro Bass Tournament. Bronze Lake was formerly a farm valley before the river was dammed, as evidenced by the underwater buildings. A man-made reservoir, the largest signs of humanity are the dam at the southern end, and a garbage dump in a cove in the north east corner. Dead trees, flooded when the river was dammed, are located near the dam, on either side of the lake.<br/>    Bluestone Lake - Chosen as the site of the Bassin' World Championship, Bluestone Lake likely gets its name from its depth, from which it receives its deep blue coloring.

After this, the player dons a suit of powered armor and descends to the planet's surface to hunt down the Slugs (which actually resemble green blobs capable of splitting and combining, if necessary). Once this is finished, any additional tasks (such as speaking to people, opening up passages to the different machines) can be completed, or the player can return to the Dire Wolf and head to the next planet.

The boxers are represented by 2D sprites seen from over the shoulder of one of the fighters. The title of the game refers to the famous boxing magazine, The Ring, which the game is licensed to associate itself with. The following famous middleweight boxers are represented in the game: Sugar Ray Leonard, Roberto Dur&aacute;n, Thomas Hearns, James Toney, Marvin Hagler, Jake LaMotta, Sugar Ray Robinson, and Rocky Graziano.<br/><br/>A special version was released in Mexico called Chavez II; the game exchanged the English language words for Spanish and omitted some vocals.<br/><br/>During fights, it is possible to keep track of the participating boxers' well-being by observing the small portraits of the fighters' faces at the top of the screen. As the fighters receive punishment, these portraits show injuries such as cuts and bruises, the severity of which indicate the fighter's health (or lack of). There is also a boxing glove shaped meter at the top of the screen, that indicates how much power a boxer has left in his punches (as in a real fight, the more punches boxers throw, the more tired they become, resulting in weaker punches).<br/><br/>The fighters' movement about the ring is limited to side-stepping left or right; it is impossible to step back or forward. A variety of punches can be thrown; left jabs, crosses to the head, hooks to the body, and uppercuts to the head (all punches except jabs can be thrown with either hand). It is also possible to throw a limited number of so-called 'super punches', that are essentially either a right cross or a right uppercut, but with extra power. At the start of each round, each boxer is capable of throwing one super-punch at any time, although it becomes possible to throw one more with each knockdown they score against their opponent. Defensive techniques consist of blocking, dodging, and clinching. Each boxer has three attributes: 'power', 'stamina', and 'chin'.<br/>A scene of one of the boxing matches against Roberto Dur&aacute;n.<br/><br/>There are three different modes: 'exhibition', 'career',and 'battle of the legends'. In 'exhibition' mode, a player can choose to fight as any boxer in the game, against any boxer in the game, against either the console or another player. In 'career' mode, a player creates their own boxer, and fights their way through all the boxers in the game, before fighting for the world title. If the player loses once in 'career' mode, he is given a warning that 'game over' would be given for the second loss; giving the player no alternative but to either use a password or start over again with a new boxer.<br/><br/>Each fight is seen from behind and slightly to one side of one of the boxers, so that the player appears to be looking over their shoulder, in the direction of their opponent.  Between each round, girls in bikinis announce the next round by showing a number around the ring (and to the player).<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;Boxing Legends of the Ring&quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "108417": {"poll": [], "name": "The Brainies", "videogamemode": ["Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["North American SNES edition"], "average": "0", "videogametheme": ["Puzzle"], "usersrated": "0", "videogamedeveloper": ["Titus Software"], "videogamegenre": ["Puzzle"], "videogameplatform": ["SNES"], "statistics": [], "videogamepublisher": ["Titus Software"], "description": "The Brainies is a puzzle game released on the Super Nintendo Entertainment System console and Atari ST, Amiga, and Amstrad CPC computers.

The world experiences strange weather, pirates and gangs loot, and other players get revenge for your own actions against them (or just simply doing better than they are).  Technology isn't exactly your friend as the cranky and failure prone (Reconfigurable Industrial Gathering Systems) RIGS will produce but with the risk of spontaneously blowing up.  Unfortunately, they are the key tools for industry... and the only one available.<br/><br/>Players are grant plots of land, survey the land for Luxuries (the only thing the rest of the universe wants), place RIGS on plots, and hope for the best as Disaster and other players strike.  Weather the disasters that affect your production, resources, and RIGS.  Manage to produce not only Luxuries, but other needed Energy, Metal, Supply resources to keep your operation running and growing.  Then, sell the Luxuries on the ever-changing market.  Make deals with other players for simple trades or pacts against other players.  In the end, final value of all resources a player has (except RIGS... no one wants those troublesome things) is determined.

The main battle, Fuentes de O&ntilde;oro, has an A2 map and the two smaller ones have A3 maps. The game include 216 counters and markers.<br/><br/>Foz do Arouce, 15th March 1811<br/>The fight took place just after Redhina and Casal Novo but before Sabugal and Fuentes de Onoro, as Wellington followed Massena out of the lines of Torres Vedras. It included two popular British divisions, the 3rd and the Light. The French under Ney held a ridge with a river behind it that was crossed by a single bridge. The French ridge on their left was much higher than the one on the right. In the centre there was a gap of about 200 yards, occupied by the village of Foz d'Arouce. Some companies of the 95th rifles penetrated down a hollow road there, almost unopposed, quite close to the bridge. The rest of the Light division held Marchand in a frontal fight on the French right. Half of Mermet&rsquo;s division on the French left faced the 3rd Division. The 39th lost its eagle in the river as they tried to cross a deep ford below the bridge, and many men were drowned.<br/><br/>Fuentes de O&ntilde;oro, 3rd to 5th May 1811<br/>On the 3rd of May, Mass&eacute;na launched a frontal assault against the British-Portuguese pickets holding the barricaded village, while subjecting the British-Portuguese on the heights east of the village to a heavy artillery bombardment. The village was the centre of the fighting for the whole day, with French soldiers of Ferey's and Marchand's divisions clashing with the British redcoats of the 1st and 3rd Divisions. May 4 saw little combat. Both sides recovered from the ferocity of the previous day of fighting and reconsidered their options and battle plans. A French reconnaissance revealed that Wellington's right flank was weakly held by a unit of partisans near the hamlet of Pozo Bello. Action began again at dawn on the 5th of May. Wellington had left the 7th Division exposed on his right flank. Mass&eacute;na launched a heavy attack on the weak British-Portuguese flank, led by Montbrun's dragoons and supported by the infantry divisions of Marchand, Mermet and Solignac. Right away, two 7th Division battalions were roughed up by French light cavalry. This compelled Wellington to send reinforcements to save the 7th Division from annihilation. This was only achieved by the efforts of the Light Division and the British and King's German Legion cavalry. In response, Wellington counterattacked with units from the 1st and 3rd Divisions, plus the Portuguese 6th Ca&ccedil;adores. Led by the 88th Connaught Rangers Foot, this effort broke Drouet's attack and the tide began to turn. Low on ammunition, the French had to resort to the bayonet in a futile attempt to drive the British back. Drouet launched a second attack on the town. This time it was led by three battalions of converged grenadiers from IX Corps. With their old-fashioned bearskin hats, the grenadiers were mistaken for the Imperial Guard. Again, the British fell back. Drouet threw in about half of the battalions from both Conroux and Clapar&egrave;de's divisions, seizing almost the entire town. The French artillery tried to bombard the new British line into submission, but they were outgunned by Wellington's cannon. Finally, with their artillery ammunition dangerously low, the French attacks came to an end. Wellington's men entrenched during the evening.<br/><br/>El Bodon 25th September 1811<br/>The fight included a French cavalry force of 2500, against a mixed force of Picton&rsquo;s 3rd Division consisting of 1000 men, 500 cavalry and two Portuguese batteries. The French attacked in 3 columns of cavalry with a 4th column in reserve, &quot;since only parts of the hillside were open ground suitable for cavalry.&quot; The attack fell upon the isolated part of Wallace&rsquo;s Brigade covering the road. As the French columns came up the slope they were attacked by Alten&rsquo;s light cavalry one squadron at a time &quot;with the slope in their favour.&rdquo; The individual squadrons then rallied behind their supports.

Seta USA created the English version of the game. The Japanese version is copyrighted in 1992, and the English version is copyrighted in 1993.<br/><br/>The player may control one of three characters, Jack (Hii (\u30d2\u30fc) in the Japanese version), Jean (Jin (\u30b8\u30f3)), or RB93 (Cacomaru (\u30ab\u30b3\u30de\u30eb Kakomaru)), in a puzzle game. Wagamama (\u30ef\u30ac\u30de\u30de\u30fc Wagamam\u0101) the queen of a country called Lasyland, has cast a spell and trapped the Princess Ophelia, trapping her in a mirror and causing the Kingdom of Bizyland (Fieldland (\u30d5\u30a3\u30fc\u30eb\u30c9\u30e9\u30f3\u30c9 F\u012brudorando)) to become gray and dismal. King Cacoma calls on the player(s) to save the princess and the kingdom.<br/><br/>Cacoma Knight is a hybrid of action and puzzle elements. Each level is a single screen. The first image that the player sees is a landscape, for example, a forest or a town. The image will then fade into a &quot;corrupt&quot; version of the landscape, for example, the trees become rotten and buildings become ruined. Each screen has a &quot;Qualify&quot; target that shows how much of the screen must be cleared before the game continues to the next level. The player can then use the Magical Chalk to section off an area of the landscape, using either the borders of existing cleared sections or the borders of the screen. When a full shape is completed with no holes in its borders, the smaller of the two sections created is &quot;purified&quot; and returned to the original state shown at the beginning of the level. In the cleared section, there may be power-ups or items that increase the point score of the player. Therefore, a greater &quot;% Cleared&quot; score means more points and power-ups will be rewarded, so it is beneficial to the player to attempt to clear as much of the screen as possible before exceeding the Qualify target.<br/><br/>Enemies can impede progress of the player and come in various shapes, sizes and speeds. Some enemies can only move along the borders of the screen and the chalk lines that the player creates, others have free rein of the screen within given borders. Enemies can be destroyed by trapping them within an area of chalk, however, they will repopulate quickly thereafter. The player must avoid getting hit by enemies. If the player allows the character to get hit by the enemies too many times (based on the difficulty), they will be brought to a continue screen. Continuing costs one Credit, of which the player has a predetermined amount based on the difficulty that they are playing on. If the player runs out of the Credits, the game ends.<br/><br/>A visual measure of progress is implemented between rounds in the game (a round includes several landscapes that the player must complete). When a player completes a round, an incomplete image is shown which is slowly filled in as the player completes more and more rounds.<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;Cacoma Knight in Bizyland&quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "108444": {"rpgdesigner": ["Steven S.
