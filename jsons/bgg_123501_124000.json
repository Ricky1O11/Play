It contains a wide array of feats that are, as the title suggests, horrifically overpowered. The only way these feats can be considered &ldquo;balanced&rdquo; is that they can make any character horrifically overpowered, so allowing them all into a campaign gives all the players (and monsters, and NPCs, and even minions) a chance to be ridiculously super-powered. And as long as everyone is super, it&rsquo;s all balanced out, right?<br/><br/>No, we know. Just... run with it a second, okay?<br/><br/>We&rsquo;re not suggesting any GM should allow these feats into a campaign. In fact, we advise against it.

The product is even being released on April 1st, 2012. April 1st. Get it?<br/><br/>Of course a GM can add these to a campaign. It&rsquo;s a bad idea, but the feats are all mechanically sound (in that they follow the normal format of feats and work with the normal rules of the game), and their effect on a character&rsquo;s abilities is clearly spelled out. It&rsquo;s just that these feats have a significantly greater impact on a character&rsquo;s overall effectiveness than any feat in the game&rsquo;s official rules. Heck, they have a significantly greater impact than any feat Super Genius Games has ever published. They do much more than a feat is supposed to do. They do so much, in fact, that there&rsquo;s no way to grant the benefits these feats represent without making whatever character receives them much, much more powerful than characters are supposed to be.<br/><br/>In many ways, these feats are classic bad examples, doing exactly the sorts of things feats shouldn&rsquo;t.

In myths and legends, rangers borrow from ancient sources such as the Greek and Roman goddess of Artemis and Diana. Medieval and later tales included the vigilante and guerilla freedom-fighter Robin Hood, the Huntsman of Grimm&rsquo;s Snow White fairy tale, and even Jack the Giant-Killer. In modern fantasy fiction, the ranger borrows from a wide range of royal-blooded striders, dark elven renegades, and bowler-wearing steampunk bounty hunters. Even real-world modern rangers influence the class, including park rangers, the Texas Rangers, and US Army Rangers.<br/><br/>Despite these extremely varied sources, the ranger of the core rules is surprisingly lacking in customization. While numerous archetypes have been published to somewhat expand a ranger&rsquo;s options, outside of those the ranger only gets to decide what his areas of specialization are &ndash; what kinds of combat feats, what types of terrain, and what favored enemies he is best at defeating. None of these choices have the impact on play style or character focus that a cleric&rsquo;s choice of domains does, or a sorcerer&rsquo;s choice of bloodline. Further, a ranger&rsquo;s customization is often strongly suggested by a campaign&rsquo;s setting (a game set in the desert near a gnoll empire makes it unlikely a ranger will choose to be at his best against giants in a forest).<br/><br/>But where are the rangers who love plants, but hate (and don&rsquo;t get along with) animals? How does a player build a ranger focused more on nature magic than combat? Many players aren&rsquo;t as concerned about their rangers being particularly combat effective (though it&rsquo;s always helpful), as much as making them feel like something more than a fighter with a few multiclass levels of druid. To help in that regard, Ranger Options: Knacks of Nature presents a number of new ranger-specific abilities (knacks) that can be taken in place of traditional ranger class features to customize, expand, and enhance the way a ranger can be played.<br/><br/>"}, "123556": {"rpgdesigner": ["Darrin Drader"], "rpg": ["Pathfinder System Compatible Product"], "statistics": [], "name": "Annals of the Archfiends: Phosonith the Cruel Charmer", "rpgartist": ["RedPeggy", "Shaman's Stockart", "Gabriel Verdon"], "rpgproducer": ["Jeremy Miller", "R.

Daredevils may be stunt men, masked vigilantes, professional escapists, espionage agents, or military commandos given missions regular soldiers know better than to accept.<br/><br/>Or course many are also delvers into mysteries they keep being warned &ldquo;man was not meant to know,&rdquo; and as a result thrust into a typical fantasy campaign.<br/><br/>The &ldquo;modern&rdquo; person of great bravery and skill getting stuck in a more primitive, fantasy-themed world is a common trope in a great deal of adventure fiction, especially the &ldquo;time travel adventure fiction&rdquo; more common in the early part of the 20th century than today, but still very popular with a wide range of gamers (and game writers). The daredevil is the third in a line of Anachronistic Adventurers products designed to provide rules for running modern (or near-modern) heroes in a typical fantasy roleplaying game setting. While it&rsquo;s impossible to address every possible issue that might arise for such characters (can the adherent of a modern, real-world religion become a cleric?), each product in the line will look at one area where the modern and fantasy realms are most likely to overlap and give guidance for running heroic anachronisms.<br/><br/>We also present rules for ritual magic, the dangerous tool of mad cultists and mystics often opposed by anachronistic adventures, but also a power the bravest (or most foolhardy) of heroes sometimes seek to claim as their own. Finally we touch on the idea of Progress Levels (PL), a simple way to determine the general technological advancement of a campaign (and outlined in more detail in Anachronistic Adventurers: The Enforcer).<br/><br/>"}, "123558": {"rpgdesigner": ["Monte Cook"], "rpg": ["Pathfinder System Compatible Product"], "statistics": [], "name": "The Tomb-World of Alak-Ammur", "rpgartist": ["Sterling Hershey", "Chris McFann", "Shaman's Stockart"], "rpgproducer": ["Tom Lommel", "Jeremy Miller", "R.

His origins lie hidden behind a veil of lies and half-truths so thick that it is useless to even speak of them. Know simply this, that Alak-Ammur grew strong in the ways of arcane lore as easily and quickly as other men take to breathing fresh air.<br/><br/>Few were surprised, even in his own time--or at least all records seem to indicate--when Alak-Ammur disappeared mysteriously. Most of his kinsmen and peers assumed that he had died, although in truth he had neither kinsmen nor peers. But assumptions about men like Alak-Ammur are so often wrong that it hardly seems worth relating that they were.<br/><br/>But they were.<br/><br/>The sorcerer left the world of his birth and explored the myriad worlds beyond. He lived for a thousand more years than his fellows knew, for he never returned to that place he had once called home. When it came time for him to die--when his body could no longer continue to house his spirit--he used his magic to fashion a tomb for himself. But Alak-Ammur&rsquo;s tomb would be no more a normal crypt than he was a normal man.<br/><br/>True to his nature--and his nature was power, pure and simple--Alak-Ammur crafted for himself a world in which to put his physical form to eternal rest. Not a large world, as world&rsquo;s go, but truly an entire world as distinct and unreachable from any other world as, well, another world.<br/><br/>If one could find this tomb-world, surely it would hold great secrets, it would solve vast mysteries, and it would make one wealthy and powerful beyond imagining. If such a deed could be done at all--and survived.<br/><br/>The Tomb-World of Alak-Ammur is a mini-adventure for 12th-level PCs written by legendary designer Monte Cook.

If a player wishes to create similarly flexible characters they often have little choice but to multiclass, often only &ldquo;level dipping&rdquo; to pick up just enough of a class&rsquo;s iconic abilities to justify a complex background.<br/><br/>Ultimate Combat and Ultimate Magic introduced feats that created alternatives to level dipping: Amateur Gunslinger and the Eldritch Heritage line of feats. These feats give characters enough of the features of another base class to allow players to create characters with concepts that are &ldquo;multiclassed&rdquo; without level dipping, or wrestling with any of the complex questions that come up when taking levels in multiple classes. Inspired by these feats (which have been reproduced here for purposes of including all multiclass feat options in one place), The Genius Guide to Feats of Multiclassing applies this same idea to other base classes, allowing players to build characters that touch on the abilities of the alchemist, barbarian, bard, cavalier, cleric, druid, fighter, inquisitor, magus, monk, oracle, paladin, ranger, rogue, sorcerer, summoner, witch, and wizard without taking on levels from multiple classes.<br/><br/>This means, of course, that this product is not for anyone who dislikes blurring distinctions between classes. That said, the multiclass feats can actually be excellent ways to help sharpen the distinctions between characters, by giving players one more set of options to customize their character choices. Three fighters are going to make a lot of the same choices, but if one has focused on his fiendish heritage (with the eldritch heritage line of feats), one on his duty to a knightly order (with Squire and Champion of the Order) and one on his training as a warrior of the Clan of the Bear (with Berserker, Wodewose and Skin Walker), the characters are going to feel very different even as they take on the same basic tasks of dealing damage to foes. The lines between classes may be blurry, but the characters have grown in distinctiveness as a result.<br/><br/>"}, "123560": {"rpgartist": ["V.

Shepherds move from one rest stop to another, with the first movement being free and all others on the same turn costing 1 coin. When you buy a terrain, you can purchase the top tile of either of the two terrain types next to your shepherd. When you move a sheep, you move one sheep from a region adjacent to your shepherd to the other region adjacent to that piece, i.e., you lead the sheep across the road to a greener pastures &ndash; well, greener for you, if all goes well.<br/><br/>Each time you move the shepherd, you place a fence in the rest stop from which it started moving, making that location off-limits for the rest of the game. During the game some regions become inaccessible, and if they are full of sheep, naturally there's a rush for the tiles. The lone black sheep in the game, which is worth two points, serves as a semi-random element, possibly moving to an adjacent region each turn while still being movable by shepherds as long as it's not fenced in.<br/><br/>After twenty fences have been placed, you end the round so that all players have the same number of turns, then you count up the points.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": ["Multilingual first edition", "Spanish edition"], "average": "6.65169", "name": "Sheepland", "videogamebg": ["Sheepland"], "playingtime": "30", "boardgamemechanic": ["Action Point Allowance System", "Area Movement", "Dice Rolling", "Point to Point Movement", "Stock Holding"], "age": "8", "usersrated": "692", "boardgamesubdomain": ["Family Games"], "boardgamefamily": ["Animals: Sheep"], "boardgamepodcastepisode": ["DJ103: Sheepland (2012) Simone Luciani + Daniele Tascini"]}, "123578": {"rpgartist": ["Howard Finch", "Richard Mans"], "rpgitemversion": ["PDF Version"], "poll": [], "name": "Age of Ruin", "rpgdesigner": ["Greg Porter"], "rpgproducer": ["Thomas Devine", "Alan Kellogg", "Jasper Merendino"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1292723.jpg", "usersrated": "0", "average": "0", "statistics": [], "rpg": ["EABA"], "rpgpublisher": ["BTRC (Blacksburg Tactical Research Center)"], "rpgcategory": ["Sourcebook (rules/options to enhance play)"], "rpggenre": ["Science Fiction"], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1292723_t.jpg", "description": "(From page 5, author's notes)<br/>Age of Ruin forces you back to basics.

The 16-page instruction manual includes directions for six simple math games, including Spider's Web, Big Numbers, Match Points, On the House, Shout Out and Prime Time.<br/><br/>Spider's Web: <br/>The dice are rolled onto a bull's eye board divided into eight pie sections labelled one through eight.  Depending on where the die landed, it is multiplied, added or subtracted from the number of the pie piece in which it landed.  No points are scored for dice which land in the exact center or off the board completely.  The winner is the first to reach a score of 300.<br/><br/>Big Numbers: <br/>Using the same board as Spider's Web, players roll the three dice onto the board, then scramble to be the first to find the largest three-digit number possible, using either the face value of the dice or the number slices into which they landed.  This game teaches place value and the winner is the first to reach 2,000.<br/><br/>Match Points: <br/>Each player rolls one die onto the spider web board, making a fraction with the smaller of the die or number slice value (on which the die landed) being the numerator.  When a player has collected enough fractions to be one or greater, he scores a point and starts over collecting fractions.  The first player to collect five whole numbers wins.<br/><br/>On the House:<br/>Using the game board with six numbered houses, each player rolls one die onto the game board.  If the die matches any digit in the house square on which it landed, the player scores.  Scoring involves adding each of the digits of the three-digit number on the board together, then multiplying by the die value.  The winner is the first player to reach 250 points.<br/><br/>Shout Out:<br/>A designated shooter rolls two dice off the board and one die onto the haunted house board.  Depending on which of the six house squares the die lands, all players race to perform the required math operations on the three dice first.  The first player to be the first ten times wins.<br/><br/>Prime Time:<br/>Each player rolls the three dice onto the haunted house board, then looks for prime numbers amongst the sum of the die and door number, the dice themselves and the door numbers themselves.  Any missed primes may be stolen by other players.  The first player to reach 100 points is the winner.<br/><br/>"}, "123591": {"rpgartist": ["Storn Cook", "Ben Overmyer"], "rpgitemversion": ["PDF version"], "statistics": [], "name": "Red Blizzard (Savage Worlds Edition)", "rpgdesigner": ["Shannon Patrick", "Kevin Rohan"], "rpgproducer": ["David Baymiller", "Shannon Patrick", "Kevin Rohan"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1585685.jpg", "usersrated": "1", "average": "6.5", "rpggenre": ["Horror (Supernatural)", "Modern"], "rpgpublisher": ["Silver Gryphon Games"], "rpg": ["Savage Worlds"], "rpgcategory": ["Scenario / Adventure / Module"], "poll": [], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1585685_t.jpg", "description": "From publisher blurb:<br/><br/>It&rsquo;s a dark and snowy night.

The planet is unfortunately breaking apart and will soon explode.  Your miners must escape while collecting as much ore as possible in the process.<br/><br/>Mother Lode is inspired by an old Parker Brothers board game called Survive! &ndash; one of my favorites as a kid.  This isn&rsquo;t just a straight port, though.  In addition to the change to a space theme, Mother Lode has many other differences to separate it from its roots.<br/><br/>Every turn your miners remain on the planet they will try to mine for ore. Different land types have different chances of success. Each miner can carry up to two more units of ore above their starting amount. It is only this additional amount that is shown to other players. The starting value is hidden until the end of the game when points are tallied.<br/><br/>Land tiles are flipped every turn and actions are taken based on what&rsquo;s underneath. There are fourteen actions available in the game. Some help you directly (boost escape pod, move miner into pod). Others you can choose whether to help yourself or hinder your opponents (warp pirate, squid stalks escape pod). A few make life interesting for all players (new creature, add escape pod, open wormhole).<br/><br/>How you use these abilities and adapt to the game circumstances will determine your success.<br/><br/>Because Mother Lode supports up to four players simultaneously, it is important for players to have a way to view their own information without showing it to opponents. This is accomplished through the player areas in each corner of the board. By holding a touch in this area a player can use their hand to shield their action tiles and miner information from prying eyes. As soon as they release the touch this data immediately becomes hidden again. Multiple players can be doing this at once &ndash; even while the current player is taking their turn on the main board!<br/><br/>Players earn points for miners rescued along with the ore they are carrying. No one knows the final score until all miner values are revealed.

It stood there from 300 years until the kingdom fell in christian hands.<br/>In 1501, Abraham Cohen, a convert merchant from Lucena found it in Granada's Aljaba, and remembered seeing it when he was young, so he took it back to Lucena.<br/>From that moment on, the game's trail was lost.<br/><br/>It was first brought back on May 2001, and it was later launched internationally by Famosa on 2002.<br/><br/>"}, "123617": {"average": "0", "poll": [], "name": "Forfeits", "playingtime": "0", "minplayers": "4", "boardgamemechanic": ["Acting"], "yearpublished": "1950", "usersrated": "0", "boardgamefamily": ["Charades"], "maxplayers": "0", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1394406_t.jpg", "boardgameartist": ["Ernest Shaw"], "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["J & L Randall, Ltd."], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1394406.jpg", "boardgameversion": ["Merit First Edition"], "maxplaytime": "0", "boardgamecategory": ["Humor", "Party Game"], "age": "12", "minplaytime": "0", "description": "A party game, rare for this publisher.

It may also be the earliest example of a free-roaming city environment to feature in a computer game. Turbo Esprit was the first free-roaming driving game, and has been cited as a major influence on the later Grand Theft Auto series.<br/><br/>The object of the game is to prevent a gang of drug smugglers completing a delivery of heroin, by tracking down their cars and destroying them, or ramming them into submission. The player takes the role of a special agent driving the titular Lotus Esprit car, who must travel around one of four available cities looking for the criminals. Messages from HQ will flash up periodically giving the location of a target car, which may then be tracked on the map.<br/><br/>Once the target car is found it must be either destroyed with the Esprit's built-in machine gun, or repeatedly rammed until it surrenders. Different cars may need to be dealt with in different ways; for example armoured cars must be rammed as shooting has no effect, whereas &quot;hit cars&quot; are the only other vehicles that can match the Esprit for speed, so ramming them is more difficult.<br/><br/>Penalties are incurred for hitting scenery or other cars, and the player's car is likely to explode if it crashes into anything while travelling fast. As in real life, speeding greatly increases risk.<br/><br/>The game features four free-roaming cities (Wellington, Gamesborough, Minster and Romford) through which the player may drive as they see fit. Each city features a grid plan of roads, and each is progressively more difficult; the first city contains many six lane motorway-like roads making speeding and dodging traffic easy, whereas the later ones have more two-lane and one-way roads.<br/><br/>The cities contain many computer-controlled cars, all of which obey basic traffic laws, such as keeping below a set speed limit, stopping at the working traffic lights, moving out of the way of obstacles such as roadworks, and attempting to avoid head-on collisions with the player. They will also stop at zebra crossings to allow waiting pedestrians to cross the road. Contact with or destruction of these cars results in score penalties.<br/><br/>The Spanish version claims it to be set in the city of Manhattan, despite the fact that no changes were made to the game itself, which retains its British-style road markings and driving on the left.<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;Turbo Esprit&quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/><br/>User Summary<br/><br/>This game is similar to the Grand Theft Auto franchise.<br/><br/>"}, "123625": {"poll": [], "name": "Bobby Bearing", "videogamemode": ["Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["Commodore 64 edition", "English/European Amstrad CPC edition", "English/European ZX Spectrum edition"], "average": "0", "videogametheme": ["Abstract"], "usersrated": "0", "videogamedeveloper": ["(Self-Developed Video Game)"], "videogamegenre": ["Adventure", "Arcade"], "videogameplatform": ["Amstrad CPC", "Commodore 64", "ZX Spectrum"], "statistics": [], "videogamepublisher": ["Edge Games"], "description": "Bobby Bearing is an isometric 3D arcade adventure game  developed by Robert and Trevor Figgins.<br/><br/>Bobby and his family are ball bearings who live in Technofear, &quot;a land of the future made of steel, and inhabitated by things of steel.&quot;  Bobby's brothers have been led astray by their rogue cousin and are now lost in the Metaplanes outside their home - stunned and captured by the evil Bearings that inhabit the Planes.<br/><br/>The player controls Bobby Bearing in his search for his four lost brothers and their cousin.

Uniquely it holds the claim of being the first video game to ever simulate amusement rides.<br/><br/>Roller Coaster was developed by S. Brocklehurst and was, for a time, one of the most popular games for the ZX Spectrum.<br/><br/>The game takes place in and around an amusement park after closing-time.  The player takes control of a protagonist who sneaks into the amusement park after both staff and customers have left. The goal is to collect money &mdash; in the form of little money bags &mdash; which have been dropped by excited and clumsy members of the public throughout the day. It appears that the protagonist is a trespasser and a thief, although neither his identity nor his motives are elaborated on further.<br/><br/>n order to complete the game, the player must collect every money bag which is strewn around the city-sized amusement park; even the money bags placed on precarious perches and in the middle of rides. In order to do this, gambles and risks will have to be taken. When riding an attraction, timing your jumps carefully is essential to survival and completing the game.<br/><br/>The player's information bar is at the bottom of the screen. It reveals the player's score, which is the same as the amount of money collected. Each money bag retrieved earns you &pound;100; this is displayed as 100 points and not &pound;100.<br/><br/>The information bar also reveals the previous high score for any other game played during the session (since the game was last loaded up, that is.) This is useful since you will likely die often and have to replay the game from the start; you may want to compare your present score to previous games you have played in order to determine your progress in comparison.<br/><br/>There is also a bar which indicates the health of the character, which informs the player if something is harming the protagonist. This may be caused by, for example, standing on an electric rail. When the character is perfectly healthy the bar is simply empty and black; however if the protagonist is being harmed, a tombstone with the word &quot;RIP&quot; will begin to appear (accompanied by a high-pitch squeaking noise). Quick action by escaping the danger may result in a partial and incomplete tombstone, in which case the character will live. However once the tombstone is complete, the character's health is utterly depleted and the character dies.<br/><br/>Apart from having his health be depleted until death, the character can also be killed instantaneously by some dangers. This can be caused by numerous careless acts such as jumping from a great height, getting skewered by an erratic turnstile, or falling into water (despite his numerous athletic abilities, it appears the protagonist cannot swim and drowns when falling into water.) Falling a distance from a height will probably get you killed more often than any other danger.<br/><br/>The player has ten lives. Once the protagonist has died ten times, the player loses and the game is over.<br/><br/>What made the game more difficult was the lack of a scrolling screen; different screens are stationary and open up to the player as you enter them, unlike a side-scroller. In this way the player never knows what is around the corner until the last second. The game is made up of a total of sixty screens.<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;Roller Coaster (video game)&quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "123629": {"rpgdesigner": ["Wolfgang Baur", "Jobe Bittman", "Jesse Butler", "Jarrod Camir\u00e9", "Matthew Cicci", "Tim Connors", "Eileen Connors", "Adam Daigle", "Mike Franke", "Crystal Frasier", "Scott L.

The object of the game is to save citizens of Metropolis (playing as Superman) or lure them to your underground lair (playing as Darkseid).<br/><br/>The game area is split into six sectors; 3 in the streets of Metropolis and 3 underground. Frantic citizens are running around the city and can be directed by deflectors (which can be set in certain directions) or by using super powers (Superman can pick up and carry citizens, Darkseid can teleport them). The players cannot leave a sector until they collect a diamond (or a number of diamonds depending on the difficulty setting). They then get to choose which sector to move to. In between each sector is a 'combat zone' mini-game These come in a variety of styles. If the player who chose to leave the sector wins, the game moves on to the chosen sector. If they lose, play returns to the previous sector. In the sectors, the players can fire beams of set lengths (Superman uses heat vision, Darkseid fires an omega ray). If they hit, the enemy loses energy and also drops any diamonds collected. These beams are also directed by the deflectors.<br/><br/>The game ends when there are no more citizens running around or one of the players' energy bars is fully drained.

Telecomsoft released the Spectrum version for the first time at a budget price in 1986. In 1987 Prism Leisure Corporation published the game.

The game takes the form of many early platform games in that the player must jump from platform to platform and climb ropes in order to move across the screen from a fixed starting point to the goal while avoiding deadly enemies. The main twist in this game is that the platforms are not as they seem when the level begins. Some platforms will turn to fire when walked on (and so kill the player), others cannot be seen until walked on (so will appear out of thin air). There is no way of knowing which platforms will change when starting out so the player must use trial and error and memory to work out the correct path. This is made more difficult by the fact that the levels are not played in sequence.

Turrican's sprite was changed into a marine and several other substitutions were made. Amongst other changes, the eyeballs-walking-on-fingers became mini tanks, and instead of a large mech/steel dragon in the first stage, the player now faces a large representation of Dolph Lundgren's character in the movie. The three shoot 'em up stages, cut out from the port, were replaced by the developers with three original stages (a Vietnam jungle, a fortress, and a motel/car junkyard) that in theory should link the game to the movie's atmosphere. The rest of the original Turrican II stages are still present and remain mostly intact in overall design, though some of them appear in different order, along with the three new levels differently scattered through them.

The game runs on Amstrad CPC, Commodore 64, MSX and Sinclair ZX Spectrum.<br/><br/>The hero of the game is Carlin, a naked man who has been mugged and stripped, and needs to find all of his clothes. Carlin is in a town on the planet Zuggi, which resembles a town in Earth in many ways, with locations including an hotel, a cafe, a supermarket and a chemist's shop. As Streaker finds more clothes, he is able to enter more and more locations. The game is won when he is fully dressed.<br/><br/>The game is an arcade adventure, somewhere between a puzzle-based adventure game and an action game. Gameplay is controlled through a nested menu system, as in Mastertronic's Spellbound. There are a multitude of items in the game, many of which can be used and some of which seem to have no purpose. Streaker can pick up keys to open doors, eat food items to raise his hunger levels, and needs to solve a number of simple puzzles.<br/><br/>While most aspects of life on Zuggi are very similar to Earth, there are a number of fantastic elements in the world. For example, Streaker may teleport (&quot;beam transfer&quot;) by using a number of different coloured beamers. These will teleport Streaker to the location of the corresponding beampad. These beampads can be moved by Streaker and are a good way to avoid thieves. Nice touches include Streaker's ability to advance time by acquiring a stopwatch (the game is played in real time, and you often need to wait for a particular location to open) and the &quot;Save&quot; and &quot;Load&quot; options appearing after Streaker picks up a Tape Recorder.<br/><br/>Streaker's quest is made more difficult by the presence of a number of thieves. They will steal Streaker's clothes on contact, or cause him to lose a life if he is naked. The clothes may be regained from the thieves by finding and offering the thief an item that he wants.<br/><br/>The thieves are as follows:<br/><br/>Abner: Plays rugby for the pub team. He is terrified of the dark.<br/>    Faust: Used to be good at tricks - now gambles and drinks.<br/>    Jasper: Shops for the hotel - he may be the key to a fortune.<br/>    Cyclops: Is a big eater, he also has an eye for helpful groupiers.<br/>    Golem (n.b. not Gollum): Loves science, robotics and dining out.<br/>    Ladon: Is always on the lookout for sporty visitors.

The more sheep a player can have, the more score a player can get.

After that he places a fence  on the connecting side of to farms to hurd sheep optionally. Fences cannot be placed next to trees.

Players take the role of the Field Commander of an army of the period, attempting to fulfill victory conditions using mounted and foot arms of the period.<br/><br/>Players use arms of the period including men-at-arms, both mounted and dismounted, infantry including archers, and when available, early firearms.<br/><br/>Order of Arms is descended from and related to the 3rd edition of the grand tactical Napoleonic game Eagles of the Empire. Players familiar with that game will recognize many features of that system present here in Order of Arms. However (and this is a BIG however), there are significant differences between Eagles of the Empire and Order of Arms; most notably the scale at which Order of Arms portrays its combat, and the resulting procedures that emphasize unit to unit fighting. Moreover, where the queen of the battlefield in Napoleon's time was the linear Infantry formation, in Order of Arms, the dominant unit up until near the very end of the period covered, was the Mounted Men-at-Arms (MMA); the armored knight; the result of which is that the long playing piece in Order of Arms is the MMA unit.<br/><br/>Fornovo 1495, the first game in the series presents the battle fought between the French Army of King Charles VIII, and the Condottieri forces of the League of Venice under the command of Francesco II Gonzaga of Mantua.

The SPORTS EVENT card is drawn, every player must 'pay' to enter the sport, and then using the GET SET deck, that includes 5 cards per person at the outset, each player 'bids' for the event by using their skill, experience, and training against each other competitor. The winner of the Sports event keeps the SPORTS EVENT CARD, as well as takes the honorarium designated on the card, plus the cash of all the other competitors in the event. The aim is to get enough sports event cards to qualify for a coach (if you don't get a coach by other means) and a sponsor, so that you can move up to national and global competition.<br/><br/>When landing on other spaces like HOST CITY, a Host City Card is<br/>drawn, and specs followed.

Wellington considered Assaye the toughest battle in which he ever fought. (And readers of Bernard Cornwell&rsquo;s first three Sharpe books will find this familiar territory). Each of these battles is on a half-map,  at 120 yards per hex, with combat units being half-battalions (well, two counters for a full battalion). The Mahrattas have lots of artillery. Good artillery, too&hellip;  according to Wellesley &ldquo;&hellip; the finest brass ordnance I have ever seen.&rdquo;<br/><br/><br/>Each battle has its own opening maneuvers, along with heavy barrages of cannon, followed by bloodletting hand-to-hand combat.

The game combined some stylistic elements of RPGs such as a fantasy theme and multiple characters with that of board games to create a unique twist to the quiz game genre.<br/>The game plays similar to a board game, where the player is given a predetermined dice roll that moves the player up to six spaces on the board; however, if the player is so given the choice, he can move to a space of his choosing if there is a fork in the road. After landing on a space, the player is given a series of questions (The amount of questions needed to be answered increase as the game progresses) in order to proceed back to the board for another dice roll. The player is given a time limit to answer the question, with points given that vary based on how fast the player answered the question correctly. If the player is successful in answering a question, one of the gems above the enemy's picture will light up, indicating a correct answer. If the player answers a question incorrectly, he will lose a life point. if the player loses all life points, the player must continue within the time limit or else the game is over.<br/><br/>There are also two special spaces on the game board that the player may land on. If a player lands on an inn space, An inkeeper will ask him one question. If the player answers the question correctly, the innkeeper will increase his health by two health points. The other space is an elf space. If the player answers the elf's question correctly, he is granted a special skill which will be used in the next round of play. Occasionally, the elf awards the player with a &quot;short cut&quot; award that takes the character all the way to the final space of the stage currently being played on.<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;Quiz &amp; Dragons: Capcom Quiz Game&quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "123788": {"poll": [], "name": "Run in Crowd", "videogamemode": ["Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["Android edition", "Blackberry edition", "iPhone/iPad edition"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1299357.png", "videogametheme": ["Cartoon", "Surreal"], "usersrated": "2", "videogamedeveloper": ["Ursine Paw"], "videogamegenre": ["Action"], "videogameplatform": ["Android", "iPad", "iPhone", "Other Mobile Devices"], "average": "2.5", "statistics": [], "videogamepublisher": ["Ursine Paw"], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1299357_t.png", "description": "&quot;Run In Crowd&quot; is a game where you race alongside other players in a new world each day.

In our game, we attempt to simulate the feeling of being the commander of a Corps commander in the Civil War, notably it&rsquo;s most well known and well studied battle, the Battle of Gettysburg. The desire to simulate a realistic battle has to be weighed against the constraints of time, attention, and ease of play. As such, we&rsquo;ve streamlined the game a good deal since its initial play testing, and hope that you&rsquo;ll find this version of the game easy to learn and play, taking no more than a  few short minutes to get your first game underway. We have also attempted to order the scenarios not only by chronological order, but by complexity. This was done so that you can learn the finer points of strategy as you go along, without feeling bogged down trying to command half the Army of the Potomac.<br/>    Each chit in the game represents roughly one battalion of soldiers, or a single battery of guns. Although historically many of the battalions came from all over the country, and had a variety of names, to keep the game simple, we have avoided putting unit names on the chits, and simply created names for the OOB for each mission. Commander&rsquo;s names have been kept though, and are generally correct in terms of participation in the events they are represented in.<br/>        Players take the role of either a Confederate or Union officer commanding his soldiers, alternating between players. The game is divided into a variety of scenarios to represent individual portions of the battle, and one large &quot;Campaign&quot; scenario. To win the player must complete the objectives stated on the scenario orders, which generally align to the historical goals of the respective commanders. Players move the chits around the map, having to take into account terrain, roads, and overall tactical situation.<br/><br/>"}, "123810": {"rpgartist": ["(Uncredited)"], "rpgitemversion": ["PDF Version"], "poll": [], "name": "Home World and Career Mementos for Dark Heresy", "rpgdesigner": ["Tim Huckelbery"], "rpgproducer": ["Mike Mason"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1292728.png", "usersrated": "3", "rpgsetting": ["Warhammer 40,000"], "average": "5.66667", "statistics": [], "rpg": ["Dark Heresy (1st Edition)"], "rpgpublisher": ["Black Industries", "Fantasy Flight Games"], "rpgcategory": ["Sourcebook (rules/options to enhance play)"], "rpggenre": ["Science Fiction"], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1292728_t.png", "description": "From the introduction:<br/><br/>The following Home World and Career Mementos are an optional component you can use during Character Generation and adds a further degree of colour to your Acolyte's background and personality.

Perhaps Crown Prince may be a more apt name.<br/><br/>The game is played on a large, circular, wooden board on which are printed five concentric rings which are radially divided into eight sections, giving forty spaces or panels in total. The outermost ring or band is gold in colour, the remainder being black or white, in a pattern such that each adjacent pair of sections are of a similar colour and each panel is surrounded on three sides by panels of like colour.<br/><br/>Four sets of playing pieces are supplied. Each set consists of a Prince, two Barons (elephants) and two Viscounts (horses). The pieces are well moulded from resin, each set being in a distinguishing pastel colour. In addition there is a Crown, resembling an up-turned vase. The rules are simple and easy to follow.<br/><br/>The Crown is worn by one of the Princes, who is thus elevated to King. The object of the game is to promote your Prince and then manouevre him to the gold (outer) band. All pieces may be moved in or out one panel, the Prince can be moved an unlimited number of panels in a clockwise or anti-clockwise direction, the Baron only clockwise and the Viscount only anti-clockwise. No diagonal moves are permitted and the only piece allowed to move onto a panel already occupied is the King, and this only to capture. The King is the only piece able to capture other pieces. The Crown is gained by moving a piece onto a panel of the same colour and adjacent to the King, who is then demoted and the new Prince is crowned.<br/><br/>Although not a difficult game to play, Crown Chess does require thought and planning. However, it is rather difficult to formulate strategy because the situation changes so rapidly with four players. The Hints on Play provided advice that the main objective should not be to take the Crown, which should only be done to prevent another player from winning, to prevent possible capture of your pieces or to win the game. As pieces cannot jump over one another, there is a certain amount of aimless movement. and blocks can occur. Princes may not be captured, thus there is no way of forcing them to move. One of the best winning strategies seems to be to move one's Prince onto a panel adjacent to a Gold, keep it protected and wait for other players to blunder, then take the Crown at the opportune moment and make the winning move.<br/><br/>The game does have many unique concepts and apart from the box is extremely well presented.

In it the player creates guilds, temples, inns, marketplaces etc, recruits heroes from these places and set out various rewards to 'persuade' these heroes to explore the lands, battle wandering monsters, and complete quests. The player actually has no direct control over the heroes but rather develops his land to suit them, gives rewards of gold and such. I thought his is rather like the role of the Games Master in a rpg. Here the GM can set up a world and conditions, but rarely has any direct control over the actions of the player.<br/><br/>Secondly, the game fits so well to the dragonquest feel, and especially the guilds and colleges set up. In the computer game your heroes belong to guilds (Warrior, Rogue, Wizard etc) or temples (Fervus, Krypta, Dauros etc). many of these very easily translate to the skill types available in Dragonquest (thief, ranger, troubador etc) and the spell colleges (fire, celestial, lesser summoning etc).<br/><br/>Thirdly, the feel of the computer and epicness of its quests seemed to fit. they way some temples oppose each other, but in other ways guilds and temples compliment each other. Also much to the frustration of the player at times, your heroes just laze around in their guilds, or an inn, or gambling hall or shop, and then occasionally go off and do some adventuring, seem to fit DQ well. In the rpg their is a lot of character 'down-time' where they are paying upkeep fees, guild fees for healers and shapers, weeks of training, adepts sitting at home daring to cast a new spell for the first time etc.<br/><br/>These three points allowed me to combine the rules set of DQ with the feel of Majesty, so here we are.

They do this by attempting to be the most successful at both bringing people into the city as well as campaigning for the citizens' approval. Whoever best balances these two goals will win the election.<br/><br/>There are seven offices within City Hall. These offices deal with a different aspect of building the city or campaigning, such as the Tax Assessor, Surveyor, or Zoning Board. In a round, each player will get to activate one of these offices. However, just because you activate an office doesn't mean you will get to use it. The other players will have an opportunity to use their influence to steal control of the office away from you. Keeping it will require countering with your own influence. However, you can instead let another player control that office this round and add their influence to your own, giving you a leg up on controlling things later on.<br/><br/>In using these offices, players will buy land and build properties to create attractive neighborhoods that will bring the most people into the city &ndash; or they might place a factory next to an opponent's housing complex to drive people out. They will also tax their constituents to raise funds (with the option of sacrificing popularity to tax at higher rates), buy and sell influence to the Lobbyist, and campaign to increase their approval level.<br/><br/>At the end of the game, the citizens of the city will vote based on which player brought them in and that player's approval level. Special interest groups will also collect votes for players based on certain goals, such as Wall Street backing the player with the most money. Whichever player has the most votes on election day will become Mayor of New York and appoint his or her opponents to the Sanitation Department.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": ["English first edition"], "average": "6.6811", "name": "City Hall", "playingtime": "90", "boardgamemechanic": ["Auction/Bidding", "Tile Placement"], "age": "13", "usersrated": "264", "boardgamesubdomain": ["Strategy Games"], "boardgamefamily": ["Crowdfunding: Kickstarter"], "boardgamepodcastepisode": ["Episode 21 - Looking at the Designs of Antoine Bauza", "Episode 93- Clank! and The Dark Side of Gaming: Obsession", "Funding the Dream on Kickstarter Ep 101 Michael Keller City Hall", "Heavy Cardboard Episode 9 \u2013 Vinhos", "The Long View: Terra Mystica", "What Did You Play This Week Conversation Thing with Grant Rodiek ep 82.03", "What Did You Play This Week Podcast Thing Week 82"]}, "123845": {"poll": [], "name": "Victoria II: A House Divided", "videogamemode": ["Network Multiplayer", "Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["Windows Download edition"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2615586.jpg", "videogameseries": ["Victoria"], "videogametheme": ["Government / Politics", "Historical", "Military", "War - American Civil War"], "usersrated": "5", "videogameexpansion": ["Victoria II"], "videogamedeveloper": ["Paradox Interactive (I)"], "videogamegenre": ["4x Strategy", "Real Time Strategy", "Strategy"], "videogameplatform": ["Windows"], "average": "8.4", "statistics": [], "videogamepublisher": ["Paradox Interactive (I)"], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2615586_t.jpg", "description": "The first expansion to Victoria 2 focuses on American Civil War era and enhances the political and economical aspects of the game.<br/><br/>Carefully guide your nation from the era of absolute monarchies in the early 19th century, through expansion and colonization, to finally become a truly great power by the dawn of the 20th century.<br/><br/>Features<br/><br/><br/>     New starting point in 1861, allowing players to experience the US Civil War from the start<br/>     Manufacture reasons to go to war with other countries, all in the name of the great game of power<br/>     Civilize your country with various new reform paths to ultimately become equal with the western nations<br/>     Invest in building infrastructure and factories in other countries to strengthen their ties to you<br/>     Deeper political system with new national focus options and new types of reforms<br/>     A new system of popular movements that can be appeased or suppressed, but if ignored, will become the revolutionaries of tomorrow<br/><br/><br/>Source: The Publisher Website.<br/><br/>"}, "123846": {"poll": [], "name": "Prism Connect", "playingtime": "20", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": ["Hand Management"], "yearpublished": "2011", "usersrated": "3", "boardgamefamily": ["Anime & Manga", "CCGs (Collectible Card Games)"], "maxplayers": "2", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1615609_t.jpg", "average": "5.66667", "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["Ensky", "Movic"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1615609.jpg", "boardgameversion": ["First \"Durarara!!\" set edition", "First \"Hidan no Aria\" set edition"], "maxplaytime": "20", "boardgamecategory": ["Card Game", "Collectible Components", "Fighting"], "age": "0", "minplaytime": "20", "description": "Japanese collectible card game.<br/>The card game images are captured from Japanese animation (anime).<br/><br/>Deck construction of the game has exactly 40 cards in a deck and can contain only 3 duplicated copies.<br/><br/>The game has 3 card types: Character cards, Event cards and Scene cards.

You take on the role of a young captain who has just been given command of his first ship. The game's missions revolve around the the tangled web of political intrigue surrounding Napoleon's plan to invade England.<br/><br/>The game play focuses on navigation, 1 on 1 sea battles, and assaults by landing parties. The dramatic chases of naval literature are reproduced using an abstract system that represents the relative speed and position of each ship. Each turn the ship that has the highest maneuverability is considered to have the &quot;wind gauge&quot; and gets to move (closer or farther away) and/or attack. The captains navigational and crew assignments choices define his ships maneuverability each turn.<br/><br/>The primary game play mechanic revolves around the orders you give to your crew. You assign crew to different positions on the ship in anticipation of where you think the wind or the enemy will be. The game is divided into two segments. A &quot;Mission&quot; segment where you navigate on a large map attempting to reach objectives on time and a &quot;Chase&quot; segment where ships engage each other.<br/><br/>The goal of the system is to simplify naval combat to focus on dramatic storytelling rather than focusing on charts, modifiers,  counters, and complex rules. All conflict resolution is handled by drawing colored cubes from a cup.  This will tell if a test was successful and in combat it also tells what part of the ship is damaged. As a solitaire game the goal is to achieve enough mission objectives to earn renown in order to increase your rank and upgrade your crew.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "1", "boardgameversion": ["First Edition"], "age": "0", "name": "Post Captain", "playingtime": "45", "boardgamemechanic": ["Storytelling", "Worker Placement"], "average": "6.25", "usersrated": "4", "boardgamefamily": ["Solitaire Print and Play Contest"]}, "123876": {"boardgamedesigner": ["Colin Singleton"], "poll": [], "name": "Freeze", "playingtime": "0", "minplayers": "2", "yearpublished": "1975", "usersrated": "1", "maxplayers": "2", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1296742_t.jpg", "average": "5", "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["Games and Puzzles (magazine)"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1296742.jpg", "boardgameversion": ["Games & Puzzles First Edition"], "maxplaytime": "0", "boardgamecategory": ["Abstract Strategy"], "age": "0", "minplaytime": "0", "description": "Once again the checker board provides the basis for a game, only this time the size grid required is 10x10.<br/><br/>In 'Freeze' the movement of each playing piece is dependent upon its position on the board in relation to the other pieces. The object of the game is to prevent one's opponent from moving any of his pieces.<br/><br/>Each of the players has ten cube-shaped pieces, the two sets being of contrasting colours. During the game, a piece can be in one of three states: free, polarised or frozen. Thus the faces of the cubes are marked, so that the one facing upper most indicates its current state. These marks are:<br/>Plain face &mdash; free<br/>A line (either diagonally or orthogonally) &mdash; polarised<br/>A large central dot &mdash; frozen.<br/><br/>A cube moves according to the state that it is in, as follows:<br/>Free &mdash; any distance in any direction (as the Queen in chess)<br/>Polarised &mdash; any distance along the line of polarisation<br/>Frozen &mdash; no movement<br/><br/>To start the game, the pieces are set up in opposite corners, with the three corner pieces being in a free state and the remainder diagonally polarised towards the opponent's corner. Players choose who is to start and then move one of their pieces alternately. No piece may move over or onto any occupied square.<br/><br/>The state of pieces change as follows:<br/>If two free, opposing pieces come into line, diagonally or orthogonally, without any other piece between them, then both become polarised and are turned to show a polarised face with the line in the correct direction.<br/>If a piece becomes polarised along two different lines, it becomes frozen and is unable either to move or to polarise or freeze opposing pieces.<br/><br/>The action of freezing a piece may well release one or more pieces that were under its influence before it was frozen. When a polarised or frozen piece becomes separated from a piece which was polarising it, by the intervention of another piece, it is no longer under the influence of that piece and may move up to the next advantageous state; thus a frozen cube becomes polarised and a polarised one is freed. Any piece may change its state by the movement of any other piece on the board, whether friendly or enemy. Each such move can easily set off a chain reaction. It is the responsibility of each player to point out those opposing pieces which have become polarised or frozen as the result of a move. He should also note when his own pieces are freed.<br/><br/>The winner is the player who first freezes all of his opponents pieces.<br/><br/>"}, "123877": {"rpgdesigner": ["Creighton Broadhurst", "Tim Connors", "Adam Daigle", "Robert N.

Each track or run is in two parts, the Base along the edge of the board, and the Approach. Each pair of Base and Approach runs would be of a different colour, but are lettered in the diagram for the purpose of identification. Each player would have a cube, of the same colour as his track. This cube is marked from 1-6 in a similar fashion to a dice, but with ants replacing the usual spots. A collection of ants' eggs with a container and a normal die complete the equipment. The eggs are quite simple to make from papier mache, plaster or a similar substance and painted white.<br/><br/>At the start of the game, the eggs are placed in the container, which in turn is placed in the Queen Ant's Nest in the middle of the board. The cubes are situated in their respective bases with the side showing the six ants uppermost. The die is thrown in turn, and the cubes moved the appropriate number of squares in the direction indicated, along the Base run and then up the Approach run.<br/><br/>The first player to reach his X on the Ant Nest surround, stops on that square and becomes the Defender of the Queen Ant's Nest. All other ants to reach their X's during that turn become Attackers, and attack the Defender. These attacks are resolved as follows: both players throw the die and the highest score wins, a draw counting as a win for the Defender. When the Defender wins, he remains where he is, and the Attacker returns to that square on his Approach run, having the same number as that thrown by the Defender. If the Attacker wins, he becomes the Defender, while the ousted Defender goes back to the square on his Base run having the same number as that thrown by the Attacker. Should a Defender be beaten by a throw of 6, he is returned to his Base and loses one ant from his group, and so recommences with the new ant group showing face up on the cube. A player with only one ant is knocked out of the game when beaten by an Attacker's throw of 6. On his turn, a Defender must attempt to circumnavigate the Nest, in accordance with throws of the die, and defend himself each time he lands on an opponent's X square containing a cube. When he returns to his own X, he stops (regardless of the throw) and is entitled to collect eggs as follows:<br/><br/>Size of    <br/>Ant Group<br/>6-5 = 3 eggs<br/>4-3 = 2 eggs<br/>2-1 = 1 egg<br/><br/>Play continues until all the eggs have been removed from the nest. The initial number of eggs is optional, but an ideal number is 30. The winner is the player having most eggs at the end of the game.<br/><br/>Although it may sound complicated, 'Antheap' is in fact very simple to play. It is well worth going to the trouble of making the board and the cubes, for it will certainly provide the younger members of the family with hours of fun.<br/><br/>"}, "123880": {"boardgamedesigner": ["J\u00e9r\u00e9mie Caplanne", "Alain Epron"], "average": "1", "poll": [], "name": "Caribbean Sea", "playingtime": "45", "minplayers": "3", "boardgamemechanic": ["Dice Rolling"], "yearpublished": "0", "usersrated": "2", "maxplayers": "5", "boardgameartist": ["C\u00e9drick Le Bihan"], "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["(Unpublished)"], "boardgameversion": ["First edition"], "maxplaytime": "45", "boardgamecategory": ["Pirates"], "age": "8", "minplaytime": "45", "description": "Grab the bigger boats, sail on and pick the biggest treasures.

The cards show the offensive plays; Fullback thru line, Halfback Off Tackle, Halfback Around end, Long Pass, Jump pass, Flat Pass etc. The Offensive player selects his play call while the defensive player puts the cards in order depending on which play he thinks the Offensive player will call. The order that the cards are placed in determines how successful the offensive play is. If the defense matches the offense then the defense has guessed the right play and the gain will be minimal. If the offensive play was Halfback around end and the defensive player had that card 4th in order the gain might be 7 yards.

Impish as they are, they're really organized when it comes to forming groups for games. Recruit your team carefully, but not too slowly!<br/><br/>Pick-a-Dog (first published as Formissimo) features the same gameplay as Pick-a-Pig, with the only difference being that dog noses in one game are replaced with piggie snouts in the other. An individual game supports 2-5 players, while combined they support up to eight players.<br/><br/>To set up the game, lay out 30 cards in a grid (49 cards with 6-8 players) and give one card face down to each player. Each card has five attributes, with each attribute having two states: large/small, light/dark, one/two arms, with/without sunglasses, and with/without popcorn. (As noted above, combining the two games adds a sixth attribute: pig/dog nose.) Someone shouts &quot;Go!&quot;, then everyone looks at their card in hand. Players then start grabbing cards from the grid and stacking them in hand. The card grabbed must be identical to the top card in hand or differ from that top card in only one way. Thus, as you grab cards, the attributes of that top card will keep changing, forcing you to look for matches in new ways.<br/><br/>Once a player thinks he can't grab any more cards, he yells &quot;Stop!&quot;. The round ends, and all players check their card stacks. If someone made a mistake when grabbing cards, that player keeps none of the cards gathered that round. If the player who stopped the round made no mistakes, he earns an extra card (two cards when playing with 6-8). If, however, he stopped the round when he could have collected more cards, then he loses all the cards he's collected during this round.<br/><br/>Whoever has collected the most cards when the game ends wins!<br/><br/>Components<br/>96 cards (3 sets of 32 different cards)<br/>1 rules sheet<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "1", "boardgameversion": ["Czech/Slovak edition", "Czech/Slovak edition", "Dutch/French edition 2015", "Dutch/French edition 2015", "English third edition", "English third edition", "English/Chinese second edition", "English/Chinese second edition", "French edition 2014", "French edition 2014", "French third edition", "French third edition", "German edition 2013", "German first edition", "Korean edition", "Korean edition", "Korean edition, 2nd printing", "Korean edition, 2nd printing", "Polish edition 2014", "Polish edition 2014", "Simplified Chinese first edition", "Simplified Chinese first edition", "Spanish edition 2014", "Spanish edition 2014"], "average": "6.22115", "name": "Pick-a-Dog", "playingtime": "15", "boardgamemechanic": ["Pattern Recognition"], "age": "8", "boardgameexpansion": ["167989"], "usersrated": "885", "boardgamesubdomain": ["Family Games", "Party Games"], "boardgamefamily": ["Animal Rascals", "Animals: Dogs", "Animals: Pigs"], "boardgamepodcastepisode": ["DJ44: Pick-a-PIG (2012) Torsten Landsvogt", "[Reviews] N\u00b045-B NetRunner, Targui et les jeux narratifs \u00e0 l\u2019honneur"]}, "123886": {"rpgartist": ["Lee Barber", "Edmund Dulac", "Daxiong Guo", "Dylan Hartwell", "Katsushika Hokusai", "Utagawa Kuniyoshi", "Dennis Laffey", "Maruyama Okyo", "Yoshitoshi"], "rpg": ["Flying Swordsmen"], "statistics": [], "name": "Flying Swordsmen", "rpgdesigner": ["Dennis Laffey"], "rpgproducer": ["David Brawley", "Matt Stater"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1294833.jpg", "usersrated": "2", "rpgitemversion": ["Free PDF Version"], "average": "6.5", "rpggenre": ["Fantasy", "Martial Arts"], "rpgpublisher": ["(Web published)"], "rpgcategory": ["Core Rules (min needed to play)"], "poll": [], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1294833_t.jpg", "description": "Publisher Blurb:<br/>Welcome to the home of the Flying Swordsmen Role Playing Game.

One of these is used for disposing the player's own navy (the 'home' chart), the other for recording salvos on his opponent's chart (the 'away' chart). In addition to these, at the foot of each chart there should be a diagram similar to that shown in Fig. 1 for the purpose of recording hits. This fulfills the dual aim of showing at a glance the combinations of salvo numbers required for locating ships and the amount of fire-power left to each player at any time. Both players should locate themselves in such a way that their charts cannot be seen by the opponent.<br/><br/>Each fleet is composed of thirteen ships. The following table shows the names, sizes and fire-power of each vessel<br/>1 Flagship (FS) . . .8 squares. . .3 guns (3-3-2)<br/>1 Battleship (BS) . . .7 squares . . .3 guns (3-2-2)<br/>2 Heavy Cruisers (HC) . . .6 squares . . .2 guns each (3-3)<br/>2 Light Cruisers (LC) . . .5 squares . . .2 guns each (3-2)<br/>3 Destroyers (Dy) .. .4 squares . . .2 guns each (2-2)<br/>4 Corvettes (Cv) . . .3 squares . . .1 gun each<br/>The figures in parentheses above indicate the way in which guns are destroyed by successful bombardment. For instance, the flagship's first gun is knocked out of action after any three of its squares have been hit, the second gun after any six squares have been hit, and the third when it has been totally sunk. It will be seen that initially each player has a salvo of 24 shots.<br/><br/>In addition to his fleet, each player is provided with twelve mines. Four of these are high-explosive type, the rest ordinary, and their functions are explained later.<br/><br/>Ships may run vertically, horizontally or diagonally, but must of course be in a straight line. No ship or mine can be contiguous either laterally or diagonally with any other ship or mine &mdash; there must always be at least one separating square in each case.<br/><br/>When both players have placed all their ships and mines, a coin is tossed to decide who starts. The winner of the toss then proceeds to enumerate the 24 shots of his first salvo. As he calls out the squares both he and his opponent mark the appropriate charts &mdash; i.e. his 'away' and the opponent's 'home' respectively - putting a figure &lsquo;1&rsquo; in each square as it is called. It is advisable, in order to avoid mistakes, for the opponent to repeat the squares after each one is called or at the end of the salvo.<br/><br/>The salvo having been completed and marked, the opponent then indicates what damage, if any, has been sustained. The information that he gives is restricted to the type of ships hit and the number of squares in each case &mdash; not the location. For instance, he might say: Two hits on the flagship, one on a destroyer and one on a corvette'. The only time that any further identification is given is when two or more ships of the same type have already sustained damage, as described later. It then becomes the turn of the second player to fire off his salvo, and the same procedure is observed, both players marking the squares called with the figure '1' again, but this time in the other charts. Naturally, before the second player starts his turn both will have checked to see whether he is still entitled to the full original twenty-four shots or whether any of his fire-power has been reduced. Play continues in this way, the next set of salvos from each player being record&not;ed with the figure '2', and so on.<br/><br/>When a hit or hits are registered on one of two or more ships of the same type which have already suffered damage, the ship must be differentiated by salvo numbers. For example, player A has hit both of player B's Light Cruisers, one with salvo 2 and the other with salvos 3 and 4; if on salvo 5 he again hits one of these two ships, player B must say whether it is the '2' ship of the '3-4' ship. One way of arranging this differentiation neatly is to assign names or letters to those ships which have more than one in their class, e.g. Destroyers A, B and C, Heavy Cruisers A and B, etc.<br/><br/>The only square to be identified immediately is one containing a mine. When a player's shot lands on one of these his salvo comes to an abrupt end and he loses the rest of his shots in that salvo. In the case of a high-explosive mine he not only loses the remainder of the current salvo but the whole of the next one as well.<br/><br/>Fig. 1 shows a typical layout at the start of a game, while Fig. 2 shows the same chart but with all the &quot;used&quot; squares filled in &mdash; i.e. the squares actually occupied by vessels and mines plus all the surrounding squares which are unusable through the application of the ship placement rules. This is done to illustrate the importance of correct location of opponents' destroyed ships; note that although the occupied squares number only 73, there is a total of 323 'used' squares plus a further 8 in which no ship could possibly be, (designated in the diagram with an 'x').<br/><br/>It is noticeable when playing with beginners that they tend to pepper an identified target area instead of limiting the follow-up shots to a few well-placed attempts. This blitzkrieg approach may well knock out a gun somewhat more quickly than the more patient player, but it has two distinct drawbacks: (a) it will waste most of the salvo doing so instead of exploring other areas and (b) more seriously, the player will probably end up not knowing where the destroyed ship is and consequently not knowing which of his opponent's squares are unusable, which, especially towards the end of the game, can be a strong disadvantage when salvos are small and every wasted shot a severe liability.<br/><br/>"}, "123927": {"rpgartist": ["(Uncredited)"], "rpgitemversion": ["PDF version"], "rpgseries": ["Living Forgotten Realms", "SPEC - Living Forgotten Realms Core Special Adventures"], "name": "The Writhing Obelisk", "rpgdesigner": ["Larry DeLucas"], "rpgproducer": ["Dan Anderson", "M.

Roberts Best Post-WW2 Era Board Wargame Nominee", "2013 Golden Geek Best Wargame Nominee"], "description": "Thunderbolt-Apache Leader puts you in the cockpits of the world&rsquo;s best Close Air Support aircraft. In Thunderbolt-Apache Leader, you&rsquo;ll zoom through canyons hunting enemy tanks and troops while dodging their AAA fire and SAMs.<br/><br/>Stuffing all this heavy metal in one box has allowed us to expand the normal Leader component set! This game comes with 168 cards and 5 counter sheets!<br/><br/>Thunderbolt-Apache Leader puts you down in the weeds in 8 campaigns spanning the globe. The game system creates immense replayability by pairing a Tactical Situation card with the Campaign card to create a unique environment for the campaign. This means that your campaign in North Korea might be part of a Holding Action, Show of Force, Rapid Deployment, or General War.<br/><br/>The game places you in command of the pilots and aircraft of a squadron of U.S. Close Air Support (CAS) aircraft in hostile campaigns around the world. The aircraft and weapons available for each campaign are historically accurate.<br/><br/>A major part of the game is mission planning. You decide how to arm your aircraft and which pilots are best for the mission. Pilots are rated for skill level. Deciding which pilots to fly each mission is a major consideration. Your pilots will become fatigued with every mission. If you fly a pilot too often, his skills will degrade. Your pilots also gain experience with every mission flown. This makes for some great decision-making. Should you keep flying the top pilots and further fatigue them to get the job done, or fly the new guys to prep them for the tough missions ahead?<br/><br/>Missions are quickly resolved using an area movement system to display tactical combat over the target. Speed and realism take top priority in this game. Terrain cards randomly generate each battlefield. The cards include mountain ranges that block lines of sight from both you and the enemy forces. If you plan it right, you get to fly nap of the earth through the canyons and come screaming over the ridge-line to rain fire down on the enemy before they can react. Beware! During each battle enemy air defenses will pop-up on the map to ruin your day, so watch were you&rsquo;re flying!<br/><br/>You get to resolve every missile launched at enemy bandits, and every air to ground attack against the enemy targets. Each enemy tank, S.P. Artillery, APC, Infantry, etc is represented by its own counter on the battlefield. You also get to resolve the enemy SAM, AAA, and Bandit attacks against your aircraft.<br/><br/>While performing each mission, you get to decide how your pilots engage the enemy Bandits, SAMs, and AAA Sites. This makes for some tough choices. Do you hit the high value targets first, or take out the enemy SAM and AAA assets?<br/><br/>Thunderbolt-Apache Leader aircraft are usually able to survive more than one attack. These aircraft are rugged and made to soak-up damage. This also factors into your decision-making. How long should you loiter over the target blowing-up enemy tanks before heading for home? If your aircraft is too shot-up, it won&rsquo;t be able to fly the next day.<br/><br/>Thunderbolt-Apache Leader features an operation combat sheet that tracks the progress of enemy formations attempting to overrun your sector. You get to select the formation you want to engage each day and assign the air assets you think are best suited to the task.<br/><br/>If you&rsquo;ve played Hornet Leader or Phantom Leader, you&rsquo;ll make an easy transition into Thunderbolt-Apache Leader.<br/><br/>We&rsquo;ve included the cards for every pilot to progress in experience from Newbie, to Green, Average, Skilled, Veteran, and Ace!<br/><br/>Thunderbolt-Apache Leader includes the following aircraft:<br/>A-10A Thunderbolt II<br/>A-10C Thunderbolt II<br/>AH-64A Apache<br/>AH-64D Apache Longbow<br/>AV-8B Harrier II<br/>AH-1 Cobra<br/>RQ-1 Predator UAV<br/>MQ-1 Predator UAV<br/>AC-130 Spectre<br/><br/>Scheduled Campaigns:<br/>Iraq 1991<br/>Pakistan 2013<br/>Libya 1984<br/>Iran 2014<br/>Taiwan Defense 2008<br/>North Korea 2011<br/>Israel Defense 2001<br/>North Atlantic WWIII 1986<br/><br/>Thunderbolt-Apache Leader includes the following weapons: Mk.82 Iron Bomb, Mk.83 Iron Bomb, AGM-65 Maverick, AIM-92 Stinger, LAU-68, LAU-61, ECM Pod, AGM-114 Hellfire, AIM-9 Sidewinder, Mk.20 Rockeye<br/><br/>Target Audience: <br/>This game is perfect for both expert level military gamers as well as first time gamers. The core rules are easy to grasp and very intuitive, while still giving players a wide variety of decision-making options and tactical choices.<br/><br/>The game can also be played co-op (like our other Leader games) by splitting-up the aircraft and planning/resolving missions as a team.<br/><br/>Each mission requires only in 30 to 60 minutes.<br/><br/>Each campaign consists of 2 to 6 turns in which you&rsquo;ll fly one or more missions each day.<br/><br/><br/>Re-implements:<br/><br/>    Thunderbolt/Apache Leader<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>", "minplayers": "1", "boardgameversion": ["English first edition"], "maxplaytime": "90", "average": "8.17151", "name": "Thunderbolt Apache Leader", "playingtime": "90", "boardgamemechanic": ["Area Movement", "Hand Management", "Simulation"], "age": "12", "usersrated": "785", "boardgameaccessory": ["Thunderbolt-Apache Leader Miniatures Set"], "boardgamesubdomain": ["Wargames"], "boardgamefamily": ["Leader Series", "Solitaire Games", "Solitaire Wargames"], "boardgamepodcastepisode": ["1P 098 - Thunderbolt Apache Leader", "OBG 86: We're All His Vassals"]}, "123956": {"poll": [], "name": "Neves", "videogamemode": ["Local Multiplayer", "Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["English/European Nintendo DS edition", "Japanese Nintendo DS edition", "North American Nintendo DS edition"], "average": "0", "videogametheme": ["Puzzle"], "usersrated": "0", "videogamedeveloper": ["Yuke's"], "videogamegenre": ["Puzzle"], "videogameplatform": ["Nintendo DS"], "statistics": [], "videogamepublisher": ["Atlus Co.
