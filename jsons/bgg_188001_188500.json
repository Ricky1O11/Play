Kusukuma is the result of a student game development class (main game idea by Charel Bintz) under the guidance of Dennis Kirps (teacher) and the help of Christian Kruchten (prototype development). The class itself was originated by professor Carmen Schares.<br/><br/>The objective of the game is to push the opponent off the board by cleverly pushing the Kusukuma discs, so that the final player keeps at least one Kusukuma disc of his own on the board. However, as the die determines the colour of the next move, a player might have to push his own disc(s) off the board. The question arises: &ldquo;Who will be left?&rdquo;<br/><br/>PLAY<br/>The active player throws the die and chooses exactly one of the following three moves:<br/><br/>1.    If one of the four colours is cast, the player has to move one of the discs corresponding to the cast colour by exactly one square horizontally or vertically (not diagonally), even if said colour does not correspond to his own! <br/>2.    If the joker is cast, the player can push any disc, his own, his opponent&rsquo;s or even the joker.<br/>3.    If the blank side is cast, the player cannot make a move, and it is the next player&rsquo;s turn.<br/><br/>END OF GAME AND WINNER<br/>The game is over when:<br/><br/>     there is only one disc or discs of the same colour left on the game-board.

Loading on to naval transports, they debarked at Tarifa and moved to engage the siege lines from the rear. The French, under the command of Marshal Victor, placed one division on the road to Cadiz, while his two remaining divisions fell on the single Anglo-Portuguese division under Sir Thomas Graham. Following a fierce battle, the British succeeded in routing the French but could not prevent their reoccupying their siege lines.<br/><br/>Fuentes de Onoro, 3 - 5 May 1811<br/>Wellington first secured Portugal and then set about re-taking the fortified frontier cities of Almeida, Badajoz, and Ciudad Rodrigo. Whilst Wellington besieged Almeida, Massena reformed his battered army and marched to relieve the French garrison in the city. Wellington chose to check the relief attempt at the small village of Fuentes de O&ntilde;oro.<br/><br/>La Albuera 16 May 1811<br/>Wellesley sent Sir William Beresford to retake the border town of Badajoz. Soult rapidly gathered a new army from Andalusia and, joining with the troops retreating before Beresford, he marched to relieve the siege. With the Spanish army under General Joaquin Blake approaching, he planned  to turn Beresford's flank and interpose his army between his position and the Spaniards. However, the Spaniards had already linked up with the Anglo-Portuguese corps, and his 24,000 troops now faced a combined Allied army 35,000 strong. The opposing armies met at the village of Albuera. Both sides suffered heavily in the ensuing struggle and the French eventually withdrew on 18 May.<br/><br/>DESCRIPTION<br/><br/>The Library of Napoleonic Battles - formerly known as the Napoleon's Last Battles (NLB) Series:<br/><br/><br/>     480 meters per hex, <br/>     1 hour per turn, <br/>     400-800 men per strength point. <br/><br/><br/>Each Approach to Battle game lasts about 22 turns.

To win the game, sink all enemy ships, or be the first to earn 7 gold. But watch out for the volcano. If your opponent&rsquo;s prayers to the volcano gods are successful, lava could engulf your fleet.<br/><br/>Volcano Cove is a beautiful 2-player game that packs a large punch. Games last 10-15 minutes while providing drama and strategic decisions around every turn. Since there are multiple paths to victory, you&rsquo;ll need to watch your opponent carefully and look for weaknesses you can exploit.<br/><br/>Both players share a zero-sum Gold Track. When you earn 1 gold your opponent loses 1 gold, and vice versa. This means when you buy extra ships or movement, you are giving your opponent gold in exchange for the advantage. You earn gold by sinking enemy ships, occupying gold mine spaces, having 3 Battle Coins at the end of your turn, and by praying to the volcano gods and successfully causing an eruption.<br/><br/>You start your turn by building your fleet, sailing, and declaring any battles you&rsquo;d like. When fighting, your Battle Strength is equal to the number of coins that make up your ship (ships can be built up to 3 coins high) plus any Battle Coins you commit. Three Battle Coins float between both players throughout the game. If you commit a Battle Coin to a battle, you have a higher Battle Strength for the current battle, but you must pass any committed Battle Coins to your opponent.<br/><br/>After the Battle Phase, your opponent decides if he or she wants to pray to the volcano gods. If your opponent prays, he or she shakes 3 Prayer Coins. The number of heads shaken moves the Volcano Track marker, which can cause an eruption. Ships within the Lava Danger Zone when the volcano erupts take damage depending on the severity of the eruption. After the Pray Phase, you end you turn by earning gold from any gold mine spaces you still occupy. Then play passes to the next player.<br/><br/>To create your free print-and-play copy of Volcano Cove, print the board and rules at VolcanoCove.com and find 10 pennies, 10 nickels, 5 dimes, and 3 quarters.

You can only position something you already have in your possession or grabbed earlier in the game.<br/>  Use: Activating something, whether or not it is the item's primary intention.

They do this by placing a new tile, consisting of one volcano and two other types of landscape. A tile must always touch at least one other tile, when placed at sea level, or be placed on top of at least two other tiles (without any gaps under the land being created), with the volcano being placed on top of an existing volcano.<br/>Next, the player will place one or more wooden buildings; huts, temples or towers. Settlements must always start at the lowest level, by placing a single hut. From there on, existing settlements may expand by placing huts on all hexes of a single type of terrain around the settlement, with temples once the settlement takes up at least three hexes, or with towers, placed at level three or above.<br/><br/>The game ends when all tiles have been placed. At that point, the player who's placed most temples wins. Ties are broken by towers, then huts. Ultimate victory - and an immediate end to the game - waits for the player who manages to place all their buildings of two types. Immediate defeat is also possible, when no buildings can legally be played during a player's turn.<br/><br/>A lot of strategy results from the various placement rules. Volcanoes may never fully destroy a settlement, so single huts can block volcano placement, protecting other settlements. Alternatively, a well placed volcano can split a large settlement in two, creating the opportunity for both to expand more rapidly than a new settlement would. Limiting your opponent's growth potential is at least as important as preparing the terrain for you to expand upon...<br/><br/>The Deluxe edition contains the basic Taluva game at increased size, as well as the following new expansions:<br/><br/>     Ship expansion: A new wooden piece, which can be placed in lagoons, adjacent to settlements<br/>     2-Hex tiles expansion<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": {"291391": "First edition"}, "average": "8.02239", "name": "Taluva Deluxe", "playingtime": "45", "boardgamemechanic": {"2011": "Modular Board"}, "age": "8", "boardgameexpansion": {}, "usersrated": "163", "boardgameaccessory": {"188082": "Taluva: First Player Spinner"}, "boardgamefamily": {"5607": "3D Games"}}, "188077": {"poll": {}, "name": "Da Scramble Pidign Crossword Game", "playingtime": "0", "minplayers": "1", "boardgamemechanic": {"2002": "Tile Placement"}, "yearpublished": "0", "usersrated": "0", "boardgamefamily": {"4711": "Scrabble"}, "maxplayers": "4", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2787756_t.jpg", "average": "0", "statistics": {}, "boardgamepublisher": {"4": {"name": "(Self-Published)"}}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2787756.jpg", "boardgameversion": {"291394": "First Edition"}, "maxplaytime": "0", "boardgamecategory": {"1025": {"name": "Word Game"}}, "age": "8", "minplaytime": "0", "description": "Da Scramble Pidgin Crossword Game is a tile-laying word game using the Pidgin language, particularly as spoken in Hawaii. A pile of letter tiles is placed face-down on the table. Each player in turn rolls two six-sided dice, takes that many letters from the pile, and tries to make a Pidgin word or phrase from them. All drawn tiles are kept face-up. If unable to place a word, the player passes his or her turn to the next player who rolls, collects letters and tries to lay down a word. Once a word is laid down, all words must connect in crossword fashion similar to Scrabble. Although tiles may not be moved once played, players may steal tiles from other players to complete words or phrases (but be careful! This can help them). The game ends when all letters have been drawn and either one player plays his or her last letter or no more words can be made by any player. The player with the fewest tiles left wins.

Fantasy: Legends of Steel is an update to the BASH!

Erisa was inspired by the comic book and cartoon Sword &amp; Sorcery fiction of the 70s and 80s, where Heroes could adventure in a world reminiscent of such comics.<br/><br/>Erisa is a world where decadent empires struggle to hold their frontiers against barbarian hordes, where demon-worshiping priests practice their dark arts in primeval forests, and where sell-swords, bravos and mercenaries of every stripe carouse away their fortunes in the crowded taverns and hazy lotus dens of vice-ridden port cities. There are fortunes to be won and lost, epic battles to fight, despots to usurp, and ancient evils to destroy. So grab your sword and a fast horse, there is adventure to be had!<br/><br/>Erisa is the &ldquo;official&rdquo; campaign world of the Legends of Steel Sword &amp; Sorcery setting, but you can also use the resources in this book to create a Sword &amp; Sorcery world of your very own. You can also use the BASH! Fantasy: Legends of Steel rules engine to drive a more high fantasy style campaign if you wish. Additional support products coming soon will aid you in this.<br/><br/>THE RULES<br/><br/>BASH! Fantasy: Legends of Steel uses the BASH! Engine also used by BASH! Ultimate Edition, and all the other BASH! family of products. The core mechanic is roll 2d6, multiply by the Stat, Skill, or Power being used, higher number wins (ties go to the Hero).

It was fought between Polish army commanded by general Jan Skrzynecki and Russian army commanded by field marshal Ivan Diebitsch. The battle was the final part of the operation of Polish army against Russian Imperial Guard. The meeting near Ostro\u0142\u0119ka was a bit suprising for both sides, especially for Poles who didn&rsquo;t expect such quick appearance of Russian forces near their positions. Polish army was divided into two parts. The first part was situated on the eastern bank of the river Narew. The second, larger part was put on the western bank of the river. In Ostro\u0142\u0119ka there were two bridges connecting both banks of the river (one of them was pontoon bridge).<br/><br/>The first part of the battle was fought on the eastern bank of Narew. Polish forces tried to slow down an assault of Russians and withdraw to the western bank. Unfortunately, in consequence of earlier orders, one of Polish infantry brigades commanded by general Bogus\u0142awski was stayed to defend town Ostro\u0142\u0119ka (situated on the eastern bank of the river), and there attacked by overwhelming Russians and partially routed, partially destroyed. Russians took control over Ostro\u0142\u0119ka at noon. Then some Russian grenadier battalions decided to cross the river through the bridges to create a bridgehead for further operations. So started the second part of the battle. Polish main army began attacks to destroy Russian bridgehead and both brigdes to prevent main body of Russian army to cross the river. There were few attacks. At first they were not properly coordinated. Russian small forces on the bridgehead was supported by powerful artillery situated on the eastern bank of the river which was higher than western bank and allowed crossing fire (Russians formed two great batteries, one to the north and one to the south of Ostro\u0142\u0119ka, and were shooting over own units on the western bank).<br/><br/>In the later afternoon Polish attacks became more coordinated. Russians tried to gain more terrain, but it moved them out of the range of their supporting artillery and encouraged Polish army to make last, most powerful attack, which was stopped near to the river. The battle ended a famous charge of Polish horse artillery battery commanded by lt. col. J. Bem, which caused great chaos in the Russian forces and discouraged Russians to make general cavalry attack on Polish army in the end of the battle as they were used to do in the Napoleonic Wars. When battle ended, both sides had similar casualties (about 6 000 killed, wounded etc.). The battle is considered Polish army defeat because it left the battlefield and during the night and the next day started retreat, not chased by Russians who first weren&rsquo;t sure they had won. The main effect of the battle for Poles was the fall of morale of soldiers and the upper command, which allowed Russians to take initiative in the later part of Polish-Russian War.<br/><br/>Ostro\u0142\u0119ka 26 maja 1831 contains three scenarios, with one made to introduce players to the system and two historical ones, showing both parts of the battlle. The game is quite complex, tending to show full spectrum of tactic of the Napoleonic and Post-Napoleonic period, but in reasonably easy way. Basic game mechanic is similar to Igo/Ugo movement, but with two phases of movement: for cavalry and infantry, and two combat phases: for cavalry and infantry. Horse artillery is generally attached to cavalry and foot artillery is attached to infantry. Additional rules offer another movement systems but rather designed for further battles based on this rules, not for that one. Rules offer many possible reaction activities for non-active player during opposite player phase. Another rules feature is an unique combat calculation system based on traditional odds ratio but originally modified. The rules focuse on simulating cooperation of three kinds of weapon (infantry, cavalry and artillery) on the battlefield and showing different formations (column, line, square, skirmish, buildings defense). The playing time varies depending on the scenario, from 2-3 hours to whole day. It also depends on the players &ndash; the longest scenario can be finished very quickly by autowin.<br/><br/>Components:<br/>- One mapsheet 96 x 68 cm <br/>- Nine sheets of die-cut counters (978 counters totally, most of them are markers)<br/>- One sheet of additional counters<br/>- One rulebook and scenariobook (both in one book)<br/>- Three dices (D6)<br/>- Six sheets with tables and player aids<br/>- One sheet with units tables (alternative way of marking units loses)<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": {"291454": "First Edition"}, "name": "Ostroleka 26 maja 1831", "playingtime": "600", "boardgamemechanic": {"2026": "Hex-and-Counter"}, "average": "8.77027", "usersrated": "37", "boardgamesubdomain": {"4664": "Wargames"}, "age": "16"}, "188125": {"rpgitemversion": {"291458": "PDF version"}, "statistics": {}, "name": "Sea of Man", "rpgproducer": {"76028": "Diana Kwolkoski Stoll"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2749769.jpg", "usersrated": "0", "average": "0", "rpggenre": {"257": "Action / Adventure (Nautical)"}, "rpg": {"24381": "Protocol Game Series"}, "rpgcategory": {"2083": "Core Rules (min needed to play)"}, "poll": {}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2749769_t.jpg", "description": "From publisher blurb:<br/><br/>Sea of Man is a story roleplaying game about whaling in the 18th century.

Your primary mission is to destroy the Luftwaffe to ensure a successful D-Day landing, but multiple secondary missions are also required to help advance the fronts in multiple theaters.<br/><br/>You will have multiple historic Bomber Groups composed of B-17 Flying Fortresses, B-24 Liberators, and B-26 Marauders.  Optional B-29 Superfortress and B-25 Mitchell Bomber Groups are included.  Your Bomber Groups will be protected on their journey in Luftwaffe controlled airspace by Fighter Groups composed of MK VII Spitfires, P-47 Thunderbolts, P-38 Lightnings, and P-51 Mustangs.   Your groups can progress in experience levels from Newbie to Ace, but may be Reassigned as they gain experience.  Optional Renown Commanders provide groups with special skills and tactics, but could be killed during the Campaign.<br/><br/>The campaigns included in B-17 Leader include:<br/>  &bull; The Air War Begins (Aug 1942 &ndash; Dec 1942)<br/>  &bull; Operation Pointblank (June 1943 &ndash; May 1944)<br/>  &bull; Combined Bomber Operations (June 1943 &ndash; Sept 1943)<br/>  &bull; Allied Invasion (June 1944 &ndash; May 1945)<br/>  &bull; Oil Campaign (Aug 1944 &ndash; Nov 1944)<br/>  &bull; Operation Argument &ndash; Big Week (Feb 20 &ndash; 25 1944)<br/>  &bull; Operation Crossbow (Mar 1943 &ndash; May 1943)<br/>  &bull; Transportation (Apr 1944 &ndash; Aug 1944)<br/>  &bull; Strategic Targets (Jun 1943 - Aug 1943)<br/>  &bull; U-Boat Focus (Aug 1942)<br/>  &bull; Aircraft Industry Focus (Aug 1943)<br/><br/>You will be targeting many different types of targets, including Airfields, Aircraft Factories, U-Boat Pens, Ball Bearing Factories, Oil Refineries, and V-Weapon sites.  Recon Aircraft can be sent to improve your aim point and allow you to pick the optimal path to reduce Flak damage.<br/><br/>Opposing you will be Luftwaffe Squadrons, generated from multiple Aircraft Factories, that will intercept your Escorts and Bombers to and from the targets.  Luftwaffe Squadron Bandits can be BF-109s, FW-190s, BF-110s, and/or ME-410s.  Targeting their Aircraft Factories will reduce the number of new Luftwaffe Squadrons deployed each month, but destroyed factories are quickly rebuilt, and new Aircraft Factories are periodically being added.  Attacking and destroying Airfields helps reduce the number of deployed Luftwaffe Squadrons.  Victory Points are earned for each destroyed Target.<br/><br/>Various German Defense Commanders will try different tactics and technologies in an effort to stop your campaign.  Each German commander will also have a varying range of Luftwaffe responses to your attack, from Poor to All Out.<br/><br/>To help mitigate the Luftwaffe threat, you can accomplish Secondary Mission objectives that can advance the Mediterranean and Russian fronts to force Germany to send more Luftwaffe Squadrons into those theaters.  You can also purchase various technologies to increase the odds of a successful mission, like Drop Tanks, Jammers, and H2X Radar sets.  An option to invest and field the P-80 Shooting Star jet fighter is included.    Once the Allied Invasion has begun, many Secondary Missions will help advance the Allies to Berlin to end the war.<br/><br/>Your Bombers will take damage and be destroyed, but monthly Replenishment units will help bring your groups up in strength.<br/><br/>If you have played other Leader Games, many aspects of B-17 Leader will be familiar.

Players are immersed in a dark world full of destruction and suffering, a world where people are fighting to take back their place after a global nuclear war annihilated all achievements of the human race and all that was left was only a handful of usable resources. The remaining scattered groups of survivors are fighting amongst themselves for dominance over the remnants of the past. Now it is your turn to join the global war and recruit soldiers, battle machines, powerful hybrids, or tremendous mutants into your army. Equip your troops with the best available technologies and show all your enemies who is the ruler of the new order.<br/><br/>Players are represented in the game by their hero and play units or one-time effects (tactics) in an attempt to destroy all cards from the opponent&rsquo;s deck. The number of cards in the deck and the player&rsquo;s hand is connected to the number of health points of the player's hero. For each point of damage that the hero receives, the player has to destroy one of their cards &ndash; from the top of their deck or from their hand. Once a player loses all cards from their deck and hand they lose the game. Because each card used by a player during the game costs them a life point, players are forced to play cards as efficiently as possible so that each played card does more damage to the enemy than to themselves.<br/><br/>These combined mechanics create a well-balanced system where every erroneous move or unplanned action can lead to a player&rsquo;s defeat. Each and every decision is tightly coupled, and even a small decision can completely change the course of the game.<br/><br/>Players have to find a balance between investing in game control, which allows them to play cards more effectively, or investing in killing the enemy hero, which is the primary goal.

Please only submit images if you own a copy or have legal access to this item.<br/><br/>    <br/><br/><br/> StarCraft: Ghost is a cancelled game previously under development by Blizzard Entertainment. Part of Blizzard's StarCraft series, the game was announced on September 20, 2002, and was to be developed by Nihilistic Software for the Nintendo GameCube, Xbox, and PlayStation 2 video game consoles. Several delays in development caused Blizzard to move back the release date and the game has not yet materialized. Nihilistic Software ceded development to Swingin' Ape Studios in 2004 before Blizzard bought the company, and plans for the GameCube version were cancelled in 2005.<br/><br/>Blizzard announced in March 2006 that the game was put on &quot;indefinite hold&quot; while the company investigated seventh generation video game console possibilities. The continued delay of Ghost had caused it to be labeled as vaporware, and it was ranked fifth in Wired News&zwj;\u200a'\u200b annual Vaporware Awards in 2005. In 2014, Blizzard president Mike Morhaime confirmed that Ghost was officially cancelled.<br/><br/>Unlike its real-time strategy predecessor StarCraft, Ghost is a third-person shooter, and was intended to give players a closer and more personal view of the StarCraft universe. Following Nova, a Terran psychic espionage operative called a &quot;ghost&quot;, the game is set four years after the conclusion of StarCraft: Brood War and covers a conspiracy about a secretive military project conducted by Nova's superiors in the imperial Terran Dominion. Very little of the game's storyline has been released; however, in November 2006 after the game's postponement, a novel was published called StarCraft Ghost: Nova, which covers the backstory of the central character.<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;StarCraft: Ghost&quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "188261": {"boardgamedesigner": {"43198": {"name": "Susanne Krinke"}}, "poll": {}, "name": "Pizzeria Allegro", "playingtime": "15", "minplayers": "1", "yearpublished": "2012", "usersrated": "1", "boardgamefamily": {"5841": "Food / Cooking"}, "maxplayers": "4", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2949663_t.jpg", "average": "7", "statistics": {}, "boardgamepublisher": {"384": {"name": "HABA - Habermaa\u00df GmbH"}}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2949663.jpg", "boardgameversion": {"291706": "Multilingual edition"}, "maxplaytime": "15", "boardgamecategory": {"1041": {"name": "Children's Game"}}, "age": "3", "minplaytime": "10", "description": "A tasty fun play set for 1-4 pizza bakers<br/><br/>This pizza bake sets contains two games. <br/>Pizza presto:<br/>A red hot pizza duel for two children, flip a card the first kid take puts the right toppings on the pizza and puts their pizza in the oven wins the card.

Each also lists detailed level advancement information for their first few levels, with further suggestions for developing the character's long-term mechanical build.

To gain absolute power over the unruly nations, the four gods used their might to create the Labyrinths: maze-like structures formed from bits of surrounding nature. To achieve this, they used a magical item called the Pendant of Labyronia, which was said to be of divine origin.<br/>After the people had spent a few years getting lost in the messed up new world, a bunch of monsters appeared. Without further ado, they started to wreck every place (no questions asked) including the capital of the world and the place where those gods were hanging out!<br/>Unfortunately the gods had a plan to counter these monsters, and of course they had to go and execute it.

The first leader of the Order, Zemocon, had pioneered gaining divine powers. According to old prophecies, one day four gods would reign equally, governing the four elements.<br/><br/>Something in Labyronia was however changing. It was first noticed by the Council of the highest ranking wizards. A strange malice was spreading in the world, and rumors of war emerged. The wizards felt powerless, deciding to hold a meeting to address the situation.<br/><br/>And so, the wizards gathered in the great Assembly Hall. Red robed mages of fire, blue robed mages of water, brown and green-garbed earth mages and air mages in purple cloaks stepped into the hall each one in their turn, to face the Head of the Council, Dinyon. Suddenly, something unforeseen happened.<br/><br/>An assassin shot an arrow, and it pierced Dinyon. &quot;I'm... bleeding&quot;, the great wizard muttered. Before the members of the Council were able to react, Dinyon suddenly vanished in a bright flash of light.<br/>The assassin attempted to flee, but one of the wizards struck him down with a fireball. It appeared that the offender was not a wizard, but a normal human. Someone had hired him and brought him into the tower.<br/>The red robed wizard grabbed the assassin, asking: &quot;Who hired you?!&quot; Drawing his last breath, the murderer whispered a name: Windir. Perplexed, the young air mage Windir tried to defend himself against this false accusation, but to no avail.<br/><br/>In the Assembly Hall, three of the most powerful wizards from each element were present at the time of the assassination.

The game uses an atypical dice method by rolling 1D12 and 2D6, with most results (except outright failure) being resolved with an action table.<br/><br/>Characters in the system have six Attributes:  Strength, Reflex, Vitality, Personality, Mentality, and Vanity.  Attributes typically range from +5 to -5.  Vanity is also referred to as the &quot;normalizer stat&quot; and has three sub-values; it generally is used when something else don't seem to fit.  Each Attribute covers a range of Skills, each Skill has a Points value.  Attribute values and Skill Points are used as modifiers on action resolution dice rolls.<br/><br/>Version 2.0 presents a slightly more intelligible overview of the game rules as well as cleaned-up action tables and far fewer typographical errors from Version 1.0.

Getting the B-25s close enough to launch is vital, as is the recovery of aircraft and crewmen, but above all, the player&rsquo;s main dilemma will be secrecy. The risk is great. Failure could mean the loss of an entire squadron, or worse, the sinking of a precious aircraft carrier. Will the Doolittle Raid add to the dismal news of Pearl Harbor, Guam, Wake Island, and Bataan, or will it signal the turning of the tide?<br/><br/>The History<br/>Washington &ndash; April 21, 1942: After two days of rumor prompted by Japanese radio broadcasts, President Franklin Delano Roosevelt finally agrees to a press conference. Deftly avoiding difficult questions, he claims insufficient information to neither confirm nor deny the biggest news story of the four month old war. To placate tenacious journalists, however, he tells the press that the attack on Kobe, Osaka, Nagoya, and Tokyo by United States aircraft, was launched from a mysterious base he would only call &ldquo;Shangri-La,&rdquo; an imaginary island from the recently published novel Lost Horizon. His impish grin, if not his words, tell the press that the top secret operation dubbed Special Aviation Project Number One has indeed been a success.<br/><br/>That same day China&rsquo;s foreign minister hands a telegram to Army Air Corps Chief Hap Arnold. It has taken some time to arrive in Washington, an indication that all may not be well with the mission. Dictated two days ago by the commander of that top secret operation, a distraught Lt. Colonel James Doolittle, it reads:<br/><br/>Mission to bomb Tokyo has been accomplished. On entering China we ran into bad weather and it is feared that all planes crashed.<br/><br/>Telegram in hand, Arnold immediately admits to the commander of the Joint Chiefs of Staff that the mission has failed. No bombers have been recovered. After sending that telegram, Doolittle himself expects a court marshall, confiding to his engineer that they&rsquo;ll tie him to a desk for the rest of the war, if he&rsquo;s lucky. Days later he is astonished to learn of his promotion to Brigadier General, and even more so when he is notified that the president recommended the Congressional Medal of Honor.<br/><br/>The Doolittle Raid remains an enigmatic and contradictory episode of World War Two, defying easy interpretation even to this day. Was it a victory or a debacle? Was it a minor footnote in the annals of that war or a significant military event? Was it a desperate bid to avenge the attack on Pearl Harbor, or, a harbinger signaling death and horror soon to visit Japanese cities from the sky?<br/><br/>Narrative Sequence<br/>Much like chapters in a story, the game is organized in six narrative segments, chronologically arranged. Each poses its own set of challenges and prompts decisions that establish the environment and conditions of subsequent chapters.<br/><br/>Planning<br/>Naval<br/>Flight<br/>Over Targets<br/>Recovery<br/>Debriefing<br/><br/>Historical Scenarios<br/>Besides play of the full narrative, the game offers a number of historical dissections, each a scenario focusing on a fragment of the raid. They are also a handy way to learn the game, since each scenario uses only part of the rules. For example, Scenario One covers Doolittle&rsquo;s flight over Tokyo, using only the 8.5x11 Target Map and the Attack Segment. An alternative scenario looks at a night raid by that flight, as Doolittle originally planned it. After playing one or two small scenarios using only the Attack segment&rsquo;s rules, a larger scenario can be played adding the Flight segment. Graduate next to an even larger scenario that starts with the Naval segment. In this way a player can learn the game in program fashion, little by little, studying the history of the raid by playing it as he learns.<br/><br/>Player Aid Folders: The game comes with several 11&rdquo; x 17&rdquo; bi-fold aids allowing the play of each game segment with minimal study of the rule book. The mapsheet is designed to interlock with other game components, including those play aids, in order to make the player&rsquo;s experience fluid.<br/><br/>"}, "188391": {"statistics": {}, "name": "Game of Thrones - Episode 6: The Ice Dragon", "videogamemode": {"2149": "Single-Player"}, "videogameversion": {"291946": "PSN PlayStation 3 Downloadable edition"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2760162.jpg", "videogameseries": {"26449": "Game of Thrones - A TellTale Game Series"}, "videogametheme": {"2148": "Fantasy"}, "videogamefranchise": {"26469": "A Song of Ice and Fire"}, "average": "4.83333", "videogamegenre": {"2152": "Adventure"}, "videogameplatform": {"4435": "PlayStation 3"}, "usersrated": "6", "poll": {}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2760162_t.jpg", "description": "The final episode in the tale of House Forrester's struggle, with the continuing search for the North Grove, the defense of Ironwrath, and the effort to pull in reinforcements from King's Landing.<br/><br/>User Summary<br/><br/>"}, "188392": {"boardgamedesigner": {"87115": {"name": "Matt Hall"}}, "average": "8.5", "poll": {}, "name": "Karacterz", "playingtime": "150", "minplayers": "2", "yearpublished": "2016", "usersrated": "2", "maxplayers": "4", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3320510_t.jpg", "boardgameartist": {"66413": "Jonas \u00c5kerlund"}, "statistics": {}, "boardgamepublisher": {"4": {"name": "(Self-Published)"}}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3320510.jpg", "boardgameversion": {"291953": "First edition"}, "maxplaytime": "150", "boardgamecategory": {"1002": {"name": "Card Game"}}, "age": "12", "minplaytime": "60", "description": "A new epic fighting card game to experience!

It combines trick-taking and area-majority.<br/><br/>During the game, changes occur to both the trick-taking trump and the value of areas for area majority points.<br/><br/>The game has Dice in the suit colours set up on a pentagram showing the value 2 at the start. The trick taking follows the normal pattern, with players following the suit lead if possible and the highest card winning. If there is a Trump suit, highest Trump card will win. But after each trick, the dice values change. The winning suit rises by 1 (or 2 if it was Trump). And one of the dice opposite that winning dice falls by 1. After this change, the lowest dice (if any) now becomes Trump.<br/><br/>But this change in dice values also affects the players' scoring. Before the trick winner adjusts the dice values, the losers place one or two cubes against the dice of the suit they played (or its neighbour). NOTE, the winner of the trick does not get to place cubes, but does choose which dice will drop 1 point. At the end of the round, majority cubes score the face value of the dice (except the Trump die), second most gets half rounded down. Tricks won are also worth 2 points each.<br/><br/>So the game becomes more than just winning tricks. Players want to lose tricks so they can place a cube (2 cubes if you lose on a Trump card) and gain majorities.

Everyone starts out at the edge of the board on a spiral track. Every turn you roll the dice, move closer to doom and draw a card. That card may be good, it may be bad, but it will certainly be unpleasant for someone. Red event cards go into effect immediately and may move you forward or back, swap you with the nearest ship or even make you take another turn. Blue mass cards are...mass cards. Mass is also the most common card type in the deck and comes in 25, 50, 75, and 100 unit variants. Mass is bad, because for every 100 mass you accumulate you have to roll another die on your turn. So if you&rsquo;ve got 300 mass sitting in front of you, you&rsquo;re rolling 4 dice every turn (that's your original die plus 3 more). And that&rsquo;s just not going to end well. Green action cards are like the red event cards, but you can hold onto them and use them at your discretion. Use one to send your highest mass card to the person behind you...or if you happen to be that person behind you can use a different one to dodge that mass and let it keep on heading back. There&rsquo;s even an action card that will let you skip your own turn! When a player inevitably reaches the center of the wormhole, they are out. Flung into the deepest recesses of time and space most likely. When that happens, they mix up their remaining action cards with their mass cards and each remaining player takes one at random (going in order along the track). Play continues until only one player is left on the board, allowing them to safely escape the wormhole and making them the winner.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": {"291988": "First edition"}, "age": "12", "name": "Wormhole!", "playingtime": "60", "boardgamemechanic": {"2072": "Dice Rolling"}, "average": "0", "usersrated": "0", "boardgamefamily": {"22184": "Admin: Unreleased Games"}}, "188414": {"rpgitemversion": {"291990": "DOC Version"}, "statistics": {}, "name": "S.O.S. in the City of the Dead", "rpgproducer": {"87124": "Matt Romaro"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2875426.jpg", "usersrated": "0", "average": "0", "rpggenre": {"28957": "Horror (Zombies)"}, "rpg": {"28979": "Zombies!!!

Taking the role of aliens warning Earthlings of impending doom, players etch glyphs into crop fields with their spaceships, according to changing rules about adjacency between glyph shapes and glyph shading in order to score points for effectively following the rules set forth by the Intergalactic Communications Council.<br/><br/>Each turn, a player places any number of glyph tiles from behind their screen onto the board in an unbroken straight line, connected to glyph tiles that are already on the board. That player scores points for the sum of the values of only the glyphs played (affected by on-board multiplier squares) multiplied by the number of glyph tiles already on the board that were adjacent to their play. Thus, a long string of glyph tiles played parallel to a previous play can net massive points, so players must balance taking advantage of opportunities for huge points with preventing such opportunities for other players. Finally, that player then draws exactly three new glyph tiles either among five face-up glyph tiles next to the play area or from the bag of remaining glyph tiles, regardless of how many they played on their turn, as long as they played at least one glyph.<br/><br/>Glyphs come in four shapes (circles, squares, triangles, and stars) and four shadings (empty, solid, striped, and crossed). Each shading is permitted only to certain shapes, and when a player places glyph tiles on the board, they must satisfy the requirements of both the glyphs being places and the glyphs they are playing adjacent to. The more complex a shading, the more difficult it is to place on the board and the more points it is worth: empty glyphs have no restrictions about what shapes they may be placed adjacent to and are worth only one point; solid glyphs may be adjacent to only three of the four shapes and are worth two points; striped glyphs may be adjacent to only two of four shapes and are worth three points; and crossed glyphs may be adjacent only to a single shape and is worth four points! However, the four active rule cards that determine these permitted adjacencies will get replaced throughout a game, providing new opportunities to play glyphs. Players must plan ahead, acquire useful glyphs, and play them on the most opportune turns.<br/><br/>"}}
