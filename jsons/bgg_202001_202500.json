The game was released in May 2017 for Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One.<br/><br/>In Prey, the player controls Morgan Yu while exploring the space station Talos I, in orbit around Earth&ndash;Moon L2, where research into a hostile alien collective called the Typhon is performed. As the Typhon escape confinement, the player uses a variety of weapons and abilities derived from the Typhon to avoid being killed by the aliens while looking to escape the station. The station is presented as an open world to the player, with progression through the world after obtaining key items or abilities similar in nature to a Metroidvania game.<br/><br/>Arkane's Prey is a re-imagining of the 2006 game Prey developed by Human Head Studios. While Prey 2, a sequel to the 2006 game, had been planned, it fell into development hell following transfer of the intellectual property from 3D Realms to Bethesda Softworks, and was eventually cancelled in 2014. Arkane's version does not use any of the planned sequel's assets, and only incorporates the name and the broad theme of the protagonist being hunted by aliens of the previous games. Arkane built Prey as a spiritual sequel to System Shock, providing the player with several potential means of progressing within the game.<br/><br/>Gameplay<br/>Prey is an action-adventure game with role-playing elements and strong narrative played from a first-person perspective. The player takes the role of Morgan Yu, a human aboard a space station with numerous species of hostile aliens known collectively as the Typhon. The player is able to select certain attributes of Morgan, including gender, and decisions made by the player that affects elements of the game's story. To survive, the player must collect and use weapons and resources aboard the station to fend off and defeat the aliens. According to creative director Raphael Colantonio, the station is completely continuous rather than having separate levels or missions, at times requiring the player to return to areas they previously explored. The player is also able to move around the outside of the station in zero gravity and find shortcuts connecting parts of the station. Colantonio also stated that the aliens have an array of different powers that the player-character can gain over time; one such alien has the ability to mimic everyday items such as a chair.<br/><br/>The game has multiple endings, according to lead designer Ricardo Bare; the endings fall into three major narrative structures depending on how the player broadly interacted with the station and surviving humans, but Bare said there are &quot;tons of little permutations&quot; based on specific events.<br/><br/>Plot<br/>Setting<br/>Prey takes place in an alternate timeline where United States President John F. Kennedy survives his attempted assassination in 1963. The failed assassination catalyzes Kennedy to direct more funding into the space program, allowing it to flourish and accelerating the Space Race. Drawn by humans' activity in space, an alien force made up of many different species, collectively called the Typhon, attacks Earth.[5] The United States and the U.S.S.R. band together to fight off and capture the Typhon, unbeknownst to the general population. Together, they build the space station Kletka (Russian for &quot;cage&quot;) to be used as a prison for the Typhon situated in orbit around Earth's moon. The United States eventually takes full ownership after the fall of the Soviet Union in 1964 and reuses Kletka as part of &quot;Project Axiom&quot;, research labs atop the prison spaces to study the Typhon and bring advances learned from that to Earth. After the &quot;Pobeg Incident&quot; in 1980 where some scientists aboard the station lost their lives to the Typhon, along with geopolitical instability at the time, the United States shuttered Project Axiom, leaving the captive Typhon alive.<br/><br/>By 2025, the newly-founded TranStar Corporation acquires Kletka and by 2030, has refitted it as Talos I, a fully-operational research laboratory to study the Typhon and develop advances in neuroscience; this leads to the creation of Neuromods that harness the Typhon's physiology to restructure the human brain to grant the user new abilities (including superhuman ones). TranStar grows financially successful from sales of Neuromods on Earth. At the time of the game's setting, about 2035, TranStar has further expanded the station to make for suitable living quarters for its staff that spend up to two years on the station between regular shuttles to Earth.<br/><br/>Because of the numerous agencies that operated and expanded Talos I over the decades, the station includes a large mix of architectural designs, ranging from retrofuturism that was popular in 1960s America, to brutalist styles that were common in the Soviet Bloc in the mid-20th century, to opulent Art Deco put in place by the wealthy TranStar executives.<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;[en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prey_%282017_video_game%29 Prey (2017 video game)]&quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/><br/>"}, "202071": {"poll": [], "name": "Fallout 4 - Nuka World", "videogamemode": ["Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["Windows Downloadable edition", "XBox One Downloadable edition"], "average": "8", "videogameseries": ["Fallout"], "videogametheme": ["Post-Apocalyptic"], "videogamegenre": ["RPG", "Sandbox"], "usersrated": "3", "videogameexpansion": ["Fallout 4"], "videogamedeveloper": ["Bethesda Softworks, LLC"], "videogamefranchise": ["Fallout"], "videogameplatform": ["Windows", "Xbox One"], "videogamehonor": ["2016 Global Game Awards Best Expansion of the Year Nominee"], "statistics": [], "videogamepublisher": ["Bethesda Softworks, LLC"], "description": "User Summary<br/><br/>Nuka World adds a new area.

The fears deep within one&rsquo;s mind are amplified and transformed into horrifying monsters from other dimensions, torturing one's body and testing their sanity. Only those with extraordinary will and conviction can escape its devastating grasp. Deep Madness is a fully cooperative board game for 1-6 players with 66 amazingly detailed miniatures, depicting a sci-fi horror world inspired by Lovecraft&rsquo;s work and the Alien series. In the game, players will assume the roles of investigators, venturing into the seemingly empty yet perilous deep sea mining site to find out the truth behind the lost contact event. Unimaginable horror and madness from the dark fear within is waiting.<br/><br/>The game is based on multiple scenarios from a continuous storyline. Each scenario has its own unique board setup, rules, special effects, and goals. From resolving fatal crises to struggling with overwhelming bosses, the investigators will face various quests filled with strategical decisions and fierce combat. With each scenario achieved, they are one step closer to the truth, but also one step deeper into the world of madness. Each scenario of the game plays in a limited number of game rounds, if the investigators fail to achieve the goals before the last round ends, the game is lost and everyone is consumed. Each game round consists of 4 phases: Devour Phase, Spawn Phase, Activation Phase, and Refresh Phase.<br/><br/>In Devour Phase, the Devour Marker progresses one step forward along the Devour Track, indicating the world going deeper into madness. As the Devour Marker progressing, more and more rooms (map tiles) are flipped to their madness side. These rooms will spawn monsters and provide various nasty effects to hinder the investigators or to boost the monsters.<br/><br/>In Spawn Phase, different types of monsters with unique abilities are spawned in the flipped rooms. Monsters do not show their existence in fixed locations, they could be spawned right next to the investigators if they ventured carelessly.<br/><br/>Activation Phase is the core of the game, the investigators and the monsters take turns to act alternately. Monsters do not wait for all investigators to finish their turns like in other cooperative games, but do act between them, so careless planning would put the investigators who are later in the turn order into grave danger, facing fatal attacks before they had a chance to act.<br/><br/>In Refresh Phase, some maintenances are performed, and some special effects are resolved.<br/><br/>In each investigator&rsquo;s turn, it is crucial that the player chooses 3 actions to take wisely. Each kind of action has its own value, and every single decision could be life and death in Deep Madness. Unfortunately, the correct decision is rarely obvious. Moving, attacking, searching, exchanging items, locking the doors, and recovering sanity are the basic actions. Additionally, each investigator also has his/her own unique and irreplaceable abilities to activate. Different combinations of investigators provide distinctive strategies and game experiences.<br/><br/>Monster acts according to its own action pool during its turn. In Deep Madness monsters are highly characteristic, not just in stats, but also in abilities and behaviors. Different combinations of monsters provide unique challenges. And due to the intertwined activation mechanism, even different turn orders of the monsters make each game session different. However, no matter how the monsters setup is, Deep Madness will be a very challenging game, even death could be a strategy.<br/><br/>In the game, investigators battle the horrific monsters, survive the harsh crises, and above all, save their own minds from the devouring of madness. They are given many chances to consume their own sanity, to activate their abilities, to use the effects of items, to reroll the dice, and etc. However they are vulnerable when the sanity is low. After an investigator with insanity tokens manages to kill a monster, the monster will corrupt his/her mind, by permanently flipping the insanity tokens into madness tokens. As the madness token cumulates, horror haunts the investigator by resolving Madness Cards, and each of them has unique negative effect and terrifying flavor text.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "1", "boardgameversion": ["English first edition"], "average": "7.36232", "name": "Deep Madness", "playingtime": "120", "boardgamemechanic": ["Action Point Allowance System", "Co-operative Play", "Dice Rolling", "Hand Management", "Modular Board", "Player Elimination", "Variable Player Powers"], "age": "0", "boardgameexpansion": ["222588", "221421", "222587", "212573", "212574", "222586"], "usersrated": "138", "boardgamefamily": ["Admin: Unreleased Games", "Crowdfunding: Kickstarter"], "boardgamepodcastepisode": ["Cult of the New Board Game Podcast Episode 031 \u2013 All About Airecon"]}, "202078": {"poll": [], "name": "The Asskickers", "videogamemode": ["Cooperative", "Local Multiplayer", "Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["Macintosh Downloadable edition", "Windows Downloadable edition"], "average": "0", "videogametheme": ["Comedy", "Martial Arts"], "usersrated": "0", "videogamedeveloper": ["AGO Games"], "videogamegenre": ["Beat 'em Up"], "videogameplatform": ["Macintosh", "Windows"], "statistics": [], "videogamepublisher": ["AGO Games"], "description": "In a society ruled by a corrupt political and financial elite, three ordinary citizens decide to stand up and fight back.

We find them in films, on posters, in commercials, on snack foods, and even as action figures.  Our societies flirt and play with villains at a safe distance, and we adore them.  That same sense of awe and wonder can be captured by a player roleplaying an evil character.  It does not work for all gaming groups, but for those able to handle it, the experience can be rewarding.<br/><br/>This product can serve several purposes.  Some game groups dabble in evil adventures as a one-shot or short run campaign.  Others want to experiment with evil characters and add one or two in to see how it affects the game.  Still others fully embrace evil characters and find they sometimes need replacement characters after a sudden and unexpected character death.  For whatever reason you need a ready-to-play character sheet, this product is for you.<br/><br/>Welcome to Wicked Wanderers!  In this product, you will discover twenty complete stat blocks for a single PC, level 1 through 20, adhering to the Pathfinder&reg; Roleplaying Game rules.  The core format adheres to the standard non-player character (NPC) stat block most GMs are already familiar with minus the Tactics section.  This makes it easier for the GM to assist with finding information and also prepares the player for the day he or she is running games!  The Special Abilities section includes more detailed write-ups of feats and character abilities than a standard NPC stat block to facilitate faster play.  Sources for spells, races, classes, archetypes, and prestige classes from sources other than the Pathfinder&reg; Roleplaying Game Core Rulebook&trade; (PZO1110) are listed in the Sources section and can be referenced in the Pathfinder&reg; Roleplaying Game Reference Document.<br/><br/>On Evil Characters<br/><br/>Evil neither means &ldquo;stupid&rdquo; nor &ldquo;irrational.&rdquo;  Some evil campaigns implode because characters mistake an evil alignment for the inability to ever follow a rule or make a decision for the greater good.  Evil is an absent or inhibited sense of responsibility for the hurtful consequences of one&rsquo;s own actions for society or individuals that can lead to actions others would deem &ldquo;wrong.&rdquo;  This does not mean an evil character does not feel love or value lawful society or desire the betterment of mankind.  In the real world, there are many evil people who would never consciously describe themselves as such.  Evil characters can work together and form bonds of friendship.  They possess many of the same insecurities, fears, hopes, dreams, and goals as other people; however, they are more willing to go to extremes to fulfill their needs.  An evil character may disregard laws in his pursuit of his desires, but in a roleplaying game setting the player still must abide by the rules of the game:  the game is about the shared story of every character and each story is equally important.  Play the evil character, and have fun!  Make sure you allow your fellow players to have fun as well.<br/><br/>"}, "202086": {"rpgdesigner": ["Skirmisher Game Development Group", "William T.

Each turn, players must choose one of three cards for each horse: Careful, Risky, and Reckless. By playing Careful, a horse will move safely between 1 and 3 spaces on 2D6. Playing Risky means moves of 2-4 spaces, but failing to move at all on rolls of 5, 7 and 9. And Reckless offers the chance of moves from 3-5 spaces, but failure to move on 4, 6 and 8, and a fall (elimination from race) on a 10.<br/><br/>The odds are set in a way that the average outcome of each card is identical, so &quot;judgment&quot; really comes down to &quot;How lucky do you feel?&quot;<br/><br/>Described on the cover as being designed by the (unnamed) &quot;inventor of Minoru, the box has cover art by British equestrian painter George Dervill Rowlandson.<br/><br/>"}, "202089": {"rpgdesigner": ["Stephen Radney-MacFarland"], "rpg": ["Pathfinder System Compatible Product"], "poll": [], "name": "Feigrvidr", "rpgartist": ["Maciej Zagorski"], "rpgproducer": ["Creighton Broadhurst"], "usersrated": "0", "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3056372.jpg", "rpgitemversion": ["PDF Version"], "rpgsetting": ["The Lonely Coast"], "average": "0", "statistics": [], "rpggenre": ["Fantasy (High Fantasy)"], "rpgpublisher": ["Raging Swan Press"], "rpgcategory": ["Sourcebook (rules/options to enhance play)"], "rpgseries": ["Village Backdrop"], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3056372_t.jpg", "description": "A Pathfinder Roleplaying Game GM&rsquo;s Resource supplement by Stephen Radney-MacFarland<br/>Most dwarven holds are vast and ordered halls filled with solemn and stoic craftsfolk.

Some were made for royalty or rich patrons to do tasks or grant effects that do little to nothing to help warriors and explorers. These items do not make a man stronger or smarter, they don&rsquo;t help someone see farther, neither do they scare away goblins. They sweep, they clean, and they ensure a restful sleep. These are the items that could be found in abandoned castles or in a pile of treasure looted from a mansion. The adventurers may not keep them around, but then again maybe they will decide they want the magic music box.<br/><br/>Game masters wishing to place these items into their game should have them replace expensive art items in treasure the party finds. These items could be found anywhere normal magical items are discovered but they were originally commissioned for homes of the extravagantly rich or for royalty. If the party is going to be exploring a corrupt nobleman&rsquo;s home, these would be great set pieces and props to show off his wealth. On the other hand, it would be just as interesting to have an orc chieftain sleeping on a Restful Bed he pillaged from a nearby estate, especially if it still had the pink silk sheets that came with it.<br/><br/>Magical items for the Pathfinder Role Playing Game include the Restful Bed, Sweeping Broom, Cleaning Hair Brush, Tailor's Assistant, Shoe Shine Stand, A Good Mirror, Lasting Bed Warmer, Shifting Banner, Seasonal Tapestry, Magical Mixing Spoon, Paper Lantern Box, the Busyman's Reading Glasses, Self-cranking Music Box, and the Automated Shadow Stage!<br/><br/>"}, "202126": {"rpgartist": ["Rick Hershey"], "rpgitemversion": ["PDF version"], "poll": [], "name": "The Salt of the Earth", "rpgdesigner": ["Daron Woodson"], "rpgproducer": ["Troy Daniels", "Rick Hershey"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3056860.png", "usersrated": "0", "average": "0", "rpggenre": ["Fantasy (High Fantasy)"], "statistics": [], "rpg": ["5e Game System Product (D&D 5th Edition Compatible)"], "rpgpublisher": ["Abandoned Arts", "Fat Goblin Games"], "rpgcategory": ["Sourcebook (rules/options to enhance play)"], "rpgseries": ["5th Edition Backgrounds"], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3056860_t.png", "description": "From publisher blurb:<br/><br/>In the world of 5th Edition fantasy, a character&rsquo;s choice of background represents where he or she came from, and better defines a character&rsquo;s place and role in the world of the game.

With acquisition and tracking ranges measured in tens of thousands of kilometers, to human eyes the people that are trying to kill you are not even a speck. But they can hurt you, even though you can't see them. Precise laser arrays and big particle accelerators, honed by centuries of engineering, can reach out without warning to slit your hull like the belly of a fish, spilling life-oxygen, heat, and fuel-into the hard vacuum. That's why space combat is a game of cat and mouse. Keep yourself wrapped in the mantle of space-cold, dark, silent. Keep your thrust burns to a minimum-they blaze like miniature suns for all to detect. Rig your passive sensors to greedily absorb data, but remain quiet yourself-give nothing away. Keep your weapons ready, in case&hellip;There! A faint trace of mid-wavelength infrared betrays a maneuver drive. Bring up the ladar dishes while the big passive array builds up a targeting solution. The moments seem endless while every crewmember shares the same thought: &quot;Have they seen us?&quot; It is the unseen enemy at this moment doing the same thing that you are? <br/>You might never know the answer.

A declaration written in blood was found pinned to the front door of Mullshires only store, stating that a new Lord had taken residence in Novallese.

Revenge is an encounter designed to be played while the PCs are traveling. Ravlis will ambush them on the road at least a day&rsquo;s travel from the nearest town.<br/><br/>User summary:<br/><br/>A brief scenario for 9th level characters<br/><br/>"}, "202174": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3064278.jpg", "boardgameimplementation": ["Tuscany: Expand the World of Viticulture"], "poll": [], "boardgamedesigner": ["Jamey Stegmaier", "Alan Stone"], "statistics": [], "yearpublished": "2016", "maxplayers": "6", "boardgameartist": ["Beth Sobel"], "boardgamepublisher": ["Stonemaier Games"], "maxplaytime": "150", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3064278_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "60", "boardgamecategory": ["Expansion for Base-game", "Farming"], "description": "From the publisher:<br/><br/>Tuscany Essential Edition features three expansions to Viticulture: the extended board (and 36 wooden stars), structure cards/mats, and special workers (14 meeples instead of the 66 in the original Tuscany, but gameplay is the same).

A dangerous place to be. Especially since a callous murderer has gone into hiding within its maze of streets. With a warning given to police that if they don&rsquo;t call off their manhunt within an hour, another innocent civilian will pay the price. It&rsquo;s up to you and your team to discover which of the 12 suspects is the offender, where they are hiding, which weapon was used on the victim, and arrest him/her before the time runs out.<br/><br/>In this game, each member of the team gets to play as one of Commonville's finest, exploring the city, consisting of tiles. Each tile contains either a suspect, evidence that can be used to eliminate suspects, or something to assist you in solving the case in time.<br/><br/>During each round, each player will roll a varying amount of dice up to 3 times. You may then use the dice for movement (by matching the number on the destination tile), for gathering evidence (with any 4 consecutive dice), and for getting assistance (with any 3 matching dice). Donuts can be used to perform special dice actions (such as passing a die to another player). There is also a special blue Investigation die that can be used to perform actions rapidly (but only by the lead detective). After performing any actions, the team must move the time marker down a number of spaces equal to the number shown on the time die plus 1 minute for every wild 6 that was used for an action.<br/><br/>There are 12 possible suspects in the game. Once you have collected enough evidence to eliminate 11 of them (and found the weapon that was used on the last victim), you must collect an Arrest Warrant from the Police Precinct and arrest the remaining suspect. If you can do all of this before time runs out, the team wins the game.<br/><br/>"}, "202218": {"rpgdesigner": ["John Abrahamson", "Alison Brooks", "Gerry Chriest", "Mary Chriest", "Corey Cole", "Lori Cole", "Simon J.

It's easy to learn and has both recommended and randomized board arrangements.<br/><br/>One player is a zombie master who controls a steadily growing horde of zombies. Every other player is a human who has been infected by the zombie virus. Humans have nine turns to get to a cure. Along the way they will gather weapons and events to help them survive.<br/><br/>In a two/three player game, there is only one cure on the board and in a four player game there are two. This means that in a three/four person game, one human is always guaranteed to not get a cure. Humans will want to work together, at least somewhat in order to overcome the odds, but in the end, one person cannot be rescued, so humans may turn against each other to slow each other down.<br/><br/>Each human begins with one random weapon and their turns consist of two movement phases and an attack phase, which they can use in any order. (Move/Move/Attack, Attack/Move/Move, Move/Attack/Move) A movement is one tile in a non-diagonal direction and an attack lets you use all of the ammo at your disposal during the attack phase. Each weapon has different properties and the ammo is reloaded each turn.<br/><br/>When a human lands on a weapon tile, they add it to their inventory and are able to duel wield weapons. If they land on an event, they trigger it immediately. Some events persist throughout the game (like finding fast shoes, etc.) some are one time use (like finding a live grenade, etc.).<br/><br/>The Zombie Master's turn begins by moving all of the zombies on the board.

This hellion stalks the shadows to prey on the lives of men and feast on their very terror. This ruin of a man has come into the city like a thief in the night and now seems to rule it through fear, yet noone has ever lain eyes upon it and lived. The string of murders left behind in its wake grows more gruesome and horrific as the days tick by and yet there seems to be no end to what this monstrosity has planned for this once serene city. Can you survive the Ruined Man's machinations? Can you survive in a city that is tearing itself apart at the seams? Can you survive when all around you the people turn upon one another in paranoia and suspicion? Can you survive in the Ruined City?<br/><br/>The Ruined City is the first campaign released for The Runed Age setting and takes place in the Grand City of Middelburg as a series of gruesome murders happen and sends this metropolis of a million souls spiralling into panic, paranoia and darkness. The Ruined City is the first of four books in the greater Ruined Man campaign and serves to set up the main characters and events in the campaign, teach the players the unique campaign mechanics and puts them to the test to see if they have what it takes to survive in the dangerous city of Middelburg.<br/><br/><br/>The City of Ruins<br/><br/>The Ruined City is not only an adventure and campaign book. This book also serves as a primer for the city itself. The Grand City of Middelburg was introduced in the Runed Age Corebook as a massive sprawling metropolis, home to a million people and ruled over by corrupt politicians and greedy merchants. Now the Ruined City will take you down onto the streets of Middelburg and show you all the places, buildings, monuments and areas of interest in each district of the city. The Ruined City alone will take you through a whole third of this gargantuan city with nearly a hundred unique locations visited and explored. By the end of the book you will know these parts of Middelburg better than you know your own hometown and you will be able to craft your own adventures and campaigns in and around Middelburg by drawing on the history and culture of the people and locations of these districts. But it isn't all dry reading. Each of the missions in the book is paired to the districts explored in that chapter, meaning that as you read and learn of these places, the campaign will take your through them as well so you can feel and experience them as any NPC in the world would.<br/><br/>The Path to Madness<br/><br/>The Ruined City contains four missions that will test your players to their very limits. Each mission is unique and seemingly separate, yet there is a thread underpinning it all: The Ruined Man. Each mission is as much noir mystery as it is an action adventure and it is up to the players to piece together the &quot;whos&quot;, the &quot;whats&quot; and the &quot;whys&quot; of the Ruined Man before he utterly drives the city into madness. If the missions themselves are not enough of a challenge for your players, the Ruined City will show them how the city falls deeper into suspicion and despair the longer the campaign goes on by making it harder for folks to get along and having the desperate people of Middelburg turn to crime just to survive. Now not only do the players have to fulfil their obligations and complete the missions, but they have to do so with the whole city seemingly agains them.<br/><br/>"}, "202268": {"rpgdesigner": ["Jeremy Reaban"], "rpgitemversion": ["PDF version"], "rpgseries": ["Old School Rules"], "name": "Amazon Warrior", "rpgartist": ["Patricia Smith"], "rpgproducer": ["Jeremy Reaban"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3060172.jpg", "usersrated": "0", "average": "0", "statistics": [], "rpg": ["AD&D First Edition (1e) Compatible Products", "Basic D&D Compatible Product", "Original D&D Compatible Products"], "rpgpublisher": ["(Self-Published)"], "poll": [], "rpgcategory": ["Sourcebook (rules/options to enhance play)"], "rpggenre": ["Fantasy (High Fantasy)", "Fantasy (Sword & Sorcery)"], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3060172_t.jpg", "description": "From publisher blurb:<br/><br/>A common staple of fantasy fiction and mythology is the extremely athletic and skilled warrior who fights without armor and is stronger and faster than others.

From the side of RPG, BaRPG has inherited a melange of exciting characters to play, a definitely sexy level system, dice-rolling and booty (Err&hellip; I mean epic loot!). From drinking games, it has inherited a series of ridiculous games that will keep you drinking. Though in the end there will be a clear winner, we like to think the true prize is in the friends you will make along the way&hellip;<br/><br/>The game is played between 3 to 7 players. Each player receives a character card, and a level and damage tracking card. Every round all players (except whoever last levelled up) roll a dice, highest roll then checks if what was rolled is higher than their current level. If so, that player levels up, reads out their character's power (which is a drinking game), and the group then plays that game. At the end of the game, someone will have to take 'drinks' as well as take damage. The game then enters a market round, where players can 'buy' additional item cards. These item cards can be used at any time during the game, and can either assist players or thwart the efforts of others. The game then returns to a new round of dice rolling.<br/><br/>The first player to reach level 6 wins, and yes there is even an item that can be played against another player to put him/her back to level 1. There are in total 10 characters with associated games, and these characters will swap during the game as part of the item card mechanics. Additionally, losing a total of 4 'sober' (damage) points will also return the player to level 1, force them to change their character, and lose all accumulated items.<br/><br/>"}, "202276": {"boardgamedesigner": ["Kemal Yun"], "statistics": [], "name": "Wakkawakka", "playingtime": "15", "minplayers": "2", "yearpublished": "2016", "usersrated": "0", "maxplayers": "2", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3073794_t.jpg", "average": "0", "boardgamepublisher": ["Yun Games"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3073794.jpg", "boardgameversion": ["First edition"], "maxplaytime": "15", "poll": [], "age": "8", "minplaytime": "5", "description": "Wakkawakka is a turnbased two Player game.

This gives the game a new feeling already on the surface. Square tiles are used to simulate subways in a downtown megalopolis.<br/><br/>While once 1830 could be called the premier game of stock manipulation and 1841 is the game with the greatest speed of technological development, now Crisis is the toughest, most complex, and most unpredictable game of business strategy. Measuring complexity is hard but years of testing have produced counter-strategies for every strategy and not enabled me to foresee just one round, what is possible in 1830 or 1841.<br/><br/>So what makes Crisis so tough? First of all, companies can purchase unlimited numbers of foreign shares. This creates complex combines. Second, companies are forced to own more and more foreign shares, what makes good shares scarce. This is an extra duty besides buying a train. Third, foreign assets may only be bought from the or as a director. Fourth, all shareholders can be responsible for under-endowed companies while some might avoid supports and let the director lose his shares even though having supported. Fifth, other shares in such companies may not be given away and can cause more supports. Sixth, half the companies have only certificates that already allow a director change. Seventh, trading many old or new certificates quickly restructures combines, depletes companies, or inflates money. Eighth, the stock market and the round order, which involves players and companies, are particularly flexible. To conclude, dividends are paid only to owned foreign shares.<br/><br/>While the game has a balanced start and good route construction remains important, it becomes more and more essential to excel at wheeling and dealing.

Three of the riders (black, red and yellow) have a special lap counter in their back wheel. These riders are moved with the three coloured dice on the outer lane (with roman numerals) and try to win a lap over their competitors. The game rules calls them &quot;Tempofahrer&quot;, which might be translated as &quot;endurance riders&quot;.<br/><br/>The three other riders are sprinters. They race each other on the inner lane at given intervals and compete just for some points which count only in case of a tie in the number of laps won.<br/><br/>There are the three coloured dice.<br/><br/>These three dice are thrown in turns and the riders in the outer lane advance as many fields as dice mark their colour or their teammate's (three-coloured dice would have been enough and probably better). However, if in a turn none of the dice shows your colour(s), you fall back to the red square with no lap won.<br/><br/>So you hope for a long run of throws with at least one of your colours to win a lap. And most often than not you get a bad throw when you have completed more than three quarters of a lap and you are very near your objective. That hurts!<br/><br/>Meanwhile, the sprinters wait their turn to play. At intervals (the rules are not particularly precise here) the coloured dice are put aside, the riders on the outer lane stay wherever they are, and a short sprint takes place between the three riders on the inner lane. No complicated rules here either, just throw and move, with a couple of penalty squares (2 -only reachable by a double one on the first throw- and 13). Teams whose sprinters land twice on these squares during the game (in different sprints, most probably) are penalized with one lap.<br/><br/>The rules state that some player or onlooker can call a sprint anytime during the game for a special price he is willing to offer (a present for the winner of that sprint).

Over the course of the game, each race must trade and negotiate with the rest to acquire the resource cubes necessary to fund their economy and allow it to produce goods for the next turn. Scheming, dealing, and mutually beneficial agreements are key to success. While technically a competitive game, Sidereal Confluence has a uniquely cooperative feel during the trading phase as no race has the ability to thrive on its own. Trade well, and you'll develop technologies and colonize planets to form a civilization that is the envy of the galaxy.<br/><br/>Each player chooses one of the nine unique and asymmetrical alien races that have come together to form a trade federation in their quadrant. Each race has its own deck of cards representing all the existing and future technologies it might research. Some races also have other cards related to unique features of their culture. These cards represent portions of the culture's economy and require spending some number of cubes to use, resulting in an output of more cubes, ships, and possibly victory points. Since each culture's outputs rarely match their inputs, players need to trade goods with one another to run their converters to create the resources they truly need to run their society most efficiently and have an effective economy. Almost everything is negotiable, including colonies, ships, VP and all kids of resources.<br/><br/>Each game round contains an open trading phase in which all players can negotiate and execute deals for cubes, ships, colonies, even the temporary use of technologies! Players with enough resources can also research technologies, upgrade colonies, and spend resources on their race's special cards during this phase. Once complete, all players simultaneously run their economies, spending resources to gain more resources. The Convocation follows, starting with players sharing newly researched technologies with all other races and following with bidding to acquire new colonies and research teams. Researching a new technology grants many victory points for the prestige of helping galactic society advance. When one race builds a new technology, it is shared with everyone else. Technologies can be upgraded when combined with other technologies.<br/><br/>The ultimate goal is victory points, which are acquired by researching technologies, using your economy to convert resources to goods, and converting your leftover goods into points at the end of the game.<br/><br/>The game is almost all simultaneous play.<br/><br/>"}, "202428": {"rpgartist": ["(Uncredited)"], "rpgitemversion": ["PDF Version"], "poll": [], "name": "Vampire Waltz", "rpgdesigner": ["Khelren"], "rpgproducer": ["Khelren"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3065719.jpg", "usersrated": "0", "average": "0", "statistics": [], "rpggenre": ["Horror"], "rpgpublisher": ["(Web published)"], "rpg": ["Vampire Waltz"], "rpgcategory": ["Core Rules (min needed to play)", "Scenario / Adventure / Module"], "rpgseries": ["Game Chef 2016: Technology"], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3065719_t.jpg", "description": "From the introduction:<br/><br/>The players will play, evenly divided, the vampires, the hunters<br/>and the prey...This is a freeform game: you will have to perform a dance.
