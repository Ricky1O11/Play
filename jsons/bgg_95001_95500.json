Bloodlords have fallen, the Queen no longer reigns, and the once proud city of Penance has been reduced to a war zone.

It contains everything you need to run an Oathbound campaign. This is not a simple reprinting of Oathbound: Domains of the Forge, but a careful compilation of all six preceding Oathbound books, reworked, expanded, and enhanced, with plenty of new material for returning Oathbound fans.

Occasionally, earthquakes would occur and the player would analyze the heat readings and dispatch repair crews to the affected area of the plant.<br/><br/>The game display showed a schematic-like representation of a light water reactor, typical of nuclear reactors in use in the United States at that time. The reactor core was on the left of the screen, with the primary coolant loop to its immediate right. Further right was the secondary cooling loop, and finally the tertiary cooling loop and its associated cooling tower.<br/><br/>The user interacted with the game by moving the joystick, which made a cursor jump from one &quot;hot spot&quot; to another on the screen, each one controlling one part of the reactor systems. There were hot spots for the control rods, cooling pumps and valves. The user could experiment with the reactor systems by moving the joystick up and down, operating the equipment. It was possible to simulate a meltdown by shutting off the primary cooling pumps and withdrawing the control rods all the way.<br/><br/>The game had several skill levels, which controlled the frequency of earthquakes and the &quot;obviousness&quot; of the damage. In the event of an earthquake the screen would shake and a breaking sound would be heard if there was damage.

These games of death, originally started to honor the dead (the munus), began in 264 BC and continued through the Roman Empire in one form or another for over 900 years until abolished in 681 AD. Now with Red Sands Blue Sky - Heroes of the Arena you can recreate the glory and splendor of these games on three levels.<br/><br/>As a gladiator you fight your way through the Empire in hopes of reaching the Colosseum in Rome and perhaps the ultimate glory, the wooden sword of freedom, the rudis. Or perhaps you would rather be a lanista, the trainer or manager of gladiators forming your own troupe or familia gladiatoria. And the third way to play Red Sand Blue Sky - Heroes of the Arena is as the owner of a ludus or gladiator school seeking to reach the ultimate honor, a school in Rome herself.<br/><br/>Red Sand Blue Sky - Heroes of the Arena gives you everything you need to do this and much more. But perhaps the best thing about the game is that it can be played solo against the game mechanics, cooperatively with all players on the same side, or competitively, head to head against your friends.<br/><br/>At the core, the game pits gladiators against other gladiators or animals in arena combat.  Gladiator stats determine how many dice are rolled, and &quot;successes&quot; are then counted from among the dice.  Each combatant, however, has a certain number of &quot;bonus&quot; dice which he may allocate throughout the game to improve his chances.  Tactics enter the game in knowing when to use these dice.<br/><br/>Campaign rules allow you to follow your gladiator's career as he strives to earn his freedom.<br/><br/>A player may also opt to play as a Lanista, building a school of gladiators, buying and training slaves, pitting them against other players (or against the game mechanics) and earning money by wagering on their performances, or selling them to other schools after they have outgrown the region of the empire in which your school resides.<br/><br/>Re-implements:<br/><br/>    Red Sand, Blue Sky: Death in the Arenas of Rome<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>", "minplayers": "1", "boardgameversion": ["First edition"], "average": "7.24762", "name": "Red Sand, Blue Sky: Heroes of the Arena", "playingtime": "15", "boardgamemechanic": ["Area Movement", "Auction/Bidding", "Dice Rolling", "Simulation", "Variable Player Powers"], "age": "10", "boardgameexpansion": ["Heroes of the Colosseum"], "usersrated": "21", "boardgamefamily": ["Ancient Rome", "Gladiators"], "boardgamepodcastepisode": ["Meeples &amp; Miniatures - Episode 74 - Salute 2011&amp; Lots of game discussion with Rich Jones"]}, "95024": {"poll": [], "name": "Ratio", "playingtime": "20", "minplayers": "2", "yearpublished": "0", "usersrated": "2", "maxplayers": "2", "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic968908_t.jpg", "average": "4", "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["Jumbo"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic968908.jpg", "boardgameversion": ["First edition", "Jumbo multi-lingual first edition"], "maxplaytime": "20", "boardgamecategory": ["Abstract Strategy", "Dice"], "age": "0", "minplaytime": "20", "description": "A small game collection containing four abstract game boards, 20 pawns and one dice.

It is a Chess variant. It consists of an A4 sheet of rules.<br/>(Conquest on the Chess board)<br/>Quest-Chess is played with a standard chess set. The moves of the pieces are the same as in regular Chess. White begins by making any five moves. After that, each player may make up to ten moves per turn. However, no piece may be moved more than once during your turn, unless that piece has first made a capture, or has moved to create a check. You may pass your turn any time after making at least one move.<br/>When you make a capture you must stop and give your opponent the opportunity to capture your piece which made the capture. He has one move in which to do this, but may make this 'recapture' in any way possible. He may also refuse to recapture. Once he has made his recapture (or refused to recapture) you then continue on with the rest of your ten moves, and you may again move that piece which made the capture any time during your turn.<br/>If you make a capture on your last move, your opponent does not get a free recapture, as it is then his turn and he must start counting his moves. If he then captures, you may recapture. If you intend to capture and pass, you must announce your pass when making the capture.<br/>When you put your opponent in check, you must stop and allow him one move to get out of check. He may capture the checking piece, he may interpose, or he may move the king. Once he is out of check, you continue on with the rest of your ten moves, and that piece which moved to create the check may move again. If you check your opponent's king on your last move, it is then his turn and he must count his first move in getting out of check.<br/>Castling is considered a king move. Therefore, if you castle, the king may not move again, but the castled rook may still move.<br/>If you move a pawn two spaces, passing your opponent's pawn on the fifth rank, you must allow him the immediate option to capture 'en passant'. When a pawn is promoted to a major piece, that 'new' piece may move on the same turn.<br/>You may never make a move that exposes your king to check, regardless of whether the checking piece has already moved. If your opponent puts you in check by making a recapture and the only way to get out of check is by moving a piece that you have previously moved on that turn, then this is permissible even if it involve a capture. However, if you have a way of getting out of check by moving a previously unmoved piece, you must take that alternative.<br/>When a player is in check and cannot get out of check in one move, it is checkmate, and the game is over. Sometimes checkmate may occur on a recapture. If ten consecutive turns are made without moving a pawn and without capturing a piece, the game is a draw.<br/><br/>"}, "95028": {"poll": [], "name": "Dolce Vita", "playingtime": "60", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": ["Roll / Spin and Move"], "yearpublished": "0", "usersrated": "2", "maxplayers": "6", "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic944645_t.jpg", "average": "2", "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["Piatnik"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic944645.jpg", "boardgameversion": ["German first edition"], "maxplaytime": "60", "boardgamecategory": ["Mature / Adult"], "age": "0", "minplaytime": "60", "description": "Try to collect the most flirt chips in 20 rounds.<br/>On your turn, you roll the die and move across the board; every space you land on has an event connected where you have to pay expenses, gamble in casinos, have a car crash, and other things - good and bad.

The book you are holding in your hand is a guide to the fantasy world Jarkwelt. Jarkwelt is a world for RPGs but that doesn't mean it is the only world for RPGs. It is just our suggestion of how a fantasy world could be. Jarkwelt has since 2004 been visited by many thousand children through the LARPs the organization Junior Roleplaying Copenhagen has been making and it is our hope it will continue to grow and excite children, young people and adults. The book can be used in several ways and depending on who you are and what you want you can get different things out of it. Maybe you are playing an RPG that takes place in Jarkwelt and want to learn more about the world. Maybe you are looking for a world for your own RPG. Or maybe you just think it is exciting to read about yet another universe created by the imagination.<br/><br/>Additional User Summary:<br/><br/>Jarkwelt is a setting specifically created for LARPs (but it can be used for other types of roleplaying games as well). The book focuses on the different groups in the world and the monsters that exist. There are colour photos of a member of each groups nad every monster.<br/><br/>"}, "95069": {"boardgamedesigner": ["Tetsuya Nakamura"], "poll": [], "name": "Shizugatake Campaign", "playingtime": "180", "minplayers": "1", "boardgamemechanic": ["Action Point Allowance System", "Hex-and-Counter"], "yearpublished": "2011", "usersrated": "5", "maxplayers": "2", "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic945118_t.jpg", "average": "7.46", "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["Game Journal"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic945118.jpg", "boardgameversion": ["Game Journal version"], "maxplaytime": "180", "boardgamecategory": ["Medieval", "Wargame"], "age": "0", "minplaytime": "180", "description": "The game covers the important campaign between Hashiba Hideyoshi and Shibata Katsuie after death of Oda Nobunaga.<br/>The game starts February and ends end of April in 1583.<br/>The map covers the area among Kyoto, Kanegasaki, Gifu, and Anotsu.<br/>As you can see from the scale above, this game covers the whole campaign of Shizugatake not only the final battle of Shizugatake.<br/><br/>In each turn, the player roll a die to determine how many missions he can do.

A group of confederates (rebelling against Russian influence in Poland) gained control of the monastery and turned it into fortress. Attacked both by Russian armies they managed to hold Tyniec and to organize numerous attacks on nearby areas. Probably the most amazing of those is conquest of Wawel castle (confederates managed to enter it via old sewer tunnel and took its Russian garrison by surprise).<br/><br/>In the game players take on the roles of officers of confederate forces. Their task is to hold the fortress for specified number of turns (based on difficulty level). They need to organize food for soldiers, support the garrison of Wawel castle, try to keep decent morale among the confederates and most of all prevent casualties among their units. If at any point during the game Tyniec will be left without units to defend it the fortress falls and players loose. Cooperation, planing and a bit of luck is what it takes to win the game.<br/><br/>Player's turn consist of two things. First you draw an event card that will have two effects - one it will control the movement of the Russian forces (reinforcements, advance or press attack on Wawel), second will be actual positive or negative event (that often will give a players choice whether to accept consequences like loosing units, food, morale or discard action cards as a group). Next the player will have a chance to act by playing action card - actions include organizing reinforcement for Wawel, bringing food to the fortress, fighting with Russian units etc. After 4 players turns an upkeep phase occurs - food is needed for soldiers, moral is checked and Russians forces strom the Tyniec.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "1", "boardgameversion": ["Polish edition"], "age": "8", "name": "Proch i Stal", "playingtime": "60", "boardgamemechanic": ["Co-operative Play", "Hand Management"], "average": "6.64583", "usersrated": "24", "boardgamefamily": ["Country: Poland"]}, "95084": {"rpgartist": ["a'lis", "Samuel Araya", "Leanne Buckley", "Paul Butler", "Lance W.

The space you land is either blank (and the next player takes his turn); it on contains an event (like miss one turn, roll the die and move that more spaces, pay a fine, etc.); or it contains a color and a symbol. In the latter case, the player consults his character booklet and looks up the page with the corresponding color and symbol. A short story there is read and and the player has to decide what to do next: the booklet gives two or more choices and each choice corresponds to a numbered paragraph in the rule book, which is looked up and carried out. <br/>These paragraphs are the heart of the game and the key to victory. The rule book also suggests that you read the comic book to understand the game and the story better.<br/><br/>"}, "95101": {"rpgartist": ["(Uncredited)"], "statistics": [], "name": "Other Minds (Issue 1 - Jul 2007)", "rpgdesigner": ["St\u00e9phane Hoerl\u00e9", "Thomas Morwinsky", "Neville Percy", "Gabriele Quaglia", "Hawke Robinson", "Oliver Schick", "Christian Schr\u00f6der", "Chris Seeman"], "rpgproducer": ["Thomas Morwinsky", "Hawke Robinson", "Chris Seeman", "Chris Wade"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic944702.jpg", "usersrated": "0", "average": "0", "rpgissue": ["Other Minds"], "rpgissuearticle": ["Appendix: Maps for 'Mapping Arda'", "Creative Commons License", "Editorial: Here we are!", "Fineprint", "Magic in Middle-earth", "Mapping Arda", "Of Barrow-wights \u2013 Part One", "Table of Contents", "The Acroteriasm of Other Hands", "The Battle Over Role Playing Gaming", "Thoughts on Imladris - Part One"], "rpg": ["The Lord of the Rings Roleplaying Adventure Game", "Middle-earth Role Playing (1st & 2nd Editions)"], "rpgpublisher": ["(Web published)"], "rpgissueversion": ["PDF version"], "poll": [], "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic944702_t.jpg", "description": "Other Minds<br/>Issue 1<br/>July, 2007<br/><br/>Next Issue<br/><br/>"}, "95102": {"rpgdesigner": ["Andrew Baker", "Jeff Carrington", "Ben McCann", "Jesse Walker", "James Wilson"], "statistics": [], "name": "Encounter (Issue 1 - Mar 2010)", "rpgartist": ["Gustave Dor\u00e9", "Jon Hodgson", "Jesse Walker"], "rpgproducer": ["Jesse Walker"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic944701.jpg", "usersrated": "0", "average": "0", "rpgissue": ["Encounter"], "rpgissuearticle": ["Codex Monstrum: Parasites", "Death Mask", "DM\u2019s Toolkit: NPC Peculiarities", "From the Editor - Testing.

Ultimately, the dice, once revealed, will decide the winner.<br/><br/>The Deception Dice cubes get rolled into the &quot;pit&quot; to set the format of play for each hand. The red DD cube defines the number of dice at risk to the loser of the hand (i.e. 1 die or 2 dice). The green DD cube establishes the format of play (i.e. NL - No Look hand, R - reverse direction, Star - extra wild in play, etc.). The red DD indicator is bad luck (roller loses a die) and the green DD indicator is good luck (roller gets to return a previously lost die to their hand). Rolling double DD's has a special consequence! All players shake their colored dice in their shaker cup and throw down keeping their dice concealed from the others. Ones are wild and a player's turn requires a bet to be made which is based upon all the dice in play. Bets will continue to be increased until a player challenges another players bet. Once the dice get revealed, the bettor or caller will lose dice.<br/><br/>The goal of the game is to be the last player with at least a single die.

Employees initially are very eager to stay with a company, but over time are more likely to move to competing companies, unless they get further (monetary) incentives.<br/><br/>Each player starts with 2-4 products (depending on how many players there are) and four event cards.

Then they earn revenue, based on the number of users and the number of suits. Third, the player can use money to hire more employees. Soon, no more new hires are available, and players must steal (or &quot;poach&quot;) employees from other players. The other players try to spend their money to prevent &quot;poaching&quot; from happening. During the product show down at year's end users shift towards products that invested wisely. Outside the regular turn order, event cards can be played by any player at any time, both to further their own objectives as well as to hinder other players.<br/><br/>To win, a players needs to obtain the largest number of users.

With this internet document, you have all of the SORD necessities for role-playing. The official published book (96 pages) now in stores is artistically formatted with a color-glossy perfect binding and contains a plethora of internal artwork by several artists, character sheets, glossaries, indexes, professional editing, a higher level of details and examples, as well as a complete historically-based Robin Hood setting (literature, adventures, maps, sample characters, cultures, professions, equipment, skills, and so forth).<br/><br/>Since there are many downloadable SORD settings on the internet (such as the Ethaerios Fantasy Worldbook, Arthurian Avalon, and QUASAR), this v6.00 rulebook might not be 100% compatible with those earlier supplements scattered across netspace.

Each tree is unique, the growth of its branches based off a fractal algorithm.<br/><br/>To create trees, 10 seedlings are needed in orbit of an asteroid, which then plummet into the ground to grow grass and the trees' roots. A plant may also be grown that attacks invading enemy seedlings by releasing explosive fruit, called a defense tree. Over time, the plant's health, damage, and spawn rate increases. The player can also customize their asteroids with addons called 'flowers'. If a dyson tree has a flower added, dysons with a vastly enhanced firerate and range are produced. If a defence tree has a flower added, lasermines are produced. They are powerful seedlings which can take on multiple enemies with multiple lasers, and a suicidal explosion.<br/><br/>The seedlings can attack enemy asteroids, and take them over by burrowing through the roots to the core, and sapping the energy of the asteroid.<br/><br/>All levels are randomly generated, meaning each playthrough is slightly different. Also, each asteroid is unique in size and values, and produces seedlings with different stats. There are three stats. Speed enhances the moverate of seedlings, strength enhances the damage of seedlings, and energy increases the speed at which seedlings can convert enemy asteroids.

Each player controls a dragon that has the ability to fly, breathe fire, and perform several special abilities with the help of powerups.<br/><br/>The core mode of the game, called &ldquo;Treasure&rdquo;, challenges the player to collect as much gold as possible over a 10 minute period. Gold is earned in a variety of ways, the simplest being to use fire breath to destroy merchant wagons or buildings and then pick up the treasure chests that appear. Dragons have a limited carrying capacity, so from time to time the player must return to his hoard and deposit the gold there.<br/>When certain key thresholds of gold have been collected at the hoard the dragon &ldquo;levels up&rdquo; and is awarded with upgrade points which can be distributed amongst four key abilities: speed, fire breath, carrying, and armor.

The player ship is able to fire short-range bullets, which can destroy enemy projectiles, as well as temporarily immobilize the enemy turrets.<br/><br/>Solar Fox contains a somewhat unique system for rewarding players who complete stages quickly.  At the start of each stage, a meter with the words &quot;skip a rack&quot; will begin to slowly shrink.  If the player manages to collect all the energy cells before this meter has disappeared, he will skip the next stage (or &quot;rack), while still receiving all that stages' points.  A button to control your ship's speed assists in this pursuit, though rushing through stages is naturally more risky than going through them slowly, adding an interesting risk-reward system to the game.<br/><br/>The Atari 2600 version features significant gameplay changes, and is considered (by many enthusiasts) to be superior to it's arcade counterpart, which was an exceedingly rare occurrence for 2600 ports.  The number of enemy turrets was reduced, their rate and style of firing was altered, and your ship's ability to shoot back was eliminated altogether.  Also, the background grid was removed, which makes the game slightly more difficult to navigate, since player movement is inherently grid-based.<br/><br/>The Commodore 64 version is a more faithful port of the arcade game, and doesn't contain any of the changes made in the 2600 game.

As with other Konami titles of the time, it was ported to several 8-bit computer systems and video game consoles.<br/><br/>Konami's Ping Pong can be played singleplayer or multiplayer, using 11 point scoring rules; the first player to attain a score of 11 or higher, leading by two points, wins the game (to a maximum of 14-14, at which point the next point wins). The player must win the best of two out of three games in order to beat the match. The playfield is shown from an isometric perspective with the players shown as disembodied hands; players placed on the far-side of the table will find hitting the ball is much more difficult. However, the player is always positioned on the near side during the single player mode. All the essential moves are represented: forehand, backhand, lob, and smash.<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;Konami's Ping Pong&quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "95299": {"poll": [], "name": "Aurora-opoly", "playingtime": "0", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": ["Auction/Bidding", "Dice Rolling", "Player Elimination", "Roll / Spin and Move", "Set Collection", "Stock Holding", "Trading"], "yearpublished": "1994", "usersrated": "0", "boardgamefamily": ["Monopoly", "Monopoly: short derivatives"], "maxplayers": "4", "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic947975_t.jpg", "average": "0", "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["(Self-Published)"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic947975.jpg", "boardgameversion": ["First edition"], "maxplaytime": "0", "boardgamecategory": ["Economic", "Negotiation"], "age": "0", "minplaytime": "0", "description": "According to the rules:<br/><br/>The Object of the game is to be the only player not to become bankrupt.<br/><br/>To Set Up the game each player chooses a token and begins on the start square.

When a player owes more money than he can raise by selling customers and bankrupting his businesses, he is out of the game.  Any bankrupt businesses a play has, goes to the persona or bank that he owes money to.  The player who receives the bankrupt businesses immediately has to pay the bankruptcy charge plus 10% for any business he wants to own.

It is a world where the weak are crushed and the strong survive, where those who are bigger and more powerful bully those who are weaker and more vulnerable. It is a world in need of a Hero, someone who can stand against the darkness and fight on behalf of the downtrodden. A Hero like YOU.<br/><br/>Chronicles of Arax is a game where you, the reader, takes on the role of a Hero in the world of Arax. It is your job to fight against evil and injustice, to undertake various Quests to further the goals of good, and hopefully get some fame and loot in the bargain!<br/><br/>But Arax is a dark and dangerous world, and death will await you at each turn. The ancient empires of men, dwarfs and elves are crumbling, beset on all sides by the dark hordes of the orcs, goblins, demons and the undead.<br/><br/>The once magnificent elven forests, at one time beautiful, green and lush, are now withering and dying, the magically-crafted towers and wondrous tree-cities that lie within broken and shattered. Only the elven talent at manipulating mana, the magical force that permeates Arax, has stopped their race from being wiped out.<br/><br/>The dwarven fortresses built high in the mountains of Arax are now overrun with goblins, who burrowed up through the earth and attacked from within the otherwise impenetrable fortress walls. One by one the fortresses fall and, although the dwarven courage and skill with weapons is legendary, even they find themselves overwhelmed by the sheer number of goblins pouring in to their homes.<br/><br/>And humanity find themselves sorely pressed on all sides, their cities and towns constantly raided and besieged. The barbaric orc tribes march down from the north, pillaging everything in their path. The necromantic legions from the southern desert kingdoms shamble forward, unrelenting in their march towards the human lands. Some humans even turn against their own, worshipping demonic powers in secret and plotting the downfall of their race from within.<br/><br/>But all is not lost. Many Heroes have arisen in these dark times, men and women, human, elf and dwarf, each of them seeking to turn back the tide of darkness that threatens to engulf Arax. Will you be one of these Heroes?<br/><br/>What You Need To Play<br/><br/>There are a few things you will need to have handy in order to play the game. First and foremost is a copy of these rules. You may print these rules for your own use, and even give them to friends and family if you want.<br/><br/>You will need a set of polyhedral dice. This means you need a d4, d6, d8, d10, d12 and d20 (check out the glossary if you are not sure what this means).

Ownership of DRK-GD is required in order to play this game.  This will be the second in the series of games that simulate the battle to eliminate the Kursk Salient.  This game is an expansion game and players must own DRK-GD in order to play this game.  The 3rd Panzer Division held the left flank of XLVIII Panzer Korps and plays a major role in the crossing of the Pena River and keeping the pressure off the Gross Deutschland Divisions left flank so they can push north to Oboyan and Kursk.   This game expands the order of battle by 1 Panzer and 1 Infantry Division, 1 Tank Corps, and a Rifle Division.  Most of the maps from DRK-GD are reused in this game and an additional (4) 11&quot; x 17&quot; map sections are added along with about 500 additional unit counters and markers.<br/><br/>Death Ride Kursk - 3rd Panzer is GSI's second offering on the Eastern Front. The game focuses on tactical level combat and maneuver during the German attack at Kursk in July 1943.<br/><br/>The game features the 3rd Panzer Division and some supporting XLVIII Panzer Corps units at mostly Platoon and some Company/Battery level and the Red Army (10th Tank Corps, and other rifle and supporting elements) at Company/Battery level. The combat system utilizes combat multipliers that players must use correctly to have the best effect. Each hex is 330 meters.  Turns are 2 hours long during the day and 4 hours at night.   The rules are modeled around the seven battlefield operating systems which make them easily understood and easy to learn.  Unlike other games at this level the rules are not massive.  This system features extensive use of obstacles (mines, wire, improved positions, and fortifications), a patrol rule, overwatch fire, air and artillery support, and reserve movement.  These obstacles help channel the attack and force the Germans into kill sacks and forcing them to push through the heavy resistance to take ground.  Overwatch is a type of fire that allows the player to move a short distance and then setup to fire suppressive fire at enemy units that might otherwise use opportunity fire.  Reserve movement will allow a player to respond to enemy movement and move more units into a hex to strengthen it before an assault.  Units are modeled to represent the 2 major types of weapons that most units have.  Secondary (usually small arms) and a primary (main gun, machine guns, etc...).  These weapons may fire at different targets if they want.  They also effect targets differently.   Suppression is also handled uniquely in this game.  Units that are suppressed get a defense bonus since they take better advantage of the terrain in the hex, while at the same time they have their other factors reduced.  Units are also modeled as needing transports and get the benefits of movement from them with the vulnerability that goes with it.  The battle follows the divisions actions during the 10 days of the battle.   The division operated on the left flank of the Gross Deutschland Division.   The additional armor in this game makes play extremely fun and intense and they include Panzer Regiment 6 (90 MkIII and IV tanks) and 10th Tank Corps 3 Tank Brigades (120 T34 and 60 T70 tanks).  3rd Panzer has its 2 Infantry Regiments and supporting elements.  The game will also force players to account for Command and Control and Supply.   Maintenance and repair are critical to both sides as this determines most of the replacements that arrive every morning.  Troop replacements are generated by returning casualties to the battle.

The deck includes cards for a range of notes &ndash;quavers, crotchets, semibreves and minims; dotted crotchets and dotted semibreves; along with doublet and triplet crotchets and doublet, triplet and quadruplet quavers. It also includes the corresponding rests for quaver, crotchet, semibreve and minim.<br/><br/>The card designs differ from the earlier decks. As the cards focus upon elements of rhythm, the notes are depicted on a plain background without staff lines. This allows players to visually focus upon the individual note values rather than positioning against the staff to discern the pitch of the notes.<br/><br/>Games<br/>The MelodieXpress Rhythm Deck provides a set of cards only. The cards may be used with the games from the MelodieXpress Note Reading and Composing Music packs. &lsquo;Snap&rsquo;, &lsquo;Memory&rsquo;, &lsquo;Rows&rsquo; and &lsquo;Rhythm Lunch&rsquo; all work well with this deck &ndash; though the players focus upon matching the note duration rather than its pitch.<br/><br/>Next Steps<br/>This deck provides fans with an early look at some of the cards which will be used in the upcoming MelodieXpress Rhythm Pack.

Using the approach that we learn best through play, MelodieXpress uses games and activities to introduce the key concepts of musical notation and music theory.

No arcade modes, no steering aids - YOU have to do the driving. It is therefore highly recommended to drive the sim with a steering wheel, because even though you can use keyboard and/or mouse, a wheel is what you use in a real car, so a wheel should be used in a serious racing simulator. Especially when going online, where fast reactions are required.<br/><br/>In Live for Speed S2 you can race alone or against the AI, but the real fun is to be found online, in multiplayer mode. Racing against real people is simply the best thing and LFS makes it easy for you to do so. There are also several online racing leagues you can take part in, if you are looking for something with a more competitive edge.<br/><br/>A serious simulator obviously requires a very good physics simulation to provide the thrill and fun of real racing. This is done by simulating all aspects that are important to racing. LFS S2 is the second step towards our vision of what the sim must become and already does a very good job in simulating real racing. Many racing aspects are covered - comprehensive setup possibilities, fuel usage, tyre wear, a lot of different surface types, intriguing racing environments, different car classes, etc. All these aspects make sure you have enough to practise with and spend time on learning the flow of the tracks. Additionally, don't forget to plan your pitstops - find out how much fuel your car uses on a track and how are your tyres behaving on any track, with your driving style. All aspects you will have to think about in real racing and as such you need to think about them in LfS S2 as well.<br/><br/>"}, "95472": {"rpgartist": ["Kevin Christian", "Mark Garlick", "Chris Harper", "Scott Mulder", "William Signs"], "statistics": [], "name": "Star Frontiersman (Issue 9 - Sep 2008)", "rpgdesigner": ["Bill Logan", "Greg Rapp", "R.
