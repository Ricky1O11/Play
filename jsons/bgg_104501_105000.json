The basic game is played as follows:<br/><br/>At the start of the game, the first player places the neutral Moeraki-ball on one of the nine central intersections of the board. After that, the players take turns placing one of their own pieces on the board. When a square is on the board is completely enclosed by pieces, the player who has the majority (normally 3:1, but it can be 2:1 or 3:0 next to the edge or the neutral Moeraki-ball) claims the field and places a tribe marker on it.<br/><br/>The game can be won in one of four ways:<br/>1. Tahuna (beach): A player wins if he has enclosed a field with four of his own pieces.<br/>2. Awa (river): A player wins if he has a piece on each of the intersections on one of the diagonal lines from one edge to another edge.<br/>3. Ara (road): A player wins if he has a piece on each of the four intersections on one edge.<br/>4. Marae (holy ground): When all the fields in the center have been claimed, players count the number of tribal markers they have got on the board (markers that are on the edge and that have been claimed with a 2:1 majority count only half). The player with the most markers wins the game.<br/><br/>The players win several matches, until one of them has won the pre-determined amount of matches.<br/><br/>In the advanced version of the game, both players receive a Maori-Tane (warrior). Once during the game, a player may place the Tane on the board instead of a tribal marker. When he does so, all he chooses a direction. Any fields between the Tane and the edge in that direction cannot be claimed; any markers already present are removed.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": {"117100": "German first edition"}, "age": "8", "name": "Moeraki: Kemu", "playingtime": "25", "boardgamemechanic": {"2048": "Pattern Building"}, "average": "7.14583", "usersrated": "36", "boardgamefamily": {"10308": "Country: New Zealand"}}, "104554": {"boardgamedesigner": {"51398": {"name": "George Leach"}}, "poll": {}, "name": "Sweet16: Matchmaker", "playingtime": "30", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": {"2047": "Memory"}, "yearpublished": "0", "usersrated": "5", "boardgamefamily": {"98": "Traditional Card Games"}, "maxplayers": "5", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2629390_t.jpg", "average": "7.22691", "statistics": {}, "boardgamepublisher": {"171": {"name": "(Public Domain)"}}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2629390.jpg", "boardgameversion": {"117104": "Print and Play version"}, "maxplaytime": "30", "boardgamecategory": {"1002": {"name": "Card Game"}}, "age": "4", "minplaytime": "30", "description": "Sweet16 is a lightly themed memory game inspired by Calcory from Mu & more by Doris Matthaus and Frank Nestel.

But these locations are not the only places where the investigators can encounter the Cthulhu Mythos; there are many Forgotten Corners of Lovecraft Country just waiting to be explored.<br/><br/>With Forgotten Corners of Lovecraft Country, Vol. 1, Miskatonic River Press is proud to present two new settings and three scenarios that expand Lovecraft Country for Call of Cthulhu&rsquo;s classic era. West of Arkham and south of Dunwich, along the Aylesbury Turnpike, lies the tiny, sleepy crossroads village of Dean&rsquo;s Corner, the middle of nowhere where nothing ever happens, both a haven and a prison to its inhabitants; and beyond it, the rough and tumble industrial town of Aylesbury, a failed dream of utopia, built on a foundation of social engineering and ancient sorcery.<br/><br/><br/>admin comment<br/>moved to (Unpublished Products) on August 23, 2016<br/>we assume this was never published due to the death of Keith Herber<br/>who was the founder of the linked publisher<br/><br/>"}, "104680": {"rpg": {"310": "Call of Cthulhu (2nd - 6th Edition)"}, "statistics": {}, "name": "Atomic-Age Cthulhu", "rpgproducer": {"28": "Charlie Krank"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1988227.jpg", "usersrated": "9", "rpgitemversion": {"201527": "PDF version"}, "average": "7.3", "rpggenre": {"988": "Horror (Cthulhu Mythos)"}, "rpgcategory": {"2084": "Scenario / Adventure / Module"}, "poll": {}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1988227_t.jpg", "description": "From the back of the book:<br/><br/>NEVER BEFORE had the world faced a threat as potentially devastating as the A-bomb&mdash;and the even more lethal H-bomb that followed.

It invariably leaves its mark on everything pure and innocent it comes across, and leaves in its wake a foul trail of corruption.<br/><br/>Crossroads of the Gothic Earth is an atlas of some of the lesser known corners and crevices of Gothic Earth that the Red Death has managed to find and corrupt. It contains some of the smaller human settlements that might have been overlooked by the adepts and scholars in their works of Forbidden Lore, but nonetheless have come to the attention of the Red Death and its minions. In addition to settled habitations, it contains geographical features and landmarks that have also in some way been touched by the malignant hand of the Red Death.<br/><br/>The greatest weapon for fighting the Red Death and its minions is knowledge. This atlas attempts to fill in some of the gaps to make the fight a little easier for the champions of all that is good.<br/><br/>"}, "104727": {"rpgitemversion": {"117719": "PDF version"}, "poll": {}, "name": "The Forgotten Children", "rpgproducer": {"47118": "Joe Bardales"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1103868.jpg", "usersrated": "0", "rpgsetting": {"1882": "Masque of the Red Death"}, "average": "0", "statistics": {}, "rpg": {"13237": "AD&D Second Edition (2e) Compatible Products"}, "rpgcategory": {"2108": "Sourcebook (rules/options to enhance play)"}, "rpggenre": {"167": "History (Alternative)"}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1103868_t.jpg", "description": "User summary:<br/><br/>The Forgotten Children was the third Ravenloft Netbook published by the Kargatane, a group of Ravenloft fans who went on to run the official fan site for many years.

The players keep scooping and replacing tiles until one player calls out &quot;Yummy!&quot; when they believe they have spelled the word.

It was not billed as a computer version of Squad Leader, though it did bear some similarities in that players commanded roughly company sized forces. Only three maps were available for play. The game was released for Apple II, Commodore 64, and DOS systems. The game was unique (and rather unsatisfying to many) in that for each of the nine scenarios, victory was not declared at game's end. A results screen would show losses in men and equipment, and list possession of objectives, leaving the determination of &quot;victory&quot; to the player. Like the original Squad Leader board game, German, Russian and American nationalities were represented. Unlike earlier attempts at computerized tactical combat simulations (notably Dniepr River Line, also by Avalon Hill, which included a physical copy of Squad Leader's board 3 and cardboard counters which were necessary for gameplay), the computer tracked the movement and position of all units as well as handling all computations for sighting and combat resolution. (Some computer games, notably those by Simulations Canada, were being sold at that time with either a physical mapboard and game pieces that the player had to use to manually track movement and position, or even plastic covered maps and grease pencils).<br/><br/>Initial packaging had the name of the designer, Ralph H.

The title marked the beginning of the end of board game style single screen or scrolling playfield games. It was also the first statistics-based baseball simulation game on a video game console; all prior console baseball games were arcade-style recreations of the sport.<br/><br/>The game's full formal title (due to licensing requirements) was Intellivision World Series Major League Baseball. It was typically shortened to World Series Baseball in use to differentiate it from the prior Mattel baseball game.<br/><br/>Although IWSB was the first sports game ever created that showed the action in 3D, the underlying mathematical models were not three-dimensional due to the very restricted available RAM on Intellivision.<br/><br/>Replacing a fixed top-down camera with multiple field-level cameras also allowed the game to show fly balls for the first time in any baseball game, with a ball-sized shadow tracing the ball's path when it was off-screen above the field of view.

ROLEPLAYING MECHANICS. Characters in TSF all possess a Good, Neutral, and Evil trait, one of which dominates depending on the PC&rsquo;s alignment, but the other two exist within the character as well, and come out from time to time. Players gain Energy Points for roleplaying their characters, whether choosing to follow or go against their alignment (and its associated trait, for example a Good character following his self-sacrificing Good trait, or a Good character instead acting out his greedy Evil trait). Whichever they choose, they tick one space along the spectrum toward Good, Neutral, or Evil, depending on the morality of the action taken. Lawful, Neutral, and Chaotic represent the Stability of the character, i.e., how often they stick to or diverge from their alignment and its associated trait.<br/><br/>In addition, each Ability score comes with an associated Descriptor. For example, Strength ranges from Feeble to Mighty, while Intellect ranges from Moronic to Brilliant. These Descriptors can also be used to gain Energy Points. A Reckless or Foolhardy PC might charge into battle at an inopportune time or pull a lever before the party has decided whether it seems like a beneficial course of action. Just an attempt at roleplaying either a Trait or a Descriptor earns the PC Energy Points &mdash; they don&rsquo;t have to succeed at the action.<br/><br/>2. ENERGY POINTS. Exploration, battle, spellcasting, and other elements of the game can be enhanced by spending Energy Points, a pool of energy for each PC that starts out at maximum at the beginning of a new day. Characters can earn extra Energy Points (even above and beyond their starting level for the day) by roleplaying. Energy Points can be used in any way allowed by the MC (aka, Master Creator, TSFs version of &quot;GM&quot;) to accomplish Special Effects. A few examples of Special Effects include: pinning an opponent, knocking-out a combatant, re-casting a prayer previously cast, swapping out a spell for one of equal or lower level, moving overland at double-speed, inflicting extra damage on a successful hit, and so on broken into major categories of Exploration, Weapon Attacks, and Spellcasting. The only caveat is that the player MUST explain how his or her character is accomplishing this effect in a realistic way given the current situation. The MC is the final arbiter of what is possible in the game world. For example, a thief wants to pin a gnoll to a stone stelae during a battle in a Stonehenge-type ruin; unless the dagger being used is magical, it defies the logic/physics of the game world for the dagger to pass through the gnoll and dig into the stone deep enough to pin the Gnoll. If the thief were to knock the gnoll down and pin it to the hard ground with the dagger, the MC would most likely allow it. There are limits to how many Special Effects can be used per attack, of course, and when PCs run out of Energy Points, they can always engage in additional roleplaying to earn more.<br/><br/>3. WOUND LEVELS. THE SECRET FIRE uses a combination of hits (or hit points) and Wound Levels from other games, including INDIANA JONES (D6), THE STAR WARS ROLEPLAYING: REVISED &amp; EXPANDED (D6), and the D6 SYSTEM RULEBOOK, with a few major changes. At each of the five levels &mdash; Grazed, Hurt, Wounded, Messed Up, At Death&rsquo;s Door &mdash; the PC suffers some effect, either positive, negative, or both. For example, a +1 to attacks at the Hurt Wound Level, or a critical success on a natural 15-20 or a critical failure on a natural 1-5 at the Messed Up level, bearing in mind, that like all things in TSF, everything stacks. Which segues nicely to:<br/><br/>4. EVERYTHING STACKS! Enough said. No looking up, figuring out, arguing over, etc. Everything stacks.<br/><br/>5. NARRATIVE VS. NUMERICAL STYLE. Players use codewords that represent numerical values to make the entire game, including and especially battles, more immersive.<br/><br/>EXAMPLE 1 (WITH ATTACKER SPENDING ENERGY POINTS): Dave shouts out, &quot;Using my muscular strength, I slash at the Goblin with my longsword Garm&rsquo;s Tooth, landing a serious blow for 10 points of damage! I finish the attack by slamming my shoulder into the Goblin&rsquo;s chest, knocking it to the ground!&quot;<br/><br/>EXAMPLE 2 (A PLAYERS RESPONDS TO A SPELL ATTACK): Scott says, &quot;My anti-magic utterly fails to absorb the evil wizard&rsquo;s rain of fire, dropping me to death&rsquo;s door!&quot;<br/><br/>All players at the table understand what these phrases/code-words mean and are encouraged to embellish and create entirely new ways of expressing them along with the MC.<br/><br/>6. SANDBOX-STYLE, I.E., NOT NICELY BALANCED FOR YOUR PARTY. The world is the world. Parties may encounter easy obstacles they can overcome in seconds or impossible obstacles that will instantly destroy every member of the group. PCs must take care to figure out which is which and to attempt other strategies before engaging everything in battle, including parley and flight. This is a game of exploration and danger. (As a related tangent, the vast amount of experience points earned by PCs come from gaining treasures and accomplishing quests, with a few points received for defeating or successfully parleying with monsters).<br/><br/>7. RESISTANCES VS. SAVING THROWS/DEFENSES. All attacks are made against an opponent&rsquo;s Dodge score. All damage, however, is rolled against the opponent&rsquo;s Resistance score based on the type of attack. For example, a sword thrust hits a ghoul (i.e., hitting its Dodge) and the damage taken is determined by subtracting the ghoul&rsquo;s Armor Resistance (which absorbs the blow) from the sword&rsquo;s damage roll, with a minimum of 1 damage. Other Resistances include Anti-Magic vs. Paralyzation, Dragon Breath, Spells; Endurance vs. Poison, Petrification, Death Magic; and Willpower vs. Charm, Psychic Assault, Prayers.<br/><br/>8. THE ELDER GODS &amp; THE CHARACTER WHEEL. The Character Wheel or Mosaic at the center of THE SECRET FIRE character sheet becomes filled in with different colors based on the types of encounters the PC finds himself or herself facing over his or her adventuring lifetime. Other players can just glance at another PC&rsquo;s Character Wheel to get a sense of that PC&rsquo;s life up to this point, just like you can get a vibe about someone just by looking at them or spending time with them. The Elder Gods are five primordial &quot;forces&quot; representing positive and negative aspects of their areas of power. They can be called upon for succor &ndash; but players who do so find themselves owing them a favor that may called in at the worst possible time. There are also Deities in the world worshipped by the masses who are in turn led by Holy-Men and Holy-Women acting as the representatives of these Deities in the world. Deities and Elder Gods are NOT the same. Deities themselves would quiver in the presence of an Elder God. The Elder Gods come into play in other ways, as well, but those remain the purview of the MC and will not be discussed here for they should remain a secret from the players (one of the benefits of being the MC)&hellip;<br/><br/>9. UNIQUE TALISMANS. Everyone talisman (aka magic item) is a unique item, complete with special adornments, qualities, name, and history, in addition to any (relatively simple) magical abilities. Tables help MCs develop and design these items, plus pre-generated items can be selected and used immediately.<br/><br/>10. GYGAX&rsquo;S VISION FOR THE FUTURE. As Gail Gygax has mentioned on her Facebook page, a screenwriter is currently writing a movie based on Gary&rsquo;s life using Gary&rsquo;s unpublished works and various writings about himself from his diaries and his ideas for gaming from his first thoughts about creating RPGs through this last days on this earth from his notebooks. The name of the screenwriter has not been revealed, but he has in his possession the inner thoughts of Gary Gygax on many things, especially his vision for the future of gaming, which happens to be the same as my own sensibilities.<br/><br/>11. SIMILARITIES &amp; ADDITIONAL CHANGES. TSF has Ability scores, equipment, attack charts,increasing rather than decreasing Dodge score (i.e., higher is better), a unique skill system which requires a PC to roll their Ability score or under to accomplish a task on a number of six-sided dice, with that number of dice based on the difficulty of the task in question (though PCs Trained in a particular skill get to roll one die less when making the roll). Plus, a Montage System allows the MC and players to move through long periods of game-world time very quickly with interesting and randomized results.<br/><br/>12. IMMEDIATE TECHNOLOGY. THE SECRET FIRE will also have a look-up app that DOESN&rsquo;T require an internet connection (since all data will be stored locally on your mobile device, thereby making the app faster as an added benefit) available for a ONE-TIME price on the DAY the game is released, unlike other gaming companies. More apps and in-app purchases will become available for sale, but none are required to play and you don&rsquo;t have to sign up for an ongoing subscription.<br/><br/>To sum up, THE SECRET FIRE is a fast, flexible, and familiar yet unique fantasy roleplaying game that focuses on immersion, substituting words for numbers whenever possible, putting you at the heart of the experience.<br/><br/>"}, "104891": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1065787.jpg", "is_expanded_by": {"104394": {"name": "Thunderstone: Werewolf Promo Pack"}}, "poll": {}, "boardgamedesigner": {"615": {"name": "Mike Elliott"}}, "statistics": {}, "yearpublished": "2011", "maxplayers": "5", "boardgameartist": {"14611": "Jason Engle"}, "boardgamepublisher": {"396": {"name": "Alderac Entertainment Group (AEG)"}}, "maxplaytime": "60", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1065787_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "60", "boardgamecategory": {"1002": {"name": "Card Game"}}, "description": "Thunderstone: Heart of Doom brings the struggle introduced in Thunderstone to an epic climax.

Here at Helper Monkey, we've taken that sentiment to heart. If you have a problem, any problem, we'll dispatch a team of cybernetic monkeys to help you! Our team of monkeys come with bio-mechanical neural interfaces to give them the skills they need to complete any mission. This not only allows our monkeys to understand both written and spoken language, it also allows them to learn valuable skills based on the hats they equip themselves with. To have Helper Monkeys solve your problem, simply log on, describe the nature of your problem in 140 characters or less (we do accept tweets), and our code monkeys will trace you down and send a top team of gorillas, chimpanzees, orangutans, and other simians to help you! No matter the problem, no matter how far, we have a monkey in a hat for that!<br/><br/>About the Game:<br/><br/>HelperMonkey.com is a silly game of action, adventure, and bananas. Each player takes on the role of a primate cybernetically enhanced to possess certain skills based on the specially prepared hats they wear. You'll choose your animal and adjust his abilities. Then, you'll choose his primary hat, which you are presumed to always have. You'll then choose one Perk and one Drawback. One player will not play one primate, but will instead represent the rest of the world. In different games, he has different titles, such as Game Master or Storyteller. In this game, he's the dispatcher, the one responsible for deciding what mission your monkeys will be sent on. He will also monitor the mission to keep you (and the code monkeys back at home base) aware of everything going on. If there's ever a question about what happens, the dispatch will monitor the situation impartially and make the call.<br/><br/>To play this game, you will need some pencils, paper, a few players, some fudge dice (ideally four per player, but we'll talk about how to get around that later), some tokens to represent bananas, and some imagination.<br/><br/>"}, "104959": {"rpgitemversion": {"118136": "PDF Version 0.1-Alpha"}, "poll": {}, "name": "Scavengers", "rpgproducer": {"51331": "Shawn McCarthy"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1066630.png", "usersrated": "0", "average": "0", "statistics": {}, "rpggenre": {"441": "Horror (Supernatural)"}, "rpg": {"11525": "Scavengers"}, "rpgcategory": {"2083": "Core Rules (min needed to play)"}, "rpgseries": {"11334": "2011 RPG Geek 48 Hour RPGs"}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1066630_t.png", "description": "From the Introduction:<br/><br/>In Scavengers, you will assume the role of a Soul unbound by Time and able to bring its current incarnation with where it goes.

Not all the dinosaurs are extinct. In the late Jurassic Era, a species of raptor discovered the ability to communicate with each other through thoughts. Over the centuries, this evolved into a shared-mind consciousness which enabled the raptor brains to exceed the limits placed on the size of their brains. A civilization developed, based on a store of knowledge and the easy to hunt emerging mammals. Tools were developed, the megafauna tended, and species bred to enhance their individual natures. Key to their success was the Ytenn species discovering the ability to control lesser minds. No longer were the raptors hunted by T. Rex or other dinosaurs. Brontosauri were kept like cattle, used for their brute strength or raised for their meat.<br/><br/>The P'tor-ra dominated the landscape for a brief time, however. Just as they began to develop true societies and kingdoms that may have left fossil records, they discovered a massive comet about to smash into the planet. The P'tor-ra put all their efforts into finding away to escape the impending doom. Using controlled dinosaurs and burrowing mammals, massive caverns were tunneled deep underground for the P'tor-ra to hide in. each tunnel was covered with an immense capstone, then marked with a giant pyramid of stone -- perhaps the only structure that would survive the cataclysm and mark their resting place should other saurians seek them out after the cataclysm.<br/><br/><br/>From the Humans Introduction:<br/><br/>The announcement of new chambers found beneath the burial chamber in the Pyramid of Khafre in Giza was met with much excitement. Early reports spoke of an early form of hieroglyphics as yet unknown to archaeologists and pictographs of an early Egyptian creation myth. Within a few days, however, the Egyptian Supreme Council of Antiquities announced the closing of the site to all but one team of renowned archaeologists. No further information about the chambers were released.<br/><br/>Inside the team discovered two rooms. The most interesting one was a circular chamber, uncommon in Egyptian construction, with the unusual hieroglyphs covering every surface and a massive stone circular slab set in the center of the room. The room was undoubtedly older than the Pyramid itself, but lack of material prevented any radio-isotope dating. The outer room seemed to be of later design, contemporary with the pyramids. It appeared to detail the discovery of the circular chamber and a translation of the strange writing within it. Those who have studied it have described the carvings as the &quot;Myth of the P'tor-ra&quot;, that came before mankind.<br/><br/>"}, "104961": {"rpg": {"11527": "of Knights Glory"}, "poll": {}, "name": "of Knights Glory", "rpgproducer": {"8877": "Felbrigg Herriot"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1066766.jpg", "usersrated": "0", "rpgitemversion": {"118138": "PDF Version"}, "average": "0", "statistics": {}, "rpggenre": {"159": "Fantasy (Arthurian)"}, "rpgcategory": {"2083": "Core Rules (min needed to play)"}, "rpgseries": {"11334": "2011 RPG Geek 48 Hour RPGs"}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1066766_t.jpg", "description": "From the Introduction:<br/><br/>This document encompasses a story telling game, whereby you the players will work together, and at times against each other to tell a noble story of Knights battling against evil in the land.<br/><br/>This game will present you with a starting point, and each player will add to the story as it becomes their turn, Each player will be telling the part of one of King Arthur's knights, the goal being the defeat of the evil monster of the deep, or some other evil.

Their main purpose is to increase the standard of living, and thus the happiness of its citizens. They have within reach a whole range of projects that the city council wants to achieve, but which lack the funds. By skillfully selecting plans, using available space and deciding which projects their money should be spent on they will be expanding the city and competing for the title of the most people-friendly company.<br/><br/>During play, the game board is expanded by players laying down tiles, with each tile representing a piece of the city, a district that might need to be provided with electricity or water in exchange for receiving some benefit. Some of the tiles require a supply of luxury goods; others generate them; others give only points of happiness, such as the hospital.<br/><br/>Resources are common, and each of them can be bought by players from power stations and waterworks. These resources, however, are not unlimited and their use must be well planned. Keep in mind, too, that you must pay opponents when transporting raw materials through districts they own.<br/><br/>Game play in City Tycoon passes through four stages, and in each of them the buildings get larger and more impressive while at the same time requiring more resources and giving better benefits. Players quickly notice the relations between them and may choose several possible strategies to develop their investments, for example, focusing on making money, constructing scoring buildings to the exclusion of all else. Each of these strategies has its pluses and minuses, and the actions of other players might force you to expand in new directions and change your tactic.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": {"157906": "German second edition"}, "name": "City Tycoon", "playingtime": "120", "boardgamemechanic": {"2041": "Card Drafting"}, "average": "6.58849", "usersrated": "862", "boardgamesubdomain": {"5497": "Strategy Games"}, "age": "10"}, "104995": {"statistics": {}, "name": "Scotland Yard", "videogamemode": {"2422": "Local Multiplayer"}, "videogameversion": {"118194": "EU Windows"}, "average": "5.125", "videogametheme": {"2403": "Board Game"}, "usersrated": "2", "videogamegenre": {"2155": "RPG"}, "videogameplatform": {"4977": "Windows"}, "poll": {}, "description": "User summary:<br/><br/>Scotland Yard is a faithful computer version of the popular board game of the same name, developed by Cryo in collaboration with Ravensburger (publisher of the board game): Mr. X, a fixture on England's &quot;Most Wanted&quot; list, is on the run in London. Will Scotland Yard find and capture him before time runs out?<br/><br/>The main map shows 199 stations in the city that can be reached by taxi, bus or underground. Each type of transportation costs a ticket. One player takes the part of Mr. X and slinks around the city, leaving clues for the others, who are the Scotland Yard detective team. If Mr. X manages to escape capture, he/she wins. All the detectives see is which travel ticket Mr. X used during that turn. The detectives must plan movement routes to surround Mr. X and try to cut off his lines of escape. To make things difficult for the detectives, they only have a limited number of tickets, and when they run out of a ticket type, they cannot use that mode of transport anymore.<br/><br/>As a &lsquo;bonus&rsquo;, you can choose to play the &quot;computer enhanced&quot; version, which purports to add RPG elements such as money, weapons, fighting, health and conversation. The players can visit the stations and interact with people or locations. Detectives have to catch criminals in order to earn money so they can buy information about Mr. X. Mr. X has to find specific items in order to win. He can rob people or houses to earn money. Weapons, tickets and other helpful things can be bought at different locations. A lot of people offer information for a price. Only a gang boss of a district can sell Mr. X pricey information about the quest item. But to find the gang boss you need to buy information about his whereabouts first.<br/><br/>Overall, Scotland Yard is a game that emphasises logical deductions and strategic planning over luck. You can play either as Mr. X or detective, solo against the computer or with friends.<br/><br/>"}, "104996": {"rpg": {"2979": "Edge of Midnight"}, "statistics": {}, "name": "The Edge of Midnight GM's Screen", "rpgproducer": {"13985": "Rob Vaux"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1066861.png", "usersrated": "0", "rpgitemversion": {"118198": "PDF version"}, "average": "0", "rpggenre": {"178": "Crime (Mystery / Detective / Noir)"}, "rpgcategory": {"2086": "Accessory (dice, maps, screens, cards)"}, "poll": {}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1066861_t.png", "description": "From publisher blurb:<br/><br/>This handsome GM&rsquo;s screen gives the Game Master everything he needs to run an exciting Edge of Midnight game right at his fingertips.
