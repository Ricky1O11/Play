Unseen enemies were everywhere: from devilish rock-and-roll music to morally-corrupt books such as Lolita and Catcher in the Rye. Comic-books corrupted the minds of our youths, and godless Communists constituted a red menace to be stopped using any means necessary.<br/><br/>Atomic-Age Cthulhu brings Lovecraftian horror roleplaying into the post-war golden age. Here you find background and history that led to the development of the 1950s world, along with new skills and professions for your investigators. A number of Sinister Seeds are included to help you grow your own &lsquo;50s horrors, but seven complete adventures are ready for you to spring on your unsuspecting players.<br/>The scenarios included in the book are:<br/><br/>This Village was Made for Us by Christopher Smith Adair &ndash; In a closed community devoted to exploring the new found wonders of the atomic age, alien horrors conduct their own experiments and our well-being does not factor into their calculations.<br/><br/>T.V. Casualty by Matt Sanborn &ndash; Television: newfangled technological wonder, or dreaded idiot box looking to enslave us all? Could the answer to both questions be yes?<br/><br/>The Return of Old Reliable by Oscar Rios &ndash; The space race, still in its infancy, gives birth to a world-threatening horror no one could have seen coming.<br/><br/>Forgotten Wars by Brian M. Sammons &ndash; The Korean &ldquo;conflict&rdquo;, never formally classified as a war, and yet technically still underway today, pales in comparison to the aeons long battle between two ancient enemies, and a US Army tank crew gets caught in the middle.<br/><br/>High Octane by Tom Lynch &ndash; Slick hot rods, dirty and dangerous bikers, a commie plot, and a once slumbering menace starting to stir.  Will the investigators be able to keep the lid on this pressure cooker or are things going to blow as the fear continues to mount?<br/><br/>L.A. Diabolical by Brian Courtemanche &ndash; It&rsquo;s Tinsel Town and the rich and famous want to dabble with the chic side of darkness for kicks, but when something from the darkness starts playing with them, the fun quickly ends.<br/><br/>Destroying Paradise, Hawaiian Style by Michael Dziesinski &ndash; Blue skies, loud shirts, surfing and a king of rock n&rsquo; roll making a movie, what could possible go wrong? Well when the horrors of the Cthulhu Mythos combine with the horror of nuclear weapons, what do you think?<br/><br/>"}, "104681": {"poll": [], "name": "Robo Dude", "videogamemode": ["Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["iPad edition", "Macintosh edition"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1067121.png", "videogametheme": ["Science Fiction"], "usersrated": "0", "videogamedeveloper": ["Magic Games (II)"], "videogamegenre": ["Arcade"], "videogameplatform": ["iPad", "Macintosh"], "average": "0", "statistics": [], "videogamepublisher": ["Magic Games (II)"], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1067121_t.png", "description": "Robodude is a challenging brick breaker game in which you will gain control over the pad to destroy the bricks that stand between you and your advancement to the higher levels.

Ever since the Egyptian priest Imhotep unwittingly allowed the Red Death access to the world, it has insidiously spread across Gothic Earth to corrupt and pervert every land and every culture like a malignant cancer. It has radiated from its point of entry on the coat tails of human history and discovery, never far behind wherever and whenever mankind steps for the first time. It invariably leaves its mark on everything pure and innocent it comes across, and leaves in its wake a foul trail of corruption.<br/><br/>Crossroads of the Gothic Earth is an atlas of some of the lesser known corners and crevices of Gothic Earth that the Red Death has managed to find and corrupt. It contains some of the smaller human settlements that might have been overlooked by the adepts and scholars in their works of Forbidden Lore, but nonetheless have come to the attention of the Red Death and its minions. In addition to settled habitations, it contains geographical features and landmarks that have also in some way been touched by the malignant hand of the Red Death.<br/><br/>The greatest weapon for fighting the Red Death and its minions is knowledge. This atlas attempts to fill in some of the gaps to make the fight a little easier for the champions of all that is good.<br/><br/>"}, "104727": {"rpgartist": ["(Uncredited)"], "rpgitemversion": ["PDF version"], "poll": [], "name": "The Forgotten Children", "rpgdesigner": ["Matthew Ball", "Joe Bardales", "Bil Boozer", "Andrew Cermak", "Jeremy W.

It was not billed as a computer version of Squad Leader, though it did bear some similarities in that players commanded roughly company sized forces. Only three maps were available for play. The game was released for Apple II, Commodore 64, and DOS systems. The game was unique (and rather unsatisfying to many) in that for each of the nine scenarios, victory was not declared at game's end. A results screen would show losses in men and equipment, and list possession of objectives, leaving the determination of &quot;victory&quot; to the player. Like the original Squad Leader board game, German, Russian and American nationalities were represented. Unlike earlier attempts at computerized tactical combat simulations (notably Dniepr River Line, also by Avalon Hill, which included a physical copy of Squad Leader's board 3 and cardboard counters which were necessary for gameplay), the computer tracked the movement and position of all units as well as handling all computations for sighting and combat resolution. (Some computer games, notably those by Simulations Canada, were being sold at that time with either a physical mapboard and game pieces that the player had to use to manually track movement and position, or even plastic covered maps and grease pencils).<br/><br/>Initial packaging had the name of the designer, Ralph H. Bosson, over the title on the box front so as to read Ralph Bosson's UNDER FIRE!, but subsequent packaging replaced his name and read Avalon Hill's UNDER FIRE! instead.<br/><br/>An Extended Capabilities Disk was sold by Avalon Hill also, adding 56 more US, German and Russian assault guns and tanks to the game, as well as providing Japanese, British and Italian forces, with two additional maps and six more scenarios.<br/><br/>A Second Extended Capabilities Disk was also sold, bringing a campaign layer to the game, increasing the speed of play, and making use of 64K of additional memory (where available).<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;Avalon Hill's UNDER FIRE&quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>Game By Ralph Bosson<br/><br/>"}, "104824": {"poll": [], "name": "Timecop", "videogamemode": ["Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["SNES edition"], "average": "3", "videogametheme": ["Historical", "Science Fiction"], "usersrated": "1", "videogamedeveloper": ["Victor Interactive Software"], "videogamegenre": ["Action", "Platform"], "videogameplatform": ["SNES"], "statistics": [], "videogamepublisher": ["Cryo Interactive Entertainment"], "description": "Timecop (\u30bf\u30a4\u30e0\u30b3\u30c3\u30d7) is a Super Nintendo Entertainment System video game that is based on the movie of the same name.

It parallels the real world in thought, but is an adaptation of our own minds. Within this world of steam, gasoline is volatile liquid that is frowned upon as highly explosive. Cars use &quot;steamplug&quot; technology, ships scope water to refill their boilers and aeroplanes harvest clouds for quick refills as well. Think of a world that never went to gasoline, but instead increased their technology level in steam ten-fold. This is the world you will create your character and adventure into. This is a world where Diabolical Maniacs, Mad Doctors, and Underworld Mobsters threaten the very framework of life. If you believe you can fill the shoes of a noir hero, then this steam world is for you.<br/><br/>Powered by the Realistic Advanced Roleplaying Engine (RARE System) used by Broken Swords & Battered Shields, this all-in-one book provides a flexible system and an immersive world that allows Narrators and players to dive in without any extra supplementary books.

ROLEPLAYING MECHANICS. Characters in TSF all possess a Good, Neutral, and Evil trait, one of which dominates depending on the PC&rsquo;s alignment, but the other two exist within the character as well, and come out from time to time. Players gain Energy Points for roleplaying their characters, whether choosing to follow or go against their alignment (and its associated trait, for example a Good character following his self-sacrificing Good trait, or a Good character instead acting out his greedy Evil trait). Whichever they choose, they tick one space along the spectrum toward Good, Neutral, or Evil, depending on the morality of the action taken. Lawful, Neutral, and Chaotic represent the Stability of the character, i.e., how often they stick to or diverge from their alignment and its associated trait.<br/><br/>In addition, each Ability score comes with an associated Descriptor. For example, Strength ranges from Feeble to Mighty, while Intellect ranges from Moronic to Brilliant. These Descriptors can also be used to gain Energy Points. A Reckless or Foolhardy PC might charge into battle at an inopportune time or pull a lever before the party has decided whether it seems like a beneficial course of action. Just an attempt at roleplaying either a Trait or a Descriptor earns the PC Energy Points &mdash; they don&rsquo;t have to succeed at the action.<br/><br/>2. ENERGY POINTS. Exploration, battle, spellcasting, and other elements of the game can be enhanced by spending Energy Points, a pool of energy for each PC that starts out at maximum at the beginning of a new day. Characters can earn extra Energy Points (even above and beyond their starting level for the day) by roleplaying. Energy Points can be used in any way allowed by the MC (aka, Master Creator, TSFs version of &quot;GM&quot;) to accomplish Special Effects. A few examples of Special Effects include: pinning an opponent, knocking-out a combatant, re-casting a prayer previously cast, swapping out a spell for one of equal or lower level, moving overland at double-speed, inflicting extra damage on a successful hit, and so on broken into major categories of Exploration, Weapon Attacks, and Spellcasting. The only caveat is that the player MUST explain how his or her character is accomplishing this effect in a realistic way given the current situation. The MC is the final arbiter of what is possible in the game world. For example, a thief wants to pin a gnoll to a stone stelae during a battle in a Stonehenge-type ruin; unless the dagger being used is magical, it defies the logic/physics of the game world for the dagger to pass through the gnoll and dig into the stone deep enough to pin the Gnoll. If the thief were to knock the gnoll down and pin it to the hard ground with the dagger, the MC would most likely allow it. There are limits to how many Special Effects can be used per attack, of course, and when PCs run out of Energy Points, they can always engage in additional roleplaying to earn more.<br/><br/>3. WOUND LEVELS. THE SECRET FIRE uses a combination of hits (or hit points) and Wound Levels from other games, including INDIANA JONES (D6), THE STAR WARS ROLEPLAYING: REVISED &amp; EXPANDED (D6), and the D6 SYSTEM RULEBOOK, with a few major changes. At each of the five levels &mdash; Grazed, Hurt, Wounded, Messed Up, At Death&rsquo;s Door &mdash; the PC suffers some effect, either positive, negative, or both. For example, a +1 to attacks at the Hurt Wound Level, or a critical success on a natural 15-20 or a critical failure on a natural 1-5 at the Messed Up level, bearing in mind, that like all things in TSF, everything stacks. Which segues nicely to:<br/><br/>4. EVERYTHING STACKS! Enough said. No looking up, figuring out, arguing over, etc. Everything stacks.<br/><br/>5. NARRATIVE VS. NUMERICAL STYLE. Players use codewords that represent numerical values to make the entire game, including and especially battles, more immersive.<br/><br/>EXAMPLE 1 (WITH ATTACKER SPENDING ENERGY POINTS): Dave shouts out, &quot;Using my muscular strength, I slash at the Goblin with my longsword Garm&rsquo;s Tooth, landing a serious blow for 10 points of damage! I finish the attack by slamming my shoulder into the Goblin&rsquo;s chest, knocking it to the ground!&quot;<br/><br/>EXAMPLE 2 (A PLAYERS RESPONDS TO A SPELL ATTACK): Scott says, &quot;My anti-magic utterly fails to absorb the evil wizard&rsquo;s rain of fire, dropping me to death&rsquo;s door!&quot;<br/><br/>All players at the table understand what these phrases/code-words mean and are encouraged to embellish and create entirely new ways of expressing them along with the MC.<br/><br/>6. SANDBOX-STYLE, I.E., NOT NICELY BALANCED FOR YOUR PARTY. The world is the world. Parties may encounter easy obstacles they can overcome in seconds or impossible obstacles that will instantly destroy every member of the group. PCs must take care to figure out which is which and to attempt other strategies before engaging everything in battle, including parley and flight. This is a game of exploration and danger. (As a related tangent, the vast amount of experience points earned by PCs come from gaining treasures and accomplishing quests, with a few points received for defeating or successfully parleying with monsters).<br/><br/>7. RESISTANCES VS. SAVING THROWS/DEFENSES. All attacks are made against an opponent&rsquo;s Dodge score. All damage, however, is rolled against the opponent&rsquo;s Resistance score based on the type of attack. For example, a sword thrust hits a ghoul (i.e., hitting its Dodge) and the damage taken is determined by subtracting the ghoul&rsquo;s Armor Resistance (which absorbs the blow) from the sword&rsquo;s damage roll, with a minimum of 1 damage. Other Resistances include Anti-Magic vs. Paralyzation, Dragon Breath, Spells; Endurance vs. Poison, Petrification, Death Magic; and Willpower vs. Charm, Psychic Assault, Prayers.<br/><br/>8. THE ELDER GODS &amp; THE CHARACTER WHEEL. The Character Wheel or Mosaic at the center of THE SECRET FIRE character sheet becomes filled in with different colors based on the types of encounters the PC finds himself or herself facing over his or her adventuring lifetime. Other players can just glance at another PC&rsquo;s Character Wheel to get a sense of that PC&rsquo;s life up to this point, just like you can get a vibe about someone just by looking at them or spending time with them. The Elder Gods are five primordial &quot;forces&quot; representing positive and negative aspects of their areas of power. They can be called upon for succor &ndash; but players who do so find themselves owing them a favor that may called in at the worst possible time. There are also Deities in the world worshipped by the masses who are in turn led by Holy-Men and Holy-Women acting as the representatives of these Deities in the world. Deities and Elder Gods are NOT the same. Deities themselves would quiver in the presence of an Elder God. The Elder Gods come into play in other ways, as well, but those remain the purview of the MC and will not be discussed here for they should remain a secret from the players (one of the benefits of being the MC)&hellip;<br/><br/>9. UNIQUE TALISMANS. Everyone talisman (aka magic item) is a unique item, complete with special adornments, qualities, name, and history, in addition to any (relatively simple) magical abilities. Tables help MCs develop and design these items, plus pre-generated items can be selected and used immediately.<br/><br/>10. GYGAX&rsquo;S VISION FOR THE FUTURE. As Gail Gygax has mentioned on her Facebook page, a screenwriter is currently writing a movie based on Gary&rsquo;s life using Gary&rsquo;s unpublished works and various writings about himself from his diaries and his ideas for gaming from his first thoughts about creating RPGs through this last days on this earth from his notebooks. The name of the screenwriter has not been revealed, but he has in his possession the inner thoughts of Gary Gygax on many things, especially his vision for the future of gaming, which happens to be the same as my own sensibilities.<br/><br/>11. SIMILARITIES &amp; ADDITIONAL CHANGES. TSF has Ability scores, equipment, attack charts,increasing rather than decreasing Dodge score (i.e., higher is better), a unique skill system which requires a PC to roll their Ability score or under to accomplish a task on a number of six-sided dice, with that number of dice based on the difficulty of the task in question (though PCs Trained in a particular skill get to roll one die less when making the roll). Plus, a Montage System allows the MC and players to move through long periods of game-world time very quickly with interesting and randomized results.<br/><br/>12. IMMEDIATE TECHNOLOGY. THE SECRET FIRE will also have a look-up app that DOESN&rsquo;T require an internet connection (since all data will be stored locally on your mobile device, thereby making the app faster as an added benefit) available for a ONE-TIME price on the DAY the game is released, unlike other gaming companies. More apps and in-app purchases will become available for sale, but none are required to play and you don&rsquo;t have to sign up for an ongoing subscription.<br/><br/>To sum up, THE SECRET FIRE is a fast, flexible, and familiar yet unique fantasy roleplaying game that focuses on immersion, substituting words for numbers whenever possible, putting you at the heart of the experience.<br/><br/>"}, "104891": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1065787.jpg", "poll": [], "boardgamedesigner": ["Mike Elliott"], "statistics": [], "yearpublished": "2011", "maxplayers": "5", "boardgameartist": ["Jason Engle", "Brent Keith", "Hal Mangold"], "boardgamepublisher": ["Alderac Entertainment Group (AEG)", "Arclight", "Pegasus Spiele"], "maxplaytime": "60", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1065787_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "60", "boardgamecategory": ["Card Game", "Expansion for Base-game", "Fantasy"], "description": "Thunderstone: Heart of Doom brings the struggle introduced in Thunderstone to an epic climax.

Intended to promote intelligent discussion and debate about a myriad of topics, CARD-tamen consists of decks of CARDs (Classical Attunement Reward Devices) organized around particular themes.<br/><br/>GamePlay: Players shuffle their decks and deal themselves seven CARDs at random. Players have two minutes to provide the most compelling argument as to why their chosen CARD wins a controversy selected by a d20 roll from a list provided with the game. The player who rolls the die to choose the controversy also makes the first argument. An independent iudex (judge) determines whose argument is more compelling. That player is awarded a point. The first player to three points is the winner of CARD-tamen&trade;.<br/><br/>There are also rule variants for 3+ players and integration into the practomimetic Latin curriculum, Operation LAPIS.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": ["First Edition"], "age": "12", "name": "CARD-tamen Rome", "playingtime": "30", "boardgamemechanic": ["Storytelling"], "average": "0", "usersrated": "0", "boardgamefamily": ["Ancient Rome"]}, "104902": {"poll": [], "name": "Troggu", "playingtime": "0", "minplayers": "0", "boardgamemechanic": ["Trick-taking"], "yearpublished": "0", "usersrated": "0", "maxplayers": "0", "boardgamefamily": ["Tarot Games"], "average": "0", "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["(Public Domain)"], "boardgameversion": ["Public Domain"], "maxplaytime": "0", "boardgamecategory": ["Card Game"], "age": "0", "minplaytime": "0", "description": "Troggu, also known as Trogga or Tapp&auml;, is a form of Tarot played in a few villages in the German speaking part of canton Wallis in Switzerland (from pagat).<br/><br/>It is a must-follow, must-trump trick taking that can be played by 3-8 players.

Our team of monkeys come with bio-mechanical neural interfaces to give them the skills they need to complete any mission. This not only allows our monkeys to understand both written and spoken language, it also allows them to learn valuable skills based on the hats they equip themselves with. To have Helper Monkeys solve your problem, simply log on, describe the nature of your problem in 140 characters or less (we do accept tweets), and our code monkeys will trace you down and send a top team of gorillas, chimpanzees, orangutans, and other simians to help you!

Each player takes on the role of a primate cybernetically enhanced to possess certain skills based on the specially prepared hats they wear. You'll choose your animal and adjust his abilities. Then, you'll choose his primary hat, which you are presumed to always have. You'll then choose one Perk and one Drawback. One player will not play one primate, but will instead represent the rest of the world. In different games, he has different titles, such as Game Master or Storyteller. In this game, he's the dispatcher, the one responsible for deciding what mission your monkeys will be sent on. He will also monitor the mission to keep you (and the code monkeys back at home base) aware of everything going on. If there's ever a question about what happens, the dispatch will monitor the situation impartially and make the call.<br/><br/>To play this game, you will need some pencils, paper, a few players, some fudge dice (ideally four per player, but we'll talk about how to get around that later), some tokens to represent bananas, and some imagination.<br/><br/>"}, "104959": {"rpgartist": ["Pirosca Marcel"], "rpgitemversion": ["PDF Version 0.1-Alpha"], "poll": [], "name": "Scavengers", "rpgdesigner": ["Shawn McCarthy"], "rpgproducer": ["Shawn McCarthy"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1066630.png", "usersrated": "0", "average": "0", "statistics": [], "rpggenre": ["Horror (Supernatural)", "Science Fiction (Time / Dimension Travel)"], "rpgpublisher": ["(Web published)"], "rpg": ["Scavengers"], "rpgcategory": ["Core Rules (min needed to play)"], "rpgseries": ["2011 RPG Geek 48 Hour RPGs"], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1066630_t.png", "description": "From the Introduction:<br/><br/>In Scavengers, you will assume the role of a Soul unbound by Time and able to bring its current incarnation with where it goes.

Not all the dinosaurs are extinct. In the late Jurassic Era, a species of raptor discovered the ability to communicate with each other through thoughts. Over the centuries, this evolved into a shared-mind consciousness which enabled the raptor brains to exceed the limits placed on the size of their brains. A civilization developed, based on a store of knowledge and the easy to hunt emerging mammals. Tools were developed, the megafauna tended, and species bred to enhance their individual natures. Key to their success was the Ytenn species discovering the ability to control lesser minds. No longer were the raptors hunted by T. Rex or other dinosaurs. Brontosauri were kept like cattle, used for their brute strength or raised for their meat.<br/><br/>The P'tor-ra dominated the landscape for a brief time, however. Just as they began to develop true societies and kingdoms that may have left fossil records, they discovered a massive comet about to smash into the planet. The P'tor-ra put all their efforts into finding away to escape the impending doom. Using controlled dinosaurs and burrowing mammals, massive caverns were tunneled deep underground for the P'tor-ra to hide in. each tunnel was covered with an immense capstone, then marked with a giant pyramid of stone -- perhaps the only structure that would survive the cataclysm and mark their resting place should other saurians seek them out after the cataclysm.<br/><br/><br/>From the Humans Introduction:<br/><br/>The announcement of new chambers found beneath the burial chamber in the Pyramid of Khafre in Giza was met with much excitement. Early reports spoke of an early form of hieroglyphics as yet unknown to archaeologists and pictographs of an early Egyptian creation myth. Within a few days, however, the Egyptian Supreme Council of Antiquities announced the closing of the site to all but one team of renowned archaeologists. No further information about the chambers were released.<br/><br/>Inside the team discovered two rooms. The most interesting one was a circular chamber, uncommon in Egyptian construction, with the unusual hieroglyphs covering every surface and a massive stone circular slab set in the center of the room. The room was undoubtedly older than the Pyramid itself, but lack of material prevented any radio-isotope dating. The outer room seemed to be of later design, contemporary with the pyramids. It appeared to detail the discovery of the circular chamber and a translation of the strange writing within it. Those who have studied it have described the carvings as the &quot;Myth of the P'tor-ra&quot;, that came before mankind.<br/><br/>"}, "104961": {"rpgartist": ["Chris Hartford (UK)", "Lee Hawkins", "W.

The job of progressing the game and ruling on conflicts falls to everyone participating in the game - the players police their own challenges and conflicts. At the start of the game, the participants create their characters, define the organizations they work for, and set a starting point. Then, using the rules, contained herein, and a process of action and counter-action, rumour and rebuttal, the game progresses towards a conclusion.<br/><br/>Inch&sup2; should be played as a game of storytelling conflicts, with a fair and practical approach advancing toward a conclusion. Players should use their imagination to weave threads of association between the start and close of their conspiracy and, effectively, role-play the figurehead of the organisation they create. Without storytelling, the game could easily become a string of bets and dice rolls, which certainly is not the intent by any measure.<br/><br/>"}, "104965": {"rpgartist": ["Manolo Carot", "Alex Fernandez (I)", "Emilio Fradejas", "Albert Monteys"], "statistics": [], "name": "L\u00edder (15 Aniversario - Especial M\u00f3dulos)", "rpgdesigner": ["Samuel Rubio", "Fabi\u00e1n V\u00e1zquez"], "rpgproducer": ["Eduard Garc\u00eda"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1078482.jpg", "usersrated": "1", "average": "7", "rpgissue": ["L\u00edder"], "rpg": ["Aquelarre (2nd Edition)", "Call of Cthulhu (2nd - 6th Edition)", "Deadlands (Original Edition)", "Dungeons & Dragons (3.5 Edition)", "Fanhunter", "In Nomine Satanis / Magna Veritas (2nd Edition)", "James Bond 007", "Middle-earth Role Playing (1st & 2nd Editions)", "Nephilim (French RPG, Premi\u00e8re \u00c9dition)", "Paranoia (2nd Edition)", "RuneQuest (1st & 2nd Editions)", "Star Wars (Saga)", "Stormbringer (1st, 2nd and 3rd Editions)", "Superheroes INC", "Traveller (Classic)", "Vampire: The Dark Ages", "Vampire: The Masquerade"], "rpgpublisher": ["La Caja de Pandora"], "rpgissueversion": ["15 Aniversario: Especial M\u00f3dulos"], "poll": [], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1078482_t.jpg", "description": "Spanish L&iacute;der Magazine Special 15th Aniversary<br/><br/>Summary:<br/><br/>&quot;James Bond 007 - Operaci&oacute;n Rompehielos<br/>Fanhunter - Por fin ya es viernes<br/>Paranoia - El Anillo Comunista<br/>Vampiro: la Mascarada - Hermanos de Sangre<br/>SuperH&eacute;roes Inc. - Misi&oacute;n Lunar<br/>Vampiro: Edad Oscura - El Veterano de Hattin<br/>El Se&ntilde;or de los Anillos - Tharnefuin<br/>Deadlands - Camino de Abilene<br/>La Llamada de Cthulhu - La bestia no debe nacer<br/>In Nomine Satanis - El Predicador<br/>Magna Veritas - La vida es como una caja de bombones<br/>Dungeons &amp; Dragons - El Ducado de Sparkguard<br/>Aquelarre - El despertar de la Bestia<br/>Stormbringer - El &Uacute;ltimo sue&ntilde;o de Erael<br/>RuneQuest - Asuntos de familia<br/>Nephilim - El nombre de la Rosa<br/>Traveller - Asunto de Comercio<br/>Star Wars - El camino del Jedi&quot;<br/><br/>"}, "104966": {"rpgartist": ["Nicu Buculei", "mcol", "Bryan Nielsen", "Benji Park", "Maurizio Stagni"], "rpg": ["Monkey Bomb Squad"], "poll": [], "name": "Monkey Bomb Squad", "rpgdesigner": ["Steve Donohue"], "rpgproducer": ["Steve Donohue"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1066651.png", "usersrated": "1", "rpgitemversion": ["PDF Version"], "average": "5", "statistics": [], "rpggenre": ["Action / Adventure", "Animal (Anthropomorphic)", "Crime (Criminal / Law Enforcement)"], "rpgpublisher": ["(Web published)"], "rpgcategory": ["Core Rules (min needed to play)"], "rpgseries": ["2011 RPG Geek 48 Hour RPGs"], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1066651_t.png", "description": "From the Introduction:<br/><br/>In the modern world, terrorism has escalated and now our most precious resource is the bomb disposal technician.

Chameleons consider themselves connoisseurs of fine art and specialize in the theft of rare statues, paintings, drawings, and other such works.<br/><br/>The Chameleon guild has existed for centuries without being uncovered in any serious way by any sort of law enforcement agency. Though individual Chameleons may occasionally be captured and interrogated, their secrets continue to remain uncovered - possibly because they blend into their surroundings and hide in plain sight, making them difficult to uncover as an organization.<br/><br/>Being invited to become a Chameleon is an honor extended only to those thieves who are exemplary and exhibit mastery of their craft; amateurs are too easily spotted and captured, making them a risk to the organization.

The aerial war is conducted using fighters, (at first piston-powered and in later stages jet fighters), attack aircraft, torpedo bombers and strategic bombers. There are different types of units, all carefully modeled from WWII-era aircraft and ships, in the game. Also, you can develop new technologies and create new weapons systems, which may almost instantly overturn the global balance of power. About 100 technological improvements, (upgrades), enhancing combat effectiveness of warships and military aircraft are available. In addition to the strategic mode with its 127 different Pacific zones and 40 naval bases, you can play 20 historical battles, including the Battle of Midway, the attack on the Japanese admiral Yamamoto's plane, and the battle for Guadalcanal.<br/><br/>Pacific Storm is all about battleships and aircraft carriers &quot;the giants of naval warfare during WWII&quot;, about captains and admirals, as well as rank-and-file soldiers and sailors of the two great military powers locked in a life-and-death conflict.

Each type of transportation costs a ticket. One player takes the part of Mr. X and slinks around the city, leaving clues for the others, who are the Scotland Yard detective team. If Mr. X manages to escape capture, he/she wins. All the detectives see is which travel ticket Mr. X used during that turn. The detectives must plan movement routes to surround Mr. X and try to cut off his lines of escape. To make things difficult for the detectives, they only have a limited number of tickets, and when they run out of a ticket type, they cannot use that mode of transport anymore.<br/><br/>As a &lsquo;bonus&rsquo;, you can choose to play the &quot;computer enhanced&quot; version, which purports to add RPG elements such as money, weapons, fighting, health and conversation. The players can visit the stations and interact with people or locations. Detectives have to catch criminals in order to earn money so they can buy information about Mr. X. Mr. X has to find specific items in order to win. He can rob people or houses to earn money. Weapons, tickets and other helpful things can be bought at different locations.
