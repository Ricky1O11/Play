Gems can be attached and detached from armor and weapons that have special gem slots.&quot;<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;Monster_Hunter_2,&quot; available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "70017": {"statistics": {}, "name": "Monster Hunter Tri", "videogamemode": {"2313": "Cooperative"}, "videogameversion": {"69746": "Australian Wii edition"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic823450.jpg", "videogameseries": {"5037": "Monster Hunter (Core Series)"}, "videogametheme": {"2148": "Fantasy"}, "videogamefranchise": {"18004": "Monster Hunter"}, "videogamecharacter": {"17994": "Altaroth"}, "usersrated": "55", "average": "7.20727", "videogamegenre": {"2339": "Action RPG"}, "videogameplatform": {"4441": "Wii"}, "videogamehonor": {"30859": "2009 Gamescom Best Nintendo Console Game of the Year Nominee"}, "poll": {}, "vgcharacterversion": {"161900": "Altaroth"}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic823450_t.jpg", "description": "Monster Hunter Tri (or Monster Hunter 3 depending upon region and edition) is the third instalment in Capcom's Monster Hunter series.<br/><br/>Originally Tri was announced for release on the Playstation 3, but high production costs resulted in Capcom turning to Nintendo's Wii as a cheaper alternative, and Tri was eventually released between August 2009 and April 2010 worldwide as a Wii exclusive.<br/><br/>As with previous Monster Hunter releases Tri is an Action Fantasy RPG in which the player takes control of a heroic hunter who must progress through the game via hunting and fighting a number of progressively larger and more fearsome monsters.<br/><br/>This third instalment in the series adds a few new features not seen in previous Monster Hunter games, including swimming, underwater areas and monsters, as well as the Switchaxe- a new duel weapon type. Armour can also now be upgraded and improved rather then just replaced with the next best set. Lastly is the ability to 'Free-Hunt' in the games starting environment without a time limit or a penalty for being knocked out. As you progress and slay larger monsters the free-hunt environment becomes more dangerous, as previously slain large monsters will appear 'in the wild'.<br/><br/>Monster Hunter Tri does have a two player coop option, but consists only of a 'battle mode' in which up to two players can use pre-made sets of equipment to fight a selection of the game's big monsters, many of which must be unlocked from the one player mode before they can be challenged. Tri did support online multiplayer for up to four players upon its release, but unfortunately this service has since been shut down leaving the online part of the game game unplayable.<br/><br/>Monster Hunter Tri has been expanded by Monster Hunter Tri G released for the WiiU and Nintendo 3DS. This upgraded version features new monsters, areas, equipment, weapons and items, as well as some variations on existing elements such as monsters and items encountered in day/night being different and monsters having new moves and sub-species.<br/><br/>"}, "70018": {"boardgamedesigner": {"3": {"name": "(Uncredited)"}}, "poll": {}, "name": "Bonehead", "playingtime": "0", "minplayers": "3", "yearpublished": "2008", "usersrated": "5", "maxplayers": "6", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1204931_t.jpg", "average": "5.8", "statistics": {}, "boardgamepublisher": {"527": {"name": "TDC Games, Inc."}}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1204931.jpg", "boardgameversion": {"32494": "First edition"}, "maxplaytime": "0", "boardgamecategory": {"1079": {"name": "Humor"}}, "age": "12", "minplaytime": "0", "description": "The goal in Bone Head is to draw cards with proposed choices and vote for the worst way to handle them.

It also has two difficulty modes, which are Easy and Normal. The player does not need to erase the game and start over for any reason whatsoever. It is optional to go back to an earlier chapter or verse if the player has missed something. In Drakengard the dragon gains greater attack power as it gains experience and levels up. At certain points of the story the dragon evolves into a different, more powerful form, which enhances the dragons attack powers, magical attacks and allows to lock on to more enemies.<br/><br/>Drakengard is divided into chapters and subdivided into verses. Missions numbered with Roman numerals lead to endings other than the one merited in Chapter 8, and can only be played if the player meets certain requirements.

It is the first game in the Fatal Frame series.<br/><br/>The game revolves around the female protagonist, Miku Hinasaki, and progresses through four chapters (or &quot;Nights&quot;). As a result, players control her for most of the game except for the intro chapter, in which Mafuyu is a controllable character. The characters' strength is displayed in a life bar located in the lower left corner of the screen, and the game will end if the character's strength is drained completely. However, the character can find healing items throughout the progress of the game at different locations, which restore their strength to a certain extent. Plus, a special item called a Stone Mirror can be obtained by Miku in some parts of the game, which completely restores her strength automatically one time only if her strength bar is completely depleted. Miku and Mafuyu also have a flashlight to aid them in the exploration of the haunted mansion.<br/><br/>Miku's only weapon is the Camera Obscura, an antique camera passed down from her mother, which has the ability to damage and capture spirits. However, the camera also relies on &quot;ammunition&quot; - films, which prepare a certain amount of shots for the character. There are different types of films scattered throughout the mansion, and each type of film possesses a different strength. The camera also contains several special abilities, which must be unlocked using spirit points, which can be gained by capturing ghosts. These abilities, such as Paralyze and See, can aid Miku in fighting spirits that have different attacking patterns to the standard ghosts. During the game, Miku must explore the entire mansion and its grounds, and must obtain certain objects and solve puzzles in order to progress through sections of the game. During this time, Miku will encounter different types of spirits, either random or mandatory. Some spirits are friendly and will not attack Miku, but most are hostile. The chapters progress as Miku reaches a particular location, usually after completing a major segment of the chapter.&quot;<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;Fatal_Frame_(video_game),&quot; available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "70022": {"statistics": {}, "name": "Mario Party", "videogamemode": {"2310": "Network Multiplayer"}, "videogameversion": {"32508": "European Nintendo 64 edition"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1118850.jpg", "videogameseries": {"5133": "Mario Party"}, "videogametheme": {"2337": "Cute Fantasy"}, "videogamefranchise": {"4868": "Super Mario"}, "videogamecharacter": {"5171": "Donkey Kong"}, "usersrated": "64", "average": "6.425", "videogamegenre": {"2338": "Party"}, "videogameplatform": {"4836": "Nintendo 64"}, "videogamehonor": {"29641": "2000 D.I.C.E.

When the PlayStation version was released, Atlus USA was considering bringing Soul Hackers to North America, but they were denied by Sony Computer Entertainment America.<br/><br/>A fan translation is currently being made by the same team that made the translation patch for Persona 2: Innocent Sin.&quot;<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;Devil_Summoner:_Soul_Hackers,&quot; available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "70051": {"statistics": {}, "name": "Shin Megami Tensei: Devil Summoner: Raidou Kuzunoha vs. The Soulless Army", "videogamemode": {"2149": "Single-Player"}, "videogameversion": {"32686": "Japanese Playstation 2 edition"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1115865.jpg", "videogameseries": {"4776": "Devil Summoner"}, "usersrated": "6", "videogamefranchise": {"5277": "Megami Tensei"}, "average": "6.66667", "videogamegenre": {"2339": "Action RPG"}, "videogameplatform": {"4434": "PlayStation 2"}, "poll": {}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1115865_t.jpg", "description": "&quot;Shin Megami Tensei: Devil Summoner: Raidou Kuzunoha vs. The Soulless Army (\u30c7\u30d3\u30eb\u30b5\u30de\u30ca\u30fc \u845b\u8449\u30e9\u30a4\u30c9\u30a6\u5bfe\u8d85\u529b\u5175\u56e3, Debiru Saman\u0101: Kuzunoha Raid\u014d tai Ch\u014driki Heidan, literally &quot;Raid\u014d Kuzunoha vs. The Super-Powered Army Corps&quot;) is an action role-playing game in the Megami Tensei franchise published by Atlus for the PlayStation 2 in 2006. It differs from the two previous Devil Summoner titles (and most MegaTen games in general) in having real-time battles and a named protagonist and is first in the entire franchise to be set in the past - specifically the 1920s, wherein it deals with historical figures such as Grigori Rasputin in addition to the MegaTen series' traditional use of real-world mythological figures. Though somewhat criticised for being the shortest of recent Shin Megami Tensei games, it generally received favourable responses from players and reviewers alike.<br/><br/>On July 30, 2008, it was announced that there would be a sequel titled Shin Megami Tensei: Devil Summoner 2: Raidou Kuzunoha vs. King Abaddon. Demon conversations make a comeback as well as Raidou being able to summon two demons simultaneously in battle. The limited edition will be packaged with a new version of Shin Megami Tensei III: Nocturne titled Shin Megami Tensei III: Nocturne Maniax Chronicle Edition in which Raidou will appear. The game was released in Japan on October 23, 2008 and in North America on May 12, 2009.&quot;<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;Shin_Megami_Tensei:_Devil_Summoner:_Raidou_Kuzunoha_vs._The_Soulless_Army,&quot; available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "70052": {"statistics": {}, "name": "Shin Megami Tensei: Devil Summoner 2: Raidou Kuzunoha vs. King Abaddon", "videogamemode": {"2149": "Single-Player"}, "videogameversion": {"32691": "Japanese Playstation 2 edition"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1115884.jpg", "videogameseries": {"4776": "Devil Summoner"}, "videogametheme": {"2278": "Anime"}, "videogamefranchise": {"5277": "Megami Tensei"}, "average": "8", "videogamegenre": {"2339": "Action RPG"}, "videogameplatform": {"4434": "PlayStation 2"}, "usersrated": "6", "poll": {}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1115884_t.jpg", "description": "&quot;Shin Megami Tensei: Devil Summoner 2: Raidou Kuzunoha vs. King Abaddon, simply known as Devil Summoner: Raidou Kuzunoha vs. King Abaddon (\u30c7\u30d3\u30eb\u30b5\u30de\u30ca\u30fc \u845b\u8449\u30e9\u30a4\u30c9\u30a6 \u5bfe \u30a2\u30d0\u30c9\u30f3\u738b, Debiru Saman\u0101 Kuzunoha Raid\u014d tai Abadon \u014c) in Japan, is an action role-playing game in the Megami Tensei franchise.

Though designed for use in the Wilderlands, every monster can find a home elsewhere, and is easily adapted into just about any fantasy campaign setting.<br/><br/>Also included are 16 new treasures, ranging from the least bauble to great and potent (and usually, most dire) relics. Each is tied to the Wilderlands, adding more detail to your Wilderlands campaign, though the histories can readily be altered to suit any campaign.<br/><br/><br/>Monster List<br/><br/><br/>     Angrasinamru (CE 15 HD Large Extraplanar)<br/>     Bat, Giant Vampire (CE 2 HD Medium Magical Beast)<br/>     Beetle, Giant: Burster, Fire, and Razor (N 1 to 3 HD Small Vermin)<br/>     Cait Feall (CE 2 HD Small Magical Beast)<br/>     Cat, Saber-Toothed Tiger (N 7 HD Large Animal)<br/>     Centipede, Giant Wooly (N 6 HD Large Animal)<br/>     Chicken, Dungeon (N 1 or HD Small Animal)<br/>     Glashtyn (NE 7 HD Medium Elemental (Water))<br/>     Gorgosphinx (CE 12 HD Large Magical Beast)<br/>     Gourandrouni (CE 4 HD Medium Shapechanger)<br/>     Gr&agrave;dhcrona&iacute;m (CE 6 HD Medium Undead (Extraordinary))<br/>     Grue (NE 9 HD Medium Extraplanar (Shadowlands))<br/>     Hound of Hades (CE 6 HD Large Extraplanar (Netherworld))<br/>     Imp, Chasm (CE 2 HD Small Elemental (Earth))<br/>     Karcajou (N 1 HD Humanoid)<br/>     Malicorn (NE 2 HD Medium Magical Beast)<br/>     Moppet, Witch&rsquo;s (NE 3 HD Medium Construct)<br/>     Nomgoblin (NE 1 HD Monstrous Humanoid)<br/>     Sloughree (NE 10 HD Large Giant)<br/>     Sprite, Brownie (N 1 HD Fey)<br/>     Sprite, Cr&agrave;igeanetlagh (N 1 HD Small Fey)<br/>     Sprite, Gobling (CE 1 HD Monstrous Humanoid)<br/>     Szaltys (NG 1 HD Small Magical Beast)<br/>     Teknatzou (CE 5 HD Medium Fey)<br/>     Tlahtocelotl (N 1 HD Humanoid)<br/><br/><br/><br/>Treasure List<br/><br/><br/>     Abacus of Instant Calculation<br/>     Beggar&rsquo;s Bindlestick<br/>     Blade Belligerence, The<br/>     Dagger Divine, The<br/>     Demon-Die of the Mandarin-Lords<br/>     Dragon Shield<br/>     Gwyndolyn&rsquo;s Mail<br/>     Hag&rsquo;s Eye<br/>     Icon of the Bloodstained God<br/>     Maed&rsquo;s Walkin&rsquo; Hat<br/>     Peasant Talisman<br/>     Potion of Partial Polymorph<br/>     Power Pearls<br/>     Rune of Protection<br/>     Wand of the Toad Prince<br/>     Zudnak&rsquo;s Finger<br/><br/><br/>"}, "70069": {"rpgitemversion": {"32777": "PDF version"}, "poll": {}, "name": "Martial Artist Class", "rpgproducer": {"15812": "Peter Bradley"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic710242.jpg", "usersrated": "0", "average": "0", "statistics": {}, "rpg": {"509": "Castles & Crusades"}, "rpgcategory": {"2108": "Sourcebook (rules/options to enhance play)"}, "rpggenre": {"961": "Fantasy"}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic710242_t.jpg", "description": "<br/>Publisher's blurb<br/><br/>This PDF features a new class for Castles &amp; Crusades, the Martial Artist, designed as an alternative to the ascetic monk.

Between 1665 and his death in 1680, Riquet was completely anbsorbed by the planning, financing and construction of his canal system.  Sections of it, including the Canal de Garonne, remained unfinished until the 19th century.<br/><br/>You can relive the adventure of building the canal, section by section, between Grisolles and Valence d'Agen in the heart of the Tarn-et-Garonne. Each player is an engineer who must use their best workers to build the greatest length of the Arriala (cannal in the Occitan language of southern France). You can move all workers, but only those on your team will gain you fame points for completing sections. The placement of your workers when construction is completed is critical.  Your aim is to have the most workers on a stretch of canal when it is completed.  Ties are broken in favour of the player placed third. It is also possible to build locks to alter sections of the canal and create new ones. However, the number of points awarded depends on the length of the section: a lock may win you a majority, but at what price?<br/><br/>Points can also be scored for building structures, though this sacrifices a worker (five maximum per player) for the rest of the game. What's more, your expertise also extends to cultivating the  vines that make this region famous and will bring you valuable points when the game ends.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": {"32861": "Multilingual first edition"}, "average": "6.53571", "name": "Arriala: Canal de Garonne", "playingtime": "30", "boardgamemechanic": {"2001": "Action Point Allowance System"}, "age": "8", "boardgameexpansion": {}, "usersrated": "140", "boardgamefamily": {"22783": "Admin: Better Description Needed!"}}, "70098": {"rpgitemversion": {"32875": "Hardcover"}, "statistics": {}, "name": "Monster Coliseum", "rpgproducer": {"4701": "William J.

The game was developed and released by Nintendo. It was published in 1992 for the SNES and in 2009 for the Virtual Console. It uses Mode 7 graphics to create the 3D feel of the game. Characters from the Mario Universe race in karts against each other, using items to get an advantage over the other racers.<br/><br/>The game features 4 game modes, 20 different race tracks and 8 different drivers with unique driving styles (including: Mario, Luigi, Bowser and Donkey Kong jr). <br/>The following modes are present in the game: Grand Prix, Match Race, Time Trial and Battle Mode. <br/>In Grand Prix, the main mode of the game, one or two players can compete in three different speed classes: 50cc, 100cc and an unlockable 150cc. Each class is more difficult as the speed goes up as well as the aggressiveness of the opponents. There are four different cups to choose from: Mushroom Cup, Flower Cup, Star Cup and an unlockable Special Cup. Each cup consists of five tracks. The first four placed drivers in each race receive points for the cup. After four races the gold, silver and bronze is awarded. <br/>In Match Race, two players can race against each other, selecting single races.<br/>In Time Trial, a player can try to beat the best lap and total times for every race track. The times are stored in the card's battery backed memory.<br/>In Battle Mode, two players compete against each other trying to burst the opponents three balloons, using items like banana peels, koopa shells and super stars. The battles take place on four Battle Mode-only maze-like tracks.<br/><br/>Every driver can carry one item at a time. Items are obtained by driving over 'question-mark'-tiles on the circuit. There are a number of different items, including shells, banana peels, mushrooms and lightning strikes. These items can be used to attack opponents, defend against attacks or to get a temporary boost. Apart from the items a player can also collect coins. The more coins, the higher the maximum speed. Coins are lost when hit by opponents attacks, falling of the track and bumping into other karts.<br/>For the 20 different race tracks there are 7 different styles: Mario Circuit, Donut plains, Ghost Valley, Bowser Castle, Choco Island, Koopa Beach, Vanilla Lake and Rainbow Road.<br/><br/>Super Mario Kart has more of a racing feel compared to most of its sequels. It has a far less 'bash the leader'-feel as the items received are not so much determined by position in the race. Especially in the higher 150cc class it is absolutely essential to drive tight and know your way around the tracks in order to win. The Time Trial mode adds to that feel as well, as beating record times comes down to hundredths of a second in the case of competitive racing.<br/><br/>The game was very well received and sold eight million copies, becoming the third best-selling SNES game, after Super Mario World and Donkey Kong Country. The game is still regarded as one of the greatest games by many reviewers and considered a defining game in a number of ways: non-platforming games featuring the Mario cast, kart-racing games and the SNES-era in general.<br/><br/>"}, "70132": {"boardgamedesigner": {"3": {"name": "(Uncredited)"}}, "poll": {}, "name": "Wehrmacht", "playingtime": "0", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": {"2026": "Hex-and-Counter"}, "yearpublished": "1978", "usersrated": "3", "maxplayers": "2", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2049090_t.jpg", "average": "6", "statistics": {}, "boardgamepublisher": {"3705": {"name": "Fusilier Games"}}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2049090.jpg", "boardgameversion": {"32966": "First edition"}, "maxplaytime": "0", "boardgamecategory": {"1019": {"name": "Wargame"}}, "age": "12", "minplaytime": "0", "description": "Subtitle: The War in Russia 1941-1945.<br/><br/>This is an epic strategic level game of the entire campaign fought by Germany and the Axis partners against the USSR.

Changes from the original include the move to 3D computer graphics and the inclusion of four-player support. Players take control of characters from the Mario universe, who race around a variety of tracks with items that can either harm opponents or aid the user. The move to three-dimensional graphics allowed for track features not possible with the original game's Mode 7 graphics, such as changes in elevation, bridges, walls, and pits. However, the characters and items remained 2D pre-rendered sprites.<br/><br/>Music for the game was composed by Kenta Nagata. The introduction music for Mario Kart 64, which is loosely based on the original Super Mario Kart theme tune, was remixed and used in the music video game Dance Dance Revolution: Mario Mix for the Nintendo GameCube. The game was critically well received by critics and was a best seller. Mario Kart 64 was one of the first games in the series to feature Charles Martinet as the voice of both Luigi and Wario. It also features the voices of Isaac Marshall as Toad.&quot;<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;Mario_Kart_64,&quot; available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "70134": {"statistics": {}, "name": "Mario Kart Super Circuit", "videogamemode": {"2310": "Network Multiplayer"}, "videogameversion": {"32973": "English/European Game Boy Advance edition"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic782786.jpg", "videogameseries": {"4874": "Mario Kart"}, "videogametheme": {"2337": "Cute Fantasy"}, "videogamegenre": {"2154": "Racing"}, "videogamecharacter": {"5169": "Bowser"}, "usersrated": "48", "average": "7.24583", "videogamefranchise": {"6395": "Player's Choice (Best Selling Nintendo Games, US & EU)"}, "videogameplatform": {"4423": "Game Boy Advance"}, "videogamehonor": {"29705": "2002 D.I.C.E.

At the beginning of each round, players turn the rondel by one segment, adjusting the counts of all resources at the same time.<br/><br/>Each player has a personal game board. New buildings enter the game from time to time, and players can construct them on their game boards with the building materials they gather, with some terrain restrictions on what can be built where. Some spaces start with trees or moors on them, as in Agricola: Farmers of the Moor, so they hinder development until a player clears the land, but they provide resources when they are removed. Clever building on your personal game board will impact your final score, and players can buy additional terrain during the game, if needed.<br/><br/>Players also have three workers who can enter buildings to take the action associated with that location. Workers must stay in place until you've placed all three. You can enter your own buildings with these workers, but to enter and use another player's buildings, you must pay that player an entry fee so that he'll move one of his workers into that building to do the work for you.<br/><br/>Ora et Labora features two variants: France and Ireland.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "1", "boardgameversion": {"311752": "Chinese edition"}, "average": "7.77276", "name": "Ora et Labora", "playingtime": "180", "boardgamemechanic": {"2011": "Modular Board"}, "age": "13", "boardgameexpansion": {}, "usersrated": "7667", "boardgameaccessory": {"163408": "Ora et Labora: Wertungsblock"}, "boardgamesubdomain": {"5497": "Strategy Games"}, "boardgamefamily": {"26397": "Beer"}}, "70150": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic733903.jpg", "poll": {}, "boardgamedesigner": {"12970": {"name": "Richard Malaschitz"}}, "statistics": {}, "yearpublished": "2010", "maxplayers": "2", "boardgameartist": {"12970": "Richard Malaschitz"}, "boardgamepublisher": {"4": {"name": "(Self-Published)"}}, "maxplaytime": "5", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic733903_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "5", "boardgamecategory": {"1009": {"name": "Abstract Strategy"}}, "description": "Clara is abstract connection game similar to hex or twixt, but stones are placed (drawing) freely on board.<br/><br/>Similar as in hex or twist, players place stones (draw circle) on board and goal is connect oposite sides of board.

The game's sequel, Mario Strikers Charged, was also developed by Next Level games and is available for the Wii.

The game features the basic aspects and objectives of a football game, although no referees are present and characters can legitimately shove others out of possession of the ball. As in other games such as Mario Power Tennis, the player can use Mario-themed items such as bananas and red shells to hinder the opposition and gain the advantage. Each team's captain can also use &quot;Super Strikes&quot; that, if timed accurately, will result in two points scored for the striker's team. Each team comprises a goal keeper, a main Mario character (captain), and three of the same secondary Mario characters known as &quot;side kicks&quot;.<br/><br/>The game received a positive reaction from the media, attaining an aggregate score of 76 percent from Game Rankings.

During these visits, Darwin collected 37 bird specimens he thought unique.  While traveling home, Darwin pondered the variations in beak size of the mockingbirds and finches he had collected.  These slight variations in beak structure, along with other small differences observed in both plants and animals he collected, were the beginnings of a radical new thought in how species came to exist.  Over the next fourteen years, Darwin expanded upon these ideas ultimately publishing his controversial treatise The Origin of Species in 1859.<br/><br/>In this game, players help four species of finch evolve and spread throughout the Galapagos archipelago from one common ancestor.  Species evolve and migrate as they try to dominate the habitable population centers on the islands.  Each species of finch has a preferred habitat, ground or tree, and preferred food source, insects or seeds.  Players can affect the dominate species by increasing the food source or habitat type of a particular species.

The game is the sequel to the Nintendo 64 title Mario Tennis, and is the fourth game in the Mario Tennis series. Power Tennis was released in Japan on October 28, 2004, in North America on November 8, 2004, and in Australia on February 25, 2005. The game was re-released for the Wii in 2009 as part of the New Play Control! collection of titles, featuring GameCube games with added Wii controls.<br/><br/>Power Tennis incorporates multiple characters, themes, and locations from the Mario series. The game includes standard tennis matches, but contains variants that feature different scoring formats and objectives. Other variants include &quot;Gimmick&quot; courts, thematic areas with components and properties that directly affect gameplay. The game consists of 18 playable characters, each categorised by their style of play and each with a pair of unique moves known as &quot;Power Shots&quot;. Power Tennis was developed simultaneously with Mario Golf: Toadstool Tour, and the pair shared similar technology and concepts with each other during production. Such similarities include an emphasis on the Mario theme in characters and settings as well as alternative game modes such as &quot;Ring Shot&quot;.&quot;<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;Mario_Power_Tennis,&quot; available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "70197": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic711627.jpg", "poll": {}, "boardgamedesigner": {"3": {"name": "(Uncredited)"}}, "statistics": {}, "yearpublished": "0", "maxplayers": "4", "age": "3", "boardgamepublisher": {"225": {"name": "Cardinal"}}, "maxplaytime": "15", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic711627_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "15", "boardgamecategory": {"1041": {"name": "Children's Game"}}, "description": "This is a Disney &quot;Mickey Mouse Clubhouse&quot; game for preschool children.

Another clumsy feature was the speaker and microphone being located on the side edge of the phone. This often resulted in many to describe it as if one was talking into a &quot;taco  phone&quot;  or &quot;Sidetalking&quot;, or simply that they had one very large ear, because the user held the edge of the phone against the cheek in order to talk into it. The comfort factor of lengthy calls was also called into question. Despite the criticism, it is thought that the speakers were there for a practical reason: if placed elsewhere, the screen would get in contact with the cheek and become smudged. However, almost all other cell phones have the screen against the cheek when the user is talking. Despite the questionable practicality, gamers were still unwilling to talk in such an awkward manner.<br/><br/>When considered from a video game point of view, the N-Gage was known for its unusual screen orientation, a vertical one as opposed to a horizontal one (which is more popular with other handhelds). The reason for this was that the underlying operating system, Series 60, did not support horizontal orientations at that time (only supported since S60v3 ). Some felt this to be a negative feature, feeling that 'unconventional' does not necessarily mean improvement. Possibly due to this screen feature, as well as the public's luke-warm reception to the device, the game library was far from extensive. Despite this, the N-Gage did manage to garner some well known franchises such as Tomb Raider, Sonic, Rayman, Red Faction, Tony Hawk's Pro Skater, The Elder Scrolls, among others.<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;N-Gage&quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "70202": {"statistics": {}, "name": "N-Gage QD", "videogamehardwarecategory": {"2150": "Console"}, "usersrated": "2", "average": "6.75", "videogamehwmfg": {"12156": "Nokia"}, "poll": {}, "videogamehwversion": {"196097": "N-Gage QD"}, "videogamehardware": {"4744": "N-Gage"}, "description": "The N-Gage QD  is a handheld game console and mobile phone by Nokia, and the successor to the N-Gage. It was unveiled on April 14, 2004.<br/><br/>It revised the device's physical design, being smaller and rounder. It corrected the flaw of the cartridge slot with a more convenient one on the bottom of the device. This design also moved the earpiece to the face of the device, rather than on the side, as in the previous model.<br/><br/>Despite the revision, the unit drew quick criticism. Some noted that the rubber fitting side that closed the gap between the device top and bottom casing could be easily loosened over a few months. Once the rubber piece was removed, the device became more vulnerable to water or particles entering the internals unless the fitting was replaced. Replacement fittings were available at Nokia's service centers. Various third-party sellers also sold unofficial replacement fittings via online electronics suppliers or eBay.<br/><br/>The device retailed at a lower price compared to the original N-Gage device, aided by the fact that it was usually sold with service contracts and applicable subsidies. For instance, in the United States the N-Gage QD was available as a prepaid phone offered by Cingular for $99.99 at retail games stores such as Electronics Boutique and GameStop.<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;N-Gage QD&quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "70204": {"rpgitemversion": {"33232": "PDF Version"}, "poll": {}, "name": "Dungeon Set 1", "rpgproducer": {"20791": "Tom Tullis"}, "average": "0", "usersrated": "0", "statistics": {}, "rpg": {"356": "Generic / Universal"}, "rpgcategory": {"2086": "Accessory (dice, maps, screens, cards)"}, "rpgseries": {"4600": "Dragon Tiles"}, "rpggenre": {"961": "Fantasy"}, "description": "Publisher Blurb:<br/><br/>DRAGON TILES add a new dimension to boring miniature tiles...literally.

The soundtrack was created by Junkie XL and is played through the in-game radio station, &quot;Radio BIG&quot;.<br/><br/>The gameplay in SSX Blur follows a similar format of the previous SSX titles. Like SSX 3, the player progressively works up through 3 peaks on a mountain, participating in races, trick competitions, and the new slalom event to earn prizes and other unlockable material. Players are able to choose from either the traditional snowboards; or skis, as introduced in SSX On Tour.<br/><br/>The game control uses both the Wii Remote and the Nunchuk controller. Movement, speed, and jumping is controlled through the Nunchuk, while, when in the air, the Wii Remote is used to perform tricks. The Wii Remote is also used for throwing snowballs at targets or foes during a race.<br/><br/>As the player races down the hillside, they can successfully complete tricks to earn points as well as to build up an ever-depleting boost meter. When the boost meter is full, the player is then able to execute special &quot;Ubertricks&quot;, which require the player to draw a specific shape in the air, such as a heart or a treble clef. While the player knows some Ubertricks at the start of the game, additional ones can be discovered in career mode by collecting icons for that Ubertrick hidden across the various courses.&quot;<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;SSX_Blur,&quot; available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "70212": {"boardgamedesigner": {"3504": {"name": "Danny Holte"}}, "average": "5", "poll": {}, "name": "Battleground", "playingtime": "45", "minplayers": "2", "yearpublished": "0", "usersrated": "2", "maxplayers": "2", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic716341_t.jpg", "boardgameartist": {"3504": "Danny Holte"}, "statistics": {}, "boardgamepublisher": {"772": {"name": "(Unpublished)"}}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic716341.jpg", "boardgameversion": {"33267": "First edition"}, "maxplaytime": "45", "boardgamecategory": {"1002": {"name": "Card Game"}}, "age": "10", "minplaytime": "45", "description": "Battleground is a card game of infantry combat in World War II.

It can also be played on a hex grid.<br/><br/>Fate's most significant feature is the fact that players gain increasing tokens to place and use as the game progresses.  &quot;Reinforcements&quot; are calculated as a function of both the number of spaces the player already occupies at the start of his or her turn and the turn number of the game.  This increasing reinforcement calculation causes the dominance of the game to swing back and forth like a wild, accelerating pendulum, hence the name of the game.  The goal becomes timing the swings of the game such that a player is able to completely win the game before the momentum shifts right back.  The game is driven to a conclusion with one player filling the entire board and removing the final pieces of his or her opponent so only tokens of one color remain on the board.<br/><br/>Standard Pendulum of FATE is a two-player game, but it can also be played by more with additional supplies of theoretically limitless tokens in different colors for each player.<br/><br/>"}, "70215": {"boardgamedesigner": {"35847": {"name": "Steve Pearson"}}, "poll": {}, "name": "The Tabloid News", "playingtime": "10", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": {"2004": "Set Collection"}, "yearpublished": "2010", "usersrated": "3", "boardgamefamily": {"22783": "Admin: Better Description Needed!"}, "maxplayers": "4", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic712384_t.jpg", "average": "6.4", "statistics": {}, "boardgamepublisher": {"11703": {"name": "Warcoach Games"}}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic712384.jpg", "boardgameversion": {"33279": "First Edition"}, "maxplaytime": "10", "boardgamecategory": {"1002": {"name": "Card Game"}}, "age": "12", "minplaytime": "10", "description": "The Tabloid News is the first in Warcoach Games new &quot;10 Minute Game&quot; series.  <br/>   The Tabloid News is a new take on an old concept.

It is dark, snowing and well below 10 degrees cold and falling rapidly. Notably, there are no mobile phones. If you know nothing about northern Sweden, the film &quot;Fargo&quot; by the Coen brothers might be a good, available source of inspiration. A better but less available alternative is a 50's flick called &quot;Terror in the midnight sun&quot;. The setting for this game could easily be changed for something else with the appropriate properties.<br/><br/>The story in Travellers is allegoric. For the players, it will probably come across as non-sensible and lacking a statement. This is alright, it will all change in the end. I like the story---I find it quite nicely put together, interesting but most of all highly enjoyable as a short role playing exercise. Having played Travellers quite a few times with different groups of players, I think the story is rather flexible, without losing its key points. This will be discussed later, once you too know the story.<br/><br/>When Travellers was written in September 1998, I was dead tired of scenarios composed of disjoint scenes where the entire story was chopped up into small bits introduced piecemeal. I wanted Travellers to have a story not really using scenes and where the different parts of the story was seamlessly integrated. In this, I feel, I was successful only in part, and the play line is broken in a few places (opposed to constantly in many of the scene-based scenarios of the time, including my own). At the time, I simply didn't know how to get my story in there without taking control over the players like that.

It can be played with easy rules for beginners, so that dad can have fun teaching his boy the fundamentals of Baseball.  It can also be played using all the science and strategy of Major League Baseball.&quot;<br/><br/>The game consists of a field with a giant &quot;spinner&quot; embedded under it.  There are nine fielders sitting over small squares on the board, four umpires over additional squares, and a batter.  The knob in the center is spun and aligned to a space in front of the pitcher.  The player at bat then decides to swing, bunt or take the pitch.  If the pitch is taken, the umpire behind the plate will call a ball or strike.  This is done by lifting the umpire off a small square revealing the call.  If a swing is made, the batter is lifted off his square and the result of the swing is shown by a number 1-9 (indicating the player position) and the type of hit (ground ball, line drive or fly ball).  The defensive player then lifts the indicated fielder off his square to reveal whether the ball was fielded or not.  If a throw has to be made to a base, the umpire on that base makes the call.

These are referred to as &quot;patch cards,&quot; since developers fix a module by patching its code.<br/><br/>Players must contribute enough patch cards to make a module available to any player (i.e. cooperative play) to eventually build a website. They can also &quot;own&quot; that module by being its biggest contributor.<br/><br/>Finally, players try to build websites for victory points depending on whether a module is available and its color (e.g. pink, blue or brown). Victory points are also available for individuals who contribute the most to a module's development. The winner has the most victory points. Play lasts 5-10 minutes.<br/><br/>The design of the cards is unique in that modules and websites are combined on the same card, on either side, and the websites have the URL for well-known sites using Drupal.<br/><br/>The order of play is as follows:<br/><br/>1. Take 7 patch cards<br/>2. Take 6 site/module cards<br/>3. Play 3 modules<br/>4. Play patches on modules<br/>5. Audit modules<br/>6. Sites check<br/>7. Module check<br/>8.

It is the last Dragon Quest game in the Zenithia trilogy. It was released on December 9, 1995 in Japan. This installment in the series was developed by Heartbeat, whereas the previous Dragon Quest games were developed by Chunsoft. In July 2007, Square Enix announced a series of remakes of Dragon Quest IV, V and VI for the Nintendo DS, making this the first remake of the latter game on other consoles. It was also announced that the title will also see release in both North America and Europe.[6] Prior to this, it has been translated by fans.<br/><br/>As the sixth installment to the Dragon Quest series, the graphics and gameplay remain close to the other games, with minor additions and upgrades. The graphics were vastly improved from Dragon Quest V, which was also for the SNES, but rather unimpressive due to it being an early game on the console.. Navigation remains largely unchanged from the previous games and the turn-based battles are still in first-person. The class system from Dragon Quest III returns, with minor adjustments.<br/><br/>Despite the very high price of 11,970 yen (about 100 dollars), Dragon Quest VI has sold 3.2 million copies in Japan, becoming the best selling game of 1995.<br/><br/>The story follows the traditional Dragon Quest &quot;Hero&quot; on a quest to save the world. In this particular installment, the heroes also have to endure the personal struggle of amnesia, as many of the main characters do not initially remember who they are. After completing a series of quests, the player learns that in addition to a Real World, there is also a Dream World, made up of people's dreams, and that there is a great evil that wants to conquer both. The Hero and his new party work together to save both worlds from the ever-growing threat.&quot;<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;Dragon_Quest_VI:_Realms_of_Reverie,&quot; available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>Individual credits:<br/>Akira Toriyama: Character &amp; Monster design<br/>Koichi Sugiyama: Music<br/><br/>"}, "70291": {"statistics": {}, "name": "Dragon Quest IX: Sentinels of the Starry Skies", "videogamemode": {"2313": "Cooperative"}, "videogameversion": {"163935": "Danish/Swedish Nintendo DS edition"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic785139.jpg", "videogameseries": {"4814": "Dragon Quest"}, "videogametheme": {"2148": "Fantasy"}, "videogamegenre": {"2155": "RPG"}, "videogamecharacter": {"28161": "Psaro the Manslayer"}, "usersrated": "58", "average": "8.07069", "videogamefranchise": {"4920": "Dragon Quest"}, "videogameplatform": {"4734": "Nintendo DS"}, "videogamehonor": {"37502": "2010 Japan Game Awards Game of the Year Winner"}, "poll": {}, "vgcharacterversion": {"283966": "Psaro the Manslayer (Dragon Quest IX)"}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic785139_t.jpg", "description": "&quot;Dragon Quest IX: Sentinels of the Starry Skies (\u30c9\u30e9\u30b4\u30f3\u30af\u30a8\u30b9\u30c8IX \u661f\u7a7a\u306e\u5b88\u308a\u4eba, Doragon Kuesuto Nain Hoshizora no Mamoribito, lit. &quot;Dragon Quest IX: Defenders of the Starry Sky&quot;) is a video game for the Nintendo DS released on July 11, 2009 in Japan. It is the ninth installment in the acclaimed Dragon Quest series by Y\u016bji Horii, developed by Level-5 and published by Square Enix. The game was primarily designed around multiplayer and to be able to sell well overseas, particularly the United States and Europe. The basic plot involves an ex-angel who has fallen to earth becoming a human.<br/><br/>Dragon Quest IX marks several firsts for the main series: it is the first to be initially launched for a handheld system; first to have no random encounters (except when sailing); and the first to be designed primarily with the intent of being a multiplayer video game. In addition, it is the first Dragon Quest title to use a graphical menu system in the Japanese-language version. Dragon Quest IX was designed to be more difficult than any previous game in the series, including spinoff titles.<br/><br/>The sales of Dragon Quest IX set new records in Japan; these sales helped boost Nintendo's earnings and have impacted future plannings by the company. The game has been generally well received by critics, but has had more mixed commentary from the general public in Japan.&quot;<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;Dragon_Quest_IX:_Sentinels_of_the_Starry_Skies,&quot; available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "70292": {"rpgitemversion": {"33634": "Softcover"}, "statistics": {}, "name": "Weapons & Equipment", "rpgproducer": {"26952": "Kim S.

Players represent the major powers involved in the conflict and have at their command the forces with which to wage war and achieve victory for their country or alliance.<br/><br/>The game covers the European, North African, and Pacific Theaters on three maps and four counter-sheets.<br/><br/>Difficulty is rated at a 6 out of ten, ages 12 and up.<br/><br/>Design Notes:<br/>The Second World War was prototyped by Peter Bertram and Randall Mac Innis in 1985. It was originally envisioned as a medium-complexity wargame to fall somewhere between the existing designs, Axis and Allies and World in Flames, which were either too pedestrian for us hard-core, grognard wargamers or too massive to be played within the confines of our housing. This final version is exactly what we envisioned when we started: a fun game about WWII with a lot of meat, but not so complicated that you need to be an accountant to enjoy it.<br/><br/>The game scale, the 3-map composition, and the use of megahexes to regulate naval movement were originally set by Peter and Randall. They are the only elements that remained intact throughout development. While designer John D. Powers had to make many trade-offs between realism and playability, the latter was the primary concern. Once the nuances of the system are understood and exploited by all players, you will find that historical strategies will yield surprisingly historical results.<br/><br/>I hope that players find it to be enjoyable, and despite its high-level, granular view, the most accurate grand strategic game about WWII yet to be published.<br/><br/>What You Get<br/><br/>     2 22x34 inch full color maps<br/>     1 17x22 inch full-color map<br/>     4 Full-color, die-cut sheets of 5/8 inch counters<br/>     1 Book of Rules<br/>     1 Book of Scenarios<br/>     Charts and Tables<br/>     Dice<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>(source: One Small Step website )<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "0", "boardgameversion": {"297520": "One Small Step Edition"}, "name": "The Second World War", "playingtime": "900", "boardgamemechanic": {"2026": "Hex-and-Counter"}, "average": "7.56667", "usersrated": "15", "boardgamesubdomain": {"4664": "Wargames"}, "age": "0"}, "70313": {"boardgamedesigner": {"3": {"name": "(Uncredited)"}}, "average": "6", "poll": {}, "name": "Snelrekenspel", "playingtime": "30", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": {"2072": "Dice Rolling"}, "yearpublished": "0", "usersrated": "1", "maxplayers": "6", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic715498_t.jpg", "boardgameartist": {"3": "(Uncredited)"}, "statistics": {}, "boardgamepublisher": {"12171": {"name": "Nationale Nederlanden"}}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic715498.jpg", "boardgameversion": {"33697": "Nationale Nederlanden First edition"}, "maxplaytime": "30", "boardgamecategory": {"1017": {"name": "Dice"}}, "age": "8", "minplaytime": "30", "description": "The game-master throws the three blue dice.

Sometimes adventuring isn't so much what you can do, as knowing when to do it.<br/><br/>No adventurer can be prepared for every challenge they might face. The clever ones just know how to face the challenges they can't prepare for. These farsighted strategists and cunning tacticians calculate their odds as they swing their swords and loose their spells. They base decisions on the likelihood of events, aiming to be ready for the inevitable, able to deal with the unlikely, and ready with a back-up plan for the impossible.<br/><br/>Strategists and Tacticians can make any character more versatile with variant class features for all the core classes, a dozen new prestige classes, spells for a variety of spellcasters, and over fifty feats that unlock new abilities and improve existing ones. New combat maneuvers allow you to throat hostages, sever limbs, choke your enemies, or take advantage of a free off-hand. Give characters a multiclass flavor from 1st level with the Apprentice, a special new one-level base class. All this and more in The Definitive Guide to Clever Warriors.<br/><br/>Follow resident schemer Flynn Dielle's advice on preparedness, improvisation, and survival, and you could be the next adventurer to save a village from a dragon using a young cow, two rubber trees, and a bag of holding.

A spin-off of the popular Final Fantasy series, the game shares several traits with 1997's Final Fantasy Tactics, although it is not a direct sequel. The player assembles a clan of characters, and controls their actions over grid-like battlefields. Players are mostly free to decide the classes, abilities, and statistics of their characters.<br/><br/>The game's story centers on four children; Marche, Mewt, Ritz, and Doned, who live in a small town named St. Ivalice. The children are transported to a realm of the same name as their town, &quot;Ivalice&quot;, after discovering an ancient magical book. The story then focuses on the exploits of Marche as he attempts to return to the real world while facing opposition from those around him.<br/><br/>Tactics Advance is one of the initial products from the cooperation of Square and Nintendo made for the Game Boy Advance console; it was developed by the team brought over from the game company Quest Corporation.

Some missions are central to the story and can be replayed until successfully completed. There are over 300 other missions in the game that may be replayed in order to level up the player's team.

It was published by Nintendo for the Gameboy Advance in 2003. The game is the first in the Mario &amp; Luigi series and the first handheld version in the overall Mario RPG series after Super Mario RPG and Paper Mario. The game was well received and is still ranked among the top of the Gameboy Advance games by many.<br/><br/>In the game the player controls the Mario Brothers on a quest in the Beanbean Kingdom to defeat the evil witch Cackletta in order to restore the voice of Princess Peach. The story develops throughout the game with many absurd twists. Absurd is a word that fits perfectly with M&amp;L:SS as the game features many jokes, including comical references to previous Mario games and making fun of the Mario Bros Mario themselves. Especially Luigi is being mocked, for example by referring to him as &quot;Mr. Green Mario Brother Guy&quot;.<br/><br/>An important part of the game are the turn-based battles. Typically the Mario Brothers have to defeat a number of enemies at a time, or a boss. To do this, the player can select an attack to perform against the enemy of choice. Unlike more traditional RPG's the game features Timed Actions. With this the player can push buttons during an attack to increase the strength of the attack. The way to perform a correct Timed Action is different per type of attack. In the same manner Timed Actions can also be used to improve defense against an enemy attack. The game also features Bros moves that allow for attacking with both Mario and Luigi at the same time. Because of these possibilities the battle are more dynamic, challenging and interactive compared to traditional turn based battles.<br/><br/>Outside of the battles, the game includes the following features:<br/>- Items can be bought found and sold. <br/>- The Mario Brothers experience levels go up, letting the player choose which skills they want to level up.<br/>- Solve environmental puzzles by cooperating between Mario and Luigi.<br/>- Many different Badges that aid the characters can be obtained and equipped to both Mario and Luigi.<br/>- The classic Mario Bros arcade game is present.<br/><br/>There are two sequels to M&amp;L:SS on Nintendo DS: 'Partners in Time' and 'Bowser's Inside Story'.<br/><br/>"}, "70387": {"statistics": {}, "name": "Mario & Luigi: Partners in Time", "videogamemode": {"2149": "Single-Player"}, "videogameversion": {"34084": "English/UK DS edition"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic782263.jpg", "videogameseries": {"4871": "Mario & Luigi"}, "usersrated": "61", "videogamefranchise": {"4868": "Super Mario"}, "videogamecharacter": {"4737": "Luigi"}, "average": "6.93607", "videogamegenre": {"2339": "Action RPG"}, "videogameplatform": {"4734": "Nintendo DS"}, "videogamehonor": {"29823": "2006 D.I.C.E.

The adventure follows Mario, Luigi, Baby Mario, and Baby Luigi as they search for Princess Peach, who has been abducted by an alien species known as the Shroobs. The gameplay centers on the co-operation between the quartet, who must use their specific qualities and skills to solve puzzles and thus progress through the game. Partners in Time features multiple role-playing game elements, but with a turn-based battle system focused on timing accuracy. The game is similar to that of its predecessor, but is considered darker in tone.<br/><br/>Partners in Time was positively received by the media, gaining an aggregate score of 86.80% from Game Rankings and a 87 from Metacritic. Like its predecessor, the game was praised by critics for its characterization and comical style, as well as its use of the DS's dual screen.&quot;<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;Mario_&amp;_Luigi:_Partners_in_Time,&quot; available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "70388": {"statistics": {}, "name": "Mario & Luigi: Bowser's Inside Story", "videogamemode": {"2149": "Single-Player"}, "videogameversion": {"163321": "English/European Nintendo DS edition"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic775190.jpg", "videogameseries": {"4871": "Mario & Luigi"}, "usersrated": "46", "videogamefranchise": {"4868": "Super Mario"}, "videogamecharacter": {"5169": "Bowser"}, "average": "7.53696", "videogamegenre": {"2339": "Action RPG"}, "videogameplatform": {"4734": "Nintendo DS"}, "videogamehonor": {"31878": "2009 Game Critics Best Handheld Game of the Year Nominee"}, "poll": {}, "vgcharacterversion": {"219910": "Luigi"}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic775190_t.jpg", "description": "&quot;Mario &amp; Luigi: Bowser's Inside Story, released in Japan as Mario &amp; Luigi RPG 3!!!

It was published by Nintendo for Japan and by Sega for North America, Europe and all other regions. The game is officially licensed by the International Olympic Committee (IOC) through exclusive licensee International Sports Multimedia. The game is the first official crossover title to feature characters from both Mario and Sonic The Hedgehog's respective series. It was released on the Wii in November 2007 and the Nintendo DS handheld in early 2008, and is the first official video game of the 2008 Summer Olympic Games.<br/><br/>Mario &amp; Sonic on the Wii and DS is a collection of twenty-four events based on the Olympic Games. Players can assume the role of a Nintendo or Sega character while competing against the others in these events. Players use the Wii Remote to mimic actions performed in real life sports, such as swinging a paddle. The DS version utilize the stylus and button controls. Both games closely follow rules and regulations of the specific sports. Sega adopted the IOC's mission of promoting a sporting spirit and its desire to interest young people in the Olympics by using its characters. Due to the aforementioned and the atmosphere of competitive sportsmanship the Olympics had to offer, Sega received approval by Nintendo to include Mario in the game with Sonic. Sonic the Hedgehog is the protagonist of the video game series released by Sega in order to provide the company with a mascot to rival Nintendo's flagship character Mario in the early 1990s.<br/><br/>Overall, critics praised the multiplayer interaction of the Wii game and variety of events of both versions. However, reviewers criticized the Wii version for its lack of simplicity and its DS counterpart for not offering the same interaction between players. The Wii title was awarded the &quot;Best Wii game of 2007&quot; at the Games Convention in Leipzig. A sequel titled Mario &amp; Sonic at the Olympic Winter Games was released in October 2009 for the 2010 Winter Olympics in Vancouver, following the commercial success of its predecessor which has sold over ten million units.&quot;<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;Mario_&amp;_Sonic_at_the_Olympic_Games,&quot; available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "70390": {"statistics": {}, "name": "Super Paper Mario", "videogamemode": {"2149": "Single-Player"}, "videogameversion": {"34097": "English/UK Wii edition"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic721045.jpg", "videogameseries": {"4870": "Paper Mario"}, "videogametheme": {"2337": "Cute Fantasy"}, "videogamefranchise": {"11430": "Nintendo Selects (Best Selling Wii Games, US & EU)"}, "videogamecharacter": {"5169": "Bowser"}, "usersrated": "143", "average": "6.94748", "videogamegenre": {"2339": "Action RPG"}, "videogameplatform": {"4441": "Wii"}, "videogamehonor": {"31057": "2007 Spike Best Nintendo Console Game of the Year Nominee"}, "poll": {}, "vgcharacterversion": {"218789": "Mario"}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic721045_t.jpg", "description": "&quot;Super Paper Mario (\u30b9\u30fc\u30d1\u30fc\u30da\u30fc\u30d1\u30fc\u30de\u30ea\u30aa, S\u016bp\u0101 P\u0113p\u0101 Mario) is a platform/console role-playing game (RPG) developed by Intelligent Systems and published by Nintendo.

Dennis Hopper, Grace Jones and Stephanie Seymour were among the voice actors who lend their voices to characters in the game. Seymour herself also appears on screen at one point, while Hopper and Jones appear via computer animated representations.<br/><br/>The story is told through a variety of partial screen FMV movies.

Unlike the religious dictatorships of the past, this government not only has the ability to send sinners to hell - they can prove they have done it.<br/><br/>In this third person perspective, dystopia environment, you pick between Gideon Eshanti, or Rachel Braque, two loyal police officers (and lovers), agents of a new law enforcement agency created by the theocracy - Artificial Reality Containment, or ARC, a Cultural Revolution-like organization that enforces a ban on cybernetic technology in general and virtual reality in particular.<br/><br/>The story begins one night when they find they have been declared enemies of the state and on the run from the very government they worked for. Thus begins a quest to uncover the secrets behind the theocracy's reign of terror, one that will lead them from the corridors of power in 2095 Washington D.C. to the very depths of Hell.

The game's engine is a modified version of the Infinity Engine, which was also used for BioWare's Baldur's Gate, a previous AD&amp;D game set in the Forgotten Realms.<br/><br/>Planescape: Torment is primarily story-driven; combat is given less prominence than in most contemporary role-playing games. The protagonist, known as The Nameless One, is an immortal who has lived many lives but has forgotten all about them, even forgetting his own name. The game focuses on his journey throughout the city of Sigil and other planes to reclaim his memories of these previous lives. Several characters in the game may join The Nameless One on his journey, and most of these characters have encountered him in the past.<br/><br/>The game was not a significant commercial success but received widespread critical praise and has since become a cult classic. It was lauded for its immersive dialogue, for the dark and relatively obscure Planescape setting, and for the protagonist's unique persona, which shirked many characteristics of traditional role-playing games. It was considered by many video game journalists to be the best role-playing game (RPG) of 1999, and continues to receive attention long after its release.&quot;<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;Planescape:_Torment,&quot; available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "70415": {"statistics": {}, "name": "System Shock", "videogamemode": {"2149": "Single-Player"}, "videogameversion": {"34211": "English/UK Windows Classic edition"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic782394.jpg", "videogameseries": {"5889": "System Shock"}, "videogametheme": {"2281": "Cyberpunk"}, "usersrated": "99", "videogamecharacter": {"5088": "SHODAN"}, "average": "7.90545", "videogamegenre": {"2339": "Action RPG"}, "videogameplatform": {"4714": "DOS"}, "poll": {}, "vgcharacterversion": {"52340": "SHODAN"}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic782394_t.jpg", "description": "&quot;System Shock is an action role-playing game developed by Looking Glass Technologies and published by Origin Systems.

You've spent time in the city; sure, you may even have a (rarely visited) house somewhere. But your real home are the places in between: the sleepy little towns that hide dark secrets, the farms bought out by the big conglomerates, the mountain logging camps run by corrupt overseers, the forgotten desert prisons in need of a revolution. For you, America is in the details, and America needs a protector.<br/><br/>You arrive in a needy town in the dusty red light of the setting sun, and have an almost supernatural ability to find trouble. It doesn't matter if you're on the road for knowledge, for peace of mind, or because you're running from prosecution for a crime you didn't commit, once trouble finds you, you become a hero one more time. You can't help it. You never strike first, never respond with raw force when reason and quiet words will suffice, but once your tormentors cross the line.... you are an unstoppable, righteous champion, who always fights for peace and always protects helpless innocents.<br/><br/>"}, "70428": {"rpg": {"305": "d20 Modern"}, "poll": {}, "name": "Mia Famiglia: The Lodovico Crime Family", "rpgproducer": {"3": "(Uncredited)"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic715381.jpg", "usersrated": "0", "rpgitemversion": {"34263": "PDF version"}, "average": "0", "statistics": {}, "rpggenre": {"945": "Crime"}, "rpgcategory": {"2108": "Sourcebook (rules/options to enhance play)"}, "rpgseries": {"3935": "Adventure Blocks"}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic715381_t.jpg", "description": "<br/>Publisher's blurb<br/><br/>Some games can feel constrained when running a straight &quot;Store-bought&quot; adventure.

The new style crossed barriers of country, race and technique. The asterism of Tibetan monks was combined with the feats of iron will practiced by Pakistani yogis, blended in a stew of Japanese weapon-styles, Chinese hand to hand and firearms training similar to that used by Western SWAT experts.<br/><br/>When John Woo and the Wachowski brothers started making movies about samurai gunslingers, graceful and lethal with twin SMGs, that influence went in the pot, too.<br/><br/>The Hollowpoint Monk style is as fast moving and deadly as a bullet, and like a round striking a target, the swiftly changing style is constantly deformed and ricocheted by its practice.<br/><br/>The mockingly named &ldquo;Hollowpoint Monk&rdquo; is a modern martial artist who draws equally from the old and the new: Zen koans first uttered by the Buddha, meditations handed down from one seeker to another for centuries, Mossad combat shooting techniques, action movie cool and quotes are all equally valuable sources of inspiration for these unconventional, adaptable martial artists.<br/><br/>A Hollowpoint Monk is not a recognized martial artist; they are official members of no dojo, usually forbidden from fighting on any recognized circuit. Few seek the spiritual side of the martial arts, and most learn just enough to be deadly. Hollowpoint Monks are practical and lethal, and most have been fighters their entire lives. Most of these new-school warriors are gangsters, cops and former soldiers. Prospective Hollowpoint Monks have lived with violence their entire lives, and have learned a secret technique that only improves their ability to survive. Some are traditional monks who abandoned the traditional path for a chance to extend their lethal capabilities beyond the reach of their arms.

Debuting at fourth position on NPD Intelect's best-seller list, it was Troika's best-selling title with 234,000 copies sold and with takings of US$8.8 million.<br/><br/>Reviews have been mostly positive, with IGN scoring it 8.7 and conferring the IGN Editors' Choice Award on 24 August 2001. PC Gamer and GameZone awarded Arcanum 90 out of 100, with the latter also conferring its Editors' Choice accolade. The Electric Playground awarded the game 9 out of 10, calling it &quot;the most diverse and open-ended RPG to date&quot;. The game currently holds an average review score of 79% on GameRankings and 81% on Metacritic.<br/><br/>The story takes place on the continent of Arcanum, which despite its initial fantasy setting has just started going through an industrial revolution. The story begins with the crash of the zeppelin IFS Zephyr, of which the protagonist is the only survivor, which leads him throughout the land in search of answers. The game employs an isometric perspective and features an open game world where the protagonist can travel unhindered.&quot;<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;Arcanum:_Of_Steamworks_and_Magick_Obscura,&quot; available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "70447": {"statistics": {}, "name": "Cryptych (Issue 7 - Jul 1994)", "rpgproducer": {"35724": "M.

These models included a PCMCIA slot instead of the expansion bay port of newer models. SCPH-10000 and SCPH-15000 did not have a built-in DVD movie playback and instead relied on encrypted playback software that was copied to a memory card from an included CD-ROM. (Normally, the PS2 will only execute encrypted software from its memory card, but see PS2 Independence Exploit.) V3 had a substantially different internal structure from the subsequent revisions, featuring several interconnected printed circuit boards. As of V4 everything was unified into one board, except the power supply. V5 introduced minor internal changes, and the only difference between V6 (sometimes called V5.1) and V5 is the orientation of the Power/Reset switch board connector, which was reversed to prevent the use of no-solder modchips. V7 and V8 included only minor revisions to V6. Assembly of the PS2 moved to the People's Republic of China during the development of V9 (model numbers SCPH-50000 and SCPH-50001). The upgraded console added an infrared port for the optional DVD remote control, removed the IEEE 1394 port, added the capability to read DVD-RW and DVD+RW discs, added progressive-scan output of DVD movies, and added a quieter fan. V10 and V11 were only minor revisions to V9.<br/><br/>The PS2 standard color is matte black. Several different variations in color have been produced in different quantities and regions, including ceramic white, light yellow, metallic blue (aqua), metallic silver, navy (star blue), opaque blue (astral blue), opaque black (midnight black), pearl white, Sakura purple, satin gold, satin silver, snow white, super red, transparent blue (ocean blue) and also Limited Edition color Pink which was distributed in some regions such as Oceania, and parts of Asia.<br/><br/>The small PlayStation logo on the front of the disc tray could be rotated ninety degrees, in order for the logo to be the right way up in both vertical and horizontal console orientations.

Available in late October 2004, it is smaller, thinner, and quieter than the older versions and includes a built-in Ethernet port (in some markets it also has an integrated modem). Due to its thinner profile, it does not contain the 3.5&quot; expansion bay and therefore does not support the internal hard disk drive. It also lacks an internal power supply, similar to the GameCube, and has a modified Multitap expansion. The removal of the expansion bay has been criticized as a limitation due to the existence of titles such as Final Fantasy XI, which require the use of the HDD. The official PS2 Linux also requires an expansion bay to function. Currently only the modified Multitap is sold in stores, however these are also compatible with the older versions, and also added support for multiple memory cards on some games. Third-party connectors can be soldered into the unit giving hard drive support, however IDE connections were completely removed in the V14 revision, thereby eliminating this option.
