Ramps, stone ledges, and ladders offer an upwards battle up the side of the quarry. A rope and pulley system offers a cut of a rope and a swing to a new spot in the quarry as stone slabs fall on your enemies below or an acrobatic balancing act to walk the tightrope from place to place in the quarry. Special maneuvering and trap options abound with this map.<br/><br/>Medieval Quarry is a single exterior map of a medieval mining operation. The map has a single interior of a storage barn used for sheltering wagons bringing in supplies.<br/><br/>Medieval Quarry is intended for use in fantasy games. It can also be used in historical games in BC times (For example, it would work well in a game focusing on Greek city-states). It might also fit in the Dark Ages after the fall of Rome when mining techniques the Roman used were lost (The Romans used their aqueducts to bring water to mines to perform more advanced hydraulic mining than depicted here).<br/><br/>Adventure hook for this map:<br/><br/>Quarrel over the Quarry: A local quarry offers a curiously high price for guards via a messenger to a nearby town. The group is offered the job by the messenger. It is odd in that the job isn&rsquo;t listed on any job boards in local taverns and inns and the price seems too high to guard mere stone.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, a group of local bandits attack the nearby logging camp during this time to procure horses, oxen, carts, and wagons for their heist. The miners&rsquo; frenzied activity after a slow start has not gone unnoticed by the brigands. They are determined to get the valuable ore themselves without doing the hard labor of mining.<br/><br/>The group should arrive during the daytime so they can look around and plan on how they will defend the quarry during the night. Archers and magicians can take up lookout positions on ramps or stone ledges excellent for sniping or casting from afar. Rogues can set up traps of stone slabs that can be cut loose by slicing the attached rope from pulleys. Swordsmen can fight on ladders, ropes, and other platforms to show their prowess.<br/><br/>At night the bandits arrive to steal the slabs of rock excavated from the quarry and it&rsquo;s up to the group to fight them off and prevent the theft.<br/><br/>If the group succeeds in defending the quarry, the quarry master gives them a wagon with stone slabs and some gold pieces to pay for smelting the ore as payment. And the amount of gold is much less than what was offered. The quarry master can&rsquo;t pay that price in gold pieces but insists the gold in the slabs should be enough for the offered pay.<br/><br/>"}, "171569": {"rpgitemversion": {"263467": "Silver Foil - Kickstarter Boxed Set"}, "poll": {}, "name": "The Chained Coffin", "rpgproducer": {"61093": "Reverend Dak"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2408675.jpg", "usersrated": "8", "average": "7.8125", "rpggenre": {"155": "Fantasy (High Fantasy)"}, "rpgissuearticle": {"151567": "Just Announced!"}, "rpg": {"10737": "Dungeon Crawl Classics Role Playing Game"}, "statistics": {}, "rpgcategory": {"2084": "Scenario / Adventure / Module"}, "rpgseries": {"309": "Dungeon Crawl Classics"}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2408675_t.jpg", "description": "Publisher Blurb<br/><br/>A whispered voice calls from a coffin bound in chains, urging the heroes into the depths of the Shudder Mountains, a place rife with superstition and forlorn secrets.

This door comprises a special spinning wheel puzzle that forms a central puzzle in the adventure:<br/><br/>Beyond the ancient bridge is a 40&rsquo; wide, 30&rsquo; deep ledge that lies perpendicular to a sheer rock face. Set into the rocky cliff at the far side of the ledge stands a great stone archway sealed by an imposing door. Blue bolts of lightning ripple silently across the door&rsquo;s face, hinting at magical wards or seals. In the center of the door are three circular dials set one inside the next. Each dial bears several different symbols, no two of which repeat.<br/><br/>Artist Doug Kovacs has rendered this door in a beautiful player handout (see image below). What&rsquo;s the solution? You&rsquo;ll have to buy the module to find out!<br/><br/>To add additional replay value, author Michael Curtis has also designed five additional game mechanisms that utilize the spinning wheel (more puzzles, magic items, etc.).

The five main actions are shown on the bottom part of the board:<br/><br/><br/>    Get resources with 1-3 dice, depending on the value of the resource (camels, pepper, silk, gold). The first player for each resource gets them for free; the later ones have to pay according to the value shown on the dice.<br/><br/><br/><br/>    Take one resource of your choice and two camels. Each player sets the minimum value for the future dice.<br/><br/><br/><br/>    Earn money, with any one die netting you five money.<br/><br/><br/><br/>    Purchase orders: The value of one die unlocks the orders up to that number (shown on the spaces) and allows you to buy one or two of those orders. Orders are refreshed and placed at the beginning of each round. To fulfill an order, players have to spend resources for victory points, other resources, camels, and more.<br/><br/><br/><br/>    Travel: Two dice are placed to unlock the distance that can be traveled on the upper part of the board, that is, the map. Here, the traveler piece of each player starts at Venice and can decide between several routes eastward, all the way to Beijing. When a traveler stops at a city, they place a marker there, giving them access to a different additional action for the rest of the game.<br/><br/><br/>After five rounds, the game ends with players receiving victory points for arriving in Beijing, fulfilling the most orders, and having reached the cities on secret city cards that each player gets at the start of the game; these points are added to the VPs gained during the game.<br/><br/>Auf den Spuren von Marco Polo should not be confused with Marco Polo Expedition, which had the same German title.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": {"311999": "Brazilian first edition"}, "average": "7.97236", "name": "The Voyages of Marco Polo", "playingtime": "100", "boardgamemechanic": {"2041": "Card Drafting"}, "age": "12", "boardgameexpansion": {}, "usersrated": "9656", "boardgamesubdomain": {"5497": "Strategy Games"}, "boardgamefamily": {"6480": "Animals: Camels"}}, "171624": {"rpgitemversion": {"263568": "PDF version"}, "poll": {}, "name": "Timber Rafting Channel", "rpggenre": {"173": "Generic / Universal"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2368018.jpg", "usersrated": "0", "rpgproducer": {"60450": "Christian Hollnbuchner"}, "statistics": {}, "rpg": {"356": "Generic / Universal"}, "average": "0", "rpgcategory": {"2086": "Accessory (dice, maps, screens, cards)"}, "rpgseries": {"18350": "Battlemaps (by Christian Hollnbuchner)"}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2368018_t.jpg", "description": "From publisher blurb:<br/><br/>This full color battlemap is the 234th of a series featuring various terrains.

For such transgression, a fiery death should be the only appropriate response &mdash; but Drakon has decided to toy with you before she devours you. You and your rival heroes will each be released into the labyrinth, and the first hero to discover ten gold pieces will go free with his treasure. The rest of you will satisfy the dragon's hunger.<br/><br/>In every game of Drakon, you and your opponents must fight to stay alive in the midst of the labyrinth. On your turn, you can either move your hero to another room, or add another piece to the labyrinth, placing beneficial chambers in your own path and throwing your opponents into harm's way. But you must be cautious. The chambers of Drakon's labyrinth are filled with danger and ancient magics, not to mention the dragon herself. To navigate these deadly corridors and survive, you&rsquo;ll need to be quick and careful.<br/><br/>On every turn, you have a crucial choice to make. You can either move forward into a new chamber, or you can expand the labyrinth by playing a new chamber tile from your hand. The new chambers that you play feature unique circumstances and magical objects that you may encounter on your adventures through Drakon's lair.<br/><br/>The majority of these chambers offer powerful effects to any hero that enters the chamber. You may gain the power to destroy any chamber in the labyrinth, or call a windstorm to carry you along, increasing your movement. You may even take command of a floating chamber and fly it to the other side of the labyrinth. Other chambers force more harmful effects on those heroes unlucky enough to enter. A room may cause you to lose a coin as you avoid the dangers within, and any hero who hears the siren song of the magical harp is forced to move into its chamber. As you and your fellow heroes play these chambers from your hand, they form a cunning maze, and only the wise can find their way out.<br/><br/>Despite the power of these chambers, the central goal of your quest is to find gold: only by being the first player to claim ten gold can you escape the dungeon. Plenty of chambers allow you to find a coin or steal a coin from an opponent, but the gold value of coins can vary dramatically. Your most recently stolen coin may have a value of three gold or just one. Because coins are kept face-down, hiding their value, you'll never know exactly how close your opponents are to victory.<br/><br/>Six heroes are trapped within Drakon's sadistic labyrinth, and each hero has his own unique abilities to help him survive. Each ability can only be used once per game though, making the timing of the ability incredibly important. You may play as the sorceress and escape from a most dire situation by passing through a wall. You may play as the thief and collect the gold you need at the most opportune moment by preying on another hero. You may even play as the ranger and use a burst of speed to race across the maze when necessary. No matter which hero you play in a game of Drakon, you'll need to take full advantage of your unique ability at the opportune moment if you want to grab the gold and escape from Drakon's clutches.<br/><br/>Of course, the heroes are not alone in the labyrinth. The legendary dragon also stalks the halls and chambers of the maze, taunting any hero unlucky enough to encounter her. Certain chambers throughout the labyrinth allow you to move Drakon through the dungeon. If you can move Drakon into the same chamber as a hapless hero, that hero is immediately sent back to the entrance chamber and loses three coins, as Drakon toys with him before releasing him once more into the maze.<br/><br/>You and your rival heroes are trapped. Your greatest threat may be Drakon or the other heroes. In this dark labyrinth, only one thing can save you: your own greed. Will you ruthlessly grab gold and undermine your opponent&rsquo;s schemes before escaping to victory? Or will you fail and become just another meal for the dragon? You decide your fate, but only one hero can escape from Drakon!<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": {"278245": "Chinese fourth edition"}, "average": "6.61774", "name": "Drakon (fourth edition)", "playingtime": "40", "boardgamemechanic": {"2676": "Grid Movement"}, "age": "10", "usersrated": "461", "boardgamesubdomain": {"5499": "Family Games"}, "boardgamefamily": {"7005": "Animals: Dragons"}}, "171631": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3436417.jpg", "poll": {}, "boardgamedesigner": {"73059": {"name": "Josh Raab"}}, "statistics": {}, "yearpublished": "2014", "maxplayers": "4", "boardgamepublisher": {"597": {"name": "Eagle-Gryphon Games"}}, "maxplaytime": "30", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3436417_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "30", "boardgamecategory": {"1009": {"name": "Abstract Strategy"}}, "description": "This expansion includes new variants of play and a sticker sheet with 24 stickers, 6 stickers for each color, which are attached to the back of the playing pieces.<br/><br/>Variant 1 - Adds a General that may order adjacent pieces to move/rotate as a free action per turn.<br/>Variant 2 - Adds a Hero with the strength &amp; weight of 2 men.<br/>Variant 3 - Adds the Fury that will rout the enemy that routed the Fury.<br/>Variant 4 - Adds a Knight that has a free action of move/rotation per turn.<br/><br/>From the author:<br/><br/>The rules and components needed for various expansions and variants for Nika.<br/><br/>Nika is the ancient Greek word for &ldquo;Conquer!&rdquo; The concept of Nika came to me in a dream while I was studying abroad in Athens.

Greece has many narrow valleys and mountain passes, and sometimes the only way to defeat an enemy force was to collide with them head-on and literally push them off the field. This othismos (&ldquo;shoving&rdquo;) is thought to have been the critical phase of most battles between hoplite armies, who were the heavy infantry that dominated ancient Greek war for four centuries.

The game is player in four phases, each a simple mini-game with different rules, but each building where the other left off. Each phase is roughly ten turns per player. The four phases relate to various godly activities:<br/><br/>Creation - The gods build the game world, using a tile placement mechanism. Each god will place ten, and score points based on number of edges connected and terrain features completed.<br/><br/>Population - Each god has 40 tribes to competitively place on the board, usually 3-5 at a time. The finger of god touches an origin square, and life spreads from it. Terrain features limit how many tribes can fit in an area. Points are scored based on how terrain is filled. This phase feels a little like Go.<br/><br/>Construction - With the world populated, the gods migrate tribes together. When enough are in a square, they build a temple to whichever god has a majority in their stack, and leave the board. Rival tribes are captured and converted by this process.  Points are scored by using tribes to build temples, and by converting rivals' tribes. This feels vaguely like the city building mechanic from Civilization (original).<br/><br/>War! - The world is now full of temples. The gods each have a monster and a hero to summon from their temples on their turn. Monsters seek to defile rival temples, making them more difficult to summon from. Heroes go to fight rival heroes and monsters, or just vandalize a rival temple. Points are scored for slaying, defiling and robbing. This phase can feel like the endgame of Chess.<br/><br/>Each phase has a method of earning bonus points. At the end of the last phase, the gods total their scores to determine a winner.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": {"263620": "First edition"}, "age": "13", "name": "Terrenus: The Game of Gods", "playingtime": "45", "boardgamemechanic": {"2080": "Area Control / Area Influence"}, "average": "7.5", "usersrated": "2", "boardgamefamily": {"22184": "Admin: Unreleased Games"}}, "171657": {"boardgamedesigner": {"42166": {"name": "Todd Sanders"}}, "average": "4", "poll": {}, "name": "Mage Quest", "playingtime": "30", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": {"2080": "Area Control / Area Influence"}, "yearpublished": "2015", "usersrated": "2", "maxplayers": "2", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2378824_t.png", "boardgameartist": {"42166": "Todd Sanders"}, "statistics": {}, "boardgamepublisher": {"4": {"name": "(Self-Published)"}}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2378824.png", "boardgameversion": {"263621": "First Edition"}, "maxplaytime": "30", "boardgamecategory": {"1010": {"name": "Fantasy"}}, "age": "10", "minplaytime": "30", "description": "Long ago in Seven Cities of Gray, two adepts began quests to create libraries of spell books.

This is done by achieving that number and and using it to discard the opponents ring instead of place more of their own (you have to get the number a second time to put your own ring on it). Discarded rings can not be used again meaning that if any player should lose more than 2 rings they can never complete their set and as such can no longer win.

They are often praised for their close bonds with the natural world, and at the same time are responsible for breathtaking and beautiful feats of engineering in their glistening, artistic cities. They are masters of sword and bow, but also great adepts at magic. It seems like there&rsquo;s nothing that an elves aren&rsquo;t good at.<br/><br/>Of course, when you choose to make your player character an elf, all that you really care about is the +2 bonus to your Dexterity and Intelligence scores (and who needs Constitution, anyway?), so why bother playing an elven shaman or bard? Even if a +2 bonus doesn&rsquo;t really make that much of a difference, it just feels so wrong to knowingly combine a race and class that don&rsquo;t go well together, and, as a result, many players never bother to consider it.<br/><br/>This book aims to give players who want the fact that their character is an elf to matter more a way to make that happen, while also providing support for elven characters of a variety of classes that don&rsquo;t typically make much mechanical sense for elves. Included are the elven berserker, a barbarian archetype that turns elves into more primal and savage warriors, the elven lyrist, a bard archetype that allows for classically-trained elves to perform with their skill and prowess instead of their charm and good looks, the willow blade, a fighter archetype that focuses on using the famed elven curve blade, the glade guardian, a ranger archetype for elven rangers who are a bit more in touch with the natural world than most, and the spirit speaker, a shaman archetype for elves in greater communion with the spirit world.<br/><br/>"}, "171710": {"rpg": {"2791": "Pathfinder System Compatible Product"}, "poll": {}, "name": "Arcineum Devaneas I", "rpgproducer": {"68550": "Rachel Meyers"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2370464.jpg", "usersrated": "0", "rpgitemversion": {"263736": "PDF version"}, "average": "0", "statistics": {}, "rpggenre": {"155": "Fantasy (High Fantasy)"}, "rpgcategory": {"2084": "Scenario / Adventure / Module"}, "rpgseries": {"26813": "Dire, Devilish Deeds"}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2370464_t.jpg", "description": "From publisher blurb:<br/><br/>A Pathfinder/3.5 Compatible Adventure for 3-6 PCs of Any Level<br/><br/>Magic weaves its way through everyone's life, whether they realize it or not. Its energy flows all around them, from the simplest cantrip or orison all the way to the mightiest spells that shake worlds. But the one thing that seems stronger than magic itself is the disagreement between those that wield as to whether divine or arcane energies hold sway; this argument has continued since the birth of the gods!<br/><br/>So when two friends, both successfully powerful beyond the dreams of most mortals, decide to spend a few centuries answering this very question, something very special has to be at work. And the testing gauntlets set up by Olemus Multa and Maaginen Jekku are indeed special; ingenuity, cunning, bravery and sharp wits are all required to find a way through these mind-bending passageways, with encounters designed to establish just who does hold the upper hand.<br/><br/>Of course, doing these two spellcasters such a big favor leads to great rewards, so long as the place isn't broken into pieces during events. A party will find that the rewards reflect the PCs&rsquo; level of achievement, as well as turning up after the failure of others. And whilst deaths do occur, the two spellcasters are far more interested in seeing if their use of magical energy gives them a slight upper hand in the endless philosophical debate than they are in having to deal with bodies; resurrections are happily given as part of the deal.

But it will not be easy at all: a strong storm, heavy seas, ice sheets, and several orcas  will complicate the task.<br/><br/>Game inspired by a true story that occurred in 1992. A merchant ship lost in the middle of the ocean 29,000 plastic duckies. The little duckies are still adrift on the seas of the world. The oceanographer Curtis Ebbesmeyer follows their trail since. Thanks to him, nowadays we know more about ocean currents.<br/><br/>OBJECTIVE<br/>in Duckies in Lofoten players are sailors and have to cooperate tile by tile, chosing the correct action dices, in order to build the best strategy. They are not alone, an Icebreaker will help them to fish all the duckies before to be catched by ice.<br/><br/>"}, "171742": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3669427.jpg", "poll": {}, "boardgamedesigner": {"1477": {"name": "Javier Romero"}}, "statistics": {}, "yearpublished": "0", "maxplayers": "0", "boardgameartist": {"11322": "Knut Gr\u00fcnitz"}, "boardgamepublisher": {"3929": {"name": "Compass Games"}}, "maxplaytime": "240", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3669427_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "180", "boardgamecategory": {"1019": {"name": "Wargame"}}, "description": "Lion of Judah: The War for Ethiopia, 1935-1941 is a two-player wargame simulating two campaigns located in the Horn of Africa - Italy vs. Ethiopia in 1935-1936, and the British Commonwealth and Ethiopia vs. Italy in 1940-1941. The scenarios use a common rule set combined with scenario-specific rules. Regular units are mostly divisions, brigades and regiments, while irregular units include warrior levies and tribal bands. Armor, transports, air power, and headquarters (which represent corps-level artillery assets, engineers, and administrative and command centers) are also represented. Lion of Judah has one large-hex map and approximately 400 counters representing Italian, Ethiopian, Commonwealth, French and German units.  In addition to the military units, there are markers to track game and unit status, as well as several Random Event markers used in the historical scenarios for added historical flavor.<br/><br/>Colonial Warfare in Unforgiving Conditions.<br/>The campaigns for Ethiopia were fought in extremely inhospitable terrain. Logistics was one of the key issues of these battles. This is simulated in Lion of Judah by supply counters: everything a modern army requires to operate, from replacements to ammunition to artillery, has to be moved across the harsh terrain. Western units have far more firepower that the Ethiopians, but much lower movement rates. This simulates the &ldquo;safe&rdquo; rate of movement for western units when moving across difficult terrain. They had to move through jungles, mountains and marshes, relying on local guides to move through this mostly-unmapped terrain.  Supplies often had to go by air due to lack of a road network. Western forces may attempt to move at a more &ldquo;normal&rdquo; movement rate (using the &ldquo;Forced march&rdquo; table), but this entails risks: units may get lost, run out of supply, lose their pack mules, or even be ambushed. Unlike the Italians, the Ethiopian army of 1935 was a medieval-style collection of warriors, with little or no central command. This is simulated through activation rules: Ethiopian forces are activated randomly, and some may end up not activating at all during an entire turn! The Italian player may also &ldquo;bribe&rdquo; certain Ethiopian formations into inactivity, as they did historically.<br/><br/>Conventional and Guerrilla Warfare.<br/>Both historical campaigns, have conventional and unconventional warfare. In 1935-36, the Ethiopian army engaged a conventional Italian army in the north and south, while at the same time fighting rebels and tribal guerrillas in the far off corners of the Empire. In 1940-41, it was the Italian Army who had to face both a conventional, professional enemy (the Commonwealth forces) and Ethiopian guerrillas and Commonwealth special forces operating in its rear.<br/>To win, players must successfully manage both kinds of warfare, guerrilla and conventional. When invading Ethiopia in 1935-36, the Italian player must invest resources to encourage trouble within the Ethiopian Empire, recruiting irregulars, bribing and encouraging rebellions. If the Italian player concentrates exclusively on the conventional military front, then the Ethiopian Empire will have a chance to concentrate its armies and achieve a resounding, glorious Adowa-like victory over the Italian invaders.<br/><br/>Similarly, in the 1940-41 campaign the Commonwealth/Ethiopian player must raise rebel forces to force the Italian player to use desperately needed units to defend their lines of communications and cities. Furthermore, the Italian player has an 'Italian Prestige Index', which determines the chance of internal revolts.  He must attack British held territories and outposts as much as possible to keep his Prestige high, especially early in the game before the full might of the Commonwealth army can be brought to bear. The uncertainty regarding Italian defeats in Libya  (handled via event chits) adds further randomness as it is not guaranteed that the British and Indian units that were historically available in January 1941 will arrive in time for the Allied counteroffensive in Ethiopia.<br/><br/>Diplomacy and other Chrome<br/>A random events system similar to that used in The Spanish Civil War 1936-1939 accounts for political and diplomatic events, rebellions in the rear, the arrival of combat units, the purchase of foreign weapons (in the 1935-1936 Scenario) or the arrival of blockade runners to Italian East Africa. Pressure exerted by various political actors is also simulated through events chits: for instance, the event &ldquo;Pressure by Mussolini&rdquo; (1935-36 Scenario), simulates pressure from il Duce when he demanded a rapid advance on to Addis Ababa before he lost the favorable international situation. The Italian player may use chemical weapons, but at the risk of losing Italian Victory Points if the &ldquo;League of Nations&rdquo; event is pulled that turn.<br/><br/>Special units and rules cover the above mentioned Italian chemical warfare, as well as road building, supply dumps, Italian fuel and ammo shortages (1940-1941 scenario), open cities, the Red Sea Flotilla and blockade runners. The countersheet includes exotic units, such as the Somali Camel Corps, the Italo-German motorized company (a German volunteer unit that was recruited among German refugees from Kenya and crews of interned German ships), and Mission 101 or Gideon Force (Orde Wingate&rsquo;s guerrilla force operating in the Italian rear).<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": {"263794": "First edition"}, "age": "0", "name": "Lion of Judah: The War for Ethiopia, 1935-1941", "playingtime": "240", "boardgamemechanic": {"2026": "Hex-and-Counter"}, "average": "6.75", "usersrated": "4", "boardgamefamily": {"22184": "Admin: Unreleased Games"}}, "171743": {"rpg": {"1613": "Myriad"}, "statistics": {}, "name": "The Threshold of Chaos", "rpgproducer": {"43932": "Travis Legge"}, "usersrated": "0", "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2370862.jpg", "rpgitemversion": {"263795": "PDF version"}, "rpgsetting": {"24063": "Glimpse the Beyond"}, "average": "0", "rpggenre": {"848": "Fantasy (Modern Urban Fantasy)"}, "rpgcategory": {"2108": "Sourcebook (rules/options to enhance play)"}, "poll": {}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2370862_t.jpg", "description": "From publisher blurb:<br/><br/>The Threshold of Chaos is an exploration of madness and chaos for use with Glimpse the Beyond.<br/><br/>Great power awaits any Magus brave or foolish enough to court the forces of chaos.

It is an ancient kingdom with a long hereditary line of kings. It and the Empire are the richest and most powerful regions in the known world. Almost anything can be obtained here for a price. Sparkling and dangerous cities rise up in decadence astir with political intrigue. There are major humanoid settlements and border clashes are frequent.<br/><br/>The Kingdom of Peace consists of 14 duchies. Three of the duchies are traditional posts in the line of succession, so the three dukes are the king's closest blood relations. Four others are more distantly related. By law, the Duchy of Singorny, in which the capitol, also Singorny is located, cannot be held by a relative of the king. All other duchies were established based on service to the king. The ruling dynasty has changed hands four times in the kingdom's long history, once as a natural result of the demise of the king's line and thrice usurped. The Duke of Singorny has established a new line in three of these instances, the first legitimately. That is the reasoning behind the law for Singorny not to be a blood relation. However, some argue, especially the king's family for the repeal of this law based on the two usurpations by Singorny. The current king is 11th in his line and the 93rd monarch to sit on the Paxland throne. He has one minor daughter who can accede to the throne only if there are no sons or brothers. The king has one brother who is the First Duke. He also has an older sister who is the Third Duchess.

Control a tribe of stone creatures fighting, mining &amp; building in the heart of an asteroid. 1 to 4 players. Caverns &amp; Crystals is a worker placement game that relies on direct conflict between players as each tries to gather the most resources and build their tribe of Stone Imps to its maximum potential.<br/><br/>The board is made up of six hexagonal cards in a circle representing an asteroid drifting through space. As the game progresses (depending upon the turn cards that are placed in the center)three resources are placed upon the cards: Stone, used for spawning more members of your tribe, Metal, used to beat your opponent into submission and precious power crystals which will win you the game! By tactically placing your Stone Imps onto different Cavern Cards on the board you can dominate an area and ensure it is your imps who bring the crystals home. Be careful however, as somewhere in that asteroid there is a very hungry space squid placed secretly by another player that will devour your tribe and a vacuum that will eject them into space!<br/>Most importantly you have an Imp king leading your tribe who will give your imps a dramatic boost when used with forethought. At the beginning of the turn a set of six cards is passed around to each player who takes one secretly. Each card gives your king a power to use for that turn whether it is sneaking into an opponents home to take their resources or surprising your opponents by teleporting your tribe at the last minute. You will have to think very carefully as you select your card and ponder what your opponents have chosen.       <br/>Caverns &amp; Crystals can even be played Solo where it ceases to be a game of deducing your opponents' actions and becomes an intense puzzle where a player must be as efficient as possible to succeed. The Game Itself comes in a small tin ensuring it remains safe and undamaged between plays.<br/><br/>So do you have what it takes to build your tribe and Rule the Rock!<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "1", "boardgameversion": {"263973": "First edition"}, "age": "10", "name": "Caverns & Crystals: Rule the Rock!", "playingtime": "30", "boardgamemechanic": {"2041": "Card Drafting"}, "average": "4.5", "usersrated": "2", "boardgamefamily": {"22184": "Admin: Unreleased Games"}}, "171853": {"boardgamedesigner": {"79983": {"name": "Robert Oliver Henderson IV"}}, "poll": {}, "name": "Obsession for Murder", "playingtime": "45", "minplayers": "3", "boardgamemechanic": {"2023": "Co-operative Play"}, "yearpublished": "2014", "usersrated": "1", "maxplayers": "6", "average": "3.5", "statistics": {}, "boardgamepublisher": {"2456": {"name": "The Game Crafter, LLC"}}, "boardgameversion": {"263974": "First edition"}, "maxplaytime": "45", "boardgamecategory": {"1023": {"name": "Bluffing"}}, "age": "12", "minplaytime": "45", "description": "You and the other players are patrons at a strange and bizarre open market.

In a matter of a few weeks they rolled up the combined armies of Belgium, France and Great Britain.  The BEF (British Expeditionary Force) and other nearby Allied forces were forced to retreat toward the French coast, resulting in about 400,000 men being surrounded near the town of Dunkirk. Rescue operations commenced to evacuate these forces to England and Winston Churchill, the new Prime Minister of Great Britain, was hopeful that perhaps 30,000 men could be rescued from the trap.  Admiral Sir Bertram Ramsay was put in charge of &ldquo;Operation Dynamo&rdquo;, the goal of which was to send ships of all sizes and shapes to evacuate these beleaguered soldiers from the beaches of France and Belgium.  Through skill, efficient planning and poor German coordination (along with some fortuitous luck), the operation was able to rescue an incredible 330,000 men from the pocket. A true military miracle had been performed and by doing so, the future of the Second World War was forever altered.<br/><br/>Miracle at Dunkerque is essentially a solitaire game, but also includes a two-player option. It is meant to recreate the tense situation within the Dunkirk perimeter during those last eight days in May and June 1940.  The game design aims to capture the spirit of the difficult decision-making challenges faced by Allied commanders as they attempted to extricate the remnants of Britain&rsquo;s last field army from certain capture or death. Historically-based Event Cards drive the action and create varying circumstances each turn. The besieging German forces (army, air and naval units) are controlled by these cards, which are specifically designed to place constant pressure on the player. Allied Player Actions must be allocated each turn for the defense of the perimeter, the creation of evacuee units and the loading of these evacuees from the beaches and moles to available ships and then sailed onward to the safety of England.  You obviously cannot save all the Allied units, so you must choose who stays to fight and who shall attempt to escape in order to continue the struggle against the Nazis another day.<br/><br/>Miracle at Dunkerque is designed by Hermann Luttmann and developed by Paul Fish. Chris Hansen provides additional development and playtesting support. This is the same team that put together the popular game, A Spoiled Victory. However, Miracle at Dunkerque represents a significant enhancement and expansion of that original design concept. The map is more extensive, the player now controls actual naval units that travel back and forth across the English Channel (hopefully loaded with evacuees), more combat units are provided to both sides and the air campaign is now represented. And of course there is the priceless added value of the incredible Legion Wargames production team.

The king's power is flagging, and these powerful lords are vying for control of the various regions. To that end, you draft caballeros (knights in the form of meeples) into your court and subsequently move them onto the board to help seize control of regions. After every third round, the regions are scored, and after the ninth round, the player with the most points is the winner.<br/><br/>In each of the nine rounds, you select one of your 13 power cards to determine turn order as well as the number of caballeros you get to move from the provinces (general supply) into your court (personal supply).<br/><br/>A turn then consists of selecting one of five action cards which allow variations to the rules and additional scoring opportunities in addition to determining how many caballeros to move from your court to one or more of the regions on the board (or into the castillo&mdash;a secretive tower). Normally, you may only place your caballeros into regions adjacent to the one containing the king's pawn. The one hard and fast rule in El Grande is that nothing may move into or out of the king's region. One of the five action cards that is always available each round allows you to move the king to a new region. The other four action cards vary from round to round.<br/><br/>The goal is to have a majority of caballeros in as many regions (and the castillo) as possible during a scoring round. Following the scoring of the castillo, you place any meeples you had stashed there into the region you had secretly indicated on your region dial. Each region is then scored individually according to a table printed in that region.

Over the course of the game, players place kite cards in different parts of the park (that is, the space between wind cards) to try to have the highest valued kite cards on top of the stack, but the first card played in a quadrant determines which cards can be played to that area subsequently.

The trick, though is that the card being placed must be equal to the sum of the card being played on and one of the adjacent cards in the grid.

The aim of the game is to roll as many joints from your boss&rsquo;s stash as possible.<br/>But what fun is that unless you get to dabble in the goods?<br/>By the time the clock hits 4:20am the player with the most J&rsquo;s is declared King of Toke!<br/>Just make sure you stay awake! Take too many puffs and risk &lsquo;greening out&rsquo;.<br/>Move around the apartment, gather Joints, feed the munchies by raiding the refrigerator,<br/>session up in the living room, or strip down and jump in the hot tub. The night is yours!<br/><br/>Setup:<br/>Place the Board in the middle of the table. Place the time marker on the 4:20pm square of the time track.<br/>Shuffle the Kitchen, living room, Hot Tub and Bedroom card decks and place each deck beside the corresponding room on the board.<br/>Place the Joint tokens beside the board in reach of everyone.<br/>Each player chooses a character and takes the corresponding player board and avatar.<br/>The person who&rsquo;s the biggest stoner starts. If you can&rsquo;t decide who that is &ndash; play rock paper scissors to decide.<br/>The Starting player places there character on any room in the house (except the bathroom). In clockwise order each player places their character in any empty room they choose (once again, not the bathroom). Only one player can be in any room at the same time.<br/><br/>How to Play<br/>The starting player takes the 5 dice and rolls them all. They can then put aside any die they wish to keep (this is called &ldquo;locking&rdquo;). The player has 2 rerolls (unless stated otherwise like in &ldquo;The Bedroom&rdquo;) so can roll the dice 3 times in total per turn. After your rerolls you apply your results.<br/>Each Turn Consists of<br/>Resolve room power on board if it states &ldquo;Start of Turn&rdquo;<br/>Roll all Dice. Put aside any dice you wish to keep (All clock dice are automatically &ldquo;locked&rdquo; &ndash; see below)<br/>Reroll (this is optional) any dice up to 2 times except &ldquo;locked&rdquo; dice. They must be put aside.<br/>Resolve dice (see below for results and order)<br/> The Dice Results are as follows<br/><br/>    J = Take one J token (1 per J)<br/>    M = Move. You must move to another location in the apartment. If it is occupied by another player they must move to your location as only one player per room is allowed. If 2 M&rsquo;s are rolled you do not move and must take a card from the room deck you are in. If 3 M&rsquo;s are rolled and you have no rerolls left you must move to the bathroom square. Your turn is over and disregard any other dice results except clock rolls. (do not collect J&rsquo;s or dish out puffs)<br/>    C= Clock. Time passes and for every C rolled the time marker moves one square up. Every C rolled is instantly &ldquo;locked&rdquo;. You cannot reroll any C results (unless a card states otherwise).<br/>    P= Puff. All other players take a puff and must move their awake marker up one square on their player boards.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Order in a turn<br/>When applying results, do so in the following order.<br/>1               IF you have 3 &ldquo;M&rsquo;s&rdquo; Proceed directly to bathroom , Ignore all other dice except clocks this turn. Advance clock if applicable and your turn ends.<br/>2               Take all J&rsquo;s<br/>3               Everyone else takes Puffs<br/>4               Move or take room card and resolve (if applicable)<br/>5               Advance clock<br/>6               End your turn. Pass dice to player on your left<br/> <br/>Bathroom:<br/>Nature called and you had to go to the bathroom. Damn, the locks broken.. How the hell do you get out you ask?! Getting stuck in the bathroom is no fun at all.<br/>As soon as you enter the bathroom lose 5 J&rsquo;s (they fell in!)<br/>Roll dice as usual but.....Bathroom rolls are a bit different<br/>No&rdquo; J&rdquo; results count when rolling dice, you can still make the others take puffs and the clock still ticks on as normal.<br/><br/>Escaping the Bathroom:<br/>The only way out of the bathroom space (unless you have a card)  is by rolling and &ldquo;locking&rdquo; 2 &ldquo;M&rsquo;s&rdquo;. You must then go to any empty room in the house and play on as normal. If you have any rerolls left this turn you may continue to roll unlocked dice. Resolve dice normally at the end of your turn (ignoring the 2 &ldquo;M&rsquo;s&rdquo; used to escape the bathroom).<br/> Time / Awake Tracks / Game End<br/>If any players awake track hits &ldquo;white out&rdquo; that player has fallen asleep and is out of the game. If all other players fall asleep the last player awake is the winner.<br/>As soon as the time track hits 4:20am the game is over. All awake players add up their J&rsquo;s and the stoner with the most wins! If that is also tied the most awake stoner wins....<br/>If both J&rsquo;s and Awake are tied..... geeeze?!?
