An illusion fabricated to keep humanity at bay and prevent our awakening. Behind its facade something vaster and darker awaits - the true reality. Where heaven and hell fights to replace a vanishing god who may be dead. Humans are pulled into that Struggle as the illusion crumbles. Weakened by time and humanity&rsquo;s lost faith. More and more people gain the ability to see beyond the illusion and start disbelieving old truths. The laws of nature prove to be weaker than what we once thought. Magic is a reality, and nothing turns out to be what it seems.<br/><br/>Kult is a contemporary fiction universe set in the world of large, dark, industrial cities. A world where human wickedness mingles with terror from other parts of a true, unseen reality. Sensitive people are crushed by the anonymity of the cities, and become psychotics. Under the surface, primitive passions are still held at bay by the morality of past civilizations growing and festering until they erupt in sick Perversions.<br/><br/>But human darkness is not all that threatens. The evil that humans do corrodes the boundaries of reality and admits creatures from the other side. Our dreams assume physical form and chase us. Creatures from the past are reborn into the present, to re-arrange our lives. Our own fear gives birth to beings that threaten to devour us. Occult teachings can be used to establish openings into different worlds, and tap power from the unknown, but few if any humans realize the truth about the powers they conjure up. Sooner or later, they are all consumed by demons they cannot control.<br/><br/>Kult is a complete role-playing system written in four detailed sections. This second American edition features a more streamlined system and book for quicker and more enjoyable play.<br/><br/>The Lie: This section helps players create detailed and unique characters with the use of advantages, disadvantages, dark secrets, and plenty of skills. Players are provided archetypes and a simplified character generation system so they can jump right into the game with little effort.

It includes such locales as the Font of Dreams, the Domain of the Venom Cult, the Prison of the Red Saint, the Aberrant Laboratory, the Sprawl of the Demon Leige, and the Secret City. It offers weird and wild encounters with the Bestial Host, the Insidious Kings, swarm-demon Czarzem the Wicked, and the Prince of Dragons. It holds treasures and secrets like the Twelve Secret Sigils, Sao's Bones, and the mystical wendways. But the adventure includes much more than just a dungeon. Dungeonaday.com also describes the surrounding area (filled with intriguing ruins), the nearby town of Brindenford (which is far more involved in the goings-on than it first appears), side trips to a mysterious island and an extradimensional tesseract, and forays into strange other planes.<br/><br/>"}, "50025": {"rpgitemversion": {"5747": "Hard Cover"}, "statistics": {}, "name": "Kult \"Rumours\"", "rpgproducer": {"13038": "Terry Amthor"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic521416.jpg", "usersrated": "3", "average": "5.66667", "rpggenre": {"441": "Horror (Supernatural)"}, "rpg": {"973": "Kult (3rd Edition)"}, "rpgcategory": {"2083": "Core Rules (min needed to play)"}, "poll": {}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic521416_t.jpg", "description": "From cover:<br/><br/>We are unlikely heroes.

First comes the Dungeon Master's map, with encounter information and background on the revers.  This map is for the DM only and should not be shown to the players.  The second map is a handout for the players' use and generally serves to lead the player characters into the adventure.  It features a full-color map on one side; on the reverse is a brief description of the map's condition (medium, texture, age, state of preservation, and the like).  The players' map may also list rumors regarding the map - why it exists, what treasures it leads to, its probable veracity, and the legends regarding the fates of previous owners.  Some of these rumors contain clues to finding the treasures or avoiding deadly traps that await the unwary.<br/><br/>The maps contain herein are not based in any particular world, setting, or campaign in TSR's arsenal and can easily be adapted to any campaign world.&quot;<br/><br/>From the back cover:<br/><br/>&quot;Hunt for lost gold, powerful magic items, and even greater treasure!<br/><br/>Treasure Maps contains 16 separate adventures that will take player characters from mountaintops to the ocean depths.

But beware! The greater the treasure-hoard, the greater the danger from its guardians.<br/><br/>Each adventure comes with two beautifully rendered full-color maps, one for the players and one for the DUNGEON MASTER.

Auf eine neuartige, &uuml;bersichtliche Weise pr&auml;sentiert und wie bereits beim Necronomicon (fast) authentisch bebildert, d&uuml;rfen sie in einem Band &uuml;ber Magie selbstverst&auml;ndlich nicht fehlen. Einige von ihnen werden sogar in Form fiktiver Mythosbuchausz&uuml;ge geschildert, die der Spielleiter direkt in seinem Abenteuer einsetzen kann.<br/><br/>Doch eine Publikation &uuml;ber Magie gerade f&uuml;r Cthulhu sollte sich nicht darin ersch&ouml;pfen. Denn cthuloide Magie entscheidet sich stark von der Magie, die man aus vielen Fantasy-Rollenspielen kennt. Magie in Cthulhu erfordert meist einen hohen Einsatz und kann leicht der erste Schritt zum Wahnsinn sein. Andererseits sind ihre Auswirkungen mitunter gewaltig, so dass man mit ihr in einem Cthulhu-Abenteuer behutsam umgehen sollte. So k&ouml;nnen bei Cthulhu Wesenheiten herbeigerufen werden, deren Anblick selbst f&uuml;r die geistig stabilsten Menschen zuviel ist. Darum geht es in den Arcana Cthulhiana ebenso wie um die Frage, was cthuloide Magie ist und was sie so besonders macht. Aber auch zahlreichen weiteren Fragen gehen wir nach, wie etwa, welches Beiwerk f&uuml;r cthuloide Zauber &uuml;blich und n&uuml;tzlich ist und wie man eigene Zauber kreiert, ohne das Spielgleichgewicht zu zerst&ouml;ren.<br/><br/>Magie gibt es nicht wirklich in unserer Welt (auch wenn jetzt einige von euch entt&auml;uscht sein werden &hellip;), aber das hat viele Menschen in der irdischen Geschichte nicht daran gehindert, sich mit Magie oder Okkultismus zu befassen. In vielen Kulturen gab und gibt es seit Jahrtausenden magische Riten, die oftmals von religi&ouml;sen Praktiken nicht zu unterscheiden sind. Wie liefen diese Riten ab, und gibt es Parallelen zum Cthulhu-Mythos? Wie haben sich Alchimisten und Okkultisten im Mittelalter verhalten, wie &bdquo;funktioniert&ldquo; Voodoo?<br/><br/>Wir widmen uns der Kabbala und besuchen &bdquo;magische&ldquo; Orte, die es wirklich gibt und die sich als Ritualschaupl&auml;tze und Orte der Kraft besonders eignen. Das Ganze wird wieder garniert mit zahlreichen Abenteuerideen, so dass der Spielleiter bereits beim Lesen ein Bild bekommt, wie er die Informationen in diesem Band direkt im Abenteuer einsetzen kann. Eine Rahmengeschichte sorgt schlussendlich daf&uuml;r, dass der Band wirklich wie der Foliant eines Eingeweihten &uuml;ber Magie wirkt.<br/><br/>"}, "50209": {"rpg": {"201": "GURPS (3rd Edition)"}, "statistics": {}, "name": "GURPS Mars", "rpgproducer": {"390": "Scott Haring"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic522472.jpg", "usersrated": "7", "rpgitemversion": {"50052": "PDF version"}, "average": "7.42857", "rpgissuearticle": {"57958": "Martian Tech"}, "rpggenre": {"940": "Action / Adventure"}, "rpgcategory": {"2107": "Campaign Setting (game world)"}, "poll": {}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic522472_t.jpg", "description": "A look at mars from almost every possible gaming angle, from the history of the red planet and how it figured into mysticism and alchemy to modern exploration.<br/><br/>Includes four different campaign settings:<br/><br/>Domed Mars &ndash; a scientifically accurate setting of Mars colonization in the near future<br/><br/>Terraformed Mars &ndash; Mars in the future as in a general science fiction campaign.<br/><br/>Superscience Mars &ndash; Mars straight out of B-movies.<br/><br/>Dying Mars &ndash; Classic pulp science fiction stories come to life.<br/><br/>"}, "50210": {"rpgitemversion": {"5941": "Soft Cover"}, "rpgseries": {"16857": "Vehicle Compendium"}, "name": "Northern Vehicles Compendium One: Gears & Striders", "rpgproducer": {"14199": "Pierre Ouellette"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic538404.jpg", "usersrated": "3", "rpgsetting": {"6133": "Terra Nova"}, "average": "6.66667", "rpgissuearticle": {"187850": "Capsule Reviews"}, "rpg": {"1179": "Heavy Gear (1st & 2nd Editions)"}, "poll": {}, "statistics": {}, "rpgcategory": {"2108": "Sourcebook (rules/options to enhance play)"}, "rpggenre": {"3712": "Mecha"}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic538404_t.jpg", "description": "From the back of the book:<br/>The Vehicle Compendium series showcase the most common pieces of vehicular equipment used by the armed forces of Terra Nova in the 62nd century.

Designed and written by the same design team (under the guidance of author Margaret Weis), this volume gives players everything they need to play in any Fifth Age campaign-including during and after the War of Souls itself.<br/><br/>Age of Mortals contains an update on the races of Ansalon, many new prestige classes, feats, equipment, magical items, and spells. It details many important potential adventuring locations in great detail, as well as mighty dragons and many important characters of the era.<br/><br/>"}, "50252": {"rpgitemversion": {"188161": "PDF version"}, "rpgseries": {"4530": "Secrets of..."}, "name": "Secrets of Kenya", "rpgproducer": {"28": "Charlie Krank"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic522405.jpg", "usersrated": "15", "rpgsetting": {"2572": "Cthulhu Classic (1920s & 1930s)"}, "average": "6.76667", "statistics": {}, "rpg": {"347": "Call of Cthulhu (1st Edition)"}, "poll": {}, "rpgcategory": {"2108": "Sourcebook (rules/options to enhance play)"}, "rpggenre": {"988": "Horror (Cthulhu Mythos)"}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic522405_t.jpg", "description": "From the publisher's website:<br/><br/>The Mythos Roams Wild<br/><br/>AFRICA: Long known as the Dark Continent, Africa strikes fear in the hearts of civilized Westerners for its savage tribes, fierce animals, impenetrable jungles, vast deserts, lost civilizations, slave traders, contagious diseases &mdash; and the unknown.<br/><br/>Africa is &ldquo;dark&rdquo; because it is a mystery. It is the least understood, most dangerous, poorest, and least explored of the six inhabited continents. Disease, beast, and savage pose effective barriers to exploration. A scarcity of navigable rivers means that the only way to chart the interior savanna, jungle, and desert is to walk. Accurate maps of the Dark Continent must wait until the end of the nineteenth century.<br/><br/>Now this mysterious place is opening to the Western world. Railways begin to connect cities. New medicines keep explorers from dropping dead before they make their discoveries. Settlements where crops can be grown are being established in the interior. Africa is becoming accessible, yet much remains mysterious and still very dangerous.<br/><br/>In America and Europe the Cthulhu Mythos hides in cellars, old houses, crumbling castles, and forgotten caves. In Africa it roams wild, hunting in the wilderness and thriving in lost cities. Cults worshipping the Mythos are more prominent here, and the extent of their powers is vast.<br/><br/>SECRETS OF KENYA introduces a portion of this vast and varied continent &mdash; three times the size of the United States, with a ratio of four Africans to every American alive during this era. Kenya provides a setting that can be both familiar and foreign. Settled by Great Britain in the 1900&rsquo;s it is an English-speaking colony where all the trappings of home can be found in the capital of Nairobi. Beyond Nairobi&rsquo;s limits, much of Kenya remains unexplored and virgin territory for investigations, and hidden horrors.<br/><br/>The first half of this book provides a civil, cultural, political, geographical, and Mythos tour of Kenya during the 1920&rsquo;s and 1930&rsquo;s, the remainder offers four longer adventures using this background. The majority of the material in this book is factual, though locations have been elaborated on for game play. Familiar resources such as police files, newspapers, libraries, and museums are harder to come by. When they are present, diminished resources are all that investigators can expect.<br/><br/>"}, "50253": {"boardgamedesigner": {"3": {"name": "(Uncredited)"}}, "poll": {}, "name": "Greedy Greedy", "playingtime": "10", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": {"2072": "Dice Rolling"}, "yearpublished": "2009", "usersrated": "8", "maxplayers": "6", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic542746_t.jpg", "average": "4.75", "statistics": {}, "boardgamepublisher": {"10197": {"name": "High Point Games"}}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic542746.jpg", "maxplaytime": "10", "boardgamecategory": {"1002": {"name": "Card Game"}}, "age": "8", "minplaytime": "10", "description": "GreedyGreedy is a card and dice game that is fun for the whole family.

Joined by Marcus Wands (also known as &quot;Marco Volo&quot;), they found him just a bothersome but likeable little rogue. No one suspected he was on the run from the crazy wizard Sabbar. The troublesome Marcus had previously stolen from him a rare artifact called the Dragonking's Eye, and hid it in the Spiderhaunt Woods.<br/><br/>Now the party approaches the Spiderhaunts, and Marcus insists on diverting the group to retrieve the Eye.

The player characters must face - and deal with - the mad wizard Sabbar, the annoyed Volothamp Geddarm (who wants to have &quot;a little chat&quot; with Marcus!), and ultimately the Dragonking's Eye itself.

Each player holds a hand of ten white answer cards at the beginning of each round, and passes a card (sometimes two) to the Card Czar, face-down, representing their answer to the question on the card. The card czar determines which answer card(s) are funniest in the context of the question or fill-in-the-blank card. The player who submitted the chosen card(s) is given the question card to represent an &quot;Awesome Point&quot;, and then the player to the left of the new Card Czar becomes the new Czar for the next round. Play continues until the players agree to stop, at which point the player with the most Awesome Points is the winner.<br/><br/>This, so far, sounds like the popular and fairly inoffensive Apples to Apples. While the games are similar, the sense of humor required is very different. The game encourages players to poke fun at practically every awkward or taboo subject including race, religion, gender, poverty, torture, alcoholism, drugs, sex (oh yes), abortion, child abuse, celebrities, and those everyday little annoyances like &quot;Expecting a burp and vomiting on the floor&quot;.<br/><br/>In addition, there are a few extra rules.  First, some question cards are &quot;Pick 2&quot; or cards, which require each participant to submit two cards in sequence to complete their answer. Second, a gambling component also exists.  If a question is played which a player believes they have two possible winning answers for, they may bet an Awesome Point to play a single second answer.  If the player who gambled wins, they retain the wagered point, but if they lose, the player who contributed the winning answer takes both points.<br/><br/>From the website:<br/><br/>&quot;Cards Against Humanity is distributed under a Creative Commons Attribution-Noncommercial-Share Alike license - that means you can use and remix the game for free, but you can't sell it.

Honorless koku-grubbers who prey upon human weakness. The vendors and dealers of the Emerald Empire have always been sneered at by the powerful nobles above them. But times change, and the value of koku has risen more than most would care to believe. While still hampered by class and social position, the merchants have gained power of their own - power that even a samurai would balk at. From the opulent palaces of the Crane to the distant steppes of the Unicorn, they ply their wares: changing fortunes with every deal and controlling fate in ways no warrior ever could. Can your honor resist the call of cold, hard cash?<br/><br/>The Merchant's Guide to Rokugan has everything players and GMs need to know about this deeply underestimated class, from the secrets of the Unicorn caravans to the unseen influence of the Yasuki traders. It contains an updated history of the Emerald Empire, details on merchant character creation and campaign running, and the untold stories of the Crane-Yasuki wars, including the tale of Taka himself. So step up to the vendor's stall and peruse the wares you see: a whole new side of Rokugan awaits.<br/><br/><br/>    SPOILER*<br/><br/><br/>The back cover copy for this supplement is in fact a lie.
