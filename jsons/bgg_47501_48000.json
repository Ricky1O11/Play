However, experimental versions of Southern Cross Mecha can be made available.  For details and modifiers, see the Game Master Section in the back of the book.  To simplify the general description, no characters or Mecha that were not outlined in the initial ROBOTECH Role-Playing Game book are used in this book.  If someone would like to change this campaign to include other armor or O.C.C. classes, it should be noted that much of the mecha in later supplements are MUCH more powerful than that of Macross.<br/><br/>the adventure is moderately difficult, designed for a party of between three and six players.  More players can participate, although the group may get a bit unwieldy or the game master may have to beef up the antagonists.

But it had its lighter side, too. It involved many pleasant days spent watching actual matches - recording every single detail of the games so that Card Cricket would be as authentic as possible.<br/><br/>Equipment:<br/>i) Two packs of cards as follows: <br/>a) Bowling pack (110 cards)<br/>b) Batting pack (108 cards)<br/>ii) A scoring pad which resembles an ordinary cricket score book<br/>iii) A special die - 5 faces showing out and 1 face showing 'not out'.<br/>iv) A chart showing by means of asterisks which batting shots can be played against the various types of balls that can be bowled<br/>v) A loose scoring sheet which serves as an example of how to score with instructions printed on the back.<br/><br/>This is a mechanically simple cricket simulation game. You are expected to 'know' cricket (but why else would you be playing it?), and thus how to arrange and score matches, etc. Each player plays one team (obviously if more than two people are playing the game, they can take the part of different players in the cricket match).<br/><br/>The mechanism is one of hand management. The bowler picks 6 random cards for the balls in the over, which he can play in any order. The batsman has a number of batting cards which varies according to which number he is batting at. The bowler plays a card (a ball) and the batsman plays a card against that ball. If the batting card is a valid stoke for that ball (a cover drive for a half volley outside off stump, a sweep to a googly, etc), then the outcome is as printed on the batting card sometimes runs, but often just fielded. If the batting card is not a valid stroke for the ball bowled, then the batsman is likely to be out (there are appeals and not outs using the die). If he is not out, the batsman replenishes his hand, and the next ball is bowled.<br/><br/>"}, "47620": {"rpgdesigner": ["Sean Boyle"], "rpgitemversion": ["PDF Version", "Soft Cover"], "poll": [], "name": "LUCID: Dreamscape Reality", "rpgartist": ["Sean Boyle", "Adrian Reece", "Neil Weber"], "rpgproducer": ["Sean Boyle"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic513735.jpg", "usersrated": "0", "average": "0", "statistics": [], "rpg": ["HDL Universal Tactical Role-playing System"], "rpgpublisher": ["Tremorworks"], "rpgcategory": ["Campaign Setting (game world)"], "rpggenre": ["Horror", "Modern", "Weird / Surreal"], "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic513735_t.jpg", "description": "Opening one&rsquo;s eyes after falling asleep can mean different things to different people.

P. Lovecraft<br/><br/>Creatures, Gods, &amp; Forbidden Knowledge<br/>Here are those things which can &quot;eternal lie&quot;, and which have lived beyond human understanding for strange aeons.

While humanity might crave comfort and truth, only one or the other is possible.<br/><br/>This tome contains entries for more than 380 different creatures and beings that are part of the Cthulhu Mythos, presented for use with the CALL OF CTHULHU roleplaying game.

Except for Nyarlathotep, these gods have little to do with humanity.<br/><br/>ELDER GODS are neutral to or possibly rivals to the Outer Gods. Though vast and of awesome power, they do not seem to be as dangerous to humanity as the Outer Gods.<br/><br/>GREAT OLD ONES are not omnipotent, but nonetheless are godlike and terrible in human eyes. Humans are likely to worship Great Old Ones, who are comparatively near at hand.<br/><br/>GREAT ONES are the gods of Earth&rsquo;s Dreamlands. Do not confuse them with the Great Old Ones. They are the weakest of all the deity types, and a wise mortal can surpass them in might.<br/><br/>AVATARS are variant manifestations of an Outer God, Great Old One, Elder God, or Great One. Usually less powerful than the gods they represent, many are more horrible to witness.<br/><br/>SOME ENTRIES introduce unique entities, defying classification. RACES INDEPENDENT of and serving no particular deity are included, though individuals may worship, cooperate, or co-conspire with such beings. FABULOUS CREATURES are well represented, drawn from legend and lore.

It's the most realistic and excitingly detailed  simulation of the Canadian pro game that's ever been created!<br/><br/>With COLD SNAP, you can bring back &quot;the good old days&quot; of Canadian pro football, or, re-live last year's exciting pro season! ANY time is &quot;football season&quot; when you've got a copy of COLD SNAP on your game shelf! YOU call the plays, YOU set the defensive alignments, YOU decide who to bring in when a star player goes down with an injury. Think you can do a better job with your favorite Canadian pro team than the real-life coach did? Well, now you can find OUT! (HINT: you might just gain a new respect for the real-life coach!)<br/><br/>Recent years have seen a glut of new football games hit the market. Many of them are very good. But two key differences make COLD SNAP Canadian Pro Football simulation board game stand out above the crowd of pro football simulation board games...<br/><br/>FIRST, this is a pro football game where EVERY player on the field matters. In many other games, defenders and linemen are treated almost as an afterthought--some games don't even rate them at ALL! But in COLD SNAP, the success or failure of a play most often HINGES on the performance of these players! Yes, the star Canadian passers and runners will stand out on your table-top--but so will the star interior linemen, linebackers and defensive backs! It's exciting to watch!<br/><br/>SECOND, the COLD SNAP results book is cleverly designed to tell you not only WHAT happens on every play, but also WHY! Other games might tell you, for example, that the quarterback just threw an incomplete pass--and that's all the information you get. However, the COLD SNAP results book will tell you whether the incompletion was the result of great coverage by a defensive back, a hurried throw thanks to a missed block by an offensive lineman, a wrong pass route run by the receiver, or any of a multitude of other possible reasons! You'll know what DID happen, AND what MIGHT have happened, if not for the play made or NOT made. It's just like watching pro football on TV, with the game book serving as your color commentator!<br/><br/>COLD SNAP Canadian Pro Football simulation board game is incredibly detailed, yet easy to play. The offense coach chooses a ball carrier or intended receiver for one of six basic offense plays, while the defense coach secretly decides on one of four basic color-coded defense settings. (You can play solitaire, too--there are rules included for that!) Roll the dice, look up the result in the game book, record the gain or loss, and move on to the next play!

In the same way, the Blue Rose Companion provides optional rules to supplement the rules in Blue Rose. This book offers new options for creating heroes, from detailed heroic paths to new feats and arcane abilities. It provides game systems for arcane rituals, places of power, and creating arcane items. It also offers a selection of new arcane items and an expanded bestiary of monsters for your heroes to fight.<br/><br/>The Blue Rose Companion is broken down into four chapters:<br/><br/>Chapter I: Heroic Roles looks at hero creation and things your heroes can accomplish. It begins with a section of heroic paths, different archetypes for the three heroic roles of adept, expert, and warrior. If you want to create a thief, swashbuckler, spirit dancer, or merchant, this section shows you ways to do it quickly and easily.<br/><br/>Chapter II: Heroic Abilities offers new things heroes can do with their various skills and new feats to round out a hero&rsquo;s capabilities.<br/><br/>Chapter III: The Arcane Arts expands on the arcana system in Blue Rose. The chapter provides advanced uses of existing arcana, like Mind Touch and Mind Shaping; some new arcana; and new game systems. It includes systems for arcane rituals and crafting arcane items, along with a selection of premade arcane items you can use in your games.<br/><br/>Chapter IV: Advanced Bestiary offers additional fantastic and dangerous creatures to challenge your heroes. It includes new types of creatures, like vermin (from swarms to giant insects), and it introduces creature templates, ways of modifying existing creatures to create new ones, such as all kinds of unliving creatures.<br/><br/>With these expanded tools in your hands, you are ready to take your character on new and even more exciting adventures in the world of Aldea.<br/><br/>FOR ALDIS!

The cement torw at his knees and the plams of his hands. Blinking back tears, he climbed to his feet. Through a nearby viewport he could see the huge Kafer battleship approaching, its bulk blotting out the stars.<br/><br/>&quot;There's nowhere left to run.&quot; It amazed him how calml he could accept that. &quot;Sixteen years old, and I'm going to die.&quot; Suddenly, his surroundings took on a special clarity. He could hear the hum of the overheard lights, smell the smoke from far down the hall. He noticed the laser scars on the Kafer battleship where the defense systems had destroyed a gun tower. As he watched, a jack turret opened, and the inside began to glow red as its power built toward discharge. There was a sudden flash of light.&quot;<br/><br/>The Past<br/><br/>In 2295, humans and Kafers first met. Kafer ships discovered a human research facility orbiting Arcturus. The humans sent radio messages to the aliens but received no reply. Then, suddenly, without warning, the Kafers left the system.<br/><br/>Station personnel reported the alien contact to Terran officials and, regretting the lost opportunity to establish relations, continued to study the star. Two years later, reports from the Arcturus system ceased.<br/><br/>Early in 2298, Kafer ships swarmed into the Eta Bootis system and, driving away the human space fleet, began an attack on the Eta Bootian colony world, Aurore. The aliens destroyed the world's orbital facilities and landed ground troops on the planet.<br/><br/>Human space forces reentered the system with reinforcement from nations cooperating in the attack, and by 2299, the alien felt was driven back. Then the humans fell back to Eta Bootis where a defensive line could be established. An uneasy silence settled on the Frontier. No one knew when the enemy might attack again.<br/><br/>The Present<br/><br/>It is now 2301. The human fleet at Eta Bootis has been waiting at the alert for two years. While its leader have bickered over protocol and jockeyed for command of the combined fleet, individual ship crews have grown lax in performing practice exercises and routine duties.<br/><br/>But the Kafers have been busy. The remnants of the small force that originally attacked the humans have reported back to Kafer war leaders, and the combined might of all the Kafer nations has been assigned to invade human space. Theur goal is nothing short of the eradication of the human race.<br/><br/>The Future<br/><br/>The survival of the human race is in jeopardy. Its fate lies not only in the hands of its armies and navies, but also in the hands of its civilian populations. In Invasion, player characters can experience the course of the Kafer assault on the French Arm, but they can also take an active part in the human defense efforts, no matter what career they have been trained in. The final fate of worlds may well depend upon their actions.<br/><br/>Invasion describes the course of the Kafer campaign, from the initial assault on Hochbaden to the final, climactic battle at Queen Alice's Star. Along the way it treats each colony world in an individual chapter, explainig the particular effects of the invasion on that world. Both space battles and ground battles are described, with role-playing adventures and even official Star Cruiser scenarios included.

This free-wheeling adventure begins with an intrigue-laden journey from Waterdeep to Shadowdale. The party is thrown into the company of one Marcus Wands (also known as &quot;Marco Volo&quot;), a bothersome but likeable little rogue. In his guise as Marco, he gains unintentional help from the party members, leading only to their own arrests. To remedy that predicament, the characters are strong-armed into carrying an important letter to Shadowdale, and taking along Marcus as their &quot;guide.&quot;<br/><br/>Of course, things are nowhere near as simple as they seem.<br/><br/>There's this little matter of the Dragonking's Eye, a powerful artifact from another plane. Naively, Marcus thought he could steal the thing and pin the theft on Volothamp Geddarm, the roguish author of many popular books about cities in the Realms. The notorious mage-assassin Felibarr Blacklance has been hired to hunt for the thief, and he is a man grimly determined to earn his fee.<br/><br/>Then, there's this business about this letter that's on its way to Shadowdale. It is accompanied by a rare enchanted item that wizards and fortune hunters want to obtain at all costs.<br/><br/>A series of adventures ensues that takes the adventurers from Waterdeep to the Way Inn, by which time they will doubtless suspect there is more to Marco Volo than meets the eye. Amid the brawls and mistaken identities, the wild rides and the glowering villains, the characters never have a chance to slow down or catch their collective breath. What results is a light-hearted, picaresque adventure in the manner of Dumas and Sabatini, and a good time is had by all!<br/><br/>(Except by the bad guys, of course.

It's enough to make a sod long for a pit fiend.<br/><br/>Liven up any PLANESCAPE or AD&amp;D campaign with the MOSNTROUS COMPENDIUM Appendix III, which features 128 pages of monsters that lurk on the Inner Planes, the Astral Plane, and the Ethereal Plane - some of the strangest and most inhospitable environments in the multiverse. Most of the critters are brand new, though a few old favorites have been updated. This book also provides a detailed look at the ecology of the planes in question, not to mention an appendix of inner-planar creatures that're more like animals than monsters. And, of course, all-new illustrations vividly bring each of these exotic beings to life.<br/><br/>"}, "47923": {"rpgartist": ["Bob Charrette", "Jeff Dee"], "rpgitemversion": ["PDF Version", "Saddle Stapled (modules/pamphlets)"], "poll": [], "name": "The Terran Sector", "rpgdesigner": ["Edward E.

The generalized point system would eventually be published as the Hero System.<br/><br/>Ad copy:<br/><br/>From the frozen tops of the Himalayas to the steamy jungles of the Amazon.  The pulps and serials live again in the action packed world of the '20s and '30s.  Justice, Inc. includes all the campaign information you need to give your game a &quot;period&quot; feel, we've even included a slang dictionary!  The game includes special rules for Weird Talents, Psychic Powers, and super-scientific gizmos.  Play the &quot;original&quot; Super Hero game.  Live the adventure with Justice, Inc.<br/><br/>User Note:<br/>This boxed set contained two books: The main rulebook (96 pages) and the Justice Inc. Campaign Book (79 pages) with information on the setting. It also contained three dice.&quot;<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;Justice,_Inc._(role-playing_game),&quot; available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/><br/>From the preface<br/><br/>Welcome to the world of pulp adventure! Justice Inc. takes you to the world of the 1920s and '30s, where you and your friends will experience the action and excitement of those times. Justice Inc. shows you how to experience different types of stories, including Horror, Adventure, Mystery, Espionage, Romance, Science Fiction, and more.<br/><br/>Justice Inc. is another game in the Hero System series; previous games include Champions (super hero role-playing) and Danger International (modern role-playing, formerly known as Espionage!). These games all use the same basic character creation and combat system; once you've learned how to play one of them, you know how to play all of them. So at certain places in these rules, you'll see reference to these other games. It isn't necessary for you to own Champions and Danger International in order to play Justice Inc., but if you want more material that you can use for Justice Inc. You should look into the rest of the Hero System series. More games will be coming out in the future.<br/><br/>The authors (that's use) hope you enjoy this game. We've put a lot of time and effort into this project, because we've enjoyed pulp stories for many years. We hope you'll find out why we love the pulps by playing Justice Inc.; that is, if you aren&rsquo;t one of the people who already loves the pulps.

This variation adds the ends of the dominoes to make a multiple of five for scoring. Five-up is very similar to other games such as All Fives, Muggins, and Sniff.<br/><br/>In Five-up, each player starts out with five dominoes in their hand, and the first player can play any domino in their hand.  Thereafter, each player must play a domino from their hand if they can match it to a domino end on the table.  If they cannot play a domino from their hand, they must draw from the &quot;boneyard&quot; until they can play a domino on the tableau.  If the ends of the dominoes add up to a multiple of five, the player adding the domino scores one (1) point for each multiple of five (5) (IE: if the ends added up to ten (10), the player would score two (2) points).  The first player that plays their last domino from their hand, adds up the count remaining in their opponent's hand and scores the total divided by five (5) (IE: if the opponent had a count of fifteen (15) in their hand, the scorer would score three (3) points).<br/><br/>Five-up is played to a score of 61, and is usually played with a Cribbage board to keep score.<br/><br/>Five-up is unique in that every double domino played is a possible &quot;spinner,&quot; and plays can be played on all four sides of a &quot;spinner.&quot;<br/><br/>The rules for Five-Up were standardized and popularized in the 60's by Dominic C. Armanino, who wrote at least four books on Dominoes. He was a strong advocate and PR agent for this version of the game.
