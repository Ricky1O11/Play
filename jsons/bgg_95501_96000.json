With powers of reason and democracy forged in the fires of a brutal sectarian past, the Academy has become a peaceful, powerfully inquisitive people.<br/><br/>Their first steps to the civilizations of other solar systems are the Contactors &mdash; institution-starcraft sent from Earth and filled with a hundred eager and self-organized individuals. Their long lives devoted to the study of language, religion, archaeology, anthrozo&ouml;logy, and a million sub-fields of the sciences of people, they are swarming the galaxy looking for their long lost siblings, cousins, and parents.<br/><br/>Their faith in reason and their own intellectual prowess is challenged at every colony they encounter as they learn about the ethics, histories, and biologies of the rest of homininkind. Where they go to find friends and relatives, they invariably find something much more complex &mdash; lovers, challengers, rivals.<br/><br/>Sciences and technologies in Human Contact are based on real-world sciences, from physics to linguistics, zo&ouml;logy to archaeology, computer science and nanotechnology. Those sciences, though, are the tools of the players, not the core of the fiction. The core is in the one-to-one relationships &mdash; what people want from each other, what they demand from each other. From politics and religion to fist fights and marriages, the crashing together of desires forms the basis of the game.<br/><br/>Decisions about those first interactions are critical. That&rsquo;s why Contactors often opt to use black ops anthropologists, sent to reduce the impact of their arrival. Given seven years, three lonely Contactor Envoys will subtly alter both their own perceptions and those of the host society until the eventual meeting will be better than catastrophic. They can only hope, though, that the Contactor itself will survive the long trip, their comrades adding years to their expedition inside their craft.<br/><br/>Use the setting material to make civilizations of your own and dive deep into them as they evolve from session to session.

Madeira, the Portuguese word for wood, refers to the dense forest that covered its wild, fertile landscape. This, and its strategic position far into the Atlantic Ocean made the island one of the most significant Portuguese discoveries. Madeira served as a &ldquo;laboratory&rdquo; for what would become the Portuguese Empire.<br/><br/>Wheat plantations were the first means for survival on the island. After that, when D. Henrique decided to increase the economy of the Empire, sugar became the core business of Madeira. Once sugar started coming from other places in the world, such as Africa and Brazil, profits from sugar were no longer enough, and production of the very famous Madeira wine became the most important economic product of the island.<br/><br/>Players try to adapt themselves to these constraints, working to find better fields for farming the right goods and for obtaining precious wood, essential for erecting new structures in the cities and for building ships. In turn, the ships are crucial for trading in foreign markets, as well as for taking part in new expeditions to discover other countries.<br/>Madeira has been established just as it was in the original administrative division of the island under 3 captaincies (Funchal, Machico, and Porto Santo), where the ultimate goal is to develop the Island, gaining the most prestige under and for the Portuguese Crown.<br/><br/>The Crown of Portugal has a series of requests regarding expeditions, urbanization, opening trade routes, increasing wealth, and controlling the guilds on the islands. Three times during the game, the players gain prestige for fulfilling certain requests by the Crown. At two other times, the Crown requests that the islands change the focus of their agriculture due to the changes in the world.<br/><br/>Players must carefully choose the correct timing to show their achievements. Too early and you don&rsquo;t gain as much prestige, too late and you risk someone else stealing the best opportunities. Will you have what it takes to excel in all of these endeavors?<br/>Beware, wheat may become scarce, money is never enough, the population is hungry, and the shadow of piracy looms large&hellip;.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": {"228461": "Dutch edition"}, "average": "7.65269", "name": "Madeira", "playingtime": "150", "boardgamemechanic": {"2080": "Area Control / Area Influence"}, "age": "12", "boardgameexpansion": {}, "usersrated": "2487", "boardgamesubdomain": {"5497": "Strategy Games"}, "boardgamefamily": {"5614": "Country: Portugal"}}, "95528": {"statistics": {}, "name": "Abduction!

When developing a story, the players illustrate it by taking plot cards from their hands and placing them onto the table. As the game progresses, players take turns telling the story. Each player is trying to steer the tale in a direction that would ultimately fit their ending card.

Thirty years since the destruction of the One Ring and the defeat of Sauron. Thirty years since the death of the Balrog at the hands of Gandalf the Grey.<br/><br/>Now Gimli, son of Gloin and Legolas, son of Thranduil, with the blessing of King Ellesar have returned to Moria. This time, with an army...<br/><br/>The heroes of the War of the Ring seek a stout force to help retake the Dwarven city of Kazad-dum. The call of such renowned men has been heard and answered by the people of Middle Earth. An army marches to Dimrill Dale. The thought of Dwarven treasure beckons to some, the thought of revenge to others. Adventure and glory await. But so does death. Which will be found in these dark caverns?<br/><br/>The army storms the Eastern Gate, meeting heavy resistance from the orcs and goblins inside. As stalwart friends and companions push westward, many fall to orcish scimitars and goblin arrows. How many good Men, Dwarves and Elves will die to retake these dark passageways? How long will hope last?<br/><br/>At last, after many days of battle, the broken Bridge of Khazad-Dum appears. The army must stop and set up camp at the edge of the fathomless Chasm. Here, the Dwarves reveal their secret weapon. It is a steel bridge to span the depths, but it must be assembled piece-by-piece. The Elves and Men are left to stand guard against goblin archers and raiding assaults by orcs.<br/><br/>The darkness and unending tension take their toll. Even the bravest soldier is at risk of going mad from fear. The only distraction, the only tenuous hold on sanity, takes the form of patrolling the black caverns. The orcs must be kept away.

Players can change its path (using new movement card called: light signals). In most of the game rounds Liberator drops something and randomly picked up tokens appear in location on the map. First player who manage to pick it up will receive some small bonus in form of victory points, additional movement, special actions etc. The drop tokens are kept secret and players can use them in any moment of a game which makes interesting combo-opportunities.<br/><br/>The second expansion is about delivering private mail. There are private letters in different locations from the start of the game.

With this new-found power, Temtem attempted to summon the nine heroes of legend. Nine kids on their way to school found themselves summoned through time and space to become the champions of Jikandia. However, only Al, who was separated from his friends while traveling through the void, appeared before Temtem. Neither of them knew what had happened to Al&rsquo;s friends, but it soon become clear that Al had to find them, and right Jikandia&rsquo;s wrongs, if he was ever to return home.<br/><br/>In Jikandia, you must travel through dungeons in search of your friends. You can set the time limit for each dungeon yourself! Dungeons are altered in several ways according to the time limit you set, so no adventure is the same twice!  The longer you spend in one, the more likely you&rsquo;ll come across rare items and treasure chests&hellip;but you&rsquo;ll also face more monsters and difficult traps. Also, by meeting certain requirements, you can unlock specific events and cause legendary items to appear. Activating the &ldquo;Awakening&rdquo; mode will make you stronger, faster, and more powerful! Obtain magic orbs to customize your hero&rsquo;s skills as you wish. Up to four PSP systems can be linked to play in the Jikandia Coliseum timed stages where you can battle against your friends and dodge traps to win with the highest score!<br/><br/>Source: The Publisher Website.<br/><br/>"}, "95673": {"boardgamedesigner": {"47212": {"name": "Inghard Langer"}}, "average": "6.5", "poll": {}, "name": "Vorbeugen und Helfen", "playingtime": "30", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": {"2041": "Card Drafting"}, "yearpublished": "1975", "usersrated": "1", "maxplayers": "6", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic956645_t.jpg", "boardgameartist": {"47214": "Wolfgang Metzger"}, "statistics": {}, "boardgamepublisher": {"16583": {"name": "White Ring"}}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic956645.jpg", "boardgameversion": {"92138": "German Revised Edition"}, "maxplaytime": "30", "boardgamecategory": {"1041": {"name": "Children's Game"}}, "age": "4", "minplaytime": "30", "description": "Vorbeugen und Helfen (English: Prevention and Help) is a learning game for children to gain strength in dangerous situations.<br/><br/>Idea and aim of &quot;Prevention and Help&quot; is to caution children to crimes.

Game mechanics have been streamlined to allow players to control more units; however, the flavor of Gaslight has been retained.  48 pages.<br/><br/>Units in Gaslight generally consist of ten figures led by one or more Main Characters, in Battles by Gaslight this is expanded so that a player will control three or four entire units each led by a (Main Character) Commander which are in turn led by an overall Army Commander. A player may also control vehicles and their crews. The games are a combination of unit actions and individual heroism in the tradition of adventure novels and swashbuckling films.<br/><br/>Command and control is accomplished now through a combination die roll and card-draw turn system. Movement is based on moving entire units as they activate, keeping them within distance of their Commander.

Wu-Feng now chooses where the incoming ghosts will be placed on the individual monk boards. Instead of placing the ghost on the board, Wu-Feng can use that ghost to power colored spells matching the color of the ghost (while casting the spells bring Wu-Feng access to stronger spells) or to bring new demon miniatures in play that scour the catacombs underneath the village; these figures are searching for the remains of Wu-Feng by digging in the dirt located there, and should they find the three icons required, the shadow of Wu-Feng descends on the village to fight directly with the monks.<br/><br/>To aid the monks in their fight against this more devious incarnation of Wu-Feng, they have access to blood mantras, special abilities that come in different levels to adjust for the difficulty of play. When a monk loses a life, the Qi token is placed on the mantra. When two tokens are on one of the level-2-mantras, one monk of the players' choice gains a Qi. When 4 Qi are collected on one of the level-4-mantras, all village tiles are dehaunted.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": {"92200": "Multilingual First Edition"}, "average": "7.57722", "name": "Ghost Stories: Black Secret", "playingtime": "90", "boardgamemechanic": {"2046": "Area Movement"}, "age": "12", "boardgameexpansion": {}, "usersrated": "419", "boardgamesubdomain": {"5497": "Strategy Games"}, "boardgamefamily": {"3864": "Ghost Stories"}}, "95701": {"statistics": {}, "name": "Fighting Fantazine (Issue 3 - May 2010)", "rpgproducer": {"25918": "Alexander Ballingall"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic952431.jpg", "usersrated": "0", "average": "0", "rpgissue": {"3029": "Fighting Fantazine"}, "rpgissuearticle": {"114764": "Aelous Raven and the Wrath of the Sea-Witch"}, "rpg": {"413": "Fighting Fantasy Gamebooks"}, "rpgissueversion": {"92206": "PDF version"}, "poll": {}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic952431_t.jpg", "description": "<br/>Contents:<br/><br/>FEATURES<br/>6, Interview: The Pen is Mightier than the Sword - Martin McKenna<br/>16, Mini-Adventure: Prey of the Hunter - Kieran Coghlan<br/>52, The Fact of Fiction: Book 35: Daggers of Darkness - Warren McGuire &amp;

The fact that every card can offer multiple options, that there is no way of knowing exactly when certain cards will appear in a player's hand, and that not every unit will be available at all times (e.g. due to combat effects, confusion, etc.) forces players to carefully weigh the benefits and risks of almost every tactical decision within the framework of their overall strategic plan.<br/><br/>In addition, with the incorporation of expansion decks, even more challenge and detail can be easily added to the base game. This allows players to customize the rules to the level of complexity they most enjoy.<br/><br/>And if folks prefer their battles more in the form of a traditional board game, the Fantasy Cards can be combined with the new Tactical Assault: Legendary Battles&trade; print-n-play packs. These sets give Fantasy Card players everything they need to play exciting battles in a hex and counter style format - including unique scenarios, beautiful full color maps and more than enough counters to allow players to develop their own scenarios. The only thing the players need to provide is their own Fantasy Card decks!<br/><br/>All of this is offered in an easy to download print-n-play format available at the Tactical Assault Games website - along with articles on tactics, tips &amp; tricks, designer's notes and more!<br/><br/>"}, "95744": {"statistics": {}, "name": "No Quarter (Issue 34 - Jan 2011)", "rpgproducer": {"35570": "David Carl"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic978826.jpg", "usersrated": "1", "average": "6", "rpgissue": {"4620": "No Quarter"}, "rpgissuearticle": {"41958": "Bodge Bin - Man-o-War Butcher"}, "rpg": {"524": "d20 System / OGL Product (D&D 3.5 Compatible)"}, "rpgissueversion": {"92267": "Magazine"}, "poll": {}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic978826_t.jpg", "description": "User Summary:<br/><br/>Witness the glory of the first previews from WARMACHINE: Wrath!

Your tools are the railroad cars produced by you and your fellow magnates.  Draw cards and place them wisely to earn big points.  Vie for control of public railroads and stock to earn extra bonuses.<br/><br/>In Iron Horses, players compete to build the most lucrative railroad trains using a special deck of cards.  Each player starts with one train, consisting of a locomotive engine and a tender full of coal.  Players will add cars to these trains.  The cars themselves are produced by four manufacturing companies, each owned by a player.  Some types of cars (a passenger coach, a cattle card) are more valuable than others (like simple boxcars).  And adding cars to your train in the proper color order earns bonus points.  Don't forget about the public lines, though, which earn points for the players who have contributed most to their construction.

This all-new adventure module uses the Chaosium BRP system and is officially licensed for use with Call of Cthulhu.<br/><br/>Set throughout the globe and torn from the pages of the hidden history of the world, Age of Cthulhu adventures bring new secrets and mind-bending horrors to your 1920&rsquo;s Call of Cthulhu game.

The province is controlled by a small clique of Tories who govern the province as though it were a family business.<br/><br/>Opposing these ruling elites are the Reformers - men who espouse dangerous, American ideas: Justice, liberty, and equality.<br/><br/>In this game of the Upper Canada Rebellion, players assume the role of Tory or Reformer. Using an impulse system and point-to-movement, players move their leaders throughout the province rallying supporters, and react to historical events.<br/><br/>The Reformer, through legislation, petition, and rebellion must cause enough trouble in the province that Her Majesty's Government takes notice.  But be careful! Cause too much trouble and your rag-tag rebels could find themselves squaring-off against regiments of British regulars.<br/><br/>The Tory, through control of the churches, and intimidation, must retain the status quo. Don't be too harsh, however, lest Her Majesty's Government get wind of your corruptions.<br/><br/>"}, "95813": {"boardgamedesigner": {"1960": {"name": "B. S.

Every time two rival players&rsquo; units attack one another, a brief animation of a group of each unit engaging in combat is played on the top screen, along with the resulting damage to their hit points. In standard games, players collect three resources; food, gold and favor to construct buildings and eventually train units for combat. To gain further units, technologies and buildings, players advance &ldquo;Ages&rdquo;, starting in the &ldquo;Archaic Age&rdquo;, a feature prominently used in the original Ensemble Studios Age of Empires series.<br/>Like the original Age of Mythology, there are three civilizations available, Greek, Egyptian and Norse, each with their own unique units, buildings, powers and method of obtaining favor. Each has three &ldquo;major&rdquo; Gods to choose from before each game, these being Zeus, Hades and Poseidon for the Greeks; Ra, Isis and Set for the Egyptians and Odin, Thor and Loki for the Norse. Additionally, each has &ldquo;minor&rdquo; Gods to select from every time the player advances an age, with all deities granting the player unique technologies, perks, myth units and God powers that are used to damage or benefit players. There are three types of base unit, human, Hero and Myth, the latter two being a mythical figure or creature from the civilization&rsquo;s mythology and legends, with a rock-paper-scissor model that governs which units are best suited against others - for example, humans being good against heroes but weak against myth units. Every unit also has a sub-category such as heavy infantry or archers, again with each being better suited against certain others. Human units could be hoplites or chariot archers, hero units can be Odysseus to Ramesses, and myth units could be a cyclops to a giant.<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;Age of Empires: Mythologies&quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "95815": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic969745.jpg", "poll": {}, "boardgamedesigner": {"34257": {"name": "Chuck D.

The call has gone out for a Hero to rise up and undertake a series of Quests, each designed to bring ruin to the Dark Lord&rsquo;s dark plans. Do you have what it takes to solve the Quests before Darkness consumes Dragon&rsquo;s Ridge and its inhabitants?<br/><br/>MyQuest is a solo game designed to allow you to explore a fantasy town and its surrounding wilds in an attempt to thwart the plans of the enemy - a Dark Lord and its deadly Minions. Players choose from one of six different Heroes and must undertake 3 Quests, chosen at random from a deck of 30 Quest cards. Before the game begins, one of 10 different Dark Lord cards will be selected (at random) for the player to rise up against, each with a unique power and the command over one of four different Minion types: infernal demons, unrelenting undead, savage beasts, or elemental primordials. In this way, the game will offer variety each time it is played, as the Quests, Heroes and enemies can be different.<br/><br/>Heroes must overcome terrible Misfortune cards that get in their way and will even have to face Encounter cards that provide various skill checks that they will have to master. The central mechanic for the game revolves around rolling six-sided dice and trying to get at least one 5-6 to pass the myriad of tests facing each Hero. From the spoils of their victories in battle and chance encounters, Heroes will also earn gold that can be used in town to heal wounds, remove curses, buy items of power, and sail to distant spots on the board.<br/><br/>But time is not on the player's side, for the Threat of Evil track grows as Minions reach the town square or certain cards are drawn from the Misfortune deck. Does your Hero have what it takes to battle back against the likes of Evil such as the Demon Prince, Insane Horror, Ancient Dragon, Troll King, or Lich (to name a few)?

Unfortunately, this is a rather dangerous endeavour as the jungle is full of poisonous snakes. The expedition that is first to reach the temple wins the game. Be careful not to run out of snake antivenom though...<br/><br/>Game-play (short summary)<br/><br/>Each player moves their token on a board. Normal movement is one space, but moving 2, 3 or 4 spaces is possible via a push-your-luck element (pulling an item out of a bag, which, depending on what you draw, allows you to move more spaces or costs you some of your antivenom). A player who has no antivenom left is eliminated from the game. Event cards add another luck element.<br/><br/>Game-play (detailed description)<br/><br/>Each player gets a player token (wooden jeep) and 6 bottles of antivenom (cardboard chits). The jeeps are placed on the starting area of the board. Players try to get their jeep to the temple by moving it on the board. The board has four types of spaces: normal spaces, swamp spaces, river spaces and event spaces.<br/><br/>Normally, players move their jeep one space per turn. On each space, there can only be one jeep, and players must move their jeep. Instead of moving one space, players can choose to call upon the God of Snakes - either because they want to get on more quickly or because moving one space would take them on a space they can't stop on (because it is already occupied by another player's jeep or because it is a swamp space on which players are not allowed to stop).<br/><br/>To call upon the God of Snakes, a player has to reach into the &quot;magic bag&quot;. The bag contains 4 wooden snakes, two green ones, a blue one and a red one.<br/>If a player draws the dangerous red mamba, they are not allowed to move on and immediately use up one of their antivenom bottles. The red snake is then put back into the bag. <br/>If a player draws a blue or green snake, it means that the God of Snakes has answered their prayers. The snake is put on the next free altar space in the center of the board. The number on the altar space tells the player how many spaces they move (2, 3 or 4 spaces). When the last blue or green snake has been drawn, all snakes are returned to the bag.<br/><br/>Drawing the blue snake announces dangerous water snakes. If any player is on a river space when the blue snake is drawn (or if they would land on a river space after moving), they lose a bottle of antivenom.<br/><br/>If a player lands on an event space, they have to draw an event card. Event cards are either positive or negative: losing/gaining a bottle of antivenom, choosing a player to lose a turn, having to draw a snake from the bag, getting another turn, losing a turn, moving forwards/backwards one or more spaces.<br/><br/>If a player has lost all their antivenom, it becomes too dangerous to continue the expedition and they are eliminated from the game.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": {"92490": "First edition"}, "age": "6", "name": "Der Tempel des Schlangengottes", "playingtime": "30", "boardgamemechanic": {"2078": "Point to Point Movement"}, "average": "0", "usersrated": "0", "boardgamefamily": {"7509": "Animals: Snakes"}}, "95826": {"statistics": {}, "name": "XG Blast!", "videogamemode": {"2149": "Single-Player"}, "videogameversion": {"93747": "EN/EU DS edition"}, "average": "6.5", "videogametheme": {"2331": "Space"}, "usersrated": "2", "videogamegenre": {"2505": "Shoot 'em Up"}, "videogameplatform": {"4734": "Nintendo DS"}, "poll": {}, "description": "From the publisher website:<br/><br/>XG Blast! is an arcade shooter delivered in a bright and colourful retro style.

The Anti-Ork League, and the City of Tishrei, is released to users under the same Free Art License as the Fire and Sword Rules.<br/><br/>The City of Tishrei is a vaguely North Indian city, with Rakashas, great orks and orks to the north of the valley the city sits in.  There is a jungle with Nagas and other demonic monsters to the south.  It is the biggest city in a river valley, at the mouth of the valley.   To get a feel for what the City of Tishrei is like, read the Mahabharata or the Ramayana.

They glide though New York's glittering streets clinging to shadows, carrying fear and death in their yellow scarves. They are brutal thugs masking their villainy behind a fa?ade of ancient mysticism.<br/><br/>They are the Thugee, a cult of murders whose history and myth stretch back thousands of years.

This 51-page PDF, written by Shannon Kalvar, features details on the historical Thugee, as well as three pulp-era versions of the cult, depending on the focus of your particular campaign.

The PDF serves as a tool for Gamemasters who wish to include any sort of cult in their Modern D20 campaigns.

With hatchet and knife, pistol and poison, they strike from the shadows. These are the Perils of the Orient, the sinister villains who swarmed across the pages of pulp magazines from the very beginning in the late 1800s to the very end in the 1950s.<br/><br/>Written by novelist C.L. Werner (Witch Hunter, et. al.), Pulp Villains: PERILS OF THE ORIENT is your complete guide for including these villains in your d20-based pulp campaigns. In these pages are presented some of the most common themes that were evoked in the pulps -- from Mongol warriors dreaming of a new empire to sinister Tibetan monks with terrible powers of mysticism and mesmerism; from the Tongs of Chinatown to the nefarious machinations of the sinister Oriental Mastermind.<br/><br/>This supplement contains details of the most common archetypes of the genre, with fully-statted generic NPC examples of each, ready to use. An armory of exotic oriental weapons is included, for use against (or indeed, by) your pulp heroes. Horrific creatures appear as well....including the dreaded Mongolian Death Worm!<br/><br/>At their worst, pulp tales of oriental peril preyed upon and exploited the fears and ignorance of its audience, playing upon racial stereotypes of the time as a way of enhancing the tale's own impact. Other tales, however treated their subjects with a great deal more care and dignity, although today these stories are almost universally lumped together with their cruder imitators.<br/><br/>Pulp Villains: PERILS OF THE ORIENT attempts to present the genre in all of its excess, but at the same time with the knowledge that the characters presented here are not representative of their entire culture, any more than a murderous Thugee is indicative of India's vast population or a jack-booted Nazi represents the entire German ethnic group. A game centered around the themes of heroics and adventure will, by definition, focus upon the unusual and the extraordinary - and you will find Pulp Villains: PERILS OF THE ORIENT to be both.<br/><br/>"}, "95890": {"boardgamedesigner": {"47232": {"name": "Christopher Ross"}}, "poll": {}, "name": "DestiNation USA", "playingtime": "30", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": {"2046": "Area Movement"}, "yearpublished": "2011", "usersrated": "5", "boardgamefamily": {"14835": "Country: USA"}, "maxplayers": "5", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic957761_t.jpg", "average": "5.54", "statistics": {}, "boardgamepublisher": {"2883": {"name": "MindWare"}}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic957761.jpg", "boardgameversion": {"92617": "English first edition"}, "maxplaytime": "30", "boardgamecategory": {"1002": {"name": "Card Game"}}, "age": "8", "minplaytime": "30", "description": "In DestiNation USA, players will be traveling across the U.S., trying to hit as many states and as many special destinations as possible.<br/><br/>To set up the game, place a state token in each of the continental U.S. states, each player places his car token in a randomly drawn state (claiming the token located there), a special destination is revealed (replacing it if a player is already in that state), and each player receives six driving cards from a deck of 62 (48 of those being states and 14 being special action cards).<br/><br/>On a turn, a player either moves to an adjacent state &ndash; by playing that state's card or any two cards the same color as that state &ndash; or plays a special action card.

On the East Front, von Paulus was surrounded in Stalingrad. Rommel had been defeated at El Alamein in Egypt and, in October, was retreating with his battered army toward Tripoli. Now the Americans were making their presence felt by landing at various points in Morocco and Algeria, threatening the Axis position in Africa from the rear. The Germans rushed forces by air and sea to Tunisia to counter the threat. They arrived just in time, as the lead elements of the allied forces made their drive to capture Tunis by Christmas 1942. Then the tide turned with the weather, the roads turned to mud tracks and the Allied drive was stalled. Wedged between the on-coming Allied Armies of Algeria and Egypt, a scratch force of powerful Germans panzers, intermixed with available infantry replacement forces, regained the initiative through February, inflicting serious losses on green US forces facing battle against a determined enemy for the first time. But this was only to delay the inevitable loss of the Axis presence in Africa.<br/><br/>Scenarios<br/><br/>Panzer Campaigns: Tunisia '43 covers the three major offensives during the period from late November through May 1943:<br/><br/>-The Race to Tunis - Nov 25th to Dec 9th<br/>-The Germans Kasserine Offensive - Feb 14th to Feb 21st<br/>-The End in Africa - April 22nd to May 6th<br/><br/>All the Major Battles covered Chouigui, Sidi bou Zid, Kasserine, Operation Ochsenkopf, Flanking the Mareth Line and El Guettar to name a few.
