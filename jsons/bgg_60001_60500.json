In 1880, the discovery of oil in the archipelago made them once again a potential source of enormous wealth.<br/><br/>But as oil became the underpinning of 20th century economies, the Netherlands this time failed to build the naval strength necessary to guard the islands from predatory enemies. Conservative economists clung to the gold standard in the 1930s, dooming the Dutch economy to a prolonged Depression. By the time the Navy began to see increased funding, it was much too late to change the outcome of the Japanese invasion of the Dutch East Indies.<br/><br/>In the 1930s, Dutch shipyards stood at the leading edge of naval technology: Dutch submarines first deployed the schnorkel breathing device, for example, and Dutch warships boasted the sophisticated Hazemeyer fire control system that would be enthusiastically copied by the Royal Navy and others. The Netherlands had the means to create a large and modern fleet, and the oil wealth of Borneo and Sumatra provided the motive. But by seeing deficits as a more lethal enemy than the Axis, the government doomed both the home country and the colonies to defeat and occupation.<br/><br/>Spice Islands is a Second World War at Sea supplement exploring the alternate history possibilities had the Netherlands built the necessary naval and air forces to defend the East Indies and its oil: ships and planes within its financial and industrial capability.  The supplement includes ten scenarios, or separate game situations, based on battles that might have been waged by the Royal Netherlands Navy against the Japanese. The pieces represent modernized versions of the dreadnought battleships planned but not completed, and some of those planned or discussed but never built. This module is not playable by itself, but requires ownership of Strike South to play most of the scenarios and Midway to enjoy all of them.&quot;<br/><br/>Spice Islands was originally sold exclusively via pdf download.

Some even attempted to penetrate the barrier or bring it down. But the shield never yielded.<br/><br/>Let your heroes be the first to set foot into lands newly exposes by the mysteriously retracting shield and find out secrets of the Silvanesti Forest heretofore known only to the elves. Life has not been idyllic for those inside the sylvan veil.

The game has a scoring track, and each time a bug is caught or escapes, a marker moves up, also adding a number to the die roll. So Auntie runs around the web faster and faster. Players can share some spaces, but most of the time, bump each other back and forth.

Classified documents on League and various League factions' armed forces, military structure, and political intrigues are also provided. In addition, the large history chapter stretches from the initial unification of the Marik Commonwealth, the Principality of Regulus, and the Duchy of Oriente to form the League through House Marik's consolidation of power and its position today as leader of the now divided Free Worlds League.&quot;<br/><br/>"}, "60089": {"rpgartist": ["David R.

What the other tribes know of them for certain is that the Finians are as fierce and valiant in battle as even the Sessair. This mighty Alban tribe is also noted for the dourness of its members and their relative indifference to what the other tribes regard as the essentials of life, such as fodder, fire, flax and frigg (as Sl&aacute;ine puts it). It is said that a Finian warrior could last a month without food, or a winter without a fire, or a year without clothes, or a week without loving a woman, such is his astonishing fortitude.<br/><br/>For this reason the Finians are also known as the Tribe that Endures. Where the Sessair might win wars by swift, decisive and violent action, the Tribe of the Shadows by stealth and treachery, and the Fir Domain by military tactics and the application of overwhelming force, the Finians rely on their ability to simply outlast the enemy. Many an invading army up from Gorias in the south has made it as far as Finias, only to realise that they will never take the great fortress city in a long siege. The Finians would sooner starve to the last man, woman and child than give in, and due to their unmatchable endurance it seems likely that their besiegers would run out of food or fall victim to ice-cold winter long before even the first Finian died of starvation.<br/><br/>Though the Finians are not quite so noted for their warped ones as are the Sessair, they do have their fair share of warped warriors, far more so than the Fir Domain or Tribe of the Shadows. The Fianna, tribal elite of the Finians, are often warped warriors either by virtue of race or the Blood of Heroes feat. Experts in guerrilla warfare as well as open fight, the Fianna are a major reason for the Finians&rsquo; reputation in combat.<br/><br/>This is the fourth in Mongoose Publishing&rsquo;s series of Tribe books for the Sl&aacute;ine RPG.

They are renowned for their eagerness to go to war - even without provocation - simply because they like to fight. However, they are not generally interested in conquest or rulership of other tribes for they value freedom above all else and barely tolerate the ambitions of their own Kings, let alone those of any hypothetical High King. Thus it is rare to find them pressing their advantage - they could probably conquer the whole of Tir Nan Og if they could be motivated to do so, but are likely to stop for a feast as soon as they have plundered a barrel of ale or cauldron of mead.<br/><br/>The Sessair are also known as the Tribe that Stands Up, for their constant willingness to &lsquo;stand up and be counted&rsquo;. Whenever there are heroic deeds to be done or brave adventures to be had, you can be sure that the Sessair will be first to get involved. Whenever there is tyranny and oppression in the land, it is the Sessair who will rise up and fight it off. Even exiled Sessair retain an incredible pride in their tribal background, and are rarely quiet or unassuming. This pride in their own strength leads a great many Sessair to an early death when they attack more powerful foes, but those who survive begin to live up to their own self-images and truly become the mighty heroes the Sessair are famed for.<br/><br/>The most famous member of the Sessair tribe is Slaine mac Roth himself, the warped warrior, favoured of the Goddess, said to be the only mortal to have defied the Lord Weird Slough Feg and escaped with his life. Slaine is headstrong and violent, combining the most extreme features of the Sessair people and the warped one race in a battle-crazed oneman- army of a warrior.

Whereas the Sessair and Finians will go to war as soon as look at you, the Fir Domain are just as eager for trouble but always with an eye to the main chance. Likewise, they can be as cunning as the Tribe of the Shadows, but are quite prepared to apply that intelligence and planning to a frontal assault or even an entire war, rather than relying on night raids. If they cannot profit from war, and with minimal casualties, they have no great interest in it. Of course, this could be long-term profit - taking over fertile farmland can be better in the long run than capturing a rich town or fort.<br/><br/>The Fir Domain are also known as the Tribe of the Growling Shields for their fearsome battle feat of shield-growling, when they use specially shaped metal shields to amplify their war-cries. This feat reveals a great deal about the tribe in general for they are geared towards defence, and their warriors make great use of shields. Yet they use the shields for offence too - the shield growl instils terror into the hearts of any who face them in battle, and many wield razor-edged shields which can be hurled at foes or used to slash and slice. This combination of attack and defence, or perhaps more properly attack from a position of protection and strength, runs through many of the tribe's activities in both peace and war-time. Even their traders are cautious, yet quick to take advantage of any opening.<br/><br/>However, their focus on defence should not be taken as an indication that the Fir Domain are cowards. A Fir Domain warrior sees his shield as his most crucial piece of equipment, but it is closely followed in importance by his sword or spear. Once the Tribe of the Growling Shields have decided they will fight, they advance in an implacable, well-drilled mass, almost as well organised as the skull-swords. This is in sharp contrast to the typical Celtic charge used by most of the other Earth Goddess tribes, but it works. The Fir Domain themselves consider that charging into battle is a sign of weakness and fear, not strength - so far as they are concerned, their more considered approach, even under a hail of javelins and sling-stones, demonstrates true courage.<br/><br/>The Tribe Books<br/>This is the first in Mongoose Publishing&rsquo;s series of Tribe books for the Slaine RPG.

As with the standard version of this game, one can win a military victory, either as Sauron and the Shadow Armies if he conquers a certain number of Free People cities and strongholds, or with similar conditions when playing as Fellowship and Free People. The game may also be won by the Free People by completing the quest of the Ringbearer and trying to get secretly to Mount Doom to destroy the One Ring. Hidden movement prevents Sauron's awareness of the real intention of his enemies and keeps him looking across Middle Earth for the precious Ring. The Free People player must balance the need to protect the Ringbearer from harm, against the attempt to raise a proper defense against the armies of the Shadow, so that they do not overrun Middle Earth before the Ringbearer completes his quest.<br/><br/>Limited and different choices are offered each turn through the roll of action dice which dictate the type of actions may be performed.  The choices range from personal character actions to political and military decisions through which to develop your winning strategies.<br/><br/>The War of the Ring Collector's Edition brings all that was in the base game and introduces factions, new characters and new events from the expansion, including Galadriel, the Balrog, the Ents, Dunlendings, Siege Towers, Catapults, Corsairs, and more. It is a complete game with updates to the original game rules and incorporates the expansion rules and cards to allow for new strategies to play out.  This increases both the offensive options of the Shadow Forces and defensive options of the Free Peoples.  This all-in-one version of the game is deeper, more comprehensive, and offers both more, and more difficult, choices of what path to pursue to victory, and where to spend one&rsquo;s resources. The additional armies and characters of this version also enrich the theme and make it more true to the entire Tolkien saga of the Ring War.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": ["English Edition", "German Edition"], "average": "8.61409", "name": "War of the Ring Collector's Edition", "playingtime": "180", "boardgamemechanic": ["Area Control / Area Influence", "Area Movement", "Campaign / Battle Card Driven", "Dice Rolling", "Hand Management"], "age": "12", "usersrated": "1022", "boardgamesubdomain": ["Thematic Games"], "boardgamefamily": ["Tolkien Games", "War of the Ring"], "boardgamepodcastepisode": ["Ep 28 Stronghold Games Publishing With Stephen Buonocore", "Episode 26 - Francesco Nepitello; Co-designer of War of the Ring", "Episode 47 :: Colosseum Review - 1754 Conquest Review", "Episode 77 Origins preview, Buonocore drops by, and Xmen chat (spoilers)", "I've Been Diced! episode 30: The games that got away", "\uc81c83\ud68c \uac8c\uc784 \ub300 \uac8c\uc784 - \ubc18\uc9c0 \uc804\uc7c1 vs. \uc655\uc88c\uc758 \uac8c\uc784"]}, "60157": {"rpgartist": ["Jon Foster", "R.

A copy of this version, published for the Spanish market, can be seen in the British Library (ref: Maps * 999(1) See also: <a target='_blank' href='https://www.bl.uk/picturing-places/articles/the-royal-game-of-cupid-a-17th-century-board-game' rel='nofollow'>https://www.bl.uk/picturing-places/articles/the-royal-game-o...</a>). A French translation was published in Paris, ca. 1640, by the widow of Charles Petit as &quot;Jeu Royal de Cupidon&quot; (private collection <a target='_blank' href='http://www.giochidelloca.it/scheda.php?id=1240' rel='nofollow'>http://www.giochidelloca.it/scheda.php?id=1240</a> ) and a version was published in Amsterdam, ca. 1625&ndash;1640, by Claes Jansz. Visscher. This version, &quot;Het Nieuw slange Spel anders Genaemt Koninclycke Tytkorting van Cupido&quot; (&quot;The New Snake Game, otherwise known as the Royal Pastime of Cupid&quot;), introduced the peasant dance as the central motif, which was reproduced in some later English editions. A copy can be seen in the Rijksmuseum Amsterdam (<a target='_blank' href='https://www.rijksmuseum.nl/en/collection/RP-P-OB-77.369' rel='nofollow'>https://www.rijksmuseum.nl/en/collection/RP-P-OB-77.369</a>).<br/><br/>The earliest known British edition was published ca. 1690&ndash;1700 by John Garrett at his shop &quot;next the stayres of the Royal Exchange in Cornhill&quot;, London, with the peasant dance motif. A copy of the Garrett edition is included in the George Clarke print collection, Worcester College, Oxford (<a target='_blank' href='http://prints.worc.ox.ac.uk/about.html' rel='nofollow'>http://prints.worc.ox.ac.uk/about.html</a>).<br/><br/>William Dicey published an edition ca. 1736&ndash;40 from his press in Bow Churchyard, London, using the same design. An example of the Dicey edition can be found in the John Johnson Collection of Printed Ephemera, Bodleian Library [where it is incorrectly dated &quot;1794&quot;]: (<a target='_blank' href='http://digital.bodleian.ox.ac.uk/inquire/p/6ff20133-45bb-4276-a090-cc2b2851ffba' rel='nofollow'>http://digital.bodleian.ox.ac.uk/inquire/p/6ff20133-45bb-427...</a>).<br/><br/>A different design was employed in the edition published by Laurie &amp; Whittle, 53 Fleet Street, London, in 1794. The central motif shows cupid sharpening his arrow. A copy of the Laurie &amp; Whittle edition is included in the John Johnson Collection of Printed Ephemera, Bodleian Library (<a target='_blank' href='http://digital.bodleian.ox.ac.uk/inquire/p/7e4aa3bb-b2e6-4f0a-9055-f3418ff9dd94' rel='nofollow'>http://digital.bodleian.ox.ac.uk/inquire/p/7e4aa3bb-b2e6-4f0...</a>). This edition was published in a later state by R. H. Laurie (Laurie's son) ca. 1850. An example can be found in the Victoria &amp; Albert Museum (V&amp;A E.1747-1754 <a target='_blank' href='http://collections.vam.ac.uk/item/O26286/the-royal-pastime-of-cupid-board-game-r-h-laurie/' rel='nofollow'>http://collections.vam.ac.uk/item/O26286/the-royal-pastime-o...</a>). James Lumsden &amp; Son of Glasgow also used this design in an edition published ca. 1810&ndash;1830. A copy of the Lumsden edition is also included in the John Johnson ephemera collection (<a target='_blank' href='http://digital.bodleian.ox.ac.uk/inquire/p/278f99e8-623d-45a0-93e4-631277631bef' rel='nofollow'>http://digital.bodleian.ox.ac.uk/inquire/p/278f99e8-623d-45a...</a>).<br/><br/>A third design was used by the Bowles family. The first Bowles edition was published by Carington Bowles, St Paul's Churchyard, London. The game is included in Carington Bowles's &quot;New &amp; Enlarged Catalogue&quot; published in 1784, so we can estimate a similar publication date for the game (it is not included in the earlier Bowles catalogue, published by John Bowles &amp; Son, in 1753). A later state of this edition was issued Carington Bowles's son, Henry Carington Bowles, who traded from the St Paul's Churchyard address as Bowles &amp; Carver between 1793 and 1830.<br/><br/>While the coiled serpent design is reminiscent of the ancient Egytptian game  Mehen, there is no evidence of any relation between the two other than the spiral track.  The same can be said of the relation between this game, as well as of Mehen and the Game of Goose being related to the Phaistos Disk, which dates to about 1600 BCE and which some have theorized may be an ancient board game. We are sure, however, that &quot;The Royal Pastime of Cupid, or Entertaining Game of the Snake&quot; is an adaptation of &quot;The Game of the Goose&quot;.<br/><br/>"}, "60172": {"rpgartist": ["Larry Elmore", "Todd Oleck", "Roger Raupp", "Stephen Sullivan", "Bruce Weigle", "Jean Wells", "Bill Willingham"], "statistics": [], "name": "Polyhedron (Issue 4 - Mar 1982)", "rpgdesigner": ["Frank Mentzer", "Jon Pickens", "Roger Raupp"], "rpgproducer": ["Gary Gygax", "Bill Hoyer", "Mary Kirchoff", "Frank Mentzer", "Thomas S.

Trash or Treasure??<br/><br/>In this free to print and play board game for two to four players, you grab your Beginner's Detector and a Small Shovel and search a field for hidden treasures like coins, rings and artefacts. But beware, there is not only treasure to be unearthed, but also useless trash. For each treasure you add to your collection, you score one Victory Point. You may sell off Treasure from your Collection to buy new equipment, like better detectors and shovels. For every two pieces of Trash in your Garbage Bin, your VP Score is reduced by one. Whoever reaches 10 Victory Points first is the winner (in a 2 players game - if there are 3 players, you need 7 VPs to win, if there are 4 players, you need only 5 VPs).

Once two blocks begin waging war upon one another, the judges must act quickly to contain the violence before it spreads. Battles involving several blocks can quickly spiral out of control as the Citi-Def in neighbouring city blocks watch the escalating combat and argue which side they should join.<br/><br/>Left unchecked, a single minor incident can spark off a war that envelopes a dozen blocks and claims the lives of hundreds of thousands of citizens in less than an hour.

The Judge Child Expedition, the Zombie War and Necropolis all have direct links with rogue psykers and psychic entities. Psi-Division therefore has many operatives who constantly scan the thought patterns of the entire population of the city, searching for those citizens who pose the greatest potential, danger.

From the lowly dunk working his way through a crowd to lift stray wallets and cred-slugs to the mighty criminal empires that are seemingly untouchable to judges of the city, perps constantly prey upon decent citizens for fun and profit. The most successful perps eschew open violence and the dangers of street gangs to set up their own criminal organisations, sophisticated operations safely hidden behind legitimate business. Whether it is the manufacture of drugs, protection rackets or a bureau of assassins, few perps running such operations really consider themselves as criminals - they will avoid judicial attention at every step but usually view themselves as businessmen, pure and simple and, in many ways, this is exactly how the larger criminal organisations run. Even if the incoming credits are garnered from murder and theft, they still need accountants to watch for the best investments and avoid Mega-City taxes, lawyers to keep the bosses out of the iso-cubes, and a close eye needs to be kept on profitability and cost projections. The only real difference is the manner in which business is conducted - a hostile take-over of another criminal organisation is likely to involve spit guns and sharp knives, rather than a financial assault on another company's assets.<br/><br/>Inside You Will Find:<br/><br/>Perps in Mega-City One: A detailed look at the nature of criminal activities within Mega-City One, as well as some of the greatest organisations to have challenged the Justice Department.<br/><br/>Criminal Organisations: Full rules on creating your very own criminal empire to earn a fortune in credits!<br/><br/>Businessmen: There are many different specialists to be found within a criminal organisation - learn the trades of the Umpty Bagger, Jimp, Creative Accountant and Sleazy Lawyer and many others.<br/><br/>New Tricks for Old Perps: Perps, more than any other character in the game, benefit from an incredible range of skills.

More than 400 million souls crammed into an already overpopulated city often causes tensions to flare and temperatures to rise. Unemployment is almost total in the Big Meg, with only one in ten citizens ever getting full-time employment at some time in their lives, leaving a bored populace with very little to do. It is very little wonder that many of the citizens in Mega-City One turn to pastimes and other activities to relieve the tedium of everyday life. Some pastimes are just fleeting fly-by-night affairs, popping up into the limelight and staying popular for a short time. The fun soon wears thin and the easily bored citizens move on to the next big thing. Other recreational pastimes are more concrete and can earn their creators vast sums of credits in royalties and patents, and will go on to become firmly lodged into the hearts and minds of the citizens of every sector.<br/><br/>From flying high at breakneck speeds on a powerboard, to soaring on thermal currents in a bat glider suit, to using cosmetics to make oneself hideously ugly, every craze has its highs., lows and devoted followers and it is these crazes that help make Mega-City One the place it is.<br/><br/>The Justice Department tries its very best to keep abreast of all the latest crazes that are sweeping the streets of its city. If it deems a craze is either too dangerous or liable to cause problems in the future, then it has the power to ban such a craze before it becomes too widespread.<br/><br/>However, sometimes even banning a craze will not stop it from becoming popular and, for almost every craze cracked down upon by the judges, there are literally thousands: of followers of that craze who will keep it alive. So reluctantly the Justice Department will allow a great many of these pastimes to become popular and hope they will run their course and the fickle population of Mega-City One will snub them and move on to the next best thing.<br/><br/>The Rookie's Guide to Crazes<br/>This book is a detailed guide to the many pastimes and crazes that have become popular in Mega-City One over the years and their place in today&rsquo;s Big Meg. It presents players with new skills, equipment, dozens of pastimes and kooky products that have swept the city. Games Masters will also find a wealth of background information to use in either citizen or judge campaigns. Though this book covers a great deal of the crazes that have appeared in both 2000AD and the Magazine, it is by no means the definitive guide to these pastimes and if it were to include everything mentioned this would be a tome of truly epic proportions. We encourage you to add to the crazes in this book, exploring the wonderful world of fads and pastimes in the craziest city on Earth.<br/><br/>"}, "60245": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1789438.jpg", "poll": [], "boardgamedesigner": ["Marco Teubner"], "statistics": [], "yearpublished": "2009", "maxplayers": "4", "boardgameartist": ["Ulrike Fischer"], "boardgamepublisher": ["HABA - Habermaa\u00df GmbH"], "maxplaytime": "10", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1789438_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "10", "boardgamecategory": ["Ancient", "Children's Game"], "boardgamehonor": ["2010 Spiel des Jahres Kinderspiel Recommended"], "description": "Each player, or treasure hunter, has an excavation site board, or a rectangular cardboard grid decorated to look like an Egyptian archeological site.

Almost completely cut off from human progress and sunlight, mankind has been forced to rapidly adapt to life in the shadows. A mutant-strain has developed, producing squat, twisted creatures capable of seeing in absolute darkness - troggies.

Pirates are always only a broadside away and boardroom dealings and politics work to drain every ounce of willpower from the citizens employed to make sure the station runs properly. Atlantis IS a place where the rich and famous stand above the common man and where it is as simple to drop out of sight as it is to board the Zip monorail.<br/><br/>Within these pages you will find details of the citizens who live and work on the station, as well as the worst dregs of humanity that prey upon them.

Such a prized position unfortunately and opposing kingdoms and nations push in against them from all sides. The army and various border militias are on constant lookout for threats originating from the outside of the Dardarrian territory but there are other things that they must be wary of as well- dangers from within.<br/><br/>Beneath the smooth and seamless functionality of the Dardarrian way of life, throughout the cities and the rural places there is something darker lurking. Cults, secret clubs, elitist societies- all of these things exist under the skin of the great Lion. Like parasites sucking away at its hide, they thrive in the out of the way places and scatter at the first sign of being discovered.<br/><br/>Enemies Within tears away the veil from these hidden groups and reveals them to readers of the Wraith Recon series of gaming supplements. Whether they are straightforward enemies that work against the good will of Dardarrick, more subtle manipulators of its people or something entirely different, they are just as dangerous as any Lornish army invasion or Torresh crusade. They might be more so- they are already at home within Dardarrick&rsquo;s borders.<br/><br/>This sourcebook focuses upon the use of cults and secret societies in Wraith Recon games or any other chronicle based in the world of Nuera. How they work, who they work with, for and why are just some of the things this book will show to readers. It is a guide to the unknown dangers that Wraith Recon must deal with on its own soil- the types of threats that the public must be spared knowledge of. The book illuminates the enemy in a different light, and gives Wraith Recon Games Masters a host of new adventure and mission assignment ideas for use in their own games.<br/><br/>"}, "60311": {"boardgamedesigner": ["Abe Nathanson"], "poll": [], "name": "Pairs in Pears", "playingtime": "30", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": ["Tile Placement"], "yearpublished": "2009", "usersrated": "113", "maxplayers": "4", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic956363_t.jpg", "average": "5.19867", "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["Bananagrams"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic956363.jpg", "boardgameversion": ["Bananagrams edition"], "maxplaytime": "30", "boardgamecategory": ["Word Game"], "age": "6", "minplaytime": "20", "description": "Pairs in Pears is a word game consisting of plastic letter tiles inside a cloth bag shaped like a pear.

One word is up/down and the other is left/right, and they share a vowel or consonant. Whoever makes a certain number of word pairs first, wins. Pairpoints is a variation that includes a more elaborate scoring scheme (1 point for non-pattern-matching words, 2 points for matching words, 5 points for finishing first).<br/><br/>The large, ivory-like tiles show capital letters in four designs: solid, outline, lines and dots. The different patterns function like different suits of cards. As there are four suits, each containing a complete alphabet, there are a total of 104 tiles. Just as in a deck of cards, each tile is unique (e.g., the G of solids or the H of dots). This adds an interesting new dimension to play with (although the games in the rules only ask that a word consist of same-pattern letters).<br/><br/>The instructions emphasize the educational value of the tile set: a fun way for children to develop memory and cognitive skills while learning alphabetical order, word construction, vowels, vocabulary, rhyming, and more.<br/><br/>"}, "60312": {"rpgartist": ["Leonel Domingos da Costa", "Andrew Dobell", "Ricardo Mendes", "German Ponce", "Marco Primo", "Pascal Quidault", "Chris Quilliams", "Philip Renne", "Jonathan Roberts"], "rpgitemversion": ["PDF Version", "Softcover Version"], "poll": [], "name": "Mission Pack 1: Skies of Fire", "rpgdesigner": ["Bryan Steele"], "rpgproducer": ["William J.

She emerged from her lair to pillage the countryside, scalding peasants, roasting knights within their own armor, and rending countless brave souls with her talons. Glorack hoarded gold from dwarven holds, elven jewelry, gnomish magical items, and coin from many unfortunate nobles. Finally an intrepid band of heroes penetrated her ice caves to destroy her. When they inflicted a seemingly mortal blow on Glorack, the dragon's carcass and her treasure melted deep into the ice in the scorching steam and blood that poured from her body. The steam dragon was vanquished. For a century the lands near the Fallow Range glacier fields enjoyed freedom from Glorack's tyranny. Now Glorack has returned!<br/><br/>The villagers of Trommel fear that the dreaded steam dragon has somehow risen from emtombment within the deep ice of the Fallow glacier . Scouts report signs that a dragon has moved back into the icy wastelands. Trommel's elders have already sponsored several expeditions to destroy the steam dragon, but none have returned. Brave youngsters from the village and experienced adventurers from lands afar climbed into the glacier and assaulted the steam dragon's lair. If they weren't cooked alive by Glorack's scalding breath, they probably froze to death trapped in an icy crevasse or a frigid underground lake. Nobody ever discovered their remains or stories of their true demise. The village elders offer to equip adventurers heading into the Fallow Range, seeking the glacier and the small cave at its base.

The road winds through gently rolling hills at the edge of a deep forest. The clouds overhead have been darkened all day and a light rain has begun to fall, with promises of more serious thunderstorms to come. Ahead, atop a rocky hill, you see an old mansion, its windows dark and empty and its walls overgrown with crawling vines. The house looks long abandoned and has obviously suffered from neglect, but the roof seems to be intact and it promises welcome shelter from the elements. Camping this night will be a wet and miserable alternative.<br/><br/>A narrow path choked with tall grass and weeds leads from the road to the front of the house. The mansion was built from local timber and stone. Thick wooden shingles cover the sharply pitched roof and the gabled windows are made of heacy leaded glass. Several masonry chimneys extend from the roof, and a great, round tower constructed of dark red bricks looms over the house at its northeast corner. The house's two-story cental structure is flanked by one-story wings on either side. Broad stone steps lead up to a narrow porch fronting two large wooden doors bound in rusting metal. Tarnished brass knockers - the heads of ravens with rings grasped in their beaks - are set in the center of each door. The door on the left is standing slightly ajar, offering a view of the darkness beyond. The house and its grounds exude an almost tangible aura of age, loss, and tragedy.

Though most of those years were concurrent!<br/><br/>As BattleTech celebrates its 25th anniversary and Shadowrun celebrates its 20th, the visionaries at Catalyst Game Labs have, for the first time ever, brought these two worlds together! Join us in a universe that combines the best of two fantastic game universes in a tournament to decide who is the best warrior of all time!<br/><br/>Many warriors have fallen, and only four remain in the Best Ever Tournament: Kieren McCool, the wily immortal elf who pilots the most feared &lsquo;Mech on the battlefield; Asmodeal el Angel de la Muerte, the Manei Domini blood mage who is so evil that his mere presence destroys all photons in the immediate vicinity; Nadja Daviar, a refugee from the 21st century who has lost none of her wiles or extreme sex appeal; and newcomer Jonas Hadry, a MechWarrior and battlefield commander so charismatic and beloved that it seems that possibly the deck was a little stacked in his favor.<br/><br/>The Best Ever is a bold venture that bridges two universes. Exciting, visionary, and often a bit deranged, this is the project that no one was asking for but everyone will love! Contains a summary of the new Eighth World setting, nine new character archetypes, and a roleplaying adventure that involves your characters in the excitement, glamor and sheer ludicrousness of the Best Ever Tournament.<br/><br/>The Best Ever is kind of compatible with Shadowrun, 4th edtion, and A Time of War: The BattleTech RPG, elbow grease to make fully compatible not included.<br/><br/>From the introduction:<br/><br/>Introduction<br/>The Best Ever is an adventure for use with...um...well, mostly Shadowrun, Fourth Edition, plus some stuff from the Classic BattleTech Role Playing Game (CBT:RPG) plus a fair amount of crap that, let&rsquo;s be honest, we just made up. So while we welcome you to run this and have a lot of fun doing so, some of the stuff you might need to run it successfully does not exist. Anywhere.<br/><br/>We recommend that, should you come to a situation where there are no rules to explain what the hell should happen next, you just make something up. As long as you say it in a firm, confident tone, most people will buy it and you&rsquo;ll be fine. Seriously. That&rsquo;s how we get through most of life.<br/><br/>Preparing the Adventure<br/>Hahahahahahaha!<br/>Okay, seriously, you should probably review the master Eighth World sourcebook. Except it doesn&rsquo;t exist. So that&rsquo;s a problem. So here&rsquo;s what you do. Read this whole book through. Then turn down the lights at your domicile, boil some water, and make a nice mug of hot chocolate. Turn on some music that inspires thought and creativity. Breathe deeply. Then read through this chapter again.<br/><br/>Close your eyes. Imagine your spirit slowly beginning to float outside your body. Let your spirit free as it tosses aside the shackles of the body and journeys to new dimensions you cannot imagine.<br/><br/>Keep all parts of your mind open to the experience so that the full range of emotions and sensations can course through you. Make sure you maintain a clear line back to your body, though, so that when you are ready follow that line you can return to your material home. Once your spirit has settled back in your body, do not move immediately. Let it get comfortable again.

Two so far have been discovered, but tales tell of as many as a dozen. Froderick's remains and full wealth have never been found. Recently, I discovered excerpts from Froderick's diaries in a treatise written by an imperial architect on magical construction techniques.

Savage tribes often respect blood magic, though even they tend to fear and avoid it where possible- its power is the stuff of legend, to be invoked only by those who expect to achieve great things or die in the attempt. A few warriors of the old school will swear blood brotherhood or other blood oaths but learning much more than that is generally the province only of primitive sorcerers or the most vile and despicable wizards. Those who go into blood magic with good intentions often find themselves seduced by its savage power, and soon want more- at whatever cost, up to and including dozens or hundreds of innocent lives.<br/><br/>The power inherent in sentient blood has been recognised by many of the great philosophers and sages throughout history, both religious and secular. Whether spilling his own blood to fuel his spells, creating a ritual to bond two comrades in blood brotherhood, or sacrificing enemies for magical power, the practitioner of blood magic is drawing upon that ancient, primal force, and must take great care that he can control it, and not vice versa.<br/><br/>"}, "60355": {"rpgdesigner": ["Clint Black", "Dave Blewer", "Robin Elliott", "Shane Lacy Hensley", "Piotr Kory\u015b", "Simon Lucas", "Joseph Unger", "Paul \"Wiggy\" Wade-Williams"], "rpgitemversion": ["Jazd\u0119 Pr\u00f3bn\u0105 PDF version", "PDF Version", "Spanish PDF version", "Test Drive 6 PDF version", "Vesset Vil\u00e1gok Pr\u00f3bamenet, 6. k\u00f6r!

Months or even years of playing and developing a character can be erased in an instant by the sweep of a keenly honed blade or the fiery breath of a dragon.<br/><br/>Once the Games Master has made the prospect of death real to his player characters, it becomes a potent tool for creating fear, risk, terror, courage, motivations and even Challenge Ratings. Indeed, death is the universal quantifier against which all actions are weighted and measured. In relation to the player character, death is the ultimate nemesis and avoiding it is the true underlying challenge of every role-playing game. The bottom line is that death should never be trivialised. In a sense, this book is dedicated to death, not as a finality or end, but as a divine change that specifically concerns itself with the progression of a being&rsquo;s soul.<br/><br/>The realm of Purgatorium is offered to Games Masters and players alike so it might aid them in defining the experience of dying and being dead within the scope of a fantasy world. As a campaign setting, Purgatorium is designed to fit seamlessly into any existing game world.<br/><br/>A world between worlds, it allows both the players and the Games Master to experience death first hand and roleplay through it. There are no prerequisites for using the Purgatorium setting and accessing the realm is as easy for a 1st-level character as it is for a 20th level one. Almost all the DCs for any saving throws that involve entering and exiting the realm are scaled according to a character&rsquo;s level.

Ephemeral beings of light and spirit, they dance just on the edge of our awareness. They can be angels and demons, the personification of otherworldly magic or nature spirits depending on who does the telling. They may be warriors, wizards, singers, poets, dreamers- or nothing at all, just figments of movement at the corner of our eyes. The Quintessential Elf II: Advanced Tactics focuses on trying to help the reader get the most out of what he already knows about elves. It starts off with basic rules for tailoring elves to fit specific roles in a campaign or world. We then move on to discuss building truly epic elves using multiple classes and legendary career paths that lead to the ultimate reaches of combined martial might and elven magic.<br/><br/>Then there is the technology and knowledge of the elves. Rather than presenting a single possibility, this book describes the magical and mysterious elven culture, their ways and means of item creation and their fey tricks. How do elves that are effectively angels differ from those who represent the spirits of nature? What tricks does a wild spirit elf use that a near divine immortal does not? Elfin crafts, grown crystals, living magic, woven light, charm feats... all are presented in a discrete, mechanically clear manner, keeping to the theme of elves as essential spirits. Elves express something fundamental, something primal about their world.

Banished to the Underdeep millennia ago by their surface cousins, they plot, scheme and struggle for survival. Beautiful yet wicked, brilliant and deadly, the drow are the knife in the dark, the threat in the deeps.<br/><br/>Since the drow were introduced to the roleplaying world some 25 years ago, they have become both favourites of many Games Masters and terrible foes to uncounted parties of Player Characters. Sadly, over time they have also become overused and oversimplified. There is no mystery to them any more. Players know exactly what to expect from an encounter with drow and exactly how to cope with it. Games Masters find themselves saddled with innumerable clich&eacute;s and presumptions about the drow, making one raiding party just like any other, one drow city just like all the others.<br/><br/>Which is where this book comes in.<br/><br/>The philosophy behind The Tome of Drow Lore is that as a race, the drow are as complex and vibrant as any inhabitants of the surface of the world. This book is dedicated to the drow and to exploring all their varied, wicked splendour. In the millennia since the drow were forced underground in the Great Betrayal and dispersed throughout the Underdeep in the Sundering, the intense pressures of life beneath the surface have caused them to change dramatically. For years, they have been thought of as a sophisticated and cruel race, governed by an even crueler spiderworshipping matriarchy with absolute power over every drow. The truth is not so simple and arrogant adventurers who set out beneath the surface of the world, certain they know the full measure of the drow, will find themselves quite unpleasantly surprised.<br/><br/>Within The Tome of Drow Lore, Games Masters will find information on a variety of drow cultures, religions, societies, Houses and even sub-races. In addition, there are new drow spells, feats and drow equipment, of magical, alchemical and mundane natures.<br/><br/>The Tome of Drow Lore may be used as a standalone product, or it may be used in conjunction with The Quintessential Drow and Encyclopaedia Arcane: Drow Magic. As with any good roleplaying book, The Tome of Drow Lore is here to assist, not instruct.
