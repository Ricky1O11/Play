In 1880, the discovery of oil in the archipelago made them once again a potential source of enormous wealth.<br/><br/>But as oil became the underpinning of 20th century economies, the Netherlands this time failed to build the naval strength necessary to guard the islands from predatory enemies. Conservative economists clung to the gold standard in the 1930s, dooming the Dutch economy to a prolonged Depression. By the time the Navy began to see increased funding, it was much too late to change the outcome of the Japanese invasion of the Dutch East Indies.<br/><br/>In the 1930s, Dutch shipyards stood at the leading edge of naval technology: Dutch submarines first deployed the schnorkel breathing device, for example, and Dutch warships boasted the sophisticated Hazemeyer fire control system that would be enthusiastically copied by the Royal Navy and others. The Netherlands had the means to create a large and modern fleet, and the oil wealth of Borneo and Sumatra provided the motive. But by seeing deficits as a more lethal enemy than the Axis, the government doomed both the home country and the colonies to defeat and occupation.<br/><br/>Spice Islands is a Second World War at Sea supplement exploring the alternate history possibilities had the Netherlands built the necessary naval and air forces to defend the East Indies and its oil: ships and planes within its financial and industrial capability.  The supplement includes ten scenarios, or separate game situations, based on battles that might have been waged by the Royal Netherlands Navy against the Japanese. The pieces represent modernized versions of the dreadnought battleships planned but not completed, and some of those planned or discussed but never built. This module is not playable by itself, but requires ownership of Strike South to play most of the scenarios and Midway to enjoy all of them.&quot;<br/><br/>Spice Islands was originally sold exclusively via pdf download.

Soon after Chaos ascended to power on Ansalon, the Silvanesti took extreme measures--magically shielding themselves from humans, dwarves, dragons, and even other elves.<br/><br/>As the years passed, those outside the Silvanesti Shield wondered what was going on behind it. Some even attempted to penetrate the barrier or bring it down. But the shield never yielded.<br/><br/>Let your heroes be the first to set foot into lands newly exposes by the mysteriously retracting shield and find out secrets of the Silvanesti Forest heretofore known only to the elves.

What the other tribes know of them for certain is that the Finians are as fierce and valiant in battle as even the Sessair. This mighty Alban tribe is also noted for the dourness of its members and their relative indifference to what the other tribes regard as the essentials of life, such as fodder, fire, flax and frigg (as Sl&aacute;ine puts it). It is said that a Finian warrior could last a month without food, or a winter without a fire, or a year without clothes, or a week without loving a woman, such is his astonishing fortitude.<br/><br/>For this reason the Finians are also known as the Tribe that Endures. Where the Sessair might win wars by swift, decisive and violent action, the Tribe of the Shadows by stealth and treachery, and the Fir Domain by military tactics and the application of overwhelming force, the Finians rely on their ability to simply outlast the enemy. Many an invading army up from Gorias in the south has made it as far as Finias, only to realise that they will never take the great fortress city in a long siege. The Finians would sooner starve to the last man, woman and child than give in, and due to their unmatchable endurance it seems likely that their besiegers would run out of food or fall victim to ice-cold winter long before even the first Finian died of starvation.<br/><br/>Though the Finians are not quite so noted for their warped ones as are the Sessair, they do have their fair share of warped warriors, far more so than the Fir Domain or Tribe of the Shadows. The Fianna, tribal elite of the Finians, are often warped warriors either by virtue of race or the Blood of Heroes feat. Experts in guerrilla warfare as well as open fight, the Fianna are a major reason for the Finians&rsquo; reputation in combat.<br/><br/>This is the fourth in Mongoose Publishing&rsquo;s series of Tribe books for the Sl&aacute;ine RPG. Each Tribe book takes an in-depth look at one of the tribes in Sl&aacute;ine&rsquo;s world of Tir Nan Og, covering their history and traditions, their battle tactics and unique magic, and the most interesting personalities from each tribe. The Finians book concentrates especially on new character options and spells, because of two strong Finian traditions- that of military academies and that of the Second Sight.<br/><br/>The Tribe books are invaluable both for any players considering playing a character from the tribe, and for Games Masters looking to expand the background information available for Non-Player Characters from the tribe. Games Masters are also well served by the scenario hooks provided for every one of the tribe&rsquo;s personalities.<br/><br/>"}, "60093": {"rpgitemversion": {"15033": "Softcover Version"}, "poll": {}, "name": "Field Manual: Federated Suns", "rpgproducer": {"13641": "Dana Andrews"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic759484.jpg", "usersrated": "2", "rpgsetting": {"3822": "BattleTech Universe"}, "average": "7.5", "rpggenre": {"183": "Science Fiction"}, "statistics": {}, "rpg": {"607": "Classic Battletech Role Playing Game"}, "rpgcategory": {"2084": "Scenario / Adventure / Module"}, "rpgseries": {"3849": "Battletech Field Manuals"}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic759484_t.jpg", "description": "From the back of the book:<br/><br/>&quot;Dominant for centuries, House Davion has led the Federated Suns to greatness through brilliant and innovative leadership.

They are renowned for their eagerness to go to war - even without provocation - simply because they like to fight. However, they are not generally interested in conquest or rulership of other tribes for they value freedom above all else and barely tolerate the ambitions of their own Kings, let alone those of any hypothetical High King. Thus it is rare to find them pressing their advantage - they could probably conquer the whole of Tir Nan Og if they could be motivated to do so, but are likely to stop for a feast as soon as they have plundered a barrel of ale or cauldron of mead.<br/><br/>The Sessair are also known as the Tribe that Stands Up, for their constant willingness to &lsquo;stand up and be counted&rsquo;. Whenever there are heroic deeds to be done or brave adventures to be had, you can be sure that the Sessair will be first to get involved. Whenever there is tyranny and oppression in the land, it is the Sessair who will rise up and fight it off. Even exiled Sessair retain an incredible pride in their tribal background, and are rarely quiet or unassuming. This pride in their own strength leads a great many Sessair to an early death when they attack more powerful foes, but those who survive begin to live up to their own self-images and truly become the mighty heroes the Sessair are famed for.<br/><br/>The most famous member of the Sessair tribe is Slaine mac Roth himself, the warped warrior, favoured of the Goddess, said to be the only mortal to have defied the Lord Weird Slough Feg and escaped with his life. Slaine is headstrong and violent, combining the most extreme features of the Sessair people and the warped one race in a battle-crazed oneman- army of a warrior. Full details on Slaine at various stages in his life can be found in the Folk of the Sessair chapter, which also includes game information for most of his comrades among the Sessair.<br/><br/>The Tribe Books<br/>This is the second in Mongoose Publishing&rsquo;s series of Tribe books for the Slaine RPG.

They will happily sneak up behind an enemy and strangle him, not thinking it the least bit dishonourable. Before an army brings them to battle, they may find their general assassinated and warriors out of action through a dose of hallucinogenic fungi in the mead cauldron. Once in combat they will not shirk from stabbing in the back if the opportunity arises, but their courage on the open battlefield is no less than that of any other Earth Goddess tribe and they will proudly fight to the death in honour duels or battles alike.<br/><br/>If they decide to attack in return, be sure that this too will be no fair fight, though again the Tribe of the Shadows find it perfectly in keeping with their honour to leap town walls in the dead of night and burn the place down- women, children and all. If they are at war with a tribe, they are at war with the whole tribe; there are no innocents. However, most are not deliberately cruel and will certainly not go out of their way to attack a non-warrior- they will just not worry overmuch about the casualties of war.<br/><br/>The Tribe of the Shadows are also often known as the Falians, perhaps referring to their great city of Falias. Some say that the name &lsquo;Falians&rsquo; is the older of the two, and that they have only been known as the Tribe of the Shadows after suffering a dreadful curse at the hands of the Earth Goddess, though the precise details are uncertain. In any event they are now known almost universally as the Tribe of the Shadows, or simply &lsquo;Shadows&rsquo;, on account of their habit of painting their bodies and shields alike jet black and shunning the daylight.<br/><br/>The Tribe Books<br/>This is the third in Mongoose Publishing&rsquo;s series of Tribe books for the Slaine RPG.

Whereas the Sessair and Finians will go to war as soon as look at you, the Fir Domain are just as eager for trouble but always with an eye to the main chance. Likewise, they can be as cunning as the Tribe of the Shadows, but are quite prepared to apply that intelligence and planning to a frontal assault or even an entire war, rather than relying on night raids. If they cannot profit from war, and with minimal casualties, they have no great interest in it. Of course, this could be long-term profit - taking over fertile farmland can be better in the long run than capturing a rich town or fort.<br/><br/>The Fir Domain are also known as the Tribe of the Growling Shields for their fearsome battle feat of shield-growling, when they use specially shaped metal shields to amplify their war-cries. This feat reveals a great deal about the tribe in general for they are geared towards defence, and their warriors make great use of shields. Yet they use the shields for offence too - the shield growl instils terror into the hearts of any who face them in battle, and many wield razor-edged shields which can be hurled at foes or used to slash and slice. This combination of attack and defence, or perhaps more properly attack from a position of protection and strength, runs through many of the tribe's activities in both peace and war-time. Even their traders are cautious, yet quick to take advantage of any opening.<br/><br/>However, their focus on defence should not be taken as an indication that the Fir Domain are cowards. A Fir Domain warrior sees his shield as his most crucial piece of equipment, but it is closely followed in importance by his sword or spear. Once the Tribe of the Growling Shields have decided they will fight, they advance in an implacable, well-drilled mass, almost as well organised as the skull-swords. This is in sharp contrast to the typical Celtic charge used by most of the other Earth Goddess tribes, but it works. The Fir Domain themselves consider that charging into battle is a sign of weakness and fear, not strength - so far as they are concerned, their more considered approach, even under a hail of javelins and sling-stones, demonstrates true courage.<br/><br/>The Tribe Books<br/>This is the first in Mongoose Publishing&rsquo;s series of Tribe books for the Slaine RPG.

Roberts Best Science-Fiction or Fantasy Board Wargame Nominee"}, "description": "War of the Ring Collector's Edition is a strategic wargame in a fantasy setting where one player takes control of the Free Peoples, and the other player controls Shadow Armies.  As with the standard version of this game, one can win a military victory, either as Sauron and the Shadow Armies if he conquers a certain number of Free People cities and strongholds, or with similar conditions when playing as Fellowship and Free People. The game may also be won by the Free People by completing the quest of the Ringbearer and trying to get secretly to Mount Doom to destroy the One Ring. Hidden movement prevents Sauron's awareness of the real intention of his enemies and keeps him looking across Middle Earth for the precious Ring. The Free People player must balance the need to protect the Ringbearer from harm, against the attempt to raise a proper defense against the armies of the Shadow, so that they do not overrun Middle Earth before the Ringbearer completes his quest.<br/><br/>Limited and different choices are offered each turn through the roll of action dice which dictate the type of actions may be performed.  The choices range from personal character actions to political and military decisions through which to develop your winning strategies.<br/><br/>The War of the Ring Collector's Edition brings all that was in the base game and introduces factions, new characters and new events from the expansion, including Galadriel, the Balrog, the Ents, Dunlendings, Siege Towers, Catapults, Corsairs, and more. It is a complete game with updates to the original game rules and incorporates the expansion rules and cards to allow for new strategies to play out.  This increases both the offensive options of the Shadow Forces and defensive options of the Free Peoples.  This all-in-one version of the game is deeper, more comprehensive, and offers both more, and more difficult, choices of what path to pursue to victory, and where to spend one&rsquo;s resources. The additional armies and characters of this version also enrich the theme and make it more true to the entire Tolkien saga of the Ring War.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": {"31736": "English Edition"}, "average": "8.60974", "name": "War of the Ring Collector's Edition", "playingtime": "180", "boardgamemechanic": {"2080": "Area Control / Area Influence"}, "age": "12", "usersrated": "1026", "boardgamesubdomain": {"5496": "Thematic Games"}, "boardgamefamily": {"4263": "Tolkien Games"}}, "60157": {"rpgitemversion": {"15073": "Softcover Version"}, "poll": {}, "name": "Mindwalking: A Guide to Psionics", "rpgproducer": {"14812": "Matt Adelsperger"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic593518.jpg", "usersrated": "8", "average": "7.5", "rpgissuearticle": {"46030": "TSR Preview"}, "rpg": {"269": "Alternity"}, "statistics": {}, "rpgcategory": {"2108": "Sourcebook (rules/options to enhance play)"}, "rpggenre": {"183": "Science Fiction"}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic593518_t.jpg", "description": "From the back of the book:<br/>A MIND IS A TERRIBLE THING<br/><br/>An intruder renders security cameras inoperable with a single thought.

It is a simple roll and move game played with two dice, with spaces that cause you to move back, lose a turn, etc. If one reads the rules which are printed on the game board, there is also an element of gambling as well as elements of an early party or drinking game.<br/><br/>The game starts by the players agreeing on &quot;what to play for,&quot; &quot;which is to be lay'd down and then you must throw who shall play first.&quot; Some spaces require the player to put up an additional wager: &quot;He that throws upon 38 must feast with Cupid paying his share, that is, as much as he stak'd down first, and must remain there till his Companions have play'd once about.&quot; If you land on space 30 you have to wash yourself in the fountain &quot;until dispac'd by some other.&quot; If you land on 59, the bottle space, the player is &quot;to drink a Glass and pay a stake till his turn comes to throw again.&quot;<br/><br/>The earliest known version was published in Antwerp, ca. 1620, by Pieter de Jode as &quot;El Juego Real de Cupido&quot;.  A copy of this version, published for the Spanish market, can be seen in the British Library (ref: Maps * 999(1) See also: <a target='_blank' href='https://www.bl.uk/picturing-places/articles/the-royal-game-of-cupid-a-17th-century-board-game' rel='nofollow'>https://www.bl.uk/picturing-places/articles/the-royal-game-o...</a>). A French translation was published in Paris, ca. 1640, by the widow of Charles Petit as &quot;Jeu Royal de Cupidon&quot; (private collection <a target='_blank' href='http://www.giochidelloca.it/scheda.php?id=1240' rel='nofollow'>http://www.giochidelloca.it/scheda.php?id=1240</a> ) and a version was published in Amsterdam, ca. 1625&ndash;1640, by Claes Jansz. Visscher. This version, &quot;Het Nieuw slange Spel anders Genaemt Koninclycke Tytkorting van Cupido&quot; (&quot;The New Snake Game, otherwise known as the Royal Pastime of Cupid&quot;), introduced the peasant dance as the central motif, which was reproduced in some later English editions. A copy can be seen in the Rijksmuseum Amsterdam (<a target='_blank' href='https://www.rijksmuseum.nl/en/collection/RP-P-OB-77.369' rel='nofollow'>https://www.rijksmuseum.nl/en/collection/RP-P-OB-77.369</a>).<br/><br/>The earliest known British edition was published ca. 1690&ndash;1700 by John Garrett at his shop &quot;next the stayres of the Royal Exchange in Cornhill&quot;, London, with the peasant dance motif. A copy of the Garrett edition is included in the George Clarke print collection, Worcester College, Oxford (<a target='_blank' href='http://prints.worc.ox.ac.uk/about.html' rel='nofollow'>http://prints.worc.ox.ac.uk/about.html</a>).<br/><br/>William Dicey published an edition ca. 1736&ndash;40 from his press in Bow Churchyard, London, using the same design. An example of the Dicey edition can be found in the John Johnson Collection of Printed Ephemera, Bodleian Library [where it is incorrectly dated &quot;1794&quot;]: (<a target='_blank' href='http://digital.bodleian.ox.ac.uk/inquire/p/6ff20133-45bb-4276-a090-cc2b2851ffba' rel='nofollow'>http://digital.bodleian.ox.ac.uk/inquire/p/6ff20133-45bb-427...</a>).<br/><br/>A different design was employed in the edition published by Laurie &amp; Whittle, 53 Fleet Street, London, in 1794. The central motif shows cupid sharpening his arrow. A copy of the Laurie &amp; Whittle edition is included in the John Johnson Collection of Printed Ephemera, Bodleian Library (<a target='_blank' href='http://digital.bodleian.ox.ac.uk/inquire/p/7e4aa3bb-b2e6-4f0a-9055-f3418ff9dd94' rel='nofollow'>http://digital.bodleian.ox.ac.uk/inquire/p/7e4aa3bb-b2e6-4f0...</a>). This edition was published in a later state by R. H. Laurie (Laurie's son) ca. 1850. An example can be found in the Victoria &amp; Albert Museum (V&amp;A E.1747-1754 <a target='_blank' href='http://collections.vam.ac.uk/item/O26286/the-royal-pastime-of-cupid-board-game-r-h-laurie/' rel='nofollow'>http://collections.vam.ac.uk/item/O26286/the-royal-pastime-o...</a>). James Lumsden &amp; Son of Glasgow also used this design in an edition published ca. 1810&ndash;1830. A copy of the Lumsden edition is also included in the John Johnson ephemera collection (<a target='_blank' href='http://digital.bodleian.ox.ac.uk/inquire/p/278f99e8-623d-45a0-93e4-631277631bef' rel='nofollow'>http://digital.bodleian.ox.ac.uk/inquire/p/278f99e8-623d-45a...</a>).<br/><br/>A third design was used by the Bowles family. The first Bowles edition was published by Carington Bowles, St Paul's Churchyard, London. The game is included in Carington Bowles's &quot;New &amp; Enlarged Catalogue&quot; published in 1784, so we can estimate a similar publication date for the game (it is not included in the earlier Bowles catalogue, published by John Bowles &amp; Son, in 1753). A later state of this edition was issued Carington Bowles's son, Henry Carington Bowles, who traded from the St Paul's Churchyard address as Bowles &amp; Carver between 1793 and 1830.<br/><br/>While the coiled serpent design is reminiscent of the ancient Egytptian game  Mehen, there is no evidence of any relation between the two other than the spiral track.  The same can be said of the relation between this game, as well as of Mehen and the Game of Goose being related to the Phaistos Disk, which dates to about 1600 BCE and which some have theorized may be an ancient board game. We are sure, however, that &quot;The Royal Pastime of Cupid, or Entertaining Game of the Snake&quot; is an adaptation of &quot;The Game of the Goose&quot;.<br/><br/>"}, "60172": {"statistics": {}, "name": "Polyhedron (Issue 4 - Mar 1982)", "rpgproducer": {"561": "Gary Gygax"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic589804.jpg", "usersrated": "0", "average": "0", "rpgissue": {"1223": "Polyhedron"}, "rpgissuearticle": {"47296": "Basically Speaking"}, "rpg": {"191": "Advanced Dungeons & Dragons (1st Edition)"}, "rpgissueversion": {"15087": "Magazine"}, "poll": {}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic589804_t.jpg", "description": "Vol. 2, No. 1<br/>Cover Artist: Larry Elmore<br/><br/>The first table of contents on page 2:<br/>Features<br/>Fighter Coming Around A Corner<br/><br/>        Willingham art..............2<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>THE POLYHEDRON<br/><br/>        The new newsletter.....3-16<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Regulars<br/>Cover....................................1<br/>Letters..................................2<br/><br/>There was a second cover on page 3 with the POLYHEDRON name, and the complete table of contents on page 4. <br/>This issue also listed the missing art and article credits for issues 1 to 3 in the White Rabbits regular feature.<br/><br/>"}, "60175": {"statistics": {}, "name": "Saga (Issue 6 - Apr 1991)", "rpgproducer": {"30623": "Signe Dahl-Madsen"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic593953.jpg", "usersrated": "0", "average": "0", "rpgissue": {"3840": "Saga (Danish)"}, "rpg": {"244": "Advanced Dungeons & Dragons (2nd Edition)"}, "rpgissueversion": {"15088": "Saga #6"}, "poll": {}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic593953_t.jpg", "description": "Index:<br/>1 Forside (Frontpage): Caspar Vang Hansen<br/>2 Indholdsfortegnelse og Leder (Index &amp; Editorial): Kasper Thing Mortensen<br/>4 Spilmarkedet (Game news): Kasper Thing Mortensen<br/>6 Anmeldelser - AD&amp;D Monstrous Compendium og Blood Brothers (Reviews - AD&amp;D Monstrous Compendium and Blood Brothers)<br/>7 Bly og plastic - En gennemgang af de forskellige firmaer (Lead and plastic - The different companies): Svend-Erik Jepsen<br/>9 En ungm&oslash; - En VIKING-saga (A virgin - A VIKING-saga): Troels C.

The Judge Child Expedition, the Zombie War and Necropolis all have direct links with rogue psykers and psychic entities.

From the lowly dunk working his way through a crowd to lift stray wallets and cred-slugs to the mighty criminal empires that are seemingly untouchable to judges of the city, perps constantly prey upon decent citizens for fun and profit. The most successful perps eschew open violence and the dangers of street gangs to set up their own criminal organisations, sophisticated operations safely hidden behind legitimate business. Whether it is the manufacture of drugs, protection rackets or a bureau of assassins, few perps running such operations really consider themselves as criminals - they will avoid judicial attention at every step but usually view themselves as businessmen, pure and simple and, in many ways, this is exactly how the larger criminal organisations run. Even if the incoming credits are garnered from murder and theft, they still need accountants to watch for the best investments and avoid Mega-City taxes, lawyers to keep the bosses out of the iso-cubes, and a close eye needs to be kept on profitability and cost projections.

More than 400 million souls crammed into an already overpopulated city often causes tensions to flare and temperatures to rise. Unemployment is almost total in the Big Meg, with only one in ten citizens ever getting full-time employment at some time in their lives, leaving a bored populace with very little to do. It is very little wonder that many of the citizens in Mega-City One turn to pastimes and other activities to relieve the tedium of everyday life. Some pastimes are just fleeting fly-by-night affairs, popping up into the limelight and staying popular for a short time. The fun soon wears thin and the easily bored citizens move on to the next big thing. Other recreational pastimes are more concrete and can earn their creators vast sums of credits in royalties and patents, and will go on to become firmly lodged into the hearts and minds of the citizens of every sector.<br/><br/>From flying high at breakneck speeds on a powerboard, to soaring on thermal currents in a bat glider suit, to using cosmetics to make oneself hideously ugly, every craze has its highs., lows and devoted followers and it is these crazes that help make Mega-City One the place it is.<br/><br/>The Justice Department tries its very best to keep abreast of all the latest crazes that are sweeping the streets of its city. If it deems a craze is either too dangerous or liable to cause problems in the future, then it has the power to ban such a craze before it becomes too widespread.<br/><br/>However, sometimes even banning a craze will not stop it from becoming popular and, for almost every craze cracked down upon by the judges, there are literally thousands: of followers of that craze who will keep it alive. So reluctantly the Justice Department will allow a great many of these pastimes to become popular and hope they will run their course and the fickle population of Mega-City One will snub them and move on to the next best thing.<br/><br/>The Rookie's Guide to Crazes<br/>This book is a detailed guide to the many pastimes and crazes that have become popular in Mega-City One over the years and their place in today&rsquo;s Big Meg. It presents players with new skills, equipment, dozens of pastimes and kooky products that have swept the city. Games Masters will also find a wealth of background information to use in either citizen or judge campaigns. Though this book covers a great deal of the crazes that have appeared in both 2000AD and the Magazine, it is by no means the definitive guide to these pastimes and if it were to include everything mentioned this would be a tome of truly epic proportions. We encourage you to add to the crazes in this book, exploring the wonderful world of fads and pastimes in the craziest city on Earth.<br/><br/>"}, "60245": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1789438.jpg", "poll": {}, "boardgamedesigner": {"4884": {"name": "Marco Teubner"}}, "statistics": {}, "yearpublished": "2009", "maxplayers": "4", "boardgameartist": {"12735": "Ulrike Fischer"}, "boardgamepublisher": {"384": {"name": "HABA - Habermaa\u00df GmbH"}}, "maxplaytime": "10", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1789438_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "10", "boardgamecategory": {"1050": {"name": "Ancient"}}, "boardgamehonor": {"19396": "2010 Spiel des Jahres Kinderspiel Recommended"}, "description": "Each player, or treasure hunter, has an excavation site board, or a rectangular cardboard grid decorated to look like an Egyptian archeological site.

The island is England, home to Brit-Cit. This small but distinctive nation is a popular tourist attraction, conjuring images of smog-clouded streets tightly packed together, patrolled by cheerful but resolute judges and populated by hardworking citizens and cloaked murderers in the deepest, darkest alleyways, all bowing before the regal splendour of the royal family. The truth is somewhere in-between and far more complicated.<br/><br/>Inside You Will Find:<br/><br/>A Tour of Brit-Cit: A detailed look at the sights and sounds of this Mega-City, from the faded glory of the New Old Bailey to the imposing Forbidden Citadel, home of the Royal Family.<br/><br/>Characters of Brit-Cit: Full rules on the citizen characters of Brit-Cit are shown here, the prior lives and the prestige classes available to them.<br/><br/>The Justice Department: A complete guide to the justice department of Brit-Cit, detailing the structure, the equipment, vehicles and of course the various types of judges that try to keep Brit-Cit safe.<br/><br/>The Allotment: The radioactive wasteland that was once over half of England is now called the Allotment, home to hundreds and thousands of mutants.<br/><br/>Cal Hab: The Caledonian Habitation Zone is ruled by Brit-Cit in all but name, based around the principle of the Estates, great swathes of land controlled by a single laird.<br/><br/>Emerald Isle: Under the direction of FunRaiser enterprises, Eire has been transformed from a glowing nuclear wasteland into the Emerald Isle, the world&rsquo;s largest theme park.<br/><br/>"}, "60282": {"rpgitemversion": {"15143": "First Edition"}, "poll": {}, "name": "The Rookie's Guide to the Undercity", "rpgproducer": {"13103": "Ian Barstow"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic640931.jpg", "usersrated": "0", "rpgsetting": {"2232": "Mega-City One"}, "average": "0", "statistics": {}, "rpggenre": {"350": "Crime (Criminal / Law Enforcement)"}, "rpg": {"2347": "The Judge Dredd Roleplaying Game (Mongoose)"}, "rpgcategory": {"2108": "Sourcebook (rules/options to enhance play)"}, "rpgseries": {"3848": "Rookie's Guide"}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic640931_t.jpg", "description": "Back Cover:<br/><br/>The average citizen of Mega-City One regards the subterranean Undercity as an urban myth.

Such a prized position unfortunately and opposing kingdoms and nations push in against them from all sides. The army and various border militias are on constant lookout for threats originating from the outside of the Dardarrian territory but there are other things that they must be wary of as well- dangers from within.<br/><br/>Beneath the smooth and seamless functionality of the Dardarrian way of life, throughout the cities and the rural places there is something darker lurking. Cults, secret clubs, elitist societies- all of these things exist under the skin of the great Lion. Like parasites sucking away at its hide, they thrive in the out of the way places and scatter at the first sign of being discovered.<br/><br/>Enemies Within tears away the veil from these hidden groups and reveals them to readers of the Wraith Recon series of gaming supplements. Whether they are straightforward enemies that work against the good will of Dardarrick, more subtle manipulators of its people or something entirely different, they are just as dangerous as any Lornish army invasion or Torresh crusade. They might be more so- they are already at home within Dardarrick&rsquo;s borders.<br/><br/>This sourcebook focuses upon the use of cults and secret societies in Wraith Recon games or any other chronicle based in the world of Nuera. How they work, who they work with, for and why are just some of the things this book will show to readers. It is a guide to the unknown dangers that Wraith Recon must deal with on its own soil- the types of threats that the public must be spared knowledge of. The book illuminates the enemy in a different light, and gives Wraith Recon Games Masters a host of new adventure and mission assignment ideas for use in their own games.<br/><br/>"}, "60311": {"boardgamedesigner": {"33660": {"name": "Abe Nathanson"}}, "poll": {}, "name": "Pairs in Pears", "playingtime": "30", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": {"2002": "Tile Placement"}, "yearpublished": "2009", "usersrated": "121", "maxplayers": "4", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic956363_t.jpg", "average": "5.2186", "statistics": {}, "boardgamepublisher": {"6369": {"name": "Bananagrams"}}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic956363.jpg", "boardgameversion": {"35705": "Bananagrams edition"}, "maxplaytime": "30", "boardgamecategory": {"1025": {"name": "Word Game"}}, "age": "6", "minplaytime": "20", "description": "Pairs in Pears is a word game consisting of plastic letter tiles inside a cloth bag shaped like a pear.

One word is up/down and the other is left/right, and they share a vowel or consonant. Whoever makes a certain number of word pairs first, wins. Pairpoints is a variation that includes a more elaborate scoring scheme (1 point for non-pattern-matching words, 2 points for matching words, 5 points for finishing first).<br/><br/>The large, ivory-like tiles show capital letters in four designs: solid, outline, lines and dots. The different patterns function like different suits of cards. As there are four suits, each containing a complete alphabet, there are a total of 104 tiles. Just as in a deck of cards, each tile is unique (e.g., the G of solids or the H of dots). This adds an interesting new dimension to play with (although the games in the rules only ask that a word consist of same-pattern letters).<br/><br/>The instructions emphasize the educational value of the tile set: a fun way for children to develop memory and cognitive skills while learning alphabetical order, word construction, vowels, vocabulary, rhyming, and more.<br/><br/>"}, "60312": {"rpgitemversion": {"15158": "PDF Version"}, "poll": {}, "name": "Mission Pack 1: Skies of Fire", "rpgproducer": {"4701": "William J.

The missions take place sometime after the Lorn Initiative, and characters should be of 7th or 8th level at the start of the campaign in order for the encounters to provide the optimum challenge.<br/><br/>"}, "60313": {"boardgamedesigner": {"31122": {"name": "Thomas Baier"}}, "poll": {}, "name": "Zockato", "playingtime": "30", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": {"2012": "Auction/Bidding"}, "yearpublished": "2009", "usersrated": "3", "maxplayers": "6", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic593820_t.jpg", "average": "6.25", "statistics": {}, "boardgamepublisher": {"10990": {"name": "ZOCKATO Baier & Keuchler GbR"}}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic593820.jpg", "boardgameversion": {"110629": "First Edition"}, "maxplaytime": "30", "boardgamecategory": {"1002": {"name": "Card Game"}}, "age": "10", "minplaytime": "30", "description": "The players want to get more money in every round and the one with the most at the end of the game wins.<br/><br/>The rules of the cards (What color is trump or no trump, open or close calling of your tricks and other things) change every round.

She emerged from her lair to pillage the countryside, scalding peasants, roasting knights within their own armor, and rending countless brave souls with her talons. Glorack hoarded gold from dwarven holds, elven jewelry, gnomish magical items, and coin from many unfortunate nobles. Finally an intrepid band of heroes penetrated her ice caves to destroy her. When they inflicted a seemingly mortal blow on Glorack, the dragon's carcass and her treasure melted deep into the ice in the scorching steam and blood that poured from her body. The steam dragon was vanquished. For a century the lands near the Fallow Range glacier fields enjoyed freedom from Glorack's tyranny. Now Glorack has returned!<br/><br/>The villagers of Trommel fear that the dreaded steam dragon has somehow risen from emtombment within the deep ice of the Fallow glacier . Scouts report signs that a dragon has moved back into the icy wastelands. Trommel's elders have already sponsored several expeditions to destroy the steam dragon, but none have returned. Brave youngsters from the village and experienced adventurers from lands afar climbed into the glacier and assaulted the steam dragon's lair. If they weren't cooked alive by Glorack's scalding breath, they probably froze to death trapped in an icy crevasse or a frigid underground lake. Nobody ever discovered their remains or stories of their true demise. The village elders offer to equip adventurers heading into the Fallow Range, seeking the glacier and the small cave at its base. Although they can grant no reward for slaying the steam dragon, they relinquish all rights to Glorack's treasure to anyone who destroys her before she rises from her icy lair to terrorize the countryside.<br/><br/>"}, "60322": {"rpgitemversion": {"15163": "First Edition"}, "poll": {}, "name": "The Quintessential Fighter", "rpgproducer": {"28948": "Massimo Bianchini"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic575380.jpg", "usersrated": "0", "average": "0", "rpggenre": {"961": "Fantasy"}, "rpgissuearticle": {"89739": "Game Reviews"}, "rpg": {"1789": "4e Game System Product (D&D 4.0 Compatible)"}, "statistics": {}, "rpgcategory": {"2130": "Alternate Rules (Variant Core Rules)"}, "rpgseries": {"233": "Collector Series"}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic575380_t.jpg", "description": "Publisher Blurb:<br/><br/>One of the best selling series from D20 is back- better than ever, fully re-written and updated for 4th edition.

Recently, I discovered excerpts from Froderick's diaries in a treatise written by an imperial architect on magical construction techniques. Based on these fragments, I have been able to discern the location of another of Froderick's tombs. As you can well imagine, I am extremely interested in learning the secrets of this lost tomb. I am willing to pay you 500 gp for a map of the tomb. In addition, I am offering 50 gp to each of you who agrees to grant me an interview after your exploration of the complex. You, of course, can keep any treasure you find in the tomb. Now, I must warn you, this excursion is likely to be perilous. Froderick was a master architect who favored both magical and mechanical traps, as well as summoned and bound guardians. You must be alert, cautious, and skillful if you are to succeed.&quot;<br/><br/>"}, "60331": {"rpgitemversion": {"15172": "Softcover Version"}, "rpgseries": {"2892": "Instant Adventures"}, "name": "The Dragon's Wish", "rpgproducer": {"448": "Greg Benage"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic604523.jpg", "usersrated": "2", "average": "5", "rpgissuearticle": {"34221": "Head-to-Head: Mini Adventures"}, "rpg": {"1788": "d20 System / OGL Product (D&D 3.0 Compatible)"}, "poll": {}, "statistics": {}, "rpgcategory": {"2084": "Scenario / Adventure / Module"}, "rpggenre": {"961": "Fantasy"}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic604523_t.jpg", "description": "Publisher Blurb:<br/><br/>An adventure for characters of 9th-12th level.<br/><br/>As your party comes over the rise of the hill, the dragon comes into view beneath you: A massive golden body, lying in sharp contrast amidst the tall emerald grass beneath a small grove of trees.

Farmers fear for their crops and livestock, villagers fear for their families and homes, and soldiers fear for their lives. One band in particular, the Bloody Hatchet tribe, has become infamous throughout the region. The tribe's warchief, Rexas, is reputedly an orc-ogre halfbreed and a fearsome opponent on the battlefield. Local legend has it that Rexar has sacked more than a dozen villages, specifically targeting churches and shrines and stealing their sacred icons before burning them to the ground. Now, the word is out that orcs have been spotted in the forests near Goodland, a small village on the Nonddharya River. Lord Reisling, the frontier baron whose responsibility it is to protect Goodland, is reportedly offering bounties and rewards to anyone who can turn back the orcs and protect the village.

Savage tribes often respect blood magic, though even they tend to fear and avoid it where possible- its power is the stuff of legend, to be invoked only by those who expect to achieve great things or die in the attempt. A few warriors of the old school will swear blood brotherhood or other blood oaths but learning much more than that is generally the province only of primitive sorcerers or the most vile and despicable wizards. Those who go into blood magic with good intentions often find themselves seduced by its savage power, and soon want more- at whatever cost, up to and including dozens or hundreds of innocent lives.<br/><br/>The power inherent in sentient blood has been recognised by many of the great philosophers and sages throughout history, both religious and secular. Whether spilling his own blood to fuel his spells, creating a ritual to bond two comrades in blood brotherhood, or sacrificing enemies for magical power, the practitioner of blood magic is drawing upon that ancient, primal force, and must take great care that he can control it, and not vice versa.<br/><br/>"}, "60355": {"rpgitemversion": {"353770": "Jazd\u0119 Pr\u00f3bn\u0105 PDF version"}, "poll": {}, "name": "Savage Worlds: Test Drive V6!", "rpgproducer": {"58597": "Jorge Coto Bautista"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic601148.jpg", "usersrated": "3", "average": "7.16667", "statistics": {}, "rpggenre": {"940": "Action / Adventure"}, "rpg": {"286": "Savage Worlds"}, "rpgcategory": {"2086": "Accessory (dice, maps, screens, cards)"}, "rpgseries": {"18365": "Savage Worlds Test Drive"}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic601148_t.jpg", "description": "From the First Page:<br/><br/>Welcome to Savage Worlds, Pinnacle&rsquo;s streamlined roleplaying system for any setting!

Months or even years of playing and developing a character can be erased in an instant by the sweep of a keenly honed blade or the fiery breath of a dragon.<br/><br/>Once the Games Master has made the prospect of death real to his player characters, it becomes a potent tool for creating fear, risk, terror, courage, motivations and even Challenge Ratings. Indeed, death is the universal quantifier against which all actions are weighted and measured. In relation to the player character, death is the ultimate nemesis and avoiding it is the true underlying challenge of every role-playing game. The bottom line is that death should never be trivialised. In a sense, this book is dedicated to death, not as a finality or end, but as a divine change that specifically concerns itself with the progression of a being&rsquo;s soul.<br/><br/>The realm of Purgatorium is offered to Games Masters and players alike so it might aid them in defining the experience of dying and being dead within the scope of a fantasy world. As a campaign setting, Purgatorium is designed to fit seamlessly into any existing game world.<br/><br/>A world between worlds, it allows both the players and the Games Master to experience death first hand and roleplay through it. There are no prerequisites for using the Purgatorium setting and accessing the realm is as easy for a 1st-level character as it is for a 20th level one. Almost all the DCs for any saving throws that involve entering and exiting the realm are scaled according to a character&rsquo;s level. Within these pages are dozens of options to help diversify the way you handle a player character&rsquo;s death in your campaign including:<br/><br/><br/>     Creating solo adventures for dead player characters waiting to be resurrected that can be run between your regular gaming sessions.<br/>     Providing you with the framework for low-level characters without access to money or powerful magic to restore life to their departed comrades.<br/>     A source of unknown answers and ancient magic items waiting for curious sages or probing wizards to explore and study.<br/>     To help establish and develop your cosmology by direct interaction with the dead.<br/>     To provide a way for characters to communicate with departed friends and family members.<br/>     To defy the gods and fate, and fight your way back to the land of the living, allowing you to continue gaming even after the entire party has been slaughtered.<br/><br/><br/>"}, "60357": {"rpg": {"518": "Deadlands: Reloaded"}, "statistics": {}, "name": "How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb", "rpgproducer": {"3": "(Uncredited)"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic593110.jpg", "usersrated": "1", "rpgitemversion": {"15194": "PDF Version"}, "rpgsetting": {"436": "The Weird West"}, "average": "8", "rpggenre": {"940": "Action / Adventure"}, "rpgcategory": {"2084": "Scenario / Adventure / Module"}, "poll": {}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic593110_t.jpg", "description": "From the First Page:<br/><br/>A post-apocalyptic Savage Tale in three parts for use with Deadlands: Reloaded or as a stand alone adventure.<br/><br/>A simple job for a junker body-doc explodes into a Combine showdown with the fate of Junkyard at stake!

There are no temples to his name, his priesthood is not prosecuted, and there have been no holy quests against his work. He is the ruler of Zahhak and is known to the rank and file of his cult only as Apathy.<br/><br/>The 28th layer of the Abyss stands forgotten among the greater and more active evils that make their name infamous across the Material Plane. Its ruler does not care for recognition as long as he collects his due: the dreams and hopes of everything that lives, crushed under his smothering grip. The bitter words of ex-lovers, the exhaustion that remains after anger has left, the boredom that stains the simplest joys, the disillusionment of goals unattained, and the inertia of a life without direction are the evils that Apathy spreads and that coalesce in Zahhak, with its unending landscape of ashen dunes. Ash is all that is left behind after a fire has burned, and so does Zahhak remain where hope and faith die. The dark lord of the Ashen Waste is not a terrible deity that threatens the world with destruction nor plans campaigns of conquest spanning worlds. He is a thousand times more dangerous because he is allowed to exert his influence unpunished. He is content to let the soulwinds of his realm erode all that is good and pure.<br/><br/>"}, "60375": {"rpgitemversion": {"15198": "PDF Version"}, "poll": {}, "name": "The Quintessential Aristocrat", "rpgproducer": {"13103": "Ian Barstow"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic778143.jpg", "usersrated": "2", "average": "5.5", "rpggenre": {"155": "Fantasy (High Fantasy)"}, "statistics": {}, "rpg": {"524": "d20 System / OGL Product (D&D 3.5 Compatible)"}, "rpgcategory": {"2108": "Sourcebook (rules/options to enhance play)"}, "rpgseries": {"233": "Collector Series"}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic778143_t.jpg", "description": "From the introduction:<br/><br/>Skillfully moving his way through the intrigues of Imperial society, the Imperial Senator gains power and prestige, eventually receiving a blessing of wealth that he uses to build a new estate.

They can be angels and demons, the personification of otherworldly magic or nature spirits depending on who does the telling. They may be warriors, wizards, singers, poets, dreamers- or nothing at all, just figments of movement at the corner of our eyes. The Quintessential Elf II: Advanced Tactics focuses on trying to help the reader get the most out of what he already knows about elves. It starts off with basic rules for tailoring elves to fit specific roles in a campaign or world. We then move on to discuss building truly epic elves using multiple classes and legendary career paths that lead to the ultimate reaches of combined martial might and elven magic.<br/><br/>Then there is the technology and knowledge of the elves. Rather than presenting a single possibility, this book describes the magical and mysterious elven culture, their ways and means of item creation and their fey tricks. How do elves that are effectively angels differ from those who represent the spirits of nature? What tricks does a wild spirit elf use that a near divine immortal does not? Elfin crafts, grown crystals, living magic, woven light, charm feats... all are presented in a discrete, mechanically clear manner, keeping to the theme of elves as essential spirits.

Banished to the Underdeep millennia ago by their surface cousins, they plot, scheme and struggle for survival. Beautiful yet wicked, brilliant and deadly, the drow are the knife in the dark, the threat in the deeps.<br/><br/>Since the drow were introduced to the roleplaying world some 25 years ago, they have become both favourites of many Games Masters and terrible foes to uncounted parties of Player Characters. Sadly, over time they have also become overused and oversimplified. There is no mystery to them any more. Players know exactly what to expect from an encounter with drow and exactly how to cope with it. Games Masters find themselves saddled with innumerable clich&eacute;s and presumptions about the drow, making one raiding party just like any other, one drow city just like all the others.<br/><br/>Which is where this book comes in.<br/><br/>The philosophy behind The Tome of Drow Lore is that as a race, the drow are as complex and vibrant as any inhabitants of the surface of the world. This book is dedicated to the drow and to exploring all their varied, wicked splendour. In the millennia since the drow were forced underground in the Great Betrayal and dispersed throughout the Underdeep in the Sundering, the intense pressures of life beneath the surface have caused them to change dramatically. For years, they have been thought of as a sophisticated and cruel race, governed by an even crueler spiderworshipping matriarchy with absolute power over every drow. The truth is not so simple and arrogant adventurers who set out beneath the surface of the world, certain they know the full measure of the drow, will find themselves quite unpleasantly surprised.<br/><br/>Within The Tome of Drow Lore, Games Masters will find information on a variety of drow cultures, religions, societies, Houses and even sub-races. In addition, there are new drow spells, feats and drow equipment, of magical, alchemical and mundane natures.<br/><br/>The Tome of Drow Lore may be used as a standalone product, or it may be used in conjunction with The Quintessential Drow and Encyclopaedia Arcane: Drow Magic. As with any good roleplaying book, The Tome of Drow Lore is here to assist, not instruct. Games Masters should feel free to take what they like from these pages and ignore the rest.<br/><br/>"}, "60398": {"boardgamedesigner": {"3": {"name": "(Uncredited)"}}, "poll": {}, "name": "Durbuy, ma commune!", "playingtime": "0", "minplayers": "2", "yearpublished": "2004", "usersrated": "0", "maxplayers": "6", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1159385_t.jpg", "average": "0", "statistics": {}, "boardgamepublisher": {"18532": {"name": "Office Communal de Tourisme de Durbuy"}}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1159385.jpg", "boardgameversion": {"112554": "First Edition"}, "maxplaytime": "0", "boardgamecategory": {"1094": {"name": "Educational"}}, "age": "8", "minplaytime": "0", "description": "Educational game in French about the town of Durbuy (in the south of Belgium).
