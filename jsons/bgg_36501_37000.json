The action system is a clever creation: You know the range of possible actions that you can take on a turn, but the opponent knows exactly how many actions you have, and that knowledge strips the certainty from your preparation. Can you get your infantry back in a defensive position before the opponent thunders through with his cavalry? If you don&rsquo;t think you can, you might develop timidly, which gives the opponent a better shot of taking valuable terrain.<br/><br/>Damage in the game is represented by blue/red/black cubes, and you can distribute the cubes throughout your lines during the game to represent the movement of troops back and forth from the front lines. Shifting all the damage to the back seems like a no-brainer, but if cavalry does break through your front line, your troops are toast. Morale is checked only in face-to-face combat, and it&rsquo;s handled by a die roll compared with the level of damage within an area.<br/><br/>Control of areas like La Haye Sainte is critical. Just as Wellington tried to funnel French attacks through gaps in ridges in order to cut off their support, you can do the same, fighting for highland to prevent being pinched. The French win if they take Mont St. Jean, the British if they take Rosonne; if neither occurs before the end of 8pm (ie the last turn), then the British and Allies win.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": ["Warfrog Games Treefrog Line edition"], "average": "7.01277", "name": "Waterloo", "playingtime": "180", "boardgamemechanic": ["Action Point Allowance System", "Area Movement", "Dice Rolling"], "age": "13", "usersrated": "368", "boardgamesubdomain": ["Wargames"], "boardgamefamily": ["Treefrog Line"], "boardgamepodcastepisode": ["I've Been Diced! episode 39: Martin Wallace", "Meeples &amp; Miniatures - Episode #50"]}, "36888": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic352448.jpg", "poll": [], "boardgamedesigner": ["Martin Wallace"], "statistics": [], "yearpublished": "2008", "maxplayers": "3", "boardgameartist": ["Peter Dennis"], "boardgamepublisher": ["Treefrog Games", "Warfrog Games"], "maxplaytime": "180", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic352448_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "180", "boardgamecategory": ["Ancient", "Civilization", "Fighting"], "description": "Description courtesy of BoardgameNews.com<br/><br/>After the Flood &ndash; a three-player game that&rsquo;s set in Sumeria, with players using regional resources to trade for goods not produced in the area while also building short-lived empires for long-lasting victory points.<br/><br/>&ldquo;Certain mechanisms were created with three players in mind,&rdquo; says Wallace. &ldquo;You score an empire, then remove it, so you can try to maximize points on your turn without leaving yourself in a position to get hit on following turns.&rdquo; This design sidesteps the problem of a third player winning a game due to fights to the death by players 1 and 2, but that bug becomes a feature in another part of the game. Competition among the players for goods and army strength is relative rather than linear; having twice as many dudes collecting resources won&rsquo;t net you twice the number of goods, so getting into an arms race with one opponent might hurt the two of you together and advantage the third player who can spend resources on better things.<br/><br/>Controlling different cities gives you different bonuses, with the bonus being based on the history of the city itself: Sippar lets you trade more, Babylon counts for additional armies, and so forth. Combat in the game is dice-based to avoid deterministic battles in which you can guarantee victory simply by piling up more troops, although size does have its advantages.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Game Summary<br/>Like Wallace's other games Libert&eacute; and Byzantium, players don't represent a particular faction/nation. Instead, the game covers a long period of history (~1500 years in this case) and players temporarily control empires as they rise and fall. Score VP at the end of each turn (~350 years) when the empires fall. Players start with several resources and 2 workers in their available stock, and workers in the irrigation and weaving boxes. Each turn follows the same steps:1. Collect Resources (grain and textiles) based on relative rank of workers in the irrigation/weaving. Then take 8 workers to available stock (total 10 at start of game). Move all workers in Scribes and Toolmakers to the left (and &quot;Unused&quot;) side.<br/><br/>2. Decline (turns 2 and 4 ONLY): each player removes all workers from Dilmun, and 1 from every non-Sumerian region. In the Irrigation and Weaving boxes, the player with the most workers reduces their number TO 2 (with n being the number of workers they returned to supply). The other players remove n workers. Finally, each removes 1 worker from the Scribes and Toolmakers boxes.<br/><br/>3. Player Actions. In turn order (random at start of game), take 1 action. If anyone has passed, you must discard one item (resource, worker, or army) from your available stock to take an action. Continue rotating in turn order till all 3 pass. Action Choices:<br/>- Build City. Place one of your city markers in Sumerian region with no other city there. Most give you a special power. If all 4 out, may destroy old city to build new one.<br/>- Place Workers. Spend a resource of value x; place up to x workers in ONE location (Scribe box: max 2 workers/player). In addition, or instead, may use each unused scribe to move or place a worker.<br/>- Trade. Each worker is allowed to trade 1 resource for 1 of the resource(s) available in their region. Each region only provides 1 of each resource present there. However, if ANY army is in the region, workers cannot do anything. Each army, though, can conduct 1 trade just like a worker. In addition, or instead, you can use worker(s) in the Toolmakers box to convert metal to Tools (1/worker).<br/>- Start Empire. 3 available each turn, 1/player. Each has designated start region (2 Sumerian empires -- may start anywhere in Sumer). You must have equal or greater number of workers than any other single player in their home region (except Sumerian empires: no workers needed). Take designated # armies into available stock; may buy more (pay resource(s)). Also, may equip (spend resources; rank by value relative to what other already created empires spent). Then come onto board: if enemy army there, fight. Otherwise (or once enemy killed), place 1 or 2 armies in starting region.<br/>- Expand Empire.<br/>... <i>Place Army</i> token (from available stock) to adjacent region. If enemy army present, fight.<br/>... <i>Destroy City</i>. If have army in region with enemy city, discard 2 from supply to destroy it -- return to supply.<br/>... <i>Reinforce Region</i>: place 2nd army into a region (max 2/region).<br/>... After any choice above, may discard 1 army from supply to Expand again.<br/>Fighting<br/>Attacker rolls 2d6. If better equipped than defender, kills on 5+. Otherwise, need 7+. May continue attacking until decide to end battle, or win and place 1 army in new region (all considered 1 attack; i.e., don't need to discard an army to continue the fight).<br/>- Pass. May opt to discard resource(s) as well.<br/><br/>4. Determine Turn Order. Based on resources discarded when passing: most--&gt;least first--&gt;third. If tied, retain relative turn order.<br/><br/>5. Score VP. 2VP/region with your army token. Then in turn order, decide whether or not to improve your cities: each requires discarding 2 wood + 0-4 resources (earn 3-18 VP). If improved, place marker on city -- it won't score again.<br/><br/>6. Reset. Remove all armies from board. Remove all armies and workers from available stock. Advance turn marker.<br/><br/>End of Game<br/>- After end of turn 5.<br/>- Final scoring: player with most <i>workers</i> in each region scores VP shown on board.<br/>- Most VP wins.

Due to the continuing idiocy of you and your fellow security guards a whole bunch of clones have escaped from the Primordial Soup Kitchen and are now wandering the various countrysides of Mutha Oith. You guys better get your wazoos in gear and recapture them before your bosses find out and you lose your jobs.<br/><br/>It&rsquo;ll take all of your brains, half your luck, two thirds of your charm, a bunch of guts, and a pinch of divine inspiration to survive this fast-paced and exciting original card game by award winning illustrator and game designer Andy Hopp.<br/><br/>Peeps: 2-12<br/>Ages: 8+<br/>Durations: 30-60 minutes<br/>Contents: 128 cards, instructions, setup card, sticker<br/><br/>The Gist of the Thing<br/><br/>Security at the Primordial Soup Kitchen, that ridiculously wondrous and mythical repository of Oith&rsquo;s genetic legacy, has been lax of late, to say the least. Following an insane night of fermented circuspi nut binging, impromptu (and painful) interior redecorating, and decidedly unsexy pillow fighting between you and your fellow guards you awoke from a grog-addled stupor to discover someone left the goosin&rsquo; doors open. Again.<br/><br/>It wouldn&rsquo;t be such a bad thing under normal circumstances, but a while back the honchos decided it would be a good idea to start stockpiling clones of various important denizens of Oith (and some unimportant ones for practice). You know, in case of calamity or somesuch. Well, thanks to you and your cronies, these clones (three of each!) are now wandering the countryside, clueless and confused.<br/><br/>You guys should probably get your wazoos in gear and nab those hapless triplicates before they fall into the Keister of Gawd or get eaten by something. Oh, and whoever finds the most denizens doesn&rsquo;t get fired or fed to anything.<br/><br/>The Beginning<br/><br/>Step 1: Gather unto thee a bunch of friends. Arrange them around a table or some other suitable playing surface.<br/><br/>Step 2: Take all the cards and shuffle them up really well. Then lay some of them face-down on the table in a grid 8 cards wide and 8 cards long. If your table is too small you can use a smaller grid (6 cards x 6 cards, for example). This is called the SPREAD.<br/><br/>Make sure each player has enough table space in front of him or her to lay a row of several cards side by side. This space, the STORE, will eventually be used to house the player&rsquo;s STACKS (the cards a player collects throughout the game). Also, designate a spot somewhere on the table for the KEISTER OF GAWD (the discard pile). Set the rest of the cards facedown in a pile known heretofore as the HEAP.<br/><br/>Step 3: Read the rest of the rules.<br/><br/>Useful Terms<br/><br/>Cards: There are three different types of cards a peep will encounter:<br/><br/>Denizens represent the various peeps that escaped from the Primordial Soup Kitchen. The Spread contains three of each Denizen.<br/><br/>Giggities have the zazzy ability to copy the traits of other organisms. Thusly, they can form a Stack with any Denizen.<br/><br/>Turmoil Cards represent assorted events, catastrophes and phenomena that affect the game in various ways. Sometimes they&rsquo;re good, sometimes they&rsquo;re not.<br/><br/>Denizen Power: A special ability granted by a Safe Stack. A player may only use one Denizen Power each turn.<br/><br/>Flip: To turn a card face-up.<br/><br/>The Heap: The draw pile.<br/><br/>The Keister of Gawd: The Discard Pile.<br/><br/>Nab: To steal a Stack.<br/><br/>Reveal: To turn a Stack face-up. Revealed Stacks stay that way until the end of the current player&rsquo;s turn, unless otherwise denoted.<br/><br/>Peek: To look at a Stack or card without revealing it to the others.<br/><br/>The Spread: The face-down grid of cards that forms the primary playing area.<br/><br/>Stacks: Matching cards collected throughout the game. Three types of Stacks exist. Each is worth a different amount of points.<br/><br/>Sneaky Stack (1 point):A Denizen and a Giggity.<br/><br/>Stacked Stack (2 points): Two identical Denizens.<br/><br/>Safe Stack (4 points): Three of the same Denizen. A Safe Stack can NEVER be discarded or nabbed by another player. That&rsquo;s why it&rsquo;s called a Safe Stack.<br/><br/>The Store: The area directly in front of each player that houses the Stacks the player has collected. Stacks in the Store are always laid from left to right in the order they were collected. Sneaky Stacks and Stacked Stacks are laid face-down, while Safe Stacks are face-up.<br/><br/>How to Play<br/><br/>The most flatulent player (by consensus) goes first. Here&rsquo;s what you do on your turn:<br/><br/>Step 1: Flip over any one card in the Spread. If it&rsquo;s a Turmoil card do what it says. If it&rsquo;s a Giggity or Denizen leave it in place face-up (unless you can make a match with the Denizen).<br/><br/>Step 2: Flip over a second card. If it is a Turmoil card do what it says. If it&rsquo;s a Denizen or a Giggity you have options:<br/><br/>Two Giggities: If both of the flipped cards are Giggities toss them both in the Keister of Gawd.<br/><br/>One Giggity &amp; One Denizen: If one of the revealed cards is a Denizen that matches a Denizen in one of your Sneaky or Stacked Stacks you may snatch it up and insert it into the matching Stack. Adding a card to a Sneaky Stack makes it a Stacked Stack. Discard the Giggity into the Keister of Gawd. Adding a Card to a Stacked Stack makes it a Safe Stack. You may now flip it over. It can&rsquo;t be stolen and you immediately have access to that Denizen&rsquo;s Power (you can still only use one Denizen Power per turn, though).<br/><br/>If one of the revealed cards is a Denizen and the other is a Giggity you may snatch them both up and create a Sneaky Stack.<br/><br/>If one or more of the cards is a Denizen and you think you know where another player has a Stack that matches that Denizen you may try to steal the Stack from the other player. Point to the face-down stack in front of the other player and demand to see it. The player flips over the stack, revealing it to everyone. If you are correct, and the Denizen in the Stack matches the one you flipped, you Nab the Stack from the other player and add it to your Store. If you are incorrect, your turn ends immediately and you LOSE YOUR NEXT TURN. The owner of the wronged stack flips it back over and play continues.<br/><br/>Two Different Denizens: If both cards are Denizens who don&rsquo;t match each other and you don&rsquo;t know where a matching stack is, flip both cards back over and play passes to the next player. If one or more of the revealed cards is a Denizen that matches a Denizen in one of your Sneaky or Stacked Stacks you may snatch it up and insert it into the matching Stack (discarding the Giggity to make a Stacked Stack or combining three Denizens to make a Safe Stack.<br/><br/>Two Identical Denizens: If you flip two of the same Denizen you may combine them into a Stacked Stack and place it in your Store. If you already have a Sneaky Stack featuring the same Denizen you may discard the Giggity from the Sneaky Stack and combine the Denizen with the Stacked Stack to form a Safe Stack.<br/><br/>If you suspect another player has a Sneaky Stack featuring the flipped Denizen you may attempt to nab it as described in the previous section.<br/><br/>Step 3: Used Turmoil cards go to the Keister. Unmatched or undiscarded Giggities get flipped back over. Fill in any gaps in the Spread with face-down cards from the Heap. Once the Heap is depleted just leave the gaps empty.<br/><br/>Step 4: Your turn is over. Play progresses clockwise around the table unless a Turmoil card or Denizen Power indicates otherwise.<br/><br/>Sidenote:  You may look at the Stacks in your own Store whenever you want, but if you do you must temporarily flip them over for everyone to see.<br/><br/>Denizen Powers<br/><br/>No doubt the observant among you have noticed a block of text at the bottom of each Denizen card. This describes the special power you can access once you have that Denizen in a Safe Stack (all three matching Denizen cards).<br/><br/>Each turn, once you&rsquo;ve acquired one or more Safe Stacks, you may choose to initiate the power from ONE Denizen. You may activate the power at any point during your turn, but you can only use one Denizen Power per turn and you may not use the same Denizen Power two turns in a row (even if you only have one Safe Stack).<br/><br/>As soon as you get a Safe Stack you can access that Denizen&rsquo;s Power (as long as it&rsquo;s your turn and you haven&rsquo;t already used a Denizen power that turn). Some Denizen Powers are activated by the actions of other players and can be used whether it&rsquo;s your turn or not, as long as you haven&rsquo;t already used one that turn (such as Squiggins Neverlost&rsquo;s ability to avoid lost turns).<br/>When you activate a Denizen Power turn the relevant Safe Stack the other way around (but still face-up) to signify its usage. Turn it back around at the start of your next turn.<br/><br/>Ending the Game<br/><br/>Once the Spread has been depleted and all the cards are either in the Stores or the Keister of Gawd, the game is over. Whoever has the most points, determined by the type and number of Stacks in each player&rsquo;s Store, is the winner and gets to keep his or her job as a hapless minion of the Primordial Soup Kitchen. Everyone else gets fired or fed to something horrible.<br/><br/>In the event of a tie, whichever tieing player has the most Safe Stacks wins. If it&rsquo;s still a tie the win goes to the player with the most Stacked Stacks, then the most Sneaky Stacks. If it&rsquo;s still a tie after that the world blows up and nobody wins.<br/><br/>Stack Values<br/><br/>Sneaky Stack (1 Giggity &amp; 1 Denizen): 1 Point<br/><br/>Stacked Stack (2 Denizens): 2 Points<br/><br/>Safe Stack (3 Denizens): 4 Points<br/><br/>&nbsp;<br/><br/>"}, "36907": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic408057.jpg", "poll": [], "boardgamedesigner": ["Jacques Zeimet"], "statistics": [], "yearpublished": "2007", "maxplayers": "2", "boardgameartist": ["(Uncredited)"], "boardgamepublisher": ["Giseh Verlag"], "maxplaytime": "20", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic408057_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "20", "boardgamecategory": ["Abstract Strategy"], "description": "An abstract strategy game played on a circle of 12 spaces, on which white and black pieces are stacked.

Winner of the Kaiser's Cup for two consecutive years, a competition testing the gunnery of His Majesty's warships, the East Asiatic Squadron was commanded by Admiral Maximilian von Spee. The East Asiatic Squadron was made up of fast and modern ships. The flagship was the Scharnhorst, a fast armoured cruiser with 8.2&quot; guns. Her sister-ship, the Gneisenau, boasted the same specifications. In addition to these two armoured cruisers, there were the light cruisers Leipzig, N&uuml;rnberg, and Emden, all very fast and armed with 4.1&quot; guns. This fleet provided the greatest threat to Allied shipping outside of the north Atlantic.<br/><br/>Spee had several options when news of the war reached him. The greatest concentration of Allied merchant shipping in the region was at the approaches to the Red Sea, where convoys from India, China, and Australia passed through the Suez Canal. But there were no places for German ships to coal in the Indian Ocean, and operating there would bring Spee into contact with the Royal Navy China Station and the powerful but slow Triumph. Operating in the northern Pacific was ruled out because of the powerful Japanese fleet, easily the largest in the Pacific. Operating around the Dutch East Indies and Australia was also discarded because it would bring the East Asiatic Squadron within the sights of the Australia, a battlecruiser with 12&quot; guns. With few options, Spee decided to head across the Pacific where he could indirectly disrupt Allied shipping and hopefully cause enough consternation within the Royal Navy that several important ships would be detached from the Home Fleet. The south Pacific had plenty of islands from which Spee and his ships could supply and the islands also provided an effective hiding place. With luck, Spee could reach South America and coal from neutral ports there, enter the Atlantic Ocean, feast on the rich merchant shipping around Montevideo, and maybe even reach Germany.<br/><br/>Not all commanders concurred and the captain of the Emden proposed that his vessel would head west into the Indian Ocean where a lone ship could more easily stay hidden and coal from captured merchants. Spee agreed and the Emden sailed west while the East Asiatic Squadron sailed east, where they were expected to meet the Dresden en route from the Atlantic.<br/><br/>What followed was one of the greatest war time adventures at sea.<br/><br/>Spee eluded capture for months and appeared off the coast of Chile where he destroyed a British fleet at the Battle of Coronel. Crossing into the Atlantic, Spee was finally sunk in December 1914 under the weight of the shells from the 12&quot; guns of the Invincible and Inflexible, two battlecruisers dispatched from North Sea waters to deal with the German threat. The Emden had an incredible campaign of her own, sinking almost two dozen merchant ships and causing panic throughout the Indian Ocean. The Emden also met a tragic end at the hands of the Sydney in November 1914.<br/><br/>In The Pursuit of von Spee you are put at the helm of the German or Allied fleet. Your goal as the German commander is to disrupt Allied shipping, raid Allied possessions, sink Allied warships, and survive for as long as possible. As the Allies you are to capture the German colonies and seek out and destroy the German raiders all the while trying to keep your merchant shipping en route to their destinations and afloat.<br/><br/>The Pursuit of von Spee is a game of deception and subterfuge. One must keep in mind at all times that the winner of this game could very well be the best bluffer. Without knowing exactly where your opponent's ships are, a subtle look could give you the hint needed to find von Spee and send his fleet to the bottom.<br/><br/>The Pursuit of von Spee uses a fog-of-war system that hides the location and condition of the various ships in the game. Naval combat uses a system which takes into account the size of a ship's guns, its top speed, and the strength of its armour at various parts of the ship. The Allied player has a lot of responsibilities to take care of in addition to hunting the German player, while the German player has to choose his battles carefully and keep a close eye on the condition and coal-reserves of each of his ships. The German player also has the ability to bring two other ships into the campaign, the Karlsruhe and the K&ouml;nigsberg. The Allied player receives reinforcements as well during the course of the game.<br/><br/>In your game box you will receive four 12&quot; x 18&quot; map sheets which join together to make one 24&quot; x 36&quot; map spanning from the Indian Ocean to the Atlantic. The game includes 240 mounted counters (in easy-to-cut strips), one 10-sided die, two blinds, four ship charts, five player aid sheets, and a 17-page rulebook containing all of the rules and setup information required.<br/><br/>This game is of medium complexity but has only a few mechanics to master. Learning the game comes quickly as the phases are simple and straight-forward. In addition to regular playtesting, this game was also play tested with a first-time wargamer, who was nevertheless able to grasp the basics of the game in her first session. Learning the strategy and intricacies of play can take much longer, as the options in this game are endless. Depending on how long von Spee survives, the game can last anywhere from 2 to 12 hours.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "1", "boardgameversion": ["First edition"], "name": "The Pursuit of von Spee", "playingtime": "120", "boardgamemechanic": ["Dice Rolling", "Hex-and-Counter", "Secret Unit Deployment", "Simulation"], "average": "7.32353", "usersrated": "17", "boardgamesubdomain": ["Wargames"], "age": "0"}, "36934": {"boardgamedesigner": ["(Uncredited)"], "statistics": [], "name": "Shakeout", "playingtime": "10", "minplayers": "2", "yearpublished": "0", "usersrated": "2", "maxplayers": "4", "average": "5.5", "boardgamepublisher": ["Denys Fisher Toys"], "boardgameversion": ["Denys Fisher UK Edition"], "maxplaytime": "10", "poll": [], "age": "0", "minplaytime": "10", "description": "Denys Fisher had a reputation for producing some very 'different' games - not least Shakeout which involves each player taking hold of a plastic sphere filled with plastic sticks,  and having to shake it frantically to 'spill' out the contents.

The designer has added two new elements to the game that will make this a truly unique ACW game. First, he is adding Manifest Destiny, a Mexican-American War mini-game that will serve as an introductory scenario. This short campaign will give new players an excellent place to start playing and veteran players will have a game that can be finished in an evening. The second element is Crisis &amp; Compromise, a card play oriented game of the period from the end of the Mexican-American War to the start of the Civil War. Though little combat occurs (guerrilla warfare in Kansas, etc.), the card play covers the actions inspiring events, leaders and regional positions (Border States) that affect the allegiance of states to a region and the ability of military leaders at the start of the Civil War. Crisis &amp; Compromise can be played alone or used to create alternative starting situations for Glory.<br/><br/>Glory is a grand strategy game of the American Civil War in the style of Krieg! Maps of the Eastern and Western Theaters include terrain, Strategic Objectives, roads/rail, naval zones, navigable and non-navigable rivers, cities and locales, supply centers and other features affecting the game. Counters represent the corps and armies of the war. Cards provide the strategic-political-economic direction for each side. Strategies are many and varied but the ultimate goal is to demoralize the opposing faction's population through military, economic and political victories while sustaining your own population's will to continue the fight. The players each choose a Strategy Card and an Addendum Card before each new season and may opt to play an additional card as a diplomatic response to certain events. These cards lead to new military units, leaders, and replacement steps and result in socio-economic and political events. The events include the declaration of Emancipation, the elections of 1862 and 1864, and the possible intervention by European nations. Events are often double-edged swords, sometimes providing a military advantage while negatively affecting the popular will to fight.

First came 'The Metric Mile', much played both solo and as a multi-play and postal game but in my opinion rather bland. A recent re-working of the game has improved it I believe but whilst it requires user input in terms of deciding what Mode to use for each athlete each Turn it lacks the detail of 'Three-and-three Quarter Laps', which remains my preferred choice for that type of simulation. 'Legends' is what I term an 'eye-in-the-sky' game, the user is 'looking down' on the track with no more involvement than rolling the dice, consulting the Charts and keeping the Race Control Sheet up-dated. A few years ago 'Legends' could not have been published, the demand was all for 'involvement' games, where the user's input had a definite effect on the outcome. 'The Sport of Kings', with its many small decisions all affecting the final outcome, is typical of that genre.<br/><br/>But recently we have noticed a trend towards the complete solo game, with no opportunity to influence the outcome, maybe for fear of spoiling the purity of sporting history by allowing personal bias to creep in, maybe just because gamers are going through a phase where they prefer to sit back and watch it all happen in front of them, in control but not controlling the replay.<br/><br/>Whatever, the brief for 'Legends' was for a non-involvement ATG simulation with races playable in 10-12 minutes, accurate (of course) as far as any mixed-era simulation can be, providing enough detail and stats. (split and final times) to keep the hard-core replay gamer happy and with a system that needed a minimum of book-keeping. Hopefully that is what you have got with 'Legends', playing time around 10 minutes, a simple but effective Track Display, one hundred ATG athletes who will run their races in the way they usually ran them in real life (but with ability to change race 'plans' if you wish) with times geared to 2007 standards, pace-makers, 'fast' and normal tracks, weather effects, race 'quality' effects and fitness levels.<br/><br/>We think 'Legends' will be an ideal vehicle for solo campaigns, enough 'going on' to keep the interest at a high level, fun to run races, and the chance to run a full season incorporating Grand Prix meetings, Olympics (or World Championships), world-record attempts and with a few minor meetings flung in to keep the mix flexible.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "1", "boardgameversion": ["Runner Cards edition", "Runner List edition"], "age": "0", "name": "Legends of The Track", "playingtime": "10", "boardgamemechanic": ["Simulation"], "average": "5.66667", "usersrated": "3", "boardgamefamily": ["Solitaire Games", "Sports: Athletics / Track and Field"]}, "36572": {"boardgamedesigner": ["(Uncredited)"], "poll": [], "name": "Kiss & Cry: Women's Figure Skating Game", "playingtime": "45", "minplayers": "1", "boardgamemechanic": ["Simulation"], "yearpublished": "2007", "usersrated": "0", "maxplayers": "2", "boardgamefamily": ["Sports: Winter Sports"], "average": "0", "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["Action Sims"], "maxplaytime": "45", "boardgamecategory": ["Card Game", "Sports"], "age": "0", "minplaytime": "45", "description": "Features All skaters who appeared in at least 2 competitions during the 2005-2006 season are included<br/><br/>Each skater rated in 7 different categories, from technical elements to deductions.<br/><br/>Separate .pdf files for each country allow for easy competition setup.

It is produced by the same team that publish the Italian 'Dadi &amp; Piombo' miniatures wargaming magazine.<br/><br/>It is an extremely flexible system which allows players to recreate armies from a huge period of history - from Ancient Egypt, Romans and the Crusades right through to the Hundred Years War and Samurai.<br/><br/>Impetus is designed to be played using miniatures in various scales: 6mm, 10mm, 15mm, 20mm, and 25/28mm are all catered for.<br/><br/>Miniatures are based in elements - 60mm wide for 6mm &amp; 10mm, 80mm wide for 15mm, and 120mm wide for 20mm &amp; 25/28mm. The depth of the element is stipulated, but is not vital. This enables you to play the system with armies already based for other games systems.<br/><br/>The game play is turn based, but is not traditional i-go/u-go. Players roll dice for initiative every turn, but units are able to react to enemy forces out of sequence.<br/><br/>Units have 3 or 4 statistics, the most important of which is VBU, a combination of unit strength and morale.<br/><br/>Combat is fast and simple. Units roll dice equivalent to their VBU in combat, with various modifiers giving bonuses to the number of dice thrown. Any score of '6' or double '5' score a hit. There is some record keeping required, as unit hits cause a reduction in VBU.

Panzer Grenadier: Secret Weapons is a 64-page book supplement to the popular Panzer Grenadier series, looking at some of these laboratory products &mdash; all of which existed at least on the drawing board, and many of which actually saw service.<br/><br/>Origins Award winning author John R. Phythyon Jr. tells of odd programs like Germany's super-heavy tanks &mdash; vehicles like the 180-ton Maus tank and the equally huge Tiger III. None of those actually saw combat, but the world's first anti-tank guided missile, the German X7, apparently did.<br/><br/>Britain's huge tanks are also covered, with the slow and heavy Tortoise and the slow and heavy Black Prince. And there's the awesome Centurion, a design so solid it remains in service in some of the world's armies more than six decades later.<br/><br/>Plus we have flying machines. There are German Fl.282 helicopters (in three versions), Fa.223 helicopters (also in three versions) and the huge Fa.284 helicopter. Plus the P.1003 tilt-rotor aircraft, ancestor of the modern-day Osprey. Finally, German jets make an appearance to lend close support, including the Me.1099 attack plane fitted with a 55mm automatic cannon.<br/><br/>And there's more. The Americans get their Sikorsky R4 reconnaissance helicopter, while the Japanese receive the Ka-1 autogyro.

In the corners of the board there are a bank, a police station, a school and a factory. These involve action cards players must pick if they stop on the corresponding square.<br/><br/>Players can buy free blocks from the bank when entering one (they can also negotiate themselves to buy and sell their own blocks). If the entered block is already taken, they have to pay rent for the owner. To increase the rent of the blocks, players can build them with corresponding buildings. Each building consists of 4-6 small wooden part. A house can be built as soon as a player has a block for it. To build other buildings, one has to own both of the blocks of that serie (say, both shop blocks). Buildings can be bought part by part, but only finished buildings increase the rent (one exception: houses without roofs increase the rent also).<br/><br/>Player can own only two blocks for houses, other blocks as many as they want. Furthermore, player can build only one house. Since the number of shops, kiosks and both stations is also limited to one, player has to decide on which of the blocks he/she wants to build. The buildings cannot be later moved.<br/><br/>If a player can't pay rent or other payments, he/she can sell his/her building blocks back to the bank and take mortages on empty blocks (these blocks don't give any income for the owner). If this wont bring enough cash, the player makes a bankruptcy and is out of the game. All blocks are returned to the bank and they are free to buy for other players.<br/><br/>Last player in game is the winner.<br/><br/>Rule variations for two players<br/>Both players can own several house blocks and build two houses.<br/><br/>"}, "36636": {"boardgamedesigner": ["(Uncredited)"], "poll": [], "name": "Housing Drive", "playingtime": "40", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": ["Dice Rolling", "Tile Placement", "Trading"], "yearpublished": "1948", "usersrated": "5", "maxplayers": "6", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic355163_t.jpg", "average": "7", "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["Pepys (Castell Brothers)"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic355163.jpg", "boardgameversion": ["First edition", "Second Edition"], "maxplaytime": "40", "boardgamecategory": ["City Building", "Dice", "Economic"], "age": "0", "minplaytime": "40", "description": "'Housing Drive' is a board game published by Pepys Games of London in the 1940's.<br/> 2-6 players race to complete a housing estate using the least government subsidy possible.

Each deck contains 52 cards and 2 &quot;jokers&quot;, but instead of typical front and back faces, each side has multiple card faces printed on it. For this Texas Hold'em deck, the fronts show 2 card faces, and the backs show 3 card faces.<br/><br/>The front of each card represents your two hole cards, and their value relative to other starting hands. There are also example flops labeled &quot;Weak&quot;, &quot;Good&quot;, &quot;Great&quot;, and &quot;The Nuts&quot;, and their value relative to other possible flops. Text descriptions include a standard name and a popular nickname for the hole cards, and the common slang for your made hands and draws.<br/><br/>The back of each card represents three cards that would be a great flop for the starting hand on the front. The idea is that without looking at the front of the card, you can deduce a range of hole cards that might be on the front just by looking at the flop cards on the back. Turn and River cards are displayed by placing one card under another so that only one new card face is showing.<br/><br/>This connection between the cards on the front and back lets you play and learn the game by yourself, or practice your hand reading skills in a game with others. Key points of the system are: starting hands and their values before and after the flop, learning the lingo that the professionals use to describe their hands, and good practice spotting bad beats, missed draws, pure bluffs, and the stone cold nuts.<br/><br/>Game variations you can play with this deck include: Texas Holdem, Greek Holdem, Heads-Up Holdem Solitaire, Multi-Way Holdem Solitaire, Holdem Flash Cards, and Blind Man's Bluff.<br/><br/>"}, "36656": {"boardgamedesigner": ["(Uncredited)"], "poll": [], "name": "Police Pursuit", "playingtime": "0", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": ["Roll / Spin and Move"], "yearpublished": "1987", "usersrated": "0", "maxplayers": "2", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic335622_t.jpg", "average": "0", "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["Police Pursuit Inc."], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic335622.jpg", "boardgameversion": ["Police Pursuit Edition"], "maxplaytime": "0", "boardgamecategory": ["Educational", "Trivia"], "age": "0", "minplaytime": "0", "description": "Police Pursuit is a law enforcement question and answer game with three levels of play.

The game uses six and twenty-sided dice. Miniatures of any scale may be used.<br/><br/>The game is played on a hex grid using pre-selected moves for each gladiator. The moves can be written down on a piece of paper but another popular alternative is to create separate cards for each move. The selected moves are compared on a matrix that gives the difficulty for a strike to hit the opponent. As the game goes on the gladiators gain wounds of varying severity and eventually the loser is either killed or begs for mercy from the crowds.<br/><br/>The game includes a system for playing campaigns where each player represents a gladiator school. Initially the schools own half a dozen or so gladiators of varying types (myrmidon, hoplomachon, thracian, etc). Over a campaign year the schools participate in festivals where they compete for the prize money but also can bet between each other. As the campaign progresses individual gladiators gain experience, die, get wounded, and may even earn their freedom. The schools use the money they earn to buy new gladiators but the unfortunate may be driven to bankruptcy.<br/><br/>There are 12 different gladiator types each of which has a different selection of moves. For example, a spear-armed hoplomachus has different moves than a retiarius who wields a trident and a net.<br/><br/>In addition to regular gladiatorial combat, the game includes rules for mounted combat, archery and beast fights. Multi-gladiator and multi-player combats are possible allowing team fights, last-man-standing games etc.<br/><br/>Some play aids can be downloaded from the publisher's Yahoo group.

Four times Grumm have died, and those who mourned have called for the Assemblage, claws unsheathed. Before, the enemy was excised, without pity or hate. The Grumm are the children of war, but they take no joy from killing. It is a tool, applied as all others are applied, to secure tomorrow. Those who threatened the future died, whether in their ships or on the ground, until they posed no threat.

As they attempt to consolidate and expand their holdings, a variety of invading nations threaten to overwhelm them, as they overwhelmed Rome. The game combines &ldquo;Euro&rdquo; elements with a light historical wargame.  The game uses no dice; players use cards to influence combat, and also use event cards to control non-Germanic invaders and influence other players.  Scoring occurs each century, with the last century counting much more than others.<br/><br/>In some ways this is a game of survival, of maintaining a civilization.  It is possible to win without directly attacking other players, though successful players usually directly attack another player at some point in the game.<br/><br/>Players take turns executing a variety of Actions up to a limit of six Action Points.  Some of the Actions are creating new settlers, moving pieces, and playing Event Cards.  Three or (in Standard and Advanced games) four rounds of turns are a century.  Invasions occur at the end of each Century, or they may occur because of an Event Card played by a player.  One player or another temporarily controls Invaders as they invade.  Players attempt to increase the number of settled areas, improve those areas, and, in Standard and Advanced games, build cities.  They will probably fight Invaders, and may fight one another, using Battle Cards to help resolve these fights.<br/><br/>"}, "36785": {"boardgamedesigner": ["(Uncredited)"], "poll": [], "name": "Space Race 2000", "playingtime": "0", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": ["Roll / Spin and Move"], "yearpublished": "1987", "usersrated": "1", "maxplayers": "4", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic339505_t.jpg", "average": "2.5", "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["Rejal C"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic339505.jpg", "maxplaytime": "0", "boardgamecategory": ["Space Exploration"], "age": "0", "minplaytime": "0", "description": "Space Race 2000 was developed after 2 1/2 years research and testing by its Seattle, Washington inventor.

The only thing they agree on is that K'uhul is a gate to untold power.<br/><br/>As their increasingly heated arguments begin to disrupt the local village--the village Head Man decides to end the bickering by holding a contest: the first shaman to be able to successfully activate the power of K'uhul will win the respect and riches of the village, while the loser will be sacrificed to appease Coatlicue--who is no doubt annoyed by the constant bickering.<br/><br/>The contest is held on a 3x3 grid within the ring of sacred statues. The ring of statues is formed by making piles of &quot;gate chips&quot; which surround 9 single chips which form the gate itself. The gate chips come in two styles, Runes and Stars, and the 3x3 pattern they form must be manipulated to match that of one of the special &quot;gate cards&quot;. By arranging the chips to match the pattern of a gate card, a shaman can &quot;unlock&quot; the gate.<br/><br/>Gameplay is further complicated by the presence of several types of &quot;special&quot; chips as well as &quot;spell&quot; cards that are activated when a gate card is &quot;unlocked&quot;.<br/><br/>The first player to successfully &quot;unlock&quot; two of the face-up gate cards PLUS a final gate card from their own hand, will be declared the winner.
