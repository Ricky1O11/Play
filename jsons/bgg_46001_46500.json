In return for his Patron's favour, your Champion must undertake to fight rival Champions and further the divine aims of his Chaos Power in the mortal world.<br/><br/>Warhammer Fantasy Battle players can also use this book to create Daemonic Armies of the Chaos Powers Nurgle and Tzeentch. Daemonic Armies are so tremendously powerful and highly magical that they are only suitable for fighting each other. This they do more or less continuously as their masters pitch them against each other to test their relative strengths. Champions of Chaos who have grown sufficiently powerful may be summoned to the daemonic battlefield to fight on behalf of their patron.<br/><br/>Warhammer 40,000 players can also create their own Champions to fight each other or any of the other forces of the Imperium. Players can also use this book to design armies of Chaos Renegades and Traitor Marines which confront the Imperium for control of the galaxy.<br/><br/>Warhammer Fantasy Roleplay players can use this book either to create an unusual character type in the Chaos Champion, or to generate endless adversaries for more conventional characters. The narrative generators can also be used as the basis for adventures against or on behalf of the Chaos Powers, and also provide many ideas which you can develop into game plots yourself.<br/><br/><br/>User Summary:<br/><br/>The second part of Realm of Chaos detailing the gods of chaos in Games Workshop's various universes. Weighed in at 300 pages.<br/><br/>Originally written for Warhammer Fantasy Roleplay, Games Workshop had lost some of the IP rights to that world and so promptly quit officially supporting it.<br/><br/>Officially listed as only a supplement for Warhammer Fantasy Battles and Warhammer 40,000, the background material was only useful for Warhammer Fantasy Roleplay. Also, there were Warhammer Fantasy Roleplay stats provided for all the creature included herein.<br/><br/>Focused on the gods Nurgle and Tzeentch, The Lost and the Damned included extensive rules on &quot;narrative campaigns&quot;.<br/><br/>However, the one bad thing about this book was the binding was exceedingly brittle, and the pages very easily separated from it with just minimal use of the book. Plus, unlike Slaves to Darkness, it was never reprinted.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "0", "rpgsetting": ["Warhammer 40,000", "Warhammer World"], "maxplaytime": "0", "statistics": [], "average": "7.88882", "rpgdesigner": ["Bryan Ansell", "Rick Priestley"], "name": "Realm of Chaos: The Lost and the Damned", "playingtime": "0", "age": "0", "boardgameexpansion": ["Warhammer", "Warhammer 40,000: Rogue Trader"], "usersrated": "76", "rpgissuearticle": ["Realm of Chaos: The Lost and the Damned Review"], "rpggenre": ["Fantasy (High Fantasy)", "Fantasy (Low Fantasy)", "Fantasy (Science Fantasy)"], "rpgpublisher": ["Games Workshop Ltd."], "rpgcategory": ["Sourcebook (rules/options to enhance play)"], "boardgamefamily": ["Warhammer 40,000 Wargames", "Warhammer Fantasy Wargames"]}, "46081": {"rpgdesigner": ["Ray Greer", "George MacDonald (I)", "Steve Peterson", "Mike Pondsmith", "Greg Stolze"], "rpgitemversion": ["Softcover version"], "statistics": [], "name": "Usagi Yojimbo Role-Playing Game", "rpgartist": ["Stan Sakai"], "rpgproducer": ["Mark Arsenault"], "usersrated": "17", "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic505810.jpg", "rpgmechanic": ["Dice (Primarily d6)"], "average": "6", "rpgissuearticle": ["Brian's Small Press Picks"], "rpggenre": ["Animal (Anthropomorphic)", "Animation / Comics (Western Cartoon / Comic)", "Culture (Asian / Far Eastern)"], "rpgpublisher": ["Gold Rush Games"], "rpg": ["Usagi Yojimbo Role-Playing Game"], "rpgcategory": ["Campaign Setting (game world)", "Core Rules (min needed to play)"], "poll": [], "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic505810_t.jpg", "description": "Using the Fuzion system, this book brings the world of Usagi Yojimbo to roleplaying.

If I don't specifically say you can use it, you can't. There are job openings in Gull - if you sign on, follow the directions at your place of employment.<br/><br/>This dungeon was designed with the well-rounded, mid-level character in mind.

If you forget to go there - and you are not reminded inside - then you die.<br/><br/>At times your rewards will be in technologically advanced or magical devices. If you recover any of these, they are worth 1000 experience points (e.p.s.) when you leave the dungeon.<br/><br/>Whenver you come to an intersection, you must roll up a WANDERING PERSON (&quot;WP&quot;) and figure out what happens to you. The WPs are listed at the back of the book. It is worth your while to read through that section before beginning.<br/><br/>There are a couple of places where you can leave the dungeon without returning to your hotel.

These shuffling horrors stumble forth from shallow graves at the beckoning of dreadful necromancers. They stir in forgotten barrows and ancient tombs. They flit through the mists of the curling fog that blanket the fallow fields and haunt the alleys, marking scenes of old crimes and bloody murders. But amongst these vestiges of life - these rotting, twisted, tortured forms - there are those who excite us, who awaken a dark fantasy of fascination. They are the night's dark masters, the Vampires, and they are the cunning lords of wickedness and evil, preying on mortals as a wolf hunts sheep. They can be beautiful and alluring, forever frozen in their youth, or hulking and monstrous, twisted by the corruption of their tainted blood. Regardless of their form, they are a dangerous threat, masterminds of countless plots and sinister designs, and their power, their majesty, makes slaves of all who live under the pall they cast.<br/><br/>Night's Dark Masters lifts the shroud from the Vampires, revealing everything you could want to know about Vampires in the Old World. Inside these blood-slick pages, you'll find:<br/><br/>- A detailed history of Vampires to shed light on their origins and machinations.<br/><br/>- Scholars' accounts that offer flavourful advice to would-be Vampire hunters.<br/><br/>- A detailed examination of the form and function of Vampires, cataloguing their strengths and weaknesses.<br/><br/>- A comprehensive overview of the five major bloodlines, as well as example villains for use straight out of the book.<br/><br/>- A complete gazetteer of Sylvania.<br/><br/>- Exhaustive details for creating Vampire adversaries and Vampire hunters, including new careers such as the Grave Warden and Black Guard.<br/><br/>- A bestiary that expands the Undead horrors of the Old World, presenting statistics for terrifying monsters like Scuttling Hands and Wraithwisps.<br/><br/>This tome is packed with information on some of WFRP's most notorious Undead, revealing the character and nature of these nocturnal fiends. Armed with this book, you can construct elaborate adventures that feature Vampires as the central antagonists or as supporting characters for some greater nemesis.

Players will try to define the key issue in the states. Will McCain dominate the national security debate, or can Obama play on people's fears over the economy? As the campaign manager of a national presidential campaign, you will either identify the road to the White House, or the road to irrelevance.<br/><br/>User review: The object of the game (and it is a game, not a simulation) is to lead your candidate, John McCain or Barack Obama, to victory by getting 270 electoral votes. Twenty battleground states are up for grabs in this game of cardplay.<br/><br/>Each player has a deck of forty five Campaign Strategy cards; only fifteen can be used in the game. (The rules suggest a selected fifteen cards for novices.) Each player also has a deck of ten battleground state tiles. Each player will select two of their states to put into play. (again, the rules make a suggestion for novices.)<br/>In turn, a player either plays a card from one's own hand and follows the instructions on it or draws a card if fewer than five are already held.<br/><br/>To win a state, a player must get complete support from the state's voters in the issue which has more support of the people. Each state also has two key demographics. A shift in which demographic takes precidence also may affect the effect of a player's cards.<br/><br/>Some cards require players to go &quot;negative.&quot; These cards require the opponent to roll a die and the result may give the opponent an unintended benefit.<br/><br/>Whenever a player wins a state, the electoral votes are added to that candidate's tally. A state is brought into play by the winning manager and chance card is put into effect.<br/><br/>The game is over when one manager scores 270 electoral votes. That player is the winner.

Scarrport is widely known as the gateway to the Hellfury Peaks - a mysterious region where evil festers in every crag, it&rsquo;s influence spreading across the region like a raging firestorm. Unholy hell spawn roam the rugged mountain range, preying on unwary travelers and adventurers who seek to make their fortunes exploring the countless ruins dotting the land. Dangerous cults who worship dark gods riddle Scarrport&rsquo;s four boroughs, using the city as a base of operations from which they spread their influence to other kingdoms.<br/><br/>No place for the na&iuml;ve, the thieves and grifters of Scarrport lurk around every corner of this bustling city, preying on newcomers like a school of night fang eels on deep water trout. The unwary are soon parted with their money and possessions in this dangerous city or on the myriad river boats that stop in Scarrport to offload goods and pick up passengers. Yet, despite its unsavory reputation, Scarrport is a magnet for heroes in search of adventure. From the brothels, drug houses and gambling dens of the Fens to the boats traveling the Torberyn and Wellspring Rivers, or beyond the city in the demon-infested Hellfury Peaks and the tangled Dark Wood, the possibilities for adventure are boundless.<br/><br/>Inside this Campaign Cutout you&rsquo;ll find:<br/><br/>     A new 30 level character class: The Elementalist.<br/>     Three new player races; Ghodon, Gremlins and Otterkin.<br/>     New magic items, implements and equipment.<br/>     Steampunk items and guns such as the Babel Springstep pistol.<br/>     New hazards!<br/>     New creatures!<br/>     An introductory adventure; The Iron Lumberjack!<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>And much more!<br/><br/>"}, "46316": {"rpgdesigner": ["Brett M.

The game is set in a unique fantasy world, a giant tree peopled by eight prime species which can be played by participants in the game, and by numerous other sentient species, animals, and plants.<br/><br/><br/>The world is an immense tree, under a crystalline sun rolling on a track in the sky. Its branches are fifty miles wide and thousands long, and their flat upper sides are the home of civilization. The sides of the branches are tangled and untamed; wilderness is never far from even the greatest city.<br/><br/>The godlings who created the World Tree made the eight prime species the focus of attention. Four primes are the most common:<br/><br/><br/>     Cani are dogfolk, social, tangled and strengthened by their complex webs of loyalties. <br/>     Herethroy are anthropomorphic crickets or beetles: agrarian, six-limbed, musical, strong. <br/>     Orren are otterfolk, wild and excitable, picking up new interests quickly when the old ones become boring. <br/>     Rassimel are raccoonfolk--clever, devoted to a few life-long interests that border on obsession. <br/><br/><br/>The four other primes are much rarer:<br/><br/>     Gormoror are bearfolk, brave and heroic. <br/>     Khtsoyis are floating air-octopi, violent and often criminal. <br/>     Sleeth are non-anthropomorphic panthers, predators and loners, feared by many. <br/>     Zi Ri, rarest of all, are small immortal dragons, and the old ones bear much force and much lore. <br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>A thousand other species oppose, befriend, trade with or ignore the primes.<br/><br/>The eight species live together, and their civilization is advanced--most like 18th-century Earth, with occasional bits of far future, neither utopian nor dystopian. Countries are typically city-states strung like beads along the branches.<br/><br/>World Tree magic is as sophisticated as any terrestrial technology, as widely available, and as practical. Cley, the currency of magic, is available to everyone in a limited daily supply. A baker might have spells to bake a loaf instantly, to clean hands--or to scorch a mugger. Professional wizards can do considerably more: chains of teleport gates are vital to commerce; enchanted city walls keep the wilderness at bay; sentient illusions are masterpieces of art.<br/><br/>"}, "46338": {"rpgdesigner": ["Brett M.

One of the basic components of this game is the &quot;Pedigree Card&quot; shown in a diagram below.  It will be noticed that in each case the parents are to the right of their children. The Father is always on the upper line; the Mother is on the lower.  The numbering system begins with the person whose ancestry is being sought.  Number 2 on the chart is the searcher's father; Number 3 is his or her mother, etc.  It will also be noted that all male names have even numbers and all female names have odd numbers.  Another interesting fact is that each father is double the number of his child.  Hence if Number 2 is a Smith, Number 4, 8, 16, 32 etc. would also be Smiths.  This could go on indefinitely, and in spite of the infeasibility of putting 10 or 15 generations of ancestors on one chart, one can easily relate to a certain ancestor 13 generations back on one of his surname lines by the pedigree number of that ancestor.&quot;<br/><br/>"}, "46393": {"rpgdesigner": ["Joseph Hillmer", "George Rahm"], "rpgitemversion": ["Bundled edition"], "poll": [], "name": "Barony", "rpgartist": ["Todd Pickens"], "usersrated": "1", "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic507072.jpg", "rpgmechanic": ["Cards (cards drive the action)", "Dice (Primarily d8)"], "average": "5", "rpgissuearticle": ["A Tale for a Bored Court", "Capsule Reviews", "Caravan of Doom!", "Death of the Viper", "Role-playing Reviews", "The Viper Strikes"], "rpg": ["Barony", "Conrad's Fantasy"], "rpgpublisher": ["Better Games"], "statistics": [], "rpgcategory": ["Core Rules (min needed to play)"], "rpggenre": ["Fantasy (High Fantasy)"], "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic507072_t.jpg", "description": "Barony is an unusual game, containing three books.
