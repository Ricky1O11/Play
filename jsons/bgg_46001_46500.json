As a Champion of Chaos, your hero will earn special rewards from his patron, including super-human abilities, magical gifts, and daemonic followers. In return for his Patron's favour, your Champion must undertake to fight rival Champions and further the divine aims of his Chaos Power in the mortal world.<br/><br/>Warhammer Fantasy Battle players can also use this book to create Daemonic Armies of the Chaos Powers Nurgle and Tzeentch. Daemonic Armies are so tremendously powerful and highly magical that they are only suitable for fighting each other. This they do more or less continuously as their masters pitch them against each other to test their relative strengths. Champions of Chaos who have grown sufficiently powerful may be summoned to the daemonic battlefield to fight on behalf of their patron.<br/><br/>Warhammer 40,000 players can also create their own Champions to fight each other or any of the other forces of the Imperium. Players can also use this book to design armies of Chaos Renegades and Traitor Marines which confront the Imperium for control of the galaxy.<br/><br/>Warhammer Fantasy Roleplay players can use this book either to create an unusual character type in the Chaos Champion, or to generate endless adversaries for more conventional characters.

This is the first open-air solitaire dungeon. It is set in the City of Gull on the sunbaked tropical island of Phoron. You come by ship, you disembark and are taken by carriage to the hotel.<br/><br/>You take a room and tip the clerk 20 gps to make sure that your things don't get ripped off. Between adventures, you may drop stuff off in your room, change your clothing, or exchange your weapons.<br/><br/>Any humanoid creature, be it orc, ogre, or elf may journey here. If you happen to be a man-tiger (courtesy of the justifiably infamous Ken St. Andre and the Deathtrap Equalizer Dungeon) you will find what your are looking for to the east of the hotel.<br/><br/>Magic may be used, but only in the very limited way it is allowed here. If I don't specifically say you can use it, you can't. There are job openings in Gull - if you sign on, follow the directions at your place of employment.<br/><br/>This dungeon was designed with the well-rounded, mid-level character in mind. However, at times a first-leveler will win out where a superhero loses. Keep this in mind. IF YOU ARE KILLED AS THE RESULT OF MISSING A SAVING ROLL, YOU MAY GO TO 4D AND GET ANOTHER CHANCE AT LIFE. If you forget to go there - and you are not reminded inside - then you die.<br/><br/>At times your rewards will be in technologically advanced or magical devices. If you recover any of these, they are worth 1000 experience points (e.p.s.) when you leave the dungeon.<br/><br/>Whenver you come to an intersection, you must roll up a WANDERING PERSON (&quot;WP&quot;) and figure out what happens to you. The WPs are listed at the back of the book. It is worth your while to read through that section before beginning.<br/><br/>There are a couple of places where you can leave the dungeon without returning to your hotel. If you do so, you forfeit all the equipment, treasure and what have you which you left behind in your hotel room.<br/><br/>Saving rolls are made on all of the attributes at one point or another. Unless specified, all saving rolls will be made on Luck, and they are to be made AT THE CHARACTER'S OWN LEVEL.<br/><br/>You will need dice, the rules to TUNNELS AND TROLLS, and maybe a deck of cards. Paper and pencil are vital and well.<br/><br/>Good luck. Be wary. The City of Terrors can live up to its name.

They are the night's dark masters, the Vampires, and they are the cunning lords of wickedness and evil, preying on mortals as a wolf hunts sheep. They can be beautiful and alluring, forever frozen in their youth, or hulking and monstrous, twisted by the corruption of their tainted blood. Regardless of their form, they are a dangerous threat, masterminds of countless plots and sinister designs, and their power, their majesty, makes slaves of all who live under the pall they cast.<br/><br/>Night's Dark Masters lifts the shroud from the Vampires, revealing everything you could want to know about Vampires in the Old World.

The rules are simple, yet robust, and keep the action moving:<br/><br/>Roll a number of 10-sided dice based on ability. Each die less than or equal to skill level is a step. The task's difficulty determines how many steps you need to succeed. Apart from some modifiers and variable outcomes (for magic), that's it.<br/><br/>The game is story-centric, so characters perform tasks based on what they want to do, not what the rules tell them to do--dice can be bypassed in many situations and odds of success increased with experience, concentration, and assistance by others.<br/><br/>Diceless play is also possible when used in conjunction with Active Exploits Diceless Roleplaying. Or, use the genreDiversion i rules (genreDiversion i Manual, HardNova ][, Active Exploits Diceless Softcover) for 2d6 play.

The game is set in a unique fantasy world, a giant tree peopled by eight prime species which can be played by participants in the game, and by numerous other sentient species, animals, and plants.<br/><br/><br/>The world is an immense tree, under a crystalline sun rolling on a track in the sky. Its branches are fifty miles wide and thousands long, and their flat upper sides are the home of civilization. The sides of the branches are tangled and untamed; wilderness is never far from even the greatest city.<br/><br/>The godlings who created the World Tree made the eight prime species the focus of attention. Four primes are the most common:<br/><br/><br/>     Cani are dogfolk, social, tangled and strengthened by their complex webs of loyalties. <br/>     Herethroy are anthropomorphic crickets or beetles: agrarian, six-limbed, musical, strong. <br/>     Orren are otterfolk, wild and excitable, picking up new interests quickly when the old ones become boring. <br/>     Rassimel are raccoonfolk--clever, devoted to a few life-long interests that border on obsession. <br/><br/><br/>The four other primes are much rarer:<br/><br/>     Gormoror are bearfolk, brave and heroic. <br/>     Khtsoyis are floating air-octopi, violent and often criminal. <br/>     Sleeth are non-anthropomorphic panthers, predators and loners, feared by many. <br/>     Zi Ri, rarest of all, are small immortal dragons, and the old ones bear much force and much lore. <br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>A thousand other species oppose, befriend, trade with or ignore the primes.<br/><br/>The eight species live together, and their civilization is advanced--most like 18th-century Earth, with occasional bits of far future, neither utopian nor dystopian. Countries are typically city-states strung like beads along the branches.<br/><br/>World Tree magic is as sophisticated as any terrestrial technology, as widely available, and as practical. Cley, the currency of magic, is available to everyone in a limited daily supply. A baker might have spells to bake a loaf instantly, to clean hands--or to scorch a mugger. Professional wizards can do considerably more: chains of teleport gates are vital to commerce; enchanted city walls keep the wilderness at bay; sentient illusions are masterpieces of art.<br/><br/>"}, "46338": {"rpgitemversion": {"2402": "Electronic Version"}, "statistics": {}, "name": "Smuggler's Bane", "rpgproducer": {"10543": "Brett M.

Optional rules can either be ignored or easily implemented -- and provide a framework for building your own game elements. Consistent mechanics for characters, vehicles, and creatures avoid confusion. Built-in rules for magic, and guides for directing the game and adapting older titles expand the game's horizons even further. If you've been looking for a roleplaying game system that you can sink your teeth into quickly and has the versatility needed for just about any setting, look no further.<br/><br/>* Ability-Centric Characters<br/>      Focus on a character's raw potential rather than his training to get things done. While skill refines a character's accomplishments, raw talent makes them happen.<br/>    * Create Characters Your Way<br/>      Characters can be built using a variety of methods, from random choices to arbitrary or controlled assignments. Custom species and vocations can be created as a framework for characters in a particular setting. New gimmicks can be devised to add special powers, such as for the supernatural and scientific enhancements.<br/>    * Quick Resolution<br/>      Roll dice (two six-sided) only for tough and contested challenges, maintaining a smooth progression of story. Resolve focused situations like combat using a simple scale of difficulty that can be influenced by various factors. Utilize optional elements like experience to gain the advantage or exploits to make the most out of success.<br/>    * Vehicles and Monsters<br/>      Apply the same basic mechanics to vehicles and monsters, from cars and starships to dragons and sea monsters. Engage in chases, dog-fights, and even desperate battles with larger-than-life creatures.<br/>    * Miniatures and Maps<br/>      Miniatures and maps can be used to better visualize combat and vehicle interactions. While this adds a more tactical feel for those who prefer such elements, it is not required.<br/>    * Unbidden and Forsaken<br/>      Dive into the action with a ready-to-use modern setting based on our older Unbidden game.<br/>    * Compatibility<br/>      Convert or interact with characters/elements from genreDiversion i, Iron Gauntlets, Story Engine Classic, and Active Exploits Diceless Roleplaying.<br/><br/>"}, "46347": {"rpgitemversion": {"3269": "Electronic Version"}, "poll": {}, "name": "HardNova II", "rpghonor": {"13954": "2004 Indie RPG Awards - Best Support - Runner Up"}, "rpgproducer": {"10543": "Brett M.

HardNova II includes alien races, starships, exotic abilities, ready-to-play scenarios, reference sheets, and numerous character, robot, and starship templates.<br/><br/>HardNova II is a roleplaying game designed to be both easy to learn and fast-paced. The versatile genreDiversion i 2d6 rules make it perfect for one-shot games, extended play, or as a framework for your own ideas. Plus you can combine it with our Active Exploits Diceless System for diceless space opera. genreDiversion i games can also be combined to expand gaming options--mix and match custom rules and features from one game with another.<br/><br/>In short, HardNova II is fast, ready-to-use, and adaptable. You don't have to learn a complicated system, refer to scores of tables, or spend all day creating characters. The basic rules require very little study, and the advanced rules are not much more difficult to pick up. You can either create custom characters for the game or dive right in with any of the included templates. The game is designed to be light; it has a small footprint and extremely low price tag - it's not overloaded with tons of rules or an excess of information you just won't need. It's meant to get you running quickly so you can have a good time.<br/><br/>The setting is very open, taking place in our galaxy, where Earth formed an alliance (the United Sovereign Worlds, or USU) with several alien worlds as the result of a war with a hostile species. Two centuries later, that alien species is now a member of the alliance due to genetic and economic deficiencies (and some compassion from an Earth colony). They have assimilated well, but there is still discrimination. Even a synthetic race has joined the USU, allowing for some interesting gaming possibilities. The included scenarios immerse you into the setting so even if you don't want to the run them, you've still got a lot of info to work with to flavor your setting or inspire ideas. And if you don't want to use the setting, the rules are flexible enough to handle your own ideas or that of your favorite movie, television program, comic, or novel.<br/><br/>"}, "46348": {"rpg": {"3473": "EarthAD.2"}, "statistics": {}, "name": "EarthAD.2", "rpgproducer": {"10543": "Brett M.

One of the basic components of this game is the &quot;Pedigree Card&quot; shown in a diagram below.  It will be noticed that in each case the parents are to the right of their children. The Father is always on the upper line; the Mother is on the lower.  The numbering system begins with the person whose ancestry is being sought.  Number 2 on the chart is the searcher's father; Number 3 is his or her mother, etc.  It will also be noted that all male names have even numbers and all female names have odd numbers.  Another interesting fact is that each father is double the number of his child.  Hence if Number 2 is a Smith, Number 4, 8, 16, 32 etc. would also be Smiths.  This could go on indefinitely, and in spite of the infeasibility of putting 10 or 15 generations of ancestors on one chart, one can easily relate to a certain ancestor 13 generations back on one of his surname lines by the pedigree number of that ancestor.&quot;<br/><br/>"}, "46393": {"rpgitemversion": {"2441": "Bundled edition"}, "poll": {}, "name": "Barony", "usersrated": "1", "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic507072.jpg", "rpgmechanic": {"2114": "Cards (cards drive the action)"}, "average": "5", "rpgissuearticle": {"56793": "Capsule Reviews"}, "rpg": {"1212": "Barony"}, "statistics": {}, "rpgcategory": {"2083": "Core Rules (min needed to play)"}, "rpggenre": {"155": "Fantasy (High Fantasy)"}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic507072_t.jpg", "description": "Barony is an unusual game, containing three books.
