It has taken over one hundred years to complete the first block of 42 shafts from the surface to the core.<br/><br/>But now the time has come. From every shaft surges the hot steam that is the basis of the production of raw materials. To be able to use and process this steam, platforms have to be placed over the shafts. Later, we can use the platforms to connect the water purification tanks. By using several tank extractors, we can harvest other resources like energy, ore, and quartz from the steam. These resources are important. You will need them to grow your steam empires. You will need to increase the capacity of your landing craft to transport your harvested materials off planet. Buy and sell the resources at the Trading terminal for profit, as currency is &ndash; like on earth &ndash; always in short supply on Steam. To help you in your endeavours, the IPF has placed several specialists at your command &ndash; but getting the specialist that you require may not be easy.<br/><br/>Planet Steam is a board game in which two to five players take the roles of entrepreneurs in a steampunk boomtown, racing to assemble equipment, claim plots of land, extract resources, and accumulate riches. After harvesting resources using tanks and converters, players must buy and sell those resources in a volatile and ever-shifting market. The one who earns the most income will, in the end, be victorious.

In the original only the central 20 spaces are covered, in the later version all 44 spaces (not counting the four starting spaces). Players roll the die and move their pawns on the board. If they land on a face-down tile, this is revealed and acted on, and then turned face down again. If it depicts 1, 2 or 3 coins/blueberries, the player may take that number of couns/berries from the pool. The remaining symbols differ between the editions:<br/><br/>Norwegian edition: If a bear tile is revealed, the bear wakes up, and all players currently in the lair lose one coin. If a player lands on one of the bear paw symbols (printed on some of the non-covered spaces, not found on a token), two face-down tiles may be swapped.<br/><br/>Swedish edition: If it is a bear tile, the player loses one berry. If players stop on a face-up troll tile, the player may pick up the tile and use it to defend against the bear. Face-up bear print tiles may be used to swap two face-down tiles around (so that if players remember where the 3-berry tiles are they can use this to their advantage).<br/><br/>When all coins/blueberries are taken, the player with the most coins/berries is the winner.<br/><br/>Contents of the Swedish version:<br/>Gameboard<br/>44 wooden gameboard tiles<br/>10 spare wooden tiles<br/>27 wooden blueberry tiles<br/>4 pawns<br/>1 oversized die, numbered 2-2-3-3-4-4<br/>Rules<br/><br/>Contents of the Norwegian version:<br/>Gameboard<br/>20 cardbord gameboard tiles<br/>20 cardbord gold coins<br/>4 pawns<br/>1 die (not stated if this is numbered 1&ndash;6 or 2&ndash;4)<br/>(Rules are printed on the back of the box)<br/><br/>4 years and up (Norwegian version is given as 5+, but is actually slightly simpler than the Swedish marked 4+).

It can also be used for older teen groups!<br/><br/>Another difference is that the murder happens before the game. Being a couples murder mystery we felt it would be too complicated to murder them both or only one. That is not to say that there won't be more murders during the evening. Those tend to happen in our games since we provide a lot of intrigue outside of the murder itself.<br/><br/>This is the same game as our Class of '57, but we removed all reference to year &amp; school so that people could customize it to any year, decade or school. We have areas in the game that can be customized by you to perfectly match your event.<br/><br/>The 12 player version has 6 couples and we include our 2 Extra Character Packets to expand the game up to 32. The Extra Character Packets add a little quirky flavor to the party, but not all of these 20 extra characters may be suitable for conservative groups. (Remember... these are included FREE in the 12 player version, no need to purchase them!)<br/><br/>Home Page: <a target='_blank' href='http://www.dinnerandamurder.com/games/killerreunion.htm' rel='nofollow'>http://www.dinnerandamurder.com/games/killerreunion.htm</a><br/><br/>"}, "23098": {"boardgamedesigner": {"8550": {"name": "Mary Ferrin"}}, "average": "0", "poll": {}, "name": "Death by Chocolate", "playingtime": "180", "minplayers": "8", "boardgamemechanic": {"2028": "Role Playing"}, "yearpublished": "0", "usersrated": "0", "boardgamefamily": {"5841": "Food / Cooking"}, "maxplayers": "21", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic197017_t.jpg", "boardgameartist": {"27044": "Darryl Taylor"}, "statistics": {}, "boardgamepublisher": {"5204": {"name": "Dinner and a Murder Mystery Games LLC"}}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic197017.jpg", "maxplaytime": "180", "boardgamecategory": {"1040": {"name": "Murder/Mystery"}}, "age": "18", "minplaytime": "180", "description": "From the Publisher's web site:<br/><br/>Death By Chocolate is a game for 8-16 women with an optional 5 male characters.

For 14 to 40 guests!<br/><br/>The Last Gasp is a Victorian murder mystery which runs for about three hours. Everyone taking part is given a character in the plot. As well as having a murder to investigate, characters will also have their own, secret objectives. Why does the church choir only accept female members? Where is the Earl hiding all his money? Can anyone persuade Captain Ratliffe to do the decent thing? At &quot;The Last Gasp&quot;, anything can happen - and generally does!<br/><br/>The Plot<br/><br/>It is New Year's Eve, 1899. George Sweet, the 5th Earl of Coddingham, has lead a wicked and dissolute life. His past is finally catching up with him and, eager to keep out of reach of the law, he is planning to flee abroad. Before he goes, he is holding one final party: &quot;The Last Gasp&quot;. Invited to it are all the people to whom his appalling behavior has brought the most grief and heartache: his ex-wives, Florence and Dawn, his present wife, Jojo, his ballet dancer son, William, and his long-suffering friend, Bernard. George is determined to use his party to make up for past mistakes.<br/><br/><br/>People from the Earl's local village and members of his staff are also at &quot;The Last Gasp&quot;: the local vicar is recruiting new members for the church choir, cavalry officer Captain Ratliffe is breaking a few more women's hearts, and Jarvis, the Earl's loyal butler, is making sure no one steals the sherry. The Earl's plans go slightly awry, however, when the police unexpectedly turn up, hoping to arrest someone for murder. Who do they want to arrest?

Cactus Gulch is one such small town. Founded 20 years ago, tonight it has a festive air as the townsfolk get set to start their 20th anniversary celebrations. Plus, the railway is coming! However, all is not running smoothly.

When the Duke of Felthorpe is found dead in his bath, everything suggests that his death was accidental. The room was locked from the inside and, to gain entry, the door had to be broken down. So surely no one could have got in there and killed him!<br/><br/>Everyone taking part plays a character who is here for the reading of the duke&rsquo;s Last Will and Testament. The contents of the will are a surprise to almost all of them. So why did the duke make these last-minute changes? Was he being blackmailed? Was he mad? Should this will be thrown out &ndash; and replaced with an earlier one?<br/><br/>The murder mystery usually takes place during a meal. Fresh clues are introduced as the plot gradually unravels and evidence of murder emerges. One of the characters is the duke&rsquo;s butler &ndash; did he do it? Or was it the duke&rsquo;s maid? His idiot son? His idiot son&rsquo;s scheming wife? By the time all is revealed, everyone will have had a great time playing their parts, working out whodunnit and trying to prevent other people accusing them.<br/><br/>Who is the Reading of the Will suitable for? Almost anyone! No acting experience is needed to enjoy it and no one will be expected to do anything that will make them feel awkward.

It seems that Aurora's lifeless body was found on the cold, dirt floor of her cell in the Salem Prison for Wicked Women.  The letter &quot;A&quot; had been hastily sewn to the bodice of her dress and a black candle was found in her left hand. Aurora's lips had been stitched closed, coins had been placed on her eyelids and a hazelnut was found in each ear.<br/><br/>So what happened?<br/><br/>Many of the townspeople had been witness to strange and uncanny happenings around and about the Nightstorm cottage.  Some say that Aurora could take down a huge oak, chop it into firewood and stack it at her back door....with just the twitch of her nose. Others testify to have seen Aurora levitate to the top of her roof to rescue her curious, black feline....her faithful companion, &quot;Wee Gee&quot;.....and children claim to have seen Aurora fly through the sky chasing vampire bats. Therefore, it should be of no surprise that Governor Giles Bickford was presented with a petition for her arrest. The document had been signed by every man, woman and child in Salem.  Hence, the Governor had no alternative but to bring charges of &quot;Witchcraft&quot; against Aurora Nightstorm.<br/><br/>The trial was swift, the outcome, evident. Aurora was to swing from the gallows until dead.  But sometime during the pre-dawn hours someone paid Aurora a &quot;final visit&quot;. Alas, the townspeople will witness no vengeance against Aurora, their proclaimed, evil one. Who was it that dared enter her cell?  Who had reason to preempt the hangman?....and why??  To resolve this mystery one must be ready to venture back to the days of witch-hunts and sorcery.

Everyone is given a character, and whether you end up playing a Lord, a Lady, a dustman or a horse meat wholesaler, you will encounter more skulduggery, adultery, coercion and crime than in the entire works of Jilly Cooper, Joanna Trollope and Dick Francis. <br/> Lady Amanda Cudham, founder and chairwoman of the club, has died in tragic and mysterious circumstances. Our plot unfolds during a meeting of the club, where members decide who should replace Amanda as chairwoman.<br/><br/>Invitations are sent out in advance, so everyone knows which character they are playing and understands some of the background. The plot is usually run over a meal and, as well as solving the murder, characters are given other objectives to achieve. Some, for instance, want to become the next chairwoman. Some have guilty secrets to keep hidden. Some have scores to settle. And everyone is keen to get rich, buy and sell a few horses, and place a few bets before the Race of the Season (the Isle of Man Handicap) gets underway.<br/><br/>No knowledge of horses is needed to run or enjoy this plot. How much guests become involved is up to each individual but, in our own experience, even the quiet ones become utterly caught up in the action.<br/><br/>Towards the end, a live commentary of the Isle of Man Handicap is read out and winning bets are paid out. The guest playing Inspector Dawdley then gets everyone into teams and invites each of them to put forward their solution. Finally, Dawdley reads out the correct solution, arrests the murderer and brings a fun-filled, highly entertaining and irresistibly silly occasion to a close.<br/><br/>Word of warning:<br/><br/>The behavior of some of the characters in &quot;Cudham Riding Club&quot; is appalling: they take drugs, they gamble, they cheat on their partners, they kill.

Why, they even held a tea party in Boston to honor King George and to present their &quot;DECLARATION OF DE-PENDENCE&quot;.  This document begged for more British intervention and rule. Life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness were a little harder than expected.  Their Declaration revealed an emotional pleas for more taxes, more stern governors and the security of the Army.<br/><br/>So what happened?  Well, unfortunately for the colonists, King George was fed up the &quot;American Leaches&quot; and wanted to sever all ties.

The object of the game is to get to the other side of the game board.<br/>2. The game board is divided into squares, but you're not told how many squares wide or long it is.<br/>3. You can only step on a square if it has a tile on it. You can step on any tile, even if it was made by another player.<br/>4. If you step on an empty square, or the tile you're standing on breaks, then you &quot;fall in&quot; and have to swim back to the nearest tile.<br/>5. Each empty square that either borders a tile or the starting edge of the game board has a question visible on it. The questions are very simple and have single answers, such as &quot;why does water flow downhill?&quot; or &quot;why can light pass through glass?&quot; or &quot;what is heat?&quot;<br/>6. The only way to make new tiles is by making-up an answer to the question.<br/>7. A tile will only float if you can verify the answer with a reproducible test.<br/>8. A tile can only be broken by proving the answer is wrong with a reproducible test.<br/>9. A test can't break a tile if its results can't be reproduced, a tile can't float if the verifying test's results can't be reproduced.<br/>10. If a tile is broken, then all tiles ahead of it that cannot be connected back to the starting edge by another continuous series of tiles will be broken as well.<br/>11.

They may have some secrets from each other, but overall they will be working to protect each other. This gives the game a romantic flavor.

This game is great for church groups and others who are worried about the possibility of offending guests.

Also, optionally, players can play the game as a trivia game, wherein on each turn, the puck-carrying player must answer a hockey-themed trivia question from a provided question booklet, or he forfeits control of the puck.<br/><br/>"}, "23171": {"boardgamedesigner": {"3": {"name": "(Uncredited)"}}, "poll": {}, "name": "Murder in Metropolis!", "playingtime": "0", "minplayers": "8", "boardgamemechanic": {"2028": "Role Playing"}, "yearpublished": "0", "usersrated": "0", "maxplayers": "12", "average": "0", "statistics": {}, "boardgamepublisher": {"9445": {"name": "The Butler Didn't Do It!"}}, "maxplaytime": "0", "boardgamecategory": {"1116": {"name": "Comic Book / Strip"}}, "age": "18", "minplaytime": "0", "description": "It was a gray day for all the world's comic book readers to learn that the robot that was once the famous, &quot;Robo Gal&quot; was found deprogrammed behind the old Metropolis Theater.

The game includes 15 different mysteries for players to solve and uses some clever tools that players must employ to solve the mysteries. An instructional DVD that explains the game and shows an example mystery being solved is also included.<br/><br/>There are 2 phases to the game. In the first phase players roll and move their pieces around the board to visit various sites to look at clue cards so they can figure out the mystery phrase first. Each of these clues require a different mechanism to solve. Some use a mirror to reverse the letters, some use a decoder box that is laid over the card in a certain way to reveal part of the mystery phrase, some cards you line up against a special decoder tool, and some are just riddles or puzzles to solve. Some clues will also require the player to do to the center of the board and visit the library to retrieve a card there with information that will help them solve their clue. Alternately, players might need to visit the Louvre and examine a painting there. When the players visit the Louvre the players only have 30 seconds to find the correct card with the painting that relates to their clue, examine the painting and the information on the card about the painting and hopefully discover the information they need to solve their current clue.<br/><br/>Players can also discover one of two special types of cards: Taxis which let the player move around board quicker and a computer card that lets you look at another player's notes for 30 seconds.<br/><br/>Once one player thinks they have solved the Mystery Phrase they go to the center of the board and announce the answer. If they are right then all players score 1 point for each letter (and blank space) they had correct in the Mystery Phrase. The player that got the Mystery Phrase correct gets 5 bonus points.<br/><br/>This begins Phase 2 of the game as 5 questions are now read from the mystery book. These questions relate to the clues that the players discovered during the game. Each question a player gets right is worth 5 points. If a player gets all 5 questions correct they score another 5 points.<br/><br/>Players lose points for any Taxi or Computer cards they had left in their hand at the end of the game.<br/><br/>The player with the highest score wins.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": {"197996": "Columbia Pictures/Rose Art edition 2006 in tin"}, "average": "5.10518", "name": "The Da Vinci Code Board Game: The Quest for the Truth", "playingtime": "120", "boardgamemechanic": {"2047": "Memory"}, "age": "12", "boardgameexpansion": {}, "usersrated": "199", "boardgamefamily": {"27580": "Leonardo da Vinci"}}, "23182": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic123733.jpg", "poll": {}, "boardgamedesigner": {"2389": {"name": "Eric Grenier"}}, "statistics": {}, "yearpublished": "2006", "maxplayers": "2", "boardgameartist": {"3": "(Uncredited)"}, "boardgamepublisher": {"3393": {"name": "Grenier Games"}}, "maxplaytime": "0", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic123733_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "0", "boardgamecategory": {"2726": {"name": "Age of Reason"}}, "boardgamehonor": {"10973": "2006 Charles S.

At that time, the railroad industry was driven by an abundant source of coal from the coal mines of Western Pennsylvania. Unique features to this map include coal-producing towns and cities in Western Pennsylvania, heavily-urbanized cities in Southeastern Pennsylvania, and special bonuses for coal (black cube) deliveries: coal can be delivered twice as far as your locomotive, or you can receive double income for its delivery!<br/><br/>Northern California: This Age of Steam expansion takes place in Northern California, focusing on San Francisco, Oakland, San Jose, Santa Cruz and Sacramento, and the struggle to move goods across the San Francisco Bay Area. Unique features to this map include two bridges across the San Francisco Bay, the port city of Santa Cruz where goods line up for delivery, a three tile San Jose city with double goods growth, and the ever-changing destination of Sacramento, where the goods desired by that city are dictated by the flow of goods into Santa Cruz.

It is similar in play and design as Senet.<br/><br/>The object is to be the first player to bear off all 5 of his pieces, by landing them precisely on the last square.<br/>Once successfully borne off, a piece plays no further part in the game.<br/><br/>PLAYER TURNS<br/>The players throw once each alternately, and move a single piece by the appropriate number of positions. A<br/>move must be made, and made in full. If no move is possible, then the turn is forfeit (passes to the other<br/>player). When forfeiting a throw, the opponent has the option of adding the forfeited throw to his own.<br/><br/>HOW TO MOVE THE PIECES<br/>Each player enters the pieces onto the board from his reserve and moves them as follows:<br/>Pieces move forward only. As pieces reach the last square (by exact throw), they bear off; be the first to<br/>bear off all your pieces and you win! The marked squares give you an extra turn; when you land on them, you<br/>get to throw the sticks and go again. Only one piece may occupy any given square; if you land on an opposing<br/>piece, it is removed &mdash;sent back to the player&rsquo;s reserve.<br/>To bring your first piece on, you must first throw a 4 or a 6; when that happens, you throw again and move<br/>the piece in by that amount. The remaining pieces can be brought in on any throw. Waiting for that initial<br/>throw of 4 or 6, particularly while the opponent is already moving, can be quite frustrating, so it is an acceptable<br/>variant to forego that rule entirely.<br/><br/>"}, "23212": {"boardgamedesigner": {"12783": {"name": "Manuel Meireles"}}, "poll": {}, "name": "Cockpit", "playingtime": "120", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": {"2078": "Point to Point Movement"}, "yearpublished": "1991", "usersrated": "29", "boardgamefamily": {"6206": "Sports: Auto Racing"}, "maxplayers": "6", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic271459_t.jpg", "average": "6.27348", "statistics": {}, "boardgamepublisher": {"858": {"name": "Grow Jogos e Brinquedos"}}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic271459.jpg", "boardgameversion": {"203659": "Grow Spanish Argentinian Edition"}, "maxplaytime": "120", "boardgamecategory": {"1031": {"name": "Racing"}}, "age": "10", "minplaytime": "120", "description": "A nice car race simulation, with many real components, like tires, suspension, brakes and gear manipulation.<br/><br/>"}, "23213": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic197092.jpg", "poll": {}, "boardgamedesigner": {"1501": {"name": "Jeffrey Neil Bellinger"}}, "statistics": {}, "boardgamecompilation": {"137827": "Killer Bunnies and the Quest for the Magic Carrot Deluxe Limited Edition"}, "yearpublished": "2006", "maxplayers": "8", "boardgameartist": {"28222": "Jonathan Young"}, "boardgamepublisher": {"244": {"name": "Playroom Entertainment"}}, "maxplaytime": "90", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic197092_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "90", "boardgamecategory": {"1002": {"name": "Card Game"}}, "description": "In the second set of Bunny Blanks, two more Psi series cards are released: Shazbot and After Darkness.

Pieces can never &ldquo;go through&rdquo; or &ldquo;jump over&rdquo; other pieces, both of the same or different colours.<br/><br/>Each piece can be oriented in four different ways (one per each side of the piece) enabling it to four different kind of movement.<br/><br/>The active roles is the one facing &ldquo;north&rdquo;.<br/><br/>These are the four roles a piece can assume:<br/><br/>- Warrior:<br/>        it moves 1 square and can't go backwards, in other words it can<br/>        move to one of the 5 squares adjacent to it (W, NW, N, NE, E);<br/>- Blade:<br/>        it moves 1 or 2 square &ldquo;forward&rdquo; (N);<br/>- Catapult:<br/>        it can move up to 3 squares diagonally going only forward, as<br/>        usual (NE, NW);<br/>- Shield:<br/>        the only role that can go backwards, it can move up to 2 squares<br/>        going South or just 1 square going diagonally (SW or SE).<br/><br/>Begining of the game<br/><br/>The first player to move will be the one opening the table.

The animal tiles are shuffled and placed next to the board in a face-down stack. Players take turns drawing a tile and then look for the corresponding space on the board. Then they try to reach that space with one of the 5 monkeys. Each of the monkeys carries 1-3 fruits, and this number shows exactly how many spaces that monkey can move. If none of the monkeys can reach that space, the tile is removed from the game. If a monkey succeeds, the tile is placed on the clearing space that shows the fruit which the successful monkey is carrying. Then the player may also place the monkey on the clearing.

When moving on the map, the players may encounter some events which are usually negative.<br/><br/>The gold nuggets are called according to the old gold prospectors slang: Lifeless, Nit, Louse, Bedbug, Nugget, from smallest to biggest.<br/><br/>"}, "23290": {"boardgamedesigner": {"3": {"name": "(Uncredited)"}}, "poll": {}, "name": "Butterfly Bingo", "playingtime": "10", "minplayers": "1", "yearpublished": "2004", "usersrated": "1", "boardgamefamily": {"7591": "Animals: Butterflies"}, "maxplayers": "4", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic336136_t.jpg", "average": "4", "statistics": {}, "boardgamepublisher": {"5176": {"name": "CB Publishing"}}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic336136.jpg", "maxplaytime": "10", "boardgamecategory": {"1089": {"name": "Animals"}}, "age": "5", "minplaytime": "10", "description": "A butterfly-themed variation of the classic Bingo game.

The board shows a carrousel with seven spaces in a circle. Placed on this (on five adjacent spaces) are five different-colored horses. The game also contains a deck of cards, each showing three horses in different colors.<br/><br/>At the start of the game, each player is dealt nine cards and lays them out in front of herself. The object is then to make the three horses at the front of the carrousel be in the same order as on one of one's cards. When this happens, you get a point for that card (put it upside-down in a private score pile) and get to draw a new one.<br/><br/>There are a number of legal moves to make, like swapping the places of two horses, placing the last one first and so on.

Originally presented to the SCA (recreational medievalist) as a historic game from the 15th century, further research has found this to be a hoax.   No evidence shows the game to have existed before 1971.<br/><br/>Players each roll one die, with the high roller going first.  The first player places two coins in the two right most columns of his back row, while the losing player places five coins in the remaining columns on his home row.  The first player then rolls both dice and moves any two coins up or down a column the exact number rolled.  When a player gets two or more coins in adjacent columns on the same row (other then either home row) he may choose to take those coins and end his turn or continue rolling.  If he takes the coins, then his opponent fills in the now empty columns with new coins on his home row and starts his turn.  At any point if a player rolls 7, 11 or 12 their turn is over and the dice pass to their opponent.  Also if you roll a pair of numbers that can not be moved (roll a 6 and none of the coins are in a home row) your turn is over.  If at the start of your turn there are adjacent coins on the board, you may take them and pass the dice back.<br/><br/>The game ends when one player is out of money (or is no longer willing to lose more).<br/><br/>The game is most often played with alcohol instead of coins (if it ever was played with coins) -- filling shotglasses with beer or wine and moving those about instead. This can shorten the game, since the &quot;currency&quot; being exchanged is consumed as it is won. It can also balance the game, since the better one plays, the drunker he/she gets from drinking his opponent's brew, self-imposing a handicap. Many SCA-events run Tablero tournaments, in which there is usually a table limit of 2 beers (or 24-oz) set to keep the tournament moving (and the participants capable of competing).<br/><br/>In all versions of the game, house rules are as rampant and as varied as can be, as no &quot;definitive&quot; rule set exists for the game. When playing, make sure to agree to a rule set with your opponent beforehand.<br/><br/>"}, "23314": {"boardgamedesigner": {"3": {"name": "(Uncredited)"}}, "poll": {}, "name": "Slots n' Spots", "playingtime": "30", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": {"2072": "Dice Rolling"}, "yearpublished": "1975", "usersrated": "2", "maxplayers": "2", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic124140_t.jpg", "average": "5", "statistics": {}, "boardgamepublisher": {"789": {"name": "Classic Games"}}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic124140.jpg", "maxplaytime": "30", "boardgamecategory": {"1017": {"name": "Dice"}}, "age": "10", "minplaytime": "30", "description": "According to the game box:<br/>&quot;As everyone knows, a slot machine is a mechanical device that consumes coins at a rapid rate.

A handle with conductive, spring-loaded, plier-like pincher is wired to the base unit.  When the circuit is completed between the play field and the pincers, a loudish explosion sound goes off and a small light goes on.  The top of the rods are slightly flattened and have a piece of tape on the flat sides.<br/><br/>The game consists of rolling a big die marked with the three colors, and then using the pliers to pull out a rod of that color without touching the edge of the play field hole, ala Operation.  The instructions instruct players to grab the rods by the edges (non-taped) of the flattened top, I suppose to ensure a solid contact between the rod and pincher.<br/><br/>It's not that easy.  You have to watch carefully that you're pulling the rods out exactly vertical, and there's little &quot;feel&quot; using the pliers to judge the force you're using.  The circuit is very sensitive and doesn't let you get away with much.

Units on both sides are mainly battalions or equivalent groups of irregulars.<br/><br/>The game system is low-complexity (totaling about 13,000 words) and compares to the one used in last year's Middle East Battles: Suez '56 &amp; El Arish '67.

This game puts you in the driver's seat of the British/Russian alliance or the Ottoman Empire during World War One. Gallipoli, holy war, mutiny, and the Russian Revolution await. Walk in the shoes of men such as Churchill, Lawrence of Arabia, Enver, and Falkenhayn.<br/><br/>The action stretches from India to the Balkans, from the Black Sea to Suez. Can the Germans inspire a Persian uprising or forge an alliance with Afghanistan? Can the Russians capture a warm water port? Can the British guard the oil that fuels the Royal Navy? Can the Turks capture the Suez Canal and spark a revolt in Egypt?<br/><br/>In Pursuit of Glory you will constantly feel that you're on the razor's edge - on the verge of impending doom or of breakthrough and total victory. Your hand of 7 cards presents you with a rich array of strategic and operational opportunities. You must decide whether to use each card for its historic event, command points, or resources. You must then commit your forces to a variety of objectives: the Turkish-Russian frontier in Caucasia, the violation of neutral Persia, oil-rich Mesopotamia, the Suez Canal, the Balkans and its vital railroads. You must judge when it is right to invade Serbia or launch a new naval invasion (perhaps on the inset map representing Gallipoli).<br/><br/>As the British, you must hold on while your Russian allies break through the Turkish lines in Caucasia and you bring your forces to bear through invasion and a gradual build-up of imperial might. As the Turks, your objective is to gain complete victory early, uniting your strength with Germany and crippling the British Empire in Egypt and India or to persevere.<br/><br/>If you are looking for a game that is relevant, dynamic, fun, tense, and a frantic roller coaster of a game, you will enjoy Pursuit of Glory.<br/><br/>Game Features<br/>TIME SCALE    Approx. 1 year per hand of cards<br/>MAP SCALE    Point-to-Point<br/>NUMBER OF PLAYERS    One or Two<br/><br/>COMPONENTS:<br/>Two full color counter sheets<br/>110 full color playing cards<br/>One 22 x 34&quot; full color map<br/>Rule Booklet<br/>Scenario Booklet<br/>Player Aid Cards<br/>Two 6-sided dice<br/><br/>DESIGNER: Brad Stock &amp; Brian Stock<br/>DEVELOPER: Tony Curtis &amp; Neil Randall<br/>MAP, CARD, &amp; COUNTER ART: Mark Simonitch<br/><br/><br/>(BGG description:)<br/><br/>Pursuit of Glory is a stand alone sequel to Paths of Glory, a card-driven strategy game covering the first World War.
