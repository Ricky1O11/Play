To determine where your boat ends up you look at the hex sides facing each other (on your boat and on the adjacent one(s)). You subtract the adjacent boat's hex side number from yours - and if it is positive your boat moves forward that number of spaces, and if negative - the other boat moves forward that number of spaces.

It uses strategy cards and a point-to-point map similar to GMT's award winning For the People and Paths of Glory. Players maneuver and fight over a map stretching from Northern Virginia to Canada. As the leader of French or British forces in North America, you will need to defend your frontier, raid your enemy's frontier, build fortification networks through the harsh wilderness, recruit Indian allies, besiege forts and fortresses, and deal with events occurring in Europe that are above and beyond your control.<br/><br/>Wilderness War includes a deck of strategy cards for conducting campaigns and incorporating the many events and personalities of the war. The French player can recruit up to sixteen different Indian tribes as allies, secure a continental alliance in Europe against Great Britain, sortie his squadron at Louisbourg, force a ministerial crisis in London, and work toward draining support for the war from the provincial assemblies. The British player can recruit Mohawks and Cherokees, plan for and conduct amphibious operations, implement a global strategy via William Pitt, destroy the French fleet at Quiberon Bay, and expel the Acadians.

First published in the mid-'70s it was way ahead of its time. The game works by alternating stock dealing rounds and operating rounds. Stock dealing rounds allow players to buy shares in the available railway companies. Operating rounds allow the presidents of those companies to build track, run trains &amp; generate revenue for shareholders.<br/><br/>This basic system has been much copied and is an integral part of all 18xx games.<br/><br/>The original board covered the southern half of Britain, from the south coast to Darlington. In 1981 a northern board was published covering northern Britain &amp; Scotland.<br/><br/>Where 1829 differs from most others in the 18xx series is the means by which track is laid. Companies each have a token on the board called a Survey Party. Track is laid by moving the company's Survey token and placing a track tile in the area just vacated... if it is still vacant. This mechanism was discarded in the later 18xx titles, and creates much more of a tactical tile-laying game. It also slows down the game, and 1829 is one of the longer 18xx titles. A typical game can take anything from 4 to 10 hours to play.<br/><br/>In 1994 Francis Tresham published 1825, which is largely a modular version of 1829 with simpler rules and a few other enhancements. It plays quite differently from 1829, though, as 1829 was always about competition for routes.<br/><br/>The board gaming hobby has in its history a few landmark games, which redefine a part of board games in general, or even spawn an entire genre. 1829 is just such a landmark.<br/><br/>Expanded By:<br/><br/>    MSK 1 Extension Kit for 1829 (Northern & Southern Boards)<br/>    MSK 2 Extension Kit for 1829 (Southern & Northern boards)<br/>    MSK 3 Extension Kit for 1829 (Northern & Southern Boards)<br/>    MSK 5 Extension Kit for 1829 (Northern & Southern Boards)<br/>    MSK 6 Extension Kit for 1829 (Northern & Southern Boards)<br/>    1829 Conversion Kit<br/>    1829 Northern Board<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>", "minplayers": "3", "boardgameversion": {"31512": "Hartland Trefoil First Edition"}, "average": "7.06304", "name": "1829", "playingtime": "360", "boardgamemechanic": {"2013": "Commodity Speculation"}, "age": "12", "boardgameexpansion": {}, "usersrated": "204", "boardgamesubdomain": {"5497": "Strategy Games"}, "boardgamefamily": {"19": "18xx"}}, "1824": {"boardgamedesigner": {"8083": {"name": "Jeffrey Breslow"}}, "poll": {}, "name": "Trump: The Game", "playingtime": "90", "minplayers": "3", "boardgamemechanic": {"2012": "Auction/Bidding"}, "yearpublished": "1989", "usersrated": "557", "boardgamesubdomain": {"5499": "Family Games"}, "maxplayers": "4", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1175306_t.jpg", "average": "4.47226", "statistics": {}, "boardgamepublisher": {"20": {"name": "Milton Bradley"}}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1175306.jpg", "boardgameversion": {"40858": "First Edition"}, "maxplaytime": "90", "boardgamecategory": {"1021": {"name": "Economic"}}, "age": "12", "minplaytime": "90", "description": "In Trump: the Game players compete in two parts.

This boxed game consists of 16 miniatures, various room and corridor tiles, cardboard doors with stand-ups, and some dungeon dressings represented by die cut cardboard pieces. The aim is to complete the task of each scenario given in the scenario booklet. One player is the Dungeon Master and sets up the rooms and monsters within when the other players reach them; the instructions are very specific about how to place the monsters, traps or items they encounter. Players are cooperative and do not compete against each other. Of course the players won't see the adventure booklet in advance or during the game, only the game master. All the players are knights of different colors (red, blue, green, and yellow). The same four colors are used for the plastic miniatures of: 4 orcs with bows, 4 trolls with clubs, and 4 Dragon Lords with swords.<br/><br/>Between each scenario may the players increase their rank, depending on how many points they have collected during the scenario. They get points depending on which monsters they have killed plus one extra for a successfully done scenario. In the Dungeons are there monsters, traps, magic items and other stuff. Overall, the designers do a decent job of making the scenarios entertaining given a limited amount material in the game. Each turn, a new event card is overturned and strange things take place. This is fun at first but becomes predictable in later games.<br/><br/>The dicing and combat system uses colored dice with different probabilities of scoring a hit - similar to Heroquest's Skulls and shields except that they are just circles on the dice and represent more of a yes/no answer when rolling. The game is slightly more advanced than Heroquest in that players can advance in levels similar to dungeons and dragons. As you increase in levels, you switch color of dice when attacking and defending, thus increasing your chances to score a &quot;yes&quot; or &quot;hit&quot; result on the dice. Otherwise the game is very similar to HeroQuest in general.<br/><br/>Heartbreaker Hobbies produced a couple of lead elf miniatures designed for use with Dragonfire. At the same time, they put out a rare poster/magazine called &quot;Symmetry&quot; #1 that included two new magic items for the game, stats for two elf characters, and a short scenario using all of this with the Dragonfire game. One would assume that consumer response was lacking given that no attention was given to the Dragonfire game in later issues of Symmetry and the game went into obscurity. Still, the game could be used for a couple of night's gaming, especially if introducing children to D&amp;D style gaming or if one wanted to pirate the minis and room pieces to use with other game systems.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "3", "boardgameversion": {"230997": "Casper Finnish edition"}, "average": "5.90345", "name": "Dragonfire", "playingtime": "60", "boardgamemechanic": {"2023": "Co-operative Play"}, "age": "9", "usersrated": "58", "boardgamesubdomain": {"5496": "Thematic Games"}, "boardgamefamily": {"7005": "Animals: Dragons"}}, "1862": {"boardgamedesigner": {"781": {"name": "Marco Silles"}}, "poll": {}, "name": "Avalon", "playingtime": "45", "minplayers": "3", "boardgamemechanic": {"2004": "Set Collection"}, "yearpublished": "1994", "usersrated": "27", "maxplayers": "6", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic223231_t.jpg", "average": "5.12222", "statistics": {}, "boardgamepublisher": {"390": {"name": "Fun Connection"}}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic223231.jpg", "boardgameversion": {"47360": "First Edition"}, "maxplaytime": "45", "boardgamecategory": {"1035": {"name": "Medieval"}}, "age": "8", "minplaytime": "45", "description": "There are separate cards to determine the course of the tournament, according to the number of players.

There are Revolt and Cannon cards.  The remaining cards are Development cards, each rated from 1 to 6.  On your turn, you draw a card and play or discard one.  The deck of a little over a hundred cards is played through and then everyone scores.  Once the deck is exhausted, play continues until everyone's hand is also exhausted.  Once your hand drops below four cards, there are some limitations on card play that come into effect.<br/><br/>When developing a Territory you own, you ideally would play a 1, then a 2, and so on up to a 6.  The developments must be played in increasing numerical sequence, but they need not be consecutive.  At the end of the game, a territory scores the number of development cards on it times its basic multiplier (1&times;, 2&times; or 3&times;) - so an undeveloped territory is worthless.  If you managed to have a sequence of at least four consecutive developments on the territory, you score a sizable bonus.<br/><br/>Revolt cards prevent a territory from being developed or attacked; they also cancel an existing revolt card (there are only 8 of those in the deck).  It is sometimes good strategy to play a revolt on a territory of your own to prevent it from being attacked.<br/><br/>Cannon cards are used to attack other players' territories; you play a cannon face down, and so does the defender.  Both reveal their cards and add a die roll.  The attacker's total must beat the defender's for the attack to succeed.

Besides Babylon 5, there was Hercules, Xena, and Star Trek. The Babylon 5 game was apparently derived from the unpublished Galactic Empires board game, based on the CCG of the same name --Companion Games (Galactic Empires' publisher) became Component Game Systems in the process.<br/><br/>The basic idea is that each player need only buy his part of the game, representing in this case a specific political entity from the Babylon 5 universe. Players sit down at the same table and put their components in common to have a game. Pretty cool.<br/><br/>In the Babylon 5 game, you take control of a certain faction which is trying to gain power in the galaxy. You play the role of an ambassador on board Babylon 5. You explore the vast stretches of space, lead huge fleets into battle, and control the economy of your faction. There are several ways to achieve victory ranging from economic growth to all out militaristic control of the universe. Diplomacy is not to be neglected either, as the more powerful game changes are brought up in Babylon 5 council vote to be decided.<br/><br/>You construct your playing 'board' using hexagonal shaped pieces that come with the game. The various pieces are <br/>different and can represent a multitude of things so that the game is different every time you play. In addition to the board and the ships that move on it, there are cards. Players may buy cards allowing special actions above and beyond the normal game, like an extra move or more EPs. You can create decks for each player as per CCGs, or you can just draw from a common deck after handing out the empire specific cards.<br/><br/>Using your faction's wealth and resources you play the game and explore the map. You search for planets to colonize and possibly conquer. Use your fleets to engage in battles and use characters to assist you in reaching your faction's goals. The choices are yours and will decide if your faction is successful.<br/><br/>The game does a very good job of recreating the B5 universe, with play action matching pretty closely the series' happenings. In terms of mechanics, it is similar to Twilight Imperium and Les Cochons de l'espace.<br/><br/>There are two core sets, although CGS initially intended five (one for each of the show's seasons). They are the 2258 and 2259 Core Sets. The first was published in two formats, the 1997 first printing (Limited Edition; CB5-101) using a smaller, unimpressive box (they were in a hurry to get it to the store shelves by Christmas of that year), whilst the 1998 second printing (CB5-001) came in a beautiful large box (allowing room for the storage of extra sets) labeled as &quot;Babylon 5: The Board Game&quot;. The 2259 Core Set (CB5-102) was only published in the big box format. The core sets include the Earth Alliance, Narn Regime, Centauri Republic and Minbari factions, which were each available separately (although the core sets include some extra cards and stuff beyond the combination of the four individual Starter Kits). There is supposedly enough difference between the 2258 and 2259 core sets to warrant buying both, although I haven't received my 2259 set yet so I can't be sure.<br/><br/>Component Game Systems has now disappeared from the face of the earth, and even their domain name (<a target='_blank' href='http://www.c-g-s.com' rel='nofollow'>www.c-g-s.com</a>) has been recycled by some unrelated outfit.<br/><br/>Part of the Component Game System.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": {"184505": "English edition 1998"}, "average": "5.78061", "name": "Babylon 5 Component Game System: Core Sets", "playingtime": "120", "boardgamemechanic": {"2011": "Modular Board"}, "age": "10", "boardgameexpansion": {}, "usersrated": "196", "boardgamesubdomain": {"4664": "Wargames"}, "boardgamefamily": {"6229": "CTGs (Collectible Token Games)"}}, "1875": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic371158.jpg", "poll": {}, "boardgamedesigner": {"4089": {"name": "Bernd Kienitz"}}, "statistics": {}, "yearpublished": "1972", "maxplayers": "2", "boardgameartist": {"4089": "Bernd Kienitz"}, "boardgamepublisher": {"1192": {"name": "Hallmark Games"}}, "maxplaytime": "20", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic371158_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "20", "boardgamecategory": {"1009": {"name": "Abstract Strategy"}}, "description": "In Isolation, the &quot;Don't Get Stranded&quot; game, the board is a 6x8 grid of removable squares.

The other currently legal factions include the Spider, Mantis, and an unaligned ronin stronghold.<br/><br/>The Rokugan setting has been changed over the years by participation in the storyline tournaments for the L5R CCG.<br/><br/>Legend of the Five Rings is different from other collectible card games due to the concept of Clan loyalty.  The Clans of the game are what you build your deck around, and the communities that have built up around the Crane Clan, Lion Clan, etc are the backbone of the game.  When you say &quot;I'm a Crab player&quot; you instantly find yourself with hundreds and thousands of clan-mates who are there to help you become a better player.

The Dragon Clan ultimately won the first mega-game, and as such earned the privilege of having the next Empress come from their clan.<br/><br/>In 2009, L5R released its first graphic novel, Death at Koten, which also included exclusive story-themed cards for the CCG.<br/><br/>Also in 2009, L5R released The Imperial Gift the first completely free expansion in CCG history.<br/><br/>In 2010 L5R celebrated its 15th Anniversary with many major events, new prizes, more free cards, and a special flashback set that brought back some of the most popular cards in the history of the game. 2010 also saw the largest World Championships event at Gen Con in the past 7 years.<br/><br/>2011 saw the release of War of Honor, an all new tile-based multiplayer format for L5R that comes with 4 pre-constructed decks.<br/><br/>In september 2015, AEG and Fantasy Flight Games announced that FFG had bought the L5R brand from AEG and will relaunch the card game as a LCG (non-collectible), with significant rules changes and a new design. The game is to go on hiatus following the release of Evil Portents, the final expansion from AEG, and will be relaunched at Gencon 2017.

It is also the first historical boardgame published, in two decades, to address galley warfare. As such, GMT's War Galley is almost a complete history for this era of war at sea.<br/><br/>What is best about War Galley is how easy it is to play -- the rules are about half the length of the usual GBoH game -- and that means that most battles can be complete in several hours, at the most.

With Xerxes' army temporarily delayed at Thermopylae, the Greek fleet, based at Artemisium, some 50 miles or so directly east of Thermopylae, took the opportunity to attempt to stop the Persians from extending this Line of Communications. In a battle that appears to have extended over two or three days, the Greeks managed to eke out a slim tactical win. However, when Thermopylae fell, Themistocles' position became untenable, and the Greek fleet retreated to anchorage in the narrow channel of the Bay of Eleusis, west of Athens, at Salamis.<br/><br/>With her naval flanks secured, the Persians rolled into lower Greece, capturing Athens and razing the town. However, to complete his subjugation of Greece, Xerxes had to destroy their fleet. To that end, the Persians sailed to a position south of Salamis.<br/><br/>At Artemisium the Greeks had learned that, while their crews and marines were superior, the huge disparity in numbers could be telling. Unless they could neutralize this Persian strength.<br/><br/>To that end, Themistocles lured the huge Persian fleet to attack the Greeks in the Bay of Eleusis, whose entrances were so restrictive as to negate any numerical superiority.<br/><br/>There were two entrances to the bay. To plug up the western escape hatch, Xerxes dispatched his crack Egyptian squadron. Upon hearing this, Adeimantus and his Corinthians peeled off from the main fleet and sailed to the western mouth to block any Egyptian attempt to gain entrance. This &quot;action&quot; appears to have been a stand off, with both sides &quot;blockading&quot; and not fighting.<br/><br/>At the eastern entrance, the Greeks deployed in three lines, along a narrow front of about 1800 yards, thus negating Persian numerical superiority. The Persians entered the bay in three long lines astern, which they then turned into nine lines abreast.<br/><br/>The result was a boarding battle, and this was where the Greeks shone. Despite having half the manpower per ship of the Persians, their weaponry, armor and land-based tactics were superior to that of the Persians. And that superiority resulted in a smashing Greek victory.<br/><br/>Xerxes retired to Thessaly, to try again the next year. The result was a great Greek victory, on land, at Plataea, followed by the Greek victory that completely cut Persian Lines of Communication, at Mycale.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": {"43823": "English edition"}, "average": "6.98214", "name": "Salamis", "playingtime": "360", "boardgamemechanic": {"2026": "Hex-and-Counter"}, "age": "12", "boardgameexpansion": {}, "usersrated": "56", "boardgamesubdomain": {"4664": "Wargames"}, "expands": {"1894": {"name": "War Galley"}}, "boardgamefamily": {"10640": "Country: Greece"}}, "1896": {"boardgamedesigner": {"3": {"name": "(Uncredited)"}}, "poll": {}, "name": "The American Dream Game", "playingtime": "60", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": {"2012": "Auction/Bidding"}, "yearpublished": "1979", "usersrated": "49", "boardgamefamily": {"14835": "Country: USA"}, "maxplayers": "4", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic458771_t.jpg", "average": "6.29031", "statistics": {}, "boardgamepublisher": {"20": {"name": "Milton Bradley"}}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic458771.jpg", "boardgameversion": {"95181": "Milton Bradley Edition 1979"}, "maxplaytime": "60", "boardgamecategory": {"1021": {"name": "Economic"}}, "age": "10", "minplaytime": "60", "description": "The object of this game is to be the first player to collect $1,000,000.<br/><br/>Players move around a board with opportunities to buy/sell stocks, patent inventions and copyright items, purchase insurance, and avoid traps.

I.e. the Marshall (most powerful piece) was a 10, the General was a 9, and so on.  The higher the rank, the higher the number.<br/>When they introduced Stratego in the USA, the numbering was reversed, so the Marshall was a 1, the General 2, and so on.  The 1st rank (most powerful) was 1, the second most powerful was 2, 3rd most powerful was 3....<br/>Then, in 2000s Hasbro re-imagined Stratego in the USA and made a few changes.  They reduced the number of pieces per side (from 40 to 30), added additional powers, and changed the numbering to reflect the European system.<br/>This caused extreme consternation with many faithful American Stratego fans who preferred the 'old way'.  (Actually the second oldest way, but whatever.)  Many of these insist on playing Stratego with the 'Marshall 1 system'.<br/>This wouldn't be a problem, except any and all discussions of Stratego are fraught with misunderstandings by those who are unaware of dual numbering systems!

The ore has to be transported initially by lorries and also later by barges to the coastal warehouse.

For example there are only 5 barges (always one less than the numbers of players) to encourage competition and load sharing.  You can also force other players to pay you for taking their ore to make up a barge load as all barges have to travel fully laden.  Much depends on how long a journey takes.

Fast-playing and silly, Munchkin can reduce any roleplaying group to hysteria.

Each player starts at level 1 and the winner is the first player to reach level 10. Players can acquire familiar D&amp;D style character classes during the game which determine to some extent the cards they can play.<br/><br/>There are two types of cards - treasure and encounters. Each turn the current players 'kicks down the door' - drawing an encounter card from the deck. Usually this will involve battling a monster. Monsters have their own levels and players must try and overcome it using the levels, weapons and powers they have acquired during the game or run away. Other players can chose to help the player or hinder by adding extra monsters to the encounter. Defeating a monster will usually result in drawing treasure cards and acquiring levels.  Being defeated by a monster results in &quot;bad stuff&quot; which usually involves losing levels and treasure.<br/><br/>In May 2010, Steve Jackson Games made the &quot;big announcement.&quot; Many rules and cards were changed. See The Great 2010 Munchkin Changeover for details. Of note to Munchkin fans, the Kneepads of Allure card, which had been removed in the 14th printing, was added back to the game but modified to be less powerful.<br/><br/><br/>Sequels:<br/><br/><br/>    The Good, the Bad, and the Munchkin<br/>    Munchkin Apocalypse<br/>    Munchkin Axe Cop<br/>    Munchkin Bites!<br/>    Munchkin Booty<br/>    Munchkin Conan<br/>    Munchkin Cthulhu<br/>    Munchkin Fu<br/>    Munchkin Impossible<br/>    Munchkin Legends<br/>    Munchkin Pathfinder<br/>    Munchkin Zombies<br/>    Star Munchkin<br/>    Super Munchkin<br/><br/><br/><br/>Related Board Games<br/><br/><br/>    Munchkin Quest<br/><br/><br/><br/>Online play<br/><br/><br/>     Vassal does not support Munchkin anymore.

If you think the price will rise, you buy or go 'long' of the commodity hoping that by the time the contract matures, you can sell them back at a profit.

If your superpower is on one ocean and you try to obtain oil from a country bordering on the other ocean, the Canal becomes of vital strategic importance. The alternative is to connect that country to another on the &quot;correct&quot; side of the board (through the land-locked middle countries, which are also bigger producers) with a series of pipelines.

To reflect a level of organisation, oil is worth more per shipping if a king or politician is in place than a dictator or guerrilla, whose job is more offensive. You spend money to move leader pieces about the board, with the managing pieces costing more than the offensive pieces.

Famous battles can be re-fought and alliances can be made and broken with this compelling game of military and political strategy&quot;<br/><br/>Large playing board in three sections, four sets of army pieces in red, white, blue and light green, comprising 1 General, 9 infantry and 9 cavalry units.  Six sets of 4 town cards of different colors, 4 alliance cards, 2 dice, 6 page rule book, and a 4 page &quot;The Years of Napoleon&quot; historical booklet.<br/><br/>The game reproduces the Napoleonic wars at the strategic level in a very abstract fashion (all players are equal).  It can be won either by the outright defeat of your opponent, or (more likely) by acquiring towns controlling large areas of territory.  The board is an abstract representation of Europe and western Russia and is divided into six areas of roughly equal size representing France, Prussia, Russia, Austria, Italy and Spain.<br/><br/>Each country has four provincial towns, and five of the countries used as starting countries also have a capital city.  Parts of the board, particularly the central area, have areas of impenetrable mountains, forests, and sea which restrict the movement of the troops.<br/><br/>There are introductory and standard rules.  Normally, each player selects a country, but in the two player game each gets two countries except that the France + Prussia combo is not allowed.<br/><br/>The pieces move using the dice, and combat is deterministic.  The throw can be used all on one piece or many pieces.  The full throw does not have to be used.  The pieces are placed in a set format on the country selected, with the General on the capital square and four infanty and four cavalry. The town cards are used to keep track of who controls what.<br/><br/>The pieces move in set ways. The General moves one square in any direction. When it attacks it has a value of one and when defending a value of two. The General must be present to take a town.  Cavalry moves two squares at a time and must move horizontally or vertically but never diagonally.  Infantry moves one square and only diagonally.  Pieces cannot pass through opposing lines unless there is a clear gap of at least one square.<br/><br/>Combat is like movement: one considers which pieces could be moved to the target piece's square and totals up the combat value --if large enough, the opposing piece is removed.  Only one piece can be attacked in a turn.  In the standard game, adjacent pieces also support each other (in a manner reminiscent of Diplomacy), which introduces a fair amount of tactics in on-going battles.<br/><br/>Lost pieces are regenerated in your country's mustering area, forcing you to keep a constant flow of recruits towards the front.  In the standard game, the towns also represent logistical support --lose the town and you lose the corresponding piece.<br/><br/>The odd movement system means you actually have two sets of cavalry and infantry pieces on the board, each set (which we could call &quot;odd&quot; and &quot;even&quot;) being unable to assist the other.<br/><br/>A capital can only be captured after the provincial towns have been captured.  Where more than two players are playing you can agree to ally with another player and exchange alliance cards as reminders.  An ally cannot cross into his ally's territory without his consent.  Alliances can be broken simply by announcing the fact; you can attack your former ally on your next turn only, giving him a turn to re-deploy.<br/><br/>The game is won if the player captures all his opponents capitals or captures 8 towns of any colour but not including the 4 in his own country.  You also win if your opponent's General is left with no troops.<br/><br/>Campaign is basically a pure strategy game.  It you are in a position to attack a piece, you will take it.  However, there is some luck depending on how high a movement throw you have.<br/><br/>from the Waddington ad for the game from 1976:   &quot;This absorbing strategy game captures the tension and the pressures of the famous Napoleonc battles.

Merger, diplomacy and force (Risk-like combat) are your other options.  Each turn you draw a Yin card and a Yang card.  Yin is bad, Yang is good.  Without looking at either card's instructions, you assign them to two of your provinces.  Yang will most likely increase your recruitment (which is normally three population per turn), but could also give you the capability to cross a natural barrier like a mountain range.  Yin will hurt you.  Some cards you end up holding in your hand.<br/><br/>A player may attempt to convince another player to merge with his empire.

It means you have to cope with temperamental players, broken contracts, and unexpected expenses.<br/><br/>Of course, you get to manage your team through a season of hockey games, to see how your planning and conniving pays off!  And who wins the playoffs?  Usually the strongest team --but it's up to you to make it that way.<br/><br/>This game deserves to be better known; the theme is rather under-exploited and Waddingtons' treatment hits just the right tongue-in-cheek note here.  If you liked Avalon Hill's Slapshot, you'll like Face Off.

The squares are sprinkled with numbers, of values increasing near the outer corners. The players have sets of 18 (for the two-player game) clear and smoked plastic of tangram shapes, some of which have a 2 or 3 over a certain square.<br/><br/>Starting in the center, the players lay their pieces so as to score, adjacent to an existing piece. A piece normally scores the numbers it covers; if it has a number of its own and that number falls directly over a scoring square, they are multiplied. You can sacrifice a piece by playing it upside down; it scores half (rounding down) and the opponent isn't allowed to play a piece adjacent to the sacrificed piece on his next turn --this is a neat trick when approaching a high-scoring area. You cannot sacrifice on the first turn. You cannot play outside the arena until you've accumulated at least 75 in score.<br/><br/>Score is kept with the help of tracking pieces on the outside edges of the game board.<br/><br/>The playing tiles come in six different shapes, each with their own name:<br/><br/>The Eye (covers 1 square);<br/>    The Rod (covers 2 squares);<br/>    The Quoin or Corner(covers 3 squares);<br/>    The Snake (covers 4 squares);<br/>    The Door (covers 5 squares);<br/>    The Gun (covers 6 squares).<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": {"258208": "Clem Toys Italian edition"}, "name": "Skirrid", "playingtime": "45", "boardgamemechanic": {"2002": "Tile Placement"}, "average": "5.63649", "usersrated": "114", "boardgamesubdomain": {"4666": "Abstract Games"}, "boardgamefamily": {"24571": "Polyominoes"}}, "2039": {"boardgamedesigner": {"37368": {"name": "Edward Schifman"}}, "poll": {}, "name": "Barrier", "playingtime": "20", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": {"2002": "Tile Placement"}, "yearpublished": "1975", "usersrated": "11", "boardgamesubdomain": {"4666": "Abstract Games"}, "maxplayers": "2", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic878148_t.jpg", "average": "4.59091", "statistics": {}, "boardgamepublisher": {"440": {"name": "Aladdin"}}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic878148.jpg", "boardgameversion": {"69927": "Aladdin First Edition"}, "maxplaytime": "20", "boardgamecategory": {"1009": {"name": "Abstract Strategy"}}, "age": "8", "minplaytime": "20", "description": "Barrier:  The international game of tactical momentum<br/><br/>As in checkers, the object of the game is to eliminate the opponent's playing pieces by jumping them from adjacent squares.
