You simply travel forwards in a white 3D space, leaving a solid, coloured trail behind you. You can turn left, right, up or down. If you turn left, left, then left again, you will see your own trail as you zoom towards it. If you hit it, you suffer damage, and too much damage ends the game. So you must fly over or under the trail.<br/><br/>The space is a wrap-around cube without a visible edge, so if you carry on in one direction, you approach your trail from behind (there's an automatic side-step by default). Plus there are two computer-run trails which make random turns. Gradually the 3D space fills up with denser and denser trails, forcing you to make sudden turns, reacting to fly into empty spaces as long as possible.<br/><br/>As the knot builds, the 3D effect of flying through canyons or tunnels builds and builds. The screen shows the density of the knot (too dense and it resets to the next, faster level). At first, it seems like there is no game, you could fly and keep making simply moves quite safely. But the random trails and your own moves soon build up obstacles, and the challenge ramps up quickly.<br/><br/>The game is mostly unknown in the Spectrum fan base, which is a shame since it was wholly original and very tricky. If it had a start level with an existing knot, maybe players would have got it faster and enjoyed it more.<br/><br/>Programmed by Malcolm Evans.<br/><br/>"}, "77004": {"videogame": {"106748": "Mortal Kombat Arcade Kollection"}, "statistics": {}, "name": "Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3", "videogamemode": {"2422": "Local Multiplayer"}, "videogameversion": {"165691": "iPad edition"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1560297.png", "videogameseries": {"4723": "Mortal Kombat"}, "videogametheme": {"2493": "Martial Arts"}, "videogamefranchise": {"5761": "Mortal Kombat"}, "videogamecharacter": {"35600": "Shao Kahn"}, "usersrated": "36", "average": "6.76389", "videogamegenre": {"2159": "Fighting"}, "videogameplatform": {"4781": "Arcade"}, "vgcharacterversion": {"310719": "Shao Kahn (Ultimate Mortal Kombat III)"}, "poll": {}, "videogamecompilation": {"106748": "Mortal Kombat Arcade Kollection"}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1560297_t.png", "description": "Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3 is a fighting game in the Mortal Kombat series, released in arcades in 1995.

The subsequent remakes to Game Boy and later PS3/360 were based on &quot;Hitler's Resurrection&quot;, and not the original arcade.<br/><br/>In the game, the player has to explore each stage and obtain the necessary equipment to progress. The protagonist is Ladd Spencer, a commando equipped with a bionic arm featuring a grappling gun, allowing the protagonist to pull himself forward or swing from the ceiling. As such, the series is one of few instances of a platform game in which the player cannot jump. To cross gaps or climb ledges, the hero must use his bionic arm.<br/><br/>A portable adaptation of Bionic Commando was released for the Game Boy in 1992. The Game Boy version is based on the NES game, featuring the same gameplay and stages, as well as a similar plot, but changes the present day setting of the NES version into a futuristic one.

Montezuma's Revenge was one of the first platform games: an action game combining treasure hunting, multiple rooms, and puzzle solving.<br/><br/>The player commands a character called Panama Joe (a.k.a. Pedro), moving him from room to room in the labyrinthine underground of the 16th century Aztec temple of emperor Montezuma II, filled with enemies, obstacles, traps, and dangers. The objective is to score points by gathering jewels along the way. Panama Joe must find keys to open doors, collect and use equipment such as torches, swords, amulets, etc. without losing his life. Obstacles are laser gates, conveyor belts, disappearing floors, and fire pits. Movement is achieved by jumping, running, sliding down poles, steps, chains, etc. Enemies are the skulls, snakes, and spiders.

These attacks can be upgraded to more powerful attacks by performing tricks or collecting powerups.

There are several types of friendly and enemy units, each with its own abilities, and the mission objectives vary from defending an area, to reaching a location on the map, to assassinating a key enemy figure.<br/><br/>Myth II has no base construction or unit production elements.

Additionally, the game was an early example of a fully 3-D environment, and terrain and weather effects play a key role in combat.<br/><br/>In addition to a well-written single-player campaign, Myth II featured multiplayer battles using Bungie's Bungie.net hosting service at no extra charge.  Also included was a set of model and terrain creation tools for making custom levels, which led to many user-created works.  These fan-made levels used the engine to showcase battles in a science fiction universe, real-world historical scenarios, and even a plastic world of LEGO bricks.

The players take the role of project managers in a company. At the start of the game each player has a single project in play. Projects begin in a single space on the board, and each turn grow out one space orthogonally in all directions.  On a player's turn only his or her projects grow.<br/><br/>If a project grows into the edge of the board, the game ends in a loss for all players.<br/><br/>To finish projects, players utilize a mix of concept work and production work tokens. Placing a token on the board blocks projects from growing into that space.  If a project cannot grow it counts as finished, and the players score one point. After a project is completed, a replacement is added in a semi-random square.<br/><br/>Concept work tokens are taken from a shared pool of 10, and once placed remain in play indefinitely.<br/><br/>Additionally, each player has 2 production work tokens. These tokens only last for one round.<br/><br/>A player's turn consists of doing one of the following: placing a single concept work token, moving a single concept work token, or placing both production work tokens.<br/><br/>That player then grows his or her projects. If two (or more) projects collide they combine into a single compound project. Compound projects grow on the turns of every player who has a project involved, and their multiple growth points make them much harder to finish. Additionally, compound projects are still only worth a single point.<br/><br/>The players win if they can finish eight projects. However, after every other project is finished, another project is added to the mix. This means that the end game requires managing seven projects simultaneously.<br/><br/>Designed by a team at the Singapore-MIT GAMBIT Game Lab for the MIT Sloan School of Management.<br/><br/>"}, "77086": {"statistics": {}, "name": "Ingenious", "videogamemode": {"2409": "Hotseat"}, "videogameversion": {"133756": "Android edition"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic809996.jpg", "videogametheme": {"2455": "Abstract"}, "videogamegenre": {"2402": "Classic Games"}, "average": "7.26346", "videogamefranchise": {"27676": "Better Description Needed"}, "videogameplatform": {"6063": "Android"}, "usersrated": "78", "poll": {}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic809996_t.jpg", "description": "User Summary:<br/>An iDevice version of Ingenious<br/><br/>"}, "77088": {"statistics": {}, "name": "Keltis", "videogamemode": {"2409": "Hotseat"}, "videogameversion": {"216470": "German Nintendo DS edition"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic815099.jpg", "videogametheme": {"2455": "Abstract"}, "usersrated": "23", "average": "6.98478", "videogamegenre": {"2402": "Classic Games"}, "videogameplatform": {"6826": "iPad"}, "poll": {}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic815099_t.jpg", "description": "User Summary:<br/>An implementation of Keltis<br/><br/>"}, "77089": {"statistics": {}, "name": "EA Playground", "videogamemode": {"2313": "Cooperative"}, "videogameversion": {"197947": "English/European Wii edition"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic952208.png", "videogameseries": {"6299": "EA Sports Active"}, "videogametheme": {"2468": "Children's"}, "usersrated": "7", "average": "5.95714", "videogamegenre": {"2338": "Party"}, "videogameplatform": {"4441": "Wii"}, "poll": {}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic952208_t.png", "description": "From the publisher:<br/>EA Playground features games that are easy to pick-up-and-play by fully capitalizing on the unique control mechanics of both the Wii and the Nintendo DS.

The whole pyramid is supposedly the creation of a 'Dreaming God', an ancient malevolent entity which is stirring in its slumber and will soon destroy the world.  As a member of a special forces team, you have to reach the bottom level of the pyramid and plant a nuclear device before it awakens, but before the game begins you are separated from the other members of your team and lose most of your equipment.<br/><br/>The monsters in the game are handled in standard FPS fashion, with several guns, a limited amount of ammo, and a few special weapons.  Where Pathways differs from the norm is the time limit and adventure-game elements.  You are given 5 real-time days to complete your mission, and time also elapses when your character rests.  Also, you have an inventory for your ammo, as well as items such as potions and special crystals that are found in the pyramid.  These key items have to be used in several areas to progress with the game, and one of them allows you to converse with NPCs (all of whom are dead).  These conversations are carried out in a prompt-response format, and frequently are the only way to get information needed to proceed.<br/><br/>The strict time limit, consumable inventory items, tough puzzles, and ease of missing something in the dark labyrinth all combine to give the game a high difficulty level.  It is advisable to create multiple save slots, since not having a particular item or using too much time could leave your game in an unrecoverable state.<br/><br/>"}, "77101": {"statistics": {}, "name": "CSI: Miami", "videogamemode": {"2149": "Single-Player"}, "videogameversion": {"53231": "UK Windows Edition"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic880166.jpg", "videogameseries": {"6067": "CSI: Crime Scene Investigation"}, "videogametheme": {"2280": "Crime"}, "videogamefranchise": {"11301": "CSI: Crime Scene Investigation"}, "average": "5", "videogamegenre": {"2152": "Adventure"}, "videogameplatform": {"4977": "Windows"}, "usersrated": "1", "poll": {}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic880166_t.jpg", "description": "CSI: Miami is a video game based on the CSI: Miami television series.

Your meager beginnings will influence the paths you must take. Lead your people well and they will take you to infinite heights of greatness. If civilization manages to endure the ages, your name will hang in every whisper of its legacy...<br/><br/>Fantasy Flight Games is excited to announce the upcoming release of Sid Meier&rsquo;s Civilization: The Board Game! Forge an empire to stand the test of time using innovative game mechanics with multiple paths to victory.<br/><br/>Will you lead the greatest army in the world to conquer your foes? Or will you be the first to journey to the stars, becoming the most technologically advanced civilization known to man? The choice is yours.<br/><br/>Designed by Kevin Wilson, Civilization: The Board Game is inspired by the legendary video game series created by Sid Meier. Players are tasked with guiding an entire civilization throughout the ages, taking ownership of your people&rsquo;s technology, economy, culture, and military, as well as all the choices that go along with them. There are four different paths to victory, and each is riddled with opposition.<br/><br/>In Civilization: The Board Game, 2-4 players take on the roles of famous leaders in charge of historical civilizations, each with their own abilities. Players will be able to explore a module game board, build cities and buildings, fight battles, research powerful technology, and attract great people by advancing their culture. No matter what your play style is, there is a civilization for you!<br/><br/>Fans of Sid Meier&rsquo;s classic video game franchise will find familiar footing in Civilization: The Board Game. Staying true to the foundations of its video game predecessor while creating a new and unique way to play, Civilization: The Board Game captures the spirit and grandeur of carving out a magnificent empire from modest beginnings.<br/><br/>Players start off with a single city, one army figure, and one scout, and from these meager origins you must forge through the ages and become the greatest civilization in the world.<br/><br/>Those unfamiliar with the video game series will find Civilization: The Board Game a great way to enter into the world of Civilization. The strategy and tactical decisions involved in Civilization: The Board Game will appeal to strategy gamers and war gamers alike, and the ability to win through culture and technological advancement will give those who only wish to focus on their own empire a chance at victory as well.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": {"251605": "Bulgarian First Edition"}, "average": "7.50265", "name": "Sid Meier's Civilization: The Board Game", "playingtime": "240", "boardgamemechanic": {"2041": "Card Drafting"}, "age": "13", "boardgameexpansion": {}, "usersrated": "11610", "boardgamesubdomain": {"5497": "Strategy Games"}, "boardgamefamily": {"12210": "4X games"}}, "77132": {"statistics": {}, "name": "Dancing Stage Megamix", "videogamemode": {"2422": "Local Multiplayer"}, "videogameversion": {"53282": "German PS2 edition"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic781883.jpg", "videogameseries": {"4820": "Dance Dance Revolution"}, "videogametheme": {"2316": "Music"}, "usersrated": "2", "average": "6.5", "videogamegenre": {"2163": "Rhythm"}, "videogameplatform": {"4434": "PlayStation 2"}, "poll": {}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic781883_t.jpg", "description": "Dancing Stage MegaMiX is the fifth home release in the Dancing Stage series, a European version of the Dance Dance Revolution series of music video games.

The engine it uses was also used in Bible Buffet.<br/>The player controls a young Christian whose town has been infested with demons apparently under the command of Satan himself. His task is to purify and convert the denizens to Christianity. Strewn about the town are the Fruit of the Spirit, taken from Galatians 5:22-23 and represented allegorically by five fruits (pears, pomegranates, apples, grapes and bananas). The player may use these to defeat enemies by hurling the fruits at unbelievers who repent immediately upon contact. In order to free the town of the influences of &quot;ultimate source of evil,&quot; the Christian must collect each of the six pieces of the Armor of God, which are guarded by &quot;bosses&quot; that are particularly resistant to conversion. Along the way, the player may collect other helpful Biblical items such as Samson's Jawbone and Anointing Oil.<br/><br/>Areas of the game include a park, a downtown, an airport, a warehouse district, a hotel district, a shipyard, a residential area (houses), a junkyard (slums), a beach, some woods, and a prison, which sits upon the Demon Stronghold, the final level.<br/>The game was also ported to the PC, and was available on 3 1/2&quot; and 5 1/4&quot; floppy diskettes.<br/><br/>Spiritual Warfare and all Wisdom Tree NES games are playable online through the official website in the Arcade Section via the vNES Java Emulator.<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;<a target='_blank' href='http://www.en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spiritual_Warfare_(video_game),&quot' rel='nofollow'>http://www.en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spiritual_Warfare_(video_ga...</a>; available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "77189": {"statistics": {}, "name": "Growlanser", "videogamemode": {"2149": "Single-Player"}, "videogameversion": {"53360": "\u30b0\u30ed\u30fc\u30e9\u30f3\u30b5\u30fc"}, "average": "0", "videogameseries": {"6847": "Growlanser"}, "videogametheme": {"2278": "Anime"}, "usersrated": "0", "videogamegenre": {"2155": "RPG"}, "videogameplatform": {"4432": "PSP"}, "poll": {}, "description": "is a tactical role-playing game for the PlayStation.

The background music consists of the carol &quot;We Three Kings&quot;.<br/><br/>The game itself is a side-scroller in which the player controls a camel on which one of the Wise Men are riding.

The background music consists of the carol &quot;Go Tell it on the Mountain.&quot;<br/><br/>The game controls and feel are very similar to the Wise Men, but instead of a camel, the player controls a donkey, and the attack is a kick from the donkey. The course spirals up and is completed once the player reaches the top.<br/><br/>Game 3: Jesus and the Temple<br/>This game alludes to the story which Jesus is left behind at the Temple in Jerusalem at the age of 12. The player takes the vantage point of Joseph, who is travelling to Jerusalem to find Jesus. The background music consists of the carol &quot;What Child is This.&quot;<br/><br/>The character is controlled in a side-scrolling manner, though in this game the player has more control over how high and low he can travel.

(&quot;Total Recreational Interactive Production&quot;) mode, players take on the role of an auto-vigilante named Groove Champion (AKA &quot;Swinger&quot;), who with the help of his partner Taurus (AKA &quot;Stampede&quot;) and their mechanic Skeeter are investigating the murder of Groove's sister, Jade (AKA &quot;Vixen&quot;).   The missions entail a variety of different goals, including seek &amp; destroy combat, escort duties, racing, and even point-to-point travel.   The primary enemies encountered are &quot;Creepers&quot; (enemy auto-vigilantes), but some missions also include fixed turrets, police vehicles, helicopters, and even a few military tanks.  At the end of most missions, the player can salvage parts from wrecked vehicles and use them to upgrade their own vehicle with a variety of different weapons.<br/><br/>Other play modes include &quot;Auto Melee&quot;, a simple deathmatch mode against AI-controlled vehicles, and multiplayer.   Online multiplayer games could support up to 8 players at once, and took place on the same maps/levels available for the Auto Melee mode or on countless user-made maps.  Multiplayer games were primarily the deathmatch style, but team play and racing were not uncommon.<br/><br/>Almost all of the vehicles in the game were based on real vehicles from the 1970's (and older), although all of the names were changed for licensing reasons.  For example, the &quot;Picard Piranha&quot; used for the majority of the T.R.I.P. missions was directly based on the Plymouth Barracuda.<br/><br/>"}, "77210": {"videogame": {"98783": "The Lord of the Rings Online: Mines of Moria Complete Edition"}, "statistics": {}, "name": "The Lord of the Rings Online: Shadows of Angmar", "videogamemode": {"2327": "Massively Multiplayer"}, "videogameversion": {"309517": "European Windows edition"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic784407.jpg", "videogameseries": {"28012": "The Lord of the Rings Online"}, "videogametheme": {"2148": "Fantasy"}, "videogamegenre": {"2162": "MMO"}, "usersrated": "82", "videogameexpansion": {"147382": "The Lord of the Rings Online: Helm's Deep"}, "average": "7.60976", "videogamefranchise": {"5271": "Middle Earth"}, "videogameplatform": {"4729": "Macintosh"}, "videogamehonor": {"29242": "2007 Golden Joystick Best PC Game of the Year Winner"}, "poll": {}, "videogamecompilation": {"98783": "The Lord of the Rings Online: Mines of Moria Complete Edition"}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic784407_t.jpg", "description": "The Lord of the Rings Online: Shadows of Angmar (commonly abbreviated to LOTRO, LotRO) is a massively multiplayer online role-playing game (MMORPG) for Microsoft Windows set in a fantasy universe based upon J.

While racing, the player can accelerate, steer, reverse, brake, hop or use weapons and power-ups with the game controller's analog stick and buttons. Four distinct types of crates are scattered throughout the tracks and arenas of Crash Nitro Kart. &quot;Item Crates&quot; are marked with a question mark and usually come in sets of four. The player can obtain a weapon or power-up by driving through an Item Crate and breaking it apart. The player can only carry one weapon or power-up at a time. &quot;Multiplier Crates&quot; are marked with an &quot;X&quot; and are usually found in hard-to-reach spots on the tracks. These special crates contain three of a certain weapon or power-up. &quot;Wumpa Crates&quot; are unmarked and carry &quot;Wumpa Fruit&quot; that strengthens the player's weapons and power-ups if ten of them are obtained. &quot;Activation Crates&quot; are marked with an exclamation point and don't give the player anything when they are driven through; instead, they activate either a trap that can slow down the other racers or a boost pad.<br/>Boosting is an important part of Crash Nitro Kart's gameplay. When the player boosts, their kart will momentarily go slightly faster than its normal top speed. Boosts are achieved by driving over boost pads scattered across the tracks, pumping the gas at the starting line, and holding the gas button at the right time when being reset on the track. Another technique used for boosting is the &quot;power slide&quot;. To execute a power slide, the player holds down one of the shoulder buttons to perform a hop and steer before the kart lands. While sliding, a curved &quot;boost gauge&quot; appears next to the player's kart. When the gauge goes from green to red, the player presses the opposite shoulder button to obtain a boost. The higher the boost gauge goes, the more powerful the boost will be.<br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;Crash Nitro Kart,&quot; available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "77237": {"statistics": {}, "name": "Advanced Civilization", "videogamemode": {"2310": "Network Multiplayer"}, "videogameversion": {"85906": "French DOS edition"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic921168.jpg", "videogametheme": {"2600": "Ancient History"}, "usersrated": "21", "average": "7.22619", "videogamegenre": {"2158": "Strategy"}, "videogameplatform": {"4714": "DOS"}, "poll": {}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic921168_t.jpg", "description": "From the back of the jewel case.<br/><br/>You start at the Dawn of History . . . and lead your society through the mists of time to the age of the civilized state -8000 B.C. to 250 B.C.

The tree is represented by a series of vertically-stacked levels which are explored one at a time with frequent return trips to town in order to rest and resupply.<br/><br/>In classic fashion, players navigate through the forest locales a single &quot;step&quot; at a time, moving and turning in fixed increments. Time passes only when an action is taken, causing movement, encounters, and combat to all be entirely turn-based. While randomly generated enemies cannot be spotted in advance, certain more powerful &quot;FOEs&quot; usually can be seen on the map and avoided if necessary. The game uses a first-person view to present the labyrinth using a combination of relatively simple 3D computer graphics for environments and single-frame 2D sprites for enemies.<br/><br/>Similar to early computer role-playing games that did not support automatic mapping, players of Etrian Odyssey II must maintain their own maps. This is done by using the stylus to manually fashion maps on the DS touchscreen, with whatever level of detail is desired. Periodic warp points allow players to escape the labyrinth in order to save the game, so being able to successfully return to these (with the assistance of an accurate map) can be quite important. When compared to the mapping system in the original Etrian Odyssey, there are now additional symbols which can be used and a setting which toggles whether the map automatically follows the player or not.<br/><br/>Featuring no pre-made characters, the title instead requires players to create their own from twelve different character types, each with at least one special skill or aptitude. While only five characters can be in the party at once, up to thirty can be created and kept in waiting back at the &quot;guild hall&quot;. Characters can be switched in and out when in town, so if a given specialty is needed for a specific obstacle, the party can be tailored appropriately.

The player controls a party of up to four gladiators, condemned to fight in Draj's arena until they die, so naturally the first order of business is escape.

It features an unusual physics model for using the girl's fishing pole as a grappling hook.<br/>---<br/><br/>The game world of Umihara Kawase is constructed from a set of interconnected levels known as fields. Each field connects to one or more fields deeper within the game via doors.<br/><br/>Fields are enclosed areas containing a number of static and moving platforms, ladders, spikes, enemy sea-life and one or more exit doors. The doors are often positioned in hard to reach places and it is the player's goal to plan a safe route to one. Each exit door in a field takes the player to a different field.<br/><br/>One completes the game by finding a safe route through the fields and finding a door to exit the world. Each of the Umihara Kawase games contains multiple routes through the fields and multiple exits.<br/><br/>The Umihara Kawase games have simple controls, she is able to run, jump, climb onto ledges, climb ladders and most importantly throw her fishing line.<br/><br/>Her fishing line when thrown will hook onto nearly all surfaces within the games. When the line is firmly hooked onto a surface or an enemy fish the line is able to take her weight. From here Umihara is able to swing between platforms, lower herself down to other ledges and swing herself up to higher ledges. Due to the flexible nature of her line she can also catapult herself great distances by stretching the line to breaking point. The line can also be used to stun fish and reel them in, once reeled in Umihara will store them in her rucksack and score points in doing so.<br/><br/>While the controls are simple and responsive, an uncompromising physics model means that graceful control of the game's swinging techniques will not come immediately. Out of this, though, comes great scope for advanced techniques through full utilization of the physics. Perfect execution of techniques such as the one- and two-step rocket jump are required both in later fields and for those who intend to improve their field completion times.<br/><br/>The games contain 1ups in the shape of Umihara's pink rucksack but no other collectibles are present.<br/><br/>Umihara Kawase contains a total of 49 fields of which four are exit fields and six are boss fields. The game makes good use of the SFC's colour palette for digitized photographic backgrounds. The rope physics sometimes strain the Super Famicom's CPU, leading to slowdown, but this is rare. The game permits saving speedruns, establishing such play as a principle feature of the series.<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;Umihara Kawase,&quot; available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "77320": {"statistics": {}, "name": "Portal 2", "videogamemode": {"2313": "Cooperative"}, "usersrated": "835", "videogameversion": {"216839": "Australian PlayStation 3 edition"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic976110.jpg", "videogameseries": {"10252": "Portal"}, "videogametheme": {"2264": "Science Fiction"}, "videogamegenre": {"2164": "Platform"}, "videogamecharacter": {"17965": "Atlas"}, "videogameexpansion": {"184957": "Aperture Tag: The Paint Gun Testing Initiative"}, "average": "8.7988", "videogamefranchise": {"27676": "Better Description Needed"}, "videogameplatform": {"5248": "Linux"}, "videogamehonor": {"31517": "2010 Game Critics Best Action/Adventure Game of the Year Winner"}, "poll": {}, "vgcharacterversion": {"161222": "Atlas"}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic976110_t.jpg", "description": "Portal 2 will continue to challenge the player by solving puzzles in test chambers within the Aperture Science Enrichment Center using the portal gun (the Aperture Science Hand-held Portal Device), a device that can create two portals connecting two surfaces across space.

Released in the summer of 2001, the game was first in the genre to include a science-fiction setting, dynamic quests, free trials, and in-game advertising. The most ground breaking feature in Anarchy Online, however, was instancing. During its first month of release, many stability, registration, and billing issues hurt public perception of the game. This troubled launch, often echoed by modern reviewers, contrasts with the generally positive critical reception of the game and its expansions; not least was the Shadowlands expansion in 2003 that earned several Editor's Choice awards.<br/><br/>The game's ongoing story revolves around the fictional desert planet Rubi-Ka, the source of a valuable mineral known as &quot;notum&quot;. Fighting for military and political power on Rubi-Ka are the Omni-Tek corporation (owners of the planet's thousand-year lease), the separatist Clans, terrorist groups, aliens, and ancient civilizations. The narrative was developed to be played out as a series of virtual role-play events over the course of four years, influenced by the actions of those playing the game. Players assume the roles of new colonists to Rubi-Ka, represented by a persistent 3D virtual world. With no specific objective to win the game, they improve their characters' skill and status over time. This free-form progression leads to social networking, cooperation, and conflict with other players.<br/><br/>After eight years, Anarchy Online has become one of the oldest games in its genre still online. Its &quot;Free Play&quot; program, started in 2004, allows new players indefinite access to the original game in return for viewing in-game advertisements.<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;<a target='_blank' href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anarchy_Online,&quot' rel='nofollow'>http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anarchy_Online,&quot</a>; available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "77323": {"rpg": {"3069": "Fantasy Craft"}, "poll": {}, "name": "Monk", "rpgproducer": {"15423": "Steve Hough"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic775052.jpg", "usersrated": "0", "rpgitemversion": {"53579": "PDF Version"}, "average": "0", "statistics": {}, "rpggenre": {"155": "Fantasy (High Fantasy)"}, "rpgcategory": {"2108": "Sourcebook (rules/options to enhance play)"}, "rpgseries": {"3741": "Call to Arms (Fantasy Craft)"}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic775052_t.jpg", "description": "Publisher's description:<br/><br/>&quot;The Call to Arms series brings exciting new classes and other character options to your Fantasy Craft table.

Humanity's last hope lies with a pair of genetically engineered super soldiers who ride an experimental time machine back in time to intercept and defeat the alien invaders at several key points in Earth's past, reversing the course of history and saving humanity in the process. You take on the role of Adam Drake, one of the surviving soldiers.<br/><br/>In Body Harvest you must travel around and explore different parts of the world at different points throughout the 20th and 21st centuries. Each world has its own puzzles, locations and missions. As the player progresses through the game their main goal will be to defeat 'Harvester Waves', the alien race's human consuming ground forces. They must also find and destroy the alien processors (commanders) and shield generators, completely clearing the area of aliens and releasing the local area from the trapping alien shield. The player will automatically lose if too many human lives are lost in each area.<br/><br/>One of the most prominent features of Body Harvest is the use of vehicles, and the player can take control of and drive almost any vehicle they come across, including cars, bikes, ships, aeroplanes and many more. The vehicles have limited fuel and the player will have to choose when to refuel or abandon vehicles that run dry.<br/><br/>Body Harvest also has strong RPG elements, and the player will have to complete side quests and explore inside buildings for key items and information.

It is the second installment in the Fatal Frame series and is considered by some gaming magazines as one of the scariest video games ever created. It was originally released in 2003 for the PlayStation 2, and a &quot;director's cut&quot; version was released for the Xbox in 2004 with better graphics and some additional features.<br/><br/>Fatal Frame II uses gameplay mechanics very similar to its predecessor, with some changes and updates. For most of the game you control Mio Amakura, except for some short scenes where you control her elder twin sister Mayu. Mayu's scenes are unlike the regular game, however, viewed with a gray filter as she moves from one place to the next, giving the player clues as to where to go. In normal gameplay, Mio's health is shown as a bar in the lower right corner, although only during combat and in Finder mode. If her or Mayu's health runs out, the game will end. Life can be replenished using different healing items scattered throughout the game. There is also a special item called Stone Mirror, which restores Mio's life to full once when it runs out, and then breaks; only one can be carried at any time. Mio also has a flashlight, which can be aimed in different directions, although the flashlight will not work in all areas. Mio's only weapon is the Camera Obscura, an antique camera with the ability to take pictures of ghosts and exorcise them. As &quot;ammunition&quot; the camera uses films of different quality. Type-07 film, the weakest type of film, is unlimited, but the other types have to be collected throughout the game; the strongest ones being the rarest. The camera can be equipped with special functions and with special lenses, all of which grant some special ability useful in combat; these have to be found in-game, or are earned as a result of multiple playthroughs. Finally, the camera's Basic Functions and the special lenses can be upgraded using spirit orbs found in the game, and points earned from photographing ghosts. The points earned from each picture depend on the accuracy of the shot and, during combat, the timing and damage caused, as well as stacked shot bonuses (obtained by using lenses and taking special shots). The camera's features also include a filament, which is displayed in the lower right corner. The filament glows red when facing a hostile ghost, and serves as an indicator of both direction and distance; it will also glow blue when there is a non-hostile ghost nearby.<br/><br/>During the game, Mio must explore the entire village area and its central buildings, and needs to find various objects and solve puzzles in order to advance. Throughout the game, Mio will encounter different kinds of ghosts, some of which appear unexpectedly while some appear during cutscenes. In addition to hostile ghosts, there are numerous vanishing and hidden spirits Mio can photograph for points. The vanishing ghosts often talk, giving some information related to the story, or a hint on how to progress. One ghost is a special case: the ghost of the boy locked in the storehouse, Itsuki, will give clues as to what to do and help Mio. The game is divided into chapters, mostly related to certain areas which Mio visits as she chases after her sister. In the seventh chapter, Mio briefly loses both the flashlight and the Camera Obscura, and has to resort to dodging ghosts with no means to fight back. The total number of chapters is nine, with a special tenth chapter available in Hard and Nightmare difficulty settings.<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;Fatal Frame II,&quot; available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "77358": {"statistics": {}, "name": "MapleStory", "videogamemode": {"2327": "Massively Multiplayer"}, "videogameversion": {"55114": "European Version"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3598286.jpg", "videogameseries": {"18748": "MapleStory"}, "videogametheme": {"2337": "Cute Fantasy"}, "videogamefranchise": {"23279": "MapleStory"}, "average": "6.15", "videogamegenre": {"2339": "Action RPG"}, "videogameplatform": {"4977": "Windows"}, "usersrated": "10", "poll": {}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3598286_t.jpg", "description": "MapleStory (Korean: \uba54\uc774\ud50c\uc2a4\ud1a0\ub9ac) is a free-of-charge (with pay-to-play elements), 2D, side-scrolling massively multiplayer online role-playing game developed by the South Korean company Wizet.

The Windows version had few changes from the console version.<br/><br/>The game uses a first person perspective. Condemned: Criminal Origins places an added emphasis on melee combat and puzzle solving, including searching for fingerprints and gathering evidence. It is firmly placed within the horror genre, and more specifically survival horror. The game also implements elements of psychological thriller.<br/><br/>Upon release, Condemned was met with moderate to good reviews by many aggregates and critics. Many reviewers cited poor storyline and progression as the game's biggest fault. As a reprieve, the game's solid controls and fresh approach to the horror genre were praised. This allowed for a sequel, entitled Condemned 2: Bloodshot, which was released on March 11, 2008, for the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3. Other media forms include an internet prequel and a planned film adaptation to expand the Condemned franchise.

After collecting all the gold, the player must travel to the top of the screen to reach the next level. There are 150 levels in the game which progressively challenge players' problem-solving abilities or reaction times.<br/><br/>Levels feature a multi-story, brick platform motif, with ladders and suspended hand-to-hand bars that offer multiple ways to travel throughout. The player can dig holes into floors to temporarily trap guards and may safely walk atop trapped guards. Should a guard be carrying a bar of gold when he falls into a hole it will be left behind, and can be retrieved by the player. Over time, floors dug into will regenerate, filling in these holes. A trapped guard who cannot escape a hole before it fills is consumed, immediately respawning in a random location at the top of the level. Unlike guards, the player's character may not climb up out of a hole, and will be killed if it fills before he can escape by other means. Floors may also contain trapdoors, through which the player and guards will fall, and bedrock, through which the player cannot dig.<br/><br/>Notably, the player can only dig a hole to the sides, and not directly underneath himself. This poses an important strategy: when digging through a wall X blocks high, the player must first dig a gap at least X wide to be able to dig through it, as the number of spaces will shrink with one each layer, and the player needs at least one free adjacent space to be able to dig.<br/><br/>The player starts with five lives; each level completion awards an extra life.

Available computer opponents are an assortment of mostly 18th and 19th century generals: Campbell, MacKenzie, Marmont, Barbacena, D'Erlon, Maransin, Solignac, Sherbrooke, Aubert, Spencer, Taupin, Freire, Vauban, Baird, Bonaparte and Wellington.

Each round, players send their heroes and allies to quest or to fight with enemies that engage them. However, as the heroes and allies exhaust after questing, defending, or attacking, the players' options are typically insufficient to deal with everything at once. Therefore, players need to determine whether it is more urgent to quest and make progress in the scenario while the enemy forces gain power, or to take down enemies while making no progress, not knowing what will come next.<br/><br/>The Lord of the Rings: The Card Game is the base game of a Living Card Game for which new adventure packs are released monthly. The base game contains three scenarios, twelve famous characters from the works of J.R.R. Tolkien (including Aragorn, Legolas, Gimli, Denethor and Eowyn), and four pre-constructed player decks. Players can either use one of these decks or construct their own deck to increase their chances to be succesful in the more challenging scenarios. The monthly adventure packs contain a new scenario, a new hero, and new player cards to be used in their deck. The base game is for 1-2 players, but with an additional base game the scenarios can be played with up to four players.<br/><br/>Although this game is set in Tolkien's Middle Earth, the scenarios do not represent scenes from the books, but rather take place in the seventeen years from Bilbo's 111th birthday until Frodo's departure from the Shire.<br/><br/>The scenarios from saga-expansions do represent scenes from the books.
