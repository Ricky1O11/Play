The first player to collect all of the tail feathers wins.<br/><br/>Setup: There are two sets of large, thick cardboard tiles.  One set of 12 are shaped as octagons, and the other set of 24 are shaped as eggs. Each octagon shows a different chicken-related image, and the same image appears on two of the eggs. The octagons are spread out randomly on the table, face down. The eggs are then arranged randomly, but face up, in a large circle around the octagons, creating a kind of &quot;pathway&quot; of egg tiles that is encircling the &quot;yard&quot; (of octagons). Each player has a single large wooden chicken in their color, and each chicken has slots on its backside into which wooden &quot;tail feathers&quot; may be stuck. Each chicken begins with only one tail feather, in its color. The chickens are then placed randomly on the egg tiles, with an equal number of unoccupied tiles separating each chicken from the next chicken &quot;ahead&quot; of it on the pathway as separate it from the next chicken &quot;behind&quot; it, with the goal that they be well spread out on the pathway.<br/><br/>Gameplay: The game is then played in turns, with players attempting to move their chickens clockwise around the pathway. On a player's turn, she looks at the image on the next egg tile in front of her chicken. The player then turns over one of the 12 face down octagon yard tiles. If the tile turned over shows the same image as the egg tile, the player moves forward one space on to that egg tile, turns the octagon back face down, and then repeats the process with the next egg tile. When the player turns over an octagon with an image that does not match the next egg tile in front of her, her turn ends and her chicken goes no farther. If the next tile in front of a player is occupied by someone else's chicken, then the player looks at the image that is on the egg tile in front of the other chicken, and then attempts to turn over the octagon showing *that* image. If the player succeeds, her chicken &quot;leapfrogs&quot; over the chicken in front of her to land on that egg tile, and in the process steals all tail feathers that the other chicken had - including those it stole from other players in the same manner. When one player has all of the tail feathers, that player wins the game.<br/><br/>In Sum: A creative memory game that ties memory to pawn movement.  The first player to successfully memorize the images on each of the 12 octagon tiles, both from their own turns and from watching other players flip the octagons on their turns, will be able to move their chicken around the yard without stopping, and in doing so will win the game.

It depicted a hypothetical corps-level invasion of North America by a coalition of three invaders: The European Socialist coalition, the South American Union, and the Pan Asiatic League. The game is played on a 35 inch by 42 inch map, with 400 cardboard pieces representing the armed forces in the war. As was typical of wargames of this genre, each piece had numerical combat and movement ratings printed on it. The board is divided up into small hexagons (each of which represented approximately 50,000 square kilometers). On each turn a player can move all of his pieces through a number of hexagon spaces equal to its movement rating. Then pieces in adjacent spaces engage in combat by comparing their combat ratings and rolling dice. The combat ratings and the dice roll are cross-referenced to determine the outcome of the combat. Many spaces on the map also have distinctive terrain features like forests or mountains which affect the ratings of units in those spaces.<br/><br/>Invasion: America is intended as a four player game; one player is the defender and controlls the forces of the United States and Canada (Mexico and Central America were American-occupied territory). The other three players are the three invaders of the coalition. Each turn of the game represents one month and the game lasts for 60 turns. The North American player wins if he still controls a portion of the continent by the game's end. If the North American player loses, whichever of the invading players holds the most territory is the winner. The result is that the invaders cooperated to an extent in attacking the North American player but ultimately were competing against each other.

In graphic detail far superior to any narrative account, you will see for yourself how the outnumbered German panzers defeated the superior armor of the French tanks. Experience personally the French frustrations brought on by radioless AFVs and one man turrets. There are no Panthers or T-34s... here it is the Mk III vs. the Char B, Somua, or Matilda.<br/><br/>And Crescendo of Doom need not end in 1942 with our 32nd scenario, The entire British Order of Battle is presented for the whole of WWII enabling fans of the Western Desert, Italian, or Normandy camnpaigns to design their own scenarios for those periods. Crescendo of Doom is more than just a game. When combined with Squad Leader and Cross of Iron, it provides the ultimate in a tactical gaming system which can be used to portray any company or battalion level action. Be forewarned! Crescendo is not an easy game.

It is packaged in a slipcase box that includes one 60 x 52 cm map, 240 full-color die cut counters, one standard and scenario rules booklet, one historical commentary booklet, and two player aid cards.  Game turns are one year each: after collecting silver and/or receiving it from Rome, you can pay your troops, recruit tribal levies, and perform other administrative functions. After that comes the Operations Phase. During it, each force (one or more Field Armies, Tribal Levies, etc) can perform certain operations, using Operation Points (OP). These actions include combat, diplomacy (you can try to control any area through diplomacy), besiege cities, pillage, recruit mercenaries, or build colonies. At the end of the Operations Phase, forces retire to winter quarters.<br/><br/>The most outstanding features of the game are the Prestige Point Level and the differences between Regular and Irregular warfare.  The Prestige Level (PP) simulates the prestige of the civilized armies (Punic, Romans, Sertorians) among the Iberian tribes, and the tendency of the latter to switch to the side that seems to be winning... Certain results of the CRTs add or decrease the PP level of each side. Then, if your PP level is above 2, you have positive die roll modifiers on the Diplomacy Table. And vice versa if your PP level is 0 or lower.  Leaders play a key role since their modifiers are applied to retreat before combat, diplomacy, all kinds of combat, operations, interception, etc. Leaders are rated for Military and Diplomatic skills (The highest is Sertorius, with +3 +3). Roman leaders (Praetors, one each for Hispania Citerior and Hispania Ulterior) are changed randomly each year when they're elected by the Senate of Rome. If you have quality leaders, your chances of avoid/provoke combat are higher, and vice versa.<br/><br/>The irregular, &quot;hit and run&quot; tactics of the inhabitants of the peninsula characterized the Roman conquest and were the cause why the Romans took 200 years to completely control all of Hispania. All combat units have Regular and Irregular Combat factors. The attacker can always choose which CRT he is going to use. The idea here was to simulate the asymmetrical war fought out between the Roman/Punic invaders and the native peoples. If you can impose your style of fighting, (the other can not avoid combat) then you have the edge over the enemy.<br/><br/>The game is played in scenarios. There are 9, from the Punic reconquest of Iberia (237-221 BCE) to the Cantabria campaigns of Caesar Augustus (24-19 BCE). There are a set of common rules for all the scenarios, plus specific rules for each scenario. There are fast playing scenarios (such as the Roman Civil War, or the Cantabrian wars) that can be played in two-three hours, and other that take 6-10 hour of play (up to 17 turns, such as Cato's campaign of 195 BCE, or the II Lusitanian War).<br/><br/>Each scenario has its own Random Events Table. Some of the Random Events included are: plague, Excellent/Bad Crops, Tribal Rebellions galore, bribing enemy mercenaries, Numidian rebellion (for the II Punic War scenario), Alliance with Mithridates (Sertorius War scenario), and more.<br/><br/>Optional rules include assassination of enemy leaders (you must spend Operations Points and Treasury Points for that), Rivalry between Iberian tribes (The Romans took advantage of this to apply the &quot;divide and conquer&quot; routine), Mountain redoubts (Mons Vidius, Mons Medulius...), or troop upgrade.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": ["First edition"], "average": "6.04268", "name": "Iberos", "playingtime": "360", "boardgamemechanic": ["Action Point Allowance System", "Area Movement", "Variable Player Powers"], "age": "12", "usersrated": "41", "boardgamesubdomain": ["Wargames"], "boardgamefamily": ["Ancient Rome", "Country: Spain"]}, "3635": {"boardgamedesigner": ["(Uncredited)"], "poll": [], "name": "Trivial Pursuit: Country Music", "playingtime": "20", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": ["Roll / Spin and Move"], "yearpublished": "1993", "boardgameexpansion": ["Trivial Pursuit"], "usersrated": "7", "boardgamefamily": ["Music Making & Makers", "Music styles: Country", "Trivial Pursuit"], "maxplayers": "6", "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3196867_t.jpg", "average": "5.14286", "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["Horn Abbot Ltd.", "Parker Brothers"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3196867.jpg", "maxplaytime": "20", "boardgamecategory": ["Card Game", "Expansion for Base-game", "Music", "Party Game", "Trivia"], "age": "12", "minplaytime": "20", "description": "Trivial Pursuit's Country Music edition.

Two or more players plop down their starships on the floor. Everyone plots their moves simultaneously, allocating limited engine energy to some combination of movement, shields and weapons. Moves are executed simultaneously. Weapons have varying arcs of fire, and shield strength is independent on the four sides of the ship, so clever move plotting is critical to victory.<br/><br/>After movement, there is simultaneous combat. Shooting is the unusual element of the mechanics. Each starship has a compass card, with a silhouette in the middle. The player must estimate the exact correct angle to fire at, stretch out a string from the center of their card, and hope that their chosen angle intersects the silhouette of the chosen opponent.<br/><br/>Damage is logged in points against different capabilities of the starship, allowing for the damaged or crippled ships familiar from the Star Trek TV episodes and films.

Each card represents a certain quantity of &quot;tribbles&quot; (1, 10, 1000, or 10,000.) The game play follows a sequential order, with each player needing to play the next higher value of tribble out of his hand than the one played immediately before.  If no such card is held, the player must pass and draw a card from his personal deck. There are also optional effects on each card, some reminiscent of Uno (among them Skip and Reverse), that vary the play sequence, score some special points, or allow a player to discard a card. A round ends when either a player is out of hand cards or all but one of the players are out of cards in their deck. Only the player who goes out scores points for his Tribbles played that round. Five rounds make a game. The player who scores the most tribbles in those five rounds is the winner.<br/><br/>The game provides four pre-constructed decks totaling 112 cards, which are color coded to fit a theme. These cards can be interchanged to create different decks. To make the game even more customizable, &quot;tribbles&quot; cards from the ST:CCG expansion set &quot;The Trouble With Tribbles&quot; are compatible with this game. These cards can increase the highest tribbles card to 100,000, plus add a new special ability (a bonus for collecting a specific set of cards) and different combinations than those included in the boxed set.<br/><br/>Also included in the game are reference cards which list the makeup of each standard deck and explain what the special effects are.

When a row is formed, all single pieces in the involved seasons are removed, and the player's removed pieces are stacked onto the last played piece of his color.  One goal should always be to minimize stack sizes, because when you run out of pieces to play, you have to use up a turn reclaiming a non-critical stack from the board.  The first stack a player forms will of necessity be at least three high, but subsequent stacks can be held to two piece height due to the fact that stacks themselves are eventually used to help form rows, and only single pieces are removed to form new stacks.

It lasted from sunrise to sunset, and ended in a rout of the Viking and Leinster forces. It is estimated that between 7,000 and 10,000 men were killed.

Each map hex equals two miles from side to side. Optional rules permit hidden movement, simulate the loss and regaining of combat effectiveness, and model the effects of fatigue.

As a result, Ker Plunk was a popular favorite among skill-game enthusiasts throughout the 1960s and '70s.<br/><br/>The game consists of a clear plastic tube, 30 thin sticks, and 32 marbles. Play begins with the players inserting the sticks through the tube and then pouring the marbles into the top of the tube. The sticks act as a web that block the marbles at the top of the tube. At this point, the players begin to carefully remove the sticks one by one. The goal is to get the stick out without making any of the marbles sitting on top fall through. If any marbles fall through, the person who made them fall collects them. Once the last marble has fallen, players count their collected marbles, and the player with the fewest marbles wins the game.<br/><br/>Ker Plunk was first published by the Ideal Toy Company in 1967, then later by Mattel and finally by Tyco in 1991.

There are three dice one of which is 20 sided used for determining the odds of individual animals in the race.<br/>One or two eight sided dice are used to roll and determine the number of spaces to move.

At the opposite corner of the board is the entrance to the cave. Every turn each player rolls a D6 to move. Players must move their pawns in a clockwise direction along the edge of the board upon a narrow track. At the left-hand corner is a space marked &ldquo;W&uuml;ste&rdquo; (Desert). Each pawn must stop there. To leave the desert a player must roll an odd number. Upon reaching the far corner players must pause on the corner before opening the mountain.<br/><br/>The heart of the game happens within the cave. The cave is large, dominating the game mat. Up to 40 square cards can be placed face down, one per space, within the cave. This number will be reduced if the optional obstacles and tea light are used. The cards show the same back, depicting a vase. When a pawn ends its move on a vase the active player may inspect it, and claim the treasure shown. In addition, the player rolls a die to see if they break the vase. If not, they replace the treasure card with a blank card showing the same vase on the back. In this way the game board becomes depleted of treasures and filled up with worthless empty vases, or voids where vases were broken.<br/><br/>Complicating the player&rsquo;s lives is the band of 40 thieves. Really it is just the black pawn, but he travels the board seeking to prevent the players from absconding with the treasures. Combat slightly favors the black pawn, encouraging all the players to give him a wide berth.<br/><br/>As players collect more treasures, they become encumbered, and forfeit movement points as their load increases. This allows the black pawn to possibly catch a player&rsquo;s pawn. However, some of the treasure cards are empty backpacks and sacks, allowing a pawn to carry more treasure before becoming encumbered. Further, the black pawn is slow, rolling a special die with a top value of four.<br/><br/>Once a pawn has escaped from the cave, he must continue clockwise upon the track along the edge of the board. At the right-hand corner is a space marked BAGHDAD. Each pawn must stop in Baghdad, and may only leave on the roll of an even number. Should the pawn fail to leave, one of its hard-earned treasures will be lost. Staying in Baghdad is expensive! Eventually the pawn will escape Baghdad, and travel back to the starting corner.<br/><br/>To win the game the player must have more treasures than any other player, and they must also have more treasures than what remains within the cave.<br/><br/>"}, "3786": {"boardgamedesigner": ["Jean du Po\u00ebl"], "average": "6", "statistics": [], "name": "Trapper-Company", "playingtime": "0", "minplayers": "2", "yearpublished": "2001", "usersrated": "1", "maxplayers": "6", "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic11188_t.jpg", "boardgameartist": ["(Uncredited)"], "boardgamepublisher": ["Historien Spiele Galerie (Historien Spielegalerie)"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic11188.jpg", "boardgameversion": ["First Edition"], "maxplaytime": "0", "poll": [], "age": "10", "minplaytime": "0", "description": "Players are fur dealers, who try to trap as many furs as possible and then return to Quebec to sell those furs.

By collecting goods (salt, barley, tea, jade, and gold), you can make offers to monasteries, send out delegations to different regions or bargain to increase your livestock.

Each turn players plan in advance six moves for their caravan, trying to second-guess what other players will do to their best advantage.  Delivering goods allows the player to increase their influence in one of three separate categories - each delivery allows you to advance your position in two of the three categories.  Religious influence is marked by the number and value of your stupas in buildings on the board, political influence is marked by the number of sherpas you have in the regions between the paths on the board, and economical influence is marked by the total number of yaks you have on your delivery disks.<br/><br/>The scoring is unique to the game, in the 4 player game anyway (the player count the game is primarily designed to be played with).  To determine the winner you first score up religious influence, and the player with the least religious influence is eliminated, and their remaining pieces are removed from the board.  Next the player with the least political influence is eliminated.  The remaining two players decide the winner by who has the greatest economic influence.

The board is a hollow box with irregularly shaped wooden spacers between the top and bottom. The game board is shaken during the game setup to randomize the location of the wooden spacers (oil deposits). The playing surface is divided into 60 real estate parcels, each of which has from one to 10 drilling sites. Players bid to lease parcels, and once they acquire one or more leases, they may drill on their leased tracts at a cost of $10,000 per hole.  This cost of drilling is lost if the result is a dry hole, but there is a large payoff for successful wells (&quot;gushers&quot;). Players begin with a stake of $300,000. The game ends when a player accumulates $1 million.<br/><br/>Although the game is largely a contest of luck, there is some strategy. Successful wells tend to be clustered. Thus tracts that are contiguous to parcels on which there are successful wells are more highly valued. Furthermore, because gushers produce revenue for the owner with each turn, successful wells obtained early in the game are considerably more valuable than those obtained near the end.<br/><br/>Play proceeds in turns, and each player upon his turn may designate one or two unleased tracts for bidding or he may choose to drill if he has previously acquired one or more leases and has undrilled sites.  Players may sell or trade leases and drilling sites, and they may form partnerships to acquire leases or share the cost of drilling.<br/><br/>In a typical game setup, approximately 15% to 20% of the drilling sites will be gushers.

There is also a board with tiles. Each tile is marked with number from 1 to 6.<br/><br/>Alias is played in teams, usually in teams of 2, but more people are also allowed.

The hourglass (also included) is set just before the team member starts explaining the word. (Looking at the first card and thinking about how to explain the word before the time is set is allowed.) The Player must get the other team member to say the  word that is written on card  by using sentences to describe the word.  For example, if the word is &quot;Silver Medal&quot;, a player can say &quot;something that a sportsman wins at the Olympic games&quot;. But if other team member says just &quot;Medal&quot;, it isn't correct. Then the first player must further define what the hint might be.

The city is ruled by the dread Caliph and her (yes, she&rsquo;s female) semi-undead followers. Much is going on in the city and the story evolves through the sets.<br/><br/>There are four sets all in all and each set had a &quot;bug&quot; on them to make it easy to identify what set a certain card came from.

This is the Gamewright version.<br/><br/>1996 Mensa Select<br/><br/>Republished 2002 by Amigo as Biberbande:<br/><br/>Biberbande is a card game for Ages 6 and up, the object of which is to improve your initial unknown 4-card hand so that you have a lower sum of cards than the other players. There are 66 cards in the deck, which consists of ranks 0-9 (four of ranks 0-8 and nine 9's) and 3 different types of action cards (9 &quot;Exchange&quot;, 7 &quot;Spy&quot;, and 5 &quot;2 X draw&quot;). Four cards are dealt face down to each player so that no player knows the values of her cards. The four cards are then arranged in a row and each player may briefly look at her outer two cards. A player's turn consists of drawing a card from the top of the draw pile or discard pile. If the player drew from the draw pile, there are several possible actions: If it is a number card, she may replace one of her face down cards with it (placing it face down) or she may simply discard it. If it is an action card, she may carry out the action or ignore the action. If a player draws the top card of the discard pile, she must replace one of her face down cards with it (placed face down). A player may knock at the end of her turn meaning that each other player has one more turn before the round is over. When the round ends, players turn over their cards and add up their values. The player with the lowest total value wins. Generally the game is played with as many rounds as there are players. Player interaction comes in the form of the action cards. The 'Exchange' card allows a player to exchange one of his cards with one of his opponents. The 'Spy' card allows a player to look at one of his own cards. Finally the &quot;2X look&quot; card allows a player to look at the top card of the draw pile, then keep it or throw it away. If she throws it away, she must use the next card in the draw pile.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": ["999 games Dutch Edition", "Amigo / Kadabra Baltic edition", "Amigo international edition", "Copag Brazilian Second Edition", "Czech edition", "Dal Negro, Italian edition", "Dutch/French edition", "French edition", "Gamewright 10th Anniversary Edition", "Gamewright English \"Best Toy Award\" edition", "Gamewright English edition", "Gamewright Multi-lingual edition", "German Edition", "Greek Edition", "Hebrew edition", "Russian tin box edition", "US version"], "average": "6.17234", "name": "Rat-a-Tat Cat", "playingtime": "10", "boardgamemechanic": ["Card Drafting", "Memory", "Set Collection"], "age": "6", "usersrated": "1980", "boardgamesubdomain": ["Children's Games", "Family Games"], "boardgamefamily": ["Animals: Beavers", "Animals: Cats", "Animals: Rats", "Mensa Select"], "boardgamepodcastepisode": ["OBG 003: Critical Reviews and the Modern Board Game"]}, "3838": {"boardgamedesigner": ["Frank Bustamante", "Michael Nickoloff"], "average": "6.33358", "poll": [], "name": "Firestorm", "playingtime": "60", "minplayers": "2", "yearpublished": "2001", "usersrated": "53", "boardgamefamily": ["Admin: Better Description Needed!", "CCGs (Collectible Card Games)"], "maxplayers": "6", "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3041264_t.jpg", "boardgameartist": ["Dennis Calero", "Daerick Gross", "Mike Hernandez", "Aaron Hill", "Jim Pavelec", "Ben Peck", "Mark Pennington", "Stephen Snyder", "Luis Vasquez"], "statistics": [], "boardgamesubdomain": ["Customizable Games"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3041264.jpg", "maxplaytime": "60", "boardgamepublisher": ["Third World Games"], "boardgamecategory": ["Card Game", "Collectible Components", "Science Fiction"], "age": "12", "minplaytime": "60", "description": "A collectible card game (CCG) of galactic conquest and exploration.

One player has nine black playing pieces, the other has nine white playing pieces.

Once all the pieces have been placed, players may slide them, still attempting to make a line of three.  Whenever a player makes a line of three, they remove an opponent's piece of his choice.  When one player has only three pieces left, he is allowed to move any piece from any point on the board to any other point in order to more effectively block the winning opponent and to make a line of three.

With acquisition and tracking ranges measured in tens of thousands of kilometers, to human eyes the people that are trying to kill you are not even a speck.

Precise laster arrays and big particle accelerators, honed by centuries of engineering, can reach out without warning to slit your hull like the belly of a fish, spilling life--oxygen, heat, and fuel--into the hard vacuum.  That's why space combat is a game of cat and mouse.  Keep yourself wrapped in the mantle of space--cold, dark, silent.  Keep your thrust burns to a minimum--they blaze like miniature suns for all to detect.  Rig your passive sensors to greedily absorb data, but remain quiet yourself--give nothing away.  Keep your weapons ready, in case&hellip; There!  A faint trace of mid-wavelength infrared betrays a meneuver drive.  Bring up the ladar dishes while the big passive array builds up a targeting solution.  The moments seem endless while every crewmember shares the same thought: &quot;Have they seen us?&quot; It is the unseen enemy at this moment doing the same thing that you are?

Although  the game superficially resembles Monopoly, instead of becoming the richest player by bankrupting everyone else, the goal is to be the first player to raise enough money to fly &quot;south&quot;, i.e. somewhere in Latin or South America.<br/>This is accomplished by carrying out the usual Mafia activities during the Prohibition Era: bootlegging, racketeering, narcotics smuggling, robbery, bookmaking and Al Capone's favorite.. income tax evasion. Obstacles to achieving your goals include gun battles with other mobsters (players), police chases when robberies go wrong, and stints in the hospital recovering from gunshot wounds, or being sent up the river to the Big House.<br/>To aid you in your quest, you hire cronies to carry out your bidding, and gain influence through &quot;power tokens&quot;. <br/>These can be used to bribe city officials when you end up in court. You can also run for Mayor, which increases your influence even more.<br/>While all of this sounds very serious, the game is actually quite humorous, with everything being done in Tom Wham's inimitable cartoon art style.

Every 3 turns this disk turns and the wind will be coming from a new direction. A ship always moves in a straight line that can be at a diagonal. If it is sailing in the direction of the wind it must move 4 spaces. If in a diagonal with the wind it must move 5 spaces. If perpendicular to the wind movement is 3 spaces. If diagonal against the wind movement is 2 spaces and if against the wind 1 space. The wind rotates in a rigid sequence so you can always plan what your ship will be doing. If a ship runs onto land it is sunk. A ship can stop short of its full movement if it is in a harbor square of which each island has one. On the outer islands this is where a galleon picks up treasures and each may carry up to 3. The board wraps around on itself so if a ship sails off an edge it reappears on the opposite side of the board.<br/><br/>There are 6 dark areas on the seas that can become storms. The start player rolls 2 die at the beginning of his turn and puts a marker on the corresponding areas. Ships cannot enter these and ships that are in these areas cannot move.<br/><br/>Each player also has a frigate. Frigates attempt to pass over another ship, regardless of the type, which will sink it. A sunken ship will always reappear at that player&rsquo;s island at the start of his next turn. Frigates may not dock at harbors so they cannot end their movement short when passing over one. Ships sunk have their treasures returned to the bank.<br/><br/>You play until a player has collected an agreed to amount of treasures. The rules suggest 8 to 20.<br/><br/>The rules take up 3 small pages of which half the page is rules in another language. There are also 4 illustrations in the rules so you end up with about 1 page of rules. Some things are very vague though. How the Disk of Winds is used is not very clear. Here logic can get you through. The islands in the center are not marked as belonging to anyone so I have always had each player put a treasure on one to claim it. We have also played that the islands belong to no one player and you just need to get you treasures to an island.

Two peoples -- historically, ethnically, and culturally homogeneous, but polarized by politics and economics -- hurl men, weapons, and materials into the fray in an attempt to settle their division once and for all.<br/><br/>From Pyongyang in North Korea to Pusan in South Korea, the battle rages. While the front line surges east to west across the peninsula, both sides commit airborne and seaborne Special Forces and Marines as well as their Air Forces to deep penetrations into enemy territory. With skilled infiltration capabilities, and the strategic mobility of armor, airmobile, paratroop, and marine forces, there is no safe haven throughout the length or breadth of Korea.<br/><br/>While the North and South battle for a quick, decisive victory, the world awaits the response of the two military superpowers in the region, the United States of America and the People's Republic of China.

The game starts in December of 1944 with the Ardennes Offensive (a variant allows the German player to skip this and save his strength). As a two-player game, it is interesting in that each player plays both an Allied army (Western Allies or Soviet Union) AND a German army (Western Front or Eastern Front). This forces each player to play offense and defense. The player playing the Western Allies and Eastern Germans has a very challenging task. The Western Germans have good defensive terrain (the Rhine river and Westwall defenses), while the Eastern Germans have weak units, a long front, very poor defensive terrain and they face a large Soviet and Yugoslav army. The only real advantage enjoyed by the East German player is the lack of victory points to be gained in the East, and the slow Soviet replacement rate. The Western Alllied units are very fast moving, but they don't usually get a chance to exploit this until the very end of the game (at best).<br/><br/>The map is the same size as most SPI Quadrigames or folio games and has similar graphics. Cities are rated as 1 or 2 victory points, with Berlin worth 10. A line down the middle of Germany cannot be crossed (in the 2-player game), which makes Berlin the only city which can be captured by the Western Allies or the Soviets (ahistorical, but essential to the game's concept). Units are corps for the Germans and Western Allies and corps, armies, or fronts for the Soviet player. Each unit is rated for attack, defense and movement. Combat is decided by an odds-based combat results table and a die roll. Combat results include various combinations of retreat and elimination (there are no step losses, disruption or anything like this). Eliminated units can be replaced, but very slowly and (for some players) with the weakest available unit coming back first.<br/><br/>The game includes variants for 3- and 4-player versions where the Germans are played by 1 or 2 players, and a &quot;red star/ white star&quot; scenario where the Western Allies and Soviets fight it out with some help from the remnants of the German army.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": ["Command Japan edition", "Decision Games Boxed edition", "Hobby Japan edition", "SPI  \tStrategy & Tactics Edition", "SPI Collector's Edition", "SPI Folio Edition"], "average": "7.07393", "name": "Battle for Germany", "playingtime": "180", "boardgamemechanic": ["Dice Rolling", "Hex-and-Counter", "Simulation"], "age": "12", "usersrated": "455", "boardgamesubdomain": ["Wargames"], "boardgamefamily": ["Country: Germany", "Magazine: Strategy & Tactics", "Napoleon At Waterloo"]}, "3987": {"boardgamedesigner": ["(Uncredited)"], "poll": [], "name": "The VANITPL8 Game", "playingtime": "30", "minplayers": "3", "boardgamemechanic": ["Paper-and-Pencil"], "yearpublished": "2001", "usersrated": "0", "maxplayers": "0", "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic244589_t.jpg", "average": "0", "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["Dirnea Inc"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic244589.jpg", "maxplaytime": "30", "boardgamecategory": ["Humor", "Party Game", "Puzzle", "Word Game"], "age": "0", "minplaytime": "30", "description": "The VANITPL8 Game takes the English language and pushes the phrase&quot;creative license&quot; to the limit.
