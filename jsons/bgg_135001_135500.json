Both of them know many famous people who live in this fantastic land: if only they could convince them to come along to face extraordinary adventures, it would mean a lot of fame to the players themselves.<br/>And fame can go a long way here: the King of Celephais is looking for his successor, and all you need is to prove your worth to follow him on the throne. The player who solves the more Adventures with the most success will win this extraordinary honor, and with that, the game.<br/><br/>During the game, the players will bid on available Friends that can join their company, and they go on randomly assembled Adventures that are made up from 4 different card types. To solve an adventure, a player will need help from his Friends to succeed at various Trials. Despite the randomness, the players have a significant amount of control, and a key to success is to know your limits and to minimize the risks.<br/><br/>Apart from the 200 cards (plus Player Aid and Nightmare track as additional cards), the players are going to need a standard 6 sided die, and about 30 tokens (the game uses only one type of tokens, but possibly you may need quite a lot of that).<br/><br/>"}, "135193": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1785336.jpg", "poll": {}, "boardgamedesigner": {"2702": {"name": "David Schroeder"}}, "statistics": {}, "boardgamecompilation": {"7751": "The 1916 Brusilov Offensive / Gorlice-Tarnow Breakthrough"}, "yearpublished": "2012", "maxplayers": "2", "boardgamepublisher": {"1814": {"name": "SPW (Schroeder Publishing & Wargames)"}}, "maxplaytime": "360", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1785336_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "360", "boardgamecategory": {"1019": {"name": "Wargame"}}, "description": "(from the publisher's website:)<br/><br/>Six different games PLUS Rules to Link the Games PLUS East Front Campaign Game.<br/><br/>Tannenberg: Eagles in the East<br/>The vast majority of the German Army is arrayed against France and Belgium. Only a small force is left to hold off the Russian hordes in the east. German plans are to conduct a fighting withdraw from East Prussia. The Russian invasion causes the German commander to panic. Hindenburg replaces him, and bold plans are formed. The Germans take desperate gambles as they counterattack against two separate Russian Armies. Russian infighting and ineptitude lead to one of the greatest victories in German military history.<br/><br/>Galicia: The Forgotten Cauldron<br/>The main bodies of the Austro-Hungarian and Russian Armies face each other across the fields of southern Poland. Each side moves to attack and drive the other back. The Austro-Hungarian vacillation between different war plans creates confusion, but the fighting spirit of their professional Army produces initial success. Additional Russian armies join the fray and attack the weak Austrian right flank. A see-saw fight ensues, ending with an Austro-Hungarian retreat to the mountain passes protecting their heartland. Both sides now steel themselves for a protracted struggle that could mean the end of either Empire.<br/><br/>Serbia the Defiant<br/>Austria-Hungary invades Serbia as punishment for her role in the assasination of Archduke Ferdinand at Sarajevo. Since most of the Austrian Army must confront the Russians, the forces facing each other in Serbia are rather evenly matched. The Serbian Army, battle hardened by years of fighting in the Balkans, aggressively counters Austrian incursions. The Serbs fight for their national existence in one of the greatest &quot;David vs Goliath&quot; campaigns of modern history.<br/><br/>Gorlice-Tarnow Breakthrough<br/>With the front in France stalemated across no-man's land, the Germans redeploy powerful forces to the east. Their objective is to save Austria-Hungary from Russian pressure. Initial penetrations at the towns of Gorlice and Tarnow soon unravel the Russian defenses. A dramatic pursuit of the Russian Army across Poland ensues.<br/><br/>The 1916 Brusilov Offensive<br/>The brilliant Russian general Brusilov develops tactics to crush the Austro-Hungarian front lines. His bold plans call for wide-front assaults that prevent the concentration of Austrian reserves against any single thrust. The Russians destroy an entire Austro-Hungarian army and create a crisis that the Austrians and their German allies will have extreme difficulty containing. The Russians have the opportunity to win the war on the Eastern Front.<br/><br/>Romania: Transylvanian Gambit<br/>Russian successes bring the Austro-Hungarian Empire to the breaking point. The Romanians seize the moment to grab Transylvania from their once powerful northern neighbor. The Austrians have little left to hold off the Romanian invasion. An ad-hoc formation of Germans and Bulgarians counter-invade Romania from the south. Russia sends reinforcements to their new ally.

The marriage to Wallis was not recommended by Stanley Baldwin, the British Prime Minister; and Edward refused to abdicate. This marriage left the British government, and most of the people, alienated; and hatred for King Edward and Queen Wallis rose. In January 1938, a protest by Dockyard workers in Liverpool was brutally crushed by the army; and violent clashes began across the country; between the Kings troops and those of several other factions. The British Civil War had begun!<br/> Factions: The outbreak of conflict led several groups to attempt to seize the country or their own personal goals. Major factions included:<br/> \u25a0 The Edwardian Army - Led by King Edward VIII <br/>\u25a0 British Union of Fascists - Led by Oswald Mosley, the British Fascisti were aligned with the Edwardian Army<br/> \u25a0 The Georgian Army - Led by Edward's younger brother, George, Duke of Kent. <br/>\u25a0 The Anglican League - A large army led by a group of bishops and archbishops, they were aligned with the Georgian Army<br/> \u25a0 The Red Field Army - Made up of disgruntled workers and Spanish Civil War veterans, they sought to turn Britain into a Socialist state based upon Lenin's Russia.<br/> \u25a0 The Scottish, Welsh and Cornish Independence Movements - Groups in Scotland, Wales and even Cornwall who sought to form their own independent nations, they were supported at various times by The Red Field Army and The Anglican League.<br/> \u25a0 The British Empire Independence Movements - Groups of people accross the Empire fought for autonomy and independence.<br/> \u25a0 Foreign Volunteer Units fighting for the major factions. Examples included the AVAC (American Volunteer Army Corps) formed by Joseph Kennedy and the Hanoverian Legion formed by Hermann G&ouml;ring fighting for the Edwardians; the ANZAC Volunteers and the Imperial Volunteers fighting for the Georgians; and the International Revolutionary Corps formed by Leon Trotsky and the People's Soviet Volunteer Army formed by Vyacheslav Molotov fighting for the Socialists.<br/><br/>From the publisher's website -  <br/>     1938 A Very British Civil War has built a considerable fan base dedicated to researching and gaming this world of an alternative 1930's For the first time we have produced a specific set of rules for the period.

Can you help him escape the lab?<br/><br/>Alongside the traditional platform elements such as jumping on enemies heads, spikes and moving platforms are the gateway guns.  The gateway guns allow you to place two gateways on the walls, floors and ceilings of the lab so that when you pass through one you emerge out of the other.  As progress is made through the game different types of gateway gun are introduced with different effects.  After the basic gun, you acquire a gun that creates two gateways of different sizes, passing through one way shrinks Ed to half his size and the other way makes Ed grow to twice his size.  Then you find a gun where one gateway doesn't just connect to the others location but also its time, allowing Ed to travel back in time and encounter earlier versions of himself.  Finally, the last gun manipulates gravity so passing through allows Ed to walk along walls and on ceilings.<br/><br/>Gateways takes place on a single sprawling map rammed with puzzles and challenges.  As power ups are acquired more and more of the map opens up containing more power ups and secrets.  In addition to the gateway guns Ed will also find a torch letting him light up the darker areas of the map and a mirror which can be used to deflect lasers. A sophisticated help system helps Ed along throughout the game.<br/><br/>Every puzzle has a help point next to it where Ed can use power orbs to find out if the puzzle can be solved using his current power ups and abilities.  If it can be solved and you're still stumped then spending more power orbs will provide you with the solution.<br/><br/>Source: The Publisher Website.<br/><br/>"}, "135213": {"poll": {}, "name": "Stax", "playingtime": "45", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": {"2048": "Pattern Building"}, "yearpublished": "2012", "usersrated": "9", "maxplayers": "4", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1919120_t.jpg", "average": "6.05556", "statistics": {}, "boardgamepublisher": {"405": {"name": "K\u00e4rnan"}}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1919120.jpg", "boardgameversion": {"192169": "K\u00e4rnan First Edition"}, "maxplaytime": "45", "boardgamecategory": {"1032": {"name": "Action / Dexterity"}}, "age": "8", "minplaytime": "45", "description": "Build a tower by balancing different size of blocks in a race to first get a complete line from the bottom to the top.<br/>The dice control where the challenge blocks are placed.<br/><br/>The game is played in seven rounds, each with one more level of height to build.<br/><br/>"}, "135215": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1575914.jpg", "is_expanded_by": {"176057": {"name": "Lords of War: Elves versus Lizardmen 2 \u2013 The Magic and Monsters Expansion"}}, "poll": {}, "boardgamedesigner": {"67220": {"name": "Nick Street"}}, "statistics": {}, "yearpublished": "2012", "maxplayers": "8", "boardgameartist": {"65741": "Steve Cox"}, "boardgamepublisher": {"24619": {"name": "Black Box Games Publishing"}}, "boardgameintegration": {"144988": "Lords of War:  Elves versus Lizardmen"}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1575914_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "30", "boardgamecategory": {"1002": {"name": "Card Game"}}, "boardgamehonor": {"22648": "2013 UK Games Expo Best Strategic Card Game Winner"}, "description": "Lords of War: Orcs versus Dwarves is a dual-deck strategic card game for two-plus players which sees fantasy races engage in dynamic, tactical card battles.<br/><br/>Orcs versus Dwarves was the first Lords of War game to be released, in December 2012, at the Dragonmeet Game Fair in London.

Players divide into two teams. One team selects the category and presses the start button. An audible timer beeps a count-down while the person holding the device tries to get his team to say the word or phrase on the screen. When he or she is successful, he or she hands the device to the next person on the opposite team. The goal of the round is to not be holding the device when the timer goes off -- though those last furtive seconds can get dicey! When the timer goes off, the opposing team gets a point and (based on what version of the game you are playing) may also have a chance to steal the phrase for an extra point. The first team to reach seven points wins!<br/><br/>The primary differences of this game from its progenitor is the implementation of the electronic device, timer, and substantial word lists. The electronic edition has also spawned several spin-offs and sequels.

A shibumi object may appear simple but will reward the viewer with hidden depths as it is explored over time. Shibumi is simplicity hiding complexity.<br/><br/>COMPONENTS<br/><br/>The Shibumi set is not a single game but many games; it is the simplest of game systems. The set includes a square board with 4x4 holes and 48 white, black and red balls (16 each).<br/><br/>Balls may only stack on 2x2 platforms of existing balls. Conversely, if a ball is removed then any others that it supports will drop. Any ball that directly supports two or more on the level above is pinned and cannot be removed. If a ball is not pinned then it&rsquo;s free.<br/><br/>EDITIONS<br/><br/>Published by nestorgames, it is presented in 3 editions:<br/><br/>- Ninja: Small, light, portable. It includes a black and small cotton bag, a blue foam board, 19mm plastic balls in 3 colours (16 each of white, black and red), and a sheet with rules for 7 games.<br/><br/>- Samurai: Big, solid, strong. It includes a big white bag, a laser-cut 8mm thick 'ice' acrylic board and 25mm phenolic resin balls (same material as snooker balls) in 3 colours (16 each of white, black and red), and a sheet with rules for 7 games. Optionaly 3 bowls for the marbles can be purchased.<br/><br/>- Shogun: The executive edition for the big boss. It includes a big laser-cut 8mm thick 'ice' acrylic box with 4x4 holes on its lid, a big white bag, 25mm phenolic resine balls in 3 colours (16 each of white, black and red), and a pendrive with rules for many games. You will be able download future games and computer versions into your pendrive as they become available.<br/><br/>The phenolic balls are absolutely exquisite as they are:<br/><br/>- Light: around 15 grams each.<br/>- Round: each ball is perfectly spherical without blemish; they stack and drop correctly every time.<br/>- Warm: both in temperature and in the nice snooker ball &quot;clack&quot; they make when struck together.<br/>- Tough: they won't chip or crack and seem pretty much indestructible.<br/><br/>They look and feel fantastic. When you pick them up you just want to keep fondling them.<br/><br/>HISTORY<br/><br/>Games and puzzles based on square pyramidal stackings have existed at least since Edouard Lucas' cannon-ball stacking problem of 1875. The most famous 4x4 square pyramidal game is Pylos (published by Gigamic). Shibumi is different due to the third ball colour, drop mechanism, different numbers of players, lack of a board gutter, and the fact that it's a system for playing many games rather than the embodiment of a single game. Some Shibumi games may be playable with a Pylos set but many will not.<br/><br/>Shibumi game system concept by Cameron Browne 2011.<br/><br/>GAMES<br/><br/>This is the official geeeklist of Shibumi games:<br/><br/>Official Shibumi games list<br/><br/>Please feel free to create your own game for this system!<br/><br/>The names of these games all start with &lsquo;SP&rsquo; because they're Square Pyramidal games:<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "1", "boardgameversion": {"192282": "nestorgames Ninja edition"}, "average": "7.95136", "name": "Shibumi", "playingtime": "15", "boardgamemechanic": {"2043": "Area Enclosure"}, "age": "6", "usersrated": "44", "boardgamesubdomain": {"4666": "Abstract Games"}, "boardgamefamily": {"13434": "Shibumi"}}, "135271": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1509383.jpg", "poll": {}, "boardgamedesigner": {"9393": {"name": "N\u00e9stor Romeral Andr\u00e9s"}}, "statistics": {}, "yearpublished": "2012", "maxplayers": "8", "boardgameartist": {"9393": "N\u00e9stor Romeral Andr\u00e9s"}, "boardgamepublisher": {"10094": {"name": "nestorgames"}}, "maxplaytime": "20", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1509383_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "20", "boardgamecategory": {"1009": {"name": "Abstract Strategy"}}, "description": "Tiledeck is a game system created in 2012 by N\u00e9stor Romeral Andr\u00e9s.<br/><br/>Tiledeck is basically an extended regular deck of cards made of black acrylic tiles, and created to last longer that cardstock.

Over the course of five rounds, you'll decide when to keep searching for more treasure and when to snatch any loot you can and run away.<br/><br/>Each player starts with one gold as booty. Each round lasts multiple turns, and at the start of each turn the active player draws a coin from the bag to determine how the current pile of loot would be split should players make a grab for it, e.g., if this fortune coin is gold, a player can take the loot if he's the only one to grab for it. Players then use a coin in their stash to secretly decide whether to grab for loot or stay the course and hope for more treasure in later rounds. After players (potentially) plunder the loot, the active player flips the fortune coin, adding it to the loot if the skull side lands up or placing it aside in the monster pile if the monster appears; when three monsters of the same type have shown up, the round ends and all remaining loot returns to the bag.<br/><br/>If a player holds booty worth 25 or more during the game, he wins immediately. Otherwise the player with the most booty after five rounds wins.<br/><br/>"}, "135280": {"statistics": {}, "name": "Inkluz (Numer 18 - Pa\u017adziernika 2000)", "rpgproducer": {"45081": "Belphegor"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1509284.png", "usersrated": "0", "average": "0", "rpgissue": {"10370": "Inkluz"}, "rpg": {"310": "Call of Cthulhu (2nd - 6th Edition)"}, "rpgissueversion": {"192298": "HTML version"}, "poll": {}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1509284_t.png", "description": "English translation courtesy of Google:<br/><br/><br/>Editorial<br/><br/><br/>     Monologue ... <br/>     Frankenstein Faktoria - Publishing Portal announcement system<br/>     and playing soldiers Deadlands<br/><br/><br/><br/>Conventions<br/><br/><br/>     Imladris - almost a full program of <br/>     Falcon <br/>     Zahcon 2000 - a report from the convention<br/><br/><br/><br/>Call of Cthulhu<br/><br/>Library<br/><br/>     If I'm already hysterical? <br/>     Giant - the mystery of Owl Mountains<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Cthulhopedia<br/><br/>     Book Review - &quot;In the mountains of madness&quot; <br/>     Zak<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Ars Poetica<br/><br/>     David Tee vs. Myths - Part Two<br/>     In brief<br/>     In brief<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Jam Session<br/><br/><br/>     Song of the Night Kids - accompaniment to the system Vampire?<br/>     Music Guide<br/><br/><br/><br/>Know-how<br/><br/><br/>     There is nothing like a decent and healthy discussion of theoretical <br/>     Follies, Part II <br/>     , Part III Follies <br/>     Follies Part IV<br/><br/><br/><br/>Movie<br/><br/>Reviews<br/><br/>     Princess Mononoke (Mononoke Hime)<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Cyberpunk 2020<br/><br/>Information noise<br/><br/>     Savages - Scenario<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>World of Darkness<br/><br/>Make it before dawn<br/><br/>     Eternal lovers - Love you to death <br/>     one of the swans<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Caern<br/><br/>     The chase part. 1 <br/>     End?<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Mummy<br/><br/>     In the kingdom of Horus (editorial No. 8) <br/>     History of Ancient Egypt in the World of Darkness - Part Six: New Kingdom - Dynasty XIX and XX <br/>     Great Encyclopedia of Ancient Cultures - Egypt - Review <br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Foundation (Mage)<br/><br/>     Garden<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Shades of Darkness<br/><br/>     Shades of Darkness (editorial No. 4) <br/>     Welcome to the new, wonderful world of Darkness <br/>     Fruwak - NPC <br/>     Don Lorenzo Diaz de Herrera y Perena, Earl Taranc&oacute;n - a comprehensive description of the NPC <br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Fantasy<br/><br/>Earthdawn<br/><br/>     Brothers - Scenario<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Warhammer Fantasy Role Play<br/><br/>     Inn &quot;Under crying ogre&quot; # 1 - in the middle of links to 6 articles<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Stories of readers<br/><br/><br/>     Zaniem&oacute;wienie<br/><br/><br/>"}, "135281": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1344580.jpg", "boardgameimplementation": {"232": "Serenissima (first edition)"}, "poll": {}, "boardgamedesigner": {"79": {"name": "Dominique Ehrhard"}}, "statistics": {}, "yearpublished": "2012", "maxplayers": "4", "boardgameartist": {"12886": "Arnaud Demaegd"}, "boardgamepublisher": {"157": {"name": "Asmodee"}}, "maxplaytime": "90", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1344580_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "90", "boardgamecategory": {"1021": {"name": "Economic"}}, "description": "Serenissima is the new Ystari edition of the 1996 game (M&eacute;diterran&eacute;e in France). The rules have been updated and the game is more fluid.<br/><br/>In Serenissima players represent a merchant family during the Renaissance. Players attempt to balance the need of trading and open commerce versus the cut-throat economic piracy of the day. Players create a fleet of ships to purchase and move various commodities around the Mediterranean while also keeping well manned ships to attack and defend against other player's fleets.<br/><br/><br/><br/>(block of information submitted by user in comments not included in game entry)<br/>Board<br/>The maritime areas are bigger and there are fewer of them. Starting ports are different too: Alexandria is one of them in the new version.Resources and Trade<br/>One of the resources has changed (marble replaces gems) and the ports produce different resources compared to the 1996 version. In the 1996 version, when buying goods from a port owned by another player, you had to bargain. It could be hard. Now, you just pay them 1 ducat, instead of paying the bank.<br/>Wine is now special: one port with wine in its warehouse is worth more VP at the end of the game.<br/><br/>Game Flow (big point)<br/>In the 1996 version, all the players used to bid for turn order. Then, they all played the phases according to this order: they loaded, built and bought, then they all moved their galleys, they fought and finally they took over free ports and made money.<br/>There's no bidding anymore. Now, the galleys you build are numbered, and when it's the turn of one specific galley, its owner can perform their actions (load, move and fight, or build), before the next galley is the active one. If your galleys have successive numbers, you can play several times.<br/>The little flags that used to be awkwardly fixed on the galleys are now useless, and the men have to be in the player's colour (instead of being a nice bunch of nice Sailor Smurfs).<br/>This is a major difference, the game is radically altered.<br/><br/>Counts and Victory Points<br/>There are several counts in the game, and not only one at the end of the game. What's more: another kind of count can bring players money if they have wine in their warehouse. All of that depends on the drawn cards at the end of a galleys' turn. The pace of the game may be altered by those cards, too.<br/>There is no card in the 1996 version.<br/>In this old version, the only way to have your port well valued at the end of the game was to have its warehouses full. It's now different too: a port with one good is better than one with none, but worse than one with two, etc.<br/><br/>Other Changes<br/>There's a building more: basilic. It brings more VP.<br/>Galleys are easier to build but the price is not the same.<br/>Combat rules are very different, the fort has a different power. Dice are different too.<br/>Port limits to recruit sailors are different.<br/>2 and 3 players rules are different.<br/>...and this list is all but exhaustive.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": {"209080": "English edition"}, "average": "7.03345", "name": "Serenissima (second edition)", "playingtime": "90", "boardgamemechanic": {"2080": "Area Control / Area Influence"}, "age": "13", "usersrated": "670", "boardgamesubdomain": {"5497": "Strategy Games"}, "boardgamefamily": {"18639": "Cities: Barcelona (Spain)"}}, "135282": {"statistics": {}, "name": "Inkluz (Numer 19 - Listopada 2000)", "rpgproducer": {"65776": "Jacek Andrzejczak"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1509283.png", "usersrated": "0", "average": "0", "rpgissue": {"10370": "Inkluz"}, "rpg": {"310": "Call of Cthulhu (2nd - 6th Edition)"}, "rpgissueversion": {"192300": "HTML version"}, "poll": {}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1509283_t.png", "description": "English translation courtesy of Google:<br/><br/><br/>Editorial<br/><br/><br/>     Allusion<br/><br/><br/><br/>Conventions<br/><br/><br/>     Zahcon 2000 - correction - Belphegor The Archdevil <br/>     Corrigendum to the relationship with Zahconu - Witold Siekierzy\u0144ski &quot;SHAMAN&quot; <br/><br/><br/><br/>Stories<br/><br/><br/>     Gibberish prophet - editorial <br/>     Four - by Nicolai Kafta <br/>     truth about Little Lily <br/>     colors of silence<br/><br/><br/><br/>Literature<br/><br/>Tolkien's Corner<br/><br/>     Fireworks at Amon Sul - Nine Nazgul vs. Gandalf the Grey<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Jam Session<br/><br/><br/>     Wolf howl - a few screams in time for Werewolf: the Apocalypse<br/>     Memento Mori - what's up after the death of <br/>     Profane: Eminence of Satanic Imperial Act - Review of CD<br/><br/><br/><br/>Know-how<br/><br/><br/>     Role<br/><br/><br/><br/>Columns<br/><br/><br/>     So Ideaversum Hunt For Inspiration<br/><br/><br/><br/>Movie<br/><br/>Reviews<br/><br/>     Scream 3 - Lesson dressing<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Call of Cthulhu<br/><br/><br/>     Introduction <br/>     Those who withdraw a ton - an interview with Jerzy Cichocki and Joe abracadabra<br/><br/><br/>Library<br/><br/>     Japan in the twenties <br/>     Where ruled Mi-Go - The origins of Himalayan mountaineering in the 20s<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Cthulhopedia<br/><br/>     Japan and the Myths of Cthulhu <br/>     climb Mount Everest because it's there<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Ars Poetica<br/><br/>     David Tee vs. Myths - Part III<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>In brief<br/><br/>     False start - the second approach <br/>     September <br/>     October<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Cyberpunk 2020<br/><br/>Patch edge<br/><br/>     The idea for the style (over substance) <br/>     after ankle <br/>     Colt-Mauser cannon M2x &quot;Extreme Rarity&quot;<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Information noise<br/><br/>     Homeless - story<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Fantasy<br/><br/>Earthdawn<br/><br/>     Children sleep - a scenario for advanced team<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Warhammer Fantasy Role Play<br/><br/>     Inn &quot;Under crying ogre&quot; # 1<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>World of Darkness<br/><br/>In bezdni Maelstrom<br/><br/>     Editorial - welcome to bezdni Maelstrom <br/>     Augurowie Purple - a sect of <br/>     one who walked ...<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Make it before dawn<br/><br/>     Violent mood swings LARP <br/>     props - sharp objects <br/>     Warsaw 1942 - Berlin in der Nacht - prologue to the saga V: tM happening in Berlin<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Caern<br/><br/>     Criticism is not constructive to the end<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Foundation<br/><br/>     What is it that makes us tick?<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Shades of Darkness<br/><br/>     Shades of Darkness (editorial No. 5) <br/>     Brujah <br/>     Gangrel <br/>     Malkavian<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Warhammer Fantasy Battle<br/><br/><br/>     Editorial (6 AE) <br/>     is not so scary ... diabou <br/>     those who for the first time ...<br/><br/><br/>The hammer and the anvil<br/><br/>     River among fields<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>To let<br/><br/>     Lothar Kranson, Dwarf Engineer<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>"}, "135283": {"statistics": {}, "name": "Evochron Mercenary", "videogamemode": {"2313": "Cooperative"}, "videogameversion": {"192301": "Windows Downloadable edition"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2094978.jpg", "videogametheme": {"2514": "Flight"}, "usersrated": "2", "average": "6.15", "videogamegenre": {"2147": "Action"}, "videogameplatform": {"4977": "Windows"}, "poll": {}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2094978_t.jpg", "description": "Trading commodities while sneaking past hostile forces, racing the best pilots in the area, mining for diamonds, negotiating for survival, spying for a curious energy company, cleaning dirty solar arrays, transporting an impatient passenger... and that's just on a Monday.

The upgrades, ships, equipment, money, and commodities you earn in the game can be used in both the single player and multiplayer modes. You don't have to give up your progress in the game when switching between single player and multiplayer, nor do you have to give up what you earn when you join different multiplayer sessions.<br/><br/>Also, everything you do in the game takes place in a seamless universe without system 'walls', there are no required warp gates or trade lanes to restrict your travel and hold you back. You can travel anywhere you want, with or without jump drives and gates, as long as you have the fuel and time to get there. You can descend into planet atmospheres (without loading screens or sudden environment flipping) to land at city trade stations or explore for hidden items. You can escape to nebula clouds for sensor cover or hide in a massive asteroid cave for protection. If you're low on fuel and don't have money, but you have a tractor beam and fuel converter, then retrieve photon particles from nearby stars and emissive nebulae which can be processed into fuel.<br/><br/>Design your ship for the role you want to play and customize the appearance by adjusting the position/scaling of the various parts of your ship. Whether it's combat, exploration, mining, trading, racing, or a variety of other activities, you'll find many ways to play and advance in the game.

This included a coalition of Russia, Prussia and Austria committed to defeat France and its allies, forging a domination of Europe that would lead to the Nationalism of Germany. While historians have drawn a myriad of contrary opinions about who were the good guys and bad guys, the battle encircles the city of Leipzig with 500,000 man armies facing each other.<br/><br/>The sheer size of this conflict can truly test a designer&rsquo;s skill when representing it at a battalion level. However, Leipzig is actually a series of smaller battles fought west, east, south and north of Leipzig as the Coalition armies concentrically move toward the City. La Bataille de Lindenau 1813 is the battle southwest of Leipzig.<br/><br/>La Bataille de Lindenau recreates the furious battle between the Hungarian Ignaz Gyulai,and his  IIIrd Austrian Corps, and their attempt to wrest the crucial town of Lindenau from General Bertrand's multinational IV Corps, as it defended the French lines of communication on October 16, 1813 just outside Leipzig.  The battle places Bertrand on the horns of a dilemma. On the one hand, Lindenau must stay in French hands if Napoleon has any hope of defeating the Coalition.  However, Bertrand also has an imperative to send as much of his able corps as possible to assist Napoleon on the Leipzig southern front. Gyulai's task is to disrupt both French goals.<br/><br/>The player will note immediately the differences in the different formations and how each must be managed to achieve success.<br/><br/>Each 20 minute turn starts with a Command Phase for both sides followed by the French Player sequence and then by the Prussian Player sequence. The sequence includes movement, cavalry charges, fire and melee. During each, morale plays a decisive role. This is a great one player on one player game but will also accommodate two players on a side also.<br/><br/>The original rules have been updated but not expanded to any extent. The original designers of the La Bataille Series believe the Premier Rules facilitate / expedite the most accurate and competitive play. The new Premier Rules are an update of the original rules but make it easier to find specific topics and includes some user requested rules such as command control.<br/><br/>The special rules also feature an essay on Count Bertrand, Napoleon's close confident who is buried next to the Emperor at Les Invalides in Paris, and who was so crucial to the French efforts in the 1813 campaign.  The French must also wrestle with using German &quot;allies&quot;,  who have become unreliable at this stage of the campaign, and figure out how to keep Germans engaged in a favorable way to enhance French strategic efforts.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": {"192377": "First edition"}, "average": "7.5", "name": "La Bataille de Lindenau 1813", "playingtime": "420", "boardgamemechanic": {"2026": "Hex-and-Counter"}, "age": "15", "usersrated": "5", "boardgamefamily": {"109": "La Bataille series"}}, "135322": {"statistics": {}, "name": "Bass Tour", "videogamemode": {"2149": "Single-Player"}, "videogameversion": {"192551": "North American DOS (CGA) edition"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1511606.jpg", "videogametheme": {"2364": "Fishing"}, "usersrated": "2", "average": "5", "videogamegenre": {"2157": "Sports"}, "videogameplatform": {"4714": "DOS"}, "poll": {}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1511606_t.jpg", "description": "User Summary<br/><br/>Bass Tour is a very detailed fishing simulator for DOS.

The rule system is card based and focuses heavily on freeform and improvisation. Please also see the reviews section.<br/><br/>Setting<br/>Itras by labels itself a &ldquo;surreal role playing game&rdquo;. It&rsquo;s also been called a retro-surreal urban fable.<br/><br/>The setting is a city, reminiscent of Western cities in the 20&rsquo;s and 30&rsquo;s. In the city center, reality is relatively stable, but the further afield you get, the more it deteriorates, mutates, becomes dream-like. In the setting chapter you&rsquo;ll find descriptions of dreams which have become real, mad scientists, an outline of a city strictly divided by class, sea elephants, the Machine God who lurks under the city, a gentleman with a monster in his basement, a description of the structural cancer that haunts some of the city&rsquo;s buildings and much more.<br/><br/>We heartily encourage each group to make Itras by their own by changing, adapting, adding and subtracting.<br/><br/>There are pulpish elements, horror elements, creepy surreal elements, all together in a strange blend we hope will inspire.<br/><br/>System<br/>The system is very simple and described in a few pages. The game pioneered the use of Matthiijs Holter&rsquo;s resolution cards (also featured in Love in the Time of Seid and the Swedish RPG S&auml;gen), and has it&rsquo;s very own Chance Card system. The resolution cards function as a resolution mechanic, and read things like &ldquo;Yes, but&hellip;&rdquo;, &ldquo;No, and&hellip;&rdquo;, &ldquo;Yes, and&hellip;&rdquo; etc. The results are interpreted by players after the cards have been drawn.<br/><br/>The Chance Cards can be drawn once per session by each player, and serve to infuse the game with surrealism. Some examples:<br/><br/>Cut Scene: Jump forward three hours. Describe what conditions the characters find themselves in. You&rsquo;re not allowed to describe what has happened in the meantime.<br/><br/>Nemesis! This card awakens the character&rsquo;s Nemesis. In some way, this arch enemy affects the situation. Exactly how is up to you. Doesn&rsquo;t the character have an arch enemy? Well, now she does.<br/><br/>What&rsquo;s in its pockets? The character has something in her pocket which might be useful. What could it be?<br/><br/>These cards are interpreted by the player who draws them.<br/><br/>The book is chock full of advice on how to roleplay, be a gamemaster, plan a campaign, make an adventure, play with surrealism and more. I think it&rsquo;s as good as a beginner&rsquo;s game as for more experienced players<br/><br/>", "usersrated": "2", "average": "7.75", "rpgissuearticle": {"131644": "Itras By"}, "rpg": {"2503": "Itras By"}, "statistics": {}, "rpgcategory": {"2083": "Core Rules (min needed to play)"}, "rpggenre": {"182": "Weird / Surreal"}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1510646_t.jpg", "rpgpodcastepisode": {"195109": "26.

First, instead of having only a single island in the game on which players build and compete for resources, three islands are present &ndash; but the landscape of only one of these islands is known at the start of the game. Players start on this island, then build ships and bring settlers into play so that they can then travel to new lands. When a ship ends its movement on unexplored territory, that hex is revealed and a randomly-drawn number chip placed on it, with the player earning one resource as a reward &ndash; assuming the hex produces resources, that is. (The number of unknown tiles varies from 16 to 32, depending on the scenario.) A settler and ship can be transformed into a port settlement, from which roads and new ships can be built to enable further exploration.<br/><br/>Second, instead of using cities, Catan: Explorers &amp; Pirates allows players to build port settlements for two corn and two ore, with a port settlement supplying one resource when the adjacent number is rolled at the start of a turn. Like cities, port settlements are worth two victory points (VPs), and the number of VPs required to win depends on the scenario.<br/><br/>Third, if a player receives no resources during the production roll (other than on a roll of 7), she receives one gold in compensation. Two gold can be traded with the bank for a resource of the player's choice. Gold has other uses as well, such as helping you escape from pirates.<br/><br/>The five scenarios included in Catan: Explorers &amp; Pirates are:<br/><br/>&bull; Land Ho! Explore the seas of Catan and discover two new islands to expand your settlements. Once you've discovered an island, you must use ships to ferry settlers from one island to another and colonize distant lands. (Introductory scenario)<br/><br/>&bull; Pirate Lairs! In this scenario, pirates prowl the seas along with your trading vessels. Pay tribute to the pirates or drive them off, then find and capture their lairs to earn gold and VPs! (One mission scenario)<br/><br/>&bull; Fish for Catan! The people of Catan are short of food, so it's time to take to the ocean to fish for meals. These are deep water fish, though, so first you must find their shoals before you can catch them! The Council of Catan will reward players with VPs for returning fish to the island, as well as for capturing pirate lairs. Just watch out for roaming pirates, as not only will they demand gold for tribute, they might also get to the fish before you do! (Two mission scenario)<br/><br/>&bull; Spices for Catan! In this scenario, the Council of Catan wants you to find fish and spices for the people of Catan! As before, they reward the most industrious merchant captains with VPs. Obtaining spice will require you to become friends with the mysterious inhabitants of the Spice Islands, but in return they will not only trade you spices but teach you their knowledge of sailing or even pirate fighting techniques! (Two mission scenario)<br/><br/>&bull; Explorers and Pirates! This lengthy and challenging scenario brings everything from the previous scenarios together! Explore new lands, capture pirate lairs, find fish, and befriend the inhabitants of the spice isles!

Using this newfound power, they gained the ability to control and reshape everything around them. On earth lies the only way to reach Thuria, the place where this power lies. Several alien, or former human, races have come to earth to reach this place and claim the Divine Power for themselves.<br/><br/>The Ascendance - Call of Thuria board game is designed for 2-4 players of ages 12 and above. It is played with decks of cards which the players customize for themselves through the extra cards available on the game box, or future expansions. Players deploy Units, Structures and play cards from their hands, reserving Divine Abilities for when things get tough. The Game Board is used to play Events which harass or assist the players and also to help players choose Advantages, special situations that may turn the tide of battle.<br/><br/>The game is won via one of two ways. You can either destroy your opponent's Fortress by reducing its Hit Points to 0, or gather enough Divine Power to use your Ultimatum and completely annihilate your opponent.<br/><br/>GAMEPLAY<br/>Once players have chosen the cards to use in their Decks, they must choose 5 Divine Abilities for the current match and then the game can begin. The game is separated into Phases, with each player completing their own Phase separately, unless another player intervenes. Players use Production Credits (usually called just Credits) to deploy Armies, play Commands from their hand and any other costs necessary. These Credits can be acquired by the Fortress, or other Structures. Players may also purchase Enhancements on their Structures or Units to make them better or change their use. Divine Power Points are also acquired every turn and the players use them to perform their Divine Abilities, powerful cards that may, if played at the right moment, judge the outcome of a battle.<br/><br/>Each turn, the chaotic landscape of Thuria or the monstrous Zordath pose a threat to the players. Events are drawn every turn and usually harass the players by forcing them to attack the Zordath or face a natural hazard.

The aim of the game is to pick a card each turn and win by collecting 3 Dragon cards, 1 Exit card and 1 Treasure card.<br/><br/>Dragon cards can be collected by using a previously picked Force card against it, with the Force card then being discarded. If the player has no Force card then instead he can roll the dice; a star result means he has defeated the dragon and can keep the Dragon card, a result of 4 means a stalemate and he must discard the Dragon card but a result of 1 to 3 means he has been defeated and must reshuffle his entire deck (current deck, discarded cards and kept cards) and start again. Alternatively, the player can decide to not roll a dice, discard the Dragon card and in future he picks from a different deck; whether occupied by another player or not.<br/><br/>Picking a Dungeon card means that the player must miss a go and discard this card. Picking a Bifurcation card means that the player must pick from another deck for the next turn only and discard this card. Adventure cards do nothing and are discarded.

Whoever called this the Big Easy sure got that one wrong. Things are tough all over. Honest work is hard to find, and even dishonest jobs are getting scarce. The one thing that&rsquo;s not in short supply is trouble. From shady thugs to crooked cops to Mafia soldiers, there&rsquo;s plenty of characters out there looking to give an honest Joe a hard time.<br/><br/>And that&rsquo;s not the worst of it.<br/><br/>There are stories going round about things that go bump in the night. Things you wouldn&rsquo;t want to meet in a dark alley on a darker night. And those stories aren&rsquo;t just coming from rummies or saps who read that Epitaph rag.<br/><br/>Still, there are a few heroes left in the concrete jungle. Steely-eyed private dicks, fast-talking grifters, wild-eyed inventors, and shadowy houngans still struggle against the encroaching darkness. With enough moxie&mdash;and more than a little luck&mdash;they might just be enough to turn the tide.<br/><br/>Deadlands Noir is a pen-and-paper roleplaying game set in the world of Pinnacle Entertainment&rsquo;s award-winning Deadlands universe. It includes new Edges, Hindrances, and powers, as well as new rules for handling detective work, the state of the Union and the CSA in the Depression-era, a complete Plot Point campaign, and of course, more monsters and ghouls than you can shake a smoking .45 automatic at.<br/><br/>Update! Since we started, we've added a number of additional products and rewards, including the Deadlands Noir Companion that adds four new cities with their own dark secrets: Chicago, Lost Angels. Shan Fan, and the City of Gloom!<br/><br/>Deadlands Noir uses the best-selling Savage Worlds rules, and you will need a copy of those to play.<br/><br/>", "usersrated": "11", "rpgsetting": {"23111": "Deadlands Noir"}, "average": "7.95455", "rpggenre": {"169": "Action / Adventure (Pulp)"}, "rpg": {"286": "Savage Worlds"}, "rpgcategory": {"2107": "Campaign Setting (game world)"}, "poll": {}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1512847_t.png", "rpgpodcastepisode": {"134214": "15. 8 Nights of Murder!

The game will be free to download from Capcom-Unity on December 17, 2012. The game celebrates the 25th anniversary of Capcom's Mega Man and Street Fighter franchises, mimicking the design of classic Mega Man games but with Street Fighter characters substituting as important enemies encountered in the game.<br/><br/>The game mimics the appearance and gameplay style of Mega Man games released on the Nintendo Entertainment System, and Mega Man uses the same set of moves (the slide and the charge shot) featured in Mega Man 4. Rather than using wholly original stages and Robot Masters, the stages share influences with stages from the Street Fighter franchise and characters such as Blanka, Chun-Li, and Ryu take the place of the Robot Masters as the end of level bosses. The Street Fighter characters use their signature moves as attacks; in addition, they have their own Super Meters that build up when they take damage during the boss fights and allow them to launch a powerful attack at Mega Man once filled. Like other Mega Man games, defeating each boss earns Mega Man a new weapon based on the characters; in this game, Mega Man earns famous Street Fighter attacks such as Ryu's Hadouken and Chun-Li's Hyakuretsu Kyaku.&quot;<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;Street Fighter X Mega Man&quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "135019": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1502976.jpg", "is_expanded_by": {"146395": {"name": "Formula E: Double Track Expansion"}}, "poll": {}, "boardgamedesigner": {"125": {"name": "Bruno Faidutti"}}, "statistics": {}, "yearpublished": "2014", "maxplayers": "6", "boardgameartist": {"65633": "Jacqui Davis"}, "boardgamepublisher": {"9695": {"name": "Clever Mojo Games"}}, "maxplaytime": "60", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1502976_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "60", "boardgamecategory": {"1089": {"name": "Animals"}}, "description": "Every year, villagers gather from far and wide for the harvest festival.

Players use deductive reasoning and estimate probability to overcome elements of luck.  The game board is a large sheet of paper covered by clear plastic.  Equipment consists of a grease pencil, 6 small wood player markers, two dice, and three decks of cards.  One set of cards is the Computer Action deck, including fifty gold-colored cards each with an instruction for the player to follow when instructed by the board.  The two other sets of cards, one blue and one green, are the Keyword decks, with names of countries (blue) and names of sports (green.)<br/><br/>On the board are three areas.  First, the Logic Path along which player markers are moved; this path has hundreds of thousands of possible variations and changes through the course of the game.  Instructions are written in each section of the path.  Second, the Output Buffers are six areas players use for spelling out their Keywords.  Third are the Subroutines, located on the board's bottom right corner.  These direct players either to change the path of logic or to move letters back and forth from the Output Buffers.<br/><br/>Players randomly draw one of each Keyword cards, then take turn rolling dice to determine how many steps to move their markers along the Logic Path.  The instructions of whatever section they land on are then followed, and quite a lot of complexity results between the rules for movement and the instructions from the board.  Players are awarded letters of their Keywords by making complete circuits of the logic board.  The winning player is first to spell out his Keywords in their entirety in his Output Buffers.<br/><br/>"}, "135025": {"rpgitemversion": {"191577": "PDF version"}, "statistics": {}, "name": "Frite Nite: 2003 Halloween Scenario Marathon", "rpgproducer": {"16213": "James Stubbs"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1502958.png", "usersrated": "0", "average": "0", "rpggenre": {"441": "Horror (Supernatural)"}, "rpg": {"2750": "Shriek"}, "rpgcategory": {"2084": "Scenario / Adventure / Module"}, "poll": {}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1502958_t.png", "description": "From Introduction:<br/><br/>Lab Rats by Colin Fisk<br/>The Premise: This is a fairly straightforward &ldquo;bug hunt&rdquo; scenario.

Harvest Moon 3 is the last game for the Game Boy Color in the series, and also one of the most distinctive. Its original Japanese release was on two separate cartridges (one for the Boy side and one for the Girl side), but was combined into one single cartridge for overseas release.<br/><br/>The character may be chosen as a boy or a girl. The beginning and ending are different depending on which character the player chooses. The boy is a successful Rancher, living on the farm from Harvest Moon 2, who is asked by the mayor to help a girl on a nearby island run the farm of her father. The girl's beginning shows her trying to save Harry's farm by taking control of it. She then meets the boy character.<br/><br/>Harvest Moon 3 takes place on an island, which has some mountainous regions, a grassland, a small village, and the farm where a lot of the game takes place. There are no shops to buy things like tools, crops, and animals; every Monday and Thursday a ferry is available to take the character to the mainland, where all of the shops reside. This is an element unique to Harvest Moon games, as most allow players to buy things whenever they desire.<br/><br/>Growing crops and raising livestock are among the prime tasks in Harvest Moon 3. But, as with many other HM games, the player has the opportunity to marry his/her partner, and even have a baby. There are some differences between playing as the male or female character; the girl starts out with a free cow and a brush, but cannot upgrade tools, when the boy character can. The male also has more stamina than the female. Also when the player marries as the girl, the game ends, but as a boy, the game continues.<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;Harvest Moon 3&quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "135072": {"statistics": {}, "name": "Hello Kitty's Cube Frenzy", "videogamemode": {"2149": "Single-Player"}, "videogameversion": {"191678": "North American Game Boy Color edition"}, "average": "0", "videogametheme": {"2468": "Children's"}, "videogamegenre": {"2165": "Puzzle"}, "videogamefranchise": {"17388": "Hello Kitty"}, "videogameplatform": {"4424": "Game Boy Color"}, "usersrated": "0", "poll": {}, "description": "The game involves guiding Hello Kitty into every item on a given level, using different types of bricks to manipulate her surroundings, thus allowing her to get every item.

They may not be conditional or contain the word &ldquo;if&rdquo;.<br/>A Change of Situation (COS) may be enemy forces appear, you are fired upon, you receive a message etc. COS happen at every level, so a COS for a brigade is also a COS for every higher level formation. The rules list 13 kinds of COS and provide for each a set of possible responses. Responses include sending a message, taking defensive action, etc.<br/>Movement is simultaneous. There is no &ldquo;movement phase.&rdquo; Players simply begin acting on orders until a COS occurs.<br/><br/>This is a very interesting set of rules. There are major &ldquo;gray areas&rdquo; but I guess given the nature of the rules that is to be expected. They are clearly meant to be more of a skeleton. For example, they do not spell out if you remove strips or just track casualties on a roster. They refer to many events but do not spell out how they are to be handled - that is left up to the ruling of an umpire or to be worked out between the players.<br/><br/>These are especially tempting for playing big battles in small spaces.

Track friendly, moderate, and hostile targets with the same system to monitor the status and position of both your squadron and other objects/ships in the area.<br/><br/>- Lock onto objects in space with the tractor beam to place them in needed positions for combat and defense. Use the beam to recover valuable materials and resources.<br/><br/>- Support for keyboard, mouse, joystick, and gamepad controls. Flight controls and functions can be changed and remapped.<br/><br/>- Supports NaturalPoint's TrackIR 3D head tracking system. TrackIR captures the player's head motion to control the in-game view from the cockpit independent of keyboard, mouse, joystick, or gamepad inputs.<br/><br/>Graphics and Environment:<br/>- New graphics engine that includes vastly improved lighting and textures along with new elements like HUD indicator shadows and reflection/gloss effects. Missile contrails, advanced particle effects, lens flare corona haze, and multiple light source illumination effects are also new features of the engine.<br/><br/>- Virtually unlimited universe size allows all gameplay events to take place in one massive environment. Nebula clouds, planets, asteroid fields, moons, and other environment objects can be flown to seamlessly.<br/><br/>- Seamlessly fly to and attack targets on the surface of large planets without cut scenes or loading screens. The transition to planet atmospheres is seamless, including automatic flight control/display adjustments to change as needed to adapt to different environmental conditions.<br/><br/>- Complete in-scene 3D cockpit. Gauges, HUD, and cockpit structures are now rendered entirely with the 3D engine, providing a level of detail far beyond the typical 2D displays and 2D text found in other space-sims. The cockpit, including the gauges and their readouts, moves and responds to inertia, view selection, lighting, and environment activities. Glass reflections (that also respond to changing light conditions), helmet visor based HUD, and panning first person view controls compliment the new 3D cockpit system. Players who prefer an old fashioned, flat 2D style appearance with no cockpit have the option to disable the 3D cockpit and use a static HUD, if desired.<br/><br/>- High resolution scenery textures for nebula backdrops, planets, clouds, and more help add to the new look, environmental immersion, and feel of the game.<br/><br/>Audio:<br/>- High quality sounds with improved enviromental effects.<br/><br/>- Effects like the cycling inbound missile range signal, vocal warning alerts, and much more active radio chatter provide a new level of audio detail.<br/><br/>Customizing and Modification:<br/>- Open to graphics customizing and changing. Import your own HUD designs, individual cockpits for each ship, and ships themselves. You can even change display positions and rename ships/weapons.<br/><br/>- If you import your own ships, you no longer have to replace the built-in ships. Imported ships will simply be added to the list of available ships to fly. You can also provide a configuration file with your ship to establish engine exhaust placement/scale, performance, description, and other parameters.<br/><br/>- Import your own custom sound effects and music for the game.<br/><br/>- A new custom mission system that gives you more control over the environment configuration, briefing cycles, and objectives. A more manageable text file structure is used that includes labels for each mission parameter.<br/><br/>Source: The Publisher Website.<br/><br/>"}, "135152": {"boardgamedesigner": {"64441": {"name": "Garrett Herdter"}}, "poll": {}, "name": "Rolling for Amusement", "playingtime": "45", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": {"2072": "Dice Rolling"}, "yearpublished": "0", "usersrated": "1", "boardgamefamily": {"22184": "Admin: Unreleased Games"}, "maxplayers": "4", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1577468_t.jpg", "average": "6", "statistics": {}, "boardgamepublisher": {"21849": {"name": "Phoenix Rising Games"}}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1577468.jpg", "boardgameversion": {"191965": "First edition"}, "maxplaytime": "45", "boardgamecategory": {"1002": {"name": "Card Game"}}, "age": "8", "minplaytime": "45", "description": "There is only one thing greater than going to an amusement park&mdash;Building One!

Some later versions of Telka include rules for playing Chinese Checkers (a.k.a.
