The designers had been playing Go, but couldn't find a balanced way to play three. So they created a grid composed of triangles laid into a hexagon shape, and designed Triplexity. Stones are played on the intersections of the grid-lines. The object of the game is to be the first player to get five or more stones in a row. Opponents' rows may be blocked, or their stones may be captured.<br/><br/>The designers describe the game:<br/><br/>&quot;Each player must try to establish a winning position with a strong but flexible offense, while hindering their opponents' play. Every placement of a game stone on the grid increases the possibilities and the complexities.<br/><br/>&quot;It is an aggressive, every one for themselves game; defensive alliances are short lived and not to be trusted, the timid player rarely comes out on top with each game taking generally not more than 10-15 minutes to play.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Offense writ large should be your plan; defense will follow from a superior offense. Quick moves will facilitate play and learning of the games.&quot;<br/><br/>From the original game manual (Copyright 1984):<br/><br/>&quot;TRIPLEXITY(TM) is a unique system that allows the playing of several different games. Presented here are the two best, TRIPLEXITY(TM) and DUPLE(TM).  Although these two games are played with the same gemstones and on the same grid, they are significantly different, each involving different dynamics and requiring different strategies.<br/>TRIPLEXITY(TM) (a game for 3) and its partner game TRIPLE-TRIPLEXITY(TM) (a game for 6) offer something we have not seen before, a pure strategy game involving three adversaries.<br/>Each player must try to establish a winning position with a strong but flexible offense, while hindering their opponents play.  Every placement of a gemstone on the grid increases the possibilities and the complexities. As your skill improves you will realize more the dimensions and subtleties of this game.<br/>TRIPLEXITY(TM) is a surprisingly fast paced game.<br/>It is an aggressive , every one for themselves game, defensive alliances are short-lived and not to be trusted, the timid player rarely comes out on top with each game typically taking no more than 10-15 minutes to play.  TRIPLEXITY(TM) fits in well with the fast pace of our modern society, and by its nature is an appropriate metaphor for our times.<br/>DUPLE(TM) (a game for 2) and its partner game DOUBLE-DUPLE(TM) (a game for 4) are closer to the traditional strategy game, in that the third adversary, the wild card of TRIPLEXITY(TM), is missing. But the unique dynamics of the TRIPLEXITY(TM) grid remain, as well as the added dimension of playing two stones per turn.  This simple difference alters the strategy significantly.<br/>In DUPLE(TM), even more so than in TRIPLEXITY(TM), hesitating to seize control can cost you the game.  Yet going for control too soon can be disastrous.  DUPLE(TM) is a game of timing as much as it is a game of position.<br/>From the feedback we have gotten we have found some people preferred one game over the other.  We find comparisons difficult because of the unique qualities of each game.  <br/>TRIPLEXITY(TM) and DUPLE(TM), along with their partner games TRIPLE-TRIPLEXITY(TM) and DOUBLE-DUPLE(TM) as well as MONOTONY(TM) (a game for 1), cover such a range of possibilities that a truly excellent strategy game can be played with any number of people up to and including 6.  (Except 5, we have never been able to get this number to work well.  If you come up with something, we would enjoy learning how to play it!)<br/>TRIPLEXITY(TM) and DUPLE(TM) offers what we think are two of the best strategy games to have been discovered in a very long time.  If you are only an occasional game player we think you will find this to be one of the most fun and challenging game sets you have ever owned. If you are a frequent strategy game player then this one is a must and you will find, as we have, that it is a joy to play.<br/>In keeping with the quality of the games themselves we endeavored to bring them to you in a quality form. This is not cardboard and plastic and with proper care, your game should last you many years.<br/>Have fun.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;HISTORY: In early July, the summer of 1984, John and I were playing Go - the ancient game of territory capturing and strategy of lines. While we were playing Mario came over so we decided to see if the game could be played by three. Well we played our version of Go-moku-narrabe and had a measure of success and fun. However, we were not very satisfied.  So we discussed rule modifications and also the idea of a different playing grid. We were all in agreement over this advance.<br/>After this the rules just seemed to come with the playoff this new game on our grid.<br/>The snatch and snug came as developments of our play over the next several weeks.  I remember suggesting the snatch and we were all in agreement, but thought it would have very few applications.  Then Mario said why not, since w e were able to capture a stone, be able to secure a point.  We all agreed on this advance and the game was set.  But as our skills grew we got closer to the edge and John did his blitz edge game on us.  Well, we are all wiser now.<br/>So when we got tired of sharing the world championship game among ourselves we decided to offer you these games of which we are so fond.&quot;<br/><br/>"}, "22013": {"boardgamedesigner": ["Graeme Thomson", "Catherine Thomson"], "poll": [], "name": "GO mental SACRAmental", "playingtime": "60", "minplayers": "3", "boardgamemechanic": ["Roll / Spin and Move"], "yearpublished": "2006", "usersrated": "2", "maxplayers": "6", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic698744_t.jpg", "average": "6.25", "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["HL Games"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic698744.jpg", "maxplaytime": "60", "boardgamecategory": ["Religious", "Trivia"], "age": "9", "minplaytime": "60", "description": "From the Publisher:<br/><br/>&quot;GO mental&reg; SACRAmental   is more than just a Bible version of the classic game!

The King lies dead without an heir, slain by a villainous hand. Will a leader rise up and rally the support of the people, or will the shadow of anarchy spread over the land?<br/><br/>In Warrior Knights, each player takes on the role of a Baron vying for control of the Kingdom. Each Baron commands four faithful Nobles who lead his armies into battle. Each Baron seeks to capture cities in order to gain Influence (victory points), which is used to measure his claim to the throne. Barons may also seek to gain advantage by increasing their income, gathering Votes to use at the Assembly, or by amassing Faith, which can be used to gain a measure of control over chance events. Only through cunning strategy and careful diplomacy can a Baron hope to attain victory.<br/><br/>Warrior Knights has a very clever mechanic.  Each player has a selection of tasks they can accomplish each turn, such as move &amp; attack, gain political strength, hire mercenaries, and gain religious faith.  Only 6 of these are done in any turn.  Each player selects 2 tasks for each 1/3 of the game turn.  The task cards are then shuffled with all the other players.  So each player doesn't know the exact order of play, only which two tasks they will perform in each 1/3 of the game turn.<br/><br/>In addition, the game has four special phases that are triggered based on how frequently players are choosing a particular task.  Collecting taxes individually, once done often enough, will trigger a taxation phase.  Players collecting political power trigger a session of Parliment.  When enough players want to hire mercenaries, there is an auction for their services.  The flipside is that the more mercenaries that are hired, the more often they want to be paid in the wages phase.<br/><br/>The mixing of these two clever mechanics, choosing tasks but performing them in a random order and triggering the 4 special phases at somewhat unpredictable times makes for a tense game.   Players can often be caught short of cash if wages are demanded more frequently than taxes are collected.  If the other players all collect political influence, a Parliment might be called when one or two players has only a single vote.  These elements of variable turn orders and variable phases give the game a highly addictive quality.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": ["English edition", "French edition", "German edition", "Spanish edition"], "average": "6.87995", "name": "Warrior Knights", "playingtime": "180", "boardgamemechanic": ["Area Movement", "Auction/Bidding", "Campaign / Battle Card Driven", "Simultaneous Action Selection", "Voting"], "age": "12", "boardgameexpansion": ["25609"], "usersrated": "3450", "boardgamesubdomain": ["Strategy Games", "Thematic Games"], "boardgamefamily": ["4X games"], "boardgamepodcastepisode": ["Episode 26: Star Wars Rebellion Review - Brawlers Maul", "Episode 27: Broom Service Review - Questions from a Hat", "I've Been Diced! episode 4: Fantasy Flight big box games", "Show #2: Warrior Knights and Legions of Steel"]}, "22039": {"boardgamedesigner": ["(Uncredited)"], "poll": [], "name": "Scrabble People", "playingtime": "15", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": ["Hand Management", "Memory"], "yearpublished": "1985", "usersrated": "1", "maxplayers": "4", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic195752_t.jpg", "average": "6.5", "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["Selchow & Righter"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic195752.jpg", "boardgameversion": ["First edition"], "maxplaytime": "15", "boardgamecategory": ["Card Game", "Children's Game", "Memory"], "age": "5", "minplaytime": "15", "description": "Each player is dealt four cards and must have only four cards in his or her hand at the end of each turn.

All of the Zin pieces are portrayed as stacks of four hexagons of decreasing size.<br/><br/>The object of the game is to capture the opponent's 1-Zin piece.<br/><br/>The board is set up with the player's numbered Zin pieces behind a row of five Walls, with the Rogue Zin to the player's left near the center of the board.  Players take turns moving one piece per turn, starting with the Black player.  All pieces move in a straight line through unoccupied spaces, horizontally, vertically or diagonally.  Zin pieces may end their turn on top of Wall pieces.  The numbers on standard Zin pieces determine the maximum number of spaces that they may move.  Rogue Zins can move up to three spaces and have some special powers which make them more flexible than standard Zins.  Walls move only one space per turn, and only if they are unoccupied.<br/><br/>Pieces are captured by being landed on by an opponent's piece.  Regular Zins may only capture opponents on the same or a lower plane (i.e. they can't capture an opponent on a wall if they are on the surface of the board).  Walls may be either captured or landed upon at the player's discretion.  They may also be promoted to other types of pieces of they reach the opponent's side of the board.  In capturing, as in movement, Rogue Zins have some special rules which make them more powerful than their standard counterparts.<br/><br/>As a special gimmick, the game includes a special extra 1-Zin piece called a zinK featuring a serial number sticker on the bottom.

The rules on alliances must nevertheless be respected.<br/><br/>This new gaming mode is based on the idea that the battles they wage have consequences on the soldiers and that these consequences cause an evolution of those they affect. Unlike the old Incarnation system, which was focused on a Character, it gives you the opportunity to unite different fighters, to personalize them and to let them evolve freely from one exciting skirmish scenario to the next. This new gaming mode makes the fun of a good game of Confrontation last well beyond each battle by involving recruiting, improving characteristics, abilities and equipment, managing the wounded and the fighters&rsquo; resources, etc.<br/><br/>The young free companies will need new challenges.

When either player sees a complete pattern on their own side, they turn the board and the game ends.  A draw can occur if all blocks are played with no pattern completed.

They do this, in turn, by playing a potion card to retrieve an atomic element token of one of the types shown on the card from the central reserve and place it on their game board. They can also choose to remove an element token from their game board by playing a potion card with that element type. Alternatively, players can pass their turn by wiping their board clean of tokens.<br/><br/>Once a player has matched a crystal configuration, they wipe their board of tokens, collect the crystal structure card they matched, reveal a new crystal configuration card and begin collecting beads for another type of crystal. The twist is that each type of crystal confers upon its owner an additional special power (for example, the Time Crystal allows you to rearrange your board during your turn, instead of taking or removing an element token).

If the structure falls or bends enough to touch the table anywhere but the base, the last player loses.<br/><br/>The notches are inconsistently cut, so it's nearly impossible to play - sometimes you can't get the pieces together, and sometimes they fit too loose.<br/><br/>"}, "22197": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic264403.jpg", "poll": [], "boardgamedesigner": ["Kai Haferkamp"], "statistics": [], "yearpublished": "2006", "maxplayers": "4", "boardgameartist": ["Bluguy"], "boardgamepublisher": ["KOSMOS"], "maxplaytime": "30", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic264403_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "30", "boardgamecategory": ["Educational"], "boardgamehonor": ["2006 Deutscher Lernspielpreis \"3 years and up\" Nominee", "2006 Kinderspielexperten \"5-to-9-year-olds\" Nominee"], "description": "Kosmos&acute; next attempt to capture the crown of &quot;Kinderspiel des Jahres&quot; and from the same author as &quot;Das Kleine Gespenst&quot;.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": ["German first edition"], "name": "Das Sams", "playingtime": "30", "boardgamemechanic": ["Acting"], "average": "4.7", "usersrated": "10", "age": "5"}, "22198": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic145572.jpg", "poll": [], "boardgamedesigner": ["Reiner Knizia"], "statistics": [], "yearpublished": "2006", "maxplayers": "5", "boardgameartist": ["Ted Nasmith", "Marek Szyszko"], "boardgamepublisher": ["999 Games", "Devir", "Egmont Polska", "Fantasy Flight Games", "KOSMOS", "Laser plus"], "maxplaytime": "30", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic145572_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "30", "boardgamecategory": ["Card Game"], "boardgamehonor": ["2006 Japan Boardgame Prize Best Foreign Game for Beginners Nominee", "2007 Golden Geek Best Card Game Nominee"], "description": "This game lets each player take on the role of a Northern Chinese prince. His task: the construction of a massive wall. His reward: Honor everlasting! To gain the honor, though, requires some sweat. The requirements are the same for each player. Each player has a set of cards in his color: seven wall cards (worth 1 point), three gate cards (worth 2 points) and one watchtower card (worth 3 points). Additionally, each player gets nine more cards of varying point value and which may also allow special actions to be carried out.<br/><br/>At the start of the game, each player shuffles his deck of 20 cards and places it face-down in front of himself. He then draws five cards from the deck. Now, depending on the number of players, 2 to 4 pairs of prestige tiles (with values from 1 to 8) are set out as the starts of card rows.<br/><br/>On a player's turn, he first checks to see if he has a point majority in any of the card rows. Then, he carries out two additional actions. He has the choice of either drawing another card from the deck or adding cards to one of the rows. The added cards must  be identical. It is then the next player's turn.<br/><br/>If, when checking point totals, a player sees that he does have one or more majorities, then he chooses one of the prestige tiles and puts it onto one of his cards in that row. That prestige comes at a price: as long as the second prestige tile isn't claimed, the value of the prestige is subtracted from that player's total for that row. Once the second tile is claimed (which can be by the same player on a later turn), then both winning players set the tiles they won aside to score. Two new prestige tiles are revealed and the prestige for that row replenished.<br/><br/>The fight for prestige is also influenced by cards with special actions. For example, if a 'noble' card (1) is played, then the values of all cards in that row are reduced to 1. A 'dragon' card (1) can be played onto another player's card, neutralizing it. 'Cavalry' (2) are worth 2 points, and, equally valuably, do not cost an action. 'Infantry' (5) are strong in groups. A single 'infantry' card is only worth 1 point, but the next one is worth 2, and then 3, etc.<br/><br/>The game ends either when one player has played his last card or when the last prestige tile is taken. Afterwards, each player gets one last turn and then all card rows are resolved in turn order. The player with the most prestige at the end of the game wins.  Players only receive prestige for tiles they have set aside for scoring.  Tiles remaining on wall segments do not score.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": ["Dutch edition", "Dutch First edition", "KOSMOS German edition", "Polish edition", "Small Box Edition", "Spanish Edition"], "average": "6.23058", "name": "Great Wall of China", "playingtime": "30", "boardgamemechanic": ["Area Control / Area Influence", "Hand Management"], "age": "10", "usersrated": "1806", "boardgamesubdomain": ["Family Games", "Strategy Games"], "boardgamefamily": ["Asian Theme", "Country: China", "Fantasy Flight Silver Line Games"], "boardgamepodcastepisode": ["BGB Volume 24 - Session Review with Great Wall of China, California, Toppo, and Cleopatra in brief with Chad Smith"]}, "22199": {"boardgamedesigner": ["Ron Roberts, M.Ed."], "poll": [], "name": "Picture+ This", "playingtime": "0", "minplayers": "4", "boardgamemechanic": ["Co-operative Play", "Partnerships"], "yearpublished": "0", "usersrated": "0", "maxplayers": "0", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic189510_t.jpg", "average": "0", "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["ACT Games"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic189510.jpg", "boardgameversion": ["First edition"], "maxplaytime": "0", "boardgamecategory": ["Party Game", "Puzzle"], "age": "0", "minplaytime": "0", "description": "Players form teams and try to score points for their teams by guessing the meanings of rebus picture-puzzles, representing items from the categories people, places, clich&eacute;s, or TV/movies.

A move can end on a friendly Tower-stone or -stack, but Guard-stones can never become part of a stack.<br/><br/>It is possible to capture enemy stones by landing on them, under certain conditions. Guard-stones can always land on any enemy stone or stack and likewise, anything can land on the enemy Guard-stone. A tower-stone or stack can capture enemy stones or stacks only when it at least matches the height of the opposing stack. All Tower-stones that are captured are removed from play and as stated before, taking the enemy Guard-stone is one way of two ways to win the game.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": ["Clemens Gerhards Wooden Edition", "Spielbox edition"], "age": "8", "name": "Turm & W\u00e4chter", "playingtime": "20", "average": "5.64286", "usersrated": "7", "boardgamesubdomain": ["Abstract Games"], "boardgamefamily": ["Spielbox"]}, "22221": {"boardgamedesigner": ["Jose Mellina"], "poll": [], "name": "K'DOR", "playingtime": "10", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": ["Tile Placement"], "yearpublished": "1996", "usersrated": "3", "boardgamesubdomain": ["Abstract Games"], "maxplayers": "2", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic114327_t.jpg", "average": "7.33333", "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["Jeux PBM"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic114327.jpg", "boardgameversion": ["First edition"], "maxplaytime": "10", "boardgamecategory": ["Abstract Strategy"], "age": "8", "minplaytime": "10", "description": "Material: 1 wooden gameboard and 24 wooden pieces.<br/>The two players in turn set down one piece on the board until one of them can no longer play.<br/>It is forbidden to place two pieces of the same color on two neighboring squares linked by a canal.

The original title, &quot;Auf der Reeperbahn...,&quot; alludes to a popular German movie from 1954.<br/><br/>Near the center of a 17-space track start the six game figures which the players compete to attract to their opposite ends of the board.  You play as many cards of the same color on your turn as you wish, and much of the movement is a direct result of card play:  e.g., by playing a red 4 you bring the red figure (&quot;Rote Lola&quot; or &quot;Dancing Deb&quot;) 4 spaces closer to your end of the board.<br/><br/>However, there are special tricks and restrictions which must be learned and held firmly in mind before the sense of the game begins to emerge.  The central green figure (&quot;Brilli-Lilli&quot; or &quot;Saucy Sue&quot;) which wins for you if the game ends with her on your half of the board, for example, can only move within the bounds of her &quot;bodyguards,&quot; two grey figures.  The yellow figure (&quot;Blonde Hans&quot; or &quot;Handsome Hal&quot;) can summon, without benefit of a card played, any of these three figures to his square.  The companion green figure (&quot;Schampus-Charly&quot; or &quot;Champagne Charlie&quot;) which can also win the game if you get him into one of the two spaces at your end of the board (your &quot;nightclub&quot;), only moves toward you if the board situation at the end of your turn involves both bodyguards on your half of the board and/or one of the other figures in your nightclub.  And so on.<br/><br/>The game, part of the Kosmos two-player series, is one of attack and counterattack, defense and forward thinking, and can be won early or on the turn of the last card on the second time through the deck.

In the 17th Century, E-Sugoroku became popular with beautiful art on boards depicting the journey from Kyoto to Edo, or scenes of famous Kabuki actors. A second wave of popularity occurred in the 19th Century, after the Meiji Restoration, at which time it also became more of a children's game. Today, E-Sugoroku sets feature contemporary themes and can be found in toy-stores and 100-yen shops. <br/>A feature of E-Sugoroku is that dice rolls do not always translate into the same number of steps. Instead, progress from one step to the next could be made only by rolling specific numbers, or different numbers could indicate different paths to be taken.<br/>E-Sugoroku should be distinguished from Ban-Sugoroku (BGG entry at Sugoroku), a game with an earlier origin and which is more akin to Backgammon.

Usually they are originals by well-known authors that have appeared nowhere else, and at times they were so good that they were later appeared in full-on productions. Sometimes they were welcome reprints of highly regarded and hard to get games (3m's Jati). Exactly what prompted the republication of this old German children's game is better left the mystery it is, as there is very little remarkable about it. Maybe it was a great game by 1931's standards, but the German market by 1986 should have left a game like this in a corner best forgotten.<br/><br/>It is what can be typified as a Snake-and-Ladders game without the ladders, or 1-pawn Ludo with traps in which the prettiest girl may start. Players make their way with a single pawn from start to finish along a track of 6 rows, each 7 spaces long. The last square (on each row end before turning the corner) is a trap. When a player's pawn lands in one of those traps it will be sent back to square one, but not before a 6 is rolled to release the pawn from the trap. The only quicker way to start all over again is when another player lands in the same trap, because any player ending a move on another pawn's square sends that pawn back to the very beginning. Can it get worse? Yes, by landing in the last trap, because you get an immediate &quot;mercy&quot; die roll. A 6 means instant victory, any other number rolled will mean permanent removal from the game.<br/><br/>Maybe it was a reminder how far German game design had progressed in the 55 years since 1931. Saying that, it probably takes some considerable skill to make a game that is worse than Snakes-and-Ladders into a classic that warrants a reprint in one of Germany's most respected game magazines.

There are two types of roles for the players, either Chemical Companies or Merchant Bankers (with about one third of the players being Merchant Bankers). All players rolls two six sided dice and move their marker along the track that many steps, paying rent to the owner or buying the property if it is not owned.<br/><br/>The Merchant Bankers usually acts as bankers and loan money to the Chemicals Companies, at terms that are up to the players to negotiate, but can own some properties (Pipelines and Transport Companies). The Chemical Companies can own Chemical Plants, of which there are six types, including the special &quot;Steam Crackers&quot; that enhance the other plants, but not Transport Companies and Pipelines.<br/><br/>Any player can take loans from the game's bank, the International Bank, when buying properties or developing a property but only up to 50 % of the needed amount and always at 20 % interest. If any player needs more money or there is a need for money when the player have to pay for the rent of a property, a board meeting requires money or the taxes are due, then that player may negotiate a loan with any of the Merchant Bankers (up to 80 % of the required sum, but at any interest rate and terms the players agree upon).<br/><br/>Apart from properties the game board consists of Board Meetings (when the player might gain or loose money), taxation and income.<br/><br/>When a player cannot pay, not even by selling property to some other player or by taking a loan, then that player becomes bankrupt and a special meeting is held among the creditors. The purpose of this meeting is to strike a deal where each creditor gains as much as possible and at the same time the bankruptcy is prevented.

Rather unusual landscape types need to be crossed in this game: Clay flats, fields, hot sand, green lawns, water and cobblestones, even some rare blue-white or beige tiles. These landscapes are found on 28 large landscape cards, each of which again is made up of 18 landscape spaces, arranged in random fashion.<br/><br/>The landscape cards get mixed up and distributed among the players (7 each with 3p and 4p, 8 with 2p - the rest go back in the box). Now, each player gets to set two particularly difficult cards aside and places the rest on the table to form a race circuit (the narrow sides of the cards are joined together). Thus, a different track with different challenges is created for each player. A goal card marks the goal for each player.<br/><br/>Before the game can begin, 48 small cards are placed in the middle of the table as a face-down, spread out pile. Each card shows one of the landscape types mentioned above.<br/><br/>As soon as the game starts, all players wildly grab through the pile of cards on the table. Cards, once revealed, are left face-up if they're not of immediate use. Cards that a player wants to keep are taken in hand. The order of the cards being collected, though, cannot be altered in any way. The collection phase ends when there's only face-up cards left on the table and a player calls &quot;stop&quot; because he thinks he has enough cards.<br/><br/>Now, the players will see how far they get along their track with the cards they collected. The player who called &quot;stop&quot; starts. He turns the first card he collected over. If it's sand, for example, he puts his marker on a sand space at the start of his course. Thereafter, each subsequent card must show a landscape type that is next to the one his marker is on (either sideways, forwards or diagonally forwards) for him to move forwards. As soon as a card comes up that doesn't allow him to move his marker, his turn is over. Collected cards that are left over are put back into the middle of the table (face-down), and the figure stays where it managed to get to. Each player in turn order then does the same, moving their figure and returning leftover cards. Continue in this manner, round after round, until one player reaches the goal, ending the game. That player is of course the winner.<br/><br/>Description of the game from Kosmos.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": ["German edition", "Rio Grande Games edition"], "name": "Zig-Zag", "playingtime": "25", "boardgamemechanic": ["Set Collection"], "average": "5.65221", "usersrated": "310", "age": "8"}, "22268": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic196652.jpg", "poll": [], "boardgamedesigner": ["Michael Rieneck"], "statistics": [], "yearpublished": "2006", "maxplayers": "2", "boardgameartist": ["Ren\u00e9 Goscinny", "Albert Uderzo"], "boardgamepublisher": ["KOSMOS"], "maxplaytime": "20", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic196652_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "20", "boardgamecategory": ["Card Game", "Comic Book / Strip", "Fighting"], "description": "This is a game in the Kosmos two-player series.<br/><br/>Description from Kosmos:<br/><br/>In this two-player game featuring Gallic heroes Asterix &amp; Obelix, the occupying Romans wear the usual costume for those stationed here: bumps and bruises.<br/><br/>New Roman overseer Zenturio has let the money-hungry Gallic chief Moralelastix convince him to mount an operation against his little village. As usual, the question isn't &quot;Will the Romans get beat up?&quot;, it's &quot;How badly will the Romans get beat up?&quot;<br/><br/>The two players play as Asterix and Obelix. Each takes the matching playing figure as well as a set of 15 beating cards (3 cards in each of 5 different colors), which he places in front of himself as a face-down deck. Each player takes the top 5 cards in hand. In addition to the beating cards, there are Roman cards. Most of them show Roman Legionnaires (in 5 different colors), but there are also Pirates, Wild Boars, the traitor Moralelastix and 5 Village Feast cards.<br/><br/>The 40 cards are well shuffled and placed as a face-down pile. Then, the top 16 cards are drawn and placed face-down on the table in classic Phalanx formation (4x4 grid). The remaining cards act as a draw pile.<br/><br/>The player with the longest mustache (or alternately the biggest belly) begins. He places his figure in front of one of the four Phalanx rows and turns the topmost card over. A red Roman! Red Romans can only get beat up by Red beating cards. If the active player doesn't have any, then the Roman card is turned back over again and that player's turn is over. If he does has a red card, though, then he has to choose whether to end his turn (taking the beaten Roman as a trophy) or turn another card over, hoping to press his luck.<br/><br/>A player can keep going until (in an extreme case) he's cleared an entire row of the Phalanx. In that case, the active player gets to refill his hand to 5 cards and then start in on another row. Of course, that may not be such a good idea. Because if he keeps going and finds a Roman card he can't beat up, then his turn is over and he receives nothing. All of the Romans he would have won are removed from the game instead. Players can reduce the luck a little bit, in that they can discard one card from their hand to look at the last card in the row where they placed their figure.<br/><br/>When a player ends his turn (freely or because he was forced to), then he refills his hand to five cards and it is the other player's turn. Any holes in the Roman Phalanx are also filled back in with cards from the draw pile. Lastly, the player whose turn just ended gets to block the next player from trying one of the rows (either horizontally or vertically).<br/><br/>Of the 40 Roman cards, only 30 show actual Romans (as well as Zenturios himself). The remaining 10 cards are: 3 Pirates, 1 Wild Boar, Moralelastix, and 5 Evening Feasts. Pirates are easy to beat: Any card will do. To get Moralelastix, two cards of a single color are needed. The Wild Boar ends the player's turn immediately, but he gets to keep the Romans he beat up on so far. If a Feast is revealed, nothing happens and the player gets to keep going. Revealed Feasts are set aside, and once the fifth Feast shows up the game is over.<br/><br/>Now, the players count their victory points. The purple point goes to the player who got Moralelastix. A brown point is for the most pirates. The majorities in the five Roman colors are worth the red, blue, yellow, green and black points, respectively.

If basic navigation wasn't tricky enough, approaching any bit of rock that sticks out of the water somewhere, inevitably means being lured towards your death by the mesmerizing singing of a local hair-combing siren. Loreley, sitting on her rock, surrounded by the Rhine, is one of the more famous ones, and the German mythology is brought to life in this simple family game. Getting your boatmen from the boats surrounding the rock to the safety of the Loreley rock and reaching the fair maiden itself is what this game is all about.<br/><br/>Loreley sits on top of her rock in the center of the board, dutifully combing her hair. The Loreley rock is surrounded by 32 boats, and each boat has room for two to four boatmen. Players will first have to get all their 12 boatmen onto these boats, before the race to the top of the rock starts in earnest, by moving boatmen from the boats onto the rock itself. There are four tracks on the rock, one for each player's color, and all are exactly 11 spaces long. When a player places the 12th boatman on the rock Loreley is reached and that player wins the game.<br/><br/>Players start with 2 of their boatmen already placed on seats in the boats. By rolling the dice, these boatmen are moved from boat to boat. When a boatmen lands on a boat that already contains sailors, that player can place as many new sailors onto empty seats on the board as there are present in that boat before landing on it. You can't land (or place) in boats that are fully occupied. When all of a player's sailors are in boats already, instead of bringing a certain amount of new boatmen into play, that player can start to remove that same amount of sailors onto the rock and when someone's last sailor is moved from the boats to the rock, that player wins the game.<br/><br/>The game needs 3 or 4 players to work, and is mainly aimed at families with children around 7-9 years old.<br/><br/>Publication history: this game first appeared in a full production with Pelikan in 1973. &quot;Altmeister&quot; Rudi Hoffman's return to the game industry after a long illness was celebrated by the republication of his family classic by Spielbox magazine (5/1986 oct-nov), as one of the earlier entrants in the &quot;Spiel zum Herausnehmen/Game to Remove&quot; series.

First player to do so wins. A game can end prematurely when a player manages to capture all stones from the other player(s), or when all other players had to resign from the game because there was no legal move available in their turn.<br/><br/>There are 16 stones in play. Each player owns 4 stones, and the remainder are neutral. In a 4 player game there is an added twist as each player shares 2 of the 4 stones with other players. One with the player on the left, the other with the one on the right.<br/><br/>In the starting positions, all stones are isolated. Each turn a player can move a friendly or neutral stone the same way as the knight jumps in chess (two straight and one sideways in all directions). Initially, for as long as there are isolated pieces on the board, each piece has to jump to a space neighboring at least one other (a diagonal connection doesn't count). This way smaller and bigger groups will form, and this has to continue until all pieces form one single chained group. Once a group has been established, it is not allowed to break it up again, so after each jump there has to be a single chain present. It is also forbidden to move a neutral stone immediately after it has just been moved.<br/><br/>As soon as there are no isolated stones or groups left, &quot;owned&quot; pieces can be captured by landing on them. Neutral pieces can never be taken. A player wins when all his remaining pieces have reached their target, so losing a stone or two might not be a bad tactic.<br/><br/>A clever use of the knight's move, and the ability to capture pieces, coupled with the restriction to maintain a single group makes this far more than yet another Halma-variation.<br/><br/>Publication history: this game appeared in Spielbox magazine (1/1986 Feb-Mar) as one of the earlier entrants in the &quot;Spiel zum Herausnehmen/Game to Remove&quot; series. It later showed up again on the 2002 G&ouml;ttingen Spieleautorentreff, where game designers meet to showcase their self-published inventions, in a wooden version with colored film-spool-lids as playing pieces.

The other major powers saw that as a threat, and so supported their own candidate, Charles III. That in turn began over a decade of fighting that grew into a general struggle for domination over all of western Europe.<br/><br/>Marby is a two player game. One controls the forces of France and its allies, known as the Bourbon coalition, after the ruling house of France. The other player controls the forces opposing France, led by England and Austria and known as the Grand Alliance. Each player has a variety of military, diplomatic and economic instruments with which he can attempt to win the game by controlling states and economic centers.<br/><br/>The game includes several scenarios. Shorter scenarios represent critical parts of the war, while the &quot;Grand Design&quot; scenario covers the entire war. Certain rules are designated &quot;optional,&quot; and the players don't have to use them. The optional rules are suggested for use only when playing the Grand Design scenario, as they add considerable complexity, historical detail and playing time.<br/><br/>The 34x22&quot; large-hex map shows western and central Europe during the early 18th century. The grid of hexagons printed over the map provides locations for playing pieces and geographic features.

Each army represents 10,000 to 20,000 soldiers and support personnel, camp followers, etc. A leader represents that person plus his guards, entourage, lackeys, wine cellars, etc. A fleet represents 60 warships and an indeterminate number of transports.

The game of chess is simple. It is difficult only if you make it so. And Crescendo Chess is as simple as regular chess. It is played by the same rules. The chess men move the same. A full set of rules and instructions that completely cover Crescendo Chess are included. After several moves, you then enter into the exciting world of mobility, power, and cunning. Compounding the power and mobility of the chess pieces accelerates the game and sharpens one's perception of the effects of combining different pieces. Thus one gains a broader insight and a better appreciation of this game. Because of this, Crescendo Chess enhances regular chess.<br/><br/>&quot;Crescendo Chess is a new experience for any chess player. By following the rather simple rules, one can soon learn to think in terms of stacking, capturing and position playing. One important feature in Crescendo Chess is that the chess men have a hole on top and one on the bottom that permits pegging one piece atop another. When this is done, it is called &quot;stacking.&quot; A stack of chess men can then move across the board together. One soon learns not to exhaust the stack ineffectively. Experience teaches how to take advantage of the best stacking arrangements for certain types of attack and defense.&quot;<br/><br/>In one turn the stack moves first as the bottom piece normally would move as in regular chess, then continues as the next piece up would move, etc. It costs one turn to place a piece on a stack. On the next turn, the stack can make its move (see rule8). To give an example, a Knight can be placed atop a Bishop in one turn. Then, on a later turn, the two together would move the permissible diagonal move of the Bishop and the two together could continue, one - one, two, as the Knight would move.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;It is important that in stacking, the pieces are moved into the stack using their regular move, - that is, a Bishop diagonally, a Rook forward or sideways, etc. Each piece must be free to make its move as in regular chess rules.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Crescendo Chess is so called because it starts as regular chess and then increases in intensity. As stated, the first two moves by each player are made on a regular basis. After that, the next four moves by each player may be made where one piece is stacked on top of another to a two level height.Max. (L2). NOTE: See Glossary &amp; Game Notations at end of rules. It is not necessary to stack the pieces if the player does not wish to do so.<br/><br/>Upon completion of a total of six moves by each player, the pieces may be stacked to a three level height. Max. (L3). This is the stacking limit for the rest of the game. The three can move first as the bottom piece, which then remains, then as the other two would move as a two piece stack.&quot;<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": ["First edition"], "name": "Crescendo Chess", "playingtime": "240", "boardgamemechanic": ["Grid Movement", "Variable Player Powers"], "average": "0", "usersrated": "0", "boardgamesubdomain": ["Abstract Games"], "boardgamefamily": ["Chess Games"]}, "22311": {"boardgamedesigner": ["Dennis P.

The guests wake up and gather only to be horrified with the discovery of the lifeless body of one of them. Who could have killed him? And more importantly, who will be the next victim?<br/><br/>Fatal Rendez Vous plays a bit like Werewolf, with most players belonging to one group while one or more of them secretly work against the group. Each player receives a role card at the start of play. Each night in the game, while everyone has their eyes closed, one of the secret assassins taps another player on the shoulder; this player counts to ten, then dies. Day comes, and everyone runs around in a tizzy &mdash; specifically turning in circles three times &mdash; during which time the other assassin winks at someone, killing that person as well.<br/><br/>The guests handcuff two players during the day, and those two players take no actions for the next day. This pattern continues until three days pass. If the assassins have been handcuffed together during the weekend, then the other guests win, having captured the evildoers; if not, however, the assassins claim the victory.<br/><br/>Fatal Rendez Vous includes special role cards that mix up play, for example, with a player who becomes a vampire after death, taking out the assassin and murdering people on his own. Another player might have a weak heart and perish after only five seconds, giving the assassin less time to find cover.<br/><br/><br/>From TricTrac:<br/><br/>Le D&eacute;fifoo Noir (subtitled Friday the 13th at the Castle) is a game inspired by Cluedo and Agatha Christie&rsquo;s 12 Little Indians and is another game in the lineage of Werewolf. It is designed by Olivier Finet, principal designer at D&eacute;fifoo SA. The game can accommodate 5 to 20 players and play time is estimated at 30 minutes.<br/><br/>Players are given a special role representing either an innocent guest at the castle or a sinister murderer. The players are invited to investigate the murders and hopefully throw the right suspect(s) in prison. In this game however, people are free to move around during the day phases and interact freely with one another, thereby using all of their senses to nab their victims/assailants. These negotiation phases however are timed and last only 3 minutes. Making things harder on the poor guests, the murders happen both at night and during the day over a maximum of 5 turns. The game components include the role cards, a pair of handcuffs (for the culprits), a timer and a bowtie for the Castle&rsquo;s host (game overseer).<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "5", "boardgameversion": ["French edition 2006", "Multilingual edition 2014"], "age": "8", "name": "Fatal Rendez Vous", "playingtime": "30", "boardgamemechanic": ["Partnerships", "Role Playing", "Variable Player Powers", "Voting"], "average": "5.97097", "usersrated": "31", "boardgamefamily": ["D\u00e9fifoo", "Werewolf / Mafia"]}, "22345": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic244381.jpg", "poll": [], "boardgamedesigner": ["S\u00e9bastien Pauchon"], "statistics": [], "yearpublished": "2006", "maxplayers": "4", "boardgameartist": ["Arnaud Demaegd", "Mike Doyle (I)"], "boardgamepublisher": ["HUCH! & friends", "MINDOK", "Quined White Goblin Games", "Rio Grande Games", "Ystari Games"], "maxplaytime": "60", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic244381_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "45", "boardgamecategory": ["Arabian", "Dice", "Economic"], "boardgamehonor": ["2006 Meeples' Choice Award", "2006 Tric Trac d'Or", "2006 Tric Trac Nominee", "2007 Golden Geek Best Family Board Game Nominee", "2007 Golden Geek Best Gamer's Board Game Nominee", "2007 International Gamers Awards - General Strategy; Multi-player Nominee", "2007 Kinderspielexperten \"8-to-13-year-olds\" Nominee", "2007 Spiel des Jahres Nominee", "2008 As d'Or - Jeu de l'Ann\u00e9e Nominee", "2008 Nederlandse Spellenprijs Nominee"], "description": "1598.

Volume I covers the period from the start of the War in 1939 to the early months of 1943. You serve as BdU, Befehlshaber der U-Boote; the Supreme Commander of Uboats, Kriegsmarine. Your mission is to deploy your forces with maximum effect to destroy British and Allied shipping, while limiting your own submarine losses.<br/><br/>Featured scenarios cover actions ranging from famous short single sub patrols, through short campaigns, ending with the full campaign covering 1939 to 1943. The game map breaks the Atlantic, Mediterranean, South Atlantic, and Western Indian Oceans into historical Operations Areas through which subs patrol in search of shipping.<br/><br/>Special rules feature historical events such as the invasion of Norway and Torch; b-dienst, ULTRA, and the intelligence war; torpedo improvements, German wolfpack tactics, Super-Skippers, large vs. small U-boat philosophy, appeals to Berlin for resources, and many others. Every German sub deployed between 1939 and 1943 (as well as some what-if classes) is represented with its very own counter, each meticulously and accurately drawn and shown from their side in full-color.

A-class ships move faster and carry more cargo, but cannot navigate the Suez or Panama Canals. The home port is important, because it counts as a permanent trade contract and many of the game functions can only be carried out there.<br/><br/>During the game, players draw destination cards and cargoes, which can then be bought from the bank. Cargoes can only be sold in one of the destinations - each card has 3 to choose from. Players can also buy trade contracts for the ports, which brings in more profit when selling cargo there and forces other players to pay fees when visiting those ports. At the start of the game there's a basic profit for selling cargo; stock market fluctuations (event cards) may later change this.<br/><br/>Movement at sea is by die rolling.

This is done through putting pressure on the Republic by territorial conquests, by exacerbating the tensions in the Republic, forcing it to utilize the services of new, potential Sullas to counter your armies in the field, or by taking Rome itself!<br/><br/>As the Republic, you must defeat and neutralize Sertorius quickly, before he can conclude an alliance with Mithradates VI and cause a two-front war. However, the levying of too many troops to fight the enemy coupled with the utilization of ambitious generals can bring on the very circumstances you are trying to avoid, collapse of the Republic. In addition, care must be taken with Italy itself because in the background, civil war looms in the guise of Lepidus, and even worse, a slave revolt under the able gladiator-leader, Spartacus.<br/><br/>Both sides can battle their adversaries using conventional forces, conduct guerrilla and pacification operations with the intention of denying your opponent control of strategic spaces and provinces, and attempt to hasten or delay the political collapse of the Republic. The central mechanism that influences all actions in the simulation is the Republican Crisis Track, which monitors the level of crisis in the Republic. All actions on the battlefield, the state of the empire, the strain of recruiting legions and utilizing ambitious generals, and the use of power politics, are ultimately reflected on the Crisis Track. The Sertorians hope to move the track towards heightened crisis while the Republic hopes to keep it well away from a political collapse. In the end, if the Republic manages to avoid collapse, it can still lose by having a strong, Sertorian presence on the board.<br/><br/>Spartacus requires the player to successfully exercise many facets of military-political acumen in order to defeat his opponent while preserving the most precious asset of all, survival.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": ["Compass Games English edition", "German First Edition"], "average": "6.70979", "name": "Spartacus", "playingtime": "300", "boardgamemechanic": ["Campaign / Battle Card Driven", "Point to Point Movement", "Simulation"], "age": "12", "usersrated": "143", "boardgamesubdomain": ["Wargames"], "boardgamefamily": ["Ancient Rome"], "boardgamepodcastepisode": ["AP Podcast \u2013 Episodio 12: Ascension Rise of Vigil"]}, "22378": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic360044.jpg", "poll": [], "boardgamedesigner": ["Ted Raicer"], "statistics": [], "yearpublished": "2007", "maxplayers": "2", "boardgameartist": ["Todd Davis"], "boardgamepublisher": ["Compass Games"], "maxplaytime": "480", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic360044_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "480", "boardgamecategory": ["Dice", "Fighting", "Wargame", "World War II"], "description": "(from Compass Games website):<br/><br/>Red Storm Over the Reich is a Ted Raicer game covering the epic final campaigns of WWII on the Eastern Front, as the forces of the Soviet Union smashed the German armies defending Poland, East Prussia, and Pomerania, and advanced across the Oder to Berlin. Included in the game are three scenarios.<br/><br/>The first scenario is historical, which finds the German forces out of position. Their armies will likely be shattered on the first turn, but the victory conditions are tough on the Soviets&ndash; they must do at least as well as historically.<br/><br/>Scenario two has the historic forces, but allows the Germans to implement Operation Sleigh-ride, a sane pull-back of the main defense line along the Vistula out of range of the opening Russian barrage (an operation historically nixed by Hitler) that at least allows for a more orderly flight.<br/><br/>Scenario three combines Sleigh-ride with reinforcements from other fronts. It assumes that Hitler has had an incapacitating stroke in late November or early December, and the new Nazi leadership is sufficiently uncertain of its position that it defers in military matters to Guderian. The Ardennes Offensive is cancelled, as are the attempts to relieve Budapest, as well as substantial forces are evacuated from the Courland pocket. This increases German strength on the main eastern front by approximately 50% and doubles German tank strength, which, when combined with Sleigh-ride gives the Germans some serious fighting strength.<br/> Scenarios one and two can be completed in 8-12 hours and scenario three in 12-16 hours, depending on your individual playing style.<br/><br/>Red Storm is the opposite of 1941 East Front Games: The Soviets have assembled a massive force and will rip gaping holes in the German lines through blitzkrieg-style attacks. The German player must somehow piece together a desperate defense only to have it repeatedly blown apart by the enemy. But time is the enemy of both players in this game. The Soviets need to accomplish their victory by the end of the last turn, satisfying the historical timeline, or they lose the game, and the Germans must delay the Soviet assault on Berlin long enough to prevent the Soviet win.<br/><br/>The rules for Red Storm Over the Reich are moderate in complexity but feature enough chrome for both sides to recreate this desperate campaign.

The bad guys actually are just decoration, as they all wait together in the &quot;hideout&quot;, which is part of the finish space.<br/><br/>Game play proceeds with each player spinning the spinner, advancing to the next space on single, linear path from start to finish that has the same color as the one just spun, and collecting either the pizza or weapon token found there.<br/><br/>The linear path is on a a nicely illustrated 15&quot; x 15&quot; board, with clearly labeled &quot;Start&quot; and &quot;Finish&quot; spaces.  There are 12 pizza spaces, 11 weapons spaces and two special &quot;Splinter&quot; spaces (Splinter is the benevolent rat master from the comics/tv/movies.)  The Splinter spaces allow for a &quot;redo&quot; if a player has yet to collect the needed tokens before advancing to the finish space.<br/><br/>In summary, a very, very simplistic roll-and-move style game for die-hard fans of the game.  The box states &quot;4 and up&quot;, but I imagine beyond 6 years a child would bore of the gameplay itself.

During the later stages of the Hittite Empire, circa 1400 BC to 1250 BC, the Hittite Empire had recovered from a period of weakness where it had been on constant warfare with the Arzawa and Mittani states. By 1290 BC the Hittites had managed to conquer Arzawa entirely and had captured the Mitanni capital, though elements of the Mittani people still resisted the further advances of the Hittites. Further, the Hittites had moved into the northern Palestinian region and had come to dominate Syria. This led to friction between the Hittites and the Egyptian, who themselves held large parts of Palestine and had ruled there for more than two centuries. Historically the showdown between these two powers culminated in the battle at Kadesh, initiated by Ramesses who had rallied Egyptian military might in order to directly challenge further Hittite expansion.<br/><br/>Ramesses' War is an easy to play two player game that lets you revisit that ancient conflict. However, the map provided expands the conflict to also encompass the various regional powers.

These pyramids touch each other at the tips in the very center of the board, and are angled in such a way that a hexagonal playing area is created. One player occupies the top 6 fields of each pyramid at the center of the board with 18 black pawns. The remaining pawns are placed on the two base-rows of each pyramid, 10 pawns in 3 colors, one color for each pyramid.<br/><br/>One player plays the beleaguered black pawns and tries to eliminate all other pieces. The remaining player(s) try to occupy one of the 3 center fields with a pawn in their color. The 3-player game is a bit contrived as one player will play 2 outer colors.<br/><br/>Pieces move like draught-pieces: they either move one space or capture a piece by hopping over it to a free field behind it. Pawns from the outer colors can only move or capture sideways or towards the board center (sideways to a neighboring pyramid is also possible). Outer pieces can capture only the black pawns with the same direction restrictions. The black pawns can capture any of the other colors in all directions. A player isn't obliged to capture.<br/><br/>In the opening move the outer colors start, opening with two different pawns per color, then the inner player moves one pawn from each pyramid. From then on, outer colors play one of their pawns in sequence, then the black player can play as many different black pawns as there are outer colors left in play, and these do no longer have to belong to different pyramids. If a player cannot move the turn moves on to the next player in line. Play continues until a victory condition is met.<br/><br/>Publication history: the game originally appeared in 1897 as Ravensburger Spiel Nr. 63 and made a bit of gaming history when it was released. Up until that point Otto Maier had been publishing only classic and widely known games as &quot;Chess&quot;, &quot;Halma&quot; and &quot;Reversi&quot;. This was the first time he published an original abstract boardgame through his now famous games imprint.<br/><br/>He quickly discovered all the obstacles to success that are still in force today: it is hard to market a game with rules that aren't commonly known, that has no promotional campaign to attract a critical mass of new players, and that has to be sold by salesmen who are unfamiliar with the game. Overall it became a learning experience, one that made him reflect a few years later when the game was withdrawn from sale after a single print-run: &quot;abstract boardgames are harder to market than those who are underpinned by fitting themes and illustrations&quot;. This realization might have been the beginning of the paste-on theme solution of which the German (and Euro) games are so often &quot;accused&quot;, but which does appear to have a function that is easily overlooked by the &quot;accusers&quot;. Themes draw buyers in, and rules are easier to explain when there is a story to tell, especially to younger players.<br/><br/>The original edition was issued in a remarkably lavish production (for that time in the German market) with great attention to detail. Even the board and box were covered with quality imitation-leather. It then disappeared until 1983, when it was reprinted by Spielbox magazine (1983/1, jan-mar) as the sixth game in their emerging &quot;Spiel zum Herausnehmen / Game to Remove&quot; series.<br/><br/>"}, "22468": {"boardgamedesigner": ["Peter Pallat"], "boardgamesubdomain": ["Abstract Games"], "poll": [], "name": "Perlen-Pyramide", "playingtime": "10", "minplayers": "3", "yearpublished": "1978", "usersrated": "2", "boardgamefamily": ["3D Games", "Marble Games"], "maxplayers": "3", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic117244_t.jpg", "average": "7", "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["ABRA", "Edition Perlhuhn (G\u00f6ttinger Spiele)"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic117244.jpg", "boardgameversion": ["ABRA German Wooden Edition"], "maxplaytime": "10", "boardgamecategory": ["Abstract Strategy"], "age": "10", "minplaytime": "10", "description": "&quot;Perlen-Pyramide&quot; or &quot;Pearl-Pyramid&quot;<br/><br/>Quick playing abstract pyramid stacking game for exactly 3 players. Each player uses a pool of 25 &quot;pearls&quot; in their color and placement starts on a 5x5 base grid, with pearls in subsequent layers being supported by four underneath.  A completed pyramid will thus contain exactly 55 pearl bricks.<br/><br/>Each player in turn will add exactly one piece to the construction, and the aim is to have the most external pearls visible in the completed pyramid. Players will be placing their pearls only onto the base of the pyramid, making sure all placed pearls touch what's already there (orthogonal or diagonally). Placement of pearls on the additional layers is triggered automatically by what is present underneath. The moment that a square group of four pearls is created in the same layer, a special &quot;filling&quot; placement interrupts the regular turn progression. To resolve which pearl gets placed on top of the four pearls underneath players need to look at how many different pearls are present. If one color is in the majority (3:1 or 2:1:1) then another pearl of that color gets placed on top. However, if two players each have two pearls  present than a pearl of the third player becomes the peak. If all four pearls are from a single player then the player who would have the turn after this colour's player gets to place the bonus pearl. When the bonus pearl itself triggers the completion of another group of four in the next layer then again bonus pearls are resolved before the normal turn-order is resumed. When the 25th base pearl is placed the completion of the pyramid is triggered and the game ends. The winner is the one with the most external pearls present.<br/><br/>Three variations are also included.<br/><br/>Publishing history: Peter Pallat was one of the original designer &quot;Altmeisters&quot; of the German game industry.  It was his designs that found their way into many family homes from way back in the 1930s, through Ravensburger, then known as Otto Maier Verlag, and others. He remained an active designer throughout his life, but his career went through a renaissance when, in his older days, he found a welcome and supportive group of younger designers and admirers, who, in their turn, had become torch-bearers of German game design. One of these, Reinhold Wittig, published a handful of Peter Pallat's games and ideas in small editions through his own Edition Perlhuhn designers imprint, giving him the recognition for his longstanding input into our hobby he fully deserved. These games later found their way to publishers like Abacus and the Danish Abra who released wooden versions of some of these. As did this game. &quot;Perlen-Pyramide&quot; appeared with Edition Perlhuhn in 1978 and was republished by the Danish Abra as part of their abstract wooden game series of the latter part of the 1980s. It is hard to get hold of these days.<br/><br/>"}, "22469": {"boardgamedesigner": ["(Uncredited)", "Daniel Mandel"], "poll": [], "name": "Avatar: The Last Airbender Trading Card Game", "playingtime": "15", "minplayers": "2", "yearpublished": "2006", "usersrated": "45", "boardgamefamily": ["Admin: Better Description Needed!", "Anime & Manga", "CCGs (Collectible Card Games)", "QuickStrike"], "maxplayers": "2", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic122289_t.jpg", "average": "5.52778", "statistics": [], "boardgamesubdomain": ["Customizable Games"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic122289.jpg", "boardgameversion": ["English first edition", "German first edition"], "maxplaytime": "15", "boardgamepublisher": ["Upper Deck Entertainment"], "boardgamecategory": ["Card Game", "Collectible Components", "Movies / TV / Radio theme"], "age": "0", "minplaytime": "15", "description": "Nickelodeon's hit animated series is coming to the world of gaming thanks to Upper Deck Entertainment.

Frederick's gamble nearly destroyed Prussia, but a few stunning victories over numerically superior forces, many delaying actions, British gold, and the timely death of Tsarina Elizabeth of Russia saved Prussia and ensured Frederick's place in history as a great general.<br/><br/>Prussia's Defiant Stand recreates the fierce struggle for mastery of Central Europe. Using the well-proven, card-driven action system the game showcases the importance of maneuver, fortresses, sieges, supply, and the potentially costly option of winter campaigning. The countries of Prussia, Austria, France, Russia, and Sweden are represented with units for leaders and artillery, heavy and light infantry, cavalry, Cossacks, and fortresses.<br/><br/>Players will have difficult choices in managing their cards as some can be used for &quot;commands&quot; to move units, or used to modify combat odds.  The game mechanics reflect the period's focus on maneuver for position and a &quot;Frictions of War&quot; table beautifully models the indecisiveness of many allied leaders.  This explains more than anything how the small nation of Prussia was able to withstand the combined weight of the most powerful states of the day.  Frederick himself attributed Prussia's survival more to the timidity of allied commanders than to his own actions.<br/><br/>This game is available now at <a target='_blank' href='http://www.worthingtongames.com' rel='nofollow'>www.worthingtongames.com</a><br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": ["First Edition"], "average": "6.89545", "name": "Prussia's Defiant Stand", "playingtime": "180", "boardgamemechanic": ["Dice Rolling", "Secret Unit Deployment", "Simultaneous Action Selection"], "age": "0", "usersrated": "132", "boardgamesubdomain": ["Wargames"], "boardgamefamily": ["Age of Kings", "Block wargames"]}, "22473": {"boardgamedesigner": ["(Uncredited)"], "poll": [], "name": "Triple Play Baseball", "playingtime": "60", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": ["Dice Rolling"], "yearpublished": "1991", "usersrated": "4", "boardgamefamily": ["Sports: Baseball"], "maxplayers": "2", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1251772_t.jpg", "average": "6.625", "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["TP Baseball"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1251772.jpg", "boardgameversion": ["TP Baseball First Edition"], "maxplaytime": "60", "boardgamecategory": ["Sports"], "age": "0", "minplaytime": "60", "description": "TP Baseball gives you the opportunity to step into the shoes of your favorite team's manager and general manager and guide your team into the post-season and beyond.

There are symbols on each hex that makes up the piece (sometimes identical symbols). The pieces are drawn randomly in the game. Each player receives six pieces to start the game, which are placed onto a rack and visible to them alone.<br/><br/>The goal of the game is, through clever placement, to obtain points in the different symbol colours. Points are claimed by placing a piece into any open space such that the symbols on it lie next to already-placed pieces with the same symbol. So, for example, if a player places a piece with a purple circle on it such that it sits next to an unbroken line of four other purple circles already on the board, then the player scores four purple points. A newly placed symbol can lie next to at most five individual rows of symbols.<br/><br/>Each player uses a scoring track to keep track of his points &ndash; one track for each colour going from 0 to 18.

It has retained its unique rules ever since, and presently has its own league, founded in 1932, and is still widely played in its natural home of Friesland. Friesland is (currently) a province with its own language and culture in the north of the Netherlands.<br/><br/>The &quot;normal&quot; version of draughts only slowly made its way into Friesland, and is known there as &quot;Oer Hoek&quot; (over corners) or &quot;Holl&acirc;nsk damjen/Hollands dammen&quot;. These days you are more likely to hear people talk about &quot;Frysk Damjen&quot; than &quot;Oer Alles&quot;.<br/><br/>The set-up and basic movement is identical to the commonly known game, but it won't be long before the main difference will become very apparent: capturing isn't restricted to just diagonal jumps, but can be executed horizontally and vertically as well. Yes, a piece can capture in all 8 directions! If you think that makes it easier to solve, try it. It has a lot more action but it doesn't become easier.<br/><br/>There are other subtle variations:<br/>A promoted King can be moved only three times in succession when a player still has normal pieces. After that it must be &quot;released&quot; by a capture (which can be made with the same king) or by moving another piece. When a player has nothing but Kings then this rule is ignored. When you can capture, you must, but if a King and a standard piece can both capture a stone, or stones, of equal value, then it is the King that has to make the capture. When there are multiple capturing opportunities of equal value than the one that includes most Kings must be taken. The moment a player obtains a second King (and his opponent has only one), than that player has seven moves to finish the match or it automatically becomes a draw. Kings can make long jumps.<br/><br/>A few more names:<br/>The Frisians are still proud sailors and it should come as no surprise that there are more pockets along the North Sea and Baltic Sea that play the game, where it is known under many names that all refer to the erstwhile important Frisian harbour village of Molkwar/Molkwerum, famous in Holland for its ad-hoc infrastructure. Early Dutch literature (mockingly) refers to Frisian draughts with its free-form any-direction capturing as &quot;Molkwerums dammen&quot; as an homage to the labyrinthine village.<br/>&quot;Molkwerums dammen&quot; (Dutch). A similar game is &quot;Makv&aelig;r&quot; (Danish) or &quot;Marquern&quot; (Swedish), however, it is played on an 8x8 board and, in Makv&aelig;r, a King doesn't only move diagonally, but also orthogonally, that is in 8 directions.<br/><br/>And more still:<br/>&quot;Jeu du Dame Bablionique&quot; (French), &quot;Babylonian Draughts&quot; (English)<br/><br/>There is even a game played in Siberia that follows very similar rules to Frisian Draughts, except that it is played on a 64 field chess board.<br/><br/>"}, "22494": {"boardgamedesigner": ["Christian Raffeiner", "Helmut Walch"], "poll": [], "name": "Vega", "playingtime": "20", "minplayers": "1", "boardgamemechanic": ["Area Movement"], "yearpublished": "1993", "usersrated": "3", "boardgamesubdomain": ["Abstract Games"], "maxplayers": "4", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic301345_t.jpg", "average": "5", "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["Peri Spiele"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic301345.jpg", "boardgameversion": ["Peri German first edition"], "maxplaytime": "20", "boardgamecategory": ["Abstract Strategy"], "age": "6", "minplaytime": "20", "description": "Vega (for Children from 6 up and grown-ups) has a hexagonal board  of 54 triangles.
