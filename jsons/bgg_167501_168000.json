For that, he or she builds and sails a fleet of both fishing boats and war galleons, by cleverly using the resources received in the beginning of each play: winds and coins. In addition, each almirante has three opportunities to use a god card.<br/><br/>Each play starts by receiving 6 winds and a variable amount of coins. Winds allow you to move your vessels: you need 1 wind to sail a fishing boat to another field, and 2 winds to do the same with a heavier galleon. Coins allow you to build new vessels: fishing boats cost you 2 coins, while galleons cost you 8 coins. You can trade these two resources, if you are willing to pay a conversion fee.<br/><br/>You then move your vessels. Sail your fishing boats to the shoal fields to fish and earn coins on your next turns (2 coins per each of the 6 shoals players compete for). Sail your galleons to meet opponent vessels in order to fight battles, or go for the center to conquer it. Battles are always won by the almirante with the most galleons on that field. Some defeated vessels are sunk and some of them may flee.<br/><br/>If the time is right, call upon the gods!

Beginning in Boston, the conflict eventually stretched from Canada in the north to Florida in the south and lasted eight grueling years. On one side stood the King's redcoats and settlers loyal to their sovereign, later joined by regiments of 'Hessian' mercenaries. Ranged against them was a citizen army under the inspirational leadership of George Washington, supported by militia and eventually French troops eager to embarrass their old foe. Both sides were forced to learn new tactics for fighting in the wild terrain of North America in a conflict that saw heroism and ineptitude in equal measure. This supplement for Black Powder describes the history, armies, personalities and battles of this conflict. Included are scenarios allowing you to recreate many of the battles of the rebellion.

Only energy charged Frankies can score in the game.<br/>Not every Franky is the same, the risky &rsquo;small&rsquo; red Frankies can win the most victory points ..<br/><br/>excerpt of the official rules: <br/>The object of the game is to win 12 victory points or more. The highest number of victory points wins the game. In case of a tie of victory points a flash-duel (between the affected players) takes place in a special round. Note: Victory point is a funny reference to the fictional character Victor Frankenstein.<br/>How to play: Each game round the player has a regular dice turn with multiple number of rolls. After each roll, any number of dice can be laid aside, but at least 1 die is always required! Dice which are laid aside cannot be re-rolled in this round. At the end of the regular dice turn (all dice are laid aside) the result is evaluated. A lightning flash symbolizes a victory point, but only if the player can assemble a complete Franky in a same color (2 other dice in green or according violet). A green or violet Franky is always assembled with a head and a body.<br/>Note: If you want to achieve a regular victory point this way, always 3 dice are necessary.<br/>Red Frankies: After the player has completed his regular dice turn (all dice are laid aside), all red Frankies are rolled once again. Here the player has gained special chances with these dice. A red Franky can immediately achieve victory points if he shows a flash after the rolling (the red Franky has been activated). Here no assembly with other dice is required because the red Franky is already complete (custom-made). Displays the die (after the roll) again a red Franky, he will be re-rolled again, all other symbols do not help anymore.<br/>Note: If the player wins victory points this way, only 1 single die is necessary. Depending on how many red Frankies the player has laid aside, a lot of victory points can be earned.<br/><br/>excerpt of the official rules Blue Eyes (included first expansion): <br/>The player can try to score victory points as usual. If he plays a total of victory points that is similar with the number the blue spot die shows, the victory points can be doubled. Note: The player can decide to devaluate any number of victory points to fulfill the spot die (only<br/>complete activated Frankies can be devaluated).<br/><br/><br/>            <br/>        <br/>    <br/><br/><br/>Franky ist zur&uuml;ck!<br/>Im geheimen Labor versuchen die Spieler m&ouml;glichst viele Frankys zusammenzubauen und diese dann mit Energieblitzen zu aktivieren. Nur energiegeladene Frankys k&ouml;nnen im Spiel punkten. <br/>Nicht jeder Franky ist gleich, die riskanten &bdquo;kleinen&rdquo; roten Frankys k&ouml;nnen die meisten Siegpunkte erspielen ..<br/><br/>Auszug des offiziellen Regelwerks:<br/>Spielziel sind 12 Siegpunkte oder mehr. Die h&ouml;chste Anzahl an Siegpunkten gewinnt das Spiel. Bei Gleichstand von Siegpunkten wird ein Blitz-Duell in einer Sonderrunde ausgetragen.<br/>Spiel&uuml;berblick: Pro Spielrunde hat der Spieler einen regul&auml;ren W&uuml;rfeldurchgang mit mehreren W&uuml;rfen. Nach jedem Wurf k&ouml;nnen beliebig viele W&uuml;rfel rausgelegt werden, mindestens 1 W&uuml;rfel ist aber immer Pflicht! Rausgelegte W&uuml;rfel k&ouml;nnen in dieser Runde nicht wieder neu mitgew&uuml;rfelt werden. Erst am Ende des regul&auml;ren W&uuml;rfeldurchgangs (alle W&uuml;rfel sind rausgelegt) wird das Ergebnis gewertet. Ein Energieblitz bedeutet einen Siegpunkt, welcher aber erst durch den Zusammenbau von einem Franky in einer gleichen Farbe (2 andere W&uuml;rfel in gr&uuml;n oder entsprechend violett) gewertet werden kann. Ein gr&uuml;ner oder violetter Franky wird immer zusammengebaut mit Kopf und Rumpf.<br/>Hinweis: Soll auf diese Weise ein regul&auml;rer Siegpunkt erzielt werden, sind daf&uuml;r immer 3 W&uuml;rfel notwendig.<br/>Rote Frankys: Nachdem der Spieler seinen regul&auml;ren W&uuml;rfeldurchgang abgeschlossen hat (alle W&uuml;rfel sind rausgelegt), werden alle roten Frankys einmalig erneut gew&uuml;rfelt; der Spieler hat sich bei diesen W&uuml;rfeln Sonderchancen erspielt. Ein roter Franky kann sofort Siegpunkte erzielen, wenn er jetzt nach dem w&uuml;rfeln einen Energieblitz zeigt (der rote Franky wurde aktiviert). Hier ist kein Zusammenbau mit anderen W&uuml;rfeln erforderlich, da die roten Frankys schon komplett sind (Sonderanfertigungen). Zeigt der W&uuml;rfel (nach dem w&uuml;rfeln) erneut einen roten Franky, wird dieser als Wiederholung erneut gew&uuml;rfelt, alle anderen Symbole bringen nichts mehr.<br/>Hinweis: Sollen also so Siegpunkte erspielt werden, ist hierf&uuml;r nur 1 einziger W&uuml;rfel notwendig. Auf diese Weise k&ouml;nnen beliebig viele Siegpunkte erspielt werden, je nachdem wie viele rote Frankys der Spieler rausgelegt hat.<br/><br/>Auszug des offiziellen Regelwerks Blue Eyes (enthaltene erste Erweiterung):<br/>Der Spieler kann ganz normal auf Siegpunkte spielen.

Some Pathfinder products have explored the idea of alien life in the past, and space ships and ray-guns have had their place in fantasy roleplaying games nearly from the beginning. This book, however, is devoted entirely to populating the stars with strange, terrible, and fascinating alien races of every sort, who can serve to breathe life into your game.

The terrani (CR 1), a race of insectoid aliens driven into frenzy by hunger and lacking higher intelligence, are largely harmless when encountered individually, but if allowed to form into terrible terrani broods (CR 8) they can become a serious threat. The phase slime (CR 15) on the other hand is a bizarre phenomenon, whose body actually serves as a gateway to another dimension.

The German plays a unit; the English answers with a unit, that must have a Combat value equal or higher than the German unit's, or reach it thanks to boosts. If it does, the German can boost his unit, then the English, and so on until a player stops. A unit's combat value can be raised by combat action cards and tokens (one side +1 Combat, one blank side) taken from the player's tokens reserve and flipped.<br/>If the English's unit is destroyed, he loses one of his 3 Manpower Points (MP) but moves to the next ground (the assault ends, as does the turn on this ground). If the German's unit is destroyed, he can play another one (depending on the ground's size) and the assault goes on. If the English destroys all enemy units present on the ground, he wins the assault and progresses without losing a MP.<br/><br/>Players also have a pool of special cards, the powerful &quot;heroic&quot; cards, from which they secretely choose one card to add to their hand each two turns. Since heroic cards have potent effects and can't be countered, choosing them well depending on the situation of the game is strategically very important. These cards feature actual historical officers and events.<br/><br/>The game contains three scenarios, each of which corresponding to one of the three missions that the English commandos had to fulfill this night: the taking of the bridge of B&eacute;nouville (&quot;Pegasus Bridge&quot;) to allow the landed troops to progress deeper inside the land; the assault on the Merville Gun Battery, a fortified area threatening the Landind beaches with long distance cannons; and the bombing of the bridges on the Dives river to prevent the tanks of the 21th Panzer Division from reinforcing the German troops. Each scenario has its own pool of cards (including heroic cards) and different gameplays.<br/><br/>To win, the English must fulfill his objective (which depends of the scenario), by winning the assault on one or more objective grounds. To win, the German has to prevent the English to reach his goal, generally by bringing his Manpower Points to zero or, in the Dives scenario, by preventing him to destroy two bridges out of four.<br/><br/>The three scenarios can be played in campaign mode (one after the other) to recreate the historic night. Depending on his results, the English gets more or less campaign points, and when the three scenarios have been played, his total score indicates if the D-Day Landing will be possible or not.<br/><br/>The 120 artworks illustrating the cards are realistic and faithful to historical documents (uniforms, weapons, locations...)<br/><br/>---<br/><br/>En 1944, pendant la nuit du 5 au 6 juin, les parachutistes de la 6e Division A&eacute;roport&eacute;e Britannique (&quot;6th Airborne&quot;) accomplirent trois missions h&eacute;ro&iuml;ques qui permirent au D&eacute;barquement d'avoir lieu sur le secteur est (plages Gold, Juno et Sword).<br/>Dans **Op&eacute;ration Commando - Pegasus Bridge**, l'un des joueurs dirige les commandos anglais, et son adversaire les troupes allemandes.<br/><br/>&Agrave; chaque tour, sur un champ de bataille diff&eacute;rent (chaque terrain poss&eacute;dant des caract&eacute;ristiques sp&eacute;cifiques), les joueurs piochent des cartes (chacun a sa propre pioche), peuvent jouer des &eacute;v&eacute;nements, puis un assaut commence. L'Allemand joue une unit&eacute; ; l'Anglais r&eacute;pond par une unit&eacute;, qui doit avoir une valeur de combat &eacute;gale ou sup&eacute;rieure &agrave; celle de l'unit&eacute; allemande, ou l'atteindre gr&acirc;ce &agrave; des bonus. Si c'est le cas, l'Allemand peut renforcer son unit&eacute;, puis l'Anglais peut faire de m&ecirc;me, et ainsi de suite jusqu'&agrave; ce qu'un joueur renonce. La valeur de combat d'une unit&eacute; peut &ecirc;tre augment&eacute;e gr&acirc;ce &agrave; des actions de combat et des jetons (avec une face +1 et une face sans bonus) pris dans la r&eacute;serve du joueur et jet&eacute;s en l'air comme un pile ou face.<br/>Si l'unit&eacute; de l'Anglais est d&eacute;truite, il perd l'un de ses 3 Points d'Effectifs (PE) mais avance jusqu'au prochain terrain (l'assaut se termine, de m&ecirc;me que le tour sur ce terrain). Si c'est l'unit&eacute; de l'Allemand qui est d&eacute;truite, ce dernier peut en jouer une autre (selon la taille du terrain) et l'assaut se poursuit. Si l'Anglais &eacute;limine toutes les unit&eacute;s ennemies pr&eacute;sentes, il remporte l'assaut et progresse sans perdre de PE.<br/><br/>Les joueurs disposent &eacute;galement d'une r&eacute;serve de cartes sp&eacute;ciales, les puissantes cartes &quot;h&eacute;ro&iuml;ques&quot;, r&eacute;serve dans laquelle ils choisissent secr&egrave;tement une carte qu'ils ajoutent &agrave; leur main tous les deux tours. Les cartes h&eacute;ro&iuml;ques ayant des effets puissants et ne pouvant &ecirc;tre annul&eacute;es, bien les choisir en fonction du d&eacute;roulement de la partie est strat&eacute;giquement tr&egrave;s important. Ces cartes repr&eacute;sentent des officiers ayant r&eacute;ellement pris part aux op&eacute;rations et des &eacute;v&eacute;nements s'&eacute;tant effectivement produits.<br/><br/>Le jeu propose trois sc&eacute;narios, chacun d'eux correspondant &agrave; l'une des trois missions que les commandos anglais devaient accomplir cette nuit-l&agrave; : la prise du pont de B&eacute;nouville (&quot;Pegasus Bridge&quot;) pour permettre aux troupes d&eacute;barqu&eacute;es de progresser &agrave; l'int&eacute;rieur des terres ; l'assaut sur la batterie de Merville, une zone fortifi&eacute;e mena&ccedil;ant les plages du D&eacute;barquement avec des canons &agrave; longue port&eacute;e ; et la destruction des ponts sur la rivi&egrave;re Dives pour emp&ecirc;cher les blind&eacute;s de la 21e Panzer Division de venir renforcer les troupes allemandes. Chaque sc&eacute;nario poss&egrave;de ses propres cartes (dont les cartes h&eacute;ro&iuml;ques) et des m&eacute;caniques de jeu diff&eacute;rentes.<br/><br/>Pour gagner, l'Anglais doit remplir sa mission (qui d&eacute;pend du sc&eacute;nario), en remportant l'assaut sur un ou plusieurs terrains objectifs. Pour gagner, l'Allemand doit emp&ecirc;cher l'Anglais d'atteindre son but, g&eacute;n&eacute;ralement en lui faisant perdre tous ses Points d'Effectifs, ou, dans le sc&eacute;nario de la Dives, en l'emp&ecirc;chant de d&eacute;truire deux des quatre ponts.<br/><br/>Les trois sc&eacute;narios peuvent &ecirc;tre jou&eacute;s &agrave; la suite, en mode &quot;campagne&quot;, pour recr&eacute;er cette nuit historique. En fonction de ses r&eacute;sultats, l'Anglais obtient plus ou moins de points de campagne, et quand les trois sc&eacute;narios ont &eacute;t&eacute; jou&eacute;s, son score total indique si le D&eacute;barquement sur les plages de Gold, Juno et Sword pourra avoir lieu ou non.<br/><br/>Les 120 illustrations de cartes sont r&eacute;alistes et fid&egrave;les aux documents historiques (uniformes, armes, lieux...)<br/><br/>"}, "167976": {"poll": {}, "name": "Malifaux: Arsenal Box \u2013 Outcasts (Wave 1)", "playingtime": "0", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": {"2018": "Campaign / Battle Card Driven"}, "yearpublished": "2013", "boardgameexpansion": {}, "usersrated": "4", "maxplayers": "10", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2289525_t.png", "average": "7", "statistics": {}, "boardgamepublisher": {"10053": {"name": "Wyrd Miniatures"}}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2289525.png", "boardgameversion": {"256953": "First edition"}, "maxplaytime": "0", "boardgamecategory": {"1042": {"name": "Expansion for Base-game"}}, "expands": {"147537": {"name": "Malifaux (second edition)"}}, "age": "0", "minplaytime": "0", "description": "We're entering a new world of hurt and this box contains all the guns, swords , and brutality you will need for you to survive your next fight.

A great winter has descended upon the land, the sun has disappeared, the sea has frozen over, there's no more crops or cattle and all you have left is a few winter stores and, of course, your fluid Viking sense of ownership.<br/><br/>In Ragnaroll, you control a band of Viking warriors, each represented by a custom die, struggling to survive. Your band consists of a unique hero, 2 soldiers, 1 shieldmaiden and a loyal, but slightly unreliable, dog. You'll need to fight to protect your precious food stores, as well as raid your opponents for glory and more food. It's a harsh winter wasteland, and the last Viking alive wins, unless of course Ragnaroll happens first.<br/><br/>A round of Ragnaroll starts by revealing an event card, which will provide some incentives and rewards for your Vikings to leave their comfy halls. Next, players secretly separate their warriors into their defenders and their raiders. Players reveal their selection simultaneously and the boldest and bravest player, the one with the smallest raiding party, seizes the Initiative, gaining control of raid order for the round. If there's any ties, you'll need to literally seize the initiative by grabbing the initiative token from the centre of the table.<br/><br/>In the order of the Initiative holders choice, each player conducts a little bit of Norse business, pitting your raiders against your opponents defenders and using your defenders to protect your stores from your enemy&rsquo;s raiders. Battle is resolved through rolling dice and using special battle abilities fuelled by glory. Each hero has a unique set of powers that will enable them to turn luck into fate. Each player, starting with the raider, will use a battle ability, and then the winner will be determined. Whoever has the most axes win, but you'll be able to block axes with shields and appeal to Odin to reroll results. The winner of the battle will get to steal stores or slay his opponent's warriors, but each player will also gain glory. In addition to glory provided through the event for the round, every hero has a different path to glory, some will delight in crushing their enemies, while others will be satisfied with survival and some may even gain glory through defeat.<br/><br/>After all players have raided, they will return to their falls and feed their warriors, but with stores running low, not all mouths are worth feeding. You can send any of your Vikings out into the snow for a long walk, saving precious resources, and if you get really desperate, you can even eat the dog. After you&rsquo;ve fed, you&rsquo;ll draw a new event card and start all over again. The game will end in one of 3 ways, each of which show the gods that one band of warriors is fit to fight alongside them in Ragnaroll. When there&rsquo;s only one player with Vikings left, that player wins, demonstrating they have the strength and cunning to fight with the gods, but if all players run out of stores at the same time, you will all conduct one last glorious battle and the player with the most axes will emerge victorious. However, if any player is able to demonstrate they are truly worthy of the god&rsquo;s favour by gaining 15 glory, they will immediately win and take their rightful place in Valhalla.<br/><br/>Ragnarol is a game where your choices matter. You&rsquo;ll need to balance risk and rewards, and manage your precious, dwindling resources, making hard decisions for the survival of your clan. The dice-based combat doesn&rsquo;t simply mean that your fate into the hands of the gods, as you&rsquo;ll be able to influence the outcome of the battle using your glory-fueled powers, but you&rsquo;ll need to choose the battles that are worth the cost.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "3", "boardgameversion": {"256026": "First edition"}, "age": "14", "name": "Ragnaroll", "playingtime": "45", "boardgamemechanic": {"2072": "Dice Rolling"}, "average": "6.16667", "usersrated": "6", "boardgamefamily": {"22184": "Admin: Unreleased Games"}}, "167507": {"statistics": {}, "name": "Double Dragon Trilogy", "videogamemode": {"2313": "Cooperative"}, "videogameversion": {"256033": "iOS Edition"}, "average": "0", "videogameseries": {"4939": "Double Dragon"}, "videogametheme": {"2493": "Martial Arts"}, "usersrated": "0", "videogamegenre": {"2342": "Beat 'em Up"}, "videogameplatform": {"6826": "iPad"}, "poll": {}, "videogamecompilation": {"69165": "Double Dragon (1987)"}, "description": "User Summary<br/><br/>A groundbreaking, uber-popular game upon its arcade debut in 1987, Double Dragon is the undisputed godfather of co-op beat &lsquo;em all!<br/><br/>Enter Double Dragon Trilogy, a compilation specially optimized for mobiles and which includes all three installments of the beloved arcade series: Double Dragon, Double Dragon 2: The Revenge, and Double Dragon 3: The Rosetta Stone.

A knight can't enter a lake (blub), a mountain with an opposing pawn, or any space with an opponent's city or stronghold or two knights of the same opposing color.

The world as we knew it has gone. Those that survived are split into various &lsquo;factions&rsquo; (or proto-nations).

Progress is measured in terms of social development levels and the emergence of new cities. The higher the Development Level the higher the value of each zone and thus victory points, but watch out for the 'catastrophes'.<br/><br/>New Earth is a strategy game for 2-4 players with elegant game mechanics combining worker placement with innovative hand management and modular tile design that provides endless game scenarios.

The goal is to conquer all of the WordLand using an army assembled in the game.  The heart of the game is based around collecting resources.  Such resources are collected by making words from a 6x6 grid of letters.  The letters are on tiles made of stone, wood, meat, or gold.  Unlike other words games, letters do not have to be touching in order to be made into words.  Every word made gives the player resources based on what resource tiles the letters were on.  There are also special words that when spelled give bonuses to certain resources.  Longer words also create larger resource bonuses - but there is a word limit.<br/><br/>Players use resources to build up their kingdom.  Players can build a castle, market, mage guild, barracks and a number of other buildings.  Each building made gives the players new abilities.  The barracks, for instance, gives several different types of soldiers.  But, as with the buildings, these soldiers need resources in order to be trained.<br/><br/>In later levels, while the player is finding words and collecting resources, a battle rages at the top of the screen, where various enemy armies are trying to storm your castle to defeat you.

It takes a subtly different approach to the published systems devised for T\u00e9kumel (Empire of the Petal Throne, Swords & Glory, Gard\u00e1siyal, and Tekumel RPG). It eschews most of the common mechanics of role-playing a persona within one of the Five Empires &mdash; in favor of a cinematic and social network focused system. The goal of this is to shift focus away from learning mechanical minutiae and towards empowering new players (especially those with no exposure to T\u00e9kumel and its cultural background) to quickly and easily assimilate into the mindset of Tekumelani cultures. It also seeks to dispel some of the folklore about the difficulty of role-playing on T\u00e9kumel - folklore unfortunately rooted in some of the complexities of previous role-playing rules and a certain overweening &quot;Otherness&quot; fostered by random exposure to Tekumelani history and socio-cultural details which overemphasize the uniqueness of the environment. We think this is somewhat misplaced. There are simple and obvious correlates to almost all of the institutions and practices and histories one encounters in reading the Deeds of the Ever glorious in the Chancery of Avanthar &mdash; or in the secret histories compiled by the great and noble clans and the ruling Tlakotani royal house. This guide takes an in media res approach to role-playing &mdash; trying to throw the player (and his/her persona) into the rich cultural and political backdrop of Tekumel. The technique makes players important personages with high profiles within their respective social groups. There are no &quot;Barbarians landing in a boat at Jakalla&quot; assumptions and the express purpose of this minimal rule set is to create powerful, dynamic, and resourceful personas. They should be able to start adventuring and intriguing within the highest circles of the Five Empires dominating T\u00e9kumel in its mysterious pocket dimension.<br/><br/>from Historical Background and Setting:<br/>This rule set is not designed for generation of low power, weak, and low status individuals &mdash; but rather to help support the elite of Tekumelani societies to achieve the true measure of their potential and to take their positions at the head of their respective social groups.<br/><br/>from Creating a High-Level Tekumelani Personality:<br/>The role-playing system presented tries hard to eschew mechanical details and focus the majority of action on dramatic (cinematic) resolution. Die rolling is to be discouraged except for truly dramatic situations &mdash; in the normal course of gaming the players are taking on the roles important personages within the Empire. They are not the Chri-flies common to previous systems &mdash; where slow, laborious advancement was the expected and normal course. You are one of the beautiful people &mdash; looking down from your colonnaded balcony as the unwashed cluster in their rundown clan houses near the wharves &mdash; consorting with foreign rabble and lucky not to be swept up in a general Ditlana of the slums the priests have been pressing for.<br/><br/>from The Core Persona Aptitude and Skills:<br/>All personas in T\u00e9kumel role-playing share a fundamental core of socially manifested skills or aptitudes which are useful in defining them for players as well as for allowing the GM to arbitrate conflicts, actions, etc. in the normal course of play. Unique to this rule set, the majority of core components are abstract and social in nature. Gone are the classical prime requisites of Dungeons & Dragons&trade; and mostly quantitative attributes of Tekumelani RPG systems of the past. They just are not that useful in the high stakes political and social intrigues that players of this system will likely find themselves involved with under normal circumstances. We have found that the minimal aptitudes required for creating dramatic action resolution revolve mostly around the ability to persuade, seduce, violate, discern and improvise.<br/><br/>"}, "167636":

What they do not have in abundance is time.  The island and its vital airfields must be conquered quickly to allow the 77th Infantry Division to be transferred to Okinawa as soon as possible.  Even so the American side must achieve its mission with no more than a modest number of casualties otherwise the 77th will be in no condition to relieve the 96th Infantry Division on Okinawa as it did historically.  An economy of force approach must be adopted and assets such as air power, armor, artillery, and the American Navy all used to maximum efficiency.<br/><br/>The Japanese player has a mixed bag of forces ranging from regular army units to airfield construction personnel to island civilians.  Defeating the invasion at the landing beaches isn&rsquo;t the goal so much as making the invaders pay as high a price as possible.  With this in mind the Japanese player must focus their defense on the best terrain&mdash;primarily Mount Gusuku and the urban areas adjacent to it&mdash;but always be on the lookout for opportunities to upset the American timetable with judicious placement of machine gun nests and pockets of civilian resistance behind American lines.  The island&rsquo;s artillery possesses the capability to inflict attritional losses on the invaders, and the threat of a kamikaze attack on the 5th Fleet is something the American player must account for.  The arrival of night each turn opens the door for small Japanese assaults which, along with satchel charges, might produce a local victory as happened historically at Bloody Ridge, or at the very least see the American player surrendering control of the advantage marker to demand a reroll.  Changes in the weather are random, but the arrival of rain benefits the Japanese side, as does the appearance of rubble in urban areas.<br/><br/>An optional rule allows players to experience the uplifting presence of Ernie Pyle being close to the front and the leadership provided by Major Igawa personally joining the combat, though at the risk of seeing these historical figures killed in action.<br/><br/>"}, "167651": {"rpgitemversion": {"256384": "PDF Version"}, "poll": {}, "name": "Engines & Dragons", "rpgproducer": {"3": "(Uncredited)"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2272978.png", "usersrated": "1", "average": "5", "statistics": {}, "rpg": {"518": "Deadlands: Reloaded"}, "rpgcategory": {"2084": "Scenario / Adventure / Module"}, "rpggenre": {"181": "History (American West)"}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2272978_t.png", "description": "website blurb:<br/>The posses stage coach is attacked by a gang who have literally lost there way.

Vornheim needs little alteration as a city kit for use in a fantasy setting, but science fiction is a whole different ball game. My sci-fi games frequently are set in the Firefly Universe created by Joss Whedon (I won't gush on why I love the setting so much) and I knew I wanted to hack Vornheim to be an aid for me while running the game.<br/><br/>Truth be told, I created this hack for myself, as an aid for quick and easy game running, but put so much damned work into it that I wanted to share it with others. There are ideas, suggestions, etc in these charts and tables that are very specific to the Firefly universe, but file the numbers off and they will easily fit a different sci-fi setting, others are not so specific.<br/><br/>Feel free to use these tables as you see fit! Keep with the philosophy outlined in the Vornheim book and have a great time enjoying this awesome hobby!<br/><br/>So grab some friends, grab some dice, and keep rolling!<br/><br/>"}, "167660": {"rpgitemversion": {"256407": "PDF Version 2.0"}, "statistics": {}, "name": "The Savage World of Shadowrun", "rpgproducer": {"41390": "Mike Evans"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2271674.png", "usersrated": "0", "rpgsetting": {"23676": "The Sixth World"}, "average": "0", "rpggenre": {"848": "Fantasy (Modern Urban Fantasy)"}, "rpg": {"286": "Savage Worlds"}, "rpgcategory": {"2107": "Campaign Setting (game world)"}, "poll": {}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2271674_t.png", "description": "From the Introduction:<br/><br/>I wanted to do a Shadowrun conversion to one of my favorite systems just for the hell of it!

What sets TOI apart from other games, is the unique gameplay and turn based mechanics. One of our main sources of inspiration when we designed the game was Oregon Trail. Like Oregon Trail, you are on an epic journey, and you must manage all aspects of your party, right down to the supplies you carry.<br/><br/>Your party is subject to all the dangers of pre-modern era travel. The weather, disease, access to food and water, and bandits provide a constant threat to your party and mission. As the party travels, seasons change and so does the world around you.<br/><br/>The game uses a unique Dungeon Master system to spawn events while your party travels or visits locations. During events, the player is given options on how to proceed, and can meet with varying degrees of success and failure depending on their skill levels. Time is never dull with Illyria, and there&rsquo;s plenty of replayability because there will always be unique events that you never experienced during your first playthrough.<br/><br/>We have developed a very unique order based combat system that plays out in realtime. Every member of your party and of the opposing party, takes a turn attacking, casting a spell or using an item.

A player controls at least one but can control up to three armies per game. You can use the board sections to create inlets, peninsulas, isthmuses, lakes, and more. Adding vortex and terrain markers allows you even more control over the layout of the game board and how it will be traversed. Your ability to take advantage of the layout of the battlefield is crucial to victory and defeat.<br/><br/>Each army is made up of 12 Army Units, one General, and one Supply Pawn. At the start of your turn, you must decide if you are going for supplies or moving your army.  On taking possession of the dice: first see if any of your Army Units are in danger and if so, respond defensively; second, see if any of your opponent's Army Units are vulnerable and, if possible, attack; third, if neither of these choices applies, go for supplies. Sun Tzu says: &quot;Do not move without considering all the possibilities. Move always with a clear purpose.&quot;<br/><br/>The rules for movement of your army allow you to simulate many strategies from the ancient battlefield. Even &ldquo;cavalry charges&rdquo; are possible&mdash;where a unit dashes across the board to attack an enemy position. Your mission is to surround and eliminate enemy Army Units until only your Army is left, leaving you the victor.<br/>Deals and alliances can be made in the open or in secret.

Players choose a Talk Card from their hand which they feel best represents the picture, is the most silly, or drums up the most laughs. One player acts as the Adventure Master, which rotates every turn, reads each Talk Card aloud then chooses a Talk Card he/she likes most. This continues every turn until a player's Talk Card is chosen three times!<br/><br/>Advanced Game Overview:  After choosing your hero (each having a unique game power), you'll draw 5 Dungeon Talk cards (talk cards have funny sayings, quotes, etc on them).<br/><br/>Talk cards are used by you to describe an adventure card (a fantasy scene with some really cool art). Each turn a new adventure card is drawn from the current Act deck of your quest. The acts are The Fellowship, Journey, and Destination.<br/><br/>Each turn a new player acts as the Adventure Master (AM). Players, except the AM, chooses a talk card from their hand and plays it face down.<br/><br/>The AM then draws a random talk card from the talk card deck and shuffles it in with the players' chosen talk cards. He reads aloud each talk card and chooses one he/she feels best describes the picture, is the funniest, most outrageous, drums up the most laughs, and so on.<br/><br/>If a player's card is chosen he gains a level and loot (loot can be in the form of gold coins, equipment,potions, spells, or weapons which can be used to aid yourself or hinder others).<br/><br/>If the random card was chosen, one player is cursed (a random negative effect is played on him). Throughout the game, players can use their special hero power and unique items they've earned to help themselves or hinder other players getting too close to winning!<br/><br/>The game ends when a player reaches glorious level 5!

Probably this is because there is no explanation. It seems absurd that one of the four players should have to stand out of every game.<br/><br/>And if the game is one of skill, as is confidently asserted, its value is much diminished by the exposure of one of the hands.<br/><br/>In whist each player knew only what was in his own hand. He had to use his reason or his imagination to decide what was in the hands of his partner or of his two opponents.<br/><br/><br/>Bridge Without the Dummy.<br/><br/>In the various forms of bridge his partner's hand is exposed once the bidding is over. Each player knows two hands, and so much of the real interest of the game is lost.<br/><br/>It is these things that have led to the invention of contract whist, or &quot;bridge without the dummy,&quot; as set out by Hubert Phillips in &quot;Contract Whist.&quot;<br/><br/>This is distinctly a whist game, since each player plays his own hand. There is no exposure of one hand, as in bridge. It is this, the author claims, which gives the game its special fascination. And, indeed, it is a sensible idea.<br/><br/>On the other hand, the bidding and scoring follow the lines of contract bridge, with changes and simplification.<br/><br/>As there is no recognised organisation to frame the rules of contract whist, the author has done it himself. He does not, however, claim to have invented the game. He says that the idea of bridge without the dummy has existed for years. The rule that only tricks actually contracted for can count towards the game is retained. The things rejected are, &quot;Vulnerability, the bidding of slams, and unnecessarily complicated scoring.&quot;<br/><br/><br/>The Scoring.<br/><br/>The scoring suggested is:<br/><br/>(1) A game is secured by the first side that scores 10 points. Rubber is the best of three games.<br/><br/>(2) Points count toward game only when scored &quot;below the line.&quot; These are points for tricks which the declaring side has contracted to make. Tricks at No Trumps count 4 points each. Tricks at a suit declaration count 3 points each. Tricks made by the declarers, but not contracted for are scored above the line, and count only 2 each. Where a contract has been doubled or redoubled, the value of each trick is doubled or redoubled. Over tricks are 5 each doubled, and 10 redoubled.<br/><br/>(3) Where the contract is defeated the defending side scores [above the line] 10 points for each trick which the declaring side has failed to make. If the contract has been doubled the deficiency score is 20 points; if redoubled 40.<br/><br/>(4) Nothing is scored for honors.<br/><br/>(5) The side winning the rubber receives 50 points.<br/><br/><br/>Rubber of 100 Points.<br/><br/>The average rubber is about 100 points in all.<br/>While the score is the same for all suit declarations, the preference in bidding is the same as in bridge--spades, hearts, diamonds, clubs.<br/><br/>Contract whist differs from bridge in that the play cannot be planned by the declarer from the outset.<br/><br/>The author gives many illustrations which suggest that contract whist could be made a most fascinating game.<br/><br/>"}, "167741": {"statistics": {}, "name": "Galaxy-Siege 2", "videogamemode": {"2149": "Single-Player"}, "videogameversion": {"256544": "Android download edition"}, "average": "0", "videogametheme": {"2331": "Space"}, "usersrated": "0", "videogamegenre": {"2505": "Shoot 'em Up"}, "videogameplatform": {"6063": "Android"}, "poll": {}, "description": "User Summary<br/><br/>Build your own giant ship in this upgrade heavy shootem up.

Finally, a few signature Super Powers, Equipment, Heroes, Villains, and even a Location for the main deck will add a little bit of extra JSA flavor to the set.<br/><br/>Crossover Pack #1 features the Justice Society of America, usually known simply as the JSA. These classic Super Heroes have been around for a long time and often claim top talent authors and artists, such as the worldfamous Alex Ross! You will find several pieces of his work in this very set. Their stories continue to this day and feature characters extremely important to the DC lore, such as Doctor Fate and Power Girl.<br/><br/>Naturally, these Super Heroes will be fighting against their own stable of classic Super-Villains, such as Solomon Grundy, Eclipso, and Ultra-Humanite! The JSA flavor continues with some of the Super Heroes&rsquo; own abilities added to the main deck: Mystic Bolts and T-Spheres.<br/><br/>Crossover Packs are the perfect way for players to customize their DC Comics experience to suit their own tastes and to play with their favorite characters!<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "1", "boardgameversion": {"256569": "Engish first edition"}, "maxplaytime": "30", "average": "7.37862", "name": "DC Comics Deck-Building Game: Crossover Pack 1 \u2013 Justice Society of America", "playingtime": "30", "boardgamemechanic": {"2664": "Deck / Pool Building"}, "age": "15", "boardgameexpansion": {}, "usersrated": "240", "boardgamefamily": {"23550": "Cerberus Engine: Heroes"}}, "167763": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2503082.jpg", "is_expanded_by": {"155428": {"name": "DC Comics Deck-Building Game: Crisis Expansion Pack 1"}}, "poll": {}, "boardgamedesigner": {"80539": {"name": "Richard Brady"}}, "statistics": {}, "yearpublished": "2015", "maxplayers": "5", "boardgamepublisher": {"12024": {"name": "Cryptozoic Entertainment"}}, "boardgameintegration": {"125678": "DC Comics Deck-Building Game"}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2503082_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "45", "boardgamecategory": {"1002": {"name": "Card Game"}}, "description": "Teen Titans go!

You have as much as you want.<br/><br/>It started out as a 7 Day First Person Shooter (7DFPS) game jam project made by a group of friends in August 2013. After releasing the prototype of SUPERHOT to the Internet, it quickly became very popular - the game was featured on sites like RPS, PCGamer, GiantBomb and more!.<br/><br/>Thanks to the support of our fans, SUPERHOT went through the Steam Greenlight process during a single weekend. This allowed us to expand the team and start remaking the prototype into a full-blown game.<br/><br/>On May 14th, 2014 we launched a Kickstarter campaign which was funded within the first 23 hours.

In Terraforming Mars, you play one of those corporations and work together in the terraforming process, but compete for getting victory points that are awarded not only for your contribution to the terraforming, but also for advancing human infrastructure throughout the solar system, and doing other commendable things.<br/><br/>The players acquire unique project cards (from over two hundred different ones) by buying them to their hand. The projects (cards) can represent anything from introducing plant life or animals, hurling asteroids at the surface, building cities, to mining the moons of Jupiter and establishing greenhouse gas industries to heat up the atmosphere. The cards can give you immediate bonuses, as well as increasing your production of different resources. Many cards also have requirements and they become playable when the temperature, oxygen, or ocean coverage increases enough. Buying cards is costly, so there is a balance between buying cards (3 megacredits per card) and actually playing them (which can cost anything between 0 to 41 megacredits, depending on the project). Standard Projects are always available to complement your cards.<br/><br/>Your basic income, as well as your basic score, is based on your Terraform Rating (starting at 20), which increases every time you raise one of the three global parameters. However, your income is complemented with your production, and you also get VPs from many other sources.<br/><br/>Each player keeps track of their production and resources on their player boards, and the game uses six types of resources: MegaCredits, Steel, Titanium, Plants, Energy, and Heat. On the game board, you compete for the best places for your city tiles, ocean tiles, and greenery tiles. You also compete for different Milestones and Awards worth many VPs. Each round is called a generation (guess why) and consists of the following phases:<br/><br/>1) Player order shifts clockwise.<br/>2) Research phase: All players buy cards from four privately drawn.<br/>3) Action phase: Players take turns doing 1-2 actions from these options: Playing a card, claiming a Milestone, funding an Award, using a Standard project, converting plant into greenery tiles (and raising oxygen), converting heat into a temperature raise, and using the action of a card in play. The turn continues around the table (sometimes several laps) until all players have passed.<br/>4) Production phase: Players get resources according to their terraform rating and production parameters.<br/><br/>When the three global parameters (temperature, oxygen, ocean) have all reached their goal, the terraforming is complete, and the game ends after that generation.

There is no elimination, that is, who enters the game stays until the end and everyone has a chance to win.<br/><br/>Butim is a card game that tells the story of the Bloody Islands Archipelago. These islands were used by generations of pirates to hide the biggest secrets that sailed the 7 seas. But all the pirates who buried their treasures there, also armed the most terrible traps so that these treasures stay properly protected. It was a beautiful and deadly place. However, as every story has an end, on a beautiful day a mysterious maelstrom opened near the islands and is leaching the islands with all this wealth to the bottom of the ocean. The objective of the game is to remove as many treasures as possible from these islands before they vanish forever. The player who has more wealth at the end of the game is declared the winner.<br/><br/>During the game you draw resources and cards, dig the islands (draw island cards) looking for maps and treasures and play special cards.

When all players have a hidden card in front of them, they turn the cards at the same time. The card in front of each player indicates which combination he/she should make. They have to see how much identical cards are revealed by other players, and how much identical cards they have on their hand.

They get 2 cards (showing parts of a postpacket) from the deck, keep 1 and discard the other one. The player who tapped the 3 can make, after choising from two cards, an additional move: steal a card from an other player. The player who could tap the 4 can choose a piece (out of two cards), steal another and gets the mailman. He/she also decides in which direction the cards are given in the next round.

We officially debuted the game at Gencon with a collectors set designed after the original white box of Dungeons &amp; Dragons. We did this to celebrate that game's 30th anniversary.<br/><br/><br/>Ten years later the game is growing stronger and faster than ever and we are happily celebrating our 10th anniversary.<br/><br/><br/>To bring it in properly we present to you the 4010 Collectors Edition of Castles &amp; Crusades, the Black Box. 10 years of C&amp;C. 40 years of D&amp;D. Its a wonderful world.<br/> There are only 1000 printed.<br/> The first 300 are signed and numbered.<br/><br/>Within are 3 books, 10 dice (four d6's with Castles and Crusades replacing the number 6), a small bit of company history, three cards that trace the evolution of the original company logo. These are all signed by the creators of TLG and C&amp;C: Stephen Chenault, Davis Chenault and Mac Golden.<br/><br/><br/> <br/>The three books:<br/> Adventurer's Backpack: Four new classes: The Archer, Avatar, Magic User and Thief. Original takes on old classes! Each of the new classes is fully detailed and playable out of the box. These are followed by four ready made adventurer's backpacks, with equipment cataloged and stored, with cost and EV attached. These are followed by 36+ spells, all new, all ready to hit your table right now!<br/><br/><br/>Of Gods &amp; Monsters of Aihrde: Details on 16 or more gods, 5 giants, 5 eldritch goblins, 4 fiends and one of the Captain Kings. Each entry places the god or monster squarely in the world of Aihrde, fully playable with adventure hooks. But these are no ordinary giants and fiends. The giants are named as are the goblins, each with their own sorry tale. The fiends are wholly new to C&amp;C, designed to aid CKs who need to bring characters to their senses!<br/><br/><br/>The Golden Familiar: Revised and expanded. This adventure originally appeared as an add on with the portrait screens. Now we've cleaned it up and added 14 maps.
