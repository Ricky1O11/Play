They cannot be damaged in any way (or removed from the game by other character's abilities) nor can they take any Actions other than to move. Umbra and Lucera are removed from play if Dinah leaves play. If an enemy Character wishes to occupy the same space as either Umbra or Lucera, the spirits are moved up to 1 inch (into an open area) by their controlling player to vacate the space. Umbra and Lucera move freely and independently during Dinah's activation as Intangible units with a Speed of 12 and a Control Zone of 4 inches.<br/> Spiritual Link<br/> Dinah can channel some of her magic abilities through Umbra and Lucera. When she does this Dinah is considered as being in the same position on the board as her spirit guardian. If she tries to channel an ability through a spirit guardian that is not within 16 inches of her (measures are taken after declaring the ability activation), the ability has no effect and that spirit guardian is removed from play.<br/> Angel Guardian<br/> If Dinah would be removed from play for any reason, roll a die, if you roll a 6+ Dinah remain in play with one Life Point. If Dinah is not removed due to this ability then remove one of her spirit guardians from the board.

I can&rsquo;t believe you actually want to put these adorable kittens in a blender! I guess that&rsquo;s none of my business. Maybe you&rsquo;re more of a dog person. Sure, kittens are curious by nature, but when they get in a kitchen full of dangerous appliances, it is up to you to save them.<br/><br/>This fast-paced card game has players working to save all of their own kittens before the unthinkable happens. But sometimes the only way to save your precious litter of kittens is to let those curious little cats learn the lesson of why you should never play in a Blender!<br/><br/>According to the box: A portion of the proceeds will be donated to a no kill cat shelter.<br/><br/>Objective:<br/>Save your kittens and send your opponents' kittens to The Blender.<br/><br/>Setup &amp; Play:<br/>Put the game box top on the table, open-side up and place the oversized Blender card inside, face-up: that's The Blender. Place the oversized Box card face up in the base of the box: that's The Box. Leave a little space between The Blender and The Box: that's The Counter.  Assign each player a Kitten color (red, green, blue or yellow), shuffle the deck, deal each player 6 cards and it's time to start saving adventurous kittens.<br/><br/>On each turn, players play two cards and then draw back up to 6. Kitten cards may be played into The Blender, The Counter or The Box.  All other cards are played face up in front of the player so that all players can see which cards have been played.<br/><br/>Players can play Kitties on the Move to move kittens to or from The Blender, The Counter or The Box; the number on the card specifies the number of kittens that can each be moved 1 space. Playing a Blend card will destroy the kittens currently in The Blender, save the kittens in The Box, and move the kittens on The Counter into The Blender unless countered by another player's Blend &quot;Pulse&quot; card.<br/><br/>Players can move kittens around with other cards as well. Kittens in the Blender moves all of the kittens on The Counter or in The Box to The Blender. With These Cats in the Blender a player can move all cats of a chosen color from The Counter and The Box to The Blender. Kittens in the Box moves all kittens in The Blender or on The Counter to The Box, while Cats on the Counter moves all the kittens in The Blender or The Box to The Counter.<br/><br/>Total chaos reigns when the Dog's in the Kitchen as each player gives her hand to the player in the direction indicated on the card.<br/><br/>The game ends when all 16 of the Blend cards have been played. Saved kittens are worth 2 points each, blended kitties cost 1 point each. Highest score wins.<br/><br/>Contents: 1 oversized Blender card, 1 oversized Box card, 110 playing cards (64 Kittens: 16 in each of 4 colors - red, green, blue and yellow; 18 Kitties on the Move: 6 of each number; 16 Blends: 8 Regular Blend &amp; 8 Blend Black; 4 Dogs in the Kitchen: 2 left &amp; 2 right; 2 Kittens in the Blender; 2 Your Cats in the Blender; 2 Cats on the Counter; 2 Kittens in the Box), rules.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": ["Closet Nerd first edition", "Redshift Games second edition"], "average": "5.80563", "name": "Kittens in a Blender", "playingtime": "30", "boardgamemechanic": ["Hand Management", "Rock-Paper-Scissors"], "age": "8", "boardgameexpansion": ["178039", "177567"], "usersrated": "1312", "boardgamesubdomain": ["Family Games", "Party Games"], "boardgamefamily": ["Animals: Cats"]}, "115106": {"poll": [], "name": "Prehistoric", "videogamemode": ["Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["Flash edition"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1479373.png", "videogameseries": ["Prehistoric"], "videogametheme": ["Cute Fantasy", "Prehistoric"], "usersrated": "1", "videogamedeveloper": ["(Self-Developed Video Game)"], "videogamegenre": ["Action", "Platform"], "videogameplatform": ["Web Browser"], "average": "9", "statistics": [], "videogamepublisher": ["(Web published)"], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1479373_t.png", "description": "User Summary<br/><br/>You are a dinosaur, and your species is going extinct.

When US forces occupied Manila, Aguanildo's own larger, and initially better armed veteran force squared off with McKinley's expeditionary force. There followed four years of &quot;official hostilities&quot; (Guerrilla activities dragged on for more than a decade after McKinley declared end to the war). Hostilities raged across the central island of Luzon and several other major island. After Aguinaldo's capture, his regular forces melted into the bush and US troops faced its first major guerrilla war in the Pacific. As with later foreign adventures, it was not a popular war at home.<br/><br/>Amigos and Insurrectos is an area movement game for two players (a US and a Filipino player). Three scenarios will be offered: an eight turn - STAND UP FIGHT, represents the clash of regular forces; an eight turn - INTO THE BUSH, representing the guerrilla phase of the conflict, and a 15 turn CAMPAIGN GAME, combining both. Regular forces will be represented on the regimental level. Abstract jungle movement will be available through guerrilla movement boxes and movement between islands will be possible though trans-island boxes. Originally designed as a Card-Driven game, random historical events will occur based on objective and turn based triggers. Victory will be based on a point swing track that in the extreme, could see Filipino collapse or US withdrawal. This is a topic shown very little attention in the gaming hobby.

Unlike its predecessor, Beyond Shadowgate is a classical point-and-click adventure viewed from a platform perspective. The player controls Prince Erik, the descendant of the hero from the first game, Lord Jair. When Prince Erik returns to his home country, he finds out about his father's murder. The Prince is framed by the minister of the late king, who imprisons him where the adventure starts.<br/><br/>As in Shadowgate, the player must solve a series of puzzles throughout the castle in order to proceed to the end of the game. Prince Erik can move around, examine, manipulate, and take objects. Commands also allow ducking and punching. Traps and puzzles along the game may cause sudden death of the character, if the puzzles and game elements are not correctly solved. Throughout the game, the player has the opportunity to meet his untimely demise; be it at the bloodied guillotine or at the mere act of peering into a gaping hole in the wall, only to find yourself face to face with a man-eating plant. In the end, one will need a sense of patience, and a sense of humor, if they intend to see the adventure through to the end.<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;Beyond Shadowgate&quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "115188": {"videogame": ["R.I.P.

GURPS Low-Tech and GURPS Low-Tech Companion 2: Weapons and Warriors deliver handsomely in that department . . . but it can take a lot of number-juggling to get costs and weights for the bits you want, and some page-flipping to find the options you desire. GURPS Low-Tech: Instant Armor offers defenses against both these annoyances and battlefield dangers.<br/><br/>The heart of the work is a complete set of armor tables for torso, arm, leg, head, neck, hand, and foot armor; for sub-locations like the abdomen, groin, and bits of the arms and legs; and for five helmet patterns. Each table lists only the armor materials that suit the body part in question, and adjusts TL when a material is available earlier or later than usual in that role. Every piece of armor comes with DR, cost, and weight, as well as the realistic time needed to don it and a Holdout penalty that accounts for DR, flexibility, and design.<br/><br/>But that's not all! You also get:<br/><br/>&bull;Materials and Modifications Tables. Handy summaries that let you quickly determine the options available at your TL, how they affect cost, and how they adjust the stats in the armor tables.<br/>&bull;Helmet Designs. Ready-to-use examples of complicated historical headgear, illustrating how the system can be used to create some classic helmets.<br/>&bull;Optional Rules. Answers to a variety of questions, from &quot;How much does it cost to armor only my vitals?&quot; to &quot;Can I sleep in armor?&quot;<br/>If you've ever been frustrated trying to armor your TL0-4 warriors, then Low-Tech: Instant Armor is for you!<br/><br/>Low-Tech: Instant Armor is a supplement to GURPS Low-Tech, but the armor stats within would be useful in any TL0-4 GURPS campaign.<br/><br/>"}, "115238": {"poll": [], "name": "Rebelstar Raiders", "videogamemode": ["Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["ZX Spectrum edition"], "average": "0", "videogameseries": ["Rebelstar"], "videogametheme": ["Science Fiction"], "usersrated": "0", "videogamedeveloper": ["(Self-Developed Video Game)"], "videogamegenre": ["Strategy"], "videogameplatform": ["ZX Spectrum"], "statistics": [], "videogamepublisher": ["Red Shift"], "description": "User Summary<br/><br/>Rebelstar Raiders is a tactical combat game developed by Julian Gallop.

Players take on either the role of the United States, struggling to protect itself from foreign threat, or the role of one or more of the invading armies, fighting battle after battle to acquire important territories.<br/><br/>If the invading forces claim enough U.S. cities, America's defense is broken and the nation falls. But if the United States can protect its cities for long enough, the invading forces fail to uproot America and their incursion is ended.<br/><br/>Fortress America is played over several rounds in which each player musters his forces, moves into enemy-controlled territories, and engages in fierce firefights. But depending on whether you're the U.S. player or one of the Invaders, your play experience and general strategy will be entirely different. The U.S. must efficiently wield its colossal lasers, the ultimate weapons of mass destruction, in its own defense. What's more, as U.S. hovertanks, helicopters, bombers, and infantry are destroyed and removed from the map, a steady supply of American guerilla fighters spring up to defend their homeland. The U.S. player is surrounded and alone, and must do his best to fend off advances on three fronts in a series of tense battles.<br/><br/>The Invaders, on the other hand, must remain constantly aggressive. Their objective is to collectively capture 18 of 30 major U.S. cities, and to do so, they must apply early pressure before the U.S. has a chance to react, and keep the pressure constant. To complicate the Invaders' mission, their armies do not receive additional reinforcements, so they must make optimal use of the forces at their disposal. Through a series of nail-biting battles that use a unique dice-based combat system, each player will maneuver his dwindling armies to secure his objective. But can America be stopped, or will a failed invasion only compel them to tighten their military grip on the world.<br/><br/>Changed in this edition:<br/><br/><br/>     Custom combat dice, debatable if better than normal dice.<br/>     A ten-turn timer gives the U.S. player an additional path to victory: outlasting the invasion.<br/>     A &quot;Captured City&quot; track lets all players see, at a quick glance, how close they are to victory or defeat.<br/>     A few city locations have been removed, and others added, to create a different (possibly more balanced) play experience.<br/>     A deck of variant cards for the Invader players has been added to use as a rules option (equal to 1-2 balance levels).<br/><br/><br/>Reimplements:<br/><br/>    Fortress America (1986)<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": ["English second edition"], "average": "6.92435", "name": "Fortress America", "playingtime": "150", "boardgamemechanic": ["Area Movement", "Dice Rolling"], "age": "0", "usersrated": "669", "boardgamesubdomain": ["Wargames"], "boardgamefamily": ["Country: USA"]}, "115294": {"poll": [], "name": "Serious Santa", "videogamemode": ["Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["Flash edition"], "average": "0", "videogametheme": ["Fairy Tale", "Folklore"], "usersrated": "0", "videogamedeveloper": ["(Self-Developed Video Game)"], "videogamegenre": ["Action", "Run-and-gun", "Scrolling"], "videogameplatform": ["Web Browser"], "statistics": [], "videogamepublisher": ["(Web published)"], "description": "User Summary<br/><br/>It is the month after Christmas, and Santa is busy sleeping.

It is a few years later, and The Professor left for a vacation leaving his granddaughter, Natsumi (Natalie in the U.S. version)[2], and Spike's cousin, Hikaru (Jimmy in the U.S. version), to watch over the laboratory. The Professor has left them with one task: deliver a load of monkey pants to the monkeys in Monkey Park. Hikaru accidentally sends not only the monkey pants, but The Peak Point Helmets as well. Specter gets a hold of one, and yet again makes an army of monkeys bent on ruling the world. Jimmy aims to capture all the monkeys and stop Specter. However, Specter has supplied five monkeys with Vita-Z bananas, making them stronger and more intelligent than the average monkeys.<br/><br/>Hikaru manages to capture all of the Freaky Monkey Five, except Yellow Monkey. Before his fight with White Monkey, Pipotchi, a baby monkey accompanying Hikaru, is kidnapped, in order to transfer the data in his Peak Point Helmet into a device called the Lethargy Laser. Rescuing Pipotchi, Hikaru makes his way through a monkey controlled military base, and confronts Specter, who is waiting for him with a hi-tech gunship. Before the two can battle, Yellow Monkey, now a giant monster thanks to an overdose on Vita-Z bananas attacks the facility. Specter flees, and Hikaru manages to downsize and capture Yellow.<br/><br/>Hikaru, the Professor and Natsumi then discover the purpose of the Lethargy Laser. By firing it at the globe, all humans worldwide will lose the will to fight back, making it easier for Specter and the monkeys to take over the world. Hikaru confronts Specter at his moonbase, who attacks him with a giant robot. Once defeated, Specter attempts to fire the laser, but Hikaru states that humans will never give up, and captures him. Jimmy and Pipotchi then flee the exploding moonbase.<br/><br/>Shortly afterwards, Specter escapes and goes into hiding. Hikaru then proceeds to capture all the remaining monkeys before the Professor discovers Specter's hiding place. Hikaru warps there, encountering Specter, and the two of them battle again. Specter loses and is once again captured. The game ends with Spike visiting the laboratory, which is destroyed when Hikaru accidentally crashes a spaceship into it.<br/><br/>Gameplay is similar to the previous game. Movement is controlled with the left analogue stick and R buttons, and gadgets are controlled with the right analogue stick. Three new gadgets are added, the Electro Magnet, used for pulling metal blocks and clinging onto metal surfaces, the Water Cannon used for putting out fires, and the Bananarang, that can attract monkeys with a banana fragrance. A new feature is the ability to change the gadget loadout by holding down one of the gadget buttons and changing the gadget.<br/><br/>Also introduced in this game is Pipotchi, a sidekick who can assist Jimmy in reaching ledges and occasionally revive him if he's knocked out. Also, the gotcha coins that spawn from enemies are used as currency for bonuses, and can multiply in worth if left alone.<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;Ape Escape 2&quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "115432": {"poll": [], "name": "Dreamworks Super Star Kartz", "videogamemode": ["Local Multiplayer", "Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["English/European PlayStation 3 edition", "English/European Wii edition", "English/European Xbox 360 edition", "North American PlayStation 3 edition", "North American Wii edition", "North American Xbox 360 edition"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1408696.jpg", "videogametheme": ["Movie, Book, TV show"], "usersrated": "1", "videogamedeveloper": ["High Impact Games"], "videogamegenre": ["Racing"], "videogameplatform": ["PlayStation 3", "Wii", "Xbox 360"], "average": "6", "statistics": [], "videogamepublisher": ["Activision"], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1408696_t.jpg", "description": "Get in the driver&rsquo;s seat for some wacky, wild and wondrous kart racing action as your favorite DreamWorks&reg; Animation characters are brought together for the very first time!<br/><br/>Features<br/><br/>-For the first time ever, race to the finish line with your favorite characters from Shrek, Madagascar, How To Train Your Dragon &amp; Monsters vs. Aliens!<br/>-Play as Shrek, Donkey, Alex, King Julien, Hiccup, B.O.B. and many more!<br/>-Race on amazing tracks from your favorite movie locations such as Shrek&rsquo;s Swamp, the New York City Zoo and the Island of Berk!<br/>-Challenge up to 3 of your friends in hilariously fun multi-player action or dominate the competition in head-to-head battle-mode (console only).<br/>-Perform crazy stunts, jumps, and tricks that showcase your favorite character&rsquo;s unique personality.<br/>-Collect awesome power-ups for a speed boost or launch special projectiles to capture the checkered flag.<br/>-Limited edition Wii bundle includes a DreamWorks Animation racing wheel customizable with 25 awesome stickers!<br/><br/>Source: The Publisher Website.<br/><br/>"}, "115433": {"poll": [], "name": "Appleseed EX", "videogamemode": ["Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["JP PS2 edition"], "average": "0", "videogametheme": ["Anime"], "usersrated": "0", "videogamedeveloper": ["Dream Factory Publishing, Inc."], "videogamegenre": ["Action"], "videogameplatform": ["PlayStation 2"], "statistics": [], "videogamepublisher": ["SEGA Corporation"], "description": "Appleseed EX is a video game by Sega for the PlayStation 2 based on the 2004 film of the same name and on the manga of the same name by Masamune Shirow.

It was the first game in the series to be created by Global Star Software instead of series creator 3DO and the last game to follow the series. The game is more mature and darker than earlier games in the series. Sarge makes no comical moves, holes are blown into soldiers, and the weapons are also made of metal.<br/><br/>The game begins with an attack on Greentown by the Tan army and Sarge battling through the war-torn city to save it. After the battle, Sarge is informed by Colonel Grimm that the Tan Army has surrendered and that there will be a peace ceremony later that night, but that a rogue Tan division - Operation &quot;Vengeance&quot; - led by Lord Malice has stolen some infantry molds and can now build an army. Sarge's mission is to find and capture Malice, recover the stolen molds, and locate a missing recon squad.<br/><br/>Sarge arrives in the area (a beach) and battles his way to the Tan portal. There, he discovers plans indicating that Malice has placed a bomb at the peace ceremony, hidden in the Peace Statue. Sarge charges through the portal to stop the ceremony, but he is too late - as the bomb goes off, Plastro, Colonel Grimm, the Heroes and the Green and Tan armies are annihilated.Sarge then sets out to kill Malice.<br/><br/>He battles his way through the remains of Greentown to another Tan portal. Upon proceeding through the portal, he finds himself in Malice's artillery base. Sarge destroys all the artillery and discovers a plastic well mine that Malice is using to build his army. Sarge floods the mine, rendering it nearly useless. He then travels across the desert to Malice's castle. Malice is using the castle as a communication center for his air and ground forces, as well as a prison base for some of the Green army's finest men. Sarge penetrates the castle's defenses, frees the prisoners and destroys the communications tower. Discovering a passage from the castle to a kitchen in the Real World, Sarge flashes back to a time when he was in a similar kitchen, in a squad led by Major Gooding. During a mission, Gooding and his squad were ambushed by Tan forces. During the ambush, Sarge called in an air strike and found Gooding's arm near the sink, leading him to the conclusion that Gooding was dead. As Sarge takes off in the helicopter, the flashback ends, and Sarge moves forth.<br/><br/>At the end of the game, Sarge finally reaches Lord Malice's headquarters, where he battles Malice himself. After defeating and fatally wounding Malice, Sarge asks him why he killed the Greens and Tans in Greentown. Malice reveals that it was simply to make Sarge suffer. Sarge removes Malice's face mask and discovers that he was actually Major Gooding, who was accidentally left for dead. Eventually, the Tan found him and changed him into the Lord Malice he is now. At the end of the scene, Sarge is seen walking out, saying that war makes ultimately no sense.<br/><br/>The closing animation reveals storage tubes inscribed with the names of the deceased soldiers from the Greentown attack, hinting that Col. Grimm and the Heroes, along with Vikki, may not have died, and perhaps Malice had simply killed copies of them in order to play on Sarge's emotions - an action that ultimately was Lord Malice's undoing, According to the strongest rumor the storage tubes might have been metal coffins to sum up the story.<br/><br/>The events described at the end of Sarge's War occur during the beginning of Army Men II, making the assumption that both games have a relation and explaining the lack of iconic characters but what is confusing is the clear different appearance of Plastro and Sarge, and Plastro supposedly died in Sarge's war at the bombing of Greentown.<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;Army Men: Sarge's War&quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "115445": {"boardgamedesigner": ["K\u00fclliki Alesmaa", "Merje Ermel", "Helgi Isakannu", "Helle Kont", "Ester Koplimets", "Karin Lassmann", "Karoliina Liiv", "K\u00e4tlin Liivrand", "Tiina Lilleleht", "Lada Mehikas", "Piret Meltsas", "Reet Meren\u00e4kk", "Liina Niinem\u00e4gi", "Aire Orula", "Aime Paeveer", "Piret Pappel", "Eliko Petser", "Jaana P\u00f5ldoja", "Val Rajasaar", "Eve Sarap", "Triin Tamme", "Piret Valge", "Ande Veermets", "Urmas Veersalu"], "average": "0", "poll": [], "name": "L\u00e4bi lodu rabast randa", "playingtime": "60", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": ["Dice Rolling", "Press Your Luck", "Roll / Spin and Move"], "yearpublished": "2011", "usersrated": "0", "maxplayers": "8", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1183751_t.jpg", "boardgameartist": ["Arne Ader", "Juhani Juurik", "Epp Margna", "Jakob Oetjen", "Krista Simson"], "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["Eestimaa Looduse Fond"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1183751.jpg", "boardgameversion": ["First Edition"], "maxplaytime": "60", "boardgamecategory": ["Educational", "Racing", "Trivia"], "age": "8", "minplaytime": "60", "description": "Educational game made for schools to introduce 4 parts of the nature.

It was developed by PlayFirst and published by PlayFirst, KatGames, and Big Splash Games. it was launched on September 25, 2007. Diner Dash: Hometown Hero is a strategy game that simulates running a restaurant. It has an ESRB rating of E for everyone.<br/><br/>Flo returns to her hometown to visit her Grandma, Florence, only to find that the place has become a run-down ghost town. Flo decides to use her culinary skills to rejuvenate the town by improving the restaurants at all the formerly popular hangouts.<br/><br/><br/>Gameplay involves seating customers as they enter the restaurant. One must drag and drop each group of customers to a table appropriate for their group size. Extra points are given for seating a customer in a chair that is the same color as the customer's clothing. Then, Flo must take their orders, send the order to the kitchen, deliver the food, give the group the check, and clean the table for new customers. There is hardly ever only one group of customers at a time, so the player must use time management in order to keep all of the customers happy. Each group of customers has a row of hearts at their table in order to show their mood. If the mood drops low enough, the customers will leave and you lose money. However, if the customers remain happy, they will stay and tip well. Each level has a money goal that one must reach in order to continue on to the next level. As the player moves from level to level, they are able to select new upgrades for the restaurant. New elements are also added such as spills or desert in different levels in order to make the game more challenging and interesting. The player also has the option of playing a &quot;continuous shift&quot; where there are no levels or story. You just continue to play to see how much money you can earn.<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;Diner Dash: Hometown Hero&quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "115459": {"rpgartist": ["Gerald Brom", "Napole\u00e3o Figueiredo", "S\u00e9rgio Furlani", "Roberto S.

The next day, Flo and Chef Cookie are surprised by the sign, unfortunately it is too late.

Unlike the previous Diner Dash games, players can purchase upgrades during the start of a level, these upgrades can be bought using the money earned in the previous shift. Some upgrades are permanent (example: faster chef, faster shoes, and disaster protection) but some are just for one level and cost more expensive than any upgrades (example: podium helper, salad bar helper, and extra hands) Players can also customize the diner and the venues, the venues can be customized at several levels, there are four different items to be customized, after choosing which item to be customized, players can choose one of several different venue upgrades, in the end all four of customizer options will be finished and the player is awarded with a venue medal. The Diner can also be customized, unlike venue customizer, the Diner customizer objects will unlock one by one with finishing levels.

The West Coast is a fiery grave as terrorists manage to sneak a nuclear bomb through the shipping lanes after President Dean dismantled the Department of Homeland Security. The East Coast has become a chemical cesspool after a hidden Al Qaeda army hit us on our soil. Rural America suffers the hardest losses as thousands of miles of national forests and rural towns are sprayed with toxic chemicals by crop dusters. America is in ruins. The borders are closed by the remaining military forces left and the police departments are forced to act as our National Guard. Vice President Al Gore is assassinated while visiting California. Washington is hit shortly afterwards by a nuke which was hidden in a Metro bus. There is no more government.<br/><br/>It is now 2010. Three years after the United States disaster a new government made up of military officers is formed. They manage to secure the country and begin an operation to weed out the Al Qaeda army.
