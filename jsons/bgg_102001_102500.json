Further, dozens of small improvements got implemented.<br/><br/>Equipped with one construction unit, a Vibz-type starship, and a small amount of credits, players start out in a guarded star system (&quot;Imperial system&quot;) to eventually create their own empire. Typical first steps in Mankind consist of building a small base on one of the nearby planets and mining available resources which could either be sold or used to construct further units. Later, a player can leave the safety of the Imperial systems behind and colonize his own star system.<br/><br/>The game takes place in the so-called &quot;Mankind galaxy&quot;. The galactic map available for navigation is divided into sectors of space (&quot;cubes&quot; in game jargon), each of which might contain between zero and about 25 stars. Each star system contains between 5 and 8 planets.<br/><br/>Early game reviews talked about a total sum of 900 million available planets, each with their own climate, seasons and population, a figure that was repeated in advertising text on the game box and even topped by the official website, which claimed several million systems and billions of planets.<br/><br/>In fact, a majority of these planets and star systems were unavailable (&quot;closed&quot;) at the initial release of the game and have never been opened afterwards. During the two game resets since its release, the layout of the Mankind galaxy was changed and its size reduced. The last released galaxy consists of 73,251 star systems with 476,265 planets.<br/><br/>The persistent universe feature means that even when players are not involved in the game their mines extract ore, factories create equipment, ships continue commerce, and combat units continue to do battle. The game also has option to allow the user be notified via cell phone text message if their units came under attack.<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;Mankind (video game)&quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "102490": {"rpg": {"413": "Fighting Fantasy Gamebooks"}, "poll": {}, "name": "Mudworm Swamp", "rpgproducer": {"3": "(Uncredited)"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3311124.jpg", "usersrated": "0", "rpgitemversion": {"109183": "Softcover Version"}, "average": "0", "statistics": {}, "rpggenre": {"155": "Fantasy (High Fantasy)"}, "rpgcategory": {"2136": "Solitaire Adventure"}, "rpgseries": {"7851": "Adventures of Goldhawk"}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3311124_t.jpg", "description": "Publisher Blurb<br/><br/>&quot;Having triumphed in your two previous quests, you have now become Goldhawk, King of Karazan.

The game was first released on November 25, 1994 for the Super Famicom. It became available on the Virtual Console in February, 2007 for 800 Wii Points. The story-line was written by Takemaru Abiko and production was directed by Kazuya Asano and K\u014dichi Nakamura.<br/><br/>Kamaitachi no Yoru was the second sound novel developed by Chunsoft, and its popularity brought a myriad of other companies to develop similar games. The term &quot;sound novel&quot; was originally a registered trademark of Chunsoft, but is now regarded as a whole genre of its own. The game sold close to a million copies (including remakes and ports), making it a financial success as well.<br/><br/>The game revolves around T\u014dru and his girlfriend Mari, who are suddenly drawn into a horrible murder mystery while on vacation at a skiing lodge. The first part of the games develops as a crime-solving adventure. Additional murders occur if the player is unable to find clues, and the story culminates into a horror movie-esque ending.<br/><br/>When the player completes the main story with a certain number of different endings, two additional stories (the occult chapter and spy chapter) are unlocked. When all three stories are finished with every possible ending, two more self-parodical stories also become available. Fulfilling one final requirement allows the player to unlock a parody of Torneko no Daib\u014dken: Fushigi no Dungeon.<br/><br/>The additional stories cover a wide variety of themes, and are completely unrelated to each other and to the main story. Though the same set of characters is used throughout the game, the character settings differ significantly in each story.<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;Kamaitachi no Yoru&quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "102018": {"rpgitemversion": {"107133": "First Printing"}, "poll": {}, "name": "Prawo i Sprawiedliwo\u015b\u0107", "rpgproducer": {"3": "(Uncredited)"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1028191.jpg", "usersrated": "2", "rpgsetting": {"2249": "Neuroshima"}, "average": "7.5", "rpgissuearticle": {"156588": "Gry fabularne w 2011 roku"}, "rpg": {"1285": "Neuroshima"}, "statistics": {}, "rpgcategory": {"2108": "Sourcebook (rules/options to enhance play)"}, "rpggenre": {"165": "Science Fiction (Post Apocalypse)"}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1028191_t.jpg", "description": "Publisher Blurb:<br/><br/>Mistrzu Gry!<br/>Znajdziesz tu niewyczerpany materia\u0142 na sesje: zal\u0105\u017cki przyg&oacute;d i kampanii, barwnych Bohater&oacute;w Niezale\u017cnych i szereg wyzwa\u0144 do postawienia przed dru\u017cyn\u0105.<br/><br/>Graczu!<br/> Si\u0119gnij po niego dla nowych opcji tworzenia postaci.

Another change is the player's choice of pilots and mecha independent of each other, allowing the ability to use any combination of man and machine.<br/><br/>There are also changes in gameplay: players are given more ranged combat options than in other Dynasty Warriors games, although melee combat is still the focus of the game.

Originally released for the Super Famicom, it was released on the Japanese Virtual Console in 2007 and a mobile phone in 2008 by G-Mode.<br/><br/>The game's plot and setting are loosely based around various episodes included in Greek mythology. The hero begins the game in a state of total memory-loss, but discovers that he has somehow acquired a mysterious power that shields him from all bodily harm, essentially making him immortal. The only clue the hero has in discovering his own identity is a mysterious dream that he sees every night, and he begins his journey in search of the location shown in the dream.<br/><br/>The gameplay borrows various motifs from ancient mythology, particularly the concept of immortality. An immortal character can execute certain actions that other characters cannot, like jumping off high cliffs without being injured. The game's writer, Kazushige Nojima, composed a storyline where the hero encounters the Greek gods while trying to discover his own true identity. This theme was later repeated in his work as a scenario writer for Final Fantasy VII. Like the game's prequel, Heracles no Eik\u014d II: Titan no Metsub\u014d, the game focuses on its rich storyline rather than the game system, which does not differ significantly from other role-playing video games of the period.<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;Glory of Heracles (series)&quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "102023": {"statistics": {}, "name": "Glory of Heracles IV: Gift from the Gods", "videogamemode": {"2149": "Single-Player"}, "videogameversion": {"107144": "Japanese Super Famicom edition"}, "average": "0", "videogameseries": {"11069": "Glory of Heracles"}, "videogametheme": {"2415": "Mythology"}, "usersrated": "0", "videogamegenre": {"2155": "RPG"}, "videogameplatform": {"4440": "SNES"}, "poll": {}, "description": "Heracles no Eik\u014d IV: Kamigami kara no Okurimono (\u30d8\u30e9\u30af\u30ec\u30b9\u306e\u6804\u5149IV \u795e\u3005\u304b\u3089\u306e\u8d08\u308a\u7269?, &quot;Glory of Heracles IV: Gift from the Gods&quot;) is the fifth installment of the series (fourth game in the main series), released after the portable spinoff Heracles no Eik\u014d: Ugokidashita Kamigami. The game was made available for the Virtual Console in 2008. The player takes the role of a young man whose spirit was separated from his body. The player must progress by having the spirit enter and take control over the bodies of various humans and animals encountered along the way.<br/><br/>The game's plot and setting are very loosely based around various episodes from Greek mythology, with a particular focus on Atlantis and the tale of Pandora's box.

Unlike the first game in the series, Heracles is no longer the player-controlled character. Instead, the player takes the role of a young boy living in an age where Heracles is already recognized as a legendary hero. The boy learns that the last-remaining offspring of the Titans has crowned himself the king of darkness, causing chaos across the world, and sets off on a journey to defeat the evil king.<br/><br/>Though the game is set to take place directly after the events of the original Heracles no Eik\u014d, the game's plot creates several inconsistencies in the series timeline. The portable spinoff, Heracles no Eik\u014d: Ugokidashita Kamigami, was released in 1992 to fill the gap between the two games.<br/><br/>The party system is newly introduced into the series, along with time-flow, where the game passes between daytime and nighttime. Most of the characteristics from the original Heracles no Eik\u014d were scrapped, and a basic game system used for many RPGs of the time period was employed in their stead. Though no longer containing a particularly unique game system, Heracles no Eik\u014d II is characterized by its tragic, dramatic storyline, which employs various motifs from Greek mythology. All subsequent releases in the series follow the basic format established in this game.<br/><br/>The game's scenario was written by Kazushige Nojima, who would later achieve widespread recognition for his work on Final Fantasy VII.<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;Glory of Heracles (series)&quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "102026": {"statistics": {}, "name": "Faerie Solitaire", "videogamemode": {"2149": "Single-Player"}, "videogameversion": {"107148": "iPad edition"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1113272.jpg", "videogametheme": {"2335": "Fairy Tale"}, "usersrated": "26", "average": "5.38654", "videogamegenre": {"2402": "Classic Games"}, "videogameplatform": {"6826": "iPad"}, "poll": {}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1113272_t.jpg", "description": "Have magical fun in the addicting Card game, Faerie Solitaire!

The object of the game is to captain a ship that must journey around the globe racing to gather cargo as you compete for valuable contracts that earn you victory.<br/><br/>All the world&rsquo;s a stage! Thirty cargo ports-of-call with six different types of goods: Aerospace, Apparel, Coffee, Energy, Fruit and Lumber. Six home ports, each with a couple of contracts that need to be delivered. A race to determine the captain of the sea!<br/><br/>Every game is different because the contracts always change. Dice rolls determine movement and you bank what you don&rsquo;t use. Every turn, there is a chance that bad weather or political crisis will impede your decision. Often, there will be Communiqu&eacute; cards that will give you bonus opportunities. Always, you will have to watch what the other players are doing.<br/><br/>Cargo Runners has the classic feel of a mid-50s board game - only it&rsquo;s not! It&rsquo;s brand new, designed specifically to take advantage of all the benefits of the iPad&rsquo;s graphics and computing power. Cargo Runners can be played on a single iPad just like you would a regular board game or with its Game Center &ldquo;Online Multiplayer&rdquo; functionality, you can sail the world over with real players from all across the globe.

The game is a traditional action-adventure game, reminiscent of the Castlevania and Metroid games. This game was originally only available in Japanese, but an English translation patch has been produced by Ian Kelley of AGTP. The game has been announced for a future WiiWare release.<br/><br/>The protagonist of the game is a whip wielding adventurer similar to Indiana Jones exploring the tomb within La-Mulana. Although there is only one ending in the game there are many ways to get there, in that completing objectives in the game (gaining power ups and reaching new areas) is not linear, nor is there an obvious recommended path to take. Many powerups will allow you to reach new areas (similar to Super Metroid), but the game gives no indication of where to go.<br/><br/>Since the game was intended as a tribute to the MSX games of the 1980s (and especially to Maze of Galious), it uses the 16-color palette and low resolution typical of those games. Also, the opening sequence parodies the typical load screen of the MSX, displaying the amount of available video RAM and a copy of the MSX logo. The protagonist also has a laptop MSX in his possession throughout the game, and can collect or buy ROM cartridges for it; many of these can be combined to produce various special effects.<br/><br/>Gameplay<br/>Initially the protagonist is only equipped with a whip, and has a small amount of vitality. Items in the game help advance the plot, some of which do not grant any abilities, but open up a new area or allow another item to be taken. Other items, however, do grant the protagonist abilities, and some are also required to access new areas of the game.<br/><br/>Most non-boss enemies in the game will not cause a lot of damage to the protagonist, however there are very few ways to restore life, and in many cases getting hit will cause the protagonist to fall down and lose significant progress. An item in the game is available early on that enables teleportation back to the start (the location of the game's only save point) in addition to various waypoints. As explained in the game's manual, the general strategy of the game is to explore and solve as many puzzles as possible before getting low on life and teleport back when the risk of death becomes too great. However, actions taken in certain rooms can make it very difficult to return after warping out, so warping out is not always the wise action.<br/><br/>One of the principles behind the game's design is difficulty: as described in the game's manual, the developers were disappointed in the lack of difficulty prevalent among many games of the current era (around 2005-2007), and sought to help create a sense of tension in the game&mdash;the example they gave was that, if one were a real-life archaeologist, one might think twice before jumping into a dark pit, but in many videogames, it is too easy to simply attempt the action, suffer the consequences, and reload. The tension is created by arming many features in the game with various traps that can easily befall reckless adventurers (as also noted by the wealth of skeletons in the dungeon), as well as several complete dead ends (notorious among well-versed players), from which, short of teleportation, there is no way out. These traps are explained in-game to exist in order to protect these sacred ruins.<br/><br/>Wii-Ware Version<br/>The WiiWare version will feature a number of changes, partly to tone down the difficulty and improve design in order to appeal to a larger audience, partly to give players who've played the original a new experience, and partly due to copyright issues. In addition, the graphics will be updated to a smoother style and the music will come in orchestrated form.<br/><br/>The last category includes such changes as:<br/><br/>Renaming the MSX computer system the &quot;Mobile Super X&quot;.<br/><br/>A revision to the melody of &quot;Curse of IRON PIPE&quot; in order to remove similarities with a certain track from the game Ashguine II.<br/><br/>Reception<br/>After the release of the English translation patch for the game, the game was played by gaming websites 1UP.com and Joystiq. It was received as a fun game, with 1UP.com calling the game 'a great exploratory platformer along the lines of Metroid or Castlevania that completely nails the graphical and musical style of an MSX game, however, both websites noted that the game is extremely difficult.<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;La Mulana&quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "102102": {"statistics": {}, "name": "The Threshold (Issue 1 - Sep 1989)", "rpgproducer": {"49966": "Thomas Bruhn-Petersen"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1046142.jpg", "usersrated": "0", "average": "0", "rpgissue": {"10230": "The Threshold"}, "rpgissuearticle": {"56533": "The Cemetary"}, "rpg": {"244": "Advanced Dungeons & Dragons (2nd Edition)"}, "rpgissueversion": {"107423": "First printing"}, "poll": {}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1046142_t.jpg", "description": "User summary:<br/>First issue of The Threshold, containing:<br/>Editorial, Once upon a time, Roleplaying?, AD&amp;D Adventure, Expanded WFRP movement rules, and more<br/><br/>"}, "102103": {"statistics": {}, "name": "Ravnen (S\u00e6rnummer - 1992)", "rpgproducer": {"3": "(Uncredited)"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1045566.jpg", "usersrated": "0", "average": "0", "rpgissue": {"4840": "Spilmagasinet Ravnen"}, "rpgissuearticle": {"56429": "Lidt om foreningen"}, "rpgissueversion": {"107425": "First printing"}, "poll": {}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1045566_t.jpg", "description": "Special issue of Ravnen, promoting their regular magazine, and the club that published it.<br/><br/>"}, "102104": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1059779.jpg", "boardgameimplementation": {"258": "Fluxx"}, "is_expanded_by": {"177946": {"name": "Fluxx Dice"}}, "poll": {}, "boardgamedesigner": {"122": {"name": "Andrew Looney"}}, "statistics": {}, "yearpublished": "2011", "maxplayers": "6", "boardgamepublisher": {"76": {"name": "Looney Labs"}}, "maxplaytime": "10", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1059779_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "10", "boardgamecategory": {"1002": {"name": "Card Game"}}, "description": "Fluxx gets the Science Fiction treatment.

Across the world, the infant Queens of Fate are being reincarnated into the world. Can you find them before the dark powers get to them?<br/><br/>--<br/>These are the complete instructions on how to play a solitaire game called Queens of Fate, using only a deck of tarot cards and a large playing surface. I made up this game as a tool to help me learn to use and interpret the multi-faceted meaning of the tarot cards in different ways, and soon found both the game and its story to be quite addictive.<br/><br/>Gameplay consists of turning over cards from the deck, one at a time and resolving them.  Depending on the type of card (classified in the game as Opposition, Arcana, Source, or Court), you will either play it into your play area, confront it in a challenge, or compare it to the previous card drawn. You have a set of Arcana cards and Source cards to use in battles, but each can only be used once.<br/><br/>The strategy of the game involves using (discarding) cards you have in play when an Opposition card comes up, or deciding whether not to confront at all and deal with the consequences.  Playing cards in certain combinations allows you to &quot;resurrect&quot; cards from the discard pile.<br/><br/>The goal is to play the four Queens, and place one in each suite-themed play area.  If you run out of cards before this happens, you lose the game.  The Queens can be lost through losing battles to Obstacle cards, which may attack your Court cards or random cards from your deck.<br/><br/>"}, "102106": {"statistics": {}, "name": "Gussun Oyoyo", "videogamemode": {"2313": "Cooperative"}, "videogameversion": {"107429": "Japanese Arcade edition"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1554635.png", "videogametheme": {"2337": "Cute Fantasy"}, "usersrated": "1", "average": "8", "videogamegenre": {"2165": "Puzzle"}, "videogameplatform": {"4781": "Arcade"}, "poll": {}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1554635_t.png", "description": "User Summary<br/><br/>The game is a cross between Lemmings and Tetris.

Due to the change of hardware, many improvements were made such as 3D-like visuals that made use of gradiation and stereo sounds and voices. A &quot;mosaic guessing&quot; mini-game has also been added as well where the player must guess the identity of an object covered by mosaic.<br/><br/>Because of its inclusion of various stages and boss battles from the first two Famicom installments, as well as in the inclusion background music, this installment is more of a compilation of the previous installments than a new game by itself.

The players each control a basketball team competing in four timed quarters of game play. While Mattel did obtain a license from the National Basketball Association and used the NBA logo in its box art, NBA Basketball does not use any official team or player names.<br/><br/>Gameplay<br/><br/>Each player controls a three-man basketball team, actively controlling one team member at a time, with the computer controlling the other two. Like the real game of basketball, the player's team must score more points than the opponent's team by shooting more baskets and blocking opponent's shots on their basket. The game consists of four quarters, each a simulated twelve minutes in length. The pace of the game is governed by a simulated 24-second shot clock.<br/><br/>At the start of the quarter, the two players control the centers during the tip-off. The team who wins the tip-off begins on offense, with the player controlling the team member with the ball. Players on offense use the keypad to select where in the offensive half of the court they wish to pass the ball. If a computer-controlled offensive team member receives the pass, control passes to that team member. When attempting to shoot the ball at the basket, players may choose between a jump shot (which is less likely to be blocked, but only hits at close range) and a set shot (which can hit from long distances, but has a greater chance of being blocked).<br/><br/>On defense, the player controls one member of the team, considered the &quot;captain.&quot; The defense can block shots, intercept passes and rebound missed shots, and computer-controlled defensive team members are able to steal the ball from the offense. When a defensive team member (either player- or computer-controlled) gets the ball, the player controls that team member and switches to the offensive controls.<br/><br/>If the score is tied at the end of the fourth quarter of play, a single five-minute overtime period is played.<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;Basketball (Intellivision game)&quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "102131": {"videogame": {"103604": "Intellivision Lives!"}, "statistics": {}, "name": "Tennis (1980 / Intellivision)", "videogamemode": {"2422": "Local Multiplayer"}, "videogameversion": {"107530": "US Intellivision"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1439858.jpg", "videogametheme": {"2368": "Sports - Tennis"}, "usersrated": "3", "average": "7.66667", "videogamegenre": {"2157": "Sports"}, "videogameplatform": {"4427": "Intellivision"}, "poll": {}, "videogamecompilation": {"103604": "Intellivision Lives!"}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1439858_t.jpg", "description": "Game Manual<br/><br/>You're at center court, facing your opponent across the net, testing your strategy and your skill!

For their chastened opponents, Allied operations in this theater of the war were limited to raids and small-scale offensives as war efforts in North Africa and Europe, as well as the South Pacific, drew higher priorities for resources and personnel. For much of 1943 and early 1944 the fighting in Burma was relegated to WWII's backwater by both sides. With the end of the monsoon season in 1944 the strategic situation had changed. Not only were Japanese fortunes declining precipitously elsewhere, but the build-up in Allied forces along the Burma/India border did not go unnoticed. Determined to pre-empt any Allied attack, the Japanese launched an offensive of their own in May, the largest they ever launched outside of China, against the Allied positions in and around Imphal and Kohima. The battles that raged among the jungles and mountainous hillsides of the Indian and Burma frontier, and the subsequent Allied victory that followed in July, marked a fundamental and permanent shift in the war. The Allied offensive in March 1945 was one marked by extensive planning and preparation, as well bold and daring maneuvers that not only took the Commonwealth and Indian forces across the Irrawaddy River to Rangoon, but crushed the defending Imperial Japanese Burma Area Army.<br/><br/>Defeat into Victory, by designer Paul Rohrbaugh, covers this neglected aspect of WWII history using a very interactive and easy to play design. The game has one 22&quot; by 34&quot; hex map that stretches from Dimapur in the north to Rangoon in the south. A countersheet with 280 half-inch units (mostly brigade and regiments in size) and approximately 16 pages of rules and charts round out the package. The game uses a chit-pull activation system. Rules cover supply (a crucial aspect in terrain that was among the most inhospitable of the war), various types of combat (fire, maneuver and assault), as well as morale and leadership. Rules also include random events (that simulate the effects of battles and decisions by higher-ups elsewhere), weather, Japanese suicide tank attacks (human combat destruction squads) and changing war goals. The air campaign is also simulated (in much more detail than generic &quot;air points&quot;). Scenarios include the initial Japanese offensive against Imphal and Kohima, two on the Allied 1945 offensive, as well as the Campaign Game. Tough decisions will have to be made by both sides as they allocate precious resources among their formations, determine their enemy's intentions and balance their plans, as well as attack and defend. &quot;<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": {"107607": "First edition"}, "age": "12", "name": "Defeat Into Victory: The Final Campaigns in Burma", "playingtime": "180", "boardgamemechanic": {"2057": "Chit-Pull System"}, "average": "6.53365", "usersrated": "20", "boardgamefamily": {"10625": "Country: Burma"}}, "102147": {"rpgitemversion": {"107610": "GM screen"}, "statistics": {}, "name": "Paranoia Game Master's  Screen (Mongoose)", "rpgproducer": {"3": "(Uncredited)"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2423054.jpg", "usersrated": "0", "rpgsetting": {"2611": "Alpha Complex"}, "average": "0", "rpggenre": {"185": "Comedy / Satire"}, "rpg": {"1851": "Paranoia (Mongoose Edition)"}, "rpgcategory": {"2086": "Accessory (dice, maps, screens, cards)"}, "poll": {}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2423054_t.jpg", "description": "publisher blurb<br/><br/>TRUST THE COMPUTER!

Both games were developed in parallel over a thirty-year period. Why is the game set in 2020? A few soccer rules changed by that year, making the game more fluid.<br/><br/>While StreetSoccer simulates soccer with five players on a side on a small square, Champions 2020 simulates stadium soccer, so the field is bigger. As coach you select 11 players as a starting line-up (goalie, defenders, midfielders, forwards), while the rest of your team starts in the dug-out for possible substitutes (after warming up).<br/><br/>Your professional soccer players are more skilled than street soccer players, which leads to spectacular stadium matches. Players can try to hit passing balls, which can lead to throw-ins, corner-kicks and goalie-kicks. As skilled team players, your players can anticipate on passes. Your goalie is skilled, too. With good positioning he has the best save chances, which depends on the speed of the shot and the distance to the ball. A rebound is possible, but a better save is catching the ball in his hands.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, the players are &quot;skilled&quot; in causing fouls (or &quot;schwalbes&quot;), too. As soccer coach, you can't always control your players &ndash; and that leads to free kicks, penalty kicks, yellow/red cards and injuries.<br/><br/>For tournaments the yellow/red cards, injuries, extra time, penalty kicks and stats make the soccer simulation complete.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": {"107646": "Multilingual first edition"}, "average": "7.22308", "name": "Champions 2020", "playingtime": "60", "boardgamemechanic": {"2035": "Roll / Spin and Move"}, "age": "11", "usersrated": "78", "boardgamefamily": {"5551": "Sports: Football / Soccer"}}, "102160": {"rpg": {"11082": "PageQuest"}, "statistics": {}, "name": "PageQuest: Quest for the Auburn Pelt", "rpgproducer": {"3": "(Uncredited)"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1032367.jpg", "usersrated": "2", "rpgitemversion": {"107648": "PDF version"}, "average": "7", "rpggenre": {"961": "Fantasy"}, "rpgcategory": {"2136": "Solitaire Adventure"}, "poll": {}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1032367_t.jpg", "description": "user summary<br/><br/>A diceless, paper-and-pencil solitaire adventure game originally released free at GenCon 1997, it is now available as a free PDF - print on both sides of a single sheet of paper and tri-fold.<br/><br/>"}, "102161": {"poll": {}, "name": "Sudoku Slide!", "playingtime": "20", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": {"2048": "Pattern Building"}, "yearpublished": "2006", "usersrated": "0", "boardgamefamily": {"8068": "Sudoku"}, "maxplayers": "2", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1030025_t.jpg", "average": "0", "statistics": {}, "boardgamepublisher": {"4": {"name": "(Self-Published)"}}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1030025.jpg", "boardgameversion": {"107649": "First edition"}, "maxplaytime": "20", "boardgamecategory": {"1032": {"name": "Action / Dexterity"}}, "age": "8", "minplaytime": "20", "description": "Race against your opponent to form Sudoku!

Each round, each player receives one of the eight silhouettes (which are numbered 2-8 with one blank), while three silhouettes are placed in the center of the table as suspects and the final silhouette is dubbed the victim.

The first player of the round secretly looks at two of the three suspects, optionally swapping the victim for one of these suspects. He then places a colored accusation marker below one of the suspects. The next player looks at the two suspects not just marked with an accusation marker, then places a colored accusation marker of her own, covering any markers already beneath that suspect. This continues until all four players have placed an accusation marker, with each player not being allowed to look at the suspect just accused.<br/><br/>The round ends, and players reveal the suspects.

Each space on the board relates to an activity that you would do at camp.  Some spaces will reward you for an activity and others will penalize you for let&rsquo;s say... throwing a water balloon.  You roll dice to move and each trip around the board is a day at camp.  You choose the number of days based on level of play.

It is also one of the few adventure games made by the company to not use a variation of the SCUMM game engine (the other games being the GrimE-based Grim Fandango and Escape from Monkey Island). The game engine and graphics are very similar to a later work by Lucasfilm Games called Habitat.<br/><br/>Labyrinth: The Computer Game is a menu-driven adventure game, played from a third-person perspective. The game begins by asking the player their name and gender, the game then opens as a text-based adventure. During the text-based portion of the game the player goes to the theater to see the film Labyrinth. The movie starts and an image of Jareth comes on the movie screen, after which the game becomes a graphic adventure.<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;<a target='_blank' href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labyrinth' rel='nofollow'>http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labyrinth</a>:_The_Computer_Game,&quot; available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "102211": {"statistics": {}, "name": "Test Drive Unlimited 2", "videogamemode": {"2310": "Network Multiplayer"}, "videogameversion": {"107875": "Windows Downloadable edition"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1031889.jpg", "videogameseries": {"5513": "Test Drive"}, "videogametheme": {"2456": "Driving"}, "usersrated": "6", "average": "5.5", "videogamegenre": {"2154": "Racing"}, "videogameplatform": {"4435": "PlayStation 3"}, "videogamehonor": {"31897": "2010 Game Critics Best Racing Game of the Year Nominee"}, "poll": {}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1031889_t.jpg", "description": "Test Drive Unlimited 2 (TDU2) is a racing video game developed by Eden Games and published by Atari.

He discovers after he arrives that the Queen disappeared shortly before he joined.<br/><br/>Atlantis is a first-person perspective puzzle game. The entire game is in 3-D. The HUD is basically a 'window' into the world of Atlantis, instead of moving a mouse around the screen, moving the mouse actually moves the screen itself. To interact with the world, the player must position the item, NPC or thing into the middle of the screen.<br/><br/>Progression through the game involves solving various puzzles of varying difficulty. Some puzzles are extremely abstract and the solution is completely unexpected, whereas other puzzles are very simple. Another feature of Atlantis is having periods where the player must react quickly to certain events happening in the game.<br/><br/>The game features a number of proprietary technologies developed by Cryo. One such technology is called OMNI 3D which provides a smooth, panoramic 360-degree first-person view of the game environment.

The game was published by Human Entertainment and was released in Japan in 1995. It was then re-released in Japan in 1997, when it was ported to the PlayStation with some adjustments, and renamed to Clock Tower ~The First Fear~ (\u30af\u30ed\u30c3\u30af\u30bf\u30ef\u30fc \uff5e\u30b6\uff65\u30d5\u30a1\u30fc\u30b9\u30c8\uff65\u30d5\u30a3\u30a2\u30fc\uff5e, Kurokku Taw\u0101 ~ Za F\u0101suto Fi\u0101 ~). There have also been ports to the WonderSwan, and PC, both of which were released in 1999. The game has not been officially released outside of Japan, but has reached gamers internationally through ROM-swapping and hacked fan translations. The story is loosely based on Dario Argento's film, Phenomena. This was considered as the scariest game for the SNES and other ports by players.<br/><br/>Clock Tower is a 2D point-and-click style game, where the player controls a cursor to direct the main character, Jennifer Simpson, and give commands such as investigating objects or opening doors. The interface is akin to 1990-era computer adventure games, but simplified to work better with a gamepad. Primarily, the player can only move Jennifer left and right through the environment, although there are some rooms in which an action requires Jennifer to step into the background.<br/><br/>Clock Tower is unique to other adventure games of the era in that it features a stalker pursuing the main character; this delays puzzle solving and requires the player to run in order to find objects or hiding places to fend off or avoid the attacker. The stalker is a slasher villain, named Bobby, who wields a large pair of scissors. If directly confronted by Bobby, the player engages in a &quot;panic&quot; phase and must repeatedly pound the &quot;panic button&quot; to struggle with the attacker. If Jennifer is low on health, or the player does not tap the panic button fast enough, Bobby will attack Jennifer and the player will be presented with a game over screen.<br/><br/>Although the game refers to it as Jennifer's health, the color of the background where her face is shown changes to represent her current fear level. Blue means she is in a calm state, while yellow means she is startled, orange meaning she is alarmed, and finally red, where she will begin to panic. In red, she is more likely to be attacked during a direct confrontation with Bobby. Additionally, while running away from Bobby, there is a chance Jennifer might trip over her feet, making her vulnerable if Bobby is close by.<br/><br/>Many of Bobby&rsquo;s appearances are triggered by the player inspecting certain objects, but there are some cases in which he will come out of a hiding place and chase Jennifer as soon as she enters a room.<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;Clock Tower: The First Fear&quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "102302": {"statistics": {}, "name": "Bish\u014djo Janshi Suchie-Pai", "videogamemode": {"2422": "Local Multiplayer"}, "videogameversion": {"108506": "Japanese Super Famicom edition"}, "average": "0", "videogametheme": {"2403": "Board Game"}, "usersrated": "0", "videogamegenre": {"2402": "Classic Games"}, "videogameplatform": {"4440": "SNES"}, "poll": {}, "description": "User Summary<br/><br/>Bish\u014djo Janshi Suchie-Pai is a mahjong videogame.

To do that, Hercules must pass several tasks and defeat many villains, and at the end, face Hades, ruler of the dead, who is also responsible for Hercules' losing of his immortality.<br/><br/>The game is mainly two-dimensional, although in many missions, the player can walk to other planes via pathways or stairs. There are ten levels and three difficulty modes: Beginner, Medium, and Herculean. The last two levels are playable only on Medium and Herculean difficulties. There are three rush levels in the game in which the player must run forward through the map and avoid obstacles without being able to stop or fight. The player's health is measured in the energy bar shown in the upper left corner for normal levels or bottom left for rush levels. The energy bar can be increased by picking up Hercules Action Figures and the energy can be replenished by drinking Herculade cups found throughout the game. The player's main weapon is the sword, although he can also punch, but this is a much more difficult way to defeat enemies. Weapon powerups, known as Gifts of the Gods, can be found throughout the game, consisting of the Lightning Sword (shoots lightning any direction Hercules aims when selected and fired), Fireball Sword (shoots fireballs that seek out onscreen enemies when selected and fired), and the Sonic Sword (affects enemy targets at close range with a circular sonic blast when selected and fired). There is also an invincibility powerup, found in the game in the form of a helmet, which grants the player a few seconds of invulnerability when activated.<br/><br/>Powerups have limited action, and once their energy has depleted, they can no longer be used. In many levels, there will be hidden letters that if all collected, will form the word HERCULES and will allow the player to spawn directly at the next level, instead of starting the game all over from the beginning. There are also four hidden vases in each mission, that upon collection, will give the player a secret password for the current level, which he can later use at the game start screen to spawn at the level from which the vases were collected. During the game, the player will face many bosses, most of which can't be defeated by conventional fighting and require the player to perform special actions to pass. Among the enemies that Hercules will face are: Nessus the Centaur, the Minotaur, the Stymphalian Birds, the Hydra, the Medusa, and Hades. Several Titans and a Cyclops also appear in the game, but the player does not fight them directly.<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;Hercules (video game)&quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "102311": {"statistics": {}, "name": "Frogger's Adventures: The Rescue", "videogamemode": {"2422": "Local Multiplayer"}, "videogameversion": {"108537": "North American GameCube edition"}, "average": "6", "videogameseries": {"14700": "Frogger"}, "videogametheme": {"2471": "Animals"}, "videogamegenre": {"2161": "Action Adventure"}, "videogamefranchise": {"5336": "Frogger"}, "videogameplatform": {"4425": "GameCube"}, "usersrated": "1", "poll": {}, "description": "Frogger's Adventures: The Rescue is an action-adventure video game released in 2003 by Konami HWI. It is based on the original 1981 Frogger arcade game, and contains similar hop-and-dodge style gameplay.<br/><br/>A young Frog named Frogger is relaxing inside his home in Firefly Swamp when a spaceship crashes in his yard, injuring his friend and guardian Lumpy. The driver of the ship turns out to be Beauty Frog of F.I.R.S.T. (Frog International Rescue Support Team). Frogger becomes a member of F.I.R.S.T. and goes on missions to exotic locations to rescue many of Beauty Frog's friends, including Doctor Frog, who is needed to heal Lumpy. Finally he rescues his girlfriend Lily, who has been kidnapped by T.R.I.P (Tyrannical Reptiles in Power).<br/><br/>The game contains hop-and-dodge style gameplay similar to that of the original arcade game. Frogger, however, can perform many moves that he could not in the original. Frogger can perform a &quot;super hop&quot; which allows him to jump over the space in front of him, as well as being able to move footholds and sections of certain walls with his tongue. (This is the first Frogger game to include tongue moves.) Frogger can also rotate left and right.<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;Frogger's Adventures: The Rescue&quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "102312": {"statistics": {}, "name": "Action Stations!", "videogamemode": {"2409": "Hotseat"}, "videogameversion": {"108540": "North American Amiga edition"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1035206.jpg", "videogametheme": {"2542": "Ocean / Sea"}, "usersrated": "3", "average": "10", "videogamegenre": {"2156": "Simulation"}, "videogameplatform": {"4415": "Amiga"}, "poll": {}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1035206_t.jpg", "description": "Back of Box<br/><br/>Naval Surface Combat Tactical Simulation, 1922-1945<br/><br/>Battleships, cruisers, destroyers, shore batteries and many other naval units engage in deadly, exciting War at Sea!<br/><br/>Action Stations! is unique--a combat modeling system designed by an active duty naval officer to test computerized tactical decision support systems has been adapted into a commercial simulation of unparalleled accuracy and authenticity.<br/><br/>This is not a toy!

It was released for the Nintendo 64 in Japan on November 10, 2000. Later, on February 19, 2008, it was released for the Virtual Console in Japan, but it is unknown if it will be released in any region outside of Japan for the Virtual Console. It is the second title of the Custom Robo series, as well as the last of the series for the Nintendo 64. It is also the first title of the series to allow up to four players to play, instead of two players.<br/><br/>The battle system in Custom Robo V2 is very similar to the first one, except it features tag-teaming, which was never used in later 3D Custom Robo titles except for Custom Robo: Battle Revolution for the Nintendo GameCube.<br/><br/>The gameplay of Custom Robo V2 is divided into two main parts the over world and Robo battles during the over world parts of the game it plays like any other RPG meaning that you play as a character in a free roaming world where other characters follow. The main object of the whole game is to finish its plot by collecting every Robo, battle part, and other items that the player wants, while winning every battle that moves you from one part of the storyline to the next.<br/><br/>In Custom Robo battles, the object is to reduce the opponent's hit points from 1000 to 0 by using different Custom Robos, guns, bombs, pods, and dash attacks. Battles begin with both robos being launched out of a Robocannon which is controlled with the control stick. There are six ways your robo can land once shot out of the Robocannon. Custom Robos are arranged in groups that are similar to their abilities. An endurance bar is located above the hit points. Once it runs out the robo gets &quot;downed&quot; which means that it stays fallen for a couple seconds. After it gets up, it goes into &quot;rebirth&quot;, where it stays invincible for about 3 seconds.<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;Custom Robo V2&quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "102315": {"statistics": {}, "name": "G-Force", "videogamemode": {"2422": "Local Multiplayer"}, "videogameversion": {"108569": "iOS edition"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3066766.jpg", "videogametheme": {"2336": "Furries / Talking Animals"}, "usersrated": "4", "average": "6.25", "videogamegenre": {"2147": "Action"}, "videogameplatform": {"4443": "iPhone"}, "poll": {}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3066766_t.jpg", "description": "The game based on the movie, which takes place after the team escapes from the pet store, Juarez and Blaster's new home, and Kip and other FBI agents, gives players the ability to play as Darwin and Mooch to fight against Leonard Saber, the evil billionaire and his robot &quot;household appliances&quot; army.<br/><br/>The PlayStation 3 and the Xbox 360 versions feature an anaglyph-based stereoscopic 3-D mode, and will be packaged with two sets of 3-D glasses.<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;G-Force (video game)&quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "102316": {"statistics": {}, "name": "Jurassic: The Hunted", "videogamemode": {"2310": "Network Multiplayer"}, "videogameversion": {"108580": "US PlayStation 2 Edition"}, "average": "6", "videogametheme": {"2427": "Alternate Historical"}, "usersrated": "1", "videogamegenre": {"2160": "First Person Shooter"}, "videogameplatform": {"4434": "PlayStation 2"}, "poll": {}, "description": "The player controls Craig Dylan as he accompanies Armando &quot;Rock&quot; Depedra, and Sabrina Sayrus to the Bermuda Triangle searching for Sabrina's father, James Sayrus.

Dr. Sayrus tells Dylan of an impending disaster and tells him to find a Temporal Vortex Engine that will allow them to return to their own time, located in a German submarine in a cave. Dylan finds the TVE and tries to return to camp, running into Sabrina again, who is being chased by a Spinosaurus she calls &quot;Spike.&quot; They manage to escape and return to the fort, only to learn that the uranium battery that powers the TVE no longer works. Dylan recovers another battery from a drone that apparently arrived on the island via a temporal vortex from the future and returns to camp again, but Spike apparently followed him and tries to kill them. Dylan fights off Spike while Dr. Sayrus fixes the TVE and allows Dylan and Sabrina to escape just as Spike breaks in while he and Rock stay behind to hold him off. Dylan and Sabrina emerge on a sandy beach and wonder what to do just before another portal opens up, and Dr. Sayrus and Rock emerge on the repaired submarine one year after Dylan and Sabrina returned, with an apparently dead Spike tied to the hull. As the game ends, Spike's eye opens up, leaving whether or not a sequel will be made up in the air.<br/><br/>Combat encounters include arena style fights, fortification sieges, survival modes and boss battles.

First couple that knows other couples best and collect 6 cards are the winner couple.<br/><br/>Card game:<br/>Uses 2 classic game decks. Can be played with 2 or with 4 couples. Each couple gets a deck of cards or 2 suits in one color. Hearts and spades in this game act as trumps.<br/>Hearts are a life together and spades are the separation. Game is played in one full circle. With 2 couples the idea is to get rid of all the spades and collect all the hearts. Problem is that they both act as trumps, so getting rid of spades is hard, but there are special rules for Jacks and Queens in other suits that help to make that easier. When all cards are played, couples read their hearts and spades. Each heart is 2 points, each spade is -2 points, each Jack and Queen is extra 2 points (whatever suit) and each Ace is a free drink card (still a party game). Winner is the couple with the most points.<br/>In 4 couple game, game is played the same, but the winning conditions are different. Couples now only score how many cards they have - each red 2 points, each black -2 points. Rest is the same with the exception that 0 is the worst result. That means the further you are from the 0 the higher your score is.<br/><br/>Couples game:<br/>Uses the special trivia game cards. This is played in circles, couples sitting against each other. When the times comes to a player, he/she pulls a cards and ask one question from his partner about herself/himself. Partner then writes down an answer along side with the question asker. When the answer are more or less the same, they score one point (a kiss or a hug). Game lasts 10 rounds. Couple with more points (kisses) wins the game.<br/><br/>Other 4 are drinking games (one seems to be a sex game) where there is no actual winners or scoring of any kind. Like they say in the rules - all players are winners with these games.<br/><br/>"}, "102330": {"statistics": {}, "name": "The Hall of Fire (Issue 41 - May 2007)", "rpgproducer": {"47871": "David DeBoe"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1032308.jpg", "usersrated": "0", "average": "0", "rpgissue": {"9586": "The Hall of Fire"}, "rpgissuearticle": {"66683": "Art Credits"}, "rpg": {"318": "Lord of the Rings Roleplaying Game"}, "rpgissueversion": {"108631": "PDF version"}, "poll": {}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1032308_t.jpg", "description": "<br/>Contents:<br/><br/>2, A NARRATOR&rsquo;S SO-CALLED LIFE <br/><br/>     The Players by Matthew Kearns<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>4, RANDOM ENCOUNTERS <br/><br/>     Warg / Wolf Pack by Matthew Kearns<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>6, FAN FLAVOUR by Matthew Kearns<br/><br/>     Elvish Longbow (2nd Age) <br/>     Mordor Shortbow (2nd Age)<br/>     Numenorean Steelbow<br/>     Scroll of Isildur<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>7, FEATURED CREATURES <br/><br/>     Nwalmarog (S.

This often overlooked campaign featured classic land battles, naval engagements between lake flotillas, cruiser duels at sea and finally hit and run guerrilla engagements. It opened with conventional force-on-force battles dominated by infantry, machine guns, and trenches. But the low troop densities and wide open spaces enabled a war of movement spearheaded by South African cavalry that broke the stalemate in mid 1916. This left Von Lettow-Vorbeck a choice between surrender or guerrilla war. He chose the latter and dragged his weary pursuers through a series of running battles in Portuguese East Africa.<br/><br/>Designed by WWI game specialist John Gorkowski, Guns of the Askari features 280 half-inch full color counters that represent forces as varied as rifle companies, armored cars, naval units for oceans or lakes, and the supply units on which both sides depended. There are even artillery units back-printed with the other side&rsquo;s colors, so that they can be captured and used again.<br/><br/>The game offers four different scenarios, from the complete campaign to the 1918 guerrilla operation and two periods in between.

Subscriptions could be purchased online using debit/credit cards, or PayPal to play on a regular basis, or through boxed copies, which were released in the United Kingdom on 23 January 2009. The servers for the game shut down in May 2011.<br/><br/>Football Manager Live differed significantly from previous Football Manager titles, whilst keeping the same match engine and many of their fundamental concepts.<br/><br/>Users were assigned to a &quot;Game World&quot; of up to 1000 players and created their club and filled their squad with real players, similar to fantasy football. Players were signed via a proxy bidding system similar to that of eBay with the player signing with the highest-bidding club. Whilst Football Manager Live utilised a very similar database to that of Football Manager 2009, like its offline counterpart, aging players retired and younger players were randomly generated in their place within each game world, creating an increasingly fictional environment as seasons progress.<br/><br/>Clubs could choose a football association based on the number of matches the user wants to play (&quot;Casual&quot; FAs for casual players and &quot;Xtreme&quot; ones for more dedicated managers) and which play times were most convenient. Each FA had its own ladder system with a premier league and several lower leagues which were linked via promotion and relegation. Matchmaking for league fixtures was done through a &quot;resolve by&quot; system in which users have to finish a game by a certain deadline instead of having to meet online at a specific time. If a player could not meet the deadline, an AI &quot;assistant manager&quot; took over their team for that match.<br/><br/>The game also added a role playing game-like skill training system for users. Managers could improve their skills over time in coaching, physiotherapy, finance, scouting and infrastructure to become more specialised or to suit their style of play.<br/><br/>Players could also construct a stadium to accommodate several different fan bases to the club. These included die hards, devoted, families, glory hunters and corporates, each offering their own characteristics such as wealth and atmosphere.<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;Football Manager Live&quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "102390": {"statistics": {}, "name": "Empire of the Over-Mind", "videogamemode": {"2149": "Single-Player"}, "videogameversion": {"108838": "Apple II 5 1/4\" Floppy Disk"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1458763.png", "videogametheme": {"2148": "Fantasy"}, "usersrated": "0", "average": "0", "videogamegenre": {"2168": "Text Adventure"}, "videogameplatform": {"4978": "Apple II"}, "poll": {}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1458763_t.png", "description": "from company advertising<br/><br/>Empire of the Over-Mind is a recent recipient of the Game of the Year award from Electronic Games Magazine, and is an enchanting solitaire game.
