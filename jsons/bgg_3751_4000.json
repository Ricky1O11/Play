At the opposite corner of the board is the entrance to the cave. Every turn each player rolls a D6 to move. Players must move their pawns in a clockwise direction along the edge of the board upon a narrow track. At the left-hand corner is a space marked &ldquo;W&uuml;ste&rdquo; (Desert). Each pawn must stop there. To leave the desert a player must roll an odd number. Upon reaching the far corner players must pause on the corner before opening the mountain.<br/><br/>The heart of the game happens within the cave. The cave is large, dominating the game mat. Up to 40 square cards can be placed face down, one per space, within the cave. This number will be reduced if the optional obstacles and tea light are used. The cards show the same back, depicting a vase. When a pawn ends its move on a vase the active player may inspect it, and claim the treasure shown. In addition, the player rolls a die to see if they break the vase. If not, they replace the treasure card with a blank card showing the same vase on the back. In this way the game board becomes depleted of treasures and filled up with worthless empty vases, or voids where vases were broken.<br/><br/>Complicating the player&rsquo;s lives is the band of 40 thieves. Really it is just the black pawn, but he travels the board seeking to prevent the players from absconding with the treasures. Combat slightly favors the black pawn, encouraging all the players to give him a wide berth.<br/><br/>As players collect more treasures, they become encumbered, and forfeit movement points as their load increases. This allows the black pawn to possibly catch a player&rsquo;s pawn. However, some of the treasure cards are empty backpacks and sacks, allowing a pawn to carry more treasure before becoming encumbered. Further, the black pawn is slow, rolling a special die with a top value of four.<br/><br/>Once a pawn has escaped from the cave, he must continue clockwise upon the track along the edge of the board. At the right-hand corner is a space marked BAGHDAD. Each pawn must stop in Baghdad, and may only leave on the roll of an even number. Should the pawn fail to leave, one of its hard-earned treasures will be lost. Staying in Baghdad is expensive! Eventually the pawn will escape Baghdad, and travel back to the starting corner.<br/><br/>To win the game the player must have more treasures than any other player, and they must also have more treasures than what remains within the cave.<br/><br/>"}, "3786": {"boardgamedesigner": {"5": {"name": "Jean du Po\u00ebl"}}, "average": "6", "statistics": {}, "name": "Trapper-Company", "playingtime": "0", "minplayers": "2", "yearpublished": "2001", "usersrated": "1", "maxplayers": "6", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic11188_t.jpg", "boardgameartist": {"3": "(Uncredited)"}, "boardgamepublisher": {"6": {"name": "Historien Spiele Galerie (Historien Spielegalerie)"}}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic11188.jpg", "boardgameversion": {"248202": "First Edition"}, "maxplaytime": "0", "poll": {}, "age": "10", "minplaytime": "0", "description": "Players are fur dealers, who try to trap as many furs as possible and then return to Quebec to sell those furs.

For example, by using the CGME Core Rules coupled with the CGME Space Gameworld you could build a Gameset to play interstellar battles, trade wars across colonial star systems, early 1970's Soviet vs. US orbital conflicts, and many more.<br/><br/>If a Gameworld does not cover all the details you need to play out your event, you are free to haul off and add in what you need, modify what is there and hopefully make it available so others can use it.<br/><br/>CGME is freely available in Volume 1 Issue 1 of Countermoves<br/><br/>"}, "3793": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic57754.jpg", "poll": {}, "boardgamedesigner": {"3": {"name": "(Uncredited)"}}, "statistics": {}, "yearpublished": "1986", "maxplayers": "4", "age": "6", "boardgamepublisher": {"1731": {"name": "Estrela"}}, "maxplaytime": "10", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic57754_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "10", "boardgamecategory": {"1032": {"name": "Action / Dexterity"}}, "description": "Pig pong combines the ever popular &quot;sport&quot; of ping pong with, well, plastic pigs.<br/><br/>The contents are 1 net, 2 scoring tokens (shaped like pigs), 1 serving trough, 6 puff balls and 4 pigs.<br/><br/>The general idea of the game is to have two teams, on either side of the plastic net, squeeze the plastic pigs.

Each turn players plan in advance six moves for their caravan, trying to second-guess what other players will do to their best advantage.  Delivering goods allows the player to increase their influence in one of three separate categories - each delivery allows you to advance your position in two of the three categories.  Religious influence is marked by the number and value of your stupas in buildings on the board, political influence is marked by the number of sherpas you have in the regions between the paths on the board, and economical influence is marked by the total number of yaks you have on your delivery disks.<br/><br/>The scoring is unique to the game, in the 4 player game anyway (the player count the game is primarily designed to be played with).  To determine the winner you first score up religious influence, and the player with the least religious influence is eliminated, and their remaining pieces are removed from the board.  Next the player with the least political influence is eliminated.  The remaining two players decide the winner by who has the greatest economic influence.

The board is a hollow box with irregularly shaped wooden spacers between the top and bottom. The game board is shaken during the game setup to randomize the location of the wooden spacers (oil deposits). The playing surface is divided into 60 real estate parcels, each of which has from one to 10 drilling sites. Players bid to lease parcels, and once they acquire one or more leases, they may drill on their leased tracts at a cost of $10,000 per hole.  This cost of drilling is lost if the result is a dry hole, but there is a large payoff for successful wells (&quot;gushers&quot;). Players begin with a stake of $300,000. The game ends when a player accumulates $1 million.<br/><br/>Although the game is largely a contest of luck, there is some strategy. Successful wells tend to be clustered. Thus tracts that are contiguous to parcels on which there are successful wells are more highly valued. Furthermore, because gushers produce revenue for the owner with each turn, successful wells obtained early in the game are considerably more valuable than those obtained near the end.<br/><br/>Play proceeds in turns, and each player upon his turn may designate one or two unleased tracts for bidding or he may choose to drill if he has previously acquired one or more leases and has undrilled sites.  Players may sell or trade leases and drilling sites, and they may form partnerships to acquire leases or share the cost of drilling.<br/><br/>In a typical game setup, approximately 15% to 20% of the drilling sites will be gushers. A game generally requires about 20 complete turns.<br/><br/>Early 1940's editions employ a 20.5&quot; x 20.5&quot; game board; these feature boxes with deep, dark colors and silvered print.

One player takes the part of The Doctor, and the others become one of his three arch enemies, i.e. Davros, The Master, or the Cyber Controller. Each of these characters has a team of four followers, Davros and four Daleks, The Doctor and his assistants, etc. There are also many other characters in the game that may be recruited. By collecting these characters each player tries to build a powerful team. By a series of battles and challenges, players fight for control of the universe until only two players remain and a final great battle decides the victor.<br/><br/>Characters<br/>There are four main characters in the game, each having a team of four loyal assistants. These are: 1) The Doctor and his four assistants, Tegan, Ace, Romana and K9; 2) Davros and four Daleks; 3) The Master and his evil Time Lords, Morbius, Borusa, Omega and Rani; 4) The Cyber Controller with four Cybermen.<br/><br/>The remaining cards comprise three Ice Warriors, three Mutants, two Marshmen, The Black Guardian, Linx, Shockeye and Garron. Each card lists the character's &quot;Inner Force&quot; (his inherent strength), and a list of weapons and devices with which he is skilled.<br/><br/>Set Up<br/>Each player rolls the die -  the highest scorer becomes The Doctor, and takes the character card of The Doctor and places it in front of them. The other players, in order of score, select one of the main characters. The Doctor takes the four white counters - these represent his four regenerations, or lives. The other players take the appropriate colored counters. The Master - black, Davros -  red, etc. Place the silver counter on the ring at the top of the board. (The ring of weapons and devices) on the space marked by the Magic Recorder. The Doctor can then place ONE of his white counters on any one of the Tardis spaces on the three main movement rings on the board. The other players can now place their counters on any of the Hyperspace squares on the board, though not on the same space as another player. The other character cards are left in the box for easy access during the game.<br/><br/>Movement (always clockwise) is determined by rolling the die. You can move from one ring to another as long as it does not involve an anti-clockwise movement. You land on spaces that allow you to take certain actions: collect a character, hyperspace to any other hyperspace square, Battle Zone 1, 2, or 3. You select a character for battle and the silver counter is moved based upon a die roll, thus selecting your weapon for the battle.<br/><br/>The ring of weapons and devices is only used during battle and challenges.<br/><br/>The rules contain sections for &quot;How to play with 3 Players&quot; and &quot;How to play with 2 Players&quot;<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": {"32212": "Games Team First Edition"}, "name": "Doctor Who: Battle for the Universe", "playingtime": "45", "boardgamemechanic": {"2035": "Roll / Spin and Move"}, "average": "4.31757", "usersrated": "37", "boardgamesubdomain": {"4666": "Abstract Games"}, "boardgamefamily": {"5705": "TV Series: Dr. Who"}}, "3832": {"boardgamedesigner": {"1546": {"name": "Doug Borresen"}}, "poll": {}, "name": "Search for Poseidon's Gold", "playingtime": "60", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": {"2001": "Action Point Allowance System"}, "yearpublished": "2002", "usersrated": "12", "boardgamefamily": {"5607": "3D Games"}, "maxplayers": "4", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic11320_t.jpg", "average": "6.11667", "statistics": {}, "boardgamepublisher": {"881": {"name": "Wilcot Group"}}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic11320.jpg", "maxplaytime": "60", "boardgamecategory": {"1022": {"name": "Adventure"}}, "age": "10", "minplaytime": "60", "description": "In Search for Poseidon's Gold, up to four players engage in an ocean battle to see which player can collect the most gold and win the competition!

There are 66 cards in the deck, which consists of ranks 0-9 (four of ranks 0-8 and nine 9's) and 3 different types of action cards (9 &quot;Exchange&quot;, 7 &quot;Spy&quot;, and 5 &quot;2 X draw&quot;). Four cards are dealt face down to each player so that no player knows the values of her cards. The four cards are then arranged in a row and each player may briefly look at her outer two cards. A player's turn consists of drawing a card from the top of the draw pile or discard pile. If the player drew from the draw pile, there are several possible actions: If it is a number card, she may replace one of her face down cards with it (placing it face down) or she may simply discard it. If it is an action card, she may carry out the action or ignore the action. If a player draws the top card of the discard pile, she must replace one of her face down cards with it (placed face down). A player may knock at the end of her turn meaning that each other player has one more turn before the round is over. When the round ends, players turn over their cards and add up their values. The player with the lowest total value wins. Generally the game is played with as many rounds as there are players. Player interaction comes in the form of the action cards. The 'Exchange' card allows a player to exchange one of his cards with one of his opponents. The 'Spy' card allows a player to look at one of his own cards. Finally the &quot;2X look&quot; card allows a player to look at the top card of the draw pile, then keep it or throw it away. If she throws it away, she must use the next card in the draw pile.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": {"25578": "999 games Dutch Edition"}, "average": "6.17473", "name": "Rat-a-Tat Cat", "playingtime": "10", "boardgamemechanic": {"2041": "Card Drafting"}, "age": "6", "usersrated": "2026", "boardgamesubdomain": {"4665": "Children's Games"}, "boardgamefamily": {"14694": "Animals: Beavers"}}, "3838": {"boardgamedesigner": {"1549": {"name": "Frank Bustamante"}}, "average": "6.37846", "poll": {}, "name": "Firestorm", "playingtime": "60", "minplayers": "2", "yearpublished": "2001", "usersrated": "52", "boardgamefamily": {"22783": "Admin: Better Description Needed!"}, "maxplayers": "6", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3041264_t.jpg", "boardgameartist": {"13307": "Dennis Calero"}, "statistics": {}, "boardgamesubdomain": {"4667": "Customizable Games"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3041264.jpg", "maxplaytime": "60", "boardgamepublisher": {"884": {"name": "Third World Games"}}, "boardgamecategory": {"1002": {"name": "Card Game"}}, "age": "12", "minplaytime": "60", "description": "A collectible card game (CCG) of galactic conquest and exploration.

The TFG designers transported this &quot;theme&quot; into a board game which plays like a wargame: future Nazis against future mutants. The names of all protagonists have been changed to avoid copyright infringement, but the game clearly takes its slightly tongue-in-cheek approach directly from the book. One asks why this bittersweet parody has actually to be played as a game, but everybody can decide for him/herself I guess...<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "1", "boardgameversion": {"29027": "Task Force Games edition"}, "name": "4th Reich", "playingtime": "120", "boardgamemechanic": {"2026": "Hex-and-Counter"}, "average": "4.67925", "usersrated": "53", "boardgamesubdomain": {"4664": "Wargames"}, "age": "12"}, "3884": {"boardgamedesigner": {"61": {"name": "James Ernest"}}, "average": "5.10938", "poll": {}, "name": "Mana Burn", "playingtime": "45", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": {"2040": "Hand Management"}, "yearpublished": "1998", "usersrated": "32", "maxplayers": "8", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1296896_t.jpg", "boardgameartist": {"61": "James Ernest"}, "statistics": {}, "boardgamepublisher": {"899": {"name": "Andon Unlimited"}}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1296896.jpg", "boardgameversion": {"264065": "First edition"}, "maxplaytime": "45", "boardgamecategory": {"1010": {"name": "Fantasy"}}, "age": "10", "minplaytime": "45", "description": "You and your opponents represent powerful wizards battling to complete their collections of Magic(tm) cards.

Every 3 turns this disk turns and the wind will be coming from a new direction. A ship always moves in a straight line that can be at a diagonal. If it is sailing in the direction of the wind it must move 4 spaces. If in a diagonal with the wind it must move 5 spaces. If perpendicular to the wind movement is 3 spaces. If diagonal against the wind movement is 2 spaces and if against the wind 1 space. The wind rotates in a rigid sequence so you can always plan what your ship will be doing. If a ship runs onto land it is sunk. A ship can stop short of its full movement if it is in a harbor square of which each island has one. On the outer islands this is where a galleon picks up treasures and each may carry up to 3. The board wraps around on itself so if a ship sails off an edge it reappears on the opposite side of the board.<br/><br/>There are 6 dark areas on the seas that can become storms. The start player rolls 2 die at the beginning of his turn and puts a marker on the corresponding areas. Ships cannot enter these and ships that are in these areas cannot move.<br/><br/>Each player also has a frigate. Frigates attempt to pass over another ship, regardless of the type, which will sink it. A sunken ship will always reappear at that player&rsquo;s island at the start of his next turn. Frigates may not dock at harbors so they cannot end their movement short when passing over one. Ships sunk have their treasures returned to the bank.<br/><br/>You play until a player has collected an agreed to amount of treasures. The rules suggest 8 to 20.<br/><br/>The rules take up 3 small pages of which half the page is rules in another language. There are also 4 illustrations in the rules so you end up with about 1 page of rules. Some things are very vague though. How the Disk of Winds is used is not very clear. Here logic can get you through. The islands in the center are not marked as belonging to anyone so I have always had each player put a treasure on one to claim it. We have also played that the islands belong to no one player and you just need to get you treasures to an island.

Other cards can provide temporary boosts while in play (for example, different guns to improve your firing range) and special one-time effects to help you or hinder your opponents (such as Beer to restore health, or Barrels to hide behind during a shootout). A horse is useful for keeping your distance from unruly neighbors, while the Winchester can hit a target at range 5.

The game starts in December of 1944 with the Ardennes Offensive (a variant allows the German player to skip this and save his strength). As a two-player game, it is interesting in that each player plays both an Allied army (Western Allies or Soviet Union) AND a German army (Western Front or Eastern Front). This forces each player to play offense and defense. The player playing the Western Allies and Eastern Germans has a very challenging task. The Western Germans have good defensive terrain (the Rhine river and Westwall defenses), while the Eastern Germans have weak units, a long front, very poor defensive terrain and they face a large Soviet and Yugoslav army. The only real advantage enjoyed by the East German player is the lack of victory points to be gained in the East, and the slow Soviet replacement rate. The Western Alllied units are very fast moving, but they don't usually get a chance to exploit this until the very end of the game (at best).<br/><br/>The map is the same size as most SPI Quadrigames or folio games and has similar graphics. Cities are rated as 1 or 2 victory points, with Berlin worth 10. A line down the middle of Germany cannot be crossed (in the 2-player game), which makes Berlin the only city which can be captured by the Western Allies or the Soviets (ahistorical, but essential to the game's concept). Units are corps for the Germans and Western Allies and corps, armies, or fronts for the Soviet player. Each unit is rated for attack, defense and movement. Combat is decided by an odds-based combat results table and a die roll. Combat results include various combinations of retreat and elimination (there are no step losses, disruption or anything like this). Eliminated units can be replaced, but very slowly and (for some players) with the weakest available unit coming back first.<br/><br/>The game includes variants for 3- and 4-player versions where the Germans are played by 1 or 2 players, and a &quot;red star/ white star&quot; scenario where the Western Allies and Soviets fight it out with some help from the remnants of the German army.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": {"147103": "Command Japan edition"}, "average": "7.06769", "name": "Battle for Germany", "playingtime": "180", "boardgamemechanic": {"2072": "Dice Rolling"}, "age": "12", "usersrated": "460", "boardgamesubdomain": {"4664": "Wargames"}, "boardgamefamily": {"10643": "Country: Germany"}}, "3987": {"boardgamedesigner": {"3": {"name": "(Uncredited)"}}, "poll": {}, "name": "The VANITPL8 Game", "playingtime": "30", "minplayers": "3", "boardgamemechanic": {"2055": "Paper-and-Pencil"}, "yearpublished": "2001", "usersrated": "0", "maxplayers": "0", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic244589_t.jpg", "average": "0", "statistics": {}, "boardgamepublisher": {"925": {"name": "Dirnea Inc"}}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic244589.jpg", "maxplaytime": "30", "boardgamecategory": {"1079": {"name": "Humor"}}, "age": "0", "minplaytime": "30", "description": "The VANITPL8 Game takes the English language and pushes the phrase&quot;creative license&quot; to the limit.

The players indicate their answer by putting face down either their Fact Answer card or Crap Answer card.  The Reader then determines which player was the first to put their Answer card down.  Once all of the Answer cards are down, the player who was first to answer turns over their Answer card.  If the answer is correct, they receive 2 tokens from the middle pile.  The Reader will then ask everyone to turn their Answer cards over.  All other players with the correct answer will receive 1 token.  All players with the wrong answer (including the player who puts their Answer card down first) will have to put 1 token back in the middle pile.<br/>The Reader&rsquo;s turn is complete when all 3 questions have been read.  The Question card is then returned, face down, to the bottom of the Question card pile.<br/><br/>During the game you will randomly draw Rush Hour cards.  The Reader who picks up a Rush Hour card may nominate any player to answer the Rush Hour questions.  Once the nomination has been made, the egg timer is turned over and the Reader begins to read the questions.  The aim is to have all 5 questions asked and answered within the time limit so that both Reader and the answering player have a chance to win as many extra tokens as possible.<br/><br/>There are two ways to win Fact or Crap.<br/>- The game ends when all tokens from the middle pile are gone.
