Each turn consists of random events (generated by die rolls), followed by allocating of 8 new &quot;factors&quot; to their nation's attributes, followed by actions on the board.  There are strategic resources (oil, gold, coal, ore, and rare minerals) which affect the allocation of factors and/or movement on the board.  Combat can occur between nations using military factors from the nations' attributes, resolution done by drawing as many numbered chits for losses as there are opposing military factors.

This is Crescendo of Doom... a gripping game of tactical combat set against the seemingly invincible juggernauts of war-torn Europe. Setting the scene for the colossal struggle of the titans which will follow, Crescendo is, nonetheless, far more than a simple prelude to Barbarossa. While fur&shy;ther refining the innovations brought forth in its highly successful predecessors Squad Leader and Cross of Iron, Crescendo breaks yet even more ground in the realm of realistic tactical combat without disturbing the underlying basic simplicity of a universally acclaimed game system. Crescendo is a welcome extension for the Squad Leader enthusiast even before he contemplates a single new counter.<br/><br/>But Crescendo of Doom offers far more than that. Complete armor, ordnance, and infantry units are provided for Poland, Belgium, Finland. and a host of other minor neutrals including Elite, Line, and Reservist formations for all nationalities. In graphic detail far superior to any narrative account, you will see for yourself how the outnumbered German panzers defeated the superior armor of the French tanks.

Air Strike provides 32 new aircraft for the Air Superiority system, including: the Warthog (A-10s), F-1 5 Strike Eagle, Harrier II, Alpha Jet, SU-25, and MIG-27. Six new multi-color maps provide the varied and treacherous terrain over which players must find their targets. Included are 480 counters, representing everything from radar sites to the most modern air-defense missile and gun systems in service today. Trucks, tanks, infantry, and other targets are provided as well; but remember, on today's battlefield, what can be shot at can shoot back. Air Strike includes 25 scenarios suitable for solitaire, two-player, or multi-player play. Ranging from the Mideast to Germany, from Afghanistan to Africa, these scenarios provide players with a wide variety of complex and interesting situations. Several of these can be played both as solitaire and as multi-player simulations. The briefing booklet helps bring players up to date on the weapons and aircraft included in this game. It is a helpful aid to learning the abilities and limitations of the aircraft and weapons depicted in Air Strike.&quot; Game Components 480 die-cut counters, six maps, one rules booklet with aircraft briefings and game scenarios, one data card booklet, one set of game charts&quot;<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "1", "boardgameversion": {"28484": "GDW edition"}, "average": "7.01197", "name": "Air Strike", "playingtime": "60", "boardgamemechanic": {"2026": "Hex-and-Counter"}, "age": "12", "boardgameexpansion": {}, "usersrated": "188", "boardgamesubdomain": {"4664": "Wargames"}, "expands": {"3613": {"name": "Air Superiority"}}, "boardgamefamily": {"138": "Air Power"}}, "3615": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic10904.jpg", "poll": {}, "boardgamedesigner": {"1081": {"name": "Jim Dunnigan"}}, "statistics": {}, "yearpublished": "1978", "maxplayers": "2", "boardgameartist": {"1030": "Redmond A.

As an expansion, much of the 1984 edition of Axis &amp; Allies was needed to play this expansion.<br/><br/>The World at War 1939-1945 2nd Edition, published in 1993, balanced some of the gameplay and added some new ideas but retained the same glossy 24&quot;x36&quot; color map and pieces.<br/><br/>The 3rd Edition, published in 1996, continued to improve gameplay balance and added Atomic Bombs to the technology development. After developing A-bomb technology, players spend 6 IPCs to buy one, which must be delivered via a Heavy Bomber (also a required technology). Damage to a land or sea zone by an A-bomb eliminates 20 IPCs worth of enemy units and renders the territory desolate (-5 IPC value, with +1 restoration each turn for two turns), causing devastation to the economy as well as military of an opposing player.<br/><br/>Now in its 4th edition, The World at War includes a hardback map (replacing the poster-paper map of earlier editions), with some minor rule revisions over the 3rd ed, and this is a mature game in it's own right with differences significant enough for any A&amp;A fan to appreciate, beyond all of the &quot;official&quot; editions published in recent years.<br/><br/>There are new unit types, such as Destoyers, Paratroopers, SS Panzers and SS Panzergrenadiers, Russian Guards, Partisans.

After the first segment of a turn, only towers made of two game pieces may be moved. Each tower is broken down during its move, and one of its pieces may be used to build a new tower on another square. Intelligent use of this move technique can lead to &quot;nuclear chain reactions&quot;, in which up to five towers are involved. There must never be more than one tower on the board at one time. Any tower on the board must be moved during the following turn segment by the player whose piece is on top. The game ends with the achievement of an agreed-upon number of points.<br/><br/>The game was originally published in 1989 in a tiny cardboard box by Ferdinand de Cassan.

It is packaged in a slipcase box that includes one 60 x 52 cm map, 240 full-color die cut counters, one standard and scenario rules booklet, one historical commentary booklet, and two player aid cards.  Game turns are one year each: after collecting silver and/or receiving it from Rome, you can pay your troops, recruit tribal levies, and perform other administrative functions. After that comes the Operations Phase. During it, each force (one or more Field Armies, Tribal Levies, etc) can perform certain operations, using Operation Points (OP). These actions include combat, diplomacy (you can try to control any area through diplomacy), besiege cities, pillage, recruit mercenaries, or build colonies. At the end of the Operations Phase, forces retire to winter quarters.<br/><br/>The most outstanding features of the game are the Prestige Point Level and the differences between Regular and Irregular warfare.  The Prestige Level (PP) simulates the prestige of the civilized armies (Punic, Romans, Sertorians) among the Iberian tribes, and the tendency of the latter to switch to the side that seems to be winning... Certain results of the CRTs add or decrease the PP level of each side. Then, if your PP level is above 2, you have positive die roll modifiers on the Diplomacy Table. And vice versa if your PP level is 0 or lower.  Leaders play a key role since their modifiers are applied to retreat before combat, diplomacy, all kinds of combat, operations, interception, etc. Leaders are rated for Military and Diplomatic skills (The highest is Sertorius, with +3 +3). Roman leaders (Praetors, one each for Hispania Citerior and Hispania Ulterior) are changed randomly each year when they're elected by the Senate of Rome. If you have quality leaders, your chances of avoid/provoke combat are higher, and vice versa.<br/><br/>The irregular, &quot;hit and run&quot; tactics of the inhabitants of the peninsula characterized the Roman conquest and were the cause why the Romans took 200 years to completely control all of Hispania. All combat units have Regular and Irregular Combat factors. The attacker can always choose which CRT he is going to use. The idea here was to simulate the asymmetrical war fought out between the Roman/Punic invaders and the native peoples. If you can impose your style of fighting, (the other can not avoid combat) then you have the edge over the enemy.<br/><br/>The game is played in scenarios. There are 9, from the Punic reconquest of Iberia (237-221 BCE) to the Cantabria campaigns of Caesar Augustus (24-19 BCE). There are a set of common rules for all the scenarios, plus specific rules for each scenario. There are fast playing scenarios (such as the Roman Civil War, or the Cantabrian wars) that can be played in two-three hours, and other that take 6-10 hour of play (up to 17 turns, such as Cato's campaign of 195 BCE, or the II Lusitanian War).<br/><br/>Each scenario has its own Random Events Table. Some of the Random Events included are: plague, Excellent/Bad Crops, Tribal Rebellions galore, bribing enemy mercenaries, Numidian rebellion (for the II Punic War scenario), Alliance with Mithridates (Sertorius War scenario), and more.<br/><br/>Optional rules include assassination of enemy leaders (you must spend Operations Points and Treasury Points for that), Rivalry between Iberian tribes (The Romans took advantage of this to apply the &quot;divide and conquer&quot; routine), Mountain redoubts (Mons Vidius, Mons Medulius...), or troop upgrade.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": {"85657": "First edition"}, "average": "6.04268", "name": "Iberos", "playingtime": "360", "boardgamemechanic": {"2001": "Action Point Allowance System"}, "age": "12", "usersrated": "41", "boardgamesubdomain": {"4664": "Wargames"}, "boardgamefamily": {"5606": "Ancient Rome"}}, "3635": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3196867.jpg", "poll": {}, "boardgamedesigner": {"3": {"name": "(Uncredited)"}}, "statistics": {}, "yearpublished": "1993", "maxplayers": "6", "age": "12", "boardgamepublisher": {"328": {"name": "Horn Abbot Ltd."}}, "maxplaytime": "20", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3196867_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "20", "boardgamecategory": {"1002": {"name": "Card Game"}}, "description": "Trivial Pursuit's Country Music edition.

Take their pieces, control the board, dominate the elements, win the game.  Are you up to it?<br/><br/>Elemental has no set up time and you can teach a friend the rules of play in just 10 minutes (in fact, all the moves are printed right on the board).  Like all great games, the rules are simple but the complex strategies are limited only by your creativity and resourcefulness.<br/><br/>Game Components:<br/>11&times;11 inch Full Color Game Board<br/>4 Full Color Reference cards<br/>Scads of double-sided full color playing pieces<br/>rules of Play Card<br/>Storage Bag<br/><br/>Online Play<br/><br/><br/>     CCG Workshop (no longer available)<br/><br/><br/>"}, "3645": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic12168.jpg", "is_expanded_by": {"38217": {"name": "The Overrunning of the West"}}, "poll": {}, "boardgamedesigner": {"1479": {"name": "Nick Schuessler"}}, "statistics": {}, "yearpublished": "1985", "maxplayers": "2", "boardgamepublisher": {"352": {"name": "Task Force Games"}}, "maxplaytime": "360", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic12168_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "360", "boardgamecategory": {"1019": {"name": "Wargame"}}, "description": "Planned to be a nine-part series of games covering all of WWII based on the B.H.

Crawling around on the floor, and spatial skills for estimating firing angles make the game unlike most of its cousins.<br/><br/>A playing area of perhaps 8 feet square is the minimum requirement, 12 feet square is better, with a bare floor or very short carpet. Two or more players plop down their starships on the floor. Everyone plots their moves simultaneously, allocating limited engine energy to some combination of movement, shields and weapons. Moves are executed simultaneously. Weapons have varying arcs of fire, and shield strength is independent on the four sides of the ship, so clever move plotting is critical to victory.<br/><br/>After movement, there is simultaneous combat. Shooting is the unusual element of the mechanics. Each starship has a compass card, with a silhouette in the middle. The player must estimate the exact correct angle to fire at, stretch out a string from the center of their card, and hope that their chosen angle intersects the silhouette of the chosen opponent.<br/><br/>Damage is logged in points against different capabilities of the starship, allowing for the damaged or crippled ships familiar from the Star Trek TV episodes and films. Different weapons and angles of fire allow for unique abilities for different races and starships.<br/><br/>The game was originally published in 1972 as Star Trek Battle Manual (this was not licensed and therefore was not sold for long).<br/><br/>The closely related Alien Space Battle Manual came out in 1973, offering a completely different set of alien races and somewhat different hit/damage rules, but allowing for interplay between the two different games.<br/><br/>"}, "3668": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic10342.jpg", "poll": {}, "boardgamedesigner": {"1554": {"name": "Tom Braunlich"}}, "statistics": {}, "yearpublished": "2000", "maxplayers": "4", "age": "7", "boardgamepublisher": {"229": {"name": "Decipher"}}, "maxplaytime": "30", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic10342_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "30", "boardgamecategory": {"1002": {"name": "Card Game"}}, "description": "A self-contained spin-off of the Star Trek Customizable Card Game from Decipher, Tribbles is a fairly straightforward card game where you are trying to empty your 7 card hand in order to score points (&quot;tribbles&quot;) that you have been able to play. Each card represents a certain quantity of &quot;tribbles&quot; (1, 10, 1000, or 10,000.) The game play follows a sequential order, with each player needing to play the next higher value of tribble out of his hand than the one played immediately before.  If no such card is held, the player must pass and draw a card from his personal deck. There are also optional effects on each card, some reminiscent of Uno (among them Skip and Reverse), that vary the play sequence, score some special points, or allow a player to discard a card. A round ends when either a player is out of hand cards or all but one of the players are out of cards in their deck. Only the player who goes out scores points for his Tribbles played that round. Five rounds make a game. The player who scores the most tribbles in those five rounds is the winner.<br/><br/>The game provides four pre-constructed decks totaling 112 cards, which are color coded to fit a theme. These cards can be interchanged to create different decks. To make the game even more customizable, &quot;tribbles&quot; cards from the ST:CCG expansion set &quot;The Trouble With Tribbles&quot; are compatible with this game. These cards can increase the highest tribbles card to 100,000, plus add a new special ability (a bonus for collecting a specific set of cards) and different combinations than those included in the boxed set.<br/><br/>Also included in the game are reference cards which list the makeup of each standard deck and explain what the special effects are.

It pitted the forces of Brian Boru, high king of Ireland, against a Norse-Irish alliance comprising the forces of Sigtrygg Silkbeard, king of Dublin, M&aacute;el M&oacute;rda mac Murchada, king of Leinster, and a Viking contingent led by Sigurd of Orkney and Brodir of Mann. It lasted from sunrise to sunset, and ended in a rout of the Viking and Leinster forces. It is estimated that between 7,000 and 10,000 men were killed. Although Brian's forces were victorious, Brian himself was killed, as were his son Murchad and his grandson Toirdelbach. Leinster king M&aacute;el M&oacute;rda and Viking leaders Sigurd and Brodir were also slain.<br/><br/>Game from Strategy &amp; Tactics magazine #162 (along with Saipan) depicting a long forgotten but interesting subject.

The game is consequently slower to conduct than a board wargame such as Tactics II. For miniature wargamers who felt that the amount of detail was excessive, Reese and Tucker recommended their earlier Fast Rules (1970) although that set covered WWII only.<br/>Tractics require the use of a judge.Since players are unaware of their enemies locations the pieces are placed on the map only when they are detected or the march to an open view.<br/>The tanks in tractics have a 30% chance to hit a target which in essence means rolling at least a 15 on the 20 sided die.

Play begins with the players inserting the sticks through the tube and then pouring the marbles into the top of the tube. The sticks act as a web that block the marbles at the top of the tube. At this point, the players begin to carefully remove the sticks one by one. The goal is to get the stick out without making any of the marbles sitting on top fall through. If any marbles fall through, the person who made them fall collects them. Once the last marble has fallen, players count their collected marbles, and the player with the fewest marbles wins the game.<br/><br/>Ker Plunk was first published by the Ideal Toy Company in 1967, then later by Mattel and finally by Tyco in 1991. Mattel also published a variant of this game called &ldquo;Super Ker-Plunk!&rdquo;<br/><br/>Re-implemented by:<br/><br/>    Toy Story Ker Plunk!<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": {"348360": "Arxon first edition"}, "average": "4.76801", "name": "Ker Plunk", "playingtime": "20", "age": "5", "usersrated": "971", "boardgamesubdomain": {"4665": "Children's Games"}, "boardgamefamily": {"7178": "Animals: Apes / Monkeys"}}, "3730": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic15630.jpg", "boardgameimplementation": {"216347": "Statis Pro Baseball Advanced"}, "poll": {}, "boardgamedesigner": {"2137": {"name": "Jim Barnes"}}, "statistics": {}, "yearpublished": "1971", "maxplayers": "2", "boardgamepublisher": {"5": {"name": "The Avalon Hill Game Co"}}, "maxplaytime": "20", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic15630_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "20", "boardgamecategory": {"1002": {"name": "Card Game"}}, "description": "Baseball game that is played using charts and pitcher and batter cards that accurately represent stats for real-life players.

At the opposite corner of the board is the entrance to the cave. Every turn each player rolls a D6 to move. Players must move their pawns in a clockwise direction along the edge of the board upon a narrow track. At the left-hand corner is a space marked &ldquo;W&uuml;ste&rdquo; (Desert). Each pawn must stop there. To leave the desert a player must roll an odd number. Upon reaching the far corner players must pause on the corner before opening the mountain.<br/><br/>The heart of the game happens within the cave. The cave is large, dominating the game mat. Up to 40 square cards can be placed face down, one per space, within the cave. This number will be reduced if the optional obstacles and tea light are used. The cards show the same back, depicting a vase. When a pawn ends its move on a vase the active player may inspect it, and claim the treasure shown. In addition, the player rolls a die to see if they break the vase. If not, they replace the treasure card with a blank card showing the same vase on the back. In this way the game board becomes depleted of treasures and filled up with worthless empty vases, or voids where vases were broken.<br/><br/>Complicating the player&rsquo;s lives is the band of 40 thieves. Really it is just the black pawn, but he travels the board seeking to prevent the players from absconding with the treasures. Combat slightly favors the black pawn, encouraging all the players to give him a wide berth.<br/><br/>As players collect more treasures, they become encumbered, and forfeit movement points as their load increases. This allows the black pawn to possibly catch a player&rsquo;s pawn. However, some of the treasure cards are empty backpacks and sacks, allowing a pawn to carry more treasure before becoming encumbered. Further, the black pawn is slow, rolling a special die with a top value of four.<br/><br/>Once a pawn has escaped from the cave, he must continue clockwise upon the track along the edge of the board. At the right-hand corner is a space marked BAGHDAD. Each pawn must stop in Baghdad, and may only leave on the roll of an even number. Should the pawn fail to leave, one of its hard-earned treasures will be lost. Staying in Baghdad is expensive! Eventually the pawn will escape Baghdad, and travel back to the starting corner.<br/><br/>To win the game the player must have more treasures than any other player, and they must also have more treasures than what remains within the cave.<br/><br/>"}, "3786": {"boardgamedesigner": {"5": {"name": "Jean du Po\u00ebl"}}, "average": "6", "statistics": {}, "name": "Trapper-Company", "playingtime": "0", "minplayers": "2", "yearpublished": "2001", "usersrated": "1", "maxplayers": "6", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic11188_t.jpg", "boardgameartist": {"3": "(Uncredited)"}, "boardgamepublisher": {"6": {"name": "Historien Spiele Galerie (Historien Spielegalerie)"}}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic11188.jpg", "boardgameversion": {"248202": "First Edition"}, "maxplaytime": "0", "poll": {}, "age": "10", "minplaytime": "0", "description": "Players are fur dealers, who try to trap as many furs as possible and then return to Quebec to sell those furs.

They will describe things like a worlds terrain, the units available, their strengths and weaknesses, the climate, special rules that modify combat resolution, new rules that cover things like horse back ridding, vector space ship movement, and just how to handle a Vogon star destroyer that has wandered into your Medieval Fantasy realm.<br/><br/>By building off the same Core Rules and by using the Gameworlds you have created, or have been created by others, you can then build up Gamesets to cover the specific events to play out. For example, by using the CGME Core Rules coupled with the CGME Space Gameworld you could build a Gameset to play interstellar battles, trade wars across colonial star systems, early 1970's Soviet vs. US orbital conflicts, and many more.<br/><br/>If a Gameworld does not cover all the details you need to play out your event, you are free to haul off and add in what you need, modify what is there and hopefully make it available so others can use it.<br/><br/>CGME is freely available in Volume 1 Issue 1 of Countermoves<br/><br/>"}, "3793": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic57754.jpg", "poll": {}, "boardgamedesigner": {"3": {"name": "(Uncredited)"}}, "statistics": {}, "yearpublished": "1986", "maxplayers": "4", "age": "6", "boardgamepublisher": {"1731": {"name": "Estrela"}}, "maxplaytime": "10", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic57754_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "10", "boardgamecategory": {"1032": {"name": "Action / Dexterity"}}, "description": "Pig pong combines the ever popular &quot;sport&quot; of ping pong with, well, plastic pigs.<br/><br/>The contents are 1 net, 2 scoring tokens (shaped like pigs), 1 serving trough, 6 puff balls and 4 pigs.<br/><br/>The general idea of the game is to have two teams, on either side of the plastic net, squeeze the plastic pigs.

Each turn players plan in advance six moves for their caravan, trying to second-guess what other players will do to their best advantage.  Delivering goods allows the player to increase their influence in one of three separate categories - each delivery allows you to advance your position in two of the three categories.  Religious influence is marked by the number and value of your stupas in buildings on the board, political influence is marked by the number of sherpas you have in the regions between the paths on the board, and economical influence is marked by the total number of yaks you have on your delivery disks.<br/><br/>The scoring is unique to the game, in the 4 player game anyway (the player count the game is primarily designed to be played with).  To determine the winner you first score up religious influence, and the player with the least religious influence is eliminated, and their remaining pieces are removed from the board.  Next the player with the least political influence is eliminated.  The remaining two players decide the winner by who has the greatest economic influence.

The board is a hollow box with irregularly shaped wooden spacers between the top and bottom. The game board is shaken during the game setup to randomize the location of the wooden spacers (oil deposits). The playing surface is divided into 60 real estate parcels, each of which has from one to 10 drilling sites. Players bid to lease parcels, and once they acquire one or more leases, they may drill on their leased tracts at a cost of $10,000 per hole.  This cost of drilling is lost if the result is a dry hole, but there is a large payoff for successful wells (&quot;gushers&quot;). Players begin with a stake of $300,000. The game ends when a player accumulates $1 million.<br/><br/>Although the game is largely a contest of luck, there is some strategy. Successful wells tend to be clustered. Thus tracts that are contiguous to parcels on which there are successful wells are more highly valued. Furthermore, because gushers produce revenue for the owner with each turn, successful wells obtained early in the game are considerably more valuable than those obtained near the end.<br/><br/>Play proceeds in turns, and each player upon his turn may designate one or two unleased tracts for bidding or he may choose to drill if he has previously acquired one or more leases and has undrilled sites.  Players may sell or trade leases and drilling sites, and they may form partnerships to acquire leases or share the cost of drilling.<br/><br/>In a typical game setup, approximately 15% to 20% of the drilling sites will be gushers. A game generally requires about 20 complete turns.<br/><br/>Early 1940's editions employ a 20.5&quot; x 20.5&quot; game board; these feature boxes with deep, dark colors and silvered print.

Each of these characters has a team of four followers, Davros and four Daleks, The Doctor and his assistants, etc. There are also many other characters in the game that may be recruited. By collecting these characters each player tries to build a powerful team. By a series of battles and challenges, players fight for control of the universe until only two players remain and a final great battle decides the victor.<br/><br/>Characters<br/>There are four main characters in the game, each having a team of four loyal assistants. These are: 1) The Doctor and his four assistants, Tegan, Ace, Romana and K9; 2) Davros and four Daleks; 3) The Master and his evil Time Lords, Morbius, Borusa, Omega and Rani; 4) The Cyber Controller with four Cybermen.<br/><br/>The remaining cards comprise three Ice Warriors, three Mutants, two Marshmen, The Black Guardian, Linx, Shockeye and Garron.

The other players, in order of score, select one of the main characters. The Doctor takes the four white counters - these represent his four regenerations, or lives. The other players take the appropriate colored counters. The Master - black, Davros -  red, etc. Place the silver counter on the ring at the top of the board.

This is the Gamewright version.<br/><br/>1996 Mensa Select<br/><br/>Republished 2002 by Amigo as Biberbande:<br/><br/>Biberbande is a card game for Ages 6 and up, the object of which is to improve your initial unknown 4-card hand so that you have a lower sum of cards than the other players. There are 66 cards in the deck, which consists of ranks 0-9 (four of ranks 0-8 and nine 9's) and 3 different types of action cards (9 &quot;Exchange&quot;, 7 &quot;Spy&quot;, and 5 &quot;2 X draw&quot;). Four cards are dealt face down to each player so that no player knows the values of her cards. The four cards are then arranged in a row and each player may briefly look at her outer two cards. A player's turn consists of drawing a card from the top of the draw pile or discard pile. If the player drew from the draw pile, there are several possible actions: If it is a number card, she may replace one of her face down cards with it (placing it face down) or she may simply discard it. If it is an action card, she may carry out the action or ignore the action. If a player draws the top card of the discard pile, she must replace one of her face down cards with it (placed face down). A player may knock at the end of her turn meaning that each other player has one more turn before the round is over. When the round ends, players turn over their cards and add up their values. The player with the lowest total value wins. Generally the game is played with as many rounds as there are players. Player interaction comes in the form of the action cards.
