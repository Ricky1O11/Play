A world that was manufactured for some as yet unknown purpose. Here you will encounter hostile aliens like the Kelrath and the Chezbah, and those that will seek your aid, like the Scimrahn. Races that appear human but are different from us in many ways. Then there are those that hide in the shadows, like the giant Tanroc Fredar, and the thing called Loc, revered as a god by some, despised as a demon by others.<br/><br/>A small group of explorers from earth are the first to venture into this vast world. Some looking for a better life, some for the adventure, and some looking to strike it rich in the amazing resources that are available.<br/><br/>The Artifact is a Role Playing Game that each player will take part in a unfolding world. As members, they will have the opportunity to add to and influence the world around them. Updates will periodically be posted to the site, in addition to member contributions. The main portion of the game is a two hundred and six page book that is downloadable in PDF format (viewable with the Adobe Acrobat Reader that is available for free). Several sourcebooks are also available to download for free. Hard Copy books are also available for purchase.<br/><br/>The Artifact is all about survival in an alien world.<br/>That&rsquo;s why Survival Challenges were created as a GM tool for telling this kind of story. Players roll to defeat the challenge instead of rolling to stave off defeat.<br/><br/>The Artifact is all about science.<br/>That&rsquo;s why Tech Challenges were created. Players only have to propose how their characters might try and solve the puzzle and their character&rsquo;s knowledge provides the solution. This becomes very enjoyable for the players because they&rsquo;re not just rolling dice, they&rsquo;re telling the story of how the puzzle will be solved and then rolling to see how it worked. Then the tool provides input for the GM about how the problem reacts to the PC&rsquo;s efforts making things more interesting because the puzzle is interactive.<br/><br/>The Artifact is about the teeming masses.<br/>In most games, the PCs work alone. In The Artifact, most of the time the PCs are part of organizations that support them. <br/>That&rsquo;s why Infantry Combat is included in the rules, so the players can be in charge of their subordinates and directly manage them easily. The GM can also more easily handle larger groups as easily as handling a single NPC.<br/><br/>"}, "137508": {"statistics": {}, "name": "Power Rangers: Time Force", "videogamemode": {"2149": "Single-Player"}, "videogameversion": {"198240": "North American Game Boy Color edition"}, "average": "0", "videogametheme": {"2468": "Children's"}, "usersrated": "0", "videogamegenre": {"2147": "Action"}, "videogameplatform": {"4424": "Game Boy Color"}, "poll": {}, "description": "The five Time Force Rangers travel though time to stop enemies.

She's tired of doing all the work and feeling unfulfilled. Flo quits her job, wishing she could work someplace else. She spots a run down old diner, which she buys. Gameplay involves seating customers and guiding Flo around the restaurant to serve customers. If enough money is earned after each level, play progresses to the next. As the game progresses Flo updates the dilapidated restaurant she begins with and builds three further restaurants, which provide new settings.<br/>Gameplay centers around catering to customers within a time limit to gather as much money as possible. Flo can be moved around the restaurant to complete tasks. As customers arrive in the restaurant, the player must drag and drop them onto a table, where they sit down and read menus. Then the player must guide Flo to the table to take their order, which must be taken to the service hatch. After the chef has prepared the meal, Flo must deliver the food. When the customers are finished eating they must be taken a check, at which point the customers leave a tip and their dishes on the table, departing the restaurant. The dishes must be cleared by Flo before the next set of customers can use the table. Each successful action earns the player points, performing the same action multiple times in a row earns the player a chain bonus, which is broken once a different action is performed.<br/><br/>Customers have a series of hearts over their heads that indicate their mood. The longer the customer is forced to wait, the more hearts he or she loses. Each type of customer has different degrees of patience and tipping habits. Flo can perform various actions, such as talking to customers or serving them drinks, to revive these hearts. When customers lose all their hearts, they leave the restaurant, costing the player points. The goal of a level is earn a certain number of points. There are also expert point totals for advanced players to achieve.<br/>The game has two modes: Career mode, which follows the story of Flo, and Endless Shift, a survival mode in which the player must last as long as possible in a single level.<br/>In the Cooking Dash variation, the player actually prepares the food as opposed to bringing the order to the chef for him to prepare it.<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;Diner Dash&quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "137555": {"poll": {}, "name": "Jimmy the Greek Odds Maker Football", "playingtime": "60", "minplayers": "1", "boardgamemechanic": {"2020": "Simultaneous Action Selection"}, "yearpublished": "1974", "usersrated": "0", "boardgamefamily": {"5640": "Sports: American Football / Gridiron"}, "maxplayers": "2", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1563065_t.jpg", "average": "0", "statistics": {}, "boardgamepublisher": {"1241": {"name": "Aurora"}}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1563065.jpg", "boardgameversion": {"198301": "First Edition"}, "maxplaytime": "60", "boardgamecategory": {"1002": {"name": "Card Game"}}, "age": "8", "minplaytime": "60", "description": "The game is based on American football and used cards to determine the outcome of plays. The plastic board represents an American Football field with a scoreboard, 10 yard marker, football, and has identical player charts on each side of the field. There is an Action deck of cards (52 in 4 suits) and two scrimmage decks (52 in 4 suits each). The suits represent different offensive and defensive play options, long pass (heart), short pass (diamond), running play (spade), or line play (club). The Action deck is used for non-scrimmage and special plays. Each player uses one of the scrimmage decks for plays from scrimmage. The scrimmage decks have a number 2-14 inclusive and a suit on the front. The back also has the suit. This allows the player to decide what type of play to run from the back of the cards without knowing how strong the play will be.<br/><br/>For an example of a scrimmage play, assume the offensive player looks at the back of his deck and chooses long pass (heart). The defensive player chooses running defense (spade). Both players turn over their cards and show 10 of heart and 7 of spade for a +3. Cross reference +3 and spade on the long pass chart to see that this is a 16 yard gain.<br/><br/>There are also rules for field goals, interceptions, fumbles, penalties and options, fair catch, on-side kick, etc.<br/><br/>The Odds Maker wheel is used to handicap the people playing the game and uses the number of times they have played this game, age, did they play football, do they like football, and do they follow football.<br/><br/>"}, "137557": {"poll": {}, "name": "Onderweg!", "playingtime": "10", "minplayers": "2", "yearpublished": "0", "usersrated": "2", "maxplayers": "4", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1563840_t.jpg", "average": "6", "statistics": {}, "boardgamepublisher": {"7304": {"name": "Wolters Plantyn"}}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1563840.jpg", "boardgameversion": {"198303": "Dutch First Edition"}, "maxplaytime": "10", "boardgamecategory": {"1041": {"name": "Children's Game"}}, "age": "3", "minplaytime": "10", "description": "Toddlers put their first steps in strategic and logical thinking with this game.<br/><br/>They have to find the way home from the the playground as soon as possible, but of course there must first be fulfilled orders on the way...<br/><br/>In the game are 2 games included: The rescue &amp; Shopping<br/><br/>In 'The rescue' is a lot of misery on the go!

R. of the Congo. It is one of the most popular mancala games.<br/><br/>Songo is known for its rich orature of funny stories, which were recorded by the German anthropologist G&uuml;nter Tessmann (1884 - 1969) in 1907. The game is a popular mindsport in Africa. Songo competitions are held every weekend in Douala, Cameroon.<br/><br/>The game is promoted by the minister for culture and art and the president of the Republic of Gabon, Mr Omar Bongo Ondimba. There are plans to teach Songo at all the schools of the country. Over 200 Songo masters (called &quot;nti&quot;) attend every year a huge tournament in Libreville.<br/><br/>The Songo World Championship in the village of Oyop (South Cameroon) attracts famous players from many countries. The current world champion is the Gabonese Vivi Metou. Other strong players are Endel&eacute;, L&eacute;vy Megne-Masseko, Narcisse Nguema, Davy Obiang, Ta-Ndong, Moulouma, Kamsi, Romy Nguema, Zu&egrave; Allogo, and Desir&eacute; Meba Mefame.<br/><br/>Rules<br/><br/>Songo is played on a mancala board (&quot;mbek&quot;) of 2 x 7 holes. These holes are called &quot;nda&quot; (&quot;house&quot;). At each end there is a big store for the captured counters. Each house contains five stones called &quot;songo&quot; (&quot;pebble&quot;). A player controls the row on his side of the board.<br/><br/>On his turn a player distributes the contents of one of his holes, one by one, clockwise into the ensuing houses. The leftmost hole of a row may only be emptied, if if contains at least three stones unless it would be the only possible move. However, the hole may be emptied, if the move results in a capture or if the opponent has (a) nothing left in his holes and (b) it isn't possible to feed him with three or more stones.<br/><br/>If a hole contained 14 or more stones, it is skipped and all the player's own holes that follow. The remaining stones are only sown on the opponent's side. If the opponent has no stones left, he must be fed with at least seven stones. If this can't be done, he must get as many stones as possible.<br/><br/>A player must move at his turn. If the last stone falls in an opponent's hole, which contained one, two or three stones, its contents are captured together with the last stone (ie. two, three or four stones). If the previous-to-last stone also brought an opponent's house to two, three or four, these are captured as well, and so on. If 14, 21 or 28 stones were sown, only the last stone can be captured, but nothing else.<br/><br/>When a player has only one stone left in his row and this stone is in his leftmost hole, he captures it. If a move would captures all all an opponent's seeds, the capture is forfeited, and the seeds are instead left on the board. The game ends when a player cannot move. The stones that are still on the board are won by the player who moved last.<br/><br/>The player who captured most counters wins.

In the upper field of his game sheet, each player lays out a network (without letting his opponent see it) consisting of six lines - each of a different length, ranging from one to six grid unit lengths, inclusive. The lines must be drawn either horizontally or vertically, must be connected together (in any order), and must turn at right angles at each connection point. The lines may not touch each other except to where one ends and another starts. Illustrations 1 and 2 show networks that tin have been laid out correctly. Illustration 3 shows an incorrectly drawn network. (See images for the examples.<br/><br/>Play<br/>1.    One player spies by asking the opponent about the contents of a space in the opponent&rsquo;s field (such as<br/>1A, 2B and so on). If there is a line - or two connecting lines - in that space, the opponent announces: &lsquo;hot&rsquo;.<br/>If there is no line in that space, but it is adjacent to a space containing a line, the opponent announces: &lsquo;warm&rsquo;. Squares which touch diagonally are not considered adjacent for this purpose. In all other cases, the opponent announces&lsquo;cold&rsquo;. The opponent then asks about the contents of a space and the first player replies, thereby completing a round.<br/>2.    Each player uses the lower field on his game sheet for keeping track of information he obtains by spying.<br/>3.    In any round a player may, instead of spying on a single space, spy on from two to five connected spaces belonging to a single horizontal or vertical row. Whenever a player makes use of multiple spying, he must cross out below his upper field a square containing a number equal to the number of squares spied upon that turn. A player whose six numbered squares have all been crossed out may no longer use multiple spying, and the<br/>opponent should keep track of this by using the squares under his own lower field.<br/><br/>At the end of any round either or both players may try to reconstruct their opponent&rsquo;s network. A correct reconstruction counts as a single victory for the player. An incorrect reconstruction counts as a double victory for the opponent. (Thus it is possible for a tie to occur or for one player to win as much as a triple victory.) A player , who has made an incorrect secret construction or given the opponent incorrect information, automatically loses.<br/><br/>If the horizontal two-unit line in Illustration 1 were moved one grid unit to the right and connected with the four-unit line rather than the one-unit line, identical information would be obtained from spying. In such a case, either reconstruction would be considered correct.<br/><br/>Variation<br/>Advanced players may agree to use more lines.

The scavengers' only hope for a better life is to build great towering skyworks and gain the favor of the World Above, allowing them to outlast and outlive their rival scavenger gangs. In the Borderlands, survival is an exception.<br/><br/>Gearworld: The Borderlands is a game of conquest and survival in a post-apocalyptic world for 2-4 players who must gather resources and use them wisely. Players need those resources in order to strengthen their military might, to enhance their transport capabilities, and to reach the final goal of building the skyworks. Resources can be produced in areas with resource tokens, traded with other players, and taken by force. To build a development &ndash; e.g., weapons, transport vehicles or skyworks &ndash; all of the required resources have to be located in the same space on the map. This makes effective transport an important issue in the game. At the same time players must be strong enough to protect their resources from the other players while investing resources in their skyworks in order to win the game.<br/><br/>Seize territory, marshal resources and defend yourself from your rivals.

The game ends when there is no legal move left, the board fills up, or, more often, when both players agree to end it, at which time whoever controls the most territory wins.<br/><br/>As an additional game reusing the Go aesthetic, utilising the same general-purpose grid and colored stones, it is hoped this will join the variety of other abstract strategy games that can be played with a Go set, such as  Connect6, Go-Moku, Pente, and others.<br/><br/>"}, "137671": {"rpgitemversion": {"198514": "Paperback Version"}, "rpgseries": {"21528": "Space Hawks"}, "name": "Space Fortress", "rpgproducer": {"3": "(Uncredited)"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1556673.jpg", "usersrated": "0", "average": "0", "statistics": {}, "rpg": {"7240": "Choose Your Own Adventure"}, "poll": {}, "rpgcategory": {"2136": "Solitaire Adventure"}, "rpggenre": {"183": "Science Fiction"}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1556673_t.jpg", "description": "From the Back of the Book<br/><br/>When the Fiber People's gigantic Space Fortress is detected hurtling toward Earth, the Space Hawks are called into action.

Can I use it as a weapon? I challenge the fork! &lsquo;HO THERE, FORK!&rsquo; No answer? I attack the fork!&rdquo;<br/><br/>In your normal game the GM would be casting about for ways to rain anvils on the characters first, and potentially the players second. In Goblins!, that kind of thing is sort of par for the course. It gives you a chance to play around with these annoying jokes and random distractions in character. We think it&rsquo;s kind of fun.<br/><br/>If you&rsquo;re tired of saving the world from cosmic horrors, if you&rsquo;ve killed your 37th ancient dragon, if you&rsquo;re bored of playing an arch wizard from the dawn of time, kick your pointy shoes off and slum it with the grimy little beggars called Goblins!<br/><br/>A game for those whose idea of victory is keeping down dinner, whose concept of high adventure is testing out the Hag&rsquo;s new mushroom collection, whose ambitions range all the way to the dizzying heights of leading their own small army of cockroaches.

It was released by Sega in Japan in 1991 and North America in 1992. The animation was done by Kugatsuhime, a Japanese video game company. The gameplay of Crystal Warriors is similar to both the Shining Force and Fire Emblem series.<br/><br/>Game Play<br/><br/>The player forms a party of up to nine units to fight in each level. The player starts on one side of the map and an enemy force of up to nine units occupies a castle on the opposite side. The player must defeat the enemy force or move a unit on to the enemy castle entrance to complete each level. Each level has terrain features which form bottlenecks or change the speed of units. The player controls specialized units belonging to a particular elemental group and most of the strategy revolves around the element of a given unit and its correct usage. Each element is weak to one and strong versus another in a rock-paper-scissors system. Fire elemental units are strong against wind elemental units, while wind units are strong against water, and in turn water units are strong against fire. Earth-based units have no particular strengths or weaknesses.<br/><br/>Whenever a player unit attacks an enemy unit or vice versa, a battle occurs. A battle consists of two rounds where the units can fight with melee weapons, spells or monsters. The attacking unit strikes first in each round.<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;Crystal Warriors&quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "137738": {"poll": {}, "name": "Der Luftschutz", "playingtime": "35", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": {"2035": "Roll / Spin and Move"}, "yearpublished": "1936", "usersrated": "0", "maxplayers": "6", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1558829_t.png", "average": "0", "statistics": {}, "boardgamepublisher": {"24502": {"name": "Entseuma Verlag"}}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1558829.png", "boardgameversion": {"198660": "First edition"}, "maxplaytime": "35", "boardgamecategory": {"1041": {"name": "Children's Game"}}, "age": "6", "minplaytime": "35", "description": "'Luftschutz' means 'civil air defence'<br/>Objective: be the first reaching target space 100 - learn important facts to improve protection<br/> - moving by turns -<br/>simple 'Roll &amp; Move' game; ending on a marked (red) space follow instuctions printed lid inside; images on the board illustrate critical areas (education)<br/><br/>"}, "137739": {"statistics": {}, "name": "Super Amazing Wagon Adventure", "videogamemode": {"2149": "Single-Player"}, "videogameversion": {"198662": "Windows Downloadable edition"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2592943.jpg", "videogametheme": {"2509": "Comedy"}, "usersrated": "7", "average": "6.00714", "videogamegenre": {"2505": "Shoot 'em Up"}, "videogameplatform": {"4977": "Windows"}, "poll": {}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2592943_t.jpg", "description": "User Summary<br/><br/>First released as an Xbox Live Indie Games title, before being ported onto Windows, Super Amazing Wagon Adventure is a retro-flavoured parody of the Oregon Trail.<br/><br/>Just like in the Oregon Trail, the game depicts the journey to the West in the 19th century and its many hazards, including river crossings and diseases.

Although this game was made in Japan, the company has made it bi-lingual (although a few of the translations are a little strage).<br/><br/>Each player starts with a new talent card and 8 coins. The player uses coins to purchase (contract) &quot;talent&quot; and sends them to &quot;movies&quot; in order to earn more money and victory points.<br/><br/>Contents:<br/>4  - Newcomer Cards<br/>36 - Money Cards (9/6 coins, 12/3 coins, 15/1 coins)<br/>37 - Movie Cards (15/Talent cards, 11/QE Film cards, 11/CP Film cards)<br/>1  - The End Card<br/><br/>Each turn is conducted in 6 phases:<br/><br/>1 - Investment<br/>2 - Change<br/>3 - Contracting<br/>4 - Shooting<br/>5 - Profit<br/>6 - Replenishing<br/><br/>The instructions provided are a little confusing at first, but I'll do my best to try and summarize them.<br/><br/>The movie cards (talent and film cards) are shuffled, the END card is placed two from the bottom, and 5 cards are dealt into the play area.<br/><br/>1 - In the investment phase non-acting players can invest money in what they think the acting player will do. Money cards each have one of three logos on them: Yukidama Agency Corp. (for all talent cards [YA]), Qvinta Essentia Entertainment Inc. [QP] and Cosaic Pictures Inc. [CP] (the two movie companies). The invested money is placed face down and players wait until phase 5 (where they see if the acting player has played any of the companies non-acting players have invested in.<br/><br/>2 - In the change phase the acting player can choose to pay one coin to switch out one movie card with a new one. They can do this as many times as they'd like as long as they have the money to do so. They do not receive change from this transaction.<br/><br/>3 - In the contracting phase the acting player can purchase &quot;talent&quot; which will be placed face up infront of them. Talent often have various abilities that will affect play. In this phase, players can receive change from this transaction.<br/><br/>4 - In the shooting phase the acting player sends talent (this includes their &quot;new talent&quot; card) to film cards (if any in the play area). They can send multiple talent to work on different films as long as those films are being produced by the same company (you can't send one talent to CP and one to QE in the same turn. Either one or the other). You can also send multiple talent to the same film (as co-stars). The acting player will collect money and the film card (film cards go into the victory point pile). If the sent talent card has a star mark on it, it is discarded.<br/><br/>5 - In the profit phase the other players will collect their reward if they properly invested their money (for example: If player B decides to invest a &quot;one coin&quot; card with the CP logo on it and the acting player (player A) sends tallent to a CP film, then player B will be rewarded [they can either put the invested money into their VP pile or upgrade it to the next higher value coin card]). If the non-acting player invested in the wrong company, that invested money is discarded.<br/><br/>6 - In the replenish phase new movie cards are dealt into the play area until there are 5 cards again. It is now the next player's turn and it becomes the investment phase again.<br/><br/>Once the END card is dealt, the game will finish after the &quot;next&quot; player's turn. Once finished, each player counts their Victory Points. Player with the most VP is the winner (if tie, the player who made the most movies wins).<br/><br/>"}, "137747": {"average": "3", "poll": {}, "name": "Moony's Seaside Game", "playingtime": "0", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": {"2035": "Roll / Spin and Move"}, "yearpublished": "1976", "usersrated": "1", "boardgamefamily": {"8346": "Game of Goose"}, "maxplayers": "0", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1559138_t.jpg", "boardgameartist": {"28523": "Antonio Lupatelli"}, "statistics": {}, "boardgamepublisher": {"24518": {"name": "Fleetway Publications"}}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1559138.jpg", "boardgameversion": {"198689": "Fleetway Publications Playhour Edition"}, "maxplaytime": "0", "boardgamecategory": {"1041": {"name": "Children's Game"}}, "age": "4", "minplaytime": "0", "description": "Moony decided to go to the seaside for the day.

Recreating four battles of the British Guards Armour Division in 1944 and 1945, this game includes four battles: Operation Goodwood, Operation Veritable, Bonninghardt Ridge, and Joe&rsquo;s Bridge. It was designed by John Schettler and developed by Eric Harvey and Ty Bomba.<br/><br/>The Famous Divisions Series offers a new concept: game play is governed by the drawing of &quot;Event Chits&quot; during combat. Combat is not simply resolved by comparing the attack strengths and defense strengths of units, but is modified by a random chit-draw of over 140 possible &quot;events&quot; that introduce the elements of chaos and unpredictability to combat resolution. Event Chits can be nullified by other Event Chits; so players never know how an attack may be resolved based solely on odds ratios.<br/><br/>Each hex represents approximately 500 meters from side to opposite side. Each game turn represents approximately six hours; however, the game turns aren't divided into separate friendly and enemy turns. Rather, each is comprised of numerous individual HQ activations. All of the HQ activation chits are placed into a cup, and each is drawn one at a time to initiate the activation (movement and combat) of a particular headquarters and its associated companies. When that HQ&rsquo;s activation is finished, a new HQ is drawn from the cup, and then its activation begins.<br/><br/>Famous Divisions: Guards Armour is a special edition game that includes two counter sheets (560 counters) and four maps (on two 22 x 34 inch sheets) of the various battlefields where the division fought. Combat units are individual companies featuring distinct vehicles and weapons, shown as icons along with the unique capabilities of the vehicle or weapon portrayed. At company level the game play is tactical in many respects: units have individual range values, different movement capabilities depending on type (wheeled, tracked and leg), and the rules cover such things as demolishing bridges, pontoon bridges, weather, overrun, supply, infantry riding tanks, direct ranged fire, artillery barrages, opportunity fire, night, fortifications (bunkers, trenches, mines, dragon&rsquo;s teeth), engineers, armor recovery vehicles, airpower and anti-aircraft.<br/><br/>While not a purpose-designed solitaire system, the Event Chit mechanism makes the series easily adapted to such play, since the player won't know what chits may be drawn that could alter combat, or what order the HQ activations will take place. Some examples of the 140 Event Chits are: Sniper, Good Commander, Ambush, Experienced NCO, Caught in Crossfire, Fanatic, Radio Out, Critical Hit, Frontal Assault, Elite Troops, Outflanked, Hand-to-Hand Combat, and Friendly Fire.<br/><br/>The game includes two maps (22x34&rdquo;) and two counter sheets containing 560 counters.<br/><br/>Game Scale:<br/>Game Turn: 6 hours<br/>Hex: 601 yards / 550 meters<br/>Units: Company<br/><br/>Game Inventory:<br/>Two 22 x 34&quot; full color mapsheets<br/>Two dual-side printed countersheets (560 1/2&quot; counters)<br/>One 32-page rulebook<br/><br/>Solitaire Playability: Medium<br/>Complexity Level: Medium<br/>Players: 2 or more<br/>Playing Time: 4-15<br/><br/>"}, "137801": {"statistics": {}, "name": "Legends of Dawn", "videogamemode": {"2149": "Single-Player"}, "videogameversion": {"198804": "English/European Windows edition"}, "average": "1", "videogametheme": {"2148": "Fantasy"}, "usersrated": "1", "videogamegenre": {"2339": "Action RPG"}, "videogameplatform": {"4977": "Windows"}, "poll": {}, "description": "Once a lively and wealthy village teeming with people in search of precious metals and gemstones that abound its surroundings, Korden's Fall is now a derelict shadow of itself. It sits on the edge of Ladeona Mountains, overlooking the great river Arno in the north of Narr. Helpless in the relentless grip of an invisible force, a mysterious darkness that has spread from the ancient battlefield of Ashglades; warping and poisoning every creature in it's path, creating bloodthirsty monsters.<br/><br/>Trouble began when miners and traders began to disappear and rumours of massacres began to circulate. Mistrust and terror fanned conflicts among the people who live in fear of the elves from the nearby region. The managers of the mines, known as the North Trade Guild, appealed to the king, and the once powerful Kordelis family that govern the region, for help. The king sends a unit to uncover the mystery surrounding the icy peaks of the Northern Highlands, under the experienced leadership of Sir Herken Salavon, your foster father.<br/><br/>You are one of the soldiers in the unit and insufficiently trained. The situation required immediate action. Waiting for you to complete your training was not an option. Concerned for your safety, your foster father leaves you behind in Korden's fall and embarked on the quest with the rest of the men. He tells you as he always did, that people, not demons were behind the big evil.<br/><br/>Events take you from Korden's Fall, through old, abandoned forts, dungeons once inhabited by dwarves and ancient tombs. You go from  the elven city Recea, to the Great Northern Swamps, and the magical city of Sidis Tarea inhabited by the Danians, a mystical race. You reveal the ancient scripts that tell the legends of dwarves, exterminated in the centuries-old war with humans, and stumble unto the greatest of them all, the legend of Dawn. But most of its parts have been dismantled by great sages and hidden across the continent of Narr. The one who finds all the parts and reassemble them will restore its power, the only power that can dispel the dark forces over Ashglades. Returning Dawn to Ashglades will finally bring light to the endless darkness. <br/> Source: The Developer Website.<br/><br/>"}, "137802": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1842152.jpg", "poll": {}, "boardgamedesigner": {"9300": {"name": "Charles Diamond"}}, "statistics": {}, "yearpublished": "2013", "maxplayers": "2", "boardgameartist": {"20470": "Keith Rocco"}, "boardgamepublisher": {"102": {"name": "Decision Games (I)"}}, "maxplaytime": "0", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1842152_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "0", "boardgamecategory": {"1048": {"name": "American Civil War"}}, "description": "Jackson&rsquo;s Shenandoah Valley Campain' is loosely based upon the Twilight&rsquo;s Last Gleaming (2) rules system (S&amp;T issue #225), and simulates the movement of Gen. &ldquo;Stonewall&rdquo; Jackson&rsquo;s army into the Shenandoah Valley in 1862, raiding the Union forces and allowing Jackson to move out to reinforce Gen.

It is related to Alquerque and draughts as pieces leap over one another to capture. Felli's closest relatives are actually several thousand miles away in the form of Lau kata kati from India and the game called Butterfly (game) from Mozambique. One main difference is that the Felli board has only one horizontal line across its breadth as oppose to two found in the other two games.<br/><br/>There is another version, and perhaps even the correction version, where the pieces are promoted to &quot;Mullahs&quot; upon reaching the other player's first rank. The &quot;Mullahs&quot; are like the &quot;Kings&quot; in International Draughts, and they can move any number of unoccupied spaces. They can also leap over an enemy piece from any distance, and land any distance behind it.<br/>The game is also called Fich.<br/><br/>The goal of each player is to capture all the other player's pieces, or stalemate the other player by immobilizing its pieces.<br/><br/>The board is two triangles joined together at a common vertex. Each triangle has one horizontal line that dissects it across its breadth. A line also dissects both triangles across their lengths through the common vertex. There are a total of 13 intersection points of which the pieces are played upon.<br/>There are a total of 12 pieces of which 6 pieces are black and 6 pieces are white.<br/><br/>Gameplay and rules:<br/><br/><br/>     Players decide what colors to play, and who starts first.<br/><br/><br/><br/>     In the beginning, each player's 6 pieces are set up on their respective triangle. The only vacant point is the common vertex which is also the middle point of the board.<br/><br/><br/><br/>     A piece is moved one space (in any direction) per turn onto a vacant point following the pattern on the board.<br/><br/><br/><br/>     A piece captures an enemy piece by the short leap as in draughts. The player's piece must be adjacent to the enemy piece, leap over it, and land onto a vacant point on the other side. The leap must be in a straight line and follow the pattern on the board. Captured pieces are removed from the board.<br/><br/><br/><br/>     Only one piece may be used to move or capture per turn. Players alternate their turns throughout the game.<br/><br/><br/><br/>     Mullah Version: If playing the &quot;Mullah&quot; version, then pieces are promoted to Mullah upon reaching the other player's two corners on the first rank. The Mullahs may move any number of unoccupied spaces on the board, and capture an enemy piece from any distance and land any distance behind it provided no other pieces are in between. Multiple captures are allowed. If a non-Mullah piece captures enemy pieces in a sequence of multiple captures, and happens to land on the other player's first rank corners in the process, the player's piece does not become promoted to Mullah.

The card backs in both games say Storm Over Europe, and the two games can be combined to play out the whole of WW1 in Europe.<br/><br/>A few powerful German armies face a ponderous Russian juggernaut, while their Austro-Hungarian allies are threatened on all sides by Italians, Serbs, and Rumanians. The game is on the high strategic scale with corps and army units fighting a cross a map running from Frankfurt to Moscow, from Riga to the Dardanelles. Each turn is six months, with ten turns covering the entire war.<br/><br/>The game system is a distant derivation of the &quot;area-impulse&quot; mechanic created in Storm over Arnhem. Units are activated by group in a single area, and may generally move or attack but not both before becoming &quot;spent&quot;. Spent units are more vulnerable to attack. Storm Over Europe uses a card-driven system for activation, with each side getting varying amounts of cards each turn. The cards generally allow special moves or combinations that break the standard rules of the game, or provide events that shape the strategic outlook.<br/><br/>Players choose their hand each turn from a pool of sixteen Operations cards. Special Strategic cards are added to the pool once a turn from the third turn on; these bring new countries into the war, allow special tactics like poison gas, or provide game-turning events like the Russian Revolution.<br/><br/>The rules are only seven pages, and the game is simple and fast enough to play in a short evening.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": {"198874": "Game Journal Japanese edition"}, "maxplaytime": "240", "name": "Im Osten, voran!", "playingtime": "240", "boardgamemechanic": {"2046": "Area Movement"}, "average": "6.73333", "usersrated": "3", "boardgamefamily": {"21701": "\"Storm Over\" area impulse series"}}, "137835": {"boardgamedesigner": {"4043": {"name": "Yasushi Nakaguro"}}, "poll": {}, "name": "Crush at Nomonhan", "playingtime": "0", "minplayers": "1", "boardgamemechanic": {"2026": "Hex-and-Counter"}, "yearpublished": "2012", "usersrated": "2", "maxplayers": "2", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1561615_t.jpg", "average": "6.5", "statistics": {}, "boardgamepublisher": {"3133": {"name": "Kokusai-Tsushin Co., Ltd.

So do you.  Players in the game of Eons take on the roles of universal architects competing to shape the universe on a cosmic scale by gathering elemental building blocks to create stars, planets, and other cosmic phenomenon.  In a strategy game like no other, the architects engage the laws of the cosmos, using stars to forge more complex elements and form other heavenly bodies.<br/><br/>In EONS, players must spend their own essence to marshal these elements, carefully gauging their resources and the benefits received from their planets and stars, as they guide the formation of their cosmos eon after eon; working to achieve the most victory points through a variety of strategies and hidden agendas to achieve their version of the universe.  Because eventually, the universe will end, and only one player will be victorious...<br/><br/>Players build stars using elements commonly found in the universe, Hydrogen, Carbon, Oxygen and Iron.  Once they build stars, the stars perform fusion, and can produce resources for the player to use to build additional stars, planets or other cosmic events.  Each cosmic body the player builds is worth Essence, representing the power and influence the Architect has in the universe, and that Essence can be used to purchase more elements from the elemental stockpile to build more items.  Players can also destroy stars and collect resources from the dead stars, and this is where the game turns to strategy and planning.  Every cosmic body that is destroyed will decrease the entropy countdown, and when it reaches 0, the game is over.<br/><br/>Remaining cosmic bodies that grant victory points are totaled, and the player with the most victory points, wins!  Although the goal is to have the most victory points at the end of the game, you will find that the game is also a resource management game, as if you deny resources that stars need to undergo fusion, they will die and accelerate endgame.

Anything you can imagine, you may create; the Challenge will support their method of battle with a single system of resolution.<br/><br/>The Challenge is between two Creators, each with uniform tools at their disposal. Play is divided into two Phases: In Phase I, Creators alternate playing Tiled Cards to create a map, and use octagonal Origin Points to set where their Creations spawn from. In Phase II, Body &amp; Soul Cards are paired together to make 3 Creations per team. After their Creator describes them, pawns are placed on the map to represent them. As pawns are moved around the map, they will come into conflict with Rival Creations. Conflict is resolved by rolling 1 to 3 six-sided dice. A continually exchanged Event Card assigned to each Creation provides aid or presents challenges as the game unfolds, typically by modifying the number of dice rolled.<br/><br/>By rolling successfully, Creations will lose Heart. When Heart is reduced to zero, the Creations is removed from the map. Origin Points have no Heart and are removed from the map when rolled against successfully, but are much harder to succeed against. The game is over when one side has lost both Origin Points or all 3 Creations.

After years of rumors, it is time to discover the secrets of this vast mountain fortress for yourself...<br/><br/>Dwimmermount is a classic megadungeon and old-school campaign setting presented for use with Labyrinth Lord and other d20-based fantasy role-playing games.<br/><br/>The 400-page Dwimmermount hardcover includes:<br/><br/>     13 mapped, keyed, and stocked dungeon levels containing a total of 715 fully-described and detailed encounter areas for players and their characters to discover - with random tables to generate even more!<br/>     86 monsters and 70 magic items to confound, challenge, and reward your players.<br/>     6 pre-generated adventuring parties to serve as rivals for your player characters.<br/>     A gazetteer of the lands surrounding Dwimmermount, both civilized and wilderness, in order to support sandbox play outside of the megadungeon.<br/>     An overview of Muntburg, a fortified town nestled in the shadows of Dwimmermount, intended to serve as a &quot;home base&quot; for the player characters between expeditions into the dungeon's depths.<br/>     A history of the dungeon from its earliest days to the present, with innovative mechanics that reward the characters for learning the secrets of the past.<br/>     Descriptions of numerous factions operating within and without the dungeon, whose activities add a further layer of complexity to Dwimmermount.<br/>     Discussions of ways to approach Dwimmermount, both as a player and as a referee, including insight into the dungeon's origins and design.<br/>     Over 40 different works by top artists including Jeff Dee, Mark Allen, Eric Quigely, Conor Nolan, John Larrey, Steve Zieser, Russ Nicholson, Kelvin Green, and the grand master of old-school fantasy, Erol Otus.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>In the Golden Age of fantasy roleplaying, the dungeon was the linchpin of adventure design and the sandbox was the assumed role of a campaign setting. With Dwimmermount, the Golden Age has returned.<br/><br/><br/>From the introduction (p. 13):<br/><br/>This book includes the following:<br/><br/>     All 13 levels of the Dwimmermount megadungeon, each consisting of many keyed locations stocked with monsters and treasure.<br/>     An overview of the lands surrounding Dwimmermount, both civilized and wilderness, in order to support play outside of the megadungeon.<br/>     The fortified town of Muntburg, located only a few miles from Dwimmermount. This is intended to serve as a &quot;home base&quot; for the player characters between expeditions into the dungeon's depths.<br/>     Descriptions of numerous factions operating within and without the dungeon, whose activities add a further layer of complexity to Dwimmermount.<br/>     A history of the dungeon from its earliest days to the present, so as to provide greater context for what goes on within its shadowy halls.<br/>     Dozens of new monsters and magic items for players and their characters to discover.<br/>     Discussions of ways to approach Dwimmermount, both as a player and as a referee, including insight into the dungeon's origins and design.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>This book provides the referee with everything that he needs to begin a new campaign. Because of its size and complexity, Dwimmermount should provide enough material to keep players busy for many months, if not longer, as their characters grow in power sufficient to take on the most difficult challenges that lie in the deepest levels of the dungeon. Furthermore, the connections between Dwimmermount and the wider world, should the referee and players wish it, can expand their adventures to include everything from taming the wilderness and seeking magical secrets to playing politics&mdash;and even to the exploration of other worlds!<br/><br/>"}, "137906": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1656546.jpg", "poll": {}, "boardgamedesigner": {"6422": {"name": "Morgan Dontanville"}}, "statistics": {}, "yearpublished": "2013", "maxplayers": "6", "boardgameartist": {"17055": "John Austin"}, "boardgamepublisher": {"10": {"name": "Mayfair Games"}}, "maxplaytime": "60", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1656546_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "60", "boardgamecategory": {"1042": {"name": "Expansion for Base-game"}}, "description": "Steam: Map Expansion #3 covers a lot of ground on the included double-sided game board.

These issues are: &ldquo;school&rdquo;, &ldquo;leisure&rdquo;, &ldquo;local transports&rdquo;, &ldquo;culture&rdquo;, &ldquo;business&rdquo;, &ldquo;social services&rdquo;, &ldquo;elderly care&rdquo;, &ldquo;waste management&rdquo;, &ldquo;welfare&rdquo;, &ldquo;housing&rdquo;, &ldquo;water &amp; sewer&rdquo;, &ldquo;fire &amp; rescue&rdquo;.<br/><br/>As elected you spend resources (chits) on one or more of these areas that you are assigned. But look out! The next player has another set of issues that they must fight for &ndash; and they will grab every opportunity to take resources from your areas and put on their own.<br/><br/>The best way to try to win is to get the other players on your side, to contest and argue. There is no successful &ldquo;sneak under the radar&rdquo;-strategy in this game. Loud and vocal and on the attack but smart, is a winning strategy. But that is not enough; sooner or later you (your issues) will be stripped of resources &ndash; and you must be smart when trying to get them back to your most important issues.<br/><br/>During the course of the game you will start one turn, the next player starts the next turn et cetera (that means if you are more than four players, one or more will not get to start a turn). Each player gets the same amount of new resources, but not the same opportunity to shift resources from issue to issue, that is decided by the dice.<br/><br/>There is another random factor in the game, a deck of event cards that is used once at the end of each turn.<br/><br/>The ultimate goal of the game is to win the &ldquo;opinion poll&rdquo; at the end of the last turn, year four (one election cycle in Sweden). The opinion poll is won by the player that has collected most resources; double points for each resource on one&rsquo;s issues at heart and one point on the other issues that you fight for!<br/><br/>There are also rules for winning the overall game &ndash; not only do you compete against the other players, you all must successfully meet the public opinion and you all must collectively have enough points to pass the game. So it is not all about competition, you must also collaborate with your opponents from time to time.

The opponent's piece is removed from the board immediately. If the same player's checker can continue capturing by jumping another opponent's piece then it must do so.

By making a detailed plan, and executing each seperate task successfully, players earn bonus dice for the killing shot.<br/>     Faith and Prayer: Players grow in their faith, and through that faith can call on aid from the Supreme Director in the form of Prayers, small miracles designed to help them in the task of the Watch.<br/>     The Paths of Sin: Each Nephilim foe focuses on a specific sin, and earns dangerous powers from each, providing a deadly and infernal threat<br/>     Special Training: Characters earn additional points in character creation for providing backstory for their skill choices.  <br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>"}, "137948": {"statistics": {}, "name": "Amino Acids", "videogamemode": {"2149": "Single-Player"}, "videogameversion": {"199071": "Web Browser edition"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1563745.jpg", "videogametheme": {"2601": "Science / Technology"}, "usersrated": "1", "average": "5", "videogamegenre": {"2153": "Educational"}, "videogameplatform": {"5084": "Web Browser"}, "poll": {}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1563745_t.jpg", "description": "User Summary<br/><br/>Test your knowledge of the 20 major amino acids.

To power up the Robopon, the player could add software and parts to them. Parts had varying amounts of space to store software and determined what sort of attacks the Robopon could use. For example, a Robopon could have an &quot;Armgun&quot; or a &quot;Punch&quot; part, and this software adds certain elements to the attacks. Furthermore, software could be added onto other parts, creating more powerful additions. For example, by equipping a &quot;Thunder&quot; software to a &quot;Punch&quot; part, the Robopon would be able to use &quot;Thunderpunch&quot;. Software could also be mixed together to create special attacks - by mixing &quot;Fire&quot; and &quot;Thunder&quot; software, the Robopon would have the special move &quot;Zapp!!&quot;. This software could also be removed. If you did so, the attack abilities it gave the Robopon would be removed as well. Because only Sun was released in the USA, not all of the original 153 Robopon were available because the others were located on the Star Version that was never produced in the US.<br/><br/>Robopon cartridges have an Infrared panel on their top edge that allows them to trade information using waves much like a TV or VCR remote, allowing the cartridge to react to different objects. For example, pointing a remote control at the cartridges and pressing a button might boost the Robopon's stats, or open a chest within the games. This feature was called the &quot;GB Kiss&quot;. The game included over 150 different Robopon to use, with the first 2 releases and then over 168, with the release of Moon version, though some had to be upgraded, similar to Pok&eacute;mon's evolution stages. The Robopon were classified as either Arm, Move, or Boot. Arm tended to have high offense, Move were fast, and Boot had the highest stats overall.

In fact, Prison Outbreak holds even more material than the core game published in 2012 (now nicknamed Season 1)!<br/><br/>The Prison Outbreak will feature berserker zombies. They&rsquo;re really tied to each other. Prison tiles display tortuous alleys, small rooms and doors everywhere, filled with berserker zombies immune to ranged weapons.

These survivors are really designed to act as a team, as their skills really complement each other. They&rsquo;re precious assets to any Zombicide team.<br/><br/>Missions featured in the rulebook form a campaign on their own, as survivors battle to turn a zombie-filled prison into a reliable shelter.

The person who rolls highest goes first, followed by the person to their left and so on and so forth. Should two or more people roll the highest number than they must roll off until someone has rolled higher.<br/><br/>When it is your turn you must do the following.<br/>1.    Draw a card from the draw pile.<br/>2.    Use a power card, place a character card in play, or use a character card power.<br/>3.    Discard cards from your hand until you have only five left.<br/><br/>Power Cards<br/>Most power cards may only be used on your turn. When you play a power card you immediately do whatever it says, then discard it. Well&hellip; not immediately, but before you do anything else game related. So you could eat a sandwich or something.<br/><br/>Some power cards may be used at other times, which is indicated on the card itself. When in doubt, the card is right.<br/><br/>Character Cards<br/>Character cards may be placed in front of you during your turn instead of using a power card or a character power. Place the character card in front of you and leave it there until something tells you to place it someplace else. This is now considered to be an &ldquo;in play&rdquo; character card. You may not use the Character Card Power the turn you place a character card in play. You may only have three character cards in play at a time. If you place a fourth you must discard one.<br/><br/>Character Card Powers<br/>Instead of placing a character card or using a power card you may use the power on one of your &ldquo;in play&rdquo; character cards. This power works just like a power card, except you do not need to discard the character card to use it.<br/><br/>Note, some character cards have passive effects that do not require you to use them on your turn. These abilities are always in effect and should be easy to determine. If an argument does ensue the following characters have &ldquo;passive&rdquo; abilities.<br/><br/>Khan-El, Biel-Tel, Beorn, Penelope, Neil and Harris.<br/><br/>How to Win<br/>This is the part you have all been waiting for isn&rsquo;t it? To win the game all you have to do is have all of your in play character cards be the same characters as on your Dream Team card.
