Ratchet is given a &quot;DeadLock&quot; collar, which will explode if he becomes uncooperative. Ratchet defeats Dreadzone's most successful gladiators, the Exterminators, and becomes one of Dreadzone's most popular contestants. The three must find a way to deactivate the collars, and free the other heroes being held prisoner.<br/><br/>The gameplay is similar to other games in the series, but focuses more on shooter aspects rather than platforming. The player, as Ratchet, fights in Dreadzone tournaments across the &quot;Shadow Sector&quot; in the &quot;Solana&quot; Galaxy, with a large variety of weapons. This game was the first in the series to feature cooperative gameplay in a story mode, and also includes an online multiplayer mode.

In order to unlock every one of the cars, the player must race with every racing team and every manufacturer, in every qualifying position possible, hence enhancing the longevity of the game.<br/>  R4 featured two models of handling; drift handling was the classic Ridge Racer handling where the player oversteers into the turn to slide the car around the corner, whereas grip handling is more realistic, employing the brake more and not utilising powerslides at all.&quot;<br/><br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, R4: Ridge Racer Type 4 , available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "77844": {"statistics": {}, "name": "Mutant League Hockey", "videogamemode": {"2422": "Local Multiplayer"}, "videogameversion": {"54523": "US Genesis"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic814060.jpg", "videogametheme": {"2265": "Horror"}, "videogamegenre": {"2157": "Sports"}, "average": "7.22222", "videogamefranchise": {"14621": "Mutant League"}, "videogameplatform": {"4426": "SEGA Genesis"}, "usersrated": "9", "poll": {}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic814060_t.jpg", "description": "  Mutant League Hockey is a hockey game that was released in 1994 for the Sega Genesis.

It featured many of the same teams and players but new ones as well.<br/>  Unlike Mutant League Football which featured five species of mutant, Mutant League Hockey narrows it down to three: robots, skeletons and trolls. The game is identical in tone to its predecessor, with special plays that can cause things to happen like making the puck explode when it is picked up by an opposing player, bribing the referee to call fake penalties against the other team, and land mines and holes on the ice.<br/>  As with Mutant League Football, hazards litter the ice and death is commonplace. Players may substitute their goalie for a demon  goalie, a gigantic demon head that takes the place of the net; scoring on a demon goal causes it to explode. In addition, the crowd is prone to throwing weapons or other powerups onto the ice; they may be picked up and used freely. When a player dies, their corpse remains on the ice and may be tripped on; between periods, a giant slug acting as an ice resurfacer eats the debris littering the ice. As in real hockey, fights may break out. Fights in Mutant League Hockey are done as a minigame, where the objective is to knockout the opponent. Both players are still sent to the penalty box, but the player who got knocked out also takes an additional penalty for losing.<br/> Source: Wikipedia, Mutant League Hockey , available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "77845": {"statistics": {}, "name": "Kennedy Approach", "videogamemode": {"2149": "Single-Player"}, "videogameversion": {"54525": "Atari Release"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2942837.jpg", "videogametheme": {"2473": "Commercial / Public Transport"}, "usersrated": "4", "average": "7.75", "videogamegenre": {"2158": "Strategy"}, "videogameplatform": {"4940": "Atari 8-bit family"}, "poll": {}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2942837_t.jpg", "description": "User Summary<br/><br/>Air Traffic Control simulator with wide degree of difficulty levels--from Atlanta on the graveyard shift to JFK/La Guardia at prime time.

It was published by Enix and developed by Quintet and Ancient for the SNES video game console.<br/><br/>As its Japanese name implies, Robotrek was intended as a humorous game. Designed to appeal to a younger audience, Robotrek's main focus is on allowing the player to raise up to three robots which are built from spare parts that may be found, gained through battles, or generated by the player by means of the game's item combination system. Next Generation describes it as a predecessor to the core idea of Pok&eacute;mon in the sense that the protagonist does not himself fight, but sends out his robots to do so.<br/><br/>Robotrek has similar gameplay to that of most RPG video games, with the notable exception that the main character is not the combatant, but rather, the robots he invents are. The robots are highly customizable, in aspects such as equipment, special attacks, body color and name. The player is allowed to build a maximum of three robots. Unlike many RPGs, the player must invent or create the robots equipment, use &quot;Program Points&quot; to set the robot's attributes (as opposed to these attributes being set by the game), and program special attacks in a macro-like fashion, although certain commands do special effects instead.<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, Robotrek , available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "77847": {"statistics": {}, "name": "Super Bomberman 2", "videogamemode": {"2422": "Local Multiplayer"}, "videogameversion": {"54527": "US SNES"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1247978.jpg", "videogameseries": {"4932": "Bomberman"}, "videogametheme": {"2466": "Other"}, "usersrated": "19", "average": "7.28947", "videogamegenre": {"2147": "Action"}, "videogameplatform": {"4440": "SNES"}, "poll": {}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1247978_t.jpg", "description": "&quot;Super Bomberman 2 is the second of five video games in the Bomberman series developed by Hudson Soft to be released for the Super Nintendo.

The title and the basic theme seem to be heavily inspired by the 1978 film The Driver by director Walter Hill. Most notably, the Training level at the beginning of the game is a copy of a scene in the movie in which the Driver proves his skills to some gangsters in a parking garage. The music, overall character design in the cut scenes, and the cars themselves (complete with flying hubcaps), are inspired from movies such as Bullitt and even TV shows such as Starsky and Hutch. The game also features a Director's Mode, where the run could be replayed with cameras chosen by the player, and a Quick Replay, where the cameras were automatically selected.<br/><br/>In addition to the Undercover mode, the player also had an option to drive around in the cities (once they were unlocked) and dirt tracks.

Joseph Griffin of the United States Marine Corps.<br/><br/>A sequel was originally planned in order to see the return of the Griffin brothers. However, this was canceled after Rising Sun received mixed reviews.<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, <a target='_blank' href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medal_of_Honor' rel='nofollow'>http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medal_of_Honor</a>:_Rising_Sun,&quot; available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "77881": {"statistics": {}, "name": "Bad Day on the Midway", "videogamemode": {"2149": "Single-Player"}, "videogameversion": {"54627": "European CD-Rom edition"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic902302.jpg", "videogametheme": {"2509": "Comedy"}, "usersrated": "1", "average": "9", "videogamegenre": {"2152": "Adventure"}, "videogameplatform": {"4729": "Macintosh"}, "poll": {}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic902302_t.jpg", "description": "From the back of the game:<br/>Dodge death and taxes while solving a mystery of murder and intrigue in a world populated by a cast of ten unforgettable characters.

It is developed by 2K Czech, previously known as Illusion Softworks, and is published by 2K Games.  Originally announced in August 2008 at the Leipzig Games Convention, it was released on PlayStation 3, Xbox 360 and Microsoft Windows in August 2010.<br/><br/>The game is set from 1943 to 1951 in Empire Bay (the name is a reference to New York's state nickname &quot;The Empire State&quot;),  a fictional city based on San Francisco and New York City, with influences from Chicago and Detroit. The game will feature a completely open-ended game map of 10 square miles. No restrictions are included from the start of the game.  There will also be around 50 vehicles in the game, as well as licensed music from the era.<br/><br/>Many firearms from the previous game will make a return. For example the Thompson submachine gun, the Colt 1911 and a pump-action shotgun. As seen in screenshots, new WWII-era weapons like the MP 40, the M3 submachine gun, and the Beretta Model 38 will make an appearance in the game as well as the MG 42.<br/><br/>Interacting with objects in the environment involves two action buttons- a standard action and a &quot;violent&quot; action (for example, when stealing a car, the player may choose to either pick its lock or break the window glass), used in context-sensitive situations. A map will be included as in the original Mafia game. The checkpoint system has been completely overhauled. New controls include a cover system that allows the player to hide behind objects (such as generators, walls and large crates) to shoot enemies, rather than just using a crouch while behind an object. Flanking may be a large part of the combat.<br/><br/>It has been stated by 2K Czech that the game's cutscenes are created by the game engine, in real-time, rather than pre-rendered cutscenes.<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;<a target='_blank' href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mafia_II,&quot' rel='nofollow'>http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mafia_II,&quot</a>; available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "77887": {"statistics": {}, "name": "R:Racing Evolution", "videogamemode": {"2422": "Local Multiplayer"}, "videogameversion": {"54641": "English/European GameCube edition"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1031541.jpg", "videogametheme": {"2456": "Driving"}, "usersrated": "1", "average": "8", "videogamegenre": {"2154": "Racing"}, "videogameplatform": {"4425": "GameCube"}, "poll": {}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1031541_t.jpg", "description": "From the back of the box:<br/><br/>R: Racing Evolution is an extraordinary action-racing experience featuring authentic licensed cars and daring, real-world tracks.

Director Uwe Boll has bought the movie rights for the series, and has produced a film of the same name.<br/><br/>Postal is a 3D shooter with mainly isometric, but also some top-down levels featuring hand-painted backgrounds. Gameplay and interface are similar to first-person shooters of the time in most, but not on all counts:<br/><br/>Movement is always relative to the orientation of the player character (&quot;Postal Dude&quot;). The player therefore must always be aware of the direction the character is facing, which can be difficult on the isometric maps. There are eight weapon slots, each with a fixed amount of maximum ammo. The default weapon is a weak machine gun with unlimited ammo.<br/><br/>Contrary to first-person shooters, however, the goal is not just to stay alive and reach the next level, but to kill a given percentage of the armed NPCs on the map. Only then the exit to the next level is activated.<br/><br/>There is no plot as such. The presence of a moving van on the first level suggests that the Postal Dude has been evicted from his home and is therefore &quot;going postal&quot;, but no background story evolves during the game.<br/><br/>An add-on to the game called Special Delivery was made in 1998 which featured four new levels (department store, shanty town, earthquake zone and vacation resort), new characters, new sounds, new modes of play (co-op and a refined deathmatch).

In the game, Mickey Mouse and Donald Duck are sucked into a magical world, while preparing for a magic act. Now they must survive over a dozen different side-scrolling levels, in order to return home.<br/><br/>The game's music, artwork and animation shows influences from classic Disney animated films, including; Aladdin, The Little Mermaid, The Sword in the Stone, Alice in Wonderland and Pinocchio. The game included many features that broke the standard platforming mold. It also seems to have an inspirational effect on Kingdom Hearts as many of the worlds are visited again.<br/><br/>Mickey and Donald can run, jump, or attack by flourishing their capes. Enemies defeated in this way turn into doves, cards, or other harmless objects depending on the enemy. After defeating the boss of each level, a new magic spell is learned, allowing the pair to traverse the next level; i.e. flying on a magic carpet or going underwater in an air bubble. This was one of the few Genesis games to feature voice samples.<br/><br/>The gameplay changes depending on if the player selects Mickey or Donald, in a one player mode, or if two people want to control both characters at once. For instance, Mickey can squeeze through certain gaps, while Donald must find a different route; if both are playing, Mickey can pull Donald through the gap. Either can stand on the others' shoulders to ascend higher, and lower a rope to pull the other up.<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;World_of_Illusion,&quot; available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "77914": {"videogame": {"81344": "Postal Fudge Pack"}, "statistics": {}, "name": "Postal\u00b2", "videogamemode": {"2310": "Network Multiplayer"}, "videogameversion": {"54703": "English/European Windows edition"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic829872.jpg", "videogameseries": {"5585": "Postal"}, "videogametheme": {"2277": "Adult / Mature"}, "usersrated": "21", "videogameexpansion": {"96759": "Postal 2: Apocalypse Weekend"}, "average": "5.59286", "videogamegenre": {"2505": "Shoot 'em Up"}, "videogameplatform": {"5248": "Linux"}, "poll": {}, "videogamecompilation": {"81344": "Postal Fudge Pack"}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic829872_t.jpg", "description": "Postal 2 is a first-person shooter video game by Running with Scissors, and it is the sequel to the 1997 game Postal. Both are intentionally highly controversial due to high levels of violence and stereotyping. Unlike its predecessor, Postal 2 is played completely in first-person based on the Unreal Graphics Engine. Due to its graphic nature the game has been banned in Australia and several other places.<br/><br/>The game levels are split into days of the week starting Monday and finishing Friday. At the beginning of each day, Dude is given several tasks to accomplish, such as 'Get milk', 'Confess sins', and other seemingly mundane tasks. The purpose of the game is to finish all of the tasks throughout the week, and the player can accomplish these tasks in any way he wishes, be it as civilly or as chaotically as possible (it is possible, if occasionally difficult, to complete most tasks without engaging in battle, or, at least, killing other people). The daily tasks can be accomplished in any order, and the game includes one task that is only activated on a certain day if Dude performs a certain action.<br/><br/>One of the major concepts of Postal 2 is that it is meant to be a &quot;living world&quot;, a simulation of a tongue-in-cheek off-kilter town. Game characters live out their lives completely separate from the actions of Dude; walking around town, buying and selling merchandise, and even engaging in random shootouts with each other and the police.<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;<a target='_blank' href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Postal%C2%B2,&quot' rel='nofollow'>http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Postal%C2%B2,&quot</a>; available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "77915": {"poll": {}, "name": "Rubicon: Republic in Crisis", "playingtime": "100", "minplayers": "3", "boardgamemechanic": {"2001": "Action Point Allowance System"}, "yearpublished": "2010", "usersrated": "2", "boardgamefamily": {"5606": "Ancient Rome"}, "maxplayers": "6", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic787768_t.jpg", "average": "5", "statistics": {}, "boardgamepublisher": {"2456": {"name": "The Game Crafter, LLC"}}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic787768.jpg", "boardgameversion": {"54704": "First Edition"}, "maxplaytime": "100", "boardgamecategory": {"1050": {"name": "Ancient"}}, "age": "14", "minplaytime": "100", "description": "Rubicon: Republic In Crisis is a fast-paced, historical strategy game based on the politics of the late Roman Republic.

Many critics likened the game to the Pok&eacute;mon series, but praised the game's unique qualities.[1] In Japan, the game inspired merchandise based on the Metal Walker robots.[2]<br/><br/>Metal Walker's battles are unique from other games in the genre due to their billiard-style nature. Players move their Metal Walkers across the battlefield by hitting them into items, walls, or enemy Metal Walkers.<br/><br/>Although Metal Walker is a console RPG, battles are fought in a pinball or billiards-like atmosphere in a top-down perspective arena.[3] As each turn of the battle starts, players decide which direction a Metal Walker will move and how hard they will move. Players are encouraged to form strategies that allow Metal Walkers to hit a single enemy, bounce off a wall, and then hit another enemy, all in a single turn.[1] On the battlefield, players can throw several different types of items onto the field. The items are used when a Metal Walker hits them. Capsules and healing items strengthen and heal Metal Walkers, whereas attack items, such as Napalm, are only useful when the enemy hits them. There also exist Analyzers, which provide the player with Scan Data for any Metal Walker that is bounced into them. Scrap metal won after the battle can then be used with the Scan Data to create new Metal Walkers or purchase items. When an enemy is destroyed, the player's Metal Walker will gain experience points and an item might be obtained. If the player's Metal Walker runs out of Hit points, the player will lose half of the carried scraps and have to start from the last save point.<br/><br/>Outside of battle, players explore a top-down overworld where they can explore various towns and dungeons. Most battles occur as random encounters. The overworld has several interactable elements, such as water, which the player needs a certain number of Cores to cross. The player can only carry one Metal Walker at a time and it will follow the main character on the overworld.[2] By defeating the game's bosses, players earn Core Units, which allow Metal Walkers to evolve into new, stronger forms.<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, Metal Walker , available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "77930": {"statistics": {}, "name": "BattleForge", "videogamemode": {"2313": "Cooperative"}, "videogameversion": {"54729": "PC DVD"}, "average": "5", "videogametheme": {"2148": "Fantasy"}, "usersrated": "1", "videogamegenre": {"2158": "Strategy"}, "videogameplatform": {"4977": "Windows"}, "poll": {}, "description": "From the Developer Website<br/><br/>BattleForge is a next-gen real time strategy game, in which you fight epic battles against evil along with your friends.

Gameplay is fairly standard for an RPG, with players alternating between visiting towns and exploring dangerous areas.  Combat uses an updated version of the series's real-time battle system.  The player controls one hero of his choice, and can switch on the fly, while the AI controls the other 2.  Each character can be customized with different attacks, and special moves can be chained together to produce combos.  Customization is also done through 'capacity cores', which give bonuses at each level increase when equipped, and 'AD skills', a large list of passive abilities that can be learned and set for use.<br/><br/>The story revolves around the protagonist, Luke fon Fabre, and Tear Grants, a reserved young woman with whom he is thrown into an adventure.  Luke is from a high-ranking noble family in the nation of Kimlasca, and is directly related to the king.  He was kidnapped 7 years before the story begins, and although he was rescued, the experience cost him all memories of his childhood.  Since then, Luke has been confined to his family's estate in the city, visited only by them, servants, his teacher Master Van, and his good friend Guy.  When he meets Tear, though, he is forced into the outside world and has to deal with a brewing war and a secretive religious organization bent on guiding the world down a preordained path.<br/><br/>Similar to past entries, the story is further developed by optional extra scenes or 'skits' where the characters converse with each other.

The gameplay is very similar to - if more advanced than - Skool Daze, even incorporating most of the same characters, gameplay elements and graphics.<br/><br/>The game is ranked 19th in the Your Sinclair official top 100 Spectrum games of all time.<br/><br/>The game differs from its predecessor by a growth of the play area (including a neighbouring girls' school) and a number of gameplay changes.<br/><br/>The girls' school incorporates its own new characters including undistinguished girls with hockey sticks, Hayley (girlfriend of the main character Eric) and Miss Take (the headmistress). Only at break time and lunch times are the girls allowed to mingle with the boys, in the central grassy playground, separated at other times by a high fence. The opening and closing of the fence is controlled by the school caretaker Albert, a new character to the game. It is also possible for Eric to sneak over the fence into the girls' school during lesson times, either using the bicycle (after completing the challenge of finding its lock's combination and then performing a tricky manoeuvre on it) or by watering the flower beside the fence and then jumping on it. When the girls and boys are allowed to mingle and when Eric gains access to the girls' school, he can kiss Hayley, who would then agree to do some of his lines for him.<br/><br/>Elements added in Back to Skool include stink bombs (used to trigger the opening of windows), water pistols, mice that can be released in the girls' school causing widespread panic, and sherry (which can be squirted into cups and used to &quot;intoxicate&quot; teachers by splashing it on them with correct timing).<br/><br/>It is possible to commit suicide by opening the top storey window and making Eric jump out. (Jumping out of a window is necessary to sneak into the girls' school, but only from the first floor - not the second.) When this happens, Eric would lie incapacitated on the ground outside the boys' school until Mr Wacker approaches and tells him &quot;Eric you are not a bird&quot;, and the game ends. This effectively replaced the mumps instant Game Over from Skool Daze.<br/><br/>There is a bug in the game that enables you to see what goes on in the girls' school without leaving the boys' school. To do this go as far left as possible in the Blue Room, then face right and press the key that would have Eric pick up a mouse or frog (C). The whole screen will scroll if you press any button until it goes all the way to the girls' school. Once the scrolling is complete Eric can move around as usual, unseen, and will NOT pick up any lines. You can, through trial and error, get to the girls' school upon which the game will go back to normal. This is best attempted at playtime, and really isn't that difficult to do provided you know your way around the boys' school.<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;Back to Skool,&quot; available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "77967": {"statistics": {}, "name": "Zelenhgorm: Episode I: Land of the Blue Moon", "videogamemode": {"2149": "Single-Player"}, "videogameversion": {"54789": "European (EN/ES/DE/SW) Windows edition"}, "average": "0", "videogametheme": {"2148": "Fantasy"}, "usersrated": "0", "videogamegenre": {"2152": "Adventure"}, "videogameplatform": {"4977": "Windows"}, "poll": {}, "description": "From the game box:<br/><br/>Zelenhgorm<br/><br/>In this first episode of the dazzling cinematic fantasy game, you will encounter the supersticious world of Zelenhgorm in the shape of Arrikk Vaheirr.

It was designed and programmed by Pete Cooke. It was groundbreaking at the time for its extensive use of 3D graphics, shadow effects and its large gameworld set on a small planet, Tau Ceti III, orbiting the titular star. The planet also has a realistic day and night cycle (much shorter than our own).<br/><br/>An enhanced version (known as Tau Ceti - The Special Edition) was released for the 128K Spectrum and Amstrad CPC in 1987 featuring extra graphics and a large amount of accessible library data about the gameworld and the game.<br/><br/>A sequel, Academy, was released in 1986.<br/><br/>The origins of Tau Ceti and its game engine came from Cooke attempting to work out how the spheres in the game Gyron, released by Firebird Software for the ZX Spectrum in 1985, had been created:<br/>&quot;...for a long while it had puzzled me how on earth they did the spheres. It obviously couldn't be a sprite because they didn't have enough memory to have that many sprites. I finally twigged that they must have used a table of line widths, and I thought about it a bit, then realised I could split it three quarters and a quarter, and then it would look like a shadow. I just went away and played with that for quite a long while and got it so that I had the sun in the sky and the shadow in the right place. And it sort of came from that, really.&quot;<br/>Having created the basics of a game engine, Cooke had to decide on a scenario for his new game:<br/>&quot;It was all made up as I went along. I know a bit about astronomy, so I looked around for a likely location - because the way the routine works meant it couldn't be in space; you couldn't have the sun above because the line-draw routine wouldn't work, it would have to be on the surface of a planet. And I thought 'Right, it can't be Earth because it looks a bit barren for Earth, it's got to be another planet.' So I looked round for nearby stars that might be inhabited and Tau Ceti had a nice-sounding name.&quot;<br/><br/>Cooke was also inspired when writing Tau Ceti by the works of the science-fiction writer Larry Niven and the space-simulator Elite.<br/><br/>Plot:<br/>Humanity has spread out and colonised nearby star systems but a plague in 2150 led to the colonies being abandoned and left to their automated robotic maintenance systems. While several of these colonies have been successfully re-inhabited, the colony on the planet Tau Ceti III (orbiting the star Tau Ceti) has been uncontactable since a meteor smashed into the planet. A mission sent to Tau Ceti III in 2164 landed on the planet but broadcast a mayday message followed by silence. Experts decided that the planet's robots were running amok as a result of the meteorite impact. The only chance, it was decided, of successfully stopping the defence systems without destroying the cities already there is to send a single pilot in an armoured Gal-Corp skimmer to the planet's surface with the task of shutting-down the central reactor in Tau Ceti III's capital, Centralis.<br/><br/>Gameplay:<br/>When it was released, Tau Ceti was an ambitious piece of software and its scale can still seem impressive. The planet Tau Ceti III consists of several cities which themselves consist of clusters of buildings with their defensive laser towers and patrolling robot Hunter ships. The player's skimmer can dock with some of these buildings and find parts needed to help shut-down the central reactor as well as refuel and find vital information. The cities themselves can be travelled to by means of a &quot;jump pad&quot; which makes the long trips between them much quicker.<br/><br/>Interestingly, if you did take the long trip between cities, a bug in the Amstrad CPC version meant you stayed in the same city when next using a jump pad. This can be used as an advantageous way of returning quickly to the center of the map, without traveling back through every city. This also allowed the player to jump to non-existent cities off the map[citation needed].<br/>The gameworld is displayed in a 3D view from the skimmer. As well as displaying these 3D graphics, Cooke's game engine renders them with simple shadows in order to simulate the day and night cycle of Tau Ceti III. These days are much shorter than Earth's consisting of one spin of the planet per hour with sixteen &quot;spins&quot; to a Centaurian day.<br/><br/>The cities of Tau Ceti III are an extremely hostile place as they are full of robot defences. These consist of laser towers, Fortresses (which are essentially better-armoured Towers), Hunter ships (of which there are three types: Mark I, Mark II and Mark III), and slowly-moving mines. To defend itself against these, the skimmer is armed with lasers, missiles, and AMMs (to destroy missiles fired by robot Hunters). The skimmer also has a shield although its power is limited and if the shield is badly depleted or exhausted, the skimmer will take damage and some of its systems will fail. They can be repaired at any supply centre.<br/><br/>Any static defences (e.g. buildings) which are destroyed are permanently destroyed. Any mobile defences (Hunters, droids, etc) are renewed when the player leaves a city; so cities are never fully cleared. Cities vary greatly in their defences; a few cities are almost undefended (just minefields), a few cities are very very intensely defended (e.g. Centralis, where the main reactor is).<br/><br/>The skimmer is also fitted with a scanner in order to detect buildings or Hunters not in its forward view or at a distance, and a compass to aid navigation. To cope with Tau Ceti III's frequent hours of darkness, the skimmer has an infra-red display mode and also carries a limited number of short-lived flares.<br/>Although Tau Ceti is primarily an action game, it has some text-input sections when the skimmer docks or lands on the planet's surface. When this happens, the player can communicate with the skimmer using simple commands such as &quot;HELP&quot;, &quot;STATUS&quot; or &quot;SCORE&quot; to get access to game information. If docked with a building, &quot;LOOK&quot; will display a picture of the inside of the building and &quot;EQUIP&quot; will allow access to anything useful in that building.<br/><br/>As with some other Cooke games, the game also has an inbuilt note-taking system (accessed via the command &quot;PAD&quot;) to take notes without using pen and paper.<br/><br/>In order to shut down the central reactor, the main objective of the game, the player must first locate the forty pieces of the reactor cooling rods and assemble them into twenty complete rods which can then be inserted into the reactor to shut it down. The assembly of the rods is achieved by using the command &quot;RODS&quot; which displays a screen showing found rod-pieces which can then be assembled in a manner similar to a simple jigsaw puzzle.<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;Tau Ceti (video game),&quot; available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "77974": {"statistics": {}, "name": "Dynasty Warriors", "videogamemode": {"2422": "Local Multiplayer"}, "videogameversion": {"63104": "Australian PlayStation edition"}, "average": "5.88889", "videogameseries": {"5514": "Dynasty Warriors"}, "videogametheme": {"2493": "Martial Arts"}, "videogamefranchise": {"12289": "Romance of the Three Kingdoms"}, "videogamegenre": {"2147": "Action"}, "videogameplatform": {"4433": "PlayStation"}, "usersrated": "9", "poll": {}, "description": "User Summary<br/><br/>Dynasty Warriors is a 3D fighting game published by Koei.

Volume production started in the spring of 1982, with machines being released on to the market in August at a price of US $595. Preceded by the Commodore VIC-20 and Commodore MAX Machine, the C64 features 64 kilobytes (65,536 bytes) of memory with sound and graphics performance that were superior to IBM-compatible computers of that time. It is commonly known as the C64 or C=64 (after the graphic logo on the case) and occasionally as the CBM 64 (for Commodore Business Machines), or VIC-64 It has also been affectionately nicknamed the &quot;breadbox&quot; and &quot;bullnose&quot; due to the shape and color of the first version of its casing.<br/><br/>During the C64's lifetime, sales totaled 30 million units, making it the best-selling single personal computer model of all time. For a substantial period of time (1983&ndash;1986), the C64 dominated the market with between 30% and 40% share and 2 million units sold per year, outselling the IBM PC clones, Apple Inc. computers, and Atari 8-bit family computers. Sam Tramiel, a former Atari president and the son of Commodore's founder, said in a 1989 interview &quot;When I was at Commodore we were building 400,000 C64s a month for a couple of years.&quot;<br/><br/>Part of its success was because it was sold in retail stores instead of electronics stores, and also because these machines can be directly plugged into an existing home television without any modifications. Commodore produced many of its parts in-house to control supplies and cost. It is sometimes compared to the Ford Model-T automobile for bringing a new technology to middle-class households via creative mass-production.<br/><br/>Approximately 10,000 commercial software titles were made for the Commodore 64 including development tools, office applications, and games. Various C64 emulators allow anyone with a modern computer, or a compatible game console, to run these programs today. The machine is also credited with popularizing the computer demo scene. The C64 is still used today by some computer hobbyists.<br/><br/>Since 28 March 2008, Commodore 64 games have been available to buy through Nintendo's Virtual Console service in Europe; the first games available were Uridium and International Karate. Later, on February 23, 2009, the Commodore 64 section was launched in North America with the first three titles, International Karate, The Last Ninja and Pitstop II. A C64 emulator application with classic games also appears on Apple Inc.'s App Store.<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, Commodore 64 , available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "77503": {"statistics": {}, "name": "L'oro dei Chibcha", "videogamemode": {"2149": "Single-Player"}, "videogameversion": {"53921": "Commodore 64 edition"}, "average": "0", "videogameseries": {"6799": "Terry Jones' Adventures"}, "videogametheme": {"2466": "Other"}, "usersrated": "0", "videogamegenre": {"2168": "Text Adventure"}, "videogameplatform": {"4420": "Commodore 64"}, "poll": {}, "description": "[User summary]<br/><br/>It's a textual adventure (some graphic embellish it, but is purely decorative and has no role in the game).<br/>You give commands usually composed by a verb plus a noun (e.g. &quot;go north&quot;, &quot;examine desk&quot;, &quot;drink potion&quot;) and are told what happens (&quot;you cannot go in that direction&quot;, &quot;there is a pen on the desk&quot;, &quot;you feel reinvigorated&quot;).

The game charts the protagonist Slater's attempts to discover the truth behind his sister's mysterious death while working for the titular G-Police. The game begins with the G-Police combating organised criminals before fighting the private armies of powerful corporations in an unfolding conspiracy-themed plot. The gameplay involves piloting VTOL aircraft resembling helicopters, engaging in combat with enemies and protecting allies.<br/><br/>The game made use of cutting edge technology such as force&ndash;feedback joysticks, 3D sound and Direct3D Hardware Acceleration and was largely well-received. Critics noted that the game's graphics were some of the most technically impressive of the time.

While the main focus of the game is in controlling tanks, artillery units provide long range fire while infantry units can be used to engage other infantry and garrison buildings for added defense. Damage is modeled on a health bar system, although vehicles have additional armor plating to weaken before taking damage. Players are also required to maintain their vehicles using ammo and repair trucks. In addition to regular units the player can control, the game provides players with indirect fire support.

The scale is 60 miles per hex and losses are individual vehicles, aircraft, guns and squads. Since half the planet Earth is covered by the titanic Pacific struggle, the game is massive in scope, covering thousands of ships tens of thousands of aircraft.<br/><br/>The War At Sea - Besides critical hit locations for all weapons platforms and any radar installations, individual armor locations and a wealth of performance and characteristics data, each ship&rsquo;s crew has an experience rating for day and night combat. Every ship from mighty carriers and battleships down to gun boats has a commander with his own strengths and weaknesses. The game includes thousands of ships chosen from over 300 ship classes.<br/><br/>The War in the Air - A wide variety of aircraft are included in the game, ranging from the awkward P-39 and the nimble Zero, to the heavy hitting B-29 and the extremely fast and powerful Corsair. Pilots and crews are tracked separately from aircraft and have individual skill and fatigue ratings. When pilots are in short supply, they can be placed into the pilot pool and reassigned to other groups<br/><br/>The War on the Ground - Troops are needed to maintain and garrison bases and to deprive the enemy of his bases. So, troops are handled with care. There are a goodly number of different types of land-based units. The unit counters are mostly on division and brigade level, but there are many independent regiments and battalions. These are all represented by different unit counters and have different capabilities and include engineers, combat squads, Marine squads, support squads, air support sections, Sherman tanks, Stuart tanks, motorized forces, a number of mortars and field artillery and many others. There are 15 campaigns included with the game, which can be played against the computer opponent, hot seat, by secure email. War in the Pacific now gives you the chance to fight the entire war your way on every level.<br/><br/>Political Points - Some troops are restricted in deployment. Australian troops must be release from home defense, for instance, before they can be shipped off to fight in New Guinea. And, Admirals can&rsquo;t be everywhere, at once. Each day, each player accumulates political points which can be used to reassign assets to the various headquarters or to change leaders.<br/><br/>Japanese Production - Groups cannot fly without planes, ships need to be built and tanks have to come from somewhere. The Japanese player will never have enough industry to build all he needs. He can choose to increase the size of factories or change what they are building at the cost of retooling. He can also speed up or retard the building of specific ships to the possible detriment of the shipbuilding schedule. He will need oil and resources to make industry run and will want to capture locations with such materials as quickly as possible. Much of this gathering can be automated, but the player will be able to fine tune the procedure or manually order the loading and destination of his ships.<br/><br/>"}, "77541": {"statistics": {}, "name": "Uncommon Valor", "videogamemode": {"2410": "Asynchronous Multiplayer"}, "videogameversion": {"53992": "US PC Windows CD-ROM edition"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic923899.jpg", "videogametheme": {"2345": "Historical"}, "usersrated": "8", "average": "7.875", "videogamegenre": {"2158": "Strategy"}, "videogameplatform": {"4977": "Windows"}, "poll": {}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic923899_t.jpg", "description": "From the Publisher / Developer Website<br/><br/>Matrix Games has joined forces with legendary game designer Gary Grigsby, Joel Billings and Keith Brors of 2by3Games to bring to you the ultimate operational campaign of the south pacific. Uncommon Valor is the first of a three game series. We are sure that Gary Grigsby fans will not be disappointed. You will find that you are not just playing a game but running a war! Uncommon Valor is a completely new operational game covering the campaigns for New Guinea, New Britain, New Ireland and the Solomon chain from May 1942 to the end of December 1943.The scale is 30 miles per hex and the attrition factor is individual vehicles, guns and squads.Phases are one day, composed of two 12-hour impulses.A turn is composed of 1 to 7 phases, at the player&rsquo;s discretion. He may also choose continuous play and may interrupt that by pressing a key.<br/><br/>Naval Detail Never Before Achieved <br/>Uncommon Valor has naval detail never before achieved in a game of this scale. Besides critical hit locations for all weapons platforms and any radar installations, individual armor locations and a wealth of performance and characteristics data, each ship&rsquo;s crew has an experience rating for day and night combat. Every ship from mighty carriers and battleships down to Japanese barges and American PT boats has a Captain, with his own strengths and weaknesses. The game includes hundreds of ships chosen from over 200 ship classes. These include fully functional seaplane tenders, gunboats, destroyers, mine layers and mine sweepers, light cruisers, heavy cruisers, capital ships, submarines, tankers, cargo ships, transports and many others. Ships take incidental damage from rough weather and mishap, as well as battle damage. Ships can also make repairs while under and there is an option for superior Allied damage control. All have proper steaming ranges, based on accurate fuel consumption ratings and fuel stowage capacities. Ships can be formed into task groups of up to 25 ships, although smaller ships and smaller task groups are harder to spot and easier to coordinate. Radar can be used increase the chances of surprise. Task groups can be given a variety of missions, including cargo, aircraft transport, surface action, bombardment, air combat, mine sweeping, mine laying, anti-submarine patrol and troop transport. Task groups can be given orders to return if attacked or to ignore attacks and continue on the mission, to stay on station or to return to base after mission completion. They can be given orders to go to a base or a location at sea or to follow a friendly fleet. Submarines may be orders on combat patrol or assigned special operations missions, including troop or supply transport and mine laying. A fleet commander is assigned to each fleet and may be exchanged for a different officer by the player,any time the fleet is docked. The choice of fleet commander can affect the fuel consumption rate, combat and non-combat capabilities of the fleet.<br/><br/>Air Power You Can Feel <br/>The game deals with aircraft in a similar fashion. A wide variety of aircraft are included in the game, ranging from the awkward P-39 and the nimble Zero, to the heavy hitting B-17E and the extremely fast and powerful Corsair. Pilots and crews are tracked separately from aircraft and have individual skill and fatigue ratings. Every squadron and group has a commander, whose inspiration characteristic can help reduce fatigue and get more aircraft into the air. Air formations can be assigned up to two mission options, a primary mission and a secondary mission, each morning. Each formation may be assigned a different target or mission. Missions include combat air patrol, search, anti-submarine, sweep, escort, attack airfield, attack port, attack troops, training, camera recon, naval interdiction and supply transport. Seaplanes and cargo aircraft can also transport troops. They can also be assigned to fly at a specific altitude. Air groups from aircraft carriers, battleships and cruisers can also be transferred to bases and air groups at bases, if properly trained can operate from aircraft carriers. Aircraft are very useful in locating and attacking enemy fleets or bombing enemy bases and airfields. Combat air patrol can brunt the effects of an air attack or even turn a group around, if they deal out enough damage. Air strikes may not find the target at all, especially in bad weather or against naval targets at extreme range. Each base operating aircraft will need crews to repair and reload the aircraft. These are called base forces and in addition to maintaining the aircraft, they maintain the airfield and runway. A shortage of support units in the base force can ground many of the aircraft stationed there. Airfields are rated according to the runway. A small dirt field will produce many more crashed landings than a large concrete runway, even among experienced pilots. And, of course the player will have to keep the forward bases well supplied, if the air groups are to be of any value.<br/><br/>It Will Take More Then Just Fighting Forces <br/>Troops are needed to maintain and garrison bases and to deprive the enemy of his bases. So, troops are handled with care. There are a goodly number of different types of land-based units. For instance, American divisions have a headquarters, three regimental combat teams and an engineer battalion. These are all represented by different unit counters and have different capabilities. Units include engineers, combat squads, Marine squads, support squads, air support sections, Sherman tanks, Stuart tanks, motorized forces, a number of mortars and field artillery and many others. There are a myriad of different organizational tables of equipment for the various units. For instance, the Sasebo 5th AA Battalion has: 75mm AAA x 4, dual 40mm AAA x 2, 13mm AAA x 10 and 14 support squads. Troops may be ordered to move, defend, bombard or make a variety of attacks. Engineers may also expand airfields or ports or repair damage done to these and build fortifications. Vehicular travel, while rapid, is limited to primary roads. Foot troops can travel on secondary roads or up to 50 miles into the jungle. Anti-aircraft units can shoot at aircraft or troops. Medium and heavy artillery can target units for bombardment and can also shoot at ships, as can coastal batteries. All land-based units have leaders and are also affected by leaders to whom there unit is subordinate. Troops use a lot of supply and keeping them supplied can be quite a challenge, if within enemy bomber range. The game uses a novel automatic supply system. The player can create supply fleets and place then under computer control. The fleets will then try to go back and forth, supplying bases, as needed. Since the system is not abstracted, the player may take control of these fleets at any time.<br/><br/>Campaigns <br/>There are 18 campaigns included with the game, which can be played against the computer opponent, hot-seat, by secure email. The player may also create campaigns of his own, using the Campaign Editor. The player can choose many game options concerning limited intelligence, music and sound effects, the length of pause between messages, the types and number of messages shown, the length of the turn and other factors allow the player to tailor the game to suit his playing style. Campaigns include a 1943 campaign, two 1942 campaigns, a battle of Coral Sea scenario and many others.<br/><br/>"}, "77542": {"statistics": {}, "name": "The Next Tetris", "videogamemode": {"2422": "Local Multiplayer"}, "videogameversion": {"53993": "Playstation North America edition"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic916576.jpg", "videogametheme": {"2455": "Abstract"}, "videogamefranchise": {"5269": "Tetris"}, "average": "7.5", "videogamegenre": {"2165": "Puzzle"}, "videogameplatform": {"4433": "PlayStation"}, "usersrated": "2", "poll": {}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic916576_t.jpg", "description": "From the back of the Playstation edition case:<br/><br/>If you think you've mastered Tetris, then think again!

New reforms in the Austrian army, including reorganization, as well as Napoleon&iexcl;&brvbar;s interest in fighting the British on the Iberian Peninsula fueled Austria's desire for revenge for having suffered numerous sharp defeats at French hands. The Austrians quickly pushed aside French resistance in the region, until Napoleon himself arrived on the field. Taking immediate action, he threw his troops across the Danube and struck at a surprised Austrian foe, cutting it in two. Marching into Vienna, Napoleon sought a decisive battle with Charles's army. Poor weather combined with a torrential river caused a large portion of France's army to be caught on the wrong side of the river as revitalized Austrian troops hit them hard. Eventually Napoleon managed to extract his men from the danger, but not after having suffered nearly 21,000 casualties to the Austrian's 23,000. While the myth of French invincibility had been credibly destroyed, not two days later Napoleon crushed the Austrians at Wagram, inflicting 40,000 casualties and forcing Austria to sue for peace and join his vaunted Continental System. With this new offering from Matrix Games and Adanac, players may command these historic, powerful armies as they face off against each other in a clash that would be destined to defeat Austria but prove for a brief time that Napoleon could indeed be stopped. Players will be able to take command of the French forces under Napoleon or Austrians under Charles and strike at each other over a large hex-based map. Cavalry, infantry, artillery, engineers, leaders, supply wagons, depots, and other counters may be maneuvered for maximum military effect, while the flexible combat system may be used either through the game system itself or through miniatures play. This battle was by no means a foregone conclusion; the French could have easily handled the Austrians had the fateful river crossing not conspired against them, and the Austrians could just as well have held against The Little Corporal and dealt the French a stunning defeat. Now, with &quot; The Campaigns of the Danube 1805 &amp; 1809 &quot;, players may indulge in one of seven scenarios that focus on the region's conflicts, including battles fought there in 1805. One of the features of this game system involves the player's role; as overall commander of a side, the player issues orders to their corps commanders, who in turn issue orders to the maneuver elements. All of this takes time, and sometimes (due to enemy action, accident, or getting lost), these orders never arrive! Long-range planning and strategic thinking are required to keep a large army on the move, well-supplied, and eager for victory. For any connoisseur of Napoleonic gaming, The Campaigns of the Danube 1805 &amp; 1809 is a fascinating and fast-paced game that is bound to provide countless hours of surprises and conquest.<br/><br/>"}, "77564": {"videogame": {"105482": "H\u03bbLF-LIFE\u00b2: Holiday 2006 Collection"}, "statistics": {}, "name": "Counter-Strike: Source", "videogamemode": {"2310": "Network Multiplayer"}, "videogameversion": {"54024": "North American Macintosh edition"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic782401.jpg", "videogameseries": {"6733": "Counter-Strike"}, "videogametheme": {"2317": "War - Modern"}, "videogamegenre": {"2160": "First Person Shooter"}, "average": "7.4241", "videogamefranchise": {"27676": "Better Description Needed"}, "videogameplatform": {"5248": "Linux"}, "usersrated": "117", "poll": {}, "videogamecompilation": {"105482": "H\u03bbLF-LIFE\u00b2: Holiday 2006 Collection"}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic782401_t.jpg", "description": "Counter-Strike: Source is a remake of Counter-Strike, and consequently retains its team-based objective-oriented first-person shooter style gameplay. The aim of playing a map is to accomplish a map's objective. There are many types of objectives that a map can have, but the ultimate goal of the game is to win more rounds than the opposing team, which is accomplished by fulfilling the map's winning conditions. Some winning conditions include defusing a bomb, planting a bomb and preventing it from being defused by the other team, rescuing all the hostages on a map, preventing the hostages from being rescued, and defeat all the members of the opposing team. When playing on a server without modifications, if players are defeated during a round, they do not respawn until the next round, unlike in many other first-person shooter games, where players respawn on a set timer.<br/><br/>Moving and shooting also differs noticeably from many other first-person shooters. Shooting while moving dramatically decreases accuracy, and holding the mouse button down to continuously shoot will generally produce severe recoil. Recoil can be difficult for beginning players to compensate for because the player's reticle does not correspond with where the bullets actually hit during continuous fire, so beginning players may aim too high during automatic fire. The amount of damage done by a bullet varies dramatically depending upon the body part the bullet hits, with great emphasis on shooting the enemy in the head, which is almost invariably lethal.<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;<a target='_blank' href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Counter-Strike' rel='nofollow'>http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Counter-Strike</a>:_Source,&quot; available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "77565": {"videogame": {"83927": "The Complete Ultima VII"}, "statistics": {}, "name": "Ultima VII: Forge of Virtue", "videogamemode": {"2149": "Single-Player"}, "videogameversion": {"54025": "MS-DOS edition"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic778297.jpg", "videogameseries": {"4804": "Ultima"}, "videogametheme": {"2148": "Fantasy"}, "videogamefranchise": {"5413": "Ultima"}, "videogameexpansion": {"76875": "Ultima VII: The Black Gate"}, "average": "7.70333", "videogamegenre": {"2155": "RPG"}, "videogameplatform": {"4714": "DOS"}, "usersrated": "21", "poll": {}, "videogamecompilation": {"83927": "The Complete Ultima VII"}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic778297_t.jpg", "description": "User Summary<br/><br/>Ultima VII: Forge of Virtue is the expansion for Ultima VII: The Black Gate.

Invisible War was well-received commercially, holding 80 and 84 scores at Metacritic for the Windows and Xbox versions, respectively, and selling more than 300,000 copies in North America. Despite this, the game's critical reception was not as positive as its predecessor's for example, PC Gamer gave Deus Ex a score of 94%, while Invisible War received an 83%. This was due to a large number of design choices, which led certain critics to label the game as being dumbed down from its predecessor. It has sold more than 1.2 million copies, as of April 23, 2009.<br/><br/>Invisible War takes place twenty years after Deus Ex, in a world being rebuilt after a catastrophic event called The Collapse. Following a terrorist attack that destroys the city of Chicago, the player assumes the role of Alex D, a trainee at the fictional Tarsus Academy, whose support is sought by several organizations. As the game progresses, the player learns of conspiratorial factions which seek to drastically change the world. Invisible War was designed to allow player choice in both plot and gameplay, with branching plot lines and emergent gameplay elements.

However, the bubbles are just as deadly to the player if they are launched in his or her direction. Only certain tougher enemies can launch bubbles. Certain bubbles contain useful items, pushing them together can rack up points. Bubbles that are blue, purple, yellow, or green will bounce off of surfaces once they have been launched, bouncing a number of times dependent on their color, for example blues bounce once, purples twice etc. Some bubbles also contain dynamite, which will detonate either by igniting or by being pushed towards a target. There are two kinds of dynamite, a red one and a purple one; the latter has a much larger blast radius. Occasionally, a bonus bubble will float up across the screen, which can bestow powers of invisibility, or temporarily capture all enemies in static bubbles.

One sample entry reads in part, &quot;The aroma of vanilla makes the senses reel [...] Gems stud the south wall&quot;.

There are 4 distinct seasons, 3 of which you can grow different types of crops. Examples include: Strawberries and turnips in the spring, tomatoes and pineapples in the summer, and yams in the fall. There are many other crops, and you can grow flowers, which can all be sold for gold (the game's currency.) Farming is only half of the game. The other half is dungeon crawling. There are four very different dungeons, three of which represent the four different seasons (the third dungeon represents both autumn and winter). In these dungeons, crops of that dungeon's seasonal affiliation can be grown. The fourth dungeon, Whale Island, is omni-seasonal, and all crops can be grown there at any time.<br/><br/>Another feature is the concept of Runey distribution. Runeys come in four different variations: water, rock, tree and grass. Runeys represent the ecosystem of Trampoli; when Runeys are in perfect harmony, the area that they occupy reaches a state of Prosperity, and crops in that area will grow much faster than normal. However, should even one area of Trampoli become devoid of Runeys, the ecosystem suffers, and crops grow much slower than normal. Runeys can be re-distributed from area to area using a tool called the Harvester, and the game itself distributes Runeys randomly across Trampoli daily. Every nine ripe crops in the field in front of the character's house also spawns one Runey daily.<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, Rune Factory Frontier , available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "77669": {"statistics": {}, "name": "NHL 09", "videogamemode": {"2310": "Network Multiplayer"}, "videogameversion": {"105294": "German PlayStation 3 version"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1151010.jpg", "videogameseries": {"4899": "NHL"}, "videogametheme": {"2367": "Sports - Hockey"}, "videogamegenre": {"2157": "Sports"}, "usersrated": "32", "average": "7.64406", "videogamefranchise": {"4894": "EA Sports"}, "videogameplatform": {"4435": "PlayStation 3"}, "videogamehonor": {"31118": "2008 Spike Best Sports Game of the Year Winner"}, "poll": {}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1151010_t.jpg", "description": "&quot;NHL 09 is the 18th video game in the NHL series released by EA Sports.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;NHL 09 introduced several new features from the previous year's edition of the game.

It was developed by Park Place Productions, North America's largest independent development company owned by Michael Knox and Troy Lyndon. This version of NHL Hockey was also the first game to include the EA Sports  logo. It was considered the most realistic hockey game of its time. The game used a vertical view, which was unique at the time since most previous hockey games used a horizontal or top-down view. It also features a National Hockey League  license, so all of the team names and logos are used. However, lack of a license from the National Hockey League Players' Association NHLPA resulted in all players being referred to by their numbers rather than names. The Mega Drive version was released soon after, titled EA Hockey  and featured international teams. However, this change is merely cosmetic, as most team colors could be tracked to NHL teams. Although the game has all of the NHL teams that existed at the time, the only competition present is the Playoffs, either decided in one or seven matches.<br/><br/>A component of the game which added to the game-play was the fact that fights would breakout in the event of a bad bodycheck. Players would fight with a computer player (or a friend in 2 player mode) which would go on until one fell down, ultimately losing the fight. During the fights the crowd would cheer and all other team mates and officials would stand by watching. After the fight was completed normal game play would resume. No advantage or disadvantage would be had from winning or losing a fight.&quot;<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, NHL Hockey , available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "77672": {"statistics": {}, "name": "NASCAR Racing 2003", "videogamemode": {"2310": "Network Multiplayer"}, "videogameversion": {"54199": "US Mac/Windows edition"}, "average": "9.8", "videogameseries": {"6988": "NASCAR Racing"}, "videogametheme": {"2456": "Driving"}, "usersrated": "5", "videogamegenre": {"2154": "Racing"}, "videogameplatform": {"4729": "Macintosh"}, "poll": {}, "description": "NASCAR Racing 2003 Season, or NR2003 for short, is a computer racing simulator released in February 2003 by Papyrus for PC and Mac OS X.

The game is split up into levels, which the player must progess through one at a time to proceed in the game. The player is given a certain amount of lives, which are lost when Crash is attacked by an enemy or falls into water or a pit. If all lives are lost at any point in the game, the &quot;Game Over&quot; screen will appear, in which the player can continue from the last level played by selecting &quot;Yes&quot;.<br/><br/>Crash has the ability to jump into the air and land on an enemy character, as well as the ability to spin in a tornado-like fashion to knock enemies off-screen. An enemy that is attacked by Crash's spin attack can be launched into another enemy that is on-screen at the same time. These same techniques can be used to open the numerous boxes found in each stage. Most boxes in the game contain Wumpa Fruit, which give the player an extra life if 100 of them are collected. Another item found inside crates is the Witch Doctor's Mask, which shields Crash from one enemy attack. Collecting three of these masks in a row grants Crash temporary invulnerability from all minor dangers. Arrow boxes (marked with arrows pointing up) propel Crash further than his ordinary jump can, while TNT boxes explode after a three-second fuse when jumped on. Boxes with an exclamation mark (!) on them cause previously intangible objects in the area to solidify. Check Point boxes allow Crash to return to the point where the first Check Point box has been opened upon losing a life. If more than one Check Point box has been opened in a stage, Crash returns to the last Check Point box that has been opened.<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;Crash Bandicoot,&quot; available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "77679": {"videogame": {"94075": "Taito Legends 2"}, "statistics": {}, "name": "Alpine Ski", "videogamemode": {"2422": "Local Multiplayer"}, "videogameversion": {"54209": "Alpine Ski"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1549948.png", "videogametheme": {"2371": "Sports - Skiing"}, "usersrated": "1", "average": "2", "videogamegenre": {"2157": "Sports"}, "videogameplatform": {"4781": "Arcade"}, "poll": {}, "videogamecompilation": {"94075": "Taito Legends 2"}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1549948_t.png", "description": "&quot;The player controls a skier, who can move left, right, or increase forward speed.

Subsequently, development of the game halted. Namco Bandai Games provided free ongoing US/EU server support in the fall of Flagship Studios until 31 January 2009, when the US/EU multiplayer game servers and websites were taken offline.HanbitSoft has since acquired properties to the game and it is being developed and played in Korea to date.

The game featured both singleplayer and online multiplayer support when it was released although US/EU online support has since shutdown. Flagship Studios released 1 major MP content update The Stonehenge Chronicles and the 2nd The Abyss Chronicles on the test server before the studios closure. Similar to the Diablo series, randomization is embedded into many of the game mechanics including weapon and armor attributes, item drops, mob spawns and level composition.

Additional NHL jerseys and logos were also available including those of the defunct Atlanta Flames, Winnipeg Jets, Colorado Rockies (NHL), Quebec Nordiques as well as the old style Los Angeles Kings, Washington Capitals and Vancouver Canucks uniforms of the 1970s and '80s.<br/><br/>The IIHF license which granted the World Cup mode also allowed EA to use real-life international jerseys for the only time (previously released games used unique jerseys designed by the game's staff which only bore a passing similarity to their real life counterparts, so the jersey shows their flag.) The PC version of the game was stripped down to the bare essentials, including the omitting of the create-a-player feature. These omissions were possibly due to the labour dispute that season, but EA explained that they hadn't perfected the new create-a-player interface, which would have allowed for far greater customizability that what was previously available.

If this occurs then the player's vehicle is hoisted back onto the track (by a nearby crane) which costs valuable time. Turbo can be used to make a car go faster, but it can only be used for a limited amount of time in each race. The game received positive reviews when it was published.

Each fireteam has a Team Leader equipped with an M4 carbine. The Team Leaders also carry the Global Positioning System, which can be used to locate mission objectives and enemy locations, and a radio for communication with headquarters. The second team member is the Automatic Rifleman, equipped with an M249 Squad Automatic Weapon, used to lay suppressive fire on the enemy and assigned to take command if the team leader is shot. The third team member is the Grenadier, equipped with an M4 with an M203 grenade launcher attachment. The last team member is the Rifleman, equipped with a M4 carbine. If a member of the team is wounded, another member of the team will carry them. Lieutenant Phillips is the team commander and the player will usually find him with the CASEVACs, which are healing and ammunition points. Each fireteam has a limited amount of fragmentation and smoke grenades, in addition to the M203 grenades. Occasionally throughout the game, there will be a third asset designated as Charlie Team, ranging from anti-armor engineers to US Army Rangers.<br/><br/>Throughout the game, the player does not directly control any of the fireteam members; instead, orders are given using a cursor that projects onto the environment, letting the player tell his/her soldiers to hold a position and set a specific zone to cover with fire. It is also possible to order them to lay down suppressive fire on a given zone to cover the second squad's movement, or to reduce incoming fire.<br/><br/>Gameplay revolves around the concept of fire and movement, with one team providing suppressive fire while the other moves. The basic gameplay mechanics remain the same for the retail version of Full Spectrum Warrior, which was released on the Xbox, PlayStation 2 and Windows platforms. The retail version places much more emphasis on aesthetics; it possesses substantially improved graphics and sound. Cut scenes and voice acting are also characteristics that distinguish the retail version from the military version.

This release concentrates on multiplayer, with up to 8 players on a single PC, and up to 10 when playing over a network!<br/><br/>The gameplay follows the standard Bomberman style - drop a bomb, run away before it explodes. When setting bombs, the early aim is to blow up destructible portions of the arena, which would then drop power-ups. These range from giving you extra bombs, and larger explosions, to the ability to pick up bombs or to set off your bombs by remote control.<br/><br/>When you have built up a decent arsenal, your focus switches to trying to blow up your opponents. The last man standing on the level wins!<br/><br/>As well as powerups, sometimes 'diseases' are uncovered by your explosions. These include 'Short Fuse' where your bombs explode more quickly than normal, 'Molasses' where your bomberman is slowed to a crawl, and the highly frightening 'Diarrhoea' where you cannot stop dropping bombs! These diseases can be passed on to other players by touching them, providing an additional dimension to the game.<br/><br/>From the manual<br/><br/>For those of you not familiar with the Bomberman experience, I will spare you the details.

The game features several rappers, including Snoop Dogg, Method Man, Redman, Fat Joe, Ice-T, Xzibit, and Busta Rhymes, as well as the voices and likeness of other actors and celebrities, among them actors Omar Epps, Christopher Judge, Danny Trejo, Carmen Electra, and Kimora Lee Simmons. The game was spun off into a 2006 PlayStation Portable game called Def Jam Fight for NY: The Takeover.The game emphasizes strikes more, as well as proper use of the arena's environment and the surrounding crowd. Tossing the opponent against barriers gives fighters the opportunity to inflict massive damage to their opponent by tossing or slamming them into the wall headfirst, or using other features of the environment, such as slamming a door or gate in their face.<br/><br/>The crowd will shove a fighter back into combat if he is thrown into them or gets too close, and will sometimes hold a fighter, leaving them open to attack. Some spectators carry weapons, and will offer them to the fighters, or even attack a fighter if the guy next to them holds him.<br/><br/>Momentum is gained by successfully performing moves, countering, and taunting the opponent. The rate at which momentum is gained is effected by the fighter's Charisma, which is set for most fighters. Created fighters can set their own charisma with a combination of clothes, tattoos, and jewelry; the more expensive, the better. A fighter with a good set of clothes, extensive tattoos, or laden with jewellery can often fill their momentum meter in just a few moves.<br/>When the momentum meter is full, a fighter can activate it, which results in a Blazin' Taunt. In this state, the fighter is said to be &quot;Blazin&quot;, and can pull off a Blazin' Move, a powerful and brutal attack personalized for each character. A created character can learn every single Blazin' Move in the game, but can only have up to four usable at any one time.<br/><br/>With the focus taken from mixed martial arts, the only way to win a fight is through Knock Out or Submission. A character can be made to submit by putting them into submission holds until the health bar of a single body part is depleted.<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, Def Jam: Fight for NY , available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "77818": {"statistics": {}, "name": "Zombie Tycoon", "videogamemode": {"2149": "Single-Player"}, "videogameversion": {"54487": "PSP  edition"}, "average": "6", "videogameseries": {"24207": "Zombie Tycoon"}, "videogametheme": {"2319": "Cartoon"}, "usersrated": "2", "videogamegenre": {"2166": "Real Time Strategy"}, "videogameplatform": {"4432": "PSP"}, "poll": {}, "description": "Zombie Tycoon is a PlayStation Portable game that puts the player in charge of their very own undead horde.

The game introduces a tiny vacuum cleaner that Chibi-Robo can use to suck up dirt whilst connected to a power outlet and a tiny sifter used to find gems which can be turned in for money. The player can use the money to buy furniture for the house over a home shopping network using the telephone. The main difference from the original games in the series, is that instead of just having power outlets which let the player charge Chibi-Robo's battery, they need to put rubbish into a trash compactor to get electricity for the outlets.<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, Okaeri!
