Ratchet is given a &quot;DeadLock&quot; collar, which will explode if he becomes uncooperative. Ratchet defeats Dreadzone's most successful gladiators, the Exterminators, and becomes one of Dreadzone's most popular contestants. The three must find a way to deactivate the collars, and free the other heroes being held prisoner.<br/><br/>The gameplay is similar to other games in the series, but focuses more on shooter aspects rather than platforming. The player, as Ratchet, fights in Dreadzone tournaments across the &quot;Shadow Sector&quot; in the &quot;Solana&quot; Galaxy, with a large variety of weapons. This game was the first in the series to feature cooperative gameplay in a story mode, and also includes an online multiplayer mode.

There are 8 tracks and 321 vehicles, all of which are fictional. This iteration was one of the first games on the PlayStation to feature gouraud shading on the polygons, giving the game a visual depth that was previously missing. It was also the first Ridge Racer game on the Sony system to feature a two-player split screen mode, and featured two different driving models.<br/>  The main mode of the game is &quot;Grand Prix&quot;, where players take on the role of a racing driver new to the game's fictional &quot;Real Racing Roots '99&quot; Grand Prix. The Grand Prix is split into 4 stages - 2 qualifying races, 2 quarter-final races, 3 semi-finals and one Final race on New Year's Eve  1999 - between which the player receives either a new car or an upgrade to their current one, based on their performance in the stage. In order to unlock every one of the cars, the player must race with every racing team and every manufacturer, in every qualifying position possible, hence enhancing the longevity of the game.<br/>  R4 featured two models of handling; drift handling was the classic Ridge Racer handling where the player oversteers into the turn to slide the car around the corner, whereas grip handling is more realistic, employing the brake more and not utilising powerslides at all.&quot;<br/><br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, R4: Ridge Racer Type 4 , available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "77844": {"poll": [], "name": "Mutant League Hockey", "videogamemode": ["Local Multiplayer", "Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["US Genesis"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic814060.jpg", "videogametheme": ["Horror", "Sports - Hockey"], "videogamegenre": ["Sports"], "videogamedeveloper": ["Electronic Arts (EA)"], "videogamefranchise": ["Mutant League"], "videogameplatform": ["SEGA Genesis"], "usersrated": "9", "average": "7.22222", "statistics": [], "videogamepublisher": ["Electronic Arts (EA)"], "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic814060_t.jpg", "description": "  Mutant League Hockey is a hockey game that was released in 1994 for the Sega Genesis.

Players may substitute their goalie for a demon  goalie, a gigantic demon head that takes the place of the net; scoring on a demon goal causes it to explode. In addition, the crowd is prone to throwing weapons or other powerups onto the ice; they may be picked up and used freely. When a player dies, their corpse remains on the ice and may be tripped on; between periods, a giant slug acting as an ice resurfacer eats the debris littering the ice. As in real hockey, fights may break out. Fights in Mutant League Hockey are done as a minigame, where the objective is to knockout the opponent. Both players are still sent to the penalty box, but the player who got knocked out also takes an additional penalty for losing.<br/> Source: Wikipedia, Mutant League Hockey , available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "77845": {"poll": [], "name": "Kennedy Approach", "videogamemode": ["Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["Atari Release", "Commodore 64 Edition"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2942837.jpg", "videogametheme": ["Commercial / Public Transport", "Flight"], "usersrated": "4", "videogamedeveloper": ["MicroProse"], "videogamegenre": ["Strategy"], "videogameplatform": ["Atari 8-bit family", "Commodore 64"], "average": "7.75", "statistics": [], "videogamepublisher": ["MicroProse"], "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2942837_t.jpg", "description": "User Summary<br/><br/>Air Traffic Control simulator with wide degree of difficulty levels--from Atlanta on the graveyard shift to JFK/La Guardia at prime time.

The robots are highly customizable, in aspects such as equipment, special attacks, body color and name. The player is allowed to build a maximum of three robots. Unlike many RPGs, the player must invent or create the robots equipment, use &quot;Program Points&quot; to set the robot's attributes (as opposed to these attributes being set by the game), and program special attacks in a macro-like fashion, although certain commands do special effects instead.<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, Robotrek , available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "77847": {"poll": [], "name": "Super Bomberman 2", "videogamemode": ["Local Multiplayer", "Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["US SNES"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1247978.jpg", "videogameseries": ["Bomberman"], "videogametheme": ["Other"], "usersrated": "19", "videogamedeveloper": ["Hudson Soft"], "videogamegenre": ["Action"], "videogameplatform": ["SNES"], "average": "7.28947", "statistics": [], "videogamepublisher": ["Nintendo Co., Ltd."], "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1247978_t.jpg", "description": "&quot;Super Bomberman 2 is the second of five video games in the Bomberman series developed by Hudson Soft to be released for the Super Nintendo.

It is developed by 2K Czech, previously known as Illusion Softworks, and is published by 2K Games.  Originally announced in August 2008 at the Leipzig Games Convention, it was released on PlayStation 3, Xbox 360 and Microsoft Windows in August 2010.<br/><br/>The game is set from 1943 to 1951 in Empire Bay (the name is a reference to New York's state nickname &quot;The Empire State&quot;),  a fictional city based on San Francisco and New York City, with influences from Chicago and Detroit. The game will feature a completely open-ended game map of 10 square miles. No restrictions are included from the start of the game.  There will also be around 50 vehicles in the game, as well as licensed music from the era.<br/><br/>Many firearms from the previous game will make a return. For example the Thompson submachine gun, the Colt 1911 and a pump-action shotgun. As seen in screenshots, new WWII-era weapons like the MP 40, the M3 submachine gun, and the Beretta Model 38 will make an appearance in the game as well as the MG 42.<br/><br/>Interacting with objects in the environment involves two action buttons- a standard action and a &quot;violent&quot; action (for example, when stealing a car, the player may choose to either pick its lock or break the window glass), used in context-sensitive situations. A map will be included as in the original Mafia game. The checkpoint system has been completely overhauled. New controls include a cover system that allows the player to hide behind objects (such as generators, walls and large crates) to shoot enemies, rather than just using a crouch while behind an object. Flanking may be a large part of the combat.<br/><br/>It has been stated by 2K Czech that the game's cutscenes are created by the game engine, in real-time, rather than pre-rendered cutscenes.<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;<a target='_blank' href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mafia_II,&quot' rel='nofollow'>http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mafia_II,&quot</a>; available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "77887": {"poll": [], "name": "R:Racing Evolution", "videogamemode": ["Local Multiplayer", "Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["English/European GameCube edition", "North American GameCube edition", "North American PlayStation 2 edition", "North American Xbox edition"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1031541.jpg", "videogametheme": ["Driving"], "usersrated": "1", "videogamedeveloper": ["Namco Ltd."], "videogamegenre": ["Racing"], "videogameplatform": ["GameCube", "PlayStation 2", "Xbox"], "average": "8", "statistics": [], "videogamepublisher": ["Namco Ltd."], "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1031541_t.jpg", "description": "From the back of the box:<br/><br/>R: Racing Evolution is an extraordinary action-racing experience featuring authentic licensed cars and daring, real-world tracks.

The default weapon is a weak machine gun with unlimited ammo.<br/><br/>Contrary to first-person shooters, however, the goal is not just to stay alive and reach the next level, but to kill a given percentage of the armed NPCs on the map. Only then the exit to the next level is activated.<br/><br/>There is no plot as such. The presence of a moving van on the first level suggests that the Postal Dude has been evicted from his home and is therefore &quot;going postal&quot;, but no background story evolves during the game.<br/><br/>An add-on to the game called Special Delivery was made in 1998 which featured four new levels (department store, shanty town, earthquake zone and vacation resort), new characters, new sounds, new modes of play (co-op and a refined deathmatch).

In the game, Mickey Mouse and Donald Duck are sucked into a magical world, while preparing for a magic act. Now they must survive over a dozen different side-scrolling levels, in order to return home.<br/><br/>The game's music, artwork and animation shows influences from classic Disney animated films, including; Aladdin, The Little Mermaid, The Sword in the Stone, Alice in Wonderland and Pinocchio. The game included many features that broke the standard platforming mold. It also seems to have an inspirational effect on Kingdom Hearts as many of the worlds are visited again.<br/><br/>Mickey and Donald can run, jump, or attack by flourishing their capes. Enemies defeated in this way turn into doves, cards, or other harmless objects depending on the enemy. After defeating the boss of each level, a new magic spell is learned, allowing the pair to traverse the next level; i.e. flying on a magic carpet or going underwater in an air bubble.

For instance, Mickey can squeeze through certain gaps, while Donald must find a different route; if both are playing, Mickey can pull Donald through the gap. Either can stand on the others' shoulders to ascend higher, and lower a rope to pull the other up.<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;World_of_Illusion,&quot; available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "77914": {"videogame": ["Postal Fudge Pack"], "poll": [], "name": "Postal\u00b2", "videogamemode": ["Network Multiplayer", "Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["English/European Windows edition", "North American Linux Edition", "North American Windows (Share Pain) edition", "North American Windows edition", "Windows/Macintosh Downloadable edition"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic829872.jpg", "videogameseries": ["Postal"], "videogametheme": ["Adult / Mature", "Morbid"], "usersrated": "21", "videogameexpansion": ["Postal 2: Apocalypse Weekend"], "videogamedeveloper": ["Running With Scissors, Inc."], "videogamegenre": ["Shoot 'em Up"], "videogameplatform": ["Linux", "Macintosh", "Windows"], "average": "5.59286", "statistics": [], "videogamepublisher": ["Linux Game Publishing", "Running With Scissors, Inc.", "Tri Synergy", "Whiptail Interactive"], "videogamecompilation": ["Postal Fudge Pack"], "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic829872_t.jpg", "description": "Postal 2 is a first-person shooter video game by Running with Scissors, and it is the sequel to the 1997 game Postal. Both are intentionally highly controversial due to high levels of violence and stereotyping. Unlike its predecessor, Postal 2 is played completely in first-person based on the Unreal Graphics Engine. Due to its graphic nature the game has been banned in Australia and several other places.<br/><br/>The game levels are split into days of the week starting Monday and finishing Friday. At the beginning of each day, Dude is given several tasks to accomplish, such as 'Get milk', 'Confess sins', and other seemingly mundane tasks. The purpose of the game is to finish all of the tasks throughout the week, and the player can accomplish these tasks in any way he wishes, be it as civilly or as chaotically as possible (it is possible, if occasionally difficult, to complete most tasks without engaging in battle, or, at least, killing other people). The daily tasks can be accomplished in any order, and the game includes one task that is only activated on a certain day if Dude performs a certain action.<br/><br/>One of the major concepts of Postal 2 is that it is meant to be a &quot;living world&quot;, a simulation of a tongue-in-cheek off-kilter town. Game characters live out their lives completely separate from the actions of Dude; walking around town, buying and selling merchandise, and even engaging in random shootouts with each other and the police.<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;<a target='_blank' href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Postal%C2%B2,&quot' rel='nofollow'>http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Postal%C2%B2,&quot</a>; available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "77915": {"poll": [], "name": "Rubicon: Republic in Crisis", "playingtime": "100", "minplayers": "3", "boardgamemechanic": ["Action Point Allowance System", "Dice Rolling", "Simultaneous Action Selection", "Voting"], "yearpublished": "2010", "usersrated": "2", "boardgamefamily": ["Ancient Rome"], "maxplayers": "6", "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic787768_t.jpg", "average": "5", "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["The Game Crafter, LLC"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic787768.jpg", "boardgameversion": ["First Edition"], "maxplaytime": "100", "boardgamecategory": ["Ancient", "Political"], "age": "14", "minplaytime": "100", "description": "Rubicon: Republic In Crisis is a fast-paced, historical strategy game based on the politics of the late Roman Republic.

Many critics likened the game to the Pok&eacute;mon series, but praised the game's unique qualities.[1] In Japan, the game inspired merchandise based on the Metal Walker robots.[2]<br/><br/>Metal Walker's battles are unique from other games in the genre due to their billiard-style nature. Players move their Metal Walkers across the battlefield by hitting them into items, walls, or enemy Metal Walkers.<br/><br/>Although Metal Walker is a console RPG, battles are fought in a pinball or billiards-like atmosphere in a top-down perspective arena.[3] As each turn of the battle starts, players decide which direction a Metal Walker will move and how hard they will move. Players are encouraged to form strategies that allow Metal Walkers to hit a single enemy, bounce off a wall, and then hit another enemy, all in a single turn.[1] On the battlefield, players can throw several different types of items onto the field. The items are used when a Metal Walker hits them. Capsules and healing items strengthen and heal Metal Walkers, whereas attack items, such as Napalm, are only useful when the enemy hits them. There also exist Analyzers, which provide the player with Scan Data for any Metal Walker that is bounced into them. Scrap metal won after the battle can then be used with the Scan Data to create new Metal Walkers or purchase items. When an enemy is destroyed, the player's Metal Walker will gain experience points and an item might be obtained. If the player's Metal Walker runs out of Hit points, the player will lose half of the carried scraps and have to start from the last save point.<br/><br/>Outside of battle, players explore a top-down overworld where they can explore various towns and dungeons. Most battles occur as random encounters. The overworld has several interactable elements, such as water, which the player needs a certain number of Cores to cross. The player can only carry one Metal Walker at a time and it will follow the main character on the overworld.[2] By defeating the game's bosses, players earn Core Units, which allow Metal Walkers to evolve into new, stronger forms.<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, Metal Walker , available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "77930": {"poll": [], "name": "BattleForge", "videogamemode": ["Cooperative", "Network Multiplayer", "Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["PC DVD"], "average": "5", "videogametheme": ["Fantasy"], "usersrated": "1", "videogamedeveloper": ["Electronic Arts (EA)"], "videogamegenre": ["Strategy"], "videogameplatform": ["Windows"], "statistics": [], "videogamepublisher": ["Electronic Arts (EA)"], "description": "From the Developer Website<br/><br/>BattleForge is a next-gen real time strategy game, in which you fight epic battles against evil along with your friends.

The player controls one hero of his choice, and can switch on the fly, while the AI controls the other 2.  Each character can be customized with different attacks, and special moves can be chained together to produce combos.  Customization is also done through 'capacity cores', which give bonuses at each level increase when equipped, and 'AD skills', a large list of passive abilities that can be learned and set for use.<br/><br/>The story revolves around the protagonist, Luke fon Fabre, and Tear Grants, a reserved young woman with whom he is thrown into an adventure.  Luke is from a high-ranking noble family in the nation of Kimlasca, and is directly related to the king.  He was kidnapped 7 years before the story begins, and although he was rescued, the experience cost him all memories of his childhood.  Since then, Luke has been confined to his family's estate in the city, visited only by them, servants, his teacher Master Van, and his good friend Guy.  When he meets Tear, though, he is forced into the outside world and has to deal with a brewing war and a secretive religious organization bent on guiding the world down a preordained path.<br/><br/>Similar to past entries, the story is further developed by optional extra scenes or 'skits' where the characters converse with each other.

Only at break time and lunch times are the girls allowed to mingle with the boys, in the central grassy playground, separated at other times by a high fence. The opening and closing of the fence is controlled by the school caretaker Albert, a new character to the game. It is also possible for Eric to sneak over the fence into the girls' school during lesson times, either using the bicycle (after completing the challenge of finding its lock's combination and then performing a tricky manoeuvre on it) or by watering the flower beside the fence and then jumping on it. When the girls and boys are allowed to mingle and when Eric gains access to the girls' school, he can kiss Hayley, who would then agree to do some of his lines for him.<br/><br/>Elements added in Back to Skool include stink bombs (used to trigger the opening of windows), water pistols, mice that can be released in the girls' school causing widespread panic, and sherry (which can be squirted into cups and used to &quot;intoxicate&quot; teachers by splashing it on them with correct timing).<br/><br/>It is possible to commit suicide by opening the top storey window and making Eric jump out. (Jumping out of a window is necessary to sneak into the girls' school, but only from the first floor - not the second.) When this happens, Eric would lie incapacitated on the ground outside the boys' school until Mr Wacker approaches and tells him &quot;Eric you are not a bird&quot;, and the game ends. This effectively replaced the mumps instant Game Over from Skool Daze.<br/><br/>There is a bug in the game that enables you to see what goes on in the girls' school without leaving the boys' school. To do this go as far left as possible in the Blue Room, then face right and press the key that would have Eric pick up a mouse or frog (C). The whole screen will scroll if you press any button until it goes all the way to the girls' school. Once the scrolling is complete Eric can move around as usual, unseen, and will NOT pick up any lines. You can, through trial and error, get to the girls' school upon which the game will go back to normal.

It was designed and programmed by Pete Cooke. It was groundbreaking at the time for its extensive use of 3D graphics, shadow effects and its large gameworld set on a small planet, Tau Ceti III, orbiting the titular star. The planet also has a realistic day and night cycle (much shorter than our own).<br/><br/>An enhanced version (known as Tau Ceti - The Special Edition) was released for the 128K Spectrum and Amstrad CPC in 1987 featuring extra graphics and a large amount of accessible library data about the gameworld and the game.<br/><br/>A sequel, Academy, was released in 1986.<br/><br/>The origins of Tau Ceti and its game engine came from Cooke attempting to work out how the spheres in the game Gyron, released by Firebird Software for the ZX Spectrum in 1985, had been created:<br/>&quot;...for a long while it had puzzled me how on earth they did the spheres. It obviously couldn't be a sprite because they didn't have enough memory to have that many sprites. I finally twigged that they must have used a table of line widths, and I thought about it a bit, then realised I could split it three quarters and a quarter, and then it would look like a shadow. I just went away and played with that for quite a long while and got it so that I had the sun in the sky and the shadow in the right place. And it sort of came from that, really.&quot;<br/>Having created the basics of a game engine, Cooke had to decide on a scenario for his new game:<br/>&quot;It was all made up as I went along. I know a bit about astronomy, so I looked around for a likely location - because the way the routine works meant it couldn't be in space; you couldn't have the sun above because the line-draw routine wouldn't work, it would have to be on the surface of a planet. And I thought 'Right, it can't be Earth because it looks a bit barren for Earth, it's got to be another planet.' So I looked round for nearby stars that might be inhabited and Tau Ceti had a nice-sounding name.&quot;<br/><br/>Cooke was also inspired when writing Tau Ceti by the works of the science-fiction writer Larry Niven and the space-simulator Elite.<br/><br/>Plot:<br/>Humanity has spread out and colonised nearby star systems but a plague in 2150 led to the colonies being abandoned and left to their automated robotic maintenance systems. While several of these colonies have been successfully re-inhabited, the colony on the planet Tau Ceti III (orbiting the star Tau Ceti) has been uncontactable since a meteor smashed into the planet. A mission sent to Tau Ceti III in 2164 landed on the planet but broadcast a mayday message followed by silence. Experts decided that the planet's robots were running amok as a result of the meteorite impact. The only chance, it was decided, of successfully stopping the defence systems without destroying the cities already there is to send a single pilot in an armoured Gal-Corp skimmer to the planet's surface with the task of shutting-down the central reactor in Tau Ceti III's capital, Centralis.<br/><br/>Gameplay:<br/>When it was released, Tau Ceti was an ambitious piece of software and its scale can still seem impressive. The planet Tau Ceti III consists of several cities which themselves consist of clusters of buildings with their defensive laser towers and patrolling robot Hunter ships. The player's skimmer can dock with some of these buildings and find parts needed to help shut-down the central reactor as well as refuel and find vital information. The cities themselves can be travelled to by means of a &quot;jump pad&quot; which makes the long trips between them much quicker.<br/><br/>Interestingly, if you did take the long trip between cities, a bug in the Amstrad CPC version meant you stayed in the same city when next using a jump pad. This can be used as an advantageous way of returning quickly to the center of the map, without traveling back through every city. This also allowed the player to jump to non-existent cities off the map[citation needed].<br/>The gameworld is displayed in a 3D view from the skimmer. As well as displaying these 3D graphics, Cooke's game engine renders them with simple shadows in order to simulate the day and night cycle of Tau Ceti III. These days are much shorter than Earth's consisting of one spin of the planet per hour with sixteen &quot;spins&quot; to a Centaurian day.<br/><br/>The cities of Tau Ceti III are an extremely hostile place as they are full of robot defences. These consist of laser towers, Fortresses (which are essentially better-armoured Towers), Hunter ships (of which there are three types: Mark I, Mark II and Mark III), and slowly-moving mines. To defend itself against these, the skimmer is armed with lasers, missiles, and AMMs (to destroy missiles fired by robot Hunters). The skimmer also has a shield although its power is limited and if the shield is badly depleted or exhausted, the skimmer will take damage and some of its systems will fail. They can be repaired at any supply centre.<br/><br/>Any static defences (e.g. buildings) which are destroyed are permanently destroyed. Any mobile defences (Hunters, droids, etc) are renewed when the player leaves a city; so cities are never fully cleared. Cities vary greatly in their defences; a few cities are almost undefended (just minefields), a few cities are very very intensely defended (e.g. Centralis, where the main reactor is).<br/><br/>The skimmer is also fitted with a scanner in order to detect buildings or Hunters not in its forward view or at a distance, and a compass to aid navigation. To cope with Tau Ceti III's frequent hours of darkness, the skimmer has an infra-red display mode and also carries a limited number of short-lived flares.<br/>Although Tau Ceti is primarily an action game, it has some text-input sections when the skimmer docks or lands on the planet's surface.

Volume production started in the spring of 1982, with machines being released on to the market in August at a price of US $595. Preceded by the Commodore VIC-20 and Commodore MAX Machine, the C64 features 64 kilobytes (65,536 bytes) of memory with sound and graphics performance that were superior to IBM-compatible computers of that time. It is commonly known as the C64 or C=64 (after the graphic logo on the case) and occasionally as the CBM 64 (for Commodore Business Machines), or VIC-64 It has also been affectionately nicknamed the &quot;breadbox&quot; and &quot;bullnose&quot; due to the shape and color of the first version of its casing.<br/><br/>During the C64's lifetime, sales totaled 30 million units, making it the best-selling single personal computer model of all time. For a substantial period of time (1983&ndash;1986), the C64 dominated the market with between 30% and 40% share and 2 million units sold per year, outselling the IBM PC clones, Apple Inc. computers, and Atari 8-bit family computers. Sam Tramiel, a former Atari president and the son of Commodore's founder, said in a 1989 interview &quot;When I was at Commodore we were building 400,000 C64s a month for a couple of years.&quot;<br/><br/>Part of its success was because it was sold in retail stores instead of electronics stores, and also because these machines can be directly plugged into an existing home television without any modifications. Commodore produced many of its parts in-house to control supplies and cost. It is sometimes compared to the Ford Model-T automobile for bringing a new technology to middle-class households via creative mass-production.<br/><br/>Approximately 10,000 commercial software titles were made for the Commodore 64 including development tools, office applications, and games. Various C64 emulators allow anyone with a modern computer, or a compatible game console, to run these programs today. The machine is also credited with popularizing the computer demo scene. The C64 is still used today by some computer hobbyists.<br/><br/>Since 28 March 2008, Commodore 64 games have been available to buy through Nintendo's Virtual Console service in Europe; the first games available were Uridium and International Karate. Later, on February 23, 2009, the Commodore 64 section was launched in North America with the first three titles, International Karate, The Last Ninja and Pitstop II.

Allowing players to go continuously from the end of their game into this new scenario, Russia&rsquo;s land army powerhouse and consolidated position squares off against the Western Allies naval and air superiority, and who&rsquo;s territory is massive, yet less easily defended.<br/><br/>As you play Gary Grigsby&rsquo;s World At War: A World Divided&trade;, the events of the war unfold around you through news reel reports covering both historical and hypothetical events, World at War features a variable set of historic events that will be unveiled dependant on how the war is going. As the United States, do you focus on Europe first or send more reinforcements to the Pacific, seeking an early defeat for Japan? As Germany, do you invade the Soviet Union in 1941 or prepare your forces to march into London? In Gary Grigsby&rsquo;s World At War: A World Divided&trade;, you have complete control over the production, research and military strategy for your side.<br/><br/>Source: From the Company Website<br/><br/>"}, "77539": {"poll": [], "name": "War Plan Orange: Dreadnoughts in the Pacific 1922 \u2013 1930", "videogamemode": ["Asynchronous Multiplayer", "Hotseat", "Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["Windows CD-ROM edition"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic794401.jpg", "videogametheme": ["Historical", "Military", "Ocean / Sea", "War - World War II"], "usersrated": "1", "videogameexpansion": ["War in the Pacific"], "videogamedeveloper": ["2 By 3 Games"], "videogamegenre": ["Management", "Strategy"], "videogameplatform": ["Windows"], "videogamehonor": ["2005 Charles S.

World War 1 has come and gone and the world has settled into an uneasy peace.  The alliance between the United States and the other powers is weak as the powers try to maintain peace in Europe.  Fearful of the growing strength of Japan, the United States created a series of plans in case of a pacific war with Japan.  Their name:  War Plan Orange.  Consisting of three different scenarios, War Plan Orange was a comprehensive and real life &quot;What if&quot; scenario for the war in the pacific.  In the world of Matrix Games a different story is going to unfold, and Japan, seeking natural resources to grow their power, will turn the full strength of their navy against the industrial giant of the United States.<br/><br/>Enter War Plan Orange:  Dreadnoughts in the Pacific 1922-1930, where you will command the pacific fleet for either power in four different campaigns.  The two major campaigns will take you from 1922 - 1926 and from 1926 - 1930.  With incredible attention to detail and historical accuracy, War Plan Orange is the perfect modification to War in the Pacific for anyone who loves the time period between World War 1 and World War 2.  The lack of airpower and inefficient fuels, as well as the natural resources required by both sides make War Plan Orange a completely different experience.<br/><br/>"}, "77540": {"poll": [], "name": "War in the Pacific", "videogamemode": ["Asynchronous Multiplayer", "Hotseat", "Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["Windows Matrix edition"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1095047.jpg", "videogametheme": ["Historical", "Military", "Ocean / Sea", "War - World War II"], "usersrated": "11", "videogameexpansion": ["War in the Pacific - Admiral's Edition", "War Plan Orange: Dreadnoughts in the Pacific 1922 \u2013 1930"], "videogamedeveloper": ["2 By 3 Games"], "videogamegenre": ["Strategy"], "videogameplatform": ["Windows"], "videogamehonor": ["2004 Charles S.

The scale is 60 miles per hex and losses are individual vehicles, aircraft, guns and squads. Since half the planet Earth is covered by the titanic Pacific struggle, the game is massive in scope, covering thousands of ships tens of thousands of aircraft.<br/><br/>The War At Sea - Besides critical hit locations for all weapons platforms and any radar installations, individual armor locations and a wealth of performance and characteristics data, each ship&rsquo;s crew has an experience rating for day and night combat. Every ship from mighty carriers and battleships down to gun boats has a commander with his own strengths and weaknesses. The game includes thousands of ships chosen from over 300 ship classes.<br/><br/>The War in the Air - A wide variety of aircraft are included in the game, ranging from the awkward P-39 and the nimble Zero, to the heavy hitting B-29 and the extremely fast and powerful Corsair. Pilots and crews are tracked separately from aircraft and have individual skill and fatigue ratings. When pilots are in short supply, they can be placed into the pilot pool and reassigned to other groups<br/><br/>The War on the Ground - Troops are needed to maintain and garrison bases and to deprive the enemy of his bases. So, troops are handled with care. There are a goodly number of different types of land-based units. The unit counters are mostly on division and brigade level, but there are many independent regiments and battalions. These are all represented by different unit counters and have different capabilities and include engineers, combat squads, Marine squads, support squads, air support sections, Sherman tanks, Stuart tanks, motorized forces, a number of mortars and field artillery and many others. There are 15 campaigns included with the game, which can be played against the computer opponent, hot seat, by secure email. War in the Pacific now gives you the chance to fight the entire war your way on every level.<br/><br/>Political Points - Some troops are restricted in deployment. Australian troops must be release from home defense, for instance, before they can be shipped off to fight in New Guinea. And, Admirals can&rsquo;t be everywhere, at once. Each day, each player accumulates political points which can be used to reassign assets to the various headquarters or to change leaders.<br/><br/>Japanese Production - Groups cannot fly without planes, ships need to be built and tanks have to come from somewhere. The Japanese player will never have enough industry to build all he needs. He can choose to increase the size of factories or change what they are building at the cost of retooling. He can also speed up or retard the building of specific ships to the possible detriment of the shipbuilding schedule. He will need oil and resources to make industry run and will want to capture locations with such materials as quickly as possible. Much of this gathering can be automated, but the player will be able to fine tune the procedure or manually order the loading and destination of his ships.<br/><br/>"}, "77541": {"poll": [], "name": "Uncommon Valor", "videogamemode": ["Asynchronous Multiplayer", "Hotseat", "Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["US PC Windows CD-ROM edition"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic923899.jpg", "videogametheme": ["Historical", "Military", "Ocean / Sea", "War - World War II"], "usersrated": "8", "videogamedeveloper": ["2 By 3 Games"], "videogamegenre": ["Strategy"], "videogameplatform": ["Windows"], "average": "7.875", "statistics": [], "videogamepublisher": ["Matrix Games"], "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic923899_t.jpg", "description": "From the Publisher / Developer Website<br/><br/>Matrix Games has joined forces with legendary game designer Gary Grigsby, Joel Billings and Keith Brors of 2by3Games to bring to you the ultimate operational campaign of the south pacific. Uncommon Valor is the first of a three game series. We are sure that Gary Grigsby fans will not be disappointed. You will find that you are not just playing a game but running a war! Uncommon Valor is a completely new operational game covering the campaigns for New Guinea, New Britain, New Ireland and the Solomon chain from May 1942 to the end of December 1943.The scale is 30 miles per hex and the attrition factor is individual vehicles, guns and squads.Phases are one day, composed of two 12-hour impulses.A turn is composed of 1 to 7 phases, at the player&rsquo;s discretion. He may also choose continuous play and may interrupt that by pressing a key.<br/><br/>Naval Detail Never Before Achieved <br/>Uncommon Valor has naval detail never before achieved in a game of this scale. Besides critical hit locations for all weapons platforms and any radar installations, individual armor locations and a wealth of performance and characteristics data, each ship&rsquo;s crew has an experience rating for day and night combat. Every ship from mighty carriers and battleships down to Japanese barges and American PT boats has a Captain, with his own strengths and weaknesses. The game includes hundreds of ships chosen from over 200 ship classes. These include fully functional seaplane tenders, gunboats, destroyers, mine layers and mine sweepers, light cruisers, heavy cruisers, capital ships, submarines, tankers, cargo ships, transports and many others. Ships take incidental damage from rough weather and mishap, as well as battle damage. Ships can also make repairs while under and there is an option for superior Allied damage control. All have proper steaming ranges, based on accurate fuel consumption ratings and fuel stowage capacities. Ships can be formed into task groups of up to 25 ships, although smaller ships and smaller task groups are harder to spot and easier to coordinate. Radar can be used increase the chances of surprise. Task groups can be given a variety of missions, including cargo, aircraft transport, surface action, bombardment, air combat, mine sweeping, mine laying, anti-submarine patrol and troop transport. Task groups can be given orders to return if attacked or to ignore attacks and continue on the mission, to stay on station or to return to base after mission completion. They can be given orders to go to a base or a location at sea or to follow a friendly fleet. Submarines may be orders on combat patrol or assigned special operations missions, including troop or supply transport and mine laying. A fleet commander is assigned to each fleet and may be exchanged for a different officer by the player,any time the fleet is docked. The choice of fleet commander can affect the fuel consumption rate, combat and non-combat capabilities of the fleet.<br/><br/>Air Power You Can Feel <br/>The game deals with aircraft in a similar fashion. A wide variety of aircraft are included in the game, ranging from the awkward P-39 and the nimble Zero, to the heavy hitting B-17E and the extremely fast and powerful Corsair. Pilots and crews are tracked separately from aircraft and have individual skill and fatigue ratings. Every squadron and group has a commander, whose inspiration characteristic can help reduce fatigue and get more aircraft into the air. Air formations can be assigned up to two mission options, a primary mission and a secondary mission, each morning. Each formation may be assigned a different target or mission. Missions include combat air patrol, search, anti-submarine, sweep, escort, attack airfield, attack port, attack troops, training, camera recon, naval interdiction and supply transport. Seaplanes and cargo aircraft can also transport troops. They can also be assigned to fly at a specific altitude. Air groups from aircraft carriers, battleships and cruisers can also be transferred to bases and air groups at bases, if properly trained can operate from aircraft carriers. Aircraft are very useful in locating and attacking enemy fleets or bombing enemy bases and airfields. Combat air patrol can brunt the effects of an air attack or even turn a group around, if they deal out enough damage. Air strikes may not find the target at all, especially in bad weather or against naval targets at extreme range. Each base operating aircraft will need crews to repair and reload the aircraft. These are called base forces and in addition to maintaining the aircraft, they maintain the airfield and runway. A shortage of support units in the base force can ground many of the aircraft stationed there. Airfields are rated according to the runway. A small dirt field will produce many more crashed landings than a large concrete runway, even among experienced pilots. And, of course the player will have to keep the forward bases well supplied, if the air groups are to be of any value.<br/><br/>It Will Take More Then Just Fighting Forces <br/>Troops are needed to maintain and garrison bases and to deprive the enemy of his bases. So, troops are handled with care. There are a goodly number of different types of land-based units. For instance, American divisions have a headquarters, three regimental combat teams and an engineer battalion. These are all represented by different unit counters and have different capabilities. Units include engineers, combat squads, Marine squads, support squads, air support sections, Sherman tanks, Stuart tanks, motorized forces, a number of mortars and field artillery and many others. There are a myriad of different organizational tables of equipment for the various units. For instance, the Sasebo 5th AA Battalion has: 75mm AAA x 4, dual 40mm AAA x 2, 13mm AAA x 10 and 14 support squads. Troops may be ordered to move, defend, bombard or make a variety of attacks. Engineers may also expand airfields or ports or repair damage done to these and build fortifications. Vehicular travel, while rapid, is limited to primary roads. Foot troops can travel on secondary roads or up to 50 miles into the jungle. Anti-aircraft units can shoot at aircraft or troops. Medium and heavy artillery can target units for bombardment and can also shoot at ships, as can coastal batteries. All land-based units have leaders and are also affected by leaders to whom there unit is subordinate. Troops use a lot of supply and keeping them supplied can be quite a challenge, if within enemy bomber range. The game uses a novel automatic supply system. The player can create supply fleets and place then under computer control. The fleets will then try to go back and forth, supplying bases, as needed. Since the system is not abstracted, the player may take control of these fleets at any time.<br/><br/>Campaigns <br/>There are 18 campaigns included with the game, which can be played against the computer opponent, hot-seat, by secure email. The player may also create campaigns of his own, using the Campaign Editor. The player can choose many game options concerning limited intelligence, music and sound effects, the length of pause between messages, the types and number of messages shown, the length of the turn and other factors allow the player to tailor the game to suit his playing style. Campaigns include a 1943 campaign, two 1942 campaigns, a battle of Coral Sea scenario and many others.<br/><br/>"}, "77542": {"poll": [], "name": "The Next Tetris", "videogamemode": ["Local Multiplayer", "Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["Playstation North America edition"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic916576.jpg", "videogametheme": ["Abstract"], "videogamefranchise": ["Tetris"], "videogamedeveloper": ["Blue Planet Software"], "videogamegenre": ["Puzzle"], "videogameplatform": ["PlayStation"], "usersrated": "2", "average": "7.5", "statistics": [], "videogamepublisher": ["Atari, Inc.", "Hasbro Interactive"], "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic916576_t.jpg", "description": "From the back of the Playstation edition case:<br/><br/>If you think you've mastered Tetris, then think again!

Titan-ATs are generally humanoid in appearance, range from seven to fifteen meters in height and weigh as much as 200 tons. A Titan-AT can have an array of weapons including lasers, auto cannons, missile launchers and other specialty weapons and defensive systems. Titans of Steel: Warring Suns allows you to design or reconfigure your own Titan-AT. There are 450 different Titan-AT types to start with, including 150 pre-designed Titan-ATs. Each Titan-AT has over 74 internal systems, electronics systems, 4 armor types, 20 chassis styles, 5 size classes (recon, light, medium, heavy, assault) and 29 weapon types ranging from conventional to exotic. Once you've settled on your perfect Titan-AT, you can share your design with other commanders. Titans of Steel: Warring Suns is more than a combat game. It is also a fully open ended role playing system designed to allow you to choose between eight different race and gender combination. All your pilots have a full statistics sheet and earn experience points. These experience points can be used to increase 7 attributes and 19 skills. Your pilots can go up in rank and will benefit from additional training. They are assembled in squads, which can have 8 pilots and up to 16 Titan-ATs. The battle area has four map sizes ranging from small to huge. Interactive terrain features, including flammable forests and smashed buildings, make the battlefields more dynamic. You and your squads will battle over different map types such as Terran, Savannah, Polar, Core and BioChem. You can play skirmish battles on random maps as well as pre-designed campaign missions. Random map parameters can be defined for even more challenging battles. An auto-move feature allows you to concentrate on your weapon systems.

New reforms in the Austrian army, including reorganization, as well as Napoleon&iexcl;&brvbar;s interest in fighting the British on the Iberian Peninsula fueled Austria's desire for revenge for having suffered numerous sharp defeats at French hands. The Austrians quickly pushed aside French resistance in the region, until Napoleon himself arrived on the field. Taking immediate action, he threw his troops across the Danube and struck at a surprised Austrian foe, cutting it in two. Marching into Vienna, Napoleon sought a decisive battle with Charles's army. Poor weather combined with a torrential river caused a large portion of France's army to be caught on the wrong side of the river as revitalized Austrian troops hit them hard. Eventually Napoleon managed to extract his men from the danger, but not after having suffered nearly 21,000 casualties to the Austrian's 23,000. While the myth of French invincibility had been credibly destroyed, not two days later Napoleon crushed the Austrians at Wagram, inflicting 40,000 casualties and forcing Austria to sue for peace and join his vaunted Continental System. With this new offering from Matrix Games and Adanac, players may command these historic, powerful armies as they face off against each other in a clash that would be destined to defeat Austria but prove for a brief time that Napoleon could indeed be stopped. Players will be able to take command of the French forces under Napoleon or Austrians under Charles and strike at each other over a large hex-based map. Cavalry, infantry, artillery, engineers, leaders, supply wagons, depots, and other counters may be maneuvered for maximum military effect, while the flexible combat system may be used either through the game system itself or through miniatures play. This battle was by no means a foregone conclusion; the French could have easily handled the Austrians had the fateful river crossing not conspired against them, and the Austrians could just as well have held against The Little Corporal and dealt the French a stunning defeat. Now, with &quot; The Campaigns of the Danube 1805 &amp; 1809 &quot;, players may indulge in one of seven scenarios that focus on the region's conflicts, including battles fought there in 1805. One of the features of this game system involves the player's role; as overall commander of a side, the player issues orders to their corps commanders, who in turn issue orders to the maneuver elements. All of this takes time, and sometimes (due to enemy action, accident, or getting lost), these orders never arrive! Long-range planning and strategic thinking are required to keep a large army on the move, well-supplied, and eager for victory. For any connoisseur of Napoleonic gaming, The Campaigns of the Danube 1805 &amp; 1809 is a fascinating and fast-paced game that is bound to provide countless hours of surprises and conquest.<br/><br/>"}, "77564": {"videogame": ["H\u03bbLF-LIFE\u00b2: Holiday 2006 Collection"], "poll": [], "name": "Counter-Strike: Source", "videogamemode": ["Network Multiplayer", "Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["North American Macintosh edition", "North American Windows edition", "Windows Downloadable release"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic782401.jpg", "videogameseries": ["Counter-Strike", "H\u03bbLF-LIFE (Core Series)"], "videogametheme": ["War - Modern"], "videogamegenre": ["First Person Shooter"], "videogamedeveloper": ["Valve Corporation"], "videogamefranchise": ["Better Description Needed", "H\u03bbLF-LIFE"], "videogameplatform": ["Linux", "Macintosh", "Windows"], "usersrated": "117", "average": "7.40701", "statistics": [], "videogamepublisher": ["Valve Corporation"], "videogamecompilation": ["H\u03bbLF-LIFE\u00b2: Holiday 2006 Collection"], "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic782401_t.jpg", "description": "Counter-Strike: Source is a remake of Counter-Strike, and consequently retains its team-based objective-oriented first-person shooter style gameplay. The aim of playing a map is to accomplish a map's objective. There are many types of objectives that a map can have, but the ultimate goal of the game is to win more rounds than the opposing team, which is accomplished by fulfilling the map's winning conditions. Some winning conditions include defusing a bomb, planting a bomb and preventing it from being defused by the other team, rescuing all the hostages on a map, preventing the hostages from being rescued, and defeat all the members of the opposing team. When playing on a server without modifications, if players are defeated during a round, they do not respawn until the next round, unlike in many other first-person shooter games, where players respawn on a set timer.<br/><br/>Moving and shooting also differs noticeably from many other first-person shooters. Shooting while moving dramatically decreases accuracy, and holding the mouse button down to continuously shoot will generally produce severe recoil. Recoil can be difficult for beginning players to compensate for because the player's reticle does not correspond with where the bullets actually hit during continuous fire, so beginning players may aim too high during automatic fire. The amount of damage done by a bullet varies dramatically depending upon the body part the bullet hits, with great emphasis on shooting the enemy in the head, which is almost invariably lethal.<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;<a target='_blank' href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Counter-Strike' rel='nofollow'>http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Counter-Strike</a>:_Source,&quot; available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "77565": {"videogame": ["The Complete Ultima VII", "Ultima Collection"], "poll": [], "name": "Ultima VII: Forge of Virtue", "videogamemode": ["Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["MS-DOS edition"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic778297.jpg", "videogameseries": ["Ultima"], "videogametheme": ["Fantasy"], "videogamefranchise": ["Ultima"], "videogameexpansion": ["Ultima VII: The Black Gate"], "videogamedeveloper": ["Origin Systems Inc."], "videogamegenre": ["RPG"], "videogameplatform": ["DOS"], "usersrated": "19", "average": "7.67211", "statistics": [], "videogamepublisher": ["Origin Systems Inc."], "videogamecompilation": ["The Complete Ultima VII", "Ultima Collection"], "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic778297_t.jpg", "description": "User Summary<br/><br/>Ultima VII: Forge of Virtue is the expansion for Ultima VII: The Black Gate.

The player takes control of Crash Bandicoot, who must retrieve the Black Power Gem of Ebenezer Von Clutch, along with the missing Power Gems in each of the five themed areas of the park. The player will compete in races and minigames to earn Wumpa Coins, the park's currency, and Power Crystals, find the Power Gem needed to open up the five areas of the park, and ultimately unveil the mystery of the Power Gem thief's identity.<br/><br/>As the player explores the park, race gates can be entered to unlock new racetracks, battle arenas, stunt tracks, and driving minigames. Extra Wumpa Coins and Power Crystals can be earned by playing driving minigames, some of which involve driving for the best lap time, crashing into as many obstacles as possible, shooting at trackside objects, and shooting at moving cars. Characters with an icon over their heads can be talked to unlock cars, weapon upgrades, clothing, or to play minigames. The player can smash crates and collect Wumpa Coins in order to buy rewards such as new clothing; drinking Wumpa Whip gives the player a temporary coin multiplier that earns extra money from Wumpa Coins and crates. Collecting Power Crystals is required to unlock the Power Gem at the end of a themed area, which unlocks an additional area of the theme park. Mini-cartoons, called &quot;Die-O-Ramas&quot;, can also be unlocked; these cutscenes display Crash being killed off in various, and largely humorous ways. Unlocking all 34 Die-O-Ramas unlocks another costume for Crash. The Die-O-Ramas can be viewed at any time under the Extras section in the main menu.<br/><br/>The main hook of Crash Tag Team Racing is the &quot;clashing&quot; feature found during the racing sections of the game. The player can &quot;clash&quot; with another vehicle by pressing a certain button depending on the gaming platform. The player's vehicle will merge with a nearby opponent's vehicle, and the player will then take control of a powerful turret weapon to shoot at other vehicles. The turret can not only be used to shoot at enemy cars, but also to take out incoming attacks.<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;Crash Tag Team Racing,&quot; available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "77575": {"poll": [], "name": "Crash Twinsanity", "videogamemode": ["Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["EU PlayStation 2 Release", "EU Xbox Release", "NA PS2 Release", "NA Xbox Release"], "average": "5.75", "videogametheme": ["Cartoon", "Furries / Talking Animals"], "videogamegenre": ["Adventure", "Platform"], "videogamedeveloper": ["Traveller's Tales"], "videogamefranchise": ["Crash Bandicoot"], "videogameplatform": ["PlayStation 2", "Xbox"], "usersrated": "4", "statistics": [], "videogamepublisher": ["Sierra Entertainment Inc.", "Vivendi Games"], "description": "Crash Twinsanity is the eleventh game in the Crash Bandicoot series, although it is the fifth chronologically.

Despite this, the game's critical reception was not as positive as its predecessor's for example, PC Gamer gave Deus Ex a score of 94%, while Invisible War received an 83%.

The game bears a resemblance to Digimon World 3, features 300 Digimon, and uses Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection to match Digimon.<br/><br/>In the game, the player assumes the role of a Digimon tamer and embarks on a journey to discover, tame, raise, train and command more than 230 unique Digimon.

All four types are unmounted.<br/><br/>It uses the simple &quot;Rock-Paper-Scissors&quot; type of unit balance typical of the genre. Knights beat Barbarians in melee; Barbarians have the advantage over Archers; and Archers have the advantage over Knights, in addition to being effective at defending against attempts to storm a fort. Spies did not fight, but had twice the range of any other unit type in terms of lifting the fog of war.<br/><br/>At the start of the game, the player is able to select from a list of campaigns to play. The campaigns include both skirmishes and &quot;capture the flag(s)&quot; type missions, while the terrain layout and initial starting units provided a variety of strategic options for game play. Advanced rule sets such as Training New Units and Supply Line Lengths allow for more customization. The player can also select from among several Artificial Intelligence opponents represented by various historical figures such as Geronimo and Napoleon. Sun Tzu represents the most difficult level.

There are 4 distinct seasons, 3 of which you can grow different types of crops. Examples include: Strawberries and turnips in the spring, tomatoes and pineapples in the summer, and yams in the fall. There are many other crops, and you can grow flowers, which can all be sold for gold (the game's currency.) Farming is only half of the game. The other half is dungeon crawling. There are four very different dungeons, three of which represent the four different seasons (the third dungeon represents both autumn and winter). In these dungeons, crops of that dungeon's seasonal affiliation can be grown. The fourth dungeon, Whale Island, is omni-seasonal, and all crops can be grown there at any time.<br/><br/>Another feature is the concept of Runey distribution. Runeys come in four different variations: water, rock, tree and grass. Runeys represent the ecosystem of Trampoli; when Runeys are in perfect harmony, the area that they occupy reaches a state of Prosperity, and crops in that area will grow much faster than normal. However, should even one area of Trampoli become devoid of Runeys, the ecosystem suffers, and crops grow much slower than normal. Runeys can be re-distributed from area to area using a tool called the Harvester, and the game itself distributes Runeys randomly across Trampoli daily. Every nine ripe crops in the field in front of the character's house also spawns one Runey daily.<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, Rune Factory Frontier , available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "77669": {"poll": [], "name": "NHL 09", "videogamemode": ["Network Multiplayer", "Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["German PlayStation 3 version", "NA PlayStation 3 edition", "US Xbox 360 Edition"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1151010.jpg", "videogameseries": ["NHL"], "videogametheme": ["Sports - Hockey"], "videogamegenre": ["Sports"], "usersrated": "32", "videogamedeveloper": ["EA Canada"], "videogamefranchise": ["EA Sports"], "videogameplatform": ["PlayStation 3", "Windows", "Xbox 360"], "videogamehonor": ["2008 Spike Best Sports Game of the Year Winner", "2009 D.I.C.E.

This version of NHL Hockey was also the first game to include the EA Sports  logo. It was considered the most realistic hockey game of its time. The game used a vertical view, which was unique at the time since most previous hockey games used a horizontal or top-down view. It also features a National Hockey League  license, so all of the team names and logos are used. However, lack of a license from the National Hockey League Players' Association NHLPA resulted in all players being referred to by their numbers rather than names. The Mega Drive version was released soon after, titled EA Hockey  and featured international teams. However, this change is merely cosmetic, as most team colors could be tracked to NHL teams. Although the game has all of the NHL teams that existed at the time, the only competition present is the Playoffs, either decided in one or seven matches.<br/><br/>A component of the game which added to the game-play was the fact that fights would breakout in the event of a bad bodycheck. Players would fight with a computer player (or a friend in 2 player mode) which would go on until one fell down, ultimately losing the fight. During the fights the crowd would cheer and all other team mates and officials would stand by watching. After the fight was completed normal game play would resume.

In 2008 Flagship Studios filed bankruptcy and all intellectual property was seized because it was used as collateral for funding received from Comerica Bank. Subsequently, development of the game halted. Namco Bandai Games provided free ongoing US/EU server support in the fall of Flagship Studios until 31 January 2009, when the US/EU multiplayer game servers and websites were taken offline.HanbitSoft has since acquired properties to the game and it is being developed and played in Korea to date. As of 2010, Hanbitsoft has acquired the US/EU territory rights and will be re-releasing back to the US/EU territories with its sequel Hellgate London: Resurrection.<br/><br/>Set in a post-apocalyptic London in the year 2038, Hellgate: London is a fast paced action role playing 'hack and slasher'. The game featured both singleplayer and online multiplayer support when it was released although US/EU online support has since shutdown. Flagship Studios released 1 major MP content update The Stonehenge Chronicles and the 2nd The Abyss Chronicles on the test server before the studios closure. Similar to the Diablo series, randomization is embedded into many of the game mechanics including weapon and armor attributes, item drops, mob spawns and level composition. The singleplayer version features a 5 act story quest line and when completed, the player is eligible to restart the story line again in Nightmare difficulty and create new characters in Elite mode.<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, Hellgate: London , available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "77707": {"videogame": ["Atari Anthology", "Atari: 80 Classic Games in One"], "poll": [], "name": "Canyon Bomber", "videogamemode": ["Local Multiplayer", "Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["Android (Atari Greatest Hits Atari 2600 Emulation) edition", "North American Atari 2600 (Picture Label) edition", "North American Atari 2600 (Text Label) edition"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic903821.jpg", "videogametheme": ["War - World War II"], "usersrated": "5", "videogamedeveloper": ["Atari, Inc.", "Code Mystics"], "videogamegenre": ["Action"], "videogameplatform": ["Android", "Atari 2600"], "average": "4.6", "statistics": [], "videogamepublisher": ["Atari, Inc."], "videogamecompilation": ["Atari Anthology", "Atari Flashback Classics: Volume 2", "Atari Vault", "Atari: 80 Classic Games in One"], "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic903821_t.jpg", "description": "User Summary<br/><br/>Standalone arcade game and Atari 2600 game where players control airplaines or helicopters which fly across the screen.

The game was ported to Mac OS 9.2 in 2001.<br/><br/>Unlike many contemporary real-time strategy games, Sacrifice does not heavily focus on resource gathering and management. There is no system of workers; the players' wizards collect souls to summon creatures, and their mana&mdash;energy for casting spells&mdash;constantly regenerates. Players customize their attacks by choosing from spells and creatures aligned to five gods. To defeat an opponent, the player's wizard sacrifices a friendly unit at the opposing wizard's altar, thereby desecrating it and banishing the enemy wizard. Aside from a single-player campaign, Sacrifice offers a multiplayer mode, in which up to four players can play against each other over computer networks.<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, Sacrifice (video game) , available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "77748": {"rpgdesigner": ["Judy Bauer", "Christopher Carey", "Colin McComb", "Stephen Radney-MacFarland", "Sean K.

Springs, dampers, wings, gear ratios, brake balance and ride height are just a few of the items that are realistically adjustable and that will truly affect car performance and handling characteristics.

Each fireteam has a Team Leader equipped with an M4 carbine. The Team Leaders also carry the Global Positioning System, which can be used to locate mission objectives and enemy locations, and a radio for communication with headquarters. The second team member is the Automatic Rifleman, equipped with an M249 Squad Automatic Weapon, used to lay suppressive fire on the enemy and assigned to take command if the team leader is shot. The third team member is the Grenadier, equipped with an M4 with an M203 grenade launcher attachment. The last team member is the Rifleman, equipped with a M4 carbine. If a member of the team is wounded, another member of the team will carry them. Lieutenant Phillips is the team commander and the player will usually find him with the CASEVACs, which are healing and ammunition points. Each fireteam has a limited amount of fragmentation and smoke grenades, in addition to the M203 grenades. Occasionally throughout the game, there will be a third asset designated as Charlie Team, ranging from anti-armor engineers to US Army Rangers.<br/><br/>Throughout the game, the player does not directly control any of the fireteam members; instead, orders are given using a cursor that projects onto the environment, letting the player tell his/her soldiers to hold a position and set a specific zone to cover with fire. It is also possible to order them to lay down suppressive fire on a given zone to cover the second squad's movement, or to reduce incoming fire.<br/><br/>Gameplay revolves around the concept of fire and movement, with one team providing suppressive fire while the other moves. The basic gameplay mechanics remain the same for the retail version of Full Spectrum Warrior, which was released on the Xbox, PlayStation 2 and Windows platforms. The retail version places much more emphasis on aesthetics; it possesses substantially improved graphics and sound. Cut scenes and voice acting are also characteristics that distinguish the retail version from the military version.

The game features several rappers, including Snoop Dogg, Method Man, Redman, Fat Joe, Ice-T, Xzibit, and Busta Rhymes, as well as the voices and likeness of other actors and celebrities, among them actors Omar Epps, Christopher Judge, Danny Trejo, Carmen Electra, and Kimora Lee Simmons. The game was spun off into a 2006 PlayStation Portable game called Def Jam Fight for NY: The Takeover.The game emphasizes strikes more, as well as proper use of the arena's environment and the surrounding crowd. Tossing the opponent against barriers gives fighters the opportunity to inflict massive damage to their opponent by tossing or slamming them into the wall headfirst, or using other features of the environment, such as slamming a door or gate in their face.<br/><br/>The crowd will shove a fighter back into combat if he is thrown into them or gets too close, and will sometimes hold a fighter, leaving them open to attack. Some spectators carry weapons, and will offer them to the fighters, or even attack a fighter if the guy next to them holds him.<br/><br/>Momentum is gained by successfully performing moves, countering, and taunting the opponent. The rate at which momentum is gained is effected by the fighter's Charisma, which is set for most fighters. Created fighters can set their own charisma with a combination of clothes, tattoos, and jewelry; the more expensive, the better. A fighter with a good set of clothes, extensive tattoos, or laden with jewellery can often fill their momentum meter in just a few moves.<br/>When the momentum meter is full, a fighter can activate it, which results in a Blazin' Taunt. In this state, the fighter is said to be &quot;Blazin&quot;, and can pull off a Blazin' Move, a powerful and brutal attack personalized for each character. A created character can learn every single Blazin' Move in the game, but can only have up to four usable at any one time.<br/><br/>With the focus taken from mixed martial arts, the only way to win a fight is through Knock Out or Submission. A character can be made to submit by putting them into submission holds until the health bar of a single body part is depleted.<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, Def Jam: Fight for NY , available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "77818": {"poll": [], "name": "Zombie Tycoon", "videogamemode": ["Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["PSP  edition"], "average": "6", "videogameseries": ["Zombie Tycoon"], "videogametheme": ["Cartoon", "Horror", "Zombies"], "usersrated": "2", "videogamedeveloper": ["Frima Studio"], "videogamegenre": ["Real Time Strategy"], "videogameplatform": ["PSP"], "statistics": [], "videogamepublisher": ["Sony Computer Entertainment"], "description": "Zombie Tycoon is a PlayStation Portable game that puts the player in charge of their very own undead horde.
