Artwork by Jeremy McHugh adds a great touch of historical atmosphere to this great adventure package.<br/><br/>"}, "80574": {"rpgdesigner": ["Erica Balsley", "Bob Bledsaw", "Scott Greene", "Patrick Lawinger", "Nathan Douglas Paul", "Clark Peterson", "Bill Webb"], "rpgitemversion": ["Hardcover Version", "PDF version"], "poll": [], "name": "City State of the Invincible Overlord (Revised d20)", "rpghonor": ["2005 ENnie for Best Cartography - Silver Winner"], "rpgproducer": ["Mike Chaney", "Scott Greene", "Clark Peterson", "Bill Webb"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1572983.png", "usersrated": "7", "rpgsetting": ["Wilderlands of High Fantasy"], "average": "8.28571", "rpgissuearticle": ["A Brief Word From Johnn", "Products for October"], "rpgartist": ["Ed Bourelle", "Mike Chaney", "David Day", "Llyn Hunter", "Becky Jollensten", "Leif Jones", "Brian LeBlanc", "Erik Roman", "Richard Sardinha", "Mark Smylie", "Richard Thomas (I)", "Beth Trott", "Timothy Truman"], "rpg": ["d20 System / OGL Product (D&D 3.5 Compatible)"], "rpgpublisher": ["Judges Guild", "Necromancer Games", "White Wolf Publishing (White Wolf)"], "statistics": [], "rpgcategory": ["Campaign Setting (game world)", "Scenario / Adventure / Module"], "rpggenre": ["Fantasy (Sword & Sorcery)"], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1572983_t.png", "description": "From the back of the book:<br/>Can your PC survive the mean streets of an evil city built upon the backs of the conquered?

Figures are pewter. Collect figures (power levels from 1 to 5) to construct your 5-combatant team (using two of six colors). More powerful characters can only be summoned if a certain number of colors are on the table.<br/><br/>Theme: Uses characters from Dragon Ball Kai, pitting one team of combatants against another. The same character can be found across multiple colors, roughly corresponding to allegiances found in the manga (comics). For example, Goku is found in both a low power level and a high power level (super), but even characters without supers are represented.<br/><br/>Goal: There are two variants, basic and advanced. In the basic, simply having characters breakthrough (reach the opponent's starting line) completes the game. In the advanced, there are three win conditions, including having the majority of your characters occupying the Dragon Ball area in the middle of the playing field.<br/><br/>Components: There are preconstructed starters (currently 3 available), and booster singles (currently 2 available). Starters include 5 figures (using two colors), a die, a double-sided effect card, a rule sheet, and a play mat (paper). The third starter play mat sports different coloring and English.

The Twin Snakes is a remake of Metal Gear Solid, developed and first published by Konami in 1998 for the PlayStation.<br/><br/>The Twin Snakes features graphical improvements over the original, new cut scenes written and directed by Ryuhei Kitamura, and gameplay functions originally introduced in the sequel Metal Gear Solid 2: Sons of Liberty. The game also includes a revised translation with re-recorded voice acting using most of the original English voice cast. It uses the same engine and items as Metal Gear Solid 2.<br/><br/>Gameplay:<br/><br/>For The Twin Snakes, Metal Gear Solid's gameplay was altered to resemble that of Metal Gear Solid 2: Sons of Liberty. While all of the original areas and enemies were kept, new ways for the player to combat them were introduced, such as the ability to shoot using first person view. Enemy AI was also improved, giving enemy soldiers the ability to communicate with each other and detect the player more intelligently.<br/><br/>Additional Info:<br/><br/>Although The Twin Snakes was largely developed at Silicon Knights (mostly programming), its cut scenes and models were developed in-house at Konami and directed by Japanese film director Ryuhei Kitamura, reflecting his dynamic signature style, utilizing bullet-time photography and choreographed gunplay extensively.<br/><br/>Despite receiving generally favorable reviews, The Twin Snakes has also drawn criticism. According to GamePro, the game has a &quot;flagging framerate and bouts of slowdown that occur when too much activity crowds the screen.&quot; The new gameplay elements from MGS2 have also been criticized as unnecessary, as the level design is virtually unchanged from MGS1, and even &quot;spoil the challenge ... and completely ruin at least one boss battle.&quot;<br/><br/>The January 2009 issue of Game Informer placed The Twin Snakes at #11 on their list of &quot;Top 25 GameCube Games&quot;.&quot;<br/>  <br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;Metal Gear Solid: The Twin Snakes&quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "80601": {"rpgartist": ["Albrecht Altdorfer", "Hans Holbein, the Younger"], "statistics": [], "name": "Aventurischer Bote (Issue 40 - 1992)", "rpgdesigner": ["Niels Gaul", "G.

These stats are increased by raising his experience level through battling.<br/><br/>Also returning from the first game is the combat system. The player attacks enemies by running into them, and the enemy takes damage according to Adol's Attack Power. A new addition to Ys II is the Magic system: Adol can acquire several different spells he can use throughout the course of play, such as a Fire spell for attack, and a Time spell which can stop enemies as long as it is active.

It is played with a traditional 52-card deck.<br/><br/>At the beginning of the game, all players are have hands of size 5.  Each round, the players are dealt a new hand.  One player calls out a 5-card poker hand that they believe can be made by the collective cards of all the players.  The player to their left must call the previous player's bluff by saying &quot;BS&quot; or similar, or otherwise state a higher hand of their own.  Play continues clockwise until a player's bluff has been called.  Players pool their cards and see if the last name hand can be assembled from their cards.  If the hand is possible, the hand size of the player who called the bluff drops by 1.  Otherwise, the hand of the player whose bluff was called decreases by 1.<br/><br/>The next round begins with fresh hands using the new lower hand limits.  The player who called &quot;BS&quot; last round starts the new round.  If a player's hand size drops to zero, they are out of the game.  Play continues until the players only have 4 cards between them, and the player with most cards remaining is the winner.<br/><br/>Rules for hands:<br/>Pair, Two Pair, 3 of a Kind, Full House, and 4 of a Kind: must name their card values<br/>Straights, Flush, and Straight Flush: must name their high card<br/>Flush and Straight Flush: also must name their suit<br/><br/>Variant: The 2's are wild able to take any value and suit.

The battle may be played with the historical orders or custom orders. It is a turn-based strategy game.<br/><br/>The 100-page manual provides historical and military background to the battle as well as gameplay information. A fold-out map of the battlefield and initial dispositions of units is also provided.<br/><br/>The game was innovative in being played from the point of view of the commander, with the battlefield rendered in simple three-dimensional perspective rather than the overhead view traditionally typical of battlefield strategy games. This means that the player's knowledge of the progress of the battle is limited to what he can see with his own eyes and the reports of subordinates. The player may move around the battlefield to better observe events, but risks death or capture if he approaches too close to the front.<br/><br/>The player is not permitted to micromanage the movements of individual units, as these are not under his direct command; instead he must give orders to subordinate commanders who interpret them according to their own judgement. A subordinate commander will ignore an order he considers unfeasible.<br/><br/>Orders are issued using natural language commands reminiscent of adventure games.

The light gun also features a blowback function which simulates real-life gun recoil.<br/>    * A countdown timer, recharged by clearing an area of enemies, as running down the clock causes an instant game over, the player must take risks, shooting enemies rapidly and hiding only when necessary.

The player controls a Sea Harrier fighter, looking sideways onto a right-to-left scrolling seascape and landscape. The aim of the game is to take off from a carrier, attack ships and land targets, avoid the odd missile and enemy fighter, then land back on the carrier again. Although the game was a work of fiction, it was inspired by the 1982 Falklands War, in which the Sea Harrier had played a major role.<br/><br/>One interesting little quirk to the game was that, it was possible to bomb your own ship as you took off from it. If you did this, when you returned it would no longer be there (having sunk, presumably) and being unable to land on it your plane would just continue flying until it ran out of fuel and crashed.<br/><br/>Durell managed to get the executable size down to just under 9 kilobytes, which allowed for a fast loading time from cassette.

It is an action-adventure game in which the player controls an alchemist who may transform into a golden eagle.<br/><br/>Alchemist was authored by Ian Weatherburn and Paul Lindale, and was Imagine's first arcade adventure. This release was also the first piece of software to be released on a gold-coloured cassette and box.<br/><br/>The player controls a skilled alchemist, who has been summoned to defeat an evil warlock. The game takes place in the warlock's castle, with the objective of finding four pieces of a magic scroll. This will allow the alchemist to use the &quot;Spell of Destruction&quot; to defeat the warlock.<br/><br/>The alchemist can transform into a golden eagle, requiring the use of spell energy. Transforming between the two is essential to completing the game: The alchemist can hurl lightning bolts and other spells, but the eagle form is required to negotiate steel hills or drops. The alchemist can only carry one item at a time and food needs to be found during the game to keep stamina levels up. Movement, bumping into objects, or transforming depletes stamina. Fighting monsters also reduces stamina although this can be mitigated by carrying an axe or sword.<br/><br/>Alchemist was critically well received on release. Its atmosphere and play style drew comparisons with Atic Atac. Sinclair User highlighted Alchemist's cartoon graphics and storyline. CRASH magazine praised the game's presentation, graphics and &quot;spooky organ tune&quot;. Whilst the exploration of the castle was a draw for one reviewer, overall opinions about the game's addictiveness was mixed. In CRASH magazine's 1984 retrospective, it was felt that the graphics in Alchemist, whilst detailed, had not aged well. The jerky scrolling and poor keyboard layout, and lack of replayability were also criticised.

Legend's chairman and founder was John Peel. The developers were Richard Edwards, Graham Asher, Charles Goodwin, James Learmont and Andrew Owen. The original game was released in English for the Sinclair Spectrum 48K. The Movisoft graphics engine occupied 4K of the game footprint and used machine code, the rest of the game engine and parser was written in Sinclair BASIC. After its successful launch in the UK, it was then ported to the Commodore 64, with pirate editions appearing in Spanish.<br/><br/>Valhalla is mostly text-based with some graphics showing the location and the characters there. It was set mainly in Asgard and Midgard, though when your character died you would reappear in Hell (Niflheim under another name) and be able to walk out.<br/><br/>Within its limits, the text parser would understand multi-part sentences, so long as they were written using the words it understood, which (unlike in many other games) were helpfully listed in the manual.<br/><br/>The aim was to collect six mythical objects, for which you needed the help of other characters, who were taken from Norse mythology and would wander around randomly. To help with this, your character had an alignment (between good and evil) that would change depending on which other characters you helped. Thus, the more you helped good characters, the more other good characters would help you.<br/><br/>Within the game world, characters would move about and interact independently without any action required from you. If you do nothing, the game will 'play' itself, with the characters moving about whilst you decide what to do.<br/><br/>Typing in a swear word would generate the message &quot;Mary is not amused...&quot; and a dwarf would dash onto the screen to punch the player. Mary could be found in El Vinos but killing her achieved little as she would return within a minute.<br/><br/>The game engine had a limit of eight objects that could be left in any one location, whether on the ground, in a chest, or in a cupboard. If the player dropped an object when the limit had been reached, a character called Klepto appeared to &quot;Steal&quot; the item, removing it from the game.<br/><br/>The cover of the game as well as the loading screen featured a drawing of a ceremonial helmet from the 7th century found in an Anglo-Saxon burial site at Sutton Hoo, Suffolk, UK.<br/><br/>The second quest object (a ring) was called 'Drapnir', a reference to Odin's ring Draupnir.<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;Valhalla (video game),&quot; available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "80634": {"poll": [], "name": "Rules of Engagement 2", "videogamemode": ["Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["Amiga", "US DOS 3.5\" Disk edition"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1093412.jpg", "videogameseries": ["Rules of Engagement"], "videogametheme": ["Science Fiction"], "videogamegenre": ["Strategy"], "videogamedeveloper": ["Omnitrend"], "videogamefranchise": ["Omnitrend Universe"], "videogameplatform": ["Amiga", "DOS"], "usersrated": "2", "average": "7", "statistics": [], "videogamepublisher": ["Impressions Games"], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1093412_t.jpg", "description": "From the back of the game box:<br/><br/>In Rules of Engagement 2, you are the Fleet Commander of the Federated Worlds Armed Forces (FWAF) main task force.

It was not licensed by Major League Baseball (MLB) itself, however, and thus did not use team nicknames or logos. Instead, the game contained 8 teams listed only by city name: Boston, California, Detroit, Houston, Minnesota, New York, St. Louis, and San Francisco; their real-life, MLB counterparts were the playoff teams in the 1986 (Boston, California, Houston, New York) and 1987 (Detroit, Minnesota, St. Louis, San Francisco) MLB seasons. The game also boasted two All-Star teams, American League and National League; the two featured established veterans such as George Brett, Dale Murphy and Andre Dawson&mdash;none of whom appeared on the other eight teams&mdash;and up-and-coming players like Mark McGwire, Andr&eacute;s Galarraga and Jos&eacute; Canseco.<br/><br/>Each player has different capabilities in the game; hitters vary in ability to make solid contact, to hit the ball with power, and their base running speed. Vince Coleman is the fastest player in the game; it is very difficult to catch him stealing second base. Pitchers vary in pitching speed, and the amount by which the player can steer the ball left and right during its flight. Pitchers also have varying stamina; as a pitcher gets tired, the ball slows down and is harder to steer. Nolan Ryan and Roger Clemens are two pitchers in the game with the fastest pitches. Fernando Valenzuela, without a hard fastball, has tremendous movement in both directions with his pitches. Mike Scott has a sharp and deceptive breaking ball. The best pitcher is debatable, depending on how they are used by the players. There is no evidence that fielding abilities correspond to individual players.<br/><br/>The abilities of each player do not necessary correspond with the statistics shown on the screen when the player comes to bat or takes the mound. These statistics are generally accurate, with many exceptions (see below). They do not change during the course of the game or sequence of games.<br/><br/>A rudimentary box score is displayed during and after the game showing composite statistics for each team. A hit batter is credited with a walk, and anyone reaching on an error gets credited for a hit even as the other team is charged with an error. Conversely, a batter thrown out while trying for extra bases is not credited with a hit.<br/><br/>The rosters for the 8 teams are fairly accurate if simplified representations of the playoff rosters from their respective years. Each team has 8 starting batters, four bench players, two starting pitchers and two relievers. The player can start any pitcher they like, though the relievers have very low stamina. But if they play consecutive games without resetting the system, any starting pitcher used in the previous game will be unavailable. The player has to wait until the game starts before substituting players with pinch hitters, who can play any position.<br/><br/>In Vs. RBI Baseball, the teams are made up of legends from 10 different franchises. These players were statistically represented with their best seasons. A notable exception was that of McGwire, who was included on the Oakland team, and was statistically represented by his potential numbers. In a remarkable display of foresight, he was projected to hit 62 home runs in his best season. In 1998, he set the major league record for home runs in a season with 70.<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;Rbi baseball&quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "80651": {"poll": [], "name": "The Three Stooges", "videogamemode": ["Hotseat", "Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["US Amiga edition", "US C64 edition", "US DOS edition", "US GBA edition", "US NES edition"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic913614.jpg", "videogametheme": ["Comedy"], "usersrated": "11", "videogamedeveloper": ["Incredible Technologies"], "videogamegenre": ["Other", "Trivia"], "videogameplatform": ["Amiga", "Commodore 64", "DOS", "Game Boy Advance", "NES"], "average": "4.81818", "statistics": [], "videogamepublisher": ["Cinemaware"], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic913614_t.jpg", "description": "Game designer John Cutter designed the game as a kind of board game.

To advance in rank at each of these guilds, Kuros must find the statue which corresponds to the guild's level; bronze statues for first level guilds, silver statues for second level guilds and gold statues for third level guilds. Each class has its own unique abilities, which evolve throughout the course of the game; Kuros is free to switch between classes at any time, except during boss battles or during guild tests.<br/><br/>Due to the game's open-ended nature, exploration is necessary to find all necessary items and secrets. Most doors can be entered with a key, which can be purchased at an inn; however, some passages can only be accessed using certain skills. Most of the important items in the game are guarded by boss monsters.<br/><br/>Unlike the past games in the series, there is no continue mechanism; once Kuros loses all of his lives, the game ends. There are no hidden continues, nor is there any way to restore a life once its been lost. Even though there is no continue mechanism, the game is drastically easier than its predecessors. It is possible for Kuros to avoid almost all damage by using the appropriate class in its respective area.<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;Wizards and Warriors III,&quot; available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "80662": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic791673.jpg", "poll": [], "boardgamedesigner": ["(Uncredited)"], "statistics": [], "yearpublished": "2000", "maxplayers": "6", "boardgameartist": ["Willy Vandersteen"], "boardgamepublisher": ["Standaard Uitgeverij"], "maxplaytime": "20", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic791673_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "20", "boardgamecategory": ["Children's Game", "Comic Book / Strip"], "description": "Muffin is being captured by Krimson.Krimson used the time-machine to go back 500 years to a heavily monitored island.

The game was included in various demo discs released for the Dreamcast (through the Official Dreamcast Magazine, and on newly released consoles), and is free to download and play on the PC.<br/><br/>Sega Swirl was created by Scott Hawkins, while he worked at Sega. Scott Hawkins designed the game and programmed the original PC version of the game. Scott Hawkins worked with Tremor Entertainment to develop the Dreamcast version of the game.<br/><br/>The game presented swirls of different colors stacked upon each other. The player would try to match up as many of the same colored swirls onscreen as possible, then, when satisfied with a combo, they would press the color, making them disappear. The more swirls one can gather together, the more points earned, as well as a reward of seeing the swirls disappear in different ways. The most rewarding way to see the swirls disappear is when they all go into the air and burst with firework-like sounds and cheers. If a swirl of a certain color is alone within a stack of other colored swirls, the player actually loses points.<br/><br/>The Dreamcast version featured a snake in the bottom right corner of the screen, who would act pleased when the player did well and shook his head when they did poorly. If the player did nothing for an extended length of time, the snake would stare at them and then gesture to the left, towards the play field.<br/><br/>On the Dreamcast, it could be played on Versus mode (players compete with one Swirl screen) with up to four players, and it also allowed Split Screen (four players with their own swirl play fields). On the PC, split screen is not available, and versus is up to two players. Both versions allowed one to compete with another human player via email (Dreamcast players may also play against PC players through this).<br/><br/>The Palm version of Sega Swirl includes a two player head-to-head mode that can be played in real-time over the handheld's infrared port.<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;Sega Swirl&quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "80740": {"videogame": ["Sega Smash Pack: Volume 1"], "poll": [], "name": "Wrestle War", "videogamemode": ["Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["US Genesis release"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic801791.jpg", "videogametheme": ["Sports - Wrestling"], "usersrated": "0", "videogamedeveloper": ["SEGA Corporation"], "videogamegenre": ["Sports"], "videogameplatform": ["SEGA Genesis"], "average": "0", "statistics": [], "videogamepublisher": ["SEGA Corporation"], "videogamecompilation": ["Sega Smash Pack: Volume 1"], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic801791_t.jpg", "description": "Wrestle War is the name of a video game which was released in the arcades in 1989, and for the Sega Mega Drive/Genesis console in 1991 in Japan, Australia, and Europe only. and was published and developed by Sega.<br/><br/>Wrestle War has also been released as part of the Sega Smash Pack.<br/><br/>The player takes control of Bruce Blade, a rookie wrestler through a series of matches to win the Sega Wrestling Alliance championship belt by facing the following wrestlers, each possessing their unique wrestling moves:<br/><br/>* Mohawk Kid<br/>    * Sledge Hammer (based on Bruiser Brody)<br/>    * Mr. J (based on Japanese professional wrestler Jason who is based on Jason Voorhees)<br/>    * Don Dambuster (based on Road Warrior Hawk)<br/>    * Nim Rod Falcon<br/>    * Titan Morgan (based on Hulk Hogan)<br/>    * Buckskin Rogers<br/>    * Grand Kong (based on Abdullah the Butcher)<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;Wrestle War (video game)&quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "80741": {"poll": [], "name": "Tennis 2K2", "videogamemode": ["Local Multiplayer"], "videogameversion": ["North American Dreamcast edition", "North American PlayStation 2 edition", "UK Dreamcast edition"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic815697.jpg", "videogameseries": ["Virtua Tennis"], "videogametheme": ["Sports - Tennis"], "usersrated": "12", "videogamedeveloper": ["Hitmaker Co., Ltd."], "videogamegenre": ["Sports"], "videogameplatform": ["PlayStation 2", "Sega Dreamcast"], "average": "8.41667", "statistics": [], "videogamepublisher": ["SEGA Corporation"], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic815697_t.jpg", "description": "Virtua Tennis 2 (known as Tennis 2K2 in the United States and Power Smash 2 in Japan) is a sequel to Virtua Tennis that was released for the Dreamcast, Sega NAOMI arcade unit and Sony's PlayStation 2 (known as Sega Sports Tennis and Virtua Tennis 2 in Europe) in 2001 .<br/><br/>New features included the ability to slice and play as female players (such as Monica Seles, Venus Williams, Serena Williams and Lindsay Davenport) and mixed doubles matches.

This is the first game in the McRae series since McRae's death in 2007. <br/>  It features a roster of contemporary off-road events, taking players to diverse and challenging real-world environments. The game takes place across four continents: Asia, Europe, Africa and North America. The game includes five different event types: Rally, Rallycross, 'Trailblazer,' 'Land Rush' and 'Raid.' The World Tour mode sees players competing in multi-car and solo races at new locations. <br/>  Dirt 2 was reviewed positively by IGN, receiving a score of 8.4/10 from the US site, The main criticisms of the game being reserved for the lack of weather and track deterioration, and the fact that damage now has very little influence on the game, with drivers receiving a brand new car for each race.[24] The features and expanse of the multiplayer component, which was often criticized in Colin McRae: Dirt as being fairly anaemic, was completely new and improved in Dirt 2.<br/>  <br/>  Gameplay:<br/>  Dirt 2 features five racing disciplines, all of which are playable offline (against AI bots when applicable) and online. In addition, three 'special modes' are included. Dirt 2 runs on an updated version of the EGO engine, which powered Codemasters' Race Driver: Grid  as well. The engine features, most notably, an updated physics engine, which models realistic weight transfer during turning maneuvers, allowing the player to incorporate advanced driving techniques, such as the Scandinavian flick. The Flashback ability, allowing players to rewind time mid-race, a new feature in Grid, was kept and improved due to its popularity.<br/><br/>RALLY: racing occurs on non-circuit roads which usually involve public (closed) routes and technically challenging courses. Usually involving staggered starts, each driver competes against the clock. In addition, during rally events, a co-driver is present, constantly reading pacenotes to guide the driver along narrow and meandering tracks of up to 6 km in length.<br/><br/>RALLYCROSS: races involve cars identical to those used in rally events; the races themselves, however, are completely opposite. Each rally-cross race involves up to eight racers competing in multiple lap events on circuit tracks of mixed surface type. The tracks, half tarmac and half dirt, exist in closed settings, such as in or around stadiums, and are approximately 1 to 1.5 km in length.<br/><br/>TRAILBLAZER: The most similar real-world equivalent of trailblazer events are hill climbs. Unlike hill climb events, however, trailblazer races do not require a positive change in elevation. Similar to rallying, trailblazing features staggered starts. Trailblazer (and hill climb) cars, unlike rally cars, usually feature massive aerodynamic aids, such as spoilers, diffusers, and splitters to help keep traction at higher speeds, regardless of track surface or conditions.<br/><br/>RAID: races are multi-car events involving heavyweight vehicles, such as buggies and trophy trucks. Each race begins with a simultaneous start of up to eight competitors, with tracks averaging 5 km in length.<br/><br/>LANDRUSH: events are similar to raid races, but take place on a circuit. Each event features eight racers on a dirt track of about 1 km, and involve multiple laps.<br/>  <br/>  Special Modes:<br/>  In addition to the five straight game types, there are three special variants, each applicable to multiple modes.<br/><br/>GATECRASHER: which uses Rally courses and cars, involves smashing yellow barriers; competitors race against the clock. When smashed, the 'gates,' strategically placed along the best racing line, add time to the clock; whichever racer finishes the event with the most time on the clock wins. The format of the race is more similar to a multi-competitor time trial than to a traditional rally race.<br/><br/>DOMINATION: playable Rallycross and Land Rush stages, involves multiple drivers competing to set the lowest time in any given track sector. Points are awarded based on the final number of controlled sectors, as well as the final race position.<br/><br/>LAST MAN STANDING: is an elimination-style race, during which the driver in last place is eliminated in a 20-second interval. &quot;<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;Dirt 2&quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "80754": {"poll": [], "name": "Ballistix", "videogamemode": ["Local Multiplayer", "Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["Acorn Electron Cassette edition", "BBC Micro / Acorn Electron Cassette (Blue Ribbon) edition", "BBC Micro and Master Series 5 1/4\" Disk edition", "BBC Micro Cassette edition"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic797299.jpg", "videogametheme": ["Sports - Other"], "usersrated": "1", "videogamedeveloper": ["Superior Software (UK)"], "videogamegenre": ["Sports"], "videogameplatform": ["BBC Micro"], "average": "9", "statistics": [], "videogamepublisher": ["Blue Ribbon", "Superior Software (UK)"], "videogamecompilation": ["Play It Again Sam 14"], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic797299_t.jpg", "description": "User Summary:<br/><br/>Ballistix is a one- or two-player futuristic sports game.

Our hero starts in the King's throne room and is transported, via a teleporter, to the castle. The castle is made up of two types of playing area: flick-screen rooms in the manner of a platform game and two large scrolling mazes. On the ZX Spectrum, Amstrad CPC, and MSX these are &quot;Cold Upper Maze&quot; and the &quot;Slimey Lower Maze&quot;; on the Commodore 64 they consist of &quot;The Castle Gardens&quot; and &quot;The Castle Dungeons&quot;.<br/><br/>An additional part of the gameplay is the ability to collect objects (found in both the rooms and the mazes) scattered around the castle and sell them for money. Some of these objects can combine or react to create an object of higher value (for example, the 'bar of lead' and the 'philosophers stone' react to create a 'bar of gold').

There are no penguins in this game.

We needed a name for this new system we&rsquo;d come up with, and we were stumped. Eventually one or other of us came up with The Penguin Harlequinade because there are penguins in Dunedin (where we&rsquo;re from) and not in Wellington; and because the system was designed as a Commedia Dell&rsquo;Arte system and the Commedia was called a Harlequinade in England.<br/><br/>If you really want to play a game with penguins in it, look out for The Penguin Masquerade, a forthcoming game which we have yet to write.

The Michigan Rummy board consists of nine sections.  WINNING PAY CARDS are indicated next to each section on the board.  The round center section is the Michigan Rummy Pot.<br/><br/>HOW TO PLAY:<br/>(1) THE DEAL.  The deal is determined by cutting the cards, high card winning the deal.  Players then place one chip in each of the3 nine sections of the plastic tray, except the dealer who places two chips in each section.  The dealer shuffles the cards and deals all of them out, one card at a time to each player, to the left.  One extra, or dummy hand, is dealt in front of the dealer.  It does not matter if some players receive one more card than others.<br/><br/>(2) THE PLAY.<br/>(a) The dealer picks up either one of the two hands before him.  The dealer may, after looking at his hand, have the option of exchanging his hand for the dummy hand (but without looking at the dummy hand) or selling the dummy hand to the player making the highest bid for it.  Any player (including dealer) cannot exchange his hand for the dummy hand if he holds a PAY CARD.  The exchange of hands must be made complete.  Player cannot retain any of the cards in his original hand.  The amount of chips bid for the dummy hand go to the dealer and the player making the bid then exchanges his own hand for the dummy hand.  The extra hand is then put aside.<br/><br/>(b) POKER. Before beginning the actual play of MICHIGAN RUMMY a hand of poker is played for the chips in the poker pool section.  Each player forms their best poker hand with five cards from his hand.  The remainder of their hands are kept face down in front of them for later use. The dealer starts the betting and can bet, or pass, the other players doing likewise.  The bets and raises are placed in the poker pool section, and the winning hand receives all these chips.<br/><br/>(c) MICHIGAN RUMMY. The players take up all their cards and the dealer starts by playing the lowest card of any suit in his hand he wishes (Ace is high, duece is low).  He MUST play the lowest card of the suit he chooses.  He calls out the card and places it in front of him.  The player who holds the next higher consecutive card in the same suit plays it, placing it in front of him and calling out its name, etc., and this continues until the Ace of the suit is played, or a STOP is reached (due to the dummy hand holding the next high card).  The player who played an ACE or STOP card reopens with the lowest card in his hand in ANOTHER suit and play continues accordingly.  If a player cannot reopen with a card of another suit after a STOP, play ends there and there is no payment for the deal.  Any player who plays a PAY CARD takes all the chips from the corresponding section of the playing board (i.e. if you play the King of Clubs you collect all the chips in the King of Clubs section).  In order to collect for some PAY CARDS, they must be played in sequence by the same player (i.e. Queen of Hearts, King of Hearts, and 7, 8, and 9 of any suit).  The first player to discard all his cards wins all the chips in the Michigan Rummy Pot (round center section).  A variation may be played by having the winner collect one chip from each of the other players for every card remaining in that player's hand, in addition to the Michigan Rummy Pot.  The game is then over and the deal goes to the left for the next game.<br/><br/>The players again place a chip in each of the nine sections (the dealer placing two chips in each section) even though some chips may still remain from previous play.<br/><br/>After the final game of play, it may be found that chips remain in several sections of the playing board.  If this is the case, all of these chips may be placed in the POKER POOL section and a &quot;showdown&quot; hand of poker may be played.  Five cards are dealt face up to each player and the player with the best POKER HAND wins all the remaining chips on the board.  If players are not familiar with hand values in poker, below is listed, in order, winning combinations:<br/>(1) Straight Flush (3-4-5-6-7) or any other sequence of five cards all one suit.<br/>(2) Four of a kind.<br/>(3) Full house (three of a kind and one pair).<br/>(4) Flush--all one suit, but not in sequence.<br/>(5) Straight--(3-4-5-6-7) or any other sequence of different suits.<br/>(6) Three of a kind.<br/>(7) Two pairs.<br/>(8) One pair.<br/><br/>Also see:<br/><br/>    Tripoley<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>"}, "80834": {"poll": [], "name": "Combat Wings: The Great Battles of WWII", "videogamemode": ["Local Multiplayer", "Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["NA Wii edition"], "average": "0", "videogametheme": ["Flight", "War - World War II"], "usersrated": "0", "videogamedeveloper": ["City Interactive (CI Games)"], "videogamegenre": ["Flight Simulator"], "videogameplatform": ["Wii"], "statistics": [], "videogamepublisher": ["City Interactive (CI Games)"], "description": "User Summary<br/><br/>Combat Wings: The Great Battles of WWII lets players take flight as an Allied pilot in a variety of theaters in WW2.

It was developed by Ocean Software and released in 1993, and 1994. The game is viewed from a top-down view for most of the game reminiscent of the Zelda games. When the player enters a building, the gameplay perspective shifts to a first person view. The game is significant for combining two different perspectives and a 3-D game for a fourth generation videogame console, and for being an early game mastered in surround sound (Dolby Pro Logic).<br/><br/>In the game, the player controls Alan Grant, and the objective of the game is to complete certain tasks in order to escape, such as clearing a raptor nest of eggs, and turning the generator on in a utility shed, allowing for opening and closing of gates and the like. Communication ports set up around the island allow characters in the game to communicate advice to the player, though some advice is deliberately malicious. Jurassic Park supports the SNES Mouse  when playing first-person sequences or operating computer terminals. The game's soundtrack consists of various music that corresponds to the area the player is currently exploring (except the two Tyranosaurus Rexes who have their own theme track). The game typically takes 2&ndash;3 hours to complete, though some objectives, such as collecting all 18 raptor eggs, can slow down a player's progress. The current world record for fastest completion, however, is one hour and nineteen minutes, held by Paul Inglehart. There is no way to save the game, however, there are an unlimited number of continues available.

You will recruit trainers, armourers, medics and even prostitutes.

In the first phase, called Forum phase, Players will play aggressive auction for what the market has to offer them: athletes for training and professionals for Gymansium&rsquo;s management.

The Sport! is a video game for the Nintendo Entertainment System that was released in 1987; it uses the Nintendo Light Gun and is considered to be a capture the flag-style game played with paintball guns loaded with simulated paintballs. The player's mission is to get through the level, capture the enemy flag by shooting it, and return it to your base. This is while simultaneously trying not to get shot by the other team, run out of ammo, or run out of time. A light gun is necessary for this game, but one needs to also use the controller. The directional pad will move the screen left and right. Ammo boxes can be found sitting on the ground or carried by enemies in the background. Interestingly, it seems that only misses cost you ammo, so if one's aim is precise, they will receive a significant bonus for leftover ammunition.<br/><br/>There are three levels in the game: Woods, Warehouse District and Snow Fields.

An evil space pirate, Kaiser Greedy, has made the planets' leaders obey him. The inhabitants of Planet Neer (Flora outside Japan) pray for a hero before Greedy's mind control snatches them. The desperate prayers reach the nebula of the Star Goddess, Oruto. She awakens one of her children, Ristar, with the sole purpose of granting the wishes of the innocent people. He must stop Greedy and the brainwashed leaders of each world in the galaxy, to restore peace to the galaxy.<br/><br/>In Mega Drive versions outside Japan, Oruto is not seen. Instead, Ristar has a father figure, the Legendary Hero, who is a shooting star that protects the Valdi System. Rather than Oruto awakening Ristar, the Legendary Hero was kidnapped by Greedy, and it is up to Ristar to rescue his father as well. However, Oruto is still seen in the Game Gear version.<br/><br/>Ristar is unable to jump as high as most platformer protagonists do, but his jumps have a bit more hang time, meaning he stays in the air longer. By pressing the grab button, Ristar will stretch his hands forward, grabbing whatever is ahead of him. The player can make his hands go in any one of eight directions by combining the attack with any direction on the control pad, except downward while on the ground. When Ristar grabs an enemy, he will continue to hold it until the button is released, causing him to collide with the enemy and destroy them. He can also grab walls and obstacles this way and it is possible, albeit time-consuming, to climb walls by continually grabbing diagonally up a wall. It is possible to get on top of walls via this method, but it is rather difficult because of the timing and reflexes needed to keep Ristar from plummeting. This move can be used in a variety of ways, such as grabbing a mid-air enemy to swing across gaps, or holding onto an enemy to avoid getting pulled in by a current.<br/><br/>Ristar's health is shown as four stars in the upper-right corner of the screen. Taking damage removes one star. When all four are gone, the last star falls on Ristar's head and he loses a life. Stars can be found throughout the levels, which replenish his health. These and other items must be picked up manually with Ristar's attack. A gold star restores one hit point, while a silver star refills health completely.

To start a round, a theme is shown, e.g. &quot;Women like it...&quot; Everyone thinks about this and selects a tile from his set, but does not show it to the other players. Players lay their tiles picture-side down on the table, and these tiles are mixed up with random tiles from the stock.<br/><br/>On the board there are slots which are numbered from 0 to 6. Tiles are placed next to slot 3 so that everyone can see the pictures. The goal for each player is to have his tile reach the top (slot 6) of the ranking of items that best meet the requirement. Each player receives points equal to the slot number where his tile is at the end of each round. The point total is reduced if another player correctly guesses which tile belongs to whom and marks it with the player's color.<br/><br/>When it is your turn, choose two tiles in the same row/slot and compare them to one another in meeting the requirement of the theme. (Important: You can only compare two tiles in the same row. If there is only one tile in row 4, you cannot compare this tile to one in a different row!)<br/>For example, say, &quot;I think women like lipstick more than a car.&quot; Then, you move the lipstick tile up one row and the car tile down one row.

Each player has only one stone of each color and can only guess the active player, so this must be done selectively and timely!<br/><br/>The round ends when one tile reaches the 6 slot and another is in the 0. Then, you calculate the points. Each player gets points equal his slot, minus every correct guess stone on the tile.

The player is able to play through 16 stages with Lynch by his side, at times accompanied by other hired mercenaries. Co-op mode is available in which the second player will assume the role of Lynch. Though almost identical to Kane's style of gameplay, Lynch has short bursts of aggression in which nearly all AI characters are police, some sporting an animal's head. Lynch carries a shotgun and a revolver as side arm, while Kane carries an assault rifle and standard pistol, though it is possible to swap weapons. Additional weapons such as grenades, sniper rifles and carbines can be picked up which can also be swapped between allies. The player can take cover by standing next to a wall, and can blindfire. While having hired mercenaries, the player can issue orders such as follow, move to a specific position, or attack&quot;<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;Kane &amp; Lynch&quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "80948": {"rpgdesigner": ["Edwin A.

The cards have shapes and patterns in different colors on them and are flipped by the players one by one around the table.  If two players have cards that match the same symbol, regardless of color, both players must grab for a totem pole in the middle of the table. The player who successfully gets the totem, give his or her cards to the one who was not as fast.

The penalty for knocking the totem over, or taking it when you aren't supposed to: taking all of the flipped over cards on the table.  There are also special cards which modify how the game is played, such as having all players grab the totem at once, or to match on color rather than pattern.<br/><br/>The video game version also includes the card game's expansion, Jungle Speed: The Extreme Expansion.  Players can choose to play with or without the expansion by ticking a check box.  The expansion adds different pattern cards and other new special cards.<br/><br/>Jungle Speed uses the motion control of the Wiimote or nunchuck to mimic the card game's action of grabbing the totem pole.  Players can also set records in the game for things like the fastest grab, or the most cards gained, or the most wins in a row.

These clues give the players Mystery points and more points can be earned in the bonus levels. If the player accumulates 10,000 points, they will receive an extra life.

Though the view out of your cockpit was only blue and green (or yellow) and all object (terrain, targets, aircraft) were basically a few hollow lines, it was a thrilling experience to man a F-15 and fly it in a mix between simulation and arcade: you didn't have to know all the ins and outs of a jet fighter, but you needed to understand and be able to use of of the most important features of the plane: use of the radar, weapons systems, ECM, flares etc. Looking back at the platforms on which it was played, it was an amazingly deep simulator.<br/><br/>According to wikipedia, the game won the &quot;Action game of the Year&quot; in Computer Gaming World's 1985 reader poll and sold over 1.5 million copies<br/><br/>"}, "80984": {"poll": [], "name": "Point of Attack 2", "videogamemode": ["Asynchronous Multiplayer", "Hotseat", "Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["Win98/ME/NT/2000/XP"], "average": "0", "videogameseries": ["Tactical Studies Series"], "videogametheme": ["Military", "War - Modern"], "usersrated": "0", "videogamedeveloper": ["HPS Simulations"], "videogamegenre": ["Strategy"], "videogameplatform": ["Windows"], "statistics": [], "videogamepublisher": ["HPS Simulations"], "description": "POA2 is a modern tactical level simulation that depicts combat over a wide range of circumstances and levels, from platoons and individual vehicles to company or higher sized units.

The weapons database includes hundreds of systems from circa 1960 into those the might be fielded the near future, all modeled in amazing detail.

Weapons could now only be used for a few times before breaking and could now be integrated with unique moves with certain characters, hidden characters were added and a few cutscenes were included to give the story greater depth.<br/><br/>The game is more fast-paced than its prequels. Running and vertical-dodge moves were added, and most player attacks deal less damage than in the predecessors. The level timer has been replaced with a &quot;power meter&quot; that, when full, allows players to perform special moves without draining the player's life bar.<br/><br/>Unlike the first and second game, weapons in Street of Rage 3 can only be used a fixed number of times. However, additional weapon special attacks could be performed. The game also features team in which two characters work together to perform a powerful attack. Blitz moves, performed while players run, were altered so that they can be upgraded in strength over the course of the game. The player would have to earn a set amount of points on one life to upgrade it. Losing a chance would put the blitz move down a level, but the upgraded moves are still possible to do by pressing X on a 6 button controller, followed by a button sequence.<br/><br/>Traps in stages were brought back from the original game, for example, enemies can once again be thrown into pits or off the side of an elevator.<br/><br/>Enemy AI was expanded so more enemies can pick up weapons, block attacks, employ co-operative attacks (usually, a Big Ben-like enemy will throw one of the Garcia enemies at the character to smack them down), and even steal exposed food items to regain health.<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;Streets of Rage III&quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "80987": {"videogame": ["Power Flight!"], "poll": [], "name": "F-15 Strike Eagle III", "videogamemode": ["Cooperative", "Network Multiplayer", "Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["DOS 3.5\" Disk edition", "DOS CD-ROM edition", "UK DOS Edition"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1436492.jpg", "videogameseries": ["F-15 Strike Eagle"], "videogametheme": ["War - Modern"], "usersrated": "4", "videogamecharacter": ["McDonnell Douglas F-15 Eagle"], "videogamedeveloper": ["MicroProse"], "videogamegenre": ["Flight Simulator"], "videogameplatform": ["DOS"], "average": "6.5", "statistics": [], "videogamecompilation": ["Power Flight!"], "videogamepublisher": ["MicroProse"], "vgcharacterversion": ["McDonnell Douglas F-15 Eagle"], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1436492_t.jpg", "description": "User Summary:<br/><br/>F-15 Strike Eagle III is an F-15 Strike Eagle combat flight simulator and is the sequel of F-15 Strike Eagle and F-15 Strike Eagle II.

Many historians feel that without interference from Hitler, the German commanders might very well have avoided the fate of Napoleon and won the war on this critical front.
