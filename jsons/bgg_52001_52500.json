The powers of fate have chosen them to become involved with a series of violent murders at the abbey.<br/><br/>Chendy is an abbey of the Laranian Order of Hyvrik, held from the Bishop of Ternula. Someone is killing clerics of the abbey. But why isn't there a corpse to be found after each murder? Are there in fact really any murders, or is someone playing a devious game? Why are the other noble guests of the abbey so chilly and remote? Has the time of the final battle between Larani, the shining guardian of Dolithor, and Agrik, the Lord of the Four Horsemen finally come, fulfilling an ancient dark prophecy?<br/><br/>In an atmosphere of fear, mistrust, political intrigue, and religious hysteria, the characters must discover the answers to these questions if they hope to survive. Dead of Winter contains detailed descriptions of a Laranian abbey and village situated on the southern edge of the Ternu Heath in Kanday. The complicated political situation in Kanday and the kingdom's difficult relations with its neighbors impact the plot.

It includes a modular starship construction system (fully compatible with GURPS Vehicles) and a space combat system for ship-to-ship encounters.<br/><br/>GURPS Traveller also brings you the official alternate universe for Traveller, in which Emperor Strephon, and the Third Imperium, have survived to face new challenges.

Each character is designed so that they can be used as player characters or non-player characters (or both). Adapt, modify and enjoy.<br/><br/>"}, "52247": {"rpgdesigner": ["Bruce R.

However, soon the economy failed and the stores were left to decline, leaving thousands of empty husks hanging lifeless on the shelves, waiting for someone to give them a home and love them dearly. This love never came.<br/><br/>Dr. Reginald Keeton, the CEO of TeddyBears, Inc. took three popular things and combined them into a marketing frenzy unlike anything anyone had seen before.

The bears were bloodthirsty killers and performed exactly as he directed.<br/><br/>Children and their misguided parents lined up to watch their favorite stuffed animals slash and tear each other apart, ripping the enchanted fluff from their guts, all while the audience screamed in sheer joy.

He named his creations ScareBears.<br/><br/>Then the trouble began. The souls became restless and unhappy in their condition. Frankly, they were a little pissed they had been trapped in puny little furry bodies, can you really blame them? People began disappearing from the set of the TV show, the telltale sign of a little fluff left at the scene of the crimes was a dead giveaway as to who was at fault. Initially Keeton did all he could to cover the problem and continue his show. Quickly the bears out smarted him and began plotting.<br/><br/>Recently, a few bears failed to appear for their performance. Their cages were checked but found empty.

This original Dungeons &amp; Dragons scenario is suitable for a party of four characters who together have between 24 and 28 levels of experience.<br/><br/>Adventure Preview<br/><br/>Introduction<br/><br/>The Alchemist's Eyrie takes the characters into a fortified dwarven tower, where they are sent to recover some needed items. When they arrive, they discover the tower has been captured recently by a warband of renegade lycanthrope dwarves. Between the interlopers and the remaining traps set by the late owner, the characters may find themselves in deep, despite the lack of head clearance.<br/><br/>Background<br/><br/>Durzh is -- well, was -- a renowned dwarven alchemist who hailed from a nearby dwarven stronghold. Paranoid, surly, and antisocial, Durzh was nonetheless one of the most brilliant minds the dwarves had in the realm of alchemy.<br/><br/>The Alchemist's Eyrie centers on a tower built by and for Durzh by his people. Here, in relative seclusion, Durzh was able to perform research and develop his strange concoctions, undisturbed by the noise and earthshaking industry common in large dwarven underground cities. Since his research and wares were very valuable to the dwarves, he was given a garrison of soldiers to guard the fort, although they had to abide by his rather strict rules of conduct.<br/><br/>Recently, Durzh worked on a remedy for a contagious illness that had been plaguing his home stronghold. Through the effects of his medicinal potions, the disease was contained and thought to be cured. The dwarven healers were wrong, however; the disease was merely contained. It has now broken out again, and the stronghold needs more medicine to distribute among the populace to put an end to this illness for once and for all.<br/><br/>Sadly, Durzh's fame has become widely known. A variety of merchants drop by his tower from time to time to barter for his wares. They then transport these throughout the land. As Durzh's fame spread, the rumors of his wares and his cures for illness eventually reached the evil ears of a pack of dwarves afflicted with lycanthropy.<br/><br/>These dwarves -- as well as a solitary gnome they &quot;recruited&quot; -- were infected by a wererat deep in their tunnels, and now they are wererats as well. They came to Durzh in the dead of night and assaulted the tower. They slaughtered the guards, captured Durzh, and demanded that the alchemist help them. They wanted him to find not a cure for their disease, but rather a way to control the side effects better. He refused, and was slain.<br/><br/>Enter the characters.<br/><br/>"}, "52292": {"rpgdesigner": ["Monte Cook"], "rpgitemversion": ["Electronic Version"], "rpgseries": ["Wizards of the Coast - Free Adventure Downloads"], "name": "An Eye for an Eye", "rpgartist": ["Cynthia Fliege", "Sean Glenn"], "rpgproducer": ["Sue Weinlein Cook", "Mark A.

In a battle among the gods themselves untold aeons ago, a discharge of divine might changed the weather patterns of the world so that once every few decades, an oily black rain pours out of particularly dark clouds.

Even the gods themselves can do nothing to remedy this. Clerics lose all spellcasting ability, wards are suppressed, and so on.<br/><br/>During the time of a black rain, all characters lose the ability to cast divine spells or use divine spell completion items. Clerics lose the ability to channel positive or negative energy, and divine-based classes such as the paladin or druid lose supernatural or spell-like abilities (in the paladin's case, for example, this includes detect evil, divine grace, lay on hands, divine health, aura of courage, smite evil, remove disease, and turn undead).<br/><br/>Further, divine spell effects currently active when the rain starts, including permanent divine spell effects such as glyphs of warding, hallow, or bull's strength cast on a character, are all suppressed for the duration of the rain.<br/><br/>Background<br/><br/>Terrid Fomgarten was a cleric of St. Cuthbert until his fellow priests found him extorting money from local merchants to protect them from criminals and evildoers. He was kicked out of the church and even spent some time in prison for his misdeeds. For years, he stewed in humiliation and regret, spending his waking hours training in martial skills to pass the time.<br/><br/>Terrid was not an evil man -- at least not to start with. Being a former Cuthbertian, however, he was prone to thoughts of retribution. Eventually one day, an erinyes devil named Yallathancia approached him in disguise. Over a fine dinner and a bottle of wine, she gave him two important bits of information that led him down the road to evil. She told him where he could find two artifacts of evil power and she let slip the date of the next black rainfall. With this information, Terrid set upon his own plan for revenge against the church of St. Cuthbert.<br/><br/>In his quest to get the artifacts, the iron rods, he encountered a powerful hydra and a number of creatures called bloodtrolls. Once he gained the rods, he used their power to master the monsters. Then, he bided his time for a few months, waiting for the moment when his foes would be at their weakest -- during the coming black rain.<br/><br/>Yallathancia showed him how to construct special rugs with teleportation circles on them. These special circles connected to each other like two-way gates. He kept one in his home, and one near the ruins where he found the artifacts (where his monstrous retinue stayed, including even Yallathancia). He made one to take to the temple with him on the day of the coming rain.<br/><br/>Finally, the day he waited for came.<br/><br/>"}, "52298": {"rpgartist": ["Franck Achard", "Aleksi Briclot", "Julien Delval", "Sophie Guilbert"], "rpgitemversion": ["Soft Cover"], "poll": [], "name": "Agone: King of Spring", "rpgdesigner": ["Pierre Coppet", "Jean-Baptiste Lullien", "Adam Pasztory"], "rpgproducer": ["David Benoit", "Nicolas Hutter", "Tristan Lhomme", "Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Weil"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic555386.jpg", "usersrated": "6", "average": "7.41667", "statistics": [], "rpg": ["Agone"], "rpgpublisher": ["MultiSim"], "rpgcategory": ["Scenario / Adventure / Module"], "rpggenre": ["Fantasy"], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic555386_t.jpg", "description": "From the back cover:<br/><br/>With the coming of winter, all doors and shutters in Gloomwind are locked tight.

Bugbear and ogre warriors fought brutal wars of expansion, earning great fame and amassing considerable fortunes from their predations. Those who died in battle were buried in large tomb complexes dug into hillsides and honored as patrons of the living. Among these tombs was the large tor known as Hightower. Though it was neither the largest nor the most famous of the kingdom's tombs, Hightower did represent a typical example of this kind of structure.<br/><br/>As happens to all such nations, the cruel humanoid kingdom eventually fell to a more powerful foe that razed all its cities and outlying fortifications. Of the tombs, only Hightower escaped destruction -- largely because it was an unimportant monument in a remote location. A few tribes of humanoids that survived the devastation tried to use it as a fortress, but the humans with whom they clashed defeated them soundly and sealed the entrance with a huge, round stone to ensure that the tor could no longer be used as a base. Since then, Hightower has served as a landmark for travelers in the know, but it has otherwise been largely forgotten.<br/><br/>But the electrical storms that have plagued the area in recent days have been quite severe, and a few weeks ago, a stray lightning bolt broke open the stone seal. Tonight, yet another terrible storm is sweeping through the wilderness, driving all creatures to take shelter where they can find it. Hightower looms on the horizon, and its door is no longer blocked. Will the PCs dare to enter its silent halls?<br/><br/>About the Authors<br/><br/>Owen Kirker Clifford Stephens was born in 1970 in Norman, Oklahoma.

Meanwhile, a mysterious riddle has appeared on the walls of the local shrine -- a riddle which may hold the key to vanquishing the ettin.&quot;<br/><br/>Next in our series of monthly free adventures, JD Wiker gives us The Ettin's Riddle, an original Dungeons &amp; Dragons adventure suitable for a party of 2nd-level or 3rd-level player characters.<br/><br/>Adventure Preview<br/><br/>Background<br/><br/>Just over two years ago, a group of adventurers learned that the inhabitants of a small hamlet had been forced to flee their home when an evil wizard took control of the local keep. The adventurers confronted the wizard in his lair and defeated him, but not without suffering heavy casualties. Only two of them survived the battle.<br/><br/>One of the two who survived was a young cleric named Kyrnyn. During the battle, the evil wizard, Stondylus, polymorphed Kyrnyn into an ettin. Already under the effect of a charm spell, Kyrnyn aided the wizard in pounding his former friends into paste.<br/><br/>After Stondylus was finally vanquished, Kyrnyn's surviving partner, a young rogue named Hartmund, promised to go find some help. Hartmund advised Kyrnyn to stay out of sight -- to avoid being taken for a real ettin -- until he returned. Kyrnyn never saw Hartmund again.<br/><br/>When Kyrnyn ran out of food, he began hunting the local wildlife. Soon he had cleared the area around the wizard's keep, forcing him to range farther afield. He encountered the occasional hunter, but swiftly learned that if they didn't immediately run from him, he was better off running from them. The old keep became his hiding place.<br/><br/>It was not long before Kyrnyn began attracting monstrous attention. He was approached by a band of orcs seeking some &quot;muscle&quot; for their planned raids -- including one on the very villagers whose former keep he now occupied. He turned them down -- violently -- and learned just how easy it was to take advantage of his new body's brutal strength.<br/><br/>When the survivors of the orc group persuaded several ogres to try to take him down, Kyrnyn discovered that his savagery was greater than he?d dreamed. His second head -- which he?d always thought of as merely an extra set of eyes and ears -- took on a life of its own, directing his powerful limbs in ways he wouldn't have chosen himself.<br/><br/>At first Kyrnyn believed that he had been imagining things. But the next time he encountered a hunter in the forest, his other head again took charge, and before he could will his limbs to stop, he had beaten the poor man to death. Kyrnyn could only watch in horror as, day after day, his second head took control of their mutual body.<br/><br/>In time, the second head -- calling itself &quot;Muck&quot; -- gained almost complete control of Kyrnyn's body. Kyrnyn became an unwilling passenger, and worse, a witness to Muck's atrocities. When Kyrnyn objected, Muck pummeled him unconscious. The only times Kyrnyn could operate his body were when Muck was asleep.<br/><br/>Kyrnyn had given up on Hartmund ever returning, and resigned himself to life as an ettin -- until this development. Now he renewed his efforts at restoring himself to his true form. Through prayer, he came to realize that he could one day cast a dispel magic divine spell, suitably powerful to undo the polymorph spell that had so drastically altered his life.<br/><br/>But Kyrnyn found that his deity, Heironeous, would not grant him the dispel magic spell. Instead, Kyrnyn was granted a vision of a kind of riddle:<br/><br/>&quot;Two heads have we, but born with one.<br/>We avenged, healed, and protected.<br/>Our master was Invincible,<br/>But punished we all who objected.<br/>Heeded we the six-armed king,<br/>And so by our god were rejected.<br/>Thus, this is our fate:<br/>One head, twice bisected.&quot;<br/><br/>"}, "52312": {"rpgdesigner": ["Eric Cagle"], "rpgitemversion": ["Das Auge der Sonne", "Electronic Version"], "rpgseries": ["Wizards of the Coast - Free Adventure Downloads"], "name": "The Eye of the Sun", "rpgartist": ["Cynthia Fliege", "Sean Glenn", "Robert Lazzaretti"], "rpgproducer": ["Mark A.

But now his power and that of his secret supporters is threatened by the popularity of an heir who hopes to make a change for the betterment of the people. Can the PCs take on the dragon and his minions and restore power to the barony's rightful ruling line? Download this new adventure by Owen K.C. Stephens and let your PCs face the dangers of the dragon lair! Fait Accompli is suitable for 12th-level characters.<br/><br/>Adventure Preview<br/><br/>The small barony of Icenvale is located in the far north, on the edge of an arctic wilderness. The area is rich in natural resources -- particularly furs, fish, and iron ore -- but the harsh conditions make capitalizing on this wealth difficult at best. Thus, the barony's exports are low and its economy is weak. Since most of Icenvale's residents are content just to survive the six-month winters, they give little thought to events beyond their own borders. But they are a sturdy, hardworking people, and their respect for tradition is as great as their respect for law.<br/><br/>One reason that Icenvale has stayed out of the local political arena is that it lacks an official ruler. A white dragon named Hinterbite slew the last baron of Icenvale more than three hundred years ago and stole his symbol of authority -- a rod of rulership. By Icenvale law, an heir to the title must have that specific rod (not some copy or replacement) to take power. Though the baron's heirs and their supporters certainly did not lack the drive and the capability to take on the dragon and recover the rod, an ancient prophecy states that should the ruling family ever lose it, only outsiders -- that is, folk not of Icenvale heritage -- can recover it. Any Icenvale resident who participates in such a venture is doomed to die before it ends. This odd combination of ancient law and prophecy has thus far kept any of the baron's heirs from assuming control.<br/><br/>A Guild Council made up of local master crafters and artists stepped into the void and quietly took control of the barony's civic functions. For the past three hundred years, this council has made most of Icenvale's ruling decisions. Though it has no official power, most citizens accept it as a ruling body in the absence of a true ruler.<br/><br/>Orielle Bladeworthy, a well-liked young paladin, is currently the only legal heir to the baron's throne. Like her predecessors, however, she cannot take power because she does not have the rod. Though she has toyed with the idea of ignoring the prophecy and setting off to recover the rod herself, the citizens have thus far dissuaded her from doing so because her death would mean that Icenvale could never again have a ruler of the true blood.<br/><br/>However, the situation in Frosthaven, capital of Icenvale, is becoming increasingly unstable. Orielle has accepted the fact that she may never be able to rule, but she has recently begun pushing to make the barony a republic and place the political power in the hands of the citizens. So far, she has gained little support for the idea, but her efforts (as well as the heroic actions she has taken in defense of Icenvale) have made her very popular with her people.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, Hinterbite has grown older and larger, taken a mate, and produced a brood of young. Though his mate died fighting a group of adventurers, the youngsters have grown strong and cruel. The four young dragons and their father have begun raiding larger and larger areas. Orielle has announced her intention to kill the dragons in order to save her people, and only a vast public outcry has thus far prevented her from making the attempt. Thus, she is currently in search of heroes to undertake the task on her behalf.<br/><br/>"}, "52314": {"boardgamedesigner": ["Chris Gammon", "Bob McNamara"], "statistics": [], "bgaccessoryversion": ["Avalon Hill Apple II edition"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic962166.jpg", "description": "From Morale Desperation - The ASL Website of Mark Pitcavage:<br/>&quot;Always a step or two behind the times when it came to computer games, Avalon Hill released a crude game assistance program (GAP) for ASL in 1988.

Now there is a company, Midkemia Press, where once a group of friends thought they might 'break even' with a new gaming aid.  now there are two cities (Carse by Abrams and Abrams, and Jonril by A. Abrams and Feist), a large town (Tulan of the Isles by Feist and S. Abrams) and its companion underground adventure (The Black Tower by Guinasso and S.

As with any first product from a new company, comments from users and further experience on our part has pointed out possible improvements.  Therefore, in this second edition, we have expanded existing tables, increase the ease o use, vastly improved the art, and included an entirely new section designed to aid in populating each Gamesmater's own villages, town and cities.  Nothing from the first edition has been deleted.

Players take the role of The Gifted, ordinary people who -- by divine providence or pure chance -- have been granted extraordinary powers. Occasionally seen as saviors, they are most often scorned and hunted as sorcerers and demons, witches and charlatans.<br/><br/>Whether heroes or villains, The Gifted are forced by the superstitions of the day to hide from public scrutiny. But they can't escape their nation's crisis. Whether they are spying for the Confederacy in Washington, riding with Quantrill in Missouri, or marching with Sherman through Georgia, The Gifted must make the difficult choice between using their powers and avoiding the dangers of discovery. If The Gifted can survive the ordeals of war, they -- like their nation -- will be changed forever.<br/><br/>Written by Allan Goodall and illustrated by Todd Shearer, This Favored Land includes everything you need for a thrilling Civil War campaign: Detailed rules for adapting Wild Talents to the war; weapons and rules for the deadly injuries that made Civil War battles so infamous; an in-depth history of the Civil War; a complete scenario to begin play at once; and much more.<br/><br/>"}, "52330": {"rpgartist": ["Rick Britton", "Kent Burles", "Liz Danforth", "Pete Fenlon", "Angus McBride", "Clarence Nave", "Jessica Ney", "Stephan Peregrine", "Wayne Reynolds"], "rpg": ["Middle-earth Role Playing (1st & 2nd Editions)"], "poll": [], "name": "Arnor", "rpgdesigner": ["Lisa J.

Weakened by a decade of humiliation from foreign powers following the Opium War, the Qing Imperial Government is at odds with itself about how to rule the country.  One side argues that China should adopt Western practices and institutions in order to level the playing field abroad.  The opposition claims that China must continue to stand defiant of foreign influence and forge its own path.  At the same time, a failed Confucian scholar in a desolate region of the South has recently proclaimed himself a high place in a foreign religion--the younger brother of Jesus Christ.<br/><br/>So moved by his visions, he begins gathering followers to act against the government whose Confucian ideals had ranked him so poorly.  The pool he draws from consists not only of those who had been downtrodden and forgotten by the massive and corrupt governmental bureaucracy, but also wealthy families who believe a Han Chinese national could lead their people much better than the foreign Manchu from the North, who had conquered China almost two centuries before.<br/><br/>This prophet's name? Hong Xiuquan<br/><br/>His mission?  To expunge the Manchu demon rulers from the Han kingdom and usher in a new era of peace and prosperity on Earth.<br/><br/>The eventual death toll?  Over 20 million.<br/><br/>Welcome to the Heavenly Kingdom of Greater Peace--Taiping.<br/><br/><br/>Game Information<br/><br/>The Scramble for China is a two player war-game set in the most destructive period of the 19th century, the Taiping Rebellion.  You either play as the Taiping, a pseudo-Christian movement that is sweeping South and Central China and wishes to topple the Manchu-run government and create a new culture for China, or the Qing dynasty, an incompetent gigantic imperial administration that is trying to hold the country together and stop the momentum of the Taiping.<br/><br/>Players progress through the game using cards drawn into their hand; the cards either have an event written on them or a number of Action Points, and players take turns playing cards one at a time.  Action Points allow the players to recruit armies(colored blocks), form up troops into different types of units and attack the enemy.  During the course of the game both players can call upon foreign soldiers to get the edge in battle, and the Taiping will try and meet up with rebels in nearby provinces to add manpower into their army.  Victory goes to whichever side has the most victory points at the end of the game.  Most victory points are earned by holding red city spaces at the end of turn 8, but the Qing player gets bonus points for every city never lost, and the Taiping player for every rebel piece picked up.<br/><br/>A third Non-Playable faction exists in the game through 'The West'.  'The West' steals points from the Chinese players for every foreign unit on the board at the end of the game, randomly receives points for how much attention it is paying to China through 'The West' deck, and earns points from player card events and Chinese casualties.  It is very possible that both Chinese players will lose and the West triumphs, so Chinese players must be weary in how they utilize foreigners...<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "age": "8", "name": "The Scramble for China", "playingtime": "45", "boardgamemechanic": ["Campaign / Battle Card Driven", "Point to Point Movement", "Simulation"], "average": "4.5", "usersrated": "2", "boardgamesubdomain": ["Wargames"], "boardgamefamily": ["Country: China"]}, "52334": {"rpgdesigner": ["Geoffrey Brent", "Alain H.

As a result, the nearby river and lake have flooded several times, and crops in the village gardens and orchards have rotted from excessive moisture.

They were so named for their habit of hiding their faces behind black cloth coverings. Their leader was a mysterious woman of human height but uncertain heritage. She had a cunning mind and great charisma. Her black veil hid most of her face, showing only her eyes, which glittered with cold fire like two diamonds. Rumors about the Black Veils? leader abounded: &quot;She is a medusa,&quot; said some. &quot;She is a half-fiend,&quot; said others. &quot;She is a half-fiend medusa,&quot; said still others.<br/><br/>In fact, she was a human named Mollie McTynker, a local girl who simply used the veil to disguise herself. Even while leading the band, she lived in the town of Fiore, appearing as nothing but a pretty lass with many suitors. While in her everyday guise Mollie learned much of use to her as a bandit leader, such as which merchants were shipping what goods, and where, and when the law was hunting the bandits.<br/><br/>The Band of the Black Veils grew bolder with every success until at last its members were able to sack and usurp the Ramshorn Abbey, a prosperous enclave of cloistered holy folk living on land reclaimed from the fen.

The bandits broke up the system of dikes and ditches that had drained the fen and held back its waters, and soon the abbey stood on an island, a formidable fortress.<br/><br/>Mollie McTynker moved to the island, but by that time she had recruited many of her own relations in town to act as her spies. The band became more wealthy and powerful than ever.<br/><br/>The band?s power was not destined to last, however. The bandits made many enemies when they sacked the abbey, and soon word of their depredations reached the ears of the mighty. Barely six months after the fall of the Ramshorn Abbey, a royal army routed the bandits. Mollie McTynker was killed along with most of her lieutenants. Only a handful of bandits escaped into the fens. In Fiore and the surrounding towns, Molly?s ring of informants was rooted out.

If they're right, it will take more than the impoverished town can muster to save its people.<br/><br/>To Quell the Rising Storm is suitable for 10th-level characters.<br/><br/>Adventure Preview<br/><br/>In the year since the war that ravaged this country ended, the land has been slow to heal. No crops grow in the burned fields around the town of Evenfall, and the locals will be hard pressed to survive the winter, let alone defend themselves from any new incursions. But the evidence suggests that some evil force stands ready to take advantage of the poorly defended villages in the frontier. Gnolls are the most likely candidates, but the fact that these evil humanoids have ceased their usual unorganized raids is an ominous sign. Has someone organized them into a true fighting force? If so, who -- and more importantly, why?<br/><br/>The folk of Evenfall have begun to fortify their town and outposts against the unknown threat as best they can. The town has fielded a few guard patrols to check the area for humanoids, and its citizens have been keeping to themselves. The streets practically roll up at dusk, since no one wants to be out at night. What they need, however, are heroes -- heores who are willing to brave the unknown in search of answers. Are the PCs up to the task?<br/><br/>"}, "52382": {"rpgartist": ["Tony Bagge", "Peter Bergting", "Paul Bonner", "Niklas Brandt", "Nils Gulliksson", "Lars Nordbeck"], "rpgitemversion": ["Imperial - De f\u00f6rd\u00f6mda klanerna", "Imperial: Les Clans de la Damnation", "Soft Cover"], "poll": [], "name": "Imperial: The Clans of Damnation", "rpgdesigner": ["Matt Forbeck", "Nils Gulliksson", "Fredrik Malmberg", "Magnus Seter", "Jerker Sojdelius", "Michael Stenmark", "Henrik Strandberg", "Stefan Thulin"], "rpgproducer": ["Nils Gulliksson", "Henrik Strandberg", "Stefan Thulin"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic530806.jpg", "usersrated": "11", "rpgsetting": ["Gryningsv\u00e4rlden (Mutant)"], "average": "6.85455", "statistics": [], "rpg": ["Mutant Chronicles (1st + 2nd Editions)"], "rpgpublisher": ["Descartes Editeur", "Target Games"], "rpgcategory": ["Scenario / Adventure / Module", "Sourcebook (rules/options to enhance play)"], "rpggenre": ["Science Fiction"], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic530806_t.jpg", "description": "From the back cover:<br/><br/>Long ago, when the first three Megacorps - Capitol, Bauhaus, and Mishima - had already claimed most of the solar system for themselves, a group of families banded together to become the fourth of those all-powerful entities: Imperial.<br/><br/>This shining new star shone the light of its curiosity into the darkness of the Void, and there they stumbled upon the tenth planet Nero and the First Seal of Repulsion, which they broke by their very presence, releasing the Dark Soul upon a hapless Humanity.<br/><br/>In the years since, the Clans have fought bravely against the evil beyond the reach of our sun's radiant warmth.

As the years passed, it gained a reputation as a spot whose defenses were powerful enough to keep undead in and tomb robbers out. Adventurers began to bring the remains of any creatures they suspected might become restless in death to the Tomb Steppe for interment, and in time they also sought aid against such creatures from the friendly priest. After his death, a brief spate of undead activity commenced, then died away once again.<br/><br/>As the years passed, the tales of undead activity in the Tomb Steppe faded into legend, and colonists began to move into the lands nearby. The town of Night Falls was founded a short distance from the graveyard, and it grew quickly into a thriving trade center and farming community. Realizing that the Tomb Steppe was safe enough during the day, the citizens began burying their dead there rather than building new crypts on pristine farmland. Because this method of interment was cheap and easy, people from many surrounding communities brought their dead to the town as well. The business of burial brought new prosperity to Night Falls, and a guild called the Funerary House sprang up to control the trade.<br/><br/>But it seems that the threat from the Tomb Steppe has not entirely been laid to rest.

At the juncture of the two roads is a small sign with an arrow pointing down the secondary road. It reads, &quot;Oblivion.&quot;<br/><br/>The sign was placed here by the pixies as a joke when they realized that the former access tunnel for the valley was now an exposed road.

When it was complete, he performed an unholy ritual and sealed himself into the rod, imbuing it with intelligence as well. Before his death, the Forsaken arranged for the rod to be delivered as a gift to a cleric named Alantria, the leader of one of the more powerful drow houses.<br/><br/>The power and ego of the rod overwhelmed Alantria; it utterly controlled her, started a civil war among the drow, and caused countless deaths. In what would be the last battle of the 'Tween Wars, Alantria was slain, and the rod passed into history, likely buried with the fallen champion in her ornate crypt within the war-ravaged drow city.<br/><br/>The Last Few Centuries?<br/><br/>Drow moved away from this area of the Underdark.

Scholars among the surface dwellers and the drow, endeavoring to discern its meaning, unearthed a prophecy written about the time of its last appearance. The prophecy seems to concern the comet's return (see below).<br/><br/>Last Week?<br/><br/>A group known as &quot;the Holy&quot; arrived in the town of Gryth, asked questions about the Underdark, and left the next day. (They didn't tell locals of their mission: to discover the rod called Dark Fate on behalf of their church.) Things went poorly for the group, though, as they were attacked by a number of Colossal monstrous spiders and driders. The spiders' poison affected more than one party member, including their guide -- a bard named Morning Glory -- and the Holy's leader called for a retreat. Unable to carry off all the wounded, one group member took a hair from Morning Glory's dead body and left it, planning to resurrect her once they got back to town.<br/><br/>However, the bard was not dead, only dying.

It is a wet- and dry-erasable board with a steel core, so the included magnets stick right to it! It is portable&mdash;about the size of a sheet of paper&mdash;so you can take it anywhere you're gaming.<br/><br/>Use it to quickly and easily track turns. Write the PC's, enemies', and NPC's names on the player magnets using a wet- or dry-erase marker, then place them in initiative order. Use the blue magnets for PCs, black magnets for enemies, and green magnets for NPCs. Hash marks label positions 0&ndash;25, making it easy to put the magnets in the correct initiative order. When the order changes, simply slide the magnets to their new places.<br/><br/>The turn indicator magnet points to whose turn it is; never accidentally skip someone again! As the round progresses, slide the turn indicator to point to the next player; it's now that player's turn. At the end of the round, the turn indicator will point to the next round magnet.<br/><br/>The next round magnet serves as a reminder to move the round indicator magnet. The round indicator points to the current round number, so you'll always know exactly which round it is! Write which round spells and effects expire in the notes section of the Combat Pad (e.g. &quot;haste ends round 10&quot;). Additionally, the notes section is a great place to record damage or anything else necessary to make combat run smoothly.<br/><br/>For tactical groups, delaying and readying guides make it simple to synchronize attacks&mdash;enemies beware! Slide the player magnet to the proper guide and avoid the confusion common with other initiative tracking methods.<br/><br/>Each Combat Pad includes:<br/><br/><br/>        1 magnetic wet- and dry-erase board<br/>        2 combat round indicators<br/>        8 player character magnets<br/>        4 non-player character magnets<br/>        8 enemy magnets<br/>        2 next round indicators<br/>        2 active turn indicators<br/><br/><br/>"}, "52414": {"rpgdesigner": ["Corey Macourek"], "rpgitemversion": ["Accessory"], "poll": [], "name": "Friends & Foes", "rpgproducer": ["David A.

Some of the king's other advisors have been making unusual recommendations of late, and the king has been taking their advice. Courtiers disappear without a trace or die under mysterious circumstances, those in power change their minds without apparent reason, and courtiers with unpopular opinions encounter personal emergencies that force them to leave the court. Can the PCs find and expose the nefarious source of these strange events? Find out in the latest miniadventure for D&amp;D v3.5 by Robert Wiese. Drop this free online adventure into any large city that supports a court environment. Suitable for four 11th-level characters.<br/><br/>Adventure Preview<br/><br/>The court of a ruler attracts intrigue the same way it attracts peasants looking for justice. Courtiers vie for position and favor with the ruler, and enemies plot to overthrow him and install themselves -- or at least someone more friendly to their own interests -- in his place. A veneer of civility covers this chesslike game, masking its harsh purpose and sometimes deadly import. Indeed, a modicum of pleasantry is essential, since rapidly shifting loyalties can turn enemies into allies and allies into enemies in the span of an hour. Open hostility could easily destroy any possibility of future alliances with today's enemies, so it is always better to hedge one's bets.<br/><br/>It is said that the real rulers of a nation rule from behind the throne. While this assertion may not be true in all cases, it is certain that when a ruler is not strong-willed, some crafty advisor almost always makes the real decisions. Such a courtier has infiltrated the court of King Ceral, and he has begun taking steps to ensure that he and he alone holds the true power.<br/><br/>"}, "52416": {"rpgdesigner": ["Jeff Alvarez", "Joe Boulden", "Christopher Self"], "rpgitemversion": ["Accessory"], "poll": [], "name": "Council of Thieves", "rpgartist": ["Crystal Frasier", "Christophe Swal"], "rpgproducer": ["Jason Bulmahn", "Erik Mona"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic605990.jpg", "usersrated": "4", "rpgsetting": ["Golarion"], "average": "6.4375", "statistics": [], "rpggenre": ["Fantasy"], "rpgpublisher": ["Paizo Publishing"], "rpg": ["Generic / Universal"], "rpgcategory": ["Accessory (dice, maps, screens, cards)"], "rpgseries": ["Council of Thieves", "GameMastery", "Pathfinder Cards"], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic605990_t.jpg", "description": "From the publisher's website:<br/><br/>fantastic spoils of the Council of Thieves Adventure Path take form in this new assortment of 54 unique GameMastery Item Cards.

As a wealthy, well-educated aristocrat, you have travelled the world and had the fortune to enjoy your life to the fullest &ndash; but you see that history is about to change course and you know that in order to stay strong, your family must prepare well. You need to find new allies. You must absorb smaller families and use their potency to strengthen your kin. You have to arrange wise marriages, nurture strong connections at court, obtain titles, build mansions, and find the right spouses for your daughters and sons...<br/><br/>Legacy: The Testament of Duke de Crecy enables you to build a powerful dynasty in 18th century France as you step into the shoes of a French noble and compete for lasting honor. Over three generations, you &ndash; a resourceful patriarch or matriarch &ndash; will attempt to create a lasting legacy by establishing a house with ties to many different wealthy and powerful families from France and abroad (Spain, Italy, Russia and other countries).<br/><br/>This card game offers endless possibilities. Each time you build a family, you write a unique story, bringing to life the diverse relationships between parents and their children, between cousins, uncles, aunts, nephews and nieces. Whether you are looking for the best husband for your only daughter or a suitable wife for one of your two sons, whether you are looking to add new blood to your family by marrying into foreign nobility &ndash; you will be working to make your family rise in status through prestige and wealth, new skills and abilities.<br/><br/>In Legacy: The Testament of Duke de Crecy &ndash; known previously as Nobles of Paris and winner of Ducosim Spelontwerp in 2009 &ndash; you will find 75 spouse cards with unique traits, more than twenty secret missions, nine titles, and nine &quot;contribution to the family&quot; cards. This all culminates in a highly thematic card game that will satisfy players who enjoy exploring many different paths to victory.<br/><br/><br/>Legacy is a worker placement game in which you take actions to improve the standing and/or wealth of your family. You will expand your family, creating an ever-growing tableau, the family tree. You will need to balance the three 'currencies' in the game, Prestige (converts to Honor points at the end of each generation, of which there are three), Income (your income which converts to hard cash at the end of each round, of which there are 9), and Friend cards (which are actual connections/friends, and are the only way to marry into wealthy/famous families, and can only be received through actions, such as  marrying a woman who brings some of her social contacts with her).<br/><br/>Prestige, Income and Friend cards can be gained and lost. You can, for example, lose some prestige by marrying someone infamous or lose some Honor points (i.e. reputation) by asking friends for money. There are also numerous actions you can take that will affect one of the three 'currencies' detrimentally, such as bribing someone to get a title (for which you need to pay, but also in the loss of friends who felt they deserved that title, and not you), or the maintenance of a beautiful new park you have built for the people (losing you income). Finally, you can also take actions that result in the loss of some of your social contacts (friends), due to jealousy, or people simply no longer wanting to be associated with you.<br/><br/>These currencies are carefully balanced by the male and female friend cards in the game. Generally men will give you income and possibly prestige, but will cost you a dowry/wedding costs. Women, on the other hand, will give you connections (new friends you can choose from the current socialites (cards lying open on the table) and possibly prestige, and will sometimes even earn you a dowry!<br/><br/>The card interactions allow for multiple different paths to success, but you must choose your road strategically, planning out where you want to be headed, else you will be left behind in the dust by those with greater and more successful plans than yours.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "1", "boardgameversion": ["English first edition", "English second edition", "French first edition", "German first edition", "Polish first edition", "Russian first edition"], "average": "7.27301", "name": "Legacy: The Testament of Duke de Crecy", "playingtime": "60", "boardgamemechanic": ["Card Drafting", "Hand Management", "Set Collection", "Worker Placement"], "age": "8", "boardgameexpansion": ["179750", "149264", "183272", "224414", "179751", "179752"], "usersrated": "3067", "boardgameaccessory": ["Legacy: The Testament of Duke de Crecy \u2013 Magnate Set"], "boardgamesubdomain": ["Strategy Games", "Thematic Games"], "boardgamefamily": ["Cities: Paris (France)", "Country: France"], "boardgamepodcastepisode": ["#12: New Dawn, The Manhattan Project, Legacy &amp; The Bloody Inn", "1P 087 - Imperial Settlers", "AP Podcast \u2013 Episodio 16: Essen 2013", "BGA Ep. 42 - Dead of Winter", "Episode 006 - Legacy: The Testament of Duke de Cr\u00e9cy", "Episode 12: An Octodog Leaves A Legacy Of Children On A Battlecruiser", "Episode 36: Legacy: The Testament of Duke de Crecy and Wisdom Check 1", "Episode 41 -- Lightning Table Clearance Round", "Episode 5 -- 10 Times 10 Plus 1 Equals 22", "Essen 2013 - Portal Games", "HLG 13: Terugblik op 2016", "HLG 8: Gelukzoekers", "Kampen mod de ud\u00f8de", "nba001 \u2013 \u2018Ich bin dein Vater, Luke\u2019", "Planeta de juegos 15 - Wargames de un d\u00eda", "Podcast #067 - Rese\u00f1as de novedades Essen 2013", "Podcast #069 - \u00bfCriticamos con sinceridad a los autores espa\u00f1oles?", "The Game Pit Episode 14.3 - Treasure Hunt Essen 2013"]}, "52462": {"rpgdesigner": ["Cam Banks", "Russell Brown", "Eric Cagle", "Jesse Decker", "James Jacobs", "Paul Leach", "Nicolas Logue", "Mike Mearls", "David Noonan", "Richard Pett", "F.

Since the demise of their civilization thousands of years ago, their race has steadily declined, until it became a mere shadow of its former self. While most of the kopru have succumbed to their monstrous natures and degenerated into barbarism, a few kopru matrons remember the tales of their race's former glory and seek to restore the golden age of the kopru empire. Most avoid their ancestral ruins because of the powerful magical safeguards placed there by the conquering elves to bar access to those sites, but recent raids in the area of a ruined kopru city suggest that one matron may have found a way around them and begun rebuilding the once-great Kopru Empire. Darrin Drader offers an adventure for 12th-level characters that showcases the new material on undersea adventuring and several new monsters from Stormwrack. So download this web enhancement now and let your PCs address the lurking threat beneath the waves!<br/><br/>Enhancement Preview<br/><br/>Thousands of years ago, a cruel, aquatic race called the kopru embarked on a mission of conquest and established a mighty undersea empire. The legendary might of these creatures was rivaled only by their cruelty to both enemies and subjects. The vicious kopru conquered and enslaved all the other sentient aquatic races with which they came into contact, including aquatic elves and sahuagin.<br/><br/>The aquatic elves who had not yet been enslaved by the kopru built their settlements far away from the empire's borders, but still they lived in fear of its expanding army. Constantly fortifying their defenses, the elves watched and waited for the day when their enemies might attempt to annex their territory and enslave them.<br/><br/>The sahuagin had not yet reached the pinnacle of their power as a race, but their numbers were increasing, and those not already absorbed into the empire harried its borders on a regular basis, seeking to free their enslaved kin. An individual kopru could easily defeat a single sahuagin, but the sahuagin often overpowered kopru defenders by sheer numbers. However, even the clerics of the shark god Sekolah could not provide the sahuagin with the leadership they needed to overthrow their kopru oppressors.<br/><br/>At last, as the elves had feared, the kopru began expanding once again, pushing the borders of their holdings outward. The aquatic elves saw this expansion as a real and imminent threat to their continued survival, so they sought allies for a final stand. The elf leaders met in secret with the leaders of the various sahuagin factions and eventually formed what would be an effective but short-lived alliance.<br/><br/>Bolstered by elven magic and complex strategic planning, the sahuagin army moved against the kopru expansion forces. In a single week, the unlikely allies attacked and sundered one kopru outpost after another. The cost in sahuagin life was enormous, but still they persevered.<br/><br/>After the kopru incursion into elven and sahuagin territory had been repelled, the sahuagin wanted to continue the fight, and the elves were more than willing to lead them into battle. The campaigns went on for years, gradually forcing the kopru farther and farther back within their borders. In time, their empire was simply overrun. Their cities were reduced to rubble, their slaves were freed and added to the invading army, and their citizens were slaughtered wholesale by the bloodthirsty sahuagin. The few surviving kopru fled their ruined cities and went into hiding.<br/><br/>Once they had soundly defeated the kopru, the aquatic elves and sahuagin fell to bickering over whose contribution to the war had been more valuable. Their alliance fell apart, and in less than a year, the two races were once again sworn enemies. Though a number of sahuagin fought to retain unity within their own race so that it might take the kopru's place as the dominant force of the deep, old rivalries quickly resurfaced and splintered the tribes, diluting their power.<br/><br/>For thousands of years, the kopru have remained in hiding, maintaining small communities and avoiding the races their ancestors had once enslaved. Most of their settlements are built in undersea caves, often near their ancestral homelands. But the powerful magical wards set up by the elves, still in place after all these years, have thus far kept them from entering the ruins of their ancient civilization.<br/><br/>Now, however, it appears that one of the matrons has found a way past the wards and taken up residence within one of the ruined cities. Who can penetrate the occupied city and put an end to the empire-building aspirations of the matron and her followers?<br/><br/>"}, "52469": {"rpgartist": ["Toni Dennis"], "rpgitemversion": ["First Printing", "Soft Cover"], "statistics": [], "name": "Special Weapons Weapon Data Supplement", "rpgdesigner": ["David McKenzie", "Barry Nakazono"], "rpgproducer": ["David McKenzie"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic530750.jpg", "usersrated": "4", "average": "7", "rpgissuearticle": ["Phoenix Command"], "rpggenre": ["Crime (Spy / Espionage)", "Modern", "War"], "rpgpublisher": ["Leading Edge Games"], "rpg": ["Phoenix Command"], "rpgcategory": ["Sourcebook (rules/options to enhance play)"], "poll": [], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic530750_t.jpg", "description": "From the back cover:<br/><br/>This Special Weapons Supplement to the Phoenix Command Combat System contains all the necessary rules and data for a wide variety of unusual or distinctive weapon systems, included are:<br/><br/>- Riot Control Gear, from Tear Gas to Plastic Bullets<br/>- Protest Weapons, from Rocks and Bottles to Molotov Cocktails<br/>- Incendiary Weapons, from White Phosphorus Grenades to World War II and Modern Flamethrowers<br/>- Modern Military Equipment, from Claymore Mines to Miniguns<br/>- Archery Equipment, from the Horsebow of ancient times to the modern Compound Target Bow<br/>- Weapons of Stealth, from Silencers for Sub-machineguns and Pistols to Garrotes and Strangulation Techniques<br/><br/>This supplement allows Phoenix Command players to incorporate a wide variety of powerful, unusual, or highly specialized weapons into their gaming.<br/><br/>"}, "52470": {"rpgdesigner": ["Monte Cook"], "rpgitemversion": ["Electronic Version"], "rpgseries": ["Wizards of the Coast - Free Adventure Downloads"], "name": "A Question of Ethics", "rpgartist": ["Cynthia Fliege", "Sean Glenn", "Robert Lazzaretti"], "rpgproducer": ["Sue Weinlein Cook", "Mark A.

Not all decisions are easy. Two forces are at odds in this scenario, and neither is clearly good nor clearly evil. Drop this free online adventure from Dungeon Master's Guide author Monte Cook into your campaign and find out whom the player characters decide to aid -- or hinder. It's suitable for four 12th-level characters.<br/><br/>Six months ago, an adventuring group that calls itself the Company of the Shining Stone learned of an aged wizard's tomb that lay in the rocky foothills of a prominent mountain range, and sought to plunder it. What they were not counting on was that a band of stone giants would move into the immediate area to make their lair. The giants have rebuffed the company's attempts at getting past them and to their goal.<br/><br/>Now is the time of the annual fair in Adurath, a small town located not far from the tomb, and thus, the giants. The giants have no interest in the town or the tomb, but are instead interested in a rare mineral found only in that region. A few of the townsfolk have seen the giants, but there has been no confrontation other than between the giants and the Company of the Shining Stone.<br/><br/>Which group will the PCs decide to help: the Company...or the giants?<br/><br/>Adventure Preview<br/><br/>The fair of Adurath boasts a many contests of skill and strength. The most famous is the Arcane Challenge?.<br/><br/>The Arcane Challenge<br/><br/>The Arcane Challenge has been held here for at least 20 years, and has become wildly popular among the attendees. The challenge, held on the first day of their fair, consists of three rounds. Each is based primarily on speed, although the three observing judges have the power to award discretionary bonus points for style and finesse. Magic items are allowed, but rarely earn points for style. No one may to cast spells on or in any way affect the other contestants or their actions. Anyone seen doing so is immediately disqualified and fined 100 gp for the town coffers.<br/><br/>In the first round, each contestant must destroy a huge boulder rolled down from the hills. Each boulder measures 12 feet across.<br/><br/>In the second round, a peacock feather is placed atop a 100-foot-tall wooden tower erected just for the fair. The tower is just wide enough for one person to stand atop it. The winner of this round is the contestant to retrieve the feather and bring it to a judge first.<br/><br/>The third round consists of a metal needle hidden within a haystack. All the contestants have their own haystack and needle to find. The first contestant to find his or her needle wins the round.<br/><br/>Each round is worth 10 points for first place, 6 points for second place, and 2 points for third place, although round two has only a first place (only one contestant can get the feather). Up to 3 points per round might be awarded for style.<br/><br/>The prize is a special magical trophy statuette of a wizard that is animated (as a Tiny object) to move as if casting a spell, and a fully charged wand of detect magic.<br/><br/>The Contestants<br/><br/>The Arcane Challenge has drawn two powerful mages in addition to the local Stallis Silvereyes. Stallis hopes to blast the boulder with lightning bolts in round one (her weakest event), use a teleport spell in round two (levitating down from the tower after she has the feather), and in round three hopes to find the needle with her secret weapon: a rod of metal and mineral detection.<br/><br/>Evran the Master Enchanter, a 10th-level human wizard, plans to deal with round one by summoning thoqquas to destroy the stone. He plans to use a fly spell to reach the top of the tower in round two, and a gust of wind to help with round three.<br/><br/>Vanorunca is a 12th-level gnomish sorcerer. She will use a pair of disintegrate spells in round one, a fly spell in round two, and a locate object spell in round three. (As a side note, Vanorunca is a descendant of Harseth the Neverlost, and would not like it at all if she learned that anyone had found his tomb and planned to plunder it.)<br/><br/>Running the Contest<br/><br/>If the PCs get involved in the Arcane Challenge, each round is held one hour apart. Roll initiative for each wizard or sorcerer involved (Stallis has a +1 bonus, Evran a +2 bonus, and Vanorunca has a +6 bonus). The NPCs cast the spells listed above. The PC(s) can cast whatever spells or use whatever items he or she desires. If there is no PC influence in the contest, Vanorunca wins.<br/><br/>"}, "52471": {"rpgartist": ["Toni Dennis"], "rpg": ["Phoenix Command"], "statistics": [], "name": "Wild West Weapon Data Supplement", "rpgdesigner": ["David McKenzie", "Barry Nakazono"], "rpgproducer": ["(Uncredited)"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic530751.jpg", "usersrated": "4", "rpgitemversion": ["Softcover Version"], "average": "7.125", "rpgissuearticle": ["Phoenix Command"], "rpggenre": ["History (American West)"], "rpgpublisher": ["Leading Edge Games"], "rpgcategory": ["Sourcebook (rules/options to enhance play)"], "poll": [], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic530751_t.jpg", "description": "From the back cover:<br/><br/>Now the Phoenix Command Small Arms Combat System lets you ride with the soldiers and gunslingers of the American Frontier.

But what happens when people use ties of blood to exploit others? You may run into this problem in Monte Cook's new miniadventure, Thicker Than Water. In this module suitable for four 12th-level characters, one PC discovers a distant relative seeking help to complete a prophecy. Of course, things are never that easy -- particularly if the PC doesn't want to help?<br/><br/>Adventure Preview<br/><br/>Migos Fehr is the son of Charad, a mysterious air elemental creature somehow related to the Prince of Evil Air Elementals, Yan-C-Bin. Charad descended upon the material world about a century ago and, in the guise of a suave and dashing human, produced offspring with a number of mortal women, then he did the same thing again 30 years ago. Migos and his siblings all retain the traits of their supernatural father. Migos seeks the remaining carriers of Charad's bloodline. While he has found those from Charad's more recent visit, he also seeks those who descended from his actions long ago. He believes that people of his bloodline have a destiny (he calls it a &quot;holy destiny&quot;) and that they are generally superior to others.<br/><br/>Specifically, he wants to fulfill an obscure prophecy called the Presage of Forms. This prophecy, originally spoken by the seer Talla 900 years ago, states that when six examples of the perfection of form gather together, they can unlock something called the Power Universal and gain access to its limitless might.<br/><br/>As it happens, Migos is completely wrong in thinking that the prophecy refers to his brethren, and he's made other mistakes as well, which you will discover later in this adventure. But, of course, he does not know this. (He wouldn't accept the notion of his errors even if someone told him or offered him proof?he's that convinced.)<br/><br/>Character Hooks and Running the Adventure<br/><br/>This is an event-driven adventure, as opposed to a site-based one. Refer to the Dungeon Master's Guide, page 98, for a description of the difference. Basically, you can find here a number of events, all linked, to place in your campaign. You can space these events apart, with other encounters, events, or even whole adventures taking place between them. The amount of time between events depends mostly on the character hook used to get the PCs into the adventure and how much setup time you have...<br/><br/>"}, "52473": {"rpgartist": ["Brett Barkley", "Storn Cook", "Bob Cram, Jr.", "Andrew Cremeans", "Keith Curtis", "Jonathan Davenport", "Brendon Fraim", "Brian Fraim", "Malcolm Harrison", "Nick Ingeneri", "Sam Kennedy", "Eric Lofgren", "Roberto Marchesi", "Cara Mitten", "Terry Pavlet", "Scott Ruggels", "Klaus Scherwinski", "Greg Smith", "Chris Stevens", "Derrick Thomas", "Erich Von Hase", "Frank Walls"], "rpg": ["HERO System (5th Edition)"], "poll": [], "name": "The Ultimate Skill", "rpgdesigner": ["Steven S.

Does the mysterious death of the town's chief warden at the bony hands of skeletons have anything to do with it?<br/><br/>Download this new adventure by Skip Williams and give your PCs a bit of detective work to do to find out what's really happening in Pearlglen.<br/><br/>Shrine of the Feathered Serpent is suitable for 12th-level characters.<br/><br/>Adventure Preview<br/><br/>Shrine of the Feathered Serpent<br/><br/>Two generations ago, a series of localized but very deadly epidemics plagued the land. In the great cities, experienced clerics and other healers managed to keep the disease at bay. Most rural communities, however, lacked the resources to protect themselves adequately. The residents simply had to hope that their relative isolation and the meager skills of their residents would be enough to preserve them.<br/><br/>One such community was the woodland village of Pearlglen, so named for the freshwater pearls often found in the nearby river. The simple folk of Pearlglen had only their wits and the healing powers of their village priest to protect them. As fate would have it, the plague arrived quite suddenly in Pearlglen, carried by streams of refugees who were fleeing places already afflicted. The old village priest was among the first to succumb to the disease, but on his deathbed, he vowed that his village would not perish.<br/><br/>The very next morning, Pearlglen's savior arrived in the form of Tlanextic, an incredibly beautiful couatl. Tlanextic would not say whether the old priest's prayers had brought him to Pearlglen or whether he had merely been passing by. But whatever his reason for visiting, the couatl proved an excellent public health officer, and he quickly arranged to treat the afflicted who could be saved and to ease the passing of the doomed. He also made sure that the plague victims were properly buried to stem the spread of the disease. In less than a fortnight, Tlanextic's efforts had blunted the worst effects of the plague, and Pearlglen was disease-free within a month. When he was certain that the danger had passed, Tlanextic took his leave, promising to look in on the village from time to time.<br/><br/>In gratitude, the people of Pearlglen crafted a handsome statue of their savior using hardwood from the forest and pearls from the river. The statue stood in a place of honor in the village shrine, not far from the old priest's tomb. Over the years, Pearlglen became famous as the home of an astonishing couatl statue, and curious onlookers began to visit. Eventually, the church of Pelor expanded the shine and placed a fairly senior cleric there to keep an eye on the relic. In like manner, the village established the Wardens -- a sort of local militia -- to protect its citizens.<br/><br/>All has been calm in Pearlglen since, and the humans of the village have resumed their peaceful existence. But what is the nameless dread that now stalks the woods, causing fey and other woodland beings to give Pearlglen a wide berth? And what threat has brought Tlanextic back again?<br/><br/>"}, "52476": {"rpgartist": ["Toni Dennis", "Steve Huston", "Scott Miller"], "rpg": ["Phoenix Command"], "statistics": [], "name": "World War II Weapon Data Supplement", "rpgdesigner": ["David McKenzie", "Barry Nakazono"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic578612.jpg", "usersrated": "4", "rpgitemversion": ["Soft Cover"], "average": "6", "rpggenre": ["Action / Adventure (Gangsters / Mafia)", "History"], "rpgpublisher": ["Leading Edge Games"], "rpgcategory": ["Sourcebook (rules/options to enhance play)"], "poll": [], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic578612_t.jpg", "description": "From the back cover:<br/><br/>Now the Phoenix Command Small Arms Combat System lets you join the battles of World War II, with more than 80 of the most memorable weapons used during the conflict.

And what lurks in the shattered remains of its buildings? Are there really ghosts in Friezford? Or does the place hide more material dangers?<br/><br/>The mountain village of Friezford has been dead, but not entirely abandoned, for generations. Friezford is literally a ghost town, where spirits, both malevolent and benign, struggle to prevail. Outside the village, fearsome beasts and strange invaders from the depths of the earth stalk the shadows.<br/><br/>More than a century ago, Friezford was thriving and well on its way to becoming a small town. The economic heart of the village was Friezford Inn, a rambling stone edifice that served as a gathering place for local farmers and a much-appreciated rest stop for travelers, merchants, and adventurers crossing the mountains.<br/><br/>Well-kept farms ringed the village, keeping the inn supplied with simple, but high-quality fare, and the budding town had been gifted with a beautiful temple of Pelor, built by members of the local Friez family, who were successful merchants and landowners. The Friezes had lent their name to the settlement and founded the inn.<br/><br/>Phalloides Friez, high priest of the temple, ministered to travelers, villagers, and farm folk alike. Friezford's quiet prosperity gave Phalloides free reign to leave the community from time to time and go adventuring, and his successes only enhanced Friezford's growing wealth and reputation. The Friezford area became so well known for its abundance and friendliness that it even attracted a rare colony of good-aligned, peace-loving drow, who settled in a secluded valley less than a day's walk from the village. The drow named their community Hidden Dell.<br/><br/>Alas, prosperity can be a fleeting thing, and a series of disasters proved Friezford's undoing.<br/><br/>"}, "52480": {"rpgdesigner": ["Monte Cook"], "rpgitemversion": ["Electronic Version"], "rpgseries": ["Wizards of the Coast - Free Adventure Downloads"], "name": "A Frigid Demise", "rpgartist": ["Cynthia Fliege", "Sean Glenn", "Dennis Kauth"], "rpgproducer": ["Sue Weinlein Cook", "Mark A.

Dragon encounters are traditionally time consuming and difficult to prepare, so save yourself some time time by picking up this challenging and complex encounter for four 13th-level characters.<br/><br/>Charasta, an old white dragon, has not reached her age by being unprepared or foolish -- she is, in fact, much more intelligent than most white dragons.

Unless the PCs locate a hidden stone lever at the bottom of the shaft (DC 30 to do so) and pull it down, the stalactites immediately above the shaft in the cave are rigged to fall when anything passes 20 feet above the surface of the water. Anyone struck by these falling stones while climbing must make an immediate Climb check with a -4 penalty or fall.<br/><br/>Falling Stalactites: CR 5; Falling mass of rocks (10d6); Reflex save halves damage (DC 15); Search (DC 28); Disable Device (DC 24).<br/><br/>Treasure.

Their love was a simple one, uncomplicated by jealousy or parental expectations. But they were poor, so Ombrol knew he must make his fortune before claiming Taryn as his bride. On his sixteenth birthday, he pledged his undying love for his lady fair and gave her his family locket as a promise to return and marry her. Then he left the village to join the militia in a nearby city.<br/><br/>During his absence, Taryn's family fell on hard times. Several seasons of poor crops put the family deeply into debt. Taryn's father died of a wasting disease, and to keep their home, her mother had to grant her only daughter's hand in marriage to the local baron, an older man named Kaiius Holden. Thus, when Ombrol returned home six years later as a decorated soldier, he found that his one true love was already married, though the childless union did not seem to be a happy one.<br/><br/>Instead of returning to the city, Ombrol stayed on to help his family, since his parents were growing old and could no longer farm the fields as they once had. Meanwhile, he kept a silent watch on Baron Holden's manor and pined for Taryn. His love for her drove him to obsession, and he began to keep track of the times that Taryn left for the village. Eventually, Ombrol worked up the courage to approach her in the market.<br/><br/>Their meeting was brief, and what Taryn said unsettled Ombrol, worsening his already fragile mental state. Baron Holden was a cold man who was interested only in his own happiness and comfort. His youth had long been over, and their marriage was a loveless one. Worse yet, she constantly feared for her own safety, since all of the guards answered to him and gave her little regard. Taryn longed to return to her one true love, but breaking away from the baron would place the two lovers and both their families in grave danger. When their rushed conversation was over, Ombrol sullenly watched Taryn leave,<br/><br/>Over the next two months, the former lovers met in secret on several occasions. Each time, their separation weighed more heavily upon them. Ultimately, Ombrol decided to take action. Donning his armor and sword once more, he pledged his services to the baron so that he could be closer to his beloved Taryn. Baron Holden accepted Ombrol's pledge of loyalty and placed the young soldier in his personal guard.<br/><br/>By this time, Ombrol was well aware of the baron's schedule, and he often found excuses to stay behind while the baron went hunting or walked among his people. Ombrol and Taryn sometimes managed to sneak away together in the baron's absence. Ultimately, however, another guard caught them trysting, subdued Ombrol by force of arms, and took him prisoner. Left shackled in the dungeon to wait for the baron's return, Ombrol bemoaned his fate. But his lady love was a resourceful woman, and she managed to obtain the keys to his cell and his manacles from one of the guards. Sneaking into the dungeon, she let herself into his cell and unshackled him. Knowing that both of them would face the baron's wrath if they stayed, the two lovers fled the manor on horseback.<br/><br/>The baron and his men scoured the nearby woods for his wayward wife and his treacherous guardsman, and their trail was quickly found. The baron's men set up an ambush for the pair along a wooded roadside and fell upon Ombrol and Taryn as they passed through. Ombrol was quick to rise to his lady's defense, but Baron Holden's forces had the advantage of superior numbers. Though Ombrol fought furiously, dispatching several of the guards who had once trusted him as one of their own, the baron finally ended the battle by firing a bolt through his wife's heart. She died in Ombrol's arms. After watching the life fade from her eyes, Ombrol offered no resistance as the baron's guards chained him and returned him to the manor.<br/><br/>For years Ombrol prayed for death as he wasted away in Holden's dungeon. He mourned his lost Taryn, but his grief slowly gave way to a cold anger. During his long incarceration, Ombrol plotted how he would kill the baron. In the end, however, Kaiius Holden simply disappeared. Though his loyal retainers spent months searching for him, he was never found. When they finally gave up on finding the baron alive, the guards freed Ombrol. They bore him no ill will for what he had done, and they didn't wish to see him waste away for the rest of his life.<br/><br/>Upon his release from captivity, Ombrol learned that his parents had died poor and destitute. The baron had told them that their son had deserted them and their village, and he levied twice the standard taxes upon them as punishment for the young man's crimes. Upon learning their fate, Ombrol became sullen and angry. He returned to the house where he had been raised and began to drink heavily.<br/><br/>During this inebriated period, a voice began to speak to him, offering words of comfort and urging him toward revenge. It taught him to cultivate his hatred and focus his loathing until he could use the skills he had acquired in combat against people who were normally considered good and upstanding citizens. The voice belonged to none other than the demon prince Orcus, who sought to make the unhappy Ombrol his tool. Ombrol returned to the manor by stealth and slew the guards who still lived there, along with their families and the few members of Baron Holden's family that remained. Now a known killer, Ombrol went into hiding, but he was eventually tracked down and slain by the local militia.<br/><br/>But Ombrol was not to be allowed the peace of death. Orcus animated his lifeless husk of a body, transforming him into a death knight. He recruited the undead from the surrounding area into his service and used his fearsome army to conquer the manor house where he had once served the baron. Realizing that they had fallen under the control of a fearsome undead lord, the villagers quickly fled the area. Their dwellings eventually fell into disrepair, and the once verdant fields became choked with weeds. The death knight stayed in the manor, biding his time and occasionally ordering brutal attacks on people traveling through the area that he controlled.<br/><br/>And so matters remained for more than two hundred years. Recently, however, a young noble named Erim Holden came to the area with his entourage. A descendant of the baron's nephew and the last living descendant of Kaiius Holden, Erin sought to reclaim the family property. Upon realizing that only undead now inhabited the village, he left for the city to seek reinforcements. But Ombrol had seen Erim and instinctively recognized him as a relative of the hated baron. Lord Ombrol ordered his undead followers to attack the baron's men and take the noble alive. The undead slew many of Holden's guards, but Erim himself escaped to the city on horseback. Ombrol, intent on revenge, hired the Dragon's Fang mercenary company to help him deal with the living inhabitants of the city and locate the baron's nephew.<br/><br/>"}, "52489": {"rpgartist": ["Dan Colavito", "Brian Hagan", "Ralph Horsley", "Karin Jaques", "Mike Schley"], "rpgitemversion": ["Folio", "PDF version"], "poll": [], "name": "The Shattered Gates of Slaughtergarde", "rpgdesigner": ["Mike Mearls", "David Noonan"], "rpgproducer": ["Sven Bolen", "Randall Crews", "Jesse Decker", "Erin Dorries", "Josh Fischer", "Nick Isaac", "Angelika Lokotz", "Kim Mohan", "Christopher Perkins", "Chris Sims"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic530968.jpg", "usersrated": "14", "average": "6.51786", "rpgissuearticle": ["Brian's Small Press Picks", "First Watch"], "rpg": ["Dungeons & Dragons (3.5 Edition)"], "rpgpublisher": ["Wizards of the Coast"], "statistics": [], "rpgcategory": ["Scenario / Adventure / Module"], "rpggenre": ["Fantasy (High Fantasy)"], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic530968_t.jpg", "description": "From the back of the book<br/><br/>EXPLORE A SHATTERED DUNGEON WITH A DARK SECRET<br/><br/>Centuries ago, forces of good and evil collided in a titanic battle at the mountain fortress of Slaughtergarde.

So, in the &quot;spirit&quot; of the season, Owen K.C. Stephens gives us Haunting Lodge, a miniadventure suitable for four 17th-level characters. This site-based adventure centers around an exclusive getaway for high-powered sportsmen seeking some rather unusual game. Fair warning, though: This month's free adventure might make the hunters among you a little uneasy?<br/><br/>Adventure Preview<br/><br/>Set high in a mountain range on the edge of civilization is the Green Lodge, once headquarters for one of the most famous hunting clubs in the world. Its members were not satisfied with mere animals and beasts' they hunted aberrations, magic beasts, oozes, undead, and even young dragons. The members gathered once a year to boast of their exploits and show off their latest trophies. Ten years ago, bragging rights went to Lord Rowan Fane, who brought in the twelve stuffed heads of a runt Lernaean cryohydra.<br/><br/>Unfortunately for the members of the lodge, the spirits of the creatures they killed for sport did not rest easy. In particular, the runt cryohydra became a ghost, angered at its death and the display of its heads as ornamentation for its killers. After brooding in anger for a year, the spirit manifested as a ghost called the cold spirit when the hunters returned. Sealing the Green Lodge with a terrible snowstorm, the cold spirit killed all the hunters and awoke more of their victims as ghosts.<br/><br/>The lodge now sits frozen in a perpetual blanket of winter. No one has entered it for nine years, and the ice field around it has grown. Though no one knows what happened within the lodge, it is clear that anything that could kill the powerful hunters, who themselves had slain a menagerie of magic creatures, is too powerful for average heroes to contend with. Soon, however, the ice from the never-ending blizzard will encroach on local towns and mountain passes, making it impossible to live in nearby communities. If civilization is to survive near the mountains, someone must end the curse of the Green Lodge.<br/><br/>"}, "52492": {"boardgamedesigner": ["(Uncredited)"], "poll": [], "name": "Oral Sex!

With their powerful magic and well-trained minions, the Sarwins easily repulsed the uncoordinated hordes of orcs and giants that assaulted the region after every spring thaw. Likewise, their presence quelled the frequent earthquakes that had plagued the region.

It was the first Japanese domestic RPG (note: RPGs in Japan are generally known as Table-Talk RPGs, or simply TRPG, to distinguish them from computer-based RPGs). It was Tsukuda Hobby's first entry into tabletop roleplaying games, alongside the wargames that they were already publishing. And as Enterprise was based on an official license from Paramount/Tohokushinsha for Star Trek, it was the first Japanese RPG based on a licensed property.<br/><br/>BACKGROUND<br/><br/>Wargames were already popular in Japan in the early 80s, published by Tsukuda, Bandai and other hobby publishers. Tsukuda had their &quot;Hobby Simulation Game SF Series&quot; which included 1982's Star Trek: The Invasion of Klingon Empire (HG-009), a strategic wargame similar to Task Force Games' Federation Space; two Star Wars games, Death Star (HG-005) and Hoth (HG-010); and various titles based on the Gundam and Xabungle anime universes. Enterprise would be the first of the series to be designated as a &quot;role play game&quot;.<br/><br/>CONTENTS<br/><br/>Like most Japanese publications and boxed games, the quality of the components of Enterprise was exceptional. It came packed in a brilliantly colored hard cardboard box (8.5&quot; x 11.5&quot; x 1.5&quot;) featuring Kirk, Spock and McCoy on the front; and a black and white rear cover with a description of the game, pictures of some of the character cards and their stats, and a list of the game components, as follows:<br/><br/>- A 20-page Rulebook, almost entirely text with few illustrations and no other Star Trek photos<br/>- A 13-page Adventure book, including 4 pages of maps with a &quot;blueprint&quot; look to them<br/>- 15 double-sided Character Cards, coated for use with erasable markers or crayon; the front featured a photo of the player character, and the back listed their statistics and provided space for tracking hits, making notes and so on; cards were provided for Kirk, Spock, McCoy, Uhura, Scotty, Sulu, Chekov, Chapel, Rand, Commander Kang the Klingon, Stonn the Vulcan, Subcommander Tal the Romulan and three blank cards for NPCs and original Player Characters.<br/>- Two twenty-sided D10 dice (red and white, numbered 0-9)<br/>- One 9mm D6<br/>- Mail-in return survey card<br/>- 4-page 1983 Tsukuda Simulation Game catalog detailing the SF Series, HG-001 through HG-016<br/><br/>MECHANIC<br/><br/>Enterprise used its own one-off system: roll 2d10 under attribute for most task resolutions, as well as some percentile rolls. Each character has five basic attributes: Strength (1-18, which also acts as HP), Dexterity (3-18), IQ (10-18), Charisma (10-18) and Luck (3-18). Characters may also have Special Abilities (Mechanical Repair, Medical Talent, Science Talent, and a PSY (ESP) Talent with special powers).<br/><br/>Characters also have an Alignment -- Logical Good, Logical Bad, Neutral, Emotional Good, Emotional Bad -- that is cross-referenced with an opposing character's alignment to determine CH and IQ modifiers to opposed tasks. Hand-to-Hand combat is simply ST minus ST cross-referenced on a table to determine the % required to roll under.<br/><br/>There are rules for race, skills and custom character creation. The rules are structured in such a way as to support a &quot;basic&quot; game that consists of using the pre-generated characters and their cards in the adventure included with the game. But it stresses that the real fun is when players create their own characters, and game masters create their own scenarios, and the rules provide plenty of guidelines for doing so.<br/><br/>There are no rules for starships or starship combat, with adventures mostly limited to landing party type missions.<br/><br/>SCENARIO<br/><br/>The box set included a separate booklet, an 14 page adventure module entitled &quot;Scenario No. 1&quot;, the only official module released for (and included with) the game. The adventure is titled &quot;The Drifting Ring&quot;:<br/><br/>&quot;Captain's Log, Stardate 3205.6, Record of Captain Kirk<br/><br/>We are in pursuit of a spectacle beyond compare. The Enterprise discovered it while exploring within UFP territory near the Klingon border. It possessed a remarkable velocity that, in many ways, could not be believed. Spock judged that it must be an artificial satellite powered by some kind of technology.<br/><br/>But the size! It did not seem conceivable to me that this was a ship, dozens of times larger than our own Enterprise. Once it was before our eyes, however, our suspicions were confirmed. Now this enormous torus with a diameter larger than 10km is before us. Bones calls it &quot;The Drifting Ring&quot;.<br/><br/>However, &quot;The Ring&quot; is hurtling toward Klingon territory. This is our pretext, and we have no way of knowing how they&rsquo;ll react. We must investigate and stop the Ring. And we must do it as quickly as possible...&quot;<br/><br/>ADDITIONAL<br/><br/>There were no releases of supplemental material for the Enterprise game.<br/><br/>--from the translator<br/><br/>"}, "52500": {"rpgartist": ["Doug Chaffee", "Allen Nunis"], "rpgitemversion": ["First printing"], "statistics": [], "name": "The Final Weapon", "rpgdesigner": ["Ray Winninger"], "rpgproducer": ["Dee Barnett", "John Knecht", "Angelika Lokotz", "Caroline Spector"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic530855.jpg", "usersrated": "3", "average": "7", "rpggenre": ["Action / Adventure", "Crime (Spy / Espionage)"], "rpgpublisher": ["TSR"], "rpg": ["Top Secret/S.I."], "rpgcategory": ["Sourcebook (rules/options to enhance play)"], "poll": [], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic530855_t.jpg", "description": "From the back cover:<br/><br/>Inside this booklet are the details of a mission that will take TOP SECRET/S.I. game agents around the globe as they try to thwart the plans of the evil organization known as the Web.<br/><br/>By itself, that statement doesn't make this mission sound especially dangerous.
