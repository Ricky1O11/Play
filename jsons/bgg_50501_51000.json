It is worth noting that while it looks like any of the other dual system supplements for both Oriental Adventures and Legend of the Five Rings, it only provides mechanics for the former, not the latter.<br/><br/>Publisher's Blurb:<br/>The magic of Rokugan is unlike that of other campaign worlds - each spell, each magic item has a life of its own. Each bit of magic contains a spirit with its own will and desires. Magic of Rokugan not only introduces a great number of new magic items and spells usable with any d20 System campaign, but also contains many new optional rules for &quot;awakened&quot; magic items. New item creation feats and shugenja prestige classes are also included. Fans of the Legend of the Five Rings collectible card game or role-playing game will certainly recognize many of these updated items, but there are a number of new surprises as well.<br/><br/>Back Cover:<br/>The magic of Rokugan is not merely a force to be conjured- each spell, each artifact, each bit of magic is alive with its own will and desires. These spirits call out to those blessed with the power of the shugenja, granting them the ability to control the elements.<br/><br/>This book brings greater depth to the magic of the shugenja class, elaborating on the strange magic of the Legend of the Five Rings campaign setting. Within you will find the following:<br/><br/><br/>     New prestige classes, including the jade Magistrate and Master Smith.<br/><br/><br/><br/>     New shugenja feats, including the secret feats of the Great Clans. <br/><br/><br/><br/>     Advanced riles for awakening the power within a daisho- the sacred swords of the samurai. <br/><br/><br/><br/>     Over one hundred and fifty new shugenja spells. <br/><br/><br/><br/>     New magic items and artifacts, including the Celestial Swords, the Bloodswords, and the infamous Twelve Black Scrolls.<br/><br/><br/><br/>     And much more!<br/><br/><br/>This book is designed to work as a supplement for Rokugan, the d20 Companion for Legend of the Five Rings or merely as a sourcebook of interesting new spells and items for your d20 campaign.<br/><br/>To use this companion, a Dungeon Master also needs the Player's Handbook, the Dungeon Master's Guide, Oriental Adventures, and Rokugan.

Covers high-level campaigns and presents four new paths for character advancement.<br/><br/><br/>From the back cover:<br/><br/>All heroes aspire to something greater. Throughout the course of an adventuring career, a samurai might rise through the ranks of his clan, gain great accolades, and perhaps even come to command others. What happens next? Should a character be cast into retirement simply because his duties no longer require him to battle common bandits or deliver the commands of his superiors?<br/><br/>This book holds the answer to that question. What happens when a samurai steps forth from the common ranks and becomes an influential leader of the Empire? What happens when a warrior becomes a warlord, when a courtier becomes an influential ambassador, when a shugenja becomes a master of his own temple, or when a samurai seeks to create and teach his own techniques?<br/><br/>Within the Way of the Daimyo, you will find the following:<br/><br/><br/>     New rules for advanced character, including the Warlord, the Ambassador, the Temple Keeper, and the Sensei. These can build on existing characters or be completely new characters, creating new avenues of development for established heroes as well as novices.<br/><br/><br/><br/>     Updated rules for Glory and Status, allowing characters to more accurately track their positions with Rokugan's complex social system. <br/><br/><br/><br/>     Tips for advanced campaigns. What does a hero do once he's already saved the Empire? Step forward to help rule it, of course.<br/><br/><br/><br/>     Rules for creating your own school techniques, or even your own Minor Clan. <br/><br/><br/>This book is a dual-system supplement for the Legend of the Five Rings Role-Playing Game&trade;, Second Edition, and Rokugan&trade;, the d20 Companion for Legend of the Five Rings. Players and DMs may also find it useful as a source of interesting new feats and abilities for any d20 System campaign.<br/><br/>Game Masters running the Second Edition L5R RPG will need a copy of the Legend of the Five Rings Game Master's Guide&trade; and the Player's Guide&trade;.

Though the samurai and his art of the sword are the most obvious example of this, many other styles of combat co-exist, many relying on no weapon whatsoever. In countless dojos across the Empire, sensei instruct their students in ancient forms of martial arts. A true master can defeat any foe without use of a sword - but mastery is a long, difficult path.<br/><br/>Way of the Open Hand is the ultimate guide to unarmed combat for the Legend of the Five Rings role-playing game and Rokugan d20. The history of the Brotherhood of Shinsei and their unique master of the martial arts is explored in detail, as well as the secret martial styles of each of the Great Clans.

Some do this simply out of a need to find their place in the world. Some seek a path to power. Others wish to unlock this mystery merely because it is there.<br/><br/>The answers await, if only you bring the proper questions.<br/><br/>Within you will find:<br/><br/><br/>     History tradition and practices of Rokugan's premier order of monks- the Brotherhood of Shinsei.<br/><br/><br/><br/>     Secrets of enlightenment and the paths that one might take to reach it. <br/><br/><br/><br/>     New rules for campaigns seeking more dynamic martial arts flavor.<br/><br/><br/><br/>     Over twenty new martial arts styles, from the offensive and the defensive to the simply bizarre. <br/><br/><br/>This book is a dual-system supplement for the Legend of the Five Rings Role-Playing Game, Second Edition, and Rokugan, the d20 Companion for Legend of the Five Rings.

Though the rest of the dual system sourcebooks are set in a period much later than this, they went back in the timeline to produce this historical reference guide. Notable for being the last dual system sourcebook for both Legend of the Five Rings and Oriental Adventures, as both AEG and WoTC moved on to new core systems.<br/><br/>Publisher's Blurb:<br/>One man will save his master. The other will kill him.<br/>Just when hope burned most brightly in the Empire or Rokugan, a sinister shadow has fallen across the Jade Throne. Emperor Toturi I has been kidnapped, and the villainous Scorpion Clan have been unjustly accused of the crime. With only an inexperienced Imperial Chancellor to restore peace, the Great Clans fall into war among themselves. Old hatreds are awakened, old rivalries restored, and the Empire is consumed by war. When the Emperor is rescued, Rokugan's problems grow even worse, as it seems that Toturi is no longer himself...<br/><br/>The Hidden Emperor is a sourcebook for the Legend of the Five Rings Roleplaying game, retelling a period known as the War Against the Darkness, also known as the Hidden Emperor Story Arc in the L5R Collectible Card Game.<br/><br/><br/>     This is a dual system sourcebook featuring d20 and d10 statistics.<br/>     The Hidden Emperor is an excellent basis for a campaign if a GM wishes to set adventures during this historic period and also serves as a useful reference for this period in Rokugan's history.<br/>     Recounts the Hidden Emperor Story Arc for the L5R Role-Playing Game. Features a complete campaign set during this time.<br/>     Updates the statistics of many important L5R characters to take advantage of new mechanics as well as advancing them to this period in history.<br/>     Planned to be the last dual system sourcebook, a milestone in L5R history.<br/><br/><br/>Back Cover: <br/>Welcome to the Jade Empire.<br/><br/>The Emperor Toturi has ruled Rokugani for two years of peace, but that peace will soon be shattered. When the Emperor vanishes from his bedchamber, accusations and speculation fly. Old hatreds boil to the surface. Before long, the clans collide once more in a war that threatens the Empire.<br/><br/>And in the shadows of Mori Kage Castle, Goju Adorai makes his plans. A force older than the world itself prepares to twist all of creation to its purpose. The time has come, and at last it has the tool it needs to turn Rokugan against itself.<br/><br/>At last it has an Emperor.<br/><br/>Within The Hidden Emperor you will find the following:<br/><br/>     A complete and updated history of the War Against the Darkness, retelling the story of the Jade Edition story arc of Legend of the Five Rings. Old tales are retold for posterity, and new mysteries are revealed. <br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>     New mechanics and adventure hooks dealing with this period in history, but that can be easily adapted to a campaign set in any time period. <br/><br/><br/><br/>     A complete campaign set in the War Against the Darkness.<br/><br/><br/><br/>    Updated statistics for over forty of the most important personalities in this era. <br/><br/><br/>This book is a dual-system supplement for the Legend of the Five Rings Role-Playing Game, Second Edition, and Rokugan, the d20 Companion for Legend of the Five Rings. Players and DMs may also find it useful as a source of interesting new feats and abilities for any d20 System campaign.<br/><br/>Game Masters running the Second Edition L5R RPG will need a copy of the Legend of the Five Rings Game Master's Guide and the Player's Guide. Players need only the Player's Guide.<br/><br/>Dungeon Masters running d20 System games will need a copy of the Player's Handbook, the Dungeon Master's Guide, Oriental Adventures, and Rokugan. Players will need only a Player's Handbook.<br/><br/>"}, "50595": {"rpgartist": ["Ghislain Barbe", "Marcel Bastien", "Patrick Boutin-Gagn\u00e9", "Bobbi Burquel", "Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Fortier", "Alain Gadbois", "Pierre Ouellette", "Marc Ouellette", "David Paquin", "Alex Racine"], "rpgitemversion": ["Soft Cover"], "poll": [], "name": "Raids & Raiders", "rpgdesigner": ["Stuart Elle", "Jason M.

Rumors of its treasures led countless expeditions of heroes and treasure-seekers to scour the ruins bare of wealth and monsters.<br/>Within a few years, the dark buildings became home to bandits seeking a home base between their raiding activities. Over time the bandits and thieves began to feel themselves a community, though a true government did not form in Kratas until the outbreak of the Theran War. The legendary ork Thief, Garlthik One-Eye, controls the city through his gang, the Force of the Eye.<br/>Adventure and intrigue&mdash;both can be found here, in the dirty streets of the City of Thieves!<br/><br/>Kratas: City of Thieves offers gamemasters and players an indepth look at Barsaive&rsquo;s most disreputable city. This book provides detailed descriptions of Kratas, its gangs, and the characters who call this city home, along with new and original content for adventures in the world of Earthdawn. Requires use of the Earthdawn Player&rsquo;s and Gamemaster&rsquo;s Guides.<br/><br/>"}, "50645": {"rpgartist": ["Echo Chernik", "Aaron Zollinger"], "rpg": ["Hong Kong Action Theatre!

They care only for wealth and power, the kind that cannot be gained through honorable means. From the secret opium dens that lie hidden in the hearts of major cities to the bandit outposts that dot the countryside, explore the seedy underbelly of Rokugan that most samurai deny exists.

In the shadows, smugglers ply their trade, shadow conspiracies make plans, and criminal masterminds spin webs of power that ensnare mighty samurai. The tools needed to lure these criminal organizations to a campaign is (sic) presented here, all that a party needs to fight these shadow societies- or even join them.<br/><br/>Within the Way of the Thief you will find the following:<br/><br/><br/>     New background information for the Kolat as well as other criminal organizations, including smuggling, bandit, and pirate groups found throughout the Empire. <br/>     New setting information and NPCs for centers of criminal activity such as the City of Lies and the City of the Rich Frog. <br/>     Helpful ideas for beginning a new campaign for both magistrates who fight the criminals described in this book and parties who wish to begin a career as criminal masterminds.<br/>     New rules for Doji, Kitsuki, and Shinjo magistrate characters. <br/><br/><br/>This book is a dual-system supplement for the Legend of the Five Rings Role-Playing Game, Second Edition, and Rokugan, the d20 Companion for Legend of the Five Rings.

They are ill-equipped and pitifully few, but their courage and determination has fostered new hope for freedom in the galaxy. These are the men, women, and aliens of the Rebel Alliance.<br/><br/>This sourcebook is set between the end of Star Wars and before The Empire Strikes Back.

Nexus Editrice, who has the rights for Warhammer RPG in Italy and had already translated a couple of collection of short stories with the same setting, proposed the partwork to Hobby &amp; Work, under Games Workshop License: Nexus would do everything up to the layout, while Hobby and Work would take care of printing and distribution. <br/>The issues include short stories set in the Warhammer world, translated from English, with original GW drawings re-drawn and colored plus additional stuff by Studio Horley Parente. <br/>Central pages form an Encyclopaedia of the Known World, written by Andrea Angiolino and forming a huge sourcebook on Warhammer's setting. Sections are People, World, Religion and Magic. Each section has a collection of sub-sections devoted to single polupations, nations, religions and forms of magic. A problem was that at that time the world of the RPG was somehow different from the one of the miniature game, that in some regions evolved differently: for example, Ulthuan was an archipelago of hundreds of island in the RPG and a huge, ring-shaped island in the tabletop wargame. So the choice was to make each sub-section as a collection of legends, letters, diaries, book quotations, ballads, songgs and so on, all written by people living in the world of Warhammer - if there is any inconsistency with one of the two games, it has then to be taken as a mistake or as a lie by the character writing that piece.<br/>The first 10 issues gave also a boardgame called &quot;Warhammer adventures&quot;, again by Andrea Angiolino, featuring tactical fights between adventurers and monsters in the uinderground as on the surface of that world.

However, there is no discussion of the setting that is used in Lorien Trust games, other than in general terms where the setting affects the rules.<br/><br/>The document is laid out in order of importance of information (contrasting with earlier editions that began with character creation):<br/><br/>     Initial introduction, FAQ, and notes on event logistics.<br/>     Overarching rules, including identifying staff members by role, and the safety calls that are used during events.<br/>     Universal rules, including the combat system, the damage system, and the spell system.<br/>     Character logistics, which discusses various additional rules that a player needs to be aware of during play.<br/>     Character creation, which is left as an appendix since these rules are generally only needed in downtime between games.<br/>     Additional appendices that include reference tables and a glossary.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>The combat system uses foam and latex weapons with a solid core for m&ecirc;l&eacute;e weapons (or no core for claws and thrown weapons). Combat is intended to run at a safe speed, with clear weapon swings and damage calls, pulled blows, and no hitting with the point of a weapon (all for safety reasons). Projectile weapons such as bows and crossbows are allowed, with various additional safety constraints. Armour can be constructed of various materials including metal, so long as it is not a hazard to any player. Physical contact is not allowed except through the application of a weapon.<br/><br/>The magic system uses power cards to perform spells (with higher level spells requiring more cards to cast). Players receive a number of cards per day based on their Character Skills. Power cards are valid only individual days, so cannot be stockpiled. They are transferable between spell lists though, so a character that has access to both the Healing and Incantation spell lists (for example) can use their power cards for any one day on any combination of spells from both of those lists. All spells have clear verbal components so that nearby players can react accordingly (somatic components are very limited and there are no physical components).<br/><br/>The lore system uses sets of three digit codes to label particular identifiable items. Certain Character Skills will provide a player with a loresheet that translates these codes into meaningful information. Lore codes change each year, and loresheets are out-of-character conveniences that should not be proliferated.<br/><br/>Characters are created by spending a fixed number of points on a list of Character Skills (CS) that allow one to perform various actions. The number of CS points is fixed and does not increase with experience, so that one character cannot do all things; this encourages co-operation between players. Instead character development is achieved through a separate system of supplemental Occupational Skills (detailed in a different rulebook).<br/><br/>There are no advantages or disadvantages between the basic races that a starting character can select.<br/><br/>"}, "50910": {"boardgamedesigner": ["Michelle Duval"], "poll": [], "name": "Game Tasters: The Game of Scattergories", "playingtime": "0", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": ["Dice Rolling", "Paper-and-Pencil"], "yearpublished": "2008", "usersrated": "11", "boardgamefamily": ["Categories", "Game Tasters", "Scattergories"], "maxplayers": "4", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic525935_t.jpg", "average": "6.59091", "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["Hasbro"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic525935.jpg", "boardgameversion": ["Hasbro edition"], "maxplaytime": "0", "boardgamecategory": ["Party Game", "Word Game"], "age": "12", "minplaytime": "0", "description": "Try to match categories using words that start with the same letter.

But the amount of CS is fixed so that no individual character can do everything (this encourages player co-operation). In order to provide a mechanism for character development, there are an additional set of abilities called Occupational Skills (OS).<br/><br/>For each event that a player attends, they are awarded a number of Occupational Skill Points (OSPs). The large events run by Merlinroute Ltd themselves give more OSPs (up to 10 per event) compared to the smaller weekend events run by other groups (1 OSP per event) to encourage players to spend their money directly with Merlinroute Ltd. OSPs can then be spent in order to buy OS.<br/><br/>Each OS has a tier from 1 to 5, with a corresponding cost of 10 to 50 OSPs. The skills can be taught, which means they are learned faster; some skills require a teacher in order to be learnt. Restricted skills (including all tier 5 OS) can only be learnt through organisations such as the Guilds. Some OS form skill ladders, where you must learn a skills in turn. There are additional restrictions (such as a maximum of 12 OS per character) intended to prevent very old characters from unbalancing the system.<br/><br/>The range of abilities that OS can offer varies widely. Typical examples include (but are not limited to):<br/><br/>     Enhancements to the character's damage calls with certain weapons.<br/>     Making worn armour more effective.<br/>     Granting immunity to particular spells or effects.<br/>     Giving access to additional spell lists.<br/>     Giving the character more power cards enabling them to cast more spells.<br/>     Additional loresheets that provide specialist information exclusive to those characters with that OS.<br/>     Crafting skills that allow characters to create a limited number of items with additional powers.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>So these generally provide some degree of advantage for experienced players (that is, repeat customers) without unbalancing the game completely.

Originally distributed by Wizards' Attic as WA8802.<br/><br/>Publisher's Blurb:<br/>The foundation document for modern Dara Happa, written by Plentonius the Scribe in the Dara Happan year of 111,221 (221 S.T.) to commemorate the accession of Khordavu the Exalted, the 26th emperor of the land. It sets forth the basic mythology of Yelm and his pantheon from the beginning of Time, through the Great Darkness of the Kazkurtum, to the return of Antirius and Yelm. It also includes The Perfect Sky and The Gods Wall, two important sources for information on the deities of the Dara Happan Pantheon.<br/><br/>The Foundation Document of Dara Happa<br/><br/>This is a translation of the manuscript copy kept in the Temple of Yelm in Alkoth. The copy was made circa 111260 YS by an anonymous court scribe of the Emperor of Dara Happa. Thus it is not precisely Plentonius' &quot;original work,&quot; but a copy made 40 years later.<br/><br/>A later copyist added the marginal glosses, shown herein as footnotes. In bad editorial form, some of them are actually by me, the Author, not the Gloranthan Copyist. The original had no maps, but for clarity these were added by me, Greg.<br/><br/>Plentonius<br/><br/>Plentonius was a famous scribe in the court of Khordavu. He was most famous in his time for his description of the Gods Wall (one version contained in Appendix A herein) and for his dating system, which has remained in use in Dara Happa and most of Peloria ever since. It is used in this manuscript too, and provides the primary evidence that Plentonius was the author of this work too. Note that in the text Plentonius is not named as the author, who admits only to being Keeper of the Letters, a high-ranking scribe at court. A later source first linked this work with the name of Plentonius. Later sources ascribed supernatural powers to him, and he receives sacrifices in the temple of Arraz.<br/><br/>This is a Pre-Finished Works title, a non-professional compilation of the notes of Greg Stafford, creator of Glorantha. Thus, it is recommended for the hardcore Gloranthaphile, but not for the newcomer or casual fan.

At this scale the battles are fought at close quarters, in relatively dense terrain, be it urban or rural, from England to Iraq and all points in between.

The reading of the ground, timing and employment of all arms assets are the key to winning a battle. The player will spend more time moving units about to exploit weaknesses in the enemy&rsquo;s plan than calculation of hit factors and dice rolling.

But the possible effects that they can perform are limited by the spell lists that they have access to, and by the amount of power that they individually wield. Rituals are a more powerful type of magic that are not as limited in range and application.<br/><br/>Rituals are performed in a ritual circle: a special area that in character is a nexus of magical forces, and out of character is rigged with light, sound, and special effects systems. There is one circle at each of the large LT events run by Merlinroute Ltd, but not at any of the smaller events. Ritualists must book a slot in the circle in advance.<br/><br/>A ritual is led by one ritualist, and typically supported by a ritual team. Together they perform for ten to twenty minutes, and are then marked on their efforts. Scores are given for both entertainment value and for relevance to the effect that they are trying to produce. A combination of this score and the amount of power that the ritual team have brought to the circle determine how effective the ritual is.<br/><br/>This guide was written for the second edition of Lorien Trust Role-Playing, to provide more detail on how to perform rituals. The core rulebook doesn't cover this topic at all, only giving the rules needed to allow a player to decide at character creation whether they can perform or support rituals. This rulebook is sufficiently generic that it is still valid for the third edition of the game system, and has not been superseded.<br/><br/>The guide introduces the concept of rituals, and gives tips on how to perform them well. The rules are given from a player's point of view, so that they know what they generally need to do to succeed, but the underlying mechanics of exactly how the ritual score and power level determine the ritual effects are not disclosed. Thus experienced players that have performed many rituals are more likely to have a good idea of how to perform a successful ritual.<br/><br/>There is also an example ritual in the guide, in the form of a complete script. This gives players a much better idea of how they work in practice, and a useful idea of what is realistic.<br/><br/>"}, "50967": {"rpgdesigner": ["Ingo Ahrens", "Sebastian Bleasdale", "Michael Cisco", "Frank Heller", "Peer Kr\u00f6ger", "Matthias Oden", "Steffen Sch\u00fctte"], "rpgitemversion": ["Hard Cover"], "poll": [], "name": "Expeditionen: Ins Herz der Finsternis", "rpgartist": ["Ingo Ahrens", "Konstantyn Debus", "Thorsten Heine", "Daniel Hockmann", "Bj\u00f6rn Lensig", "Matthias Oden"], "rpgproducer": ["Frank Heller", "Jan Christoph Steines"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic525094.jpg", "usersrated": "8", "rpgsetting": ["Cthulhu Classic (1920s & 1930s)"], "average": "7.55", "statistics": [], "rpg": ["Call of Cthulhu (2nd - 6th Edition)"], "rpgpublisher": ["Pegasus Spiele"], "rpgcategory": ["Scenario / Adventure / Module", "Sourcebook (rules/options to enhance play)"], "rpggenre": ["Horror (Cthulhu Mythos)"], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic525094_t.jpg", "description": "&quot;Expeditions - Into the Heart of Darkness&quot;<br/>A german scenario book for the Cthulhu RPG revolving around expeditions the dangerous and rather unknowns spots in the world in the 1920s, with additional source/background informations.<br/><br/>From the publishers website (translated):<br/>(...) contains five scenarios leading the adventurers beyond the frontiers of civilization into regions of the exotic, undiscovered and most of all: horror...<br/><br/>An introducing essay supports players and gamemaster in the planning of expedition scenarios and depicts what man really depends on in the middle of nowhere, and does this not by extensive equipment lists, encounter charts and travel speed calculations.<br/><br/>&quot;The Heart of Darkness&quot; beats in the Belgian Congo.

But the amount of CS is fixed so that no individual character can do everything (this encourages player co-operation). In order to provide a mechanism for character development, there are an additional set of abilities called Occupational Skills (OS).<br/><br/>For each event that a player attends, they are awarded a number of Occupational Skill Points (OSPs). The large events run by Merlinroute Ltd themselves give more OSPs (up to 10 per event) compared to the smaller weekend events run by other groups (1 OSP per event) to encourage players to spend their money directly with Merlinroute Ltd. OSPs can then be spent in order to buy OS.<br/><br/>Each OS has a minimum rank that a character must have in order to learn the skill, and a cost of 10 or more OSPs. The cost varies depending on whether the skill is learnt through a Guild (cheapest), Faction, or self-taught (most expensive). Additionally the higher level OS can only be learnt through Guilds (or just through Guilds and Factions), and some have further restrictions. Some OS form skill ladders, where you must learn a skills in turn. There are additional restrictions (such as a maximum of 12 OS per character) intended to prevent very old characters from unbalancing the system.<br/><br/>The range of abilities that OS can offer varies widely. Typical examples include (but are not limited to):<br/><br/>     Enhancements to the character's damage calls with certain weapons.<br/>     Making worn armour more effective.<br/>     Granting immunity to particular spells or effects.<br/>     Giving access to additional spell lists.<br/>     Giving the character more power cards enabling them to cast more spells.<br/>     Additional loresheets that provide specialist information exclusive to those characters with that OS.<br/>     Crafting skills that allow characters to create a limited number of items with additional powers.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>So these generally provide some degree of advantage for experienced players (that is, repeat customers) without unbalancing the game completely. A starting character can still gain a comparative advantage over an experienced character in particular fields through selecting different CS.<br/><br/>"}, "50985": {"rpgartist": ["Sacha Angel Diener", "Matt Bradbury", "Kevin Childress", "David Griffith", "Jeff Himmelman", "Imaginary Friends Studio (IFS)", "Stef Kopinski", "Clint Langley", "John Moriarty", "Andrew Navaro", "Mark Raynor", "Zoe Robinson", "Brian Schomburg", "Mark E.
