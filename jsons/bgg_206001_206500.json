Hero goes on quest, hero faces obstacles, hero completes quest. Lovers fall in love, antagonist keeps lovers apart, lovers end up together. Things beyond the protagonist&rsquo;s control change, the protagonist faces adversity, the protagonist learns to adapt and achieves greatness. On that basic structure writers and storytellers throughout the ages have woven variations and created masterpieces. We keep coming back to the same foundations today for one very good reason: those structures are versatile and continue to work.<br/><br/>This book will help you to leverage basic story structure and use it to your advantage. You&rsquo;ll be able to say what you want while keeping your audience engaged. The three-act structure and its variations will be discussed in detail, along ways this structure can be expanded beyond a single story and into a series or campaign. In the end, you&rsquo;ll have new tools in your storytelling toolbox, along with the knowledge of how and when to use them in your own creative works.<br/><br/>"}, "206003": {"rpgdesigner": ["Rafael Fiadi"], "rpgitemversion": ["ZIP Archive"], "rpgseries": ["Haven Cross"], "name": "Temple of Caecus & Drunken Horse Inn Map Pack", "rpgartist": ["Rafael Fiadi"], "rpgproducer": ["Rafael Fiadi"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3128077.jpg", "usersrated": "0", "average": "0", "statistics": [], "rpg": ["5e Game System Product (D&D 5th Edition Compatible)"], "rpgpublisher": ["(Web published)"], "poll": [], "rpgcategory": ["Accessory (dice, maps, screens, cards)"], "rpggenre": ["Fantasy (High Fantasy)"], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3128077_t.jpg", "description": "Publisher's blurb:<br/><br/>Ten high quality maps, presented in various resolutions.<br/><br/>User summary:<br/><br/>The maps are distributed as a ZIP archive containing ten locations, with several map resolutions, grid or no-grid options, and (usually) two light conditions for day and night use.

Many people find it to be a useful way to get a handle on character motivation. Others find it far too vague to be an effective tool. It is literally two-dimensional and absolute; a person is either good or evil, lawful or chaotic, or a perfect balance. There is no room for subtlety or nuance in the rules as written.<br/><br/>Even different editions of games using alignment offer varying explanations of what combinations are possible, and what those mixtures mean.  In systems that otherwise provide numeric representations and statistical models for success and failure, alignment is open to interpretation. Aside from some restrictions on and prerequisites for character abilities, it's left for players and gamemasters to sort out.<br/><br/>Yet alignment remains virtually unchanged where other elements of classic fantasy roleplaying have either evolved or fallen away. The reason is because arguing about alignment can be fun. We want alignment to make sense. People like to discuss whether a celebrity, historical, or fictional character is one alignment or another. Memes are shared, online quizzes are generated, and motivational posters are created. All of which goes toward developing some meaning and practical utility.<br/><br/>This is not the definitive resource on alignment. The topic is so subjective that nothing could be. What this book presents is one possible interpretation of alignment, and a system for using it to enrich your game. It presents an alternate way to describe alignment, as a means of customizing your character's personality, goals, and beliefs. There are simple mechanics to reward characters who embody the tenets of their alignment, and penalize those who stray. If it doesn't answer all of your questions about a character's stance toward morality, you should at least find enough fodder to continue the never-ending conversation.<br/><br/>"}, "206010": {"rpgartist": ["(Uncredited)"], "rpgitemversion": ["Kindle Version", "PDF version"], "poll": [], "name": "Group Dynamics for Tabletop Roleplayers", "rpgdesigner": ["Berin Kinsman"], "rpgproducer": ["Berin Kinsman"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3128287.jpg", "usersrated": "0", "average": "0", "statistics": [], "rpg": ["Generic / Universal", "ReadWriteRoll"], "rpgpublisher": ["Dancing Lights Press"], "rpgcategory": ["Non-Game Book (but RPG Related)"], "rpggenre": ["Generic / Universal"], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3128287_t.jpg", "description": "From publisher blurb:<br/><br/>You have a game. You have people willing to play that game. Now what? There are several good resources on how to plan and run an adventure. Finding other players is as easy as conducting an internet search or dropping in at your friendly local game store. What&rsquo;s missing is a comprehensive guide to organizing a group, dealing with disparate personalities, and handling the various issues that are likely to arise.<br/><br/>Over the years I have run and played in dozens of games with all sorts of people. I&rsquo;ve played with groups with as many as 17 players, in a weekly group that held together for years. Every group that succeeded had certain things in common; all that failed shared the same set of flaws. What if we put the same level of rigor around group dynamics that we put into learning the mechanics and balancing adventures? What if our expectation that other players behave courteously and responsibly were as high as our requirement that they know their character&rsquo;s abilities and understand the system &mdash; or are at least willing to learn?<br/><br/>Most of you don&rsquo;t need to be told how to play well with others. Unfortunately, you&rsquo;ll run into people who do. For whatever reason, they never learned this particular set of social skills. Sitting down to play a game with them can be like herding cats &mdash; occasionally entertaining, but mostly frustrating. You&rsquo;ll wonder if you&rsquo;re wasting your time, and begin to think about other things you could be doing that involve less hassle. I have seen people leave groups, and quit the hobby entirely not because they didn&rsquo;t enjoy roleplaying or love the campaign they were in, but because no one knew how to coordinate a group or deal with difficult players.<br/><br/>Rather than hoping that your group comes together organically, with people magically self-organizing and good things happening by accident, you can plan. Prepping for the success of your group is as essential as knowing the rules of the game and having everything you need ready to run an adventure. With a little bit of forethought you can build a game group that runs smoothly. Then you can focus on the serious business of having fun, week after week, for months and years to come.<br/><br/>"}, "206011": {"rpgartist": ["(Uncredited)"], "rpgitemversion": ["PDF version"], "poll": [], "name": "Setting Design for Writers and Roleplayers", "rpgdesigner": ["Berin Kinsman"], "rpgproducer": ["Berin Kinsman"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3559002.jpg", "usersrated": "0", "average": "0", "statistics": [], "rpg": ["Generic / Universal"], "rpgpublisher": ["Dancing Lights Press"], "rpgcategory": ["Non-Game Book (but RPG Related)"], "rpggenre": ["Generic / Universal"], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3559002_t.jpg", "description": "From publisher blurb:<br/><br/>The term worldbuilding gets thrown around a lot by both writers and roleplayers.

While communicating to others, you have to find the right answers to a quiz or find the &quot;insider&quot; who is manipulating the discussion. The insider will do everything to hide their identity while misleading the others.<br/><br/>In more detail, players are assigned roles at random. One player is the &quot;master&quot;, and they secretly select a word from a set given in a deck of cards. (In a variant given in the rulebook, they can freely select and write down a word.) The &quot;insider&quot; player, whose role is not known to the other players, will then secretly view the word. The rest of the players are known as &quot;commons&quot;. The commons then have approximately five minutes in which to ask the master &quot;yes&quot; or &quot;no&quot;-type questions so that they can deduce the secret word.

(63 cards)<br/>2) a game that is multiplayer that you really want to play solitaire.<br/><br/>Time to play the game: Really depends on what you want to play. Expect to double the normal time for gameplay when using the system for the first time. This will shorten substantially after playing it a few times.<br/><br/>Concept:<br/><br/>The Solo System is not a game per se, rather it is a Artificial Intelligence system that provides an unpredictable opponent for your multiplayer games. With a few adjustments, this can make a wide selection of games capable of being played solitaire.<br/><br/>Short Description of the Mechanics:<br/><br/>The Solo System is heavily influenced by role-playing systems such as Mythic and The Covetous Poet's Adventure Creator, but is much streamlined to be played with board games rather than role-playing games. It only uses a deck of 63 cards to accomplish its task.<br/><br/>It works like this: You set up your game and play it the same way that you would a normal game. When it is your opponents turn, you use The Solo System to figure out how your opponent will play.  You will first flip a card and determine what personality/strategy the AI is interested this round. There is a good chance that the system will keep the same strategy as the last round. Then you will look at the board and figure out if there is a move that would match this strategy or flip more cards to give a little more direction as to what he is interested in.<br/><br/>At this point you will probably find several moves that the AI could take. Choose one and ask the game if it does take that move. Before you flip a card, determine what the probability of the AI is of taking that move: probably, probably not, or unsure. Then flip the card and determine the results.<br/><br/>Cards have multiple pieces of information on them and are divided into four different decks. One deck has 14 cards, and the other two decks have 20 cards. There are mechanisms for movement on maps, targets and objectives for its armies, selection of resources such as coal or gold, and auctions.<br/><br/>The system is not unlike playing a game two handed, but you are playing against an opponent. Plus using the card system gives you direction for how to play one of the players. This will assist when trying to play several opponents and keep track of their play style. The opponent may need handicaps to increase its challenge against you depending on how you want to play, and these rules will give you ideas as to how to implement these handicaps.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "1", "boardgameversion": ["First edition"], "name": "The Solo System", "playingtime": "240", "boardgamemechanic": ["Simulation"], "average": "7.91667", "usersrated": "12", "boardgamefamily": ["Solitaire Games", "Solitaire Print and Play Contest"], "boardgamepodcastepisode": ["1P 112 - The Solo System"]}, "206075": {"rpgartist": ["(Uncredited)"], "rpg": ["Holy Lands (1st Edition)", "Holy Lands (Light Edition)"], "statistics": [], "name": "Religious Conversion", "rpgdesigner": ["Joe Ludlum", "Roger Musson"], "rpgproducer": ["Joe Ludlum"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3129944.jpg", "usersrated": "0", "rpgitemversion": ["PDF Version"], "average": "0", "rpggenre": ["Fantasy", "Religion"], "rpgpublisher": ["Faith Quest Games"], "rpgcategory": ["Sourcebook (rules/options to enhance play)"], "poll": [], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3129944_t.jpg", "description": "From the introduction:<br/><br/>This supplement provides additional options for characters of the Cleric class specifically but can be used by all classes with Raconteur approval.

It captures the rivalries, the excitement, the back-page headlines, the stars, the emotion, humour and the occasional insanity and scandal of football both on and off the pitch.<br/><br/>The Football Game combines our love of the sport with our love of tabletop gaming. It reflects not only how football works, but also how it feels!<br/><br/>How to Play:<br/><br/>The game is played over six rounds, with one turn per Player per Round. Each Round represents about 6 weeks of a football season.<br/><br/>During setup, each Player chooses a Club and is dealt a random squad of Footballers and a Manager. The strength of your squad determines your Club&rsquo;s Class (and win conditions).<br/><br/>The transfer market is where you'll buy and sell Footballers in order to add strength and depth in your squad. You&rsquo;ll need cover too: Players may become unavailable in the course of each Match Day.<br/><br/>Every turn ends with a Match Day Roll, where coloured dice are used to reflect scoring. Even the very best Footballers won't perform every week! When selecting their match day team, Players should consider a Footballer&rsquo;s Ability, Colour, Position, and how these might affect other Footballers in the team. Each Match Day influences the league position of all clubs, so you're never left waiting for your turn.<br/><br/>You can boost your score through the use of Tactics cards played both before and after each Match Day Roll. Careful management of Tactics cards might be the difference between stealing the title for some, or avoiding relegation for others. These cards allow your players (such as the Wing Wizard, Ancient Attacker, and Incredible Sulk) to pull off elegant interceptions, lucky deflections, and wonder goals.<br/><br/>The two twelve-sided bring about the fortunes and misfortunes that can affect any club or Footballer. You&rsquo;ll experience Injuries, Knocks and over 50 events including Social Media Mishaps, Night Club Nightmares, Academy Stars, Billionaire Buyouts, Sell-On Fees and many more!<br/><br/>Victory points are scored at several stages of the season, and are awarded according to your league position and club class. Different club's have different expectations, so the winner at the end will be the club who most exceeded their fans expectations!<br/><br/>Will your Players perform? Will your risk-taking be rewarded? Will lady luck hand you a lifeline?<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": ["English first edition"], "average": "7.23333", "name": "The Football Game", "playingtime": "90", "boardgamemechanic": ["Dice Rolling", "Hand Management", "Simultaneous Action Selection", "Time Track"], "age": "8", "usersrated": "6", "boardgamefamily": ["Admin: Unreleased Games", "Crowdfunding: Kickstarter", "Sports: Football / Soccer"], "boardgamepodcastepisode": ["Cult of the New Board Game Podcast Episode 029 \u2013 Why Jam Improves Your Game", "Cult of the New Board Game Podcast Episode 030a \u2013 New Releases, News, Kickstarters", "Cult of the New Board Game Podcast Episode 030b \u2013 Essen 2016", "Cult of the New Board Game Podcast Episode 036 \u2013 Blood Rage vs Scythe", "Cult of the New Board Game Podcast Episode 040 \u2013 Airecon 4"]}, "206092": {"rpgdesigner": ["Takuji Endo", "Takeshi Kikuchi", "Kou Shigenobu", "Takehito Tanaka", "Taketoshi Tando", "\u5927\u7551\u9855 (Ken Ohata)", "\u95a2\u6839\u535a\u5bff (Sekine Hirokazu)"], "rpgitemversion": ["First Printing"], "statistics": [], "name": "Labyrinth City", "rpgartist": ["Keita Hayashi", "Tasuku Sugano", "\u307d\u307d\u308b\u3061\u3083\u3000(Poporucha)", "\u771f\u7434 (Makoto)", "\u77f3\u7530\u30d2\u30ed\u30e6\u30ad\u3000(Hiroyuki Ishida)"], "rpgproducer": ["F.E.A.R.

Indeed, much of the war beginning around 1915 was static and miserable with little hope of any decisive battle that would immediately end the war, but that was not the case in 1914.<br/><br/>The German Schlieffen Plan intended to outflank the French fortifications by moving through Belgium. The price was a British entry into the war to fulfill the international guarantee of Belgium's borders. Apart for some delay outside Liege, the German advance through France was nearly flawless in overwhelming the French &amp; Belgians in key opening exchanges which caused the BEF to avoid encirclement through a long retreat. At Villers Cotterets portrays the desperate rearguard action near Marne in which the British managed to severely wound a much larger force all while successfully withdrawing to fight another day, one of the first times the Germans had seen any kind of delay.<br/><br/>AVC portrays the desperate rearguard action nearing the end of Mons in which the British managed to severely wound a much larger force all while successfully withdrawing to fight another day. History is unclear about who really &ldquo;won&rdquo; the conflict, but you can settle it here and now, although 102 years later. AVC is a Grand Tactical game meaning units will have ranged capabilities and are rewarded for sophisticated planning towards a shared objective.<br/><br/>Players active regiments via random chit pull, maneuvering battalions on the board. The inactive player can interrupt the active player's maneuvers unleashing lead during their advance. The limits of historical doctrine &amp; command resulting in stacking/firing limits accurately reflect unit frontages and individual unit initiative. Events dropped into the activation pool can realistically dramatically change the course of the game.<br/><br/>No two games of AVC will ever be the same. The situation lends itself to a naturally competitive scenario with an adversary, but the mechanics are intuitive as to compliment solo play. Action moves quickly back and forth between the two sides, but the game also rewards careful planning. AVC recreates the excitement of the young men off to war during the guns of August with the tactical realities of early 20th century warfare without having to charge into a machine gun nest in the open.<br/><br/>Product Information:<br/>Complexity: 6 out of 10<br/>Solitaire Play &ndash; 7 out of 10<br/>Time scale: Sixteen thirty-minute turns.<br/>Map Scale: .3 miles per hex<br/>Unit Scale: Battalion, Cavalry Squadron, Company, Batteries, Brigade HQ<br/>Players: 1 good for historical play, 2 best for competitive play.<br/>Playing Time 3-5 Hours<br/><br/>"}, "206107": {"boardgamedesigner": ["Darya Rodionova"], "poll": [], "name": "Lexit", "playingtime": "30", "minplayers": "2", "yearpublished": "2016", "usersrated": "2", "maxplayers": "6", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3176566_t.jpg", "average": "3", "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["Lifestyle Boardgames Ltd"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3176566.jpg", "boardgameversion": ["English/Russian first edition"], "maxplaytime": "30", "boardgamecategory": ["Word Game"], "age": "10", "minplaytime": "25", "description": "Description from the publisher:<br/><br/>Lexit is a clever and witty word game without words!

You can integrate them into an ongoing campaign as individual points of interest, or use all the locations together as one well-developed region.<br/><br/>Drow have existed in this spider-worshipping, matriarchal, quasi-dominatrix niche for decades. There&rsquo;s literally nothing new under the sun there, so if anything touches on the drow it needs to be inspired and fresh&mdash;a reinvention. What is contained in these pages is my attempt at that intention.<br/><br/>Drow dominions are often small, usually no larger than a metropolis on the surface world. Dark elven cities come in many forms with some even carved into the sides of great crevasses. Others are in huge stalactite fields with bridges and ramps strung between the giant stone spikes. Black cities exist on the shores of dark rivers and on islands in midnight oceans. Settlements sprawl across the elevations of vast caverns and snake through tight warrenlike tunnels. They lie hidden in fungus forests and shimmer on the edges of manna lakes. In addition a dominion could simply be a powerful family living together in a hollowed out stalactite, or it may be a collection of drow dwellings all falling under the sway of the most powerful drow present. The dominion highlighted within this book is just an example of variety existing amongst the drow elves.<br/><br/>Return of the Drow - Dominions: Darkwood Enfold introduces just such a new dominion for the drow. Darkwood Enfold describes a group of drow that have evolved and diverged from the prototypical dark elf. These drow are of neutral alignment and are immersed in a culture of fey magic, ghosts, and symbolism of their Moon Goddess.<br/><br/>- Publisher's description<br/><br/>"}, "206144": {"rpgartist": ["(Uncredited)"], "rpg": ["Shadow of Ares"], "poll": [], "name": "Shadow of Ares", "rpgdesigner": ["Victor Andrade", "Chris Bennett", "Ashton McAllan"], "rpgproducer": ["Victor Andrade"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3131072.jpg", "usersrated": "0", "rpgitemversion": ["Stage 1 RTF Version", "Stage 2 RTF Version", "Stage 3 ASCII Version"], "average": "0", "statistics": [], "rpggenre": ["Science Fiction (Space Opera)"], "rpgpublisher": ["(Web published)"], "rpgcategory": ["Core Rules (min needed to play)"], "rpgseries": ["#Threeforged RPG Design Challenge 2015"], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3131072_t.jpg", "description": "From the introduction:<br/><br/>Shadows of Ares is a game where the players tell a collective story.<br/><br/>You are the crew of a ship cobbled together from spare parts.

The game ends when no more plays are possible.<br/><br/>Squabble is usually played with the lettered tiles from a Scrabble or Bananagrams set.<br/><br/>"}, "206204": {"poll": [], "name": "Dynatech", "videogamemode": ["Local Multiplayer", "Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["Amiga+ edition", "DOS edition"], "average": "0", "videogametheme": ["Business/Construction", "Space"], "usersrated": "0", "videogamedeveloper": ["Magic Bytes"], "videogamegenre": ["Strategy"], "videogameplatform": ["Amiga", "DOS"], "statistics": [], "videogamepublisher": ["Magic Bytes"], "videogamecompilation": ["Kind of Magic 4"], "description": "User Summary<br/>Dynatech - a company greated to secure the demands of the resource depleated Earth by discovery and development of distant systems.<br/>As a businessman you want a piece of this profit!

This is in direct contrast with druids and shamans, who pay deference to an oversoul of sorts built from these primal building blocks. A primordial dancer's patron has no consciousness, no mind, and no real rhyme or reason to its ends. It simply is. By mimicking the motions and vibrations used by these primal forces to weave themselves together and create the fabric of the world, a primordial dancer can weave her own reality in a comparatively microscopic sense, at least for the duration of her cantering.<br/><br/>Gameplay<br/><br/>Difficulty to Play (1-5): 3<br/><br/>Difficulty to Build (1-5): 2<br/><br/>Role: Primal magic bard<br/><br/>Playstyle: With less of a support role than the bard while inhabiting the same power level design space, the primordial dancer mixes six-level casting with combo play in the form of dances, which can eventually be combined.<br/><br/>A primordial dancer's primary power is that of the dance. While somewhat like a bard's performance in the way it is presented, dances tend to be significantly more offensive. Each dance grants a passive ability while performed, as well as access to three active abilities. One of these actives is much like a cantrip, while the other two suck away at that dance's remaining duration to fire it off. Each dance has its own duration pool and high level primordial dancers can perform up to three of them at once. This, combined with druid spells on a bardic spell progression, allows for the riotous combination of spell effects to clear a combat in a hurry.<br/><br/>Product Features<br/><br/><br/>    The primordial dancer base class<br/>    Two archetypes: the primalist and the weaver<br/>    Over 10 feats<br/>    36 dances in 6 subtypes, each with a passive and three active abilities, for a total of 144 abilities<br/>    Of the 36 dances, 6 are &quot;tangos&quot;, which grant benefit to you and a chosen ally<br/><br/><br/>"}, "206390": {"poll": [], "name": "The Name's the Same", "playingtime": "30", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": ["Paper-and-Pencil"], "yearpublished": "0", "usersrated": "0", "maxplayers": "12", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3136363_t.jpg", "average": "0", "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["Universal Publications Ltd"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3136363.jpg", "boardgameversion": ["First edition"], "maxplaytime": "30", "boardgamecategory": ["Deduction", "Party Game", "Word Game"], "age": "0", "minplaytime": "20", "description": "This party game from UPL is more challenging than most.

Each player takes the role of a Chef and competes for the greatest prestige. To achieve the goal they prepare gourmet dishes, for which they need to acquire all the necessary ingredients and seasonings in an exciting rivalry for the best prices.<br/><br/>With all the groceries and additional helpful appliances ready Chefs must hurry to cope with incoming orders. Cooking is represented by joyful dice rolling to which you can apply certain modifiers. Thanks to the &quot;Action Deck&quot; cards each Chef can use instant bonuses to boost their own or meddle in the opponents dishes with unpleasant incidents. Some of these cards are simple improvements for your own kitchen. However you can also invest these cards for future profit. The chef who gathers the most prestige points wins.<br/><br/>The game last 2 to 4 rounds, each divided into three phases. <br/>Phase 1 - Preparation - each player gets 5 randomly selected Action Cards (75 available), some guaranteed income and chooses 3 to 5 menu cards (60 available). Each menu card represents a dish which becomes part of your restaurant menu. <br/>Phase 2 - Groceries/Shopping - the players place their bids and the highest bidder gets to start the shopping. At this stage players acquire ingredients (represented by 90 colored d6 dice) necessary to prepare the dishes and special seasoning (15 cards), which are laid out on the market board. <br/>Phase 3 - the players use a small plastic frying pan as a dice rolling tray and the active player marker. One by one the players roll the dice representing different ingredients and try to achieve success. Incoming orders are being managed in the cooking table placed on the players board. If a player manages to successfully finish the dish he/she is rewarded with some money and most importantly prestige (much higher if one uses the spices).<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": ["Polish first edition"], "average": "6.91176", "name": "TOP Kitchen", "playingtime": "70", "boardgamemechanic": ["Auction/Bidding", "Dice Rolling", "Hand Management"], "age": "10", "usersrated": "51", "boardgamesubdomain": ["Family Games"], "boardgamefamily": ["Crowdfunding: Wspieram", "Food / Cooking"]}, "206452": {"rpgartist": ["Claudio Casini", "Storn Cook", "Juan Diego Dianderas", "Jack Holliday", "Eric Lofgren", "Gordon Napier", "Joe Shawcross"], "rpg": ["Pathfinder System Compatible Product"], "poll": [], "name": "Akashic Mysteries", "rpgdesigner": ["Jacob Karpel", "Andreas R\u00f6nnqvist", "Michael Sayre", "Andrew Stoeckle"], "rpgproducer": ["Forrest Heck", "Levi Jones", "Jeremy Smith"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3134690.jpg", "usersrated": "0", "rpgitemversion": ["PDF version"], "average": "0", "statistics": [], "rpggenre": ["Culture (Asian / Far Eastern)", "Fantasy (High Fantasy)"], "rpgpublisher": ["Dreamscarred Press"], "rpgcategory": ["Sourcebook (rules/options to enhance play)"], "rpgseries": ["Akashic Mysteries"], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3134690_t.jpg", "description": "From publisher blurb:<br/><br/>Harness a new and different source of magical power!<br/><br/>Drawn from a more primal magical force that exists everywhere, akasha is a deep well of magic from which those who hold the right knowledge, can draw almost limitless power.

The myth of Teutonic invulnerability - already wobbly after the Battle on the Ice - was shattered by the combined might of Poland, Lithuania, and their allies. Though both sides fielded some infantry, and the Teutonic Order some cannon, cavalry predominated. The sudden withdrawal of the Lithuanian forces left the Poles vulnerable, and their dramatic re-entry onto the battlefield may have been decisive in turning the tide against the Germans. Poland is still immensely proud of their victory over six hundred years later, and the Germans were still feeling sore about it into the twentieth century.<br/><br/>This first title in the revamped SHIELDS &amp; SWORDS II series lets two players refight this dynamic and exciting battle. With lots of horsies on both sides, it's a tense contest of maneuver and tempo. The Teutonic Player must protect his camp at all costs, and use every opportunity to slow the enemy's headlong advance. But blocking him here can open a hole over there - knowing where and when to leave a hole is key. His opponent must decide when to remove the Lithuanians from the battlefield, and when to bring them back on - there's a right time and wrong time for both, but in each case it's heavily contextual and dependent on the current game state, on his own strategy, and on his opponent's. The result is an unusually replayable medieval battle game that you, your friends, and your family can revisit again and again.<br/><br/>The SHIELDS &amp; SWORDS II series builds on, and improves, the Shields &amp; Swords series of games (We Happy Few, Stamford Bridge, A Hill Near Hastings, and Our Royal Bones), with a greater variety of unit types, revised suppression rules, and a new D8-based CRT.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": ["First edition"], "age": "14", "name": "The Grunwald Swords", "playingtime": "120", "boardgamemechanic": ["Dice Rolling", "Hex-and-Counter"], "average": "7.69231", "usersrated": "13", "boardgamefamily": ["Shields & Swords II"]}, "206465": {"boardgamedesigner": ["Stephan Riedel"], "average": "7.14286", "poll": [], "name": "Gads Hill 1874: 1.

Meanwhile, King William III of England sat easier on his new throne than he ever had before. With the Spanish succession crisis unresolved and looming, there were no illusions that the new century would be a quiet one. But neither France nor England could have anticipated the tumult of the years to come: a Second Hundred Years&rsquo; War, during which these two tenacious adversaries would compete fiercely and proudly along every axis of human achievement. On battlefields from India to Canada to the Caribbean Sea their armies and fleets would clash; in the salons of Paris and the coffee-houses of London the modern world&rsquo;s politics and economics would be born; and finally a revolution would rock the foundations of society &ndash; a revolution that could have ended not in blood and terror but in a triumph of democracy and liberty that might have transformed the world beyond imagining.<br/><br/>Imperial Struggle is a two-player game depicting the 18th-century rivalry between France and Britain. It begins in 1697, as the two realms wait warily for the King of Spain to name an heir, and ends in 1789, when a new order brought down the Bastille. The game is not merely about war: both France and Britain must build the foundations of colonial wealth, deal with the other nations of Europe, and compete for glory across the span of human endeavor.<br/><br/>Imperial Struggle covers almost 100 years of history and four major wars. Yet it remains a low-complexity game, playable in a short evening. It aims to honor its spiritual ancestor, Twilight Struggle, by pushing further in the direction of simple rules and playable systems, while maintaining global scope and historical sweep in the scope of a single evening. In peace turns, players build their economic interests and alliances, and take advantage of historical events represented by Event cards. They must choose their investments wisely, but also with an eye to denying these opportunities to their opponent. In war turns, each theater can bring great rewards of conquest and prestige&hellip; but territorial gains can disappear at the treaty table. At the end of the century, will the British rule an empire on which the sun never sets? Or will France light the way for the world, as the superpower of the Sun King&rsquo;s dreams or the republic of Lafayette&rsquo;s?<br/><br/>"}, "206481": {"rpgartist": ["Mark Ahmed", "Matthew Finch"], "rpg": ["Old School Reference and Index Compilation (OSRIC)"], "statistics": [], "name": "Old School Reference and Index Compilation (OSRIC) v0.03", "rpgdesigner": ["Matthew Finch", "Stuart Marshall"], "rpgproducer": ["James Boney", "Trent Foster", "Jeremy Goehring", "Allan T.

One of the cases features Apollo defending Trucy Wright, Phoenix's adoptive daughter.<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;[en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phoenix_Wright%3A_Ace_Attorney_%E2%88%92_Spirit_of_Justice Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney &minus; Spirit of Justice]&quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "206494": {"poll": [], "name": "Zombicide Compendium 2", "playingtime": "60", "minplayers": "1", "boardgamemechanic": ["Action Point Allowance System", "Co-operative Play", "Dice Rolling", "Hand Management", "Modular Board", "Variable Player Powers"], "yearpublished": "2016", "boardgameexpansion": [], "usersrated": "16", "boardgamefamily": ["Zombicide"], "maxplayers": "6", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3141634_t.png", "average": "7.4375", "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["Guillotine Games"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3141634.png", "boardgameversion": ["First edition"], "maxplaytime": "60", "boardgamecategory": ["Expansion for Base-game", "Horror", "Miniatures", "Zombies"], "age": "13", "minplaytime": "60", "description": "Description from the publisher:<br/><br/>Zombicide&rsquo;s Compendium #2 is a 112-page book entirely devoted to your favorite game!

Each Lord has brought Seven Knights, all of whom have, for whatever reason, decided to make some poor decisions the night before the battle. All of these knights have found themselves in one of three places: The Tavern, The Inn, and the Armory. The Lords, having heard of the shenanigans going on throughout the castle, have dispatched messengers to each of their seven knights, instructing them to finish up whatever they are doing, and return to the barracks at once. To make things interesting, the Lords have offered handsome rewards to the knights who return best prepared for the ensuing battle.<br/><br/>The race is on for the Knights to return to their Lord's Barracks, ready for battle.<br/><br/>Game Play:<br/><br/>Novice Knights is a Victory Point game, kind of like Settlers Of Catan. The goal is to gain 17 Victory Points in the 4 player variant, and 19 Victory Points in the 2 player variant.<br/>The game play itself consists of three areas: The Inn, The Tavern, and The Armory, each with its own unique game mechanics and ways to earn Victory Points.<br/><br/>The Tarvern is a simple &quot;Roll the Dice and Advance&quot; board game, kind of like Chutes and Ladders. There are separate symmetrical paths for each player to follow, with danger along the way. For each Knight that successfully navigates his way out of The Tavern, the player earns Victory Points.<br/><br/>The Inn is a basic tile choosing/flipping game, like a simpler version of Carcassonne. Players select tiles without knowing what is in store for them on the other side. Both danger and glory await behind The Inn's tiles.<br/><br/>The final section, The Armory, holds the most dangerous and challenging section of the game. This Card-Based section, reminiscent of Munchkin offers the Knights the opportunity to suit up before the battle. The only problem is, several Dragons have made their home in The Armory, and it's dangerous to go alone (Take this!).<br/><br/>"}}
