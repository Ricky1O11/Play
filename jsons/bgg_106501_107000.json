(\u30a8\u30b9\u30fb\u30c6\u30a3\u30fc\u30fb\u30b8\u30fc) is a vertical scrolling shoot 'em up video game originally released on the arcades in 1991 by Athena, and Tecmo then later ported for the Super Nintendo. The player takes control of a high-tech jet, the &quot;Strike Gunner&quot; of the title, and faces wave after wave of enemies, ranging from helicopters, jets, tanks and airships, among others.<br/><br/>The player goes through various levels and stages, usually based around certain environmental elements such as snow or desert, and faces numerous types of enemies. The levels feature wave after wave of normal enemies ranging from helicopters to turrets that usually only require one or two hits to destroy. At various points in each level, the player faces a boss vehicle, such as a giant airship or an enormous desert tank. At certain points, a stealth bomber (or in later levels, a space shuttle or capsule) will appear to airdrop the player laser power-ups, recharge special weapons, or give a speed boost.<br/><br/>Using the Strike Gunner, the player is armed with a dual red laser weapon that can be upgraded several times to a more powerful blue laser. In addition to this weapon, the player chooses a second, more powerful &quot;special weapon&quot; with a limited charge before they begin the mission. There are 15 advanced weapons to pick from such as the devastating MegaBeam Cannon or AntiAir Mines (see below for a complete list). This allows for a strategic approach to the game because certain weapons are more effective on certain missions. The &quot;special weapon&quot; has various limitations, depending on which one is being used; for example, the MegaBeam Cannon is extremely powerful, but only lasts less five seconds and can only be used once per charge.<br/><br/>The game supports two players as well, with two Strike Gunners (Player 1 is Jane, red, and Player 2 is Mark, blue) facing the same missions as single player. This adds another layer of strategy to the game because each player can choose their own &quot;special weapons&quot; and utilize a deadly combination of timed special attacks. Players can link their aircraft in two different ways by pressing the X or Y button.<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;Strike Gunner S.T.G.&quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "106505": {"videogame": ["Tecmo Classic Arcade"], "poll": [], "name": "Swimmer", "videogamemode": ["Hotseat", "Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["Arcade edition"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1551734.png", "videogametheme": ["Other"], "usersrated": "0", "videogamedeveloper": ["Tecmo, Ltd."], "videogamegenre": ["Action"], "videogameplatform": ["Arcade"], "average": "0", "statistics": [], "videogamepublisher": ["Centuri"], "videogamecompilation": ["Tecmo Classic Arcade"], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1551734_t.png", "description": "Swimmer is an arcade game developed in 1982 by Tehkan (now known as Tecmo) and published by Centuri.

But before he can meet this challenge, he must defeat Wild Fang's group of evil soldiers.<br/><br/>Using the &quot;jump and attack&quot; maneuver, Tecmo Knight can bound onto an enemy's shoulders and pummel him into submission. Pressing the &quot;change&quot; button allows Tecmo Knight to call on 'Tiger' or 'Smokeman.' While riding the tiger, Tecmo Knight has the use of his deadly spiked ball and chain. With 'Smokeman', Tecmo Knight can use his extra strength and steel-like arms to defeat his enemies more quickly. When collecting the special dragon skull that randomly appears after defeating an enemy, the Tecmo Knight will summon the most powerful creature to ride on in the game: the Flying Dragon. One breath of the Flying Dragon kills any monster in the game instantly, including the stage-end bosses.<br/><br/>Sometimes, if the Tecmo Knight runs low on life, a blow by a weak monster can transform him into a tiny human form, which has a very weak short-ranged attack. It is extremely hard for him to survive in this form. All bosses in the game appear in &quot;pairs&quot; making it harder for a single player to corner them. The only exception is the last boss.

Between 1987 and 2000, TSR, Inc. and Wizards of the Coast released an enormous volume of game material for the Forgotten Realms under the aegis of the 1st and 2nd Editions of Advanced Dungeons &amp; Dragons. In 2000, Wizards of the Coast updated the venerable Dungeons &amp; Dragons game, with the release of 3rd Edition or &quot;3E.&quot; In 2001, Wizards of the Coast updated the Forgotten Realms campaign setting to 3rd Edition as well.<br/>In the opinion of the authors, the introduction of 3rd Edition is a welcome addition to the ever-growing Forgotten Realms, for the system's flexibility allows game designers to better represent the endless variety of life that dwells in the Forgotten Realms. However, the downside of the new version of the game is that, given the volume of game material produced under the banner of earlier editions, Wizards of the Coast will never be able to update all of it to the new system. This discordance is very unfortunate for the Dungeon Master running a campaign set in the Forgotten Realms, for it is the vast quantity of Realmslore that makes Abeir-Toril feel like a living, breathing world.<br/>As a first step towards addressing this gap, the authors are releasing a bestiary of over 100 monsters native to the Forgotten Realms from their own personal files. Some of the creatures detailed are new, while most are updated from earlier editions of the Forgotten Realms. Many of these monsters were updated or created for the authors' own campaigns, as part of half-finished article submissions, or landed on the cutting room floor during the editing of a game product. As this project came together by happenstance and not design, the selection of monsters is admittedly haphazard. Many of the monsters included herein are minor species unlikely to ever get written up in an official Forgotten Realms product, but crucial nonetheless to making a Forgotten Realms campaign feel &ldquo;complete.&rdquo; Future volumes of this bestiary (should they come to fruition) will hopefully contain a more varied range of monsters.<br/>Errors, including errors of attribution and calculation, will be corrected as needed in future versions of this file.

Each group developed their own house rules and special hands.<br/><br/>In 1937 the National Mah Jongg league standardized and streamlined the scoring system. Elements like Jokers and the Charleston which were part of various card games found their way into the game. Each year a Scoring Card of hands and rule changes is released. In 1999 the American Mah Jongg Association published its own scoring card each year and sponsors cruises and special events.<br/><br/>American Mah Jongg is a rummylike game for four players.

It was later ported to the PlayStation game console, being released on December 11, 1997; in 2009, it has been also made available as downloadable content in the Playstation Store, for the PlayStation 3 and the PSP. Both the original arcade version and the PS version were released in Japan only, and the downloadable version for PS3 and PSP remains in Japanese language.<br/><br/>Angel Eyes featured an all-female character roster, in the same way as other fighting games with all-female rosters like Metal &amp; Lace: Battle of the Robo Babes, Variable Geo, Seifuku Densetsu Pretty Fighter, Arcana Heart and Asuka 120%. In a similar way to Capcom's Justice Gakuen series, most of the characters were teenage students fighting for the honor of their school and to earn the right of becoming the Great Angel. The game sported very high-quality, manga-styled character artwork, vigorous animation and attractive backgrounds. Contributing to the game's uniqueness, its visuals combined two-dimensional and three-dimensional graphics. Angel Eyes has remained mostly in obscurity in the West, due to not being released outside Japan. In Japan however, it gained a moderate success and following, and is still being used in tournaments there.<br/><br/>The game's storyline takes place in Japan. The substance of an angel from heaven was sent to Earth to incarnate in a human. However, there are eight girls holding the potential to become the host of the angel's substance. Therefore, who is worthy of inheriting the substance is to be she who proves herself the strongest in battle.<br/><br/>T\u014dkidensh\u014d Angel Eyes was as most fighting games of its day, a two-dimensional and sprite-based (although some of the characters were three-dimensional models, that interacted with the hand-drawn, sprite based characters in a two-dimensional environment), one-on-one fighting game, and the objective for the player was to advance by defeating the opponent by winning two rounds out of three in competitive matches.<br/><br/>Following the traditional template of fighting games, the characters had at their disposal and arsenal of normal martial arts moves varied by the characters' posture, complemented by special moves endowed with additional power or abilities. The game also featured certain gameplay mechanics that although by today standards are commonplace, were rather unique and innovative back at the time of its release, such as a mid-air dash, mid-air suspension, mid-air chase capabilities, a homing jump, high jump, and a special ability trigger called Angel Synchro.<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;T\u014dkidensh\u014d Angel Eyes&quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "106600": {"poll": [], "name": "Tsuppari \u014czum\u014d: Risshin Shusse Hen", "videogamemode": ["Local Multiplayer", "Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["Japanese Super Famicom edition"], "average": "0", "videogameseries": ["Tsuppari \u014czum\u014d"], "videogametheme": ["Sports - Wrestling"], "usersrated": "0", "videogamedeveloper": ["Tecmo, Ltd."], "videogamegenre": ["Sports"], "videogameplatform": ["SNES"], "statistics": [], "videogamepublisher": ["Tecmo, Ltd."], "description": "Tsuppari \u014czum\u014d: Risshin Shusse Hen (\u3064\u3063\u3071\u308a\u5927\u76f8\u64b2 \u7acb\u8eab\u51fa\u4e16\u7de8, &quot;Shoving Sumo: Success in Career&quot;) is a sumo video game developed and published by Tecmo for the Super Famicom (SNES), which was released exclusively in Japan in 1993.<br/><br/>It is a port/sequel to Tsuppari \u014czum\u014d for the Family Computer (NES).<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;Tsuppari \u014czum\u014d: Risshin Shusse Hen,&quot; available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "106602": {"boardgamedesigner": ["Forrest-Pruzan Creative"], "poll": [], "name": "Where Is Sock Monkey Board Game", "playingtime": "0", "minplayers": "0", "yearpublished": "0", "usersrated": "17", "boardgamefamily": ["Animals: Apes / Monkeys", "Characters: Lalaloopsy", "Doll Games"], "maxplayers": "0", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1199030_t.jpg", "average": "5.22059", "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["Cardinal"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1199030.jpg", "boardgameversion": ["Lalaloopsy edition", "Sock Monkey edition"], "maxplaytime": "0", "boardgamecategory": ["Children's Game", "Deduction"], "age": "0", "minplaytime": "0", "description": "Can you find him?

This choice roughly corresponds to a difficulty selection - Trill is Normal, Cela is Hard and Chilly is Very Hard. Once a story cutscene has introduced the song to be performed in the next act, the game moves into a practice session to teach the player the movements necessary to successfully pull off the performance. Movements are accomplished by following the on-screen markers using the PS2's analog sticks to mimic the motions of arms and legs throughout a dance; if a character on the screen is waving their right arm, the movement is likely accomplished by rolling the right analog stick like a waving arm.<br/><br/>For the practice session, the song can either be learned in its entirety, or in portions. In the original Japanese release, songs had to be successfully learned in parts, and then as the entire number before moving on. The US release made this process much simpler by allowing the player to keep the markers present throughout the entire game; in the Japanese version, these would progressively be taken away, meaning the player had to commit the dances to memory, making the practice session much more necessary. In either version, the game contains a total of twelve songs that can be played in &quot;Club Tecmo&quot; mode (&quot;Club Afro&quot; in the Japanese version) with up to three players by using a PS2 multitap.

The game was ported to the Wii Virtual Console in Japan on June 2, 2009.<br/><br/>In Hopping Mappy players control the Micro Police mouse, Mappy, as he bounces on a pogo stick to run circles around pink cats, called Meowkies, which patrol either vertically or horizontally. There's also Nyamco, a cat who patrols in a zigzag pattern, but he needs to take occasional breaks. There are eight treasures the player must grab to complete a level, except on the bonus level where the player will just want to grab all the balloons he can. The main intrigue here is getting past a blockade of Meowkies. What is the best way to sneak by?<br/><br/>The player's controls are really simple: he can bounce in any of the four directions, the only places he can land are the centres of the checkerboard squares (making for very few locations overall), and he will move at the same speed as the cats. If the player pushes the accelerator button and runs around, he will go twice as fast. This is not always good - he can run into a bad guy, or it is tougher to turn.<br/><br/>Regarding turning, the player may want to do this in advance, just after he started jumping onto the square he wants to land on, if he is running away from Meowkies or trying to reach a square with a treasure first. It will ensure no time is lost. But if the player is trailing then obviously he will want to slow down.<br/><br/>There's another case where the player will want to slow down.

Assault's main draw was its innovative controls and perspective.<br/><br/>The tank is controlled by two four-way joysticks. The standard movements, such as &quot;forward&quot; and &quot;turn left&quot;, are executed in the same manner as with other tank games, such as Battlezone (i.e. push both joysticks away for &quot;forward&quot;, pull the left joystick towards and push the right joystick away for &quot;turn left&quot;). But since the joysticks were four-way, two other moves could be executed. Pushing both joysticks away from one another (i.e. the left to the left and the right to the right) caused the tank to rear up towards its back end for a moment. When in this position, the player could fire a lethal nuclear blast instead of the standard shots when in the normal position. The tank returned to normal driving by pressing the joysticks back together, or by waiting a few seconds. If both joysticks were pushed right or left, the tank would roll (or strafe) to that direction.<br/><br/>Another innovation with this game was the perspective. While the overhead perspective was not new, the game kept the player's tank centered in the screen while the playfield rotated about the player's tank. Presented this way, the tank felt more maneuverable and lifelike.<br/><br/>One additional innovation was the way the tank entered and left the battlefield. The tank was airdropped from above, but instead of the tank falling from the sky, the battlefield appeared to come up towards the tank. When a level was completed, the tank would raise above the surface and then drop through a hatch in the ground. These methods of entering and leaving reinforced the player-tank centric approach of the game.<br/><br/>The player battles 11 waves of enemy forces. After the final level, the player is rewarded with a list of schematics of the player's tank, and a final screen stating &quot;Thanks for your play&quot;.<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;Assault (1988 video game)&quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "106644": {"rpgartist": ["Niklas Brandt", "Richard Grzela", "Marcus J.

It is largely based on the movie of the same name. The Japanese version of the game was distributed by Capcom internationally. The game closely follows the plot of Toy Story, with a few minor differences. The game was followed by a sequel based on the second film.<br/><br/>Players control Woody through 17 stages (18 for the Genesis version) that encompass the entire plot of the film. Several obstacles lie between the player and the goal of each level, not least of which is a wide assortment of enemies. Woody is equipped with a pullstring whip, which will temporarily &quot;tie up&quot; opponents, letting Woody pass by unharmed. It cannot, however, kill enemies (with the lone exception of Nightmare Buzz, the only boss in the game to be permanently defeated through the whip). This whip can also latch onto certain hooks, letting Woody swing above perilous terrain (similar to Earthworm Jim and its whip mechanics).<br/><br/>The game occasionally changes genres for a stage. Players control R.C. in two stages: one in which Woody knocks Buzz out a window, the other in which they both race back to the moving truck. Both play largely the same; the game takes an overhead view of the level, giving the players basic acceleration, braking and steering, and tasking players with reaching the end of the stage while not running out of batteries (which drain constantly, but can be replenished by bumping them out of Buzz in the former stage, and merely finding them on the ground in the latter). The Genesis version also has an exclusive level in which Woody rides R.C.'s back while rushing back to Sid's house to fetch Buzz; this stage plays very similar to OutRun, but has the same condition of maintaining a battery level. Lastly, one stage takes place in a first-person maze similar to Wolfenstein 3D, in which Woody must find alien squeak toys lost inside the claw machine and return them to the play area, where the rest of the alien toys reside, all within a time limit.<br/><br/>1&ordm; - That Old Army Game<br/>2&ordm; - Red Alert!<br/>3&ordm; - Ego Check<br/>4&ordm; - Nightmare Buzz<br/>5&ordm; - A Buzz Clip<br/>6&ordm; - Revenge of the Toys<br/>7&ordm; - Run Rex, Run!<br/>8&ordm; - Buzz Battle<br/>9&ordm; - Food and Drink<br/>10&ordm; - Inside the Claw Machine<br/>11&ordm; - Really Inside the Claw Machine (not on the PC version)<br/>12&ordm; - The Claw!<br/>13&ordm; - Sid's Workbench<br/>14&ordm; - Battle of the Mutant Toys<br/>15&ordm; - Roller Bob<br/>16&ordm; - Day-Toy-Na (only in the Sega Genesis and PC versions)<br/>17&ordm; - Light My Fire (16&ordm; in the SNES version)<br/>18&deg; - Rocket Man (17&ordm; in the SNES version)<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;Toy Story (video game)&quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "106662": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1102960.jpg", "boardgameimplementation": ["Power Grid"], "poll": [], "boardgamedesigner": ["Friedemann Friese"], "statistics": [], "yearpublished": "2011", "maxplayers": "6", "boardgameartist": ["Fr\u00e9deric Bertrand", "Lars-Arne \"Maura\" Kalusky", "Maren Rache"], "boardgamepublisher": ["2F-Spiele", "999 Games", "Albi", "Edge Entertainment", "Filosofia \u00c9ditions", "Rio Grande Games"], "maxplaytime": "60", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1102960_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "60", "boardgamecategory": ["Animals", "Economic", "Prehistoric"], "boardgamehonor": ["2012 Nederlandse Spellenprijs Nominee"], "description": "In 2001, 2F-Spiele published the original Funkenschlag.<br/><br/>In 2011, it is time to look back...a long time back!

As a clan leader you decide on the well-being of your clan during the Stone Age. You need to develop new hunting technologies and get new knowledge - to successfully hunt food or to learn to control fire. With the help of these skills, you will harvest enough food to feed your clan and spread it far enough to reach new hunting areas.<br/><br/>In a game of The First Sparks you are always confronted with many decisions: Which technology cards offer you the biggest advantages? When is the right time to spread your clan on the game board? Which hunting areas will grant the most food? Reaching new hunting areas or trying to secure parts of the game board for your own clan are important factors for your strategy. Empty spaces are cheaper for you to settle compared to spaces in which other clans are already settled. If you are the first to increase your clan size to 13 clan members, you win The First Sparks.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": ["Czech/Slovak first edition", "Dutch first edition", "English first edition", "French first edition", "German first edition", "Spanish first edition"], "average": "6.8847", "name": "Power Grid: The First Sparks", "playingtime": "60", "boardgamemechanic": ["Area Movement", "Card Drafting", "Modular Board", "Route/Network Building"], "age": "12", "boardgameexpansion": ["131458"], "usersrated": "2985", "boardgamesubdomain": ["Strategy Games"], "boardgamefamily": ["Power Grid"], "boardgamepodcastepisode": ["Carnagecast 38: Unity Games XIX", "Carnagecast Extrasode 5: A Dark and Stormy Night", "Episode 11: War, Cavemen and Hula Girls", "Episode 20: The Settlers of Catan/Time Management", "Essen Special Second Podcast Episode", "Low Player Count - Ep 13 - Luck in Games", "Ludology Episode 51 - 50 for 50, Part 2", "Podcast #050 - Essen 2011 parte 3", "Power Grid: The First Sparks", "Session Impressions: Power Grid: The First Sparks", "Wooden Cubes &amp; Iron Soldiers: \u201cViking and Mouse Attack\u2026\u201d Episode 13"]}, "106663": {"poll": [], "name": "Finest Hour", "videogamemode": ["Local Multiplayer", "Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["Arcade edition", "Wii Virtual Console edition (Arcade)"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1554495.png", "videogametheme": ["Science Fiction"], "usersrated": "0", "videogamedeveloper": ["Namco Ltd."], "videogamegenre": ["Action"], "videogameplatform": ["Arcade", "Wii"], "average": "0", "statistics": [], "videogamepublisher": ["Namco Bandai Games Inc.", "Namco Ltd."], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1554495_t.png", "description": "Finest Hour (\u30d5\u30a1\u30a4\u30cd\u30b9\u30c8\u30a2\u30ef\u30fc) is a run and gun arcade game that was released by Namco in 1989 and re-released for the Wii Virtual Console on August 25, 2009 only in Japan.<br/><br/>The gameplay includes the player strapped inside an assault mech, equipped with laser beams, jump-jets and auto-targeting systems in order to destroy enemy forces.<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;Finest Hour&quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "106664": {"poll": [], "name": "M\u00e4rchen Maze", "videogamemode": ["Local Multiplayer", "Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["Arcade edition", "Japanese TurboGrafx-16 edition", "Wii Virtual Console edition (Arcade)"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1575258.png", "videogametheme": ["Cute Fantasy"], "videogamegenre": ["Action", "Platform"], "videogamedeveloper": ["Namco Ltd."], "videogamefranchise": ["Alice in Wonderland"], "videogameplatform": ["Arcade", "TurboGrafx-16", "Wii"], "usersrated": "1", "average": "7", "statistics": [], "videogamepublisher": ["Namco Bandai Games Inc.", "Namco Ltd."], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1575258_t.png", "description": "M&auml;rchen Maze (\u30e1\u30eb\u30d8\u30f3\u30e1\u30a4\u30ba?) is an arcade game that was released by Namco in 1988.

Each successful design yields a higher security clearance and a larger budget, ultimately resulting in an OMEGA clearance and an unlimited budget.

These commands permit control of various aspects of the tank, and also allows teams of tanks to communicate and coordinate actions. While commands exist that enable a range of control over the tank, successful designs tend to be automated.

It was the first 16-bit arcade game Namco ever created. It is a curious but challenging game where the player tries to harvest little mushrooms (Mushlins) while avoiding various enemies.<br/><br/>At first glance, the gameplay resembles Taito's Qix. You control two &quot;arrows&quot;, one red (Libble) and one blue (Rabble), with a line strung between them. The object is to wrap the line around poles and surround mushrooms or enemies with the line. You can either close the loops yourself (worth more points for the mushrooms) or move both arrows to the same edge of the screen. You clear a &quot;season&quot; when you harvest all the mushrooms. Along the way, various enemies will appear to try to stop you. The most common are four hooded little critters (Hobblins) that start each season in the corners. If you catch them in a loop, you can pen them in the top of the screen for a while. Other critters such as fireballs, sparks, and demons may also appear. These can be destroyed by closing a loop around them. Sometimes, scissors-like enemies appear, and if they cross your line, they cut it. If your line is ever cut by scissors or demons, a new one is instantly made: directly between the two arrows.<br/><br/>Every so often when you close a line, a detector goes off indicating that the area you closed off has a treasure chest somewhere. To actually uncover the chest, you must surround a small enough area to cover just the chest and no other possible hiding places. The game guides you along that step, first by challenging you to uncover a chest in the beginning of the game and then by revealing the locations of the chests in the first two stages. When you actually uncover a chest, six bonus creatures will also pop out and make for the edges. Corral them with your line and then close the loop to score the bonus for them: they mean bonus letters. If you manage to finish a bonus word, the stage is automatically cleared out and you move to a bonus stage where you try to uncover and collect chests (to collect a chest, you need to close a loop around an opened chest) within a time limit.<br/><br/>You lose a life if any of the assorted critters touch one of the arrows or if you run out of time (the border is your timer, and you can boost your time by looping mushrooms and plants), and you gain extra lives at 40,000, 120,000, 200,000, 400,000, 600,000 and 1,000,000 points.

Ltd."], "description": "Destrega is a 3D fighting game that separates itself from other games by creating a Rock, Paper, Scissors type of fighting system. When timed right, you can cancel or overpower your opponent's attack. The game uses two types of fighting styles: close-up hand-to-hand attacks and Relic attacks, which are the long-range projectile attacks. You can also fight in the air, on the ground, and on top of structures.<br/><br/>The fighting style in the game is unique in many aspects. Movement includes the ability to freely roam the current environment. The X button jumps, while R1 causes the player to dash and L1 blocks. The close range fighting system is like Rock, Paper, Scissors where each type of attack is stronger and weaker than another. The Square button results in a quick (but weak) attack; Triangle a slow and powerful one. Circle allows you to sidestep, allowing an attack by slipping behind your opponent.<br/><br/>After stepping far back, the charge bar changes from Red to Blue, indicating you can use magic attacks. Just like close range there are three attacks. The Fast (Tiou), Power (Est), and Span (Foh). Tiou travels fast but hits weak, Est hits hard but travels slow, and if you are far away, the attack will disappear. Foh fires a multiple blast and does medium damage. Tiou beats Est, Est beats Foh, Foh beats Tiou. Tiou drains the least charge, Foh medium, and Est the most.<br/><br/>You can also combine magic attacks. Different combinations equal different results. There is a Level 1 attack; Tiou, Est, and Foh (3 Combinations). Then there is a Level 2 attack; Tiou Tiou, Tiou Est, Tiou Foh, Est Est, Est Foh, Foh Foh, etc (9 Combinations). All of which can be reversed (EX: Foh Est) Then the Level 3 attack, Tiou Tiou Tiou, Tiou Tiou Est, Est Est Tiou, Foh, Tiou Foh, etc (21 Combinations). Then There is a Level 4 attack, Tiou Est Foh (any order), (1 Combination), which does a powerful long wide attack.<br/><br/>The charge bar, located in the top corner of the player's screer, has 4 colors. Red, Green, Yellow, and Blue. Red means magic cannot be used (i.e, when in close-range). When yellow, you can do a level one attack. A green charge bar indicates that any level 2 attack (an attack with two attacks strung together) can be used. Blue indicates a level 3 or 4 attack is possible.<br/><br/>Charged attacks are also possible. While charging (by holding Triangle, Square, or Circle) holding R1, L1, or X can do added effects. R1 does a charged run that can also deflect magic that is weaker than your current charge bar. L1 does a charge guard which blocks ALL magic until your charge bar is fully drained. You can also block level one attacks by holding L1, resulting in little damage, or press it right before contact and deflect it causing no damage. The X button does a charged jump which results in a higher jump, letting your character reach a platform that couldn't be reached by a regular jump. Or you can hit X to jump and hit Tiou, Est, Foh of any type/level and fire another different set of attacks while in the air. You can also land on your feet after being knocked into the air by tapping L1 while in the air.<br/><br/>Game Modes are 1P Battle (Fight CPU), Story (Fight CPUs based on the story), Versus (Fight 2P), Team Battle (Fight with up to 6 characters controlled by a human or player), Time Attack (Finish game with as little time as possible), and Endurance (Fight as many CPU people as possible.

Nevertheless, the game&rsquo;s concept will be pretty much similiar to the known one. In the upcoming adventure, Deathspank will be searching the &quot;Fires of Bacon&quot; and in progress he has to survive tough battles against new rival: Anti-Spank.<br/><br/>Despite the fact that the debut trailer (see below) does not reveal any ingame scences, Hothead promised many improvements in the realm of gameplay and combat. They plan to enable the player to feel more in-control of his character. He will be able to attack enemies via Shield Bash and reflect ranged attacks. In addition, the enemies will act smarter by attacking from different directions and doing a better job at healing each other. Furthermore, the fighting areas will contain certain spots where Deathspank will be able to hide from incoming harm.<br/><br/>Overall, the game will contain more than 100 new quest, over 70 new characters and an additional difficulty level (&quot;insane&quot;). On top, we can look forward to more than 80 new weapons and a new combatant: Bob from Marketing! And regarding his skills like shooting laser eye beams, eating corpses for health, and eating live bodies for an additional attack option, he seems to be a cool guy and a good addition to the team<br/><br/>Now the waiting time sits in until another fun-to-play title with hilarious deathspankish comedy hits the stores.. will Deathspank be able to save his bacon?

(2) A player adds his third card to the pile and correctly repeats all the sounds, ending with &quot;Ouga Bouga!&quot; As a reward, he distributes the cards in the center, as well as any penalty cards previously collected, among all the players.<br/><br/>After a round ends, every player refills his hand to three cards and another round begins.

The Holy Grail is missing and the Knights of the Round Table have disbanded. Some fled, some are rebelling and to make matters even worse, a monstrous race, the strength of which was hinted at in the first game, has emerged.

The King's most trusted advisor, Filiaren, reasoned that t if they could not be destroyed, then they must be hidden.

Naval Ops: Commander, released in 2004, was based on the first game, but, because it featured a different type of gameplay featuring usable escorts, seems not to have inherited the status as the second game in the series, similar to how Koei's Samurai Warriors is based on the Dynasty Warriors gameplay. The sequel seeks to expound on the first title by revamping the visual engine, providing a new campaign and dozens of new features, and work on the bugs that held its predecessor back from being a truly great game. Featuring over 100 missions and all sorts of ships including submarines, battleships, destroyers, cruisers, and more, Warship Gunner 2 hopes to appeal to a large base of action-oriented fans.<br/><br/>The game is set in 1939 of an alternate universe, and thus combines technology of this period in the real world with a variety of futuristic lasers and weapons, without the &quot;World War II-only&quot; mode of the first game. However, the first playthrough is generally &quot;World War II&quot; consistent, while subsequent playthroughs feature more lasers and high-tech weapons en masse, as well as a slightly extended ending run. (After the first playthrough one can choose whether a mission played in Training will use its &quot;1st playthrough&quot; or &quot;subsequent playthroughs&quot; version, called Enemy Deployment 1 or 2.) Regardless, game balance and experience can be drastically affected by the Difficulty, the extent of the player's Parts inventory (whether picked up or R&amp;D'd), the player's chosen ship for a mission, and how the ship was designed.<br/><br/>The story follows three or four officers of a Wilkia Freedom Forces naval crew Captain Schulz, Lieutenant Nagi, Commander Braun (German Federal Republic, attached to the crew), optionally with Commander Tsukuba (Japan) and Lieutenant Commander Werner (Wilkia), as they lead the resistance to the coup that overthrew their King on March 25, 1939, then declared an Empire led by Admiral Karl Weisenberger and started making war, in a manner akin to real-life Nazi Germany, albeit with the trump card of &quot;superweapons,&quot; huge, heavily armed and armored vehicles at sea, in one case on land (a version of the Dora railway gun) and in two cases in the air. Over time, and particularly in the final mission of the second playthrough, the superweapons themselves take further prominence are more is learned about their nature, although their origins are left ambiguous. Wilika is portrayed as a colony of the Dutch that developed into a second &quot;overseas homeland&quot; with a separate ruling king and independent military. In effect the game consists of a group of Evil Dutchmen trying to conquer the world with advanced technology.<br/><br/>Although the same general story applies in all cases, there are three story paths with exclusive missions, &quot;takes&quot; on the story, and endings. The specific story path is chosen by the player's actions in the first two missions of the story and represented by your executive officer (&quot;adjutant&quot;) being Werner, Tsukuba, or Braun (whose rescue and joining the FF is in all three story paths). After completing a first playthrough where Weisenberger goes down with a superweapon upon its sinking, all subsequent playthroughs have Weisenberger escaping to a superweapon submarine, then a final superweapon has to be fought in a mission whose introduction changes the general ending quite a bit.<br/><br/>In the game you can unlock the Zumwalt class Destroyer, as a Secret Blueprint (pre-configured ship design) which can be picked up (as a Parts crate) during the enemy deployment 1 boss battle; it does not however look like the conceptual designs of the real-life Zumwalt class, and it like destroyers and Secret Blueprint designs in general are inferior to many designs that are possible after sufficient research is done.<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;Naval Ops: Warship Gunner 2&quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "106809": {"poll": [], "name": "UFO Chase", "videogamemode": ["Local Multiplayer", "Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["Arcade edition"], "average": "0", "videogametheme": ["Aliens", "Science Fiction", "Space"], "usersrated": "0", "videogamedeveloper": ["Electra"], "videogamegenre": ["Arcade", "Maze"], "videogameplatform": ["Arcade"], "statistics": [], "videogamepublisher": ["Electra"], "description": "User Summary<br/><br/>A mid '70s Electra space game.

The battle was the culmination of a quarter-century of political and military maneuvering by Otto von Bismarck, aimed at enabling Prussia to supplant Austria-Hungary as the dominant state of the coalescing German nation.<br/><br/>The battle is presented using the folio line&rsquo;s Musket &amp; Saber system: brigade-sized units, one-fifth-mile hexes, 90-minute turns, 280 counters. The Austro-Hungarian army, chastened by a week of minor defeats, was entrenched a long line covering the fortress of K&ouml;niggr&auml;tz. It occupied a central position facing three converging Prussian armies. To win, the Prussians must sweep the Austrians off the field (as they did historically), while the Austrians must maintain a presence on the field to justify their continued claim to political primacy. The game emphasizes the differences between the armies in doctrine, weapons and morale. The Prussian triumph was born of more than just the famous needle-gun: their infantry used flexible organization and tactics to mass men quickly at the decisive point, while the Austrians used a throwback to Napoleonic column formations due to a misreading of the lesson from an earlier engagement. The Prussian artillery is outclassed by the superb Austrian guns, but can be dangerous if used properly. The Austrian cavalry is superior as well, but horsed charges were already an anachronism. In the end the battle came down to crucial command decisions, giving both players an opportunity to win.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "1", "boardgameversion": ["Decision Strategy & Tactics Edition"], "age": "0", "name": "Koniggratz", "playingtime": "0", "boardgamemechanic": ["Hex-and-Counter"], "average": "5.475", "usersrated": "20", "boardgamefamily": ["Musket & Saber Combat System"]}, "106822": {"poll": [], "name": "Up Periscope!", "videogamemode": ["Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["C-64 edition"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1080357.jpg", "videogametheme": ["Military", "Ocean / Sea", "War - World War II"], "usersrated": "0", "videogamedeveloper": ["ActionSoft"], "videogamegenre": ["Simulation"], "videogameplatform": ["Commodore 64"], "average": "0", "statistics": [], "videogamepublisher": ["ActionSoft"], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1080357_t.jpg", "description": "From the back of the box<br/><br/>You command a WWII fleet class submarine.

The first mat is a simple 1&quot; grid of stone tiles, the basic dungeon environment. With this mat, a DM can mark walls, doors and other dungeon features using a wet-erase marker. This mat will be the staple battle grid for any indoor encounter. The other mat is a green grass field; ideal for staging outdoor confrontations. Like the other mats, a few quick marks from a wet-erase pen customizes the mat with whatever elements the encounter calls for; add a tree line, forest path or campsite.

It is a part of Ruby Party's Neoromance label.<br/><br/>The world of Harukanaru Toki no Naka de is based on the height of the Heian Period of Japanese history, and many aspects of Heian culture, as described in the great literature of the time, are depicted in the game.<br/><br/>Because of Harukanaru Toki no Naka de's success, the game has give rise to a franchise including several sequels, numerous drama and music CDs, a manga series, two OAVs, a movie, and an anime TV series, and a live-action theatrical.<br/><br/>Harukanaru Toki no Naka de places the player in the role of a girl who is surrounded by attractive young men, and gives her the option of trying to win the heart of one and live happily ever after. The heroine must also fight evil with the help of the attractive young men. The result is a hybrid game with an visual novel-like interaction mode, a simple CRPG battle mode, and a board game-like map.<br/><br/>Haruka is made up of ten chapters, eight of which involve the core gameplay. These chapters take place over a 2 week period and involve traveling around the Ky\u014d map, searching for various key items. Ky\u014d is made up of roughly 20 areas and it is possible to visit three in one day. However, most areas are possessed by onry\u014d (\u6028\u970a vengeful ghosts) that must be dispelled before you can enter, and fighting them consumes one of the three visit chances.<br/><br/>Haruka's battle system is limited in comparison to most CRPGs of its day. The maximum party size is 3 characters, but only Akane is under the direct control of the player. Though Akane can attack and defend, her other abilities - the use of healing items and spells, and the ability to encourage her comrades, are more useful. There is no magic point system as such. Casting spells is based on the morale of the Hachiy\u014d members and the number of elemental fuda (\u672d) cards Akane has. Furthermore, there is no experience system and the character's hit points are refilled automatically between fights. The main reward for fighting, besides gaining entrance to a given area, is the chance to gain the trust of Hachiy\u014d. The greater a Hachiy\u014d member's rapport with Akane, the more effective he will be in battle.<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;Harukanaru Toki no Naka de&quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>User Summary<br/><br/>Perhaps a better translation of the title would be Haruka in Once upon a Time [\u6642\u7a7a]. .<br/><br/>"}, "106875": {"poll": [], "name": "Harukanaru Toki no Naka de 2", "videogamemode": ["Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["Japanese Playstation 2 Edition", "Japanese PSP Edition", "Japanese Windows Edition"], "average": "0", "videogameseries": ["Haruka"], "videogametheme": ["Historical", "Romance / Relationships"], "usersrated": "0", "videogamedeveloper": ["Ruby Party"], "videogamegenre": ["Adventure"], "videogameplatform": ["PlayStation 2", "PSP", "Windows"], "statistics": [], "videogamepublisher": ["Koei Co.

The concept behind foldit is based on proteins that are found in plants and animals (including humans).  These proteins will fold themselves into certain ideal shapes that allow them to interact with the human body.  However, because many proteins are so complex, it is hard to determine the ideal shape.  This is where Foldit comes in.  The game poses the player with several proteins, and it is up to the players to see if they can find the most efficient way to fold it up based on real biological rules.<br/><br/>By presenting these proteins as puzzles to human players, the creators of Foldit hope to supplement their computer-based tests with the skills of human problem solving, and possibly even find new ways to optimize programs that determine protein folding patterns.  This can have benefits ranging from understanding how the human body works to treating or even curing diseases.<br/><br/>The game allows players to fold alone, work with others' solutions (known as evolvers), or form groups to work together.  There are also high score tables for groups, solo players and evolvers.<br/><br/>This program was created by programmers and engineers at the University of Washington, including members of the UW Center for Game Science and the UW Department of Computer Science and Engineering.<br/><br/>"}, "106881": {"poll": [], "name": "Harukanaru Toki no Naka de 3: Unmei no Labyrinth", "videogamemode": ["Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["Japanese PlayStation 2 edition"], "average": "0", "videogametheme": ["Historical", "Romance / Relationships"], "usersrated": "0", "videogameexpansion": ["Harukanaru Toki no Naka de 3"], "videogamedeveloper": ["Ruby Party"], "videogamegenre": ["Adventure"], "videogameplatform": ["PlayStation 2"], "statistics": [], "videogamepublisher": ["Koei Co.

It was released in Japan and PAL regions (but was poorly distributed in some countries which makes copies of this game rather rare). It was set to be released in North America, but was cancelled. The series is based on the manga Hamtaro, written by Ritsuko Kawai.<br/>Plot<br/><br/>The game involves an extensive plot. One day while playing outside, Bijou witnesses a great rainbow. The rainbow disappears and Prince Bo falls to the ground. The Prince states that he can make rainbows by using his umbrella. He tries to prove it to disbelieving Stan and the rest of the Ham-Hams, but realizes too late that the colors on his umbrella are gone! And thus, Hamtaro and his Ham-Ham friends must set off on a journey in order to collect things that are the proper color for Prince Bo to use for his umbrella so he can create a rainbow to return home.<br/>Gameplay<br/><br/>Certain minigames are needed to reach the colors, and the player must have certain Ham-Hams in their party in order to play them. For example, Sandy is needed to ride pigeons, Bijou is needed to collect falling petals, and Penelope is needed for rolling on top of cans to get across small streams.<br/>In addition to the original Ham-Hams, the game contains some additional characters, most of which were never seen in the English anime. These include Prince Bo, who is the prince of Rainbowland (a castle that is made of clouds); Flora, or Nurse-Ham; Tux; and other various characters.<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;Hamtaro: Rainbow Rescue&quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "106883": {"poll": [], "name": "Hamtaro: Ham-Ham Heartbreak", "videogamemode": ["Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["North American Game Boy Advance edition"], "average": "0", "videogametheme": ["Animals", "Cartoon"], "videogamegenre": ["Adventure"], "videogamedeveloper": ["Nintendo Co., Ltd."], "videogamefranchise": ["Hamtaro"], "videogameplatform": ["Game Boy Advance"], "usersrated": "0", "statistics": [], "videogamepublisher": ["Nintendo Co., Ltd."], "description": "Hamtaro: Ham-Ham Heartbreak (\u3068\u3063\u3068\u3053\u30cf\u30e0\u592a\u90ce3 \u30e9\u30d6\u30e9\u30d6\u5927\u5192\u967a\u3067\u3061\u3085 Tottoko Hamutaro 3: Love Love Daib\u014dken Dechu?) is a Nintendo video game for Game Boy Advance and the sequel to Tottoko Hamutaro: Tomodachi Daisakusen Dechu (Japan only) and Hamtaro: Ham-Hams Unite!. Therefore, it was the second Hamtaro-game released in America and Europe, but the third one in Japan. It was released in Japan on May 3, 2002, in the USA on April 8, 2003 and in Europe on June 27, 2003.<br/>Like its predecessors, Hamtaro: Ham-Ham Heartbreak is an adventure game. Set in the world of the Hamtaro books and anime, the player controls the hamster (&quot;Ham-Ham&quot;, as the hamsters tend to call themselves) Hamtaro. Hamtaro: Ham-Ham Heartbreak expands on the gameplay of the earlier titles by adding Bijou, a friend of Hamtaro who has a crush on him, as partner. Together, they have to save the other ham-hams from Spat, an evil hamster with a hatred for any kind of relation.<br/>After Hamtaro: Ham-Ham Heartbreak, only one more Hamtaro adventure game was released: Hamtaro: Rainbow Rescue.<br/>The game is mentioned in the Chronicle section of Super Smash Bros. Brawl.<br/>At the start of the game, Hamtaro is having a nightmare. A hamster dressed in a black devil costume holding a trident is destroying the relations of various hamsters. Then, the hamster notices Hamtaro and attempts to attack him. Hamtaro is awakened by Boss, to whom he tells his dream.[3] Hamtaro later finds Bijou, and the two of them must stop Spat and fix the problems he has made. Will the two lovebirds stop Spat or will he end love forever?<br/>Gameplay<br/><br/>The goals in Hamtaro: Ham-Ham Heartbreak are to defeat Spat once and for all and to repair all the destroyed relations. A third quest, that supports those two, is to obtain all the &quot;Ham-Chats&quot;.[4] Ham-Chats are words, but also much more than that. At the start of the game, Hamtaro accidentally causes almost all the Ham-Chats in his Ham-Ham Dictionary to vanish, starting the hunt to fill the dictionary. Each Ham-Chat represents both a word (for communicating) and an action and/or motion. For instance, Lookie means to look. It is one of the most common Ham-Chats in the game, and solely has an action function. In that sense, action Ham-Chats often come with the necessary item (which is part of the Ham-Chat motion and doesn't show up in the inventory) and therefore, go another way than other adventure games in which the player already has all the actions available, but still has to get the required items. The other kind of Ham-Chat can only be used in conversations. A Ham-Chat like Perskie (Listen) for instance, only has value for conversations. New Ham-Chats are necessary to gain access to new parts of a conversation and get another Ham-Ham to do or give something.<br/>Apart from Ham-Chats, the player also is required to obtain items (like a more conventional adventure game), though most of them are merely needed to complete minigames/side-quest. They are divided in inventory items, songs, currency and gems. Inventory items function like they do in any other adventure game and need to be combined with the Ham-Chats in order to proceed.<br/>As in its prequel, Ham-Hams Unite, this game allows you to put together the actions for Ham-Chat words to create dances, with a room just for this purpose in the Clubhouse. In Ham-Ham Heartbreak, however, there is an additional feature relating to &quot;Ham-Jams.&quot;<br/>You can pick up a variety of items such as sunflower seeds on the ground by selecting hif-hif or digging for them with digdig. Rocks can also be found in this game, but they serve a different purpose in Heartbreak. You can take the rocks and polish them in the RubRub Room in order to uncover gems.<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;Hamtaro: Ham-Ham Heartbreak&quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "106884": {"poll": [], "name": "Hamtaro: Ham-Ham Games", "videogamemode": ["Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["North American Game Boy Advance edition"], "average": "5", "videogametheme": ["Animals", "Cartoon"], "videogamegenre": ["Sports"], "videogamedeveloper": ["AlphaDream"], "videogamefranchise": ["Hamtaro"], "videogameplatform": ["Game Boy Advance"], "usersrated": "1", "statistics": [], "videogamepublisher": ["Nintendo Co., Ltd."], "description": "Hamtaro: Ham-Ham Games is a sports video game developed by Alphadream and published by Nintendo for the Game Boy Advance handheld video game console.

This expansion focuses on the events surrounding the Allied breakout from the Normandy beachhead in July-August 1944. Operation Cobra adds the Canadians, the Free French and the Free Polish to the Nations at War series in addition to new units for the Americans, the British, and the Germans.<br/><br/>White Star Rising: Operation Cobra comes with nine stand-alone scenarios, focusing on events near Falaise, as the Germans tried to escape the converging allied armies. Among the topics are the Polish stand on Mont Ormel Ridge and Canadian efforts to capture the village of St. Lambert-sur-Dives.

Directing a Mark VIIIB German U-Boat, you must quickly fire a spread of torpedoes and then utilize your ability to dive to a depth of 600 feet to avoid damage (which your old sub can ill afford).  Later, you may choose a Mark XXI, with its maximum underwater speed of an incredible 17 knots, to help demolish American convoys.  You will be hard pressed to fully exploit your fleet's distinct advantages...and avoid its fatal hazards.<br/><br/>Playing the opposing role - commander of the escorting destroyers and frigates - you must protect your convoy from the enemy below.  Using ships like the destroyer escort U.S.S. Buckley, you employ active sonar to locate and destroy enemy subs with depth charges, K-guns, and hedgehogs.  If you can force the submarine to surface, it will be easy prey for your guns.  At night, you must deal with the added possibility of facing a surface sub attack since darkness allows submarines to move in like PT boats.  By firing starshells to illuminate a suspect area, you may be able to catch a glimpse of the enemy and force it to dive.<br/><br/>TORPEDO FIRE takes all battle factors into account...from the use of sonar to the periscope view seen by the sub commander.  The excitement and tension of underwater warfare have been carefully built into the game.  With attention to historical accuracy, each ship is rated for everything from maximum speed to maximum &quot;safe&quot; underwater depth (although subs can exceed their maximum depth if you are willing to accept possible damage).  Further simulating real battle conditions, once a ship has received orders for course and speed, it will continue moving accordingly until otherwise directed.

The player is allowed to recruit demons and use them to battle with, but Magnetite, the game's money, depletes with each use. Therefore, it becomes necessary to finish battles quickly and to not overuse demons.[1] Players also have the ability to fuse demons to create stronger ones.

The game provides complete ship ratings for speed and strength, fuel restrictions, and refueling capabilities.

Like a real naval battle, firing is done from individual sets of guns, each with differing characteristics and accuracy.  Torpedoes are also at your disposal.  When it comes to calculating ship damage and its effect on firepower, communications and speed, you simply leave all the work to the unerringly fast computer.<br/><br/>There's even a feature that nicely bridges the innovation of computer wizardry and wargaming tradition: You can resolve all battles by using your own World War II naval miniatures.  Just enter the results of your off-line combat and the computer will incorporate them into the strategic game.<br/><br/>The game contains two scenarios, all played on a 19-by-19 square-grid map of the South Atlantic displayed in colorful Hi-Res graphics.  The first goes from December 1st to the 25th, which recounts the entire historic chase.  Here shadowing, pursuit, and elusive maneuvers are your primary concerns.  The second simulates the Battle of the River Plate, where the Graf Spee - already located - must deal with the Royal Navy's Exeter, Ajax, and Achilles.<br/><br/>Finally, the solitaire scenario lets you match wits against the computer as it directs the Graf Spee.

Originally released for the PC8801SR, PC9801, MSX2 home computer, it was remade for the Super NES platform, which was released in North America.<br/><br/>The game is a non-historical account of Japan's warring states period. In that sense, Inindo can be considered as a spin-off of the long-standing Nobunaga's Ambition series.<br/><br/>Set in 1582, the player assumes the role of an Iga ninja whose village has been destroyed by the conquest of the ruthless warlord Oda Nobunaga. The ninja must travel across feudal Japan, enlisting the aid of numerous ninja, sages, hermits, ronin, samurai, wizards and other companions, in order to avenge his clan.<br/><br/>The actual game begins in the year 1582. If the player does not kill Nobunaga by the year 1601, the game is over.<br/><br/>Several hazardous dungeons stand in the path of victory, as well as a selection of optional dungeons which can be played in any order the player chooses. Encounters with monsters and outlaws occur randomly in dungeons and in the game's world map, during which the player characters and NPCs can move around the battlefield in turn-based fashion to attack, cast magic spells and use items.<br/><br/>To complete the game, the player must recruit NPCs in order to successfully survive dungeons and large scale battles. In order to recruit other characters, the player must build up a certain degree of trust by talking with them at Tea Houses and Inns. Not every character can be recruited: characters of rival clans will not join the player.<br/><br/>There are strategy and war simulation elements to game as well. By gaining the trust of a Japanese feudal lord, (by spying or committing acts of sabotage on competing daimyo), the player can join in the battle for the provinces that characterized the era. The outcome of these battles changes the lords' possession of individual provinces, which can alter the outcome of the game and aid or hinder the player's progress. Neighboring provinces to Nobunaga's must be conquered in order to advance to the final section of the game.<br/><br/>In the middle of the stories, the player follows either the &quot;normal&quot; path or the &quot;magician&quot; path, which is randomly selected after completing the first dungeon quest. Each path leads to different enemies during random encounters. For example, &quot;magician&quot; path causes Western type monsters such as Hellhound or Marchosias to appear.<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;Inindo: Way of the Ninja&quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "106977": {"boardgamedesigner": ["Dan Wong"], "poll": [], "name": "Conspiracy Tactics", "playingtime": "30", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": ["Area Movement", "Betting/Wagering", "Dice Rolling"], "yearpublished": "2012", "usersrated": "0", "boardgamefamily": ["Crowdfunding: Kickstarter"], "maxplayers": "4", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1087117_t.jpg", "average": "0", "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["Altered World Studios"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1087117.jpg", "boardgameversion": ["First Edition"], "maxplaytime": "30", "boardgamecategory": ["Abstract Strategy", "Bluffing", "Dice", "Science Fiction"], "age": "13", "minplaytime": "30", "description": "Conspiracy Tactics is a fast-paced two-player board game of psychological combat.

There are 10 types of formations that can be selected freely by players. Previously unseen in the MMO world, is a stunning new PK mode: players step into the battle by virtue of the presence of their army and can direct their experience of ancient wars.  <br/>\u3000<br/>In addition, online play in the K3 PK stem has many map tiers. Each time a player passes through a higher level map, he or she can earn a rich bonus (such as advanced soldiers, equipment, technology and so on). Furthermore, so that you can truly experience the Three Kingdoms period, the game screen can focus onto different levels of detail: there are local screens, battle screens, and the world screen.

Overall, a satirical game about the White House that will award you with lots of laughs.<br/><br/>"}, "106996": {"poll": [], "name": "Serious Sam Double D", "videogamemode": ["Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["Windows Downloadable Edition"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1459941.jpg", "videogameseries": ["Serious Sam"], "videogametheme": ["Aliens"], "usersrated": "2", "videogamedeveloper": ["Mommy's Best Games"], "videogamegenre": ["Action", "Scrolling"], "videogameplatform": ["Windows"], "average": "5.5", "statistics": [], "videogamepublisher": ["Devolver Digital"], "videogamecompilation": ["The Serious Sam Collection"], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1459941_t.jpg", "description": "User Summary<br/><br/>Serious Sam Double D is a two dimensional side scrolling shooter that features the Weapon Stacking feature.

With the multitude of armies either preassembled or designed by you, you can even conjure up the unlikely confrontation of the Lords of Lockwood and their Osgorthian forces against Alexander the Great's Companions or Caesar's Legionnaires!  Ah, the possibilities!<br/><br/>The computer paints in beautiful, color Hi-Res graphics an Osgorthian battlefield of knolls, mountains, forests, and open plains.  Unit types are categorized into five classes of infantry and four of cavalry.  The tribes that populate this world are as varied as they are enchanted: dwarves, elves, unicorns, amazons, centaurs, just to name a few.  Your fantasy soldiers have been carefully rated for speed, strength, and morale.  They may bear no armor or come amply protected by leather, scale/chain mail, or shields.  Their weapons may be the bow, javelin, rocks, spears, pikes, swords, axes, clubs, or cavalry lance...and of course, spells that can magically enhance a unit's speed, defensive and attacking power, or courage.<br/><br/>As richly detailed as this game is, it never becomes unwieldy because the computer keeps track of everything.  Furthermore, its simple but elegant movement system was designed so that all action can proceed at a brisk pace.  It also comes with a powerful and intelligent computer opponent for solitaire play.

Your family (one of four) has a small, but steady income that should suffice to hire a few showmen to bring life to the oh-so-empty park site. As you earn more, you can afford a favor or two: the police officer is kinder to you, you can hire a migrant worker to do extra work, and you can even finagle the attention of a promoter or a journalist!<br/><br/>The families will need to co-operate from time to time; after all, those grand attractions don't build themselves. In the end, the grand attractions are what will impress the crowds and bring about euphoric headlines in the newspapers!<br/><br/>To set up Coney Island, each player takes two money tiles, a random building material and a player board, covering most of the spaces on that board with showmen tiles. At the start of each turn, a player receives income. At the beginning of the game a player's income is one VP, one money and one randomly drawn building material; as the game progresses, the player can remove showmen tiles to uncover VP, money and material spaces, thereby boosting his income. A player can never have more than five money tiles and five materials.<br/><br/>A player then takes one to three main actions and up to five special actions:<br/><br/><br/>    Place a building site tile. Pay the cost of the space you cover and receive the reward shown there (VPs, materials, an additional action)<br/>    Place a showmen tile. Pay the cost in building materials shown on your player board, then place this tile on an empty space on a building site. This boosts your income (by uncovering a space) and gives you and others potential places to build.<br/>    Place a grand attraction tile. These tiles cost 2-5 materials to build and cover 1-4 spaces, each of which must have a showman tile on it. Players receive points for their showmen used or attraction placed, then the showmen are returned to the appropriate player boards.<br/><br/><br/>By spending two money, a player can acquire one of five character tiles (either from the supply or another player); each character provides a special action that the player can use each turn, such as spending money or VPs for material or buying newspaper tiles (which are worth points and can be spent for an additional action).<br/><br/>Each main action may be executed at most once per turn unless extra actions are used from newspapers or from bonuses earned by placing certain building site tiles.<br/><br/>After one player reaches 60 VP, and each player has had the same number of turns, the game ends, with players scoring their newspaper tiles and losing points for each showman on their player boards.
