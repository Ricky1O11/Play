As opposed to purchasing vehicles as in the majority of games in the &quot;driving simulator&quot; genre, unlocking cars is done by completing a race, followed by a slot machine style method that determines which opposing car in the race you unlock, and depending on when the player stops the slot, sometimes no car at all is unlocked.<br/><br/>Also, instead of purchasing parts to improve your car, &quot;Enthu Points&quot; are used to keep track of collisions with walls and cars, or going off course. These points are used to calculate a form of &quot;experience points&quot; which, when enough are obtained, a stat of the car (weight, power, or tires) is upgraded, up to three times each. The more &quot;Enthu Points&quot; are lost, the less points one can get to upgrade a car.<br/><br/>The driver can also be upgraded in the same way, with the points changing stats such as maximum number of &quot;Enthu Points&quot; or the rate at which they are recovered after a race. If a player runs out of &quot;Enthu Points&quot; (&quot;Driver HP&quot; in the JPN version) during a race, the player is has to miss the next race. Full points can be restored by &quot;resting,&quot; or a large amount is restored when changing a car.<br/><br/>Another unique mode of play in Enthusia is the &quot;Driving Revolution&quot; mode. In this mode players must attempt to pass through gates at the correct speed while accelerating, braking or keeping a constant speed. Points are gained for doing this correctly and enough points must be gained to pass on to the next level.<br/><br/>Compared to a 700+ vehicle racing simulator like Gran Turismo 4, Enthusia distinguishes itself by a decent selection of rare makers such as Saab or Smart and collectible cars including the Bugatti EB110 '91, Citro&euml;n DS 23 Pallas '73, BMW M1 Procar '79, BMW 3.0 CSL works car '73, De Tomaso Pantera GTS '73, Alfa Romeo SZ '89 and more. In total, Enthusia includes 211 vehicles to choose from in classes ranging from F through A and R.<br/><br/>The game's visual effects include a speed blur effect in first person view (as appeared in Genki's Racing Battle C1 Grand Prix released a few weeks later), very detailed graphics with highly detailed CG-like car models (Citr&ouml;en 2cv 6 Charleston) e.g. the Bugatti EB110's rear spoiler slowly rises up in real time at the beginning of the race just like in the real life.<br/><br/>Enthusia also features realistic foreground textures (Burgenschlucht, L&ouml;wenseering courses), and course animations such as birds taking off, an animated windpower park (Burgenschlucht), multiple waterfalls, rivers and fountains (Mystic Caveway, Edge Of The Road), car traffic (Route De La Seine) or even a full aerobatic demonstration team emitting coloured smoke trails (L&ouml;wenseering) complete with a realistic aircraft fly-by sound.<br/><br/>Enthusia contains ultra realistic engine, tire and exhaust sounds admired by car industry professionals (Hiroshi Ito from Mazda Motors vehicle development division) and experienced pro driver celebrities (Motoharu &quot;Gan San&quot; Kurosawa who raced 6000 laps over N&uuml;rburgring the last 20 years).[citation needed]<br/><br/>The Replay mode in Enthusia is also different from most seen in other games of the genre. Replays contain visual effects such as dirt buildup on sideskirts and tires on rally stages, cars emitting smoke on rally raid stages, wind streams moving dune sand, animated waves on the Dakar seashore or the choked sound of the car bouncing on the sand dunes (Mirage Crossing).<br/><br/>Also worthy of noting, Enthusia appears to be the first game of its kind to accurately represent automatic transmissions. Many racing/driving simulators use a generic automatic method of requiring the engine to reach a set redline in each gear before it will shift to the next gear regardless of the amount of throttle being applied. In Enthusia, pressure sensitive throttle input is taken advantage of to mimic real automatic transmission characteristics.<br/><br/>For example, you can be in a high gear &quot;cruising&quot; at the standard highway speed (U.S.) of 65mph, and you will be in the highest gear/lowest RPM range for optimal fuel efficiency. If you were to apply full throttle, Enthusia senses this and down shifts to a lower gear to provide more power - like in real life. While this is a much overlooked feature due to its functionality, it is one of the many small unique things that set Enthusia apart from other simulators, and true car enthusiasts notice.<br/><br/>On the other hand there are some flaws and perfectible aspects such as the low-fi background bitmaps (Dragon Range, Burgenschlucht) which look unnatural and inferior compared to the photo realistic high-resolution background bitmaps used in Gran Turismo 4 (Citta Di Aria, Grand Canyon courses). Also, the game could have featured options such as Widescreen mode, 480p, screen adjust setup, hide display function and Dolby Prologic II sound instead of simply mono or stereo sound options.<br/><br/>Enthusia can be used with the Logitech Driving Force, Driving Force Pro, Driving Force GT and G25 steering wheels. For the last three wheels the game fully supports the 900-Degree Steering mode.<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;Enthusia Professional Racing&quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "117522": {"poll": [], "name": "Eureka Seven vol. 1: New Wave", "videogamemode": ["Local Multiplayer", "Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["Japanese PlayStation 2 edition", "North American PlayStation 2 edition"], "average": "0", "videogametheme": ["Anime"], "usersrated": "0", "videogamedeveloper": ["Bandai"], "videogamegenre": ["Action Adventure"], "videogameplatform": ["PlayStation 2"], "statistics": [], "videogamepublisher": ["Namco Bandai Games Inc."], "description": "Eureka Seven vol. 1: The New Wave is the first in a trio of games set in the Eureka Seven anime world.

At the championships, Sumner finds out that Ruri is leaving New Wave. She says that he wouldn't understand it until he owned his own LFO and leaves him with a kiss and a picture. Sumner wins the championships regardless, only to be recruited by the illustrious Sawyer Team, the military branch that New Wave has been training him for. From there on out he pilots his KLF on various missions that test how well he knows his LFO, such as taking out a bandit group situated in mines, getting hard evidence against a black market trade, and protecting his city from various disruptions. Later on, Sumner&rsquo;s old teammates join Sawyer Team. There are then six people on Sawyer Team, and Hooky still dislikes Sumner.<br/><br/>After a series of missions, Sumner eventually meet up with characters from the anime, including Holland, to whom he bequeaths the advanced Nirvash LFO he stole from the military, Moondoggie, who like Sumner appears in the sequel, and Eureka. The game's final missions find him piloting the Nirvash.<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;Eureka Seven vol.1: New Wave&quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "117523": {"rpgdesigner": ["Jesse Decker"], "rpgitemversion": ["PDF version"], "poll": [], "name": "Signal Interruption", "rpgartist": ["Todd Gamble", "Adam Hughes"], "rpgproducer": ["Thom Beckman", "Leland Chee", "Sue Weinlein Cook", "Sean Glenn", "Kyle Stanley Hunter", "Thomas M.

When the Trade Federation decided to invade Naboo and take it by force of arms, its first step was to cut off Naboo&rsquo;s communications and sensor systems. Part of that plan involved some covert operations before the actual invasion against a few of Naboo&rsquo;s sensor arrays. This adventure details a raid by a group of free agents (the heroes) against a small sensor array near the city of Kwilaan. Since the Trade Federation has not yet decided to invade Naboo, it dares not use its own forces, thus maintaining<br/>the ability to deny any involvement in the raid, should something go wrong.<br/><br/>This short adventure is designed to introduce beginning players and GMs to some of the exciting concepts found in the new The Dark Side Sourcebook.You don&rsquo;t have to have the Dark Side Sourcebook to play, but the guidelines in that book will prove helpful in running this scenario.

This game, along with the companion program RobotWrite, was originally developed in the TUTOR programming language language on the PLATO system in the 1970s. Later the game was commercialized and adapted for the Apple II family of computers and published by Muse Software in 1981. The premise was that in the distant future of 2002, war was declared hazardous to human health, and now countries settled their differences in a battle arena full of combat robots. As the manual stated, &quot;The task set before you is: to program a robot, that no other robot can destroy!&quot;<br/><br/>The robots' language was similar to BASIC. There were 34 registers that could be used as variables or for the robots' I/O functions.  In a way, RobotWar was a multiplayer game, in that different people could program their robots, then copy all the robots' source code to the same floppy disk and load all the robots to fight in the arena.<br/><br/>The main activity of the game was to write a computer program that would operate a (simulated) robot. The player could then select multiple robots who would do battle in an arena until only one was left standing. The robots did not have direct knowledge of the location or velocity of any of the other robots; they could only use radar pulses to deduce distance, and perhaps use clever programming techniques to deduce velocity.

It has many weapons and sounds from its precursor, MoleZ, and provided inspiration for the game later game, Soldat.<br/><br/>In Liero, two worms fight each other to death for score (or frags) using a choice of five weapons from a total of 40 in a two-dimensional map. Most of the terrain, except for indestructible rocks, may be dug or destroyed by explosions. In addition to the weaponry, each player has a ninja rope which can be used to move faster through the map. This grappling hook-like device substitutes for jetpacks and can even latch onto the enemy worm to drag him closer to his foe.<br/><br/>While playing, there are health power-ups to heal your worm. It is also possible to replace one of your five weapons by picking up bonuses. Before playing, you can select certain weapons to be available only in bonuses, in the entire game, or completely disable them.<br/><br/>Unlike most side-scrolling deathmatch games, the weapons in Liero have infinite ammo. Key factors include the reload rate of each weapon and how fast they shoot, whereas in most others include how much ammo a gun sports and how frequent more ammo for that gun can be found. Liero depends all on timing and swift maneuverability.<br/><br/>The gameplay mode can be deathmatch, Game of Tag or Capture the Flag. It can be played by two human players simultaneously in split screen or in a single player mode against the game's artificial intelligence, although the game's popularity is derived mostly from the fast-paced player vs. player action it provides.<br/><br/>Liero's last release was version 1.33, released in 1999. However, the author lost the Pascal source code in a hard disk crash, and due to the lack of backup, no new &quot;classic&quot; versions have been released since.  Despite this, and with the author's approval, the Liero community has distributed several altered (or hacked) versions of the game through the LieroCDC, and others. In 2009, &quot;classic&quot; Liero was officially merged with the OpenLiero project upon the release of Liero 1.34 (not to be confused with the total conversion by that name). The new versions are released by Gliptic, although Joosa Riekkinen endorses them as official.<br/><br/>Liero is a versatile game in terms of modification. All of its 40 weapons can be completely replaced with new ones that can be given different images and sound effects from the original set. The images of the worms themselves can be transformed into completely different characters, although their movement animations are less flexible regarding modification. The maps can be given permanent terrain other than rocks alone. Destroyable terrain can also be colored more than simply plain dirt. The AI can be modified to be harder or easier. Nearly the whole game can be converted into something entirely different, except for the main aspect having to do with slaughtering another player/AI.<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;Liero&quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "117567": {"rpgartist": ["Robert Lazzaretti"], "rpgitemversion": ["PDF version"], "poll": [], "name": "Positive ID", "rpgdesigner": ["J.

The final title of the project was confirmed on May 11, 2007. Ragnar T&oslash;rnquist is the creative director of the game<br/><br/>After announcing the development of The Secret World, Funcom project director J&oslash;rgen Tharaldsen informed the press that the game uses the same engine as Age of Conan. According to Funcom, the game will blend elements of MMO gameplay with alternate reality gaming and social networking.<br/><br/>At GDC 2009, T&oslash;rnquist gave an interview to GameSpot regarding TSW, revealing more about its gameplay. There will be neither levels, nor classes in the game; instead, the character building will be skill-based. This way, the developers plan to avoid level grinding, allowing new players to join the game more easily. The player characters will be customizable to a large degree, particularly in their choice of clothing, weapons (which range from shotguns to swords and can be customized and upgraded), and the supernatural powers they acquire. Combat against computer-controlled monsters will be one of the game's central points and will require more of player's attention than contemporary MMORPGs. The players will be able to form teams to fight together but in an earlier blog posting, T&oslash;rnquist assured that the game can also be played in single-player mode, should a player choose not to play with a group. According to him, the game is story-driven and there will be an overarching linear plot, as well as numerous side-quests, ranging from investigation to sabotage and hunting, since diversity of the gameplay will be another central point.<br/><br/>In an interview to GameSpot at the 2009 Penny Arcade Expo, T&oslash;rnquist and the lead designer Martin Bruusgaard revealed which playable factions (&quot;secret societies&quot;) will be available in the game. These are: the London-based Templars, pious zealots &quot;who would burn an entire village down to get their hands on one demon&quot;; the New York City-based Illuminati, Machiavellian pragmatists who &quot;believe that it's a tough world where only the strongest will survive&quot;; and the Seoul-based &quot;Dragon&quot;, who take a neutral stance between the other two and are &quot;all about deceiving, orchestrating chaos, and waiting patiently for its time&quot;. A personality test to determine the players' inclination towards one of the factions was made available on the official TSW website soon after the reveal. It will be impossible to change factions without creating a new character. Additionally, players will be able to create their own guilds, known as &quot;cabals&quot; in-game, affiliated with one of the main factions. All players' actions in the game will contribute to their ranking in their respective guilds and factions. The same interview revealed that PvP areas of the game will be located in the region called Agartha inside the hollow Earth, where the players will fight for the invaluable resource known as &quot;anima&quot;. This idea was dropped during closed beta as they decided it wasn't entertaining enough. Large scale PvP has later been revealed to take place in big persistent warzones.[citation needed] There are also small minigames in iconic locations such as Shambhala, El Dorado, and Stonehenge.<br/><br/>The game will feature an original setting created by Funcom, with contemporary elements as well as &quot;magic, myths, conspiracies and dark horrors.&quot; Contrary to rumors spawned by the game's second working title, it has nothing to do with, nor is it inspired by, the .hack franchise and its setting. T&oslash;rnquist debunked several rumors surrounding The Secret World, stating that &quot;there are no aliens or sci-fi elements&quot; in it. He also denied any connection of TSW to The Longest Journey.<br/><br/>At GDC 2009, T&oslash;rnquist revealed more about the setting and the story. He stressed that the game is set in the &quot;modern day real world&quot; but also incorporates pieces of ancient mythologies, real and false history, urban legends, and pop culture, and ties them into an original back-story. The latter is said to go back in time for 100 million years and encompass long extinct ancient civilizations. The players will assume the roles of supernatural heroes who participate in a &quot;future war between good and evil&quot;, fighting dark monsters that threaten the modern world. T&oslash;rnquist identified the genre of the story as dark fantasy, mentioning vampires, demons, and zombies. The players will be free to travel across different locations of the world (both real, like London, New York and Seoul, and mythical, e.g. Agartha, the legendary city located within Hollow Earth[) and even in time, to pursue the overall plot and investigate new mysteries in connection to the dark invasion. The overall plot will have a conclusion but the designers also leave room for future expansions.<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;The Secret World&quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "117571": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1197479.jpg", "poll": [], "boardgamedesigner": ["(Uncredited)"], "statistics": [], "yearpublished": "2012", "maxplayers": "5", "boardgameartist": ["INGEORGE Design"], "boardgamepublisher": ["AMIGO Spiel + Freizeit GmbH"], "maxplaytime": "20", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1197479_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "20", "boardgamecategory": ["Real-time"], "description": "Time to play Cookie Monster!

Players try to ride a bike with simulated physics, to collect flags as quickly as possible. Bike or Die! allows players to submit their replays to Toyspring's server.<br/><br/>Gameplay involves using the Palm's keys to control the movement of the biker. The player must guide the biker through all of the checkpoint flags, if there are any. The level is completed when the biker reaches the finish flag; if there is no finish flag, then the biker only has to pass the checkpoints. In each level, there are usually obstacles and challenging terrain that will cause the biker to crash and fall of the bike. When this happens, the player must restart the level. A player crashes when they either run into mines, which can be randomly or strategically placed in the levels, or when the biker's body hits the ground or a wall. Later version introduced sticky and slippy surfaces, along with portals, which are quite difficult to work with, but produce interesting results. All of these features are supported by the level editor, Bike or Design. The bike is very springy and can wheelie, flip, or do jumps. However, if the bike has too much force when hitting an object, the bike will go through the ground, the biker will crash, and the level must be restarted.<br/><br/>Gameplay progresses through a levelpack, which includes a number of levels. Only the first two levels of each pack are available to be played; to access more, one of the prior two levels have been beaten. Bike or Die! comes with 25 levels, and additional levels can be downloaded from the Bike or Die! web site. 163 of these levels are currently in the Time Trial competition. Most of these levels were made by players, and selected for the Time Trial by popular demand. Levels are occasionally added to the Time Trial in groups of 10-16 levels. Levelpacks usually consist of about 15 levels, but packs range from three to over 100 levels each.<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;Bike or die&quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "117580": {"poll": [], "name": "ZooMumba", "videogamemode": ["Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["Web Browser edition"], "average": "0", "videogametheme": ["Animals", "Business/Construction"], "usersrated": "0", "videogamedeveloper": ["Bigpoint GmbH"], "videogamegenre": ["Management"], "videogameplatform": ["Web Browser"], "videogamehonor": ["2011 British Academy Game Awards Best Casual/Social Game of the Year Nominee"], "statistics": [], "videogamepublisher": ["Bigpoint GmbH"], "description": "In ZooMumba, players take up the responsibility of creating and maintaining a zoo.

Much of the interactivity in the game revolves around the upkeep of your animals and zoo, making sure that the animals are well taken care of and that your zoo is kept clean.

Zoo Pennies is the currency that is more readily available as numerous jobs and concession stands can produce zoo pennies. ZooDollars are a bit harder to come by and they are used to purchase special/rare animals and exquisite decorations for the zoo.<br/><br/>Assistants in ZooMumba are used when the player does not have the ability or time to maintain their zoo. Assistants will perform the various tasks in order to keep the zoo running in tip top shape; with Assistants, the player will not have to worry about their animals going hungry or their zoo becoming a mess.<br/><br/>The Bank is where the user can go to purchase Zoo Dollars.

Formally announced on October 13, 2010 via the website of magazine Game Informer, the game is currently undergoing a closed beta phase and is scheduled for a full release in 2012. Dota 2 will be released through both retail and download by Valve's content delivery platform Steam, on which the game has been developed to run exclusively for both game launch and update delivery. Dota 2 will operate on Microsoft Windows and Mac OS X.<br/><br/>The game consists of session-based online multiplayer activity, with the primary objective of each match being for the teams to destroy their opposing team's fortified stronghold. Each player controls a player character called a &quot;hero&quot;, who is given the responsibility of participating in team combat, which generally takes place along a series of lanes that connect their opposing bases, lined with defensive towers. The gameplay elements are largely incorporated from Defense of the Ancients, with the game's lead designer, &quot;IceFrog&quot;, being the longest-serving and current developer of the Warcraft III mod.<br/><br/>Dota 2 combines the real-time strategy element of traditional top-down perspective, while also incorporating the leveling and itemization system of a role-playing video game. Players are pitted against each other as two distinct factions called the Radiant and the Dire. The Radiant is a faction based at the southwest corner of the map, while the Dire is a faction based at the northeast corner. Players assume the role of a &quot;hero&quot; - a strategically-powerful unit with special skills, who, through combat experience, may progress to a maximum level of twenty-five. The heroes' methods of combat are heavily influenced by their primary property, which can be physical strength, agility, or intelligence. The basic setup of Dota 2 places two strongholds containing critical structures called &quot;Ancient Fortresses&quot; at opposing ends of an evenly balanced map. These bases are connected by three main paths (referred to as &quot;lanes&quot;) which are guarded by defensive towers and constantly spawning waves of units which march from one side to another, combating the towers as well as each other along the way. Players are split into two teams, each consisting of up to five players, to compete as the primary defenders for each Ancient Fortress.<br/><br/>The overall objective of each match is to battle through the opposing force's defenses, in order to arrive at and destroy the opponents' Ancient Fortress. Because Dota 2 is highly team-oriented, players must coordinate with their teams in order to achieve victory. The towers and stronghold defenses are invulnerable to attacks so long as the towers nearest to the enemy side still stand. Periodically, groups of weaker units commonly referred to as &quot;creeps&quot; are spawned, which move along their lane attacking any enemy unit or structure upon sight.<br/><br/>The currency of the game is gold, which is granted periodically, but typically accumulates at a more practical level by killing enemy units, which grants a distributed amount of gold to the killer's team, with the greater portion being retained by the killer themselves. A common technique utilized to prevent the opposing faction from accumulating gold from a kill is &quot;denying&quot;, which constitutes killing an allied unit or destroying an allied structure and can be employed when the unit or structure it is about to be used on is close to death or collapse, respectively. Players also gain experience, which accumulates to gain higher levels. The greatest proportion of gold and experience comes from destroying higher priority forces, such as enemy heroes and towers.<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;Dota 2&quot;, available under the

In each game, players must push the controller's action button at the right time in order to successfully connect with the target. In the case of Football Passing, for example, points are scored for a successful forward pass, with no points scored if the receiver doesn't catch the ball.

Once he stops, all other players lose 100 points for each skull showing.<br/><br/>Before a player starts to roll for his turn, however, he draws a card from the pirate deck, which affects what's possible on that turn: He might score double for the treasure he collects, or need to roll sabers to fight off other pirates, or receive a free diamond or gold coin, or be able to score treasure even if he collect three skulls.<br/><br/>Once a player reaches 6,000 points, all other players take one final turn, then the player with the most points wins.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": ["AMIGO Czech/Slovak edition", "AMIGO German second edition", "Gigamic French third edition", "Giochi Uniti Italian edition", "Kaissa Greek second edition", "Kikigagne French edition 2013", "Shafir Hebrew/English first edition"], "age": "8", "name": "Piraten kapern", "playingtime": "30", "boardgamemechanic": ["Dice Rolling", "Press Your Luck", "Set Collection"], "average": "6.31911", "usersrated": "460", "boardgamefamily": ["AMIGO  dice games in box"]}, "117664": {"boardgamedesigner": ["Jason Fox", "Bob Kuhn", "Grant Sarber"], "poll": [], "name": "Proto-Typical", "playingtime": "0", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": ["Hand Management", "Set Collection"], "yearpublished": "2012", "usersrated": "0", "maxplayers": "8", "boardgamefamily": ["Crowdfunding: Kickstarter"], "average": "0", "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["MeatyOre Press"], "boardgameversion": ["First Edition"], "maxplaytime": "0", "boardgamecategory": ["Card Game", "Industry / Manufacturing"], "age": "0", "minplaytime": "0", "description": "&quot;The A-Typical Card Game of B-list Inventions&quot;<br/><br/>Proto-Typical is a &quot;Simply Epic, Free-Market Parody.&quot;  Everyone knows that what the world needs now is MORE STUFF!

Throughout the Wangan are several exits which can lead to hotspots - where Wangan races can be started, touges, Car Dealerships, tune shops, and Robo-Garages. These garages were featured in the movie The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift. There are 8 different dealerships where vehicles can be purchased: Nissan dealership, Mitsubishi dealership, Mazda dealership, Honda dealership, Toyota dealership, Subaru dealership, Lexus dealership, and a U.S. Naval Base - where according to the instruction booklet included with the game, cars are brought over by stationed soldiers who end up selling them or are just imported.

In Streetwise, Kyle roams the streets of his hometown, doing detective work, on the search for his captured brother. Kyle will run into familiar faces, as well as new ones.<br/><br/>Kyle and Cody Travers are brothers who take part in the sport of underground fighting. As Cody Travers' younger brother, Kyle is the star of the underground Metro City fight club, spending nights fighting various other fighters in order to earn enough quick cash to make ends meet. After the end of a fight one evening, Kyle and Cody decide to meet at the local bar to celebrate with some beers and a round of pool; however, Cody has some unspoken business that delays his arrival for an hour. After Kyle arrives at the bar, he plays a game with his girlfriend and bar owner Vanessa Simms, while waiting for Cody. Kyle later finds out that Cody is using a powerful strength-enhancing drug called &quot;glow&quot;, which helps the arthritis in his knees. Kyle later discovers that glow is being made by a psychotic priest named Father Bella, who hopes to use the drug to bring about the apocalypse. When Kyle finds Bella on the roof of his church, Cody is with him, mutated by a concentrated dose of glow. It is later revealed that Bella is actually the younger brother of Belger, the antagonist of the original game, just before he and Kyle begin to fight.<br/><br/>During the battle, Cody regains his senses, and throws himself and Bella off the roof. In the courtyard of the church where both Bella and Cody have landed from the fall and survived, Bella reaches for his handgun but is stopped by Kyle. He says to Kyle &quot;I am your savior,&quot; but Kyle picks up the gun, telling Bella, &quot;You're nothing.&quot; Kyle then shoots Bella in the head. Afterward he finds Cody unconscious from the fall.<br/><br/>Some time later, Kyle and Cody wake up in the hospital, where they meet with Vanessa who holds onto her late brother's badge. Cody's arthritis is now gone and he seems eager to resume fighting. Kyle notices Dr. Chang leaving the police station on the local news and mentions he has a feeling this might not be over quite yet.<br/><br/>The game&rsquo;s protagonist is Kyle Travers, brother of Cody Travers from the original Final Fight. He is a 27-year-old former Marine who has lived on the streets of Metro City, along with Cody, since childhood. Coming from a broken family, Kyle was brought up by his brother, who taught him how to survive life on the streets and earn respect. Haggar reveals that Kyle was a troublemaker and hoodlum prior to joining the military, calling him a &quot;skinny legged punk&quot;. Later, as a skilled hand-to-hand fighter, Kyle uses his talent to support himself in the local pit fighting club. He goes in search of Cody after he is abducted from Kyle&rsquo;s girlfriend&rsquo;s bar. His girlfriend, Vanessa Sims, and her brother, Sergeant Sims, aid Kyle in his search by providing him with information as they get it.<br/><br/>Enemies included Andore and Cammy. The game&rsquo;s antagonist is Father Bella. He has been distributing a new drug called GLOW throughout Metro City. It is later revealed that he is the younger brother of Belger, the antagonist of the original Final Fight.<br/><br/>Poison, a controversial male-to-female transsexual character from original Final Fight and Final Fight Revenge, was originally planned to be in the game. This fact is known, because there is some concept art of Poison, which shows her with red hair, which originally belonged to her pallet swap, Roxy. It is unknown what role she was supposed to play in the game, including whether she was supposed to be an enemy or not.

This game also supports EyeToy: Cameo, allowing players to place their own face on a driver when creating their profile, but unlike F1 04, you cannot choose your own helmet. The cover athletes are Jenson Button, David Coulthard and Narain Karthikeyan.<br/><br/>Players start out testing for a smaller teams (Minardi, Jordan and Red Bull Racing (Like in F1 04, a generic car does exist, but it is only used in Time Attack mode)). Players then work their way up the grid throughout their 'career' through a mixture of good tests and impressive race performances. As before, consistently poor performances will lead to dismissal from the player's current team. There are also occasional 'shoot-out' tests against the team's second driver (or third driver, depending on the player's current status within the team), in which both drivers complete a set of five laps each and whoever has the fastest overall time (one time based on the fastest first, second and third sectors added together) then takes the race seat. Players can now also view trophies they have received from winning races and championships after each is won in Career Mode for the first time.<br/><br/>As with F1 04, &quot;classic&quot; cars (like the Williams FW11) are unlocked once certain terms are fulfilled, such as winning a World Championship. Helmets for Career Mode are also unlocked, and there is also a hidden track (the Detroit street circuit which was used for Detroit Grand Prix and the Paul Ricard circuit in France([citation needed])) available for Time Attack Mode. Notably, since this game was developed before the change in the qualifying regulations midway through the actual 2005 season, this game runs the original &quot;aggregated times&quot; format from the early part of the actual 2005 season in every race in Race Weekend, Championship and Career Mode. This game also has Net Play available. A notable credit is the opening video features the song &quot;Butterflies &amp; Hurricanes&quot; from English alternative rock band Muse.<br/><br/>For the first time in a number of years, the fans agreed that this was a massive improvement in the series and the shot in the arm it had so desperately needed. A lot of people had criticised Studio Liverpool for the lack of ambition and progress since the series appeared on the PS2 platform up to that point. With the release of Formula One 05, people saw that great strides had been made by Studio Liverpool in terms of gameplay handling and AI.<br/><br/>However, there were criticisms in terms of the AI being too easy on the hardest of settings, and about the penalty system that had been introduced on Formula One 05 which automatically reduced the revs during a penalty instead of the traditional &quot;drive-through&quot; penalties that previous games had seen. Overall though, the fans agreed that apart from these minor issues, Studio Liverpool had redeveloped the brand as a stepping stone for improvement for the inevitable release of the 2006 edition.<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;Formula One 05&quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "117745": {"rpgdesigner": ["John Fraser"], "rpgitemversion": ["PDF Version"], "poll": [], "name": "Complete Races", "rpgartist": ["Rick Hershey", "Shaman's Stockart"], "rpgproducer": ["Jeremy Smith"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2356424.png", "usersrated": "0", "rpgsetting": ["Third Dawn Campaign Setting"], "average": "0", "statistics": [], "rpg": ["d20 System / OGL Product (D&D 3.5 Compatible)"], "rpgpublisher": ["Dreamscarred Press"], "rpgcategory": ["Sourcebook (rules/options to enhance play)"], "rpggenre": ["Fantasy"], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2356424_t.png", "description": "Publisher's blurb:<br/><br/>Design the races you want with this new release from John Fraser, the author of Complete Control: Character Design for the Uninhibited.

The game was played using the online service of Square Enix Co., Ltd., PlayOnline. A beta version of Front Mission: Online was released on November 2004. Like other Front Mission titles, Front Mission: Online is part of a serialized storyline that follows the stories of various characters and their struggles involving mecha known as wanzers.<br/><br/>As a massively multiplayer online (MMO), third-person shooter spin-off, the gameplay of Front Mission: Online differs from the tactical role-playing game entries of the numbered Front Mission titles. Rather than being played out on a grid-based map and using a turn-based structure, battles takes place in real-time on full 3D maps akin to Armored Core. The player controls a mech known as the Wanderpanzer, or wanzer. Players in Online can play alone, or in groups of up to 20 players. The game has built-in support for VoIP, which can be used to communicate with other players.<br/><br/>Game progression in Online works differently from other Front Mission entries. As an MMO, players have complete control over how they want to play the game. When a player creates an account, they will be asked to choose a side to fight for - the Oceania Cooperative Union (O.C.U.) or the United States of the New Continent (U.S.N.). Next, the player must create a character to play as; character creation in Online works similarly to character creation methods found in other MMOs. Once a character has been created, the player can then begin playing the game. There are two modes of play - PvE or PvP. In PvE mode, players do battle against enemies controlled by AI. In PvP mode, players do battle against other players of the game.<br/><br/>The PvE mode of Online is unique in that like the other Front Mission titles, there is a storyline that the player can play through. After the player completes a certain amount of missions, they can participate in military operations, which are a series of missions. These military operations progress the storyline. Furthermore, there are limited-time only operations which are open to all players. Unlike missions, military operations are one-time only events and cannot be replayed. The PvP mode of Online, on the other hand, does not have any story elements. Players pick a battle zone on Huffman Island and fight on it, with the winning side taking control of the zone. Battle zones affect the type of missions that a player can go through in PvE mode. For example, if a U.S.N. military base is captured by O.C.U. forces, U.S.N. players can take a mission to recapture it. Likewise, U.S.N. players can take a mission to defend the base if it was not captured. There are many types of missions, ranging from simple destruction requests to more complex reconnaissance ones.<br/><br/>When a player is not currently involved in a mission or military operation, they are stationed at military bases and supply camps on Huffman Island. In here, they can customize their wanzers, purchase battle gear for their pilots, form groups with other players, or fight other players in the Arena to earn extra money and parts. Players can also defect to the other side if their combat proficiency is at a certain level.[2] Defecting players are demoted by one military rank and lose all of their items, except those that are equipped on their pilot and wanzer.[3] Wanzer customization in Online works differently from other Front Mission titles in that the parts, auxiliary backpacks, and weapons the player can access is entirely dependent on their military ranking. Military rankings work in a progression-based fashion; players must complete missions and military operations to advance in rank. A player can also raise their rank by scoring kills on computer-controlled enemies or players fighting for the other side.<br/><br/>Missions aside, Online boasts other new features as well as returning ones, particularly from Front Mission: Gun Hazard and Front Mission Alternative. The game introduces many new auxiliary backpacks and weapon types. A new kind of auxiliary backpack is the stealth backpack; this protects a wanzer from being detected on enemy radar and/or can render the invisible to the naked eye if an optical stealth backpack is used. The burst bazooka is a bazooka fires multiple bazooka rounds in quick succession; it has a high damage output, but is offset by its slow reload times. There are also hybrid shield/weapons that have both an offensive and a defensive feature. Returning features in Online include remodeling and Cockpit Mode. Once a player has reached a certain rank, they can add upgrades to their parts and weapons to make them more effective. Cockpit Mode, which allows players to control the action in a first-person view, has been expanded to allow for zooming in and zooming out of the battle camera. This allows for precision aiming and shooting, which is ideal for weapons such as sniper rifles and bazookas.<br/><br/>Front Mission: Online ended its services and was discontinued on May 31, 2008.<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;Front Mission Online&quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "117747": {"poll": [], "name": "Fullmetal Alchemist and the Broken Angel", "videogamemode": ["Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["Canadian PlayStation 2 edition", "Japanese PlayStation 2 edition", "North American PlayStation 2 edition"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2073600.jpg", "videogametheme": ["Anime"], "videogamefranchise": ["Fullmetal Alchemist"], "videogamedeveloper": ["Racjin Co., Ltd."], "videogamegenre": ["Action RPG"], "videogameplatform": ["PlayStation 2"], "usersrated": "1", "average": "6", "statistics": [], "videogamepublisher": ["Square Enix"], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2073600_t.jpg", "description": "Fullmetal Alchemist and the Broken Angel (\u92fc\u306e\u932c\u91d1\u8853\u5e2b \u7fd4\u3079\u306a\u3044\u5929\u4f7f Hagane no Renkinjutsushi: Tobenai Tenshi, lit. &quot;Alchemist of Steel: The Flightless Angel&quot;), features an original story by Hiromu Arakawa from the creator of the Fullmetal Alchemist manga. It is based on the Fullmetal Alchemist manga series, also published by Square Enix.<br/><br/>Taking place between episodes 17 and 18 of the anime, the game begins with the Elric brothers (somewhat unwillingly being escorted by Major Alex Louis Armstrong) heading to Central City via train. While Ed moans, Al consoles, and Armstrong flexes, the train is suddenly attacked by terrorists. The skirmish eventually ends with one destroyed train and the brothers in the town of New Heissgart, looking for a ride to Central. There, they meet a girl named Armony and learn more of the Philosopher's Catalyst, an item nearly as powerful as the Philosopher's Stone itself, but used to increase the efficiency of alchemy. The Philosopher's Catalyst seems to be directly linked with the berserk chimeras running about, the rogue military force, and the gathering of alchemists in the town. The Elrics soon find that their simple mission for a train turns into much more as they learn about the Catalyst and the dark mysteries surrounding it.<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;Fullmetal Alchemist and the Broken Angel&quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "117748": {"boardgamedesigner": ["Daniel Durandet"], "poll": [], "name": "Safari Parc", "playingtime": "60", "minplayers": "2", "yearpublished": "1977", "usersrated": "0", "boardgamefamily": ["Safari"], "maxplayers": "5", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1938938_t.png", "average": "0", "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["Nathan"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1938938.png", "boardgameversion": ["Nathan Edition 1977"], "maxplaytime": "60", "boardgamecategory": ["Animals", "Card Game", "Children's Game", "Travel", "Trivia"], "age": "8", "minplaytime": "60", "description": "In Safari Park, players try to become expert zoologists.

It is the prequel of sorts to Fullmetal Alchemist and the Broken Angel. The game has much improved visuals than the previous title, as well as all dialog being voiced over. To help boost sales, Square Enix decided to release the game with a bonus DVD in the United States containing the second and third episodes of season two (episode 27 &quot;Teacher&quot; and 28 &quot;One is All, All is One&quot;) of the Fullmetal Alchemist anime series, since the show took a four month break in its Adult Swim broadcast. This DVD contains only English audio, with the shortened version of the second opening theme song &quot;Ready Steady Go&quot; by L'Arc-en-Ciel and the shortened third ending &quot;Motherland&quot; by Crystal Kay.<br/><br/>The game begins with Edward and Alphonse arriving in the city of Lior to deal with Father Cornello and ask him about the Philosopher's Stone. However, just as soon as the two brothers defeat him, Father Cornello is pulled into a dark void and disappears. Edward notices a strange phantom-like woman hiding behind the statues watching the scene.<br/><br/>Shortly afterwards, after facing off against Bald, investigating Shou Tucker's home, battling Scar, Edward and Alphonse learn upon their arrival in their hometown of a frightening phenomenon sweeping Amestris; people in many regions are vanishing without a trace, supposedly spirited away by &quot;monsters&quot;. In Resembool, Edward and Alphonse meet an enigmatic alchemist named Jack Crowley and an entity called the Phantom. It seems that they have some connection with both the disappearances and the strange creatures (known as Golems) appearing around the countryside.<br/><br/>When Roy Mustang sends the brothers and Riza Hawkeye to investigate a village plagued by these monsters, they meet Arlen Glostner, an archaeologist who is studying the ancient civilization of Lebis. Edward and Alphonse soon find themselves headed for the ruins of Siam-Sid, the capital city of Lebis, to discover the truth behind the Golems and the puzzling disappearances.<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;Fullmetal Alchemist 2: Curse of the Crimson Elixir&quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "117750": {"poll": [], "name": "Futurama", "videogamemode": ["Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["English/European PlayStation 2 edition", "English/European Xbox edition", "North American PlayStation 2 edition", "North American Xbox edition"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2262030.png", "videogametheme": ["Cartoon", "Science Fiction"], "usersrated": "3", "videogamedeveloper": ["Unique Development Studios"], "videogamegenre": ["Platform"], "videogameplatform": ["PlayStation 2", "Xbox"], "average": "7.66667", "statistics": [], "videogamepublisher": ["Fox Interactive", "Vivendi Universal Games"], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2262030_t.png", "description": "Futurama is based on the science fiction cartoon series Futurama using cel-shading technology. Nintendo GameCube and Game Boy Advance games were planned for release, though they were cancelled due to a belief that their popularity was short-lived. Due to this, it was released on the Nintendo GameCube in Europe, although no physical proof of this has ever been found. The cutscenes of the game are presented as an entire &quot;lost episode&quot; of Futurama on the DVD of The Beast with a Billion Backs.<br/><br/>Gameplay is a mix of action and platforming. As the game progresses, players play as each of four characters: Fry, Bender, Leela and Zoidberg. Fry's levels mostly involve shooter mechanics, possibly based on the Ratchet and Clank series, as he can use a multitude of guns. Bender's levels are platformer-oriented, based on the Crash Bandicoot series, while Leela's revolve around hand to hand combat. Zoidberg features in a short segment that plays similarly to the warthog levels from Crash Bandicoot. There are several Nibblers hidden in each level; collecting them unlocks extras such as movie clips and galleries.<br/><br/>The game begins with Professor Farnsworth, wearing a sombrero, selling the Planet Express delivery company to Mom, explaining that it had been losing money for years due to mismanagement. The buyout gives Mom ownership of more than fifty percent of Earth, allowing her to become the supreme ruler of Earth. Soon after this, she enslaves humanity.<br/><br/>After Fry, Leela, Bender, and Farnsworth repair the inexplicably broken ship, they escape from Earth with the Professor's new invention, The Re-animator (which closely resembles a giant toaster), which brings the crew back to life every time they die. However, Mom pursues them in an effort to capture Farnsworth. She hopes to turn Earth into a giant warship, and Farnsworth is the only person who knows how to build an engine large enough to move the Earth. She ultimately captures Farnsworth, places his head in a jar, and sends the ship hurtling into the Sun with Fry, Leela, and Bender on board.<br/><br/>After discovering that the Sun is habitable, they help the Sun People, then head for the planet of Bogad, where Farnsworth&rsquo;s mentor, Adoy, lives. Adoy has invented a time machine, which he uses to send Fry, Leela and Bender back to a few minutes before Mom buys Planet Express from the Professor. However, the ship crashes into Planet Express, destroying the ship. This prompts them to steal the ship of the past, leaving the broken ship to be repaired by their past selves. They attempt to stop the sale, which prompts Mom to send Destructor to attack them. They defeat the robot, but the Re-animator gets damaged and falls on Destructor, causing it to fall on top of them. Angry at the fact that the robot killed his crew, the professor refuses to sell Planet Express.

No animals were hurt in the making of the Go Hunt card game.<br/><br/>Game play: With four or less players; seven cards are dealt to each player.  Five cards can be dealt to each player in larger groups.  The remaining cards are placed face down in a draw pile.  The player left of the dealer goes first.  On your turn, ask any player for a specific card.  For example: &quot;Michele do you have little hooters?&quot;  You must already hold one of the requested cards.  If Michele has any little hooter cards she must give them all to you.  If the person you ask does not have the card you requested, they would say &quot;Go Hunt!&quot;  You would then draw a card from the draw pile.  When the draw pile runs out, keep playing until all the cards have been made into matching sets.  When you collect a set of matching cards, immediately show the other players and place the cards face down in front of you.<br/><br/>Is is fair to lump all pair matching games together? Yes it has the same type of play as go fish, but the card images really make the game stand out. Playing basketball, and playing a game of HORSE is differant, for example in the game Go Hunt there is a card with an image of a fat beaver eating an apple, the card is called &quot;FAT BEAVER&quot;, now imagine this card and 15 others in play, would you ask your grandma if she had a &quot;FAT BEAVER&quot;, &quot;WET PUSS&quot; or even a &quot;LARGE COCK&quot;.<br/><br/>In conclusion if you have an inoccent soul and a naughty mind you&quot;ll have a blast playing the Go Hunt card game with your friends!<br/><br/>There are also variants of the Go Hunt game that are drinking games, so if your over 21 give them a try!<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": ["First edition"], "name": "Go Hunt", "playingtime": "20", "boardgamemechanic": ["Memory", "Set Collection", "Trading"], "average": "6.25", "usersrated": "4", "boardgamesubdomain": ["Party Games"], "age": "16"}, "117859": {"rpgartist": ["(Uncredited)"], "rpgitemversion": ["PDF version"], "poll": [], "name": "More Aliens!", "rpgdesigner": ["Steve Miller", "Owen K.C.

Parker called Chivalry &quot;the best game in 2,000 years,&quot; and looked upon it as his personal favorite.  Chivalry is played on a larger board with more pieces than Camelot.  Chivalry, like Camelot, is tactically complex, yet easily learned and quickly played.  It is a clever mixture of American Checkers (British Draughts) and Halma (Chinese Checkers).<br/><br/>The goals of the game is to move two pieces into the two goal spaces on the opposite side of the board. Of course, one has to get past the opponent's piece to do so. Movement of pieces in many ways resembles Checkers except that jumping and moving is omnidirectional.<br/><br/>This game tends to be dominated by key sacrifices and charges for the goal. Since a player has to get two pieces into the goal, the dynamic shifts from just trying to get a single piece into a goal.

They lay out five fields cards in a row to create the playing surface; each field card has a number on it. Each player randomly chooses one of his goal cards and places it face-down at one end of the field. Each goal card has a 1 on it. Players then get their cards and wait for the whistle.<br/><br/>At the same time, players start going through their decks, one card at a time. If a card is unplayable, the player places it face-up in one of two reserve stacks in front of him. A card is playable or not based on this restriction: Moving from left to right, players first need to play a 1 to cover their own goal, then they must play one or more cards that sum to the value on the leftmost field card. Once that card is covered, they play one or more cards that sum to the value on that field card. And so on.<br/><br/>When a player reaches the opponent's goal, he flips over that goal card to reveal a picture of a goalie and a ball entering the net. He then needs to mix together all of his discards and played cards, flip them over, and start looking card-by-card for four cards that can be fit together puzzle-style to resemble the picture on the back of the goal card. The first player to do this scores a goal and keeps the opponent's goal card; if he made a mistake anywhere, he scored an own goal, so the opponent gets a goal card from him.<br/><br/>Players then shuffle the cards and go at it once again.

There are many different stages from scenes of the franchise. Playable characters include Alex, Marty, Gloria, Melman, King Julien, Mason and Phil, or all four of the penguins. The Madagascar Kartz Wheel is bundled with the Wii version of the game. This wheel is optional. This wheel's look is different from that of the Wii Wheel from Mario Kart Wii.<br/>Playable characters include Alex the Lion, Marty the Zebra, Melman the Giraffe, Gloria the Hippotamus, The Penguins, The Chimps, and King Julien from the Madagascar. Two characters from other movies are included alongside the Madacascar, Shrek from Shrek, and B.O.B. from Monsters vs. Aliens, all Dreamworks franchises. Race types include Quick Race, Championship, Time Trial and Checkpoint race. A Championship race is one where the player collects mangoes and tries to finish first place in order to unlock higher speed classes (50cc, 100cc, 150cc, 200cc, the last one is raced in reverse direction/mirror mode), more karts and tracks. In Time Trial, players beat their own times and earn medals (gold, silver and bronze). In Checkpoint Race, players collect as many hourglasses as they can before the time runs out. There are several tracks in the game. Also, in a track, most tracks have 2 shortcuts. &quot;I Like to Move It&quot;, sung by Reel 2 Real, is the menu theme.

Naturally, the most powerful families in Edo immediately try to curry favor with the new Shogun &ndash; and this is the opportunity our clan has been looking for, our chance at power and glory. Our clan will prove ourselves to be indispensable to the new Shogun. We will work from the shadows to acquire information about our rival clans. We will kidnap those who might oppose our ascent and assassinate those who prove a threat. We will use cunning to prevent our adversaries from doing the same to us.

The object of the game is to amass Prestige Points, mainly by completing missions. To do so, players must gather the necessary assets and &ndash; most importantly &ndash; outfox their opponents and prevent them from completing their missions.<br/><br/>There are several ways to reach your goal. Will you try to complete as many missions as possible and hope that your efforts catch the Shogun's eye? Or will you choose a more subtle way of gaining power by trying to influence the Shogun during a private audience? You can also put your rivals to shame by buying lots of luxury goods from the European merchants.

It is possible to play via Internet without any additional game fees on the BATTLE ISLE Internet server.<br/><br/>In the tradition of the BATTLE ISLE series, the tactical aspects of the game are carried out in turn-based mode. In contrast to a pure real- time strategy, this allows not only more game depth but also more lavish graphic effects, zooms and camera chases, immersing the player in every event. Light conditions change during the course of the day. The weather, the seasons and even the tides play a key role in producing goods and planning tactics and strategy. A core component of the strategy in THE ANDOSIA WAR involves securing the necessary resources and carefully planning how they are to be used. Raw materials must be collected; factories, research facilities and power plants have to be built and transportation systems have to be created.

As an added bonus, author Sam Hing has put together an awesome set of fey-related magic items, spells, and feats to round out your wicked wise women.<br/><br/>While fey are classically considered to be most dryads and fauns, perhaps knights of some otherworldly Fairy Court, there are many cases of spirits tied to specific locations or ideas from mythology that could be considered to be &quot;fey&quot; in rules terms. This product looks at both some examples of such creatures in mythology and some niches common to fantasy roleplaying game campaigns, and posits what kinds of faeries would be attached to them. The end result is a whole new set of foes ranging in power from CR 2 (the glade maiden) to CR 10 (the river mother), ready to force the PCs to fight, flee, or negotiate.<br/><br/>So stay out of the fairy-rings, put some milk out on the sill, and keep your cold iron handy.

Reporters who seek to uncover the truth, scientists who wish to discover the fundamental laws of nature, inventors who want to create new devices, and even physicians who seek to understand diseases and heal the sick are all examples of investigators. Investigators apply knowledge and intelligence the way warriors apply brute force, as their primary tool in overcoming challenges. In so doing, they are often able to solve an extremely broad range of problems.<br/><br/>Of course investigators are often asking questions others would prefer go unanswered. Such inquiries can make enemies, and often have consequences. Occasionally tracking down murderers in the dark alleys of Whitechapel, deciphering Babylonian books bound in human skin, experimenting with alien technology, or asking too many questions about mysterious cults, create such bizarre consequences the investigators end up in fantasy realms where the mysteries are far more deadly, and the resources at their disposal much more primitive.<br/><br/>The &ldquo;modern&rdquo; person of great education and intellect being stuck in a more primitive, fantasy-themed world is a common trope in a great deal of adventure fiction, especially the &ldquo;time travel adventure fiction&rdquo; more common in the early part of the 20th century than today, but still very popular with a wide range of gamers (and game writers). The investigator is the second in a line of Anachronistic Adventurers products designed to provide rules for running modern (or near-modern) heroes in a typical fantasy roleplaying game setting. While it&rsquo;s impossible to address every possible issue that might arise for such characters (can the adherent of a modern, real-world religion become a cleric?), each product in the line will look at one area where the modern and fantasy realms are most likely to overlap and give guidance for running heroic anachronisms.<br/><br/>We also discuss some rules useful in dealing with the detective tropes common to fiction in a number of genres, including gathering clues, preventing investigations from taking over a campaign, making sure a bad die roll never brings a mystery adventure to a total standstill, and the advantages of advanced scientific knowledge. Finally we touch on the idea of Progress Levels (PL), a simple way to determine the general technological advancement of a campaign (and outlined in more detail in Anachronistic Adventurers: The Enforcer).<br/><br/>"}, "117980": {"poll": [], "name": "Alcatraz II: The Doomsday Mission", "videogamemode": ["Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["English/European ZX Spectrum edition"], "average": "0", "videogameseries": ["Alcatraz Harry"], "videogametheme": ["Crime"], "usersrated": "0", "videogamedeveloper": ["Scorpio Gamesworld Ltd"], "videogamegenre": ["Action Adventure", "Arcade", "Puzzle"], "videogameplatform": ["ZX Spectrum"], "statistics": [], "videogamepublisher": ["Scorpio Gamesworld Ltd"], "description": "User Summary<br/><br/>This game picked up where part I ended.

The British attempted to reduce a poorly-defended German salient centered on the town of Neuve Chapelle. Plans were to expand a breakthrough and with cavalry and infantry reserves take the Aubers ridge line. However, poor communication and coordination and the weather conspired to slow the initial British successes and allowed the German army to rush reinforcements into the area. Among other game features, designer Michael W. Kennedy uses offensive artillery and defensive artillery fire, British command checks, and a unique assault combat mechanic to simulate the bloody struggle. (Sourced from the White Dog Games website.)<br/><br/>The game is played over a series of 14 turns which represent the three days of The Battle of Neuve Chapelle. Each day is divided into four turns with a separate night turn in between. During the day turns, both sides will fire artillery (weather permitting), move, and attack. During the night turns, both sides will dig in new trenches on the new front lines.<br/><br/>The game simulates early trench warfare and makes prominent use of artillery and the defensive advantages of trenches. Weather conditions and British communications among the four divisions are determined randomly each turn. Each assault phase contains a defensive artillery and defensive combat phase, making defense a major component of the game.<br/><br/>There are several hexes that have victory point values. The British win by controlling as many of these hexes as possible. The Germans win by preventing the British from achieving this objectives.<br/><br/>"}, "117983": {"rpgartist": ["Russ Ackred", "Tyler Clark", "Elizabeth Courts", "Jessica Door", "Katie Ellis", "Aaron Filipowich", "Crystal Frasier", "Silvia Gonzalez", "Mauricio Herrera", "Frank Hessefort", "Chris Leaper", "Elizabeth Lindhag", "Dave Mallon", "Stephen McAndrews", "Jonathan Roberts", "Isaac Royo", "Tanya Sangsnit", "Hugo Solis", "Ashton Sperry", "Matthew Stinson", "Carlos Torreblanca", "Todd Westcot"], "statistics": [], "name": "Wayfinder (Issue 6 - Winter 2011)", "rpgdesigner": ["Clinton Boomer", "Craig Cartin", "Kalyna Conrad", "Ryan Costello, Jr.", "Rich Crotty", "Christopher Delvo", "Danielle Doss", "Keith Doughty", "Russell Estes", "Robert Feather", "Dawn Fischer", "Guy Fox", "Robert Gresham", "Nick Herold", "Eric Hindley", "Jeff Lee", "Rob Little", "Nicholas Milasich", "Kevin A.

Some special abilities make basic actions better, such as reducing the costs of Starbase upgrades or allowing the player to trade a resource of their choice at 2:1 for a turn, while others break rules, such as protecting the player from discarding on a 7 or producing a resource when the player rolls a number that wouldn't otherwise produce for them. Players get a specific Support Card during setup based on turn order, with later players getting generally more useful abilities to compensate for early player advantage.

Animals features six different animals, with the sizes of animals varying from one card to another. Any two cards have exactly one animal in common. To play, reveal one card, then another. Whoever spots the animal in common on both cards claims the first card, then another card is revealed for players to search, and so on.<br/><br/>Whoever has collected the most cards when the deck runs out wins!<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": ["Alphabet edition", "Cars edition 2016", "Chinese/English first edition", "Dobble edition 2016", "English first edition", "English first edition", "English first edition", "Finding Dory edition 2016", "French first edition", "German first edition", "Hungarian First Edition", "Numbers & Shapes edition", "Polish 1 2 3 edition", "Polish Cars edition", "Polish Dory edition", "Polish first edition"], "average": "6.33463", "name": "Spot it Jr.!

Players Draft their Fighters in secret. Actions are resolved using Blackjack but the players play versus each other instead of a dealer. The players are gamblers who create electronic avatars to fight in a virtual arena. Players may use the included Fighters, or create a custom Fighter using a combination of Abilities and Gear. Players also have a Cheat which breaks the rules and an Exploit which gives your Fighter a huge short term boost. Momemtum Tokens are earned for successfully attacking and defending and can be used to increase a Fighter's Abilities.<br/><br/>Game Flow:<br/>Players may have their Fighter Run or Attack on their turn. If they Attack, the player may wager points  on the Attack, if the Attack hits, it deals additional damage based upon the size of the wager. If the Attack misses, the wager is lost. Attack damage is also modified by weapon type and a random damage element based upon margin of success.<br/><br/>When a Fighter runs out of points they die. A Buy In oppurtunity allows players to bring their Fighter back into the Arena. In the end the last Fighter standing in the Arena wins the match.<br/><br/>An additional copy of Battlejack may be used at the same to increase the number of players from 2-4 to 5-8.<br/><br/>"}, "117999": {"rpgdesigner": ["J\u00fcrgen E.

With the money they earn, they can buy adventure cards that earn them precious antiques. Africana features the &quot;Book of Adventures&quot; game system from Schacht's Valdora in which players can acquire cards that are laid out like books, with players &quot;turning the pages&quot; to find the adventure cards they most want.<br/><br/>The game board in Africana shows the continent divided in half at the equator, with the cities in the north half colored brown and the cities in the south white. Adventure cards with a brown border can be acquired only in the south and must be delivered to the north, while white-bordered adventure cards take the opposite route. Five expedition cards &ndash; each showing the starting and ending location and a reward for completing the expedition &ndash; are laid face-up on the game board.<br/><br/>Each player has one researcher token that will travel around the board, and on a turn a player takes one of three possible actions:<br/><br/><br/>    Draw two travel cards. (A player can have no more than five travel cards in hand at turn's end.)<br/>    Buy one or more adventure cards, for five coins each. A player can flip one page in the book for free, with each additional flip costing one coin. (A player can have no more than three adventure cards to be fulfilled at turn's end.)<br/>    Move the researcher by paying travel cards that match the color of the space being traveled to. Each player has a joker in hand, which will be retained at the end of each turn. If a player moves onto the start space of an expedition, he can mark that expedition card with a marker; if he reaches the destination for an expedition he's on, he receives the reward depicted and claims the card, while anyone else on the expedition receives nothing. A new expedition card is then revealed.<br/><br/><br/>When a player reaches the destination shown on an adventure card, that player scores that card by placing it under his player mat. Some cards show helpers, which are represented by helper cards in a player's hand. These cards allow travel on the color shown on the card and return to the player's hand after use, but a player who employs many helps will lose points at the end of the game.<br/><br/>Once the expedition cards run out, the game ends and players score for the expeditions they completed, sets of identical and different adventure cards, money in hand, and a few other things. The player with the most points wins!<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": ["Czech/Slovak first edition", "English first edition", "French first edition", "German first edition", "Nordic first edition"], "average": "6.795", "name": "Africana", "playingtime": "60", "boardgamemechanic": ["Card Drafting", "Pick-up and Deliver", "Point to Point Movement", "Set Collection"], "age": "8", "boardgameexpansion": ["139163"], "usersrated": "1040", "boardgamesubdomain": ["Family Games"], "boardgamefamily": ["Cities: Lagos", "Continent: Africa", "Country: Nigeria"]}}
