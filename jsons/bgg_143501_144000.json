Players are put upon the highest bench of an European monarchy, assuming the leadership of a major European Power, and struggle to achieve the global supremacy all over the world in the Age of Absolutism. Being so an absolute monarch, each player will have to manage every kind of matters: economy, politics, diplomacy, trade, world wide exploration, colonization, religion and warfare.<br/><br/>Age of Monarchs is designed to offer an accurate and detailed historical context, supported by more than 160 strategy cards that simulate the most outstanding historical events and force players to face constantly the toughest challenges that occurred during the three centuries covered by the game timeline.<br/><br/>The game offers a wide set of short scenarios and a Grand Campaign 1492-1789, spanning for 20 turns, that will put the most powerful European nations in the never ending struggle for world domination.<br/><br/>This is the complete list of Scenarios:<br/><br/>&bull; 1492-1559 Age of Exploration<br/>&bull; 1560-1618 Wars of Religion<br/>&bull; 1619-1667 Thirty Years War<br/>&bull; 1668-1730 Age of Absolutism<br/>&bull; 1698-1789 Wars of Supremacy<br/><br/>In Age of Monarchs players take the role of the absolute monarch of a Major Power. Monarchs are represented by Strategy Cards that reproduce historical characters (plus some generic ones), each with designed abilities that affect game rules. The game manages also the aging of Monarchs, that are substituted by new kings, crowned after their predecessor is dead, so allowing players to handle a line of succession in the monarchy of their Powers.<br/><br/>Strategy Cards are the core of the game, they provide Command Points that allow players to perform all Game Actions, but they also introduce the most outstanding historical events of the Modern Age, such as the Protestant Reform and the Wars of Religion, the birth of Holland (United Provinces) and the Eighty Years war with Spain, the rise and decline of the Portuguese and Spanish colonial Empires, the Thirty Years War, the rush of the Russian Empire to Siberia and the Great Northern Wars, the growth of the Ottoman Empire and the wars with Christianity, the Wars of Succession, the birth of USA, etc. etc.<br/><br/>Game Actions allow players to perform activities in all matters, just to summarize some:<br/><br/>Warfare: the game has a light military system, players can rapidly move or redeploy forces, engage land battles, resolve sieges and naval combats. Supply mechanics are really simple. Leaders play a fundamental role in game-play, either as Generals, Admirals or Conquistadors.<br/>Diplomacy: many Minor Nations are present in the game, all players can influence these Minors to get Alliances and Vassals, so benefiting the military support of them during conflicts.<br/>Exploration, Colonization and Trade: the game recreates the race of Powers to build Colonial Empires all over the world. New colonies bring income from the exploitation of exotic resources and gold. The game allows player also to affect the price of exotic goods in order to speculate on price fluctuations. Also, gold can have a strong impact on European economy because of Inflation!<br/>Economy: players must pay attention to the budget of their Powers. At the end of each turn, players perform some short and rapid calculations to determine the budget balance of their Monarchies, based on revenues (taxes, colonial incomes, trade) and costs (maintenance of forces). The game has also the concept of Prosperity, measuring the richness of each Power, strongly affected by the length and outcome of wars.<br/><br/>Game overview:<br/><br/>&bull; Complexity: 6 / 10<br/>&bull; Game length: 5+ hours<br/>&bull; Number of players: 3-6<br/>&bull; Time scale: about 10 years per turn<br/>&bull; Solitaire suitability: low<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "3", "boardgameversion": ["First edition"], "age": "12", "name": "Age of Monarchs", "playingtime": "240", "boardgamemechanic": ["Action Point Allowance System", "Area Control / Area Influence", "Campaign / Battle Card Driven", "Point to Point Movement"], "average": "7", "usersrated": "5", "boardgamefamily": ["Age of Kings", "Cities: Ravenna (Italy)"]}, "143506": {"rpgartist": ["Aaron Acevedo", "James Denton", "Jason Engle", "Alida Saxon", "Tomasz Tworek"], "rpgitemversion": ["PDF Version"], "statistics": [], "name": "Shaintar: Legends Arise", "rpghonor": ["2014 ENnie for Best Rules - Nominee"], "rpgproducer": ["Clint Black", "Barry Goldblum", "Shane Lacy Hensley", "Norm Hensley", "Sean Preston", "Carinn Seabolt"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1678748.png", "usersrated": "1", "rpgsetting": ["Shaintar"], "rpgdesigner": ["Sean Patrick Fannon"], "average": "8", "rpggenre": ["Fantasy (High Fantasy)"], "rpgpublisher": ["Evil Beagle Games"], "rpg": ["Savage Worlds"], "rpgcategory": ["Campaign Setting (game world)", "Sourcebook (rules/options to enhance play)"], "poll": [], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1678748_t.png", "description": "[Taken from the introductory text and publisher site.]<br/>This is the full book, complete with all Player and Game Master information for Novice to Veteran play!<br/><br/>Sean Patrick Fannon&rsquo;s vision of Epic High Fantasy comes to life for Savage Worlds Deluxe in this all new iteration brought to you by Evil Beagle Games.<br/><br/>Savage Worlds Deluxe fans will find a lot to love about Shaintar: Legends Arise:<br/><br/><br/>     Eleven distinctive Races with many specialized Racial Edges for each.<br/>     Over 60 new Edges, including Professional, Combat, and Power Edges.<br/>     Expanded options for magic, including Applications for Sorcery, Extended Casting, and more.<br/>     New and expanded rules for Alchemists and Artificers, as well as personalized magic items.<br/>     Setting rules like All Out Move, the Deep Magic, and Lead from the Front.<br/>     Information about the many nations and factions that drive the stories of Shaintar.<br/>     A complete Timeline featuring thousands of years of Shaintar's history.<br/>     A Denizens section with many dozens of characters and monsters, as well as five new Monstrous Templates and templates for changing almost any Denizen to any of the eleven Races.<br/>     An expanded Weapons, Armor, and Gear list for epic fantasy gaming, as well as a Resource system to replace &quot;counting coins&quot; for wealth management.<br/>     Extensive advice about Game Mastering an Epic High Fantasy setting.<br/>     Three Legendary Tales, &quot;Countering the Terrror,&quot; &quot;Red Store Rising,&quot; and &quot;Return to Honor, Return to Glory.&quot;<br/><br/><br/>Anyone seeking Epic High Fantasy adventure will enjoy this book, as will anyone wishing to add lots of great new material to their Savage games!<br/><br/>This book covers Novice through Veteran Rank gaming.

Two to four players begin the game by choosing an ability-granting Role Card and starting in the United States. Players roll a die to initiate the zombie threat, represented by horde tokens of strengths 1 through 4 placed in zones around the board. Special &quot;grey zones&quot; represent lack of intel by featuring face-down tokens with zombie hordes of unknown strengths. Throughout the game, players travel to different zones and battle the zombie hordes in those locations by rolling dice and adding effects of Combat Cards.<br/><br/>The game features a die-based combat system. Humans always roll a six-sided die, while the hordes are represented by either a six-, eight-, ten-, or twelve-sided die depending on their strength. Humans may modify their role or add additional effects by playing Combat Cards, which consist of reusable Weapons (including Lobos, slang for &quot;Lobotomizers&quot;) and one-shot Tactics (like Booby Traps or Redeployment). Every time a human wins a battle, the zombie horde strength decreases by one level, while victories for zombies cause players to discard Combat Cards. At the end of each turn, humans draw a Threat Escalation card to reveal how the zombie threat has grown.<br/><br/>Though players start the game working together against the zombies, when a player loses all his Combat cards, he becomes one of the undead. Player-zombies can manipulate the hordes on the board to attack other humans and to escalate the zombie threat.<br/><br/>The game ends after a predetermined number of rounds based on the number of players (six rounds for four players, seven for three, and eight for two). At the end of the game, if more than ten total zombie hordes of strength 3 or 4 still remain on the map, the humans lose (and any zombie players win).

Position the Flagship in tactical orbit! And reconfigure that Battlestation into something new! Your fleet of loyal ships, powered by the might of quantum  probability itself, carries your empire to the far-flung stars. How will history remember you? As a ravenous destroyer? A clever tactician? A dauntless explorer? Command your armada, construct world-shattering technologies, and rally the remnants of humanity for a final confrontation.<br/><br/>In Quantum, each player is a fleet commander from one of the four factions of humanity, struggling to conquer a sector of space. Every die is a starship, with the value of the die determining the movement of the ship, but also its combat power - with low numbers more powerful. So a [ 6 ] is a quick but fragile Scout and a [ 1 ] is a slow but mighty Battlestation.<br/><br/>Each type of ship also has a special power that can be used once per turn: Destroyers can warp space to swap places with other dice and Flagships can transport other ships. These powers can be used in combination for devastating effects. You're not stuck with your starting ships, however: using Quantum technology, you can spend actions to transform (re-roll) your ships. Randomness plays a role in the game, but only when you want: Quantum is very much a strategy game.<br/><br/>You win by constructing Quantum Cubes - massive planetary energy extractors. Each time you build a new one, you can expand your fleet, earn a new permanent ability, or take a one-time special move. The board itself is made out of modular tiles, and you can play on one of the 30 layouts that come with the game or design your own. The ship powers, player abilities, and board designs combine to create a limitless set of possibilities for how to play and strategies for how to win.<br/><br/>With elegant mechanics, an infinity of scenarios, and easy-to-learn rules that lead to deep gameplay, Quantum is a one-of-a-kind game of space combat, strategy and colonization that will satisfy both hard-core and casual players.<br/><br/>Quantum won the 2012 Game Design Award at the IndieCade Festival of Independent Games, as a prototype game with the title Armada d6.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": ["English first edition", "English second edition", "French first edition", "Italian first edition", "Spanish first edition"], "name": "Quantum", "playingtime": "60", "boardgamemechanic": ["Area Control / Area Influence", "Dice Rolling", "Grid Movement", "Modular Board", "Variable Player Powers"], "age": "13", "boardgameexpansion": ["188030", "149799"], "usersrated": "4296", "boardgamesubdomain": ["Abstract Games", "Strategy Games"], "average": "7.3477", "boardgamepodcastepisode": ["Dukes of Dice Podcast - Ep. 04 - Dukes in Spaaace!", "Episode 18: The one about clever dice and reprints vs. new editions", "Episode 25 - What Do Those \u201cX\u2019s\u201d Stand for, Again?", "Episode 25 -- The Timed Depth of Simple Complexity", "Episode 41 -- Lightning Table Clearance Round", "Episode 7 - Spiel des Jahres", "Episode 72 March Craziness Dice Game Style Part 1", "Essen 2013 - Quantum", "Strange Assembly 138 - Remember Me", "The Boardgame Review Room: Quantum", "The Game Pit: Episode 15.2 - Council Chamber Essen Review", "Travis Gets Heavy - Episode 5 - Harold Buchanan Interview"]}, "143520": {"boardgamedesigner": ["Payton Lee"], "poll": [], "name": "Monster Mansion", "playingtime": "45", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": ["Area Movement", "Time Track", "Trading"], "yearpublished": "2013", "usersrated": "68", "boardgamefamily": ["Crowdfunding: Kickstarter"], "maxplayers": "8", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2258335_t.png", "average": "6.22224", "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["Chancegamer LLC."], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2258335.png", "boardgameversion": ["English first edition"], "maxplaytime": "45", "boardgamecategory": ["Adventure", "Bluffing", "Fantasy", "Real-time"], "age": "12", "minplaytime": "45", "description": "Monster Mansion is a real-time social-adventure with hidden roles and deduction.

All of his or her Summons can take their Action as well (Buying, Playing, Summons, Summon Actions, Relics, and Spells are explained below in their sections).<br/><br/>If you decide to play Limitless Mode, each player can Buy and Play as many cards as they can afford, along with each Summon taking its action. These games change the strategy up a bit, but be aware that in Limitless Mode, player turns tend to take longer, which will make the game itself takaware take more time.<br/><br/>On the table you will have an ENERGY deck (where you can draw extra energy cards), a GUARDIAN deck (cheap units that add to your defense), a DIMENSIONAL outcast deck (also cheap units that add your attack) and the BUYING deck where all the rest of the cards are added (creatures, spells, instants). You may have up to 5 creatures and 4 relics on the table at any time. Also 5 cards from the BUYING deck are drawn and placed face up on to shape the BUYING POOL.<br/><br/>Each turn you can buy creatures, draw energies and attack the opponent with creatures you already summoned on the previous turn, spells on the table or instant effects.<br/><br/>What is really great is that creatures in this game also count with special abilities that can activate if you decide not to attack with that particular creature adding a lot of strategy and possibilities to this game.<br/><br/>Once a player s life is reduced to zero he/she is out of the game.<br/><br/>"}, "143562": {"rpgartist": ["Eric Belisle", "Jared Blando", "Zoltan Boros", "Steve Ellis (I)", "Jason Engle", "Miles Johnston", "Michael Komarck", "Aaron Miller", "Adam Rex", "Chris Seaman", "Phill Simmer", "Franz Vohwinkel", "Tyler Walpole"], "statistics": [], "name": "Dungeon (Issue 214 - May 2013)", "rpgdesigner": ["Craig Campbell", "Michele Carter", "Jeremy Crawford", "Robert J.

After poker dice were introduced in the late 19th century it may have evolved from the similar game Mia to using five dice and poker hand combinations. It's usually played using poker dice, although normal dice can be used just as well. There's no real upper bound to the number of players except for practical considerations.<br/><br/>The first player to start a round rolls five dice in a cup, looks at them and names a scoring combination. These include five of a kind, four of a kind, full house, straight (&quot;big&quot; or &quot;small&quot;), three of a kind, two pairs, and one pair; aces beat kings and so on; if a combination doesn't include all five dice, then the best die among the remainder is also named (e.g. &quot;aces and tens, king high&quot;).<br/><br/>The next player in a clockwise direction, receiving the cup, must then decide whether she believes the claim. If not, she lifts the cup to expose the dice underneath. If she accepts the claim, she must then aim to produce a higher combination (or at least make the next player think she has); to this end she may redistribute the dice between the cup and the table and then reroll either the open or the hidden dice before making a new claim.<br/><br/>Once a claim is challenged, if it was a bluff the bluffer loses a life and the caller begins the next round. If the claim was true, the caller loses a life and the next player clockwise starts the next round. Typically players begin with three lives and are out of the game when they are all lost, although it's also possible to have just the one life (especially with lots of players).<br/><br/>There are of course different variant details, procedural conventions and betting systems. One variant might be to have five lives, stake two lives on a call, and allow players to &quot;fold&quot; and end a round at the cost of a single life. A simple betting method is that for each round they remain in the game a player must make a contribution to the pot; the last remaining player takes the pot.<br/><br/>"}, "143581": {"boardgamedesigner": ["Josh Laverty"], "poll": [], "name": "Privateer: The Kilrathi Menace", "playingtime": "35", "minplayers": "1", "boardgamemechanic": ["Action / Movement Programming", "Dice Rolling", "Modular Board", "Pick-up and Deliver", "Point to Point Movement", "Role Playing", "Simulation", "Trading"], "yearpublished": "2013", "usersrated": "3", "maxplayers": "4", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1682811_t.jpg", "average": "5.66667", "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["(Web published)"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1682811.jpg", "boardgameversion": ["First Edition"], "maxplaytime": "35", "boardgamecategory": ["Adventure", "Print & Play", "Science Fiction", "Space Exploration", "Video Game Theme"], "age": "14", "minplaytime": "35", "description": "A Fanmade boardgame, based on the Wing Commander video game from 1993, Privateer: The Kilrathi Menace is a player-driven adventure.<br/><br/>Key Features:<br/>-Challenging Solo and Multiplayer<br/>-Emphasis on Replayability<br/>-Dynamic Universe population<br/>-Dynamic Universe behaviour<br/>-Exploration and other variants<br/>-Multiple quadrants to play in<br/>-Meaningful advancement in multiple factions<br/><br/>Gameplay:<br/>Players travel from location to location, trading goods, taking on missions and catering to powerful factions.

As the German forces began the push the partisans were ready and awaiting for an ambush. The Partisans were not trained soldiers and the tactics of the partisans were simple and the challenges put on them by their leaders were less than would be expected from a military unit. Surprise and ambush were their best tactic. Their spot chosen lay on both sides of the Narotch stream. Having capturing a German field gun earlier and using their long hidden anti tank gun&mdash;a leftover from the retreating Russians in 1941&mdash;the ambush was prepared. Mines were placed, demolition charges were planted by explosive teams smuggled behind German lines and now the wait began. One Partisan survivor remembered: &ldquo;We would ambush the Germans on the Narotch stream bank. We knew the Germans planned to come to the aid of the guard from the other side of the stream. Our commander, Sagalchik, was also a guide, as he had lived in Miadel for many years and was familiar with the area. When we arrived everything was quiet. Suddenly shots were heard. We lay down and awaited the Germans. When we received the sign to attack we ran to the houses where the Germans and Lithuanian sharpshooters were. The battle lasted a few hours and the Germans dispersed.&rdquo; Within an hour the fight was over leaving the battlefield in partisans hands. The Germans suffered 40 dead and over 50 wounded. &ldquo;Lenz-Sud&rsquo; was off to a bloody start.<br/><br/>Here at CH we're into firsts. We like to delve into esoteric fronts and combatants.

Fond hopes were rudely shattered at 20:00 hours, as D Company moved into the ruins, supported by two troops of 7th RTR. The place was enemy held, opposition was heavy, and three of the Churchills were quickly knocked out. All through the long summer&rsquo;s evening, the battle raged to and fro over the ruins of the small town. Finally, the Cameronians and their supporting armour pulled back for the night, and shortly after so did the Germans.

As waves of Panzer Grenadiers broke against the Argylls&rsquo; position, B company PIATs drove off the accompanying tanks. By evening, the enemy had infiltrated the sunken road behind B Company, driving a wedge between it and the rest of the battalion. The position of B Company&rsquo;s forward 11 Platoon became difficult, as it was engaged front and rear. Difficult, but not impossible, so long as ammunition held out. Captain Mackenzie, 2 i/c B Company, was leading 11 Platoon. Earlier in the afternoon, he used the platoon PIAT to drive off three enemy tanks that were manoeuvring along the hedges north of the Bougy road. By evening, he and his Platoon had been given up for lost. But just before sunset, he led the fourteen survivors of 11 Platoon back into the Battalion perimeter. He had only withdrawn from the fight when his 2 inch mortar had taken a direct hit and the platoon had no rifle ammunition left. He brought out all but his most seriously wounded. Mackenzie&rsquo;s gallant stand won him a Military Cross.<br/><br/>Many years ago military historian par excellence Ian Daglish joined CH to launch the first in a string of historical modules created by onsite research. What followed was a successful career as a military history book author, penning titles including Operation Bluecoat and others for Pen &amp; Sword. Before his research went into books focused on the British experience during the Battle of Normandy, Ian's work was brought to the fore in the form of what became ATS's SCOTTISH CORRIDOR. This release has long been slated for new editions and the time is finally here, NOW, in the form of ORDERS FOR THE MAJOR and SHOUT FOR PIATS. Times have changed, art has changed, and we continue to strive to create the most eye-pleasing tactical-level game cartography and color counters to provide you with an interesting and evocative experience.

The Commisar pack features eight scenarios in which the Soviet player can have commissars (rule A25.22).<br/><br/>All eight scenarios in the Commissar Pack are predominantly  larger scenarios; the pack has four large scenarios (over 50 squads engaged), three medimum scenarios (over 25 squads engaged) and one small (less than 25 squads engaged). The scenarios have frequent use of fortifications, unique terrain and environmental conditions. The Pack has seven scenarios with fortifications, two night scenarios, two with extreme winter rules, one amphibious landing and all eight have water hexes (although two are ice rules). The scenarios are:<br/><br/>MM25 Futile Bravery. This scenario takes place during the battle for Smolensk in July 1941. It is a large scenario with the Soviets attacking and Germans defending in an urban environment. The Germans are defending a bridge (Russians win immediately when they control any location). The Russian start on both sides of the river and are reinforced by massive numbers (25 squads) of conscripts stiffined by NKVD troops and commissars. There are also two platoons of T-26 tanks. With these number the Russians can (and likely will) launch human wave attacks. One play test saw no less than six different HW attacks by the Russian player. The Germans defent with Good infantry well equiped with MGs and well led. They also get a radio and 105mm OBA. And a few mobile HTs one with an 81mm MTR. The Germans get a platoon of reinforcing tanks. There is a great deal of rubble in this scenario because of the scorch earth activity of the NKVD and more is in the making. The scenario uses Board 60, with its hills and city environment, Board 8 without the hills and most building are rubble and board 23 with the canal as a large railroad embankment. The Germans must used the mobility of the HTs to reinforce where the main attack falls and have the OBA spotter in the right place.<br/><br/>MM26 Gallant Mogilev. This also takes place in July 1941. It is a medium sized engagement between the attacking Germans and defending Russian. The Germans must break through the fortified Russian positions and capture a bridge. The Russians must defend tenaciously. It uses board 64 to represent the suburban outskirts of the city and board 65 with the river overlay. The Russians receive fortifications including fortified buildings, roadblocks, trenches, wire and mines. Plus two immoble tanks. The Germans get good troops, good leaders, an infantry gun and OBA.<br/><br/>MM27 Odessa Madness. This is a large scenario where the Germans must help the Romanians take a fortified villiage strongpoint. The Russians get strong forces with fortifications including pillboxes, fortified buildings, tunnels, trenches, wire, foxholes and mines. The Germans get assult engineers, sappers and OBA...along with Romanians. The battle takes mostly on board 12 with the gullies actually as AT ditches.<br/><br/>MM28 Sonderkommando Benesch. This small scenario has five Brandenburg squads trying to move past a pillbox and Rusiian defenders to exit. It uses board 7 and 40 to creat a constricted peninsula. Giving the Russians opportunity to make the Germans attack the pillbox.<br/><br/>MM29 Sorve Point. This medimum scenarios has the Germans making an attack against a fortified Russian psoitions. The battle is to capture the level two hill hexes of board 61 with limited mobility of using the seashore on one side using board 7 and marsh on the other. The Russians have fortifications of pillboxes, trenches, foxholes, wire and mines. They also have OBA. The Germans have good troops, MGs and leaders with OBA of their own.<br/><br/>MM30 Frozen Vzvad. This is the first night and extreme winter scenario, with 40 attacking Russian squads against 20 German in January 1942. The Germans receive pillboxes, fortified buildings, trenches, wire and mines. The Russsians receive Rocket OBA and the cover of night. The Russians are attacking to capture over 30 buildings on Boards 3, 8 and 7 between the two frozen rivers. The Germans defend the buildings and cannot let the Russians build up a fire base to blast them out.<br/><br/>MM31 Sevastopol by Sea. This night scenario has the Germans landing and taking the high ground against good Russian troops in June 1942. The scenario starts with the Germans almost across board 8 and landing. However they must get past the Russian sentries and capture the crest of the board 58 hill. The Russian have high morale naval infantry. The Germans have the cover of night in this medimum size scenario.<br/><br/>MM 32 Winter Forest. This scenario has extreme winter in December 1942 with the Germans attacking Partisans to capture the Partisan camp bunkers. The Partisans outnumber the Germans. However the ski equipped Germans can outrun the Partisans and attack from multiple directions in the forested boards of 34, 37 and 52. With the forests the Partisans start much of the fortification HIP and have wire to slow the Germans. The Germans get OBA and can use a barrage rule to box in the Partisans. A SSR give the Partisans Commissars for extra rally purposes. Just how useful it will with the Germans closing in form all sides remains to be seen.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": ["First edition", "First Edition"], "name": "ASL: March Madness 2013 Commissar Pack", "playingtime": "120", "boardgamemechanic": ["Dice Rolling", "Hex-and-Counter"], "average": "6.71429", "boardgameexpansion": [], "usersrated": "7", "boardgamefamily": ["Advanced Squad Leader"]}, "143687": {"poll": [], "name": "Step-Chess", "playingtime": "60", "minplayers": "2", "yearpublished": "0", "usersrated": "0", "maxplayers": "4", "boardgamefamily": ["Chess Games", "Three Dimensional Chess Variants"], "average": "0", "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["(Unknown)"], "boardgameversion": ["First edition"], "maxplaytime": "60", "boardgamecategory": ["Abstract Strategy"], "age": "10", "minplaytime": "60", "description": "A chess variant for up to 4 players using a 13x13 pyramidal board.

After a thousand years of war, Countermay is dying. Battles, curses, extraterrestrial parasites, demonic influence, and other hazards have ruined much of the planet. The food is running out, and the threat of starvation looms. The only way to save Countermay is to seize undisputed control. Until then, armies march, fed with the ever-dwindling food as they churn farmland into mud with their boots. Can you save Countermay from its invitable doom?<br/><br/>Romance of the Nine Empires is a fictitious interactive collectible card game (CCG) set in the fantasy world of Countermay. In the game, players assume command of one of nine vastly different warring factions &mdash; including steampunk aliens, a dark god-king's crusade of conversion, displaced WWII-era American GIs, and a risen empire of the undead &mdash; to expand, glorify, or defend their empires. Through its fictitious fifteen-year history, players have shaped the world of Countermay through their individual and collective achievements, and the results are reflected in the story and the current state of the empires. That concept was inspired by the Legend of the Burning Sands CCG, which in turn is based on the Legend of the Five Rings CCG: in those real-life games, tournament results affect the actual story in future expansions.<br/><br/>The plot of the 2013 movie The Gamers: Hands of Fate revolves around the fictitious game.  Within the movie itself, AEG was the publisher of the game, but as a result of Kickstarter funding for The Gamers: Hands of Fate, it decided to create a real-life version of R9E.  The real-life release is not a collectable game, but a boxed set with a set distribution of cards. This boxed set represents the fictitious 15th Anniversary World Championship Edition of Romance of the Nine Empires, and (to slip into the movie storyline for a second) it holds the decks used by the top-placing characters for each faction that made it to the quarterfinals at the 2012 World Championships at Gen Con Indy.<br/><br/>So there's 3 levels of reality at play here:<br/><br/><br/>     the CCG game called Romance of the Nine Empires, pictured in the movie The Gamers: Hands of Fate, which is played by the characters at Gen Con Indy 2012 and is 15 years old;<br/>     the fantasy world of Countermay, which is pictured in the CCG game and whose history is shaped by the players of the CCG game;<br/>     the real card game Romance of the Nine Empires, edited by AEG in 2013, which comes in a boxed set and is inspired by (and presented as) the fictitious CCG.<br/><br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": ["English first edition"], "name": "Romance of the Nine Empires", "playingtime": "45", "boardgamemechanic": ["Deck / Pool Building", "Hand Management"], "age": "12", "boardgameexpansion": ["155874"], "usersrated": "113", "average": "6.29389", "boardgamepodcastepisode": ["Carnagecast 54: Shuffle Up and Deal", "Episode 77 Origins preview, Buonocore drops by, and Xmen chat (spoilers)", "TGG Episode 53: Romance of the Nine Empires, Dawn of the Zeds 2nd Edition, Phantom Leader Deluxe, Phil Lawrence of the Long Beach Comic and Horror Con, and More!"]}, "143702": {"poll": [], "name": "AT-43 Unit Box: Assault Medusa", "playingtime": "60", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": ["Dice Rolling", "Player Elimination"], "yearpublished": "0", "boardgameexpansion": [], "usersrated": "3", "boardgamefamily": ["AT-43"], "maxplayers": "2", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1688812_t.jpg", "average": "7.66667", "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["Rackham"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1688812.jpg", "boardgameversion": ["Assault Medusa Unit Box"], "maxplaytime": "60", "boardgamecategory": ["Miniatures", "Science Fiction", "Wargame"], "age": "14", "minplaytime": "60", "description": "The assault medusas are autonomous combat systems based on a modified type 1 frame.

Home to Hughesville High, Hughesville is that town you see in most every 80s teen movie, especially those by John Hughes. It&rsquo;s a content little place during a content little time when Reagan was president, America was the most totally excellent nation that ever was, and all was good and right with the world, at least to the extent that anyone in America cared to pay attention. Greed was good, communism was bad, and music videos were starting to become &ldquo;a thing&rdquo; thanks to some no-name cable channel.<br/><br/>Hughesville High is a roleplaying game about high school kids in the 80s. High school kids with unusual powers and abilities, sure, but high school kids nonetheless. It&rsquo;s a lighthearted game intended to evoke the classic teen movies of the 80s, with the modern-day teen-monster shtick and other weirdness thrown into the mix for good measure. Unlike today&rsquo;s teen-monster genre, however, Hughes isn&rsquo;t supposed to be taken even slightly seriously. Hughesville High is much more Weird Science and much less Twilight.<br/><br/>The characters in Hughesville High are ordinary teens living through the strange days of the 1980s, trying their best to live normal lives while dealing with the abnormal situations that keep coming their way. They may be aliens, monsters, robots (yes, robots), or whatever else, but more than that, they&rsquo;re teenagers, looking to survive high school, score a date for the prom, and avoid doing anything that could end up on their Permanent Record.<br/><br/>Powered by the rules-light and narrative heavy TNT game engine, Hughesville High is a fast-playing almost no prep time game.  If you have an hour or two to play and nothing ready, if you want a break from dungeon crawling and running through shadows, if you just want to have some fun in a roleplaying game that doesn't involve killing your way across an entire continent, come try Hughesville High!<br/><br/>"}, "143737": {"poll": [], "name": "Game of Perga (aka Game of Perge)", "playingtime": "0", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": ["Grid Movement"], "yearpublished": "1000", "usersrated": "0", "maxplayers": "0", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1690165_t.jpg", "average": "0", "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["(Unknown)"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1690165.jpg", "boardgameversion": ["Game of Perga"], "maxplaytime": "0", "boardgamecategory": ["Dice"], "age": "0", "minplaytime": "0", "description": "A board game used in the ancient civilization of Lycia <br/>(today's Turkey) in Perga (Turkish name: Perge).<br/>No known game mechanic has survived to this day.

There, the mastermind of the team has a plan. He has built a dangerous device capable of entering the detective's mind. The team agrees that they will try to awake the detective from his Lethargos but they must first come to same state as the detective through the new device and there is a high possibility that they will die from the pressure their minds will suffer.<br/><br/>In Lethargos you lead the members of the team trying to find information and awake the detective. You enter to his dream asylum and there you have to face several Ghosts, trapped memories of the detective inside his own mind which try to kill you but occasionally to help you. The Ghosts which own several abilities, are managed by an extra player who takes the role of the detective. Your purpose here is to open the 6 of the 12 Asylum Tiles and then to find the real exit in order to escape. When the last tile is revealed, several walls and one real exit are placed around the tiles and you must find the real one. If one of the team reaches the real exit, then all the team escapes the dream world.<br/><br/>In each round the players follow some certain actions: Movement and Search. Each player can move 1 space inside an Asylum Tile and can search the different rooms on that tile by drawing cards. These cards give different abilities which allow to the players to reveal new Asylum Tiles and trap the Ghost. At the end of each player's turn the Detective-Player rolls a special 6-sided die and based on the result he can activate a Ghost and hit a player. The Detective-Player handles an Event Deck and activates such a card for each new revealed Asylum Tile and he also owns the Phobometer. The Phobometer includes several numbers and each time a Ghost hits a Player, the Phobometer is increased. If the Phobo token reaches the last number, then you lose the game. In this game all the players must work together in order to survive and escape the Detective's Dream World. Be prepared to face your worst living nightmare!<br/><br/>Fear is your only god!<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "3", "boardgameversion": ["English first edition"], "average": "1", "name": "The Amityville Project: Lethargos", "playingtime": "30", "boardgamemechanic": ["Action / Movement Programming", "Area Control / Area Influence", "Area Movement", "Co-operative Play", "Hand Management", "Modular Board", "Partnerships", "Variable Player Powers"], "age": "12", "boardgameexpansion": [], "usersrated": "1", "boardgamefamily": ["Admin: Unreleased Games", "Crowdfunding: Kickstarter"]}, "143741": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2909713.jpg", "boardgameimplementation": ["Bang!

Suddenly, a rain of arrows darken the sky: It's an Indian attack! Are you bold enough to keep up with the Indians? Do you have the courage to challenge your fate? Can you expose and defeat the ruthless gunmen around you?<br/><br/>BANG! The Dice Game keeps the core of the Bang! card game in place. At the start of the game, players each take a role card that secretly places them on a team: the Sheriff and deputies, outlaws, and renegades. The Sheriff and deputies need to kill the outlaws, the outlaws win by killing the Sheriff, and the renegades want to be the last players alive in the game.<br/><br/>Each player also receives a character card which grants him a special power in the game. The Sheriff reveals his role card and takes the first turn of the game. On a turn, a player can roll the five dice up to three times, using the results of the dice to shoot neighboring players, increase the range of his shots, heal his (or anyone else's) life points, or put him in range of the Indians, which are represented by nine tokens in the center of the table. Each time a player rolls an arrow, he takes one of these tokens; when the final token is taken, each player loses one life point for each token he holds, then the tokens are returned to the center of the table.<br/><br/>If a player collects a trio of Gatling symbols on the dice, he fires one shot at everyone else and rids himself of Indian tokens. Who'll get his shot off first?

A knight&rsquo;s honor can be tarnished. Any man can harbor secret ambitions, even a member of the Kingsguard. The seven Sworn Brothers of the Kingsguard wear white armor and take vows to serve the crown, and only the crown. However, each Sworn Brother is a man at his core, and susceptible to the temptations and ambitions and doubts that plague all men. Each has his secrets, and the sixty new cards (three copies each of twenty different cards) in The Kingsguard lend shape to their ambitions, their deceptions, and their deadly talents.<br/><br/>Like each of the Chapter Packs in the Kingsroad cycle, The Kingsguard returns players to a Westeros changed by the War of Five Kings, countless treacheries, and new alliances. The balance of power between the game&rsquo;s six Houses has changed, as have the faces of those Houses. As part of this return to Westeros, each Chapter Pack in the Kingsroad cycle explores one or more of the game&rsquo;s existing themes or mechanics, adding new depth of strategies and deck-building options while remaining light on new rules.<br/><br/>Accordingly, as it explores the secret ambitions of the seven active Kingsguard, The Kingsguard adds new depth to the game&rsquo;s Shadows mechanic, featuring not only Shadows-crested versions of the Knights of the Kingsguard, but of other characters and locations, as well.

Although there are plenty of sci-fi wargames, PMC 2640 has many interesting features which make it unique and very enjoyable.<br/><br/>PMC 2640 is designed as a &lsquo;true company scale&rsquo; wargame, which means that it runs smoothly both with a few as well as a few dozen units on the battlefield. This was achieved by eliminating sophisticated, but unnecessary special rules, and limiting the number of counters to morale markers only, represented by D6 dice. The ruleset itself is compact and elegant, written in simple, &ldquo;international&rdquo; English, leaving no place for vagueness and multiple interpretations. On the other hand, PMC 2640 offers countless possibilities, as the rulebook contains a few dozen of unit entries, six scenarios and seven terrain generators, all of which ensure that no two games will look the same. The classic alternate activation (with small balancing modifications) makes the game fast and addictive.<br/><br/>The unit/team is the basic element of the game and all parameters are given for the whole team, with the number of soldiers modifying just a few parameters (Firepower, Assault and Morale, to be precise). We do not worry about equipment of individual soldiers. Rifle team is a rifle team, whether they use assault rifles, lasers, neutron blasters or any other similar weapon. There are only two requirements: they units have to be Recognizable and Cool-Looking! This allows you to prepare and field the coolest teams you can, with sarges, medics, war correspondents or whoever else you wish, as long as there is no doubt what unit the miniatures represent.<br/><br/>PMC 2640 does not feature a typical point value system. Instead, all units are grouped into Tiers which correspond to their level of training, experience and equipment. What is more, the battles have their own Battle Tiers, which specify the sum of all Unit Tiers and limit the number of units of specific Tiers. Low Tier battles are clashes of unreliable greenhorns, while high Tier battles feature lots of specialised, deadly troops.<br/><br/>Another feature of PMC 2640 is morale system. Morale is not a 0-1 value (didn&rsquo;t pass &ndash; passed) like in the most games, but instead troops under fire get suppression points. When the number of these points becomes high enough, the unit gets suppressed and later broken. To make things more interesting, every lost soldier means a reduction of the Morale parameter, so like in real life, the units with half of the soldiers down usually have little combat value. But even troops which haven&rsquo;t suffered any losses can sometimes be forced to retreat &ndash; though killing a few enemies always helps!<br/><br/>PMC 2640 focuses on tactics and proper use of even the slightest advantages the commanders have at their disposal. Terrain pieces are not just decorative dioramas, but play a very important role. They may hide your troops from enemy line of sight, provide them with a defence bonus and/or boost their firepower &ndash; definitely something to take into account. Additionally, some of the terrain pieces can be demolished, and buildings or barricades may become deadly traps!<br/><br/>One the most interesting component of PMC 2640 is its campaign system, which resembles those featured in skirmish games. Instead of a chain of several scenarios, the players develop their PMCs by playing standard battles. The commanders gain funds to recruit new troops and develop their companies, while the units get experience, upgrades and trauma, all of which affect their performance in later games.<br/><br/>And if you want to try something different than typical competitive battles, PMC 2640 allows for solitaire and cooperative games! These are described in a separate chapter with additional rules, six dedicated scenarios and new special units (insurgents and space bugs). Solitaire/cooperative games might not be perfectly balanced (which is probably impossible), but are intended to be as cool and fun as possible. Whether you wish to crush a rebellion of disappointed miners or evacuate civilians attacked by oversized bugs, you will find these games challenging and unusual compared standard battles.<br/><br/>The PMC 2640 rulebook is the first product of Assault Publishing to include an original background story. It contains a brief history of the future from 22nd to 27th century, a description of the rise and fall of the corporations, the genesis of PMCs, and many other events which allow you to get immersed in the world of the year 2640.<br/><br/>PMC 2640 is designed for scales between 15mm an 28mm, with 15mm as the default one. However, there is a possibility of using smaller scales (like 6mm, 10mm) using minor modifications included at the end of the book.<br/><br/>"}, "143762": {"rpgartist": ["Dimitri Bielak", "James D.

The game components consist of tiny wooden (cherry-wood stain) blocks with embossed gold foil lettering, which fit perfectly in a maroon, plastic case that is the depth of only one block and opens so that only one face of each of the blocks can be seen at a time. There are 42 blocks in the set; each block has five letters on each block face with the sixth side blank.  (According to the description on the instructions, the distributions of letters are proportional based on common usage.) The object of the game is to arrange the blocks within the case to spell interlocking words (horizontally and vertically). The perfect game would show 13 words (seven words across, six words down) without using blanks. The number of blanks that are showing when the player is finished determines the score; each blank is worth one point.   Players attempt to score the lowest number possible.<br/><br/>There are two different sets of rules; one set is on a small slip of paper that can be removed from the case, while the other set of rules is glued to the inside, top lid.  Each set of rules has a different method of scoring, and a different set of game parameters, including different allowable word types and different descriptions of how the game is to be scored.    In one version, no prefixes, suffixes, or abbreviations can be used.<br/><br/>Though this is similar to a solvable word puzzle, the distribution of letters (and specifically the rules included with the game) suggests that there are multiple ways to get a perfect score and, therefore, multiple ways to win.<br/><br/>"}, "143780": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1255696.jpg", "boardgameimplementation": ["Cat & Chocolate"], "poll": [], "boardgamedesigner": ["Ryo Kawakami"], "statistics": [], "yearpublished": "2012", "maxplayers": "6", "boardgameartist": ["St\u00e9phane Gantiez", "Ian Parovel"], "boardgamepublisher": ["Moonster Games"], "maxplaytime": "20", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1255696_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "20", "boardgamecategory": ["Card Game", "Horror", "Party Game", "Zombies"], "description": "A group of students from the University of Texas has decided to go for a field trip to an abandoned military base, lost in the middle of the desert, but once they arrive, nothing happens as expected.

There are a lot of strange creatures from fantasy novels and movies, from ancient mythology, and, as time went on, from the twisted minds of game designers and even GMs, for that matter. Anyone today who tried to go about creating an extensive bestiary of all the different cool and interesting fantasy monsters could fill three or four volumes with three hundred monsters each, and still have a long way left to go, with fans crying out for various &ldquo;forgotten&rdquo; monsters to get some attention. That kind of breadth doesn&rsquo;t leave a whole lot of room for depth, and that&rsquo;s where Exotic Encounters comes in.<br/><br/>There are all kinds of reasons why you might not want to use a monster stat-block straight from the core rules. For one thing, if your players have a habit of browsing through such books, or are long-time veterans who know the basic ins and outs of most fantasy staples, you may need an unusual stat-block just to throw them a curve ball and teach them that they can&rsquo;t count on their out of character knowledge to take all the mystery out of the game. Alternatively, many GMs can recall a time when they wanted to make use of a certain monster in their game, only to find that it was a few CRs too high or low for what they had in mind.<br/><br/>Exotic Encounters takes a single, iconic monster, and creates three new variants on that theme. These variants aren&rsquo;t simple tweaks, and are more than simply advancing or removing Hit Dice, though that occurs as well. Each of these three variations on the monster&rsquo;s theme has a specific, flavorful goal in mind, and a role to play, and their statistics entries are gently massaged in order to make them fit those roles. Further, each of these variants comes with brand new specially-crafted special abilities, which are unique to Exotic Encounters and not found anywhere else.<br/><br/>This particular installment of Exotic Encounters focuses on medusas. One of the most iconic creatures of greek mythology, there have been many interpretations of the medusa throughout the years, from cthonian monstrosity to beautiful (and wronged) damsel. The first new medusa in this book, the vampiric medusa (CR 5), turns her enemies to stone figuratively, rather than literally, by filling their hearts with despair, and drains blood through her bites, though she is not a true vampire. The strange headsman's medusa (CR 5), inspired in part by the famous beheading by Perseus, is a medusa head that can act on its own, forming a nasty surprise for a party that thinks it's defeated its petrifying foe. Finally, the snake queen medusa (CR 11) is a bigger and meaner medusa with a heavier serpent influence, and whose blood, if spilled, transforms into a swarm of deadly snakes.<br/><br/>"}, "143830": {"boardgamedesigner": ["Eli Verdin"], "average": "0", "poll": [], "name": "RoShamBo Rush", "playingtime": "40", "minplayers": "3", "boardgamemechanic": ["Hand Management", "Rock-Paper-Scissors", "Roll / Spin and Move"], "yearpublished": "2013", "usersrated": "0", "maxplayers": "6", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1694628_t.jpg", "boardgameartist": ["Eli Verdin"], "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["Spaceman Games LLC"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1694628.jpg", "boardgameversion": ["First Edition"], "maxplaytime": "40", "boardgamecategory": ["Party Game", "Racing"], "age": "8", "minplaytime": "40", "description": "RoShamBo Rush is a competitive racing game.

If you have people reading skills, they do come in handy.<br/><br/>The game features racers (pawns) that stand over 2&quot; tall. The racers are adorned with helmets and body armor when a player lands on a &quot;Armor Up&quot; space. Armor serves as insurance for losing a battle and keeps that racer from taking hit points in exchange for a piece of armor.<br/><br/>Though linear like a race course, you have decisions to make on your turn. Who will you battle? When is the best time to play your Twist Cards? Nobody coasts to an easy victory here. Only the scrappiest competitors will earn a place on the winners podium which only has limited space reserved for the top three racers.<br/><br/>"}, "143831": {"boardgamedesigner": ["Jacquelin Kirton"], "poll": [], "boardgamehonor": ["2013 NGZA Awards Nominee"], "name": "Sock & Toss", "playingtime": "20", "minplayers": "2", "yearpublished": "2012", "usersrated": "2", "maxplayers": "6", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1690166_t.jpg", "average": "2.5", "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["Q & A Games"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1690166.jpg", "boardgameversion": ["First Edition"], "maxplaytime": "20", "boardgamecategory": ["Action / Dexterity", "Children's Game", "Party Game"], "age": "6", "minplaytime": "20", "description": "From the website:<br/><br/>Sock&amp;Toss is a great game to be played by friends and families alike.<br/>The main aim is to outwit your opponents and to create your own bean bag (hacky sack) before everyone else.<br/>The way you play is by flipping the correct disc at the appropriate time.

All the corner squares of the board are red.  The game&rsquo;s pieces consist of 20 red and 20 black checkers, each with a pawn on one side, a crown on the other.  The game is played on the black squares of the board, with players&rsquo; pieces beginning on the black squares of the three closest rows.  Players may begin with any combination or formation of pawns and crowns, so long as they are identical to each other, though the instructions do provide three recommended ways to start: three rows of pawns, or one row of crowns and two of pawns, or two rows crowns and one of pawns.  Black moves first.<br/><br/>With the exception of the cross in the middle of the board, player movement is the same as an ordinary game of Checkers.  Pawns may move forward (left or right) one square only unless jumping and capturing an opponent&rsquo;s piece, when they may jump however many times there are openings.  Crowns may move and jump forward and backward.  Captured pieces are removed from the board.  Crowning of pawns takes place upon reaching the opponent&rsquo;s home row, or after moving over any four squares in the Trojan&rsquo;s Cross.<br/><br/>The game&rsquo;s instructions feature a number of diagrams describing what movements a pawn may make within the cross, how it may exit, what conditions it must meet to be crowned, how the opponent must be notified, and how the opponent may interrupt.  The game is won by capturing all of an opponent&rsquo;s pieces, or by blocking all of an opponent&rsquo;s pieces from moving, or by making seven uninterrupted moves within the cross.

As a first step to his plan, he hid the five hourglasses of time in the five dimensions of his fortress. This meant that, until they were recovered, time outside the castle would slow down, and eventually stop. Denzil was slightly peeved, and searched high and low for a being so brave, so bold, so cunning, so clever, so courageous, so unselfish, so stupid that he would undertake this suicidal mission. You, SPRAT (short for a Small Partially Robotic Alien Time-traveller), were lucky enough to be chosen from thousands of similar brave, brainless beings to recover the five hourglasses: if you succeed, you will be heavily rewarded, if you fail, everybody will be ever so slightly annoyed.<br/><br/>User Summary:<br/><br/>In Richochet, you control a spherical, red creature wearing sunglasses called SPRAT. SPRAT can roll left and right, can climb or descend ladders (it is not made exactly clear how he does this without arms) and can jump. If the jump key is held down, SPRAT squishes himself down and the resultant jump is then higher.<br/><br/>Creatures inhabiting the five levels drain SPRAT's energy and when it is all lost, he loses one of his three lives. Some enemies can also kill SPRAT with a single touch.<br/><br/>Objects are scattered around the levels. Food replenishes SPRAT's energy bar, keys open doors (a single key can open multiple doors), and other special items remove particular obstacles. SPRAT can hold two items at any one time.<br/><br/>The object of each level is to find the hourglass, then reaching the teleporter to transport to the next level.<br/><br/>Credits:<br/><br/>Game Authors: N.

What it evolved into is a fantastic party game in which players get to know each other and engage in hilarious challenges.<br/><br/>The game consists of a deck of 100 cards. Each player starts with a hand of seven cards and is attempting to empty his hand to win. Next to the main deck, three cards are turned face up, each with a different rule. Each turn you play a card on one of these piles from your hand, changing the current rules in play. If you break a rule at any time, you draw a card. Sounds simple enough, but it gets better. The basic rules tell you which color cards you can play or what suit they need to be, but other cards may restrict what you can do physically, such as making you keep one hand on the table or making you talk like a pirate.<br/><br/>The other notable mechanism in the game includes personal trivia, duels, and mini events called &quot;switch-a-roos&quot;.

(Thus, each player is always dealt 10 cards.) In addition to the deck, you play with five number-designation cards (numbered 1-5), five color-designation cards that match the card colors, and a player aide board.<br/><br/>Game play follows the pattern of traditional trick-taking games. The lead player for a trick plays one card, and the other players must follow suit if possible, while throwing any other card if they can't. The highest card of the color led wins the trick, unless one or more trump cards were played, in which case the highest trump card wins the trick &mdash; but at the start of the round, trump is undetermined! To back up a step, at the start of the round, the first player reveals the top number-designation card; the numeral on that card helps determine trump as well as which cards earn or cost players points. If the number-designation card shows &quot;7&quot;, for example, then the color of the first 7 played determines the trump color for the round; use a color-designation card to mark the trump color on the player aide. What's more:<br/><br/><br/>    The second 7 determines which color is worth positive points; each card of this color is worth 1 point at the round's end.<br/>    The third 7 determines which the &quot;ebbes&quot; color &mdash; &quot;ebbes&quot; meaning &quot;something&quot; in Palatine; at round's end, the player(s) who don't have the most or fewest cards of this color each earn 3 points.<br/>    The fourth 7 determines which color is worth negative points; each card of this color is worth -1 point at the round's end.<br/><br/><br/>After four colors have been determined, the fifth color is automatically the &quot;nix&quot; color. Whoever has the most of these cards chooses the start player for the next round - after cards have been dealt for that round. At the start of the new round, reveal a new number-designation card. After all of the number-designation cards have been played &mdash; that is, after the fifth round &mdash; the game ends and the player with the most points wins.<br/><br/>Two variants are included with ebbes. The first variant extends the game (and probably lengthens the &quot;determining&quot; time) by adding more cards to the deck. In the second variant, players take turns placing a color-designation card on the number-designation card of their choice, and those five particular cards determine the colors for trump, positive points, etc. as each of them is played. The game's website gives rules for a third variant in which each player discards one card at the start of the round, and the player in last place gets to look at these cards; whoever takes the final trick takes these cards prior to scoring.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "3", "boardgameversion": ["English/German first edition"], "name": "ebbes", "playingtime": "45", "boardgamemechanic": ["Trick-taking"], "age": "10", "usersrated": "232", "boardgamesubdomain": ["Abstract Games"], "average": "6.80797", "boardgamepodcastepisode": ["Garrett's Games 401 - ebbes and Sail to India, plus Comments"]}, "143883": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1690147.png", "boardgameimplementation": ["Demonic Toys vs. Blood Dolls Game:  Battle of the Tiny Terrors", "Godzilla Rampage: Invasion of Gamera Supplement", "Godzilla Rampage"], "poll": [], "boardgamedesigner": ["Elliott Monroe"], "statistics": [], "boardgamecompilation": ["USMK (Ultimate Street-Fight Mortality Kombat)"], "yearpublished": "2013", "maxplayers": "4", "boardgameartist": ["(Uncredited)"], "boardgamepublisher": ["Warrior Games"], "maxplaytime": "15", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1690147_t.png", "minplaytime": "15", "boardgamecategory": ["Fighting", "Movies / TV / Radio theme"], "description": "Ever wanted to see your favorite Warriors battle each other?
