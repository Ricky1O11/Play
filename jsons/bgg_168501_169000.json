There are evil outsiders that seem to mortals no more than twisted and strange animalistic beasts, like the stilt-legged achaierai, though their flightless ferocity belies their cruel cleverness.

These universes follow vastly different laws of physics and are prone to annihilating each other if they should ever touch. Though these events do happen, they are quite rare thanks to a weightless and almost completely elastic extrauniversal fluid known as the ether.<br/><br/>There are some puny and insignificant organic creatures who find themselves attuned to this background noise of the multiverse, this infinite source of energy that surrounds them and suffuses the void beyond the edge of everything. Finding they have the ability to communicate with the extrauniversal fluid and to draw from its raw, shapeless energy to do as they will, these ethermancers tend to fall into two camps. Some believe that the universe chose them to carry its greatest gift and use it to protect this tiny speck of creation. Others feel it is a perfect excuse to lord it over everyone. Given humanoid nature, the latter tends to be far more common.<br/><br/>Ultimate Ethermagic takes equal parts Douglas Adams and H. P. Lovecraft to produce an &ldquo;all day long&rdquo; system of magic with a cosmic flavor. Spiritual successors to the warlock base class of the 3.5 days, the ethermagus, ethermancer, and etherslinger base classes seek to have improved playability by offering the ability to mix and match spell effects to make custom evocations on the fly. Whereas the warlock simply blasted, the ethermagician can ask, &ldquo;How hard?&rdquo;, and can even choose to be an interesting hybrid class rather than a pure-blooded caster.<br/><br/>Thanks to the advent of a rapidly-regenerating spell point pool, players must choose whether or not to spend more than they will regenerate next turn. Incredibly potent effects are indeed possible, but firing them off without a care in the world will reduce the player to single-target ranged touch attacks in a hurry!<br/><br/>Product Features:<br/><br/>    Three base classes, the full-caster ethermancer, the melee ethermagus, and the cosmic firearms etherslinger<br/>    Eight archetypes, three of which, the healing etherfuser, the insane mad evangelist, and the stealthy void stalker, are complex enough to be new classes in their own right!<br/>    Favored Class options for all common races, as well as most featured races<br/>    Innovative spell point system allows for a spellcaster balanced like a martial class with the ability to &ldquo;burst&rdquo; like a classic spellcaster<br/>    Rules for detecting ethermagic, countering ethermagic, and qualifying for classic arcane spellcaster prestige classes as an ethermancer<br/>    225+ spells, or &ldquo;manifestations&rdquo;, in six schools, or &ldquo;etherhearts&rdquo; spanning a 45-page spellbook<br/>        lesser blast &ndash; low cost, moderate damage evocation<br/>        greater blast &ndash; high cost, high damage evocation<br/>        alteration &ndash; defensive spells for self only<br/>        bestow &ndash; defensive and offensive spells for anyone but the caster<br/>        genesis &ndash; permanent creation of objects from pure energy<br/>        voidmeld - on-the-fly weapon enhancement<br/>    <br/>    Greater manifestations system allows an ethermagician to retard lateral growth in exchange for massive once-per-day effects, including one spell so modular that it takes up three full pages all on its own (and is supported by 3 of the book's 39 feats)!<br/>    39 feats<br/>    Complete nested bookmarking, including all sidebars and tables<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>"}, "168519": {"rpgdesigner": ["Scott Corum", "Victor Gipson"], "rpg": ["Hot Chicks"], "statistics": [], "name": "Disciples of the Blade", "rpgartist": ["Scott Corum", "Victor Gipson"], "rpgproducer": ["Scott Corum"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2291488.jpg", "usersrated": "0", "rpgitemversion": ["PDF version"], "average": "0", "rpggenre": ["Adult / Mature", "Fantasy (Modern Urban Fantasy)", "Martial Arts", "Modern (Near Future)", "Science Fiction"], "rpgpublisher": ["Dakkar Unlimited"], "rpgcategory": ["Sourcebook (rules/options to enhance play)"], "poll": [], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2291488_t.jpg", "description": "From publisher blurb:<br/><br/>A Degree in Holy War<br/><br/>In many places on the Earth of 2018, it can be unhealthy to be a vigilante.

It was released on November 4, 2014 for Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 3, PlayStation 4, Xbox 360, and Xbox One. The game is the first main entry in the Call of Duty series since 2013's Call of Duty: Ghosts.<br/><br/>The single-player story follows Jack Mitchell, a private in the United States Marine Corps. Development began in 2011, soon after the release of Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3. Sledgehammer engaged veteran actors, such as Troy Baker and Kevin Spacey, to perform in the game's lead roles.<br/><br/>Gameplay<br/><br/>Advanced Warfare, like the other Call of Duty titles, is presented in a first-person shooter perspective. However, the game features several changes; unlike other installments, Advanced Warfare does not use a traditional heads-up display; instead, all information is relayed to the player via holographic projections from the weapon equipped. The general gun-play remains unchanged, apart from new mechanics; for example, certain guns will be able to recharge slowly. The player can also switch between different types of grenades. The game will also be the first in the Call of Duty series that will allow the player to choose differing types of conventional weaponry; for example, the game will feature regular conventional firearms, but the player can also choose to use Laser or Energy directed weaponry, both of which have differing attributes.<br/><br/>Plot<br/><br/>In 2054, Private Jack Mitchell (Troy Baker) of the United States Marine Corps participates in a battle against North Koreans in Seoul, along with his squadmates Private Will Irons (Paul Telfer) and Sergeant Cormack (Russell Richardson). In the midst of the battle, Will is killed in action, while Mitchell's left arm is severed from his shoulder, forcing him to be discharged from military service. After attending a funeral service for Will, Mitchell is offered to join the Atlas Corporation, the world's most powerful private military contractor, by CEO Jonathan Irons (Kevin Spacey), Will's father. As a reward, Mitchell is given an advanced prosthetic arm to replace his lost one.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, a terrorist group calling itself the KVA, led by a technophobic man called Joseph &quot;Hades&quot; Chkheidze (Sharif Ibrahim), begins staging numerous terrorist attacks, with the world turning to Atlas to stop them. Mitchell, along with his teammates Gideon (Gideon Emery), Joker (Jeremy Kent Jackson), and other Atlas soldiers rescue the Nigerian prime minister and later capture a KVA technologist in Lagos, Nigeria during a technology summit. However, by 2055, the KVA's attacks soon become more sophisticated, and Mitchell and his team fail to prevent the KVA from forcing a nuclear reactor meltdown on Bainbridge Island, Washington. The KVA launch similar attacks against nuclear power plants worldwide, irradiating numerous cities, killing thousands of people, and putting national governments and militaries in turmoil. Atlas emerges as the dominant military force in the world, aiding civilians affected by the attacks, and holding back the KVA's rampage.<br/><br/>Four years later in 2059, Mitchell and Gideon search an abandoned downtown Detroit, Michigan to find Dr. Pierre Danois (Erik Passoja), the KVA's second-in-command. After having the doctor interrogated by Ilona (Angela Gots), an ex-Spetsnaz Atlas operative, they are able to track Hades down to Santorini in Greece where KVA leaders are having a conference. Mitchell corners Hades and mortally wounds him. Before succumbing to his death, Hades utters &quot;Irons knew,&quot; giving Mitchell a data chip with his last breath.<br/><br/>Ilona analyzes the data chip, only to find out that the technologist they captured in Nigeria was killed by Irons after the latter learned of the KVA global attack, proving that he deliberately allowed the attacks to occur to improve Atlas' reputation. Irons attempts to have Mitchell and Ilona arrested, but they escape Atlas' headquarters in the rebuilt Baghdad (called New Baghdad), guided by a mysterious soldier, while Gideon stays by Irons' side for further investigation. The mysterious soldier reveals himself to be Mitchell's old commanding officer, Cormack, who is now a member of the Sentinel Task Force, an international effort initially created to investigate the KVA power plant attacks, but now repurposed to to prevent Atlas' rise to power.<br/><br/>In 2060, Mitchell, now a Sentinel, joins Cormack, Ilona, and Knox (Khary Payton) as they infiltrate Irons' private residence in Bangkok. The team discovers that Dr. Danois (now having changed his alias to Bellamy) is now collaborating with Irons on &quot;Manticore&quot;, a bio-weapon. They set up a tracker on a plane carrying the bio-weapon bound for Argentina. Sentinel later intercepts the plane, which crashes in Antarctica. Gideon appears and helps the Sentinels defeat the Atlas soldiers after discovering Irons' intentions for the bio-weapon. The team successfully retrieves the WMD, and they are able to take one sample of it. After analyzing the sample, they discover that Manticore is a weapon designed to attack the DNA of specific individuals, meaning Irons can use the weapon without risking harm to his own troops. The Sentinels, now joined by Gideon, infiltrate and destroy an Atlas bio-weapons laboratory in Bulgaria, eliminating much of the Manticore samples.<br/><br/>With his plot revealed, Irons releases his ultimatum to remove all politicians, whom he thinks are the problem of the world, at the United Nations General Assembly and declares war on the world. The Sentinels discover that Irons is planning a preemptive strike on the United States and try to stop an Atlas attack on the country in San Francisco, California. Atlas destroys the Golden Gate Bridge, trapping the U.S. 3rd fleet in the Bay Area, and attempt to destroy the fleet in a single strike. The Sentinels use a railgun aboard an aircraft carrier to destroy the Atlas ships attacking them. With the ultimatum and the attack on U.S. soil, the United States, along with the rest of the world, declares war against Atlas and Irons retreats to his headquarters in New Baghdad.<br/><br/>Seven months later, the Sentinels and the United States Army attack New Baghdad to stop Irons and bring him to justice. However, Atlas releases Manticore, killing Knox and most of the attacking troops. Mitchell, Ilona, and Gideon, whose DNA are recognized by Manticore as they are former Atlas soldiers, are spared, as well as Cormack who was outside the blast radius. The four are brought to an Atlas prison camp, which also runs Manticore experiments on its inmates. The Sentinels escape but Cormack succumbs to a fatal wound caused by Irons, while Mitchell's prosthetic arm is severely damaged. As they escape the facility, they discover that Irons already has enough Manticore to attack every military base in the world, and will be launching an ICBM loaded with the bio-weapon shortly.<br/><br/>Mitchell and Gideon launch a lone assault on the Atlas HQ while using heavily armored battlesuits (ASTs), and are successful in destroying the bio-weapon ICBM. They find Irons as the other Sentinels prepare to bombard the building. Irons disables their exoskeletons, forcing Mitchell to release the exoskeleton to chase Irons. Mitchell tackles Irons off the building, but he hangs on to Mitchell's prosthetic arm. Mitchell severs his prosthetic, sending Irons falling to his death. As Gideon arrives to carry him out of the building, Mitchell notes that Irons' death was only the beginning, and the war against Atlas is far from over.<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;Call of Duty: Advanced Warfare&quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "168546": {"poll": [], "name": "Interstellar Marines", "videogamemode": ["Cooperative", "Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["Windows Downloadable edition"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3116997.jpg", "videogametheme": ["Science Fiction", "Space"], "videogamegenre": ["Shooter"], "videogamedeveloper": ["Zero Point Software"], "videogamefranchise": ["(Unreleased Games - Available)"], "videogameplatform": ["Windows"], "usersrated": "0", "average": "0", "statistics": [], "videogamepublisher": ["Zero Point Software"], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3116997_t.jpg", "description": "<br/><br/><br/>    <br/>        <br/>UNRELEASED GAME &ndash; AVAILABLE<br/><br/>    <br/>    <br/>        <br/>This game is still either in Early-Alpha or Beta (or any status in between) but IS already available for sale / early access, so CAN BE PLAYED.<br/><br/>    <br/><br/><br/>Interstellar Marines resurrects the old school tactical FPS, offering a unique blend of co-op, role-playing and nonlinear gameplay.

My intention here was to make a more consistent game, regarding to the formulation of its rules. I wanted the game to have two basic, simple rules. I was concerned about keeping the concept of simultaneity of actions at all times. Some features of GO, such as &quot;once a piece is placed, it can not move,&quot; are not really consistent at all times in the unfolding of the game, regarding the concept with which they were raised. I tried to get rid of all philosophical inconsistency at the time of defining the rules of this game.<br/><br/>Equipment<br/><br/>Pieces<br/>The pieces are circular. These pieces are characterized in that each has a range (a circular area whose diameter is three times the diameter of the piece). Each piece has one side painted white and the other black (like in Othello), and each player may chose one side (color) to play (then, the color of a piece is defined only when that piece is placed on the board, and keeps that color has long has its still on the board). Both sides have in the center a gray circle (its just decorative), whose diameter is equal to a quarter of the pieces' diameter. <br/>To tell if a piece is within the range of another, just take a piece and place it over the two pieces. If the piece used to measure is supported by the two pieces, one can ensure that a piece is within the range of the other (and vice versa).<br/>A total of 152 pieces are needed.<br/><br/>Board<br/>The board has two concentric squares: the peripheral (whose side is equal to 19x the diameter of the pieces) and the central (whose side is equal to 17x the diameter of the pieces). The peripheral defines the playing area, and acts has a neutral piece (&quot;gray piece&quot;). In this sense, the central delimits its range.<br/><br/>Rules<br/><br/>    At the start of the game the board is empty. Black plays first. Then both players play alternately. In his turn, a player can do one or two &quot;relocation&quot; moves. If he cant, the game ends, and that player loses.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Notes about the terms used:<br/>&quot;Belt&quot;: a group of pieces conforms a &quot;belt&quot; if every piece of the group is within the range of at least two of the other pieces of the group.<br/>&quot;Conditioned&quot;: a piece is not &quot;conditioned&quot; to a player when it is over the board, with his color facing the board, and since the group of pieces that are within its range (regardless of color) do not conform a belt. <br/>&quot;Relocate&quot;: a player makes a &quot;relocation&quot; move when he takes a &quot;conditioned&quot; piece from the board or from the outside of the board, and then places it on an empty place over the board or at the outside of the board.<br/><br/>"}, "168548": {"poll": [], "name": "2K Power Pack Collection", "videogamemode": ["Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["North American PlayStation 3 edition"], "average": "0", "videogametheme": ["Crime", "Horror", "Occult", "Science Fiction"], "usersrated": "0", "videogamedeveloper": ["2K Games, Inc."], "videogamegenre": ["Action Adventure", "Sandbox", "Shooter"], "videogameplatform": ["PlayStation 3"], "statistics": [], "videogamepublisher": ["2K Games, Inc."], "videogamecompilation": ["BioShock 2", "The Darkness II", "Mafia II"], "description": "User Summary<br/><br/>The 2K Power Pack Collection contains BioShock 2, Mafia II, and The Darkness II.<br/><br/>"}, "168549": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2294909.jpg", "poll": [], "boardgamedesigner": ["Y.

In the end only the fastest racer will be victorious!<br/><br/>Dragon Racer is a fast-paced card drafting strategy game that combines card drafting and set collection. Compete for cards to fire up your team of dragons and advance along the racetrack. After seven turns, the player who has gone the farthest wins! You can combine two copies of Dragon Racer to play with up to eight players.<br/><br/>In more detail, each player gets three random level 1 dragon cards and places them face up next to their character to create their racing team. Shuffle the other level 1 and level 2 dragons to create the starting dragon deck. Remove one random upper track tile and one random lower track tile, then place the six remaining upper/lower track tiles colored-side down between the corner tiles.<br/><br/>On each turn, reveal the next face-down racetrack tile and add its associated dragons to the dragon deck. Assign trophy cards to players according to their position in the race. (Skip this step on the first turn.) Deal each player a number of dragon cards (two + the turn number) from the dragon deck. Players simultaneously draft these cards face down until all cards are taken.<br/><br/>One at a time, in reverse trophy order (i.e. last place goes first), players take turns racing. During this phase you reveal all of the cards you drafted, then use them to fire up dragons on your racing team or to attack other players. At the end of the phase you may swap one of the dragon cards you collected with a dragon on your racing team. Finally, the players with the most dragons from each racetrack type are awarded an extra boost, moving them even further along the racetrack.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": ["English edition", "Polish edition", "Print & Play First Edition"], "age": "13", "name": "Dragon Racer", "playingtime": "120", "boardgamemechanic": ["Card Drafting", "Modular Board", "Press Your Luck", "Set Collection", "Take That", "Variable Player Powers"], "average": "6.86932", "usersrated": "132", "boardgamefamily": ["Animals: Dragons", "Crowdfunding: Kickstarter"]}, "168583": {"rpgdesigner": ["Anne Brown", "James M.

This must have been what your sensors picked up when you were nearing your own orbit.

The coexistence may be symbiotic, where one creature lives on (or in) the other, like human gut flora; or it may be less intimate, like bees simultaneously feeding from flowers and pollinating them. In some cases, one species domesticates the other, like humans and dogs (or vice versa), while others just adapt their behavior to one another, like some large mammals standing lookout for each other at watering holes. The creatures in this issue illustrate varying degrees of this cooperative behavior, whether living in constant and necessary proximity, or just trailing along, one behind the other, hoping to snag a snack.

The vast majority of Austrians cheer the Anschluss of their country by the German Reich. Central Europe is falling into Nazi hands and all the best European scientists will soon compete under the aegis of Heinrich Himmler, for whom no scheme is too wild or too improbable &mdash; but which team has the imagination, the courage, and the drive to most successfully accomplish their goals?<br/><br/>Secret Weapons of the Third Reich is a game for one to four players simulating the arms race of World War II from the German perspective. From secret submarine bases in Greenland to the mysterious Base 211 in Neuschwabenland, Antarctica, this game recreates the incredible tales of Nazi technology, from the famous V-1 buzz bombs and V-2 rockets to the unlikely flying saucers derived from the work of Nikola Tesla. Will players be able to deliver the Haunebu project to completion? Will Hans Kammler escape with his last battalion of flying saucers to the dark side of the moon? Will the secret submarine fleet sail to Antarctica to pursue the war after the war? Or could German scientists produce an atomic bomb to be dropped on New York by an electro-gravitational flying saucer or within the warhead of a futuristic intercontinental V-3? Would it even be possible to build a huge solar satellite gun to strike America?<br/><br/>In the game, each player controls one or more research groups, each working on a secret weapon project. Each research group has a leading researcher, who provides an initial bonus (expressed in resource cubes or scientist cylinders) when the project is assigned. The researcher has a regime loyalty value that measures both the ability to make requisition attempts and the ability to resist opposing attempts.<br/><br/>A player tries to get their projects approved, then completed. Certain requirements (resource cubes and/or scientist cylinders and technologies attached to projects) must be met and costs paid in order to reach the stage of development of a project. Each turn, approved projects generate specific amounts of resource cubes as funding. Completed projects award victory points (VP) and allow, in most cases, weapon production. Produced weapons award VP to the owning player in addition to helping to achieve a cooperative goal for all players. In fact, if together the players fail to reach a certain number of weapons produced by the end of the game, they all lose. The weapon production goal varies depending on the number of players.<br/><br/>Play begins in 1938, one year before the outbreak of world war. At the start, players can only place research groups for their approved projects (project plants) in the portion of the map representing Germany and Austria. In 1939 and later, the conquests of Nazi Germany allow players to deploy their project plants in occupied European territories &mdash; but players will have to pay attention to the various locations because some areas allow only research and development, others only weapon production, and still others only research and development for U-Boat projects.<br/><br/>Also, players must operate in a &quot;state of warfare&quot;. This means that as time goes on they are more and more subject to enemy bombardments that can cause a great loss of resources and technologies. In addition, as starting in 1943 Allied and Soviet advances on Berlin make the map progressively smaller, players must face logistical issues never encountered during the early years of the war.<br/><br/>Should a completed project or produced weapon fall into Allied hands, players not only lose VP, but the weapons production goal recedes as well! Thus a certain amount of player cooperation is a must. Each player must balance his personal interests with the common need to share technologies and resources in order to fulfill the common goal.<br/><br/>Last, but not least, via events one player may secretly become the turncoat, working in the shadows to help the enemy, and winning the game if all players would otherwise lose.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "1", "boardgameversion": ["4Dados edition", "The Game Crafter edition"], "name": "Secret Weapons of the Third Reich", "playingtime": "180", "boardgamemechanic": ["Card Drafting", "Co-operative Play", "Worker Placement"], "age": "12", "boardgameexpansion": ["207824"], "usersrated": "32", "average": "7.4375", "boardgamepodcastepisode": ["HLG 10: Meer Essen"]}, "168793": {"rpgdesigner": ["G\u00e1bor Lux"], "rpg": ["Helv\u00e9czia"], "statistics": [], "name": "Helv\u00e9czia: pikareszk szerepj\u00e1t\u00e9k", "rpgartist": ["Andreas Rocha"], "rpgproducer": ["M\u00e1ty\u00e1s Harty\u00e1ndi", "Attila Hatv\u00e1gner"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2298192.png", "usersrated": "0", "rpgitemversion": ["PDF Version"], "average": "0", "rpggenre": ["Fantasy (Sword & Sorcery)", "History (Europe)"], "rpgpublisher": ["(Web published)"], "rpgcategory": ["Core Rules (min needed to play)"], "poll": [], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2298192_t.png", "description": "Publisher's Description:<br/><br/>A Helv&eacute;czia szerepj&aacute;t&eacute;k szab&aacute;lyainak gy\u0171jtem&eacute;nye.

Players will either play a combination of at least two cards that equal exactly 10 to create a resource (called Elements), or they will play a combination of cards similar to the various types of Poker hands (pair, full house, etc.) to create the currency (called Energy) that works with the resources to let players build the modules.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, unidentified aliens are swarming around the station, and while the game is fully competitive, the players all must defend the station against the aliens or everyone loses.<br/><br/>"}, "168856": {"boardgamedesigner": ["Walter Obert"], "average": "4.58571", "poll": [], "name": "Op\u00e9ration Nez rouge: Le jeu", "playingtime": "20", "minplayers": "4", "boardgamemechanic": ["Acting", "Co-operative Play", "Partnerships"], "yearpublished": "2014", "usersrated": "7", "maxplayers": "8", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2302484_t.jpg", "boardgameartist": ["Olivier Fagn\u00e8re"], "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["(Unknown)", "Cocktail Games", "Filosofia \u00c9ditions"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2302484.jpg", "boardgameversion": ["First edition"], "maxplaytime": "20", "boardgamecategory": ["Party Game"], "age": "8", "minplaytime": "20", "description": "In Op&eacute;ration Nez rouge: Le jeu, players form teams of two persons: one driver and one passenger.

The first player to get all of his or her pawns there wins the game. Game is played by moving with cards that are in front of you. Some cards allow movement while others also ambushing other players.

This may very well be the first RPG that seriously and explicitly sets out to capture for the tabletop the unique feel of retro console RPGs like Ultima, Final Fantasy, Dragon Warrior, and others. To wit, Elegia is very much a game of combat and<br/>exploration, albeit in a simplified and abstracted sort of way. If you have come here looking for a dramatic narrative, you are in the wrong place. But neither is this game particularly &ldquo;old school&rdquo;, in the sense that players are expected to equip themselves realistically for an expedition, counting rope and rations and torches and henchmen, and then go searching every hexagon on the map for tombs and ruins to loot. If you have come here looking for a swords-and-sorcery sandbox to play in, you also are in the wrong place! Elegia is for players who want to wander around a world map, encounter random monsters, grind for gold and &ldquo;level-ups&rdquo;, exchange key items for plot points, and take the battle all the way to the &ldquo;final boss&rdquo;.<br/><br/>user comment:<br/>Elegia is the precursor to, or an early edition of, Retro Phaze.<br/><br/>from the Introduction to Retro Phaze<br/>Retro Phaze is a revision of Elegia, a new edition of the game with more than just the title getting a facelift. Excessive play-testing of the original game revealed its weakness, its imbalances, and its warts&mdash;those clunky little bits of inelegance which could use some smoothing over to make the game play better at the table. The upshot: Retro Phaze is not a thought experiment or an exercise in armchair RPG design. It is meant to be played. In the hands of a group that knows well and wants to embrace the tropes, modes, and clich&eacute;s so lovingly reproduced here, it&rsquo;s fun. You&rsquo;ll find no false modesty here: when done right, this game is really fun!<br/><br/>"}, "168887": {"rpgartist": ["Gabriel Orlando Dalguntas"], "rpg": ["Pathfinder System Compatible Product"], "poll": [], "name": "10 Paladin Magic Items", "rpgdesigner": ["Steven D.

A spy informed the South Vietnamese I Corps commander that an attack on the US Marine Base at Chu Lai by the NLF&rsquo;s (National Liberation Front) 1st Regiment was imminent. The Marine&rsquo;s commander, Lt. General Lewis W. Walt convinced his superiors that the best defense was a pre-emptive attack.

No military on the planet could have withstood the Wehrmacht&rsquo;s attack under the same conditions that France faced. Britain found refuge behind the Channel and Russia had a full year to prepare for the onslaught, while America was safe an entire ocean away &ndash; no one who shared a land border with Germany in 1940 was in a position to withstand the assault. Nonetheless, despite its early defeat, France had some superior vehicles in its arsenal which were as good as or better than their German counterparts.<br/><br/>This supplement for Traveller introduces many vehicles that formed the fighting arm of France in the Second World War, and provides full details of each, allowing them to be used within games. The weapons unique to France are also covered, along with enough information for you to use them in your own games and own vehicle designs.<br/><br/>Uses in Traveller<br/><br/>The vehicles found in this book could potentially form the basis of a campaign set in the Second World War. They may also be of interest to those who are simply curious as to how real-world vehicles can be implemented using the Traveller vehicle design system. However, we suspect many more players will want to actually use them in their games, even on planets far in the future and hundreds of light years away!<br/><br/>We have provided game mechanics for many vehicles, from the advanced Panhard 178, to the world-leading SOMUA S35 but, at the end of the day, an S35 need not look like an S35 if it were built to these specifications on an alien world. It could end up looking very different but have the same characteristics listed in this book. By this token, what this book provides is a solid set of military vehicles available at Tech Level 5. A referee can use them to fully flesh out a military force on a Tech Level 5 world and provide interesting variations on themes in order to give his world more depth.<br/><br/>For example, a referee creating a military force for a new world may simply design a single main battle tank for it before moving on to the artillery piece, the fighter plane, and so on. With this book, he can present a military force that has a defined timeline with the development of its vehicles, so there is not just one main battle tank but several, each a replacement of the one before though with all still in service, with the very best units getting the latest generation of tank.<br/><br/>Players can have fun with this book as well, especially if they are engaging in paramilitary actions or running their own mercenary force.
