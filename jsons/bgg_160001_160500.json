Each word laid out earns points based on the commonality of the letters used, with certain board spaces giving bonuses. But a word can only be played if it uses at least one already-played tile or adds to an already-played word. This leads to slightly tactical play, as potential words are rejected because they would give an opponent too much access to the better bonus spaces.<br/><br/>In Clue, players move from room to room in a mansion to solve the mystery of: who done it, with what, and where? Players are dealt character, weapon, and location cards after the top card from each card type is secretly placed in the confidential file in the middle of the board. Players must move to a room and then make an accusation against a character saying they did it in that room with a specific weapon. The player to the left must show one of any cards accused to the accuser if in that player's hand. Through deductive reasoning each player must figure out which character, weapon, and location are in the secret file. To do this, each player must uncover what cards are in other players hands by making more and more accusations. Once a player knows what cards the other players are holding they will know what cards are in the secret file. A great game for those who enjoy reasoning and thinking things out.<br/><br/>In Sorry!, players race their four game pieces from Start around the board to Home. By turning over a card from the draw deck and following its instructions, players move their pieces around the game board, switch places with players, and knock opponents' pieces off the track and back to their Start position.<br/><br/>Yahtzee is a classic dice game played with 5 dice. Each player's turn consists of rolling the dice up to 3 times in hope of making 1 of 13 categories. Examples of categories are 3 of a kind, 4 of a kind, straight, full house, etc. Each player tries to fill in a score for each category, but this is not always possible. When all players have entered a score or a zero for all 13 categories, the game ends and total scores are compared.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": {"241695": "English edition 2001"}, "name": "Family Game Night Book and Game Set: Scrabble, Clue, Sorry, Yahtzee", "playingtime": "60", "boardgamemechanic": {"2072": "Dice Rolling"}, "average": "6", "usersrated": "2", "boardgamefamily": {"71": "Cluedo"}}, "160002": {"statistics": {}, "name": "Boxhead: Biever & Baby", "videogamemode": {"2149": "Single-Player"}, "videogameversion": {"241696": "Web browser edition"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2051464.png", "videogameseries": {"25190": "Boxhead"}, "videogametheme": {"2659": "Zombies"}, "usersrated": "1", "average": "3", "videogamegenre": {"2155": "RPG"}, "videogameplatform": {"5084": "Web Browser"}, "poll": {}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2051464_t.png", "description": "User Summary<br/><br/>The instalment Boxhead: Biever &amp; Baby in the Boxhead series sees players assume the role of 'Justin Biever' or 'Baby Gaga' to fight off waves of zombies.

Howard, is a scenario-based semi-cooperative asymmetric miniatures board game. One player is the Opponent, playing the Opposition forces, and the other players (1 to 4) play Conan and his companions: Shevatas the thief, Hadrathus the Priest/Sorcerer, Belit the pirate queen, Valeria the warrior, etc. The game is based purely on Robert E. Howard's novels and short stories (and not the movies or other non-Howardian material). The publisher has hired Patrice Louinet, a Howard expert, to make sure the art and the scenarios are compatible with Howard's vision.<br/><br/>Each game is a scenario, played on a map. There will be several maps &mdash; Pictish Village, Underground temple, Tavern, Pirate ship, etc. &mdash; and each map can have several scenarios set on it. The game is fast, one hour approximately. It's possible to play several scenarios in a campaign, but you can also play each scenario individually. There will be a dozen playable scenarios in the base box.<br/><br/>At the beginning of a scenario, players choose their team (Conan and two or three other heroes). The Opponent gathers all the miniatures (picts, Necromancer, skeleton warriors, monsters, etc.), tokens, cards from the chosen scenario. The game usually plays in a limited number of turns (ten, for instance). Each scenario can have very different objectives: find the princess captured by picts and hidden in a hut and leave the camp before the pict hunters return; find the magical key to open a sealed door, steal the jewel and leave; kill the Necromancer by the end of turn 10; survive by the end of turn 10; escape the prison; etc.<br/><br/>During their turn, the heroes can activate or rest. If they activate, they can spend &quot;gems&quot; from their energy pool to do all sorts of actions: move, fight (melee or distance), defend, pick a lock, reroll, etc. If they rest, they can move a lot of gems from their &quot;spent&quot; pool box to their &quot;available&quot; pool box. When they take an action, they throw a number of dice equal to the number of gems they put in their action. There are three different kinds of dice: yellow (the weaker dice), orange (medium) and red (strong). Each character has a color based on their specialty: Conan throws red dice in combat while the Sorcerer throws yellow dice in combat; the thief throws red dice in Manipulation actions, while Conan throws orange dice; etc. Each player can have equipment cards (armor, magic potions, weapons, etc.) which give them bonuses on their dice rolls.<br/><br/>The Opponent plays differently. He uses a board with eight slidable tiles, plus his own Energy gems. Each tile corresponds to one unit (1 to 3 miniatures) on the game mat, and all of the miniature abilities are written on this tile (movement, armor, attack, special abilities). The tile position on the board corresponds to the numbers 1-8. The Opponent has a pool of energy gems and each time he activates one unit, he needs to spend a number of gems matching the tile placement: tile#1 costs 1 energy gem, tile#2 costs 2 gems, etc. Whatever tile the Opponent chooses to activate, he spends the corresponding energy cost (moving his energy gems from the available pool to the spent pool), then takes the tile out and moves it to the end of the sliding track: If he wants to activate this unit again, it will cost him 8 gems, because the unit is now on position 8. The Opponent can activate a maximum of two tiles, and he regains only a certain number of gems each turn (depending on the scenario).<br/><br/>In a typical scenario, the heroes need to accomplish something and the Opponent wins if the heroes fail to reach their objective &mdash; but in some scenarios, the Opponent has his own objectives and the Heroes win if they prevent him from accomplishing his goal.<br/><br/>Components (according to the back of the box):<br/><br/>     16 spell cards (in either English or French)<br/>     39 equipment cards (in either English or French)<br/>     60 tiles (actually 75, see below)<br/>     161 tokens<br/>     8 Hero sheets (one side in English, the other in French)<br/>     4 player aid sheets (one side in English, the other in French)<br/>     1 turn counter sheet (both sides in English)<br/>     1 Hero rule book (in either English or French)<br/>     1 Overlord rulebook (13 scenarios) (in either English or French)<br/>     2 map boards<br/>     15 dice<br/>     75 &quot;gems&quot; (blue and red)<br/>     25 coloured bases (5 each in red, orange, green, blue, purple)<br/>     106 miniatures (plastic)<br/>     1 Overlord board (plastic)<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>The tiles need to be looked at more closely. 13 come in English-French pairs, another 35 are in the edition's language (either French or English), and the remaining 14 tiles come in non-lingual pairs (two each of Khosatral Khel, Skuthus, Thak, Zaporavo, and Zogar Sag, plus four Thog). The campaign book and adventure booklets use two tiles for Constantius, Khosatral Khel, Thog, Zaporavo, and Zogar Sag. Conan: Nordheim includes a scenario that uses three Atali tiles. The non-lingual pairs (or the Thog quadruplet) are thus probably intended to be all used. This means a functional set of tiles is 62 strong, the remaining 13 tiles being set aside.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": {"241716": "English first edition"}, "maxplaytime": "120", "average": "8.02137", "name": "Conan", "playingtime": "120", "boardgamemechanic": {"2001": "Action Point Allowance System"}, "age": "14", "boardgameexpansion": {}, "usersrated": "1836", "boardgameaccessory": {"213892": "Conan: Dice Pack"}, "boardgamesubdomain": {"5496": "Thematic Games"}, "boardgamefamily": {"24281": "Campaign Games"}}, "160011": {"boardgamedesigner": {"70558": {"name": "Lucrezia"}}, "average": "9", "poll": {}, "name": "I Sumeri di Ur, Uruk, Nippur e Lagash", "playingtime": "20", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": {"2041": "Card Drafting"}, "yearpublished": "2014", "usersrated": "1", "maxplayers": "4", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2205180_t.jpg", "boardgameartist": {"70558": "Lucrezia"}, "statistics": {}, "boardgamepublisher": {"27637": {"name": "Lumaca Games"}}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2205180.jpg", "boardgameversion": {"241717": "Italian first edition"}, "maxplaytime": "20", "boardgamecategory": {"1041": {"name": "Children's Game"}}, "age": "8", "minplaytime": "20", "description": "This game is for pupils aged 8-9 years, studing the Mesopotamic Sumerian Civilization.<br/><br/>Farm your land, harvest your grain, build your city, commerce with your neighbours... it gives a taste of how the Mesopotamian agricolture and first cities worked.<br/><br/>Each player is the king of one of the Sumerian cities of the title;  in every seasonal turn, the king must choose which building to build in its city, each building is represented by the tiles taken at the start of each turn.

The room can also be used as a war room monitoring conflagrations that flare up around the world for the League of Nations or United Nations for a game focusing more on diplomacy.<br/><br/>War Room is a single room, internal view map of a military command center featuring a large table with a world map of Earth for the use of tracking troop movements as well as desk telephones to relay that information and orders to men in the field. This product includes a 360-degree panoramic view from the center of the room.<br/><br/>The world map of Earth could easily be replaced, just print out a different world map and place it over the center table instead.<br/><br/>War Room is intended for use in modern games.<br/><br/>Adventure hook for use with this product.<br/><br/>Decapitate the Enemy: A fortified enemy castle is being used as a base for an enemy war room communicating and relaying tactical data to units in the vicinity. Bombardment with bombers has proven ineffectual, as flak guns have been placed in castle towers, the courtyard, and anywhere else with enough space and a view of the skies above. Heavy tanks have been placed at the front of the gate. They don&rsquo;t have enough gas to move much, but the combination of their cannons and the flaks won&rsquo;t let armor get anywhere near the place. Heavy enemy activity in the area also hampers ground forces moving artillery into an entrenched nearby position where it can bombard the castle from afar.<br/><br/>The Player Characters are a special forces team that have been &ldquo;volunteered&rdquo; for the dubious honor of being dropped behind enemy lines with the task of finding a way into the castle from the rear, sneaking into the castle, and then securing the war room and capturing the enemy officers to completely decapitate the enemy command and control in the area. The hope is this will break enemy morale forcing them to retreat from the region or surrender as they are cut off from support due to uncoordinated unit movements.<br/><br/>The Player Characters are given a wide array of special weapons to choose from including flamethrowers, heavy machine guns, rocket launchers, grenades, dynamite, sniper rifles, submachine guns, petrol bombs, or anything else they can think of. They also have a radio to call in air support as a distraction when they attempt to enter the enemy base.<br/><br/>Maps that work well with this scenario include our Western Keep for the aboveground castle, The Cellar (as the basement area just before getting to the War Room for a good old shootout), and finally the War Room where they must subdue the enemy officers through any means at their disposal.<br/><br/>"}, "160065": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2255778.jpg", "poll": {}, "boardgamedesigner": {"3": {"name": "(Uncredited)"}}, "statistics": {}, "yearpublished": "0", "maxplayers": "10", "boardgameartist": {"64493": "Beatrice Braun-Fock"}, "boardgamepublisher": {"8454": {"name": "Jos.

For example, there are only six altitude levels in FLAC, which is a fraction of what it should be, but trying to keep track of a vast array of altitudes can be tedious. Also, it would not make for fast, fun game play because aircraft at very different altitudes do not interact well.

The mighty fortress Caer Syllan keeps a protective eye over its harbour which hosts ships from all over the world coming to trade for the precious metals and gems pulled from the nearby mines. A muddy, noisy place, Wolverton is home to hardy frontier folk eking a living from the earth while contending with half-goblin tribes, packs of shadow wolves and other monsters dwelling in the nearby Tangled Woods.<br/><br/>Although the town serves as Lord Locher&rsquo;s seat and the capital of the Lonely Coast Wolverton&rsquo;s muddy streets are far from safe. While regular patrols ward Wolverton and the surrounding villages from monstrous incursions, new threats rise to weaken the Lochers&rsquo; iron-fisted grip. Merchants tired of high taxes and tariffs secretly plot ways to take power while in the streets smuggler gangs fight one another in a vicious turf war. Beyond these threats lurk even greater dangers. In a black stone tower, a vile necromancer plots his path to lichdom and the conquest of the Lonely Coast while a villainous monster secretly makes his home in the previously abandoned sea caves of Morveren&rsquo;s Galley. Thus, brave adventurers will always find a welcome among the folk of Wolverton!

They can help their masters to do away with surplus quests, or cause trouble for the other gods by imposing more quests on them. However, take care when you do this because all such acts remain in memory as bad karma. If you manage to complete all of your quests, your accumulated bad karma will be ignored, but if you fail and have quests remaining, they will become a heavy burden.<br/><br/>You will need to determine when to silently do your chores and when to use your servants to increase your chances of success.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": {"241943": "English first edition"}, "age": "0", "name": "Gods' Gambit", "playingtime": "0", "boardgamemechanic": {"2040": "Hand Management"}, "average": "6.3127", "usersrated": "126", "boardgamefamily": {"8374": "Crowdfunding: Kickstarter"}}, "160126": {"rpg": {"356": "Generic / Universal"}, "poll": {}, "name": "Wardenhale: City Core Set", "rpgproducer": {"72892": "J.

At first glance, TAU seems to be a lot of different things: a card game, a role-playing game, and a collaborative storytelling game. The rules for such a game could be ridiculously complicated, but we have pared it down to the simplest elements to make the game easy to learn and to have as few limits as possible on the group's creativity.<br/><br/>TAU is played with communal storytelling, meaning that it does not need pencil, paper, or dice; only the Players' minds are needed to determine outcomes.  The game usually starts out with the Players finding their characters facing a series of potentially lethal challenges from which in all likelihood the players' characters will not survive.  The winner is the Player of the last Character standing, or at least still alive - plenty of games have been won prone!  Remember, TAU (T) is the Greek letter symbolizing death and rebirth.  Don't be afraid to take creative and entertaining risks!  There's always another round!<br/><br/>These rules are optimized for a group of five: four Players, and one Storyteller.<br/><br/>User added information:<br/><br/>TAU has three phases: the Trick phase, the Character phase, and the Storytelling phase.<br/><br/>The Trick phase is similar to a standard trick-taking game such as Hearts or Spades.  Each card in the game contains not only attributes for RPG characters, but also a suit and rank of a standard 52-card deck.  Only the Players take part in the Trick phase - the Storyteller never has any cards.<br/><br/>The Character phase consists of the Players taking one card from each trick they won and creating their character with the results.  If a player won no tricks, he takes three cards from the discards of the other Players.<br/><br/>The Storytelling phase is the RPG phase.  The Storyteller (GM) creates a situation in which the Player Characters are in grave danger.  The Players can react with their Character cards, but eventually all will die.  The last Player Character alive wins the round, and another round is then dealt out and played through all three phases.  Players play as many rounds as desired, but the essence of the game is that all Characters always die!<br/><br/>"}, "160244": {"statistics": {}, "name": "Heroes Weekly (Vol 2, Issue 3 - The Archer)", "rpgproducer": {"5349": "Robert Hemminger"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2745386.jpg", "usersrated": "0", "average": "0", "rpgissue": {"23982": "Heroes Weekly"}, "rpgissuearticle": {"165182": "Archer"}, "rpg": {"2791": "Pathfinder System Compatible Product"}, "rpgissueversion": {"242155": "PDF version"}, "poll": {}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2745386_t.jpg", "description": "From publisher blurb:<br/><br/>Archer Advanced Class<br/><br/>A great new advanced class this week with the super archer.

These tales of cops and robbers, sleuths and spies, and other forms of modern action constantly play out in people&rsquo;s imagination. With that premise in mind, we present this book that allows you to craft a contemporary setting of your very  own, populated by evil villains and desperate situations that call upon the very best your heroes have to offer.<br/><br/>It&rsquo;s a game of your imagination where you get to tell stories by taking on the rolls of the characters that you create. It&rsquo;s a game that offers a multitude of choices &ndash; more choices than even the most sophisticated computer game, because the only limit to what you can do is what you can imagine. The story unfolds like a movie, except all the action takes place within your own imagination.<br/><br/>This volume, the Modern Campaign Setting for the 4th edition of Dungeons &amp; Dragons&reg; game, offers a wealth of new character options, including a new race and new classes, new skills, and new feats. It introduces the craft power source used by the Smart Hero, along with a new approach to summoning creatures.<br/><br/>Chapter 1 introduces a new race for a high tech campaign world. The Robot makes its d&eacute;but within these pages and provides different options depending on the Progress Level of the campaign. Six new classes make up most of chapter 2. These classes are the Charismatic Hero, Fast Hero, Psychic Hero, Smart Hero, Strong Hero, and the Tough Hero. To add a bit a flare new hybrid classes are also given for each of the main classes for this book, and are compatible with the fantasy setting hybrid classes for more customization. Also in this chapter are 6 new epic destinies that take full advantage of a modern setting and allow your imagination to take off.<br/><br/>Chapter 3 includes a variety of new options for characters of every class. First are new skills that allow a character to fully interact with the modern world, and additions to older skills found in the Players Handbook. New feats provide additional opportunities for characters to specialize and customize their characters to fully obtain what they had envisioned for it. New backgrounds called occupations that better reflect a modern environment are also present and provide the players the ability to adjust their character in more subtle ways. New to the 4thedition setting but found in earlier settings, Leadership and Reputation make a comeback and allow players to fully realize the true power of a modern campaign. Leadership and reputation are also compatible with the fantasy version of 4thedition in order to bring something new to the table.<br/><br/>The meat and bones of chapter 4 are  the weapons and equipment for all progress levels. New to the 4th edition system is the Gadget and Upgrade system  which  allows Players and Dungeon Masters the ability to fully customize a weapons and equipment from scratch or simply upgrade already designed items. Also new to the 4th edition system is updated vehicle operation rules and crafting rules to create your own equipment.<br/><br/>Chapter 5, the final chapter contains all the fluff that helps you fully immerse yourself in a modern or futuristic setting. Everything in this chapter is optional and should only be used to enhance an adventure. Within this chapter you will find rules for living and lifestyle, space travel, mutations, superpowers, and much more.<br/><br/>"}, "160269": {"statistics": {}, "name": "Heroes Weekly (Vol 3, Issue 2 - Iconoclast)", "rpgproducer": {"5349": "Robert Hemminger"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2748316.jpg", "usersrated": "0", "average": "0", "rpgissue": {"23982": "Heroes Weekly"}, "rpgissuearticle": {"165327": "Figure Flats"}, "rpg": {"2791": "Pathfinder System Compatible Product"}, "rpgissueversion": {"242182": "PDF version"}, "poll": {}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2748316_t.jpg", "description": "From publisher blurb:<br/><br/>Iconoclast<br/><br/>Super Robots gone wrong or just misunderstood.

During the course of this expedition, Don Lope de Aguirre (later known as The Madman and The Tyrant) assassinated the conquistador leading the expedition and the nobleman he propped up in his stead before taking over the expedition personally. Recognizing that El Dorado was a myth and that the only gold to be found was back in Peru, Aguirre declared himself Prince of Peru and changed the purpose of his expedition to overthrow the Pizzaros and take over the country for himself. Sailing down the Amazon and Orinoco rivers, Aguirre's expedition faced all manner of challenges in the form of disease, privation, navigation, lack of morale, and attacks from the natives, against whom Aguirre committed barbaric atrocities (there are portions of South America where Aguirre's name is still used as a curse today). Members of Aguirre's expedition discovered to their dismay that the most dangerous of all the challenges, however, was Aguirre's growing paranoia. One by one, Aguirre executed his own men when he grew suspicious of them, sometimes with cause, more often without. Ultimately, Aguirre managed to capture a Spanish fort before being besieged by government forces, when he was executed by one of his own men, one of the few survivors of his ill-fated expedition.<br/><br/>In the game, players will take on the role of one of the unfortunate members of Aguirre's expedition. Their goal? To accumulate enough influence to overthrow Aguirre before they are executed in turn. In the end, only one player will survive Aguirre&rsquo;s paranoia. Only one player will be able to accumulate enough influence to overthrow him. Only one player will emerge from the depths of hell on earth to tell the tale of The Tyrant Aguirre!<br/><br/>The principal game mechanics are role/action selection and set collection. Players will earn Influence (victory) Points through a variety of methods, including influencing prominent members of the expedition (the role/action selection part of the game), purchasing Supply Cards (the set collection part of the game), and overcoming thematic challenges. One of these challenges is the &quot;paranoia phase,&quot; in which one of the roles/actions is removed from the game every turn, resulting in a diminishing array of role/actions for players to choose from as the game progresses. The game challenges players to use reactive and adaptive strategy, as players must frequently shift and adjust what they want to do in the game according to the changing conditions of the game.<br/><br/>Aguirre is a fast-paced game for 2-6 players and lasts 30-90 minutes depending on the number of players.<br/><br/>"}, "160392": {"statistics": {}, "name": "Worlds Without Master (Volume 1, Issue 4 - Jun 2014)", "rpgproducer": {"13507": "Emily Care Boss"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2081302.jpg", "usersrated": "2", "average": "9", "rpgissue": {"23678": "Worlds Without Master"}, "rpgissuearticle": {"120279": "Oh, The Beating Drum"}, "rpgissueversion": {"242374": "PDF version"}, "poll": {}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2081302_t.jpg", "description": "From publisher blurb:<br/><br/>Issue four of Worlds Without Master, an adventure fiction and gaming ezine featuring sword &amp; sorcery short fiction and games from Epidiah Ravachol and many others.<br/><br/>In this issue:<br/><br/>     &quot;Two Swords of Mars,&quot; a tale of swashbuckling upon the red planet, by Rose Bailey.<br/>     &quot;The Prize of Banteteth,&quot; another Snorri &amp; Manyara tale by Epidiah Ravachol.<br/>     Illustrations by Gary McCluskey and Jon Taylor.<br/>     More &quot;Oh, the Beating Drum!&quot; from Bryant Paul Johnson.<br/>     A supplement to Enter the Avenger (found in issue 1) by Rafu.<br/>     And a full-color cover by Rachel Kahn<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>"}, "160393": {"rpgitemversion": {"242377": "PDF version"}, "poll": {}, "name": "Fangs of the Viper", "rpgproducer": {"14933": "Jason E.

I mean things were O.K. for the first couple of months. There certainly wasn't much guarding to do. If a native did appear, a quick warning blast from my laser blast would send it scurrying away, but then ...... As soon as the whole of the Tele-Portal network was powered up, they attacked, we guards tried to stop them but there were just too many of them ... and now there's only me left, my control circuitry is damaged, I can't switch my motors off, so the only thing I can do to slow down is slam the brake units on, but that doesn't do much good.<br/><br/>I must pick up the fuel cells and go through the Tele-Portal to soak up some more energy, it's running so low, so tired ...<br/><br/>OH NO!!!! Here they come again.... H-E-L-P!!!!<br/><br/>User Summary<br/><br/>The user controls a robot which is constantly moving forward. The player can rotate left and right. The robot can also brake, which means it both moves more slowly and has a tighter turning circle.<br/><br/>On each level, the robot needs to pick up four fuel cells, which immediately then move to surround the Tele-Portal. When all are collected, the Robot can go through the Tele-Portal to the next level.<br/><br/>Progress is hindered by aliens on screen, which can be shot. The robot starts with full batteries. Energy is lost through collisions with aliens, or using the brake. A bonus counts down while playing the level. This is added to the energy reserve when you complete the level.

This cabal has subtly manipulated events for hundreds of years according to the delicate schemes of its oldest and most patient members, so that key members of the cabal will be next in line when a power structure caves.<br/>     The Cult of Man: Fiercely anti-deistic, the Cult of Man rejects divinity as a distinct concept, holding that the difference between a bound spirit and a patron god is merely a matter of scale. They condemn the arrogance of gods in their self-righteousness. Its members tend to be older, of a learned and scholarly bent, and concerned with personal power (or a personal grudge against the divine) above all else.<br/>     The Lantern Collective: Known variously as the Silver Lanterns, Lumineers, Day Stars and a host of other names and aliases, it isn&rsquo;t entirely clear how far the organization&rsquo;s influence spreads. The Lantern Collective is devoted to the sacred pursuit of knowledge, and the subversion and sabotage of those who conceal that knowledge. It celebrates spirit binding for its ability to join the minds of the past with the minds of the present. Its own clandestine binding secrets, of course, are not included in this sacred calling, leading to not-occasional accusations of hypocrisy. Joining the Collective is not easy; typically it finds one before one finds it.<br/>     Path of Ia: A frighteningly well-equipped and well-spoken doomsday cult, the Path of Ia holds the firm belief that the fundamental truth of mortal existence exists at the very center of the world, and that all one needs to discover it is to physically split the planet open. To that end, they seek the assistance of their eldritch patron Ia to force open the planet and achieve blissful nirvana in its radiant depths.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>"}, "160405": {"boardgamedesigner": {"72130": {"name": "Manuel D.

The person with the smallest feet starts first. A player wins a round when she has the &quot;true&quot; Cinderella. To find the &quot;true&quot; Cinderella, each player lays down a card. The card dictates which card will be or won't be the real Cinderella. When a card is laid down, everyone secretly votes whether or not they want the new rule for that round. This repeats until each player has played two cards. Then everyone reveals their hand, and whoever has the card that matches all the rules laid out in the round is the winner for having the &quot;true&quot; Cinderella. In cases of ties, the winner is the player with the highest card.<br/><br/>Game #3 in 'The Mike Line' of games from Grail Games.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": {"257595": "English first edition"}, "age": "10", "name": "Too Many Cinderellas", "playingtime": "10", "boardgamemechanic": {"2017": "Voting"}, "average": "6.45777", "usersrated": "412", "boardgamefamily": {"26414": "The Mike Line"}}, "160410": {"boardgamedesigner": {"11402": {"name": "Gary Brown"}}, "poll": {}, "name": "GridZone Football", "playingtime": "0", "minplayers": "1", "boardgamemechanic": {"2072": "Dice Rolling"}, "yearpublished": "2014", "usersrated": "5", "maxplayers": "1", "average": "6.6", "statistics": {}, "boardgamepublisher": {"1001": {"name": "(Web published)"}}, "boardgameversion": {"242404": "English edition 2014"}, "maxplaytime": "0", "boardgamecategory": {"1120": {"name": "Print & Play"}}, "age": "0", "minplaytime": "0", "description": "It is a fast-paced game of 7-on-7 football, based on a fictional sport, where field position translates to points.

It has long been known that our teeth are under constant attack form a form of oral bacteria known as Dentorium Kamikazium: The DK. Little has been known about the life cycle of the DK but the recent research has revealed a startling fact. Bacteriologists believe that the DK's life span was limited because the mechanism by which it attacked teeth led to its own destruction (see 'The Kamikazi Effect', Shimoto 1973.) What Shimoto did not realise however was that the DK's destruction was not permanent. It is able to rejuvenate after each attack upon a small tooth and this, far from having a short life is in fact immortal! This discovery has led inevitably to a radical change in our attitudes to tooth decay. No longer are we able to believe that decay can be eradicated completely. The indestructability of the DK means that we can only hope to reduce it by constant use of the toothbrush and toothpaste. On a happier note, the research has led to the development of DKX 11. This chemical has the effect of interrupting the normal DK cycle, thereby forcing it to rejuvenate early. When introduced into toothpaste, DKX 11 can extend the life of a tooth by as much as 90%. Those are the facts. This is the challenge. You have an limitless supply of Magico toothpaste (containing DKX 11) and three toothbrushes with which to prevent the DK's from destroying your teeth.<br/><br/>User summary:<br/><br/>Molar Maul is a bizarre game, where the player controls a toothbrush charged with keeping a mouth clean in the face of an onslaught of bacteria. The player must man&oelig;uvre the toothbrush to a tube, which will deposit some toothpaste. The teeth are initially yellow (presumably indicating normal dirt), but when attacked by the bacteria, they change colour through light and dark blue, to finally black when the tooth has completely decayed. An undecayed tooth can be brought back to white by brushing the tooth. Using ten squirts of toothpaste completes the level and the player moves on to a more dangerous set of bacteria. The player's toothbrush is not vulnerable to the bacteria, but losing 4 teeth to decay means that one of the three toothbrushes is lost.<br/><br/>Credits:<br/><br/>By John Gibson<br/><br/>"}, "160413": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2410759.png", "poll": {}, "boardgamedesigner": {"68715": {"name": "Clayton Grey"}}, "statistics": {}, "yearpublished": "2015", "maxplayers": "4", "boardgameartist": {"67262": "Samuel Strick"}, "boardgamepublisher": {"24617": {"name": "Laboratory Games"}}, "maxplaytime": "20", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2410759_t.png", "minplaytime": "20", "boardgamecategory": {"1022": {"name": "Adventure"}}, "description": "Arkham is a city under the constant threat of cosmic terror. Dark forces work behind the scenes to undermine the fabric of reality. One has the sense that if Arkham were to fall, it may spell the end of everything. But darkness has ways of being seen. The Ring of Shadows has been found, or maybe wanted to be found, at this critical hour. It's up to the citizens of the Miskatonic Valley to work together to wield its awful power to stop the end before it begins.<br/><br/>In Shadow of the Elder Gods, 1-4 players take on the roles of citizens of Arkham who work together to prevent cosmic horrors from unraveling reality. Shadow focuses on dealing with the consequences of dark forces conspiring against players, rather than combat. Players take turns spending actions to travel the streets of Arkham researching Knowledge, hiring Muscle, collecting Assets, and dealing with Threats.<br/><br/>Each game revolves around an inevitable danger to Arkham which is represented by the Threat Deck, a constructed deck of cards which players must survive in order to banish the Elder Threat and win the game. Each threat card features an Arkham face and a Shadow face. The Arkham faces represents the visible manifestations of the unseemly things found on the Shadow faces of the cards. Whenever the player with the Threat Start Marker begins their turn, a Threat token is placed on the current Threat Card and the indicated damage is dealt to players or locations. The first/last card represents the unique Elder Threat which players must contend with in order to win.<br/><br/>The player who possesses the Ring of Shadows is able to view the Shadow side of the Threat Deck and deal with the Threat at hand by using what resources they have, but they expose themselves and others to harm in the process. If players manage to survive their final encounter with the Elder Threat in the shadows, they unceremoniously save the world from incomprehensible danger.

The supply lines created this way continue to reinforce the war zones until the orders are changed or the enemy manages to conquer a link in the chain.<br/><br/>The game can be played alone versus AI opponents, via network in competitive or cooperative modes and features a progression system where winning matches slowly expands your selection of active abilities.<br/><br/>"}, "160428": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2048671.jpg", "poll": {}, "boardgamedesigner": {"75884": {"name": "Francisco Qui\u00f1ones Aguilera"}}, "statistics": {}, "yearpublished": "0", "maxplayers": "4", "boardgameartist": {"60854": "Vincent Devault"}, "boardgamepublisher": {"27531": {"name": "RN estudio"}}, "maxplaytime": "90", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2048671_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "90", "boardgamecategory": {"1022": {"name": "Adventure"}}, "description": "After The End approaches humankind status after a world apocalypse and more specifically, the fight for survival in a hostile environment (Hostile environment=Toxic atmosphere) where everyone wants the same for their people.

The game befalls along some &ldquo;Days&rdquo;, each one of them is divided in four &ldquo;Turns&rdquo; (6 hours each). The &ldquo;Stormboard&rdquo; measures game length and every player must always have an eye on it, because they have to be back inside their Shelters before that one arrives&hellip; and it does indeed.

Furthermore It has Mission cards that can be gotten in certain &ldquo;Zones&rdquo;, which pretty motivates players interaction, besides &ldquo;Radio Missions&rdquo; and &ldquo;Individual Missions&rdquo;.<br/><br/>IS THERE ANYTHING ELSE APART FROM PLAYERS INTERACTION?<br/><br/>There will be continuous barter, business in the Trading Bazaar, Mercenaries control, Pathfinding, Dogs or Street Children. Caravan dealing and Gambling Houses; provisionally taking refuge in Camps, to put on a Gas Mask in order to not obtaining too much &ldquo;Deterioration&rdquo;, climbing and trying to get out unhurt from &ldquo;Devastated Zones&rdquo;. Dragging on Supplies Boxes towards your Shelter, covered in warm clothes to protect you from the outdoor; fights against Predators and Raiders ambushes&hellip; and if you can do it in a modified vehicle looking with Binoculars, that&acute;s better, isn&acute;t it?<br/><br/>WELL, I MISS SOMETHING IN IT:<br/><br/>General Catastrophes, Event cards, enemies that remain on the board and move, 37 Zones and a different board in each game, 3 different board centers, combat system with a single roll (ALWAYS is resolved with a single roll), making your own weapons and improving them, or find them along the way, personalized missions for each Searcher, and we start with 8 Searchers with two capabilities to choose each one of them&hellip; Who said versatility?<br/><br/>FINALLY:<br/><br/>&ldquo;After The End&rdquo; is a game from 1 to 4 players that tries to approach a long forgotten theme in board games as far as I know: the fight for survival in the manner of Mad Max, Fallout, I&acute;m Alive or Metro 2033. If you enjoy these masterpieces, without any doubt you should have to check &ldquo;After The End&rdquo;.<br/><br/>Here you don&acute;t lead an army, nor a survivors group, nor a gang, nor a nation&hellip; it is just your Searcher against the world and the others Searchers, fighting hard for surviving in a devastated and hostile world, and bringing back to his/her Shelter everything is possible before the Storm comes back&hellip;<br/><br/>I can&acute;t say good bye without telling the reason I did ATE one year and a half ago: I wanted myself a survival game in a post-apocalyptic world, I searched and searched again and I found some titles touching the theme, but not in the way I wanted.

At the beginning of the game each player is dealt a handful of DAED cards - these represent powers, abilities and resources of your individual kingdom. On each turn, a player draws a card from the WYRD Deck, which is composed of monsters, events, hardships, and instances drawn from the source text and the greater Viking Age. The player must either face the consequences, or reap the benefits of these cards, and can use their DAED cards to repel or augment the effect of the WYRD Deck. In addition, players can attempt to raid one another for their DAED cards. Successfully defeating a Monster drawn from the WYRD Deck nets you a Trophy - in the form of some grisly piece of the felled creature - which acts as a counter for your Kingdom's greatness.<br/><br/>All the while, each draw of the WYRD Deck moves Beowulf further along his life path on the game board, with each stop dramatically affecting the stakes of the WYRD Deck.

He wanders his now well-worn beat around the jewellery and watch counters considering his predicament. It's a hectic life for the hardened crime fighter when he has to look after lost children taking them to the lost children office in the top left hand corner of the shop. Rushing lost umbrellas and bags to the lost property office ready for their careless owners to fetch, the lost property office is in the top right hand corner of the shop.<br/>At least some variety enters the action when the occasional bungling shop lifter attempts to remove a box off the counter and get away with it. Barney only has to grab the box and return it to the manger's office to prove he was shoplifting, but watch those shoplifters run as you try to grab that box, they hide the box under their coats and you have to keep your eye on him in case he gets mixed up with the other shoppers. The manager resides opposite the main exit in the lower left hand corner of the shop.<br/>There is one time our hero has reason to panic - when the occasional customer drops a parcel bomb in the rows between the counters. The only option left open to him is to grab the bomb and make a run for the double doors at the exit. Of course do something like that and you're well on your way to instant promotion to the next level.<br/>Barney's only aim in life is to be promoted to the next level of play by earning the respect of this manager, of course if that opinion drops below 0% then he will be given a written warning and taken down a level. Three written warnings and you're fired, you can always increase your chances by moving up two levels, the manager will be so pleased he will remove one written warning.<br/>Always keep an eye on the time because at 6 o'clock in the evening it is late night shopping and more customers will appear. You will look forward to 8 o'clock and closing time more than ever but be prepared for the following day and yet more hordes of harrassed housewives.<br/><br/>Credits:<br/><br/>By Eugene Evans<br/><br/>"}, "160490": {"rpg": {"9041": "Mutants & Masterminds (3rd Edition)"}, "poll": {}, "name": "Grackle", "rpgproducer": {"68453": "C.

Through this, Ying Zheng became the first emperor in Chinese history, taking the title of Qin Shi Huang Di.<br/><br/>Plenty of things had to change in order to make the Chinese empire whole, and Qin Shi Huang Di didn't waste any time. He divided the empire into prefectures, personally appointing central and local functionaries; afterward, he decreed that the same writing symbols had to be used throughout the entire nation. Furthermore, he unified the laws and the units of measure, particularly the currency, creating amazing conditions for the economic development and growth of the empire.<br/><br/>Internal decisions were not the only things that shaped this new unified nation. From the North, the menace of the Hsiungnu barbarians kept shaking the empire, and Qin Shi Huang Di knew that the only way to stop that menace was to build one of the most ambitious buildings in human history: The Great Wall of China. Thousands of peasants left their fields to take part in the construction, not only of the Great Wall, but also of roads, channels, palaces, and majestic buildings.<br/><br/>In ZhanGuo, you are the emperor's emissaries, and you have been assigned the challenging task of contributing to the process of unifying the empire, helping to build the wall, and all infrastructures needed. During the five rounds of the game, you must make the best of the few cards you get each round. You can play each card either on your own player board to increase your personal power in the empire, or on the game board to recruit manpower, construct buildings wanted by the emperor, call reinforcements from Qin, and move the armies from kingdom to kingdom.<br/><br/>Each player has to choose the best time and best way to play his cards in order to earn the emperor&rsquo;s favors. Careful, though, because trying to get too much power, or exploiting the workers for personal gain could increase dissatisfaction among the populace, and consequently increase the risk of uprisings in the newly added kingdoms.

Maybe it's the lights, maybe it's the energy, or maybe it's the giant monsters trying to demolish the place!<br/><br/>King of New York is a standalone game from designer Richard Garfield that keeps the core ideas of King of Tokyo while introducing new ways to play. As in KoT, your goal is to be the first monster to collect 20 victory points (VPs) or to be the last monster standing. On your turn, you roll six dice up to three times, then carry out the actions on those dice. Claws cause damage to other monsters, hearts heal damage to yourself, and energy is stored up so that you can purchase power cards that provide unique effects not available to anyone else.<br/><br/>What's new in King of New York is that you can now try to become a star in the big city; more specifically, you can achieve &quot;Fame&quot;, which nets you VPs, but superstar status is fleeting, so enjoy your time in the spotlight.<br/><br/>The game board for King of New York is larger than in KoT with each monster occupying a district in the city and everyone trying to shine in Manhattan. When you attack, you can displace a monster in another district, whether to escape military forces or to find new smashing opportunities. Yes, smashing because you can now destroy buildings and get bonuses for doing so, but the more destruction you cause, the more intense the military response.<br/><br/>The monsters from King of New York can be used in KoT and vice versa, but the power cards are specific to this game.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": {"242568": "English first edition"}, "average": "7.17406", "name": "King of New York", "playingtime": "40", "boardgamemechanic": {"2080": "Area Control / Area Influence"}, "age": "10", "boardgameexpansion": {}, "usersrated": "8978", "boardgameaccessory": {"195552": "King of Tokyo/King of New York: Iron Rook"}, "boardgamesubdomain": {"5499": "Family Games"}, "boardgamefamily": {"13111": "Cities: New York (New York, USA)"}}, "160500": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2038460.jpg", "poll": {}, "boardgamedesigner": {"398": {"name": "Klaus-J\u00fcrgen Wrede"}}, "statistics": {}, "boardgamecompilation": {"66646": "Carcassonne: Bridges, Castles, and Bazaars"}, "yearpublished": "2012", "maxplayers": "5", "age": "8", "boardgamepublisher": {"18852": {"name": "Hobby World"}}, "maxplaytime": "30", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2038460_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "30", "boardgamecategory": {"1029": {"name": "City Building"}}, "description": "This edition of Carcassonne: Wheel of Fortune includes the Bridges, Castles and Bazaars expansion.<br/><br/>Carcassonne: Wheel of Fortune is both a full replacement for the base game of Carcassonne and an expansion to the original base game. It includes 72 tiles, consisting of 63 tiles released in the original base game, 6 from Inns &amp; Cathedrals, 1 from Traders &amp; Builders and 2 from King &amp; Scout. It also includes a special replacement start tile which depicts the Wheel of Fortune, a new mechanic unique to this edition of the game. The new start tile is the size of 16 tiles, arranged in a 4&times;4 square and is built using some of the tiles removed from the base game.<br/><br/>Nineteen tiles from the game have numbers printed on them allowing players to randomly spin the Wheel of Fate (between 1 and 3 spaces around the wheel). Otherwise, a player may choose to place a follower on the wheel if they decline placing a follower that turn. The results of the Wheel vary depending on which of the sixths of the wheel the pig lands on. Results vary from forcing all players to remove a follower from the board to rewarding the player who moves the pig with three bonus points. There are six outcomes in all.<br/><br/>Play of this game does not require ownership of any Carcassonne base game. All expansions are compatible with this game. This game can also be played with the base game as an expansion, using its wagon wheel watermark to differentiate it from the base game.<br/><br/>Bridges, Castles and Bazaars is the eighth expansion for Carcassonne. It allows players three new options while playing:<br/><br/>Bridges may be used to continue a road over a field tile, thereby allowing an incomplete road to technically run into a field segment. They are otherwise treated and scored just like roads.<br/><br/>Castle tokens are placed atop 2-segment cities and allow players a chance to cash-in on the next completed adjacent feature.<br/><br/>Bazaars are a new type of tile that allows players to auction off tiles in exchange for points.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": {"242570": "Russian edition"}, "name": "\u041a\u0430\u0440\u043a\u0430\u0441\u0441\u043e\u043d: \u041a\u043e\u043b\u0435\u0441\u043e \u0444\u043e\u0440\u0442\u0443\u043d\u044b", "playingtime": "30", "boardgamemechanic": {"2002": "Tile Placement"}, "average": "7.20833", "usersrated": "6", "boardgamefamily": {"2": "Carcassonne"}}}
