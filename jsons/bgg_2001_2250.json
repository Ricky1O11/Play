Many of the mechanics are similar to that of one of TSR's other wargames (Red Storm Rising) so players of that game can rather easily go to this game.<br/><br/>Two versions of this game are played. With less than 5 players, the game is a &quot;Basic Game&quot; where military might is what wins the game. Players take sides, usually a combination of Middle Eastern nations plus the US. In the two player version, for instance, it is (quite predictably) the US &amp; Allies vs. Iraq; in the three-player game &quot;Holy War&quot;, it's Israel vs. Iraq (and Yemen and Jordan) vs. Saudi Arabia (and Syria, Libya, and Lebanon), and so on.<br/><br/>Combat rules are rather straightforward, and wargamers will be familiar with many of the mechanics. Land (w/ infantry, Iraqi National Guard, and tanks), sea, and air units are all utilized. Most units can take a few hits before removed from the board.<br/><br/>The Gameboard is big and beautiful. It has large areas denoting the nations of the Middle East, with some abstracted land to shore up the U.A.E. and some islands. It also has oil wells and airbases, as well as some other stuff.<br/><br/>The *real* game, though, is the six-player diplomatic game. The players are now clearly defined: The US (NATO), Iran, Israel, Iraq/Yemen, Moderate Arabs (Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Kuwait, etc.), and Volatile Arabs (Jordan, Libya, etc.) This adds a crucial element of diplomacy and politics, and makes the game much more interesting than the normal wargaming stuff. A &quot;War Fever&quot; and &quot;Jihad&quot; marker change as nations do things--for instance, the first time a US unit is attacked outside of Turkey, War Fever &quot;tripwires&quot; to 10. If Israel attacks a neighbor, Jihad increases by 2. War Fever and Jihad permit certain things to happen--for instance, if War Fever gets too low, the US is restricted in whom they may attack. If Jihad hits either 1 or 10, revolutions may occur--which can switch entire nations to another player!<br/><br/>Messages can be sent to other players via a diplomatic pouch--you cannot simply pull another player to the side and whisper in their ear. All messages, once read, go into a big pouch, and players can make diplomatic gestures to read some of the messages after they're read.<br/><br/>Victory occurs, in any case, when you meet objectives, which can vary from player to player. &quot;War Aim&quot; chits are drawn before the game begins, and so players are not quite certain as to exactly what other players are going for. For Instance, Iraq may win if they capture and hold Kuwait for the last three turns; if Jihad has reached 10 at least once and 10 non-Muslim units have been destroyed (by anyone); or by controlling three more oil fields than they started with. It all depends on what they looked for.<br/><br/>All in all, the Diplomatic game changes the basic game so much that political considerations are as important as military ones.<br/><br/>A simplified version of the game with the same name appeared in the TSR comic Warhawks #3.

Again, these squares have representations of playing cards on them and in order to score, you must lay the tile of the same denomination as the bonus square in order to score.<br/>When a five card poker hand has been formed on the board, it can no longer be extended, so a No Entry tile must be laid at either end of the hand to stop any further tiles from being added.<br/>If a hand is played so it covers a Joker tile, this tile is taken up and added to the players` hand.<br/>If a Joker is laid as part of a hand, it may be replaced with the correct tile which it represents on a later turn.<br/>When a player lays a hand down, he/she takes poker chips to the value of the hand.

The game is set in the Whamite Islands.  It is a very fun game, which usually lasts an hour or so depending on the number players and chance.<br/><br/>The idea of the game is to make as much gold as possible by controlling countries within your own little empire from the dozen or so provinces available.  The game uses a card system with a lot of clever design tricks added on to provide depth.<br/><br/>The game play within your turn is easy to pick up, but requires much thought to get right. You are dealt six cards initially, which will usually give you weak control of a couple of countries. These can be added to each turn by drawing two free cards or taking the top card from the discard pile. Additionally, you can buy extra cards every turn.  Having checked the cards for events and acted on those immediately, you can make 'melds,' war and political manoeuvres before compulsorily discarding one card.<br/><br/>The heart of the game is the 'meld.' A meld is simply the act of laying one or more cards from your hand in front of you, thus activating their powers. By having the most powerful political meld on the table (determined by the total number of flags on the melded cards), you control that country until toppled by better politics or combat. Each country normally has a couple of leaders, often with low numbers, and a varying number of higher-numbered followers who might be loyal to any leader card or just one.<br/><br/>Power can be stolen in two ways: political coups where you lay more flag cards than are currently melded (you take over those cards as well - those willing rally to your cause), or by the time-honoured invasion force.<br/><br/>Combat is simple enough, but can prove a little fiddly at times. Once battle is joined, a d6 is rolled to see how many rounds the battle will last. Rolling a one when there are two large armies will virtually guarantee a non-result, whereas a six will give both sides a good chance of a win. Swords kill simply on a roll of five or six, castles get to 'fight' in defence, and defending ships must be beaten first.<br/><br/>The game has an excellent basic structure.  The key to the game is the balance of military, political power, and wealth.  It really works well.  But, as always, there are improvements to be made and rules that can be changed to improve or change the flavor of the game.  But, the reason why the game works well is that there is an excellent structure underlying the few contested rules.<br/><br/>It's worth adding that a lot of the fun comes from the irreverent humour on the cards--just in case you thought you were playing a serious strategy game.  Names are satirical, silly, or obtuse references to real world people, places or events.  For example, there's a castle named &quot;Ratlarbig&quot; (look at it closely), a character called the &quot;Sorcerer's Apprentice&quot; and a group of soldiers called &quot;The Bloody Buggers&quot;.

Because of this feature, similar to Bughouse, the game can last longer than a Chess game, the board generally stays fairly crowded and there is no simplification going into the endgame.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": {"198706": "Aztral Games 'Western' Edition"}, "average": "7.27032", "name": "Shogi", "playingtime": "60", "boardgamemechanic": {"2676": "Grid Movement"}, "age": "8", "usersrated": "1144", "boardgamesubdomain": {"4666": "Abstract Games"}, "boardgamefamily": {"4024": "Chess Games"}}, "2066": {"boardgamedesigner": {"855": {"name": "Andreas Steiner"}}, "average": "5.42784", "poll": {}, "name": "Teufel, Teufel!", "playingtime": "60", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": {"2011": "Modular Board"}, "yearpublished": "1992", "usersrated": "37", "maxplayers": "6", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1328911_t.png", "boardgameartist": {"855": "Andreas Steiner"}, "statistics": {}, "boardgamepublisher": {"62": {"name": "Hexagames (I)"}}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1328911.png", "boardgameversion": {"109106": "Salagames Edition"}, "maxplaytime": "60", "boardgamecategory": {"1020": {"name": "Exploration"}}, "age": "10", "minplaytime": "60", "description": "Cards with letters in six colors, devils and towers are laid out upside down on the board.

Roberts Best Pre-Twentieth Century Game Winner"}, "description": "This sprawling rendition of the American Civil War tries to fit in everything, from Grant and Lee down to Indian raids in the Western territories. It also includes the most extensive treatment of naval and riverine warfare of any strategic Civil War game. The map covers the theater of the war from the Eastern seaboard to the middle of Texas at 25 miles per hex. An optional second map extends to New Mexico. There are five turns per year, four of two months each and a four-month Winter turn. Each turn consists of an indefinite number of &quot;pulses&quot; and may last a long, long time. Troops are represented by generic Strength Points (about 5,000 men per SP, or one or two ironclads with escorting naval vessels).<br/><br/>The key concepts in the game are Theaters, Command Points, Pulses and Leaders.<br/><br/><br/>     There are three Theaters: East, West and Trans-Mississippi. Players must prioritize them each turn as primary, secondary and tertiary. These designations are made a turn in advance, requiring a modest degree of foresight. Higher priority Theaters receive larger allocations of Command Points and thus will see more activity.<br/><br/><br/><br/>     Command Points are needed to perform most of the game's functions, such as moving SP's, consolidating SP's into Armies, constructing fortifications, adding naval SP's, sacking unwanted generals, etc. Players obtain them by dice rolls at the start of each turn. In addition to CP's assigned to individual theaters, they receive an allotment of &quot;discretionary&quot; CP's that can be used in any Theater. The Union also gets Naval CP's. Additional CP's may be generated during a turn, as noted below.<br/><br/><br/><br/>     Each turn is divided into an indefinite number of Pulses. To begin a Pulse, each player rolls two dice. The difference between the results is the number of actions each must take in that Pulse (high roller first). Actions may be used to expend Command Points, to muster SP reinforcements or to bring inew or newly promoted Leaders into play. If the dice rolls are equal, either the turn ends immediately or each player receives additional Command Points. The likelihood of an immediate end rises with the number of tied rolls and is a certainty on the fourth tie. If the turn doesn't end in this fashion, it continues until all Command Points have been used and available reinforcements and Leaders entered.<br/><br/><br/><br/>     While Strength Points are abstract, the game includes more than 60 historical Leaders, who enter play at about the time that they rose to prominence in real life. Each Leader has a rank (one to four stars) and ratings for Initiative, Tactical Combat and Army Command. Many begin at lower ranks and can be promoted. Sherman, for instance, has a single star when he appears but can rise to four. Like Presidents Lincoln and Davis in real life, players don't have absolute control over promotions, nor does every Leader perform better at a higher rank. A Leader's rank determines the number of SP's he can command - up to two for a one star, up to six for higher ranks. Assigning as many SP's as permitted to a Leader (preferably a capable one) is economical, since he can move his entire force by expending Command Points equal to his Initiative. (Lower Initiative numbers are better in this game.) Without Leaders, SP's cost one CP each to move, rendering them all but static. Better yet are Armies, which can be as large as 25 SP's and must be commanded by a three or four star Leader. (Each Army has its own maximum size, based on its historical counterpart.)<br/><br/><br/>The game has much more: an elaborate combat resolution procedure, somewhat less elaborate supply rules, a naval system that is a game in itself, cavalry, railroads, militia, neutral states and a chrome-laden option to add the Far West map and Theater.<br/><br/>Players gain Victory Points primarily by capturing major enemy and neutral cities and winning neutral states to their side. The South also gets VP's for successful commerce raiding and for isolating or capturing Washington, D.C. It wins at once if it captures Washington at a moment when it has more VP's than the North. Otherwise, VP's are checked in November 1864 and April 1865, when the game comes to a definitive end.<br/><br/>For those who lack time or patience for the full war, scenarios are provided with the historical setups as of the start of 1862, 1863 and 1864.<br/><br/>The Civil War isn't the biggest game ever produced on that dreadful conflict, but it is certainly among the most ambitious in its scope and degree of detail.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": {"26155": "Victory Games edition"}, "name": "The Civil War", "playingtime": "1200", "boardgamemechanic": {"2072": "Dice Rolling"}, "age": "12", "usersrated": "966", "boardgamesubdomain": {"4664": "Wargames"}, "average": "7.6678"}, "2082": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic14374.jpg", "poll": {}, "boardgamedesigner": {"680": {"name": "Joseph Reiser"}}, "statistics": {}, "yearpublished": "1990", "maxplayers": "4", "boardgameartist": {"15063": "Ted Koller"}, "boardgamepublisher": {"123": {"name": "Victory Games (I)"}}, "maxplaytime": "240", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic14374_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "240", "boardgamecategory": {"1019": {"name": "Wargame"}}, "description": "Shell Shock! is a two-player game of combat, adventure and heroism in World War II Europe; adapted from the award-winning and incredibly popular Ambush! solitaire game.

The mine was so prosperous, in fact, that the troll had accumulated enough wealth to retire after years of hard work.<br/>Once a year, the elves who live in the forests near the mine celebrate their Great Wood Fair. One of the highlights of each Fair is the mining competition. The troll, who enjoys the Fair just as much as the elves, gladly opens up the mine to let the elves dig for gold. Only the fastest and luckiest elf is allowed to keep his gold though, so while the competition is friendly, it is also very challenging. No one seems to care that the elves try to hinder each other by hiding stones where they think their fellow competitors will dig. In the end, it is the most clever elf who will win and stake a claim to his gold.<br/><br/>This is an simple bluffing game from the White Wind stable. Players spend money to buy shovels &amp; pickaxes to dig for gold. They then enter the mine, and start to dig. But wait!! players also get to place broken shovel and decoy counters on the board as well. A broken shovel means no gold, and you lose the implement you were digging with.

It is a popular gambling game, but wagering real stakes is by no means necessary to have fun playing.<br/><br/>The tiles consist of three suits numbering 1-9 (Dots, Numbers or Characters, and Bamboo, the &quot;Ace&quot; of which almost always looks like a bird), three different dragons (Red, Green, and White [white is unusual in that it may look like a silvery dragon, or like a picture frame, or blank - think &quot;White dragon in a snowstorm&quot;), and the four winds (east, south, west, and north).  There are four copies of each tile.  This totals to 136 tiles. In addition, special Flower, Season, and Joker (American version) tiles may also be used.<br/><br/>Four players take turns drawing from a stock (the wall), or from the other players' discards, in an attempt to form sets of numeric sequences (e.g., 5-6-7 of the same suit, which can only be drawn from the player at one's left, by calling &quot;Chow&quot;), triplets and quadruplets (which can be drawn from the discards out-of-turn by calling &quot;Pung&quot;), pairs, and other patterns. &quot;Pung&quot; takes precedence over &quot;Chow&quot;, and &quot;Mah Jongg&quot; takes precedence over all (and is the only situation one may draw &quot;Chow&quot; out-of-turn.)

The game includes 20 cases based on famous crimes and criminals of the 20th Century, including the Zodiac Killer, Sacco and Vanzetti, the Lindbergh Kidnapping, and &quot;The Black Dahlia&quot;. Each case is represented by a card that features a crime told in story form, a selection of probable suspects and a list of locations involved in that crime.<br/><br/>The board represents the various cities the crimes occurred in, with eighteen generic locations to find clues (Pharmacy, Hotel, Airport, Supermarket, Tavern, Harbor, FBI, etc.). Players must collect clues from different locations, noting them down on their checklists as they attempt to find the answers to the questions listed on the case card.

Players direct the fate of interstellar empires through expansion or consolidation by means of conquests, raids, governing, building planetary defenses, commerce, and diplomacy.<br/><br/>The game was derived from two existing popular SPI titles. While adding many subtle changes in its own right, it combines the highly successful system used in Empires of the Middle Ages with the graphic layout used for Freedom in the Galaxy. Technology and economics are abstracted, but both play a large role in just about every aspect of the game. Stargates allow players to conduct interstellar operations against any star system, free of range constraints.

Well, in 1981, the year after Empires of the Middle Ages was released, SPI produced another game using the same system and the missing science fiction premise, and The Sword and the Stars was born.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "1", "boardgameversion": {"27716": "SPI First edition"}, "average": "6.2625", "name": "The Sword and the Stars", "playingtime": "240", "boardgamemechanic": {"2001": "Action Point Allowance System"}, "age": "12", "usersrated": "112", "boardgamesubdomain": {"5497": "Strategy Games"}, "boardgamefamily": {"22783": "Admin: Better Description Needed!"}}, "2122": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic178705.jpg", "is_expanded_by": {"201181": {"name": "Vampire: The Eternal Struggle - Ancient Hearts"}}, "poll": {}, "boardgamedesigner": {"14": {"name": "Richard Garfield"}}, "statistics": {}, "boardgamecompilation": {"201192": "Vampire: The Eternal Struggle 10th Anniversary"}, "yearpublished": "1994", "maxplayers": "5", "boardgameartist": {"14753": "Rob Alexander"}, "boardgamepublisher": {"464": {"name": "White Wolf Publishing (White Wolf)"}}, "boardgameintegration": {"201201": "Vampire: The Eternal Struggle Third Edition"}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic178705_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "120", "boardgamecategory": {"1002": {"name": "Card Game"}}, "description": "Vampire: the Eternal Struggle (or VTES for short) is a multi-player collectable card game based on the award-winning Vampire: the Masquerade role playing game in which players take on the role of ancient vampires known as a Methuselahs. Considered mere legend by many, Methuselahs rule everything from the shadows, engaging in a eons-long Machiavellian conflict that encompasses political, social, and even physical warfare. The struggle is won or lost based on the actions taken by your minions &ndash; younger vampires who unknowingly do your bidding. In this way, the game can allow for deep and immersive storytelling as your minions purchase equipment, hire retainers, even suggest legislative changes to vampiric society, all in the service of your dark plots.<br/><br/>VTES was the second card game designed by Richard Garfield (designer of Magic the Gathering, Netrunner, and other games). It was designed to avoid some of the flaws that Garfield found in Magic: VTES does not require you to include resource or mana cards in your deck, and cards are instantly replaced when played, meaning that card draw isn&rsquo;t as important as knowing when to discard a card to sculpt a better hand. It also has a gameplay experience more in keeping with a boardgame than a traditional card game &ndash; VTES is usually played by 4 or 5 players and games can last up to 2 hours.<br/><br/>Unlike most multi-player games, players in VTES do not engage in a free-for-all. Each player directs their attacks to the player on their left (their &ldquo;prey&rdquo;) and defends against the player on their right (their &ldquo;predator&rdquo;). You gain victory points by eliminating or &ldquo;ousting&rdquo; your prey from the game, in which case the next player to the left becomes your new prey. The player with the most victory points at the end of the game wins (even if they have been ousted!). This arrangement makes the game a very social one &ndash; you and the player two seats to the left and right have common enemies. But if you help these allies too much, you may find that you&rsquo;ve made one of them too strong, and when they suddenly become your new predator, your help has transformed that ally into a deadly threat.<br/><br/>VTES is also a resource management game. Each player begins with 30 points of influence called &ldquo;pool&rdquo; that Methuselahs hold dearer than unlife itself. If you run out of pool, you are ousted from the game. But this pool is also the way that you sway vampires to your cause. Each turn you have the opportunity to spend your pool to seduce a vampire. Weak fledgling vampire are easily swayed, but the older more powerful ones require convincing, which may require multiple turns to accomplish. Once a vampire is converted to your side, all the pool you spent on them becomes blood possessed by this vampire, which can be spent to play cards that allow them to activate their unique vampiric powers. Each minion must manage their blood and you must manage your pool &ndash; spending more provides you with additional minions, but brings you one step closer to being ousted. Under- or over- investing in your minions may well cost you the game.<br/><br/>Although the last official card set was released in 2010 by White Wolf, VTES is still played and enjoyed by players around the world. Tournaments still draw large groups of attendees, and some continental championships see more than 100 players attend. The game is currently supported by Vampire: Elder Kindred Network&trade;, the official player organization responsible for sanctioning and regulating VTES tournaments, recording V:TES players&rsquo; ratings (and rankings), as well as designing and releasing new digital expansions featuring profession artwork.

It is not for a specific product or release. Versions will appear on the individual item pages.<br/><br/>    <br/><br/><br/>This is a very simple CCG based on the movie Star Wars: Episode I.<br/><br/>First, after shuffling, you see who goes first (usually drawing &quot;destiny&quot;) and then draw 6 cards from your reserve deck.  The player who goes first usually chose the planet to battle at first.  And, from these 6 cards, you then deploy up to 6 &quot;counters&quot; worth of cards from your hand.  These can be Locations (if you are on the same planet), weapons and characters.  There were also &quot;effect&quot; cards that could be deployed to the table to boost up your characters, power, equipment and # of counters per turn.<br/><br/>Phase two is battling for the planet you are currently on.  You lay any battle cards in your hand down and pick up your deployed character and weapon cards.  These are arranged in the order of &quot;battle card, weapon card, character card.&quot;  With the cards in order from last (first character you want to battle with) to first (last character to be battled), you place them face down in a stack and you both turn over cards until you get to a character (in the case of weapons and battle cards).  Cards turned over before the character are attached to the character (weapons and such) if the character can use them.  If the character can not use them, then they are discarded.  If you have weapons, you total up the number of &quot;power dots&quot; (red dots) and draw destiny.  That is the top card of your reserve deck.  You then look at the small number on the &quot;die&quot; in the upper right hand corner of the card.  You add this power to the character.  Whichever character has more power wins and the loser discards his character and attached cards.  Damage is listed on the card that lost.  The loser then discards that many cards off the top of his or her deck.  Both players then turn over their cards in the fight deck for the next characters to fight, etc. If the attacker ends up with more characters then the defender then the defender discards 1 card for each.  The cards that survived the battle remain at the planet for the next round.<br/><br/>The final phase is called even up.  Pick up your original hand and you may discard it before drawing back up to 6 cards then go back to phase one again.  If you have more than 6 cards in your hand, you have to discard down to 6.  If you have less than, and you wish to keep them, you then draw to equal 6.  If you are not satisfied with your hand, you can discard the whole thing and draw 6 fresh cards.<br/><br/>If after a battle you are the only one with characters left on a planet you have won it and you move to the next planet which is chosen by the winner of the planet.  You can also &quot;surrender&quot; the planet.<br/><br/>You win by controlling 2 of the 3 planets or by running your opponent out of cards.<br/><br/>There are a lot of other little things involved but that is basically how the game goes.

There is a limit to what can be put under the shields so you can not make your army too big.<br/><br/>When two armies met they battle.  Combat is fairly detailed.  Both players pick up their cards from under the shields to make a combat hand.  Each player secretly chooses one creature and they are placed down on the table.  The stronger then covers the weaker.  This is repeated for each creature until only one player has creatures left in his hand.  He can then assign these creatures to help any of the previous creatures placed.  There are many modifiers involved and each stack of creatures must be checked for a winner.  All losers are discarded.  After determining each battle the total strength of each army is checked.  The weaker army must then retreat or the attacker in case of a tie.<br/><br/>To win you must either control all six of the lands between the strongholds, destroy 5 of the opponents shields or destroy the opposing Guardian.<br/><br/>The game is fairly complicated but very straight forward.<br/><br/>Special mention must be made of the artwork.  There is no better looking game on the market.  The illustrations are large and very well drawn.  Humor abounds.<br/><br/>After the first release, a revised edition was published ('Guardians Revised Edition').

Gaia is dying. The Apocalypse is here.<br/><br/>Will you fall defending her or die a cowards death? Will your pack live in legend as the ones who saved the world, or those who betrayed it?<br/><br/>Is today a good day to die?<br/><br/>Take control of a pack of Garou, savage werewolves, as they battle the forces of the Wyrm in defense of Mother Earth, Gaia.<br/><br/>Call upon ancient spirit pacts, mystical abilities, and the tools of the modern world to destroy the forces of corruption that threaton to plunge the world into eternal darkness and decay.<br/><br/>But not every Garou agrees how best to save Gaia. Is it best done through force? Through renewing the traditions and spirit pacts of old? Through mystical means? Or should the Garou just adapt to the new age and help Gaia change to fit into the new world?<br/><br/>Or sell out and play a pack of Wyrm creatures hell bent on seeing that the Wyrm is the final victor in the coming Apocalypse.<br/><br/>But not even the forces of the Wyrm can agree on their methods. Should they concentrate on corrupting humans and Garou to do the Wyrm's bidding? Should they fight the Garou claw to claw? Or should they win the war by destroying every last thing the Garou love and cherish?<br/><br/>Gameplay<br/>Each player has two decks. One deck is his &quot;Sept&quot; hand.  This is composed of allies, equipment, fetishes, events, victims, gifts, quests, and several other card types depending on which expansions you are using.  The other deck is a combat deck showing special maneuvers which are used when two characters are engaged in combat.<br/><br/>Play begins with each player laying out his pack (collection of Character cards).  These are all the characters the player will have for that game.  The game ends when one pack achieves the same number of Renown as they had starting Renown.  Typically, players start with a 20 Renown pack (each character has a Renown) and thus the game ends when someone has 20 renown in their victory pile.<br/><br/>Play is simultaneous, with all players taking actions at the same time - conflicts are generally resolved based on the renown of the character taking an action; well known characters go first.  The game is split into several phases:<br/>Redraw - draw your Sept hand back to 5 cards<br/>Regeneration - heal characters that have been hurt<br/>Resource - play most cards like gifts, equipment etc.<br/>Umbra - play special umbra cards and actions<br/>Moot - play special cards which may change rules. These must be voted on by all players.<br/>Combat - resolve any fights.<br/><br/>Each round a player designates one of his characters as Alpha.  The Alpha becomes the primary actor for that round.  During the combat round, Alphas may:<br/>1) Attack another Alpha<br/>2) Attack a victim<br/>3) Attack an enemy<br/>4) Challenge an ally or a non-Alpha character<br/>5) Attack a territory<br/>6) Do nothing.<br/><br/>Combat is resolved using a separate deck which allows special maneuvers.<br/><br/>Renown (victory points) are earned by defeating rival characters and enemies. Some packs may reverse the rules and gain victory by defeating victims.  Renown can also be earned from moots and quests.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": {"114615": "First Edition"}, "average": "5.99721", "name": "Rage", "playingtime": "45", "age": "12", "usersrated": "517", "boardgamesubdomain": {"4667": "Customizable Games"}, "boardgamefamily": {"7381": "Animals: Wolves"}}, "2134": {"boardgamedesigner": {"644": {"name": "Luke Peterschmidt"}}, "poll": {}, "name": "Rage (second edition)", "playingtime": "45", "minplayers": "2", "usersrated": "62", "yearpublished": "1998", "boardgameimplementation": {"2133": "Rage"}, "boardgamefamily": {"6040": "CCGs (Collectible Card Games)"}, "maxplayers": "5", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic7734_t.jpg", "average": "5.82597", "statistics": {}, "boardgamesubdomain": {"4667": "Customizable Games"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic7734.jpg", "maxplaytime": "45", "boardgamepublisher": {"465": {"name": "Five Rings Publishing Group"}}, "boardgamecategory": {"1002": {"name": "Card Game"}}, "age": "12", "minplaytime": "45", "description": "In 1998 Rage underwent a major revision that cleaned up a lot of problems with the previous version by White Wolf Studios.

The Egyptian onslaught was spearheaded by seven divisions and over a thousand tanks - with another three divisions and 300 tanks in reserve around Cairo.  Despite these long odds, the Israelis believed they would be able to repel the assault with relative ease.<br/><br/>Within 72 hours, the assumptions that formed the foundation of the Israeli strategy - the defensive value of the Suez Canal, the absolute superiority of Israeli troops, and the decisive role of the Israeli Air Force - were proven to be shockingly, undeniably mistaken.  First of all, the Egyptians, displaying an unexpected mastery of engineering technique, built no fewer than ten bridges over the Canal by the end of October 7 - an achievement which enabled them to pour tanks and other heavy equipment across much faster than the Israelis had thought possible.  More shocking yet, every Israeli counterthrust had been thrown back, with appalling losses.  Those supposedly inferior Egyptian troops did not falter in the face of the immediate and violent Israeli counterattacks, but bravely stood their ground - knocking out better than 300 Israeli tanks in the first three days of the war.  Finally, when the Israeli Air Force was sent to the rescue of the hard-pressed ground forces, it ran into an almost impenetrable wall of antiaircraft guns and SAMs (including the hitherto unknown - and very deadly - Soviet SA-6s) that took a dreadful toll of the attacking Phantoms and Skyhawks.<br/><br/>History tells us that the Israelis managed to overcome the initial consequences of their own hubris and overconfidence, and reverse the course of the war, through a combination of sheer guts, brilliant improvisation, and superior technique in mobile warfare.  Yet, the outcome of the war along the Suez Canal was, to quote Wellington, &quot;A very near run thing,&quot; that might easily have ended in a humiliating Israeli defeat.<br/><br/>TIME SCALE    12 hours per turn<br/>MAP SCALE    2.5 miles per hex<br/>UNIT SCALE    Battalion / Brigade<br/>NUMBER OF PLAYERS    One to four<br/>PLAYING TIME    Two to twelve hours<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": {"39110": "GMT first edition"}, "average": "6.50225", "name": "Crisis: Sinai 1973", "playingtime": "360", "boardgamemechanic": {"2026": "Hex-and-Counter"}, "age": "12", "usersrated": "89", "boardgamesubdomain": {"4664": "Wargames"}, "boardgamefamily": {"3265": "Crisis Series"}}, "2139": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic224217.jpg", "poll": {}, "boardgamedesigner": {"9950": {"name": "Ron Kent"}}, "statistics": {}, "yearpublished": "1996", "maxplayers": "2", "age": "10", "boardgamepublisher": {"468": {"name": "The United States Playing Card Company"}}, "maxplaytime": "60", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic224217_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "60", "boardgamecategory": {"1002": {"name": "Card Game"}}, "description": "Based on the show of the same name this is clue on speed.

Although usually played by two players, theoretically any number of players can participate at once.<br/><br/>Players can choose one of a number of factions from within the Warhammer 40,000 universe - examples include, humanity's defenders, the Space Marines and Imperial Guard, the nearly extinct race of Elder, the all-consuming Tyranids or the corrupted once-human forces of Chaos. Each race also how their own sub-groups and flavours - for example there are Chapters of Space Marines with their own specialisations, whilst a Chaos army that worships the war-god Khorne would look very different to one worshiping the pleasure god Slaanesh.<br/><br/>Players select their armies based on the miniatures they own. To ensure balance each miniature is assigned a points value (with the value rising for optional upgrades) and players usually agree a points limit for each army before play. Similarly, players will agree the rules and victory conditions for a specific scenario.<br/><br/>Each turn proceeds in phases covering movement, melee combat, ranged combat and so forth. No game board is used, players make or purchase their own scenery. Physical measurement is used to determine movement and weapon range, with dice used to calculate everything from damage to morale and the effectiveness of physic powers. Special 'scatter dice' are used to calculate random or quasi-random events such as the movement of a gas cloud or fire.<br/><br/>Games usually last for a specified number of turns, after which the player who has accumulated the most victory points (by achieving pre-set goals and destroying enemy miniatures) is the winner.<br/><br/>Expansions and new armies are regularly released for Warhammer 40,000, with new editions of the game itself being released roughly every four years.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": {"27633": "Games Workshop English second edition"}, "average": "6.40745", "name": "Warhammer 40,000", "playingtime": "120", "boardgamemechanic": {"2072": "Dice Rolling"}, "age": "17", "boardgameexpansion": {}, "usersrated": "2008", "boardgamesubdomain": {"4664": "Wargames"}, "boardgamefamily": {"4341": "Warhammer 40,000 Wargames"}}, "2163": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1411446.jpg", "boardgameimplementation": {"165838": "Space Hulk (fourth edition)"}, "is_expanded_by": {"15401": {"name": "Space Hulk Campaigns"}}, "poll": {}, "boardgamedesigner": {"153": {"name": "Richard Halliwell"}}, "statistics": {}, "yearpublished": "1989", "maxplayers": "4", "boardgameartist": {"31506": "Tony Cottrell"}, "boardgamepublisher": {"1869": {"name": "Dise\u00f1os Orbitales"}}, "maxplaytime": "45", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1411446_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "45", "boardgamecategory": {"1046": {"name": "Fighting"}}, "description": "Space Hulk is a light miniatures wargame set in the Warhammer 40K universe.  It has a relatively simple rule-set (compared to Warhammer 40K itself) and is known for its fast play and immersive theme (think the movie Aliens).<br/><br/>You lay out corridors and rooms that represent a space hulk, a large disabled ship floating in space. The Space Marines wear powerful space battle suits and carry heavy weaponry. The Genestealers (reminiscent of the alien in Alien) are naked, except for their quick movement, multiple clawed arms capable of ripping through Terminator armor and their seemingly endless numbers.<br/><br/>Each game is played as a scenario.  The Space Marines win by completing a certain goal, such as retrieving an artifact and escaping alive.  The GeneStealers win by stopping the Space Marines from achieving their goal, usually by killing them all. A unique mechanism is that the Genestealers have no time limit for their turn, but the Space Marines have a 3 minute time limit, and less if a sergeant is killed. This simulates the fact that Genestealers move so much quicker and adds a lot of tension to the game for the Marine player.<br/><br/>The miniatures are excellent although you do have to paint them yourselves and the modular board is very well done.<br/><br/>The Deathwing Expansion adds new personnel, weapons, rules for multilevel hulks, new missions and a mission generator along with some complexity.<br/><br/>The Genestealer Expansion adds new marines, weapons, Genestealer Hybrids who can use weapons and new missions.

In fact, Pok&eacute;mon was one of the first Collectible Card Games to offer any competition to the market dominance of Magic:  The Gathering, even though most of the people who buy the product do not play the game, choosing instead to collect their favorite characters from the franchise the game is based upon.[citation needed]<br/><br/>The object of the game is to play your Pok&eacute;mon cards, that represent different creatures, to battle against each other.  The first player to &quot;knock out&quot; (defeat) six opposing Pok&eacute;mon wins the game.  You play the game with a deck of sixty cards that represent your Pok&eacute;mon, as well as Trainer cards and Energy cards.  Trainer cards affect the game, players or Pok&eacute;mon in different ways, most of them temporary, while Energy cards act as the resources in the game.<br/><br/>You start the game by drawing seven cards.  Each player picks a Basic Pok&eacute;mon from their hand and places it in front of them to start.  This is called the Active Pok&eacute;mon and is the one currently dueling.  Players can also place other Basic Pok&eacute;mon to fill up the five slots on their &quot;Bench&quot;.  Six cards are then set aside to act as Prizes.  Each time you defeat one of your opponent's Pok&eacute;mon, you get to draw one of these Prize cards.  Players take alternating turns during which they can:<br/><br/>     put Pok&eacute;mon in play on their Bench<br/>     place an Energy card on one of their Pok&eacute;mon (once per turn)<br/>     play Trainer cards<br/>     evolve one of their Pok&eacute;mon<br/>     retreat - Have their Active Pok&eacute;mon trade places with one on the Bench (usually at the cost of Energy cards)<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>In addition to Basic Pok&eacute;mon cards, there are also Evolution cards, which depict evolved forms of Basic Pok&eacute;mon (or sometimes other Evolved Pok&eacute;mon). A player can evolve a Pok&eacute;mon by laying a corresponding Evolution card onto another Pok&eacute;mon card in play.  This can only be done once per turn per Pok&eacute;mon, and only if the Pok&eacute;mon has been in play at least one entire turn.  The Evolved Pok&eacute;mon retains any damage and Energy cards, but loses any Special Conditions affecting it, and the card text completely replaces the previous card.<br/><br/>The last action a player takes during their turn, if they choose, is to have their Active Pok&eacute;mon use one of its abilities to attack the other player's Active Pok&eacute;mon.  Attacks can only be used if the Pok&eacute;mon has enough Energy cards of the right type attached to it to meet the requirements for the attack; each attack has different requirements and effects that are listed on the card.  Most attacks will do some amount of damage to the Defending Pok&eacute;mon; if defeated, the Defending Pok&eacute;mon is replaced with another Pok&eacute;mon from the Bench, and the attacker draws a Prize card.  If either the attacker draws their last Prize card or the Defender cannot replace the Active Pok&eacute;mon (due to an empty Bench), the attacker has won the game.<br/><br/>There are many different varieties of Pok&eacute;mon available and several different forms of each one, each with different attacks, abilities and characteristics, allowing for many different possible outcomes.

To accomplish this, you will use your Dragons to attack cards in the enemy's Battlefield. However, your Dragons will not fight for you free of charge. Dragons love gold, so in Wyvern you must pay your Dragons to fight.

One deck holds your dragons and terrain cards.  The other deck has your treasure cards and action cards.<br/><br/>To set up the game you take the top six cards from your dragon deck and lay them face down in two rows of three cards.  Your front three dragons can fight the opponents front three dragons so you do have to be careful how you place.  Flying dragons can fight over one row.

In name and power, the pieces are standard chessmen, but they are shaped like Stratego pieces so that each player can only identify the pieces of his own army. At the start both sides arrange their armies any way they like on the first two ranks. Pawns are allowed to move two squares forward on either the first or second rank. The object is to capture the enemy King. The identity of a piece is revealed when it is captured. The official rules then call for the piece to be returned to its previous owner (off the board), facing away from its captor.<br/><br/>Stealth Chess has the same pieces as conventional chess(16 Black &amp; 16 White) but unlike traditional chess, all pieces look the same and have the pieces title printed on the back side so your only chance to win is to memorize the movement of your opponents and which piece was moved. This memory play helps with regular chess play by improving your memory.<br/><br/>The game begins with pieces being randomly placed by each player in the first and second row of each side of the board. You decide the strategic possibilities of the placement of your pieces. For example, you might put your Queen front-row center and hide your King in a corner. The excitement begins with the first move. From that point forward, you must try to figure out your opponent's pieces by their movements and seek out and capture the King. Of course, you may &quot;disguise&quot; a powerful piece by moving it as if it were a mere Pawn--until you strike without warning. No check, no checkmate. Boom! Victory is yours.<br/><br/>There are several different rule sets included that the players agree upon beforehand. The simplest is a standard opening position setup.

Four-player versions of chess probably have existed for hundreds of years prior to Verney in one form or another.  Verney's four-player board consists of three rows added to each side of a standard 2-player board, and four complete sets of chessmen in four different colors.  Modern four-player boards and colored pieces are available from several manufacturers.<br/><br/>In Verney's version (1881), 4 player chess was a partnership game, and the object was to checkmate both opposing partners at the same time.  In modern variants, four player games can range from partners, to cutthroat (every player for himself), to temporary alliances at will.<br/><br/>Starting configuration affects fairness (bias).  The standard 2-player configuration of queen facing queen is biased in four player chess because there is only one axis of symmetry.  Four player chess requires two axes of symmetry to be fair (unbiased).  To avoid bias, Verney recommended a staring configuration of all queens on light (or all on dark) squares.  Another unbiased starting configuration is all queens on the right (or all on the left) of the king.<br/><br/>For the most part, four player chess follows (or can follow) all the normal rules of two-player chess.  Verney had special rules for partnership playing, disallowed castling, and pawns had to make it to the enemies last rank in order to be exchanged for another piece.

The first part of the game is the auction, by which partners attempt to communicate information about their hands by bidding, in order to arrive at a successful contract. The contract specifies how many tricks must be taken by the team that wins the bid. After the auction, a member of the team that won the bid tries to win as many tricks as possible while playing both hands from the partnership. One hand is played normally while the other (the &quot;dummy hand&quot;) is placed face-up on the table, allowing for greater control. The defenders attempt to take enough tricks to make the contract fail.<br/><br/>The formal name of the game is Contract Bridge, but the shortened name &quot;Bridge&quot; is the most common usage. Bridge developed from the 17th Century card game Whist. The earliest form of Bridge originated in 1886 when rules were introduced allowing the dealer to choose a trump and his or her partner's hand to become dummy. Bridge became Auction Bridge in 1904, which allowed the trump suit to be decided by the highest bidding partnership. Harold Vanderbilt transformed Auction Bridge into Contract Bridge in 1925,when he introduced an improved method of scoring.<br/><br/>The duplicate version of the game has many pairs of partners, each playing the same hands separately and comparing their results. This method removes the element of luck in getting good cards when comparing players and thus helps to isolate the role of skill in the game.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "4", "boardgameversion": {"99339": "Ariel English edition"}, "average": "7.47059", "name": "Bridge", "playingtime": "60", "boardgamemechanic": {"2012": "Auction/Bidding"}, "age": "12", "boardgameexpansion": {}, "usersrated": "2603", "boardgamesubdomain": {"4666": "Abstract Games"}, "boardgamefamily": {"10438": "Bridge"}}, "2182": {"boardgamedesigner": {"906": {"name": "Joe Nikisch"}}, "poll": {}, "name": "Knallbonbon", "playingtime": "10", "minplayers": "4", "boardgamemechanic": {"2661": "Press Your Luck"}, "yearpublished": "1991", "usersrated": "2", "maxplayers": "6", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1289090_t.jpg", "average": "3.5", "statistics": {}, "boardgamepublisher": {"62": {"name": "Hexagames (I)"}}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1289090.jpg", "boardgameversion": {"109083": "Hexagames Edition"}, "maxplaytime": "10", "boardgamecategory": {"1023": {"name": "Bluffing"}}, "age": "10", "minplaytime": "10", "description": "From the box<br/>You never really know what is really in a party cracker.

Each player takes turns being the &quot;Current Player&quot;: the crew of the Enterprise, while the opposing player represents the obstacles to the crew as the &quot;Challenging Player&quot;.<br/><br/>The game revolves around completing episodes as the Current Player. Each episode is made up of three cards, Mission, Plot and Discovery. You have all three cards in a generic form that you can play if you did not draw one of the types.<br/><br/>You play a mission card then the opponent plays challenges against it. You then play a plot card and more challenges. Then a discovery card and yep, more challenges (well&hellip; really you just resolve any outstanding challenges). At the end each side gets points called XC for how they did or did not do during the Episode phase.  The Current player gets XC for completing the episode while the Challenger gets XC for stifling the Current Player's efforts.<br/><br/>XC is put on the core crew and crew you enter on your side and the first player to end their turn with 25+ XC total on the crew wins. This means that XC on the core crew will count for each side when it is their turn.<br/><br/>The shots from the series used on the cards will make Star Trek fans very happy.

Recently, it has also come out with two expansions which were released in tins: Faith of our Fathers (FooF) and Rock of Ages (RoA).<br/><br/>At its core, the gameplay is simple: use your Heroes to rescue Lost Souls from your opponent's Land of Bondage, and use your Evil Characters to defend your own Lost Souls from your opponent.  Enhancements may be played on these characters in turn to affect the final outcome of the battle.  The characters and enhancements are divided up into colored &quot;brigades&quot; to emphasize theme and maintain variety and balance.  The depth of gameplay is expanded with various support cards, such as Sites, Fortresses and Artifacts.  Dominant cards may also be played by anybody at any time, and can turn the game around in an instant.<br/><br/>Redemption is unique among its CCG counterparts in several ways.  The cards are based on characters, locations and events from the Bible.  So while no particular tradition or &quot;brand&quot; of Christianity is emphasized over another, this source material provides a solid theme for the game.  Accordingly, many of the cards and their effects bear a historical or thematic parallel to their corresponding Scripture, making Redemption an effective learning tool as well.<br/><br/>Also, while variety and depth of strategy are key factors in developing new expansions, the chance elements of the card draw and Dominant card play are never fully mitigated, allowing younger or less skilled players something of an equalizer.  This is consistent with designer Rob Anderson's philosophy that the emphasis be placed on fun and fellowship over pure competition.  It is also for this reason that, while tournaments are held regularly, with prizes and ranking points awarded to players who place, those prizes are rather modest compared to those offered by Magic: The Gathering or Pok\u00e9mon Trading Card Game.<br/><br/>"}, "2202": {"boardgamedesigner": {"3": {"name": "(Uncredited)"}}, "poll": {}, "name": "Swahili", "playingtime": "30", "minplayers": "2", "yearpublished": "1968", "usersrated": "21", "boardgamefamily": {"5607": "3D Games"}, "maxplayers": "4", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic481070_t.jpg", "average": "5.94762", "statistics": {}, "boardgamesubdomain": {"4666": "Abstract Games"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic481070.jpg", "boardgameversion": {"335342": "English 'Thick Corners' edition"}, "maxplaytime": "30", "boardgamepublisher": {"20": {"name": "Milton Bradley"}}, "boardgamecategory": {"1009": {"name": "Abstract Strategy"}}, "age": "8", "minplaytime": "30", "description": "This is a pretty straight forward adaption of Mancala.

You do this by renting spaces and selling your Big Deal cards.  Once a player has sold all of his Big Deal cards, it's Closing Time --any Big Deal cards leftover in other players' hands are deducted from their score.<br/><br/>Big Deal cards are displayed for all to see during play, with the Fair Price hidden on the back.  There are duplicates of each item, with sometimes wildly different fair prices.  Sets of four Big Deal cards of the same colour can be cashed in when passing the Wholesaler (Start Space).  You bargain for Big Deal cards when you land on a seller's space.  Only two offers and two counter-offers are allowed, to limit bargaining time.  The agreed-upon price is multiplied by the number of cards of that colour the buyer already holds (but never more than four times).<br/><br/>If you think the seller was asking for more than the Fair Price, you may call a Challenge.  You are secretly shown the Fair Price to resolve the challenge.  If you were right, you get the card; otherwise, you must pay the Fair Price multiplied by *twice* the number of cards of that colour you already hold.<br/><br/>Of course, role-playing (haggling) is encouraged.<br/><br/>"}, "2228": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic613309.jpg", "poll": {}, "boardgamedesigner": {"722": {"name": "Howard Barasch"}}, "statistics": {}, "boardgamecompilation": {"144845": "The Games of Middle Earth"}, "yearpublished": "1977", "maxplayers": "3", "boardgameartist": {"15260": "Ralph Bakshi"}, "boardgamepublisher": {"5018": {"name": "Encore (for boardgames)"}}, "maxplaytime": "180", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic613309_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "180", "boardgamecategory": {"1022": {"name": "Adventure"}}, "boardgamehonor": {"10886": "1977 Charles S.

Players move one piece per turn and can eliminate the other player's pieces by moving into their space. Movement options depend on which piece it is you're moving. In a fit of conspicuous difference, it's the black side who makes the opening move here.<br/><br/>The central gimmick is that each piece is composed of two parts, a body and a head. The height of the body determines how far a piece can move (one, two or three spaces), whereas the head determines the directions: straight lines (like rooks), diagonals (like bishops), or both (like kings or queens). Each side also has one super-powered queen/rook hybrid which can move to any space within the range determined by its body, and even one unbeatable but immobile head.<br/><br/>There's a reason for all this separation into bodies and heads: after every move the piece which just moved must swap heads with a different type of head, chosen by the player from their pieces still in play.<br/><br/>There are two victory conditions: either you move one of your pieces to a specific target square on the far side of the board, or you force your opponent to make an illegal move. Draws are possible, but rare (they require both sides' forces to be extremely depleted).<br/><br/>The theme is pretty much irrelevant - this is an abstract at heart. The rulebook frames the game as the secret strategy-honing tool of the nobles in a fictional culture, and the rules introduction is presented in dialogue form with the Wise Old Master teaching the game to his Young Noble Student, but none of this is at all relevant to gameplay. In fact, the game presented within the fiction is themeless and, quite literally, abstract: the pieces' names are translated as abstract concepts like 'strength' etc.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": {"115812": "Edition Perlhuhn edition"}, "age": "10", "name": "Ayanu", "playingtime": "30", "average": "7.0697", "usersrated": "33", "boardgamesubdomain": {"4666": "Abstract Games"}, "boardgamefamily": {"26432": "Combinatorial"}}, "2231": {"boardgamedesigner": {"904": {"name": "Claude Soucie"}}, "poll": {}, "name": "Watch", "playingtime": "10", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": {"2046": "Area Movement"}, "yearpublished": "1967", "usersrated": "21", "boardgamesubdomain": {"4666": "Abstract Games"}, "maxplayers": "2", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic44479_t.jpg", "average": "6.02381", "statistics": {}, "boardgamepublisher": {"29": {"name": "ABACUSSPIELE"}}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic44479.jpg", "boardgameversion": {"90054": "Campaign Game Company Travel Edition"}, "maxplaytime": "10", "boardgamecategory": {"1009": {"name": "Abstract Strategy"}}, "age": "6", "minplaytime": "10", "description": "Watch, a.k.a.

It employs a scale of 300 meters per hex, with daily turns and 2160 counters.<br/><br/>The most luscious wargame ever produced (OK no more editorializing). This game has possibly sunk more companies than Hasbro. The two designers spent years researching the orders of battle and aerial maps to produce a game that is possibly the most researched and arguably the most accurate depiction of a battle, mechanics aside.<br/><br/>The large, fairly thin but sturdy counters are the shades of the uniforms of the armies according to the designers. Instead of the usual American style designations on the counters to depict what type of unit it is the designers used the actual designators used by the separate armies. This could be confusing except for the wonderful large player aids supplied with actual photos of the unit types. Labels and ziplock bag are even supplied for sorting purposes although sorting can be confusing. Moves mag put out an issue in the late '70's, early '80's with an article that fixed the problem.<br/><br/>The 3 large maps are taken straight from aerial photos. You see the city block by block and outside the city individual buildings can even be seen. There is very little color on the maps but they are beautiful and very functional. The terrain effects chart once again has actual photos of the terrain so you can get an idea of exactly what the soldiers were facing.<br/><br/>There are many scenarios available so you can tailor the game for time and room as some only use 1 map or a portion of a map. Each scenario has a separate set up sheet for both sides that are large enough to put all the counters on the sheets. Each scenario has a miniature version of the map to be used with set up information. For a monster game it is very easy to set up and get into a game.<br/><br/>There are 3 rulebooks included, 2 basic game and 1 advanced game. When learning the game it is fantastic that they included a rulebook for each player. This is the kind of detail that is evident throughout the game. The rule books are detailed without being overbearing, as a lot of Avalon Hill's and SPI's were from the time period. They are chock full of examples to clear up ambiguities.<br/><br/>The game is difficult because of the scale only. It is actually a fairly simple game, mechanics wise, and can be played by anyone with some wargame experience.

Players will recreate the first six months of furious aerial combat between the might of Imperial Japan and the surprised forces of the United Kingdom and the United States.<br/><br/>Zero! includes the important early-war fighters and bomber of the Imperial Japanese Navy and Army, Royal Air Force, United States Navy, United States Army Air Force, and the American Volunteer Group (the famous Flying Tigers). Fly the fearsome A6M2 Zero against the F4F Wildcat, Hawker Hurricane IIb, Curtiss P-40B and E Tomahawks, and the ill-fated Brewster Buffalo. As a pilot with the Japanese Army, take Ki-27 Nates and Ki-43 Oscars to the skies against the Allies over Malaya and Burma. Match your skills with American aces Wagner, Thach, McCuskey or their semi-mercenary countrymen of the AVG, Hill and Newkirk. The Japanese can counter with Sakai, Anabuki, Kato, and more.<br/><br/>As with the previous games in the series, Zero! includes the Campaigns covering the major aerial events of the December 1941 to June 1942 period. Each consists of multiple missions aimed at a variety of targets, for which you must wisely allocate your resources of men and material. New to Zero! are Carrier Campaigns, which give players some control over the carrier groups their naval squadrons fly from. Do you go all out for a decisive strike or hold your fighters back and let the enemy overextend himself? Campaigns included in this volume are: Pearl Harbor (solitaire), the Philippines, Malaya, Burma, Coral Sea, and Midway.<br/><br/>Both Down in Flames veterans and newcomers to the series will enjoy this latest volume. All the components needed to play are included - ownership of the first two volumes is not necessary, but the three games are completely compatible. Beautiful, newly-designed, full-color action cards drive gameplay, while cards representing the major aircraft of the period and counters of the famous aces allow players to explore a wide range of scenarios. Besides the new Carrier Campaigns, historically significant missions have been added to the standard campaigns and the rules have been updated and expanded.<br/><br/>Are you ready to relive history? Can you sweep the skies in the cockpit of the Zero, delaying or even stopping the appearance of American industrial might? Or will the Allies, in their outdated machines, halt the Japanese onslaught much earlier?<br/><br/>CONTENTS:    <br/><br/>     88 full-color, die-cut counters.<br/>     150 full-color Playing Cards<br/>     6 Campaign Map Displays<br/>     One Bombing Display<br/>     One Resource Sheet<br/>     One 16-page Rulebook<br/>     One 20-page Campaign Booklet<br/>     8 Target Displays<br/>     Three Campaign Logs <br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Designed by Dan Verssen<br/>Developed by Mike Lemick<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": {"26007": "First Edition"}, "average": "6.94317", "name": "Zero!", "playingtime": "60", "boardgamemechanic": {"2018": "Campaign / Battle Card Driven"}, "age": "12", "boardgameexpansion": {}, "usersrated": "557", "boardgamesubdomain": {"4664": "Wargames"}, "boardgamefamily": {"75": "Down in Flames"}}, "2248": {"boardgamedesigner": {"940": {"name": "Jack B.

The squares are sprinkled with numbers, of values increasing near the outer corners. The players have sets of 18 (for the two-player game) clear and smoked plastic of tangram shapes, some of which have a 2 or 3 over a certain square.<br/><br/>Starting in the center, the players lay their pieces so as to score, adjacent to an existing piece. A piece normally scores the numbers it covers; if it has a number of its own and that number falls directly over a scoring square, they are multiplied. You can sacrifice a piece by playing it upside down; it scores half (rounding down) and the opponent isn't allowed to play a piece adjacent to the sacrificed piece on his next turn --this is a neat trick when approaching a high-scoring area. You cannot sacrifice on the first turn. You cannot play outside the arena until you've accumulated at least 75 in score.<br/><br/>Score is kept with the help of tracking pieces on the outside edges of the game board.<br/><br/>The playing tiles come in six different shapes, each with their own name:<br/><br/>The Eye (covers 1 square);<br/>    The Rod (covers 2 squares);<br/>    The Quoin or Corner(covers 3 squares);<br/>    The Snake (covers 4 squares);<br/>    The Door (covers 5 squares);<br/>    The Gun (covers 6 squares).<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": {"258208": "Clem Toys Italian edition"}, "name": "Skirrid", "playingtime": "45", "boardgamemechanic": {"2002": "Tile Placement"}, "average": "5.63649", "usersrated": "114", "boardgamesubdomain": {"4666": "Abstract Games"}, "boardgamefamily": {"24571": "Polyominoes"}}, "2039": {"boardgamedesigner": {"37368": {"name": "Edward Schifman"}}, "poll": {}, "name": "Barrier", "playingtime": "20", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": {"2002": "Tile Placement"}, "yearpublished": "1975", "usersrated": "11", "boardgamesubdomain": {"4666": "Abstract Games"}, "maxplayers": "2", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic878148_t.jpg", "average": "4.59091", "statistics": {}, "boardgamepublisher": {"440": {"name": "Aladdin"}}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic878148.jpg", "boardgameversion": {"69927": "Aladdin First Edition"}, "maxplaytime": "20", "boardgamecategory": {"1009": {"name": "Abstract Strategy"}}, "age": "8", "minplaytime": "20", "description": "Barrier:  The international game of tactical momentum<br/><br/>As in checkers, the object of the game is to eliminate the opponent's playing pieces by jumping them from adjacent squares.
