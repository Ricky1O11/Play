The game contains unique gameplay, along with many nonsensical or comedic themes not present in other games of the genre, but was never ported to other consoles because of its relative unpopularity in arcade centers.<br/><br/>The game is set around the time of World War I, where the player maneuvers biplanes, automobiles, animals, and various other unidentifiable objects to battle an army of mech-wielding scientists.<br/><br/>The player uses the 8-way joystick to control the biplane's movements, and the 2 buttons to shoot or hook enemies. The biggest characteristic of the player's biplane is the hook attached to its rear section. The hook is also controlled by the joystick, and enemies or objects that come in contact with the hook are dragged along by the plane. Dragged objects cause damage to anything they collide with, and the player can release the objects on the hook by pressing the hook button again. Dragged objects are destroyed when the player releases them from the hook, or if they collide enough times to break apart.<br/><br/>The ship's power gauge increases when the player taps the shot button rapidly, and filling up the gauge causes the plane to shoot a bolt of lightning that covers a large area of the screen. However, the plane overheats if the player taps the shot button too many times, so this attack must be used sparingly.<br/><br/>The game's graphics are highly detailed, and many of the backgrounds are likened to European towns and cities or World's fair-like scenes. Many of the game's background objects can also be destroyed or dragged around with the hook.<br/><br/>"}, "91502": {"poll": [], "name": "Boot Hill", "videogamemode": ["Local Multiplayer", "Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["NA Arcade edition"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1550001.png", "videogametheme": ["Western"], "usersrated": "1", "videogamedeveloper": ["Midway Games Inc."], "videogamegenre": ["Classic Games", "Shooter"], "videogameplatform": ["Arcade"], "average": "5", "statistics": [], "videogamepublisher": ["Midway Games Inc."], "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1550001_t.png", "description": "Source: Wikipedia, &quot;Boot Hill (arcade game)&quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>Boot Hill is a shooter arcade game released by Midway in 1977.

The player must move the spider around the web while simultaneously shooting/avoiding various bugs and collecting the bonuses that appear after the enemies are eliminated. The spider is controlled through two joysticks; the left one is used to move the spider, and the right one is used to control the shot direction.<br/><br/>The game is a fixed shooter and is very similar to Robotron 2084 by Williams. Unlike Robotron, Black Widow does not have as many enemies on-screen. However, the gameplay has been characterized as just as intense as its Williams counterpart. This is because in order to destroy certain enemies, the player must lure other enemies into destroying them. It is further differentiated by the Bug Slayer, a bug that helps the player eliminate enemies, with only loss of potential points being the only consequence. The Bug Slayer can help the player in tough situations, but can also prevent the player from achieving the amount of extra lives necessary to endure later, more difficult, rounds. Also, other enemies appear on the playing field as eggs, laid by other enemies.

They must conjure the mysterious powers of Quiddity, cast powerful spells, and summon their creatures to battle if they hope to overcome rivals and earn their rightful place as the Champion!<br/><br/>Quarriors has the frenetic excitement of a dice battle game, with an added &lsquo;deckbuilding&rsquo; twist: players customize their dice pools during the game using resources generated by their rolls.<br/><br/>Quarriors takes the best of deckbuilding games without the tedium of shuffling.  Take a typical deckbuilding game, add the speed and fun of dice and in 60 minutes you&rsquo;re on your second or third game trying unique strategies against your opponents.<br/><br/>Alternate Description of Quarriors<br/><br/>In Quarriors, each player plays as a Quarrior competing for Glory in the eyes of Quiana, the Empress of Quaridia. Each player starts with an identical set of 12 dice in their dice bag. At the start of the game, Creature and Spell dice (Quarry) are dealt at random to form &quot;the Wilds&quot; in the center of the table. As play progresses, players roll their dice to attempt to summon Creatures, cast Spells, and harness the magical power of Quiddity (the in-game resource) to capture Quarry from the Wilds to add to their repertoire and into their dice bag. Players draw and roll 6 dice a turn from their bag, making that controlling bag composition is key to victory.<br/><br/>Quarriors is a fast-paced game where players must strategically balance their choices each turn. Do I use my Quiddity to summon Creatures in the hopes of scoring Glory or should I spend it all to capture more powerful Quarry from the Wilds? Players must outmaneuver their opponent's through strategic Spell use, the acquisition of powerful Quarry, and ultimately, by striking down opponent's Creature in combat. If your Creatures survive until your next turn, you will score Glory points and move closer to victory!<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": ["Brazilian First Edition", "English edition 2013", "English first edition 2011", "English second edition 2012", "French first edition", "German first edition", "Italian first edition", "Japanese first edition", "Russian edition"], "boardgameintegration": ["Quarriors!

Although commonly mistaken as a bootleg, the game is officially licensed for non-U.S. markets and is based on different hardware. The game retains all of the gameplay elements of Donkey Kong, but has all of the graphics redrawn and re-colorized. Crazy Kong is also known as the portmanteau Congorilla, Crazy Kong Part II, and Monkey Donkey.<br/><br/>There are two versions of the original Crazy Kong and Crazy Kong Part II; the differences of which are in minor cinematic artifacts and bugs, color palette choices and minor gameplay differences. Crazy Kong Part I shows no copyright or company name on the title screen. Crazy Kong (parts I and II) runs on modified Crazy Climber hardware. In addition there are other versions of the game that run on Scramble, Jeutel, Orca, and Alca hardware. The official versions of game came in two different stand up cabinets that featured a large and angry, rather than comic, ape embedded in the artwork. <br/>The title screen of the game features either the text &quot;Crazy Kong&quot; or &quot;Monkey Donkey&quot; written in girders dependent upon which version is running. There is no graphic of Kong on the main screen. No copyright, just the year '1981'. The girder text does not flash different colours for a few seconds before stopping, as in Donkey Kong.<br/>The color palette has been almost completely changed; Part I and Part II have different palette choices.<br/>Most of the game graphics have been re-drawn; while Donkey Kong looks almost the same from a side view, his frontal appearance is noticeably different when he opens his mouth; he is taller and much more fierce looking.<br/>Many animations are removed. For example in the classic first level, barrels appear from Crazy Kong, as opposed to showing the rolling animations. He is locked in the horizontal roll animation but does not reach for the other barrels or move when rolling barrels vertically. Frames of animation are also removed at the beginning and ending of each level.<br/>The sound effects are altered and are generally more crude sounding. The background humming music is removed and Jumpman is given a digital sample &quot;hugggh&quot; sound when jumping. A lot of the in game sounds such as the &quot;Kong chest beating&quot; can also be found in the game Crazy Climber on those versions that run on its proprietary hardware.<br/>The game is considered slightly more difficult than Donkey Kong because the collision detection is less forgiving and the game is slightly faster.<br/><br/>"}, "91591": {"poll": [], "name": "Clay Pigeon", "videogamemode": ["Hotseat", "Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["NA arcade edition"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1551135.png", "videogametheme": ["Hunting"], "usersrated": "0", "videogamedeveloper": ["Exidy"], "videogamegenre": ["Light Gun Shooter"], "videogameplatform": ["Arcade"], "average": "0", "statistics": [], "videogamepublisher": ["Exidy"], "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1551135_t.png", "description": "User Summary<br/><br/>A basic simple skeet shooting game.

Once players decide on a region, they can enter a portal and then be whisked away to a 3D world. Among the environments players will explore are Jimmy's House, an Asteroid Surface, an Asteroid Interior, Yolkus Prime, and Retroland Amusement Park. Each region spans multiple levels, with the goal in each being to find a number of key items and special prizes and a shrunken head. A secondary goal in some levels is to locate friends Carl Wheezer, Cindy Vortex, Rose, Nissa, and Zachary.<br/><br/>Enemies trying to prevent Jimmy from succeeding include giant ants and the blob-like Yokians, with villains Ooblar, Poultra, and King Goobot forming the boss encounters. Jimmy Neutron is not helpless in his first GameCube adventure, so players can run, jump, kick, and use an assortment of inventions. Health can be replenished by finding slices of blueberry pie, extra lives are awarded for every ten neutrons found, and weapons include the Shrink Ray, Inflato Ray, and the Jimmy Bat. Three types of vehicles can also be used to traverse the levels, the Goddard Pogo, the Goddard Sled, and the Goddard Scooter, all courtesy of Jimmy's loyal sidekick.<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;Jimmy Neutron: Boy Genius (video game)&quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "91618": {"poll": [], "name": "Lighthouse: The Dark Being", "videogamemode": ["Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["North American DOS/Windows edition"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3318397.jpg", "videogametheme": ["Ocean / Sea", "Science Fiction"], "usersrated": "2", "videogamedeveloper": ["Sierra Entertainment Inc."], "videogamegenre": ["Adventure"], "videogameplatform": ["DOS", "Macintosh", "Windows"], "average": "5", "statistics": [], "videogamepublisher": ["Sierra Entertainment Inc."], "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3318397_t.jpg", "description": "Lighthouse: The Dark Being is an adventure game developed and released by Sierra On-Line.<br/><br/>The game is a first person adventure with a point and click interface, similar to Myst.<br/><br/>Plot:<br/><br/>The Player starts the game in their new cottage on the Oregon coast. According to the Players diary, he/she (personal effects in the new cottage, such as a handbag, suggest a female protagonist, but the gender is never explicitly defined) is a struggling writer who has just moved in, and recently met his eccentric next door neighbor, Dr. Jeremiah Krick, and his daughter Amanda, who live in a nearby lighthouse. Glancing out of the window, he sees the lighthouse struck by lightning and, afterwards, begin to glow strangely. On the Player's answering machine, Dr. Krick has left a frantic message begging the player to come over to his house and watch Amanda.<br/><br/>Upon arriving at Dr. Kricks house, the player discovers the front door locked, darkness inside, and silence. After turning on the power and entering, the player finds Amanda in her crib, alone. Once the player has explored the house, a snap is heard, and Amanda begins crying. When the player enters her room, the &quot;Dark Being&quot;, described in Dr. Kricks journal, takes Amanda, and jumps through a portal. At this point, the Player can either follow him through, or use Dr. Krick's laboratory to construct their own portal. Either way, the player ends up on a rocky beach in a parallel world. Krick's notes on this make reference to the real physical concept of Godel's universe.<br/><br/>As the player explores 6 different locations in the parallel world, the goal becomes clear. They must build an Ionizing Cannon, whose 7 pieces are scattered between the different locations. Then, the player must use this cannon to capture the Dark Being, and save Dr. Krick and Amanda.<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;Lighthouse: The Dark Being&quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "91619": {"poll": [], "name": "NBA Street", "videogamemode": ["Local Multiplayer", "Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["NA GameCube edition", "NA PlayStation edition"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1321745.jpg", "videogameseries": ["NBA Street"], "videogametheme": ["Sports - Basketball"], "usersrated": "3", "videogamedeveloper": ["EA Canada"], "videogamegenre": ["Sports"], "videogameplatform": ["GameCube", "PlayStation 2"], "videogamehonor": ["2001 Game Critics Best Sports Game of the Year Nominee"], "average": "5", "statistics": [], "videogamepublisher": ["EA Sports"], "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1321745_t.jpg", "description": "NBA Street is a basketball video game developed by EA Canada. It was released in 2001 for the PlayStation 2 and in 2002 for the GameCube. It combines the talent and big names of the NBA with the attitude and atmosphere of streetball. NBA Street was followed by NBA Street Vol. 2, NBA Street V3, and NBA Street Homecourt.<br/><br/>NBA Street consisted of three-on-three basketball games. Asides from the basic structure of basketball, players try to collect trick points, which are scored through the use of almost every basketball game maneuver such as faking out defenders, shot blocking, diving for the ball, and dunking. If a team fills a special meter through flashy and effective gameplay, they get to perform a Gamebreaker, which is a special shot that not only adds to their score, but it subtracts an amount from their opponents' score.<br/><br/>Single player options included a user-created player touring famous American locations, picking up teammates from NBA rosters along the way.<br/><br/>The gameplay could be considered an &quot;arcade&quot; style of basketball in that it is not a true simulation, similar to the NBA Jam series. For instance, in-game players were able to jump high enough to grab three-point shots mid-arc (goaltending is permitted and is often used as a defensive strategy). Games on the default setting are scored not by traditional standards, as two-point field goals are worth one point, while made shots behind the three-point line rewarded two points. Instead of a time limit, the first team to score a predetermined amount of points were deemed the winner. However, variant options existed, such as matches based on trick points.<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;NBA Street&quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "91620": {"image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1067034.jpg", "poll": [], "boardgamedesigner": ["Sean MacDonald"], "statistics": [], "yearpublished": "2011", "maxplayers": "4", "boardgameartist": ["Jean Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Bazille", "Sandro Botticelli", "Mary Cassatt", "Paul C\u00e9zanne", "Leonardo da Vinci", "Edgar Degas", "Paul Gauguin", "El Greco", "Winslow Homer", "\u00c9douard Manet", "Franz Marc", "Claude Monet", "Raphael", "Pierre-Auguste Renoir", "Georges Seurat", "Paul Signac", "Gerard ter Borch", "Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec", "Rogier van der Weyden", "Vincent van Gogh", "Rembrandt van Rijn", "Diego Vel\u00e1zquez", "Johannes Vermeer"], "boardgamepublisher": ["Eagle-Gryphon Games", "Pegasus Spiele"], "maxplaytime": "60", "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1067034_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "45", "boardgamecategory": ["Educational", "Renaissance"], "boardgamehonor": ["2011 Mensa Select Winner", "2011 Origins Awards Best Boardgame Nominee"], "description": "A world of beautiful colors comes alive in Pastiche as players choose commission cards picturing 34 of the finest European art works of the past six centuries.

The young boy was aware he was approaching the hallowed grounds of ancient dwarven crypts, and knew better than to go near such a sacred place, uninvited by the dwarven priesthood. But it mattered not, because Forlin was quite venturesome.<br/><br/>Lying at the outskirts of dusty ruins, only a few crypts remained undamaged, their entrances carved out of the mountainside, surrounded by crumbling citadels and abandoned temples of ancient times. Forlin passed a crypt of particular interest, one he knew was ordinarily sealed shut. Forgetting all about hunting moose, his curiosity took over. He lit a torch, and entered the dark entrance hall. To his disappointment, all of the rooms seemed devoid of the riches he heard about in common dwarven stories. Until, that is, he discovered a room containing an ornate fountain. A carved dwarf head spit water into its rectangular basin, and sitting atop the water basin&rsquo;s edges were nine golden statuettes, representing key figures of the dwarven people&rsquo;s past. On both sides of the fountain there were two small iron braziers, unlit.<br/><br/>Fearing the worst if he dared touch something, Forlin went back to the town of Bloodspring, revealing his fantastic discovery to Borakr Nord and Ulric Willow, two promising local warriors, both of whom he idolized. Borakr admonished the boy to keep this news a secret between them. However, initially, Ulric was against this, thinking it better to report the open crypt to the town elders. But Borakr convinced him to keep his mouth shut, in the interest of personal gain. Forlin, excited about treasure, agreed to guide the two warriors to the crypt. Once there, Borakr and Ulric would enter the crypt and steal the statuettes to sell them at the nearest port. The gold would then be split equally among the three of them. Borakr however, had other plans in mind&hellip;<br/><br/>During their preparations to empty the crypt, Forlin&rsquo;s older sister Freyla spied on them, and immediately alerted the town&rsquo;s elder about what was going on. Although she did not hear the whole story, the elder knew this meant trouble, especially since the town&rsquo;s dwarves were unaware of the situation.<br/><br/>"}, "91642": {"poll": [], "name": "Doodle Blast", "videogamemode": ["Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["iPhone edition"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic909755.png", "videogametheme": ["Science Fiction"], "usersrated": "0", "videogamedeveloper": ["iDevMobile"], "videogamegenre": ["Shoot 'em Up"], "videogameplatform": ["iPhone"], "average": "0", "statistics": [], "videogamepublisher": ["iDevMobile"], "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic909755_t.png", "description": "Doodle Blast is an survival arcade style shooter with good doodle images where you control a astronaut with a big arsenal of weapons.

There they hope to harvest top quality hardwoods from the stands of oak and maple. This deal would prove an economic boon for the struggling community. Not only would the lease pay the township well, the new industry would provide a fresh economic base for businesses in the town.<br/><br/>Supervisor Barnes, the head of the local Unitarian Church and a student of naturalist John Muir, at first backed the proposal but now stands four-square against it, citing the &quot;desecration of God's domain&quot; as his main concern. His position has until now received the support of two of the three town council members and a small majority of the townsfolk.

Its sequel, The Fairly OddParents: Shadow Showdown is on GameCube, Game Boy Advance and PS2. The console versions of this game features a different plot than the PC version.<br/><br/>Once again, Timmy Turner's mother and father have gone on a vacation, and left Timmy with the evil babysitter Vicky. When Timmy tries to make a wish, his fairy godparents Cosmo and Wanda tell him that it's against &quot;Da Rules&quot;. Outraged, Timmy wishes he didn't have to follow the rules. So, Cosmo destroys the book. Vicky arrives, and gains possession of Da Rules. She wishes Timmy was still sleeping, and since she has possession of a fairy item, her wish is granted. Timmy, Cosmo, Wanda and Julia go to Fairy Court, and are accused of destroying Da Rules. Jorgen Von Strangle gives the three of them 49 &frac12; hours to find the missing pages of Da Rules. Timmy must navigate through ten levels and find the pages before Vicky's wishes become too extreme!<br/><br/>The PC version features a different plot. In this version, Juandissimo Magnifico tricks Timmy into wishing the book destroyed so that Cosmo and Wanda will get in trouble for it. It also notably features an appearance by Vicky and Tootie's mother (at Timmy's age, as the level featuring her is set in the past), named Nicky. Here, she is shown behaving a lot like Tootie, and Timmy initially mistakes her for Tootie when he first sees her, although the in-game graphics depict her as resembling a younger Vicky.<br/><br/>In the Game Boy version, Anti-Cosmo arrives to steal the book, and you defeat Vicky at the very end to restore peace.<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;The Fairly OddParents: Breakin' Da Rules&quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "91655": {"boardgamedesigner": ["Bernhard Lach", "Uwe Rapp"], "average": "4.4125", "poll": [], "name": "Arschbombe", "playingtime": "20", "minplayers": "2", "yearpublished": "2011", "usersrated": "16", "maxplayers": "4", "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic939004_t.jpg", "boardgameartist": ["Tobias Schweiger"], "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["Zoch Verlag"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic939004.jpg", "boardgameversion": ["First edition"], "maxplaytime": "20", "boardgamecategory": ["Action / Dexterity", "Card Game"], "age": "8", "minplaytime": "20", "description": "In Arschbombe &ndash; German for &quot;cannonball&quot; &ndash; players make cards &quot;dive&quot; from their hand into a swimming pool comprised of cards.<br/><br/>To start the game, players create a swimming pool via a ring of scoring cards, with more cards in the ring for more players.

The game was released on many Nintendo consoles in the United States, but only on the Wii in the United Kingdom.<br/><br/>Plot<br/><br/>When Grim's Mojo Balls get unleashed into Endsville, causing normal people to senselessly beat the tar out of each other (according to Grim, anyone touched by a Mojo Ball will be infected by supernatural rage), it's up to Billy, Mandy, Grim, Irwin and all of Endsville to save the world. They trek through places from their episodes such as the underworld, the pumpkin patch, even Billy's backyard. In the end, it turns out that Billy is to blame for the release of the Mojo Balls (he wanted to free Moe and Joe) and is severely punished by Mandy in the end credits (she mentioned that she hoped if the game had a mode which she and the others could just beat on Billy). During the credits you get to play as Mandy and beat Billy senseless with a flamethrower, melee attacks, and thor's hammer. (This is the only point in the game where Billy does nothing to cause damage to the player in return).<br/><br/>Gameplay<br/><br/>The gameplay heavily mirrors that of the Power Stone series. In the game, you can execute light and heavy style attacks. Gameplay includes 2-4 player Multiplayer, solo, and co-op Story Mode and Mission Mode. The environment is very interactive, with the ability to manipulate many objects. There are different weapons scattered through all the levels, such as a halberd or a club. Treasure chests contain a variety of items including weapons, cupcakes, hamhocks (which restore health), and Mojo Balls that fill up your Mojo Meter. When the Mojo Meter fills once, a Mojo Smackdown can be performed, where the character attacks the opponent with a barrage of punches, kicks, and slaps, finally destroying the opponent with a piledriver. When the Mojo Meter fills twice, a Mojo Meltdown can be performed, instantly knocking out all opponents. Each round of fighting begins with banter from each character on the playing field. An opponent isn't fully defeated until their lives are depleted AND the player or another opponent attacks them, triggering a 'finishing blow' sequence, in which whoever hits them has to do 4 finishing blows, knocking that opponent of the arena and the game. In Story Mode, the game culminates with a battle against the brain-eating meteor from Little Rock of Horror.<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;The Grim Adventures of Billy &amp; Mandy (video game)&quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "91662": {"poll": [], "name": "The Legend of Spyro: Dawn of the Dragon", "videogamemode": ["Cooperative", "Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["English/European PlayStation 3 edition", "English/European Wii edition", "North American Nintendo DS edition"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1220873.jpg", "videogameseries": ["Spyro"], "videogametheme": ["Cartoon", "Cute Fantasy"], "videogamefranchise": ["Spyro"], "videogamecharacter": ["Spyro"], "videogamedeveloper": ["Etranges Libellules", "Tantalus"], "videogamegenre": ["Action"], "videogameplatform": ["Nintendo DS", "PlayStation 3", "Wii"], "usersrated": "5", "average": "6.4", "statistics": [], "videogamepublisher": ["Activision", "Sierra Entertainment Inc."], "vgcharacterversion": ["Spyro"], "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1220873_t.jpg", "description": "The Legend of Spyro: Dawn of the Dragon is the third and final installment in The Legend of Spyro trilogy, as well as the tenth anniversary game of the series.

Although Krome Studios developed the previous two Legend of Spyro games, &Eacute;tranges Libellules developed the console editions of Dawn of the Dragon, while Tantalus Media developed the Nintendo DS version. Both versions were published by Sierra Entertainment along with Activision Blizzard. The game was originally titled The Legend of Spyro: The Darkest Hour.<br/><br/>Gameplay<br/><br/>The gameplay is more advanced than previous titles in the series. This is the first Spyro game that allows a player to fly at any time they want (free-fly mode). The game also features a co-op mode with Cynder. The co-op feature allows players to have the option of completing the game as either Spyro or Cynder, along with giving them the power to switch between Spyro and Cynder, giving them more freedom to explore the world in completely new ways.<br/><br/>The environments are much larger than in previous games and a majority of them have a bit more exploration to them. In previous titles of the Legend of Spyro series, Spyro must travel through the level and defeat enemies in a linear fashion. This time however, the game has more freedom by exploring larger areas and collecting items in order to progress through the game.<br/><br/>Spyro retains his command of fire, electricity, earth and ice, while Cynder controls poison, wind, shadow and fear, the powers that were given to her when she was controlled by the Dark Master. Cynder is faster but weaker than Spyro. Along with the standard power ups that gems will bring, Spyro and Cynder can both equip pieces of Dragon Armour that they find. They also have another feature called melee combos. The more times the player hits the enemy the more Blue Gems the players will earn. Blue Gems power up Spyro and Cynder, allowing them to upgrade moves. Along with Blue Gems there are also Red gems, that restore lost health. The green gems give the dragons magic, allowing element attacks. The Fury Gems from previous titles have been removed (replaced by dark crystals that can drain magic if they're not destroyed), and the Fury Meter now goes up depending on the number of times Spyro or Cynder score attacks on enemies. In addition to normal enemies, there are elite enemies, which are enemies that are stronger than normal enemies. Their masks make them invincible to normal attacks. The player must use an element of a designated color that matches that of the mask in order to knock the mask off.

The object of the game is to interact with NPCs in order to populate various towns. The game was released under a traditional CD-ROM format, uncommon to the PS2. A sequel was announced by Natsume, titled Metropolismania 2. The title was released on August 21, 2007 in North America and in Japan on July 13, 2006 by D3 Publisher. Another sequel, Metropolismania 3, was released for the PlayStation Portable by D3 publishing but in Japan only.<br/><br/>Gameplay<br/><br/>There are various goals to complete in each of the five main scenarios. Goals always involve growing the town to a given population, and often ensuring that a percentage of the buildings are of a certain type, i.e. businesses, farms, or amusement facilities. There are also side stories that occur within each scenario, sometimes including bizarre instances involving smuggling rings, a cult, and even aliens. When all requirements for the scenario have been met, the player's boss will call to congratulate them and send a letter of resignation, allowing the player to move on to the next scenario.<br/><br/>Gameplay also centers heavily on interaction with the in-game characters. Each character has a friendship meter that increases or decreases based on interactions such as &quot;gossip&quot; and giving gifts. Relationship statuses are: &quot;stranger,&quot; &quot;know the face,&quot; &quot;acquaintance,&quot; &quot;friend,&quot; and &quot;best friend.&quot; Introducing new citizens or solving complaints is often based on good friendship status with these characters.<br/><br/>The game is notable for its rather poor English translation, one example includes &quot;Hello, this is [name] from the Senior Citizen,&quot; if a Senior Citizen were to contact the player and introduce themselves. Also, one might greet the player with phrases uncommon in English-speaking countries such as the Japanese &quot;Have you eaten?&quot; which is a greeting question not meant to be answered, much like the American &quot;How's it going?&quot; Another one is that a character saying that they enjoy watching animations. Anime is Japanese for cartoon, so the character should have said they enjoy watching cartoons. These errors also include misuse of other languages such as an Italian Pasta restaurant owner who greets the player with the French greeting &quot;Bonjour&quot; rather than the Italian equivalent &quot;Buongiorno&quot;.

Over the course of several generations, those in power change. Players try to influence succession and match their House's resources to the interests of the True Power in the land (often not the actual monarch). By adding new family branches, using carefully arranged marriages, and managing grants players raise their prestige in the hopes of seizing power after the inevitable downfall of the monarchy.<br/><br/>Basic Play<br/>Each player has a house display representing their larger political family. BRANCHES make up that family, beginning the game with a same number of small family branches. Each branch is represented by a card with a branch name and spaces for GRANTS. Grants represent offices, industries, resources, contacts and so on which that part of the family has control of. There are six kinds of grants: Influence (INFL) which generates the currency for play and the five areas of control: Activism (ACT), Intellectual (INT), Religion (REL), Society (SOC) and Warfare (WAR). Grants, represented by tiles, can move around throughout the game. Some branches may also have special abilities which allow special actions or modify the values of the grants attached to them.<br/><br/>During each turn, players may add a new branch to their House Display. Since they only may have five branches at a time, they will eventually have to Marry or merge two of those houses, creating a new branch. Each turn players gain currency in the form of influence, bid to add a branch, support those in power, and take actions. Some actions can always be taken, while others require the use of particular grant types. At the end of the turn, players check to see which Royal currently holds sway in the realm. Players score VPs based on the interests of that Royal and how well their various branches and grants match those.<br/><br/>"}, "91683": {"image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic943557.jpg", "poll": [], "boardgamedesigner": ["L.

Salvation is buried in Hell&rsquo;s corridors, and the barons of Heaven watch the world&rsquo;s woe with silent indifference. Welcome to Enoch.<br/><br/>A millennium ago, the world ended. Civilization was devoured by plague and fire. Mankind faced extinction. The handful who survived were scattered to the wilderness. They scoured the Earth for the Promised Land: a place untouched by the Fall of Man. They searched for ages but found only Man&rsquo;s ruin and Nature&rsquo;s malice. Finally, their journey stopped where it began. Old and weary, they waited for death. &ldquo;There is no Promised Land,&rdquo; they told their children, the tribes of Enoch. &ldquo;So you must build one.&rdquo;<br/><br/>Enoch is the story of man starting over in a world that has not forgot his sins.<br/><br/>In the absence of civilization, nature has flourished to prehistoric levels. Rising ocean and creeping jungle have buried the ruins of ancient cities. Millennia of technological progress have been swept away, leaving man to fend for himself against ravenous beasts and waves of plague that spill into his settlements.<br/><br/>Not all that was buried is dead. The underworld bustles with electric life, thrall to a pantheon of machine gods. Demons, the ancient slaves of man, toil leagues underground. Driven mad by failing power and frayed circuit, they claw their way to the surface, to the peril of their old masters.<br/><br/>Fear and oppression shackle man.

You battle so that the new world won&rsquo;t share the fate of the old. Your trials will be legendary. You will deliver man from bandit hordes, despots, demons, and monstrous freaks of nature. However, your most troubling foe will always be yourself. The new world will be built on your deeds.

The mecha, officially known as &quot;Variant Armors&quot;, in this game are the same ones featured in the fighting action game Armored Warriors. It was ported to the Sega Saturn and the PlayStation. The game only saw limited distribution in arcades outside of Japan, and none of the console ports were released overseas. Tech Romancer (produced by Capcom and ported to the Dreamcast) is considered a spiritual sequel for this game, Jin and BX-02 Blodia are present in the game as an unlockable bonus character/mecha.<br/><br/>In the game the player first chooses the pilot and then the mech (Valiant/Variant Armor or VA for short) they'll use to fight. The mechs determine the gameplay of the game, but the pilot is what determines the storyline the player will see. Near the end of the 21st century Earth begins to become over populated leading to many people living in man made space colonies. The primary army of Earth, &quot;Earth Force&quot;, has been conducting experiments and their work, along with the actions of the playable characters will determine the future of Earth.<br/><br/>The premise in Cyberbots is similar to its predecessor Armored Warriors, albeit it features only a maximum of two playable characters on screen as opposed to three. Cyberbots is a very innovative game, attributed to its amount of selectable options, parts, and mecha that permit the player to format their play style to their preference. Similar to the Armored Core series, different legs (which affect movement abilities), arms (which affect reach and melee capabilities) and weapons can be mixed and matched between the selectable robots available to the player.<br/><br/>Gameplay in Cyberbots is similar to other Capcom-created fighting games, with a medium-sized command list of executing various attacks available to each individual robot.

This type of movement is slightly similar to the ones in Atari Games' Pit-Fighter and SNK's Fatal Fury: King of Fighters, but with a lot more free movement. The player has a character roster of six playable fighters to choose from, each with their own fighting style and special techniques.

The game featured the player driving a Bigfoot-esque monster truck over four different tracks. The objective is to race through rough areas while trying to outrun the other racers. To win, the player must place within 3rd Place or better to advance to the next challenge. If they fail to do so, they will be disqualified. The player can also collect cash bonuses from winning races. Double Axle features four different areas to race in, which include a cross-country race, a mud-bog race, a mountain climbing race, and a car crushing contest.<br/><br/>Only seen in the North American version, Double Axle offered players the option to upgrade their monster truck before every race. When starting the game, the player is given a small amount of money to buy their first upgrade. However, in order to obtain more upgrades for the player's monster truck, the player must first win races for extra money. These upgrades include accelerator upgrades, several engine upgrades, bulkier tires (for better traction), and up to three nitro boosters (which is essential to win some races).<br/><br/>On almost every course, the player will come across several racing hazards. Aside from being able to crush trees among other things, the monster truck cannot collide with giant rocks or other trucks. If the player collides with other trucks, the player may slow down. But if the player hits a giant rock, this will cause the truck to stop, which will mean the player will have to immediately put the truck in reverse and pull back.<br/><br/>Also, near the end of most of the courses, environmental conditions will worsen. In the cross-country race, the player will have to maneuver through a raging volcano eruption, dodging several falling rocks in the process. In the mud-bog race, the player must dodge several giant tornadoes. In the &quot;Icy Road&quot; mountain climb, the player drive through a blizzard, dodging whatever flies at them.<br/><br/>And finally, some races take place on a cliffside area or crossing over a canyon, via a bridge. In the mud-bog race, the player can leap over the canyon via rocks or dirt mounds. These areas must be handled very carefully by the player. If they slip off the side or undershoot on the jumps, the truck will plummet to the ground and explode, costing the player precious time.<br/><br/>The first race, being the easiest race, is the Cross-Country Race. The objective is to drive over terrain without the use of roads. There are several pitfalls and dangers, but these can easily be avoided.<br/><br/>The second race, which is moderately harder, is the Mud-Bog Race. The objective is to drive through rivers of mud and occasionally race through rugged terrain filled with giant rocks. From time to time, the player will have to make a leap of faith across canyons.<br/><br/>The third race, which is the hardest of all three races, is the Icy Road Race. The objective is to safely race through the snowy terrain while trying to stay on the road. The player will eventually race through an icy cavern, avoiding any ice pillars inside. At the end, the player must also carefully navigate their way across a steep mountain top while fighting a fierce blizzard.<br/><br/>At the beginning of both the Cross-Country Race and Mud-Bog Race, the announcer is heard saying &quot;Welcome back to the Monster Race, here in Miami!&quot; Though the game claims to be located in Miami, the terrain looks nothing like that of Florida.<br/><br/>This is the most popular part of Double Axle. The player will have over 60&ndash;75 seconds to crush as many cars, buses, signs, among other things as they can. However, the player will also be paired up against a rival driver. The object is to score higher than the rival before time runs out. If the player is successful, they will move on to the next round. If not, the game will be over. The rounds take place from various locations such as a stadium or a busy highway. In the North American version, a beach area and an obstacle course was added as well.<br/><br/>However, in the North American version of Double Axle, this Car Crushing Contest also came as a bonus round for every race that was completed successfully. Then, the player must crush as much as they can within 60 seconds. The more points they score, the more cash they will win, which can also be used to purchase necessary upgrades for the next races. Ultimately however, the Car Crushing Contest (known also as the Obstacle Course) would later be the final race of the game, and if the player fails to complete the race, the game is automatically over.<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;Double Axle&quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "91732": {"poll": [], "name": "Double-Wings", "videogamemode": ["Cooperative", "Local Multiplayer", "Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["NA Arcade edition"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1575028.png", "videogametheme": ["Flight", "War - Future"], "usersrated": "0", "videogamedeveloper": ["Mitchell Corporation"], "videogamegenre": ["Shoot 'em Up"], "videogameplatform": ["Arcade"], "average": "0", "statistics": [], "videogamepublisher": ["Mitchell Corporation"], "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1575028_t.png", "description": "User Summary<br/><br/>A vertical scrolling shooter.

The dragon is invincible, capable of blocking most enemy projectiles and damaging enemies on contact; the human, however, is not, but is armed with a forward-firing crossbow.<br/><br/>The dragon's body is very flexible and responds to the player's movement, enabling the player to use the dragon as a mobile shield or as a whip-like weapon. You can also circle the tail around a group of enemies to kill them. The tail of the yellow or blue dragon can be coiled around the player to offer almost complete invulnerability for a limited time.<br/><br/>The dragon can also spit fireballs, in a manner very similar to the Wave Cannon from R-Type. By holding the fire button down, the dragon will build up fire in its mouth; the longer the button is held down, the more powerful the fireball will be. There are four levels of fireball power; at its strongest, the fireball resembles a dragon's head. The game also contains some platforming elements - the human is able to dismount on horizontal platforms.<br/><br/>Power-ups can be acquired by shooting small green dragons that appear intermittently throughout the levels, or they can be collected from the ground on foot.

Using a brawl between shepherds and millers as a pretext, Picrochole, King of Lerne, declared war on Gargantua's father, Grandgousier. A model of the enlightened monarch of the Renaissance, Grandgousier attempted to avert war by all means. But Picrochole, taking this as a sign of Grandgousier's weakness, invaded his neighbor's kingdom. Grandgousier calls upon his son, and Gargantua, at the head of an army of his loyal companions, inflicts a humiliating defeat on Picrochole, who flees on the back of a donkey.<br/><br/>The Picrocholine Wars simulates this celebrated episode of French literature through a fun and simple wargame. Players will find and discover in this game all of the events that gave the novel parodying the chivalric tomes of the era its charms: the giant Gargantua, of course, and his friends Gymnast and Fr&egrave;re Jean, but also the cheating Picrochole and his lieutenants.<br/><br/>Though it has its &quot;rabelaisien&quot; side, The Picrocholine Wars is a balanced game in which each camp has its own distinct strengths and during which players will have to adopt the role of both the attacker and the defender. The Picrocholine Wars combines gaming pleasure with culture and history, and is ideal for initiating new players into wargaming.<br/><br/>"}, "91738": {"rpgartist": ["(Uncredited)"], "rpg": ["Original D&D Compatible Products"], "statistics": [], "name": "The Fane of St. Toad", "rpgdesigner": ["Michael Curtis"], "rpgproducer": ["(Uncredited)"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic907965.jpg", "usersrated": "0", "rpgitemversion": ["PDF version"], "average": "0", "rpggenre": ["Fantasy"], "rpgpublisher": ["(Web published)"], "rpgcategory": ["Scenario / Adventure / Module"], "poll": [], "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic907965_t.jpg", "description": "<br/>User summary<br/><br/>The Fane of St. Toad is a self-contained dungeon sub-level that can be dropped into other dungeons.

The result is a more intense and nerve-wracking game that takes place over eight turns (from the end of March to mid-April), at least half of which are composed of three operational phases. Both players will face difficult challenges. The German player needs to re-create the historic breakthrough and has to put in every effort to reach Amiens. The Allied player has to resist succumbing to panic in the first turns in order to organize an effective defense, and then a counter-attack near the end of the game.<br/><br/>While the basic rules in Somme 18 are identical to those in Marne 1918 (with the exception of the air rules, which have been completely revised), the advanced rules will be very different. The principal reason is the length of Operation Michael, about fifteen days, which does not give an opportunity for the campaign management rules of Marne 1918 to be used.<br/><br/>So, all of the unit management tracks have disappeared and have been replaced by one table that manages the replacement and re-construction of units. Strategic movement has also been greatly simplified and adapted to the tempo of the game.<br/><br/>Somme 1918 will of course be enriched by numerous specific rules, simulating the particularities of this battle.<br/><br/><br/>     Petain&rsquo;s Reticence: Simulates the French command&rsquo;s lack of urgency in supporting their British allies.<br/>     The arrival of French reinforcements without their artillery support, allowing a quicker deployment of troops coupled with a reduction in their value.<br/>     Inter-Allied Cooperation: This will be extremely reduced at the beginning of the campaign.<br/>     Evolution of the use of Stoss: The doctrine of using assault troops had been principally introduced by General von Hutier, in Russia and Italy. At the beginning of Operation Michael, the generals commanding the Second and Seventeenth armies used their Stosstruppen in frontal assaults, wasting these elite forces and provoking fury from Ludendorff. A rule thus simulates the evolution of this doctrine.<br/>     The Doullens Conference: At the height of the German offensive, while the French Army under Petain prepared to cut its ties with the British, Haig accepted that he be placed under the command of Foch, finally creating an inter-Allied command. This rule simulates this conference, tied to German conquests. It also plays a part in obtaining victory points. In fact, this rule is really the heart of the game and we think that players will be pleased with the proposed system that will bring together the different parameters of this game.<br/><br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": ["English first edition"], "name": "Somme 1918", "playingtime": "240", "boardgamemechanic": ["Hex-and-Counter"], "age": "14", "usersrated": "63", "boardgamesubdomain": ["Wargames"], "average": "7.83651"}, "91740": {"rpgartist": ["(Uncredited)"], "rpgitemversion": ["PDF version"], "statistics": [], "name": "Eine Doppelsichel aus Elenvina", "rpgdesigner": ["Andreas Michaelis"], "rpgproducer": ["(Uncredited)"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic907970.jpg", "usersrated": "0", "average": "0", "rpggenre": ["Fantasy"], "rpgpublisher": ["Drachenland-Verlag"], "rpg": ["Das Schwarze Auge (DSA) (3rd Edition)"], "rpgcategory": ["Scenario / Adventure / Module"], "poll": [], "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic907970_t.jpg", "description": "<br/>User summary<br/><br/>Eine Doppelsichel aus Elenvina is a Das Schwarze Auge adventure that was originally published in Der letzte Held #37.

It's a typical 4X game (eXplore, eXpand, eXploit &amp; eXterminate) : players normally start with one planet. The whole 2 dimensional map is visible, but players have to fly to other planets to see what kind and quantities of raw materials and what sort of climate it has (explore). Also, other players are only visible for as far as they fly in open space within visual distance. Players quickly claim nearby planets (expand) and start mining for minerals, needed to fuel their fleet and build new ships (exploit). Players can build unarmed freighters but also a war fleet, needed to attack their fellow players (exterminate).<br/><br/>The host of the game has a wide array of possibilities to set what action earn how many victory points and what sort of scenario to play. As such, it's not possible to describe how to win the game, but in general, it's a variation of conquering other player's empires.<br/><br/>Each player has to choose one of the 21 unique races (and 4 new are mentioned on the VGA Planets 4 wiki to be under development as of Jan 2011), all of them based on Star Trek, Star Wars and Battlestar Galactica (the old &amp; new TV series - 2 different races). Names are altered, probably for copyright issues, so Darth Vader &amp;co is refered to as the Evil Empire, while the Cylons are the Robots.<br/><br/>The base game has an option for AI, but the game is meant to be a multiplayer PbeM. As such, AI is secondary.<br/><br/>In all, VGA-P4 has retained many of the features found in VGA-P3, but more and better: 30 players instead of 11, 21 playable races in stead of 11 and planetary systems much more detailed, fleet combat finally possible (in 3, all fights were 1-on-1).<br/><br/>The game can be downloaded as shareware, which is a limited version.

Some inspirations for this game include the book The Things They Carried, by Tim O&rsquo;Brien, and the movies Platoon and, to a lesser extent, Full Metal Jacket, and the game possesses the same slightly romanticized view of the war contained in these sources. The title of the game refers to O&rsquo;Brien&rsquo;s book. The soldiers he wrote about all carried something meaningful in addition to their normal gear. Here, it also means the burdens and problems that the soldiers carry, as well as the need to carry each other through the conflict<br/><br/>The requirements to play this game include: At least four players (the more the better), one of whom will be the Game Master (GM); a good amount of dice of 4, 6, 8, 10 and 12 sides; a copy of these rules; and a willingness to take the subject matter seriously - Carry will not work as a light- earted romp. Carry assumes some experience with roleplaying games in general, including a knowledge of common terms (like GM, scene, etc.)<br/><br/>All of the players other than the GM will take on the role of one soldier in a squad of U.S Marines serving in Vietnam. The squad consists of three fire teams, each of 4 soldiers and Corporal, as well as a Sergeant who leads the squad. There are a total of 16 characters to choose from. Over the course of the game, those characters that are not chosen by players will be whittled down, until only the player&rsquo;s characters are left. The game will then enter Endgame, putting each character to the test and determining their fate. The GM&rsquo;s job is to provide stressful situations for the characters that will test the limits of their ability to cope, as well as portray all characters not taken by the players.<br/><br/>"}, "91790": {"boardgamedesigner": ["Pascal Bernard"], "poll": [], "boardgamehonor": ["2009 Kinderspielexperten \"8-to-13-year-olds\" Nominee", "2009 Kinderspielexperten \"8-to-13-year-olds\" Third Place"], "name": "Steinzeit", "playingtime": "0", "minplayers": "3", "yearpublished": "2008", "usersrated": "3", "boardgamefamily": ["Animals: Dinosaurs"], "maxplayers": "6", "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic914068_t.jpg", "average": "3.66667", "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["Piatnik"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic914068.jpg", "boardgameversion": ["German first edition"], "maxplaytime": "0", "boardgamecategory": ["Card Game", "Prehistoric"], "age": "10", "minplaytime": "0", "description": "A card game in which players hunt for dinosaurs and mammoths to feed their Neanderthal crew.

Crew is similar to Capcom's Final Fight, which is an archetypal side scrolling beat-em-up game. Up to four player characters move from left to right through each level (most of which are split into 3 or more scenes), fighting with the enemy characters who appear, until they reach a confrontation with a stronger boss character at the end of the level. Once that boss is beaten, the players automatically move on to the next stage. Enemies appear from both sides of the screen and from out of doorways or entrances set into the background, and the player(s) must defeat all of them to progress. If the players try to simply travel through the levels without fighting, the screen will stop scrolling until all current enemies have been defeated, before allowing the players to continue progress. Enemies may move outside the confines of the screen, but players may not. Players will pick up a few weapons along the way, like knifes and grenades, as well as other items like some lives and &quot;MAX&quot; health points. Players also can pick up and toss enemies either toward the ground or against other enemies. Unlike Final Fight, the graphics are very detailed instead of &quot;cartoony&quot;. One unique feature is a counter that tells how many enemies a player knocked out. Another unique feature is that players also can perform dash attacks by pressing the joystick toward the left or right sides twice, while pressing the attack button during dashing.<br/><br/>"}, "91809": {"poll": [], "name": "Motocross Madness 2", "videogamemode": ["Network Multiplayer", "Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["Australian Windows edition", "English/European Windows edition", "English/European Windows Xplosiv edition", "German Windows edition", "North American Windows edition"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3231122.png", "videogameseries": ["MX vs. ATV"], "videogametheme": ["Driving"], "usersrated": "3", "videogamedeveloper": ["Rainbow Studios"], "videogamegenre": ["Racing"], "videogameplatform": ["Windows"], "videogamehonor": ["2001 D.I.C.E.

It was a moderate success and was ported to the Amiga, Amstrad CPC, Atari ST, Commodore 64, Sega Master System and ZX Spectrum in the following year.<br/><br/>The game uses a basic story, which consists of a girl named Lucy being kidnapped by the evil Sorcerer Achacha, and the player's mission is to rescue her.<br/><br/>The player controls one of two bow-tie wearing cartoon ducks named Bin (blue) and Pin (red). They are Lucy's pets, and must travel through six stages set in real locations, though everything else in the game is very cartoonish, reminiscent of Tex Avery. Two players can play at once, Bin is by default player one's character, Pin player two's. Each level ends with a boss battle. After stages 2 and 4 there is a bonus round where the two ducks box until time runs out, the player with the most health will win and receive 50000 points.<br/><br/>Dynamite Dux uses only two buttons: the jump button (which is pretty self explanatory) and the attack button. The attack button allows you to punch or throw enemies in a cartoony manner. The attack button can also let you pickup and use numerous weapons including: rocks, bazookas and the game's signature weapon, bombs (hence the title). Unlike some of its contemporary side-scrollers, Dynamite Dux allows players to attack in all directions, including diagonally.<br/><br/>The game measures health unusually in that it uses a status bar located at the bottom of the screen. A players status is made up of bars of health that are color coded blue, yellow and red, which deplete when damage is taken. Along with a varied set of enemies (all oddball cartoony looking characters) each level has a number of other obstacles that can inflict damage on the player(s).<br/><br/>There are three types of power ups: Food (replenishes health), weapons (all weapons will eventually 'expire') and treasure chests (give the player(s) extra points).<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;Dynamite Dux&quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "91813": {"poll": [], "name": "Dead Connection", "videogamemode": ["Cooperative", "Local Multiplayer", "Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["NA Arcade Edition"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1554345.png", "videogametheme": ["Crime", "Detective / Mystery"], "usersrated": "0", "videogamedeveloper": ["Taito"], "videogamegenre": ["Shoot 'em Up"], "videogameplatform": ["Arcade"], "average": "0", "statistics": [], "videogamepublisher": ["Taito"], "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1554345_t.png", "description": "Source: Wikipedia, &quot;Dead Connection&quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>Dead Connection is an arcade game released by Taito in 1992.

The game has a strong Film noir vibe, shown through the appearance of the detectives and the featuring of a female protagonist.

The Asian title of the game is Mr. Do! versus Unicorns. Though marketed as a sequel to the original Mr. Do! released one year earlier, the game bears a far closer resemblance to Space Panic. It is the second of the Mr. Do series of video games.<br/><br/>The object of Mr. Do's Castle is to score as many points as possible by collecting cherries and defeating unicorn-like monsters. The game takes place in a castle filled with platforms and ladders, some of which can be flipped from one platform to another. The player controls Mr. Do as he collects cherries by using a hammer to knock out blocks that contain them from the various platforms. Empty holes left by the knocked-out blocks serve as traps for the monsters - if a monster falls into a hole, the player can then defeat it by causing a block above the monster to fall on top of it. If the player takes too long to complete a level, the monsters transform into faster, more difficult forms that occasionally multiply. The game advances to the next level when all cherries on the level have been collected or all enemies have been defeated. The player loses a life if Mr. Do is caught by a monster, and the game ends when the player runs out of lives. The game is an excellent example of the trap-em-up genre, which also includes games like Heiankyo Alien, Lode Runner, Boomer's Adventure in Asmik World, and Space Panic.<br/><br/>As in Mr. Do!, the player can earn an extra life by collecting all of the letters from the word &quot;EXTRA&quot;. Regular monsters can be changed into monsters bearing the EXTRA letters by collecting all three keys distributed around the playfield and then picking up a magic shield from the top floor. Monsters in this state are easier to defeat than normal; a simple hammer strike will do the job. After a brief interval, they change back into their normal forms. The game also offers a bonus credit for collecting a rare diamond that may appear on the playfield at random intervals.<br/><br/>The cherry blocks are absent from Mr. Do Vs. Unicorns and early revisions of Mr. Do's Castle. Instead, blocks that are not keys or skulls at the start of a stage will be fill blocks (those left behind when unicorns fall into holes and are left alone for a time). Because of this, there are only three ways to complete a level in this version, versus the four ways to complete levels in Mr. Do's Castle. In addition, in these early revisions, the fill blocks change colors every two stages.<br/><br/>"}, "91823": {"poll": [], "name": "Dog Fight", "videogamemode": ["Hotseat", "Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["NA Arcade edition"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1554367.png", "videogametheme": ["Flight", "War - Modern"], "usersrated": "1", "videogamedeveloper": ["Thunderhead Games"], "videogamegenre": ["Shooter"], "videogameplatform": ["Arcade"], "average": "7", "statistics": [], "videogamepublisher": ["Thunderhead Games"], "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1554367_t.png", "description": "User Summary<br/><br/>An air combat game with controls very similar to Time Pilot; this has a simplified theme, fighting only modern aircraft.

One of the unique aspects of Double Dragon is the lack of specific punch and kick buttons like most fighting games. Instead, there are four attack buttons of varying strength and speed, which can perform punches or kicks depending on the character's position. The player's character and his opponent have a super move meter called the &quot;charge meter&quot;, which is overlaid on the character's remaining health.

But each character (Quaid, Sonia, Ian, and Rob) also rides a dragon, which can be dismounted and be used as a weapon itself. The dismounted dragon initially acts as a piercing weapon, and then remains stationary shooting until the player calls it back using the same button.

In Bright Got 'Em you outsmart and corner your opponents through savvy card play, sly movement, and clever placement of blocking walls. In the still-casual, but even-trickier Brainy Got 'Em! you toss aside card actions in favor of a purely strategic challenge.<br/><br/>Both games share the same goal, the same exciting intrigue, and the same social fun. <br/>Place walls to trap your opponents' pawns before they trap yours!<br/><br/>Surround yourself with friends and family. Get ready to enjoy mroe fun than any four walls could ever contain! It's time you Got 'Em!<br/>Play Summary:<br/>The goal: trap your opponents' pawns before they trap yours. Last pawn free wins!<br/><br/>Bright Got 'Em! (use colored side of the board)<br/>In Bright Got 'Em!, each player starts with 3 cards and pawn. Place your pawn on the same-colored start square (one of the four squares at the corners of the board's center square). The player who's birthday is closest, goes first.<br/><br/>On your turn you will play a card, following each rule in the order they appear. Most cards have 2 instructions. The first tells you where you can place a wall and the second how many square you can move your pawn.<br/><br/>Wall Placement Rules:<br/>Walls can only be placed along one edge of a square, between two squares.<br/>When a player's pawn is trapped by walls in a single square, that player is eliminated from the game. The edge of the board counts as a wall.<br/>There are a few cards that allow you to remove a wall or pass through a wall. However, you have to play these cards before your pawn is trapped! <br/>Once your pawn is trapped in a single square, you're out and your pawn is removed from the board.<br/>When you trap another player's pawn, thus eliminating him from the game, you may remove any 1 wall from the board.<br/><br/>Moving Your Pawn<br/>Most cards allow you to move your pawn up to a specific number of squares.<br/>You can't move through walls, unless you play a card that allows it.<br/>You can't move through a square occupied by another pawn.<br/>You may only move orthogonally, never diagonally.<br/>You can stay where you are.<br/>You don't have to move the exact number of squares listed on the card. You can move fewer squares if you want.<br/>You can move zig zag, first in one direction, then in another, just not diagonally up to the number of squares specified on the card you played.<br/><br/>After placing a wall and moving (or not), discard the card you played and draw another. (You should always have 3 cards in your hand.) Play passes to the player on your left.<br/><br/>The last player to have a pawn on the board wins!<br/><br/>Brainy Got 'Em! (use white side of board)<br/>You don't need any cards for this version. The goal is the same: trap your opponents' pawns while illuding capture yourself.<br/><br/>On your turn, place a wall anywhere on the board, then move your pawn.<br/>The number of squares you can move your pawn is equal to 1 plus the number of walls on your square. You may place a wall on the square your pawn occupies to increase your pawn's movement on the same turn.<br/><br/>All other rules are the same as Bright Got 'Em!<br/><br/>Contents: 1 double-sided game board (Bright Got 'Em! on one side, Brainy Got 'Em! on the other), 84 wall pieces, 55 Got 'Em! cards, 4 pawns, game rules.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": ["English first edition"], "name": "Got 'Em!", "playingtime": "30", "boardgamemechanic": ["Area Control / Area Influence", "Area Enclosure", "Hand Management"], "average": "6.21216", "usersrated": "74", "age": "8", "boardgamepodcastepisode": ["Game Gab: Gen Con 2011: Ray Wehrs: Calliope Games"]}, "91832": {"image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic908441.png", "poll": [], "boardgamedesigner": ["John Bridegroom", "Tracey Kannar", "Bryan Nystul"], "statistics": [], "yearpublished": "1996", "maxplayers": "6", "boardgameartist": ["Joel Biske", "John Bridegroom", "Doug Chaffee", "James Nelson"], "boardgamepublisher": ["Fanpro", "FASA"], "maxplaytime": "120", "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic908441_t.png", "minplaytime": "120", "boardgamecategory": ["Expansion for Base-game", "Miniatures", "Science Fiction", "Wargame"], "description": "From the back of the book:<br/><br/>&quot;The years since the Truce of Tukayyid have given rise to a new breed of war machines.

We think it still works great in this respect. Character creation is fast, the setting and tone are familiar to any sci-fi fan, and missions seem to write themselves.

During the course of the fabula, the personae will be exposed to various aspects of the Imperium and Roman society including the legions, auxiliary cavalry, the province of Hispania Tarraconensis, veneficae, chariot racing, gold mining and the overall Roman military strategy, especially the concept of divide and conquer.<br/><br/>While the title of the fabula refers to the largest auxiliary cavalry unit stationed in Hispania Tarraconensis, many of the plot elements and personae in this fabula are based on two sources: the true story of the rebellion of Sertorius in 674 AUC (80 BC) and the Japanese film Jigokumon. Sertorius, an Equestrian military officer and onetime mercenary leader in Mauretania, took command of Hispania by invitation of the Lusitani and anti-Sullan Roman exiles. Successive military defeats lost him the confidence of his followers and he was finally assassinated. Jigokumon or &ldquo;Gate of Hell&rdquo; is set in 12th century Japan and tells the story of a samurai, Moritoh, who falls in love with a married woman. If (or once) you have seen the film, you will notice certain similarities with Bis Torquata, such as escorting a carriage from a burning fortress, the betrayal of a brother and a staged horse race.<br/><br/>"}, "91878": {"rpgartist": ["Paul Bonner", "Jaros\u0142aw Musia\u0142", "Monika \u015awietlik", "Daros\u0142aw J.

Each of the two players can assume the roles of one of the four Chinese generals riding on horseback from the Three Kingdoms period in an attempt to smash the rebellion.<br/><br/>The players' goal is to wipe out the Huang Ching, the organization responsible for the unrest of the Han Dynasty, and up to two players can fight side by side to accomplish this goal.

In the arcade version, inserting more coins increases the maximum life of the player. In an RPG style, completing stages and collecting yellow orbs increase the experience points of the player in order to level-up, where he gains more vitality and use stronger weapons. These weapons are upgraded for every 3rd blue orb collected. In-game treasure increases player score, and food packs replenish vitality.<br/><br/>There are 4 selectable characters, each with their own varying amounts of attack power and initial vitality.

It was released by Atari Games in 1985 as a conversion kit for the original game. As in Star Wars, the player takes the role of Luke Skywalker in a set of familiar battle sequences in a first-person perspective. Specifically, the arcade features the Battle of Hoth and the subsequent escape of the Millennium Falcon through an asteroid field.<br/><br/>The game takes the original gameplay, graphics, sounds, from the first arcade game and updates them to fit the new movie. Vector objects are now much more noticeably detailed, and the asterisk-particle shots from Star Wars (arcade game) are replaced with vector versions. The game was the third Star Wars arcade game; Return of the Jedi came out the previous year.<br/><br/>The main deviation from the first arcade game is the introduction of the &quot;JEDI&quot; bonus. If the player collects the letters of the word, all enemy shots will be instantly eliminated for a short time period and the player will receive military-style stripes next to their name if they make it to the high score list.<br/><br/>During the Battle of Hoth sequences, the player is flying a Rebel snowspeeder. The first section has the player patrolling Hoth in a search and destroy mission for Probots (Imperial Probe Droids). Imperial transmissions emanating from the Probots can be shot to prolong the stage. Once the transmission does end up fully transmitted, the player advances. To earn a Jedi letter, the player must eradicate the specified number of probots.<br/><br/>The second snowspeeder sequence involves the assault of AT-AT and AT-ST walkers against the Rebel shield generator. The walkers have to be either destroyed or avoided, as collisions will damage the aircraft. The player has four tow-cables which can be used to take down the AT-AT walkers instantly if fired at the walker's legs. Otherwise, the player has to aim for the red cockpits in order to destroy the walkers. To earn a Jedi letter, the player must eradicate the specified number of walkers.<br/><br/>The second half of the player takes the role of Han Solo piloting at the head of a convoy trying to escape the Imperial onslaught. First, the player encounters a swath of TIE fighters. To earn a Jedi letter, the player must eradicate the specified number of TIE fighters.

The object of the game is to eat an ice cream cone located on the opposite side of an open playfield. The ice cream is slowly melting, and must be consumed before it melts completely. Standing between Charley and the ice cream are four chefs, named Oscar, Angelo, Jacques, and Zorba. The chefs appear from holes in the floor of the level and will chase after Charley. The chefs are identified by the shape of their toques: Oscar's is big and round; Angelo's is short and rectangular; Jacques' is curved; and Zorba's is tall and slender.<br/><br/>Scattered throughout the level are piles of food, such as pies, peas and bananas. Both the player and the chefs can grab food from the piles to throw at each other. The supplies of most foods are limited, but watermelon, which appears either on special levels exclusively or with other foods in later levels, is unlimited in supply. If the chefs are hit by food thrown either by the player or by other chefs, they are stunned for a few seconds. If the player is hit, a life is lost. The player also loses a life if a chef touches Charley, if Charley falls through an open hole or if the ice cream melts before it is eaten.<br/><br/>Points are scored for each chef hit by food thrown by the player (up to 1000 points each), luring a chef over an open hole and for each remaining pile of food on the level. The ice cream is worth 500 points multiplied by the level number, up to a maximum of 25,000 points from level 50 onwards to the last regular level, level 125.

The game was produced by Team Dogyan developers in Japan, and originally released in the arcades by Taito Corporation in 1990. Euro Football Champ and Hat Trick Hero are versions of this game with minor variations.<br/><br/>The player must first choose one of eight national football teams, followed by a star player from a choice of four available for each team. In the game a win is needed to progress to the next game. A draw will end as a 'game over', with no option for penalties, but a chance to continue by restarting the game in which a win was not achieved. Each opposition team is chosen according to a tier strategy, with the player's team removed:<br/><br/>1. Spain and France.<br/>2. Netherlands and Brazil.<br/>3. England and Italy.<br/>4. Argentina and Germany.<br/>Thus, playing with Germany, the first two games will be Spain or France in some order, the second two games will be Netherlands in Brazil in some order, the third two games will be England and Italy in some order, and the seventh game will be Argentina. The game is completed when all seven other teams have been beaten. The level of difficulty increases the further you progress. In addition, the game notices when individual team players score a hat trick. Scoring hat tricks has the effect of increasing the difficulty as well.<br/><br/>The game gained some notoriety for giving you the ability to use violence (including punches, flying kicks and shirt pulling). You could get away with this without giving away a free kick as long as the referee was either far enough or knocked onto the floor. The referee punishes every foul with a yellow card. Red cards occur at the third, seventh, and eleventh fouls, although every so often the game appears to miscount. No fourth red card is given by the referee. Besides the rough play, the game introduced the super shot, which occurs with 30 seconds remaining or less and when the score is tied or the player is losing by 1 goal. The star player chosen kicks a shot that pushes the goalkeeper into the stands.<br/><br/>The original eight national teams in the game are:<br/><br/>Argentina<br/>Brazil<br/>England<br/>France<br/>Germany<br/>Italy<br/>Netherlands<br/>Spain<br/>Some versions of the game use Japan and USA (e.g.: Hat Trick Hero) instead of Spain and France (e.g.: Euro Football Champ).<br/><br/>"}, "91917": {"poll": [], "name": "Gaia Crusaders", "videogamemode": ["Cooperative", "Local Multiplayer", "Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["NA Arcade edition"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1554522.png", "videogametheme": ["Martial Arts"], "usersrated": "0", "videogamedeveloper": ["Noise Factory"], "videogamegenre": ["Beat 'em Up"], "videogameplatform": ["Arcade"], "average": "0", "statistics": [], "videogamepublisher": ["Noise Factory"], "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1554522_t.png", "description": "User Summary<br/><br/>A horizontal fighter cooperative game.

Qu&eacute;bec introduces a unique and addictive majority rule. The player with the majority in a zone cascades half of his workers by moving them to the next zone. Workers moved in this way allow a player to score even more points. If a player still has the majority in the next zone, his workers cascade again &ndash; a potentially devastating ripple effect. This mechanism illustrates the interrelationship between the great zones of influence.

The game uses various blasters created in real life and some are created for the game that may come out as new blasters from Nerf.<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;Nerf N-Strike&quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "91995": {"boardgamedesigner": ["(Uncredited)"], "average": "5.53333", "poll": [], "name": "Pass the Bomb Card Game", "playingtime": "30", "minplayers": "2", "yearpublished": "2010", "usersrated": "15", "boardgamefamily": ["Pass the Bomb"], "maxplayers": "5", "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic973067_t.png", "boardgameartist": ["(Uncredited)"], "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["Asmodee", "Gibsons Games", "Piatnik"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic973067.png", "boardgameversion": ["French edition", "Gibsons first edition", "Piatnik English edition", "Piatnik first edition"], "maxplaytime": "30", "boardgamecategory": ["Party Game", "Trivia"], "age": "8", "minplaytime": "30", "description": "The active player first flips open a card that determines a category, then a letter card.
