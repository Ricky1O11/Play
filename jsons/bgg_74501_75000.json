Empire: Total War takes the Total War franchise to the eighteenth century Age of Enlightenment -- a time of political upheaval, military advancements, and radical thought, captured in stunning detail in Empire: Total War.<br/><br/>Empire: Total War introduces a host of revolutionary new features, including true 3D naval combat. For the first time in the Total War series, you will be able to intuitively command single ships or vast fleets upon seascapes rich with extraordinary water and weather effects that play a huge role in your eventual glorious success or ignominious defeat. After pummelling your enemy with cannon fire, close in to grapple their ship and prepare to board, taking control of your men as they fight hand-to-hand on the decks of these wooden behemoths.<br/><br/>In addition, Empire: Total War will see further enhancements to the Total War series&rsquo; signature 3D battles and turn-based campaign map. Real-time battles will pose new challenges with the addition of cannon and musket, challenging players to master new formations and tactics as a result of the increasing role of gunpowder within warfare. And the Campaign Map -- for many, the heart of Total War -- introduces a variety of new and upgraded elements, including new systems for Trade, Diplomacy and Espionage with agents; a refined and streamlined UI; improved Advisors; and a vastly extended scope, taking in the riches of India, the turbulence of Europe and, for the first time, the untapped potential of the United States of America.<br/><br/>"}, "74503": {"videogame": ["Empire: Total War & Napoleon \u2013 Total War \u2013 Game of the Year Edition"], "poll": [], "name": "Empire: Total War \u2013 The Warpath Campaign", "videogamemode": ["Network Multiplayer", "Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["Worldwide PC online download edition"], "average": "8", "videogametheme": ["Historical", "Military", "War - Revolutionary War"], "videogamefranchise": ["Total War"], "videogameexpansion": ["Empire: Total War"], "videogamedeveloper": ["The Creative Assembly"], "videogamegenre": ["Real Time Strategy", "Strategy"], "videogameplatform": ["Windows"], "usersrated": "6", "statistics": [], "videogamepublisher": ["SEGA Corporation"], "videogamecompilation": ["Empire: Total War & Napoleon \u2013 Total War \u2013 Game of the Year Edition"], "description": "From the game's official website:<br/><br/>A new detailed North American Campaign Map expands the Empire: Total War experience, with 5 brand new American Indian factions, new units and technologies.

One of the four cardinal directions is used to choose the pitch, and again to aim it towards low, high, inside (towards batter), or outside (away from batter).

Calculate the difference between the higher class and the inferior, divide by two the result (rounding up toward the inferior value) and take this number as a column shift from the higher value toward the inferior value (see the example below, for a clearer explanation). Now, roll 2 6-sided die on the &quot;Tries Table&quot; to see how many tries that team has scored in the match. Then, check the &quot;conversion percentage&quot; of that team and roll a percentage dice (ie. two 10-sided dice, reading one of them as &quot;tens&quot;) for each try scored: if the roll is inside the percentage value, the try is succesfully converted (add two points to team's score); otherwise, conversion kick is failed. Then, check the &quot;Three points&quot; value of the team to see how many penalty kicks/drops have been scored during the match. Roll 1 10-sided die on the correct column of the &quot;3-points Table&quot;, multiply by 3 the number obtained and add that result to the points scored by that team to reach its total for the match.

The game stars Conker the Squirrel, a Rare character who had previously appeared in other games marketed towards children, such as Diddy Kong Racing for the Nintendo 64 and Conker's Pocket Tales for the Game Boy Color. Marketed as an &quot;adult platform game&quot;, Bad Fur Day features graphic violence, sexual themes, toilet humor and several film parodies. The game received very positive critical reviews, despite its limited advertising, and earned a cult following. A remake of the game was created for the Xbox in 2005, titled Conker: Live &amp; Reloaded.<br/><br/>Single player<br/>The visuals of Conker's Bad Fur Day were highly praised by critics.In the single-player mode, the player takes on the role of Conker and plays the game in a free-roaming environment. Conker can duck and jump a high distance vertically, as well as jump at least twice his height in any direction. Conker can also spin his tail around quickly like a helicopter for a few seconds. Rather than give it an official-sounding name, as is the unofficial 'tradition' in the video game business, Conker just calls it the &quot;helicoptery tail thing&quot;. This allows him to jump a little higher, navigate in the air to accurately land, and slow his descent when far from the ground. After a few seconds, the tail slows down, and he drops and is unable to do it again until he has landed and jumped again. Besides this, he has few other physical powers. He can swim underwater for a while until he runs out of breath, jog indefinitely and not get tired, and is strong enough to push heavy round objects, which in one of the later levels are a &quot;big bourgeoisie boiler's brass bollocks&quot;.<br/><br/>Conker can eat pieces of &quot;Anti-Gravity Chocolate&quot; to regain lost health and incidentally his life bar is represented by six-square chocolate bars. In a parody of similar platformers with unexplained floating pickups throughout levels, they were originally created by the Professor, but he threw them out the castle window when he started a new project. Afterward, Conker can eat up to six of them. There are two types of chocolate; regenerative chocolate and one-time chocolate. One-time chocolate disappears after eaten, and doesn't reappear until Conker re-enters the game world. Regenerative chocolate reappears 10 seconds after being eaten. Antigravity chocolate does not provide protection against certain things, such as falls from especially high heights, being hit by spinning blades, or being dismembered in a grinder. However, it does protect against being hit with a heavy object from above, such as a large dollop of feces.<br/><br/>Conker has a limited number of lives. The ability to do this in the context of the game is explained in a cutscene the first time that Conker dies; according to the game, squirrels have as many lives as &quot;they think they can get away with,&quot; similar to cats, and the Grim Reaper is willing to grant Conker another chance if he picks up squirrel tails.<br/><br/>&quot;Context-sensitive Zones&quot; allow Conker to do things he could not normally do; he usually pulls a far-too-big thing out of his far-too-small pocket, although sometimes he turns into an anvil and slams into the ground. Zones under beer kegs can give him &quot;drunken&quot; abilities as well. For instance, he is able to stagger around and urinate on stone people and fire imps. Although most zones only work once, some can be used more than once, or even indefinitely. However, most of the context zones lose their purpose after being utilized, even if they are continuously usable. These context-sensitive areas usually take the form of &quot;B-button pads&quot;, and sometimes activate while Conker is in mid-air. However, they are always activated by a press of the B button. A light bulb appears over Conker's head when he is in a context-sensitive zone.<br/><br/>Much of the gameplay in Conker's Bad Fur Day features parodies of various movies and games, such as Reservoir Dogs and Super Mario 64.<br/><br/>The game has a lot of strong language in it, but only censors a few words, with the subtitles of the speech containing the word being flashing symbols in red, blue, and green, like skulls, spirals, lightning, and stars. More words are censored in the Xbox remake.<br/><br/>Multiplayer<br/>Conker's Bad Fur Day has a multiplayer option as well, featuring seven different minigames: Beach, Raptor, Heist, Death Match, War, Tank, and Race. It also has eight different levels, one for each mode. Health is measured in chocolates just as in the single player mode.<br/><br/>Beach: The player controls either the Frenchies or the Tediz. As the Frenchies, the player must guide a french refugee up through the beach and into a waiting escape vehicle without getting killed by the Tediz. The Tediz fire down on the Frenchies from three different fixed positions located above the escape vehicles, utilizing either a sniper rifle, a bazooka, or a mounted machine gun in order to prevent the refugee's evacuation. The Frenchies are unarmed, but can retaliate by setting off a detonator switch, blowing up the Tediz who are preventing their escape and giving them a window of time to make the beach run uncontested. Though in any case, as the Sergeant, who has gotten the Frenchies to the beach, warns in the intro cutscene, within several seconds, if one of the Frenchies does not get killed by the Tediz or escape, they will be instantly killed by an off-map laser weapon, thus forcing Frenchies to move quickly and not wait too long. Frenchies score points both for kills(with the detonator) and by escaping, while Tediz score by killing Frenchies. <br/>Raptor: This involves up to two players playing as Velociraptors who are trying to feed a baby dinosaur, while the cavemen want to steal the eggs for breakfast. Both teams score points for kills, but Cavemen get extra points for returning the eggs to their frying pan. Raptors may also gain extra points by feeding swallowed cavemen to their baby. The cavemen team is much larger, as the raptors are far more capable in combat. <br/>Heist : This involves a parody of Reservoir Dogs in the intro. Four teams (either two per team or one player each, depending on how the game is set up)--Red, Blue, Green, and Yellow all take place in the robbing of the Feral Reserve Bank. The objective is to retrieve cash bags from the center of the level and run it all the way back to their corresponding vault without being damaged (in which case they lose the bag and it returns to the center). <br/>War: War can either be a large Team Death-match or Capture the Flag with all of the game's weapons scattered between each level. Each level has two bases, a large field between them, each with multiple access points and places for different tactics for example sewers where a gas canister can be planted to kill all unprotected soldiers in Total War (Death-match) or Sniper Towers. <br/>Tank: Players all spawn in their own bunker and go around a large canyon with optional, pickup upgrades and battle to the death. Players have the option of also grabbing a gas canister, much like in War, and returning to their bunker where they are protected. <br/>Race: It is simply the multiplayer version of a minigame within Single Player. Here, players must go around a volcano with their hoverboards. They can attack other players and, if not careful, crash into walls and die. The first one to make a certain amount of laps, determined before the start of the game, or is the last man standing, wins. <br/>Deathmatch: The deathmatch has all of the multiplayer maps available to play in, except for the ones used in Beach, Tank, and Race. Players may select their own characters, with some characters available only after entering cheat codes. <br/>&quot;<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;Conker's_Bad_Fur_Day,&quot; available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "74550": {"poll": [], "name": "Conker: Live and Reloaded", "videogamemode": ["Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["English/European Xbox edition", "JP Xbox Edition", "NA Xbox Edition"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic917284.jpg", "videogameseries": ["Conker the Sqiurrel"], "videogametheme": ["Adult / Mature", "Cartoon"], "usersrated": "9", "videogamedeveloper": ["Rare"], "videogamegenre": ["Action", "Adventure"], "videogameplatform": ["Xbox"], "average": "6.94444", "statistics": [], "videogamepublisher": ["Microsoft Game Studios"], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic917284_t.jpg", "description": "&quot;A remake of Conker's Bad Fur Day titled Conker: Live &amp; Reloaded was released in 2005 for the Xbox console.

Unlike Bad Fur Day, Live &amp; Reloaded was also released in Japan.<br/><br/>Multiplayer<br/>The multiplayer in Live &amp; Reloaded uses the same third-person perspective as the single player game. Multiplayer consists of different game modes such as Capture the Flag or the standard Deathmatch modes. The player may participate as a member of the SHC or the Tediz. As well as a choice of soldier, the game has a choice of &quot;classes&quot; which significantly affect play style.<br/><br/>Each class has its own special equipment, special abilities, and physical capabilities; each class being designed for a distinct purpose. They are also designed to have advantages against certain classes while being vulnerable to others. For example, the Thermophile's flamethrower inflicts extreme damage on Sneakers and Long Rangers, who have less health, but is virtually useless against the high-vitality Demolisher. Each class comes equipped with a primary weapon with unlimited ammunition, (although reloading of the weapon is still required), a limited stock of grenades, and at least one special ability. Scattered throughout the arenas are yellow Upgrade Orbs, which grant a player more equipment and abilities when obtained. A player loses his upgrade orb upon death, allowing another player to obtain it.&quot;<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;Conker:_Live_&amp;_Reloaded,&quot; available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "74551": {"poll": [], "name": "Tenchu: Stealth Assassins", "videogamemode": ["Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["EN/EU PlayStation edition", "Japanese PlayStation Version", "US PlayStation Version"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic784773.jpg", "videogameseries": ["Tenchu"], "videogametheme": ["Yakuza / Samurai"], "videogamegenre": ["Stealth"], "usersrated": "46", "videogamedeveloper": ["Acquire"], "videogamefranchise": ["Greatest Hits (Best Selling PlayStation Games, US)"], "videogameplatform": ["PlayStation"], "videogamehonor": ["1999 D.I.C.E.

In all three views the controls can be changed to be primarily mouse focused or a combined keyboard and mouse approach.<br/><br/>The combat system in The Witcher represents a departure from most RPGs. Players choose one of three fighting styles. The quick style allows for faster, less-damaging attacks with a greater chance of hitting faster enemies; the heavy style deals more damage in exchange for a slow attack speed, and a lower chance to hit faster enemies; and the group style features sweeping attacks best used if Geralt is surrounded.[10] The player can switch between the styles at any point. Both of Geralt's main swords also have distinctively different combat styles from other weaponry, and serve very distinct purposes. The steel blade is used to fight humans and other flesh-and-blood beings, while the silver sword is more effective against supernatural monsters and beasts (against some of which steel may have no effect whatsoever). The player can, with precise timing, link Geralt's attacks into combos to more effectively damage enemies.<br/><br/>Alchemy is a major part of gameplay. The player can create potions that increase health or endurance regeneration, allow Geralt to see in the dark, or provide other beneficial effects. The recipes for these potions can be learned through scrolls, or by experimentation. Once the player creates an unknown potion he can choose to drink it, but if the potion is a failure it will poison or have other harmful effects on Geralt. Each time Geralt drinks potions they increase the toxicity level of his body. This can be reduced by drinking a special potion or by meditating at an inn or fireplace. In addition to potions, the player can also create oils used to augment the damage done by weapons, or bombs as weapons in combat. Neither can be created until talent points have been allocated into the corresponding skills.<br/><br/>A time delayed decision-consequence system means that the repercussions of players' decisions will make themselves apparent in plot devices in later acts of the game. This prompts the players to put more critical thinking into making each decision, and circumvents a save-reload approach to decision making. It also allows the game to have a unique approach to replay value, as the consequences resulting from the player's decisions can lead to great difference in the events that take place later, and ultimately a very different gameplay experience than in prior play-throughs.<br/><br/>The nature of the options faced when playing the game rarely falls into the typical black-and-white morality present in most computer RPGs, and the players often find themselves choosing from the lesser of two evils rather than making a clear choice between good and evil, a situation more reflective of real life morality.<br/><br/>The Witcher is powered by a heavily modified version of the Aurora Engine by BioWare, enhanced for a single-player experience. A number of changes have been introduced to the original engine; some of them are described below.<br/><br/>One of the most important features of the Aurora Engine is that the world is designed exactly as the developers envisioned, rather than using a tile-based system. All the environments are developed in 3ds Max and then exported into the game engine. As a result, developers can create unique game worlds, rather than recycling the same tiled objects over and over again. CD Projekt's version of the engine supports lightmaps generated in 3ds Max. Shadows generated this way are reported to look more realistic, and provide better game performance.<br/><br/>The modified engine also includes texture paint, a special tool that allows the developer to paint the environment using custom textures. This enables the developer to make the game world truly unique. New realistic skyboxes and water effects designed specifically for The Witcher were added to the engine. The natural light during various phases of the day is realistically altered, and the day and night transitions serve to enrich the game's ambience. The weather can dynamically change from a light drizzle to a dark, stormy downpour accompanied by thunder and lightning.<br/><br/>All the in-game and tool set rendering is done using DirectX 9, and the engine now supports many different shaders (water effect, bump mapping, environment mapping, etc).<br/><br/>Other important changes include motion-captured animation, improved physics modelling, new mechanics and combat system. Additional modifications include the introduction of portals and the inclusion of additional graphical effects (glows, advanced dynamic shadows, blurs, etc.)<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;The_Witcher_(video_game),&quot; available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "74563": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic815216.jpg", "videogametheme": ["Horror", "Zombies"], "videogamefranchise": ["Greatest Hits (Best Selling PlayStation Games, US)", "Resident Evil"], "videogameplatform": ["GameCube", "PlayStation 2", "PlayStation 3", "Sega Dreamcast", "Xbox 360"], "poll": [], "videogamecompilation": ["Resident Evil 6: Archives"], "statistics": [], "videogamemode": ["Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["EN/IT/ES PlayStation 2 edition", "Japanese Dreamcast edition", "North American PlayStation 2 edition", "North American PlayStation 2 Greatest Hits edition", "PSN PlayStation 3 Downloadable edition", "US Dreamcast edition", "XBLA Xbox 360 Downloadable edition"], "videogamecharacter": ["Chris Redfield", "Claire Redfield", "Steve Burnside"], "vgcharacterversion": ["Chris Redfield", "Claire Redfield", "Steve Burnside"], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic815216_t.jpg", "videogame": ["Resident Evil 6: Archives"], "description": "[User summary]<br/><br/>Claire Redfield returns to the zombie infested Raccoon City to search for her brother Chris.

The game was ported to the Sega Dreamcast (in Japan only) and the PlayStation 2 in 2001. The stand-alone PlayStation 2 version of the game was released in North America in a two-in-one bundle with its immediate sequel, The King of Fighters 2001.

The game now has an Active Striker System, which allows the player to summon the Striker member during any situation, whether the player is attacking or being attacked by the opponent, allowing the player to use their strikers in combos. Additionally, the player can now replenish Strike Bombs by taunting the opponent (at the expense of one filled stock of the Power Gauge).<br/><br/>The player now has two choices after selecting the Striker member of the team. The player can choose to use the regular character or an alternate character officially known as Another Striker, a character used exclusively for striker attacks. These alternate Strikers are characters from previous KOF games and other SNK franchises (such as Fio Germi from Metal Slug 2 and Duke Edwards from Burning Fight), as well as alternate versions of characters in the game such as Iori and Robert. There's also another set of alternate Striker characters known as Maniac Strikers, which are selected in the arcade version by inputting a specific codes for each. The console versions includes additional Maniac Strikers by completing a certain number of matches in the &quot;Party Mode&quot;.&quot;<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;The_King_of_Fighters_2000,&quot; available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "74574": {"videogame": ["Sega Smash Pack: Volume 1"], "poll": [], "name": "Virtua Cop 2", "videogamemode": ["Local Multiplayer", "Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["Japanese Dreamcast edition", "Virtua Cop 2"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic830570.jpg", "videogameseries": ["Virtua Cop"], "videogametheme": ["Crime"], "usersrated": "14", "videogamedeveloper": ["SEGA-AM2 Co.

Instead of a strict &quot;three fighters and one striker&quot; format, this installment introduces the Tactical Order System, which allows the player to select which characters will they control in combat and which characters will serve as strikers. Before each match, the player can form a team configuration of four fighters and no strikers, to one fighter and three strikers. The number of strikers in one's team will affect the length and number of stocks of the player's Power Gauge. Teams with no strikers will have a longer Power Gauge to fill and can carry only one stock, while a team with only one fighter and three strikers will fill their Power Gauge quicker and carry up to four stocks. One stock can be used to summon a striker, perform a guard or super cancel, a blow-away attack, or a Super Special Move. MAX-level Super Special Moves requires two stocks to perform. Players can now cancel an attack into a Striker Summon with use of a Cancel Striker, while some characters now have Wire Whip techniques which will send an opponent flying into the air and arrive at the other side of the fighting area.&quot;<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;The_King_of_Fighters_2001,&quot; available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "74577": {"poll": [], "name": "Rayman 2: The Great Escape", "videogamemode": ["Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["Australian Nintendo 3DS edition", "Dutch/French Windows edition", "English/European Nintendo 3DS edition", "European Nintendo DS edition", "European PlayStation edition", "European PlayStation Edition", "France Windows edition", "German Windows edition", "iPhone edition", "Japanese Dreamcast edition", "North American N64 Edition", "North American Nintendo 3DS edition", "North American Nintendo DS edition", "North American PlayStation edition", "PSN PSOne Classics edition", "US Dreamcast edition", "US Windows edition"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic761775.jpg", "videogameseries": ["Rayman"], "videogametheme": ["Cute Fantasy"], "videogamefranchise": ["Platinum Range (Best Selling PlayStation Games, PAL)", "Player's Choice (Best Selling Nintendo Games, US & EU)", "Rayman"], "videogamecharacter": ["Rayman"], "usersrated": "34", "videogamedeveloper": ["Gameloft", "Ubisoft Entertainment S.A.

It features a total of 6 programmable command buttons, 2 zoom buttons, 3 shift buttons, a macro record button and a 3-point configuration switch. The device also has three movement axes; X, Y and Z (rotation). Through extensive configuration of the shift and command buttons, it is possible to create a total of 24 different commands per configuration.<br/><br/>The Strategic Commander is a highly ergonomic device, and resembles a large mouse in shape, contoured for the left hand. It has an upper section attached to a base. On the upper section, the programmable buttons mentioned above are located near the tips of the pointer, middle and ring fingers for quick access. Three buttons are located near the thumb in an arc.<br/><br/>A feature of the device is that the upper section is also a 2-axis motion controller with additional support for rotation. It allows motion in the X, Y &amp; Z axis (corresponding to Forward, Backwards, Strafe left &amp; right, Turn left &amp; right). This made it an ideal companion for FPS and similar games; because you can aim weapons or look up and down with the right hand while simultaneously slewing position with the left hand, and change weapons etc. with the left finger buttons.<br/><br/>Software was included for the device to provide hotkeys for a number of (then popular) games. The buttons are also programmable, allowing the device to be used with other games and applications. For example, one interesting application developed at Carnegie Mellon used the device as a peripheral for navigating massive social network maps.<br/><br/>Linux treats this device as a joystick (with all 3 axis and 12 plus 3 buttons) and can be used as one or using various applets can be used as a &quot;joystick action to key press&quot; device (e.g. Joy2Key)<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;Microsoft SideWinder&quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "74612": {"rpgdesigner": ["Coleman Charlton", "Monte Cook", "John W.

Hundreds of John Wayne look-alikes roam the land, doling out justice according to their own morals, bandits are regularly repelled from trains and coaches carrying gold or expensive hostages. Somewhere out there three ex-Actors in bright black and white costumes strut across the landscape, cutting through great swathes of evil despite the odds.<br/><br/>This is the mindscape of the West. Australia had its Dreamtime, England had its legends of the fey, all legends which still echo in the minds of their nations, no matter how little the people of the nation may know it.<br/><br/>America had The West. Its greatest legends were born under the hot sun and over the dry dust of Hollywood film sets, but that does not matter, they are still legends, even if the sunset that the hero rides off into are fake, the people who watch those films believe, and they have carried the legends along with them. Everyone from Wyatt Earp to Calamity Jane, musicals, films, plays, stories, comics, everything that has gone together to make the romance and allure of the old west.<br/><br/>The Lone Ranger still rides Silver somewhere out in that limitless desert. There's even a giant mechanical spider wandering around somewhere out there, with the first two Secret Service agents standing on top. Dusty wanderers appear to save villages, and then to disappear once again into the sunet.<br/><br/>But it is modern day, the great wilderness is conquered. The wild indians and the cowboys are no more, they are no longer needed. Oh, children still play the games, people still watch the films, still tell the stories, but to all but a special few it is no longer real. Only those few who truly want those days back and know how to look for the world they desire, only those willing to sacrifice their past to the quest for it. And for those few, the West is patiently waiting.<br/><br/>After all, even legends need reinventing sometime, and it cannot be long before America needs its myths once again.

The fabric of space and time distort around it, a miracle of technology, possessed by few, and understood by fewer still. Inside, a man paces, bothered by an unidentifiable something. In a previous century, they might have called it &quot;conscience,&quot; but for Herr Grodz, &quot;conscience&quot; was an unfamiliar word. He was a cyborg, created to carry out the will of the Galactic Grand Emperor, and no force in this universe or any other, could stop him from doing his duty.<br/><br/>The planet of Clymexia was a peaceful world. Its people were primarily farmers and simple craftsmen. They obeyed the law, paid their taxes, and saluted the Emperor. Unfortunately for them, that wasn't enough. His Most High Celestial Eminence demanded absolute loyalty, and when the citizens of Clymexia refused to be relocated to another sector to make way for the Transdimensional Conduit, they ceased to have any value to the Empire. Herr Grodz would do his duty. He would eliminate them.<br/><br/>Dynamos deep within the bowels of the ship whirred to life. Driven by a fusion reaction, they would generate the massive amounts of electrical power necessary to activate the Oblititron. The citizens of Clymexia had precisely six minutes to live.<br/><br/>Time passes; T-minus 3:00. The generators thrum with an ominous power. More time passes; T-minus 1:30. Herr Grodz's aural filter kicks in, protecting him from the deafening noise coming from the ship's reactors. The sensor's tiny alarm was lost under the shrieking wail of the charging Oblititron, but its blinking red light was not. Some object, within one AU, was generating a chronetheric field. That could mean only one thing: company.<br/><br/>At that moment, T-minus 0:45, the Behemoth class starship shook and rattled. It didn't feel like a collision. It felt more like the ship's walls were collapsing from within. Herr Grodz spun around, and was stopped cold in his tracks. Somehow, the intruders have managed to materialize their ship in the middle of his bridge. With one well-aimed shot from his lazon pistol, the be-Stetsoned creature blasted the main control panel to smithereens. Then, with a tip of his hat, he stepped back into his improbably placed ship and vanished for parts unknown.<br/><br/>Deprived of control protocols, the Oblititron's dynamos took on a new sound. It was a sound all aboard recognized from their training. The generators have entered overload...<br/><br/>Meanwhile, the grateful citizens of Clymexia waited to welcome their savior, but for Duke Starseed, the deed was thanks enough.<br/><br/>Welcome to the world of Mutant Space Cowboys, where saving planets is all in a day's work.

The Empire once stretched out across a massive continent, from sea to sea. The Emperor ruled his distant provinces from behind the thick walls of the Imperial City, never venturing outside. But that was long, long ago. Now the Imperial City and a few hundred square miles surrounding it are all that&rsquo;s left. But though the glory of the Empire has faded, its importance has not. The Imperial City is home to a number of artisans and crafters who possess the knowledge and the skill to build the amazing clockwork devices that are common in the Imperial City but command a king's ransom in the outside world. Thus, the Imperial continues to hold itself above nations many times its size and power.<br/><br/>Why are you here?<br/><br/>The Imperial City is a place of fabulous riches and technical marvels. The standard of living here is better than anyplace else. So as long as people think you're a legitimate diplomat, you can live like a king!<br/><br/>What do I do?<br/><br/>Well, mostly you try and lead a life of decadent hedonism. Too bad you keep getting caught up in the intriguing of other diplomats and preventing your lie from being exposed.<br/><br/>How do I do that?<br/><br/>You're a con artist.

Just a few years passed and in Europe it simmer again!<br/><br/>At the outbreak of the war, Europe is divided into five blocks, which are: Britain and its Allies, the Russian Empire, France and its Allies, Ottoman Empire and Central Powers.<br/><br/>The game uses a modified original map of Europe, close to the state in 1914, but reflecting the development of an imaginary continent.<br/><br/>Key imaginary historical events before the war include the following:<br/><br/>Britain: In the twenties Britain got into serious conflicts with the Tsarist Russia and left the Triple Entente. From the thirties there was a gradual democratization in the colonies. Scandinavian countries see in the UK its natural protector against expanding Russia and Germany. After the riots in the Iberian Peninsula, Gibraltar outpost spreads to Andalusia and Portugal.<br/><br/>The Russian Empire: in the late twenties hit the Russian Empire its limits in far Asia. The Grand Duchy of Finland used the growing tension between Russia and Britain to escape from the Russia in early thirties. The abdication of a liberal the Tsar and the emergence new militant faction to power jump-started a new phase of armaments in Europe.<br/><br/>France: After the failed assassination in Sarajevo, it was France who saved by its diplomatic activity the European peace. In the thirties, France tried to create a large Mediterranean Union. South of the Apennine peninsula and Balkan were hit by neoislamic expansion of the Ottoman Empire and the French plan foiled. Against the traditional enemy - Germany - has France built an extensive Maginot Line.<br/><br/>Central Powers: Emperor Franz Ferdinand poured into crusty Austro-Hungarian veins new blood. In early twenties he federalized and modernized Austro-Hungary and in the thirties gradually agreed to trade and customs union with imperial Germany. The economic and military power of Central Powers long dampen expansionary ambitions of neighboring states. The Germans built along the lines with France its own line of defense - Siegfried Line.<br/><br/>The Ottoman Empire: the rapid modernization of the Ottoman Empire, launched by the world's thirst for oil, awoke southeast Europe to a new prosperity. Once Europe's sick man rallied by endless supply of black gold. In the late twenties, after a series of smaller conflicts, Ottomans returned to the southern Balkans and Islamic radicalization in the thirties dominate in large areas of northern Africa and even in southern Italy.<br/><br/>Each of the Powers thinks only of itself and just like you wants to be the best and win over all. Powers also conclude mutually beneficial agreements, lead diplomatic negotiations to form a military alliances, and so even you can not ignore this part of the game.

It is the sequel to Double Dragon, released during the previous year. A home version for the Nintendo Entertainment System was released in 1989 which differs drastically from the original arcade game. Other home versions were also released for the Genesis/Mega Drive and PC Engine.<br/><br/>Arcade version<br/>The arcade version of Double Dragon II: The Revenge begins with Marian, the heroine from the original Double Dragon, being shot to death by the leader of the Black Warriors. Once again, the player assume the role of brothers Billy and Jimmy Lee, who are now tasked with the duty of avenging Marian's death. The arcade version of the game is essentially an improved version of the original title. The biggest change in the game's controls are in the replacement of the original's punch and kick buttons with two directional-based attack buttons (Left Attack and Right Attack) similar to Renegade. Pressing the attack button of the player's current direction will do a standard series of punches, while pressing the opposite attack button will perform a back kick. A few new moves are added as well, including a Hurricane Kick.<br/><br/>Almost all of the returning enemy characters from the first game were given makeovers and new moves which they can use against the player. The weapons that can be use by the player has also been redrawn and modify from the previous game. The steel bats and dynamite sticks for example, were replaced by shovels and grenades.<br/><br/>Like in the original game, the arcade version of Double Dragon II is divided into four missions: a heliport, a lumber storehouse, a wheat field, and the new hideout of the boss. Each stage has its own boss character with his own leitmotif theme. After defeating Willy (the final boss from the original game) in the fourth stage, the player will confront a double of their own character for the game's final battle. If two players reach the end together, then both will get to face their own clone for the final battle.<br/><br/>Home versions<br/>Nintendo Entertainment System <br/>The NES version retained the 2-Player co-op feature that was missing in the first NES game.The Nintendo Entertainment System version of Double Dragon II: The Revenge was produced by Technos Japan and released in Japan on December 23, 1989. An English localization was published by Acclaim Entertainment, which was released on January 1990 in North America and later in the PAL region.<br/><br/>Much like the first game, the NES version of Double Dragon II features many drastic differences from the original arcade game. Unlike the first NES game, the game can now be played cooperatively with a second player. There are two different 2-Players Mode, A and B: the latter differs from the former, in that both players can hurt each other with their attacks. There are also three difficulty settings, which also determine the length of the game in the English version. The final mission is only available on the hardest difficulty setting.<br/><br/>While the premise is the same as the arcade version, the game now features story sequences before each stage which serves to advance the plot. The level designs are also completely different, with the NES version featuring nine missions instead of just four. Most of the enemy characters from the arcade version are featured in the NES version as well, while a few were replaced by new ones. Notably, the ninth and final mission is a battle against the &quot;Mysterious Warrior&quot;, a character introduced in the NES version who serves as the new final boss. In contrast to the arcade's bittersweet ending, the NES version features a happier ending in which Marian is brought back to life after the final opponent is defeated.<br/><br/>Mega Drive<br/>The Mega Drive version of Double Dragon II: The Revenge was released by Palsoft exclusively in Japan on December 20, 1991. Unlike the NES version, the Mega Drive version of Double Dragon II is more of a direct conversion of the original arcade game, featuring the same levels and moves, as well as almost every enemy characters. The level design for Mission 2 was slightly changed in the Mega Drive.<br/><br/>PC Engine<br/>A PC Engine version of Double Dragon II: The Revenge was also released exclusively in Japan, which was published by Naxat Soft on March 12, 1993. Released in Super CD-ROM&sup2; format, the PC Engine version is based on the NES version of the game instead of the arcade one. The story sequences from the NES version were remade and are now animated, with voice acting featuring Makoto Horikawa (as Billy), Nobutoshi Hayashi (as Jimmy), and Hiroko Emori (as Marian) among other actors.<br/><br/>There are other few slight changes to the game as well. While the gameplay is the same, the graphics have been remade completely and the soundtrack consist almost entirely of new music (with the exception of the final boss theme and the closing credits theme). Some of the levels designs have been altered and the order of Mission 4 and 5 (the Undersea Base and the Forest of Death) were switched. The PC Engine version allows the player to reach the final stage in any of the three difficulty settings, making the game closer to the Japanese Famicom version in this regard than its western NES counterpart. However, the ending changes depending on the difficulty setting, with the full ending shown only when the player completes the hardest setting.<br/><br/>Computer platforms<br/>Virgin Mastertronic released ports of the arcade version for the ZX Spectrum, Commodore 64, IBM PC, Commodore Amiga, Amstrad CPC and Atari ST in 1989. The computer ports were developed by Binary Design, the same outfit that handled the computer ports of the first game.<br/><br/>"}, "74651": {"rpgdesigner": ["'Manda Dee"], "rpg": ["Living Legends", "Villains & Vigilantes (2nd Edition)"], "statistics": [], "name": "Oil Pressure", "rpgartist": ["Jeff Dee", "'Manda Dee"], "rpgproducer": ["(Uncredited)"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic758765.jpg", "usersrated": "0", "rpgitemversion": ["PDF Version"], "average": "0", "rpggenre": ["Action / Adventure (Superheroes)"], "rpgpublisher": ["Monkey House Games"], "rpgcategory": ["Scenario / Adventure / Module"], "poll": [], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic758765_t.jpg", "description": "Publisher's Blurb:<br/><br/>&quot;This mini-adventure was very generously developed for us by game designer, Talzhemir, co-creator of the popular MMORPG Furcadia, as a free download to celebrate the return of Villains and Vigilantes.&quot; MONKEY HOUSE GAMES co-founder JACK HERMAN announced. &quot;Oil Pressure has a storyline that can very easily be worked into your V&amp;V&quot; campaign.

It is the second sequel to Double Dragon for the arcades, following Double Dragon II: The Revenge. A Nintendo Entertainment System game loosely based on the arcade version was released, along with conversions for the Genesis, Game Boy, and various computer platforms.<br/><br/>Arcade version<br/>An attract sequence from the arcade version showing three player characters fighting off against enemies.The premise of Double Dragon 3 is explained on the game's attract sequence: while returning to their home from a training trip, Billy and Jimmy Lee cross paths with a fortune teller named Hiruko. The fortune teller cryptically tells the brothers that they must collect the three &quot;Rosetta Stones&quot; scattered around the world in order to face a mysterious new adversary awaiting them in Egypt. Depending on the game's configuration, up to two or three players can play the game (similar to The Combatribes, another beat-'em-up by Technos released during the same year). As usual, the first two players take control of Billy and Jimmy in that order, while the third player assumes the role of Sonny, a yellow-clad palette swap of the Lee brothers.<br/><br/>The game uses a three-button control configuration like the previous titles, but discards the directional-based attack buttons from Double Dragon II, reverting back to the &quot;Punch&quot; and &quot;Kick&quot; setup of the first game. Most of the techniques from the first two titles are not featured in this installment such as the elbow punch and the hair pull, although new ones were added in their place such as a belly-to-back throw and a running head-butt. There are also techniques that be performed with another player character such as a back-to-back hurricane kick and a triangle jump kick. The player can also jump over fallen enemies.<br/><br/>Certain areas in the game feature weapon shops where the player can gain additional power-ups for their character such as new moves, agility, energy, and weapons, by inserting additional credits into the game. The player can also purchase new playable characters that will replace their current character when they're killed. There are at least three additional character types in addition to the default one that the player starts the game with: the Urquidez brothers, the Chin brothers, and the Oyama brothers.<br/><br/>The game is divided into five stages, each taking place in a different country: America, China, Japan, Italy, and Egypt. Each stage feature their own enemy characters that fit with the setting and motif (i.e: the enemies in Japan are swordsmen in a castle, with a ninja as the boss).<br/><br/>Regional differences<br/>The Player Select screen from the Japanese arcade version.The Japanese version of the Double Dragon 3 arcade game differs from the western release in that the player can select their character before starting the game. Players can choose between a Lee brother character or any of the other three featured character types (Urquidez, Chin, or Oyama). The weapon shops from the western release are not featured in the Japanese version, thus the two extra moves that could be purchased by the player in the western version (the hurricane kick and the one-armed headbutt) are available by default (although the hurricane kick is slightly more difficult to perform), while weapons can be found lying on the ground in certain stages (although, only the Lee brothers can use weapons).<br/><br/>Home versions<br/>Nintendo Entertainment System<br/>Screenshot of the NES version of Double Dragon III.A Nintendo Entertainment System game loosely based on the arcade game, titled Double Dragon III: The Sacred Stones (or Double Dragon III: The Rosetta Stone in Japan) was released on February 22, 1991 in Japan and North America. As with the NES version of the second game, it was published by Technos in Japan and by Acclaim Entertainment in North America and the PAL region.<br/><br/>The NES version of Double Dragon III follows the same premise as the arcade version. However, the game's script was completely rewritten for its English localization, with Billy and Jimmy being given a motive to help out Hiruko search for the Sacred Stones by having Marion (the heroine from previous games) disappear again. The final boss, originally a revived Cleopatra in the arcade and Famicom versions, is now identified as a possessed version of Marion named Queen Noiram.<br/><br/>The NES version features different gameplay than its arcade counterpart. The player can now switch characters through a sub-screen. The player starts out as Billy or Jimmy Lee, but gains two additional characters after defeating them as bosses thorough the course of the game: Chin Seimei (a Chinese martial artist) and Yagyu Ranzou (a Japanese ninja). Each character has a secondary weapon that can be used for a limited time after equipping it from the sub-menu.

The game was released in Japan in December 2002, the following month in the United States, and three months later in PAL territories. It is the fourth console game in the Panzer Dragoon series, after three such games on the Sega Saturn. Panzer Dragoon Orta was developed by Smilebit, one of Sega's second-party developers (before merging with Sega on July 1, 2004). This makes it the only Panzer Dragoon game not developed by Team Andromeda, even though Smilebit included many of Team Andromeda's former members.<br/><br/>The game focuses on a young girl, Orta, who has been held as a prisoner her entire life, before being freed by a mysterious dragon. As she rides on the dragon's back through a post-apocalyptic world, she must defend herself from the forces of an oppressive and militaristic Empire, who believe she is the harbinger of their destruction.<br/><br/>Panzer Dragoon Orta was made backward compatible with the Xbox 360 on April 19, 2007. The game was made compatible for all regions; however, there have been multiple reports that the PAL version of the game consistently crashes to the Dashboard after the full-motion video at the end of the third Episode. No fix to this problem has been made available in two subsequent backwards compatibility updates.<br/><br/>Panzer Dragoon Orta is a rail shooter: players can control the dragon's position onscreen, and may briefly slow down or speed up (the latter can be used as a potent ramming attack), but ultimately are in no control to fly about the level. Enemies must thus be defeated before they vanish offscreen as the levels &quot;scroll&quot; by (with the exception of boss battles, which take place in environments that &quot;loop&quot; until the boss is defeated).<br/><br/>Orta's dragon can morph itself instantaneously between three different forms: the Base Wing (standard class with no weaknesses or strengths), Heavy Wing (offensive class with less mobility), or Glide Wing (nimble class good for shooting down masses of incoming projectiles). Each of these forms can level up by collecting &quot;gene bases&quot; from certain enemies.<br/><br/>Attacking is performed by holding down a mappable attack button, maneuvering an onscreen cursor over enemies, and releasing the button to fire a volley of arching lasers at each target.

The game is the sequel to the successful Star Wars: Battlefront and features new vehicles, characters, game mechanics, maps, and missions. The game was released in PAL regions on October 31, 2005 on the PC, Xbox, PlayStation Portable, and PlayStation 2 platforms, and in North America on November 1 of the same year. It was later updated to be backwards-compatible for the Xbox 360. It was also released on the Playstation store on October 20, 2009 for download on the PSP.<br/><br/>Unlike its predecessor, Battlefront II features a more narrative-based campaign, retelling portions of the Star Wars storyline from the point of view of a veteran Imperial Trooper, reminiscing about his tour of duty in service of both the Galactic Republic and as part of the Galactic Empire. Gameplay additions over Battlefront include the use of Jedi and the chance to fight in space while piloting starfighters. Battlefront II was fairly well received, with the PlayStation 2 and Xbox versions scoring in the mid 80s at aggregators GameRankings and Metacritic, respectively. The PC version scored slightly lower at both sites, scoring a 76 at GameRankings and 78 at Metacritic. The PSP version was the worst received, scoring 71 at GameRankings and 69 at Metacritic. Reviewers generally praised the narrative-based story, however some felt that the upgrades from the original sequel were not enough to merit the price.<br/><br/>attlefront II is fundamentally similar to its predecessor, albeit with the addition of new gameplay mechanics, units, and vehicles. The general objective in most missions is to eliminate the enemy faction. Besides simply killing enemies, players fight for control of 'Command posts', where units respawn after death.  Most command posts can be captured, by killing nearby enemies and standing by the command post for a period of time. Controlling a majority of the command posts results in the faster depletion of enemy forces, and allows the player to respawn in more locations. If all command posts are captured, the losing team has only twenty seconds to recapture one before the game ends in their defeat, regardless of their reinforcements count.<br/><br/>There are two eras from which to choose; Galactic Civil War, or Clone Wars. Each era features two opposing factions; in the Galactic Civil War the Rebel Alliance and Galactic Empire vie for control, while the Clone Wars features the Confederacy of Independent Systems (CIS) and the Galactic Republic. While most character classes are similar to classes of the other factions, each faction has two unique classes, which are unlocked gradually.<br/><br/>Players have the ability to choose between six classes throughout the game. Four class types common to all factions are Regular Infantry, &quot;Heavy Troopers&quot;, Snipers, and Engineers. All have different specialties as well as certain weaknesses. In addition to the four standard classes, each faction has two special classes. The Confederacy of Independent Systems has the IG-100 Magnaguard and the Droideka for their special classes, the Rebels have a Wookiee Warrior and a Bothan spy, the Old Republic has a Clone Commander and a Jet Trooper, and the Empire has the near-equivalent Imperial Officer and Dark Trooper.<br/><br/>Battlefront II also features a special class referred to as &quot;heroes&quot;, which are found sporadically throughout the game. The hero each faction receives is entirely dependent on the map. In addition to having un-lockable heroes on the normal Conquest maps, there is an additional Game Mode on Mos Eisley called &quot;Assault.&quot; Much like Space Assault, each team is given a number of points to reach before the other team, but all of the Unit Classes are now the heroes. Some examples of heroes include Boba Fett, Mace Windu, Luke Skywalker and Yoda.<br/><br/>"}, "74671": {"rpgartist": ["Tim Adams", "Curtis Craddock", "Ian Dougan", "Joshua Dowdell", "Gordon Feiner", "William Jordan", "Storm Kerr", "Bill Keyes (II)", "Bryce Nakagawa", "Eric Rademaker"], "rpg": ["HERO System (6th Edition)"], "statistics": [], "name": "Kazei 5", "rpgdesigner": ["Mark Doherty", "Stephen Furlani", "Michael Surbrook", "Ross Watson"], "rpgproducer": ["Robert Dorf", "Jon Garceau", "Bill Keyes (II)", "David Tomczyk"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1027611.png", "usersrated": "2", "rpgitemversion": ["PDF Version", "Softcover Version"], "average": "9", "rpggenre": ["Action / Adventure (Superheroes)", "Animation / Comics (Anime / Manga)", "Mecha", "Occult (Psionics / Mentalism)", "Science Fiction (Cyberpunk)"], "rpgpublisher": ["BlackWyrm Publishing (BlackWyrm Games)"], "rpgcategory": ["Scenario / Adventure / Module", "Sourcebook (rules/options to enhance play)"], "poll": [], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1027611_t.png", "description": "Publisher Blurb<br/><br/>Only human is not good enough.

The game, developed by Rogue Entertainment and published by Electronic Arts, is set in the universe of Lewis Carroll's Alice's Adventures in Wonderland. Alice was designed by American McGee and features music composed by Chris Vrenna.<br/><br/>The game is based on the id Tech 3 engine first used in Quake III Arena. A PlayStation 2 port was in development but was canceled. Notably, the game's box art was altered after release to show Alice holding the Icewand instead of a bloodied vorpal sword, and to reduce the skeletal character of the Cheshire Cat's anatomy. EA cited complaints from various consumer groups as its reason for altering the original art, though McGee stated the alteration was made due to internal concerns at EA. A third version of the box art has Alice holding the Cards in her hands instead of a sword or wand.<br/>Alice has grown in value and become a collector's item since its release, with new copies selling for $100-200 on auction sites and used copies selling for close to $100. The game is prized in the order of its release artwork with the Vorpal Sword, a.k.a. &quot;bloody knife,&quot; version being highly valued, followed closely by the Ice Wand release and, finally, the comparatively innocuous Hand of Cards version.<br/><br/>Set years after Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking-Glass, the game features an older, more cynical and macabre incarnation of Alice.<br/><br/>Plot<br/>Shortly after her second adventure, Alice's house is burned down by an accidental fire, killing her family, and leaving her as the only survivor. Due to her survivor's guilt, she tries to commit suicide (bandages can be seen on her wrists), and becomes catatonic. She is institutionalized in Rutledge Asylum, where she remains insane and is consistently mistreated by the workers. Ten years later, the White Rabbit summons Alice to aid a radically altered Wonderland, which became a twisted version of itself as it came under the despotic rule of the Queen of Hearts. The Cheshire Cat serves as Alice's companion throughout the game, frequently appearing to guide her with cryptic comments.<br/><br/>Setting<br/>The game's setting presents a considerably more macabre rendition of Wonderland than seen in Lewis Carroll's original portrayal. Wonderland, being a creation of Alice's mind, has been corrupted by her insanity, which becomes the prevailing theme of the game; if Alice manages to save Wonderland, she will restore her own sanity as well.<br/><br/>The new Wonderland is composed of nine provinces. When Alice falls down the rabbit hole, she finds herself in the Village of the Doomed, the home of the Torch Gnomes. The Village of the Doomed is composed of a network of tunnels and caves, patrolled by the Queen of Hearts' card guards. Beyond the subterranean village is the Fortress of Doors, where the main attraction is a school of insane but harmless children. Within the school lies an ancient book of recipes for magic potions, as well as the ingredients for one concoction in particular which will be useful to Alice.<br/> Beyond the fortress and across a rough, uncharted landscape lies the Vale of Tears, where Alice's friends Bill McGill and the Mock Turtle reside, along with the cannibalistic Duchess. A giant river runs throughout the gloomy, mist-shrouded landscape, and another aquatic location is accessible through a well inside Bill McGill's house. The well is sealed until the Duchess is slain.<br/><br/>On the other side of the Vale of Tears lies Wonderland Woods, one of the largest regions in the game. The woods are initially filled by ponds, cliffs and jump mushrooms, but much deeper into the woods is a region of rock and magma. This section leads to several new regions including the Cave of the Oracle, the Pale Realm, the Jabberwock's Lair, and the Majestic Maze. The Cave of the Oracle is home to a wise entity that is revealed later to be the Caterpillar.<br/><br/>The Pale Realm makes a transition to the surface of a chessboard, as delving further into this area leads to the White Castle of Looking Glass Land, which is home to life-size chess pieces; the White pieces join Alice in the fight against the Red pieces, a deviation from her normally unhelpful &quot;allies&quot; from earlier portions of the game. Alice is twice transformed into a chess piece herself to pass certain obstacles.<br/><br/>Following this is a distorted version of Rutledge Asylum (where Alice has been incarcerated since her parents' tragic deaths). It is run by Tweedle Dee and Tweedle Dum and also houses the Mad Hatter's laboratory.<br/><br/>The path to the Jabberwock's Lair leads into the Land of Fire and Brimstone, a volcanic region of Wonderland and a reminder of the fire in which her family died. It is here that the terrible Jabberwock a semi-mechanized servant of the Queen of Hearts and the incarnation of Alice's guilt resides, in the remains of Alice's old home.<br/><br/>The Majestic Maze ends on the road to Queen of Hearts Land, a region heavily guarded by card guards, boojums, and other members of the Queen of Hearts' personal army.<br/><br/>Queensland is the final province of Wonderland. In it lies the Heart Palace from which the Queen of Hearts commands. Tentacles and other repulsive appendages are seen protruding from every organic wall in this area, and numerous areas even resemble body parts, giving the impression that Alice is travelling through her own body.<br/><br/>"}, "74676": {"videogame": ["Jak and Daxter Collection"], "poll": [], "name": "Jak 3", "videogamemode": ["Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["Australian PlayStation 2 edition", "English/European PlayStation 2 edition", "North American PlayStation 2 (Greatest Hits) edition", "North American PlayStation 2 edition"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic775588.jpg", "videogameseries": ["Jak and Daxter"], "videogametheme": ["War - Future"], "videogamefranchise": ["Greatest Hits (Best Selling PlayStation Games, US)", "Jak and Daxter", "Platinum Range (Best Selling PlayStation Games, PAL)"], "usersrated": "39", "videogamedeveloper": ["Naughty Dog"], "videogamegenre": ["Action Adventure", "Platform", "Shoot 'em Up"], "videogameplatform": ["PlayStation 2"], "videogamehonor": ["2005 D.I.C.E.

Jak 3 largely focuses on the Wasteland, a large desert only briefly referred to in the previous entry in the series as being completely uninhabited and inhospitable.<br/><br/>Spargus City, a large settlement within the Wasteland bordering the ocean, is where the game officially begins, and serves as a hub for the player, where new weapons and upgrades can be earned, and most missions are given out. Later on, the plot shifts focus to Haven City, a sprawling metropolis which was the central locale in Jak II, though the size of the area is only a fifth of the Wasteland.[1] Some levels from the previous game are radically altered (Haven Forest, Metropolitan area) or removed entirely (like the Arena, Bazaar,and farm district in Haven City), while others are added (New Haven City), branching off from Spargus and the Wasteland and Haven.<br/><br/>"}, "74678": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic763549.jpg", "poll": [], "boardgamedesigner": ["Han Heidema"], "statistics": [], "yearpublished": "2010", "maxplayers": "6", "age": "12", "boardgamepublisher": ["Winsome Games"], "maxplaytime": "120", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic763549_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "120", "boardgamecategory": ["Economic", "Trains"], "description": "West Riding Revisited is the result of ten years of further development of Han's original West Riding game and it plays very differently.

A Freeform game in Zoo Tycoon 2 allows you to create the zoo of your choice, the only restrictions being space, animals and objects.... In addition to Freeform mode, there is also a Campaign mode in which the player chooses a campaign to play through and is placed in the shoes of an average zoo owner and is assigned different goals to complete; these goals may include having to breed tapirs, train dolphins, rescuing abused animals and more. As well, there is a Challenge mode in which the player has a limited amount of money (although the player can choose their starting amount) with which goals must be completed.<br/><br/>"}, "74687": {"rpgartist": ["Brian Blume", "Terry Dykstra", "Larry Smith"], "statistics": [], "name": "Polyhedron (Issue 91 - Vol. 14, No. 1)", "rpgdesigner": ["Dale A.

Each map also has 2 different colored Phase Lines for smaller or larger games.<br/>-- Pirates occupy each undiscovered planet, with the player opposite of you rolling for the Pirates. This allows for a bit more interaction in the beginning of the game.<br/>-- Cheap. Besides the dice, you only need to print out a few items.

It was found that the people who had this ability to venture into the dreams of others, most often came from ordinary walks of life, but in the Dreamscape, they became warriors of extraordinary capability.<br/><br/>It was also found that there was a tendency for Dreamscapers to fall into one of 4 main classes, which became named, by Crane as follows:- Chargemaster, Dreamshaper, Dreamwarrior, and Gadgeteer. With this specialization, the Dreamscapers began to hone their abilities and found their powers to be seemingly limitless.<br/><br/>Throughout the ages descendants of the original Dreamscapers continued their battles against demons of sleep. The period of the thirty years war across Europe and the English Civil War were particularly busy for them as indeed was the time of the Salem Witch Trials across in New England.<br/><br/>After this time, however, apart from one or two minor surges of demon plagues' the call upon the Dreamscapers diminished, until at present there are no Dreamscapers. However, the descendants of the original Dreamscapers still have a sub-concious memory of their past exploits and all it needs is somebody who knows how to bring that subconscious memory to the conscious thought.<br/><br/>Demons are beginning to creep insidiously back into the dreams of 20th Century man.

Ten billion people well fed, educated, given equal representation and universally equal rights. They can visit any state in the world for a half week's salary, choose any of a thousand artists our a thousand television stations, read books on any subject imaginible, pay for classes for any skill they want to pick up, and still be able to spend time with their children. People like you -- the altered ones -- were at that time created for vanity, for pleasure, for fashion, occasionally even for medical or theraputic reasons. However, it was not common -- why spend a year's worth of income when the newest Star Wars remake was about to come out?<br/><br/>Imagine this paradise, without need or want, dead in a day.<br/><br/>Four generations ago, the early 21st century, your ancestors were in the middle of a holy war. Technology being what it was, there was no other real reason to go to war. All of the great weapons were brought out to clean out the heretics. First, they used nukes. When they ran out of nukes, they used diseases. When they ran out of diseases, they used napalm and gas. When they ran out of gas, they sent their soldiers in. And about by this time, they had more nukes and napalm and mustard gas ready to go.<br/><br/>When the nukes rained down, it was hell. While patriotic messages blared out how we were winning (as no doubt the other sides were all doing), people looted, raped, and killed. The Federal Government was reduced to a few manned satellites and a NPR station operating out of Barrow, Alaska within a matter of days.<br/><br/>Nobody was prepared (or at least, prepared enough) for the reality of what was about to happen. Nobody was prepared for actual anarchy. And that's when the utility of being half-human, half-animal became apparent. Fur kept the retrocodes warm on cold nights. Instincts showed them tactics for survival unmodified humans did not think of or could not stomach doing. And claws were better than fingernails in a fight...<br/><br/>It's now sometime in the early 22nd century.

The game was developed by Tsutomu Kouno, striving to create a game that was different than other titles being released for the PSP at the time, most being sequels of PlayStation 2 games. After demonstrating a prototype of the core gameplay to his management, Kouno was able to complete development over a course of one and a half years.<br/><br/>In LocoRoco, the player must tilt the environment by using the shoulder buttons on the PSP in order to maneuver the LocoRoco, multi-colored jelly-like characters, through each level, being aided by other odd residents while avoiding hazards and the deadly Moja Troop, to reach an end goal. Along the way, the LocoRoco can grow in size by eating special berries, and then can be split and rejoined to pass the LocoRoco through narrow spaces. The game's bright and colorful visuals and dynamic music soundtrack were hallmarks of the game, earning it several awards from the gaming press in 2006. While the game did not sell high volumes, its success led to the development of three other LocoRoco titles, two for the PSP and one for the PlayStation 3.<br/><br/>Plot<br/>Living peacefully on a faraway planet, the LocoRoco and their friends, the Mui Mui, help grow vegetation and look after nature, making the planet a pleasant place to be, playing and singing the days away. When the Moja Troop comes to the planet to take it over, the LocoRoco do not know how to fight against these invaders from outer space. As such, the player assumes the role of &quot;the planet&quot; that is capable of guiding the LocoRoco around to defeat the Moja Troop and rescue the remaining LocoRoco, returning the planet to its peaceful ways.<br/><br/>Gameplay<br/>The Yellow LocoRoco moving about the world currently tilted to the right; a berry that will increase the LocoRoco size is to the far right, while a Mui Mui figure as at the bottom. A Pickory is shown below the LocoRoco.Loco Roco is divided into 5 worlds each consisting of 8 levels. In each level, the goal is to reach the end point of the level, with the player scored on the number of LocoRoco found, the time to complete the level, and other factors. There are six varieties of LocoRoco in the game, identified by their color, appearance, and musical voice, but outside of the first &quot;Yellow&quot; one, the rest are unlocked as the player completes the level. The player can then opt which LocoRoco they want to use for a level, however, this selection has no fundamental gameplay effects and only changes the songs used. LocoRoco act as blobs of gelatin, deforming from their normally round shape when demanded by the environment. Certain beings in the world can change the default shape of the LocoRoco into other forms, such as squares or triangles, which lasts until they wash off in water or they encounter another similar being.<br/><br/>The player starts with a single LocoRoco. When this LocoRoco eats a berry, it grows by one, up to a maximum size of twenty. The single large LocoRoco may be split into individual beings by tapping a face button or through specific points on the level, while individual LocoRoco can merge back into a single being by holding down a face button. Manipulation of the LocoRoco in this manner may be necessary to guide them to the finish; while the single large LocoRoco is easier to control, small passages can only be navigated by individual LocoRoco. The player can lose LocoRoco if they are touched by harmful objects or they run into the Moja, and the player will have to restart the level if they lose all their LocoRoco. With the exception of making them jump, the player does not otherwise directly control the LocoRoco, but instead controls the planet itself, tilting the planet using the shoulder buttons. This causes the LocoRoco to roll in the direction of tilt, as well as causing certain mechanical objects such as platforms to also tilt. The player can also cause the LocoRoco to jump by holding and releasing both shoulder buttons; this not only allows the LocoRoco a way to cross gaps, but to burst through walls as well as harm the Moja without taking damage. As the player collects more Loco Roco in a level, the music gains more voices, each Loco Roco singing a part in the overall song.<br/><br/>Throughout the levels are areas that require a minimum number of LocoRoco in order to cause them to sing and wake up one of the planet's odd residents, who will then reward the player with an item for their &quot;Loco House&quot;. There are also hidden Mui Mui throughout the levels to be found. Levels also contain &quot;Pickories&quot; which can be collected by the LocoRoco and are used as a form of currency to play two mini-games outside of the main game. The mini-games are &quot;Mui Mui Crane&quot;, a variation of a crane game, and &quot;Chuppa Chuppa&quot; that use Chuppa, bird-like launchers for the LocoRoco, to navigate a long course. Both mini-games grant additional Loco House parts and Pickories as prizes. The player can use the accumulated Loco House parts to create a course that the Loco Roco will automatically navigate, with additional parts that can be collected by directing the course appropriately. A Loco Editor is also an unlockable feature in the game, creating an interactive course with a start and finish using the Loco House parts.<br/><br/>Demo versions<br/>Standard Demo<br/>Following the release of Firmware 2.7 on April 25, 2006, a downloadable demo of LocoRoco was released on the game's Japanese website and was the first Sony-sanctioned user-downloadable game for the PSP. A demo localized for western countries was released in June 2006, shortly before the game's full European release. It includes one level that will take the player around 5-15 minutes to complete, depending on the number of secret areas the player encounters.<br/><br/>Halloween Demo<br/>A special Halloween-themed demo was released for download on October 26, 2006, It featured some exclusive graphics and objects, like Jack-o-lanterns, spirits, and more. Few puzzles were implemented.<br/><br/>Christmas Demo<br/>A Christmas-themed demo was released for download on December 11, 2006. It featured some exclusive graphics like Santa's sleigh and more. A unique LocoRoco song is implemented.<br/><br/>Mobile version<br/>A mobile version of LocoRoco, LocoRoco Mobile, was created for distribution via i-mode, a wireless service in Japan in 2007. The mobile game is being ported for western countries by Gamelion, where it will be named LocoRoco Hi.<br/><br/>Sequels and spin-offs<br/>LocoRoco Cocoreccho! is a LocoRoco program for the PlayStation 3, released in September 2007 as a downloadable title through the PlayStation Store. It is described by Sony as an &quot;interactive screensaver,&quot; rather than a game. Instead of tilting the world, the game instead puts the player in control of a butterfly that will draw LocoRoco to it, guiding them to sleeping LocoRoco to wake them up and collect enough LocoRoco to progress to other parts of the single stage.<br/><br/>LocoRoco 2, a sequel to the original LocoRoco, was officially announced at the 2008 Tokyo Game Show though Phil Harrison, Sony's worldwide studios chief, revealed the game to be in developed during an interview at the 2007 D.I.C.E. Summit. The game was released worldwide between late 2008 and early 2009.<br/><br/>A third PSP LocoRoco game, LocoRoco Midnight Carnival, is a Halloween-themed spin-off title which features an enhanced bounce skill called &quot;Boing!&quot; The game was digitally released on October 29, 2009 for North American and European areas, and on November 1, 2009 in Japan for the console's launch.<br/><br/>"}, "74704": {"poll": [], "name": "Amplitude", "videogamemode": ["Local Multiplayer", "Network Multiplayer", "Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["English/UK Edition", "US Edition"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic778075.jpg", "videogameseries": ["Frequency/Amplitude"], "videogametheme": ["Music", "Science Fiction"], "usersrated": "22", "videogamedeveloper": ["Harmonix"], "videogamegenre": ["Rhythm"], "videogameplatform": ["PlayStation 2"], "videogamehonor": ["2004 D.I.C.E.

Not about vampires who seek to rescue their soul from damnation, or wish to achieve the eternal rest denied to them.<br/><br/>In this game, vampires are constantly engaged in a violent physical struggle for power, respect and security. To avoid being a beaten-up loser, you need blood. You get blood by biting women you are intimate with. 'Intimate', as in 'love'. Only for you, it's not love anymore - for you, it's ruthless exploitation. The question is: can you exploit enough women to survive?<br/><br/>Make up a vampire. He must be male, and he must have pointy teeth. The rest is up to you.<br/><br/>If you're ready, if you're serious, make yourself as a vampire. (Unless you are a woman. In which case, make your identical twin brother as a vampire.) But if you're not ready, I won't hold it against you.<br/><br/>Then, make up an environment. There must be other vampires, ready to fight you over something. What is that something? Power? Prestige? The favour of the King? The right to exhort the most shopkeepers in the neighbourhood?

It was released for the Xbox on October 7, 2002. A sequel, Blinx 2: Masters of Time and Space was released for the Xbox in 2004.<br/><br/>Introduction<br/>Advertised as &quot;The World's First 4D Action Game&quot;, Blinx is a third-person platform game, in which the player controls Blinx, a Time Sweeper, on his mission to prevent the end of the world. The game revolves around Blinx's (then-near-unique) Time System: Blinx is outfitted with a magical vacuum cleaner, the Time Sweeper (or TS-1000), with which he can exert some control over Time itself; slowing, speeding up, recording, reversing or stopping its flow entirely.<br/><br/>Plot<br/>In Blinx: The Time Sweeper, the player takes on the role of Blinx, an anthropomorphic cat who works at a facility known as the Time Factory. The Time Factory is a facility located outside of Time, dedicated to the creation, distribution and maintenance of the flow of all time throughout the universe. When glitches or corruptions in time are found, the Time Factory dispatches Time Sweeper agents to locate and correct them. Left unchecked, temporal glitches can manifest themselves into malevolent Time Monsters, roaming freely among dimensions, distorting everything with which they come into contact. When a gang of evil pigs known as the Tom-Tom gang begin stealing and destroying Time in dimension B1Q64, it becomes temporally unstable to the extent that the Time Sweepers decide that it is safer for all dimensions if the supply of time to B1Q64 be halted, suspending it and its inhabitants indefinitely. When Blinx receives a message from a young princess trapped within the doomed dimension, Blinx grabs his Time Sweeper and dives into dimension B1Q64 through the Sweepers' Time Portal moments before it closes.<br/><br/>After he manages to catch up with the Tom-Toms and the princess, they suddenly freeze and get spun around. This creates the final boss (which is a time monster made out of rocks) which can use time controls as well, so it forces Blinx to fight four previous bosses by using REW (all of which are the harder vesions of the ones that you fight in rounds 1, 2, 3 &amp; 5.) After he defeats them all again, he fights the final boss, wins and saves the princess while the Tom-Toms get away. Then he jumps into the Time Portal and ends up back in the Time Factory to be welcomed by an applause from the other Time Sweepers. After the credits roll, the player sees a message written by the princess (her real name, Princess Lena, is reveled at this point as well). Using the time crystals Blinx gave her, she rewinds the ending back to the part where Blinx is about to leave. Before he jumps in the Portal again, she wakes up and gives Blinx a hug.<br/><br/>Time Controls<br/>The Time Sweeper Blinx possess places six different Time Controls at his disposal. Five of these time controls are based on controls commonly found on VCRs and the sixth, RETRY, is unique.<br/><br/>To gain Time Controls, Blinx must first collect Time Crystals. The Time Crystals appear as shining, floating, spinning crystals in the game world. Blinx can collect the Time Crystals in any order, but when he possesses four at once, they are converted into Time Controls. If Blinx holds three of a particular Crystal, he gains one use of that Time Control. If Blinx holds four of a particular Crystal, he gains two uses of that Time Control. Other combinations are discarded.<br/><br/>Time Controls are stored in the Time Sweeper, up to the maximum number of Time Holders Blinx possesses. Blinx must have a Time Control use in his possession in order to activate it.<br/><br/>Blinx can trigger any of these first five Time Controls at any time:<br/><br/>REW - Two purple chevrons pointing to the left. Time Crystal - Purple 'plus'. This causes time to run backwards for everything in the world except Blinx himself. Bridges and other elements previously destroyed can be restored with this Time Control no matter how long ago they were destroyed. Useful when there is a stream with a one-way current or you need to go up a waterfall. <br/>FF - Two orange chevrons pointing to the right. Time Crystal - Orange pyramid. This causes time to run rapidly forwards for everything in the world including Blinx. During FF, Blinx is invulnerable to damage from time monsters or environmental hazards: any contact will cause FF to be cancelled, and Blinx will be unharmed. <br/>PAUSE - Two light blue rectangles. Time Crystal - Blue crescent moon. This causes time to stop for everything in the world except Blinx. Scenery elements are frozen during PAUSE, and can be jumped on to reach hidden areas. Also, he can't use switches and jump pads. <br/>REC - Green circle. Time Crystal - Green diamond. The first phase of REC is 10 seconds of 'recording' time, where Blinx is invulnerable to all damage, and can move as normal. When 10 seconds has elapsed (or Blinx has been lost to an unrecoverable environmental hazard), the world and Blinx will be rewound backwards for 10 seconds, and the same period of time will be played. During this 'playback', the actions taken by Blinx during the 'recording' will be shown as a green ghost, allowing for enhanced combat tactics to be used, or puzzles that would require two players to be solved(such as a seesaw). <br/>SLOW - Yellow triangle pointing to the right. Time Crystal - Yellow star. This causes time to run slowly for everything in the world except Blinx. Scenery elements are slowed during SLOW, and can be jumped on to reach hidden areas. <br/>There is a sixth Time Control, called RETRY. This Time Control cannot be triggered manually, it is triggered automatically when Blinx is knocked out by an enemy or lost to an infinite chasm. If Blinx holds no RETRYs when he is knocked out, the game is over.<br/><br/>RETRY - Red heart. Time Crystal - Red heart. RETRY causes everything in the world, including Blinx, to rewind to a point where Blinx should be safe. <br/>Blinx can hold any combination of REW, FF, PAUSE, REC or SLOW up to the number of Time Holders he possesses. He begins with three Time Holders, but you can gain up to 10 as the game progresses. The Time Control RETRY requires a special type of Time Holder, called a Retry Holder. Blinx begins the game with three Retry Holders, but can hold up to nine (an allusion to the lore that cats have nine lives).<br/><br/>In each stage, Blinx must travel from the Start Gate to the Ending Gate, eliminating all Time Monsters that exist on the stage. Each level has a time limit of 10 minutes.<br/><br/>"}, "74710": {"poll": [], "name": "Blinx 2: Masters of Time and Space", "videogamemode": ["Local Multiplayer", "Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["English/UK Xbox Edition", "JP Xbox Edition", "NA Xbox Edition"], "average": "0", "videogameseries": ["Blinx"], "videogametheme": ["Cartoon"], "usersrated": "0", "videogamedeveloper": ["Artoon"], "videogamegenre": ["Platform"], "videogameplatform": ["Xbox"], "statistics": [], "videogamepublisher": ["Microsoft Game Studios"], "description": "From Wikipedia<br/><br/>Blinx 2: Masters of Time and Space (released in Japan as Blinx 2: Battle of Time and Space) is a 3D third-person platform game developed by Artoon and published by Microsoft Game Studios.

Their enemies are Time Monsters and the Tom Tom Gang. They also must face the segments of the Big Crystal, when they mutate into bosses.<br/><br/>In Blinx 2, there are various missions the player must complete in order to find the Big Crystal. As many of the Time Monsters respawn when needed, the 'Time Sweep' mission of the original Blinx no longer applies.<br/><br/>The Tom Toms are a rowdy bunch, who use guns, turrets, tanks and other traps (for example, a decoy which morphs into a Tom Tom to lure Time Sweepers away). Their enemies are the Time Sweepers, the K9-1000 dogs, and two bosses.<br/><br/>Players can completely customize the looks of their two characters, with an extremely deep customization system. During the game's production, many viewed this as a revolutionary new standard in character creation, however the game's limited advertising following its release caused it to go widely unnoticed.<br/><br/>Time Controls<br/>Once again, the Time Sweeper places six different Time Controls at the player's disposal. Five of these are based on controls commonly found on VCRs. The Time Control and Time Sweepers available in Blinx 2 are slightly different from the Time Controls and Time Sweepers available to Blinx in Blinx 1.<br/><br/>The Time Crystals themselves work and appear differently also. In Blinx 2, the Time Crystals are shaped as their symbols in the Time Sweeper on-screen 'VCR' interface. Also, the player can collect the Time Crystals in any order to gain Time Controls. The player has a separate stock of Time Crystals for each Time Control, and when they hold three of any Crystal, it is converted into a Time Control. The 'collect 4 in a row to gain 2 Time Controls at once' rule is not present in Blinx 2.<br/><br/>The Time Controls are as in Blinx: The Time Sweeper with some exceptions.<br/><br/>FF - Two orange chevrons pointing to the right. Time Crystal - Orange chevrons pointing up. This Time Control is wildly different from its Blinx 1 counterpart. Blinx 2's FF causes time to slightly speed up for the world and its inhabitants but imbues the player's cat with energy, allowing them to run faster, jump higher, and fall slower. The player is no longer invulnerable during FF, and, as with all Blinx 2 Time Controls, any contact with an enemy during FF will cause the Time Control to be cancelled and the player to take damage. <br/>The sixth Time Control, RETRY, is triggered manually in Blinx 2, but it can only be triggered when the player is knocked out by an enemy or lost to an infinite chasm.<br/><br/>In Blinx 2, each Time Sweeper has its own Time Control capacity, and each Time Control is stored separately. The starting Sweepers can only store two PAUSE, two REW and two RETRY. Upgraded Sweepers can hold up to five of each Time Control.<br/><br/>There is an upgrade available for each Time Sweeper which allows two Time Controls (except RETRY) to be mixed into a hybrid Time Control, which can exhibit powers possessed by both its parent Controls. For example, the player can mix REC and SLOW into a hybrid Time Control SLOW + REC, which is the same as a REC, except its 'recording' and 'playback' are both doubled (20 seconds instead of 10), and the world is afflicted by the power of SLOW. All pairings of REW, FF, PAUSE, REC and SLOW are possible (except pairing a Time Control with itself), but some combinations are more useful than others.<br/><br/>At certain points in the game, the player is confronted by large concealed weapons. When these are triggered, the game freezes for few seconds asking the player to choose one of two REACTIVE Time Controls (a feature new for Blinx 2). REACTIVE Time Controls are free Time Controls (triggered by the player's Operator back at the Time Factory) that allow the player to dodge or eliminate the impending threat. If the player fails to choose a REACTIVE Time Control, then the game is resumed, and the player is free to use one of the regular Time Controls as normal, or to simply dodge out of the way of the threat.<br/><br/>PAUSE REACTIVE - This is the same as a regular PAUSE, but it lasts for slightly longer. If the player wanders out of range of the threat during PAUSE REACTIVE, and then back into the threat if the weapon fires for a second time, then the player is offered a second REACTIVE, but only the PAUSE REACTIVE is available. <br/>SLOW REACTIVE - This REACTIVE slows down the threat, roots the player to the spot, and challenges the player to dodge the incoming threat by moving the analog thumbstick to match on-screen commands. If the player does not react in time or pulls the wrong direction then the threat will instantly kill the player's character.<br/><br/>"}, "74712": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3297505.jpg", "poll": [], "boardgamedesigner": ["Alban Viard"], "statistics": [], "yearpublished": "2010", "maxplayers": "5", "boardgameartist": ["Todd Sanders"], "boardgamepublisher": ["AoS Team", "AVStudioGames"], "maxplaytime": "120", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3297505_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "120", "boardgamecategory": ["Expansion for Base-game", "Mafia", "Trains", "Transportation"], "description": "Age of Steam Expansion - Paris &amp; Moscow is one of the 2010 releases from French designer Alban Viard.<br/><br/>Paris features a fixed map using large districts in place of standard Cities with pre-determined linkages between them.<br/><br/>In Moscow the players must contend with the Russian Mafia, who make different cities black each round.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "3", "boardgameversion": ["English/French second edition", "First Edition"], "average": "7.07857", "name": "Age of Steam Expansion: Paris & Moscow", "playingtime": "120", "boardgamemechanic": ["Auction/Bidding", "Pick-up and Deliver", "Tile Placement"], "age": "13", "boardgameexpansion": [], "usersrated": "14", "boardgamefamily": ["Age of Steam", "Cities: Moscow", "Cities: Paris (France)", "Country: Russia"]}, "74713": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic806413.jpg", "poll": [], "boardgamedesigner": ["Alban Viard"], "statistics": [], "yearpublished": "2010", "maxplayers": "6", "age": "13", "boardgamepublisher": ["AoS Team"], "maxplaytime": "120", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic806413_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "120", "boardgamecategory": ["Expansion for Base-game", "Trains", "Transportation"], "description": "This is the second set of expansions by Alban Viard for the 2010 Essen Fair.<br/><br/>This is a mini-expansion that is intended to enhance other Age of Steam expansions.<br/><br/>The Robot adds a special delivery location to Age of Steam: The Moon.

Players are provided with several different choices for the race of their colonist, providing different advantages and disadvantages that can be paired to their respective strategies. To win, players not only compete against each other to amass the largest amount of wealth, but must also cooperate for the survival of the colony.<br/><br/>Central to the game is the acquisition and use of &quot;M.U.L.E.&quot;s (Multiple Use Labor Element) to develop and harvest resources from the player's real estate. Depending on how it is outfitted, a M.U.L.E. can be configured to harvest Energy, Food, Smithore (from which M.U.L.E.s are constructed), and Crystite (a valuable mineral available only at the &quot;Tournament&quot; level). Players must balance supply and demand of these elements, buying what they need, and selling what they don't. Players may also exploit or create shortages by refusing to sell to other players or to the &quot;store,&quot; which raises the price of the resource on the following turns. Scheming between players is encouraged by allowing collusion between two players, which initiates a mode allowing a private transaction. Crystite is the one commodity that is not influenced by supply and demand considerations, being deemed to be sold 'off world,' so the strategy with this resource is somewhat different&mdash;a player may attempt to maximize production without fear of having too much supply for the demand.<br/><br/>Each resource is required to do certain things on each turn. For instance, if a player is short on Food, there will be less time to take one's turn. Similarly, if a player is short on Energy, some land plots won't produce any output, while a shortage of Smithore will raise the price of M.U.L.E.s in the store and prevent the store from manufacturing new M.U.L.E.s to make use of one's land.<br/><br/>Players must also deal with periodic random events such as run-away M.U.L.E.s, sunspot activity, theft by space pirates and a meteorite impact which is both destructive and beneficial as a meteorite destroys the M.U.L.E. on the plot but also increases the potential Crystite output of the plot in the following rounds. The players also can hunt the mountain wampus for a cash reward. The game features a balancing system for random events that impact only a single player, such that favorable events never happen to the player currently in first place, while unfavorable events never happen to the player in last place. This same &quot;leveling of the playfield&quot; is applied whenever a tie happens in the game (e.g. when two players want to buy a resource at the same price); the player in the losing position automatically wins the tie.<br/><br/>From Inside Cover<br/><br/>YOU HATE HIM.<br/><br/>It means something, M.U.L.E.

Trevor makes a point of rubbing this in every time he calls.<br/><br/>He'll be able to rub it in in person soon enough: it's Thanksgiving Day, and you're driving home. Daddy was perfectly willing to buy you a plane ticket, but like you told him on the phone, there are much better things to spend the money on. Birthday presents, for instance -- you turn eighteen tomorrow. Besides, it's only a four-hour drive.<br/><br/>Two and a half hours into said drive, the car starts making a noise no piece of machinery should ever make. It's the sort of sound a rhesus monkey might make being forced down a garbage disposal. Now, Dorado is nothing but scorching desert from the time you cross the coastal mountains until you reach the river; true, it's the scorching desert in which you grew up, but sentimentality aside, it's not exactly the best place in the world to find yourself stranded. But you've got to do something about this noise, if only because it's drowning out the stereo. So you pull over. You're just about to switch off the ignition when the car goes dead of its own accord. You try to start it up again, but absolutely nothing happens.<br/><br/>Guess what, Tracy? You're stuck on the loneliest stretch of Interstate Zero miles away from the last sign of civilization. It's twenty minutes to noon and the temperature's well over a hundred and twenty. You already miss the air conditioning.

Each soldier can be equipped with different weapons (from automatic rifle to nuclear rocket launcher) and gear (targetting equipment, first-aid kit, nerve gas canisters to destroy bug nests). Soldiers gain experience levels, which can allow them to wear combat armor, which makes them stronger and allow them to use better weapons, forcefields and jetpacks. A number of specialist soldiers (combat engineers, medics, PSI soldiers) can also be added to squads to increase tactical flexibility.

For ease of reference, dice rolls are indicated by the abbreviation: &lsquo;xd6&rsquo; where &lsquo;x&rsquo; indicates the number of dice to be rolled. For example, a roll of 2-dice would be indicated by the code 2d6. The result of the dice roll will often be modified by the addition of 1 or more; so the code 2d6+2 means roll 2 dice and increase the total by 3.

Some special car models have been designed by Bizarre Creations themselves. There are also some heavily altered versions of familiar urban environments, such as the Los Angeles river halfpipe and several parts of London. These areas were altered to make the races more enjoyable instead of the developers having to strictly abide by each twist and turn. Depending on the character(s) the player races against or tags along with in team races, they will have their own racing styles, power-up set ups, match types, locales, cars and will be apart of certain fictional servers. As the player races well, performs stunts and uses power-ups in certain ways during races, the player will gain 'fan points', Blur's equivalent to PGR's Kudos system. These points help the player progress through the career, purchase more cars and parts and earn more fans for the user base. During the career, challenges will take place midrace when the player drives through a fan icon.

It was designed by Polyphony Digital, the same team that makes the popular Gran Turismo auto racing series. Tourist Trophy is one of only two titles for the PlayStation 2 that is capable of 1080i output, the other being Gran Turismo 4.<br/><br/>Tourist Trophy was first released in China on January 26, 2006 then in Japan on February 2, 2006 and rated 32/40 (Silver rank) by Famitsu, a Japanese video game magazine.[citation needed] The North American edition was officially released on April 4, 2006 with seven extra motorcycles, new riding gear, seven bonus background music (BGM) tracks, enhanced visual effects, an exclusive &quot;Semi-Pro Mode&quot; and bike profiles. The PAL edition was launched on May 29, 2006 in Europe and June 1, 2006 in Oceania. The PAL version offers two additional motorcycles and five new BGM tracks performed by European artists Infadels, Vitalic and Hystereo.<br/><br/>Gameplay<br/>Modes<br/>The &quot;Riding Form&quot; option is available in both Arcade Mode (AM) and TT Mode (TTM).<br/><br/>Arcade mode<br/>Before the race, the user can choose among four Riding Form presets: &quot;Lean Body&quot;, &quot;Neutral&quot;, &quot;Lean Bike&quot; and &quot;Motard/Dirt&quot;. Lean Body focuses on quick cornering, Neutral focuses on handling, and Lean Bike is about slow cornering. The particular Motard form with the leg off is the Dirt position dedicated to Enduro and Naked bike riding; however, the user is free to use it on all bikes. This mode is named after the mode in related series Gran Turismo of the same name.<br/><br/>TT mode<br/>The user can enter the Garage Riding Form settings with up to four fully customizable forms to record. They are saved as &quot;Form A&quot;, &quot;Form B&quot;, &quot;Form C&quot; and &quot;Motard/Dirt&quot;. Each one has eleven unique parameters and four presets: &quot;Neutral&quot;, &quot;Lean Body&quot;, &quot;Lean Bike&quot; and &quot;Motard/Dirt&quot; from which to choose. Fully adjustable parameters are &quot;Head Roll Angle&quot;, &quot;Head Pitch Angle&quot;, &quot;Torso Roll Angle&quot;, &quot;Torso Yaw Angle&quot;, &quot;Body Lean (Full Bank)&quot;, &quot;Arm Angle&quot;, &quot;Seat Position (Forward/Back)&quot;, &quot;Lateral Slide&quot;, &quot;Vertical Slide&quot;, &quot;Leg Angle&quot; and &quot;Body Lean (Upright)&quot;.<br/><br/>Tourist Trophy's default setting is &quot;Normal. Using the Normal setting, the player can perform maneuvers such as the &quot;wheelie&quot; and the &quot;stoppie&quot; on powerful bikes. These possibilities are disabled with the &quot;Professional&quot; setting. Enabling the Professional feature will enhance the simulation aspect as well as the difficulty level, over the arcade-oriented Normal. Professional riding is supposed to allow a more realistic experience with autonomous upper body control (as the &quot;Tuck&quot; manual function is enabled), and a separated front/rear brake control is added over the rear+front brake default system.<br/><br/>Semi-pro mode<br/>The Semi-Pro Mode is an exclusive feature of the North American edition. Other options enhancing difficulty are the &quot;Strict Judgment&quot; a 10 second slow down penalty as seen in Gran Turismo 4 and the famous &quot;Best Line&quot; optional display.<br/><br/>Other features<br/>Photo mode/best shot<br/>Unedited screenshots can be taken from a race replay and saved on a memory card or connected USB flash drives, like in Gran Turismo 4. This function is known in the game as &quot;Best Shot&quot;. Using various replay angles as a digital camera, the game is able to produce a selection of screenshots with variable compression rate (Normal/Fine/SuperFine) and size (up to 1280x960/72 dpi). The user can choose to save or print with an Epson compatible USB printer, or display it on TV using the Musical Diaporama feature. Saved game screenshots can be exchanged with friends or made public on the Internet. Unlike Best Shot, the &quot;Photo Mode&quot;'s parameters are fully adjustable and it gives the user the opportunity to entirely set photographs. The user can tune various parameters such as camera angle or course section. Formatting the USB device in Photo Mode/Best Shot will create the &quot;DCIM/100PDITT&quot; folder/subfolder allowing Tourist Trophy to store, upload and download game picture files generated under the form &quot;IMG_00X.JPG&quot;. Standard USB 2.0 flash drives (including MP3 players, mobile phones and pendrives) can be used to manage game JPEG files instead of the official I-O Data model.<br/><br/>Replay/ghost<br/>The USB flash drive can host Tourist Trophy Replay/Ghost files downloaded from either the official game website or a fan site. It can also be used to exchange files with a friend's USB device. Once the files are in the flash drive, the user can upload them from within the game in order to compete with a Ghost (&quot;Time Attack&quot;) or to watch a Replay (&quot;Theater&quot;). Each file can be used as Replay or as Ghost. The first Replay/Ghost files released on the Japanese site featured a Famitsu journalist,[who?] Japanese pro rider and Tourist Trophy test rider Satoshi Tsujimoto, and Tourist Trophy producer Kazunori Yamauchi.[citation needed] Formatting the USB device from Theater Mode will create the &quot;PDI&quot; folder allowing Tourist Trophy to store, upload and download files generated under the form &quot;replay.dat&quot;. Standard third-party USB devices are also compatible with &quot;REPLAY.DAT&quot; files.<br/><br/>Challenge mode/race event<br/>Unlike Gran Turismo games, Tourist Trophy doesn't contain any money system. The player has to obtain licenses (&quot;License School&quot;) in order to complete various missions (&quot;Challenge Mode&quot;) and obtain bikes that will be used and tuned to compete in the Championships series (&quot;Race Event&quot;).<br/><br/>Tourist Trophy's &quot;Race Event&quot; (TTM) core mode requires a license gained after completing riding lessons on a 250cc Yamaha TW225 off-road bike. Being successful on License School will unlock upper class &quot;License Cards&quot; (TTM), new bikes (AM/TTM), extra &quot;Riding Gear&quot; items (TTM), new tracks (AM), and extra makers (AM/TTM). Winning Challenge Mode will make new bikes available in the Garage (TTM). Beating Race Events will unlock a bonus 23rd Race Event, extra bikes (AM/TTM), new tracks (AM/TTM) and a classic bike (TTM). Completing the game will unlock the &quot;Ending Movie&quot; and add the &quot;Clover Crown&quot; ending theme in the &quot;Music Theater&quot; (AM/TTM).<br/><br/>"}, "74801": {"boardgamedesigner": ["(Uncredited)"], "poll": [], "name": "Greeny", "playingtime": "30", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": ["Card Drafting"], "yearpublished": "2010", "usersrated": "3", "maxplayers": "6", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic783036_t.jpg", "average": "3.36667", "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["(Unknown)", "Greeny Games"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic783036.jpg", "boardgameversion": ["Dutch First Edition", "Dutch First Edition"], "maxplaytime": "30", "boardgamecategory": ["Card Game", "Children's Game", "Environmental"], "age": "8", "minplaytime": "30", "description": "During the game, players have to collect Greenycards.

Jedi Starfighter takes place just prior to the second Star Wars film's events and during the Battle of Geonosis.<br/><br/>In the game, the player controls different star fighters from the Star Wars Universe. Each mission revolves around protecting friendly ships and destroying enemy ships. Each mission also has one bonus and one hidden objective completing of which unlocks bonus missions, videos, and starfighters.<br/><br/>Starfighters are equipped with different weaponry which can be highly effective in certain missions. The use of the force weapons in the Jedi Starfighter present a unique aspect to the genre. Force weapons are activated by holding a button which begins to turn the screen purple, and releasing it before the screen becomes white. Holding the button for just the right amount of time will cause the force weapon to last longer or destroy more targets. Holding it too long or too short will reduce its effectiveness. Although unlimited in number, force weapons take several seconds to &quot;recharge&quot; while Adi is regaining her mental strength.<br/><br/>"}, "74808": {"rpgartist": ["Jaana-Mari Block"], "rpg": ["A Bitter Aftertaste"], "statistics": [], "name": "A Bitter Aftertaste", "rpgdesigner": ["J.

This leads them on a wild romp through six different areas to snatch different things such as a popcorn machine and a TV for themselves. There are several mini games as bonuses in the game.<br/><br/>All through the game, they try to take these things while avoiding the Sniffer, (Dwayne the Verminator), who tries to defeat them by using mind-controlled vermin he has captured as his &quot;henchmen.&quot; At one point, many animals, including weasels, badgers, and even Vincent the bear are controlled.Sami Kirkpatrick, Madison Davenport and Shane Baumel reprise their roles from the film.<br/><br/>Gameplay<br/>Over the Hedge features 3D platform gameplay as well as mini games. Players navigate a series of homes searching for luxury items, controlling RJ, Verne, Hammy or Stella. Character voices are provided by soundalikes rather than the original actors who recorded the voices for the film (except Bucky Spike and Quillo).<br/><br/>Two different kinds of attack can be employed, melee and ranged. Weapons include golf clubs, sticks, baseball bats, plungers and other everyday items. Ranged attacks consist of throwing boomerangs, frisbees and shooting golf balls, these attacks can be charged up. There are also energy attacks, projectile weapons and objects to pick up and throw at enemies. The game has several pickup weapons, such as weapons that only opponents have (i.e., a trowel). There are also guns that can be picked up, such as a toy ball launcher, a freeze ray, a bubble shooter, or a lava blaster.<br/><br/>Players can jump or double jump. The game allows a second player to press a button on the second controller and join the game at any time, as well as pause the game and drop out. There are also plenty of obstacles and hazards to overcome, as well as objectives to complete and extras to collect. The game also has an array of hats, which when collected make a humorous sound and act as armor. These include a chef hat, a crown, a witch hat and a hockey helmet amongst others.<br/><br/>Several locations from the movie (and some that are not) appear to give a greater playing ground than the suburbs, the home base being the woods where all the loot is stored. Players can switch around between the four characters to give the storyline some slight twist, as each character says something different when a situation arises, to slightly alter the story.<br/><br/>"}, "74859": {"rpgdesigner": ["Claudia Ehlers", "Niels Gaul", "Eckart Hopp", "Dennis Miller", "Hadmar Freiherr von Wieser"], "statistics": [], "name": "Aventurischer Bote (Issue 49 - 1993)", "rpgartist": ["Ina Kramer"], "rpgproducer": ["Ulrich Kiesow", "Michelle Schwefel"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic758935.jpg", "usersrated": "0", "average": "0", "rpgissue": ["Aventurischer Bote"], "rpgissuearticle": ["Die Thronrede Seiner Kgl.

You are Fallen.<br/><br/>Once this ignominious road was thought to be travelled only by the most honourable of people turned bad, the ex-Paladin. That is not the case. In nearly every profession it is possible to fall from grace. Where do you go then? That is what this book is about. For the Paladin there is the path of the blackguard, a road of unthinkable evil and cruelty but there are many other options for those who fall. After the unhappy ending, without thought of redemption, there is still a chance to move forward and find a life of significance.<br/><br/>Second Look: Fallen introduces 13 new prestige classes in this 31 page book. Many of these prestige classes can be taken by a variety of classes, including paladin. These classes typically start at level 4, instead of level 6. This allows the Player to invest fewer levels in a class they are going to lose in order to take one of these prestige classes. Second Look: Fallen also includes 7 new feats to help the transition.<br/><br/>"}, "74873": {"videogame": ["Classic Text Adventure Masterpieces of Infocom"], "poll": [], "name": "A Change in the Weather", "videogamemode": ["Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["Z-Code IF Comp edition"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic767570.jpg", "videogametheme": ["Other"], "usersrated": "1", "videogamedeveloper": ["(Self-Developed Video Game)"], "videogamegenre": ["Text Adventure"], "videogameplatform": ["Software Interpreter"], "average": "8", "statistics": [], "videogamepublisher": ["(Web published)"], "videogamecompilation": ["Classic Text Adventure Masterpieces of Infocom"], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic767570_t.jpg", "description": "From IFWiki<br/><br/>Written by Andrew Plotkin.

At the beginning of the 21st century, a worldwide nuclear war annihilated most of civilization, turning most of the planet into an inhospitable wasteland. Players lead a team of Desert Rangers (a remnant of the old US army) investigating a series of disturbances in the desert.<br/><br/>Wasteland's user interface is similar to the Bard's Tale (a series  of RPGs by the same developers): a mix top-down views and encounter views. Dialogue with NPC is done through a simple text parser, combat is turn-based and uses the encounter display, using text to describe the effects of character actions.<br/><br/>At the time of its release, Wasteland featured several important gameplay innovations:<br/><br/>* A skill-based character development system. It was an implementation of the Tunnels &amp; Trolls and Mercenaries, Spies and Private Eyes pen &amp; paper RPG rules written by Michael A. Stackpole and Ken St. Andre (both members of the Wasteland development team). It allowed players a lot of freedom, as a lot of in-game situations could be solved differently, depending on the available skills and equipment.<br/><br/>* A permanent world. Any change to the game world state were saved on-disk. This required players to make a &quot;working copy&quot; of the original game floppy disks for their game in progress, as game data was directly stored on the disks.<br/><br/>* Independent NPCs. Some NPCs could be recruited into the party, but would refuse to part with equipment or perform some actions.<br/><br/>The game comes with a paragraph booklet, which contains numbered paragraphs describing conversations, encounters or story elements. The game would sometimes refer players to a specific paragraph number. It contained clues and details that could not fit on the disk. The paragraphs are mixed with together paragraphs from another unrelated story to prevent players from spoiling themselves by reading too much.<br/><br/>The game was a commercial success, and is widely recognized as a milestone in computer RPG development.<br/><br/>"}, "74882": {"rpgartist": ["V.

The game was released in Japan on October 4, 2007, in North America on November 13, 2007 and in Europe  on November 9, 2007 for the PlayStation 2 (the Wii version was released in Japan on October 4, 2007, in North America on December 3, 2007, and in Europe on February 15, 2008).<br/><br/>Tenkaichi 3 features over 150 characters (161 characters to be precise), the largest character roster in any Dragon Ball Z game, as well as one of the largest rosters in any fighting game. Ryo Mito once stated that the game would feature never-before-seen characters made exclusively for the game, although the only exclusive characters were the saiyans turning into Great Apes.<br/><br/>Several new notable features include: Battle Replay, night and day stages, the Wii's online capability, and Disc Fusion. Battle Replay allows players to capture their favorite fights and save them to an SD card to view later on. Night and day stages allow for more accurate battles in Dragon Ball History, as well as the ability to transform into a Great Ape by using the moon. There are also several other time differences, such as dawn and afternoon. Not all stages provide different times. You can also change the aura of your character. The Wii version features online multiplayer capability, the first game in the series to have such a feature. Players can fight against anyone from around the globe with a ranking system showing the player's current standing compared to anyone else who has played online. As compensation for the lack of online, Spike has added a new &quot;Disc Fusion System&quot; to the PlayStation 2 version. Inserting a Tenkaichi 1 or Tenkaichi 2 disc during play unlocks Ultimate Battle or Ultimate Battle Z, modes featured in the respective games needed to unlock them. The game also supports 480p for both the Wii and the PlayStation 2 versions.<br/><br/>Other features in the game includes more combo attacks or character specific combos, the Blast Combos, and the Z Burst Dash. The additional combo attacks will be able to help chain in more attacks for more damage and longer combos. The Blast Combos are normal combos used in the game, however by inputting the another button into the attack will allow you to use a blast attack for extra damage. Depending on the moves of the character you might not be able to use this feat such as Videl or Hercule. The Z Burst Dash is much faster and more evasive version of the Dragon Dash. It allows the user to get behind the opponent at high speeds for either a strike or to avoid a blast 2 attack. The drawback to this technique is that it will rapidly drain you of energy.<br/><br/>"}, "74906": {"poll": [], "name": "Hip Hop Millionaires", "playingtime": "60", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": ["Dice Rolling"], "yearpublished": "2010", "usersrated": "0", "boardgamefamily": ["Monopoly"], "maxplayers": "4", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic759633_t.jpg", "average": "0", "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["(Unknown)"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic759633.jpg", "boardgameversion": ["First edition"], "maxplaytime": "60", "boardgamecategory": ["Economic", "Music"], "age": "12", "minplaytime": "60", "description": "&quot;The Worlds Most Popular Grammie Board Game&quot; - Work your way from the City Steets to a Hip Hop Grammie winning artist.

From suicide and execution to assassination, poison is often times the weapon of choice. Socrates was given poison hemlock after being sentenced to death, while during the Renaissance and Enlightenment, a favored delivery method for poison was a chocolate drink. Even in modern times poisons are still used; the Bulgarian dissident Georgi Markov was killed by ricin poisoning in 1978 after being injected from a dart hidden in an umbrella. Poisons have also been a favorite method of murder in novels and movies from Agatha Christie to Arthur Conan Doyle, Frank Capra (Arsenic and Old Lace) to Alfred Hitchcock (Notorious).<br/><br/>The term poison is often loosely used to describe not only substances that can be created from toxic plants, metals and other materials but also to the toxins secreted or injected by all variety of animals. Poisons are used because they are deadly by nature; it is only the dosage that makes a poison less toxic. In contrast, many venoms and toxins created by plants and animals may have other non-lethal effects, such as paralysis, and are not necessarily designed to kill. This is an important distinction as most of the poisons listed in this book (arsenic, hemlock, cyanide, etc.) are extremely deadly. Many types of venom can be used to kill if applied in the right dosage, but they generally are less deadly than more &lsquo;traditional&rsquo; poisons.<br/><br/>But why do people turn to poisons? For some, the use of a poison is a coward&rsquo;s way of dealing death. For others, poisons represent a force multiplier, allowing a relatively weak or unskilled person the ability to take out a more powerful opponent. Sometimes poisonings happen by accident, or through negligence on the part of one party or another. No matter the reason or cause, poisons will always find a way to deal death.<br/><br/>This book focuses only on poisons and is divided into two parts. The first part is a general section looking at the basics of poisons (types, vectors, preparation, and delivery), skill challenges, tools and equipment necessary in the poisoner&rsquo;s kit, and other useful items for the GM. The second part looks at the &lsquo;traditional&rsquo; poisons and provides descriptions and stat blocks. All of the poisons listed in this book can be found in the &lsquo;real&rsquo; world. Their rules for use during a game are designed to closely match the symptoms of the real poison, whenever possible.<br/><br/>"}, "74916": {"rpgdesigner": ["David G.

The game has been expanded into a series since its original release, which currently includes Counter-Strike: Condition Zero, Counter-Strike: Source, Counter-Strike: Anthology and Counter-Strike on Xbox. Counter-Strike  pits a team of counter-terrorists against a team of terrorists in a series of rounds. Each round is won by either completing the mission objective or eliminating the opposing force. The latest incarnation of the game, Counter-Strike: Source, is based on the Source engine developed for Half-Life 2.<br/><br/>The game is currently the most played Half-Life modification in terms of players, according to GameSpy.<br/><br/>Counter-Strike was developed first as a Half-Life modification, and therefore named &quot;Half-Life: Counter-Strike&quot;. The original version was a 3rd-party Half-Life modification, but since then it has grown into a commercial mod and later advertised as a separate game in itself. It still uses and runs on the Half-Life game engine and is based on its unchanged structure.<br/><br/>Counter-Strike is a first-person shooter in which players join either the terrorist or counter-terrorist team (or become a spectator). Each team attempts to complete their mission objective and/or eliminate the opposing team. Each round starts with the two teams spawning simultaneously, usually at opposite ends of the map from each other.<br/><br/>A player can choose to play as one of eight different default character models (four for each side, although Counter-Strike: Condition Zero added two extra models, bringing the total to ten). Players are generally given a few seconds before the round begins (known as &quot;freeze time&quot;) to prepare and buy equipment, during which they cannot attack or walk/move (a player can still take damage, having the player drop from a certain height during freeze time was the only way somebody could control the players starting &quot;HP&quot;). They can return to the buy area within a set amount of time to buy more equipment (some custom maps included neutral &quot;buy zones&quot; that could be used by both teams). Once the round has ended, surviving players retain their equipment for use in the next round; players who were killed begin the next round with the basic default starting equipment.<br/><br/>Standard monetary bonuses are awarded for winning a round, losing a round, killing an enemy, being the first to instruct a hostage to follow, rescuing a hostage or planting the bomb.<br/><br/>The scoreboard displays team scores in addition to statistics for each player: name, kills, deaths, and ping (in milliseconds). The scoreboard also indicates whether a player is dead, carrying the bomb (on bomb maps), or is the VIP (on assassination maps), although information on players on the opposing team is hidden from a player until his/her death, as this information can be important.<br/><br/>Killed players become &quot;spectators&quot; for the duration of the round; they cannot change their names until they spawn (come alive) again, text chat cannot be sent to or received from live players; and voice chat can only be received from live players and not sent to them (unless the cvar sv_alltalk is set to 1). Spectators are generally able to watch the rest of the round from multiple selectable views, although some servers disable some of these views to prevent dead players from relaying information about living players to their teammates through alternative media (most notably voice in the case of Internet cafes and Voice over IP programs such as TeamSpeak or Ventrilo). This form of cheating is known as &quot;ghosting&quot;.<br/><br/>"}, "74933": {"poll": [], "name": "Loaded", "videogamemode": ["Local Multiplayer", "Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["European PlayStation edition", "JP PSX edition", "US PSX edition"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic760732.jpg", "videogametheme": ["Science Fiction"], "videogamegenre": ["Shoot 'em Up"], "videogamedeveloper": ["Gremlin Interactive (1994-1999)"], "videogamefranchise": ["Greatest Hits (Best Selling PlayStation Games, US)", "Platinum Range (Best Selling PlayStation Games, PAL)"], "videogameplatform": ["PlayStation"], "usersrated": "4", "average": "5.25", "statistics": [], "videogamepublisher": ["Interplay (Video Game)"], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic760732_t.jpg", "description": "From Wikipedia<br/><br/>Loaded (known as Blood Factory  in Japan) is a science fiction-themed top-down shoot 'em up video game that was developed by Gremlin Interactive and published by Interplay. Loaded was released in late 1995&ndash;early 1996 (around New Year time) on both the PlayStation and Sega Saturn. The game had origins in DC comics and more notably the more adult-orientated Vertigo Comics, and there was a small graphic novel based on the game. The six playable characters of the game are a combination of villains, anti-heroes, psychopaths, perverts, mutants, and flamboyant murderers. They are, however, the last hope to stop the intergalactic supervillain  code-named F.U.B. and save the universe. The characters were created and designed with contributions from Garth Ennis of Vertigo Comics and Greg Staples of 2000AD.<br/><br/>Later in the same year the game spawned a sequel using almost entirely the same characters and the same game engine, albeit one with mildly improved graphics, named Re-Loaded. Re-Loaded was released on the PlayStation and PC at the end of 1996. Although it did not enjoy as good sales as its predecessor, it did however have an acclaimed soundtrack which included music from Pop Will Eat Itself (as did the first game) and the game discs of both games could be played as audio CDs. Both games were notorious for their macabre sense of humor, over-the-top violence and extreme gore.<br/><br/>The game features levels across fifteen different worlds and has six playable characters: Mamma, Fwank, Bounca, Vox, Butch and Cap'n Hands. Two characters may be selected in co-operative mode to complete the game. A mission briefing will begin at the start of every mission, aided by a full motion video sequence. Loaded's gameplay is similar to that of Gauntlet, which requires the player to move room to room killing everything in sight, everything of which will try to kill the player also. Score can be increased by looting the bloodied remains of enemies. There are some puzzle and exploration elements, and power-ups and ammo can be found. The levels progress by collecting keycards capable of unlocking doors. The player can zoom in to their character by pressing R2, or zoom out by pressing L2. At the end of each level, the game tallies the player's greed factor, accuracy and body count on a 0%-100% scale in order to give the player's career prospects (ranging from as low as &quot;social worker&quot; to as high as &quot;genocidal maniac&quot;, etc.) and final score.<br/><br/>"}, "74934": {"rpgartist": ["H\u00e5kan Ackeg\u00e5rd", "Peter Bergting", "\u00c5sa Hedenskog", "Greg Hildebrandt", "Ann-Sophie Qvarnstr\u00f6m"], "rpgitemversion": ["Softcover Version"], "rpgseries": ["Konfluxsviten"], "name": "Den femte konfluxen", "rpgdesigner": ["Erik Granstr\u00f6m", "Mats Mariedahl", "Johan Sj\u00f6berg"], "rpgproducer": ["H\u00e5kan Ackeg\u00e5rd", "Nils Gulliksson", "\u00c5sa Hedenskog", "Henrik Strandberg"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic759452.jpg", "usersrated": "1", "rpgsetting": ["Ereb Altor"], "average": "8", "statistics": [], "rpg": ["Drakar och Demoner (Expert, 4th & Chronopia 5th Editions)"], "rpgpublisher": ["Target Games"], "poll": [], "rpgcategory": ["Scenario / Adventure / Module"], "rpggenre": ["Fantasy (High Fantasy)"], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic759452_t.jpg", "description": "Back of the book<br/>D&ouml;dg&aring;ngarna l&auml;gger sista stenen p&aring; sin bro f&ouml;re kv&auml;llen&quot;, s&auml;ger &ouml;verste Grisban torrt och sneglar mot pr&auml;sten vid stens&auml;ttningen.

Animalball Melee is suitable for two to six players.&quot;<br/><br/>User Summary:<br/><br/>Animalball Melee is a set of alternate man-on-man combat rules for the d20 system, heavily influenced by early Steve Jackson games such as The Fantasy Trip and Melee.<br/><br/>"}, "74941": {"rpgartist": ["Jupiter Media"], "rpgitemversion": ["PDF Version"], "poll": [], "name": "GM-fu: Session Prep", "rpgdesigner": ["Philippe-Antoine M\u00e9nard", "Vicki Potter", "Phil Vecchione"], "rpgproducer": ["(Uncredited)"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic771755.jpg", "usersrated": "3", "average": "5", "statistics": [], "rpg": ["Generic / Universal"], "rpgpublisher": ["Tabletop Adventures, LLC"], "rpgcategory": ["Non-Game Book (but RPG Related)"], "rpggenre": ["Generic / Universal"], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic771755_t.jpg", "description": "Publisher Blurb:<br/><br/>Now, the Masters of GM-fu present their secrets of Session Preparation!<br/><br/>Successful session planning requires inspiration and execution.

Send your campaign back to the Roman Empire with genuine Roman names! Culled from epigraphy (inscriptions in stone) and Latin texts, these names allow players and Game Masters alike to name game characters with names that real Romans really used!<br/><br/>Consider the name Gaius Julius Caesar.<br/><br/>Gaius is his praenomen (given name). Julius is his nomen gentilicium (family name). The Romans used only a few given names, so they added modifiers (sort of like adjectives) to their family names. These modifiers were called Cognomen (Caesar is his cognomen).<br/><br/>Like any name table, you can roll randomly with percentage dice; but for those of you who want historical authenticity, Appendix C matches Roman nomen gentilicium (family names) with their associated tribes as found in authentic Roman inscriptions; Appendix B lists authentic pairs of nomen gentilicium and cognomens as found in Roman inscriptions. While these pairings are not exhaustive, here is an example of cognomen tied to the nomen gentilicium Cornelius: Anteros, Balbus, Carpus, Cato, Cerdo, Cinna, Crispus, Dolabella, Fabia, Felix, Fortunatus, Fuscus, Gallus, Iucundus, Lentulus, Paternus, Restitutus, Saloninus, Scipio, Successus, Sulla, Theophilus, Trupo. More than 130 families are listed.<br/><br/>Appendix D discusses how to handle non-humans (elves, dragons, giants, etc.) in a Roman world.<br/><br/>* Learn how a Roman name is organized.<br/>    * See real naming examples using real Roman names!<br/>    * Learn how to handle the naming of sons and daughters (including adoption and marriage).<br/>    * Find out how to use these table for a fantasy Amazon culture!<br/>    * Discover how to name foreigners (peregrini).<br/>    * Learn how slaves were named.<br/>    * See commonly used abbreviations (&quot;initials&quot;).<br/>    * Find out &quot;How Do You Say That?&quot;<br/>    * All names are presented in tables which you can pick from or roll on for random determination and each table entry lists both the masculine and feminine forms (i.e. Julius/Julia). This helps keep the names sounding correct without you having to change endings (this alone speeds up naming during game play).<br/>    * Praenomen (two tables; the first lists the 22 common names; the expanded table lists all 48).<br/>    * Nomen Gentilicium (800 names).<br/>    * Cognomen (more than 700 names with their associated meanings, and 1200 more that are undefined; that's 1900 cognomen!). The Roman Senate awarded cognomen for deeds (cognomen ex virtue), and with these meanings the Game Master can award characters names of virtue (for heroism, foolishness, or as a reminder of an adventure, etc). Those that are defined are divided into the following tables: Authority Figures, Criminal Descriptors, Entertainers, Fauna, Flora, Gemstone Descriptors, Geographical Descriptors, Geographical Fantasy, Magic Descriptors, Military Descriptors, Months, Other, Personal (three tables), Religious Descriptors (General, Christian, Druidic, Jewish, Roman), Slaves, and Socio-Occupational (two tables). The text notes which were found on inscriptions and which were not.<br/>    * Filiation: name your father, grandfather, etc. already declined in Latin thus, Gaius is listed as Gaii;(two tables; the first lists the 22 common names; the expanded table lists all 48). If someone asks your character, &quot;Who's your daddy?&quot;, you can answer them! ;)<br/>    * Tribu and Domo (matches tribe [tribu] to the domus [residence]). Three tables (280 names) use Claudius Ptolemy's Geographia to match the tribal people of the Italian peninsula to their cities of residence, and with a brief write up about each tribe. A Fourth table focuses on the voting families of the city of Rome, while the fifth table focuses on the tribes found on authentic inscriptions (46 names).<br/>    * Agnomen (for adoption, 800 names).<br/>    * Speed tips for the Game Master for how to handle naming Non-Player Characters when you're in a pinch without a prepared name (but that never happens, right?). Topics include Roman Senators, Citizens in the city of Rome, Citizens of the Provinces, etc. This is located right after the Table of Contents, so that it's easy to find in a hurry!<br/><br/>Here's just part of the Bibliography:<br/><br/>* A.D. Godley (translator) Herodotus. (Harvard University Press)<br/>    * D.P. Simpson, Cassell's Latin and English Dictionary. (MacMillan)<br/>    * E.

Mommsen, Corpus Inscriptionum Latinarum (1861)<br/><br/>Even if you're familiar with the structure of Roman naming, having dozens of praenomen, hundreds of nomen gentilicium and almost 2,000 cognomen organized in table format makes random generation a breeze! If you have trouble thinking up names, you can always browse these tables looking for that cool name for your character! With names pre-declined in masculine and feminine forms (as well as the pre-declined genitive forms for filliation purposes), you'll be putting together authentic Roman names in little time and with little effort! Roman Name Tables is great book for any campaign with a Roman or pseudo-Roman nation, great for anyone with an interest in the history of Roman naming, and great for anyone wanting to generate a Roman name!<br/><br/>"}, "74944": {"rpgartist": ["(Uncredited)"], "rpgitemversion": ["PDF Version"], "rpgseries": ["Name Tables"], "name": "Dutch Name Tables", "rpgdesigner": ["Mark G.

Young adult works like Eragon and How to Train Your Dragon follow young heroes as they bond with incredible beasts. Despite the popularity and sheer appeal of dragon-riding heroes, traditional fantasy gaming has never really supported the trope.<br/><br/>It's easy to see why: giving a player character a bonded dragon at first level is equivalent to giving that hero a fully armed tank, while everybody else in the party makes do with swords and bows. A veteran hero, riding an adult dragon... the metaphor of a tank gives way to an even more alarming one: the metaphor a fully armed stealth bomber with a nuclear payload. Dragons are overwhelmingly powerful, and having one in your corner, loyal only to you... that's a class feature that certainly outdoes Weapon Specialization and Barbarian Rage.<br/><br/>This sourcebook presents a new 20 level core class: the Dragonbound, a unique breed of knight who is defined by his empathic bond with a great dragon steed. The Dragonbound is an intentionally unbalanced campaign option; in terms of sheer damage dealing potential (as well as mobility and endurance), the Dragonbound certainly outclasses the Fighter and Barbarian. Character classes that depend on a mystical mount or animal companion, such as Paladin and the Ranger are similarly outclassed. Since the Dragonbound's core concept resolves around a partnership with a dragon, and mounts and animal companions are tangentially related to the concept of what a Paladin or Ranger is, the Dragonbound's companion beast is naturally more impressive. However, given the Dragonbound's emphasis on honorable combat and exalted place in their nation's military means that many Dragonbound eventually take at least a few levels in Paladin or Blackguard.<br/><br/>"}, "74954": {"poll": [], "name": "Worms Forts: Under Siege", "videogamemode": ["Hotseat", "Local Multiplayer", "Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["English/UK PC Release", "English/UK PS2 Release", "English/UK XBox Release", "Mobile Release", "US PC Release", "US PS2 Release", "US XBox Release", "Windows Downloadable edition"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic874833.jpg", "videogameseries": ["Worms"], "videogametheme": ["Animals", "Cute Fantasy"], "videogamefranchise": ["Worms"], "videogamedeveloper": ["Team17 Software Ltd."], "videogamegenre": ["Strategy"], "videogameplatform": ["Other Mobile Devices", "PlayStation 2", "Windows", "Xbox"], "usersrated": "7", "average": "6.57143", "statistics": [], "videogamepublisher": ["SEGA Corporation", "Team17 Software Ltd."], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic874833_t.jpg", "description": "[User Summary]<br/><br/>Worms Forts: Under Siege is a tactical game in which players have a team of worms armed with various weapons and devices which they use to blow other teams to bits.<br/><br/>By constructing forts of increasing levels, access to new weapons is granted.

At the beginning of his turn, the player draws 4 cards from his unit deck and/or the operations deck (in the XBLA version, this is done automatically). The player can then spend prestige to deploy new units onto tiles controlled by them, move active units, play special operation cards, or engage enemy units on the board.<br/><br/>In combat, the attacking unit attacks first unless the defender is dug in. Players first compare their unit's combat stats and may then play operation cards to sway the battle in their favor or cancel combat completely. Finally, a player may choose to sacrifice any card in their hand for its combat value to boost their chances further. If the defending unit survives combat, it may counter-attack, which follows the same steps.

Inside you discover a spiraling tower of RPG, video game, and movie stereotypes of every sort on each floor, and must collect treasures and artifacts  from each of them in order to challenge the Master Ghost and claim the title of Master Geek for yourself.<br/><br/>But meanwhile, a deranged, shadowy psychopathic killer stalks your strongest party member, believing that he would get your champion's powers if he kills him/her.  He's slow, but insanely powerful, and to meet him would mean almost certain doom.<br/><br/>Once someone challenges and defeats the Master Geek, the dungeon starts crumbling, but the psycho-killer still stalks you (unless you killed him before).<br/><br/><b>Goal</b><br/>The goal is to get the most prestige upon exiting the tower, getting prestige points for each treasure item collected, each artifact acquired, along with bonus points for the person who defeats the Master Geek and/or the psycho-killer.<br/><br/><b>Gameplay:</b><br/><br/>The players start outside of the tower, and walk inside to a lobby and a staircase leading upwards, where they may or may not encounter enemies.  These are all represented by cards.  The stairways/lobbies and tower corridors/rooms are represented by wider and larger cards, and each detail a special conditional effect that takes place with everyone who stays in the corridor/room/stairway/lobby, even if the conditional effect is &quot;this is just a normal room.&quot;  Some examples include rooms where battles are tougher in some way, rooms where each player's gender is changed, rooms where there's treasure lying everywhere, and a room where all the enemies are flying and thus are more difficult to fight.<br/><br/>The tower begins unexplored.  As players explore the tower, going up stairs and walking through the floors, a room/stairway/floor effect card is drawn and placed onto any unexplored space they walk into.  If a room is empty (void of monsters) upon entry, a new battle is triggered.<br/><br/>Battles are fought with a bit of luck combined with overall strength.  Each floor has a certain &quot;battle size&quot; (with certain rooms having increased battle sizes), which determine the number of monsters that can fight in any single battle.  Upon entering the previously mentioned empty room, players draw a number of encounter cards (which are smaller than the room cards) equal to the battle size of the floor/room they are on.  The encounter cards can include everything from the monsters themselves, to traps and curses that affect a character negatively, to positive boons, and any number of special training (which allows the characters to have a class analogous to the genre they are currently fighting in, or a DNA transformation that allows them to do something very similar with their &quot;race&quot; (includes standard fantasy races in floors 1-2, &quot;horror&quot; races like vampires and werewolves in floor 3, and so on...).  If a character draws the number of encounter cards required and ends up not having to fight a battle equal to the battle size of the room/floor, other players can add additional monsters to increase the battle up to the battle size.  Other players can also play cards to strengthen either side.  Multiple monsters add to each other's strengths, and special other cards allow players to add monsters beyond the maximum battle size.  Players can also negotiate another player's help if the other player is on the same floor.  Battles are fought by rolling a d12, and adding the result to each side's total strength.<br/><br/>If a monster is defeated, the player who is playing his turn may find a special floor artifact (each of which adds to a character's strength) if the monster was sufficiently powerful enough.  In order to enter the top floor, the players need a certain amount of artifacts from each floor below.  Monsters also drop loot, and players can pick up a certain amount of loot each turn.  Other players can also swerve in to raid a large loot pile.  Loot can include anything that could be considered treasure: equipment that add to character strength, free artifacts, temporary power-ups (like grenades and pixie dust), protection items, and items that are otherwise worthless but are value at high currency (totaled for points in the end).  If a player doesn't fight a battle in a room he's entered, he can draw additional encounter cards for future (or immediate) use.<br/><br/>Once a player has acquired a certain number of artifacts from each floor, he can enter the top floor, where the Master Geek resides.  Battles there are tougher than any other floor, and draw from the monsters that the players might have encountered previously on every other floor.  The players might also encounter the Master Geek himself, who's obviously a lot stronger than those tougher battles.  If a player manages to defeat him, the tower starts crumbling (one room/stairway is removed at the end of each player's turn), and the players' goal is to then escape the falling tower).<br/><br/>A twist is that there's an insanely powerful psycho-killer who's always stalking the strongest player (changing targets if that position is taken by another player).  He only moves 2 rooms per turn cycle (each player can always move 3), but if he catches you, it's very bad news.  It's very likely he'll kill the character <i>and</i> drain him of several artifacts (other monsters can kill you as well, but he's the one that'll probably have the easiest time doing it).  He's still stalking you once the tower starts crumbling, and very likely, he'll be standing between your characters and the exit.  If a player dies, they respawn at the entrance, but leave all their equipment and items as loot in the last room they were in (free for other players to raid, or to get lost in the crumbling of the tower at the end).<br/><br/>When all characters have exited the tower successfully after the defeat of the Master Geek, points are calculated, factoring in: 1) the amount of treasure/equipment a player has retained, 2) how many other players the player beat to the exit, 3) how many artifacts the player has acquired, 4) whether or not the player was the one to defeat the Master Geek, and 5) if the player defeated the Psycho.  Whoever is found to have the most points is the winner.<br/><br/>"}, "74971": {"poll": [], "name": "NHL Eastside Hockey Manager 2007", "videogamemode": ["Hotseat", "Local Multiplayer", "Network Multiplayer", "Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["Downloadable Windows Edition"], "average": "7.73333", "videogameseries": ["Eastside Hockey Manager"], "videogametheme": ["Sports - Hockey"], "usersrated": "3", "videogamedeveloper": ["Sports Interactive Limited"], "videogamegenre": ["Sports"], "videogameplatform": ["Windows"], "statistics": [], "videogamepublisher": ["SEGA Corporation"], "description": "From Wikipedia<br/><br/>NHL Eastside Hockey Manager 2007 is an ice hockey management simulation game in the Eastside Hockey Manager series.

It was released in 1998 for the Nintendo 64 and later re-released in 2008 for the Xbox Live Arcade.<br/><br/>The game is set in the fictional location of Spiral Mountain where a bear named Banjo and a bird named Kazooie live. Gruntilda the witch kidnaps Banjo's sister, Tooty, to steal her beauty via a transformation device. Banjo and Kazooie set out on a dangerous adventure to rescue Tooty.<br/><br/>It was announced at Microsoft's E3 2008 press conference that Banjo-Kazooie would be made available for download on Xbox Live Arcade in the future. This version would feature increased screen resolution and minor graphical refinements. Properties of Nintendo have been removed throughout the game. For example, the animated Nintendo 64 logo is absent from the opening sequence, while the Nintendo company logo on Mumbo's xylophone in the introduction was replaced by the Microsoft Game Studios logo. The Game Boy that Banjo plays in the file select menu remains, but the Game Boy start up sound heard when the file is highlighted is removed. Characters who have appeared in other Nintendo-published games are unchanged, including Bubblegloop Swamp's Tiptup and Click Clock Wood's Gnawty the Beaver. On its website, Rare revealed that the port would be handled by 4J Studios. The game was released on Xbox Live Arcade on 3 December 2008 for 1,200 Microsoft Points. It was also released as a preorder bonus for Banjo-Kazooie: Nuts &amp; Bolts on 12 November 2008.<br/>Among new adjustments made to the game is the ability to permanently collect musical notes. Individual notes are saved on collection, whereas the original Banjo-Kazooie only saved the highest score. Bottle's hidden jigsaw puzzle game features sequences showing areas from different levels.
