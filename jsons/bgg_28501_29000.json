Anyone attenting RECON in Orlando is welcome to stop by the Flaming Monkey Games booth for a quick demo.  :)<br/><br/>OPORD is a game designed specifically to allow players to experience the sensation of launching a coordinated combined arms attack.  The game challenges a player with modern land warfare based upon existing tactical doctrine at the battalion level, but condensed in such a way as to make the make exiting and playable.  Players develop and execute operations to affect a coordinated tactical victory over their opponent.  To win, a player will have to successfully execute the instructions on his Mission Card while keeping the opponent from doing likewise.<br/><br/>In modern warfare, there is no shoot, maneuver sequence, as all shooting and maneuvering is simultaneous.  This is a key difference between modern warfare and that of WWII, and thus a main component of OPORD.  Movement is continuous, and shooting is sustained.  This is a key concept built into the OPORD game engine.  The variable turn sequence forces tactical forethought beyond the old &ldquo;my turn, your turn&rdquo; design mentality, and as a result players get a sense of fluidity of motion throughout the game.<br/><br/>Another key aspect of OPORD is the mission card driven objectives.  Players are not playing to slay each other&rsquo;s armies, since this is akin to senseless banzai charges with no real aim other than to roll dice.  Rather, the game is set around typical &ldquo;real world&rdquo; sorts of missions that soldiers are given to accomplish.  Seize this hill, secure this route, recon in force here, set up a defense there&mdash;all of these are typical missions you&rsquo;ll see in your mission cards.  And like the real world, you job is to use your troops and support elements to accomplish the mission.<br/><br/>In short, OPORD is a game that very closely relates the gaming experience to that of a real life Battalion Commander but in a fun way.  Receive your orders, allocate your troops and resources, design your plan, execute your plan, and complete the mission.<br/><br/>A typical turn.  Both players dice for initiative and turn sequence.  Initiative is obvious, winner goes first.  Sequencing dice determines the player's turn sequence.  Sequencing can be shoot/move/fight or move/shoot/fight.  the initiative winner goes first in the first two phases, while in the third phase &quot;fight&quot; all combat is simultaneous.  Movement variables are factored into the terrain boards, so there is no worry about modifiers for moving.  In combat, units shoot/fight collectively if in the same sector, or individually if in separate sectors.  Essentially both players dice (attack dice for phasing player, defend dice for non-phasing).  The interactive nature of every phase of every turn means no players are passive, which gives both a sense of fluidity.  Results are based upon combat dicing.  Units can be depleted, eliminated, or forced to withdraw.  The object of the game is to accomplish your mission and deny the enemy his.  While there are some mission cards that are all out attacks, most of the missions require you to combat in support of your own mission or to deny the other's.<br/><br/>Terrain boards are modular, so there is no limit to the size map one can create.

It was an attempt to immediately and dramatically seize the leadership of General Mohammad Farrah Aideed&rsquo;s Habr Gidr, which was in conflict with UN forces being supported by the US. What was planned as a lightning raid soon escalated into a decisive, bitter and costly two-day battle. The aftermath led to the withdrawal of US and UN forces in Somalia and the consolidation of Aideed and Habr Gidr power. It was the most intense fighting the US military had seen since Vietnam. The course of the events has become familiar through the film based on Mark Bowden&rsquo;s Black Hawk Down. For the Somalis the battle is remembered as &ldquo;Malinki Ranger&rdquo; which translates into English as &ldquo;Day of the Ranger&rdquo;. As has usually been the case Post Cold-War the fighting in Somalia was not about ideology but about Aideed and his Habr Gidr faction. In a war about an individual, seizure raids by SOF become strategic operations. Fittingly, it was also a conflict that pitted Aideed&rsquo;s strategy of attrition against SOF tactics of raiding.<br/><br/>This is a very simple two player simulation of the October 3, 1993 firefight between Task Force Ranger and the Habr Gidr Clan in Mogadishu, Somalia. Each player controls either Task Force Ranger or the Habr Gidr Clan. The use of the title Day of the Rangers refers to the Somali name for the fight-&rsquo;Malinki Ranger.&rsquo; The object of the game is to amass as many victory points as possible, the winner gains the most points, however the victory conditions set up to provide a balanced scenario outcome.<br/><br/>Game Files Direct Download: LINK<br/><br/>"}, "28695": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic195554.jpg", "poll": [], "boardgamedesigner": ["David Hiley"], "statistics": [], "yearpublished": "2004", "maxplayers": "2", "age": "12", "boardgamepublisher": ["King\u2019s College"], "maxplaytime": "0", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic195554_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "0", "boardgamecategory": ["Print & Play", "Wargame", "World War II"], "description": "When Hell Froze Over is an operational level simulation of the Soviet counter-offensive around the city of Stalingrad in November 1942.

You must develop, build, and establish your industries and network so that you can capitalize demand for iron, coal and cotton. The game is played over two halves: the canal phase and the rail phase. To win the game, score the most victory points (VPs), which are counted at the end of each half. VPs are gained from your canals, rails, and established (flipped) industry tiles. Each round, players take turns according to the turn order track, receiving two actions to perform any of the following:<br/><br/><br/>    Build an industry tile<br/>    Build a rail or canal<br/>    Develop an industry<br/>    Sell cotton<br/>    Take a loan<br/><br/><br/>At the end of a player's turn, they replace the two cards they played with two more from the deck. Turn order is determined by how much money a player spent on the previous turn, from lowest spent first to highest spent. This turn order mechanism opens some strategic options for players going later in the turn order, allowing for the possibility of back-to-back turns.<br/><br/>After all the cards have been played the first time (with the deck size being adjusted for the number of players), the canal phase ends and a scoring round commences. After scoring, all canals and all of the lowest level industries are removed for the game, after which new cards are dealt and the rail phase begins. During this phase, players may now occupy more than one location in a city and a double-connection build (though expensive) is possible. At the end of the rail phase, another scoring round takes place, then a winner is crowned.<br/><br/>The cards limit where you can build your industries, but any card can be used for the develop, sell cotton or build connections actions. This leads to a strategic timing/storing of cards. Resources are common so that if one player builds a rail line (which requires coal) they have to use the coal from the nearest source, which may be an opponent's coal mine, which in turn gets that coal mine closer to scoring (i.e., being utilized).<br/><br/>Brass: Lancashire, the 2018 edition from Roxley Games, reboots the original Warfrog Games edition of Brass with new artwork and components, as well as a few rules changes:<br/><br/><br/>     The virtual link rules between Birkenhead have been removed.<br/>     The three-player experience has been brought closer to the ideal experience of four players by shortening each half of the game by one round and tuning the deck slightly to ensure a consistent experience.<br/>     Two-player rules have been created and are playable without the need for an alternate board.<br/>     The level 1 cotton mill is now worth 5 VP to make it slightly less terrible.<br/><br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": ["Eagle-Gryphon edition", "Eagle-Gryphon Games Deluxe Edition", "English edition 2017", "Fred Distribution Second Edition First Printing", "Pegasus edition", "Second Edition Second Printing", "Warfrog first edition", "Wargames Club Publishing Chinese first edition", "White Goblin Games Dutch/French edition"], "average": "8.0133", "name": "Brass: Lancashire", "videogamebg": ["Brass"], "playingtime": "180", "boardgamemechanic": ["Hand Management", "Route/Network Building"], "age": "14", "boardgameexpansion": ["201381", "138329"], "usersrated": "10746", "boardgameaccessory": ["Brass: Metal Coins"], "boardgamesubdomain": ["Strategy Games"], "boardgamefamily": ["Cities: Manchester", "Country: England"], "boardgamepodcastepisode": ["#44: Anachrony six-pack review and on tap; Fugitive; Valeria Card Kingdoms; Veggie Garden", "BGTG 84 - Martin Wallace games (Brass, Tinner's Trail, Byzantium)", "BGTG 97 - All About Brass (with Stephanie Kelleher)", "clp047 \u2013 cubelove podcast \u2013 cubebrawl Brass vs Age of Industry", "Ep 46 Board With Life", "Episode #40 - Top Ten Route-Building Games", "Episode 09 - Online Gaming", "Episode 11 - For Shame!", "Episode 14 - Brass and Martin Wallace", "Episode 15: Survive: Escape from Atlantis!, Trading Places, and Cardinal Quest", "Episode 18 - Your Mileage May Variant", "Episode 23 part 1: Mars, Tsuro and Planetarium", "Episode 25 - Kickstarting the Habit", "Episode 34 - Top 50, Picks 10-1", "Episode 4 - More Than Two Need Not Apply", "Episode 42 -- It's Not Your Game, It's Our Deficiency", "Episode 44 - Bruxelles 1893 Review", "Episode 48 -- De-icing and the Redemption of Humanity", "Episode 49 :: Vast Review + Watch it Played &amp; The Secret Cabal", "Episode 4: The one about Mechs vs. Minions, the use of apps, and punishing difficulty", "Episode 51- Terra Mystica and Top 3 Games", "Episode 9 \u2013 Brass", "ET68: Los Tres Tenores: Porfirio, Gurney y Wallace", "Garrett's Games 481 - Meeplefest Night 2, Part 3", "Heavy Cardboard Episode 39 \u2013 Top 50 Favorite Games of Right Now", "Heavy Cardboard Episode 52 &ndash; Amanda&rsquo;s Top 50 &amp; Edward&rsquo;s Top 50", "I've Been Diced! episode 71: Mutants, game studies, and 2015 in review", "Ludology Episode 46 - Getting Down to Brass Tracks", "Review #30: Brass", "The Game Pit: Episode 40 - Council Chamber Mega Review of 2014 with Top 5s", "The Good, The Board and the SPECIAL EPISODE!!", "Vox Republica 108: 2016 Predictions", "What Did You Play This Week Podcast Thing Week 85!"]}, "28721": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic196066.jpg", "poll": [], "boardgamedesigner": ["Jeff Siadek"], "statistics": [], "yearpublished": "2007", "maxplayers": "8", "boardgameartist": ["Tegre Layne"], "boardgamepublisher": ["Gorilla Games"], "maxplaytime": "120", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic196066_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "120", "boardgamecategory": ["Expansion for Base-game", "Science Fiction", "Space Exploration"], "description": "This expansion/mini-campaign lets the characters play two different sides.

It is also very important to not let the right moment to transfer goods to the vessels pass, because the fleet will leave the harbor when the storage space is full and the winds are helpful.

An ordinary pack is used, from which the eight of diamonds has been removed, and a special round board in the form of eight compartments, named respectively Pope-Joan, Matrimony, Intrigue, Ace, King, Queen, Knave and Game (King, Queen and Knave are sometimes omitted). Each player &ndash; any number can play &ndash; contributes a stake, of which one counter is put into the divisions Ace, King, Queen, Knave and Game, two into Matrimony and Intrigue, and the rest into Pope-Joan. This is called &quot;dressing the board.&quot; The cards are dealt round, with an extra hand for &quot;stops,&quot; i.e. cards which stop, by their absence, the completion of a suit; thus the absence of the nine of spades stops the playing of the ten. The last card is turned up for trumps. Cards in excess may be dealt to &quot;stops,&quot; or an agreed number may be left for the purpose, so that all players may have an equal number of cards. If an honor or &quot;Pope&quot; (nine of diamonds) is turned up, the dealer takes the counters in the compartment so marked. Sometimes the turning-up of Pope settles the hand, the dealer taking the whole pool. The Ace is the lowest card, the King the highest. The player on the dealer's left plays a card and names it, the player who has the next highest then plays it, till a stop is played, i.e. a card of which no one holds the next highest. All Kings are of course stops, also the seven of diamonds; also the cards next below the dealt stops, and the cards next below the played cards. After a stop the played cards are turned over, and the player of the stop (the card last played) leads again. The player who gets rid of all his cards first takes the counters in &quot;Game,&quot; and receives a counter from each player for every card left in his hand, except from the player who may hold Pope but has not played it. The player of Ace, King, Queen or Knave of trumps takes the counters from that compartment. If King and Queen of trumps are in one hand, the holder takes the counters in &quot;Matrimony&quot;, if a Queen and Knave, those in &quot;Intrigue&quot;, if all three, those in the two compartments; if they are in different hands these counters are sometimes divided. Unclaimed stakes are left for the next pool.

In the 3 player game, 2 players compete for the most Glory as the Spartans, and in a 4 player game, 2 players also compete as the Persians for the most Spartan kills.<br/><br/>At the start of the game, the battle forces (represented by round cardboard Units) are already lined up and ready to fight at the border of the Hot Gates. Each time a Persian Unit dies, the Spartans score Glory Points on the Glory Track that surrounds the board. Spartan Units die permanently, while most defeated Persian Units can enter the game again as reinforcements.<br/><br/>The Object of the Game for the Spartans is to score 100 Glory (or 50 Glory if there are 2 Spartan players). The Object of the Game for the Persians is to wipe out the Spartans before they can achieve their Glory, or to delay the Spartans long enough for Ephialtes to reach the end of the Goat Path (6 rounds of play). If there are 2 Persian Players, then the player with the most Spartan kills wins this game.<br/><br/>The game uses cards and dice to simulate the action from the film. Spartan Heroes include Leonidas, Stelios, the Captain, Dilios, and Astinos. Persian Leaders include Xerxes, the Uber Immortal, and the Persian Generals.

This game was designed in 1997, printed in one edition of 1,000 copies and sold in &ldquo;head&rdquo; shops in Canada, Hawaii and Seattle. Press releases stated that it cost the two men behind the project about $50,000 Canadian to get the game to market. The reviewers' copy, numbered 106/1000 and signed by the designer, was found in a thrift shop for $3.99.<br/><br/>Play is divided into three phases, corresponding to the three growing seasons. The length of the game is derived from the number of Seasonal Cards, which is adjusted according to the number of players in the game. Each player starts with a car, six Plant tokens and $9,000 cash.<br/><br/>Each player-turn a player turns over one Seasonal Card and two &ldquo;Daily Grind&rdquo; cards. He moves (moving costs money, a player can go as far as he wants to spend) to a location and sets up grow-ops.<br/><br/>Indoor operations require periodic rent and the investment of Equipment and Plant tokens. Yields are smaller but come every turn, and are measured in salable ounces or new Plant Tokens to start other operations. Indoor operations are usually less risky unless someone &ldquo;rats you out&rdquo; for a quick $3,000.  Outdoor operations are set up in spring or summer. They do not need rent or equipment but are subject to the depredations of deer, rabbits, wandering hikers or police helicopters. Outdoor operations are harvested once per game, in the autumn, and players have to travel to the location to do the harvesting themselves &ndash; so, depending on where you and the other players are, you may lose some crop.<br/><br/>Between seasons players pay bills and rent, and may buy or sell equipment. At the end of the game (when all the Seasonal Cards have been turned up), players calculate the value of all Equipment and harvested outdoor Plants, and any salable ounces (a handy price table is supplied if you are too zonked to do the multiplying yourself). Players then pay all outstanding bills, loans, and fines. The winner is the one with the most cash on hand.<br/><br/>This would be an unremarkable farming-type game, if not for the illegal nature of the crop. This frames the rather small amount of player interaction (which is mostly limited to ratting out other players for a quick buck, or negotiating commissions for other to sell or harvest dope for you at locations where you aren&rsquo;t), the random disasters that can befall players through the Daily Grind deck, and the pro-legalization rhetoric found throughout the rules. The rest of the game is about investing funds and taking risks &ndash; it might as well be about growing Swiss chard.<br/><br/>"}, "28846": {"boardgamedesigner": ["Hannelore Wernhard"], "poll": [], "name": "Magic Treasure and Sunshine Game", "playingtime": "15", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": ["Storytelling", "Tile Placement"], "yearpublished": "1987", "usersrated": "1", "maxplayers": "4", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic198497_t.jpg", "average": "6", "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["Selecta Spielzeug"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic198497.jpg", "maxplaytime": "15", "boardgamecategory": ["Children's Game"], "age": "4", "minplaytime": "15", "description": "The Magic Treasure and Sunshine Game are, in fact, two games using the same colorful tiles.<br/><br/>In Magic Treasure, each player picks up one of the tiles that spirals toward the treasure.

The only up-side for the German was their keen ability to multitask with weakened forces. The Russians had their own set of problems. The onslaught had created directional problems as their armies approached the Vistula River. Because of this, their strength was divided. Many forces were ordered to seize bridgeheads across this key river south of Warsaw. Others were ordered to move along the Vistula north to Warsaw, still others, simply advance westward. The Russian forces were fast approaching the end of their supply chain after advancing hundreds of miles. Their tanks had also taken a toll from combat and breakdowns. All units had arrived in the area of Warsaw in a tired and weakened state.<br/><br/>The main reason for the Polish uprising was to seize the bridges and portions of Praga, the east part of the city east of the Vistula.

Each turn represents 6 months of real time (12 turns in game) and is broken down into Event, Operations, and Administrative phases.<br/><br/>The wooden blocks represent the major military formations that took part in the war generally depicted as Spanish field armies, French divisional and corp sized formations, Anglo-Portuguese divisions, and British expeditionary forces. Leaders include Wellington, Moore, Soult, and even a special guest appearance by Napoleon himself. Special blocks include Major guerrilla formations, The Lines of Torres Vedras, Popham's Naval Squadron, and key fortress garrisons.<br/><br/>A set of 30 event cards allows for random events, historical chrome, and political background.

It simulates not only the (narrow-gauge) railroads in that area, but also mines and other plants. Mining in the Harz mountains suffered a major crisis in the end of the 19th century and the theme of the game is to end this crisis by connecting the mines and other plants to the railroad network - and of course by proper management of the 7 public railroad companies, 15 private mining companies, and up to 5 public mining companies.<br/><br/>1873 has a bunch of fundamental differences from the usual 18xx game, which makes it one of the more distant members of the family (most prominent are the totally different systems of train operations, route determination, and revenue calculation).<br/><br/>---<br/><br/>The game presents an interesting dynamic. Mines are static and need rails to move product.<br/><br/>The game starts with 15 independent mines struggling with horse drawn delivery. Rails are just beginning to extend track through the difficult terrain with weak and puny engines hardly better then than horse drawn wagons.  What do you invest in? The rails or the mines?<br/><br/>Soon however some mines are connected and the profits begin to roll in. But not very efficiently for the mines as they are too fragmented and cannot get good prices for their product. The mines then join forces into mining companies. The mining companies pay better then the independent companies but have limited capital. Do you continue to reap Okay revenues or take it public. Public mining companies move quickly to acquire additional mines from their owners who reap huge profits.<br/><br/>New rail companies are also forming but have to struggle with purchasing routes and difficult terrain.

The game is conducted in a flat circle of approximately 20 feet (6 metres) or larger. The only equipment required (aside from materials for tracking bets) is two coins (by tradition pre-decimal pennies), and a flat piece of wood called the &quot;kip&quot; approximately 8 inches in length which has holes carved in it to fit the coins neatly but loosely enough for the coins to come out when tossed.<br/><br/>The game is run by a &quot;boxer&quot;, who calls the first &quot;potato&quot; (one of the players around the circle) in to toss the coins. The spinner wagers an amount of their choice on either &quot;heads&quot; or &quot;tails&quot;. Other players around the ring can then also bet on either &quot;heads&quot; or &quot;tails&quot;. .<br/><br/>Once all bets are taken, the boxer calls &quot;no more bets&quot;, and the player tosses the coins in the air using the kip. To be a valid throw, they must go above the head height of the spinner, be rotating sufficiently and land entirely in the ring - if they do not the boxer calls &quot;barred&quot; and the throw is retaken. Ideally the call must occur before the coins settle.<br/><br/>If the coins land both on the same face, the round ends and non-spinning player's bets are paid off, with people who bet on the same face as that landed winning. A new round of non-spinner bets is then taken before the spinner throws again.<br/><br/>If the coins come up with one tail and one head, the spinner spins again. If 5 &quot;odds&quot; come up, all players lose and a new spinner is selected.<br/><br/>If the spinner throws his nominated face three times before either 5 &quot;odds&quot; being thrown in a row, or a spin with both coins being the opposite face, the spinner wins and is paid at 7.5 to 1 (in most modern games).<br/><br/>"}, "28527": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic209028.jpg", "poll": [], "boardgamedesigner": ["Nick Bentley"], "statistics": [], "yearpublished": "2007", "maxplayers": "2", "age": "0", "boardgamepublisher": ["(Self-Published)", "(Web published)"], "maxplaytime": "15", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic209028_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "15", "boardgamecategory": ["Abstract Strategy", "Print & Play"], "description": "Odd is a simple abstract game for 2 players, with stones of 2 colors, typically played on a hexagonally tiled board with 5 cells on each edge (though it can be played on almost any tiling).
