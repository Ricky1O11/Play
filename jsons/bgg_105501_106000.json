A century ago or more, when the town of Cholagadi was just a frontier fort on the coast, Madaro-Shanti was the most powerful city-state in the entire Ambicuaria Jungle.  Its citizens were highly advanced in the arts of magic, and even retained some vestiges of magical quasi-technologies perhaps more ancient than humankind itself.  Their prosperity made for jealous enemies, none more covetous than the powerful and sorcerous Kiengaa Tribe of the deep jungles.  The Kiengaa plotted against Madaro-Shanti, making dark pacts with the monstrous ape-centaurs known as the Borsin, and with the monkey-faced, snake-like monsters known as the Hanu-Naga.  Once this terrible, unnatural army was gathered, the Kiengaa and their allies laid siege to Madaro-Shanti itself.<br/><br/>As the walls of Madaro-Shanti fell, and the invaders swarmed into the city, the high priest of the city closed himself within the royal shrine, praying to all the gods for intervention. Yet none of the gods answered his prayers until the last &ndash; and that was Ojala, whom the people of Madaro-Shanti knew as a god of evil and treachery.  A deadly bargain was struck that night, and true to his promise, Ojala caused a horrible wasting disease to strike the besieging army.  But the full extent of the evil god&rsquo;s treachery became clear when the surviving people of Madaro-Shanti themselves began to succumb to the same disease which had slain their enemies.  Within a fortnight, all the people of Madaro-Shanti had either died of the plague or scattered into the depths of the predator-filled jungle.<br/><br/>In only a few years, the city was overgrown by the jungle and fell into ruin, but the magical disease was to have one final consequence. Not only did the contagion affect the Kiengaa and the Madaro-Shanti &ndash; it also infected the mind of a powerful nature-spirit that inhabited the surrounding jungles. The nature-spirit Cho-Odaa, driven mad by the disease and hungry for vengeance against all humankind, has discovered the means to exact a terrible reckoning.<br/><br/>"}, "105507": {"statistics": {}, "name": "Hydrophobia: The Little Frog Who Can't Swim", "videogamemode": {"2149": "Single-Player"}, "videogameversion": {"119847": "Flash edition"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1143032.jpg", "videogametheme": {"2471": "Animals"}, "usersrated": "1", "average": "7.75", "videogamegenre": {"2147": "Action"}, "videogameplatform": {"5084": "Web Browser"}, "poll": {}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1143032_t.jpg", "description": "User Summary<br/><br/>Control a frog, try to catch flies.

I have played in a couple of Fire In The East games, so I know it can be done. In fact, it seemed easier to play FITE by mail than face to face. This kit is the expansion of the various ideas people came up with during the last game. I prevailed upon John Astell to come up with a combat resolution system tc finish the air system that we developed so that the problem of multi-phased turns, patrol and interception attacks could be taken care off in one exchange. Not all the problems have been addressed with this kit, but in and of itself you can play by mail.<br/><br/>Personally I prefer using a third party, or gamemaster, but this system has been designed so that you need not to rely on anyone but the two sides to complete the game.

ELIZA operated by processing users' responses to scripts, the most famous of which was DOCTOR, a simulation of a Rogerian psychotherapist. Using almost no information about human thought or emotion, DOCTOR sometimes provided a startlingly human-like interaction. ELIZA was written at MIT by Joseph Weizenbaum between 1964 to 1966.<br/><br/>When the &quot;patient&quot; exceeded the very small knowledge base, DOCTOR might provide a generic response, for example, responding to &quot;My head hurts&quot; with &quot;Why do you say your head hurts?&quot; The response to &quot;My mother hates me&quot; would be &quot;Who else in your family hates you?&quot; ELIZA was implemented using simple pattern matching techniques, but was taken seriously by several of its users, even after Weizenbaum explained to them how it worked. It was one of the first chatterbots in existence.<br/><br/>Influence on games<br/><br/>ELIZA had an impact on a number of early computer games by demonstrating additional kinds of interface designs. Don Daglow wrote an enhanced version of the program called Ecala on a PDP-10 mainframe computer at Pomona College in 1973 before writing what was possibly the second or third computer role-playing game, Dungeon (1975) (the first was probably &quot;dnd&quot;, written on and for the PLATO system in 1974, and the second may have been Moria, written in 1975). It is likely that ELIZA was also on the system where Will Crowther created Colossal Cave (Adventure), the 1975 game that spawned the interactive fiction genre. Both these games appeared some nine years after the original ELIZA.<br/><br/>Response and legacy<br/><br/>There are many programs based on ELIZA in different programming languages. For example, in 1980, a company called &quot;Don't Ask Software&quot;, founded by Randy Simon, created a version called &quot;Abuse&quot; for the Apple II, Atari, and Commodore PCs, which verbally abused the user based on the user's input. Other versions adapted ELIZA around a religious theme, such as ones featuring Jesus (both serious and comedic) and another Apple II variant called I Am Buddha. The 1980 game The Prisoner incorporated ELIZA-style interaction within its gameplay.<br/><br/>George Lucas and Walter Murch incorporated an Eliza-like dialogue interface in their screenplay for the feature film THX-1138 in 1969. Inhabitants of the underground future world of THX would retreat to &quot;confession booths&quot; when stressed, and initiate a one-sided Eliza-formula conversation with a Jesus-faced computer who claimed to be &quot;Omm&quot;. David Lodge's novel &quot;Small World&quot; exploits the tendency to anthropomorphize in a series of scenes in which a lonely linguist typing on ELIZA as part of his research starts increasingly to confide a wide range of personal problems to the machine, with the climax coming when a colleague inserts a few actual statements of opinion into ELIZA's responses.<br/><br/>ELIZA was named after Eliza Doolittle, a working-class character in George Bernard Shaw's play Pygmalion.<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;ELIZA&quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "105583": {"statistics": {}, "name": "Rollerblade Racer", "videogamemode": {"2149": "Single-Player"}, "videogameversion": {"120096": "NA NES"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2036806.png", "videogametheme": {"2405": "Sports - Other"}, "usersrated": "0", "average": "0", "videogamegenre": {"2154": "Racing"}, "videogameplatform": {"4430": "NES"}, "poll": {}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2036806_t.png", "description": "In Rollerblade Racer, the player's goal is to win the &quot;super rollerblade challenge.&quot; This game was a budget video game with a suggested retail price of $19.99 in American dollars for the NES version.<br/><br/>When roller-skating went out of style with the 1970s, there was a huge void left in the what-to-do-on-Friday-night list of options.

It is designed to be played by one to four players, in turn. It is an emulation of a pinball machine, although it has a second, two-player mode.<br/><br/>The pinball machine rendered in Rollerball is composed of four screens, which, by proportion, would be about as long as two standard pinball tables if it were a real table. The graphics on two of the four screens are based on various aspects of the New York City skyline. The topmost screen (hereafter called the bonus screen) merely shows some clouds and a blimp. The second screen (the main screen) shows the top of the Empire State Building, while the third screen (intermediate) shows the lower skyline and the Statue of Liberty. The lowest (final) screen shows only a blue backdrop, representing the Ocean.<br/><br/>The alternate mode is a two-player game called Match Play. In this mode, a much smaller table, only one screen tall, houses a number of buttons and switches that lower the score of the player on that side by various amounts. Four sensors in the middle of the table will switch the scores of the two players whenever they all become lit. A slot machine is spun by the buttons on the outer walls, and its bonus is enacted by hitting the button on the top wall. The first player to lose all his or her points loses.<br/><br/>Two animals in the middle of each player's area show an emotion, from ecstasy to sadness, through neutral indifference, depending on that player's score and the score margin between the two players. In the Japanese version, the left player's animal is an elephant, and the right player's is a giraffe. In the English version, the giraffe was changed to a donkey, likely in reference to the Republican and Democratic U.S. political parties.<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;Rollerball (video game)&quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "105586": {"statistics": {}, "name": "Snooker", "videogamemode": {"2149": "Single-Player"}, "videogameversion": {"120101": "UK ZX Spectrum tape release"}, "average": "0", "videogametheme": {"2362": "Sports - Cue Sports"}, "usersrated": "0", "videogamegenre": {"2157": "Sports"}, "videogameplatform": {"4950": "ZX Spectrum"}, "poll": {}, "description": "User Summary<br/><br/>Slightly simplified version of the real Snooker sport, with only nine red balls on the table instead of fifteen.<br/><br/>"}, "105587": {"statistics": {}, "name": "Roger Clemens' MVP Baseball", "videogamemode": {"2422": "Local Multiplayer"}, "videogameversion": {"120106": "JP Game Boy"}, "average": "5.66667", "videogametheme": {"2360": "Sports - Baseball"}, "usersrated": "3", "videogamegenre": {"2157": "Sports"}, "videogameplatform": {"4422": "Game Boy"}, "poll": {}, "description": "Roger Clemens' MVP Baseball was a baseball videogame released in North America during the years of 1991 and 1992 for the NES, Game Boy, Super NES, and Sega Genesis.

The name dnd is derived from the abbreviation &quot;DND&quot; (D&amp;D) from the original role-playing game Dungeons &amp; Dragons, which was first published in 1974.<br/><br/>The dnd computer game was written in the TUTOR programming language for the PLATO system by Gary Whisenhunt and Ray Wood at Southern Illinois University in 1974 and 1975. Dirk Pellett of Iowa State University and Flint Pellett of the University of Illinois made substantial enhancements to the game from 1976 to 1985.<br/><br/>Origins<br/><br/>dnd was likely the third dungeon crawl game written for PLATO. The first such game, known as pedit5, was deleted just a few months after it was created. The second game, m199h, was created in a lesson unit (i.e., space on a fixed drive) reserved for foreign language instruction. It was similarly deleted as soon as the illicit program was discovered. dnd was the first PLATO lesson space created for the express purpose of being a dungeon game.<br/><br/>A similar game also named DND and using many of the unique features of the original PLATO dnd was written in BASIC by Daniel Lawrence for the PDP-10 and released around 1977. This second game was later reworked and re-released as Telengard.<br/><br/>The game<br/><br/>In dnd, a player would create a character and then venture into the multi-level Whisenwood Dungeon (a portmanteau of the authors' last names) in search of treasure and the famous 'orb'. The dungeon was populated by an assortment of monsters and treasures.<br/><br/>The game implemented many of the basic concepts of Dungeons &amp; Dragons.<br/><br/>Teleporters moved characters between dungeon levels (especially the Excelsior Transporter, which first appeared in dnd on PLATO). High level monsters, including a Golden Dragon that guards the Orb, are found at the end of each dungeon. Leaving the dungeon allows one to recuperate and regain spells and return later.<br/><br/>Version history<br/><br/>Subsequent revisions of the game added more dungeons, such as The Caverns and The Tomb, with different creatures guarding different treasures (such as the Grim Reaper guarding The Fountain), and the player had to obtain both The Orb and The Grail to win. Also, many different types of miscellaneous treasures were added over the years, with their icons added to the game's original graphical display.<br/><br/>Later PLATO games, such as avatar, oubliette, baradur, moria, dndworld, bnd, and sorcery, were heavily influenced by dnd (and each other) while adding innovative features of their own, from 1976 to 1979.<br/><br/>The game proved enormously popular on PLATO and continues to be played to this day on the NovaNET system and Cyber1. Other dungeon games mentioned in this article can be played online through the Cyber1 system (a restoration of a mid-1980s vintage PLATO system).<br/><br/>dnd version 5.4 and dnd 8 were both available on the Cyber1 system as of 10 December 2010. The games were restored from tape and brought up to current TUTOR language standards by Dirk Pellett.<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;Dnd (video game)&quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "105591": {"rpg": {"6175": "Outbreak: Undead"}, "poll": {}, "name": "April 2011: Non-Player Characters", "rpgproducer": {"50805": "Christopher De La Rosa"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1072215.png", "usersrated": "0", "rpgitemversion": {"120113": "PDF version"}, "average": "0", "statistics": {}, "rpggenre": {"28957": "Horror (Zombies)"}, "rpgcategory": {"2108": "Sourcebook (rules/options to enhance play)"}, "rpgseries": {"11727": "Free Content Friday"}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1072215_t.png", "description": "User summary:<br/><br/>Notes on the easy creation of believable NPCs.<br/><br/>"}, "105592": {"rpg": {"1297": "Old School Reference and Index Compilation (OSRIC)"}, "poll": {}, "name": "Storm over Skyreach", "rpgproducer": {"3": "(Uncredited)"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1089346.jpg", "usersrated": "1", "rpgitemversion": {"120114": "Third Printing"}, "average": "5", "statistics": {}, "rpggenre": {"961": "Fantasy"}, "rpgcategory": {"2084": "Scenario / Adventure / Module"}, "rpgseries": {"21548": "Pacesetter Adventure Modules"}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1089346_t.jpg", "description": "From the publishers website:<br/><br/>TM2 Storm over Skyreach Originally a tournament at Gen Con 1989, this adventure will challenge your players and your DMing skill.

Not in this naughty game of cards &ndash; in fact, you'll probably have to cheat in order to win.<br/><br/>In Mogel Motte you want to get rid of all the cards in your hand before anyone else. Each player starts the round with a hand of eight cards, with one player (the oldest) receiving the guard bug &ndash; which stays on the table throughout the game &ndash; and one card being turnd face-up to start a discard pile. The cards are numbered 1-5, with the majority of them having only numbers; some cards have special abilities that come into play when added to the discard pile or in a player's hand.<br/><br/>On a turn, a player places one card from her hand onto the discard pile; that card must be numbered exactly one higher or lower than the card on top of the discard pile. (The numbers wrap, so a 1 can be played on a 5 and vice versa.) If a player can't play a card, she draws one from the deck and her turn ends.<br/><br/>There's another way to rid yourself of cards, though: cheating! Throughout the round, you can make cards disappear by dropping them on the floor, hiding them up your sleeve and so on. You must keep your hand of cards above the table at all times, you can't vanish more than one card at once, and you can't rid yourself of your final card this way. The player with the guard bug &ndash; and only him! &ndash; can call out other players for cheating, and no one can cheat while the accusation is being resolved. If the accusation was false, the Guard must draw a card; otherwise the cheating player takes back the card she tried to lose, is given a card from the Guard's hand as additional punishment, and becomes the new Guard.<br/><br/>Cheating is a necessity as the &quot;Cheating Moth&quot; cards can't be played onto the discard pile, but must be disappeared via cheating. (The Guard, however, can play these cards as the Guard is not allowed to cheat.)<br/><br/>The action cards work as follows:<br/><br/><br/>    Ant: After an ant is played, everyone but the active player must take a card from the draw pile.<br/>    Cockroach: After a cockroach is played, everyone races to play an identically-numbered card on top of it. Only the fastest player gets to leave her card in place.<br/>    Mosquito: After a mosquito is played, everyone but the active player must slap the pile of cards. Whoever is slowest receives a card from the hand of all other players.<br/>    Spider: After playing this, give a non-Cheating Moth card from your hand to another player.<br/><br/><br/>When one player has no cards in hand, the round ends. All other players score 10 points for each Cheating Moth in hand, 5 points for each action card, and 1 point for each number card. After a number of rounds equal to the number of players, the game ends and the player with the lowest score wins.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "3", "boardgameversion": {"265133": "Chinese edition"}, "average": "6.53626", "name": "Mogel Motte", "playingtime": "30", "boardgamemechanic": {"2040": "Hand Management"}, "age": "7", "usersrated": "1249", "boardgamesubdomain": {"5498": "Party Games"}, "boardgamefamily": {"18511": "Drei Magier Ugly Animals"}}, "105594": {"videogame": {"105604": "10 Computer Hits 2"}, "statistics": {}, "name": "Super Pipeline II", "videogamemode": {"2409": "Hotseat"}, "videogameversion": {"338819": "Commodore 64 disk edition"}, "average": "0", "videogametheme": {"2466": "Other"}, "usersrated": "0", "videogamegenre": {"2147": "Action"}, "videogameplatform": {"5203": "Amstrad CPC"}, "poll": {}, "videogamecompilation": {"105604": "10 Computer Hits 2"}, "description": "User Summary<br/><br/>In this game the player has to race against the clock, or better: against the water flowing already through the pipe system, while the player repairs holes and completes the route.

In the shadow of the giants dwelled the trouping elves and their erstwhile goblin enemies, fighting and feasting and making sport of life. The coming of the golden men from the west sent the proud elves and vicious goblins into hiding, for they commanded powerful magics and built a grand city of metal and crystal. But the reach of the golden men exceeded their grasp, and within a few generations their city had fallen and sent its children into the valley as orphans, and the elves and goblins worked their vengeance on them until only a few bands of the golden men, as wild and savage as the beasts, still roam the Valley.

It is the game that launched Br&oslash;derbund software, and though little-known today, it was a forefather of modern space conquest games such as Spaceward Ho! and Master of Orion. Doug Carlston wrote Galactic Empire while working as a lawyer. After finishing the program Empire he left his job to begin work for Br&oslash;derbund.<br/><br/>Originally written for the TRS-80, Galactic Empire was also ported to the Apple II and the Atari 400/800. A Macintosh port was developed by Cary Torkelson, with permission from Doug Carlston.<br/><br/>Subsequent games in the Galactic Saga are Galactic Trader, Galactic Revolution, and Tawala's Last Redoubt.<br/><br/>The game navigation uses a list of planets with names beginning with a unique letter of the alphabet for easy access. The 'R' key is reserved for 'Return', and 'Q' for 'Quit.' The player has one fleet which travels from planet to planet, beginning with the home world 'Galactica.' Conquered planets can be taxed and are also a source for recruiting troops to support future conquests. Each planet has a technology level above or below Galactica standard, which makes it easier or harder to conquer. It takes time to travel between planets to collect taxes and troops to conquer new planets. The player has 999 years to take the galaxy.<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;Galactic Empire (Br\u00f8derbund video game)&quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>Game Manual<br/><br/>As commander of Galactica's Imperial Forces, your mission is to conquer and hold the 20 inhabited worlds of the Central Galactic System. Aboard the fleet flagship you are ably assisted by your senior officers and the ship's onboard computer. Computer Central contains star maps of the galaxy and a planetary directory. It also keeps track of all scout ships on missions and on the status of work orders for new star ships at your shipyards around the galaxy. Lieutenant Starbuck is your officer charged with responsibility for all scouting missions. Lieutenant Bayliss is the staff officer responsible for planetside activities. His duties range from enlisting new troops to collecting taxes to contracting for new ships for the fleet. Your navigator is Sergeant Kirman, and you also have aboard a medical doctor, Doctor Henderson, who is an expert in suspended animation techniques. <br/> This is important, for one immutable scientific fact stands between you and the empire you wish to carve out--no one yet has discovered the secret to faster-than-light travel. Even the tiny Central Galactic System is sixty-odd light years wide. Logistics have always been an important facet of any military campaign, and that has not changed. Careful planning is essential if you are to keep your fleet replenished as it moves throughout the galaxy. <br/> Because cryonics and high speed space travel stretch the average life span, you will have 1000 years to complete your mission. Except during periods of travel or hibernation, you will actually have about 4 minutes for each year of your command.<br/><br/>"}, "105630": {"videogame": {"106266": "Galactic Trilogy"}, "statistics": {}, "name": "Galactic Trader", "videogamemode": {"2149": "Single-Player"}, "videogameversion": {"120177": "US Apple II edition"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1073589.jpg", "videogameseries": {"11937": "Galactic Saga"}, "videogametheme": {"2511": "Business / Construction"}, "usersrated": "0", "average": "0", "videogamegenre": {"2158": "Strategy"}, "videogameplatform": {"4978": "Apple II"}, "poll": {}, "videogamecompilation": {"106266": "Galactic Trilogy"}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1073589_t.jpg", "description": "Game Manual<br/><br/>Peace has finally come to the war-torn Central Galactic System, united into a single federation by the Imperial Forces of Galactica (see Galactic Empire - from Broderbund Software). The end to the fighting has cost you your job as Commander of Galactica's Imperial Forces, but it has simultaneously opened up new opportunities in trade for the person with the vision and ambition to exploit them.  <br/>  <br/>You once commanded a fleet of hundreds of ships. Today you have only one. You led armies of millions a short year ago. Now you pilot your single ship alone, aided only by two loyal comrades who remember what you were and have faith in what you may become.  Navigator Kirman of your old starship refused an opportunity to join Galaco, the interplanetary rocket fuels cartel, and elected to come with you. Even more surprising, Computer Central, the heart of your starship, stuck by you. Perhaps its judgment has been clouded by emotions after all, as Major Bayliss alleged.  <br/>  <br/>The principles of trade are not difficult. The farther a product is from its world of origin, the greater its value. All one has to do is buy or trade for cargo, take them farther from their home world, and trade them for other commodities. In practice it is not that simple, of course. You don't know the place of origin of the products, at least at first, nor is anyone likely to tell you. Until you develop experience on each planet, you don't know the rates of barter there, and the locals will try to exploit your ignorance by fleecing you if they can. All your experience can be worthless, too, if you are so incautious as to ply one route too often, for the largest trading firms keep their ears open, and they have the economic muscle to deal you out of any route that appears too attractive.  <br/>  <br/>There are other problems as well. You will find that no trader will accept the coin of the realm except on Galactica. On every other planet, barter is the medium of exchange. Your credits are only good at the fuel depot, and even the cartel will barter for commodities if you are short of cash (they are particularly extortionate when they feel they have you over a barrel, however, so it is generally better to buy fuel with cash). Local rates of barter can be hard to discern, too. If a local trader thinks you are asking too much for part of your cargo, he may refuse to discuss barter of that item any further. That can be expensive, when one considers the cost of bringing those goods to his doorstep.  <br/>  <br/>Your most important cost consideration is fuel. The ship is powered by microscopic fusion modules, sold across the galaxy at the fixed price of 2 credits per millit. The amount of fuel you need for a journey depends both upon the total mass of ship and cargo and upon the distance to be traveled. Fortunately, Computer Central is an old hand at these calculations and can be relied upon to do much of the brain work.<br/><br/>"}, "105631": {"statistics": {}, "name": "Sky Fire", "videogamemode": {"2149": "Single-Player"}, "videogameversion": {"120179": "Worldwide downloadable Windows release"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1074671.jpg", "videogametheme": {"2514": "Flight"}, "usersrated": "0", "average": "0", "videogamegenre": {"2147": "Action"}, "videogameplatform": {"4977": "Windows"}, "poll": {}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1074671_t.jpg", "description": "User Summary:<br/><br/>Zombies are back again!

It appears to be the first space-themed strategy game sold for microcomputer systems. The game was originally written in BASIC for the Commodore PET, but later ported to other early home computer platforms including the TRS-80 and Apple II. The game was something of a success, leading to a string of successes for the company, notably the major &quot;hit&quot;, Temple of Apshai.<br/><br/>The playfield was a thirty-two high by sixty-four wide grid of possible locations. The map could contain ships, stacked on the same grid space if needed, as well as planets and other objects. The game was turn based, with the two players taking turns at the keyboard to enter their commands, which were then carried out simultaneously. Each player controlled one or more ships, and the game continued until one or both were destroyed, or escaped by flying off the playfield.<br/><br/>Ships were powered by a single energy source whose power had to be divided up among the many parts of the ship, including drives, shields and weapons. Each ship was armed with a beam weapon whose chance to hit a target was based on the target's size and the &quot;beam quality&quot; of the firing ship. The amount of damage caused by a hit was reduced with distance, making it primarily a short-range weapon.<br/><br/>In addition, ships were also armed with missiles or torpedos for long-range fire. Missiles would fly to a location in space relative to the ship after movement and then explode regardless if there was a target in that location. Torpedoes were fired in a particular direction (the eight cardinals) and would explode if they passed within two grid spaces of any other material object (everything except torpedoes). Some ships also included fighters equipped with missiles or torpedoes, which allowed spoiling attacks. Generally the Stellar Union ships had more missiles, and the Orion ships more torpedoes.<br/><br/>Additionally, ships were equipped with a tractor beam that allowed them to push or pull on material objects, allowing complicated strategies of pushing or pulling on opposing ships to throw off their aim. For instance, a torpedo aimed at a ship that was expected to be &quot;due left&quot; after the movement phase could be avoided by the target by pushing the opposing ship a few locations down. The distance a ship could be pushed or pulled was a relative measure of the strength of the beam and the mass of the target. This meant larger ships could spoil the aim of smaller torpedo boats using this method, while smaller ships would be better off simply using their drives to move themselves. Another useful strategy to use the tractor beam to quickly push fighters into range of their targets, at &quot;speeds&quot; their own engines could not achieve.<br/><br/>The game originally shipped on cassette, and required the users to type in the scenario and save it to a separate data tape before playing. The pre-rolled missions were outlined in a separate &quot;Battle Manual&quot;, which also included short stories introducing the game world and the individual missions. This process was greatly improved on the diskette versions, which had the games saved out as data files that could be loaded up by name. Users could also create their own scenarios using the separate &quot;BUILDER&quot; program, saving them to tape or disk.<br/><br/>The complex setup and requirement for two players was an obstacle to casual play, which led the programmers quickly release the single-player Invasion Orion. In this game the combined human forces faced the &quot;Klaatu&quot;, an extremely powerful alien race. The power of their ships made up for the basic AI the game used, which essentially consisted of the Klaatu ships driving directly at the humans, firing all the way.<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;Starfleet Orion&quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "105638": {"statistics": {}, "name": "Simple 1500 Series Vol. 52: The Pro Wrestling 2", "videogamemode": {"2422": "Local Multiplayer"}, "videogameversion": {"120201": "JP PlayStation version"}, "average": "0", "videogametheme": {"2375": "Sports - Wrestling"}, "usersrated": "0", "videogamegenre": {"2159": "Fighting"}, "videogameplatform": {"4433": "PlayStation"}, "poll": {}, "description": "User Summary<br/><br/>Simple 1500 Series Vol. 52: The Pro Wrestling 2 is the sequel to Yuke's 1999 Japanese professional wrestling game Simple 1500 Series Vol. 22: The Pro Wrestling.<br/><br/>The Pro Wrestling 2 features two gameplay modes (Exhibition and Champion Road) and a Wrestler Edit mode.

It also was the first car racing game from Konami. The goal is to reach the finish line within the stages without running out of time, hitting other cars or running out of fuel (fuel is refilled by hitting a special type of car). The game also spawned two sequels in its time, Midnight Run: Road Fighter 2 in 1995 and Winding Heat in 1996, respectively.<br/><br/>Ports and Rereleases<br/>The game was later released for the MSX home computer system (1984), and Nintendo Entertainment System in Japan 1985 and Europe 1991, and followed the same format as the original. The game was included on Konami Arcade Classics in 1999 and on Konami Classics Series: Arcade Hits for the Nintendo DS. The arcade game was released for i-mode phones in Japan in 2005.<br/><br/>Road Fighter was made available on Microsoft's Game Room service for its Xbox 360 console and for Windows-based PCs on March 24, 2010.<br/><br/>Gameplay<br/>The first and second levels contain 4 courses, ranging from grassy plains to an over water bridge to a seashore and finally a forest area. In the arcade version, five stages were contained. Pressing the 'A' button raises the player's speed to around 196 Kmph while pressing the 'B' button skyrockets the speed to 400. The player has a limited amount of fuel and can earn more by touching special multi-colored cars. If the player crashes into any other car or slips on occasionally appearing patches of oil, the car will spin out and may crash into the side railings, causing a loss of 5-6 fuel units. The NES version has a total of 6 types of cars, 1 yellow and red, three blue and one truck. Yellow cars will travel along a straight line and occur in large numbers. Red cars are a little less likely to appear, but they will change the lane they are travelling in once to get in the way of the player. Blue cars vary in the way they change their lane.<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;Road Fighter&quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "105697": {"statistics": {}, "name": "Atomic City Adventures: The Case of the Black Dragon", "videogamemode": {"2422": "Local Multiplayer"}, "videogameversion": {"120292": "PC Atomic City Adventures: The Case of the Black Dragon"}, "average": "0", "videogametheme": {"2264": "Science Fiction"}, "usersrated": "0", "videogamegenre": {"2161": "Action Adventure"}, "videogameplatform": {"4977": "Windows"}, "poll": {}, "description": "From the Publisher's Website<br/><br/>This futuristic world features flying cars, friendly robots, and inhabitants that live in tall cities of glass and steel.

Players strongly resembling real-life stars of the time: J&uacute;lio C&eacute;sar da Silva, Jean-Pierre Papin, Peter Schmeichel, Franco Baresi, Ronald Koeman, Tomas Brolin, Dennis Bergkamp, or Gabriel Batistuta are present in the game. Tecmo also introduced its own characters, like Brazilian ace Signori, ultra-fast forward Alcion, and world class goalkeeper Savi\u010devi\u0107, among others.<br/><br/>The game's story mode focuses mainly on Tsubasa's Serie A season with Lecce and international campaign with Japan. In addition, other characters like Kojiro Hyuga, Genzo Wakabayashi, Lui Napole&oacute;n, Carlos Santana or Karl-Heinz Schneider have their less-expanded scenarios as well. The competitions in the game are based on real major international tournaments, like Asian Cup, Copa Am&eacute;rica and World Cup. In the All-star mode, the players can create new characters, arrange a friendly match (with all the teams, or by composing an own squad from all the players available in the game), and create a league with national or club teams.<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;Captain Tsubasa 5: Hasha no Shogo Campione&quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "105748": {"statistics": {}, "name": "Discovery: In the Steps of Columbus", "videogamemode": {"2149": "Single-Player"}, "videogameversion": {"120380": "Discovery (DOS)"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3567022.jpg", "videogametheme": {"2345": "Historical"}, "usersrated": "1", "average": "6.5", "videogamegenre": {"2158": "Strategy"}, "videogameplatform": {"4415": "Amiga"}, "poll": {}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3567022_t.jpg", "description": "Discovery is a historical simulation involving discovery and conquest with ships exploring the world.

This game is also notable for having an 8-bit rendition of Another One Bites the Dust by the English rock band Queen as one of the music tracks in the game.<br/><br/>There are two modes of play; Regular Game mode, and Alternative Game mode.<br/><br/>Regular Mode<br/>In Regular Game mode, you can either play in teams, or against the CPU. If you play against the CPU, or if you play with only two people, then the game is played by completing a series of minigames, every point scored revealing a part of a picture, and after the minigame is over, you must guess what the picture is, based on the amount you've been able to reveal.<br/><br/>If you're successful in guessing what the picture is, then you can &quot;roll&quot; a virtual die, to decide how many spaces you may move along the &quot;board&quot;. The first person to reach the end of the board wins the game.<br/><br/>If you play in teams of 2 or more, then a &quot;designated drawer&quot; is chosen, and instead of the computer drawing a picture, you yourself draw a picture of something the computer has pre-decided upon (For example, 'snowmobile') using the controller, and if it is correctly guessed, the user must use the honor system to tell the game whether or not the answer was guessed correctly.<br/><br/>If your team guesses correctly, you may roll the virtual die, and proceed that number of spaces down the board. Whomever reaches the finish space first wins the game.<br/><br/>Alternative game mode<br/>Alternative Game Mode is played much the same way as &quot;Regular Game Mode&quot;, except instead of the Computer supplying an answer, the designated drawer does so himself, and both teams may guess instead of just the drawer's team. At the end of a round, the game asks which team was successful in guessing, and you may choose &quot;Nobody did&quot;, Team 1, Team 2, Team 3, or Team 4. If no one wins, then play moves on to the other teams designated drawer, and a new round begins. If a team guesses correctly, they may roll the virtual die, and proceed down the board.

The video game was a Japan-exclusive release for all versions except the NES version (which became the only North American release of the game and the series). In North America, Palamedes had to compete with Tetris and Dr. Mario for retail space and sales (because those three games were released around the same time as each other).<br/><br/>Gameplay<br/>Palamedes is a puzzle game requiring the player to match the dice they are holding to the dice on top of the screen. Using the &quot;B&quot; button, the player can change the number on his/her dice, then throw the dice using the &quot;A&quot; button when it matches the dice at the top of the screen, which wipes the target dice off the screen. The player can play in &quot;solitaire&quot; mode against the computer or another player, or &quot;tournament&quot; mode against AI opponents. There are six sides and numbers on the dice, making an attempt to match all the numbers on the screen and eliminating them a challenge.<br/><br/>Ports<br/>Ports of the game were published for the NES, MSX, FM-Towns and Game Boy by Hot-B. The Japan-only sequel, Palamedes 2: Star Twinkles, was released in 1991 for the NES by Hot-B.

The Japanese version was based on the manga series GeGeGe no Kitaro, but the game was changed to the generic &quot;Ninja Kid&quot; and all reference to Kitaro were removed for the American version. This game was followed by a sequel titled Gegege no Kitarou 2: Youkai Gundan no Chousen, which was released the following year only in Japan also by Bandai; however, this game was an RPG and its plot is unrelated to the original.<br/><br/>Gameplay<br/>Gameplay begins on an overhead map with several different arches. Each arch leads to a different side-scrolling mission, and the type of the mission can be determined by the shape of the arch. At the end of each mission, two doors will appear, one of which will return to the map, and the other of which will take to a vertically-scrolling tower with a mini-boss at the top (after defeating the mini-boss you are returned to the map). Also during each mission, items randomly appear on the screen. Some bonus items also give a temporary speed boost, or an owl that shows you which door leads back to the map (instead of the mini-boss tower). Once collected a scroll, it can be taken to the hut in the middle of the map to unlock the fortress and fight the map's boss. During the boss fight, if any whistles have been collected , the character can crouch in the far left corner of the screen to use a whistle to summon a familiar.<br/><br/>Japanese Version<br/>The original Japanese version is notably different from the American version. The main character is Kitar\u014d, and his main weapon is his hair rather than darts. His sub-weapons are a flying finger instead of shuriken, his vest instead of the feather, and a geta instead of a boomerang. All of these weapons function the same as the ones of the protagonist of the American version, Kyo; they just use different sprites. The fireball sub-weapon remains the same. Somewhat bafflingly, one level is inhabited by &quot;western&quot; film monsters like Frankenstein's Monsters and Count Dracula; the boss of said level is a Buckbaird. The scroll which unlocks the fortress is a crystal ball in the original version. The familiars are also different, being characters from the manga: the Pegasus was originally Nurikabe, the Eagle was Konaki Jiji, and the Mirror was Sunakake Babaa. Finally, a few of the minor enemies are different; most notably the &quot;Pirate Ninja&quot; found in some of the Guerilla Warfare levels was originally Nezumi Otoko, and Kitaro rides on Ittan Momen during the Dog Fight levels.<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;Ninja Kid&quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "105776": {"statistics": {}, "name": "Dreamcast Keyboard", "videogamehardwarecategory": {"2324": "Controller"}, "usersrated": "2", "average": "7", "videogamehwmfg": {"5360": "SEGA Corporation"}, "poll": {}, "videogamehwversion": {"120431": "Dreamcast Keyboard"}, "videogamehardware": {"4421": "Sega Dreamcast"}, "description": "User Summary<br/><br/>A standard 104 key keyboard for use with the Dreamcast.

Four levels are available initially; after they are completed, a fifth level is unlocked, followed by a sixth and final level. Each level contains a number (usually two) of mid-bosses known as &quot;middle ghosts&quot;; after a middle ghost is defeated, it turns into a small green ghost which can be captured for extra money by luring it over a ghost trap. Between levels, money can be used to buy powerups, such as a 3-way shot or recovery items.<br/>The Ghostbusters are down on their luck due to lack of ghost activity, when suddenly several calls begin to pour in from around the city, including the eventual reappearance of the Stay Puft Marshmallow Man (although dialogue indicates it is not the same one from the movie). After each case, a piece of a stone tablet is collected. The three Ghostbusters piece together the mysterious tablet, inadvertently opening a portal to &quot;the evil world&quot; and releasing a horde of ghosts. In the end, though, the Ghostbusters manage to defeat Janna, the God of Darkness, and retrieve a mystical gem from the evil world.

The goal of the game is to become king or queen; to do so the player must manage their city-state so that it may grow.<br/><br/>History<br/><br/>The game, by George Blank, first appeared in the December 1978 issue of SoftSide magazine, and was published by Instant Software for sale on tape cassette as a computer game for the Radio Shack TRS-80, the Apple II, TI 99/4,and the Commodore PET. It has been translated into many languages and has been ported to the Palm Pilot.<br/><br/>Gameplay<br/><br/>The game consists of yearly turns; each turn involves the allocation of grain and funds, attempting to grow the colony in both population and size. A ruler must ensure that sufficient grain supplies are available to feed his people; by distributing excess grain, a ruler can encourage more citizens to move into his city-state. However, often famine and rats cause grain reserves to diminish.<br/><br/>Funds can be spent to purchase more land, military forces, or various types of structures.

First, you have to deal with your serfs--good help is hard to come by you know. Then you have to worry about your grain harvests, building mills, and marketing your goods.<br/><br/>You also can't forget about leveling taxes, and setting the law of the land. Then there's the problem of being invaded, and dealing with the clergy (you'll love that).<br/><br/>In the end you'll find Santa Paravia to be a fun, mentally stimulating strategy game in which you balance the forces of nature, economics, soldiers, merchants, clergy, and your serfs to make your little kingdom the Paris of the Midwest, or something like that.<br/><br/>Features include: excellent graphics, strategy, and many hours of learning fun for all ages.

The Enterprise must protect a Federation supply fleet of transport tugs, and the commands can control everything from combat attack sequence programming and defensive modes on the ship's computer, to evasive action to energy flow from the reactors to the various engines and phaser banks.  Phasers, photon torpedoes and Starbases are provided for.
