To start the game, you assemble the frame pieces, which create a space large enough to hold 20 tiles. Players alternate placing tiles in the frame - each player places the tiles with his opponent's color on them. When finished there will be two empty spaces in the maze. Put an energy token on a every circle of its color, and each player starts with one energy token in their reserve. Trovers and guards are placed in opposite corners and the movement part of the game begins.<br/><br/>On your turn, you move all your pieces. Guards can move up to five spaces orthogonally, while trovers can move like guards but also diagonally.<br/><br/>Trovers are the only pieces that can pick up energy tokens - you can only collect your own color. Guards simply block your opponent's trover, though if he pays one energy token he can move by a guard. The tiles create a two-level maze, with ramps printed on the tiles to change between levels, and walls occasionally to force movement around them.

The goal in each deal is to accumulate sixty-six trick points, where the card values are A=11, T=10, K=4, Q=3, J=2.  The suit led does not need to be followed until the stock is closed or exhausted, at which point suit must be followed, the trick must be won if possible, and you must trump if you cannot follow suit.<br/><br/>Depending on the margin by which a player wins the deal, that player scores 1-3 game points.

Despite the simularity of names it is not idenical with the Hungarian game of kalabrias, which is a game for three or four players. There may have been a common ancestor, or possibly the game was taken to the New World by Central European immigrants and there bowdlerized version of kalabrias. (Exeter Books, 1984)<br/><br/>Klabberjass is played in the North American and Great Britain with the 32 card deck. (6s, 5s,4s,3s, and 2s removed from the standard 52 card deck.) The trump suit enjoys the strange ranking of the Jass genre: J 9 A 10 K Q 8 7. Non trump suit rank A 10 K Q J 9 8 7 as in the Skat-Pinochle family. Six cards are dealt to each player and a card is turned up. Non-dealer then begins a bidding round to first to accept the turn-up as trump. Or pass. If both pass on the turn-up card a second round is held. Here the non-dealer may take the bid by naming one of the other three suits or pass, dealer than may take the bid by naming the suit of throw in the hand. (Some allow for a bid of &quot;Schmeiss&quot; which means to the bidder will take the hand with the turn-up or the hand can be thrown in at the non-bidders discretion)<br/><br/>After bidding, the dealer deals three more cards to the hand. Then sequences are scored. For this purpose the cards revert back to their numeral rank. A sequence of three scores 20 and a sequence of 4 or more scores 50. tiebreakers are decided by rank. As I will describe later, it may make sense not to score in this round and you are not obligated to do so.<br/><br/>Non-dealer leads to first trick. A player must follow suit. If he cannot he must trump if able. If trump is lead he must play a higher trump if able. If he holds the King and Queen of trump he may announce &quot;Bella&quot; on play of the second card and score 50 points. Once again he may choose not to score for this.<br/><br/>After the cards are played, both score for the following cards won:<br/><br/>Jass (Jack of Trumps) 20 points<br/>Menel (9 of Trumps) 14 points.<br/>Any Ace 11 points<br/>Any 10 10 points.<br/>Any King 4 points.<br/>Any Queen 3 points.<br/>Any Jack 2 points.<br/>Last Trick 10 points.<br/><br/>If the the high bidder (The one who established trump) scores the highest, both sides score what they made. If if opponent scores higher he scores for both totals. This is why the high bidder who realizes he is not going to beat his opponent in this hand may decide not to score or &quot;Sink&quot; points during the hand. 500 points wins the round.<br/><br/>Prior to the onset of Gin Rummy, this was the most popular two handed game in the United States. It still holds a loyal following.<br/><br/>Klabberjass remains a popular two handed game in the United States. There are several variations in play and several house rules. It is very popular in New England and especially Hartford, Connecticut.<br/><br/>"}, "11641": {"boardgamedesigner": {"1496": {"name": "Brian Yu"}}, "poll": {}, "name": "Lemony Snicket's A Series of Unfortunate Events: The Catastrophic Card Game", "playingtime": "30", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": {"2004": "Set Collection"}, "yearpublished": "2004", "usersrated": "28", "maxplayers": "4", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic195768_t.jpg", "average": "4.81786", "statistics": {}, "boardgamepublisher": {"93": {"name": "Mattel"}}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic195768.jpg", "boardgameversion": {"248558": "First edition"}, "maxplaytime": "30", "boardgamecategory": {"1002": {"name": "Card Game"}}, "age": "8", "minplaytime": "30", "description": "The second game based on the popular children's books by Lemony Snicket.

A piece with 2 flags has strength 2 and can move up to two spaces&hellip; and I think the readers can guess the features of a piece with one flag on it&hellip;<br/><br/>Every player enters his units in the map from one side, and tries to win being the first to reach the opposite side with one of his units.<br/><br/>The combat system is quite original, and uses the &ldquo;bluffing bell&rdquo;. This is a little device similar to an hand-bell, containing two little 6-sided dices. Shaking the device makes the dices roll, and pressing the device on the table causes the dices to be blocked on their result. After the pressing of the &ldquo;bell&rdquo;, the player who is using it can pull it up and see the result, without showing it to other players. The player can repeat the shaking a number of times equal to the number of his flags involved in the combat, until he is satisfied (or wants to feign to be satisfied) by the result: at this point he can declare a result (obviously he can declare a number different from the real one!)<br/>The opponent can now accept the declared result, and then try to get and declare an higher number; elsewhere he can try to see the bluff&hellip;<br/><br/>Entering the central red square allows the player to aim an &ldquo;artillery shot&rdquo; to an enemy unit.<br/><br/>According to Alex Randolph&rsquo;s ludography compiled by Philippe Evrard, &ldquo;Due Secoli di Guerre&rdquo; has been published only in Italy by Editrice Giochi, and there is no report about editions in other countries.<br/><br/>"}, "11646": {"boardgamedesigner": {"3": {"name": "(Uncredited)"}}, "poll": {}, "name": "Piquet", "playingtime": "30", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": {"2004": "Set Collection"}, "yearpublished": "1534", "usersrated": "54", "boardgamefamily": {"24434": "Card Games: Outplay Games"}, "maxplayers": "2", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic210647_t.jpg", "average": "6.50278", "statistics": {}, "boardgamepublisher": {"171": {"name": "(Public Domain)"}}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic210647.jpg", "boardgameversion": {"153253": "Dal Negro Italian Edition"}, "maxplaytime": "30", "boardgamecategory": {"1002": {"name": "Card Game"}}, "age": "8", "minplaytime": "30", "description": "Piquet is a very old trick-taking card game for 2 players, reportedly invented by a M. Piquet during the Court of Charles II. It was well established in a form very similar to that used today in 1650 and remained the most popular game in France for many centuries, similar to Cribbage in the UK.<br/><br/>A 32-card deck ranking from ace to seven in the four suits is used (known universally as a &quot;Piquet Deck&quot;). A game consists either of 6 deals called a partie (in the Rubicon version) or to 100 points in the &quot;Cents&quot; version. Each player is dealt 12 cards, with 8 left as a talon.<br/><br/>Play consists of three distinct stages: (1) the exchange, (2) the declarations, and (3) trick play.  Winning requires skill at all three.<br/><br/>In the exchange phase, players may exchange one to five cards with the talon to improve their hand. Each player's discards are visible to them for the remainder of the game.  The declaration phase involves revealing melds for points (done in a formalized manner so as to reveal some but not all of one's cards). Declarable combinations include: the most cards of one suit; the longest run in a suit; and sets of the same rank, e.g. 3 kings, 4 aces.  The trick phase involves playing out the hand, with no trump.  Bonuses include taking most tricks, taking all the tricks, and scoring 30 points before the opponent declares.<br/><br/>The small deck combined with the large hands combined with the revealing of each other's cards gives Piquet play a different feel than many card games, somewhat more akin to a board game.  Part of the strategy of piquet is about controlling information: skillful players carefully determine what they will exchange and declare in order to keep secrets for another phase of the game, at the cost of points in another phase.<br/><br/>"}, "11647": {"boardgamedesigner": {"3": {"name": "(Uncredited)"}}, "poll": {}, "name": "The Big Book of Board Games", "playingtime": "0", "minplayers": "0", "boardgamemechanic": {"2078": "Point to Point Movement"}, "yearpublished": "1979", "usersrated": "2", "boardgamesubdomain": {"4666": "Abstract Games"}, "maxplayers": "0", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic276210_t.jpg", "average": "4.5", "statistics": {}, "boardgamepublisher": {"2576": {"name": "Troubador Press"}}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic276210.jpg", "boardgameversion": {"153926": "Troubador Press First Edition"}, "maxplaytime": "0", "boardgamecategory": {"1009": {"name": "Abstract Strategy"}}, "age": "0", "minplaytime": "0", "description": "The Big Book of Board Games is a 9&frac34;&quot;&times;12&frac12;&quot; softcover coloring book with fourteen classic games to color and play, including: The Royal Game of Ur, Nine Men's Morris, The Game of Goose, Snakes & Ladders, Chinese Checkers, Shove Ha'penny, Awithlaknannai, Backgammon, Gl\u00fcckshaus, Alquerque, Pachisi, Go-Bang, Asalto, and Senet.<br/><br/>ISBN: 0-89844-002-5<br/><br/>"}, "11648": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic542276.jpg", "poll": {}, "boardgamedesigner": {"712": {"name": "Jervis Johnson"}}, "statistics": {}, "yearpublished": "1993", "maxplayers": "2", "age": "10", "boardgamepublisher": {"26": {"name": "Games Workshop Ltd."}}, "maxplaytime": "30", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic542276_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "30", "boardgamecategory": {"1046": {"name": "Fighting"}}, "description": "Originally published by Games Workshop in White Dwarf 161 and now available to download on GW's Spanish site, Warmaster (no relation to the 2000 miniatures game) is a two-player board game that recreates the Emperor's attack on Horus's battle barge at the end of the Battle for Earth.<br/><br/>At the start of the game the Imperial player has no idea where Warmaster Horus is located and must search the ship to find him as quickly as possible.

The other Axis units are not usually as powerful as the German ones, though the Hungarian unit is good and there is a Romanian cavalry corps.<br/><br/>Soviet units are generally armies. Some of these are able to stand up to the Germans, but most cannot; while the Soviets start out with a very powerful army the first Axis turn is rough on the Red Army.  The Soviet player must place his or her forces carefully and choose the time and place for counter-attacks. The Soviet player does have the aid of fleets in both the Baltic and the Black Seas, allowing landings behind enemy lines and sometimes support in combat.
