Tiles are worth honey, which are used to buy more bears and play bonus cards, or royal jelly, which are used as victory points. As bears mine deeper in the mountain, the tiles will get more valuable, but also more difficult to mine. Players draw bonus cards into their hand at the end of each turn, which move tiles and bears around the mountain, and foil your opponent's plans.

In the &lsquo;world&rsquo; of Savage Worlds, the storyline is typically defined by the campaign setting or plot point campaign run by the GM.

The player then uses the Savage Worlds core rulebook, Companion books, and setting guides to translate that character concept and background into in-game mechanics. Pretty simple&hellip; but what do you do when you can't quite translate that character concept and background into the proper in-game mechanics?<br/><br/>Ultimate Characters Guide was designed to address that issue, and go quite a bit further. Why stop at player characters when a GM may have the same issue? Thus, Ultimate Characters Guide addresses PCs and NPCs (beasts, creatures, villains, humanoids, aliens, etc.) through a series of new options, new ideas, and new implementations of the same Savage Worlds mechanics.

Depending on the type of Journey you decide to have and how it relates to the other players will decide the outcome of the game.<br/><br/>Life Actions: In Journey of Existence your time is limited.

Dozens of Alices abound, and now they're taking sides and forming teams to see who can put the land back together best.<br/><br/>In Alicematic Heroes, you take charge of one of these teams, and you'll have a handful of Alices to use in your efforts. Alices come in five colors, with each player having a set of player boards in these five colors. On a turn, you first summon an Alice to your kingdom, playing that card from your hand onto the player board of the same color, but only if you can pay the cost in dream power; each Alice has a cost, and you must have at least this many dream cards (yellow) or be able to make up the difference by paying dream tokens. If you can, you immediately use the power &mdash; or Megalomania &mdash; of that Alice; if you can't, choose another card or lay an Alice face down as a commoner. Playing a commoner doesn't cost anything, lets you draw another card, and builds up the power of one of your five colors, but you don't get a Megalomania bonus and your turn ends immediately.<br/><br/>If you played an Alice, you can then invade a territory in the playing area, which is composed of modular hex tiles. To conquer the territory, you need enough military power (red cards) or supplemental military (red) tokens, and if the territory is not on a hex where you occupy a city, you must have enough food (green cards) or food tokens to reach that space. If you conquer it, you receive a bonus based on the territory's color: military, food or dream tokens; Alice cards; or points. If you conquer a city, you score points and now have a foothold on that hex.<br/><br/>If you lack enough military and food, you can still place the territory under attack and finish it off on a later turn, but another player can potentially conquer it in the meantime.<br/><br/>Mystic forests cannot be conquered until they're surrounded by player-controlled territories, and only the player(s) with the most controlled surrounding territories can then capture the forest, which has a toughness and point value equal to the number of surrounding territories.<br/><br/>The game ends after fourteen rounds, then players score points for having the most or secondmost territories controlled in each hex and for having the most Alices in any of the five colors. Players can also score points for Alice Megalomania effects, and whoever has the most points wins!<br/><br/>"}, "226090": {"rpgdesigner": ["Gus L"], "rpg": ["Generic / Universal"], "poll": [], "name": "Gravesand Beach", "rpgartist": ["Gus L"], "rpgproducer": ["Gus L"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3525633.jpg", "usersrated": "0", "rpgitemversion": ["PDF Version"], "average": "0", "statistics": [], "rpggenre": ["Fantasy"], "rpgpublisher": ["(Web published)"], "rpgcategory": ["Scenario / Adventure / Module"], "rpgseries": ["One Page Dungeon Contest 2017"], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3525633_t.jpg", "description": "From the introduction:<br/><br/>Razor cliffs of crumbling picrate protect a tumbledown village of turf roofed huts, where the tangle-haired children of goatherds peer from every darkened threshold and never glance at the flat green horizon of the sea beyond.

His goal in starting such an operation would&rsquo;ve been to blitz to the oilfields and Allied base areas in North Africa and the upper Persian Gulf. That would&rsquo;ve effectively broken the geostrategic back of the British Commonwealth of Nations, disrupted Europe&rsquo;s oil supply, and delayed the US from being able to mount an atomic bombardment campaign into the USSR.<br/><br/>The scenario is based on the actual &ldquo;Pincher&rdquo; series of defensive plans drawn up in the Pentagon from 1946 through 1949.<br/><br/>There are rules for US atomic bombs, but their use is constrained by politics. That is, the late 1940s marked the arrival of the anti-imperialist (&ldquo;third world&rdquo; or &ldquo;nonaligned&rdquo;) movement on the world stage. So, if the Americans try to win by using enough bombs to blow to bits Stalin&rsquo;s attacking horde, they do so much damage to the environmental and socio-political ecologies as to undo that victory in the strategic sense.<br/><br/>The extra-large-hex 34x32&rdquo; map covers from Albania and Thrace south to Benghazi and Kuwait and east to Tehran and the Caspian Sea. Each hexagon represents 60 miles (97 km). Each of the eight full game turns represent two weeks of &lsquo;real time.'<br/><br/>Communist units of maneuver are Soviet and satellite-nation armies (plus super-elite Guards Airborne divisions) along with Allied armies, corps, divisions, brigades, and regiments. There are no US units on-scene at the start of play, but army &ldquo;regimental combat teams&rdquo; and Marine Corps regiments and a brigade rush in as reinforcements. Air power is abstracted, with counters and rules showing the effects of one side or the other gaining temporary air superiority over portions of the map.<br/><br/>Since this is a secondary theater (in regard to a presumed main front in Western Europe), the Communist player is never certain exactly what his order of battle will be until set up. He knows, however, it will contain a total of 12 to 14 Soviet combined arms, mechanized, shock and tank armies, along with 10 satellite-nation corps and armies (and possibly three to seven divisions of ultra-elite airborne divisions).<br/><br/>Each match generally runs through three phases. In the first, the Communist juggernaut drives deep across Turkey and into Mesopotamia. Only the Turkish and Israeli Armies, and the use of a-bombs by the US, can slow the advance. As Soviet losses mount and US prestige sinks, the middle stage begins. It&rsquo;s characterized by both sides maneuvering, seeking to hold or take still-contestable key areas. The Soviet guards airborne force is most likely to make its appearance. A-bombs are still going off, but their targeting has to be ever more selective and there are fewer such attacks. During this period a well executed Soviet campaign will achieve its victory objectives. The end game sees an Allied counteroffensive, as that player throws in everything he&rsquo;s got to try to take back from the Communists enough victory hexes to overturn what will otherwise be their end-of-play win on points.<br/><br/>"}, "226227": {"poll": [], "name": "Hot Seat: NSFW Expansion", "playingtime": "90", "minplayers": "4", "boardgamemechanic": ["Voting"], "yearpublished": "0", "boardgameexpansion": [], "usersrated": "0", "maxplayers": "10", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3536331_t.jpg", "average": "0", "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["(Self-Published)"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3536331.jpg", "boardgameversion": ["First edition"], "maxplaytime": "90", "boardgamecategory": ["Bluffing", "Card Game", "Deduction", "Expansion for Base-game", "Humor", "Mature / Adult", "Party Game"], "age": "17", "minplaytime": "20", "description": "Description from the publisher:<br/><br/>Ready to turn up the heat on the Hot Seat?

The crew and equipment of the Time-Space Research Station, Chronomega One, have been emergency-ejected into outer space. You play one of the surviving scientists who must collect pieces of floating research tech and combine them into Electromagnetic-, Gravity-, and Time-bending tools to help bring Chronomega One back under control. You have no idea which member of the crew is responsible for the emergency protocol lock-down and crew ejection, so you can&rsquo;t trust any of them!<br/><br/>The player's goal is to collect a full set of the three types of Computer cards (all values 1, 2, 3) to unlock the Station Key Code, and reach the central Computer portal of the station first (and in advanced play, before the station explodes).<br/><br/>The game utilizes a rotating space station board and transparent hexagonal tech cards that represent the four 'suits' of the game, Electromag, Gravity, Chrono, and Computer. The players get three actions each turn to move about the board or play cards. They'll want to collect the floating tech cards during their turn and utilize them for different effects. All the tech cards consist of one of the four suits and are valued 1-3.<br/><br/>If a player encounters another player on the board, they'll utilize their tech cards to engage in a showdown. This consists of each player bidding one of their tech cards. The bids are then revealed and winner determined based on the tech suit played. Certain types of tech defeat others: Electro defeats Grav, Grav defeats Chrono, Chrono defeats Electro. If two types of the same suit are played, higher values defeat lower. All suits defeat Computer, unless their values match (e.g. Grav 3 vs Computer 3), in which case the Computer suit player wins. The winner takes the card that was bid and may push the opposing player 3 spaces (if in outer space), or up or down one level of the space station (including out into an airlock).<br/><br/>All tech cards have a basic function they may be played for as an action, such as move an extra space or to force another player to discard cards. Two transparent tech cards also may be combined and over-layed to activate a catalytic effect, which grants different powers based on the combined card's values and suits. If a full three-part set of tech cards are collected of the same suit (values 1, 2, and 3 of a single suit) they form a POD. These grant the most significant abilities in the game. The more powerful card effects require the player to be standing upon an appropriate research portal to use, either one of the permanent portals within the rotating space station or from a floating portal out in space that they cobbled together from another high-value tech card of the same suit.<br/><br/>The space station itself is surrounded by trapped airlocks which make simply entering the station a risky endeavor. While inside, every time a player ends a turn within the space station their ring level rotates 90 degrees, lining up different portals and pathways with the inter-level Grav chutes.

Much like a modern board game, its complexities are front-loaded and not piled on at the back end with exceptions, mini-systems, and charts. While the dice-rolling conventions are more involved than in most RPGs, once you know them, everything else just... FLOWS.<br/><br/>In Axiom, dice are not just a way to determine whether you succeed or fail: they work like a series of BETS where a number of factors play into every roll. Will you gain Brainz or Chaw? Will you beat the Hazard number and avoid hurting yourself or a friend? Do you reroll those low numbers, or do you play it safe? Will you use a Twist to skew the odds? All of this makes each and every roll (and reroll) a compelling tactical decision.<br/><br/>The core advantage of the system is that players have many different goals in mind, and thus many ways to both achieve and measure success. It&rsquo;s not about simply making a roll; every roll is a series of decisions that can potentially change everything down the line. Axiom is dynamic and versatile.<br/><br/>Like A Swiss Watch:<br/>A Finely Tuned Precision Instrument<br/><br/>Axiom also warps what a turn is so that the story unfolds organically and ensures that no one gets bored. By deconstructing the turn, we created a unique initiative and pacing system. You start your turn by taking an action and making a roll, and then on each of your rerolls&mdash;which are made on another player&rsquo;s turn&mdash;you pile on details. You can &ldquo;spend&rdquo; successes (boosts) as Descriptors to add to the story. The drama of the scene builds step-by-step over each turn, and waiting to see what happens ratchets up the tension.<br/><br/>You can make a character in minutes (&ldquo;Just pick five cards&rdquo;), but each persona is interesting and compelling. More than the ultimate pick-up game, I Am Zombie is also a great arena in which to experiment and play. Just pick and choose which Axioms to use!<br/><br/>This fluid and responsive storytelling system is as smooth &amp; elegant as the cards themselves. Indeed, a novice Narrator doesn&rsquo;t need to know much about how the system works as the rules and the players work together to run things themselves. Thus, the only thing the Narrator really needs to worry about is... THE STORY.<br/><br/>"}, "226246": {"rpgdesigner": ["Michael Iantorno", "Matthew Iantorno"], "rpg": ["Generic / Universal"], "poll": [], "name": "Of No Small Power", "rpgartist": ["Michael Iantorno", "Matthew Iantorno"], "rpgproducer": ["(Uncredited)"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3528394.png", "usersrated": "0", "rpgitemversion": ["PDF Version", "PNG Version"], "average": "0", "statistics": [], "rpggenre": ["Fantasy"], "rpgpublisher": ["(Web published)"], "rpgcategory": ["Scenario / Adventure / Module"], "rpgseries": ["One Page Dungeon Contest 2017"], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3528394_t.png", "description": "Author's blurb:<br/><br/>An inept wizard has used size-manipulation magic to enslave a race of tiny humanoids.

Coal, after being discovered in Haspelknecht, is in high demand as cities and factories throughout the region are in need of this coveted resource. The Ruhr river presented a convenient route of transportation from the coal mines. However, the Ruhr was filled with obstacles and large dams, making it incredibly difficult to navigate. Trade coal for valuable upgrades and plan your route to victory along the Ruhr!<br/><br/>In more detail, the players transport and sell coal to cities and factories along the Ruhr river in the 18th and 19th centuries. By selling coal to cities and factories, players acquire unique progress markers. In the beginning, players have access only to low value coal. By selling coal to certain locations, players gain access to high value coal.

The name Kotobamados comes from \u8a00\u8449 (kotoba) 'words' and \u623b\u3059 (modosu) 'revert/undo', so is something like &quot;return the words to their original state&quot;, which is a monstrous task.<br/><br/>This is a word game where players try to work out three secret words from a mix of nine character tiles. In English, this would be relatively simple, as most three letter words in English need at least one vowel. However, in Japanese, this is a much harder prospect.<br/><br/>Japanese uses three writing systems, with Hiragana being the most broad. Hiragana has a lot more letters than the English alphabet, and fewer restrictions in combinations, meaning just three characters can be used in a lot of ways.<br/><br/>In addition, there is a further element in Hiragana, \u6fc1\u70b9 (dakuten) a voiced sound mark similar to accents or umlauts. For example, \u305f (ta) combined with a Dakuten would be \u3060 (da), or \u3059 (su) and a Dakuten would be \u305a (zu). In this game therefore the letter tile for \u305f may be used for either \u305f or \u3060.<br/><br/>From around 50 Hiragana letters, 20 of them can be combined with Dakuten. If the tiles offered to solve have several of these 20 Hiragana characters, it becomes very hard to deduce what the secret words actually are.

Smaller scales could also be used.<br/><br/>Westfront is designed with simplicity in mind, but since it represents communication issues, orders from above, random events like units becoming lost, as well as the actual movement and attacking of the various types of forces, it can become quite in-depth.<br/><br/>Westfront has a fairly free-form army list composition; allowing players to choose infantry, cavalry, vehicles, various types of artillery, fortifications and barbed wire at their will. Units behave historically, and 4 different theaters are available to play in. Some will have a higher chance of poor weather, and if the entire tabletop is mud units like armored cars simply wont be able to function. Thankfully season is determined before players write their army lists, so they will know ahead of time what to expect.<br/><br/>Westfront covers the evolution of the war and the changes in doctrines and units involved;<br/><br/>Early war (1914 - 1915) will have only the most rudimentary artillery usage in preliminary bombardments, and only the basic units available (no tanks!).<br/><br/>Mid War (1916) will see the standardization of the creeping artillery barrage (which really works in-game: artillery provides cover as troops advance, and causes enemies to keep their heads down if it explodes near them), indirect machine gun fire and of course the introduction of the first Mk.I tanks.<br/><br/>Late war (1917 - 1918) will see advanced infantry tactics like Germans advancing machine gun teams through creeping barrages to set up in no mans land, and the introduction of more refined tanks and German anti-tank rifles.<br/><br/>Westfront provides army lists for the Allied forces and the Central Powers, covering most of the units available. 3 qualities of infantry and cavalry are available (sup-par, regular and assault/veterans), and artillery is broken into 4 categories: Trench mortars like the minenwerfer or stokes mortar, flat-firing field guns like the 37mm maxim, and the various 77mm German guns (these have varying ranges depending on the specific gun), howitzer batteries like the 18-Pdr or 15cm SFH, and heavy howitzers like the 42cm M&ouml;rser or the BL 12-Inch. Fortifications are covered, with shallow and deep trenches, dug outs and pillboxes all available<br/><br/>Westfront aims to give fun games around 2 hours long and to give a WW1 feel for the players. Much research has been done based on the accounts of actual combatants, attempting to implement some of the important features for those on the ground. For example a forward unit on the attack may start to run low on ammunition, so could send a runner back to request supplies, but the runner may get killed along the way... Another example might be a friendly unit capturing an enemy trench, only to get shelled by friendly artillery controlled by H.Q. They desperately send a runner back to their lines to tell the barrage to stop, but it will take a few turns for the order to get through...<br/><br/>"}, "226300": {"rpgartist": ["Jason Moser", "Sade", "Shaman's Stockart", "James Shields", "United States National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA)"], "rpgitemversion": ["PDF version", "Softcover Version"], "statistics": [], "name": "Lethal Inheritance", "rpgdesigner": ["Thorin Tabor"], "rpgproducer": ["Tracy Lachowicz", "Thorin Tabor"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3529163.jpg", "usersrated": "0", "average": "0", "rpggenre": ["Horror", "Science Fiction"], "rpgpublisher": ["Tab Creations"], "rpg": ["Shadows Over Sol"], "rpgcategory": ["Scenario / Adventure / Module"], "poll": [], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3529163_t.jpg", "description": "From publisher blurb:<br/><br/>When the team is offered a unique opportunity to acquire their very own spaceship for essentially free, they must travel to an abandoned energy facility.

Just before the turn into the 20th century Irwin Biddle purchased the house and turned it into what he called an orphanage care facility. But his severe governorship of the orphanage made the home for lost children anything but a haven. A fire in 1939 nearly destroyed the Thornhill Mansion. All but 13 children escaped the blaze. It wasn't until 1956 that Arthur Holland, a mining tycoon, purchased the Thornhill and footed the bill for a full renovation. However, it became clear within weeks of moving his family into the Thornhill that the Victorian mansion was far from settled. Holland's personal account of his family's stay in the Thornhill tells of unexplained children's voices, the sounds of little feet running through the night, of moaning heard inside the walls, even of parts of the house shifting. After leaving the Thornhill, Holland declared, &quot;The place is a house of the dead. No sane person can live well within its walls.&quot;<br/><br/>13 ghosts live in the Thornhill, victims of the devastating fire that happened so long ago. As a ghost hunter, you welcome the chance to stay in the ghostly orphanage. Will you be the one to finally put the children to rest? Or will the malevolent child spirits drive you insane?<br/><br/>How to Play<br/><br/>In Children the game, you wander around the Thornhill Mansion trying to trap ghosts.<br/><br/>At the beginning of the game, you deal the 13 Ghosts deck face down off to the side on the table. You then deal the 13 Toys cards face up over the 13 Ghosts cards, creating 13 2-card stacks. Each player gets 5 cards (the hand limit at the beginning of the game) from the Children deck.<br/><br/>Players collectively build the Thornhill Mansion during their turns by placing room cards face up on the table in a grid pattern. The mansion is built in 4 levels--basement, 1st floor, 2nd floor, and 3rd floor. Each room card indicates on which floor it must be placed.<br/><br/>You search for toys and helpful devices by moving your pawn from room to room throughout the mansion. Each time you enter a room, you draw a card and add it to your hand. With a 5-card hand limit, players are forced to leave cards in rooms by placing them facedown beneath room cards. Players may also leave traps beneath room cards. You look at left-behind cards when you enter rooms. Left-behind traps spring immediately. You may add other left-behind cards to your hand.<br/><br/>You place ghost cards into the mansion when they appear at the top of the draw pile. Ghost cards are placed face up beneath room cards so players can read ghosts' names and see the toy icons on the tops of the cards.<br/><br/>To trap ghosts you must have Toy cards. Each ghost card is marked with a toy icon. If you are in a room with a ghost and you have its corresponding toy in your hand, you immediately trap the ghost and put it, along with the toy card, in front of you to keep score.<br/><br/>When you trap a ghost, you must see if another ghost in the house becomes enraged. To do this, flip over the 2-card stack you made at the beginning of the game that corresponds with the toy you used to trap the ghost. If the revealed ghost is in the mansion, flip its card over to its enraged (red) side. Every enraged ghost in the house reduces the hand limit by 1 card. If the hand limit reaches 0 cards, no players win. The ghosts take the game.<br/><br/>"}, "226327": {"poll": [], "name": "Sinless", "videogamemode": ["Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["Android edition", "iOS edition", "Windows/Macintosh Downloadable edition"], "average": "0", "videogametheme": ["Cyberpunk"], "usersrated": "0", "videogamedeveloper": ["MGP Studios"], "videogamegenre": ["Point-and-Click", "Visual Novel"], "videogameplatform": ["Android", "iPad", "iPhone", "Macintosh", "Windows"], "statistics": [], "videogamepublisher": ["Forever Entertainment S.A."], "description": "Are you ready to embark on a journey in a unique cyberpunk setting?<br/>Planned out as a trilogy, experience the first episode also known as the Reveal, which will be followed by Revolution and Revelations accordingly.<br/>The world as we know it has come to an end and a New Order has taken over.

The board is divided into 8 orbits and an impenetrable asteroid belt. The orbits are further divided into regions of varying economic and strategic value. Additionally, there are 5 transit hubs which facilitate jumping between orbits. The  object of the game is to eliminate the other players through conquest or, alternatively, to successfully monopolize all transit hubs for an economic victory.<br/><br/>Holding regions of space are the source of income in the game. The value of regions can be increased by constructing and upgrading space stations. To protect valuable regions, force fields may be constructed. Isolating regions behind force fields, however, diminishes their economic output. A player must, therefore, strike a careful balance between security and trade.<br/><br/>Players may attack adjacent regions with their fleets of space ships. There are three types of space ships in Sunship. Combat is played out on special cards on which the placement of space ships is significant. Depending on the type of ship, the player may select difficult to hit positions, cloak their attack, or attack from the rear. The combat system is elegant, versatile, and based on basic bit math.<br/><br/>"}, "226409": {"rpgartist": ["(Uncredited)"], "rpg": ["Generic / Universal"], "poll": [], "name": "Life and Death in Oturak", "rpgdesigner": ["Evan Gillespie", "Colin Sproule"], "rpgproducer": ["(Uncredited)"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3532797.jpg", "usersrated": "0", "rpgitemversion": ["PDF Version"], "average": "0", "statistics": [], "rpggenre": ["Fantasy"], "rpgpublisher": ["(Web published)"], "rpgcategory": ["Scenario / Adventure / Module"], "rpgseries": ["One Page Dungeon Contest 2017"], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3532797_t.jpg", "description": "From the introduction:<br/><br/>Hired to guard a traveling merchant caravan, saved by travelers after collapsing in the desert, sent to investigate reports that a wanted and dangerous summoner has been seen in the city...<br/><br/>"}, "226410": {"poll": [], "name": "Wisdomantics", "playingtime": "0", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": ["Roll / Spin and Move", "Set Collection"], "yearpublished": "2013", "usersrated": "0", "maxplayers": "4", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3543597_t.jpg", "average": "0", "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["Kingdom Games Enterprises"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3543597.jpg", "boardgameversion": ["First Edition"], "maxplaytime": "0", "boardgamecategory": ["Religious"], "age": "12", "minplaytime": "0", "description": "From the box<br/>&quot;Wisdomantics - Where Wisdom is Power is an interactive DVD board game for players of various faiths who desire to gain the vast wisdom of King Solomon.

As the boss of one of the city&rsquo;s most notorious crime organizations, robbing that vault for all it&rsquo;s worth is constantly on your mind.  There&rsquo;s only one problem.  This job is too big for just your crew alone.  You&rsquo;re going to need help from some of your biggest rival crime bosses if you want to succeed.  You&rsquo;ll need to join forces on a series of smaller jobs in order to acquire the skills and resources you'll need to pull off the biggest heist the city has ever seen.  But watch your back!  Once you and your new partners in crime are inside the bank vault, it'll be every boss for himself.  Hire your crew, plan the heist, and get ready for The Big Score!<br/><br/>The Big Score is a competitive game for 1-5 players that plays in 30-60 minutes.  The game is structured into two distinct halves.  In the first half of the game, players will use card drafting to carefully choose which specialists to add to their crew.  They will secretly decide how to assign them to various small heists throughout the city, and they&rsquo;ll need to pick just the right moment to send in their most skilled expert to ensure a job&rsquo;s success!  If these plans go well, players will steal a variety of loot:  cold hard cash, jewels that escalate in value as more are gained, artifacts that are profitable for the player with the largest collection, and hard drives full of intel that become lucrative only if hacked with a digital key.  In the second half of the game, individual player abilities will come into play as the players attempt the mother of all heists, The Big Score.  Players will risk being busted by the cops as they steal even more loot in an exciting, press-your-luck grand finale inside the New Centennial Bank vault!<br/><br/>The Big Score also features a challenging solo-play mode designed by A.J.

These air races galvanised interest across the world and encouraged by generous prizes by Newspapers and other sponsors attracted international entries. Air travel was risky and most unreliable. Often only a small number of the entrants would make it to the finish line. Will one of your pilots manage to face up to the challenge?  But watch out: In this era of gentlemanly behaviour and stiff upper lips there are a few cads and bounders who will cheat to win.<br/><br/>In Magnificent Flying Machines the winner is the person who ends the game with the most victory points. These can be earned in various ways including being the first to land successfully on a certain terrain tile, landing on the middle airfield, transporting cargo or passengers or performing trick maneuvers. Simply being the first to cross the finishing line is unlikely to be enough on its own to secure a victory. The winner will be the player who picks a strategy that best matches the abilities of the pilot and features of the flying machine they are using.<br/><br/>The game is played in a series of rounds. A round begins with the first player taking a turn. Each player takes their turn in order clockwise around the table. During a turn a player has two action phases available. There are three types of action phase to choose from. These are The takeoff phase (which may also include refueling, repairing and scavenging spare parts),The flying phase (which may also include gaining altitude and performing trick maneuvers), The landing phase (which may also include refuelling). In addition whenever a flying machine lands on a terrain tile any passengers that wish to will disembark), and any cargo intended for that terrain type is unloaded.  It may also take on available equipment, cargo and passengers if there is space available to do so.<br/><br/>Players progress in the game by passing a series of takeoff, flying and landing tests. To determine the difficulty of a particular test, first look at the number of symbols for that test shown on the terrain tile that the flying machine is on. Simply add the number of symbols shown on the terrain tile to the number of symbols on the relevant weather tile. If a player needs to take a test, first check to see the total number of relevant symbols shown on the flying machine dashboard. This is the number of dice that may be rolled when attempting to obtain a sufficient number of symbols to pass the test. If the player does not roll enough symbols they may then choose to make use of special equipment, use spare parts, or play trick and boost cards to obtain additional symbols in order to pass the test. If a player is unable to obtain a sufficient number of symbols to pass the test then a failure occurs. If the dice rolled include a catastrophic failure symbol, then a catastrophic failure occurs. The effects of such a failure vary depending on the test being taken.<br/><br/>"}, "226458": {"rpgartist": ["(Uncredited)"], "rpgitemversion": ["PDF version"], "rpgseries": ["Unearthed Arcana"], "name": "Revised Subclasses", "rpgdesigner": ["Jeremy Crawford", "Mike Mearls"], "rpgproducer": ["(Uncredited)"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3533514.png", "usersrated": "0", "average": "0", "statistics": [], "rpg": ["Dungeons & Dragons (5th Edition)"], "rpgpublisher": ["Wizards of the Coast"], "poll": [], "rpgcategory": ["Sourcebook (rules/options to enhance play)"], "rpggenre": ["Fantasy (High Fantasy)"], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3533514_t.png", "description": "From the introduction:<br/><br/>This document presents revised versions of five subclasses that appeared in earlier installments of Unearthed Arcana.

Each tetrahedron always has neighbors. Their number can be from 1 to 12. Tetrahedrons are considered to be neighbors if they stand on the nearby triangles. Neighbors are divided into two types - orthogonal and diagonal. The piece can be moved to any empty triangle, where the number of neighbors are less than it is now. Their color does not matter. The piece can also be moved to any empty triangle, where the number of neighbors does not change, but orthogonal ones among them become less.
