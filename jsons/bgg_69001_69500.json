It is based on the anime series of the same name (Magic Knight Rayearth). The game was released in North America by the now defunct Working Designs; it was the last Saturn game released in the US region. Because of its late release in the US, it was not localized in Europe. Working Designs was based in Redding, California, and all the voice actors they used were local, as was their standard. Key voice actors such as Paul Howell and T. Owen Smith voiced the evil characters of the game.<br/><br/>Gameplay<br/>Throughout the game, the player controls a party of three characters. However, only one character can battle at a time; though the other two characters will follow behind the active character, they cannot attack and are unaffected by all enemy attacks and even environmental hazards. The player can instantly change the active character at any time. In essence, the three characters confront the enemies, puzzles, and assorted threats of the game in a tag team fashion.<br/><br/>Unlike most RPGs, character upgrades and magic spells are mostly acquired upon progressing to certain points in the game, rather than by independent accomplishments. (The exceptions are maximum HP and maximum MP, which are increased by finding special items.) This is much like the Saturn's first RPG, Virtual Hydlide, with the important difference that weapons and armor in Magic Knight Rayearth are upgraded as part of general level ups and do not exist as distinct gameplay elements.<br/><br/>While the anime and manga both have the Magic Knights using color-coordinated swords, in the game only Hikaru uses a sword, while Umi uses a foil and Fuu a bow and arrow. Each of the three weapons has its own advantages and disadvantages. For instance, the bow works long range but requires precise aim, whereas the sword slices with broad strokes that make it easy to hit enemies but is short range only. The need to aim the bow is mostly removed once it is upgraded, since Fuu can then charge the weapon to make it &quot;lock on&quot; to the nearest target. However, unlike the sword and foil, the bow's attack power does not increase when it is charged up.<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;Magic Knight Rayearth (video game)&quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/><br/>Translated box back (Japanese Saturn version):<br/><br/>Save this world&hellip;<br/>You legendary magic knights&hellip;<br/><br/>Added to the anime story, is an original story line for the Sega Saturn!!<br/>To be enjoyed both by Rayearth fans and those who do not yet know about the Rayearth world.<br/><br/>A next generation role playing game<br/><br/><br/>        trivia note: The US release of this game was the last release for the Saturn in the States** (from Japanese Wikipedia)<br/>    <br/><br/><br/>"}, "69055": {"rpgdesigner": ["Jolly R.

The game first appeared on the Playstation and was later ported to the Sega Saturn.<br/><br/>Unlike the earliest Castlevanias which had set stages to clear, Symphony of the Night features exploring a huge castle and contains certain RPG-elements such as experience points, levelling up, equipping of different weapons and armour, and saving money to buy consumables. As the player advances, the character's movement abilities improve, and much of the game consists of re-visiting earlier areas to explore fully. Also, enemies have a probability of dropping certain items, which caused some players to &quot;grind&quot; (linger in one area to repeatedly defeat the same cannon fodder over and over again) in order to get their hands on rare items. The player is also equipped with familiars, that gain experience points and who will, when reaching certain levels, gradually improve their performance.

This book contains both Operation Morpheus and The Empire of Karo, reprinted in one book. Operation Morpheus OPERATION MORPHEUS is designed as a campaign introduction to an AFTERMATH! world. Although originally part of a campaign set in Australia the information and ideas herein can easily be used with any campaign. The setting is a major university in an important city. The time is approximately one hundred years after the collapse of civilization. The players take the parts of people who, having volunteered to take part in a &lsquo;short-term&rsquo; experiment in cryogenic suspension, awaken many long years after the planned time. They find the world in ruins and have no idea of the cause of, reasons for, or history of this disaster. Naked and unarmed they must face a strange new world. Cleverness and quick-thinking are the first steps to survival. The Empire of Karo The Empire Of Karo is a multi-adventure pack with a complete campaign background based on the area of Cairo, Illinois. The time is twenty years after the collapse of civilization and Karo (as the locals call Cairo) is the hub of a growing empire based on revived river trade along the Mississippi. This package includes a complete background to the growth of the empire, major personalities of the ruling clique, and even a detailed breakdown of the many merchants of the city and their business establishments. The scenarios begin with a series of military based adventures within the city and empire itself. Scenarios continue to include a variety of adventure types in the ruins of a larger city, St. Louis, which is frequently visited on scavenging expeditions by the bolder general merchants of Karo.

The centurion has been raised from the dead to rescue Zeus' daughter, Athena. The player battles undead and demonic hordes, controlling the shapeshifting hero. He must fight through several levels in order to save the kidnapped goddess. Although 'Centurion' was a rank in the Roman Army, the game takes place in a setting resembling Ancient Greece, complete with gods, temples and ruined Ionic columns.<br/><br/>The player must battle armies of fictional and undead creatures to defeat the evil Demon God Neff, who is holding Athena captive. Along the way, the player has to obtain &quot;Spirit Balls&quot; (power-up orbs which increase his strength and size) from defeating white two-headed wolves (blue oxen in the DOS version) (it is hinted that this wolf might be the Cerberus dog of Greek Mythology). These enable the player to turn into a superhuman (stage one: &quot;giant man&quot;, stage two: &quot;superman&quot;...). When three are collected, the hero transforms into a beast with exceptional abilities.<br/><br/>The game contains several levels which the player must battle through, however the player is not required to reach the beast form in order to complete the level. At the end of each level is a &quot;boss&quot; creature, which is Neff himself in different forms. Before Neff transforms at the end of each level, he says &quot;Welcome to your doom!&quot;. The enemies the player encounters differ depending on the level as does the beast the hero transforms into. These beasts include a werewolf, a thunder dragon, a tiger man, a bear, and the more powerful golden werewolf (other beasts can be seen in the Japanese Famicom version and the Game Boy Advance version). Each beast has its own special abilities, such as the dragon's ability to fly.

The game replaced the standard downs system with an explosive ball that progresses from &quot;cool&quot; to &quot;warm&quot;, &quot;hot&quot;, and &quot;critical&quot; status as it is used. Players can only defuse the ball, resetting it from its current state back to &quot;cool&quot; by crossing the 50 yard line or by change of possession, whether through touchdown, interception or fumble. A robot holding a critical ball while being tackled is destroyed along with the ball. The robots also possess finite durability. As offensive units are tackled, they wear down, finally issuing smoke and then flames after a number of hits. A flaming robot will explode when hit, thereby fumbling the ball. Players can upgrade robots with faster and more durable units using money bonuses they earn during play. Players select from run, pass or option plays on offense, after which the computer presents four individual plays from which to choose. On defense, a player can select short, medium or long defenses, and then select a specific defensive scheme.<br/><br/>The standard Cyberball cabinet consists of two monitors, each with two sets of controls for a maximum of four players, but Atari Games released single player and two player versions as well.<br/><br/>The standard configuration allows single player, two player cooperative, two player head-to-head or four player head-to-head play. Playing with two teams of two persons opened up a new dimension of gameplay. Computer controlled avatars ran offensive patterns in very specific ways before reaching their assigned passing spots. Human players, however, could exploit the fact that a number of offensive plays started with identical formations. By choosing one play, but moving their avatars in imitation of a similar but different play, the offensive team could disguise their intentions before suddenly breaking for their assigned pass locations. This offensive flexibility forced defending players to quickly recognize plays and move to break them up by rushing to what they guessed was the intended passing spot. Most often, the timely use of the defender's turbo, a short-term speed boost usable once per play, would determine whether the play resulted in a missed pass, an interception, a long gain, or a score. This ability to improvise in four player mode built the popularity of Cyberball, leading to many tournaments across the United States for a period of time.<br/><br/>Cyberball was released for the Nintendo Entertainment System in 1992 by Jaleco. Tengen intended to release it unlicensed, but Jaleco purchased rights to publish it first. It has also been ported to numerous other platforms, including the Commodore Amiga and Atari Lynx.&quot;<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;Cyberball,&quot; available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "69087": {"rpgdesigner": ["David Woodrum"], "rpgitemversion": ["PDF Version"], "poll": [], "name": "E-Z Cash Pawn Shop", "rpgartist": ["David Woodrum"], "rpgproducer": ["Scott B.

One clear choice was the police station recently offered, while others are still in the discussion or preparation stages of development.When Dave Woodrum suggested a tabloid newspaper with its offices, the overall usefulness of the suggestion absolutely jumped out. As editor at FGU, I could not help but remember how original V&amp;V designer Jack Herman would always check out (and sometimes purchase) tabloid newspapers in supermarkets. Jack had always commented on how such tabloids provided plot ideas for adventures. Plot ideas, possible or probable contacts with heroes and villains, alien abductions and possible secret invasions, rumors of strange doings and events - what could be more in tune with the needs of any ongoing V&amp;V campaign.<br/><br/>This tabloid project includes more than the expected floor plans to an office structure and more than even the hoped for information and stats on interesting staffers with knowledge of and contacts with super-powered beings. It includes tons of adventure seeds in the form of stories extracted from the pages of the tabloid.

Points are scored for every bomb caught, extra buckets (maximum of three) are awarded at every 1,000 points, and one bucket is lost every time a bomb is missed.

One historically, ethnically, and culturally homogeneous people polarized and separated by superpower politics and economics hurl men, weapons, and material into the maelstrom of modern combat in an attempt to settle their arbitrary division once and for all.<br/><br/>From Pyongyang in North Korea to Busan in the South, the war rages. In a scene reminiscent of the first attack by the In Min Gun in 1950, the North Korean People&rsquo;s Army surges across the Demilitarized Zone and penetrates deep into South Korea.<br/><br/>Special Operations Forces from both sides conduct raids, interdiction, and reconnaissance missions behind enemy lines while airborne, air assault, and amphibious forces strike far behind those lines attempting to outflank the main army forces of both sides. In the air, both sides wage a heated campaign in an effort to establish superiority over the skies of Korea. With rough terrain and the full ferocity of modern armor, airmobile, airborne, and marine warfighting capabilities, there is no safe haven in the lethal cauldron of battle which has engulfed the Korean Peninsula.<br/><br/>While North and South battle for a quick, decisive victory, the world awaits the response of the two military superpowers in the region: the United States of America and the People&rsquo;s Republic of China. Will the United States, stung by high casualties among the soldiers of its 2nd Infantry Division near the DMZ during the surprise artillery barrages and initial assaults on the first day of the war, be able to reinforce the South quickly enough, and, if so, how and in what strength? Will the Communist Chinese again react (or pre-emptively intervene) to a massive US response and join the fray, thus widening the conflict? As the situation evolves, choices are made, forces are committed, and the security of Japan and the future of the two Koreas hangs in the balance.<br/><br/>Next War: Korea, the first of a planned series of Next War games, allows players to fight a near future war on the Korean peninsula. In this updated and improved version of the previously-released Crisis: Korea 1995, players have access to virtually all military assets of North and South Korea, as well as large forces from the USA and the PRC. The integrated, easy to learn air-land combat system allows for unit efficiency, armor effects, light infantry, attack helicopters, Close Air Support, Cruise Missiles, and the particularly tough terrain of Korea.<br/><br/>Make no mistake: Next War: Korea is not an Introductory wargame. Rather, we have intended herein to create a system (and a series) that will allow detailed study of modern warfare in various venues as well as engaging gameplay. That said, the Standard Game rules encompass a fairly straightforward ruleset that will, we think, be considered pretty &quot;easy to learn&quot; by experienced wargamers. So players who choose to play Standard Game scenarios can have a relatively quick game when that's what suits them. The real flavor of a war in the theatre, though, comes through in the Advanced Game, where you get much more control over airpower and can more clearly see each side's strengths and weaknesses. For players who want a &quot;mini-monster game&quot; experience, playing the Advanced Game Campaign Scenarios with some or all of the optional rules will definitely &quot;deliver.&quot;<br/><br/>So our hope is that we have created a game with enough variety and scaling of complexity that you can find an engaging and maybe even enlightening experience whether you want to play a fast two-player game, a longer monster game, or an ongoing solitaire study. We intend to provide tools for online game play as well (a Vassal module is being created now for use during playtesting) so that this game can be played in either real-time or over longer periods on the internet.<br/><br/><br/>Units<br/><br/>Ground units in Next War: Korea represent primarily divisions and brigades of armies of North and South Korea, The United States and her Allies, and the People's Republic of China. All ground units are rated for their attack and defense strengths, movement capabilities, and unit efficiency.<br/><br/>Air units represent fighter, bomber, and attack squadrons of the major combatants and are rated for All-Weather Capabilities as well as their range, average pilot skill, and their abilities in Air-to-Air Combat, Close Air Support, and Strike missions.<br/><br/>Naval units and capabilities are abstracted somewhat in the Next War series. A &quot;Sea Control&quot; mechanism reflects the results of the surface and sub-surface battles, while the game's naval unit counters represent the major Aircraft Carrier Battle Groups and Amphibious Ready Groups of the US Navy. Additional amphibious capabilities are represented by the Special Forces capabilities of each side.<br/><br/><br/>Maps and Terrain<br/><br/>The game's two maps present a portion of modern-day Korea at a scale of roughly 7.5 miles per hex. The maps cover the entire peninsula east-to-west and stretch from about 30 miles north of Pyongyang in the North to Taegu in the south. Hexes are larger than the standard 1/2&quot; hex found in Crisis Korea: 1995, allowing us to use larger 9/16&quot; counters in this game and make it a bit easier for players to move game pieces in the congested areas around the DMZ.<br/><br/><br/>Game System<br/><br/>As in Crisis: Korea 1995, there are two types of game turns: Initiative turns (longer turns where the side with the Initiative has more opportunities to move and attack) and Contested turns (shorter turns where neither side has the initiative but each is trying to muster the resources to regain the initiative). Thus the inherent &quot;initiative player advantage&quot; built into the game system incents each player to always be thinking about how to seize and maintain the battlefield initiative.<br/><br/>A Standard game turn is composed of:<br/><br/>    Weather Determination. Bad weather can severaly hamper air and naval operations activity and can significantly slow ground operations.<br/>    Initiative Determination<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>an Air/Naval Phase, wherein air superiority levels and air availability are determined and Sea Control is established or modified.<br/><br/>    One or more Movement and Combat Phases that allow both sides to move, react, and fight, with an advantage to the Initiative player on non-Contested turns<br/>    Arrival of Reinforcements and Replacements<br/>    Victory Determination<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Combat resolution examines not only unit strengths but also unit efficiency (representing training, doctrine, and morale), as well as the terrain where the combat takes place. The CRT tends to be very bloody, reflecting both what we believe will be a degree of attritional warfare early on in light of the massive artillery concentrations near the DMZ as well as the lethality of modern weapons. As in many games, casualties represent not only actual combat losses, but also losses of unit cohesion brought about by the rapidity and pace with which modern armies are able to engage and exploit on the battlefield.<br/><br/><br/>Scenarios<br/><br/>There are several Standard Game scenarios. The first three one mappers, &quot;Seoul Train,&quot; &quot;Uijong Blues,&quot; and &quot;East Coast Highway&quot; (North Map only) cover the first week of the war by dividing the DMZ into roughly three equal sections. These focus on the initial assaults to break the South Korean lines and introduce players to the basic mechanics of the system, while giving them insight into attack and defense strategies for the &quot;big game.&quot; Players can also play the entire DMZ front scenario, &quot;Militarized Zone,&quot; (North Map only) for the first week (basically, combining the three scenarios above). In addition, players can add the South Map and play the entire Standard Campaign game, &quot;All In.&quot; Two other scenarios are provided which examine the U.S. Amphibious landing. &quot;Inchon Again&quot; and the battle for Taejon, &quot;Spearhead.&quot; In addition, a scenario, &quot;They Did What?&quot; is provided for players to experiement with a South Korean attack on North Korea without, however, the help of the United States.<br/><br/>The Advanced Game Scenarios come in three flavors &agrave; la NATO: The Next War in Europe: Strategic Surprise, Tactical Surprise, and Extended Buildup. This offers the players the ability to game out a variety of &quot;At Start&quot; war scenarios based on varying levels of readiness.<br/><br/>There is also an International Posture Matrix &agrave; la Flashpoint: Golan to allow players to experiment with a variety of intervention options for the non-Korean players in the region.<br/><br/>In Next War: Korea, the Korean Peninsula is on fire with two of the world's most well-prepared, antagonistic forces arrayed against each other. Can you, as the North Korean People&rsquo;s Army commander, conquer the South in 3 weeks before the full might of the U.S. can be brought to bear? Can you, as the Republic of Korea&rsquo;s Army commander, hold out against the renewed Communist assault until help arrives? And what will China do?

The pile of columns then settles under gravity. If this causes three or more other symbols to become aligned, they also disappear and the pile settles again. This process repeats as many times as necessary. It is not uncommon for this to happen three or four times in a row - it often happens by accident when the well is becoming crowded. If the well fills beyond the top of the screen, the game ends.<br/><br/>Occasionally, a special column called the Magic Jewel appears. The Magic Jewel flashes with different colors and when it lands, it destroys all the jewels with the same color as the one underneath it.<br/><br/>Like Tetris, the columns fall at a faster rate as the player progresses.

The game covers the pivotal air combat over the Arras sector, France from March until the end of May 1917. Players take on the roles of Royal Flying Corps commander or German Imperial Air Service commander for their respective sides and will have a multitude of taskings available to accomplish and complete their objectives. Bloody April will include both single mission scenarios and multi-mission/multi-day campaigns to allow players to play out large scale battles in a manageable timeframe.<br/><br/>Bloody April recreates entire air raids in detail. Each player will have many unique tactical challenges to overcome. Both players will have numerous taskings available such as Bombing, Recon, Artillery Cooperation, Contact Patrols, Balloon Busting, Offensive Patrols, Line Patrols and Trench Strafing. Players will also have Anti-Aircraft systems available such as different caliber &quot;Archie&quot;, AA guns and &quot;Flaming Onions&quot; incendiary weapons to hinder their opponent&rsquo;s movements. The map covers a significant portion of the Arras sector from Bethune and Lens in the North to Cambrai in the South. All the major aerodromes in this theatre of operations are displayed on map with a scale of 1nm per hex and 2 minutes per game turn. Each detailed aircraft counter will represent anywhere from 1 to 5 aircraft.<br/><br/>The Royal Flying Corps (RFC) player will be on the offensive during this timeframe and have a plethora of diverse aircraft types ranging from obsolete but workhorse B.E.2 2-seaters to brand new aircraft that would become legendary as the war went on such as the SE-5 scout and Bristol F.2a 2-seater. In all the RFC player will have over 15 different types of scout and 2-seater aircraft at their disposal. Pusher type F.E.2b/d and D.H.2 aircraft and the Sopwith Triplane will help fill your arsenal. Sopwith Pups and 1 &frac12; Strutters, Nieuport 17s and SPAD VIIs are some of the other types available. R.E.8s and F.K.8s will help augment your 2-seater fleet and will begin to replace the heavily attrited B.E.2 fleet.<br/><br/>The German Imperial Air Service player takes on the role of Jagdstaffeln (Jasta) commander utilizing Ace pilots such as the legendary &quot;Red Baron&quot;, Manfred von Richthofen and his Jasta 11 comrades flying Halberstadt and Albatros scout aircraft that terrorized the British 2-seaters during this period. The German player will also have his own 2-seater aircraft such as the Rumpler and Albatros C-class 2-seaters to provide Recon, Bombing and Artillery Cooperation. The battle for the skies over Arras in France 1917 is under your control.

For instance, who needs dice -- use a coin, playing cards, physical contest, mental contest, narrative, or therapy in their stead. Scale the game with 4 levels of power. Learn how the gnomes think and plan their attacks by incorporating their styles of assassination, objects that can be looted from them, and the most-dreaded mutations that plague men who get too close. Round that out with 5 exciting scenarios, including Murder, She Gnomed and Aliens Versus Gnomes, and don't forget about the The Great GnomeMurdered Flowchart.<br/><br/>All incidents, situations, and persons portrayed within this book are fiction, and any similarities without satirical intent are strictly coincidental. This excludes gnomes; they are real and a serious threat.<br/><br/>"}, "69145": {"rpgartist": ["Belipar", "Jolly R.

The game was later released on several other formats, including a much upgraded version for the Amiga home computer. The game was inspired by the Gulf War and depicts a conflict between an insane Middle Eastern dictator and the United States. The player controls a lone Apache helicopter and attempts to destroy enemy weapons and installations, rescue hostages and capture enemy personnel, while managing supplies of fuel and ammunition.<br/>The lead designer, Mike Posehn, had no video game experience prior to developing Desert Strike. Inspired by Choplifter, he aimed to create a nonlinear game with smoothly animated vehicles. Posehn, a PhD in Mechanical Engineering, developed a camera system with momentum to mimic realistic helicopter movements. Three-dimensional (3D) modeling was used to generate the vehicle sprites, which were later touched up on the pixel level with color.<br/><br/>Desert Strike was a strong commercial success: it was a chart-topping best seller and at the time Electronics Arts' highest ever selling game. The game also received a favourable critical response, with several magazines awarding scores of over 90%. Reviewers praised the game's enjoyability, mix of action and strategy, graphics and sound. There was some controversy regarding the game's subject matter, with commentators criticising it as in poor taste due the proximity of its release to the recently ended Gulf War.&quot;<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;Desert_Strike:_Return_to_the_Gulf,&quot; available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "69165": {"poll": [], "name": "Double Dragon (1987)", "videogamemode": ["Cooperative", "Network Multiplayer", "Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["3DS Virtual Console edition (Game Boy)", "Arcade edition", "English/European Sega Master System edition", "iPhone edition", "Japanese Famicom edition", "Nintendo 3DS Virtual Console (NES) edition", "Nintendo Wii U Virtual Console (NES) edition", "North American DOS edition", "North American Game Boy edition", "North American NES edition", "North American Sega Master System edition", "UK Atari ST edition", "US Atari 2600 edition", "US Atari 7800 edition", "US Genesis Edition", "Wii Virtual Console (NES) edition", "XBLA Downloadable edition"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1333242.jpg", "videogameseries": ["Double Dragon"], "usersrated": "132", "videogamedeveloper": ["Activision", "Arc System Works Co., Ltd.", "Brizo Interactive", "Empire Interactive", "Melbourne House", "Million Co.

The player character has a repertoire of martial art techniques which they can perform by using the joystick and three action buttons (kick, jump, and punch) individually or in combination. Techniques ranges from basic punches and kicks, to more elaborate maneuvers like hair grabbing moves or elbow punches. When playing with another player, one can assist the other by grabbing their partner's opponent from behind.

If the life gauge runs out or the time limit reaches zero, the player will lose a life.<br/><br/>There is a small variety of enemy characters that the player will face thorough the course of the game. Certain enemies will carry a melee weapon which the player can use by disarming the enemy carrying it and then retrieving the item from the floor. The available weapons includes steel bats, whips, throwing knives, and dynamite sticks, as well as large objects such as cardboard boxes, oil drums, and logs, which the player can lift and throw at enemies or kick it towards incoming ones.<br/>The game is divided into four different stages or &quot;missions&quot;, which consist of a city slum, a factory, the woods, and the hideout of the boss.

After determining who will be questioned first, the question cards are then randomly selected and read to all players.<br/><br/>The other team must then discuss which question will generate the highest emotional response from the player being questioned. Once this has been decided, with the lie detector engaged, the two questions are asked. The hand held lie detector will then display the size of the emotional response to each question using an illuminated bar graph. If the opposing team guessed correctly the device sounds an incriminating alarm and they are awarded a point.<br/><br/>You'll laugh at each other! You'll laugh at yourself!

During strategic rounds (representing one quarter of a year) the hacendados bid on investments, construct enterprises, bribe troops, plot revolutions, and spy on each other.  During tactical rounds (each a single day) the players move their troops, indians, bandidos, railguns and policia around the map to harass (tax, kidnap, arrest, burn) one another and to protect their own enterprises.<br/><br/>The hex map covers a large swath of northern mexico and the southwest US... ranging from El Fuerte Sinaloa in the South, to Florence, Arizona to the North, to Yuma, Arizona in the West and El Paso, Texas in the East.  Each hex is 10 miles.  Players moving units in tactical rounds must contend with all of the hazards the wild west has to offer via an event table.<br/><br/>Semi-cooperative play is often rewarded, as there are no rules regarding transactions and deals that can be made, and many enterprises are highly dangerous and the risk is often best distributed among multiple players.  There can, however, only be one winner... and deals are only as good as your ability to enforce them with strength of arms.

Opposing these lads are elements of the 12th SS Panzer Division &quot;Hitlerjugend&quot; (Hitler Youth) and Panzer Lehr&mdash;elite panzergrenadier units.  The goal of the British division is to seize the town of Fontenay, then press onward to secure the high ground near Rauray in time for the impending Operation Epsom, to be launched the next morning.<br/><br/>The game by designer Mark Mokszycki uses the same system as Red Winter, his game on the Battle of Tolvaj&auml;rvi  from the Russo-Finnish Winter War of 1939.  Scale is grand tactical: 90 minutes per game turn, 425 yards per hex, and mostly company sized infantry units with platoon sized armor units. Gone are the Winter War specific rules such as ski movement and night raids, and in their place we have a more detailed armor/anti-tank subsystem.  There are lots of tanks on both sides in this one!<br/><br/>Rules for Operation Dauntless include the 12th SS Fanatical Defense Table, British sabot ammo, tank destroyers, self-propelled infantry guns and artillery, combat engineers, troop transport, British air strikes, German nuisance raids (night bombings), infantry anti-tank weapons, German ammo shortage, and abstracted effects of the immense British opening barrage by 650 guns.<br/> Terrain is a mixture of corn and wheat fields, orchards, woods, heavy and light bocage, and small stone farm houses and villages.  The Germans begin the game dug in, and they may place a limited number of fortifications during setup.<br/><br/>The game includes a multi-day campaign as well as several shorter scenarios. The Germans are on the defensive overall, but they are armed to the teeth with many powerful panzer formations&mdash;including Panzer IVs, Panthers, and Tigers&mdash;and will find themselves able to counterattack frequently and effectively.

The game mirrors for us our own wisdom in having created the very circumstances of our own healing. It leads us to where we can reframe the past and see the perfection in it. It can be prophetic in showing us issues we didn&rsquo;t even know we had. And It connects us to the truth of who we are.

Each player in turn creates a victim story around that situation and places his/her playing piece in Victimland to start the game.<br/><br/>THE LANDING SPACES<br/><br/>Of course the journey is one fraught with difficulties and repleat with blessings, depending upon which space you land.  The landing spaces will direct you to look at your beliefs, blocks, karma, stories and projections etc., with instructions or by drawing cards.<br/><br/>NEW STORY CARDS<br/><br/>These help you shift out of your victim story - with all its negative beliefs and energy blocks, and move into a new story.<br/><br/>'SATORI'<br/><br/>No matter who gets there first, we want for everyone else to come to Satori.

The others are all players, and must make characters. The GM is responsible for designing an environment and situations with which the characters will interact, and to approve the players' characters. The GM has final say over everything that happens in the game, but players who don't like it are allowed to quit.<br/><br/>Before play begins, the participants should choose a setting. The setting might be cyberpunk, fantasy, Russian Revolution, ice age, English Civil War, or anything else the players can imagine. The characters and environment made by the players and GM should be consistent with the setting.<br/>  <br/>Players may use any media they wish to describe their characters; pictures, short stories, clay, etc. Some players may present characters made under other rules systems. Players should be prepared to clarify their characters for the GM. The GM will decide whether or not the character is reasonable, and may give suggestions for revisions or disallow the character.<br/> <br/>As the game progresses, it often becomes plain that a character is not complete. Some aspects of a character were not made clear in, or mentioned by, the original character concept. Sometimes such changes do not represent oversights in character creation, but rather changes which the character has undergone over the course of the game.<br/><br/>With the GM's permission the character concept can be updated or modified. In some cases, a player may petition for such a change. To prevent character development from distracting players from the game, many GMs will only entertain suggestions to modify a character concept at the end of a game session.<br/> <br/>Game-play consists of hypothetical situations being described by the GM, and the characters' actions and reactions being described by the players. The GM describes settings in which the characters find themselves, including the actions of any characters in those settings not represented by the players.<br/><br/>The GM will sometimes use (or ask players to use) a random or pseudo-random influence, to help determine the outcome of particular actions. The GM may specify the random factor (GM's whim, tarot cards, question to a passerby, vote, dice, a spinner, random number tables, bribes to the GM, expenditure of chits or points, acting out the scene, rock-paper-scissors, etc.), or allow the player to choose.

Then the player rolls a dice and see if the result satisfies those requirements.

It was the first adaptation of TSR's Advanced Dungeons &amp; Dragons (AD&amp;D or D&amp;D) fantasy role-playing game for home computers. It is the first in a four-part series of D&amp;D computer adventure games. The other games in the &quot;Gold Box&quot; series used the game engine pioneered in Pool of Radiance, as did later D&amp;D titles such as the Neverwinter Nights online game. Pool of Radiance takes place in the Forgotten Realms setting, with the action centered in and around the city of Phlan.<br/><br/>Just as in traditional D&amp;D games, the player starts by building a party of six characters, deciding race, sex, class and ability scores for each. The player's party is enlisted to help the city by clearing out the marauding inhabitants which have taken over. The characters move on from one area to another, ultimately confronting the powerful leader of the evil forces. During play the player characters gain experience points, which allow them to increase their capabilities. The game primarily uses a first-person perspective, with the screen divided into sections to display pertinent textual information. During combat sequences, display switches to a top-down perspective.<br/><br/>Generally well-received by the gaming press, Pool of Radiance won the Origins Award for &quot;Best Fantasy or Science Fiction Computer Game of 1988&quot;. Some reviewers criticized the game's similarites to other contemporary games and its slowness in places, but praised the game's graphics and its role-playing adventure and combat aspects.

Most simple quests can be completed alone, while some require the slaying of so many or so powerful foes that players need to team up and cooperate in order to succeed. Game play consists of completing quests, increasing the character's abilities by levelling up, and also, once at the level maximum, finding better and fancier equipment.<br/><br/>The playable races are divided into two factions: The &quot;Horde&quot; consisting of orcs, trolls, tauren (bull-humans) and the Forsaken (rebel undead), and the &quot;Alliance&quot; consisting of humans, dwarves, gnomes and night elves. Players from different factions cannot communicate or form groups. While attacking players of the own faction is impossible, killing characters from the other faction is, although players can choose to play on servers where most player-versus-player combat is disabled.<br/><br/>World of Warcraft boasts 11 million accounts around the world, though certain sources claim that this includes the non-active accounts. The game is released in several languages, including English, French, German, Russian, Spanish and Korean.<br/><br/>World of Warcraft has seen two expansion packs, The Burning Crusade and Wrath of the Lich King.

Now you can play the timeless NES adventure on your Game Boy Advance! The evil warlock Ganon has imprisoned the Princess Zelda and plunged the peaceful land of Hyrule into darkness and despair. Only a young boy named Link has the courage to answer the call for a hero. Will he find the lost Triforce fragments, slay Ganon, and save Princess Zelda? Only you can decide the fate of Hyrule!<br/><br/>User Summary:<br/>This is the game that introduced Link, Zelda, Hyrule, and Ganon.  The adventure begins with Link setting out on a quest to rescue Princess Zelda from the evil clutches of Ganon.  Along the way, Link must grow in strength by acquiring more lifeforce (heart), more equipment (tools), some armor, gems (money), and more specialized weapons.  The game consists of a top-down view of the map with nearly every screen offering exits on all four sides of the screen.  You explore the map through forests, mountains, graveyards, and other fantasy settings in search of dungeons where Ganon and his minions await.  The dungeons are more confined and involve more problem-solving to explore and navigate.<br/><br/>Not only has Ganon captured Princess Zelda, but he has also the Triforce of Power.  The Triforce of Wisdom has been broken into 8 pieces, and Link must acquire these before he can challenge Ganon and save Hyrule.  Once you completed the epic quest, the game allowed a second play-through with all of the locations and dungeons in a new configuration.<br/><br/>Individual credits:<br/>Koji Kondo: Music<br/><br/>", "videogameseries": ["The Legend of Zelda (Core Series)"], "videogamedeveloper": ["Nintendo Co., Ltd."], "videogamehonor": ["2002 Game Critics Best Action/Adventure Game of the Year Nominee", "2002 Game Critics Best of Show Nominee"], "videogamepublisher": ["Nintendo Co., Ltd."], "name": "The Legend of Zelda", "videogamebg": ["The Legend of Zelda", "The Legend of Zelda: The Hyrule Fantasy", "Monopoly: The Legend of Zelda"], "average": "7.96479", "usersrated": "523", "videogamegenre": ["Action Adventure"]}, "69328": {"boardgamedesigner": ["Anni Edqvist", "Mikael Jaakkola", "Matti Torkkom\u00e4ki"], "average": "0", "poll": [], "name": "S\u00e4lles \u00e4ventyr", "playingtime": "0", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": ["Acting", "Roll / Spin and Move"], "yearpublished": "0", "usersrated": "0", "maxplayers": "5", "boardgameartist": ["Mikael Jaakkola"], "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["H\u00e5ll Sk\u00e4rg\u00e5rden Ren r.f."], "boardgameversion": ["Swedish edition"], "maxplaytime": "0", "boardgamecategory": ["Children's Game", "Educational", "Environmental", "Nautical", "Trivia"], "age": "0", "minplaytime": "0", "description": "A children's game that is not actually about the wacky adventures of the eponymous seal mascot, but a way of teaching seamanship and environmental care among other things.

It was originally released in Japan on the Family Computer Disk System less than a year after the release of the original The Legend of Zelda. Nintendo released Zelda II in Japan on January 14, 1987, seven months before the United States saw the release of the first Zelda title. Nintendo released Zelda II in North America in 1988, two years after its initial release in Japan, converting the game from its initial Disk System format to the NES cartridge.<br/><br/>The Adventure of Link is a direct sequel to the original The Legend of Zelda, again involving the protagonist, Link, on a quest to save Princess Zelda, who has fallen under a sleeping spell. The Adventure of Link's emphasis on side-scrolling and RPG-style elements, however, was a significant departure from its predecessor. The game was highly successful at the time and introduced elements that would become commonplace in future Zelda games. It was followed in 1992 by The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past for the Super NES.&quot;<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;Zelda_II:_The_Adventure_of_Link,&quot; available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>", "videogameseries": ["The Legend of Zelda (Core Series)"], "videogamedeveloper": ["Nintendo Co., Ltd."], "videogamepublisher": ["Nintendo Co., Ltd."], "name": "Zelda II: The Adventure of Link", "average": "6.88151", "usersrated": "219", "videogamegenre": ["Action", "RPG"]}, "69330": {"poll": [], "name": "X-Men Legends II: Rise of Apocalypse", "videogamemode": ["Network Multiplayer", "Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["English/European Xbox edition", "North American GameCube edition", "North American PlayStation 2 edition", "North American PSP edition", "North American Xbox edition", "UK GameCube edition"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic782355.jpg", "videogameseries": ["X-Men Legends"], "videogametheme": ["Superhero"], "videogamefranchise": ["Marvel", "Player's Choice (Best Selling Nintendo Games, US & EU)", "X-Men"], "videogamecharacter": ["Colossus (Marvel)", "Cyclops (Marvel)", "Gambit", "Iceman", "Iron Man", "Jean Grey", "Nightcrawler", "Professor X", "Rogue (X-Men)", "Storm (Marvel)", "Wolverine"], "usersrated": "68", "videogamedeveloper": ["Raven Software", "Vicarious Visions"], "videogamegenre": ["Action RPG"], "videogameplatform": ["GameCube", "PlayStation 2", "PSP", "Windows", "Xbox"], "videogamehonor": ["2005 Spike Best RPG of the Year Nominee"], "average": "7.21765", "statistics": [], "videogamepublisher": ["Activision"], "vgcharacterversion": ["Colossus", "Cyclops", "Cyclops", "Gambit", "Iceman", "Iron Man", "Jean Grey", "Nightcrawler", "Professor X", "Rogue", "Storm", "Wolverine"], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic782355_t.jpg", "description": "&quot;X-Men Legends II: Rise of Apocalypse is a follow up to X-Men Legends.

Because of this, it has affected society greatly, with devices called &quot;Magic Engines&quot; harnessing this power for lighting, automobiles, communication, and robots, among other uses. While previously only a select few could wield magic, many magicians gained the ability. However, such progress has also caused two nations; the kingdom of Gohtza, and the Republic of Uhra, recently changed from a monarchical society; to develop new and more powerful weapons of mass destruction. Uhra is building Grand Staff, a gigantic magic engine, while the heavily industrialized Gohtza actively pursued magic research of their own. A third nation, the Free Ocean State of Numara, has remained isolated and neutral, though it is falling into disarray due to a general attempting to stage a coup d'etat. Uhra, at war with Khent, a nation of beastmen, sends its forces to the Highlands of Wohl for a decisive battle at the start of the game.<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;<a target='_blank' href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lost_Odyssey,&quot' rel='nofollow'>http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lost_Odyssey,&quot</a>; available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "69402": {"poll": [], "name": "Chime", "videogamemode": ["Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["PlayStation 3 PSN edition", "Windows Downloadable edition", "XBox 360 XBLA edition"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1093255.jpg", "videogametheme": ["Music"], "usersrated": "39", "videogamedeveloper": ["Zo\u00eb Mode"], "videogamegenre": ["Puzzle"], "videogameplatform": ["PlayStation 3", "Windows", "Xbox 360"], "average": "7.17308", "statistics": [], "videogamepublisher": ["OneBigGame", "Sony Computer Entertainment"], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1093255_t.jpg", "description": "Chime is a block-dropping game that combines elements from both Lumines and Tetris.

Quads are created by placing shapes in solid blocks of 3x3 or more. When a quad is completed and the beat line hits, different musical samples are triggered dependent on its shape. The size of the quad denotes the score, and multipliers can be achieved by having several quads on the screen at once.

Other levels include shops where the player can buy items for healing, attacking, or defense using coins gained from defeated foes, and arena levels where the player can take on challenges to unlock additional characters, although in co-op the arena turns into a player vs player match. This goes for the same as when the players defeat the boss, freeing the princess, and if there are two or more, the battle starts to see who gets the princess' kiss. - In each level, the player can use a number of melee attacks and combination attacks in addition to a unique magical ability each character has in order to defeat foes. The player has a health meter that, if drained from enemy attacks, will cause the character to fall in battle; if the player is playing alone, this ends the level and the player will have to start it over; otherwise, any of the other players may attempt to revive the downed character. The player's magic level is also tracked by a meter and regenerates over time. Numerous weapons can be found in the game, each that have various effects to the character's attributes when equipped. There are also animal orbs that can be found that may help out in battle, improve the character's attributes, or provide another special ability such as gaining more treasure from defeated foes. After a player damages an enemy, they gain experience points, eventually gaining the player a new level. Each level gained allows the player to allocate points towards four basic attributes to improve that character in combat. One character can &quot;level up&quot; to level 99 which is accomplished by amassing exactly 113,680 exp points. Certain level advances also grant new combination attacks. Progress in experience and game completion is tracked for each of the playable characters separately. New playable characters can be earned by completing the game with a new character, or through downloadable characters from Xbox Live Marketplace, such as the titular character from Alien Hominid.<br/><br/>"}, "69404": {"poll": [], "name": "Mass Effect: Bring Down the Sky", "videogamemode": ["Single-Player"], "usersrated": "68", "videogamecompilation": ["Mass Effect Trilogy"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1300801.jpg", "videogameseries": ["Mass Effect (Core Series)"], "videogametheme": ["Aliens", "Science Fiction"], "videogamegenre": ["RPG"], "videogamecharacter": ["Batarian", "Liara T'Soni", "Tali'Zorah nar Rayya", "Varren"], "videogameexpansion": ["Mass Effect"], "videogamedeveloper": ["BioWare"], "videogamefranchise": ["Mass Effect"], "videogameplatform": ["Windows", "Xbox 360"], "videogameversion": ["Windows Downloadable edition", "Xbox 360 DLC edition"], "average": "7.06176", "statistics": [], "videogamepublisher": ["Electronic Arts Inc.

It should also be noted that as of late January 2009, the DLC was made compatible with the Steam version, titled revision a. As with retail box copies, players will need to register their Steam serial number on BioWare's website in order to receive the serial number required for installing the DLC.<br/><br/>Bring Down the Sky includes a new uncharted world that introduces the notorious and feared batarians, a humanoid species with four eyes. A batarian extremist group has hijacked a mobile asteroid station in the Asgard system, setting it on a collision course with the nearby colony world of Terra Nova. Only Commander Shepard can save the millions of innocent civilians before the asteroid completes its deadly descent. This mission is concurrent with the main storyline. BioWare has stated that the adventure should take ninety minutes to complete. The expansion also features an additional achievement awarded upon completion of the mission titled as &quot;Colonial Savior&quot; with a value of 50 points. Additionally, in the PC version of the game, a message may be found in a small music outpost on the asteroid when the computer inside is read twice. The message appears to be a humorous jab by the developers at those who stirred up the controversies surrounding the game's romance scenes upon its initial release.&quot;<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;Mass_Effect,&quot; available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "69405": {"videogame": ["Scribblenauts Remix"], "poll": [], "name": "Scribblenauts", "videogamemode": ["Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["Australian Nintendo DS edition", "English/European Nintendo DS edition", "North American Nintendo DS edition", "Scandinavian Nintendo DS edition"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic748837.jpg", "videogameseries": ["Scribblenauts"], "videogametheme": ["Cute Fantasy"], "usersrated": "105", "videogamedeveloper": ["5th Cell"], "videogamegenre": ["Action", "Puzzle"], "videogameplatform": ["Nintendo DS"], "videogamehonor": ["2009 Game Critics Best Handheld Game of the Year Winner", "2009 Game Critics Best Social/Casual/Puzzle Game of the Year Nominee", "2009 Game Critics Most Original Game of the Year Winner", "2009 Gamescom Best Mobile/Handheld Game of the Year Nominee", "2009 Spike Best Handheld/Mobile Game of the Year Nominee", "2010 British Academy Game Awards Best Handheld/Mobile Game of the Year Nominee", "2010 D.I.C.E.

It was a unit that used proprietary floppy disks (called &quot;disk cards&quot;) for data storage. It was announced, but never released, for the North American Nintendo Entertainment System. Through its entire production span, 1986-2003, 4.5 million units were sold.<br/><br/>The device was connected to the Famicom deck by plugging a modified cartridge known as the RAM Adapter into the system's cartridge port, which attached via a supplied cable to the disk drive. The RAM adapter contained 32 kilobytes of RAM for temporary program storage, 8 kilobytes of RAM for tile and sprite data storage, and an ASIC known as the 2C33. The ASIC acted as a disk controller for the floppy drive, and also included additional sound hardware featuring primitive wavetable synthesis and FM synthesis capabilities. The disk cards used were double-sided, with a total capacity of 896 kilobits or 112 kilobytes per disk. Many games spanned both sides of a disk, requiring the user to switch sides at some point during gameplay. A few games used two full disks (four sides). The Disk System was capable of running on six C-cell batteries or the supplied AC adapter. Batteries would usually last 5 months on daily game play. The battery option was included due to the likelihood of a standard set of AC plugs already being occupied by a Famicom and a television.<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;Family Computer Disk System&quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "69417": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic790274.jpg", "videogametheme": ["Fantasy"], "videogamefranchise": ["Better Description Needed", "The Legend of Zelda", "Player's Choice (Best Selling Nintendo Games, US & EU)"], "videogameplatform": ["Nintendo 3DS", "SNES", "Wii", "Wii U"], "poll": [], "vgwalkthrough": ["Walkthrough on Zelda Universe", "Where to Find all 20 Hearts"], "statistics": [], "videogamemode": ["Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["English/European SNES edition", "eShop Wii Downloadable edition", "eShop Wii U Downloadable edition", "Japanese Super Famicom edition", "Nintendo 3DS eShop edition", "North American SNES edition"], "videogamecharacter": ["Ganondorf", "Link", "Princess Zelda"], "videogamecompilation": ["The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past / Four Swords"], "vgcharacterversion": ["Ganondorf", "Link", "Princess Zelda"], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic790274_t.jpg", "videogame": ["The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past / Four Swords"], "description": "The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past, known in Japan as Zeruda no Densetsu: Kamigami No Toraif\u014dsu (\u30bc\u30eb\u30c0\u306e\u4f1d\u8aac \u795e\u3005\u306e\u30c8\u30e9\u30a4\u30d5\u30a9\u30fc\u30b9, lit. &quot;The Legend of Zelda: Triforce of the Gods&quot;), is an action-adventure video game developed and published by Nintendo for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System video game console, and the third installment in The Legend of Zelda series. It was first released in Japan in 1991, and was later released in North America and Europe in 1992. Shigeru Miyamoto and his team were solely responsible for this game's development.<br/><br/>A Link to the Past's plot focuses on Link as he travels on a journey to save Hyrule, defeat Ganon and rescue the seven descendants of the Sages. A Link to the Past uses a top-down perspective similar to that of the original The Legend of Zelda. It added mechanics and concepts to the series that have become commonplace, including multi-level dungeons and new equipment (such as the hookshot and the Pegasus Boots), as well as establishing the concept of an alternate, parallel (and sometimes far more dangerous) world. It was well-received since its release, and has been listed by GameSpot as one of the best installments of the series, as well as one of the greatest games of all time. To date, A Link to the Past has sold more than four million copies, and has been re-released for the Game Boy Advance and the Wii's Virtual Console.

It was released in 1993 for the Gameboy and a colour version was released in 1998 for the Gameboy Color. TLOZ:LA is the fourth game in the Zelda series after two NES and one SNES installments.<br/><br/>The game takes place on the island Koholint. After a shipwreck, Link finds himself stranded on the island. He is being told that on top of a mountain is a giant egg in which a creature called the Wind Fish lives. The Wind Fish is said to be the guardian of the island. In order for Link to escape from the island, he has to wake Wind Fish. To do this, Link needs eight musical instruments, which he has to retrieve by beating the dungeons on the island.<br/><br/>The gameplay of TLOZ:LA is very similar to the other non-3D games in the series. It features a top-down perspective; Link must beat dungeons to reach the end; many items have to be found and used to advance in the quest; there are a number of side-quests besides the dungeons. Throughout the game pieces of heart are hidden. When four pieces of heart have been found, a new heart container is added to the life bar.<br/>A thing that make TLOZ:LA stand out is that it features 2D platform action in some dungeons. Another major difference with most Zelda games is the absence of the land Hyrule, Princess Zelda, the Triforce and Ganon. Instead the story and events are rather independent of the other games in the series.<br/><br/>The Gameboy color-port of the game, The Legend of Zelda: Link's Awakening DX, features full colour graphics. A new optional dungeon, the Color Dungeon, has been added as well. Many puzzels in this dungeon are color-based. Completing the dungeon gives the player the choice between two advantages which are not required to complete the game. Several other minor changes have been made to the game as well.<br/><br/>TLOZ:LA was well received when it was released. At the time of its release it was one of the biggest adventures ever on a handheld. The two major criticisms were both inherent to the Gameboy platform. The first was the lack of color. The second was the limitation of two buttons for items. The game lets the player assign items to both the A and B button. Since many different items are used all the time, a lot of item-switching is needed, which can become an annoyance.<br/><br/>"}, "69438": {"poll": [], "name": "Evolution 2 \u2013 Far Off Promise", "videogamemode": ["Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["EU DC release", "Japanese DC version", "US DC release"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic727722.jpg", "usersrated": "3", "videogamedeveloper": ["ESP", "Sting"], "videogamegenre": ["RPG"], "videogameplatform": ["Sega Dreamcast"], "average": "6", "statistics": [], "videogamepublisher": ["ESP", "Swing!", "Ubisoft Entertainment S.A.

The objective of the game is to have the Prince fulfill each fan&rsquo;s request, which will make more fans (stages) appear until the whole game is mobbed with fans. Upon fulfilling each fan&rsquo;s request, the Katamari is given to the king, which he uses to create a new planet in the cosmos, this continues until there are enough planets in the cosmos to roll up the sun using the Earth as a katamari. Constellation data can be loaded from Katamari Damacy to help with this task.<br/><br/>The gameplay follows the same core mechanic: To gather material, the Prince pushes around his katamari, a magical, highly adhesive ball capable of grabbing anything smaller than itself. Initially, the katamari can only pick up smaller items like loose change and discarded pencils. As more items accumulate, the katamari&rsquo;s power grows, allowing it to pick up &ldquo;vaulting boxes, pencils, erasers, postcards, ramen, robots, cows, sheep, this girl, that boy, moms and dads, bicycles, motorbikes, homes, buildings, rainbows, clouds, islands, hopes and dreams&rdquo;. Once the level is successfully completed, the katamari is launched into space and becomes a planet, satellite, or other celestial object.

It&rsquo;s so hard to know!<br/><br/>Theme<br/><br/>At its heart MelodieXpress is a game about music. Actually it&rsquo;s a whole lot of games about music. MelodieXpress uses a series of card games to teach the elements of music theory, and to teach the players the skills of sight-reading and composing music.<br/><br/>The pack includes playing cards based around music notation -  notes, clefs, key signatures, and accidental notes - as the basis for games and activities. While the overall intention it to foster musical knowledge and skills, the focus within the games is upon fun and enjoyment.<br/><br/>Gameplay<br/><br/>The Note Reading pack is the first of the MelodieXpress sets. It includes 104 cards including the treble, alto and base clefs, and 52 crotchet notes - 4 cards for each of 13 notes.<br/><br/>There are rules for 12 games included within the pack, and players are free to develop further games and activities utilising the flexibility of the cards. The guidebook introduces the basics of music notation and theory then leads on to the rules of the games.<br/><br/>The Basic Games<br/><br/>The 5 basic games introduce the notes and their naming to the point where players can instantly recognise and name the specific notes from the cards. These games utilise the crotchet notes and the clefs.<br/><br/>These basic games are designed to so that they can initially be played using a subset of 4 notes (16 cards). This allows players to become familiar with the notes and their names, then expanding to include additional notes. A clef is used next to the game board to define the specific notes (so with the treble clef play starts with middle C, D, E and F, while with the alto clef the same cards would be E, F, G and A). As players become confident and adept at naming the notes additional cards are introduced to expand the games and add complexity.<br/><br/>&lsquo;Introducing the Notes&rsquo; and &lsquo;Flash Cards&rsquo; are the initial games and provide a first experience of notes and naming. They are followed by the classic &lsquo;Snap&rsquo; and &lsquo;Memory&rsquo; games adapted to be played using the music cards. While the players compete to win the games, the focus is upon ready recognition and matching of the notes on the cards. The final basic game - &lsquo;Making Melodies&rsquo;  encourages players to construct combinations of notes. It is also an opportunity to play the music from the cards for those players who are learning an instrument.<br/><br/>The basic games are fun and enjoyable in their own right, but also provide a platform for building an understanding of musical concepts and notation.<br/><br/>The Advanced Games<br/><br/>The 7 advanced games build upon the recognition and understanding of notes gained in the basic games. They focus upon sequences and progressions of notes and introduce the next level of sight reading. The later games also introduce the use of key signatures and accidental notes (sharps, flats and naturals) to further extend the game-play and learning.<br/><br/>&lsquo;Row&rsquo; and &lsquo;Reach for the Stars&rsquo; are played by combining cards onto sequences of notes. Players place cards from their hands to build sequences of notes, either individually or in common. &lsquo;Scale the Mountain&rsquo; extends on this by introducing key signatures, and requiring players to build sequences to complete the major scales. As play moves around the table individual players take turns to build upon the scale, or to introduce a new key signature and rearrange the sequence to match the new scale.<br/><br/>&lsquo;Chord you do it?&rsquo; and &lsquo;Chords Aplenty&rsquo; focus upon players building three note sequences of chords to score points. Game-play is dynamic and can involve the trading or transfer of cards between players.<br/><br/>&lsquo;Rows and Scales&rsquo; and &lsquo;Rows and Scales Advanced&rsquo; round out the advanced games, providing interactive games of sequencing and matching cards. Players seek to build sequences from scales and chord, utilising the note cards and accidentals to build legal sets.<br/><br/>Taking it Further<br/><br/>The game system is flexible and open ended. The variety of cards allows players and teachers to develop their own games and activities beyond those provided in the pack. <br/>Additional games will also be published on the MelodieXpress website, sharing new games and activities as they are developed.<br/><br/>The MelodieXpress System<br/> MelodieXpress is a fun, educational and easy way to learn to read music. <br/>Using the approach that we learn best through play, MelodieXpress uses games and activities to introduce the key concepts of musical notation and music theory.

As the game progresses players may add cards to their own or others sequences, aiming to build tunes of at least 18 notes.<br/><br/>&lsquo;Sure Time&rsquo; starts with a time signature and a sequence of 10 notes. Each player in turn chooses bar line and rest cards to introduce into the sequence and marks out each of the bars within the sequence of notes. Points are scored for correctly sequencing the cards. Each player faces a different combination of cards and time signatures as play progresses around the table.<br/><br/>&lsquo;Beat the Bar Line&rsquo; allows players to compose their own music. Each player progressively weaves together a communal collection of note cards with bar lines, rests and time signatures from their individual hands to build a growing composition. The game also introduces repeat bar lines and double bar lines with special rules for their play.<br/><br/>&lsquo;Composing Music&rsquo; adds additional challenges for those players who are learning an instrument or are taking choral lessons. Play starts with a player building a 3 bar segment of music built from the game cards. Points are scored based upon the composition. The following player in the sequence may then gain bonus points by correctly playing the piece. They then add a bar to the piece of music. Play continues with players alternately attempting to play the developing composition and then adding bars until all of the cards set out for that session have been used. Variations to the game allow for the substitution of different key signatures as the game progresses, as well as the use of accidental notes.<br/><br/>Taking it Further<br/><br/>Together the Note Reading and Composing Music Packs are intended to provide a fun series of games and activities which introduce the basics of sight reading and music notation. Additional packs and resources extend the system still further.<br/><br/>The game system is designed to be flexible and open ended. The variety of cards allows players and teachers to develop their own games and activities beyond those provided in the pack. <br/>Additional games will also be published on the MelodieXpress website, sharing new games and activities as they are developed.<br/><br/>The MelodieXpress System<br/> MelodieXpress is a fun, educational and easy way to learn to read music. Using the approach that we learn best through play, MelodieXpress uses games and activities to introduce the key concepts of musical notation and music theory. This step-by-step approach allows you to learn at your own pace, while the games provide an enjoyable way to learn and consolidate your knowledge of music.<br/><br/>MelodieXpress Composing Music is not a complete game.

A public domain supplement to the Storyteller system. After being inspired by the professional quality of the public domain supplement Highlander for the same system, I decided to modify a game I had developed for my own Reflex system Angel/Demon to the Storyteller format. Thus we have Angel/Demon: The Rapture. I hope in doing this I have make a useful addition to the World of Darkness, that can be enjoyed by all roleplayers. For I believe this game will add a new dimension to any World of Darkness game that you might be playing. Be it Vampire, Werewolf, Mage, etc.<br/><br/>What exactly is Angel/Demon: The Rapture. and how does it interface with the rest of the World of Darkness?  Well, Angel/Demon chronicles the battle that exists between the first born of god, Angels, and the minions of Lucifer, Demons. Or as they know themselves: The Cherubim and the Belial. The mythology surrounding these beings is probably known to most of you, being of Judo-Christian backgrounds, and no matter what your feelings about their true existence we must all understand that in the World of Darkness they are very, very real.<br/><br/>These are the final days. The end of the world is near, and soon all of virtue will be taken up in the Rapture. But Satan's power has grown strong, and his minions, the Belial, move upon the surface of Eden. Corrupting, twisting, defiling. But taking physical forms of their own, these beasts must take the bodies of humans if they are to continue their evil works. Possessing the body, suppressing the mind, corrupting all those around it. Leaping from body to body they continue their destruction, bring more and more mortals one step closer to eternal damnation. But this evil does not go unchecked, for God also has his agents working amongst his children. These creatures, The Cherubim, move through humanity by the same method as their enemy. From body to body, person to person. There mission, though, is not the anti-thesis of the Belial. They are not sent to earth to save humanity, that is not within their power. They are upon the surface of Eden in a desperate holding action against the Belial. They are buying time until the Judgment day. Facing and defeating the Belial where every they encounter them. It is to this desperate battle for time that the two sides raise their forces. Will the Cherubim drive back the Belial and allow the final days to came, or will the Belial swallow up the souls of all the mortals and leave no one to be taken up in the Rapture? Only the players of Angel/Demon: The Rapture. will know for sure.<br/><br/>"}, "69487": {"rpgdesigner": ["(Uncredited)"], "rpgitemversion": ["Text File Version"], "poll": [], "name": "Psychosis Players Introduction", "rpgartist": ["(Uncredited)"], "rpgproducer": ["(Uncredited)"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2729979.jpg", "usersrated": "0", "average": "0", "statistics": [], "rpg": ["Psychosis"], "rpgpublisher": ["Chameleon Eclectic Entertainment, Inc."], "rpgcategory": ["Core Rules (min needed to play)"], "rpggenre": ["Weird / Surreal"], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2729979_t.jpg", "description": "User Summary:<br/><br/>This is a stripped-down version of the full RPG containing just the core rules required to play the game.
