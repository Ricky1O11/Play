The value of each piece is hidden from the opponent. The 'Z' piece is placed on the fixed base point, and therefore known to the opponent. The goal is to capture the opponents&rsquo; 'Z' piece.<br/><br/>Each turn a player can move one of his pieces one place, either straight or diagonal. Or a player can use his turn to uncover the value of one of his pieces.

Includes SCARNEY, a skill game based on an entirely new game principle known as The Kaleidoscopic Principle; HIGH-LOW SCARNEY, the world's quickest ending skill game; SCARNEY CHECKERS, a checker style game wiht a Gin Rummy scoring; SCARNEY CHALLENGE, an unequaled point scoring track game; SOLITAIRE SCARNEY and MOKO SOLITAIRE, the two greatest all-skill solitaire board games ever invented. The perfect diversion for home and club.<br/><br/>* * *<br/><br/>The board consists of a 4 x 4 grid. The pieces are numbered 1-4 in four different colors (making 16 in all). In the basic game, each player removes a &quot;1&quot; piece, and then takes turns jumping and removing pieces (like in checkers, but orthogonally, not diagonally). Each piece that is jumped must be of a different color than the one which is moved.<br/><br/>The game ends when one player cannot make another move. If the remaining pieces are of different colors, the player who CANNOT move takes the remaining pieces and adds their total to his score. However, if the pieces are all of the SAME color, the PREVIOUS player (the one who made the last move) gets the points, plus a 10-point-per-piece bonus. If the remaining colors are all black, the bonus is increased to 20 points per piece.<br/><br/>Needless to say, there are numerous variations to these rules among the 39 other games that can be played with this set.<br/><br/>"}, "9525": {"boardgamedesigner": {"3": {"name": "(Uncredited)"}}, "poll": {}, "name": "Ludi at the Circus Maximus", "playingtime": "45", "minplayers": "1", "boardgamemechanic": {"2035": "Roll / Spin and Move"}, "yearpublished": "1989", "usersrated": "1", "maxplayers": "4", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic39672_t.jpg", "average": "3.5", "statistics": {}, "boardgamepublisher": {"2150": {"name": "Discere, LTD."}}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic39672.jpg", "maxplaytime": "45", "boardgamecategory": {"1050": {"name": "Ancient"}}, "age": "0", "minplaytime": "45", "description": "A combination of a race and a word game.

The results of these battles profoundly changed the course of English history and language. At Stamford Bridge, the Viking invasion of England was repulsed by the Anglo-Saxon army, while three weeks later, at Senlac Hill, the Norman invaders successfully defeated the Anglo-Saxon army and were able to conquer the whole of England. The outcome of the Battle of Senlac Hill was a direct result of the Battle of Stamford Bridge. In a campaign game, players play the Battle of Stamford Bridge first. Then the Battle of Senlac Hill is played with an order of battle determined by the outcome of the Battle of Stamford Bridge. Either game may be played independently of the other.<br/><br/>1066 uses a revolutionary innovation in wargaming entitled the MOVEMENT RESOLUTION SYSTEM. There is no die to throw nor any card to choose. The result of an attack depends entirely upon how intelligently you move, not the luck of the die. The MOVEMENT RESOLUTION SYSTEM consists of the attacker moving adjacent to an enemy unit, then both players moving one hex simultaneously. The result of this move determines the result of the attack.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": {"110095": "TSR First Edition"}, "name": "William the Conqueror: 1066", "playingtime": "120", "boardgamemechanic": {"2026": "Hex-and-Counter"}, "average": "6.73148", "usersrated": "27", "boardgamesubdomain": {"4664": "Wargames"}, "boardgamefamily": {"14759": "Country: England"}}, "9565": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic184684.jpg", "poll": {}, "boardgamedesigner": {"710": {"name": "Gerard Christopher Klug"}}, "statistics": {}, "yearpublished": "1986", "maxplayers": "2", "age": "8", "boardgamepublisher": {"123": {"name": "Victory Games (I)"}}, "maxplaytime": "90", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic184684_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "90", "boardgamecategory": {"1022": {"name": "Adventure"}}, "description": "Using the famous movie assault on the secret rocket base from  You Only Live Twice , the James Bond 007 Assault Game creates a unique opportunity for role players and simulation gamers to come together in a fast-paced, exciting game of commando combat!

Once a card has been matched, it scores a point for the player, and the one with the most points at the end of the game is the winner.<br/><br/>The game includes a set of 24 unique plastic animals, 24 green tubes (film cannisters), and 24 search cards.  One animal is hidden in each tube, and these tubes are then distributed evenly among the players.  Each player is also given two &quot;search cards&quot;; each of these cards depicts a set of four of the animals.  Players try to locate all of the animals on one or both of their cards by asking other players for the ones they need.  If the acting player asks someone for an animal they are holding, that tube is passed to the acting player; as a reward, they can continue asking for more animals.  However, if the player they asked DOES NOT have the animal, the player's turn ends.  Once a player has all the animals needed to complete one or both of his search cards, he can reveal the card(s) and the animals to score 1 or 2 points.

But the true hope of the Free Peoples lies with the quest of the Ringbearer: while the armies clash across Middle Earth, the Fellowship of the Ring is trying to get secretly to Mount Doom to destroy the One Ring. Sauron is not aware of the real intention of his enemies but is looking across Middle Earth for the precious Ring, so that the Fellowship is going to face numerous dangers, represented by the rules of The Hunt for the Ring. But the Companions can spur the Free Peoples to the fight against Sauron, so the Free People player must balance the need to protect the Ringbearer from harm, against the attempt to raise a proper defense against the armies of the Shadow, so that they do not overrun Middle Earth before the Ringbearer completes his quest.<br/><br/>Each game turn revolves around the roll of Action Dice: each die corresponds to an action that a player can do during a turn. Depending on the face rolled on each die, different actions are possible (moving armies, characters, recruiting troops, advancing a Political Track).<br/><br/>Action dice can also be used to draw or play Event Cards. Event Cards are played to represent specific events from the story (or events that could possibly have happened) that cannot be portrayed through normal gameplay.

See also J\u00e4gersro and M\u00e5nvalla med V5.<br/><br/>A full game consists of six starts divided into three phases (2 starts each). Before each phase, horses are auctioned off to the players; each player gets 2, 4 or 6 horses depending on the number of players. After each phase, players can keep only one horse from the preceding phases, the rest are auctioned off again. Auction is followed by training which is played on a short &quot;training track&quot; on the game board; here the horses can get better - each horse has a value from -5 to +5 which will help/hinder in the roll-and-move race - and the players may also get cards for later use during the actual race.<br/><br/>Results of the training define starting positions for the race and also give some clue as to each horse's capabilities, so now it's time for betting. A player can bet on up to 2-3 horses, depending on the number of players; betting is secret, and a player can freely bet on any horses, including their opponents'.<br/><br/>The actual race is conducted as roll-and-move using 2 dice. A special die is used for moving the horses, adding or subtracting their individual modifiers, and a regular d6 is used to determine if a player must pick a race card (on 1 or 6). These affect the race directly and often quite drastically; some may be saved for later use.<br/><br/>After the race the winning horse gets it's modifier increased by one step, all bets are revealed, money paid out from the bank and preparations made for the next race. Horses that competed in a race may not compete in the immediate next one - this is why the players have several. After the 2nd and 4th races, the auction phase is repeated.<br/><br/>At the end of the game, a bonus is paid to players who managed to bet on the winning horse in 5 or 6 races, any bank loans are paid back, and winner is the player with most money.<br/><br/>Approximate play sequence:<br/><br/>1) Auction - buy a number of horses<br/>2) Train them for the race<br/>3) Select horses for race 1<br/>4) Betting phase<br/>5) Run short race<br/>6) Pay winner, both race and betting money.<br/>7) Repeat 3-6, but with long race<br/>8) repeat 1-6 twice<br/>9) Pay bonus to anyone who has picked the winner in at least 5 of the 6 races.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": {"168604": "Alga Swedish Edition"}, "name": "Travspelet med V65", "playingtime": "180", "boardgamemechanic": {"2012": "Auction/Bidding"}, "average": "5.76875", "usersrated": "64", "boardgamefamily": {"22783": "Admin: Better Description Needed!"}}, "9611": {"boardgamedesigner": {"3": {"name": "(Uncredited)"}}, "poll": {}, "name": "Boggle Jr. Numbers", "playingtime": "10", "minplayers": "1", "yearpublished": "1992", "usersrated": "3", "boardgamefamily": {"10257": "Boggle"}, "maxplayers": "2", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic90132_t.jpg", "average": "7", "statistics": {}, "boardgamesubdomain": {"4665": "Children's Games"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic90132.jpg", "boardgameversion": {"91260": "Parker Brothers Edition"}, "maxplaytime": "10", "boardgamepublisher": {"28": {"name": "Parker Brothers"}}, "boardgamecategory": {"1041": {"name": "Children's Game"}}, "age": "3", "minplaytime": "10", "description": "Boggle Jr. Numbers is a childrens game for Ages 3 - 6.

Be careful, though, as a profligate country can end up being consumed by revolution.<br/><br/>From the designer:<br/>Think of Civilization/Age of Renaissance set in the 18th century. Players take the role of one of the major powers of the period and fight in both Europe and the colonies. The twist to the game is that in each war, players must form into two alliances. Once allied with a player, you cannot fight each other. This means that you do not have the backstabbing of Diplomacy to worry about; if he's allied, he's with you until the end of the war. This means that a player has to think carefully about who he wants to fight against and who he wants to ally with. Very often he will want to ally with his natural enemy and go to war with the guy who doesn't really want to fight him. On top of this, you have lots of improvement tiles that you buy to shape your empire, plus alliances with minor powers, and the possibility of going into revolution.

Einfach Genial, players take turns placing colored domino-style tiles on a game board, scoring for each line of colored symbols that they enlarge. The trick, however, is that a player's score is equal to her worst-scoring color, not her best, so she needs to score for all colors instead of specializing in only one or two.<br/><br/>In more detail, the game includes 120 domino-style tiles, each consisting of two conjoined hexes; each hex has one of six colors in it, with most tiles having different-colored hexes. Each player has a rack with six tiles on it, and on a turn a player places one tile from her rack onto two hexes of the game board. For each hex on this tile, she scores one point in that color for each hex of the same color that lies adjacent to it and each hex in a straight line from it. If a player brings the score of a color to 18, she immediately takes another turn. At the end of her turn, she refills her rack to six tiles. (Before refilling her rack, if she has no tiles on it that contain hexes in her lowest-scoring color, she can discard all of her tiles, then draw six new tiles from the bag.)<br/><br/>When no more tiles can be placed on the game board or when one player scores 18 in each color, the game ends. Players then compare their lowest scores, and whoever has the highest low score wins.<br/><br/>Ingenious includes rules for solitaire and team play; in the latter case, two teams of two play, with each player not being able to see his partner's tiles and teams keeping a combined score that maxes out at 36 instead of 18.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "1", "boardgameversion": {"24887": "999 Games Dutch First edition"}, "average": "7.16975", "name": "Ingenious", "playingtime": "45", "boardgamemechanic": {"2040": "Hand Management"}, "age": "10", "usersrated": "13109", "boardgameaccessory": {"139601": "Ingenious: Score Tracker Overlay"}, "boardgamesubdomain": {"4666": "Abstract Games"}, "boardgamefamily": {"3854": "Ingenious"}}, "9675": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1191603.jpg", "poll": {}, "boardgamedesigner": {"6": {"name": "Martin Wallace"}}, "statistics": {}, "yearpublished": "2004", "maxplayers": "4", "boardgameartist": {"12382": "Tanja Donner"}, "boardgamepublisher": {"37": {"name": "KOSMOS"}}, "maxplaytime": "30", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1191603_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "30", "boardgamecategory": {"1009": {"name": "Abstract Strategy"}}, "description": "The route-building game genre can be counted as the greatest passion of English game designer and history teacher Martin Wallace. And with La Strada, he has come up with a particularly clever road-building game. Everything &ndash; from the rules to the game play &ndash; is devilishly simple. The game lets players claim successes throughout the game, and turn-by-turn one reaches one or even multiple goals. But at the end, someone else wins? How did that happen?<br/><br/>The game features a variable game board, built up out of hex tiles that depict easily traveled flatland, forests, or hills. Before the start of the game, nineteen different settlements (ranging from cities to tiny villages) with varying victory point values are randomly placed onto those spaces featuring a gray symbol. Each player then places his or her starting marker onto a chosen flatland tile. The object here is of course to try to put your starting marker near as many high-value cities as possible.<br/><br/>The object of the game is to connect together as many settlements with your roads as possible, in order to get as many victory points as possible. The catch is that settlements award fewer and fewer victory points the more players connect to them. The cities are like pies: the more people want a slice, the smaller the slices have to be.<br/><br/>Building streets is very simple. One a player&rsquo;s turn, he receives six gold pieces. Each street segment costs two gold to build over flatland, three over forest, and four over hills. Players can build as many segments as they can afford on their turn, provided that they end at a settlement and don&rsquo;t intersect any other streets on the way. Put simply: players can&rsquo;t end a street in the middle of nowhere and then keep building next turn. Streets have to reach their destination at the end of each turn.<br/><br/>Once a settlement has been reached, and then the player gets to put one of their trade markers on it. Note that streets can intersect each other only at the settlement locations. If a player doesn&rsquo;t use up all of his gold on his turn, then he can save it for the next turn (where he will also get another six gold to play with again). Players aren&rsquo;t allowed to spend more than ten gold pieces on their turn, though, so you can&rsquo;t save forever.<br/><br/>The game ends when one player can&rsquo;t build any more roads or doesn&rsquo;t have any trade markers left.<br/><br/>Scoring then occurs. A scoring example for a city: The city is worth five victory points, but only if it was connected to by a single player. A doubly connected city is worth four points for each player, while a triply connected city is only worth three each. Cities connected to by four players are only worth two points. This decreasing point system also counts for smaller settlements, worth between four and two victory points. A nicely thought out sorting system ensures that the end game scoring doesn&rsquo;t turn into a math exercise. Naturally, the player with the most victory points is the winner. In the case of a tie, then the tied player with the most gold left is the winner.<br/><br/>La Strada is a very simple game: build roads and connect cities. But it&rsquo;s not that easy to get ahead with the scores. It&rsquo;s every player&rsquo;s dream to claim a fat five point city all to themselves &ndash; but a player who spends too much energy trying to protect an investment will find that his other road-building options become tighter.<br/><br/>[Text is from a preview by Spielbox]<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": {"32061": "English edition"}, "name": "La Strada", "playingtime": "30", "boardgamemechanic": {"2001": "Action Point Allowance System"}, "average": "6.19812", "usersrated": "1260", "boardgamesubdomain": {"5499": "Family Games"}, "age": "10"}, "9676": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic40372.jpg", "poll": {}, "boardgamedesigner": {"3": {"name": "(Uncredited)"}}, "statistics": {}, "yearpublished": "1988", "maxplayers": "4", "age": "4", "boardgamepublisher": {"20": {"name": "Milton Bradley"}}, "maxplaytime": "10", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic40372_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "10", "boardgamecategory": {"1032": {"name": "Action / Dexterity"}}, "description": "The Silly Dillys are plastic slinkies with a head on one end and suction cup feet on the other.

The squares making up the orbits are numbered according to the atomic numbers of the elements from Hydrogen (1) to radon (86).<br/><br/>The number of counters a player has depends on the number of players.  Two players have eight counters each, three players have six counters each, and four players have four counters each.<br/><br/>Players take turns to roll both dice.  The scores obtained on the dice may be used as a total, or as individual dice scores, to move the player's pieces to their best advantage.  For each six thrown, the player may move one piece into play, and roll that dice again.  The player does not have to move a piece into play unless he or she has no pieces in play already.<br/><br/>The players move their pieces along the track until they complete a circuit and land directly on a jump square.  When a piece lands on a jump square it is elevated to the next highest quantum level.  When a piece moves up a level, the controlling player gets an extra roll of one dice.<br/><br/>If a player's piece lands on the same square as an opponent's piece, Blatting occurs.  The piece that is Blatted moves down one energy level whilst the piece doing the Blatting moves up a level.  If a player's piece passes an opponents piece, Zapping occurs.  The piece that is Zapped moves down one energy level, but the piece that Zapped it does not move up.  A piece that is Zapped can Blat any piece that it lands on.  Thus both Blatting and Zapping are subject to chain-reaction.<br/><br/>To win the game a Quantum Jump must be achieved.  This is done by having a piece positioned on the yellow flash square, situated in the fourth energy band, at the same time as there are exactly half the total available number of player-counters in play.<br/><br/>"}, "9678": {"boardgamedesigner": {"3": {"name": "(Uncredited)"}}, "poll": {}, "name": "Glory", "playingtime": "10", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": {"2035": "Roll / Spin and Move"}, "yearpublished": "1980", "usersrated": "0", "maxplayers": "4", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic40370_t.jpg", "average": "0", "statistics": {}, "boardgamepublisher": {"394": {"name": "Morning Star Games"}}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic40370.jpg", "boardgameversion": {"160234": "First Edition"}, "maxplaytime": "10", "boardgamecategory": {"1094": {"name": "Educational"}}, "age": "8", "minplaytime": "10", "description": "Glory embodies a new, fresh experience in bible study and Christian living.

The diamond is a track in which a plastic base runner can move around the bases. The batter turns on the board to have his batters run, and turns it off to have them stop at a base.<br/><br/>Attached to one end of the field is a large metal &quot;fence&quot;, which includes the scoreboard and an area above which home runs can be hit. The other end of the field has a smaller metal shield, containing a replica of the strike zone.<br/><br/>The pitcher must use a plastic arm to flick a small magnetic chit (the &quot;ball&quot;) onto this shield. Behind the shield, the batter must try to figure out where the ball landed on the shield -- and can either take the pitch (for a strike or a ball) or whack the back of the shield with a different plastic &quot;bat&quot;. If the bat is struck near the ball, the ball will generally fly further -- sometimes even hitting your opponent in the face.<br/><br/>The rest of the board is the ball field, with clearly marked sections for &quot;outs&quot; where the fielders are. If the ball is smacked anywhere else, the fielder must flick the ball into the base areas with the pitching flicker, before the runner gets there.<br/><br/>"}, "9727": {"boardgamedesigner": {"1568": {"name": "Helmut Dressler"}}, "poll": {}, "name": "Play Net", "playingtime": "60", "minplayers": "2", "yearpublished": "1985", "usersrated": "6", "boardgamesubdomain": {"4666": "Abstract Games"}, "maxplayers": "4", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic40646_t.jpg", "average": "6.33333", "statistics": {}, "boardgamepublisher": {"906": {"name": "Play Net Spieleverlag"}}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic40646.jpg", "boardgameversion": {"249004": "First edition"}, "maxplaytime": "60", "boardgamecategory": {"1009": {"name": "Abstract Strategy"}}, "age": "8", "minplaytime": "60", "description": "Play Net is a board game based on the concept of Petri nets, which are graphical tools that describe the mathematical processes behind systems with many components.<br/><br/>The game board is illustrated with a network of many nodes: four are starting points and one is the finishing point.  Starting with a colored personal token and six grey neutral tokens, each player's goal is to move his or her personal token to the finishing point.<br/><br/>The nodes are interlinked by directional gateways.  A node can have only one entry route from another node, but it might have exits to two others.  Token movement follows the rule that to enter a node, all entries through the gateway must be occupied, and its exits clear.  Players take turns to place their tokens and move everyone's tokens if movement conditions are satisfied, taking back neutral tokens under certain circumstances.<br/><br/>The first player to reach the finishing point wins.  The game ends at that point if the players agree, or they can play till all positions are decided.<br/><br/>"}}
