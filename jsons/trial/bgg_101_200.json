When a card is played, the cars are advanced the number of spaces indicated in order from top to bottom.  However, if the track is blocked, then that movement is lost, so the idea is to use the cards that help your opponents (which you'll likely have to play eventually) only when they won't be able to take advantage of the movement.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "This classic game of the Fantasy Monster Slug-a-thon is a standby from the The Avalon Hill Game Co of yore.  The game still has a very devoted following, which is a tribute to the depth of the various strategies and approaches.  The game is divided into two realms, the masterboard and the battleboards.  On the masterboard, legions of mythical creatures roam about trying to recruit bigger and badder monsters and kill opposing legions in the process.  When a combat occurs, the action moves to the corresponding battleboard type corresponding to the area the fight is taking place in.  After lots of dice are tossed, the army that remains standing is returned to the masterboard with the spoils of war: points.<br/><br/>The points are used to recruit Angels and Archangels and to augment the leader character of the player's army: The Titan.  As the points increase, the Titans become ever more powerful; at game end, the titan is able to kill most other character with a single blow. But be careful: If the Titan dies, the player is out of the game.<br/><br/>The last Titan standing is the ruler of all, and winner of the game.<br/><br/>",

To decide which unlucky soul will be the victim, players put numbered power cards in front of the creatures, with the lowest one going to the graveyard.  The jockeying for position and strategic diplomacy in playing the numbered power cards can be intense - but what makes this game even more interesting is that the players' place bets throughout the game which will sometimes allow them to use a creature's special power in battle!<br/><br/>The winner at the end of the game is the bettor who's raked in the most winnings - just another day in the life of a fantasy monster gambler.<br/><br/>Titan: The Arena is actually a reworking of a Reiner Knizia game called Grand National Derby, but The Avalon Hill Game Co's remake was quite significant from a gameplay standpoint.<br/><br/>The Titan: The Arena printing is often confused with its namesake, Titan.

Playing Victims, Suspects, Scenes, and Evidence-melds, players try to build a case against various suspects for the famous Jack the Ripper serial murders.  Whichever suit has the most cards played in it when a player goes out is the guilty party, but if all the Victim cards come out before the end of the game, the Ripper might escape, giving the player who produced that card a significant point allowance.<br/><br/>This is #1 in the Mystery Rummy series.<br/><br/>",

The game has a beautiful assortment of large, thick tiles to represent the cities. Players bid on a single building tile every turn, with half the proceeds going to the auctioning player. When a player is ready to start construction of his city, the tiles are laid out in order with the single restriction that not two touching tiles are the same type. The building types are city halls, churches, towers, and gates. When the one of the two draw piles is exhausted, the cities are judged for symmetry, with the highest scoring city winning.<br/><br/>Rules apply to either game:<br/><br/>Within two decks of 20 cards are contained the City Wall, Towers and Gates, Churches, City Halls, etc. During play, one of the decks lies face up, the other face down. There are three parts to each player's turn. First, the player rolls a die in an attempt to better his finances (1 to 5 on the die; the sixth side gives a sabotage-counter instead). Second, he alone may look at the top hidden card before he makes an offer on either of the two top cards from the two decks. The other players then bid on the two cards. If the player (the Auctioneer) makes the highest bid, he may take the card and pay the bank. If, on the other hand, one of the other players buys the card, that player pays half the money to the bank and half to the Auctioneer. Third, a player may either build (lay down another card on his city) or sabotage a City Card of another player. The player receiving the sabotage must then pay the value of the card or remove it.<br/><br/>The game ends when either of the decks is depleted.<br/><br/>"

Players hold a hand of cards that correspond to numbered plots on each bank, and they place knights in open plots for which they hold the corresponding cards.  After establishing duchies, players attempt to expand them to include more plots of land, as well as buildings - such as castles, cathedrals, and cities. These buildings both add to the value of a duchy and provide their owners with advantages during game play.  Combined with a uniquely Knizia-style scoring system, this game has some very interesting dynamics.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "It is 13th century Italy. Trade is flourishing between the city-states and the Levant. Venice, Florence, and Genoa are all bursting with wealth. However, each city-state is also plagued with a weak national army, leaving them defenseless against invasion from their envious neighbors. Enter the Condottiere. <br/> As veteran English soldiers returned from the Crusades, Italy found itself with an influx of desperate and capable men. These hired swords were contracted to fight for individual city-states by an agreement known as a condotta. The most elite of these men were the mercenary leaders known as the Condottiere.<br/><br/>The object of Condottiere is to acquire four connected provinces in renaissance Italy. To do this players auction off different provinces on the board and bid on these provinces with a hand of cards representing mercenaries, seasons, scarecrows, and political figures. However, unlike standard auctions in which only the highest bidder loses their bid, in Condottiere every player loses their bid.  Players are, in effect, bidding the number of troops they are willing to lose in order to win a province. However, several special effect cards shake the contests up and keep the players guessing.<br/><br/>",

Those features, along with an unusual scoring system (you want to be really strong in two suits and really weak in the other two) and the fact that the winner of a trick gets to choose which cards to take, combine to create a very unusual game..<br/><br/>"

Each turn, players turn over a card and either purchase it outright or auction it to the group.  But when the contracts get bought, players will need to negotiate a deal, because it's very difficult to build a decent sized building on your own.  The deal making is vicious and cutthroat, ergo the name.<br/><br/>The 1995 edition features rules in English, Japanese, German, Spanish and French (see the Tidwell review).<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Classic negotiation game in which players take turns being &quot;The Boss&quot; arranging deals between specific players on how best to divide piles of money. Players can sabotage or kill deals they're not happy with.<br/><br/>Rarely is a game stripped down to its bare essense as cleanly as I'm the Boss! is. Up to fifteen deals can be made over the course of the game, and a player who is part of a successful deal will receive a certain amount of money.<br/><br/>How much money? Well, that depends on whatever deal is made among the players involved, as negotiated by that round's boss. Complicating matters quite a bit, however, each player has a hand of action cards that can be used to derail negotiations, insert themselves into a deal, take over the role of boss, and otherwise muck with the smooth flow of deal-making that other players had hoped to achieve. Nertz to them! If you want to make a deal, you gotta cut me a share!<br/><br/>Once nine deals have been made, a die is rolled after each subsequent deal to determine whether the game ends (with the odds increasing each time). Victory goes to whoever has the biggest bankroll!<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The French Revolution is famous in part for the use of the guillotine to put nobles to death, and this is the macabre subject of this light card game.  As executioners pandering to the masses, the players are trying to behead the least popular nobles.  Each day the nobles are lined up and players take turns killing the ones at the front of the line until all the nobles are gone.  However, players are given cards which will manipulate the line order right before 'harvesting,' which is what makes the game interesting.  After three days worth of chopping, the highest total carries the day.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "In Ta Y&uuml;, a game of connections, one side tries to extend from the starting tile in the center to reach the western and eastern edges of the board while the opposing side tries to reach the northern and southern edges.  On your turn you simply draw a tile and decide where to place it, extending the network of tiles already on the board.<br/><br/>Several refinements make this simple proposition into an engrossing game.  First, each tile is 3x1 (to be played on a 19x19 board) and has exactly three outlets (potential connection points). Second, your score is not simply the number of spots you've reached on one edge added to the number of spots you've reached on the other, but is the product of those two numbers.  So you can't just concentrate on one side and ignore the other, because zero times anything is still zero.  Third, on each side of the board there are three special points which score double if reached, adding a dab of focus to the choices.<br/><br/>Interestingly, you need to play both offense and defense and will often have to decide to which use to put a particular tile.<br/><br/>",

Five different artists have produced a bunch of paintings, and it's the player's task to be both the buyer and the seller, hopefully making a profit in both roles.  He does this by putting a painting from his hand up for auction each turn.  He gets the money if some other player buys it, but must pay the bank if he buys it for himself.  After each round, paintings are valued by the number of paintings of that type that were sold.  The broker with the most cash after four rounds is the winner.<br/><br/>Part of the Knizia auction trilogy.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Auf Heller und Pfennig takes participants to a medieval marketplace that looks remarkably like a plain matrix for square tiles. Each turn, players place tiles onto the board that modify (either positively or negatively) the amount of money to be made by the shops that share that tile's row or column. Three times the board is filled with tiles and shop money is earned, after which the player with the most money wins.<br/><br/>In Kingdoms, the English-language version of Auf Heller und Pfennig, players try to collect the most gold by establishing castles in the richest regions of the realm while avoiding hazards like dragons, swamps, and trolls. The 2011 edition includes detailed plastic castles, a streamlined rulebook, and the addition of a wizard tile&mdash;one that increases the rank of adjacent castles, multiplying their scores&mdash;previously available only at game conventions.<br/><br/>Re-implemented by:<br/><br/><br/>     Beowulf: The Movie Board Game<br/><br/><br/>",

Well, according to this Spiel des Jahres (1990) winner by Klaus Teuber, they like collecting old junk and then showing it off.  Players buy or steal various pieces of junk in the form of cards, trying to form the largest and oldest collection.  Built on a 'rock-paper-scissors' mechanism, this game gives all players a couple of choices each turn.  The trick is in guessing what your opponents are likely to do, and planning your choice accordingly&mdash;only after everyone's decision is revealed do you know for certain whether you made the right one.<br/><br/>Note: Hoity Toity (Uberplay, 2004) is for 3 to 6 players.<br/>      Spionage!

Like Cosmic Encounter, it is a game that generates a lot of player interaction through negotiation and bluffing, but that can be said of numerous unrelated games.<br/><br/>Players each take the role of one of the factions attempting to control Dune.  Each faction has special powers that overlook certain rules in the game.  Each turn players move about the map attempting to pick up valuable spice while dealing with giant sandworms, deadly storms, and other players' military forces.  A delicate political balance is formed amongst the factions to prevent any one side from becoming too strong.  When a challenge is made in a territory, combat takes the form of hidden bids with additional treachery cards to further the uncertainty.<br/><br/>The game concludes when one faction (or two allied factions) is able to control a certain number of strongholds on the planet.<br/><br/>Avalon Hill Complexity rating - 3<br/><br/>",

Players are represented on the board by a group of politicians moving through a network of committees, and need to seek support from their competitors to advance upward toward the Senate.  Supporting an opponent gains you prestige, needed in quantity at the end of the game.  Once all five Senate positions are filled, the game is over, and only players who have a politician in the Senate are eligible to win.

In the meantime their incomplete sets are vulnerable to various event cards and other players.  Players have a number of attack cards at their disposal which they can use to wreak havoc on opponents' gardens.  These cards range from bugs and pests to kids tromping through the garden, and even animals that chew up or pee all over the plants.<br/><br/>"

In order to help their quest, tribes will take various genetic advantages, which allow them to 'break' the rules of life.

        "description": "The world of horseracing has long been associated with cheating in all its forms.  But few games ever attempt to simulate that aspect.  Players are assigned a horse and must move it around the track by rolling a single die.  This would be rather boring if the game didn't allow for the players to bet on another player's horse, so the dilemma is whether to move your horse badly just to make it easier for the horse you bet on to win.  Even that could be boring, but then each player is issued cards which allow them to commit dirty tricks, for instance making a horse fall or forcing the winner to take a drug test.  All in all, it makes for some very interesting racing.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "It's really difficult to succinctly describe this game, so take a look at the pictures! Take It Easy is a true multi-player solitaire in which each player individually completes a hexagon-shaped board with spots for 19 hexagon tiles. There's no limit to number of players if you've got enough sets on hand. One person (the caller) draws a tile randomly and tells the others which of the 27 tiles featuring colored/numbered lines crossing in three directions, with numbers from 1 to 9, it is. &quot;The 9-8-7,&quot; for example. Each player then chooses which empty spot on his own board he'll play the 9-8-7. This is repeated until the boards are filled.<br/><br/>The idea is to complete same-numbered lines across your board. Scoring is calculated by multiplying the number on the tile with the number of tiles in the completed line. A complete column of three 9s is worth 27, for example...but a lot of players will hope for five 9s to fill the big column down the middle.<br/><br/>Take It Easy is often compared to Bingo because of the familiar pattern of a number being called and then everybody looking at their cards to play it, and then scoring if a line is completed. But that's as far as the comparison goes.  Bingo is sheer luck; Take It Easy is a game of skill.<br/><br/>",

Genetically engineered dragons pull trains across dangerous and unexplored territory. Connect cities, fight off forest creatures, and explore the underground to build a railroad empire.<br/><br/>Based on the Empire Builder system, this fantasy game puts classic building strategy and money management tools in a new venue. Players use erasable crayons on a special board and operate a rail empire. Perfect for an evening of fun and adventure with family and friends.<br/><br/>In Iron Dragon, probably the most elaborate of the crayon rail games from Mayfair Games, players are set within a fantasy world attempting to create an extensive and profitable rail network.  Players use crayons to draw their rail lines on the game board itself and use their existing rail lines to pick up and deliver commodities for payouts dictated by cards.<br/><br/>In addition to the standard mechanisms of Empire Builder, Iron Dragon introduces Foremen, which reduce terrain building/river crossing costs depending on their race (elves get a discount in the forest, dwarves get a discount in the mountains, etc.) and Ships, which allow trains to cross the sea between continents, avoid bottlenecks on land, or jump between two unconnected rail networks. Resources are much more segregated by region, with each region specializing in a few resources based on their back story (which is written in the manual).<br/><br/>",

Caesar wants Rome to invade Egypt while Cleopatra wants it to remain independent and both try to influence Roman officials to support their cause.<br/><br/>Players take turns and send their agents, i.e. play numbered cards from 1 to 5 to influence one group of Roman officials, Aedils, Quaestors, Senators, Pretorians and Censors. They can send fewer agents face-down or more agents face-up. Additionally they can play action cards like Assassins that take out opposing agents or scouts that reveal face-down agents. Players can decide if they want to refill their hand from the agent deck or the action card deck but once one of the decks is empty they don't have access to anymore of these cards.<br/><br/>After each players turn, a card from the voting stack is revealed and the group of officials that is indicated on the card casts their vote. The player who has the most influence points next to that group wins one official from that group to his cause and then removes his strongest agent from that stack.<br/><br/>The game ends when all the officials have picked a side and the player who has influenced most of them wins the game, with bonus points for the majority in each group and some simple hidden objectives.<br/><br/>",

Each player is assigned one of six different characters -- each with its own unique abilities -- but can pretend to be any character and use its corresponding powers.  Abilities are used to acquire 3 different types of goods, which can be spent to get clues to opponents' identities.  If the majority of the other players think you're pretending to be a character that you're not, you must either admit that you are not that character (and permanently lose the use of its power), or reveal that you are and win the game.<br/><br/>Re-implemented as:<br/><br/>    Die Erben von Hoax<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>",

        "description": "Pit is an open-outcry commodity trading game. The first edition in 1903 had a deck of 63 cards, 9 each of 7 commodities, each with a value (ranging from 40 for Flax to 100 for Wheat). Players offer trades by crying out the number of cards they want to swap (&ldquo;One! One! One!&rdquo;, or &ldquo;Three! Three! Three!&rdquo;) but not their identity. The winner of the hand is the first to collect all of one commodity, declaring &ldquo;Corner on Wheat!&rdquo; or whatever commodity has been collected. The winner of the hand scores points equal to the value of the commodity, and the winner of the game is the first to 500 points.<br/><br/>The 1904 Edition of Pit added much fancier artwork and the famous Bull and Bear cards, which provide wild-card and penalty features. The early editions allowed a maximum of 7 players, but later versions supported 8 and in at least one case up to 10.<br/><br/>Pit&rsquo;s designer, noted psychic Edgar Cayce, is often accused of having stolen the idea from the game Gavitt&rsquo;s Stock Exchange (G-S-E) invented by Harry Gavitt. While G-S-E claimed patents dating as early as 1896, it involved trading railway shares, and was only copyrighted and published in 1903, the same year as Pit.  In addition, the only related patent assigned to Gavitt is     US746492 A, filed October 7, 1903, and granted December 8, 1903.  Also hitting the market in 1903 was Bourse, a remarkably similar open-outcry commodity trading game from Flinch Card Co., using an 80-card deck with 10 each of 8 commodities, and Panic, using a 65 card deck with 8 each of 8 commodities and a Panic card, roughly equivalent to the Bull.  Pit, however, seems to have cornered the market on open-outcry games, as neither of its competitors were seen again after 1904.<br/><br/>Printings:<br/><br/>    Parker Brothers (1903-???)<br/>    Out of the Box Publishing (2004-Present)<br/>    Winning Moves Games (USA)<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Microbadges<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>",

        "description": "Each player controls bases/stations (in the form of little wooden cubes) which they use to attempt to build Economic Centers on the moons of seven planets in an alien planetary system.  After moving their tokens on to a planet, players use an interesting little device ('planet ring'/'wormhole' - functions like a blind draw bag) to select one of the tokens on the planet.  Players take actions by collecting sets of cards which correspond to the the various planets.  The game also features a unique trading system which facilitates the card collecting. Careful card trading and calculating risk of establishing economic centers, and some variants, mitigate some of the luck factor.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Game Summary<br/>Setup: 9 cards/player. Place 1 cube per planet per player, plus additional cube per planet matching cards dealt out; remaining cubes on earth. Each gets 2 special action cards.Each round: First, players may play a single special action card, in order. Then, Trade Step. Finally, Action Step.<br/><br/>Trade Step: Start player first plays cards (2-3) to offer, one at a time; other players simultaneously show cards to trade, different than offered. Start player must trade; recipient either accepts cards into hand, or leaves out. Clockwise from Start Player, next player with cards still in front of them either makes a trade or takes their cards back. Continue till 0-1 people left with cards in front; they take them back to hand.<br/><br/>Action Step: Start player takes 3 actions, then others take 2 each. Actions can be:<br/>- discard 2 cards, then draw 2<br/>- turn in set of 3-7 cards to send half (rounding down) as many cubes from earth to a planet<br/>- turn in set of 3-7 cards to advance Ship Level, Tech Level, or to make attempt to establish colony on a planet matching cards played: place cubes on that planet into the cosmic ashtray, randomize, then reveal up to as many cubes as attempts made. If reveal your cube, place it on a station; turn over. If other player's cube, send it back to earth.<br/>- Sets: if no wilds (&quot;pure&quot;), take appropriate bonus wild card matching the size of the set (if available); wilds can be used later as parts of sets<br/><br/>Then rotate starting player to the left. Game ends when all stations on 3 planets have been taken. Score VP shown on board (for Tech level, stations occupied, and cubes on earth). Most VP wins.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Another of Reiner Knizia's fleet of games, this one is about making profits by buying and selling business stock. Players use cards to manipulate the price of three types of stocks (oil, technology, and retail), and the buying and selling of the stocks is pretty severely limited. Short and sweet, this game is both elegant and abstract.  In a change from the original version, the three stocks have different levels of volatility.  Technology is the most volatile, oil is the least volatile but with higher dividends, and retail falls in the middle.<br/><br/>The original version of this game, Palmyra, was based around three trade routes which were represented by wooden amphoras.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "While the headline game, M&uuml;, is the main attraction, this deck of custom cards comes with rules for several games:<br/><br/>    M&uuml; - A complex trick-taking game. For 3-6 players, ages 12 and up.<br/>    The Last Panther - A trick-taking game similar to Hearts, where players try to avoid negative points. For 3-8 players, ages 10 and up.<br/>    Wimm&uuml;ln - A trick-taking game where players must estimate how many tricks they will take, akin to Oh Hell!. For 3-6 players, ages 8 and up.<br/>    Rumm&uuml; - A Rummy-like card laying game where players try to get rid of their hands by playing high-scoring combinations of cards. For 3-6 players, ages 8 and up.<br/>    Safar&uuml; - A card &quot;catching&quot; game using basic adding skills. For 2-4 players, ages 10 and up.<br/>    Calcory (only in the original 1995-1998 edition) - A memory and calculation game, where players push their luck to uncover the most cards. For 2-4 players, ages 7 and up. Calcory uses wooden markers that were not packaged in subsequent releases, so the game was dropped from the set.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>M&uuml; is regarded by many as one of the best offerings in the trick-taking genre.  Players reveal cards to declare their bids: the highest bidder becomes the Chief and the second highest bidder is the Vice.  Both the Vice and Chief choose a trump (either number or suit), and then players try to capture tricks to score the most points.  The Chief chooses a partner and tries to cover the bid to score bonus points, while the Vice and remaining players seek to stop the Chief from reaching his goal.<br/><br/>The deck consists of 60 cards in 5 different colored suits.  Each suit contains cards numbered from 0 to 9, with two of each the 1 and 7 cards.  Cards also have 0, 1, or 2 triangles printed on them to show the point value of that card.<br/><br/>Mü & Lots More includes a a tweaked version of M&uuml; and a different set of games.<br/><br/>",

The deck is numbered from 1 to 98, with some of the cards having green bullheads and others having red bullheads.  In this game greens are positive points and reds are negative points.  As in 6 Nimmt!, players are constructing sets of cards, with the fifth card in a set taking the whole thing.  This time, however, players take their turns sequentially and can play one to three cards from their hands.<br/><br/>In a confusing twist, the Dutch edition of 6 Nimmt! is called Take 5! but is the progenitor game, not this game.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "This is a two-trump, trick-taking card game, with several twists.  At the beginning of the game, players draft tasks they intend to complete in order to win the game.  (Tasks include things like &quot;Take no tricks&quot;, &quot;Take 1 Trick&quot;, or &quot;Take No Red Cards&quot;.)  Then, all of the cards are dealt out in front of the players before each hand.  Row by row, the players draft cards, and the dealer declares who would have won each row's trick, if it had been played that way.  Players use this information to deduce what the trump number and suit are.  After all the cards are drafted, each player - except the dealer - selects one of the task tiles she drafted, which will be her mission for the hand.  The dealer is stuck trying to uniquely accomplish someone else's task for the round - but at least doesn't have to preselect which person's goal he is trying to &quot;steal&quot;.  The hand is then played in the traditional fashion, with each player trying to take tricks or not, based on the goal she selected.  The first player to complete five tasks wins the game.<br/><br/>Re-implemented by:<br/><br/>    Mü & Lots More<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>",

        "description": "Eurorails is another entry in the Mayfair Games crayon rail games, like Empire Builder and India Rails.  Its puzzle-piece board forms a map of Europe broken down into dots.  Players use different-colored crayons to draw rail from dot to dot, building their rail system.  A large deck of cards is used to determine how much money will be generated by picking up a particular commodity and delivering it to the listed city, with the payoffs being related to how far away the source is from the destination.  As players generate more money, they build successively larger and more comprehensive rail systems, hopefully connecting to almost all the major cities.  The goal of the game is to generate a set amount of money once you've linked all the major cities.<br/><br/>",

Elfengold adds an entire economic aspect to the game, which makes it much more similar to its Elfenroads predecessor. Players bid against one another to purchase the transportation tiles that are available each turn. To generate the gold for these purchases, players must make a choice each turn to either take gold or more cards. This can be a very difficult decision as tiles are useless without cards, and vice versa.<br/><br/>As is becoming normal, this expansion was released shortly after Elfenland won Spiel des Jahres.<br/><br/>",

This humorously entertaining game pits two players against each other aboard a spaceship.  One plays the ship's crew, trying to kill the evil and rapidly-multiplying aliens controlled by his opponent.  And although the crew members have several weapons available to them, they don't know what effect those weapons will have until they try using them in combat against the Awful Green Things. Originally appeared in the Dragon magazine #28.  The Outside the Znutar expansion, published in Dragon magazine #40, is included in the box in the Steve Jackson Games versions of the game.<br/><br/>A similar but more serious game is The Wreck of the B.S.M. Pandora.<br/><br/>Supplemental articles were published in TSR's Dragon Magazine including:<br/><br/>&quot;The Awful Green Things From Outer Space&quot; Tom Wham - Issue 28 (page 26) <br/>Addenda &quot;Outside the Znutar&quot; Tom Wham - Issue 40 (insert)<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Before I Kill You, Mr. Bond is a silly, stupid game straight from the Cheapass Games playbook. In it, players take on the role of villains building their remote fortresses and capturing secret agents. When one is captured, he can be killed right away, but what's the fun in that? The real points come when you slowly reveal your secret plan to him &mdash; or leave him to be eaten by sharks. Of course, that's where the risk is, too, and the longer you postpone the kill, the greater the likelihood that another player will produce a card that allows the agent to escape and destroy your fortress.<br/><br/>Reissued in color in 2004 as James Ernest's Totally Renamed Spy Game (with many more cards), then reissued again in 2016 as Before I Kill You, Mister Spy...<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Epic Railroad Building in North America<br/><br/>Discover a modern North American classic.  Celebrate one of our most vital and enduring passions: railroads.  Use your initial investment to build track.  Then pick up commodities where they are grown, mined, or manufactured and deliver them to a lucrative place of demand.  Complete a delivery and make the money you need to buy larger, faster trains, and expand your railroad empire.  Win the game by building the most effective railroad empire!<br/><br/>The original and flagship of Mayfair's crayon-rails line allows players, using washable crayons, to draw their train routes over a map of North America.  Players start with an initial sum of money which they use to build short lengths of track during their first couple of turns.  For the rest of the game, players operate their trains over the track network drawn on the board to pick up and deliver loads to various cities, and then have the opportunity to add to their track network or improve their train.  The game uses demand cards which list three demands, each of a commodity to be delivered to a specified city for a given payoff.  Each player has three demand cards to provide opportunities for income.<br/><br/>Each turn consists of an operations phase and a building phase.  During the operations phase, trains are moved to cities where commodities are picked up at no cost and moved to one of the cities on that player's demand cards.  When the commodity is delivered, the player receives the payoff and trades that demand card for a new one.  Event cards are mixed in the deck with the demand cards.  When an event card is drawn the instructions are followed.  During the building phase a player may pay to build more track or upgrade his train.<br/><br/>A player wins by being the first to connect his track network to six of the seven major cities on the board and acquire $250,000,000 in cash on hand.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Family Business takes mob warfare to a new level of backstabbing, revenge, and general bloodthirstiness, which is what makes it such a blast to play.  Every player controls a 'family' and plays various cards to off other players' family members.  In a game with this little structure, it's possible for everyone to gang up on one unlucky soul, or for the damage to be fairly evenly spread.  Either way, the last family standing is victorious.<br/><br/>Each player starts with a gang of nine characters. To try to get rid of other gangsters, contracts are played on them. If these contracts are not blocked by anyone, the targeted gangster is placed on the hitlist. As soon as six gangsters are on the hitlist a mobwar is started. This means that, at the start of every turn, the first character on this list is eliminated. This goes on until the list is empty.<br/>Mobwars can also be triggered by cards being played. When no more than the last six or fewer characters are in play a constant mobwar is going on, until only one player has characters left.<br/><br/>In general players take turns clockwise, however, the turn goes to any player who plays a response card and then clockwise mode is resumed with the player next to him/her. Lots of interaction as players play cards to put gangsters on the list, save them, have them replaced, start a Mob War, or stop it...<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Chess is a two-player, abstract strategy board game that represents medieval warfare on an 8x8 board with alternating light and dark squares. Opposing pieces, traditionally designated White and Black, are initially lined up on either side. Each type of piece has a unique form of movement and capturing occurs when a piece, via its movement, occupies the square of an opposing piece. Players take turns moving one of their pieces in an attempt to capture, attack, defend, or develop their positions. Chess games can end in checkmate, resignation, or one of several types of draws. Chess is one of the most popular games in the world, played by millions of people worldwide at home, in clubs, online, by correspondence, and in tournaments. Between two highly skilled players, chess can be a beautiful thing to watch, and a game can provide great entertainment even for novices. There is also a large literature of books and periodicals about chess, typicially featuring games and commentary by chess masters.<br/><br/>The current form of the game emerged in Southern Europe during the second half of the 15th century after evolving from a similar, much older game of Indian origin. The tradition of organized competitive chess began in the 16th century. The first official World Chess Champion, Wilhelm Steinitz, claimed his title in 1886. The current World Champion is Magnus Carlsen, Norway. Chess is also a recognized sport of the International Olympic Committee.<br/><br/>",

During the game's two distinct phases, players first bid for several buildings then, after all buildings have been bought, sell the buildings for the greatest profit possible.<br/><br/>The original Ravensburger/FX Schmid edition (1997/98) has slightly different rules than later English editions, and only 20 buildings instead of 30.<br/> The Überplay 2005 Edition has new art, rules and card distribution changes, and it accommodates 3-6 players.<br/><br/>The Gryphon 2009 Edition uses the &Uuml;berplay art for the faces of the property cards, while replacing most other art.  The rules are the same as the &Uuml;berplay edition, with the exception of the rounding rule (which was stated in different ways in different printings of the &Uuml;berplay edition).<br/><br/>Rounding rule<br/><br/>The rounding rule preferred by the designer Stefan Dorra is that players get back half of their bid rounded DOWN (not UP), as confirmed in correspondence with him here and here.  A history of how the rounding rule has changed in different editions is documented here.<br/><br/>",

Players are each given an equal set of cards, which they randomly pick a hand of seven.  Each hand one suit is a trump suit, and one suit is a non-trump suit.  Players place one of their cards in front of themselves, and this continues until the hand ends.  At that time, the top card on their piles are compared and the best card picks his reward first, and the remaining reward going to the second place.  The reward cards give players points, and the highest total at the end of the game wins.<br/><br/>",

Its main 'simultaneous action' mechanism has been used numerous times: most recently as Sky Runner, or Olympia 2000 (v. Chr.), or even For Sale to a certain extent.  Players are given an equal deck of cards from one to fifteen.  Each turn, a prize tile is randomly selected from a pool.  The prize tile either has positive or negative points, and each player is attempting to gather the most positive points from these prizes.  Players secretly select one of their remaining fifteen cards, and reveal them simultaneously.  The highest card gets the prize (if positive), or the lowest card get the prize (if negative).  However, if two people play the highest (or lowest) card, they cancel each other out and the prize goes to the next in line...<br/><br/>Online Play<br/><br/>      Boardspace.net Real time, against humans or robot players<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>",

Included are more civilization advancements (both quantity and type), which give the players new options for advancement, as well as a slightly restructured commodity trading round, which has new resources and disasters to be traded. The most significant aspect of the game is a restructuring of the advancement/victory conditions, which removes the limits on advancement cards.  Some claim this makes the strategies more homogenous, while others claim the reverse is true.<br/><br/>The use of the word &quot;Advanced&quot; to describe this expansion is somewhat misleading.  The original Civilization game was already time-consuming and moderately difficult, and the expansion is a reworking of the original game, rather than an additive expansion.  Some rules simplify and make the game easier, while other rules like the expanded technology tree are more complex.<br/><br/>",

The gardener must try to block the mole's moves and fence him in quickly, while the mole must dig as many holes as possible before being caught.<br/><br/>Essentially, the mole may move any direction, horizontally or diagonally from square to square, while the gardener places boundary sticks down along the edges of the square, which the mole may not cross.  The mole and gardener may either move or place down a boundary stick, and move alternately.  Eventually, the gardener will hem the mole in completely and the round is over.  In addition, if the mole can move into flower beds, extra points are scored.  By moving to the center, the mole may also tunnel deeply to any selected square on the board, thus escaping the (by then) rapidly closing trap of boundary sticks.  Depending on how many moves this took, more or less points are earned by the mole.<br/><br/>Once points are totaled up, the roles are reversed and another round is played.  The winner is the player who scored the most points as the mole.<br/><br/>",

It remains there unless another piece (of either player) with a higher value reaches the opposite side, in which case it supplants this piece as the best musician. The game ends when no one can oust the reigning musician (which means no one has a piece left on the board of a higher value).

Players may attack as often as desired.  If one enemy territory is successfully taken, the player is awarded with a  bonus card.<br/>-  Moving a group of armies to another adjacent territory.<br/><br/>",

When all cards have been played, each tile is evaluated, and whichever player has the most cards played to that tile gets that tile's points.

First to get their 8th megalith down, wins.<br/><br/>Players take turns to put a numbered disc on the intersections of the lines. When you have the majority total in any direction, you claim that line by placing your megalith on the end point. Ties on a line are lost by the last placing player, a clever balancing rule which forces careful choices.<br/><br/>Stonehenge is a same game as Linea (Spielbox 1992, smaller board).<br/><br/>",

However the maniacal Devil Bunny is hopping about in a mad lust for blood thinking he'll get a ham by knocking you off.  Yeah, right, whatever.  Players seek to move their two markers along a wide-ish track.  The trick is that your pieces can only move diagonally, and your movement points are somewhat dictated by dice.  Plus, when you roll a certain number, the Devil Bunny lands on the leading player, which knocks him off the building and perhaps into the person below him.  Oh my.<br/><br/>",

The game still features the patented SPLIT half cards and looks much better than the original (design wise) and seems to have some adjustments to the rules.<br/><br/>In this surprisingly solid offering from Hasbro, players use cards to take actions on a board.  The cards depict halves of a standard deck of cards, and players attempt to match the halves with those next to the board.  Depending on the quality of the match (perfect, strong, weak), the action is likewise powerful or weak.  The object of the game is to place a series of your markers in a continuous line across the board.  Also the game is scalable for two to six players, with four through six using partners to keep the action interesting.<br/><br/>Re-implemented as:<br/><br/>    Split (Revised Edition)<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>"

        "description": "By all appearances, it's just two players taking turns laying stones on a 19&times;19 (or smaller) grid of intersections.  But once its basic rules are understood, Go shows its staggering depth. One can see why many people say it's one of the most elegant brain-burning abstract games in history, with players trying to claim territory by walling off sections of the board and surrounding each other's stones.  The game doesn't end until the board fills up, or, more often, when both players agree to end it, at which time whoever controls the most territory wins.<br/><br/>The earliest mention of Go (圍棋 (w&eacute;i q&iacute;)- &quot;surrounding game&quot;) appears in the &quot;Analects&quot; of Confucius (551-479 BC), while the earliest physical evidence is a 17&times;17 Go board discovered in 1952 in a tomb of the former Han dynasty (206 BC- 9 AD). There is a tangle of conflicting popular and scholarly anecdotes attributing its invention to two Chinese emperors, an imperial vassal and court astrologers. One story has it that Go was invented by the legendary Emperor Yao (ruled 2357-2256 BC) as an amusement for his idiot son. A second claims that the Emperor Shun (ruled 2255-2205 BC) created the game in hopes of improving his weak-minded son's mental prowess. A third says the person named Wu, a vassal of the Emperor Jie (ruled 1818-1766 BC), invented Go (as well as games of cards). Finally, a fourth story suggests that Go was developed by court astrologers during the Zhou dynasty (1045-255 BC).<br/><br/>A Go set, consisting of a very general-purpose grid and colored stones, can also be used to play a variety of other abstract strategy games, such as  Connect6, Go-Moku, Pente, and others.<br/><br/>",

Unlike standard Settlers, the game layout is not modular.  Instead the board features a split map, half of which has the goods-producing hexes of a conventional Settlers game where settlements will be built and the other half showing a closeup of N&uuml;rnberg where &quot;workshops&quot; will be built (in lieu of promoting settlements to cities as in the original Settlers).  The players also get currency for manufactured goods which in turn they spend on walls and towers to surround the city, which earn prestige points which ultimately count toward victory points.  Probably the most interesting other detail is that instead of rolling dice, a special deck of cards is used to reveal the production number -- and possibly an event -- at the beginning of each player's turn.<br/><br/>Belongs to the Catan Series.<br/><br/>",

Players take turn placing power cards in the columns, and after five of the six cards have been played, the highest bid takes the first luxury in the column, the second highest gets the next one up, and so on.  However, if you collect a second luxury item you already own, then the newest one replaces the older one, which could mean exchanging a lavish seven million dollar car for a paltry one million dollar one!

The main thing going on is that you roll the five dice on your turn and pick which three you want to play.  Each die has the five colors for the five cars in the race and one &quot;checkered flag&quot; side which means you draw a card.  The dice are numbered 1 to 5 (that is, each die has one of the five numbers), and the three you pick have to be played in order.  If you draw a card, it might instruct you to move a particular car, or the car in last place, or to spin a car out; or it might make you a &quot;Sponsor&quot; of a car, meaning you could get prize money for a car other than your main car.<br/><br/>"

        "description": "A game of political intrigue set in the Soviet Politburo. The game consists of a large number of politician cards, some of which form the first politburo. Politicians have certain stats (preferred offices, for instance) and an age.<br/><br/>At the start of the game, the players secretly note influence on ten politicians, graded from 10 (most) to 1 (least). Gameplay is not clockwise, but happens from top to bottom in the politburo. Whatever action the politician in a certain office can take is done by the player who reveals the greatest influence on the politician in question. Actions include accusing other politicians of espionage (potentially exiling them to Siberia), pardoning them, reshuffling the politburo and others. But each action a politician takes lets him (or in one case, her) age by one or more years. Once a turn each politburo member must face a health roll which can result in sickness marker or even instant death (the older, the most likely). At the end of each turn, the reigning head of state must wave to the crowd at the October parade without collapsing (which gets harder the sicker the politician is). A politician who succeeds in this three times makes the player who controls him/her the winner.<br/><br/>The original Fata Morgana edition included rules requiring the players to hold funeral speeches for deceased party chairmen and drinking vodka with it, for instance. The later Avalon Hill edition scrapped these rules and gave the game a less satirical and more serious tone.<br/><br/>The Jolly Roger edition provides three different KREMLIN games in one box:<br/><br/>1: The 'original' with fictional politicians, set in a USSR where KGB investigations send those found guilty to Siberia. This version will have victory conditions based on the original Fata Morgana rules.<br/><br/>2: A version inspired by the Avalon Hill variant titled 'Revolution'. Set in the 1920s, it uses historical politicians as well as fictional politicians. It's a more violent game as those arrested by the KGB are shot and removed from the game<br/><br/>3: A new version, set in the modern USSR and Russia, an era of entrenched bureaucracy and alternatives for escaping KGB persecution. This version introduces the concept of &quot;Going into Exile&quot; to avoid Siberia. It also includes modern politicians from the 1960s onwards, whether it is Kosygin or Putin and Gorbachev.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "[Careful: there are two similar games with Entdecker in the title. Don't confuse Entdecker with Die Neuen Entdecker (also known as Entdecker: Exploring New Horizons), a different game. In short - if your Entdecker's board has a scout trail leading to native huts, it's not this Entdecker.]<br/><br/>Entdecker starts with a blank game board that represents an unexplored sea. Tiles are drawn and placed on squares on the board. As the tiles are placed islands develop on the board and players pay to place settlements, bases, or scouts on these islands in an effort to become the most powerful discoverer of all. Completed islands yield victory points to all who have invested in exploration on an island, but of course the most points go to the player who has established the strongest presence.<br/><br/>Re-implemented by:<br/><br/><br/>     Die Neuen Entdecker or Entdecker: Exploring New Horizons<br/><br/><br/><br/>     In 2004, a smaller version of the Entdecker game was released, based on the online version available on the <a target='_blank' href='http://www.playcatan.de' rel='nofollow'>www.playcatan.de</a> site.<br/>         Oceania.<br/>    <br/><br/><br/><br/>     In 2007, the game system was revamped in a new &quot;Entdecker&quot;-series of 3 titles (so far):<br/>         Im Reich der Jadegottin (published 2007)<br/>         Im Reich der Wüstensohne (published 2008)<br/>         Im Reich der D&auml;monen (not yet published)<br/>    <br/><br/><br/>",
