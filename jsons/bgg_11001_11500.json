It uses a regular deck of 52 playing cards, it is about taking tricks to match a 'bid' (assigned in 7-4-1 versus bidding in Spades), with Aces high and a trump suit (declared in 7-4-1 versus always spades in Spades).<br/><br/>In 7-4-1, 12 cards are dealt to each of the 4 players; this leaves a 4-card kitty.  The dealer MUST try to take 7 tricks, but she gets to declare which suit is trump AFTER looking at her hand.  She then gets to pick up the 4 middle cards, and discard 4 face-down (could be from the kitty, or not).  Player 2 must get 4 tricks, player 3 for 1 trick, and player 4 need not take any.<br/><br/>After round 1, figure out how many cards more or less players got.  YOu get one point for every trick you make above your required tricks, and lose one for every trick you fail to make.  For the next round, a player who had MORE in the previous round can then pass one card per amount more to a player who had less; that lesser player must then pass their HIGHEST card in each requested suit.  Some pre-defined ordering for this is necessary; the player needing to make the most tricks has precedence over the player needing less.<br/><br/>For example, in round 1, the players take 6-2-3-1 tricks.<br/>So, the position 2 is now the new dealer.  Player in position 3 was +2 in round 1 (took 3, needed 1), and would ask position 1 for 1 suit, and position 2 for 1 suit.  Player in position 4 would then ask position 2 for 1 suit.  We've played where if the numbers over/under match (position 3&amp;2, 4&amp;1 in this example), then they could simply swap cards too.<br/><br/>Play then proceeds as described above.  Trump is declared AFTER the card-swapping is done.  And if the player who needed 4 in the previous round took NONE, then they can also look at the kitty too before declaring a trump!  However, they'd also have just given up 4 good cards to other players...\\<br/>Game ends after either 2 or 3 rounds, with everyone getting a chance at each position an equal number of times.<br/><br/>"}, "11016": {"boardgamedesigner": ["(Uncredited)"], "statistics": [], "name": "The Last Straw", "playingtime": "0", "minplayers": "2", "yearpublished": "1966", "usersrated": "17", "boardgamefamily": ["Animals: Camels"], "maxplayers": "2", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic45156_t.jpg", "average": "5.11176", "boardgamepublisher": ["Schaper", "Toltoys"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic45156.jpg", "boardgameversion": ["First Edition"], "maxplaytime": "0", "poll": [], "age": "0", "minplaytime": "0", "description": "Load the camel with straw, but don't be the one to add the straw that breaks the camel's back!

It is being distributed by ASGgames.<br/><br/>SherCo was the first of its kind to be played on a game board representing a composite stadium with a 28 x 28 numbered square grid. It also was the first to rate every player who played in at least one game in a season; and it was the first to provide its unique rating formulae so that customers could rate their own players and teams.<br/><br/>Each player is rated for batting average, home runs, triples, clutch-hitting, walks, strike outs, hit by pitch, base stealing speed, throwing arm, and fielding range and average; and each pitcher is rated for his ERA, innings of effectiveness, number of complete games, K/BB ratio, and home runs allowed.<br/><br/>The game still has all of these unique features (including a wind factor; automatic umpire; artificial turf rules; injury, hit and run, special and freak events, and error charts; and playing pieces representing the ball, fielders, batter, and base runners so that you can position players where you want them to play and watch every play unfold right before your eyes. There are also Fast Action Charts included with each season to get one-roll accurate results for games between other teams as you complete a season for your favorite team.<br/><br/>Each dice-activated result allows a patented &quot;stop-action effect&quot; to visually occur when a probable hit or probable out batted ball is plotted on a specific square on the stadium's playing field.  As the runners advance, the fielder moves to the ball, fields it and throws to where you want the ball to go in a quick, seamless sequence of turns.  A ball may drop in for a hit or become an out depending on where it is hit, the strength and direction of the wind, and where a defensive player is positioned. Depending on where you are playing, a long fly ball may be caught or go over the fence for a home run, or ricochet off the wall for a double or possible triple.<br/><br/>A solitaire or head-to-head game takes only 30-45 minutes to play, depending on the score. SherCo has also re-released its rules supplement for setting up SherCo Leagues of Baseball Simulation (a/k/a SLOBS) for short-season (e.g., 24-game) leagues that you can play with family and/or friends.  Additionally, SherCo will be offering another set of rules for &quot;Olde Tyme Base-ball&quot; for those interested in playing 1870-1920 seasons.<br/><br/>All 30 modern day ball parks have been beautifully redone to include new features such as the fountains at Kauffman Stadium, McCovey Cove at A&amp;&amp;T, Fenway's Green Monster, the fans swimming pool at Chase Field, and even the Big Apple Home Run display at Citi Field. The new SherCo game includes stadium layouts for each major league ballpark and the most recently-completed big league season (which is available every January 1).  There are many specialty sets of the vintage old-time teams, famous world championship series, greatest also-rans, and others available for the game.

With the recent Imperial victory at Breslau (November 22) Austrian forces under Prince Charles of Lorraine and Field-marshal Daun, the victor at Kolin, were only a battle away from that goal. They expected to fight this battle in the new campaign year which would begin in the coming spring.<br/><br/>For King Frederick II the loss of Silesia would not only be a devastating blow to his prestige but deprived of its resources, revenue and manpower Prussia's ability to continue the war would be desperately compromised. Rather than to allow the enemy to go unchallenged Frederick marched his remaining army of 40,000 men composed of Rossbach veterans and Breslau survivors against Charles' nearly 60,000 polygynous force of Austrians, Hungarians, Imperials, Bavarians and Wurttembergers.<br/><br/>On a frigid December 5th, in a season when armies usually sought the comfort of winter quarters, the opposing forces met on the snow covered fields surrounding the Silesian village of Leuthen. After deftly maneuvering around Prince Charles' flank Frederick's Prussians attacked with unprecedented fury collapsing the enemy line. However, despite this initial crushing blow the Austrians were able to reorganize their front and fight the Prussians to a standstill leaving the battle's final outcome still in doubt. Only after a climactic cavalry charge did the Habsburg army finally break and retreat to Breslau. Two weeks later the city capitulated and the Austrians evacuated Silesia. Although the war would continue for another six years Frederick would never again attain the level of success he did at Leuthen, his greatest victory.<br/><br/>Leuthen (Battles from the Age of Reason, Vol. 3) presents both gamers and students of the period with a colorful and meticulously detailed simulation with which to explore the actual events and possibilities of this definitive battle. Included is an historical commentary written especially for the game by the period's leading authority, Prof. Christopher Duffy.

Force marching from Silesia through blazing summer heat, Frederick races to bring about a decisive battle. On 25 August near the village of Zorndorf 43,000 Russians and 36,000 Prussians fight one of the most savage battles of the war. For nearly 10 hours they hammer one another, yet by day's end neither army yields, despite staggering losses - nearly half the Russians and one-third of the Prussians were casualties.

Brilliant flanking maneuvers, a spirit of improvisation, and further reinforcements created a miniature blitzkrieg. Syrian troops and leaders alike panicked. The call went out for help from brother Arab nations. Only the timely arrival of the Iraqi 3rd Tank Division halted the advance of near Damascus.

Games last 6 turns. The time scale, though not stated, is probably two days per turn. (The historical battle ran 12 days.) Units are German divisions (blue) and ahistorical Soviet &quot;corps&quot; (brown), plus a handful of smaller formations. They have combat and movement factors (e. g., 6-8 for the best German panzer divisions, 2-4 for a Soviet infantry &quot;corps&quot;). The Germans have several non-divisional panzer units that must be stacked with a German division in order to use their combat factor.  The Soviets have artillery and anti-tank brigades that can only use their combat factor in attack or defense, respectively.<br/><br/>Four bands of fortified lines dominate the map, one German line and three Soviet lines. The Soviet fortified lines are indicated as they existed in May, June and July 1943.  All four lines are used during the historical scenario but not all of the Soviet lines apply to some of the hypothetical scenarios.<br/><br/>Players alternate turns, each having a movement phase, combat phase and second movement phase for mechanized units. Zones of control are &quot;semi-active&quot; (requiring extra movement points to enter or leave). The stacking limit is three divisions or &quot;corps&quot;, plus one smaller formation, per hex. The Combat Results Table has the classic Eliminate, Exchange, Retreat outcomes. Supply lines must be traced over no more than 10 hexes to a rail line leading off a friendly map edge, with lack of supply halving movement and combat factors.<br/><br/>Air power is represented semi-abstractly by air units that can fly close support, interdiction, combat air patrol, air superiority or interception missions. There are no command rules, but a couple of optional rules try to suggest organizational differences between the two armies. These options are quite advantageous to the Germans, who, as in reality, need all the help they can get. One of these optional rules is the ability of the German mechanized divisions to not be completely removed from play on an Eliminate result, but be replaced by low-strength Kampfgrupen (this became a standard rule in later games).<br/><br/>The game includes six scenarios: historical and free setup scenarios for the historical July start date, hypothetical May and June German attacks, and two hypothetical August Soviet counteroffensives (one with a fixed and the other with a free setup). 255 counters<br/><br/>For its day, Kursk: Operation Zitadelle was a &quot;monster game&quot; and more attentive to history than many of its rivals.

The warriors include 30 plastic figures, including World War II soldiers, futuristic robots, aliens, a T-Rex-riding orc, a large dragon, and many more.  Each hero or squad has its own card that details both movement and combat abilities.<br/><br/>There are 2 large ruins and 85 tiles of terrain in the base game.  Some terrain tiles are large (up to 24 hexes) while others are small (1 hex).  There are water, sand, rock and grass tiles (in roughly increasing order).  Many different battlefields can be built by attaching and stacking the tiles.<br/><br/>The rulebook features two games: a basic and a master version.  In the basic version (designed for younger players &lt; 8 years), characters move, attack, defend, and have range -- but there are no special powers and some other rules are minimized and/or eliminated.  The master game includes special powers, wounds, engagement rules, falling rules, and a few other additions.<br/><br/>A battlefield/scenario book shows how to build five battlefields, layer by layer.  Each battlefield may have multiple scenarios, where the goals vary.  It can be opponent elimination, getting to a certain space, protecting a certain figure, or holding out for a certain number of turns.<br/><br/>Each unit in the Master Set has a movement rating ranging from 4 to 8, which is the number of hexes it can move in a turn.  Moving up a level counts as a hex; moving down does not incur that penalty. Moving down more levels than your height when moving from one hex to another counts as falling and you might take damage --unless you are falling into water.<br/><br/>Combat in the game is fairly straightforward.  You roll attack dice as listed on your unit's card (1 to 8 dice in the Master Set), and the opponent rolls defense dice equal to the number on their unit's card (1 to 9 dice).  Skulls rolled in excess of shields count as wounds (hero figures may have more than one Life).<br/><br/>The master game uses a point system in which players alternate drafting cards until they reach the pre-assigned point value for the scenario.  It's possible to bring a &quot;pre-fab&quot; army to the battle in order to save time.<br/><br/>The basic game is for two players. The master game is for 2 to 4 (and more) players.<br/>The game is eminently customizable, with many expansions which add more abilities, terrain, and options. There are also user-created maps, scenarios, custom units and advanced rules available online.<br/><br/>HeroScape: Rise of the Valkyrie is the original master set for the HeroScape series of games.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": ["Dutch edition", "English edition", "French Edition", "German Edition", "Hasbro Elite Onyx Vipers edition", "Italian edition", "Second Edition", "Spanish edition"], "maxplaytime": "90", "average": "7.41892", "name": "Heroscape Master Set: Rise of the Valkyrie", "playingtime": "90", "boardgamemechanic": ["Dice Rolling", "Grid Movement", "Modular Board"], "age": "8", "boardgameexpansion": ["66312", "72936", "80889", "30976", "41815", "25044", "26586", "31005", "28165", "22646", "16621", "15155", "16694", "22357", "42350", "22356", "22507", "30977", "15825", "53396", "19248", "21615", "101639", "25153", "101745", "25154", "37303", "39303"], "usersrated": "6946", "boardgamesubdomain": ["Thematic Games"], "boardgamefamily": ["3D Games", "Heroscape"], "boardgamepodcastepisode": ["BGTG 131 - 100 Great Games, part 1 (with Stephen Glenn &amp; Mark Jackson)", "BGWS 005 \u2013 Heroscape", "Episode 44: Heroscape", "Episode 8: Super Dungeon Explore: Forgotten King, Timecop, and Battleheart: Legacy", "Heroscape, DC Dice Master, Miniatures Talk - Boards &amp; Swords #41", "I've Been Diced! episode 25: Genres that do or don't work as boardgames"]}, "11171": {"boardgamedesigner": ["(Uncredited)"], "poll": [], "name": "Mastergame", "playingtime": "30", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": ["Pattern Building", "Point to Point Movement"], "yearpublished": "1982", "usersrated": "4", "boardgamesubdomain": ["Abstract Games"], "maxplayers": "2", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic429059_t.jpg", "average": "2.4675", "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["Invicta Games"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic429059.jpg", "boardgameversion": ["Invicta Cigar Edition", "Invicta First Edition"], "maxplaytime": "30", "boardgamecategory": ["Abstract Strategy"], "age": "0", "minplaytime": "30", "description": "CONTENTS<br/>Colorful shiny Boardgame<br/>2x 8 playing pieces<br/><br/>OBJECT<br/>To make a line of 4 pieces on touching squares<br/><br/>PLAY<br/>From the starting line, players move one of their pieces one vacant square only in any direction. <br/>A piece must never be moved onto a square having the same symbol as on the piece.<br/>A piece can not be part of a winning line unless it has made at least one move.<br/><br/>"}, "11173": {"boardgamedesigner": ["(Uncredited)"], "poll": [], "name": "Twisty Turtle", "playingtime": "15", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": ["Point to Point Movement", "Roll / Spin and Move"], "yearpublished": "1982", "usersrated": "1", "boardgamefamily": ["Animals: Turtles"], "maxplayers": "4", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic926806_t.jpg", "average": "3", "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["Spear's Games"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic926806.jpg", "boardgameversion": ["Spear's Games edition"], "maxplaytime": "15", "boardgamecategory": ["Animals"], "age": "0", "minplaytime": "15", "description": "CONTENTS<br/>a 8x8 squares boardgame with 4 starting corners<br/>5 turtle shells<br/>a spinner<br/><br/>OBJECT<br/>To be the first player to move his turtle-shell across the board to the opposite corner.<br/><br/>A player spins the arrow of the spinner.

The full campaign opens with the abdication of Emperor Diocletian (305 A.D.) and continues to the death of Julian the Apostate (in the 360's or 370's - the date is variable). Scenarios cover shorter periods, such as the fateful war between Constantine the Great and Licinius (313-324).<br/><br/>The map shows the Roman Empire in 305, divided into zones that, in turn, are grouped into 12 Dioceses, the Imperial administrative districts of that time. Surrounding the Empire are the zones of barbarian peoples and the rival Persian Empire. A turn is one year. Units have Points de Force (Strength Points) representing about 1,000 men each. Roman units come in three types: Ripenses, who cannot leave their home diocese, Pseudo-Comitatenses, whose ability to range far from home is limited, and Comitatenses, who can go anywhere in the Empire and beyond.<br/><br/>The opposing sides are unusual and may puzzle players who know little or nothing about this era. One player (dubbed &quot;Primus&quot;) represents the senior Emperor (&quot;Primus Augustus&quot;) and his allies, who may include another Augustus, one or two Caesars (junior Emperors), other Roman generals, and even non-Roman peoples. The other player (&quot;Secundus&quot;, misspelled &quot;Secondus&quot; in the rules) has his own set of Augusti, Caesars, generals and non-Romans. An important limitation is that each Augustus and Caesar must have a capital of his own, and only six capital cites are available at the beginning of the game. A seventh, Constantinople, may be constructed, though its advent is not a certainty. (Rome, by the way, is not one of the capitals; its political importance had long since faded.)<br/><br/>In the course of play, Primus and Secundus may swap positions as the result of either a successful usurpation plotted by the Secundus or the death of the Primus Augustus without an Augustus or Caesar to succeed him. In general, it is better to be Primus than Secundus, but it isn't impossible for a perpetual Secundus to win.<br/><br/>The Roman leaders are historical figures (38 in all), who enter the game at the same time as in actuality and run an increasing risk of death from natural causes if they aren't killed off sooner. Names are rendered in their French versions, e. g., &quot;Constance Chlore&quot; for Constantius Chlorus. A Leader is rated for &quot;Capacit&eacute; de Commandement&quot; (number of units he can command), &quot;Capacit&eacute; Politique&quot; (a variety of functions, such as determination of the initiative each turn), &quot;Valeur Strat&eacute;gique&quot; (ability to evade combat plus other functions) and &quot;Bonus Tactique&quot; (useful in battles). Many Leaders are also marked as Christian or Pagan, though religion has much less of an impact than it did in real life.<br/><br/>Very important to play are &quot;stratagems&quot;, which make it possible to embark on a usurpation against the other player, assassinate rival Leaders, spread plagues, trigger barbarian uprisings, pacify barbarians already at war with the Empire, inspire desertions from enemy ranks, and much else.<br/><br/>Turns have a variable number of movement/combat phases, determined by adding the valeurs strat&eacute;giques of the Primus Augustus and the highest rated Leader in the Secundus camp. The pace of the game thus depends on the quality of the current Leaders.<br/><br/>Movement and combat are straightforward. Leaders, accompanied by a number of units up to their capacit&eacute; de commandement, may move up to four zones, halting and fighting when they encounter enemies. Units without Leaders may move only one zone at a time. Battles are often bloody, but weakened or eliminated units quickly return  to full strength.<br/><br/>Players tally Victory Points at the end of each Turn. The list of achievements that garner VP's is long: victory in major battles (35 PF's or more engaged), control of Dioceses, defeat of non-Romans, presence of non-Roman troops in the other player's controlled territory, and so on.<br/><br/>Players must mount and cut the game's counters themselves, which is a non-trivial task. As a minor annoyance, the counters are a bit too big for the zones on the map.

A deck of 98 cards (printed in black and red) is shuffled and each player is dealt five cards.  The current player or storyteller begins to read a story from the story book and stops at the first blank.  The storyteller then flashes the bookmark to let the player know what color card can be used to fill in the blank as indicted in the story book.  If the player has an appropriate word card of the right color, the player reads the card aloud and discards the card.  If the player is unable to play an appropriate card, they must draw the next card from the deck.  That card must be played if possible.  If the card cannot be played, play passes to the next player to attempt to fill the blank.  Each of the word cards is worth from five to fifteen points.

The battle lasted from August 1942 until early February 1943.

The location of the actions would be on the great rivers of the eastern seaboard of North America. Such rivers would be the James, Mississippi and Yazoo. The rules have been designed with the specific objective of providing a playable game that gives the flavour of the period by imparting the major features and generalising on lesser matters. A brief outline of the conflict would go as follows. The two sides were known as the confederates(CSA) and the Union(USA). The union tended to have a much larger fleet. At the outset the union fleet consisted of mainly wooden vessels. The confederates quickly built ironclads(armoured vessels with extremely thick armour). These ironclads quickly proved wooden ships to be greatly inferior. This was illustrated several times when a single confederate ironclad would scatter four or five wooden ships. The CSA ships tended to be conversions . The quality of engines, materials and armaments varied wildly often toward the poorer end. The USA soon fielded some excellent ironclads along the famous monitor design which overall were better ships than the long CSA Ram/Ironclads.<br/><br/>As far as guns were concerned there are a few generalities that may give the player more feel for the period. The principles of fire and effect fell into two ideals. The first ideal was that of &ldquo;punching&rdquo;. Punching was the concept of the round going through the armour and causing great damage inside. Battering was the concept of smashing against the armour so hard that the plates would break off or the force would be transmitted to the area beyond the armour. Both methods have merit but it is punching that rules modern day thinking now that such items as fused shells and very high velocity guns are available.<br/><br/>To play this game there is an amount of equipment to be assembled.<br/>1. Ships to 1/600th scale.<br/>2. Enough 15mm scale figures and guns to represent the gun deck of the ship.<br/>3. A piece of card or model to 13mm scale upon which to put the figures, thus showing the exact position.<br/>4. Hexagons inscribed in 5.5&rdquo; circles for movement purposes. (2 for each ship)<br/>6. Some ordinary 1-6 sided dice.<br/>7. Some scenery for sandbars and shore batteries.<br/>8. Paper to note down damage.<br/>9. A blue cloth or similar.<br/>10.

But Leningrad was a long way from the German border, and the closer the Germans got to it, the more difficulties they encountered with terrain, their own lengthening supply lines, and stiffening Soviet resistance.<br/><br/>In mid-July, approximately 100 miles south of Leningrad at Soltsy, a surprisingly strong Soviet force of about six divisions struck the German armored spearhead and pushed it back. The 8th Panzer Division did not suffer the catastrophic losses claimed by the Soviet, but attack did cause the Germans in this sector to halt for three crucial weeks before resuming their drive on Leningrad.<br/><br/>In August the Soviets launched another counteroffensive, this time with ten divisions, against the German flank south of Staraya Russia. Just as the German offensive against Leningrad renewed, the Germans diverted critical motorized reserves to deal with the threat, winning a strategically barren victory far from their true objective. When the Germans did reach Leningrad, they lacked the strength to break into the city itself.<br/><br/>The battles of Soltsy and Staraya Russia may well have saved Leningrad.<br/><br/>Components:<br/>&middot; 22 x 34 inch map sheet (19mm hexes - double sided)<br/>&middot; 3 sheets of 5/8&quot; counters<br/>&middot; Rules book, Play Book, set-up cards, and player aid cards<br/><br/>TIME SCALE  12 hours per turn  <br/>MAP SCALE  1.2 miles per hex   <br/>UNIT SCALE  Battalions and Companies<br/><br/>DESIGNERS Vance von Borries<br/>DEVELOPER Tony Curtis<br/>MAP &amp; COUNTER ART Mark Simonitch<br/><br/><br/><br/>(BGG description:)Roads to Leningrad is a package consisting of two separate operational level games on WW II --the Battle of Soltsy and the Battle of Staraya Russa.<br/><br/>Scenarios: <br/>1. The Battle of Soltsy: Manstein&rsquo;s LVI (Panzer) Corps was assigned the road through Soltsy and was told to advance rapidly east to Novgorod and then north to cut Leningrad off from the rest of Russia. Manstein was on such a quick and tight schedule, he had no time to cover his flanks - a fact local Soviet commanders quickly exploited.<br/><br/>2. Counter-Blow at Soltsy: Led by the powerful and highly decorated 70th Rifle Division, the Soviets quickly surrounded German armor at Soltsy, stopped German motorized infantry in the swamps to the north, and raided German supply columns to the German rear. Von Manstein, unflappable in a crisis, organized a counterattack to allow the 8th Panzer to escape. The German 8th Panzer Division permanently lost about 30 tanks (with many others damaged) and retreated 25 miles. It was a Soviet victory that might have saved Leningrad.<br/><br/>3. Battle of Staraya Russa: In early August, the Soviet High Command prepared a surprise counter-offensive south of Lake Ilmen to relieve pressure on the increasingly hard-pressed armies defending Leningrad. Within two days, Soviet mechanized units had penetrated 35 miles and threatened to surround German X Corps. The Germans will clearly need reinforcements; can they hold on until Manstein's motorized troops arrive?<br/><br/>4. Manstein Attacks: To solve the deepening crisis at Staraya Russa, the German command called on Manstein's LVI Corps. On the 19th he struck, crushing the Soviet flank division in one day. In three days, he surrounded Soviet 34th Army, forced most of it to surrender, and then pushed on east. German play in this scenario depends on the mobility and timing of Manstein's troops. The Soviet player knows he is about to be trapped but maybe one more push would break the German infantry to the north.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": ["First edition"], "average": "7.50315", "name": "Roads to Leningrad", "playingtime": "180", "boardgamemechanic": ["Dice Rolling", "Hex-and-Counter"], "age": "12", "usersrated": "240", "boardgamesubdomain": ["Wargames"], "boardgamefamily": ["Cities: St Petersburg / Petrograd / Leningrad"]}, "11270": {"boardgamedesigner": ["(Uncredited)"], "poll": [], "name": "Engine & Cars Matching Card Game", "playingtime": "45", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": ["Set Collection"], "yearpublished": "0", "usersrated": "2", "maxplayers": "6", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic45834_t.jpg", "average": "5.75", "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["Merrimack Publishing Corp."], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic45834.jpg", "maxplaytime": "45", "boardgamecategory": ["Card Game", "Trains"], "age": "0", "minplaytime": "45", "description": "Collect enough cards to make several trains.

One's goal is to collect the most shells (similar to mileage cards). The quantity of shells one can pick up is based on the mode of transportation (food, bike, 4x4), and there are various problems that can slow you down (soft sand, no reservation, hot sand). You must be on vacation to collect shells (similar to the Go card), and there are things that can frustrate the vacation (hotel bill, food bill, beach gear bill, and gas bill); bills can be addressed with money or &quot;super solutions.&quot;<br/><br/>"}, "11286": {"boardgamedesigner": ["Alex Randolph"], "poll": [], "name": "Paradox", "playingtime": "0", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": ["Auction/Bidding", "Trick-taking"], "yearpublished": "2001", "usersrated": "19", "maxplayers": "4", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic63917_t.jpg", "average": "5.86895", "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["Piatnik"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic63917.jpg", "boardgameversion": ["German English First edition 2001"], "maxplaytime": "0", "boardgamecategory": ["Card Game"], "age": "10", "minplaytime": "0", "description": "Paradox is a deck of 44 cards in four suits of face value 0 to 10.

They take turns playing cards for themselves and their partners with trump shifting when they cannot follow suit. Cards are worth their face value (0 to 10), but tricks cost 20 points! Thus they want to take the valuable tricks and make their opponent take the costly tricks.<br/><br/>Buddy on your Left: a game for 3 players where each player's score is his own plus that of his left hand neighbor!<br/>A card is led then players in turn play cards either higher or lower than the lead card. As long as the played cards are lower, the pile continues to grow. As soon as a card higher in value than the initial card is played, that player sweeps the entire pile. Cards from 1 to 6 score their value, 7 to 10 are worth nothing. After the last card is played, you score for the cards you collected plus the cards your left hand opponent collected.

It's the Stock Market in a time warp!<br/><br/>You start with 100K ($100,000) and your goal is to be the first to reach $1 million. You do this by playing the Stock Market one card at a time. Each game card takes you back to January 1st of a random year in time, where two companies are pitted against each other in a head - to - head match-up.<br/><br/>These are real companies, with real ratings and real data from the year listed. You must pick one the companies and follow your investment through the year, stopping each quarter to assess whether you want to sell your stock, or hold to the next quarter. The Fourth quarter marks the end of the year, and the end of your turn.<br/><br/>On your next turn, travel to a new destination in time by picking another card and playing that year through.<br/><br/>Home Page: <a target='_blank' href='http://www.mrbigshot.com' rel='nofollow'>http://www.mrbigshot.com</a><br/><br/>"}, "11316": {"boardgamedesigner": ["Tim Lowell"], "poll": [], "name": "Battle Chips", "playingtime": "5", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": ["Simultaneous Action Selection"], "yearpublished": "2001", "usersrated": "1", "maxplayers": "2", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic46448_t.jpg", "average": "6", "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["Tim's Games"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic46448.jpg", "boardgameversion": ["Tim's First Edition"], "maxplaytime": "5", "boardgamecategory": ["Action / Dexterity", "Fantasy", "Fighting"], "age": "10", "minplaytime": "5", "description": "A unique game, Battle Chips contains 30 wooden chips divided into two armies (orcs versus barbarians).  Each army has (in descending order of strength) one leader, one wizard, three bowmen, four pikemen, and four warriors.  They also have two shield-bearers.  On the back of each chit is simply an orc face or a human face, which, if used in combat, is lower than a warrior.<br/><br/>On a given turn, each player secretly selects three units, keeping the remaining units face down in front of him.   The players take turns dropping them onto a cloth surface (tablecloth or towel on a table) from about a foot above the table (30 cm).  Whichever side they land face up is their strength for the current round.<br/><br/>Certain faces have different abilities, however:<br/><br/>     a human or orc face allows you to call for reinforcements (one additional chip from your unused chips) for each face showing),<br/>     a shield bearer allows you to protect one unit in the upcoming combat<br/>     a wizard may force a re-drop of all pieces except itself<br/>     a leader allows you re-drop any one chip (morale).<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>After all special abilities are used, line up your troops from strongest to weakest, and compare with your opponents.   The two strongest fight each other, with the loser removed from the game (remove both in case of ties).  Then the next two strongest fight, etc.  Shield bearers can be assigned to any chips.  A shielded chip attacks but may not be killed - remove the shield from the game, instead.<br/><br/>When one side loses its leader, the game is over and the other side is victorious.<br/><br/>While it sounds simple, your choices are actually not always easy.  If you risk your leader and it lands the wrong side up, it's the weakest piece on the board.  You can call for reinforcements, but units used in earlier combats cannot be called until all combats with the units that started that round have been completed.<br/><br/>For those who dislike the mechanic of dropping chips, you could use a die roll, coin flip, or card cut for each piece to determine its facing.<br/><br/>"}, "11317": {"boardgamedesigner": ["Connie Willis"], "poll": [], "name": "Chop Stix", "playingtime": "20", "minplayers": "1", "yearpublished": "2000", "usersrated": "22", "maxplayers": "0", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1552854_t.jpg", "average": "4", "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["TDC Games, Inc."], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1552854.jpg", "boardgameversion": ["TDC Games edition"], "maxplaytime": "20", "boardgamecategory": ["Action / Dexterity"], "age": "7", "minplaytime": "20", "description": "Test your skill with chopsticks by stacking 70 wooden logs as high you dare!<br/><br/>How high will your wooden pagoda soar before disaster<br/>befalls you?<br/><br/>Contains:<br/>70 poplar logs<br/>3 pairs of conventional chopsticks<br/>a scorepad<br/>a pencil<br/>One pair of ROOKIE STIX, the easy to use plastic chopsticks that allow anyone to play.<br/><br/>"}, "11318": {"boardgamedesigner": ["Thomas Hassan"], "poll": [], "name": "Showdown", "playingtime": "0", "minplayers": "2", "yearpublished": "1988", "usersrated": "5", "maxplayers": "4", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1875304_t.jpg", "average": "3.8", "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["AHA Spielezeitung", "Grendel Spiele"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1875304.jpg", "boardgameversion": ["Grendel Spiele German edition"], "maxplaytime": "0", "boardgamecategory": ["American West"], "age": "12", "minplaytime": "0", "description": "Four ranchers cast their eyes on the Stadt Dice City.

You have to cut out the 200 cards to create the game.  The rules take up half a single sheet of the cardstock.<br/><br/>Before beginning, shuffle the cards and then choose the size of the deck used in the game.  All 200 cards would make for a very long game and is not recommended except for masochists.  The shortest variant is simply to use the initial six cards dealt you and no more.  They also give estimated playing times for 50 and 100 cards.<br/><br/>Game play is reminiscent of Once Upon a Time.  There are no &quot;Happy Ever After&quot; cards, however: you choose a card from your initial hand to be your ending card.  The cards have phrases or single words on them, largely relevant to the individual genre.  On your turn, you play a single card, weave it into the story, and then draw a card from the draw pile.  Play then passes to the next player, who does the same.  Players may boo and heckle your input, in which case you have to do it over.  This game is definitely concerned more with the quality of story than competition.<br/><br/>In fact, victory conditions are very understated.  Once the draw deck is finished and you've played your last card, on your turn you may then play your ending card, provided you can work it into the story sufficiently well (without getting disdain from your fellow players).

Players alternately place two of their pieces on the board until all spaces except one are occupied. No captures are made during this deployment phase. The player who placed the last pieces then moves one piece one space orthogonally, attempting to take opponent's pieces by custodial capture (i.e. &quot;sandwiching&quot;). A piece on the central square - usually marked with a cross - is safe from capture. If a player cannot make a legal move, their opponent continues to play until an opening appears.

Unfortunately, that means you have to do all the bookkeeping on paper that the computer could do easily.  Most players will find it a bit tedious to constantly have to calculate and record population, crops, seed, food, weapons, etc.  However, we sometimes play it at a restaurant while waiting for the food to come - it's not a bad way to pass the time, really, when you don't have less portable games around.<br/><br/>The game consists of a rules/events booklet, three six-sided dice, and a pad of record sheets.  The game is set in a mythical Renaissance-era kingdom, with each player playing a separate village in that kingdom.  You can trade goods with each other each turn, but can only attack others when you roll a &quot;1&quot; for an event table.<br/><br/>To play, each player takes a record sheet (you may need more than one per person, depending on how long the game lasts) and a pencil.  Determine first player, and write down your starting village: 5 each of people, gold, land, food, and seed.  The seed can go into either the ground as crops or storage - you should have some of each for safety.<br/><br/>On a player's turn, she rolls the three dice.  The red die tells you which table to look under: Attacks, Catastrophes, Good Times, Mixed Events, All Players Involved, or More Mixed Events.  The green (or yellow in some sets) die is then the &quot;tens&quot; digit, and the white die the &quot;ones&quot; digit.  So a roll of 5, 4, 1 means you look at event #41 on table 5.  (That's a bad one, a plague, but it's bad for everybody ...)<br/><br/>Once a player has resolved an event, ALL players Harvest crops, make weapons, get people, eat food, barter with other players or the King, store food and seed, plant seed - record this on your sheet with a pencil.

Other components include paper with asteroids printed on it, pads of space ship and fighter records, and a 12-sided die. Players need to supply their own colored pens, a different color for each player.<br/><br/>The template makes this a nearly unique and very satisfying game. You can play on an empty sheet of paper or on the asteroid fields provided. It's a simple game of space ship combat between either two players or two teams.<br/><br/>You first design your spaceships, assigning shields, armor, weapons, fighter hangars, etc., to spaces in a circle with different levels. The core of the circle represents both the bridge and the power plant of the spaceship - you don't want it hit! The circles are divided into twelve sections, like a clock.<br/><br/>Once you all have ships, you draw a triangle for each base and take turns plotting movement. Movement is handled by the template: line the center of the template over your current position, with your previous position directly to the rear. The template is divided into arcs of distance. If you move eight arc lengths last turn, you will continue to move eight in a straight line - make a slight mark on the paper to note that. If you want to change course, you can either accelerate or decelerate, and/or turn left or right. Find the spot on the map you wish to move to - it has to be within the range shown on the template. For each arc of distance you vary, plus a sideways distance, you must burn fuel - check it off on your ship record.<br/><br/>Combat is also handled by the template, which shows ranges of the various weapons. Missiles are the most fun, as you can only use your hand to measure roughly, and must launch them at an angle and speed fairly close to what you want, but probably not exactly. A missile will travel two turns without change of direction or speed, then explode. It's possible to be hurt by your own missile blast ...<br/><br/>"}, "11379": {"boardgamedesigner": ["Jim Keifer"], "poll": [], "name": "Checkered Flag", "playingtime": "10", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": ["Roll / Spin and Move"], "yearpublished": "1987", "usersrated": "18", "boardgamefamily": ["Flipsiders", "Sports: Auto Racing"], "maxplayers": "2", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic101201_t.jpg", "average": "5.05556", "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["Milton Bradley"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic101201.jpg", "boardgameversion": ["Milton Bradley American Edition", "Milton Bradley English Flipsider Edition", "Milton Bradley English/French Edition"], "maxplaytime": "10", "boardgamecategory": ["Racing", "Travel"], "age": "7", "minplaytime": "10", "description": "This is a small game of auto racing: it folds into its own plastic case measuring 2.5&quot; x 4&quot; (6.5 cm x 10 cm).

Each player begins with a randomly dealt army of 11 units. Most will be creatures of one of the game's 6 types (Barbarians, Goblins, Elves, Trolls, Dwarves, Undead). A lucky player may also get Wizards (which protect creatures of one type from attack) or Catapults (one-use weapons that have a 50/50 chance of destroying a target card). Creatures come in three varieties (infantry, archers, cavalry).<br/><br/>Armies are placed face-up in front of the players, and three rounds of warfare ensue. At the start of each round, players receive additional cards, including the vital Attack Cards, without which an army can only stand on the defensive. Attack cards are of two types. One (&quot;Battle&quot;) allows all of a player's creatures of one type to attack creatures of either the same type or the type that the attacker most dislikes. Elves, for instance, may attack an opponent's Elves or his Trolls (the Elves' &quot;natural enemy&quot;.) The other type of Attack Card (&quot;Mercenary Army&quot;) allows creatures of different types to combine in an attack against creatures of any one type, but limits the number of attackers. Attack Cards also provide various bonuses to the attacker.<br/><br/>The resolution of attacks is modeled on Risk. The attacker rolls up to three dice, the defender up to two (the number depending on how many infantry each side has in the battle). The side with more archers, if either, adds one to its high die roll. The highest and second highest rolls for each side are compared, and the low roller in each loses a card (with the defender winning ties). The attack continues until one side is wiped out or the attacker voluntarily breaks off. Attackers with surviving cavalry can then make further attacks.<br/><br/>Players gain victory points for enemy units destroyed and for having the most creatures of a particular type at the end of the third round of play.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": ["Dutch version", "Face 2 Face English edition", "German Phalanx edition", "Italian First Edition"], "name": "Warriors", "playingtime": "30", "boardgamemechanic": ["Dice Rolling", "Set Collection", "Take That"], "age": "8", "boardgameexpansion": ["12199"], "usersrated": "553", "boardgamesubdomain": ["Wargames"], "average": "5.00781"}, "11416": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic46464.jpg", "poll": [], "boardgamedesigner": ["Steve Jackson (I)"], "statistics": [], "yearpublished": "2004", "maxplayers": "5", "boardgameartist": ["Greg Hyland", "Philip Reed"], "boardgamepublisher": ["Steve Jackson Games"], "maxplaytime": "90", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic46464_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "90", "boardgamecategory": ["Card Game"], "description": "Cleopatra.

Consistent rating systems and evaluations of the capabilities of modern naval vessels, aircraft, submarines, and helicopters make it possible to achieve realistic results when simulating known situations, by extension Harpoon 4 also achieves realistic results with hypothetical scenarios. Harpoon 4 can answer questions like:<br/><br/>Are carriers powerhouses or sitting ducks?<br/>Can transatlantic convoys survive in a modern wartime environment?<br/>In the cat-and-mouse games between US and Russian submarines, which is better?<br/><br/>Extensive examples in the rules book actually take you through mini engagements that span less than a page of text. The set of die-cut counters included in the game, along with the Quickstart rules, make it possible to take this game home and play a scenario in an evening.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": ["English first edition (1996)", "English second edition"], "average": "7.39583", "name": "Harpoon 4", "playingtime": "150", "boardgamemechanic": ["Dice Rolling", "Paper-and-Pencil"], "age": "12", "boardgameexpansion": ["26917", "39837", "39500", "39838", "42133", "9231", "11431", "11430", "107293", "18545"], "usersrated": "120", "boardgameaccessory": ["Dance of the Vampires"], "boardgamesubdomain": ["Wargames"], "boardgamefamily": ["Harpoon Series"]}, "11433": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic46364.jpg", "poll": [], "boardgamedesigner": ["Jack Radey"], "statistics": [], "yearpublished": "1997", "maxplayers": "2", "boardgameartist": ["Eric Radey", "Joe Youst"], "boardgamepublisher": ["Clash of Arms Games"], "maxplaytime": "180", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic46364_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "180", "boardgamecategory": ["Wargame", "World War II"], "description": "Operation Spark: The Relief of Leningrad 1943, is a simulation of the Soviet military offensive (Operation Iskra) during World War II, designed to break the German Wehrmacht's Siege of Leningrad. Planning for the operation began shortly after the failure of the Sinyavino Offensive. The German defeat in the Battle of Stalingrad in late 1942 had weakened the German front. By January 1943, Soviet forces were planning or conducting offensive operations across the entire German-Soviet front, especially in southern Russia, Iskra being the northern part of the wider Soviet 1942&ndash;1943 winter counter offensive<br/><br/>The city of Leningrad, second largest in the USSR, had been cut off by the Germans since September 8, 1941. Now, sixteen months later, the Soviets were about to make their third attempt to relieve the city. The first attack in January 1942 had led to the mauling of the 2nd Shock Army in the swamps to the south, and a second failure between Sinyavino and Mga in the summer of 1942 had also taken heavy casualties, although it had completely derailed von Manstein's planned assault on the city itself.

Soult's Army of the Pyrenees, outnumbered and outclassed by Wellington's veteran forces, fell back towards the east, defending a series of river lines. Wellington's troops, showing excellent coordination between their maneuvering wings, were able to turn Soult out of these strong defensive positions one by one, all the while driving toward the inland city of Toulouse.<br/><br/>On February 26, Wellington's lead elements were able to exploit a gap in the French cavalry screen and began crossing the Gave de Pau River unopposed, moving in the direction of Orthez. Soult chose not to fall back, and arrayed his six divisions in excellent defensive positions on the high ground north and west of the town. On February 27, he would be attacked by Wellington's eight divisions.<br/><br/>Orthez focuses on the infantry game, and as such serves as an excellent introduction to the system. Artillery plays a supporting role, and there are only a half dozen or so cavalry regiments per side. For the first time we see Wellington and the British on the attack. Command control plays a critical role, and highlights the differences between Wellington's veteran and well-established command hierarchy and Soult's more makeshift organization. British advantages include numerical superiority, command flexibility and their excellent infantry. The main French advantage is the terrific defensive terrain and the defense of interior lines. Make no mistake though, this is a very tough battle for the French.<br/><br/>In addition to the main battle scenario, there are several smaller scenarios that can be played to conclusion in a long evening. A variety of optional rules are included to provide replayability and variability for face to face or solitaire play.<br/><br/>La Bataille D'Orthez will feature two hand drawn maps of the battlefield by Rick Barber, as well as 420 state of the art counters and the usual assortment of charts and tables. The rules will be contained in a single book, and will be based on those included in La Bataille de Lutzen.<br/><br/>scale = 100 m/hex; <br/>time = 20 min/GT; <br/>strength = 50-100 men/SP (Regimental/Brigade Size)<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "1", "boardgameversion": ["First edition"], "average": "7.75281", "name": "La Bataille d'Orthez", "playingtime": "180", "boardgamemechanic": ["Hex-and-Counter"], "age": "12", "boardgameexpansion": ["157532", "16115"], "usersrated": "89", "boardgamesubdomain": ["Wargames"], "boardgamefamily": ["La Bataille series"]}, "11437": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic46359.jpg", "poll": [], "boardgamedesigner": ["Monte Mattson", "Ed Wimble"], "statistics": [], "yearpublished": "1999", "maxplayers": "3", "boardgameartist": ["Terry Leeds"], "boardgamepublisher": ["Clash of Arms Games"], "maxplaytime": "240", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic46359_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "240", "boardgamecategory": ["Napoleonic", "Wargame"], "boardgamehonor": ["1999 Charles S.

The Prussian and Russian armies attempt to ambush the French main army strung out in road march. Their approach goes undetected and they are able to close within two miles. In fact, not until the moment of their assault do the French become aware of them. But, instead of the expected weak flank guard, they are met by the strong divisions of Souham and Girard and by mid-afternoon, Napoleon and 100,000 French and their allies have swarmed to their support. The battle raged in ever-mounting fury until night finally brought an end to the slaughter. The first major battle of the 1813 campaign ends with thousands of dead and wounded and with the Russian and Prussian armies in full retreat.<br/><br/>La Bataille de Lutzen simulates the first major clash of Napoleons 1813 campaign. Lacking adequate cavalry and handicapped by a large number of raw recruits, the French player must rapidly consolidate his scattered forces to counter the sudden Allied attack. As the player commanding the Allied forces, you must deal the French a decisive blow before Napoleon can react and bring reinforcements to bear.<br/><br/>Lutzen is ideal for multiple players or solitaire study. Each turn represents 20 minutes of real time, and each hex equals 100 meters. The rules are the Lutzen version of the award winning system developed by the Marshall Enterprises Household and cover the full range of features characteristic of the Napoleonic battlefield.

To draw a board is easy.  First draw a 5 x 5 orthogonal grid.  The draw two diagonal lines - from each corner to the opposite corner.  Finally draw four diagonal lines in the form of a square that connects the midpoints of each side.<br/>Alquerque is played with 12 black pieces and 12 white pieces in a similar way to Draughts (Checkers).  <br/>The player playing black pieces places them on the 10 points of the nearest 2 rows plus the 2 rightmost points on the middle row as the player looks at it.  The other player sets the white pieces up in exactly the same way.  This leaves only the middle point without a piece upon it. The objective of the game is to take all of the opponent's pieces or to produce a position such that the opponent is unable to move.<br/><br/>Play<br/>Players take turns to move one of their pieces.  A piece may only move along the lines inscribed upon the board.  For each turn a piece makes either a capturing move or an ordinary move.<br/>Whenever a piece has an opponent's piece adjacent to it and the point immediately beyond the opponent's piece is vacant, the opponent's piece can be captured.  A piece is taken by simply hopping over it into the vacant point beyond and removing it from the board.  Unlike an ordinary move, a capturing move can consist of several such hops - if a piece takes an opponent's piece and the new position allows it to take another piece, then it can do so straight away.  The move finishes when the position of the capturing piece no longer allows it to taken any more pieces or the player could make another capture but decides not to.<br/><br/>An ordinary move is made by simply moving a piece along a line to an adjacent point.<br/>Finishing<br/>The game is won by the player who first manages to take all his opponent's pieces or by the player who has more pieces when it becomes apparent that no more pieces will be taken.   Alternatively, a player can win by rendering the other player unable to move. <br/>A draw occurs by agreement at any point during the game.  If it becomes apparent that no more pieces will be taken and both players have the same number of pieces left, a draw is agreed.  Draws are very common.<br/><br/>Arie van der Stoep's reconstruction:<br/><br/>In his book Draughts in relation to chess and alquerque (2005) Arie van der Stoep contends that Alquerque de doze was in medieval times played by the following rules. Counters can move and capture, by the short leap, forwards and sideways. Capture is not compulsory. Counters are promoted to Sultans at the last rank. The Sultan (King) moves and captures in all directions. Counters are obliged to follow the pattern on the board. Goal is to capture all the opponent's counters.<br/><br/>There existed two variants of Medieval Alquerque. In one version the Sultan can only move one square (short Sultan), and captures by the short leap. This was foremostly played in countries within the Roman sphere of influence. In the other variant the Sultan moves any number of squares, and captures like the King in international draughts, landing anywhere behind the captured piece. This was foremostly played in countries within the Arabic sphere of influence. In Sultan endgames, a majority of at least two Sultans is necessary for a win.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": ["Cyningstan first edition", "Dujardin French edition", "Falke edition", "Oficina do Aprendiz Edition", "Print and Play edition", "Ta\u015f Devr\u0131 Oyuncak Turkish edition"], "average": "5.74678", "name": "Alquerque", "playingtime": "20", "boardgamemechanic": ["Grid Movement"], "age": "8", "usersrated": "76", "boardgamesubdomain": ["Abstract Games"], "boardgamefamily": ["Alquerque", "Checkers", "Combinatorial", "Indian Type War Games", "Promotional Board Games"]}, "11465": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic258715.jpg", "poll": [], "boardgamedesigner": ["Jim Zoldak"], "statistics": [], "yearpublished": "1991", "maxplayers": "2", "boardgameartist": ["Joy Cohn", "Rodger B.
