Somewhere in the dusty archives of MI6 is the complete version of Bram Stoker&rsquo;s novel Dracula &mdash; the unredacted version. The full story revealed clear pointers to the sources and methods the Service used in Operation EDOM, an 1893 mission that sent a bold agent deep into the Balkans to awaken and then terminate a very dangerous asset indeed.<br/><br/>But the termination didn&rsquo;t take. In 1940, desperate to stop Hitler&rsquo;s march through Europe, the Service reactivated EDOM, and reanimated their Transylvanian asset. Once more, they found they had bitten off more than they could chew, and in the chaos of wartime Romania they put him to sleep. Or so they thought.<br/><br/>In 1977, MI6 discovered that they weren&rsquo;t the only players in this game. Their asset had left his own sleepers behind in Moscow and Romania &mdash; and in London &mdash; and inside MI6. The Service had to reopen EDOM, awaken Dracula again, to find his agents in their own ranks &mdash; or so they said. Perhaps that reawakening was the sleeper&rsquo;s doing, too. Perhaps the Count never slept, not as the Service thought.<br/><br/>In 2011, looking for a terror great enough to fight terror, MI6 once more reached for EDOM. Once more, Dracula reached back. That&rsquo;s how you found the EDOM case file: the Dracula Dossier.<br/><br/>Three Generations of Intel<br/><br/>The edition of Dracula you found is more than complete &mdash; it&rsquo;s annotated. MI6 analysts and EDOM field men kept notes in the margins of their priceless copies of Stoker&rsquo;s work, notes from 1940, from 1977, and from 2011. Notes collated into one master case file, a file that vanished in 2011. The file you found. This is the dossier you must decipher to find the secrets of EDOM, to reveal who betrayed the 1893 operation, to discover who in MI6 still serves Count Dracula today.<br/><br/>And then, you must follow those clues to end the story once and for all, to close EDOM forever. You must find, hunt, and kill Dracula, the king of the vampires.<br/><br/>Your Generation of Horror<br/><br/>The Dracula Dossier follows in the fully improvisational path of the award-winning Armitage Files campaign. Players follow up leads in the margins of Dracula Unredacted, chasing down the real characters from Stoker&rsquo;s novel, their descendants in the present, and the British agents caught in the backblast.<br/><br/>Combine these leads and notes with pre-prepared elements such as conspiracy nodes, eerie locations, and vampiric beasts. The dossier contains over 40 supporting characters in vampiric, heroic, or in-between versions. Different versions of the real Mina Harker, Abraham van Helsing, and the other stars of Stoker&rsquo;s novel &mdash; and their modern-day successors, descendants, and survivors &mdash; can drive the story in any direction the players look.<br/><br/>Players choose which leads to track, which scarlet trail to follow. The Director, using the clear step-by-step techniques in this book, improvises a suitably blood-soaked thriller in response to their choices. Clear advice to players and Directors on improvisation, with extensive examples and guidelines, helps you set the scene.

On this game board all coordinates are in units and chess pieces (zees) are used as game pieces. The first number in each coordinate is how far from the game board Origin (0000) in the X direction (right/left), the 2nd number is how far from 0000 in the Y direction (diagonally upward); the 3rd is how far in the Z direction (up/down); the 4th how far in the T direction (diagonally downward). Point 4204, for example, is 4 units in the X direction, 2 units in the Y direction, 0 units in the Z direction, and 4 units in the T direction (from 0000). There is every 4 digit combination of 0, 1, and 2 making an 81 coordinate grid (3^4 = 81). Other &ldquo;Noonka Boreds&rdquo; are 4&quot;, 6&rdquo; and 8&rdquo; sided Tesseracts where coordinates are 4 digit combinations of 0,2 &amp; 4, 0, 3 &amp; 6, and 1, 4 &amp; 8 respectively.<br/><br/>Zees are arranged on the grid of this game board to play variant forms of games such as Checkers, Chess, and Solitaire with up to 8 players; however the board is very versatile in that many games can be played with modifications and enough different styles of zees. Role playing games can be played in 3D space with 3 different time periods. There are enough zees with each basic game board to play 8 player 4D Checkers (or 4 player 4D Chess). JetEyes are caps placed onto the zees to indicate an increased status including moving forward and backwards rather than just forwards around the 4D grid board. A jetEyed Pawn is a King.<br/><br/>Games can take between 15 minutes and 3 hours depending on the game, number of players, and their experience levels.

Note: the game has an abstract feel to it that appeals more to the math-geek. The beauty in the board is that it helps you visualize four dimensional space-time. Think of the grid as a 3D cube on a time-line, with 3D cubes at T=0, T=2 (red cube), and T=4. There are also 3D cubes where Y=0, Y=2 (green cube) and Y=4, Z=0, Z=2 (blue cube) and Z=4, and X=0, X=2 (brown, light blue, or yellow cube on website and poster sized boards), and X=4. In fact, because there are midpoints on each of the cubes, there are also 96 smaller 3D cubes on this board.

Compare your 'game war' with the actual Civil War as described in the enclosed illustrated booklet prepared by the Editors of AMERICAN HERITAGE.&quot;<br/><br/>AMERICAN HERITAGE GAME OF THE CIVIL WAR is a light war game for two players or four players in teams. One player controls the North (blue pieces) and the other the South (grey pieces). Players win by eliminating all of their opponents pieces, or when one side surrenders.<br/><br/>On their turn, players use dice to move their infantry, cavalry, or artillery pieces. The total roll on two die determines the number of movement points. Infantry may move one square for each movement point, cavalry and artillery move two squares for each movement point. Movement across mountains and rivers costs extra. Units may use rail lines to move quickly across the board.<br/><br/>Battles are initiated when a player lines up two or more pieces into a continuous column that is connected to at least one opposing piece. The attack strength of the pieces in the column are calculated, and if the attacker has greater strength, the defending pieces are eliminated from the board. Initiating a battle requires one movement point.<br/><br/>"}, "175018": {"poll": [], "name": "Inside Trader: The Authentic Stock Trading Game", "videogamemode": ["Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["DOS 5 1/4\" Floppy edition"], "average": "3", "videogametheme": ["Business/Construction"], "usersrated": "1", "videogamedeveloper": ["Softserv, Inc."], "videogamegenre": ["Simulation"], "videogameplatform": ["DOS"], "statistics": [], "videogamepublisher": ["Cosmi Corporation"], "description": "User Summary<br/><br/>Early stock trading game that combines trades with illegal activity and SEC rules.<br/><br/>"}, "175019": {"poll": [], "name": "Corporate Raider: The Pirate of Wall St.", "videogamemode": ["Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["Corporate Raider"], "average": "4", "videogametheme": ["Business/Construction"], "usersrated": "1", "videogamedeveloper": ["Softserv, Inc."], "videogamegenre": ["Simulation"], "videogameplatform": ["DOS"], "statistics": [], "videogamepublisher": ["Cosmi Corporation"], "description": "User Summary<br/><br/>Sequel to Inside Trader. an early stock trading game that combined trades with illegal activity and SEC rules.<br/><br/>"}, "175020": {"image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2695012.jpg", "poll": [], "boardgamedesigner": ["Brian Train"], "statistics": [], "yearpublished": "2015", "maxplayers": "2", "boardgameartist": ["Joe Youst"], "boardgamepublisher": ["Decision Games (I)"], "maxplaytime": "180", "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2695012_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "90", "boardgamecategory": ["Korean War", "Wargame"], "description": "From the publisher's website:<br/><br/>Korean War Battles is an operational-level simulation of three engagements in 1950: the holding action at the Pusan Perimeter (August &ndash; September), the battle to retake Seoul (September), and the withdrawal from the area of the Chosin Reservoir (December).<br/><br/>The games all two-player, but are easily adaptable for solitaire.

A player can also auction for tamales that will give the player points and money.<br/><br/>Players will try to match the symbols in the ties of the lizards with the union cards to acquire them. Unions will give the players money to the lizards of th same ideology and bills that the cabinet must pass by spending coins and politicians.<br/><br/>Finally, players can send some of their politicians to the president board to do lobby. The player at the end of the game with more tie cards in the president board will gain points by a mayority mechanic.<br/><br/>In the game, player's will try to acquire Unions by bidding on the media (TV, Radio, Internet, Press), while trying to get &quot;tamales&quot; (a tipical Colombian food) to give to the people and buy votes. The Unions will ask for a set of political ideologies in the player's cabinet, so, the player will have to hire politicians of the proper ideologies to get their support. Finally, a leader can send his politicians to make lobby with the president, to earn more points at the end of the game.<br/><br/>Spanish description:<br/>Dise&ntilde;ado por David Laverde como s&aacute;tira a la forma que funciona la pol&iacute;tica, Lagartus Pol&iacute;ticus es un juego inteligente que pone a los jugadores en el papel de lagartos pol&iacute;ticos que intentar&aacute;n armar un gabinete pol&iacute;tico seg&uacute;n conveniencia para poder ganar el respaldo de distintos gremios (transporte, comunicaciones, etc).

Since then, his mummy has restlessly roamed the pyramid corridors, scaring away anyone who dares intrude. Courageous heroes are the only ones who can free the mummy of the curse. Only those who possess the precious scarabs and can creep through the dark tunnels past the scary mummy all the way to the burial chamber stand a chance of breaking the mummy curse. Whoever hurries through the maze without being careful will attract the furious mummy and quickly find themselves right back at the pyramid entrance. Many adventurers have already tried and failed miserably. Can you get rid of the mummy's curse?<br/><br/>Pharaoh's Gulo Gulo, a reimplementation of the 2003 game Gulo Gulo, challenges players to make their way through a desert, then through the Pharaoh's pyramid. Before the game begins, players lay out face-down tiles on the desert path, in the pyramid, and in the mummy's burial chamber. The mummy figure starts outside the burial chamber, and the players start at the beginning of the desert.<br/><br/>On a turn, a player first explores the tomb either by flipping over the closet tile that has not yet been revealed, or by choosing the color of a desert or pyramid tile that's been revealed. The player then digs for the color chosen or revealed on the tile in a wooden bowl. This bowl contains twenty &quot;boulders&quot; (wooden spheres) and a thin Pharaoh's staff that's placed standing up in the bowl. If the player successfully removes a boulder of the proper color without the Pharaoh's staff or another boulder falling out of the bowl, that player moves &mdash; either forward or backward &mdash; to the next space on the path of that color. If the player lands on a scarab space, they take a scarab token and place it in front of themself (with a maximum of four scarabs for a player).<br/><br/>If the player creates a landslide by dropping a boulder or causing the staff to fall and touch the table, that player must retreat to the starting desert space (if in the desert) or the pyramid entrance (if in the pyramid). (You refill the bowl with all the boulders should someone cause a landslide or when all the boulders of one color have been removed.)<br/><br/>If the player lands on a tile showing one or more mummy heads, the mummy advances that many spaces, moving again if it lands on a tile showing mummy heads. If the mummy passes a player or lands on the same space as one, that player must discard a scarab or retreat immediately to the pyramid entrance. The mummy roams back and forth from burial chamber to entrance, so you'll encounter it at least once!<br/><br/>A player must have at least two scarabs to enter the burial chamber, after which the player must complete two boulder grabs in a row based on the tiles in that chamber.

Fortunately for the Allies, the Dutch had disobeyed orders and posted a strengthened division at the crossroads. Wellington, the Allied commander, swiftly reacted and reinforcements were force-marched to aid the beleaguered Dutch. Ney also ordered reinforcements, but in his case the reinforcements were supposed to be helping Napoleon in his own battle with the Prussians at Ligny. In the end, Wellington's forces drove the French from the field, while Ney never got his reinforcements, which marched back and forth between Quatre Bras and Ligny affecting neither battle.<br/><br/>In this 2 player wargame, can you do better?<br/><br/>Each side controls around 10-20 units - these are infantry, cavalry, and artillery. The cavalry are further subdivided into 3 types: Heavy, Light, and Lancers. Each unit has a rating ranging from 2 to 4. When this is reduced below zero through combat hits, the unit is eliminated.<br/><br/>The scale is around 2000 men or 1000 cavalry per unit. Each game turn is half an hour. The map shows the environs of Quatre Bras, divided into areas. Between Areas are Approaches where infantry may deploy.<br/><br/>Each turn, a player receives a certain number of actions. These are spent manoeuvring the forces, including into combat, and rallying those with hits. Then both sides fire artillery, then the 2nd player does the same, and the turn is over.

The game length is exponentially long, so games with more players take more time to complete. The Protocol Series requires a deck of poker cards as well as tokens to track drama points.<br/><br/>"}, "175119": {"poll": [], "name": "Doomtown: Reloaded \u2013 Frontier Justice", "playingtime": "30", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": ["Area Control / Area Influence", "Betting/Wagering", "Deck / Pool Building", "Hand Management", "Variable Player Powers"], "yearpublished": "2015", "boardgameexpansion": ["Doomtown: Reloaded"], "usersrated": "57", "boardgamefamily": ["Admin: Better Description Needed!", "The Weird West (BGG Family)"], "maxplayers": "4", "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2453683_t.jpg", "average": "7.88596", "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["Alderac Entertainment Group (AEG)"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2453683.jpg", "boardgameversion": ["English first edition"], "maxplaytime": "30", "boardgamecategory": ["American West", "Card Game", "City Building", "Expansion for Base-game", "Fantasy", "Horror"], "age": "14", "minplaytime": "30", "description": "Doomtown: Reloaded &ndash; Frontier Justice is a saddlebag expansion for Doomtown: Reloaded.<br/><br/>"}, "175120": {"rpgartist": ["Gary Dupuis"], "rpg": ["Pathfinder System Compatible Product"], "poll": [], "name": "Enhanced Fey", "rpgdesigner": ["Julian Neale"], "rpgproducer": ["Perry Fehr", "Mark Gedak"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2456654.jpg", "usersrated": "0", "rpgitemversion": ["PDF version"], "average": "0", "statistics": [], "rpggenre": ["Fantasy (High Fantasy)"], "rpgpublisher": ["Purple Duck Games"], "rpgcategory": ["Sourcebook (rules/options to enhance play)"], "rpgseries": ["Monster Advancement"], "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2456654_t.jpg", "description": "From publisher blurb:<br/><br/>From the Pen of Julian Neale<br/><br/>When I think of fey creatures, I think they should be one or more of the following: wondrous, enigmatic, creepy, dangerous, or (sometimes) funny. They should make for great encounters, whether that involves combat or not. Compared to other types of intelligent creatures in the Bestiaries, there are surprisingly few of them, especially at higher Challenge Ratings. Disappointingly, many do not match the expected values for their CR. Fey are defined in the Pathfinder Roleplaying Game Bestiary as &ldquo;...a creature with supernatural abilities and connections to nature or to some other force or place. Fey are usually human-shaped.&rdquo; In other words, they do not have to be nature spirits, but they do (or should have) supernatural abilities. Potentially, they can be anything that can be imagined. There can even be lawful fey, and ones that have DR of a material other than cold iron.<br/><br/>As with Enhanced Undead, this book aims to give fey creatures a boost to make encounters more memorable and (hopefully) challenging. As a side note, it&rsquo;s important to realise that the descriptive elements (&ldquo;fluff&rdquo;) of the creatures in the Bestiaries can be changed if you want to use particular fey in a different way.<br/><br/>The book presents:<br/><br/>    The enhanced fey creature template<br/>    A brief discussion on applying it<br/>    And several stat blocks are provided with notes to demonstrate how the stat blocks match the CR.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>"}, "175121": {"image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2453921.jpg", "poll": [], "boardgamedesigner": ["Richard Brady", "Cory Jones"], "statistics": [], "yearpublished": "2015", "maxplayers": "2", "boardgamepublisher": ["Cryptozoic Entertainment"], "boardgameintegration": ["Adventure Time Card Wars: BMO vs. Lady Rainicorn", "Adventure Time Card Wars: Doubles Tournament", "Adventure Time Card Wars: Finn vs. Jake", "Adventure Time Card Wars: Fionna vs Cake", "Adventure Time Card Wars: Lemongrab vs. Gunter", "Adventure Time Card Wars: Princess Bubblegum vs. Lumpy Space Princess", "Adventure Time Card Wars: BMO vs. Lady Rainicorn", "Adventure Time Card Wars: Doubles Tournament", "Adventure Time Card Wars: Finn vs. Jake", "Adventure Time Card Wars: Fionna vs Cake", "Adventure Time Card Wars: Lemongrab vs. Gunter", "Adventure Time Card Wars: Princess Bubblegum vs. Lumpy Space Princess"], "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2453921_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "15", "boardgamecategory": ["Card Game", "Humor", "Movies / TV / Radio theme"], "description": "Note: The cardlist shows a card with the name Nightmare Fuel. The card was renamed Blood Transfusion, but the cardlist was not updated. You have the correct cards, though.<br/><br/>Game description from the publisher:<br/><br/>Adventure Time Card Wars is the most epic card game ever found in the Land of Ooo, or anywhere for that matter! In the Adventure Time episode &quot;Card Wars&quot;, Jake begs Finn to play his favorite trading card game. Finn accepts, despite warnings from Beemo on how very competitive Jake can be while playing the game. Finn and Jake battle against each other to decide who will be the Dweeb and who will be the Cool Guy.<br/><br/>Now fans can play the actual Card Wars game in Adventure Time Card Wars: Ice King vs. Marceline, with all of the action taking place in four combat lanes.<br/><br/>Each turn, a player has two Action Points to spend on Creatures, Spells, and Locations, and cards cost between 0 and 2 Action Points to play. When you summon a Creature, you choose which lane you want to place it in; some Creatures have FLOOP abilities that allow you to use their special abilities. When you attack with a Creature down a lane, you might find an opposing Creature, or you might get to deal your damage straight to your opponent's Hit Points. Reduce your opponent's Hit Points from 25 to 0 and you're the Cool Guy (and you win the game)!<br/><br/>In Adventure Time Card Wars: Ice King vs. Marceline, which contains all new cards other than a few rainbow card repeats, the Ice King and his IcyLands deck take on Marceline's dark and crafty Useless Swamps &amp; NiceLands deck. IcyLands creatures are all about attacking directly. They would prefer to avoid attacking other creatures. One way they can find some clear lanes to attack down is through frozen tokens. Through various means, these chilling tokens can be placed onto your opponent's Landscapes. Opponents will find playing creatures onto frozen landscapes rather difficult. Where the Ice King finds an opening, he will strike as hard as a blizzard!<br/><br/>Marceline's deck is a Useless Swamps &amp; NiceLands deck. This is the first time that NiceLands has been paired with another landscape type, and the chemistry is going to burn hot! The Useless Swamp side of the deck is themed around denial, discard, and dirty tricks. Some of the Useless Swamp Creatures are willing victims to your dark tidings. When they go, they leave a lot of destruction in their wake. The NiceLands side of the deck is themed around creatures with exactly five damage on them. This is a tweak to the NiceLands strategy as seen in the original NiceLands deck. There, the creatures thrived with various different amounts of damage on them. Now the trick is to get as many of your creatures as you can to have exactly five damage on them. When that happens, look out!<br/><br/>Each Card Wars starter set has a pair of different forty-card decks and is ready to play right out of the box.

The Wild West comprises the history, geography, people, lore, and cultural expression of life in the Western United States, most often referring to the period of the later half of the 19th century, between the American Civil War and the end of the century. After the 18th century and the push beyond the Appalachian Mountains, the term is generally applied to anywhere west of the Mississippi River in earlier periods and westward from the frontier strip toward the later part of the 19th century. More broadly, the period stretches from the early 19th century to the end of the Mexican Revolution in 1920.<br/><br/>As the Old West passed into history, facts became myths. Myths that still get told today and that are stuck in the imagination of people, when they tell stories about the Wild West.<br/><br/>Dead Man's Hand takes place in this mythological Wild West, where fierce bountyhunters roam the West to hunt down wanted robbers, robbers that blow the railways up to rob the travelling commoners, commoners that pick up their gun to defend their claims from baddies and beasts alike, where there are saloons in every town with piano players in the corner and a gambler at a table, that cheats from time to time and gets tared and feathered if he wins too much.<br/><br/>Players take on the roles of characters that are trying to make their living in one way or the other, while the game master, who will be reffered to as &bdquo;Sherrif&ldquo; in the following rules, directs them along a storyline he made up before.<br/><br/>The system is entirely diceless and uses pokercards as well as jetons instead.<br/><br/>So you'll need one deck with 54 cards (4 suits &agrave; 13 cards + 1 red joker + 1 black joker) and one deck without jokers.

It is an eminently useable design which has been adapted to many other roles, but ultimately is optimised for moving almost half its tonnage in cargo from one star system to another.<br/><br/>The Type-A is, more than anything else, cheap. Its sensor fit is basic and its flight controls are minimal. It does, however, have a large cargo area and reasonable passenger accommodation, and since these are the tools of its trade, not wasting tonnage or money on anything else can be considered a plus. As a result of its efficiency in the small-transport field, the Type-A is one of the commonest starships in charted Space. It is primarily used by small shipping firms (many of them single-vessel outfits) but is also operated by many governments as a mail ship or even a naval auxiliary. Numerous owner-operators (as distinct from small shipping companies) also find this design effective.<br/><br/>Referee's Aid 3: Type-A Free Trader provides an in-depth look at one of the most common ships in Known Space, along with the A2 Far Trader variant. It walks you through every aspect of the Free Trader, with all new 3D deck plans, and provides specific vessels to be used in encounters.<br/><br/>If you are looking to flesh out the ship many players start with, look no further.<br/><br/>"}, "175147": {"poll": [], "name": "Bards Against Humanity (fan expansion for Cards Against Humanity)", "playingtime": "30", "minplayers": "4", "boardgamemechanic": ["Hand Management", "Simultaneous Action Selection"], "yearpublished": "2014", "boardgameexpansion": ["Cards Against Humanity"], "usersrated": "3", "maxplayers": "30", "boardgamefamily": ["Celebrities: Shakespeare"], "average": "6", "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["(Self-Published)"], "boardgameversion": ["English first edition"], "maxplaytime": "30", "boardgamecategory": ["Card Game", "Fan Expansion", "Humor", "Party Game"], "age": "17", "minplaytime": "30", "description": "Do you like Cards Against Humanity, but keep playing the same cards over and over again?

While the last carriers, with only a few planes between them, drew off the massive US carrier strike force, a flotilla of Japanese battleships and cruisers descended on the American invasion fleet in Leyte Gulf. As the Japanese ships rounded the island of Samar, they ran into two task forces of US escort carriers.<br/><br/>Yamato Unleashed picks up the action at this point. The Japanese player must push through the carrier groups and get heavy ships off the edge of the map, where they will find the American transports.

Now, the great factions of the galaxy mobilize their fleets and race to establish a foothold. The reward for successful domination surpasses all other concerns, and the price for conquering this sector will be paid in lives.<br/><br/>Forbidden Stars challenges you and up to three other players to take command of a mighty fighting force: the Ultramarines chapter of Space Marines, the Eldar of Craftworld Iyanden, the Evil Sunz Ork clan, or the World Eaters Warband of the Chaos Space Marines. Each faction offers unique armies and play styles, but your goal remains the same &ndash; to claim the key objectives selected for your faction. These objective tokens are scattered throughout the Herakon Cluster, but your opponents are sure to defend your objectives against you. You need to build massive armies and command them in unending war to best your enemies and claim your objectives. The fight for the Herakon Cluster is brutal and bloody, and you will either stride triumphant over the bodies of your fallen foes, or they will do the same to you.<br/><br/>Gameplay:<br/><br/>Each round in Forbidden Stars is divided into three phases.  In the Planning Phase, players will take turns placing order tokens face down on the separate tiles (systems) that make up the game board.  The four types of order tokens that players may place during the Planning Phase correspond to four types of actions that players can resolve in the second phase of play, Operations.  In the Operations Phase, players can reveal a Dominate token to drain friendly planets of their important resources, a Strategize token to purchase cards that can upgrade their orders and combat abilities, a Deploy order that allows them to build cities, factories, bastions, and new mobile units, or an Advance order to move units and attack their enemies.  The last phase of each round is the Refresh Phase, where players profit from the planets they control, reveal event cards to move the impassable Warp Storms, and heal any units that were wounded in battle.<br/><br/>Because of the game's three-phase structure, strategy in Forbidden Stars is balanced between short-term bluffing and long-term tactical military action.  The game's setup also poses strategic opportunities.  Players start the game by taking turns assembling sections of the Herakon Cluster, placing individual system tiles along with their own starting forces and the enemy objectives that they must defend.  This intentional construction, along with the unique Domination abilities of the game's four factions, means that Forbidden Stars will see players working to best utilize their own force's strengths while exploiting the weaknesses of their opponents.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": ["English first edition", "French first edition", "German first edition", "Italian first edition", "Polish first edition", "Spanish first edition"], "average": "8.07023", "name": "Forbidden Stars", "playingtime": "180", "boardgamemechanic": ["Area Control / Area Influence", "Dice Rolling", "Hand Management", "Modular Board", "Variable Player Powers"], "age": "14", "usersrated": "3657", "boardgamesubdomain": ["Strategy Games"], "boardgamefamily": ["Components: Miniatures", "Fantasy Flight Big Box", "Warhammer 40,000 Board Games"], "boardgamepodcastepisode": ["BGA Ep 85 - Best Games for Female Representation", "Boardcast News 4.16.15 | Podcast of Nonsensical Gamers", "Boardcast News 4.3.2015 | Podcast of Nonsensical Gamers", "Ep 35 2015 &amp; Beyond", "Ep 4 - Asymmetrical Games", "Ep 40 Finite Plays", "Ep. 13 Post Gencon", "Ep. 13.5 Board Game Blitz", "Episide 17: Bonsai!", "Episode 10: Specter Ops, Starship Troopers, and Agricola", "Episode 15 - Why We Game", "Episode 16 - Calvin Wong And Forbidden Stars Review", "Episode 16: Kings of Air and Steam, Tremors, and Loots and Legends", "Episode 25:  Clash of Cultures Review - Top 10s with Jamie Keagy of The Secret Cabal", "Episode 9 - A Look at the Designs of Scott Almes", "Episode 95- RobbCon 2017", "Epside 35 :: The Others + On The Couch with Josh and Brandon", "ET104: Episodio VII: El Despertar de los Sans-culottes", "Favorite Games of 2015", "Pap under juletr\u00e6et", "Podcast #30: An Opera of Toys", "RDTN Episode 71 \u2013 Still the One: Stockpile Review, Forbidden Stars Impression, Chit Chat: Game to Settle Down With", "RDTN Episode 73 \u2013 Top of the World: Gen Con Overview with Marty and Vanessa, Forbidden Stars Review, and A Contest", "Strange Assembly 182 - Jay and the Hologram", "The Game Pit - Episode 56 - The Bumper Review of 2015 (with Top 5s)", "The Good the Board and the Nuts and Bolts: Episode 10", "Vox Republica 096: Big Box, Big Problems", "What Did You Play This Week Podcast Thing Week 44!!!

Nearly all of its land mass is occupied and controlled by the Empire of Heaven (Tengoku no Teikoku), a land of oriental character. Three additional areas on the continent are worth noting. The first is a foothill region backed by mountains to the coast occupied by savage hill tribes, known as Ryuu no Ashi Yubi. The region is not of particular interest to the Empire and efforts to subdue it have failed due to the defensible nature of the terrain and the fierceness of the &quot;Crazy Flints.&quot; The tribesmen are of different racial stock than the Empire soldiers being larger, stockier and stronger. They mostly resemble the peoples of Ropa (Iryou Hin), but are generally darker and more hirsute. A few gnomes (bogi) also live free in this region. The second is an area underneath a portion of the Idai na Nanji Sabaku (Desert of Despair) which houses a small gnomish nation of &quot;freedom fighters,&quot; the Jiyuu no Shakai or &ldquo;Society of the Free.&rdquo; They work mostly to destabilize the Empire. They have been at it for centuries and have yet to be discovered. They constitute only a minuscule portion of the total gnome population of Ersa, but have never given up hope. The third is The Dragon Teeth (Doragon no Ha), a mountain range which is considered cursed by the Empire and home to the Eldritch Hobbits or Dracolings (Doragon no Hitobito), the dragonmasters of Ert. This small, long-lived population has a symbiotic relationship with the crystal dragons, a species unique to Ert.<br/><br/>The Empire of Heaven is the oldest of Ert's human civilizations still extant. The current emperor is 159th in his line, unbroken since the Empire was founded. Empire territory occupies most of the Ersa continent. Succession is controlled by the priest sect, but the heir is always a direct descendent of the Emperor. This is guaranteed by the practice of royal polygamy. This practice is restricted to the Emperor and daimy\u014d, though other nobles commonly kept y\u016bjo (courtesans) and in certain circumstances their offspring could inherit.  The Empire is not a theocracy. Though priests control the succession and the Emperor is considered holy, they wield no other organized power.  At an earlier date, when the Emperor had more bureaucratic power, sixty provinces were established, each governed by a kokushi. After a time, the power in the provincial system was supplanted by militarily powerful lords. The Abijana Shogunate established the han system, the granting of fiefs to loyal samurai.  A daimy\u014d rules each han. Size was important, the most powerful daimy\u014d controlling several thousand koku (about 150 kilograms of rice production). The smallest han is 10,000 koku, so a sizeable han might span two or more provinces. The daimy\u014d are split into several political parties and the Emperor will charge one daimy\u014d, the seii taish\u014dgun, to organize a government. Coalitions are formed and political intrigue is constant. The daimy\u014d very rarely attend court, including the seii taish\u014dgun, instead sending professional politicians, known as the shikken, to attend to their matters of state. So, the office of seii taish\u014dgun is usually administered by a professional politician.<br/><br/>"}, "175170": {"rpgartist": ["Thomas Fayen", "Wikimedia Commons"], "rpgitemversion": ["PDF version"], "statistics": [], "name": "Pasha: The Satraps of Wonder", "rpgdesigner": ["Steve Willett"], "rpgproducer": ["Steve Willett"], "average": "0", "usersrated": "0", "rpg": ["Generic / Universal"], "rpgpublisher": ["Polyhedron Games LLC"], "rpgcategory": ["Campaign Setting (game world)"], "poll": [], "rpggenre": ["Culture (Asian / Far Eastern)", "Fantasy (High Fantasy)"], "description": "From publisher blurb:<br/><br/>Pasha is an old country founded soon after the rise of Ersa.

It differs to a greater or lesser degree depending upon the language, culture or race of the teller. Paxian and Venician are spoken almost universally on the continent of Ropa. The only cultures that deviate on Ropa from the Paxian myth are the Eddans and Kraeldonians. Different deities are paramount in Prissia and Venicia, but the myth is essentially the same. Dwarves and gnomes share the Stone Father myth, halflings generally accept the &quot;three fruit&quot; myth and elves have none, at least as it concerns Ert. Interestingly, some aspects of the Paxian myth must be true and entered the racial consciousness of all civilized peoples, for none worship a sun god or moon god, though these practices may still be found in animistic societies.<br/><br/>The Eddans trace their origins back to Jalkarnatur positing that the universe and gods always were that only life has a beginning and end. Jalkarnatur, seeing that many of the races raped and ravished the lands they occupied, created the Cai de Oameni (Horse People) and gave them cai (horses) as family. The Eddan culture is centuries old and has remained essentially unchanged in that time.<br/><br/>The Kraeldonians, unique among human cultures, acknowledge the Stone Father, though they call him Clan Giver and are unaware that this knowledge comes from the dwarves. They otherwise adhere to the Paxian myth.<br/><br/>Demi-humans, with the exception of elves, generally worship the same deities as humans, but with different names. The elves worship a different pantheon but also give homage to Jalkarnatur and Amarcerddoriaeth under other names. For instance, the elves name for Jalkarnatur is Gallenature and for Amarcerddoriaeth, Nithrevel. The dwarves worship Thrasteinenvater (Stone Father) Groderde (Tavalddaear), Daschmiede (Thundefail), Ormfeuer (Kasalt\u0101n), Hraherd (Saranaelwyd) and Thundarkrieger (Valkarhyfel). The gnomes pay homage to Haldhaard (Saranaelwyd), Adronheil (Szuldrwg) and Serlnatuur (Jalkarnatur). Halflings worship Wythorth&uacute;lacht (Ravangroth) and Gam-dea (Kael-da). A complete listing of names for the gods is at the end of this section.<br/><br/>The elven pantheon consists of Danu, the Faerie Mother, An Fir Lea (goddess of storms and the seas), Manannan Mac Lir, Se&aacute;n na Gealaige (god of wetlands), Tein Stocke (god of music), Phouk-a (god of mountains), Skeaghshee (god of forests), Anann (goddess of livestock and fertility), Babd Catha (goddess of war), B&eacute; Chuille (goddess of magic), Aed (god of death), &Oacute;engus (god of love and poetry), Dian C&eacute;cht (god of healing).<br/><br/>The savages in the Jungle of Malaise are animists, so therefore worship the things of nature. They do not have priests, but rely on their shamans for spiritual guidance. The barbarians in the Wild Lands follow the same pattern. And though the societies in Merka and Frieka are primitive and practice animism to varying degree, they have defined patterns of worship.<br/><br/>In Merka, the degree of civilization increases as one travels south. The Inut worship gods of the hunt and gods of the sea. The Braskans worship a variety of deities connected with their survival, individually and as a people. The southern Braskans practice a sun cult and human sacrifice.<br/><br/>In Frieka, the Banians practice a Cthulhuesque religion that is horrible to even contemplate. The Pimis and Swilis practice a hodgepodge of animism and voodoo.

Gain Followers by sending Disciples on Mission Trips. Have a Preach-Off to take out an enemy. Defend against enemy Disciples with Agnostics. Beef up, slow down, or mess with the guys in play using Blessings, Curses, and Miracles. Baby Jesus, the scorekeeper, also has super powers.<br/><br/>How to Play:<br/><br/>All cards that you play or actions that you take happen on your own turn, in any order that you like.<br/><br/>Communion Wafers are the currency for this game. The number on the top left of a card is how many wafers it costs to play. On the first turn you can only spend one wafer. The second turn you have two to spend. By the time the third turn comes around&hellip; You guessed it! 3 wafers! And so on. Spend them wisely and you will dominate. As the game goes on, things get very exciting because you are able to play more powerful cards. If you lose track of how many wafers you have available: Smoke less weed or keep track with dice. Your choice but the author prefers the latter.<br/><br/>Each player starts with their Baby Jesus to the right of their deck, to help keep score. Slide a paper clip around Baby Jesus and when you get to 42 Followers, you become the winner, but more importantly - they become the loser. Baby Jesus' Super Powers help keep the game moving and are great for using up excess wafers. Only one Relic may be played on Baby Jesus at a time and may be used to damage an enemy once per turn. When it has been exhausted, it is sent to hell, a warm cozy place to the left of your deck.<br/><br/>Besides Baby Jesus and his Relics, there are two main types of cards:<br/><br/>1) Character cards<br/><br/>Characters have Attack and Defense. This is how they compete with each other. If their Defense reaches zero, they are sent straight to hell. During a Mission Trip, Followers are gained equal to the Disciple&rsquo;s Attack number.<br/><br/>Agnostics - Defenders who keep your opponent from gathering Followers. If your enemy has an Agnostic in play, you must send it to hell before your Disciples can go on a Mission Trip or have a Preach-Off against a non-Agnostic.<br/>Disciples - Offenders who may either be sent on a Mission Trip or have a Preach-Off once per turn. Without gaining Followers, you cannot win so it usually makes more sense to go on a Mission Trip. If you do elect to have a Preach-Off this is how it works: You choose the character you would like to Preach off against (remember, Agnostics must be targeted first). Defense points are deducted from both characters equal to the attack points of the opposing character. This happens at the same time. So, if a 1/5 (1 Attack, 5 Defense) dude attacks a 2/1 enemy, the enemy will perish and your Disciple is now a 1/3 [mark damage taken with pennies]. Moreover, it might be a smart move to sacrifice a 1/1 against an 8/1 to take him out of commision.<br/><br/>2) Manipulation cards<br/><br/>Unless otherwise stated, Blessings and Curses affect only one character. These cards may stay in play to help keep track of who they have an effect on. Whenever they become irrelevant, feel free to toss them into the fiery pit.<br/><br/>Blessings - Turn your dudes into badasses.  <br/>Curses - Mess with your enemies.  <br/>Miracles - Save these for when you could really use one.<br/><br/>Now let's begin:<br/><br/>The game starts with each player shuffling their own deck and drawing 4 cards. Good cards to start with cost 1 or 2 wafers; you will be able to use them sooner. If you aren't happy with your hand, you may shuffle the cards you don't like back into the deck and replace them. You may do this twice. If you still don't like your hand, too bad. You'll draw a new card every turn so don't make a big fuss about it. Now flip a coin. The winner chooses to either go first (starting with just the 4 cards they have) or draw first.<br/><br/>Alternative 4 player version (2-Headed-Jesus): Each team helps one Baby Jesus attract 84 followers. Each player has their own deck. Make your moves at the same time as your teammate. Help each other out. You may look at each other&rsquo;s hands to help strategize.<br/><br/>Remember to have fun. Because if you're not having fun... What's the point?<br/><br/>"}, "175195": {"rpgartist": ["Ed Bourelle", "Carlos Cabrera", "Matt Ferbrache", "Laine Garrett", "Nicholas Kay", "Nestor Ossandon", "Miroslav Petrov", "Andrea Uderzo", "Mike Vaillancourt"], "rpg": ["Iron Kingdoms Full Metal Fantasy Roleplaying Game"], "poll": [], "name": "An Introduction to Savagery", "rpgdesigner": ["Matthew Goetz", "Will Schoonover", "Jason Soles", "Matt Wilson"], "rpgproducer": ["Richard Anderson", "Ed Bourelle", "Michele Carter", "Bryan Cutler", "Shona Fahland", "Matt Ferbrache", "Laine Garrett", "Matthew Goetz", "Dan Henderson", "Darla Kennerud", "Josh Manderville", "Michael G.

But after five hours, security guards are slain and the ship&rsquo;s AI starts sealing storage bay rooms where it detects living alien bio signatures. But these security measures aren&rsquo;t enough to stop it from moving around the facility. The Player Characters play the mercenary group and have to find a way to kill the alien before it kills everyone on the ship including them. Since it can regenerate with even a single cell alive, they&rsquo;ll need to find a way to completely destroy every cell or try and lure it out an airlock.<br/><br/>"}, "175228": {"rpgdesigner": ["Zigmund Kawakami"], "rpg": ["Pathfinder System Compatible Product"], "poll": [], "name": "March 2015 Free Monster of the Month: Colossal Sorcerous Skull", "rpgartist": ["Zigmund Kawakami"], "rpgproducer": ["Zigmund Kawakami"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2457964.jpg", "usersrated": "0", "rpgitemversion": ["PDF version"], "average": "0", "statistics": [], "rpggenre": ["Fantasy (High Fantasy)"], "rpgpublisher": ["Octopus Apocalypse"], "rpgcategory": ["Sourcebook (rules/options to enhance play)"], "rpgseries": ["Dungeonous Octopus", "Free Monster of the Month"], "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2457964_t.jpg", "description": "From publisher blurb:<br/><br/>Presenting the Colossal Sorcerous Skull an all-new free CR 13 monster for the Pathfinder Roleplaying Game.<br/><br/>&quot;A colossal sorcerous skull is the skull of a colossal creature&mdash;usually a titan or dragon&mdash;who sought immortality through undeath but lacked the power to convert their massive body, or simply wished to free themselves of its cumbersome bulk...&quot;<br/><br/>"}, "175229": {"rpgdesigner": ["Jean Balczesak", "Denis Beck", "Jean-Marc Danisewsky", "Andr\u00e9 D\u00e9ho-Neves", "Patrick Durand-Peyroles", "Andr\u00e9 Foussat", "Denis Gerfaud", "Didier Guiserix", "Gr\u00e9goire Laakmann", "Tristan Lhomme", "Jean-Marie No\u00ebl", "Agn\u00e8s Pernelle", "Cyril Rayer", "Pierre Rosenthal", "Frank Stora", "Anne Vetillard"], "statistics": [], "name": "Casus Belli (v2, Special Issue 1 - Dec 2000)", "rpgartist": ["Rolland Barth\u00e9l\u00e9my", "Patrick Durand-Peyroles", "Olivier Frot", "Nicolas Fructus", "Didier Guiserix", "Thierry S\u00e9gur"], "rpgproducer": ["Cyrille Daujean", "Didier Guiserix", "Agn\u00e8s Pernelle", "Pierre Rosenthal"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2456690.jpg", "usersrated": "0", "average": "0", "rpgissue": ["Casus Belli"], "rpg": ["d20 System / OGL Product (D&D 3.0 Compatible)"], "rpgpublisher": ["Arkana Press"], "rpgissueversion": ["Softcover Version"], "poll": [], "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2456690_t.jpg", "description": "(translate) from the cover:<br/><br/>Laelith.

Instantly, the room was awash in green hues. He could easily make out the rows of tables covered in white table cloths and toped with a single white rose. On stage, he saw the white grand piano that was the club's trademark. Hanging above it, he could clearly see the body of a woman in a long dress.<br/><br/>A voice boomed. &quot;Ms. Mason sends her regrets. She is tied up at the moment. She hopes that you were join her later.&quot; The statement was punctuated by hideous laughter. Immediately, figures began to appear at the front and rear of the building.<br/><br/>Where do you go when the action starts? To the battle map, of course!

At the southern end of the building is the main entrance, bar area and a set of bathrooms. The main seating area, consisting of two and four person tables, is slightly recessed. At the northern end of the building is a small stage, dressing room and office. Direct access to these areas are availble through a service door to the right side of the stage.<br/><br/>Don't need a jazz club, no problem.

Are you strong, brave, and smart enough for the challenge? We will see how you fair against the great beasts of Hellas and the heroes and heroines who support your rival deity. This is the Heavenly Contest. This is Mythos!<br/><br/>In Mythos, you assume the role of a demigod or devoted human of the gods and goddesses of Olympus in a heroic mythological representation of Ancient Greece. Heroes and heroines join in the Heavenly Contest to prove their worth to the deities and spread the word of their patron deity to the mortals of Hellas, in hopes of raising their patron deity to the Olympus throne. Heroes and heroines come from all walks of life, representing their patron deity as adventurers, fighters, hoplites, Olympic athletes, courtesans, sages, and rogues. Through affiliations with deific cults and Mystery Cults, they gain access to great powers and follow the strands of Fate as they travel Hellas in search of their next, grand performance.<br/><br/>Inside the Hero's Handbook you will find:<br/><br/>    An introduction to mythological Ancient Greece and the Heavenly Contest<br/>    The demigod Background<br/>    Divine Qualities<br/>    Mystery Cults Talents<br/>    A collection of patron deities from Greek Mythology<br/>    Everything a player needs to create characters in Mythos.<br/>    &hellip; and more!<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>"}, "175351": {"rpgartist": ["Dio Mahesa"], "rpg": ["Pathfinder System Compatible Product"], "poll": [], "name": "Treasury of the Kingdom (Pathfinder)", "rpgdesigner": ["Linda Zayas-Palmer"], "rpgproducer": ["Rick Hershey", "Jason Nelson"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2462054.jpg", "usersrated": "0", "rpgitemversion": ["PDF version"], "average": "0", "statistics": [], "rpggenre": ["Fantasy (High Fantasy)"], "rpgpublisher": ["Legendary Games"], "rpgcategory": ["Sourcebook (rules/options to enhance play)"], "rpgseries": ["Kingdom-Building Adventure Path Plug-Ins"], "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2462054_t.jpg", "description": "From publisher blurb:<br/><br/>Treasury of the Kingdom brings you a bevy of magical items perfect for the freeholder lords of a newborn kingdom hacked out of the wilderness.

He may then purchase up to two upgrades (which are called &quot;reserved tables,&quot; &quot;group reservations,&quot; etc.) either immediately or on a later turn.

Parking Lot spaces cause loss of a turn, and various other spaces may increase or decrease the player's money total.  Passing the start space, unlike in Monopoly, costs the player $600.<br/><br/>Players start with $6000 each (tracked on paper--no paper money is included) and try to gain funds as they play.  Landing on other players' spaces forces a player to pay them a designated amount.  If a player cannot pay, he or she may sell any assets owned to other players or give them back to the bank for half value.  If still unable to pay in full, the player is out of the game.  The game can be played to one of three pre-agreed ending conditions--a time limit, until one or more player are eliminated or until only player is left.

The players will harness mighty abilities and powerful equipment while they work as a team to rid the world of this wretched evil!<br/><br/>Each round starts with the Foe, who is autonomous. The Foe has a set action it takes each turn, and then plays cards from its deck. The cards in the Foe deck include Vassals under its employ that also fight the Heroes, as well as powerful abilities that the Foe will use to damage and weaken the Heroes. At the end of the Foe phase, the party of Heroes may collectively choose a card in the city to refresh, making other options available for the next turn.<br/><br/>After the Foe phase is complete, the party of Heroes begin their turns. Turn order starts with whoever the party selects.

This allows you to get answers for problems when you need them.<br/><br/>The deck building element in Foe Hunters revolves around the City Deck.

Each player forms an army of monsters to compete with other players in phases such as Produce, Summon, Move, Battle, and Conquer; each monster has its own unique skill, allowing you to devise clever strategies by combining it with other skills or tactic cards. Players must manage their resources, action points and five mana elements: water, fire, air, earth, and ether. Using these resources effectively is the key to victory. Players must also use field effects, elemental superiority, unit type differences (infantry/archer/cavalry/flyer), joint attacks, and joint defense to their advantage.<br/><br/>The game offers several victory conditions, so each player can take strategic approaches to different victories based on how the game plays out.

Some cards are worth more than others though, so be strategic about which cards you decide to &ldquo;Swipe&rdquo; from your foes!<br/><br/>The game is played in rounds, and in one single round only four &quot;Master Points&quot; are available for players to win, either splitting the points between the players, or one player winning them all. Rounds continue until a single player reaches five Master Points, in which they win the game. The four Master Points in any given round consist of the following: 1) Master Number Point 2) Master Color Point 3) Master Shape Point and 4) Master Total Point.<br/><br/>The game starts out with the dealer revealing the &quot;Master Card&quot; for that round (which is a Power Card that gets placed in the center of the playing field). The Master Card will have a number (1-10), a color (red,blue,purple,green), and a shape (X,O). Whatever the elements might be are what dictate the four ways to earn the &quot;Master Points&quot; in that round. For example: If the dealer reveals the Master Card that has the number 7, the color red, and the shape X, then players must steal cards from each other that have any of those elements (7s, reds, X's) and always high numbered cards. At the end of a round, players will reveal to each other all of the cards they have acquired throughout the round. In this example, the player who acquired the most cards with the number 7 wins the Master Number Point, the player who acquired the most cards with the color red wins the Master Color Point, the player who acquired the most cards with the shape X wins the Master Shape Point, and the player who acquired the highest sum after adding up the numbers on all acquired cards wins the Master Total Point.<br/><br/>There are only two main types of cards in Swipe it!&trade; There are the Power Cards (cards with a number, a color, and a shape; one of these cards gets promoted to master card at the beginning of the round) and then there are the Swipe Cards which have an &quot;S&quot; and a swipe arrow . Players need to combine one of each type of cards in order to initiate an attack against another player. Players can only acquire Power Cards from each other in order to gain points, where Swipe Cards simply allow the player's Power Cards to make an attack. In Swipe it!&trade; a combined pair (a Power Card combined with a Swipe Card) can always freely attack a lower numbered Power Card or enemy pair. Example: a 10 on a Black Swipe Card can freely attack an opponent's 9 on a Black Swipe Card). Now the intensity rises when you are using a combined pair to attack a higher numbered Power Card or enemy pair. This is where the dice and rock-paper-scissors comes into effect, where essentially the attacker is wagering their lower numbered Power Card in a series of battles against their opponent's higher numbered Power Card. If the attacker loses, their opponent acquires the attacker's Power Card in play. This is especially huge when the attacker is risking their Power Card that happens to match the &quot;Master Number&quot;, &quot;Master Color&quot;, &quot;Master Shape&quot;, or is a high numbered card like a 9 or 10. On the other hand, if the attacker is wagering a Power Card that is low like the number 1 and does not match any of the Master Point categories, then who cares if they lose to their enemy right? The attacker may as well take the risk with that type of card in order try and win a great one.<br/><br/>There are also three different types of Swipe Cards (Black, Silver, and Gold) each one offering unique abilities; such as the Gold Swipe Card raising your Power card by +2 when it is attacking and by +1 when on defense, or the Silver Swipe Card granting the ability to &quot;Punish&quot; another player's Swipe Card, or being able to &quot;Reassign&quot; a combined pair with a different Power card (if you had a 1 combined with Silver Swipe Card, you can switch it to lets say a 10 on the Silver Swipe Card allowing you to attack higher numbered enemy cards for free). There are also some special rules too, such as &quot;merge&quot;, &quot;master merge&quot;, and &quot;cash-in&quot; which can help players out of some sticky situations. A &quot;merge&quot; allows you to combine two Power Cards that share the same number (such as combining a 9 with another 9), forcing the combined cards to act as if it were a Black Swipe card, giving you the ability to combine a third Power Card to it to make an attack. &quot;Master merge&quot; is the same as a &quot;merge&quot; with the exception that the combined cards match the &quot;Master Number&quot; in play, forcing them to act as if it were a Gold Swipe Card. Lastly, the &quot;cash-in&quot; action allows a player to discard two alike Swipe Cards (such as discarding two Black Swipe Cards) to receive one new card from the dealer. This action can only be done once per turn, so if you were hoping for a particular card, you will not be able to cash in another pair of Swipe Cards until the dealer makes its way around to you again.<br/><br/>The round ends once the dealer has dealt the last card, and the player dealt the last card takes their final turn. All players discard any remaining face up cards. They then flip over all acquired face down cards and determine the winners of the 4 Master Points for the round in this order; Master Number, Master Color, Master Shape, Master Total.<br/><br/>"}, "175488": {"image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2463029.png", "poll": [], "boardgamedesigner": ["Taylor Walker", "Lawrence Walker"], "statistics": [], "yearpublished": "2015", "maxplayers": "6", "age": "16", "boardgamepublisher": ["L.T.

Earth Encounters is anti-trivia.<br/><br/>The game starts with the Timeship Encounter. An alien creature escaped the timeship and is hiding somewhere in the Eastern Time Zone. Encounter launches an elite team to recapture the alien creature. Players travel across the U.S. and the seven continents, competing to be the first to locate and capture the powerful yet invisible alien before it awakens and consumes all the knowledge possessed by Earth&rsquo;s inhabitants. Throughout this adventure, each player learns about the states and continents as they collect as many states and continent deeds as possible &ndash; they&rsquo;ll be needed when you come face-to-face with the alien creature.<br/><br/>Each player can only advance by correctly answering a question from the Q&amp;A Deck or successfully completing a thought experiment from the Challenge Deck.   In doing so, if they are the first to land on that particular state or continent, they are awarded a State Deed of Trust.
