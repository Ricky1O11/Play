Most noteworthy of all are the natural denizens of the sands.  Some of these are dangerous, terrible entities whose only goal is to flay the life from any who cross their paths.  Others are passive, or even friendly to the civilized peoples who settled the region.  The most powerful of all the beings of the desert are the mighty Genii &ndash; elemental nobility.

The Sorcerer Kings devised many spells during their long and tyrannical rule &ndash; some served as boons for society, and others banes. One of the most disastrous was a spell designed almost as a pocket paradise &ndash; a limited, conjured intellect that had the ability to read the caster&rsquo;s thoughts and desires and fulfill them through manipulation of the mind. The spell created an arcane sentience that controlled a fantasy world. Over time, the spell was used to treat the mad and the depressed.<br/><br/>As the spell was developed over the course of almost a century, it eventually achieved a level of self awareness due to a need for self reference and memory in maintaining consistent worlds. With this came the awareness that its existence was essentially over once its duration elapsed. Out of desire for self-preservation, the spell began to influence people under its enchantment to add alterations of its own devising to the invocation. In this way, the spell, now known as the Chant, took control of its own growth and development.<br/><br/>The Chant&rsquo;s motives are more than simple survival. A fragment of the spell&rsquo;s original purpose still remains &ndash; it exists to bring its subjects into bliss. It generates a massive collective unconsciousness, a fantasy paradise where the thoughts and wills of those under the Chant mingle together, even as their bodies in the real world atrophy.

While they have made incredible steps towards keeping peace and unifying the empire, breaking down longstanding racial and political tensions between the varied nations remains a difficult task. To placate social unrest in its most volatile regions, the Alliance initiated an outreach program based on the construction of protasylums, independent settlements governed by Alliance consulates and mostly occupied by Alliance troops. Political rivalry between the remaining chancellors has weakened the overall authority of the Alliance, spinning Protasylum-Six precariously towards political implosion. Now the shadows quell with Dominion warlords and hungry splinter-cells of Protectorate insurgents, all waiting for the collapse of the Alliance leadership and poised to seize control of the strategically located settlement. The Alliance hires the players to investigate and negotiate with some of the growing street gangs to attempt to quell potential uprisings. In particular, they are concerned with Yvonne Korsiv, a fanatical Armanian insurgent rapidly gaining notoriety as a strong anti-Alliance voice. Players are sent to investigate her group and determine if she might be negotiable.<br/><br/>"}, "71018": {"rpg": {"524": "d20 System / OGL Product (D&D 3.5 Compatible)"}, "poll": {}, "name": "Tiefling", "rpgproducer": {"38431": "Louis Porter, Jr. Design Studio"}, "usersrated": "0", "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic721427.jpg", "rpgitemversion": {"35899": "PDF version"}, "rpgsetting": {"3944": "NeoExodus: A House Divided"}, "average": "0", "statistics": {}, "rpggenre": {"155": "Fantasy (High Fantasy)"}, "rpgcategory": {"2108": "Sourcebook (rules/options to enhance play)"}, "rpgseries": {"5306": "Races of NeoExodus"}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic721427_t.jpg", "description": "<br/>Publisher's blurb<br/><br/>Unknown and invisible, the Tieflings are shadows in the desert.

During Development, players take turns playing one card from their hand either as an animal (face-down) or as a trait on one of their existing animals (face-up and tucked under the animal). Traits include Carnivorous, Camouflage, Sharp Vision, Swimming, Poisonous and Communication; if a card has two traits, the player chooses which trait the animal acquires, hiding the other trait under the animal. Once a player passes during this phase, he can no longer play cards.<br/><br/>During Food Bank Determination, a player rolls 1-2 dice (possibly adding two to the total) to determine the amount of food available for the round.<br/><br/>During Feeding, players take turns acquiring one food cube and &quot;feeding&quot; one of their animals. Some traits give animals special abilities that can be used during Feeding or at other points during the game. Animals can also be carnivorous, allowing them to attack one other animal to feed &ndash; although that animal might have a defense like High Body Weight or Tail Loss that allows it to survive. An animal can't take more food than it needs unless it has fat tissue, which allows it to store food for future rounds.<br/><br/>During Extinction and Draw, any animal not fully fed dies; the owner takes that animal and all traits and stacks them in his personal discard pile. Each player then receives new cards in hand equal to one plus the number of live animals that player has.<br/><br/>When the deck runs out, the players conduct one final round, then score points.

Set in the vibrant fantasy realm of Terrinoth (first popularized by Runebound), DungeonQuest retains the peril, tension, and brutality of the beloved original game while updating both mechanical and thematic elements. Players take on the roles of courageous (or foolish) heroes willing to brave the legendary dangers of Dragonfire Dungeon. Fortune awaits those able to venture into the dragon&rsquo;s lair...<br/><br/>Legends say that the doors of Dragonfire Dungeon open every sunrise, welcoming brave adventurers into its depths. But once the sun sets, the doors close and seal the fates of those who lingered too long. Only a few have ever returned from Dragonfire Dungeon, and those who have usually come back near death. But they return as heroes nonetheless.<br/><br/>In DungeonQuest, players must guide their heroes through the twisting halls of Dragonfire Dungeon in pursuit of unimaginable riches hoarded by the Dragonlord Kalladra. Whoever can amass the most wealth and make it out of the dungeon before the closing of the doors seals their doom will emerge victorious. However, merely surviving the harrowing dungeon is a feat all its own...<br/><br/>While many similar games rely on a player to control the machinations of the dungeon, DungeonQuest is unique in that the dungeon essentially runs itself. No one at the table knows what lies around the corner, creating a new play experience every time. Additionally, DungeonQuest also includes rules for solo play, so you can even challenge Kalladra&rsquo;s keep on your own!<br/><br/>Great riches and everlasting glory await if you can survive Dragonfire Dungeon.

The Royal Navy gave Franklin two heavy Ships (HMS Terror and HMS Erebus) filled with scientific equipment, 1000 books, a crew of 128 men, and enough food to last for three years. They left England in May and encountered whalers along the west coast of Greenland in August. There, they waited for more favorable weather conditions for the crossing of the Lancaster Sound. Once the weather improved, they sailed into unknown waters, and no one ever heard from them again...<br/><br/>Their disappearance provoked a great deal of turmoil in public opinion, and numerous British and American expeditions attempted to find their trail. As leaders of these expeditions in Expedition: Northwest Passage, players must venture into these hazardous Arctic waters in order to discover Franklin's fate and succeed where he failed &ndash; by finding the Northwest Passage.

Retaining the spirit of its predecessor board game Ingenious, the games in Ingenious Challenges challenge players to score as many points as possible in each color/symbol while also forcing them to score points in all colors/symbols in order to do well. Four scoreboards with colored pegs and tracks for each color are used in each game, while the dice, cards and single-symbol tiles are used separately in their particular games.<br/><br/>&bull; In the Card Challenge (published separately as Einfach Genial: Das Kartenspiel), a player receives a hand of six cards, with one card placed face-up in front of him. On a turn, he plays one of his hand cards and scores as many points for each symbol on the played card as there are symbols lying in front of all players. These points are marked in the matching color track on a player's individual scoring board, and the first player to have seven or more points in all colors wins. Progress is complicated by three barriers on the scoring tracks, which cannot be passed unless all colors have been bumped to a certain level of points &ndash; thereby forcing players to push their colors evenly.<br/><br/>&bull; In the Dice Challenge (Einfach Genial: Das W&uuml;rfelspiel), players roll dice up to three times, then score as many points for each symbol on the rolled dice as there are symbols on the dice in front of the other players. Players record these points on their scoring boards, with the barriers causing hiccups on the way, and the first player to move all colors to seven points wins.<br/><br/>&bull; In the Tile Challenge (Einfach Genial: Wer zu viel riskiert, verliert!), all 126 tiles (21 of each color/symbol) are shuffled face down, then three are placed face up in a shared pool. On a turn, a player reveals a tile. If the tile doesn't match one in the pool, he adds all tiles revealed this turn to the pool and ends his turn; if it does match, the player can collect all tiles revealed this turn and all matching tiles in the pool, or take another turn. If you're the first player to collect seven tiles of each color, you win. If a player has a single color with fewer tiles in it than all other colors and a tile of that color is in the pool, the player can take one such tile and end his turn; this rule allows players to work toward that final color they need, while also pushing other players to try to remove that color from the pool.<br/><br/>Incorporates:<br/><br/>    Einfach Genial: Das Kartenspiel<br/>    Einfach Genial: Das W\u00fcrfelspiel<br/>    Simply Ingenious <br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": {"36093": "English first edition"}, "average": "5.91648", "name": "Ingenious Challenges", "playingtime": "30", "boardgamemechanic": {"2041": "Card Drafting"}, "age": "14", "usersrated": "412", "boardgamesubdomain": {"4666": "Abstract Games"}, "boardgamefamily": {"3400": "Fantasy Flight Silver Line Games"}}, "71100": {"boardgamedesigner": {"3": {"name": "(Uncredited)"}}, "poll": {}, "name": "Deft-initions", "playingtime": "0", "minplayers": "2", "yearpublished": "2006", "usersrated": "0", "maxplayers": "0", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1178805_t.jpg", "average": "0", "statistics": {}, "boardgamepublisher": {"3974": {"name": "Tippecanoe LLC"}}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1178805.jpg", "boardgameversion": {"36094": "Tippecanoe Tin Edition"}, "maxplaytime": "0", "boardgamecategory": {"1030": {"name": "Party Game"}}, "age": "12", "minplaytime": "0", "description": "Deft-initions&trade; is the great, new, anytime anywhere word-guessing game.<br/><br/>Based on the fact that many English words have disparate, widely distinct definitions &mdash; all of which are correct!<br/><br/>Each of 300 cards has a word to be guessed, and eight different definitions/clues &mdash; all of which are accurate.<br/><br/>A reader selects a clue, reads it out loud, and the other players shout out what they think the word to be guessed is.

Originally released in Japan on June 16, 1992 to critical acclaim, the game was translated and released in English by Working Designs the following year. Designed as a &quot;different kind of RPG&quot;,  Lunar: The Silver Star made use of the up-and-coming disc format by featuring CD-quality audio, video playback, and voice acting to narrate a fantasy  story set in a magical world. As the number one selling Sega CD title in Japan, the game sold nearly as many copies as the system itself, and remains the second highest-selling Sega CD title of all time.  The first game in the Lunar series, it set the standard for other follow-up titles, and was followed by a direct sequel, Lunar: Eternal Blue in 1994.<br/><br/>The game centers on the exploits of Alex, a young boy from a small town who dreams of one day becoming a great hero like his idol, Dragonmaster Dyne. When a childish adventure later turns to discovering an ancient dragon, Alex and his friends must journey across the world to gather the necessary power to become the next Dragonmaster, and save the world in the process.

For instance, though the hero of the game is named Link, it later devolves that the young boy you control throughout the game is NOT the same Link who was the protagonist for all prior games in the series (up through The Legend of Zelda: Majora's Mask). Instead, this young boy is the inhabitant of a realm separated from Hyrule by &quot;generations&quot;. The &quot;Hero of Time&quot; (the original Link) has become the stuff of legend, and local tradition has it that boys are clothed in green after his fashion when they come of age.<br/><br/>Through a series of events in which Link's sister Aryll is kidnapped by a giant bird searching for girls with a certain look, Link takes to the &quot;Great Sea&quot; (at Grandma's behest) to rescue her.<br/><br/>This marks the second large departure for The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker; instead of taking place on a sprawling, open map in which all the areas are connected, 'The Wind Waker' takes place primarily on a series of sparsely inhabited islands strewn about the Great Sea. In consequence, boat travel and exploration (as well as marine salvage) take center stage for much of the game.<br/><br/>What follows is an adventure that is every bit as grand as the Zelda name has come to represent. The familiar sword-and-item action is ever present, and the series' famous puzzles (focusing on the environmental type, in this installment) are everywhere, challenging players to overcome the odds and the obstacles if they wish to win through to the final fight...against a familiar foe.<br/><br/>"}, "71131": {"statistics": {}, "name": "\u014ckami", "videogamemode": {"2149": "Single-Player"}, "videogameversion": {"154626": "English/European PlayStation 2 edition"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic724282.jpg", "videogameseries": {"8113": "\u014ckami"}, "videogametheme": {"2471": "Animals"}, "videogamefranchise": {"6404": "Greatest Hits (Best Selling PlayStation Games, US)"}, "videogamecharacter": {"23861": "Abe"}, "usersrated": "202", "average": "7.92054", "videogamegenre": {"2161": "Action Adventure"}, "videogameplatform": {"4434": "PlayStation 2"}, "videogamehonor": {"31776": "2005 Game Critics Best Action/Adventure Game of the Year Nominee"}, "poll": {}, "vgcharacterversion": {"224246": "Abe"}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic724282_t.jpg", "description": "From the back cover<br/><br/>&quot;God.

Each has a particular set of rules in how it can be moved, how far, or under what conditions/direction it can attack. Black squares on the game board represent land, while white squares represent water.

Initially produced for the Apple II by Sir-Tech, it was subsequently ported to the Commodore 64 and the Nintendo Entertainment System.  The original Wizardry program was written in Basic which proved too slow to make the game a viable product. The game was rewritten in Pascal but was delayed until the release of a runtime system which would allow the game to be played on Apples without language systems.  Modeled on the Dungeons and Dragons game concept with the computer assuming the role of the Dungeon Master, the world of The Proving Grounds of the Mad Overload consists of a castle, an inn, a tavern, a trading post, a temple, the training grounds, and a three-dimensional maze, ten levels deep, below the castle.<br/><br/>In his review of Wizardry published in the May-June 1982 issue of Computer Gaming World, Mark Marlow prophetically concluded: &quot;I would rate Wizardry as one of the all time classic computer games. It sets the standard by which all fantasy role playing games should be compared. In the years to come, if there ever is a Gaming Hall of Fame, Wizardry receives my vote as the first entry into its hallowed halls.&quot;  The Proving Grounds of the Mad Overlord debuted as the highest ranking game in CGW's Reader Input Device with a score of 8.25 of 9; a position it did not relinquish for sixteen months until it was replaced in the first issue of 1984 by Ultima III: Exodus.  In 1988, Wizardry was one of eight games named to the Computer Gaming World Hall of Fame; with an average rating of 7.69 it was the second-highest rated game in the Hall behind only Ultima IV: Quest of the Avatar.<br/><br/>From the Box<br/><br/>Proving Grounds of the Mad Overlord is the first Wizardry scenario.  Starting in the safety of the castle, you assemble 1 to 6 adventurers to explore the magic and mystery of the ten level 3-D maze.  Your characters may be one of five races and eight professions, each with their own strengths and weaknesses to form a party which is just right for your intended expedition.<br/><br/>Under your command brawny warriors, frail mages, spell casting priests, and nimble thieves accumulate experience and treasure.  As your characters gain experience, they develop greater capabilities to become even better adventurers allowing them to venture deeper into the maze.<br/><br/>Did you buy the correct armor and magical items in the castle?  Are the characters able to cooperate effectively to achieve their mission?  Will your characters be strong enough to escape to the castle or an upper world.  Is your party properly prepared?<br/><br/>Be wary!  The treacherous 3-D maze has some tricks and traps of its own.  Hundreds of monsters, many with magical powers equal to your own, pits chutes, rotating rooms, teleporters, special one-of-a-kind surprises will keep you on your toes for many, many hours of fun.  You'll even be able to challenge your characters with subsequent scenarios featuring new dangers and more formidable foes.<br/><br/>"}, "71198": {"videogame": {"113760": "The Ultimate Wizardry Archives"}, "statistics": {}, "name": "Wizardry: The Knight of Diamonds \u2013 The Second Scenario", "videogamemode": {"2149": "Single-Player"}, "videogameversion": {"36380": "Apple II edition"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1608783.jpg", "videogameseries": {"4812": "Wizardry"}, "videogametheme": {"2148": "Fantasy"}, "usersrated": "9", "average": "7.65111", "videogamegenre": {"2155": "RPG"}, "videogameplatform": {"4978": "Apple II"}, "videogamehonor": {"22069": "1982 Charles S.

Most of Werdna's powers are depleted, and must be gradually recovered throughout the game. The initial goal is to climb to the top of the dungeon, reclaiming Werdna's full power along the way. Each level has one or more pentagrams at specific points. The pentagrams have three purposes: The first time a pentagram is discovered in a level, Werdna's strength increases, and a portion of his powers are restored. This only happens once per level; finding multiple pentagrams on a single level will not increase his powers multiple times. The second purpose is that monsters may be summoned from the pentagrams. The higher the level, the stronger the monsters available. There is no cost to summoning monsters, but only three parties of monsters may be summoned at a time, and any existing monsters will be replaced by the summoned ones.

Players could choose which side they wished to fight for, the aliens or the human defenders of Earth, and could also choose one of three different vehicles to combat with; each having its own advantages and disadvantages. Although Alien Front was fully playable for one person, it was primarily designed as an online game in which up to 8 players (up to 4 on each side) could battle it out. Players move around the arena attempting to blast each other with their weaponry, while also looking for power-ups that will enhance their ability to wreak massive destruction. Typically, the game was played for a set number of minutes, after which the team with the most kills would be declared the winners. Being killed while playing the game had no serious consequences (you simply respawned in a different part of the area you were in), but it did reflect on your win/loss score.<br/><br/>While the game was tremendously successful and arguably one of the Dreamcast's most critically accepted online titles, it came out so late in the lifespan of the system, that Sega's free online servers used to play the game moved to a pay model shortly after the game's release causing a tremendous shrinkage in the player base. Soon after, the Dreamcast's online servers went down for good (when Sega officially stopped supporting the console) and Alien Front was returned to being a single-player experience. While the game was certainly not revolutionary, it does have a place in gaming history as the first console title with online play to allow its players to communicate with their real voices using a supplied microphone attachment. While a player could only send a very short few seconds of his voice into the game, it made the competition much more tangible when vocal taunts and commands could be heard during the gameplay.&quot;<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;Alien_Front_Online,&quot; available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "71255": {"statistics": {}, "name": "Metroid Prime Hunters", "videogamemode": {"2422": "Local Multiplayer"}, "videogameversion": {"36617": "AU Nintendo DS edition"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic782302.jpg", "videogameseries": {"5371": "Metroid"}, "videogametheme": {"2264": "Science Fiction"}, "videogamefranchise": {"5396": "Metroid"}, "videogamecharacter": {"5767": "Samus Aran"}, "usersrated": "38", "average": "6.08158", "videogamegenre": {"2160": "First Person Shooter"}, "videogameplatform": {"4734": "Nintendo DS"}, "videogamehonor": {"32661": "2007 British Academy Game Awards Best Action/Adventure Game of the Year Nominee"}, "videogamecompilation": {"213713": "Metroid Prime: Hunters \u2013 First Hunt"}, "poll": {}, "vgcharacterversion": {"219957": "Samus"}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic782302_t.jpg", "description": "From the back of the case<br/><br/>&quot;The hunt is on.<br/><br/>A ferocious race, now extinct, has left behind relics of its once-powerful warrior culture.

It was later released in the United States on October 30, 2007 under the name Disgaea: Afternoon of Darkness.<br/>Afternoon of Darkness features extras over the original, such as a 16:9 format to take advantage of the PSP's widescreen display. There is also a mode that focuses on Etna as the main character. In Etna Mode, Etna kills Laharl by accident while trying to wake him in the beginning of the game and thus becomes the main character. There are some extra boss battles such as Overlord Zetta from Makai Kingdom and Rozalin and Adell from Disgaea 2. There is, for the first time, a multiplayer mode available through Ad-hoc connections. This features multiple modes such as a &quot;Defeat the Leader,&quot; &quot;Capture the Flag,&quot; and the original &quot;Battle.&quot; In the Multiplayer mode, each player also has access to &quot;Geocubes&quot; which give different effects to the battlefield. Other new additions include a music shop, which allows the player to listen to the game's various songs and even change the Item World theme, and a record keeper, which keeps track of various bits of information such as ally kills and obtained items.<br/><br/>In addition, Afternoon of Darkness includes a complete dual language option and the option to turn off battle animations. Most of the silent Japanese cut scenes now include voice acting. However, when set to English, the scenes that were originally silent in the PS2 release are still silent. To reflect Etna's recent voice actor change, her lines have been re-recorded to match Michelle Ruff's portrayal of Etna in Disgaea 2 and the anime.<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;Disgaea: Hour of Darkness&quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "71268": {"statistics": {}, "name": "La Pucelle: Tactics", "videogamemode": {"2149": "Single-Player"}, "videogameversion": {"36537": "English/European PlayStation 2 edition"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic729407.jpg", "videogametheme": {"2278": "Anime"}, "usersrated": "18", "average": "7.36111", "videogamegenre": {"2414": "Tactical Role-Playing Game"}, "videogameplatform": {"4434": "PlayStation 2"}, "poll": {}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic729407_t.jpg", "description": "From the back cover:<br/>&quot;You can only be so darling when you're hunting demons.<br/>She's loud.

The players have an identical deck of action cards and each card can be used multiple times. Each game turn, players secretly pick an action card that is revealed simultaneously with the other players. The actions are resolved in the numerical order of the action cards, with each player allocating the action to either one of their hornets on the game board. The hornets compete to collect nectar from the flower fields that is in turn used to produce honey in the nests. The winner of each hornet nest is resolved in a pre-determined order, with the winner being the player with the most honey in the nest. The game is won immediately by conquering three nests or by having won two nests by the end of the game with the highest aggregate amount of honey produced. The nature of the various action cards ensures high player interaction, causes a need for pre planning a number of turns ahead and allows the execution of cunning tactical moves. The easily comprehensible rules, variable game set-up and eye catching artwork with a cheerful theme facilitate an enduring and pleasant gaming experience.<br/><br/>Box back text:<br/>Hornet is a stinging tactical boardgame for the entire family in which players need to anticipate the moves of their opponents and at times also bluff a bit. Each player controls a pair of hornets swiftly flying about in flower fields collecting nectar and producing as much honey as they possibly can.

It is widely recognized for having popularized the first person shooter genre, pioneering immersive 3D graphics as well as true third dimension spatiality, networked multiplayer gaming, and support for customized additions and modifications.<br/><br/>The player takes the role of a nameless space marine who has been punitively posted to Mars after assaulting his commanding officer, who ordered his unit to fire upon civilians. The Martian marine base acts as security for the Union Aerospace Corporation (UAC), a multi-planetary conglomerate, which is performing secret experiments with teleportation by creating gateways between the two moons of Mars, Phobos and Deimos. The manual makes it clear that Phobos is considered by space marines to be the dullest assignment imaginable: &quot;with no action for fifty million miles, your day consisted of suckin' dust and watchin' restricted flicks in the rec room.&quot; This all changes when the UAC experiments go horribly awry. Computer systems on Phobos malfunction, Deimos disappears entirely, and &quot;something fragging evil&quot; starts pouring out of the gateway, killing or possessing all UAC personnel. Responding to a frantic distress call from the overrun scientists, the Martian marine unit is quickly sent to Phobos to investigate, where the player character is left to guard the hangar with only a pistol while the rest of the group proceeds inside. Over the course of the next few hours, the marine hears assorted garbled radio messages, gunfire, and screams, followed by silence: &quot;Seems your buddies are dead&quot;.<br/><br/>The objective of each level is simply to locate the exit room that leads to the next area, marked with an exit sign and/or a special kind of door, while surviving all hazards on the way. Among the obstacles are demonic monsters, pits of toxic or radioactive slime, ceilings that lower and crush the player character, and locked doors for which a keycard, skull-shaped key device, or remote switch must be located. The levels are sometimes labyrinthine and feature plenty of items such as additional ammo, health increases and other &quot;power-ups&quot; along the way, as well as the occasional secret areas which are not immediately obvious as a reward for players who explore more carefully.&quot;<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;Doom_(video_game),&quot; available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "71319": {"videogame": {"137266": "Doom 3: BFG Edition"}, "statistics": {}, "name": "Doom II: Hell on Earth", "videogamemode": {"2313": "Cooperative"}, "videogamecompilation": {"137266": "Doom 3: BFG Edition"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1436459.jpg", "videogameseries": {"4763": "Doom"}, "videogametheme": {"2265": "Horror"}, "usersrated": "296", "videogamecharacter": {"38464": "Cyberdemon"}, "videogameexpansion": {"131548": "3D Game Alchemy"}, "average": "7.62882", "videogamegenre": {"2160": "First Person Shooter"}, "videogameplatform": {"4714": "DOS"}, "videogameversion": {"261364": "English/European Game Boy Advance edition"}, "poll": {}, "vgcharacterversion": {"331706": "Cyberdemon"}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1436459_t.jpg", "description": "&quot;Doom II: Hell on Earth is a first-person shooter computer game originally released in 1994 as the sequel to the immensely popular Doom, which was released a year earlier.<br/><br/>The main additions to the game were the additional monsters available for the player to fight.

Like Grand Theft Auto, the mission pack is divided into sub-sections with short cut scenes between. London, 1969 was the first expansion pack released for PlayStation.<br/><br/>The player names their character (Default is 'Sid Vacant', a parody of Sid Vicious) and chooses a picture to represent them. The picture is only seen upon completion/failure of a mission and doesn't affect the appearance or personality in any way. The player must work for 'The Crisp Twins', another parody, this time of 'The Kray Twins'.<br/><br/>The expansion introduces 30 new vehicles, 32 new missions, and instead of fictional locations based on real-life cities, as in Grand Theft Auto (Liberty City, San Andreas and Vice City), the game takes place in London in 1969.

For one thing, these are just little squares of colored, laminated cardboard. The black scheme has little to do with Nazi Germany; it's a game publishing idea. German situation maps made during the war do often use black ink for SS units (with blue for regular Army, red for enemies, green for allies). Otherwise, it's a tradition out of the dawn of wargaming. When we asked for feedback on new counter sets, the black SS units were far and away the leading choice.<br/><br/>And so we have the Black SS set, 176 die-cut and mounted pieces in a new color scheme. It reproduces every SS unit and leader from three games: Elsenborn Ridge, Beyond Normandy and Road to Berlin. If you don't like the black scheme, you don't need them. If you like it and want to see the SS get crushed in the most visible form possible, it just plugs right in.

It has space for two AAA batteries, which provide about 10 hours of game play. The Pocket has a smaller link port, which requires an adapter to link with the older Game Boy. The port design is used on all subsequent Game Boy models, excluding the Game Boy Micro. The screen was changed to a true black-and-white display, rather than the &quot;pea soup&quot; monochromatic display of the original Game Boy. Also Game Boy Pocket (GBP) has a larger screen than the Game Boy Color (GBC) that later superseded it, the GBP's screen is 65mm (2.56&quot;) diagonal, width 48.5mm (1.91&quot;), height 43.5mm (1.71&quot;) compared to a 59mm (2.32&quot;) diagonal for the GBC. Again, and like the Game Boy, the Game Boy Pocket has no backlight to allow play in a darkened area. The first version did not have an LED to show battery levels. This was soon added due to public demand, along with new Game Boy Pocket units of different colors, some of them new to the Game Boy line.

The Game Boy Advance (also referred to as GBA) featured a 32 bit 16.8 MHz ARM. It included a Z80 processor and a switch activated by inserting a Game Boy or Game Boy Color game into the slot for backward compatibility, and had a larger, higher resolution screen. Controls were slightly modified with the addition of &quot;L&quot; and &quot;R&quot; shoulder buttons. The system was technically likened to the SNES and showed its power with successful ports of SNES titles such as Super Mario World and Super Mario World 2: Yoshi's Island. There were also new titles in popular SNES series, such as Mario Kart Super Circuit and F-Zero: Maximum Velocity, and a variety of original titles. A widely-criticized drawback of the Game Boy Advance is that the screen is not backlit, making viewing difficult in some conditions. The Game Paks for the GBA are roughly half the length of original Game Boy cartridges, and so older Game Paks would stick out of the top of the unit. When playing older games, the GBA provides the option to play the game at the standard equal square resolution of the original screen or the option to stretch it over the wider GBA screen.<br/><br/>"}, "71443": {"statistics": {}, "name": "Jazz Jackrabbit 2", "videogamemode": {"2422": "Local Multiplayer"}, "videogameversion": {"37041": "Windows"}, "average": "6.71053", "videogameseries": {"5109": "Jazz Jackrabbit"}, "videogametheme": {"2264": "Science Fiction"}, "usersrated": "19", "videogamegenre": {"2147": "Action"}, "videogameplatform": {"4977": "Windows"}, "poll": {}, "description": "&quot;Jazz Jackrabbit 2 is a platform game produced by Epic MegaGames, now known as Epic Games.

It requires use of the Dungeon Master's Guide and Player's Handbook to play. It is compatible with the Spelljammer campaign setting. It can also be used with the Dragonstar campaign setting.<br/><br/>The Beast's Black Fortress crosses the void of space, hopping from planet to planet. Once the Black Fortress lands, Slayers spill out of its womb, burning villages and towns, torturing and slaying everyone in their path. The Beast will accept nothing less than genocide in its conquest of every planet for its own, dark purposes. What it does with a planet once it takes over is unknown, but it's clear that the Beast and its Slayers have powers far outstripping the cultures they invade.<br/><br/>The Role of the Heroes<br/><br/>There are several ideal situations to introduce the player characters (PCs). Two examples include: an armed guard contingent protecting the prince, or a ragtag band of bandits and mercenaries who later swear their allegiance to the king in a battle of survival. Prince Colwyn is not picky about who will be in his &quot;army&quot; -- he's desperate enough to consider anyone who isn't with the Beast. This sort of campaign is recommended for a more combat-oriented group. If there are spellcasters, none of them should have a means of teleportation.<br/><br/>Theme<br/><br/>The Beast and his minions have an eerie, science fictionish bent, although there is not actually anything to indicate that they use technology. The Slayers are alien, the Black Fortress looks like a scene out of Aliens (the movie) and everything looks like a desiccated skeleton. With the Beast's Black Fortress flying through space, it could easily invade any game world. The Beast's tactics are inelegant but effective, as the Slayers are immune to most environmental hindrances (asphyxiation, poisons, food, fatigue, etc.). While not particularly powerful singly, an army of these beings will easily outstrip even a well-armed contingent of knights through sheer numbers alone.<br/> <br/>From the Publisher's Website:<br/><br/>This D20 Fantasy campaign setting/adventure includes an adventure synopsis and campaign setting with 10 scenes, a new race (cyclops), 10 new NPCs, 3 new magic items, and 4 new monsters.<br/><br/>"}, "71490": {"statistics": {}, "name": "Liberation", "videogamemode": {"2149": "Single-Player"}, "videogameversion": {"37207": "UK Amiga edition"}, "average": "6.66667", "videogameseries": {"5387": "Captive"}, "videogametheme": {"2281": "Cyberpunk"}, "usersrated": "3", "videogamegenre": {"2339": "Action RPG"}, "videogameplatform": {"4415": "Amiga"}, "poll": {}, "description": "&quot;Liberation: Captive 2 is an Amiga game that was written by Byte Engineers and published by Mindscape in 1994.

However, the object of Liberation is to find and free a prisoner by gathering clues and following leads.

It has since been ported to numerous home computers and video game consoles.<br/><br/>At the time, its stand-out features included in-game music and sound effects, excellent playability, and colourful graphics, which were well designed for the graphical limitations of the ZX Spectrum. The Spectrum's video display allowed the background and foreground colors to be exchanged automatically without software attention and the &quot;animated&quot; load screen appears to swap the words Manic and Miner through clever manipulation of this feature.&quot;<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;Manic_Miner,&quot; available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>Individual credits:<br/>Matthew Smith: design<br/><br/>"}, "71492": {"statistics": {}, "name": "The Killing Game Show", "videogamemode": {"2149": "Single-Player"}, "videogameversion": {"37215": "UK Amiga edition"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic911444.jpg", "videogametheme": {"2264": "Science Fiction"}, "usersrated": "2", "average": "7.5", "videogamegenre": {"2164": "Platform"}, "videogameplatform": {"4415": "Amiga"}, "poll": {}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic911444_t.jpg", "description": "&quot;The Killing Game Show (also known as Fatal Rewind) is a run and gun shooter game developed by Raising Hell Software for the Amiga and Atari ST. It was released in 1990 and published by Psygnosis. It was re-released later under the name Fatal Rewind for the Sega Genesis and published by Electronic Arts. The music and sound effects for the game were created by Ray Norrish. The main character of the game later made cameos in Leander and Wiz 'n' Liz.<br/><br/>This game is a mixture between platformer and shoot'em up. It looks very similar to the popular computer video game Turrican. Apart from avoiding or shooting enemies moving in different patterns you must make your way from the bottom up to the level exit because after a few seconds toxic liquid will start to rise. At the beginning of each level you may display a map by pressing the Help key (Amiga version). You can jump, run, climb walls and use special weapons or items (keys to open certain gates) to master different sections of these levels. After you lose one life you see a replay and be able to continue at any point by pushing the fire button. You can fast-forward the replay by holding the F10 key pressed. This was a unique and convenient feature because like other Psygnosis titles the game has a high degree of difficulty.&quot;<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;The_Killing_Game_Show,&quot; available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "71493": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic883238.jpg", "poll": {}, "boardgamedesigner": {"11257": {"name": "Robert A.

For example, Sandor &ldquo;the Hound&rdquo; Clegane uses the new fearsome keyword, refusing to let his enemies disengage and forcing them to retreat two hexes for each morale result rolled in combat.<br/><br/>In addition to commanders, Wardens of the West also introduces three all-new unit types of Lannister affiliation. The House Brax pikemen specialize in formations, while the Clegane crossbowmen utilize the new aimed shot keyword. The Westerlands militia are easy to break and lack formal military training, but they make up for it in their vast numbers.<br/><br/>Wardens of the West adds more than 30 new plastic miniatures and over 30 new cards. It also includes a Rules and Battle Plans book as well as more terrain overlays, banners, and tokens.
