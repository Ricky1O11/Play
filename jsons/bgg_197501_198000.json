As the head of Central Command, conquer and occupy other worlds that hold the precious resources required to expand your rule; planting the flag of Cardassia Prime on the rubble of vanquished empires. Or demonstrate to your rivals that your ordered society is superior and set the Cultural example for the Galaxy.<br/><br/>Conquest and occupation drive the great engine of the Cardassian Union. This relentless hunger affects the Cardassian player&rsquo;s game in the form of two Special Rules displayed on the player&rsquo;s Control Console.<br/><br/>1) OCCUPATION<br/>Occupied worlds may not recognize the superiority of Cardassian rule however, but Cardassia knows that a firm hand must always be present to ensure compliance, represented by their Occupation rule. Cardassian Controlled Systems only generate production if there are Cardassian ships in orbit.<br/><br/>2) ANNEXATION<br/>Unrelenting war and invasion add to the glory of Cardassia under their Annexation rule. Take 1 Culture each time you successfully invade a planet.<br/><br/>The Cardassian player earns one Culture Token each time they successfully invade a planet.<br/><br/>The cards found in the Cardassian Advancement Deck reinforce their commitment to military might and the subversion of their enemies. The efficiency of Cardassian rule is immediately apparent with their Starting Advancement; Totalitarian Regime allows the Cardassian player to start the game with Six Command Tokens. Cardassian Labor Camps work in conjunction with their Occupation rule, allowing Cardassia to mine Production Tokens from their Culture Nodes to fuel their war machine. While crude by the standards of other civilizations, the Cardassians clever use of Gravitic-based technology allows them to scan their space using a Gravitic Sensor Net countering the advantage of rivals who employ Romulan Cloaking Technology.<br/><br/>Large formations of Cardassian Starships are ideal for conquest, but Cardassia also makes strategic use of smaller formations to attack their foes. Hunter Killer Fleets are designed to exploit a target&rsquo;s weakness; in the first round of a Space Battle, each ship in the Fleet automatically Scores a Hit. This small formation will likely be broken up in the first round of the battle, but its impact can be devastating, especially if used in conjunction with a larger formation.<br/><br/>The addition of the Cardassian Union to the game puts the Federation, Klingons and Romulans on notice that their worlds and territories are no longer safe. In the coming weeks we&rsquo;ll take a closer look at the new worlds the Union is destined to control and the unique phenomena found in Cardassian space, as well as a preview of the new encounters they&rsquo;ll add to the game with their new Exploration Cards.

Beyond that, a flotilla of Marauders, commanded by profit-hungry DaiMons, stand ready to enforce your mergers and acquisitions across the quadrant.<br/><br/>To a Ferengi, profit is everything and the special rules for the Ferengi player reinforce that.<br/><br/>1) PROFIT OVER PROFUNDITY<br/>The Ferengi may never build Culture Nodes.

The Ferengi may build Production Nodes on any available spot regardless of Capacity type.<br/><br/>Other Civilizations devote tremendous resources to scientific and cultural advancements whereas the Ferengi add to the wisdom that has guided their civilization for centuries, the venerated Rules of Acquisition. The very first Grand Nagus set down these guiding principals over ten thousand years ago and each Nagus in succession has been adding to these rules to guide each Ferengi transaction to maximum profitability. The Starting Advancement establishes the Ferengi Commerce Authority, whose agents and liquidators enforce Ferengi Trade Bi-Laws, uphold the Ferengi Bill of Opportunities and ensure that all transactions within the Alliance are true to the Rules of Acquisition. In the game, the FCA allows the Ferengi player to earn 1 Production for each rival Controlled System that has a Ferengi Ship in Orbit. Rule #45 Expand or Die permits the Ferengi to pay the Culture costs of Hegemony and Colonization by paying 2 Production per Culture required. Rule #34 War Is Good For Business allows you to profit from the combative nature of rival species by generating one Production for the Ferengi each time some aggressive ally let their trigger finger do their negotiating instead of their diplomats.<br/><br/>Ferengi DaiMons generally strike out on their own for individual profit, but at the behest of their Nagus, they will group their Marauders into larger formations to seek profit and enforce Ferengi trade laws. One such formation is the Commerce Enforcement Squadron, an elite group of Liquidators and Auditors whose authority allow them to enter Systems containing rival Starships in order to ensure that best trade practices are being observed. Of course, opportunity can pop up at any moment, so the authority of an Enforcement Squadron allows them to enter Warp during the Ferengi turn without exhausting a Command to do so.<br/><br/>The arrival of the Ferengi Alliance finally shifts the balance of the game away from the foolish ideals of Cultural Advancement or the barbaric need for military conquest and puts the focus squarely on the most important issue facing the Galaxy, personal financial gain.<br/><br/>"}, "197521": {"boardgamedesigner": {"90443": {"name": "Rodrigo Salvay"}}, "average": "6.85714", "poll": {}, "name": "Kallat", "playingtime": "45", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": {"2023": "Co-operative Play"}, "yearpublished": "2016", "usersrated": "7", "maxplayers": "5", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2968099_t.png", "boardgameartist": {"91290": "Paola Diaz"}, "statistics": {}, "boardgamepublisher": {"4": {"name": "(Self-Published)"}}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2968099.png", "boardgameversion": {"307246": "First edition"}, "maxplaytime": "45", "boardgamecategory": {"1010": {"name": "Fantasy"}}, "age": "16", "minplaytime": "20", "description": "In the beginnings of times was Keberadaan, and he decided to release the energy whose expansion created all the known planes. The tenth plane is the one of Kallat. A summoner society that uses the energy form Keberadaan to bring life to incredible creatures and fulfill the missions that are imposed.<br/>Now you can be a Summoner from the Kallat&rsquo;s universe, start your training and fight against others who are trying to enter in this world.<br/><br/>'Kallat' is a strategy game in which you are a Summoner that materializes different creatures to fight against a rival or between teams. You have the possibility to choose your own Summon&rsquo;s grimoire that will contribute Life and Existence Points to your Pyre. These points are the ones you need to take care if you do not want to lose your battle.<br/>At first, you will take 6 Tactic/ Strategy Cards and place your Monolith in the board. Now is the moment when you can start summoning the creatures that will represent you in the battle field. In the second turn, your Summons will be able to move around the board as well as they can attack using their weapons, skills, spells, etc. in the quest to reduce the Life of the opposite party and wind the encounter. There are certain attacks with altered states that produce extra damage and there are others in which magic is involved; therefore, they not only consume your Action Points but also your Existence Points. So be careful when you use them! Even though they are very powerful, excessive use of them can put your creature in a high risk since loosing all your Existence Points will make you loose the battle.<br/>Tactics and Strategy Cards are not only to summon a creature since they can also bring you extra help that, if you use wisely, can turn around the outcome of the game.<br/>Another way of winning the game is with special attacks meant to destroy all the enemy creatures by removing their Projection Points. Each eliminated Summon gives you one Victory Point. At the beginning of the training, the party can decide the maximum number of Victory Points needed to win the game (usually 3 to 5 points).<br/>Furthermore, you have different boards to create sceneries in the shape you want. Also, you can determine the weather and lightning of each territory. Notice that each feature comes with its own consequences.<br/>Kallat is thought for you, as Summoner, to feel part of a world full of energy and action in which your battle expertise and the knowledge of the creatures you choose from your Grimoire can make you the best Summoner of all times.<br/><br/>"}, "197523": {"rpg": {"356": "Generic / Universal"}, "poll": {}, "name": "Trapped Field", "rpgproducer": {"60450": "Christian Hollnbuchner"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2967143.jpg", "usersrated": "0", "rpgitemversion": {"307248": "PDF version"}, "average": "0", "statistics": {}, "rpggenre": {"940": "Action / Adventure"}, "rpgcategory": {"2086": "Accessory (dice, maps, screens, cards)"}, "rpgseries": {"18350": "Battlemaps (by Christian Hollnbuchner)"}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2967143_t.jpg", "description": "From publisher blurb:<br/><br/>This full color battlemap is the 297th of a series featuring various terrains.

And instead of placing workers on action spaces, players place them BETWEEN action spaces to activate adjacent actions.  Plus, the action spaces themselves are modular and change order and frequency each round, creating an ever-changing environment that challenges players to use adaptive strategy to be successful.

When mankind left behind their old home to seek out new lands beyond the dark spaces between galaxies, they hoped to leave behind them the conflict and chaos that has been their heritage since they first spoke tales of their histories. However, it wasn't as easy as that. Even amongst alien species, mankind still found cause to war amongst itself. Several decades before, the Sondak Confederacy worried about the growing power of the United Central Systems, a group dominated by humans genetically modified to have a much longer life span. As a result, they launched a war that waged for years tearing at both societies until finally they forced the U.C.S. to accept humiliating terms in exchange for peace. The Sondak Confederacy is complacent and unaware that the U.C.S. is on the verge of finally seeking vengeance for the loss of the previous war. And in the churning wake of these two giants, all the races of the galaxy and the lives of many individuals shall be turned upside down. But the question is whose vengeance is being sought? Is it that of a nation's or could it be that of a single person?

In diesem Band widmen wir uns der Magischen Dom&auml;ne, der Gesamtheit der Feenwelten, der urspr&uuml;nglichen Heimat der meisten magischen Kreaturen und der m&auml;chtigen Feenf&uuml;rsten, die in ihrer Macht zumindest in ihrer Heimat Gottheiten kaum nachstehen.<br/><br/>Jenseits der Grenzen beleuchtet die Natur der Feenwelten und ihrer Bewohner, die Gesetze, die ihr Zusammenleben und ihr Verh&auml;ltnis zu den Sterblichen regeln. Der Band zeigt, unter welchen Bedingungen ein Wechsel vom Diesseits in die magische Dom&auml;ne m&ouml;glich ist, was man beachten muss, um die Gunst der Feen in Pakte zu schmieden oder ihren Zorn mit Vertr&auml;gen zu vermeiden, welche Grenzen f&uuml;r die Feen Einladung zum &Uuml;bergang und welche solide Barrieren sind, wie man trotz aller verwirrenden und wundersamen Eindr&uuml;cke die Orientierung beh&auml;lt und welche Mysterien, Sch&auml;tze und Gefahren auf den Sterblichen warten.<br/><br/>Auch die Welten, die sich hinter den Portalen auftun, sind eigenst&auml;ndige Feenwelten. Diese Mondpfade gehorchen eigenen, besonderen Gesetzen. Sie sind sicherlich die bekanntesten jenseitigen Welten, aber auch, wenn sie recht h&auml;ufig besucht werden, halten sie doch f&uuml;r den Durchreisenden bizarre &Uuml;berraschungen und Gefahren f&uuml;r K&ouml;rper, Geist und Seele bereit.<br/><br/>Neben den &quot;typischen&quot; Feenwelten, die neben den gro&szlig;en Kulturregionen von Lorakis liegen und die dort das Bild der magischen Dom&auml;ne pr&auml;gen, gibt es noch eine Unzahl sehr spezieller Lokalit&auml;ten, Feenh&ouml;fe und Subdom&auml;nen, von denen Jenseits der Grenzen eine Auswahl pr&auml;sentiert, um Ihnen die Vielgestaltigkeit der Anderswelten zu verdeutlichen.

The sonorous sounds of those distant encounters were heard fearfully by awed and wondering folk on the coasts of England, the Netherlands and France, drifting in like a distant thunder. (Hainsworth and Churches, 1998)<br/><br/>A Distant Thunder is a Historical Simulation of the Anglo-Dutch wars at Sea of the Mid-Seventeenth Century.  The bitter commercial rivalry between England and the Dutch Republic sparked a series of three wars fought in the span of just over two decades.  These hard-fought conflicts spurred innovations in the art and science of war at sea and would serve as the template for maritime conflict for the next two centuries.<br/><br/>A Distant Thunder examines war at sea at the dawn of the age of fighting sail at both the Battle (tactical) and Campaign levels. In the Battle Game, players recreate single historical engagements between fleets. The simple initiative and control system allows players to select maneuvers and move groups of ships in a way that models the inherent friction of command and control of the time.  Maneuvers are executed using counters representing groups of 3-4 ships, allowing players to easily recreate the often very large (~90 ships in each fleet) battles of these wars.<br/><br/>Campaign Game Scenarios focus on important portions (approximately 2 months) of each of these wars. In a Campaign, players strive to secure control of the sea, while denying it to their opponent. Players must pay close attention to logistics, weather and tides to ensure their battle-fleets are in the proper condition and position to prevail.  Fog of war models the limited intelligence available to the commanders.  Players provide orders to their fleets on a Campaign map, and when opposing forces meet, battle is resolved on the Battle Map as with the tactical game.<br/><br/>A Distant Thunder covers a number of historical Battle and Campaign scenarios including:<br/><br/>First Anglo Dutch War(1652-1654):<br/>Dover\u25cfPlymouth\u25cfKentish Knock\u25cfDungeness\u25cfPortland\u25cfGabbard Shoal\u25cfScheveningen<br/><br/>Second Anglo Dutch War(1665-1667):<br/>Lowestoft\u25cfThe Four Days Battle\u25cfSt. James Day Fight<br/><br/>Third Anglo Dutch War(1672-1674)<br/>Solebay\u25cfFirst Battle of Schooneveld\u25cfSecond Battle of Schooneveld\u25cfTexel<br/><br/>Battles range from relatively small engagements (~20 ships per side) to very large (~100 ships per side). Battle scenarios can be played in a few hours and the tactical system is highly suitable for solitaire play.<br/><br/>Campaign scenarios range from approximately 6 to more than 20 hours to play.<br/><br/>"}, "197550": {"statistics": {}, "name": "Blokd", "videogamemode": {"2621": "AI Only"}, "videogameversion": {"307290": "Web Browser Edition"}, "average": "0", "videogametheme": {"2351": "Puzzle"}, "usersrated": "0", "videogamegenre": {"2165": "Puzzle"}, "videogameplatform": {"5084": "Web Browser"}, "poll": {}, "description": "Your new favourite game to play with friends and family<br/><br/>BLOKD is an easy to play board game, the rules are simple, you have to block your opponent to win, at each turn, the player has the choice to move his cube or to block a square, the cube can be moved like the 'queen pawn' in chess game, any empty square can be blocked.<br/><br/>You win the game when you block your opponent, in other words when all the squares around the opponent's cube are blocked and he can't move his cube any more.<br/><br/>Source: Game Website  <a target='_blank' href='http://blokd.asayah.fr/' rel='nofollow'>http://blokd.asayah.fr/</a><br/><br/>"}, "197551": {"boardgamedesigner": {"76530": {"name": "Martino Chiacchiera"}}, "average": "6.485", "poll": {}, "name": "Hall of Fame", "playingtime": "30", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": {"2023": "Co-operative Play"}, "yearpublished": "2016", "usersrated": "20", "maxplayers": "8", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3007965_t.jpg", "boardgameartist": {"90953": "Massimo Fratini"}, "statistics": {}, "boardgamepublisher": {"29696": {"name": "CosplaYou"}}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3007965.jpg", "boardgameversion": {"307303": "First edition"}, "maxplaytime": "30", "boardgamecategory": {"1002": {"name": "Card Game"}}, "age": "7", "minplaytime": "15", "description": "Hall of Fame is a deck of 80 big cards with each card showing only the picture and the name of a famous historical or fictional character (Cleopatra, Santa, The Mad Hatter, Buddha, Snow white, Lincoln,...).<br/><br/>Players can use this deck to play 3 different games (a deduction cooperative game, a trick-taking &amp; storytelling game, and a game similar to Apples to Apples featuring a nice new twist).<br/>All 3 games make use of the stereotypes and characteristics of the characters.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>"}, "197552": {"statistics": {}, "name": "Pigeon Simulator 9000", "videogamemode": {"2149": "Single-Player"}, "videogameversion": {"307314": "Windows Phone edition"}, "average": "0", "videogametheme": {"2471": "Animals"}, "usersrated": "0", "videogamegenre": {"2314": "Arcade"}, "videogameplatform": {"11423": "Windows Phone"}, "poll": {}, "description": "It&rsquo;s hard to be a pigeon.<br/><br/>In Pigeon Simulator 9000, you will make sure of it personally.<br/><br/>You will be amazed with an incredible realism of this Pigeon Simulator.<br/><br/>Eat food and do droppings on humans.

Facing Away brings to life situations where characters might find themselves on the back end of a friendship that has ended, or the death of a loved one, or even a split due to fortuitous circumstances. The concepts of distance and time are executed by removing the ability to see the other players through a Game Space mechanic.<br/><br/>Facing Away utilizes no table, no GM, no pens and/or paper, and only one d12. Players will arrange chairs in a circle, then turn the chairs to face outward from the center, or inward towards the center, depending on the round. The action starts with a round of monologues, with each subsequent player taking on the character of someone referred to by a previous player in the round. Rounds 2 and 3 allows the players to develop scenes, and a word-count epilogue brings closure to the session.<br/><br/>Perfect for one-shots, or even lighter, shorter RPG sessions, Facing Away is a great game on its own, and can even be used as a tool for gamers to help develop characters and character relationships.

After centuries of intermittent and reoccurring war between the English and Spanish, these two maritime powers had managed to work out a trade agreement that ended their conflicts but not their longstanding enmity.

The strategy of using Fire Bases (also termed Fire Support Bases) was created as part of President Nixon&rsquo;s  &ldquo;Vietnamization&rdquo; of the conflict in which US forces were gradually withdrawn and the bulk of the fighting turned over to the ARVN (Army of the Republic of [South] Vietnam). General George Casey, Sr. developed the Fire Base strategy in which US Artillery and other battlefield support assets were deliberately deployed in forward areas to disrupt the Communists&rsquo; lines of communication and supply, thereby inviting them to attack. Once the enemy was in the open and engaged the US forces would then call in massive amounts of air and artillery support to wreak devastation upon their foe. A Fire Base was only to be in one location 3 to 5 days, and extensive fortifications were not possible as everything had to be removed and redeployed by helicopter in a matter of hours. By April 1st 1970 Fire Base Illingworth had been in place for 11 days, allowing the NVA to completely map-out the American&rsquo;s positions, size up the garrison, and determine its weak points. Adding to Fire Base Illingworth&rsquo;s woes was the arrival of thousands of 8 inch artillery rounds on March 31st. The garrison had only hours to provide rudimentary protection for the new ammo dump by the time of the NVA&rsquo;s attack.<br/><br/>The survivors of Alpha Troop and Charlie Companies who were garrisoning the fire base thought they had reached a place of refuge where they could rest, recuperate, and train their newly arrived replacements (FNGs as they were derisively termed by the veterans). However, the NVA saw the opportunity to exact revenge upon the Americans grow with each passing day Fire Base Illingworth remained in place.<br/><br/>"}, "197657": {"rpgitemversion": {"307475": "PDF version"}, "poll": {}, "name": "Swords in the Sewers", "rpgproducer": {"9798": "Gary Simpson"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2972774.jpg", "usersrated": "0", "average": "0", "statistics": {}, "rpg": {"1789": "4e Game System Product (D&D 4.0 Compatible)"}, "rpgcategory": {"2086": "Accessory (dice, maps, screens, cards)"}, "rpggenre": {"1013": "Fantasy (Sword & Sorcery)"}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2972774_t.jpg", "description": "Publisher Blurb:<br/>In the dirt-ridden tunnels below the city, deformed evils stir and a race of ratmen long thought gone prepare to rise.

People are starving, the roads are dangerous to travel and the nation's foreign enemies have begun to stir at the borders. The kingdom cries out for a new ruler - and you are the head of a minor house who intend to answer that call... if you can do so before your adversaries take what should be yours.<br/><br/>Now is your chance. Restore order under your rule and claim the throne for yourself.<br/><br/>In Crown of Exile players compete to seize control of a kingdom at the verge of a dark age while guarding themselves from opponents with ambitions of their own, and underhanded ways of interfering.<br/><br/>Crown of Exile is a game for 2-5 players that takes 90 minutes to play. The rules are simple to learn but offer a depth of strategy that will keep both experienced gamers and newcomers scheming and plotting over and over again.<br/><br/>How to Play:<br/><br/>Crown of Exile is a game about developing your domain and deciding when you have built enough to risk taking on quests. Move too quickly and your opponents might interfere, leaving you unable to fulfill your quests, but move too slowly and someone else will take what could have been yours. You can be an aggressor and try to steal what others have as a means to victory, subtly manipulate the flow of the game with political influence, or trade to gain enormous resources quickly, but give your rivals the opportunity to profit.<br/><br/>In Crown of Exile players begin with a hand of cards representing their domain - a treasury, serfs, nobles, and infantry, they also begin with a knight and a construction card. Unlike other deckbuilding games Crown of Exile gives you access to all of your drafted cards, but limits players to only four each round, forcing players to balance generating resources versus expansion and conquest.<br/><br/>Each round players will use four of their cards to generate resources, attack, trade, draft new cards and complete quests that will grant them various bonuses, including titles and victory points needed to win the game.<br/><br/>Once completed, quests require you to pay an upkeep cost to maintain the order and control you have established, and keep the advantages provided by those quests. So as you gain power and complete more quests your resources will become strained- and your opponents may attempt to sabotage you and try to steal your quests by preventing you from gaining the necessary resources.<br/><br/>At the end of every round players pay their upkeeps and gain bonuses based on their titles and quests and then pick up all of their cards and begin another round. Play continues until one player has achieved the rank of &quot;Prince&quot; or 8 rounds have elapsed.<br/><br/>"}, "197680": {"rpgitemversion": {"307518": "PDF version"}, "statistics": {}, "name": "The Spellbook of the Uruks", "rpgproducer": {"40080": "David Ullery"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2970255.jpg", "usersrated": "0", "rpgsetting": {"26197": "Trollworld"}, "average": "0", "rpggenre": {"155": "Fantasy (High Fantasy)"}, "rpg": {"2313": "Tunnels & Trolls (7th - 7.5 Editions)"}, "rpgcategory": {"2108": "Sourcebook (rules/options to enhance play)"}, "poll": {}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2970255_t.jpg", "description": "From publisher blurb:<br/><br/>Violent sorcery of a violent people, these are the curses of Arahk Gnahk.<br/><br/>"}, "197681": {"rpg": {"25418": "5e Game System Product (D&D 5th Edition Compatible)"}, "poll": {}, "name": "Treasury of the Macabre (5E)", "rpgproducer": {"14055": "Rick Hershey"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2970254.jpg", "usersrated": "0", "rpgitemversion": {"307519": "PDF version"}, "average": "0", "statistics": {}, "rpggenre": {"155": "Fantasy (High Fantasy)"}, "rpgcategory": {"2108": "Sourcebook (rules/options to enhance play)"}, "rpgseries": {"26918": "Gothic Adventure Path Plug-Ins"}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2970254_t.jpg", "description": "From publisher blurb:<br/><br/>Treasures from the Crypt<br/> The Treasury of the Macabre is a collection of 30 haunted and horrible magic items designed for a horror-themed 5E game, like the official 5th Edition Curse of the Vampire adventure saga or any campaign exploring the mist-shrouded Loft of Ravens.

The answer, of course, is in the trap&rsquo;s surroundings. Distractions, misleading clues, and red herrings are all good only when there are other traps or creatures that can take advantage of them. Making intruders waste time, dispel magic spells, and use up other resources is perfectly fine if they are going to have an encounter where they could have put these valuable assets to better use. Used a bit of your Luck ability to improve an unexplainably failing Disable Device check? You might mourn when you need it a few rounds later.<br/><br/>While many dabblers in Spellcraft know that a lock or hinge can have a false trap, few expect the same from an arrow slit or a crossbeam. The variant spell components provided below can help one make a better surprise of this simple illusion.<br/><br/>Lastly, Phantom Traps and other diversions can be combined with real traps. While designing such encounters, one needs a bit longer preparation than normal, but it really pays off when you have intruders struggle with a false trap and a real one comes upon them undetected and unexpected. The &ldquo;Sample Traps&rdquo; section at the end of this Spell Book provides some examples of magical and mechanical combinations that increase chances of a real trap working properly rather than getting routinely disarmed by the first rogue that comes upon it.<br/><br/>"}, "197688": {"statistics": {}, "name": "Heroes Weekly (Vol 5, Issue 14 - Dart)", "rpgproducer": {"5349": "Robert Hemminger"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2970247.png", "usersrated": "0", "average": "0", "rpgissue": {"23982": "Heroes Weekly"}, "rpgissuearticle": {"188572": "Dart"}, "rpg": {"2791": "Pathfinder System Compatible Product"}, "rpgissueversion": {"307527": "PDF version"}, "poll": {}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2970247_t.png", "description": "From publisher blurb:<br/><br/>Packed full of great superhero fun, each issue offers a short adventure, an NPC, or some game mechanics for the Heroes Wear Masks system.

This book concentrates on one of the most active and interesting episodes in the history of warfare - the Napoleonic Wars.  The author firmly believes that wargames should duplicate the conditions and events of real warfare as far as is possible within the context of a set of rules.  Among the factors which he stresses are the use of realistic scales and the importance of morale.  He also believes that, provided the player has done his research, the rules should be flexible enough to allow him to employ unconventional tactics.  After all, neither Napoleon nor Wellington won their battles by sticking to previously accepted ideas on tactics.<br/>This book is the result of a long experience of wargaming and painstaking historical research.  Whether the reader accept the author's conclusions or not he will certainly find much both to enjoy and discuss.

The TV game is a Central Production made in association with Mark Goodson and Talbot Television.<br/><br/>User Summary<br/><br/>Blockbusters was a highly popular British TV show (though originally based on an American format) hosted by Bob Holness. Students, one single and one team of two, would compete to answer questions to fill in hexagons on a grid. Each hexagon was filled with a letter, and the answer to the question started with that letter. If a team answered a question correctly it would turn their colour (white or blue) and they could then choose the next location on the grid, leading to the famous catchphrase &quot;Can I have a 'P' please, Bob?&quot; (having a Pee is British slang for urinating).<br/><br/>The aim of the game is for the single student (playing white) to connect from top to bottom, a minimum of four spaces, and for the pair of students to connect from left to right, a minimum of five spaces.<br/><br/>Winning would allow the team to progress to the Gold Run, where a single student (the pair would alternate if they won multiple times) would attempt to cross a more complicated version of the board.<br/><br/>This computer version is cut down in several ways. Firstly, the grid is only four by four. This is presumably because it is a two-player only game (there is no AI, nor is there a possibility to play 1 vs. 2 - there is only one 'buzzer' button for the blue team), so it would be unfair to handicap either player with having to complete an extra space. Secondly, there is no Gold Run (a seperate single-player Gold Run game was subsequently released).<br/><br/>Players can select the number of games to play in a series, and a skill level (which alters the time allowed to answer). The game reveals the question word by word and either player can 'buzz in' to answer.<br/><br/>"}, "197900": {"rpg": {"2791": "Pathfinder System Compatible Product"}, "poll": {}, "name": "Horrifically Overpowered Mythic Feats", "rpgproducer": {"60157": "Jeremy Miller"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2974176.jpg", "usersrated": "0", "rpgitemversion": {"307862": "PF version"}, "average": "0", "statistics": {}, "rpggenre": {"185": "Comedy / Satire"}, "rpgcategory": {"2108": "Sourcebook (rules/options to enhance play)"}, "rpgseries": {"7758": "Genius Guides"}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2974176_t.jpg", "description": "From publisher blurb:<br/><br/>These feats come in two categories.

The sages recognized their mistake, but were hastily locked away by the knights of the Kingdom. With no one left to stop Orono, the Ancient Forces who formed Axios, must now gain back the loyalty of their creation and return harmony to the kingdom.<br/><br/>In Unholy Upheaval players take the role of one of the 4 Ancient Forces of Axios. Using what limited resources they have, players must gain back the loyalty of their creation and take the power back from Orono. Whoever can acquire the most of Orono&rsquo;s fragments will take the place as the dominant force once harmony is returned to Axios.<br/><br/>The playstyle of Unholy Upheaval is deck-building with minor PvP elements. Each player starts with a starter set of 10 cards and 0 fragments. They utilize their starter cards to build a more powerful deck from a common pool of available cards, the Aether.<br/><br/>The playing take turns playing and purchasing cards. Each turn follows the followng structure:<br/>1. Check for any relic effects in your battlefield and perform their actions.<br/>2. Play cards from your hand. Each card will provide either resources (Loyalty, Rage, Fragments)or provide powerful effects. Play Minions to your battlefield face up, and Relics into your opponent&rsquo;s battlefields face up. Resolve all text on each card before playing another card.<br/>3. Use loyalty to acquire Minions and Relics from the Aether. Defeat Shards from the Aether with rage, and gather Fragments from the supply as indicated on each card.<br/>4. Once you have finished acquiring and defeating cards, place all Minion cards played this turn (that are not haunted) face up in your Discard Pile and draw 5 new cards from your deck (if you need to draw a card and cannot, simply shuffle your discard pile to create a new deck.)<br/><br/>Unholy Upheaval ends when the last Fragment is taken from the pool and the round is complete. This way every player has the same number of turns. Players can still earn Fragments after the last one is taken.<br/><br/>Each player counts the Fragments in their pool then adds that to fragment value of the cards in their deck. This number is represented by the fragment symbol in the upper right hand corner of Minions. Relics and Shards do not count towards your score at the end of the game. The player with the most total Fragments is the winner. In case of ties the player with the most relics in their deck is the winner<br/><br/>"}, "197904": {"statistics": {}, "name": "Explosive Runes (Issue 3 - Jan 2007)", "rpgproducer": {"24948": "Jason Duke"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2974280.jpg", "usersrated": "0", "average": "0", "rpgissue": {"35173": "Explosive Runes"}, "rpg": {"243": "Dungeons & Dragons (3.5 Edition)"}, "rpgissueversion": {"307869": "PDF Version"}, "poll": {}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2974280_t.jpg", "description": "Explosive Runes<br/>Issue 3<br/>January 2007<br/><br/>"}, "197905": {"statistics": {}, "name": "Explosive Runes (Issue 4 - May 2007)", "rpgproducer": {"24948": "Jason Duke"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2974285.jpg", "usersrated": "0", "average": "0", "rpgissue": {"35173": "Explosive Runes"}, "rpg": {"243": "Dungeons & Dragons (3.5 Edition)"}, "rpgissueversion": {"307870": "PDF Version"}, "poll": {}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2974285_t.jpg", "description": "Explosive Runes<br/>Issue 4<br/>May 2007<br/><br/>"}, "197906": {"statistics": {}, "name": "Explosive Runes (Issue 5 - Sep 2007)", "rpgproducer": {"24948": "Jason Duke"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2974289.jpg", "usersrated": "0", "average": "0", "rpgissue": {"35173": "Explosive Runes"}, "rpg": {"243": "Dungeons & Dragons (3.5 Edition)"}, "rpgissueversion": {"307871": "PDF Version"}, "poll": {}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2974289_t.jpg", "description": "Explosive Runes<br/>Issue 5<br/>September 2007<br/><br/>"}, "197907": {"statistics": {}, "name": "Explosive Runes (Issue 6 - Jan 2008)", "rpgproducer": {"24948": "Jason Duke"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2974294.jpg", "usersrated": "0", "average": "0", "rpgissue": {"35173": "Explosive Runes"}, "rpg": {"243": "Dungeons & Dragons (3.5 Edition)"}, "rpgissueversion": {"307873": "PDF Version"}, "poll": {}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2974294_t.jpg", "description": "Explosive Runes<br/>Issue 6<br/>January 2008<br/><br/>"}, "197908": {"statistics": {}, "name": "Explosive Runes (Issue 7 - Dec 2009)", "rpgproducer": {"90614": "cyranojoe"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2974300.jpg", "usersrated": "0", "average": "0", "rpgissue": {"35173": "Explosive Runes"}, "rpg": {"190": "Dungeons & Dragons (4th Edition)"}, "rpgissueversion": {"307874": "PDF Version"}, "poll": {}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2974300_t.jpg", "description": "Explosive Runes<br/>Issue 7<br/>December 2009<br/><br/>"}, "197909": {"boardgamedesigner": {"4819": {"name": "Richard Launius"}}, "poll": {}, "name": "Shark Island", "playingtime": "45", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": {"2057": "Chit-Pull System"}, "yearpublished": "2017", "usersrated": "6", "boardgamefamily": {"22184": "Admin: Unreleased Games"}, "maxplayers": "5", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3003216_t.jpg", "average": "7.83333", "statistics": {}, "boardgamepublisher": {"517": {"name": "Upper Deck Entertainment"}}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3003216.jpg", "boardgameversion": {"307875": "English first edition"}, "maxplaytime": "0", "boardgamecategory": {"1022": {"name": "Adventure"}}, "age": "0", "minplaytime": "45", "description": "Shark Island is a semi-cooperative game for 2&ndash;5 players that pits up to four shark hunters against a monstrous great white shark (which is controlled by a player) that is working to terrorize the island.

North, East, South, and West<br/><br/>The first player ( chosen randomly ) will then place a card some where on that 5 x 5 grid. Next they will place a double sided token on the card marking that they own it, with the color of their choosing facing up. They will then draw a card from the deck, signaling the end of their turn.<br/><br/>The next player will then go, doing the same thing.<br/><br/>Players may also rotate the card however they desire to get the optimal outcome.<br/><br/>If a player lays a card next to a card they do not own they can potentially take ownership of it and possibly cards next to that one and so forth!<br/><br/>Using the example below the second player, who is represented by the black token laid their card to the right of one of the first players cards, who is represented by the white token.<br/><br/>The card they laid down has a 7 on the west face of the card. The card to the left of it has a 0 on the east face of the card. Since 7 is greater than 0 the player represented by the black token can gain control of that card,<br/><br/>But wait it doesn't end there! There is also the possibility of chain reaction captures! Lets examine the sample below.<br/><br/>The card with the black token on it was just laid down by the second player, the number facing west is 3, the number on the card beside it that is owned by the first player has a number of 1 on the east side. Since 3 is greater than 1 it captures it.<br/><br/>But it doesn't end there! Since the difference between 3 and 1 is 2 the second player, represented by the black token card capture up to two cards total ( including the initial card captured ) if there are numbers on the next card that are greater than cards it is next too and that the second player doesn't already own. The ending result is as seen below.<br/><br/>Using this mechanic, even if you are woefully behind a single card can potentially bring you back in to the game!<br/><br/>There are many strategic ways to play Onami, but you must be careful to be both defensive and offensive<br/><br/>"}, "197912": {"statistics": {}, "name": "Explosive Runes (Issue 9 - Aug 2010)", "rpgproducer": {"90605": "D.

Players take control of a party of heroes and adventurers on a common quest. The core game is designed to be played in around an hour depending on how large of a party you choose to hire. Before the start of the game, players agree on the amount of gold they will each spend on hiring and equipping their party.<br/><br/>You must first choose a hero to lead your party. Heroes are persons of great renown throughout Carpathia and the rest of the world. They are natural born leaders and usually excel at fighting, magic, or even crafting. Once you have hired your hero you can then recruit the rest of your party, purchase additional equipment for your adventurers, magic spells, or other items. The hero you choose will determine the alignment of your party. There are three alignments in Carpathia, good, neutral and evil. You may have guessed that if you hire a hero of the good alignment, you will not be able to hire adventurers that are evil. Neutral heroes can hire either good, neutral, or evil adventurers; although you cannot have both good and evil in the same party. Each of the 14 available factions in Carpathia is of one of the three alignments. Hiring your party entirely from the same faction gives you small stat bonuses. However, each faction also has a specific style of play. Some factions excel at magic, while others are expert warriors. Some are masters of deceit, while others are master tacticians and strategists. The ability to hire your party from multiple factions gives you the option to customize your play style.<br/><br/>Each character in Carpathia comes with his or her own stats, equipment, spells, and other items. All of this information will be found in the rulebook, as well as all the additional equipment you can purchase. Supplied with the rulebook, you will also receive a blank character sheet. This is what you will use to record your heroes and adventurer&rsquo;s statistics, equipment, spells, items and abilities. Not only will it make it easier to quickly look up character attributes during a game, but will also make it easier to change them, as they can often change during a game, or especially if you are playing a Quest.<br/><br/>Quests in Carpathia are a series of games. During each game your adventurers gain experience, acquire loot, and gatherer resources. However you must be careful because heroes and adventurers can also be hurt or even killed. In between games you will be able to apply gained experience towards new abilities, skills or to increase statistics. You will also be able to attempt to heal any hurt or wounded characters as long as your party possesses the necessary spells or potions required to do so. The loot, whether in the form of gold or items, can be used amongst your party, sold, or even traded to other players. Finally the resources found can also be sold or used to craft weapons, armor, or items if your adventurers possess the required skill sets. Our hope is that these features will add a level of emersion into the world of Carpathia and make the games more rewarding and fun. The Carpathia rulebook will have a number of Quests, but we also encourage players to develop their own.<br/><br/>Those who have played table top war games before will find the core rules of Carpathia familiar, while those new to war gaming should have no problem quickly picking them up. Each player will take their turn, in which he or she can move his or her adventurers, use items, cast spells, engage in combat, or hunt for treasure and resources. The game turn is divided into four Phases. First is The Action Phase, followed by The Movement Phase, then The Combat Phase, and finally The Magic Phase.<br/><br/>During The Action Phase you can activate certain items such as food or magic weapons, attempt to claim resources, or attempt to recover adventurers who have been knocked down or unconscious. During The Movement Phase you may move your adventurers, attempt to climb, jump, swim, or take cover. The Combat Phase is when both shooting and hand-to-hand combat is resolved. Finally The Magic Phase is where characters with any ability in manipulating the winds of magic can attempt to cast their spells. During phases in which you come in direct contact with your opponent, he or she will have the opportunity to retaliate if not otherwise incapacitated. For instance after you charge an enemy adventurer during your combat phase, but fail to either knock down, out, or kill him or her, your opponent will have an opportunity to retaliate with an attack of their own.<br/><br/>Our goal is to make individual games of Carpathia fast paced but also fun and engaging. The Quests are meant to provide further emersion and give players the ability to play out epic stories as they journey across Carpathia in search of honor, glory, treasure, knowledge, power, or the dark energies that inhabit it.<br/><br/>The Carpathia rules are based on a D6 system, and we recommend playing on a 4 foot by 4 foot playing surface.
