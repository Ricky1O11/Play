They are historically based, in that they recreate the military capacities of a given era in the history of warfare, but they are abstract. They do not restrict the player to the circumstances of a given campaign, or to the capacities of actual units, or to the style of an actual leader. Both players are equipped with units whose capacities are equivalent to those of the era in which the game is set. But their forces and situations are abstract and equal, and each player must win or lose according to his own skill and judgment, without the influence of luck or of pre-existing historical conditions. There are no dice or chance outcomes.<br/><br/>Chris's Comments<br/>The game is played on a map divided into equal squares using units to represent Infantry, artillery and Cavalry.  To make the game balanced the map is also symmetric about the line dividing the two sides.  The game is won by either eliminating all field units, or by blocking the roads leading from the opponents city or occupying the opponent city.<br/><br/>"}, "22577": {"boardgamedesigner": {"5689": {"name": "Gyles Brandreth"}}, "poll": {}, "name": "Treasure Island", "playingtime": "60", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": {"2072": "Dice Rolling"}, "yearpublished": "1976", "usersrated": "8", "maxplayers": "6", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic117824_t.jpg", "average": "3.9375", "statistics": {}, "boardgamepublisher": {"288": {"name": "Spear's Games"}}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic117824.jpg", "boardgameversion": {"106162": "First Edition"}, "maxplaytime": "60", "boardgamecategory": {"1093": {"name": "Novel-based"}}, "age": "7", "minplaytime": "60", "description": "Welcome to Treasure Island!<br/>it&rsquo;s on this lonely desert island that Captain Flint one of the boldest buccaneers ever to sail the seven seas, once hid all his treasure.

Each turn a player rolls two dice and moves his pawn according to his roll.<br/><br/>At the start of the game every player pays ten chips to the bank. Whenever a player ends his move on a white dot nothing happens and the next player gets to roll the dice. The red dots are 'special event' dots. These events may be positive or negative for the player. For instance: roll again, get wounded (and move backwards to the hospital) or get killed (and have to start all over again). In most of these cases the player also pays chips to or receives chips from the bank.<br/><br/>The winner is the first player to reach nr. 90; the dot at the heart of the native town.

Through progressive development, different manufacturers can be founded, whose products subsequently can be turned into victory points.

Then the tide of war changed when King Gustav Adolf of Sweden, the &quot;Lion of the North,&quot; revitalized the cause of the Protestant princes of Germany. Bankrolled by France, the Swedes pushed their advantage towards the Emperor's most valuable ally, Maximilian of Bavaria. Though Catholic, France sought to keep the power of the Habsburgs in check by financially supporting the Swedish King.<br/><br/>From 1632 to 1648, Bavaria and the surrounding area became a crucial battlefront to knocking Bavaria out of the war. The Swedes enjoyed success until fate removed their King and their over-extended forces could not hold onto their gains. After the Swedes suffered a sharp defeat at N&ouml;rdlingen in 1634, France was forced to play a more active role or lose all she had paid for. A series of seesaw campaigns ensued as the French Arm&eacute;e d'Allemagne secured crossings of the Rhine and pushed the war back into the heart of Bavaria. The area became the proving ground of the greatest generals of the age - Turenne, Cond&eacute;, Mercy, de Werth. Neither side possessed a clear superiority of forces so it was a dangerous game of cat-and-mouse, march, counter-march, siege, and surprise attacks. After several years, a combined French-Swedish campaign finally broke the back of the Bavarians in 1646 and Maximilian made a separate peace. It did not last long; after a year he reluctantly rejoined the Imperial cause. Repeating the winning combination of 1646, the French-Swedish army ended Maximilian's enterprise at Zusmarshausen in 1648.<br/><br/><br/>The Game:<br/><br/>Won by the Sword is the first game in Ben Hull's Great Campaigns of the Thirty Years War series. It is a two-player game of operational warfare in the 17th Century. Armies maneuver on a point to point map of Southern Germany based on the road network available at the time. Each game is centered around a major battle or full campaign season. A Turn is a month divided into a variable number of impulses. Each army has a hand of Campaign Cards that control the amount of activity it may perform, the supplies it must expend, and a special action. Each impulse features one card play per army. Forces are concealed off map so players are faced with limited knowledge of the enemy. The major activities are maneuver, foraging, besieging fortifications, and an occasional battle. Won by the Sword is a low-complexity game with emphasis on the players maneuvering their forces, but many decisions await. The low rules complexity allows each player, rather than being encumbered with rules, to focus on choices regarding how to manage his campaign.<br/><br/>Battle Games:<br/><br/>    N&ouml;rdlingen 1634<br/>    Tuttlingen 1643<br/>    Freiburg 1644<br/>    Mergentheim 1645<br/>    Alerheim 1645<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Full Campaigns:<br/><br/>    1632 - The Lion of the North Goes South - Gustav Adolf's Campaign against Bavaria<br/>    1634 - Swedes are pushed out of the South<br/>    1638 - Weimar's Triumph - Duke Bernhard of Saxe-Weimar leads his German corps in French service to turn the tide of the war in the South<br/>    1644 - French battle to secure the Breisgau and Baden, Bavarians defend masterfully<br/>    1645 - Struggle for W&uuml;rttemburg - French and Bavrians fight a seesaw battle for control of W&uuml;rttemburg and N&ouml;rdlingen area<br/>    1646 - Turenne's Triumph - French and Swedes launch a joint campaign to bring Bavaria to her knees<br/>    1648 - The Bitter End - Zusmarshausen, again a combined French - Swedish force strikes into the heart of a resurgent Bavaria<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>TIME SCALE: 5 to 7 days per Turn <br/>MAP SCALE: Point to Point<br/>UNIT SCALE: <br/><br/>    Infantry Regiments = 800-1000 men<br/>    Cavalry Regiments = 400-500 men<br/>    Detachments = 200-300 men<br/>    Artillery Units = 8-10 guns<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>COMPONENTS:<br/>    One 34&quot;x22&quot; map<br/>    Four countersheets<br/>    One deck of 55 cards<br/>    One Rules Booklet<br/>    One Campaign Booklet<br/>    One 8.5&quot;x11&quot; Battle Board<br/>    Two 8.5&quot;x11&quot; Player Force Cards<br/>    Two 11&quot;x17&quot; Player Aid Cards<br/>    One 10-sided die<br/><br/><br/>DESIGNER: Ben Hull<br/>DEVELOPER: Stephen Brasseur<br/>MAP ART: Knut Gr&uuml;nitz<br/>COUNTER &amp; CARD ART: Mark Simonitch, Charlie Kibler, and Rodger B.

Thirteen of these were sold in three boxed sets containing six boards each: a &quot;Family Assortment,&quot; &quot;Children's Assortment,&quot; and &quot;Adult Assortment&quot; (with overlap between the sets). Seven more boards were listed on the side of the boxed sets as &quot;Individual Games&quot; and were presumably sold separately. The rulebook provided with the boxed sets contained rules for all thirteen games in the assortments plus a fourteenth game, Five in a Row, which was played directly on the plastic grid.<br/><br/>The Avalon Hill edition of the game was sold in boxed sets which each had a random set of six games; it is not clear how many of the MBC Nome games were re-used.<br/><br/>"}, "22624": {"boardgamedesigner": {"3": {"name": "(Uncredited)"}}, "poll": {}, "name": "V\u00e4ripeli", "playingtime": "10", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": {"2047": "Memory"}, "yearpublished": "0", "usersrated": "0", "maxplayers": "2", "average": "0", "statistics": {}, "boardgamepublisher": {"5249": {"name": "Jukka-tuote"}}, "maxplaytime": "10", "boardgamecategory": {"1041": {"name": "Children's Game"}}, "age": "3", "minplaytime": "10", "description": "An educational game to teach colors and train memorizing skills for small children.

The game probably comes from the middle ages. It has been mentioned in the game books by R. C. Bell, Jack Botermans / Pieter van Delft and Glonnegger.<br/><br/>The game is played on a board of ten by ten squares. The four corners of four by four squares are distinguished by a line, thus shaping a cross two lines wide, consisting of the  rows 5 and 6 and/or the columns e and f. These lines are called deflection lines.<br/>Each player has eight Kampas (pawns), five Horsas and Kornas and two Galas (kings), placed like this:<br/>White:<br/>Gala a1, j1; Korna a3, b2, c1, i1, j2; Horsa a2, b1, h1, i2, j3; Kampa a4, b3, c2, d1, g1, h2, i3, j4. <br/>Black:<br/>Gala a10, j10; Korna a9, b10, h10, i9, j8; Horsa a8, b9, c10, i10, j9; Kampa a7, b8, c9, d10, g10, h9, i8, j7.<br/><br/>Galas move in general as kings in chess. Additionally, when a Gala is on one of the four squares in the middle of the board, it may be moved in one move to any empty square on the board with the exception of those squares that contain a piece in the opening setup. Kings can only take when moving over a deflection line. <br/>A Korna moves as a rook in chess when in a corner of the board, and as a bishop in the middle of the board. It is also possible to combine these moves in one turn! Kornas can only take in moves where they move over a deflection line. <br/>Horsas are just the opposite of Kornas (with an additional small difference in the taking rules): they move as bishops on the corner parts, and as rooks on the middle part. Again it is possible to combine such moves. Horsas only take in moves where they pass the deflection line, but not when they move only one square in rookwise fashion.<br/>Kampas move diagonally towards the middle of the board until they are in the middle part or in the opponents corners. It is allowed to move two squares if the deflection line isn't passed with the first move of the Kampa. When the Kampa is in the middle part or in one of the opponents corners, then it may move one square in any direction. When a Kampa is moved back to a corner of the owning player, it can only move diagonally forward again. Kampas only can take in the move after they have crossed a deflection line.<br/><br/>When a player threatens a king of the opponent, he says: Gala! The opponent must defend the king, if possible. Otherwise, the player takes the king of the opponent. One wins the game by taking both kings of the opponent. <br/>When only two kings of different players are left on the board, the game is a draw.<br/><br/>There are different variants discussed in the internet concerning the moves and the winning (defining another goal in placing the Galas in the 4 squares in the very middle of the board).<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "name": "Gala", "playingtime": "60", "boardgamemechanic": {"2676": "Grid Movement"}, "average": "7.5", "usersrated": "2", "boardgamesubdomain": {"4666": "Abstract Games"}, "boardgamefamily": {"4024": "Chess Games"}}, "22626": {"boardgamedesigner": {"6812": {"name": "Mat Johnstone"}}, "poll": {}, "name": "The Book of Pop-Up Board Games", "playingtime": "30", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": {"2035": "Roll / Spin and Move"}, "yearpublished": "1996", "usersrated": "2", "maxplayers": "4", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic855039_t.jpg", "average": "4", "statistics": {}, "boardgamepublisher": {"5250": {"name": "Shooting Star Press Inc."}}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic855039.jpg", "maxplaytime": "30", "boardgamecategory": {"1041": {"name": "Children's Game"}}, "age": "0", "minplaytime": "30", "description": "There are four pop-up board games in this book.

Video Adventure in Bird Identification is a niche boardgame directed at the birdwatching/birding community that combines board game action with real-world bird identification skills.  It includes:<br/><br/><br/>      A two-hour video containing 10 separate games<br/>      18&quot; x 24&quot; fold-out gameboard map of North America with 100 different renowned locations for birdwatching marked on it (National Parks, Wildlife Refuges, etc.)<br/>      51 &quot;Hotspot&quot; cards that match up with the map and describe the location along with a list of several different bird species that can be found there<br/>     48 &quot;Surprise&quot; cards that describe a variety of seasonal events such as a cold front pushing migrating birds in great numbers to a location or other unpredictable events that effect how many birds you might spy, like winning an expensive new spotting telescope.  <br/>     18 &quot;Rare Bird Alert&quot; cards that send you off to a different corner of the map chasing after an especially unusual sighting of a bird species<br/>     1 Novice Helper Card<br/>     40-page Identification Guide -- instructions and answers to each of the 10 different games on the VHS tape<br/>     Trip List Pad  <br/>     Video Trip Field Notes Pad<br/>     6 glass playing pieces<br/><br/><br/>There are three different skill levels accommodated by the game: &quot;novice&quot; where, for example, just identifying a bird as a &quot;hawk&quot; is an acceptable answer, &quot;birder&quot; where you must get the exact species named like &quot;Red-tailed Hawk&quot; and &quot;Expert&quot; who must provide not only the species name but also the Latin scientific genera &quot;Red-tailed Hawk, Buteo.&quot;  This lets people of all ages and bird identification abilities play together.<br/><br/>To play the game, 6 Hotspot cards and 1 Rare-Bird Alert cards are dealt to each player.  The group must decide which season in which to play the game as different seasons produce different numbers of birds at the various Hotspots.    Then each player must plan out her route on the gameboard to visit the 6 Hotspots in their hand.  Players start at the Hotspot closest to their actual real-world location.  Then players watch the first Video Trip.  The video is paused between trips while the players write down their identifications of the 10-12 different species shown on their Video Trip Field Notes pad, in order of the bird's appearance.  Video &quot;hosts&quot; tell you where in the country you are and what season it is before the trips begin, which helps skilled players pare down the possible choices of species.  The video can be replayed if players need more time to work on their IDs.  After everyone is satisfied with their identifications, they read them aloud and one player checks the IDs with the answer section of the instruction booklet.  Players get a point for each correct ID they make.    Then, taking turns clockwise, players move their tokens around the board one Hotspot space at a time and announce the number of species they can add to their Trip List as determined by the card's &quot;species table,&quot; which varies according to season.  If you end up having to visit the same Hotspot more than once in order to get to another Hotspot card, you'll receive a smaller number of points for each successive trip.<br/><br/>At the end of each round, a Surprise card is drawn and read aloud.  It may affect all, some or none of the players.  You can also play a Rare-Bird-Alert card against one of your opponents to send them off their planned course chasing after the bird listed on the card.<br/><br/>The game ends after six Video Trips and six rounds on the gameboard are played.  Points on players Trip Lists are then tallied and the player with the most number of species on their Trip List wins.<br/><br/>As a final note, bird taxonomy and nomenclature are constantly changing as scientists learn more about avian species.  This game specifies that their answers are based on the 1983 American Ornithologists' Union &quot;Check-List of North American Birds&quot; which is of course now, in the year 2006, significantly out of date.<br/><br/>"}, "22655": {"boardgamedesigner": {"233": {"name": "Johann R\u00fcttinger"}}, "poll": {}, "name": "Das verr\u00fcckte Lexikon-Spiel", "playingtime": "30", "minplayers": "3", "boardgamemechanic": {"2014": "Betting/Wagering"}, "yearpublished": "1989", "usersrated": "9", "boardgamefamily": {"1539": "Dictionary Games"}, "maxplayers": "8", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic119150_t.jpg", "average": "6.66667", "statistics": {}, "boardgamepublisher": {"304": {"name": "Noris Spiele"}}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic119150.jpg", "boardgameversion": {"129470": "Noris Spiele Edition 1989"}, "maxplaytime": "30", "boardgamecategory": {"1023": {"name": "Bluffing"}}, "age": "0", "minplaytime": "30", "description": "Game objective is to lexicon-style define an unknown word as credible and originally as possible.

The scorekeeper will enter this as 7 or 8 pins for the first roll. (The SPLIT is counted as six pins plus the 1 or 2 other pins).

Some of these future wars seemed inevitable, particularly that with Japan. Others depended on changes in current politics, but Navy planners wanted to be prepared just in case.<br/><br/>One of these plans, labeled &ldquo;Gold,&rdquo; studied a potential naval war with France. The United States had stood alongside its &ldquo;oldest ally&rdquo; during the First World War, but in the years immediately afterwards the Navy looked at the potential for radical politicians to change France from friend to foe. Also, the peace negotiations which followed the war revealed deep underlying tensions between the Americans and their European allies; some of the more paranoid came to believe the next war would be between Europe and America.<br/><br/>U.S. Navy Plan Gold is based on these plans. American officers believed the seat of conflict would be the same as that of the undeclared naval war against France in the 1790s: the Caribbean Basin.<br/><br/>U.S. Navy Plan Gold includes the ships projected by the Armee Navale but never built due to the Washington Naval Treaty: the large Gilles and Durand-Viel battle cruisers, Normandie and Lyon class battleships, and the very odd &ldquo;croiseur de combat&rdquo; battleship/carrier design.

The other player is not allowed to slide a just-moved tile back to where it came from, thus preventing game lock up.<br/><br/>If you get 3 in a row, you win the round and the first player to win 6 rounds wins the game.<br/><br/>"}, "22798": {"boardgamedesigner": {"3": {"name": "(Uncredited)"}}, "poll": {}, "name": "Pit Fighting Were-Critters", "playingtime": "0", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": {"2018": "Campaign / Battle Card Driven"}, "yearpublished": "0", "usersrated": "1", "boardgamefamily": {"6925": "Fantasy Sports"}, "maxplayers": "2", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1469219_t.jpg", "average": "1", "statistics": {}, "boardgamepublisher": {"3641": {"name": "Iron Wind Metals"}}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1469219.jpg", "maxplaytime": "0", "boardgamecategory": {"1002": {"name": "Card Game"}}, "age": "10", "minplaytime": "0", "description": "Battle for supremacy of the pit.<br/><br/>Use the &quot;Vulgar Were-Bunny&quot;, or the &quot;Malicious Were-Monkey&quot; and whatever else you find, such as the human meat missiles.<br/><br/>Implementing the Combat Card System, Pit Fighting Were-Critters comes {complete} with four pewter miniatures (two were-critters and two human meat-missiles), rules, and combat cards.<br/><br/>Sold as a boxed game (not as individual components).<br/><br/>"}, "22799": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic120148.jpg", "poll": {}, "boardgamedesigner": {"6876": {"name": "Zbyn\u011bk Vr\u00e1na"}}, "statistics": {}, "yearpublished": "2005", "maxplayers": "2", "boardgameartist": {"28450": "Tom\u00e1\u0161 Ku\u010derovsk\u00fd"}, "boardgamepublisher": {"1876": {"name": "Altar Games"}}, "maxplaytime": "15", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic120148_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "15", "boardgamecategory": {"1009": {"name": "Abstract Strategy"}}, "description": "Game goal is to place all personal pieces on the board first. <br/>Pieces have special abilities like better attack, attack on long range, better resistance, etc. Only the last placed piece has effect on board situation.<br/>With good piece placement you should be able to exile enemy's pieces, but beware, they can be right back and exile more your pieces.<br/>To avoid cycling, there is also one neutral piece which is placed on the place of the last exiled piece.<br/><br/>Additional rules include terrain effects and some scenarios.<br/><br/>Legie is registered by IAGO.<br/><br/>Legie can be played online at SmartBlue.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": {"25455": "Altar First Edition"}, "name": "Legie", "playingtime": "15", "boardgamemechanic": {"2043": "Area Enclosure"}, "average": "5.53542", "usersrated": "96", "boardgamesubdomain": {"4666": "Abstract Games"}, "age": "10"}, "22800": {"boardgamedesigner": {"3": {"name": "(Uncredited)"}}, "poll": {}, "name": "TriQuest!", "playingtime": "0", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": {"2014": "Betting/Wagering"}, "yearpublished": "2006", "usersrated": "6", "boardgamefamily": {"5730": "Sports: Horse Racing"}, "maxplayers": "6", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic164110_t.jpg", "average": "4.66667", "statistics": {}, "boardgamepublisher": {"5313": {"name": "Deep Creek Enterprises"}}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic164110.jpg", "maxplaytime": "0", "boardgamecategory": {"1072": {"name": "Electronic"}}, "age": "0", "minplaytime": "0", "description": "A game based on horse racing.

The combination is inverted so that the mountain then rests on its base and the plastic cone is carefully lifted off, leaving the mountain evenly covered with a variety of solid colored marbles.<br/>     A set (I think there were 6 of these but am not positive; it might have been 4) of black cardboard playing fields cut into the profile of a mountain.  Approximately a dozen circular depressions are cut into each playing field, and these have a random distribution of colors matching the marble colors painted on them.<br/>     Several sets of oversized, blue plastic tweezers with blunt tips.<br/><br/><br/>The object of the game is to be the player who fills the most circles on his playing field by picking the appropriate color marbles off of the plastic mountain with the tweezers and setting them into the matching circles on his board, without causing an avalanche of marbles to cascade down the sides of the plastic mountain, and also without knocking any marbles out of their depressions on his playing field.  The first child to cause an avalanche or knock over her marbles loses.  In the event that none of the players create an avalanche or knock off marbles, then the first player to fill up all of the circles on her board wins.<br/><br/>Players must start at the base of their own mountain playing field and fill in the entire bottom row with marbles before ascending to the next row up.  Since each playing field has a unique distribution of colors, players will need different colors of marbles at different points in the game.  This means a layer of strategy can be added by trying to remove not only the color of marble you need next, but by selecting a specific marble of that color from the marble mountain that leaves your opponent with more difficult and avalanche-prone choices.<br/><br/>"}, "22818": {"boardgamedesigner": {"3": {"name": "(Uncredited)"}}, "poll": {}, "name": "Tock 6", "playingtime": "60", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": {"2041": "Card Drafting"}, "yearpublished": "0", "usersrated": "8", "boardgamefamily": {"4214": "Pachisi-Ludo"}, "maxplayers": "6", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic202622_t.jpg", "average": "6.4", "statistics": {}, "boardgamepublisher": {"3469": {"name": "\u00c9ditions Gladius International, Inc."}}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic202622.jpg", "maxplaytime": "60", "boardgamecategory": {"1002": {"name": "Card Game"}}, "age": "0", "minplaytime": "60", "description": "This game is a variant of six-player Pachisi.

You lay it down flat on its side on the table. On the top side are six spaces, each labeled both 1-6 and with a color. Space number two is the hole.<br/><br/>Apart from the &quot;bank&quot; itself, the game comes with two six-sided dice (one regular and one with colors matching the spaces on the box) and a number of yellow marbles (about 25).<br/><br/>To play, divide the marbles evenly to all players and put any remainders into the bank.

An exciting card driven combat system allows players to modify and upgrade their faction with a wealth of powerful technologies. Players can unleash a Zergling rush, use powerful Protoss shields to halt an enemy invasion, or even send cloaked Ghosts out to guide nuclear missiles to their target.<br/><br/>Description<br/><br/>In StarCraft: The Board Game, players battle for galactic domination on a dynamic board of interconnected planets. Planetary setup is already part of the game - every player gets two planets to place, and will place their starting base on one of them. Planets are connected with direct and &quot;Z-Axis&quot; connections that are placed during setup, but can sometimes later be modified during the game, and movement is only possible within planets and through those connections (by means of purpose-built transports).<br/><br/>Each player controls a faction out of six, that belongs to one race out of three - Humans, Zerg, and Protoss. Each faction has a unique special victory condition, but all factions can also win through victory points that are gained by controlling special areas on some of the planets. Players build units and base upgrades with the resources they gather from the planetary areas that they control, and gain access to additional unit types through those upgrades.<br/><br/>Each turn is subdivided into first a planning phase, then an execution phase, and finally a regrouping phase (used for cleanup). In the planning phase, players take turns playing a number of order tokens into stacks on each planet, with orders placed later obstructing the ones that were placed before them. This allows players to set up combos of their own, but also to obstruct plans of other players. In the execution phase then, players take turns again, and when a player's turn comes up he can choose one of his order tokens on top of any stack and execute that one - if all of their orders are obstructed, they skip their action and draw an event card instead. The execution phase isn't over until all players executed all of their orders. Possible orders are Build (used for building both units and buildings), Mobilize (used for moving units and attacking enemies) and Research (see below), and orders can always be Standard Orders or Special Orders, with the special orders having prerequisites but stronger effects.<br/><br/>Players can also research new technologies and thus improve their combat deck in a precursor to more recent deck building mechanisms. Each player is given a combat deck unique for their race at the start of the game, and when they research new technologies then matching cards are added to that deck. This allows the players to customize what cards they will draw; when the last card of the deck is drawn, the deck is reshuffled. Most cards remain in the combat deck once researched, though some researched technologies add effects that are always in play, while some particularly strong combat cards are discarded after one use.<br/><br/>&quot;Reimplements&quot;<br/><br/>     StarCraft (video game)<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": {"25046": "English Edition"}, "average": "7.34195", "name": "StarCraft: The Board Game", "playingtime": "240", "boardgamemechanic": {"2080": "Area Control / Area Influence"}, "age": "12", "boardgameexpansion": {}, "usersrated": "6117", "boardgamesubdomain": {"5497": "Strategy Games"}, "boardgamefamily": {"25158": "Components: Miniatures"}}, "22828": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic120439.jpg", "poll": {}, "boardgamedesigner": {"3": {"name": "(Uncredited)"}}, "statistics": {}, "yearpublished": "2004", "maxplayers": "5", "boardgamepublisher": {"725": {"name": "Xeno Games"}}, "maxplaytime": "180", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic120439_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "180", "boardgamecategory": {"1042": {"name": "Expansion for Base-game"}}, "description": "An expansion for Xeno's The World at War.

For the next four years, Allied task forces engaged elements of the Imperial Japanese fleet throughout the ocean. Marines and army units began their program of island-hopping, wresting from the Japanese the empire that they had expanded in every direction.<br/><br/>War in the Pacific is a multi-level simulation of the Pacific theater of operations during World War II. The game enables players to recreate the entire course of the war, form the opening Japanese attack on 7 December, 1941 to the climatic Allied assaults in the closing days of 1945. Representing some 30% of the globe, the strategic maps let players move and engage in combat on all levels: air, ground and naval. War in the Pacific is not a simple game; there are a number of rules and concepts that will, at first, be unfamiliar to a majority of players. But playing through smaller map sections and scenarios enables the player to become familiar with the mechanics of the game.<br/><br/>This is a reprint edition which substantially expanded the original's components.  Components: 7 full size (22 x 34&quot;) strategic maps in full color, new tactical maps with nearly 338 individual islands for new ground units to fight over, 32 die-cut counter sheets, nearly 9,000 counters showing all types of units from the Pacific Theater, rule books, chart books and assorted displays and player aid charts<br/><br/>The rules have undergone significant change with greatly increased emphasis on detail  in combat while removing the detailed logistics system that was the focus of the old game and replacing it with a command point system modeled after Victory Games' &quot;Pacific War.&quot;<br/><br/>The order of battle is significantly more detailed. Leaders on many levels (and whose combat performance may be unpredictable), often serve to limit players' ability to affect the outcome of every battle to the Nth degree. A player's assignment of the right task force commander (for the right force at the right time), may spell the difference between a tactical victory and defeat.<br/><br/>The ground combat system has been completely revised, substituting a step-loss system adapted from VG's &quot;Pacific War.&quot; Pitched battles on islands and atolls are now resolved, including maneuver, on expanded tactical maps in six different scales, rather than simply being abstractly represented in a single hex on the strategic maps.<br/><br/>War in the Pacific's original air and naval systems are retained, in their essence, albeit with substantial modifications and above all added chrome in combat.

To do this, you are employing the best animators (as well as the cheapest) you can find.  These animators churn out image after image, but with one problem.  They don't have a script!  Luckily the inventors working (slaving) for you have developed the first and only Anime Plotting Device(TM).<br/><br/>As the characters of your various anime are added to your highly advanced, computerized environment, they appear in a fully constructed three-dimensional holographic matrix, awaiting your every whim!

Your competitors waste no time in retaliating.  Soon, a malfunction in the Anime Plotting Device(TM) leads to a startling discovery:  the anime has become tangible, physical.  The anime is real!<br/><br/>Desperately, both you and your competitors hire insanely overpriced engineers to fix the problem.  The characters themselves, luckily, do not realize that they are real, and continue to do your bidding.  They still appear in the matrix as normal - through the scanning of the animators drawings.  They just do real property damage now.  Your competitors, never to be out done, do the same.  In a fit of desperation, you find yourself forced to bring occasional live humans into the unstable matrix to help, fight, and eventually to die.  They die only because, once something has entered the matrix, it's in there until it's dead.  Your best director found this out a little late for your liking.

Players must decide how best to play their cards. For instance, cards can be played individually, in pairs, two pair, three-of-a-kind, or five-card poker-style 'Power Hands'. Much like a football coach deciding what play to call, or the quarterback choosing his best option, players must decide whether to play strong card(s) immediately, or to hold back in hopes of using it to put together a stronger hand.<br/><br/>Other elements of Card Football include team and player chips, game board, a score board, a referee/yard marker and dice that are used for fumble, field goal and injury situations.<br/><br/>Card Football allows for one, two, three and four-player modes. The single-player game mode is set up so that an individual can take on 'the system' and pick up the basics of the game before challenging friends in an all-out gridiron battle. In addition, the learning curve with Card Football is remarkably low. Typically, the game is learned in two to five minutes, or after a few series of downs.<br/><br/>If it happens on the field, you'll find it in Card Football.

This gambling game consists of three dice with six different pictures on their sides and a paper board marked with the same six pictures for stakes to be placed on them. This board could be self-drawn but you can get printed boards together with the dice nowadays.<br/><br/>The name, Hoo Hey How, is derived from the Hokkien names of three of the things that usually appear on the dice = a fish (Hoo), a prawn (Hey) and a king crab (How). However, modern dice tend to show ordinary crabs.<br/><br/>Dobree, in the 1950s, described the objects commonly depicted on the dice: a fish, a prawn, a king crab, a flower, a butterfly, a beautiful lady. But he also noted that other pictures could also appear: a cat, a mouse, a cock, a centipede, a tiger, an elephant, a gourd, three coins (Chinese cash).<br/><br/>Today, the dice tend to show more standard pictures and the selection of pictures is standardized for the region where they originate too. For example, the dice in Malaysia and Singapore (and I assume Hong Kong, where many of them are made) depict a fish, a prawn, a crab, a Chinese coin, a gourd and a cockerel. Thai Hoo Hey How dice (called Nam Tou Bu Bak [please excuse my bad transliteration]) have a tiger instead of a coin, as do dice from the Malaysian state of Sabah, but the Sabah dice show the head of the tiger rather than the whole animal. In Vietnam, they are called Bau Cua Ca Cop and often played at the new year: the distinguishing feature is a stag instead of a coin. Another feature is that the dice may be made of cardboard.<br/><br/>Many variants are possible, some that do not even feature the Hoo, Hey or How, so I don't know what they would be called. From Penang in Malaysia, I have dice that feature an elephant, a rabbit, a butterfly, a snake, a centipede and a flower. In Singapore, some older dice I have feature mahjong dragons together with symbols of political parties from the 1950s.<br/><br/>To play, one player takes the role of banker and the others are punters. Players stake money on the betting board and the dice are cast (either under cover or into a porcelain bowl). Punters are paid an equivalent amount that they staked, the number of times their picture appears on the dice (e.g. if someone bet on the fish and it appears twice, the punter gets back twice their stake).<br/><br/>This game is similar to The Game of Crown and Anchor.<br/><br/>"}, "22504": {"boardgamedesigner": {"3": {"name": "(Uncredited)"}}, "poll": {}, "name": "Zhuang Yuan Chou", "playingtime": "0", "minplayers": "3", "boardgamemechanic": {"2072": "Dice Rolling"}, "yearpublished": "1800", "usersrated": "1", "maxplayers": "8", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic117271_t.jpg", "average": "6", "statistics": {}, "boardgamepublisher": {"171": {"name": "(Public Domain)"}}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic117271.jpg", "boardgameversion": {"204202": "First edition"}, "maxplaytime": "0", "boardgamecategory": {"1017": {"name": "Dice"}}, "age": "12", "minplaytime": "0", "description": "Zhuang Yuan Chou (Chong Yuen Chow in Cantonese) is a gambling game using dice and tallies, first mentioned in Chinese texts in the late 18th century, but still played today.<br/><br/>'Zhuang Yuan' is the title given to the scholar who achieved the highest distinction in the imperial examinations that determined entry into the Chinese bureaucracy.<br/><br/>The game consists of six dice and sixty-three tallies bearing titles of ranks of achievement in the examinations and the number of points they are worth. There is only one each of the top 3 positions, of which the highest value (32 points) and the largest tally is the Zhuan Yuan. <br/>The lower the position, the thinner/shorter the tallies and the fewer points each is worth. At the lowest rank, Xiu Cai, there are 32 tallies worth 1 point each. As with many Chinese dice games, a porcelain bowl is often used to hold and roll the dice.<br/><br/>To play, punters agree on a value per point (Dobree mentions 1 cent, 10 cents or 50 cents). Each player takes turns rolling all six dice. According to the roll, the player is allowed to claim tallies of equivalent worth from the center of the table where they are initially placed. Certain rolls allow one to claim tallies from other players if those tallies were previously claimed. The game is played until all tallies have been claimed.<br/><br/>The best roll is six of a kind, allowing the player to claim all the tallies, whether they are in the pool or with other players. Five of a kind allows the player to claim the Zhuan Yuan tally wherever it is. Red fours (on Chinese dice, the one and four spots are red) are also good to roll - four of them will also get you the Zhuan Yuan tally. Dobree and Culin have both described the game including the values of the rolls.<br/><br/>In the past, tallies were made of bone and hand-engraved.
