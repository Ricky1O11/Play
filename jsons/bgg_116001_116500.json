Standard board size has 61 hexagon spaces measuring 1.25 inch across arranged in a hexagon shape, with each side of the board the length of five hexagon spaces and the middle of the board being nine hexagon spaces wide if measured between any two opposite corners. Non standard boards may be used, as long as the shape is a true hexagon.<br/><br/>Pieces: 100 coins with distinctive heads and tails markings. Standard coins are the same size and weight as US pennies, with each face painted a distinctive color. <br/>Coins may also be used in place of standard game coins.<br/><br/>Objective: to control the most spaces on the hexagonal board.<br/><br/>Rules:<br/>1. For two players. Players alternate turns. Each player chooses a color or coin face On a player's turn, he may do one of the following:<br/><br/>A: place a coin on any space on the hexagon spaces on the board, with his own color or his own face up.<br/><br/>B: touch a coin that is already on the board. see &quot;touching a coin&quot;<br/><br/>C: Flip a coin of his opponents over to his own color(or face). see &quot;flipping a coin&quot;<br/><br/>D: make a castle. see &quot;making a castle&quot;.<br/><br/>2. The last coin that has been put on the board, flipped, or touched cannot be flipped. It is &quot;safe&quot; until another coin has been put on the board, touched or flipped.<br/><br/>3. The game ends when all spaces on the board are filled. Count up the number of spaces each player controls. The player who controls the most spaces wins.<br/><br/>TOUCHING A COIN<br/>On your turn, if you choose, you may touch a coin with your finger. That coin cannot be flipped until another coin has been touched, flipped, or put on the board. Use this to defend a coin for one turn.<br/><br/>FLIPPING A COIN<br/>A coin of an opponents color may be flipped to your color if These criteria are met:<br/>A: You have two coins of your color/face on hexagonal spaces adjoining the coin you want to flip<br/>B: The coin is not &quot;safe&quot;(has been put on the board, flipped, or touched on the opponent's most recent turn.<br/>C: The coin is not part of a castle.<br/><br/>MAKING A CASTLE:<br/>If there are three coins of your color on adjoining spaces arranged in a triangle, you can place a coin on top of those three to make a castle*. Now these coins cannot be flipped for the entire game. A coin can be part of more than one castle, as long as the coin making the castle is placed on top of three coins on the board.<br/><br/>    Note that only one coin may be flipped or placed per turn. A castle will take a minimum of 4 turns to build. <br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>"}, "116004": {"statistics": {}, "name": "Bleach: Blade Battlers", "videogamemode": {"2149": "Single-Player"}, "videogameversion": {"143457": "Japanese PS2 edition"}, "average": "0", "videogametheme": {"2278": "Anime"}, "videogamegenre": {"2159": "Fighting"}, "videogamefranchise": {"5284": "Bleach"}, "videogameplatform": {"4434": "PlayStation 2"}, "usersrated": "0", "poll": {}, "description": "Bleach: Blade Battlers (\uff22\uff2c\uff25\uff21\uff23\uff28\u3000\uff5e\u30d6\u30ec\u30a4\u30c9\u30fb\u30d0\u30c8\u30e9\u30fc\u30ba\uff5e) is a fighting game released only in Japan on the manga and anime Bleach by Tite Kubo.

Players can use their characters' special abilities taken from the series, such as Ichigo Kurosaki's ability to unlock his bankai state or Rukia Kuchiki's control over ice with her zanpakut\u014d. Some of these abilities may alter the arena, such as Rukia's zanpakut\u014d causing the battlefield to become covered in ice and making other players slide around.<br/><br/>The game features extensive battle modes, where you unlock characters after beating all of the challenges.

It has been home to the mages for more than three centuries and their magic has had a great impact on the city itself. Their towers rise above even the great trees of Ossindrillon, overlooking the vast realm that surrounds the city.<br/><br/>People of the City of Mages accept magic and try to use it to their advantage. They understand fully that, used correctly, magic can be one of life's many luxuries. It is a rare thing to find a person with Mor Aldenn who fears magic and the mages.<br/><br/>CITY OVERVIEW<br/><br/>Mor Aldenn, City of Mages, the Tower City, sits on an island at the juncture of two rivers. The city began as a small human and elven settlement but soon grew to the size it is today. A literal crossroads where merchant ships bound for the Great Ocean embark, and highways lead to the Old Kingdoms, the upstart principality of Calathia, and the shining city of the elves, Ossindil.<br/><br/>Visitors must enter the city from one of the docks or from across the single bridge leading to the mainland on the island's northeast side. This arrangement has served the city well, making it difficult for the Night Hag's minions to assault the city without plenty of warning.<br/><br/>A new visitor probably remarks on the prevalence of magic in the city. Lamp posts with continual flame spells line several main streets, and shops and homes also often bear such lights at their doorways, making the city relatively well-lit at night. It is not uncommon to see a wizard or sorcerer borne along through the air on a carpet of flying or traveling the streets atop a palanquin balanced on the shoulders of a demon servant. If asked, citizens can direct the visitor to one of the two locations where the city rulers have installed decanters of endless water to ensure a supply of fresh water for the populace. Shops which deal in magic items, spellcasting, alchemy and other arcane services are much more common in Mor Aldenn than in other similar-sized settlements. Then, of course, there are the wondrous towers of magic, for which Mor Aldenn is most famous.<br/><br/>This Setting Guide also includes a short introductory adventure by none other than the amazing Ron Lundeen!<br/><br/>"}, "116078": {"rpg": {"2791": "Pathfinder System Compatible Product"}, "statistics": {}, "name": "The Clockworker", "rpgproducer": {"31238": "Axel Carlsson"}, "usersrated": "0", "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1946428.jpg", "rpgitemversion": {"143592": "PDF Version"}, "rpgsetting": {"10439": "Mor Aldenn"}, "average": "0", "rpggenre": {"155": "Fantasy (High Fantasy)"}, "rpgcategory": {"2108": "Sourcebook (rules/options to enhance play)"}, "poll": {}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1946428_t.jpg", "description": "Publisher's blurb:<br/><br/>- A New PFRPG Base Class<br/><br/>The art ofclockwork has been around for a long time, artisans creating complex timepieces and locks with elegant machinery.

Battle mode (the standard Bomberman game), is joined by tennis, golf and baseball games. At the center of all this is the Living mode, a character building feature in which the player can design a Bomberman for use in any of the battle modes.<br/><br/>Battle Mode is the centerpiece of this and all other Bomberman games. This mode is essentially the standard Bomberman formula; in the game, players navigate grid-based mazes, planting bombs in an attempt to hit other players (while avoided being hit by a bomb themselves). There are several different variations of Battle Mode, although they all center around the standard Bomberman gameplay.<br/><br/>Classic Battle: A standard deathmatch-type game.<br/>    Star Battle: Collect the most stars.<br/>    Crown Battle: Find the crown in the level to win the game.<br/>    Point Battle: Earn the most points by killing opponents<br/>    Replay: Watched game sessions saved to memory card.<br/><br/>Baseball has two modes: a single-match mode (exhibition) and a pennant race in which the player takes part in a league match of thirty games against five CPU teams. Aiming is automatic, causing most of the gameplay to revolve around well-timed button presses (baserunning is also automatic; fielding can even be set to be automatic).<br/><br/>Golf can either be played in exhibition mode or in a tournament mode, with a total of eighteen holes available. Like Mario Golf, shots are handled with a timer bar at the bottom of the screen. A vertical bar moves along the horozontal one; a button press stops the bar, determining the power of the shot. The bar then moves in the opposite direction, eventually passing a stationary bar. A second button press stops the moving bar again; the closer it is to the stationary bar, the more accurate (ie straight) the shot will be.<br/><br/>Tennis has doubles and singles modes on clay, hard and grass courts. You can play through an exhibition match, selecting the number of sets and games, or you can try out the tournament where you play against a series of opponents.<br/><br/>In living mode, the player can raise a white Bomberman, who lives in his own house. Within the house are several interactive objects, including a television. To get to these interactive objects, you open the remote. The remote options are as follows:<br/><br/>Channel 1: Watch a battle. Channel 2: Watch some baseball. Channel 3: Watch some tennis. Channel 4: Watch some golf. Channel 5: Edit your Bomberman character. Channel 6: Go to the options menu. Channel 7: Display calendar. Channel 8: Name your Bomberman character Channel 9: Buy things from the gumball machine.<br/><br/>The TV can be used to watch demos of matches (computer-only matches) from the game's different modes. There is also a gumball machine, which allows the player to spend 100 coins on things such as outfits for the player's Bomberman (coins are earned by playing the main game modes, and items are chosen at random).

It is the second published by THQ. It was released on September 18, 2006 at GameStop, then September 21, 2006 nationwide. This video game is based on the direct-to-DVD movie, Bratz Passion 4 Fashion Diamondz and the doll line, Bratz Forever Diamondz.<br/><br/>The gameplay of the Bratz Forever Diamondz is mostly the same as its predecessor, Bratz Rock Angelz. There are four playable characters: Yasmin, Cloe, Sasha and Jade. During the game, all of a sudden blue coins appear, called Blingz, which are money for the Bratz girls. There's a mobile phone menu, where you can read messages, and see the objective, what the player currently has to do.<br/><br/>It has explorable roam, similar to Grand Theft Auto series. When the player is not in an objective, he/she can take a character to collect character coins (which are can be used to buy movie clips. There are 25 for each Bratz girl), Blingz tokens, take pictures, and play mini-games for extra money.The new features in the video game, that there are timed objectives, which means that you have to do the objective in the amount of time. There's an ice rink, where the girls can perform ice-skating skills. The biggest new feature is that the player can adopt a pet (cat or dog), and take him/her to pet shows, accessorize it, etc. The pet helps in certain objectives, however, after that the player should give a treat for it. You can also take part in modeling contests to win Blingz. The mini-games can be activated to go into a place, or talk to a person.<br/><br/>Posing game: a rhythm game, where the player has to press the combination of buttons in time.<br/>    Smoothie-A-Go-Go: a timed mini-game, where the player has to deliver smoothies to people in time.<br/>    Skate Race Challenge: a timed mini-game, where the player has to collect flags on roller-skates in time.<br/><br/>Unlike its predecessor, this game has a multiplayer mode, which is can only be activated when two controllers are plugged into the console. There are three multiplayer games:<br/><br/>Pairz - a match game against the opponent to see who can get more matches.<br/>    Change outfits<br/>    Top Trumps - a game very similar to the card game War.

Later the girls launch their own line of fashion and form a rock band.<br/><br/>The player can explore three locations; Stylesville (also known as Bratz Town), London and Paris. The objectives of the game are triggered when the player takes the correct Bratz girl to a speech bubble. During the game blue coins called blingz appear, which are money for the Bratz girls. Each girl carries a mobile phone, used to send messages between characters, check the amount of blingz owned and the location of the next objective. The phone's cover and ringtone can be changed. The player character can also collect character coins, used to buy movie clips from the 25 available for each Bratz girl, take pictures, and play mini-games for extra money. The girls' make-up can be applied as the player wishes, the Bratz characters can be guided to shops, to buy the latest trends with their collected blingz.<br/><br/>Mini-games are activated by going to certain locations or talking to non-player characters. They include:<br/><br/>Posing game - The player must do the button combinations before the time runs out. In certain objectives, this mini-game will be featured.<br/>    Blown Away! - The player has to pick up pieces of paper that a person has dropped, and return them.<br/>    Model Behavior! - The player has to take pictures in a photo booth.<br/>    Rockin' Racerz - The player has to put on the Bratz girl's roller skates, and grab the flags as fast as she can.<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;Bratz: Rock Angelz (video game&quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "116089": {"statistics": {}, "name": "Brian Lara International Cricket 2005", "videogamemode": {"2422": "Local Multiplayer"}, "videogameversion": {"144369": "Australian/New Zealand Ricky Ponting Cricket  PS2 edition"}, "average": "0", "videogameseries": {"6883": "Brian Lara Cricket"}, "videogametheme": {"2405": "Sports - Other"}, "usersrated": "0", "videogamegenre": {"2157": "Sports"}, "videogameplatform": {"4434": "PlayStation 2"}, "poll": {}, "description": "Brian Lara International Cricket 2005 (BLIC) (also known as Ricky Ponting Cricket in Australia and New Zealand) is a cricket video game from Codemasters, available on Xbox, PlayStation 2 and Windows PC platforms. released on 21 July 2005, which was the first day of the 2005 Ashes series. The game is followed by Brian Lara International Cricket 2007 (Ricky Ponting International Cricket 2007 in Australia and New Zealand and Yuvraj Singh International Cricket in India).<br/><br/>This game is the follow-up to Brian Lara Cricket '99 (also known as Shane Warne Cricket '99 in Australia and New Zealand). It contains the 2003 Cricket World Cup in Africa and the 2004 ICC Champions Trophy. These two competitions are licensed by the International Cricket Council (ICC) and contain official player names, faces, kits, badges and sponsors. All other modes are unofficial as the rights for these belong to EA Sports and therefore some players and kits are made up; for example Graham Thorpe becomes &quot;G Thrip&quot; and Shane Warne becomes &quot;S Worde&quot;. The only correct names in these modes are Brian Lara himself, (shown as &quot;B Lara&quot;), and Australian Captain Ricky Ponting (similarly shown as R Ponting). The game is also first to include licensed bats such as the Kookaburra Diablo and the GM Purist. The game takes the perspective of the normal cricket TV coverage, other views and displays in the game also try to emulate TV coverage of cricket, for example Hawk-Eye, an electronic system used to track cricket balls as they are bowled is featured in the game.<br/><br/>There are a few types of cricket that can be played in the game. Test match, Test series, One Day match, World Cup, ICC Champion's Trophy and practice mode. Along with the types of cricket there are several difficulty settings. Slog mode, village, county and test. With each difficulty bowling and batting decreases in ease. The game also offers the player to construct their own team from cricketers already in the game, and to construct their own &quot;Career Players&quot; who gain experience with each match. There is also a &quot;Classic XI&quot; mode, which has famous cricketers of the past such as W.G. Grace, Imran Khan and Jim Laker.<br/><br/>There are also a challenge mode in the game, where the player can take on cricketing challenges based on notable cricket matches from the past.

Here, adjacent means orthogonally or diagonally adjacent to and on the same level as the last placed marble or onto a 2x2 platform just completed by the last placed marble.<br/><br/>If a player is unable to place a marble in this way, she or he places a black meatball marble on any empty space or platform and takes the tie-breaker token.<br/><br/>The game ends when the only space left is the peak of the Shibumi pyramid.  A black meatball marble is then placed on the top of the pyramid. This is a neutral move and the tie breaker token stays with its current owner.<br/><br/>The player who created the longest strand of touching spaghetti or sauce marbles (when the board is viewed from above) wins the game. If there is a tie, the player who last played a meatball marble loses.<br/><br/>A strand is a connected set of like-colored marbles such that each marble in the strand is connected to one or two other marbles in the strand as in a chain of links.

Players must create a given name (up to eight letters) to his or her character before beginning the actual game.

Two developmental challenges (i.e., teaching the baby how to speak or teaching the baby how to crawl) must be passed before the baby is allowed to grow by one month.  Using the microphone to expand the baby's vocabulary and the stylus to put on new clothes for them helps provide the challenges that new parents face with their infants every day.

They change direction when they hit a wall, see the player, or after a certain period of time. They will fire towards the player. The fourth enemy type is Spook, the ghost of a previous entrant to the fortress. He appears if you spend too long on any one screen, moving towards you and ignoring walls.

It may be the original universal system, allowing you to play any type of story simply by leaving out all of the other stuff you don&rsquo;t want. Unfortunately, many players today do not appreciate the timeless qualities of the game system and refer to it as &quot;dated&quot; or &quot;retro&quot; or &quot;is this is joke?&quot;. To help expose those players to the wonderment that is the world of Vanth I have embarked upon a mission to bring the joy of Encounter Critical to a modern-day universal roleplay system Savage Worlds.<br/><br/>The motto of Savage Worlds is Fast! Furious! Fun! That is very applicable to Encounter Critical. What is presented in what I am calling Encounter Savage! is not intended to be a direct conversion between the two systems. You cannot convert your Klengon Half-Frankenstein PsiWitch directly into Savage Worlds, you will need to recreate that character from scratch. These rules will help you do that. However I have worked hard to apply the principles of Hank Riley and Jim Ireland's True Scientific Realism so that Encounter Savage! characters will be as much like Encounter Critical characters as possible.
