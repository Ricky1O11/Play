Whether you're fighting for humanity, the Scourge or for your own ends is up to you!<br/><br/>Dropzone Commander is a 10mm scale sci-fi tabletop wargame, devised for mass battles between two or more players. The rules are designed for efficient and dynamic games which can be played on a standard 4'x4' table (although larger tables work well also!)<br/><br/>The rules are based on an alternate activation system, which keeps the action constant and involving. They are also scalable, and will cater for tactical skirmishes as well as titanic clashes of metal and firepower. This is accomplished whilst never sacrificing the character of individual units, and indeed all the colour and eventfulness of battle.<br/><br/>A vast array of war machines will be at your disposal, but this does not belittle the importance of the humble infantryman.<br/><br/>The game is built around the concept of rapid deployment and redeployment of your forces by airborne dropships, exemplifying the pace of combat on the battlefields of the future. This makes for a tactical and fast paced experience, where quick thinking and strokes of genius often bring victory.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": ["English edition 1.1", "English First edition"], "maxplaytime": "0", "name": "Dropzone Commander", "playingtime": "0", "boardgamemechanic": ["Dice Rolling", "Variable Player Powers"], "age": "0", "boardgameexpansion": ["200758", "206541"], "usersrated": "114", "boardgamesubdomain": ["Wargames"], "average": "7.74079", "boardgamepodcastepisode": ["Int, February 2013: Leprecon preview", "Meeples &amp; Miniatures - Episode 97 - Bolt Action &amp; Dropzone Commander (&amp; Dreadball)"]}, "126022": {"rpgartist": ["Anthony Combrexelle", "Willy Favre", "Andr\u00e9 Reina", "William Tibaud"], "rpgitemversion": ["PDF Edition"], "poll": [], "name": "D\u00e9dale", "rpgdesigner": ["Willy Favre"], "rpgproducer": ["Willy Favre"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1337385.jpg", "usersrated": "0", "average": "0", "rpggenre": ["Science Fiction (Time / Dimension Travel)"], "statistics": [], "rpg": ["D\u00e9dale"], "rpgpublisher": ["Le Lab"], "rpgcategory": ["Core Rules (min needed to play)"], "rpgseries": ["Lab.01"], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1337385_t.jpg", "description": "Translated from the Game's Introduction:<br/><br/>D&eacute;dale is an &quot;anachronistic anticipation&quot; RPG.

The goal is to sink enemy shipping, perform special missions, accumulate experience, and manage crew stress.<br/><br/>The American submarine campaign in the Pacific during World War II was a major contributor to the ultimate defeat of Japan. During the war, American submarines comprised less than two percent of the U.S. Navy, but sank almost 60 percent of the Japanese merchant marine and more than 30 percent of Japan's navy, including eight aircraft carriers. Gato Leader moves the Leader series to Pacific waters, letting players lead a group of American submarines against the Empire of Japan. The core system of the game is built on U-Boat Leader and will be familiar to players of other Leader games, allowing them to get into the game quickly. A major portion of the game is determining where to send your submarines. Do you send your boats to the distant, better-defended, merchant-rich Japanese Home Waters, or do you hit the convoys supplying the far-flung Japanese bases? You can spend Special Operations Points to upgrade your submarines, concentrate intelligence resources, and send your submarines on special missions, such as mine-laying and hunting the Imperial Japanese Navy.<br/><br/>When a patrolling submarine encounters an enemy force the action then shifts to the tactical display where the submarine tries to close with and attack merchants while avoiding the escorting warships. When an attack starts you will have an idea of the number and general type of ships in the group, but you have to close with the ships to identify the ships and decide which ones are worth firing torpedoes or guns at. In addition to fighting the enemy, your submarines also have to deal with your own torpedo problems, including dud torpedoes and ones that turn on your submarine.<br/><br/>Gato Leader includes the following U.S. Navy submarine types: <br/>S Class<br/>Narwhal Class<br/>Permit Class<br/>Salmon Class<br/>Tambor/Gar Class<br/>Gato/Balao/Tench Class<br/><br/>Gato Leader includes four campaigns covering different stages of the Pacific submarine war:<br/><br/>Holding the Line: Submarine operations from Australia during 1942<br/><br/>Against the Sun: Submarine operations from Pearl Harbor during 1942<br/><br/>Turning the Tide: Submarine operations from Australia and Pearl Harbor during 1943<br/><br/>Setting Sun: Submarine operations from Pearl Harbor during 1944 and 1945<br/><br/>Component List:<br/>110 Full Color Cards<br/>176 Full Color Counters<br/>Tactical Display Sheet<br/>Ship Display Sheet<br/>Player Aid Sheet<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "1", "boardgameversion": ["First Edition"], "average": "7.71923", "name": "Gato Leader", "playingtime": "60", "boardgamemechanic": ["Area Movement", "Dice Rolling", "Simulation"], "age": "12", "usersrated": "26", "boardgameaccessory": ["U-Boat Leader and GATO Leader: Ship Miniatures & Battle Board!"], "boardgamefamily": ["Admin: Unreleased Games", "Leader Series", "Solitaire Games", "Solitaire Wargames", "Underwater War"], "boardgamepodcastepisode": ["Hearty Health Hospital"]}, "126028": {"rpg": ["Anima: Beyond Fantasy"], "statistics": [], "name": "Carpeta del Jugador", "average": "0", "usersrated": "0", "rpgitemversion": ["Spanish Version"], "rpggenre": ["Fantasy"], "rpgpublisher": ["Edge Entertainment"], "rpgcategory": ["Accessory (dice, maps, screens, cards)"], "poll": [], "description": "From the publisher's website:<br/>La Carpeta del Jugador es un suplemento para el Juego de Rol Anima en el que se incluyen:<br/><br/>40 Hojas de Jugador especializadas, con cuatro modelos diferentes de habilidades especiales ideales para personajes dotados de capacidades m&aacute;gicas, disciplinas ps&iacute;quicas o Dominios del Ki.<br/>    Una carpeta para llevar todas tus fichas de un lado a otro, que contiene en su interior una peque&ntilde;a gu&iacute;a con las tablas de referencia m&aacute;s &uacute;tiles para un jugador.<br/>    Un descomunal p&oacute;ster del Viejo Continente a todo color, en el que se incluyen todas sus localizaciones m&aacute;s relevantes.<br/><br/>User translation:<br/>The Player's Folder is a supplement for the Anima RPG which includes:<br/><br/><br/>    40 character sheets with four different designs for different abilities sets; ideal for those with magical abilities, psychic disciplines or domains of Ki.<br/>    A folder to move your pieces from one place to another, including a small guide with those reference tables that are most useful for a player.<br/>    A huge full color poster map of the old continent, which includes all important locations.<br/><br/><br/>"}, "126029": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1536998.png", "poll": [], "boardgamedesigner": ["Jey Legarie"], "statistics": [], "yearpublished": "2012", "maxplayers": "6", "boardgameartist": ["David Bezzina", "Ricardo Boronat", "Simon Buckroyd", "Lauren K.

Great nations protect and provide for their own, while fighting and competing against both other nations and nature itself. Nations must provide food and stability as the population increases. They must build a productive economy. And all the while, they must amaze the world with their great achievements to build up their heritage as the greatest nations in the history of mankind!<br/><br/>Nations is an intense historical board game for 1&ndash;5 players that takes 40 minutes per player to play. Players control the fate of nations from their humble start in prehistoric times until the beginning of World War I. The nations constantly compete against each other and must balance immediate needs, long-term growth, threats, and opportunities.<br/><br/>Gameplay introduction<br/><br/>Players choose a Nation and a difficulty to play at, similar to the Civilization computer games series. After the growth phase, 2 historical events are revealed, which the players will compete for during the round. Then players take a single small action each, in player order, as many times as they wish until all have passed. Actions are:<br/><br/><br/>     Buy a card<br/>     Deploy a worker<br/>     Hire an architect for a wonder<br/>     Special action provided by a card<br/><br/><br/>Players each have individual boards that represent their Nation. There are many ways that players affect, compete, and indirectly interact with other players. But there is no map, no units to move around, and no direct attacks on other players.<br/><br/>When all have passed, there is production, new player order is determined (every position is competed for), the historical events happen, and if this is the last round of an age, the books are scored. At the start of a new round, most old cards are removed and new ones are put on the display.<br/><br/>Victory points are gained and lost during the game, and also awarded at the end of the game.

They propose a game where they are the main characters. There will be two factions. Each faction will organize itself on one side of a chessboard. The number of the dice will be its strength, and it will change every time it's moved. The strong will eliminate the weak.<br/><br/>And the battle starts at the cry of &quot;Alea non jacta est&quot;<br/><br/><br/>In Artaban, each player controls seven 6-sided dice and a Leader Die (Which is just another 6-sided dice, but bigger than the other ones), for a total of 8 dice. The game starts with each player placing his dice on their second nearest row of the chessboard. (The face-up number of a die is its &quot;value&quot;. At the start of the game, sum of the values on the 8 dice must be 28). The objective is to move the dice to their last line of the board. To achieve so, players alternate turns where they have four available options:<br/><br/>1. Move a die left, right, or to the front by flipping the dice over (The top face ends being the left/right/front face respectively).<br/>2. Turn a dice 90&ordm; to the left or the right (without changing the topmost face).<br/>3. Capture an opposing die by placing a die (without turning/flipping it) on a square it could legally move to, but is occupied by an opposing die of less value (The Leader Die can capture dice of less and equal value, but can be captured just like any other die). [A variant allows dice to capture diagonally]<br/>4. Sacrifice a die by &quot;capturing&quot; an opposing die of the same value (Leader Die cannot be sacrificed). The opposing die is not retired (This helps speeding the game).<br/><br/>Other Rules:<br/>-No two dice can occupy the same square at the same time.<br/>-A die cannot move back or diagonally (Except to capture an opposing die when using the variant).<br/>-The game ends when no player can move any dice OR a player proposes a tie and it's accepted by the other.<br/><br/>At the end of the game, the face-up value of all dice at their last line is counted, and the player with the bigger score is the winner. If there is a tie, the player with most dice on his last line is the winner. If there still is a tie, the player with most dice on the board is the winner.

It is a sister game to Dark Dungeons and Darker Dungeons.<br/><br/>Like Darker Dungeons, it is based on a specific out-of-print edition of a specific role-playing game which cannot be named for legal reasons. However, this source is a different edition/game to the source of Dark Dungeons and Darker Dungeons.<br/><br/>The systems used in Darkest Dungeons emulate those of a more detailed and gritty system that was originally produced as a set of third-party supplements for the game that Dark Dungeons emulate, but which was later expanded into a full game in its own right. Naturally, this source of inspiration cannot be named here or within the Darkest Dungeons book; but as with the main target of Dark Dungeons  emulation you'll instantly recognise it if you have played the original - and if you haven't played the original it doesn't matter and you can enjoy the emulated version in its own right.<br/><br/>Like Darker Dungeons, this system is not a strict retro-clone of its source. Instead it is a blend of material inspired by the source and material taken directly from the System Reference Document (or SRD), published by Wizards of the Coast under a license called the Open Game License (or OGL).<br/><br/>Combat is much more dangerous and gritty than in Dark Dungeons, and even the most powerful characters may still be killed by a lucky blow. Conversely, magic - while more common than in Dark Dungeons - is less powerful than in that game.<br/><br/>The designer has described it as: &quot;Darkest Dungeons was going to be around 50% BECMI/RC emulation, 20% Rolemaster 2e emulation and 30% my house rules.<br/>&quot;Darkest Dungeons is now around 10% BECMI/RC emulation, 70% Rolemaster 2e emulation, 10% 3.5 SRD emulation, and 10% my house rules.&quot;<br/><br/>"}, "126252": {"poll": [], "name": "Turbo Boat Simulator", "videogamemode": ["Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["European Amstrad CPC edition", "Spanish Amstrad CPC edition"], "average": "0", "videogametheme": ["Ocean / Sea", "War - Modern"], "usersrated": "0", "videogamedeveloper": ["Probe Entertainment"], "videogamegenre": ["Shoot 'em Up"], "videogameplatform": ["Amstrad CPC"], "statistics": [], "videogamepublisher": ["MCM Software", "Telecomsoft"], "description": "User Summary<br/><br/>A side-scrolling shoot'em up in which you control a boat stuck behind enemy lines.

Gameplay starts with each player taking it in turn to place a Root into an empty 'soil' hexagon along the bottom of the board. When everyone has 2 roots, normal play begins. During normal play, players can grow up and out from the roots, place additional roots, uproot other players and snap opponents' branches.<br/><br/>The number of roots a player has at the start of their turn is the number of moves they can make in that turn; more roots means more moves. The Grow move doesn't require a dice.

You can also win if all the other players are out. (A player is out if they are smothered such that it's impossible for them to play a turn.) The game is played over one 'growing season' of 20 turns.

Each player is given a secret objective. The game continues until one or more of the players have achieved their objective. Taking it in turns each player draws the next card on their adventure. If the group fails to meet the challenge laid down in front of them they must retrace the steps and take another route. Along the way they can collect some strange and exotic equipment. Can they find the Airship to help them in their travels or find uptodate victorian clockwork technology? Only the cards will tell.<br/><br/>Characters<br/>Each player is given a Character that must complete an objective. The objectives are not publically known and are as follows.<br/><br/>     Cultist - One of the other players must be killed.<br/>     Greed - Must collect 40 000GP<br/>     Horder - Must get a unique set of items<br/>     Journalist - Must collect five items from different sets.<br/>     Hunter - Must collect a trophy from each different species of creature<br/>     Adventurer - The group must find the artifact (get to the end of the roads) with no other clear winner<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Start of Game<br/>Each player is dealt four cards off the equipment deck. They may spend up to 4000GP on the equipment they have drawn and must discard the rest. Each player signifies what they have equipped by placing it on the table in front of them. Equipment usual increases the attack strength of the character. The player with the highest attack strength is given the title of Watchman and goes first.<br/><br/>Taking a turn<br/>The Watchman turns over the first road card. The road cards contain one day event and one night event. Every player is expected to take part in the day event first then the watchman completes the night event alone. When both events have been completed the Watchman announce the player to their right is the new Watchman. All characters are now allowed to reequip, trade between themselves and use items. When this is finished the game continues.<br/><br/>If both road events are completed succesfully the card is placed down in the middle of the table to signify they are on their journey. If they fail the road card is discarded.<br/><br/>Events<br/>Day Event: This can be anything from a Shop to a toll bridge to a raid by Monsters.<br/>Night Event: This can be a travelling sales man, a theif or a night raid by Monsters.<br/><br/>Monsters<br/>There are seven different species of Monster. These are broken down into three different classes. To defeat a monster you must have an attack value greater then the monster's. If you defeat the monster you get his body as a trophy and one random equipment as loot. If you cannot defeat him alone someone else can help you but all loot is discarded. If you are unable to defeat a monster you loose a peice of equipped equipment. If you have no equipment left you die and are out of the game (Causing the Cultist to win). No one can fight more then one monster a turn. There are no limits to the number of trophies a player can carry.<br/><br/>Equipment<br/>Equipment falls in to five types Hat, Coat, Weapon, Gadget and One Shot. An equipment set is made up of a specified Hat, Coat, Weapon and Gadget. Hat, Coats and Weapons increase the characters attack value. Gadgets are usually useable by the whole group once one person has it equipped.  No one can fight more then one monster a round with the exception of One Shots. One Shots can be used once and then must be discarded. One Shots can be played on the monster or the character fighting the monster by anyone. The player can have at most four equipment cards in his hand unless he has a gadget that allows him to have more.<br/><br/>Money<br/>Every Monster Trophy and Equipment card has an amount of GP in the bottom right corner of the card. When the characters are at a shop then can discard either equipment or monster trophies for cards off the equipment draw pile at the apropriate cost. No change is given.<br/><br/>"}, "126266": {"poll": [], "name": "Silent Shadow", "videogamemode": ["Cooperative", "Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["English/European Amstrad CPC Floppy Disk (Budget Rerelease) edition", "Spanish Amstrad CPC edition"], "average": "0", "videogametheme": ["War - Modern"], "usersrated": "0", "videogamedeveloper": ["Topo Soft"], "videogamegenre": ["Shoot 'em Up"], "videogameplatform": ["Amstrad CPC"], "statistics": [], "videogamepublisher": ["Kixx", "Topo Soft"], "description": "User Summary<br/><br/>A Spanish vertical-scrolling shoot'em up.

At the night of solstice, they brought an unexpected end upon the world, precisely by the rules they had foretold. Anything that people could imagine happened on that night. During that tragic spectacle, the Masters of Brilliance separated wheat from chaff, taking the chosen ones to a new nice little hell they had built in a higher dimension somewhere at the doorstep of afterlife. No one knows how they got there or how they managed to affect reality. Anyway, only rigorous cooperation could grant them enough power.<br/><br/>The end of the world brought about by these wise guys was not as perfect as they had planned. Soon it turned out that some men left in the ashes of the past world could enter the realm of the Masters of Brilliance. Perhaps the power they cast upon the world to destroy it left a solid print? Or perhaps the transition was not that difficult?<br/><br/>The first man to discover he possessed this ability was Jonas Arvani. When he found out he was not the only one, he founded a guild. The boarding ability &ndash; that is, the ability to jump into a much higher plane, where the Masters of Brilliance have their twisted utopia &ndash; soon turned into an enormous business. Not everyone managed to follow the guild's strict rules. Therefore competitive undertakings began to appear that were less able and less honest. Now retrievers have been trained by guilds to steal inventions and devices from the enclave of the Masters of Brilliance. Those items become artifacts in the ruined world. The most valuable prizes are schematics that allow mankind to recreate lost devices, so that they can serve people again.<br/><br/>In the board game Enclave: Zakon Kra\u0144ca \u015awiata, each player starts with a retriever card along with the machine that boosts their boarding ability.

It is not a true demiplane or similar thing. It is more like a magic land, which has its own rules. It is said that a conclave of seven beings oversees on the Realm of Dream. In fact, on each of the seven worlds connected to the Realm, there are people who, in a way or another, have the ability to walk the dream. In the world of Arthad, for example, they are clerics called &ldquo;The Brotherhood of the Dream Walkers&rdquo; (for more information on this see the Brotherhoods sourcebook, available at &Oslash;one&rsquo;s website).<br/><br/>Normally, when a man sleeps he creates a small area in the Realm of Dream. In these areas, dreams take place, and when the dreamer awakens, this area disappears.

Each character fights with his/her own unique weapon while some are unarmed. If the weapon is used to block attacks too often, the character will only be able to fight with his/her bare hands and lose the weapon for the rest of the round. Fighting moves are classified under low, medium and hard in terms of attack power, in order of increasing amount of damage dealt to an opponent. Each character also has his/her own special attack to use against the opponent.<br/><br/>In 1996, Data East ported Outlaws Of The Lost Dynasty to the Sega Saturn and PlayStation platforms. Despite the North American arcade being titled Outlaws of the Lost Dynasty, the North American home version was retitled as Dark Legend, while the Japanese title remains unchanged in the Japanese home versions. These ports include both the Original Mode, the mode that plays just like the arcade version; and the Special Mode, which adds extra moves. There is also a beginner mode that can be accessed by pressing the L or R button at the same time. In 2P Battle mode, Makoto Mizoguchi from the Fighter's History series (also by Data East) can be unlocked. The North American version is an update from the Japanese Version and it was translated for the American audience; however, most of the Japanese text and especially voice samples remained. Some of the options has been removed as well as the option demo play. Unlike the Japanese version, you cannot select between Arcade Mode or Special Mode, instead it defaults to Special Mode.<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;Outlaws Of The Lost Dynasty&quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "126425": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1345143.jpg", "poll": [], "statistics": [], "yearpublished": "2012", "maxplayers": "6", "boardgameartist": ["John Kovalic"], "boardgamepublisher": ["Steve Jackson Games"], "maxplaytime": "90", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1345143_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "90", "boardgamecategory": ["Expansion for Base-game", "Fighting", "Humor"], "description": "<br/>Publisher's Description<br/><br/>Munchkin Bracelet of Slapping Rules<br/><br/>The Munchkin Bracelet of Slapping may be used in any game of Munchkin or its sequels.

Along the way, you will make decisions which will affect the outcome of His journeys and teachings. Thirteen possible alternate outcomes are included not to imply that other outcomes were in fact possible, but to build a strategy game that includes challenges with possibility of success and failure as the player of the game. Achieving the Major Victory (the historical outcomes) will demonstrate the extraordinary set of circumstances that took place and were necessary to achieve the birth of Christianity.<br/><br/>The events that take place often cause the political and religious leaders of the area (represented by Caiaphas, Herod Antipas, and Pontius Pilate in the game) to take notice and become increasingly concerned. In game terms, this is shown by moving those Leader markers along a track on the game board, advancing them from their start spaces one step at a time until they reach the final space on that track (&ldquo;Arrest in Jerusalem&rdquo;), at which point they attempt to arrest Jesus.<br/><br/>You get the chance to react to these movements with several choices each game turn. The goal is to assemble all twelve apostles, maintain a high level of piety, and enter into Jerusalem. Additionally, when trying to reconstruct the beginnings of Christianity historically, it is imperative that Judas betrays Jesus in Jerusalem. Events tend to push Jesus towards Jerusalem, but try to avoid entering too early before all the important pieces are in place!<br/><br/>Game Data:<br/><br/>Complexity: 3 on a 9 scale<br/>Solitaire Suitability: 9 on a 9 scale<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "1", "boardgameversion": ["English first edition (boxed)", "English first edition (polybag)"], "average": "6.86593", "name": "A.D. 30", "playingtime": "60", "boardgamemechanic": ["Action Point Allowance System", "Dice Rolling", "Point to Point Movement"], "age": "13", "usersrated": "123", "boardgamefamily": ["Bible Games", "Solitaire Games", "Victory Point Games Euro-Family Series"], "boardgamepodcastepisode": ["1P 021 - London\u2019s Burning", "ET100: El Ajedrez en las 5 Tribus.

The basic game mechanism is trick-taking, but whoever wins the trick can distribute the cards amongst all the players, depending on his character's ability. Bilbo, for example, must keep one card from the trick, give one card to another player, then discard the remaining cards.<br/><br/>In addition to a special ability, each character has a special affinity with the forces that govern his motives. Gandalf, Bilbo, and Thorin are scions of good, while Smaug and Bolg are cruel and evil. The cards respond to these alignments accordingly: a white star on the card symbolizes the forces of good; the helm of an orc adorns cards possessed of evil power; and a card with a pipe grants players the ability to draw an extra card in the next round. If a card with the opposite power is assigned to your character (Gandalf gets an orc helmet, or Smaug gets a star), then that character takes a point of damage. If your character is already damaged and is assigned a card with the symbol of their own side (Bilbo gets a star, or Bolg gets an orc helmet), then that character gets a single point of damage healed. Two points of damage eliminates a character from the game, so use the cards you win to knock out your opponents and heal your allies.<br/><br/>The round ends when players have emptied their hands, and the last of the cards that were in play have been assigned to the characters. Players who have taken enough damage are eliminated at this point. Depending of the number of players, if enough good characters have survived, the game continues until the final round.
