How will you like to be in their shoes for once? Wongamania presents you the opportunity to be both the man on the street, and the powerful invisible economic force dictating the fate of the financial markets. As you strive to accumulate wealth and bankrupt your enemies, learn about the economic forces that can either make you a tycoon, or a pauper.<br/><br/>Wongamania is a modern economic card game for 2 to 6 player. It places you in a simulated economic cycle, where you have to accumulate wealth using stocks, bonds and properties through economic bloom and gloom.<br/><br/>An average game will see you learning how to juggle different asset class in order to make money during good or bad times. At the same time, you will also play the role of market forces, putting your friends (or enemies) through personal hardships and economic turbulence. Wongamania is the first of its kind, to bring you through the world of inflation, interest rates, taxes and political turmoil.<br/><br/>While letting people have interactive fun and learning about economics are some of the objectives of this game, the Wongamania also wants to highlight some of the financial loopholes in the financial system.<br/><br/>Insurance fraud, scamming people of their hard earned money and moving money offshore, profiting from insider news, and relying on political connections to make money. All these themes are illustrated subtly within the game, to warn the man on the streets on how the game of money is stacked against them. Of course, a player may risk retribution from other players for going against the very sense of morality by employing such strategies in the game itself.<br/><br/>A non-retail limited launch edition of Wongamania was launched in August 2014 using the classic money colors of blue and gold, as a thank you gift for supporters, fans and advisors who helped to create Wongamania. The new retail edition of Wongamania features a different local Singaporean artist, with new and more colorful graphics, improved game rules, and enhanced card mechanics that will give players more flexibility to accumulate money, while taking down your enemies at the same time.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": {"252554": "English beta edition (300 copies)"}, "name": "Wongamania", "playingtime": "30", "boardgamemechanic": {"2013": "Commodity Speculation"}, "average": "6.50893", "usersrated": "28", "age": "8"}, "165889": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2662378.jpg", "is_expanded_by": {"210971": {"name": "Merkurya: Promo Essen"}}, "poll": {}, "boardgamedesigner": {"68065": {"name": "Dave Cousins"}}, "statistics": {}, "yearpublished": "2014", "maxplayers": "6", "boardgameartist": {"77930": "Matt Maddock"}, "boardgamepublisher": {"18021": {"name": "HCM Kinzel"}}, "maxplaytime": "10", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2662378_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "10", "boardgamecategory": {"1089": {"name": "Animals"}}, "description": "Safe Breaker (a.k.a. Merkurya) is a simple-to-learn game of memory and deduction! The game consists of 12 objects: six showing colors and six showing numbers. (In the original version of the game, these objects were cards; in newer versions, they're castle towers that stick together magnetically.)<br/><br/>Each player receives one color and one number, keeping these values secret since they form that player's combination. Play starts with one player asking the player to the left if they have a certain color and number. If they have either of those values, they say &quot;yes&quot; and they become the next player; otherwise they say &quot;no&quot; and the question passes to the next player to the left to answer.<br/><br/>When a player thinks they know an opponent's combination, on their turn they can name that player's color and number. If the guess is correct, that opponent is out of the game and the player gets another turn &mdash; but if they're wrong, they are out of the game instead and the wrongly accused opponent now has the next turn.<br/><br/>As far as the rules go, that's it! How much do you talk to your opponents? Do you keep quiet or suggest questions for them to ask? Do you remind them who answered what, and if you do, did you remember correctly?!

You&rsquo;re probably familiar with the long (and passionate) debates that can arise between die-rolling and point-buy methods of character creation, and odds are, you&rsquo;ve tried both. But this book is here to show you that those are just the tip of the iceberg when it comes to crafting a character.<br/><br/>New Beginnings: Alternate Character Creation Methods presents three new and radical methods of character creation, as well as five additional &ldquo;mini&rdquo; methods of character creation. Each of these methods is designed to facilitate different styles of play, and allows you to start your campaign off on the right note.<br/><br/>     Career character creation allows you to begin playing right away, by allowing you to play out (in broad brushstrokes) your character&rsquo;s life before the beginning of the campaign. The choices you make and the results of your rolls determine not just your character&rsquo;s ability scores, but also his starting weapon proficiencies and class skills. Not only does this method provide you with a creative starting point for your character&rsquo;s background and personality, but it also provides the opportunity to create characters that wouldn&rsquo;t ordinarily be possible, such as a sorcerer with Diplomacy as a class skill, or a rogue who is proficient with greataxes.<br/>     Prototype character creation is designed for those who want a quick start to the game. You choose from a list of pre-existing prototypes, which determine your starting class and ability scores, and also influence your starting skills and feats. While the main benefit to this method is speed, it also provides you with one or two unique special abilities based on the prototype you choose.<br/>     Tarot character creation disguises ability score generation within a tarot card reading, distributing ability score points based on the draw of the cards, and providing you with some strong and flavorful suggestions about your character&rsquo;s past and personality.<br/>     Five additional dice-based character creation methods, which tweak existing character creation methods and turn them more into mini-games, which challenge you to create the best character you can.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Whatever your play style, there&rsquo;s a character creation method here that&rsquo;s intended for you.

Ammunition and flashlights are scattered throughout the world as well. Players start with a random handgun, either a Smith and Wesson Model 10 revolver, a Colt M1911A1 semi-automatic pistol, or a selective fire Glock 17 pistol with an automatic sear. Players are also given a random inventory of ammunition and/or spare magazines for their weapon. Players may also start with a flashlight. While searching for tapes, the player will encounter stationary sentry turrets and mobile hover drones that will attack the player. A single hit to the player will kill them. Shooting these automated defenses can disable them, with shots to vital components, such as cameras, weapons, motor, or battery scoring significantly more damage. If a player dies, they lose all progress and the game is reset with a new level layout, spawn position, and inventory.<br/><br/>A core element of the game is how the player fires and reloads the handgun. The gun has to be used in a realistic fashion, meaning that all aspects of reloading the gun have to be enacted individually with different key presses. Rather than finding magazines as seen in most shooters, the player finds cartridges which must be individually loaded into the revolver chambers or pistol magazines. In-game actions mapped to individual key presses include, but are not limited to: removing the magazine from the pistol, inserting a cartridge into a magazine, inserting a magazine into the pistol, pulling back the slide, cocking the hammer, toggling the safety, inspecting the chamber, releasing the slide stop, and spinning the cylinder of the revolver. To emphasize understanding of the firearm, the player's handgun will start in a random condition; the magazine or chamber may be loaded or empty, the slide may be locked or unlocked, and the safety may be on or off.<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;Receiver (video game)&quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "165918": {"statistics": {}, "name": "We Sing 80s", "videogamemode": {"2422": "Local Multiplayer"}, "videogameversion": {"252633": "Wii EU Nintendo Optical Media edition"}, "average": "0", "videogameseries": {"7583": "We Sing"}, "videogametheme": {"2316": "Music"}, "usersrated": "0", "videogamegenre": {"2163": "Rhythm"}, "videogameplatform": {"4441": "Wii"}, "poll": {}, "description": "We Sing 80s is a 2012 karaoke game part of the We Sing family of games.

Victory is achievable through a number of viable options, which guarantees high re-playability.<br/><br/>The game is a fight over acquiring the best locations for your huts in this appealing and unspoiled landscape. If you manage to do so, you will become the rightful successor of the old chief and win the game. You gain Chief points by having the most huts (and the secondmost huts) along each of the eight divine paths monitored by the statues of Gods. Additional Chief points are earned by controlling sacred locations, by collecting amulets, and simply by building huts at lucrative spaces.<br/><br/>Building a hut requires that the space's landscape is &quot;active&quot; and that you can pay the exact price (not overpay) for the space. Therefore, the game feels tight even from the very start. The game gets tighter and tighter towards the end of the game as you have fewer choices of spaces, and as the actions you choose become more and more crucial.<br/><br/>In order to succeed in this game, you should carefully choose and time the best possible combination of actions, called &quot;ritual sites&quot;. A boat goes from ritual site to ritual site, first on the west side, then on the east side (in opposite order), triggering each action. If, for instance, you choose a ritual site high up, you will have an early choice of cards, but a late choice of space to build your huts or to collect amulets (and vice versa). A fourth action type is to select &quot;active landscapes&quot; and become starting player, which makes it possible to control the next round. After all players have performed two actions, the round ends. The game is usually played over 10-14 rounds and ends when one player builds his last hut.<br/><br/>Collecting amulets may be key in this game. Instead of keeping them as Chief points, you may use them to build huts on designated spaces which require payment in amulets instead of cards &mdash; and still to the exact price. Building huts on such spaces may be exactly what you need to get the majority along one or two divine paths. In order to gain enough amulets &mdash; and amulets of the appropriate values &mdash; you should position some of your huts on amulet spaces. The more huts you build on such spaces, the more amulets you can draw. The probability of getting the amulets you need will therefore increase.<br/><br/>The game board is built as a matrix system, with some spaces being part of two divine paths while other spaces belong to just one. The spaces that are part of two divine paths are obviously most tempting, but can you afford to build your huts there?<br/><br/>"}, "165949": {"rpgitemversion": {"252724": "PDF version"}, "poll": {}, "name": "Behir", "rpgproducer": {"34798": "Simon Giles"}, "average": "0", "usersrated": "0", "statistics": {}, "rpg": {"2791": "Pathfinder System Compatible Product"}, "rpgcategory": {"2108": "Sourcebook (rules/options to enhance play)"}, "rpgseries": {"4463": "The Lazy GM"}, "rpggenre": {"155": "Fantasy (High Fantasy)"}, "description": "From publisher blurb:<br/><br/>An alternative way to enjoy The Lazy GM.

Tangled alliances pushed them to the brink. Nations miscalculated and expected a short, limited war, but a four-year World War blew up in their faces and forever changed the continent and the world.<br/>Great War Commander traces the war as the nations and empires fought it on the western front across Belgium and northern France. The forces of three major powers-France, Germany and America- all have forces in the game. One player handles Germany while the other side commands either France or America.<br/> Great War Commander (GWC) is a wargame based on the popular Combat Commander series created by Chad Jensen where two players take turns playing &ldquo;Fate cards&rdquo; in order to activate military units on the mapboard. GWC offers many new and unique elements to its parent system. The maps are deeper, allowing more playing surface to maneuver two battalion-size forces facing each other. There are several new orders, like Offensive, Runner, and Machine Gun Suppress, all reflecting the intense and blinded combat. There are over 30 actions including Engineering works, Go to Ground, and Rolling Barrage, highlighting earthen ties and powerful artillery. And there are 40 events dealing with experiences unique to the times, such as Tanks and Sturmtruppen. Among the new and many contemporary events are Trommelfeuer, High Command Meddling, Petard Raquette and Machine Gun Nest.<br/><br/>Great War Commander puts emphasis on the rigid top-down field command structure of the period with captains giving orders to lieutnants and NCOs which is new to the system. Besides the Fate Cards, there are Strategy Cards which factor in higher command and give a flavor and depth to the battles beyond that of the tactical level.<br/><br/>Players already familiar with the Combat Commander system will find a ready path to learning Great War Commander, at the same time discovering the one-off experiences of the Great War. There are some trenches to be sure, but there are many open field battles too. Barrages can alter terrain. Gas attacks can flood a sector. Air dominance or reconnaissance can influence the fighting.<br/><br/>Stand with the French at Verdun. Charge forward with the Germans in Belgium and at the Marne. Follow the Americans as they slug their way into and through Belleau Wood. GWC offers fifteen historical scenarios including one introductory scenario for players not yet familiar with the general game system, a three players scenario and four scenarios with tanks. The replay value is high and possible do-it-yourself scenarios add even more depth. Hexasim expects to expand GWC in upcoming sequels covering British, Russians, Austrians, Turks and Great War actions in Africa .<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": {"252752": "First edition"}, "average": "7.75", "name": "Great War Commander", "playingtime": "120", "boardgamemechanic": {"2018": "Campaign / Battle Card Driven"}, "age": "12", "usersrated": "6", "boardgamefamily": {"22184": "Admin: Unreleased Games"}}, "165968": {"rpg": {"19559": "Plot-Your-Own / Plot-It-Yourself"}, "statistics": {}, "name": "Staying Alive", "rpgproducer": {"3": "(Uncredited)"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3676749.jpg", "usersrated": "0", "rpgitemversion": {"252757": "Softcover Version"}, "average": "0", "rpggenre": {"946": "Modern (Pop Culture)"}, "rpgcategory": {"2136": "Solitaire Adventure"}, "poll": {}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3676749_t.jpg", "description": "User Summary:<br/><br/>This solitaire adventure book uses a similar system to the &quot;Choose Your Own Adventure&quot; books, where the options chosen from those given on a page lead the player to another page based on the choice made.<br/><br/>From the Front Cover<br/><br/>From the Paramount hit movie starring John Travolta!<br/><br/>"}, "165969": {"rpgitemversion": {"252758": "PDF Version"}, "statistics": {}, "name": "Sagas of the Icelanders MC Playsheets", "rpgproducer": {"65060": "Gregor Vuga"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2241617.jpg", "usersrated": "0", "average": "0", "rpggenre": {"942": "Culture"}, "rpg": {"20480": "Sagas of the Icelanders"}, "rpgcategory": {"2086": "Accessory (dice, maps, screens, cards)"}, "poll": {}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2241617_t.jpg", "description": "This contains resources for the MC (GM) of the game to use during play.<br/><br/>"}, "165972": {"statistics": {}, "name": "Pro Evolution Soccer 2013", "videogamemode": {"2313": "Cooperative"}, "videogameversion": {"252769": "3DS Physical edition"}, "average": "8", "videogameseries": {"4910": "Pro Evolution Soccer"}, "videogametheme": {"2373": "Sports - Soccer"}, "usersrated": "1", "videogamegenre": {"2157": "Sports"}, "videogameplatform": {"5857": "Nintendo 3DS"}, "videogamehonor": {"31937": "2012 Game Critics Best Sports Game of the Year Nominee"}, "poll": {}, "description": "Pro Evolution Soccer 2013 (also known as World Soccer: Winning Eleven 2013 in Japan and South Korea) is an association football video game and the latest edition of the Pro Evolution Soccer series, developed and published by Konami.

Or have your PCs ever stumbled into a place you haven't had time to fully develop as a living, breathing part of the campaign?<br/><br/>Well, why not take out a handful of dice and roll up an instant NPC! Or in this case, an &quot;Insta-NPC&quot;!<br/><br/>The Insta-NPCs product line is designed to offer one or more tables to roll on to figure out a little something about the NPC you're pulling together.<br/><br/>When filling your game worlds with people, places, and things, how often do you think about the art on the walls or in the halls? How about the artists who created such pieces?<br/><br/>This is an area of worldbuilding that is often glossed over and completely missed as a source of opportunity. Imagine a sculpture commissioned by a noble family with a clue strategically placed in plain sight. Or a painting designed to cover an old map to the family treasure.<br/><br/>But sometimes a rose is just a rose and means nothing more than the fact that a gardener or landscape artist chose to add some beauty to an otherwise dreary corner of the world...<br/><br/>History is filled with stories of famous artists and the impact they have had on those around them. From the story of the Mona Lisa that becomes more clear as art historians discover additional clues revealed through technological advances to the art stolen by the Nazis during World War II that is still being found decades later. Why not use art in our own worlds to illuminate the past or shed light on futures yet to be revealed?<br/><br/>Insta-NPCs #6: Shh... Artists at Work... aims to help you come up with those details for your games through not one, but two detailed processes - one for creating individual (or group) artists, and one for creating actual pieces of art.<br/><br/>But how does it work exactly?<br/><br/>Let's say I collect the following details for an artist:<br/><br/>     Individual or Group? Individual<br/>     Alive or Dead? Alive<br/>     Production? Occasional<br/>     Style? Story<br/>     Medium? Architecture<br/>     Dedication? Inspired<br/>     Tools? Words<br/>     Love? Tone<br/>     Subject? Pastoral<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>This one is a bit tricky, but I might come up with something like this:<br/><br/>Eder Rosz is not your traditional builder, but has a unique specialty. He focuses entirely on the building of barns for small farmers and ranchers on the plains. His construction methods are pretty standard, but he takes his inspiration from classic pastoral poetry from the Greeks. A barn built for a farmer using oxen in the fields may be inspired to be triangular like a plow based on Virgil's &quot;First Georgic&quot; - &quot;The time has come for my groaning ox to drag / My heavy plow across the fields, so that / The plow blade shines as the furrow rubs against it...&quot; The very words of the poet may then be featured on a plaque located within the construction as a bit of a calling card... Rosz has built nearly a dozen barns over the last decade, each still standing strong on the Great Plains.<br/><br/>Though this particular artist may not be world renowned, he has a piece of history in an area the PCs may be exploring. Such details (and his knowledge of Greek poetry) may in fact be an important<br/><br/>Or perhaps I needed a piece of art to help inspire some history for a kingdom and come up with these details:<br/><br/>     Subject? Individuals<br/>     Medium? Song<br/>     Style? Abstract<br/>     Tools? Emotion<br/>     Creator? A Bard from the Harpers (chosen, not rolled)<br/>     Creator state? Dead<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>The piece may be described as:<br/><br/>The &quot;Battle of Magav Creek&quot; was written by Yaxan Tinh, a fine poet and bard of the finest training, nearly a century ago. The song memorializes the battle fought by the great King Hadan on the edge of the Kingdom of Roon. An orcish leader had raised a small army in an attempt to take back land they thought rightfully theirs (though lost long ago through conquest). The Rooni army met the orcs on the field near Magav Creek in a campaign that lasted weeks. Finally in a desperate attempt to end the bloodshed, King Hadan led a charge across Magav Creek deep into orc territory demanding audience. He fought the orc leader Kayne in single combat, losing an arm and almost his life in the process but was victorious. The song is hardly sung these days, as Tinh and Hadan long ago left the mortal realms, but can still be heard sung by the older soldiers of the lands from time to time...<br/><br/>From just a few words, in context, a GM's muse can come up with some strange and wonderful things!<br/><br/>Like all Moebius Adventures supplements, Insta-NPCs #6: Shh...

Up to four players and bots in local multiplayer advance through randomly generated dungeons with one player as the hero and the others as ghosts who possess traps and monsters in the environment to kill and thus replace the hero. The game was released through Steam Early Access for Microsoft Windows, OS X, and Linux platforms on August 6, 2014<br/><br/>Crawl is a cross-genre game with roguelike, bullet hell, and brawler elements for up to four offline players and bots. The main player advances through randomly generated dungeons as a human hero while up to three other ghost players control the dungeon's enemies and traps to kill the main player. The ghost player who kills the human hero swaps roles to become the next main player. Players earn experience as they progress through the dungeon in both the human hero and the non-human ghost roles. Hero experience unlocks new attacks and spells, and ghost experience unlocks stronger enemies to possess.[4] Each player's human hero experience level, weapon, and stats progress is preserved between turns. Crawl was designed to be more fast-paced and arcade-like than strategic, and includes genre-standard activities like collecting loot and upgradable weapons and magic items. Once player ghosts possess &quot;monster spawners&quot; and traps in the active room, they cannot leave the form until they die or kill the main character. The players and enemies grow progressively more powerful over the course of a match. The game ends when a human hero reaches experience level 10, enters a portal, and defeats a final boss controlled cooperatively by the other players.

Based on Hirohiko Araki's long-running manga series JoJo's Bizarre Adventure, the game allows players to compete against each other using over 40 characters taken from all eight current story arcs. The game was released in Japan on August 29, 2013, and was released internationally in late April 2014.<br/><br/>JoJo's Bizarre Adventure: All Star Battle is a 3D fighting game in which players can fight against each other using characters taken from all eight current story arcs from Hirohiko Araki's JoJo's Bizarre Adventure manga series (and one prior work by Araki), fighting in various locations taken from the manga. Like most fighting games, the aim is to defeat your opponent by draining their stamina gauge (HP is used in a certain game mode) with various attacks and special techniques. The player wins a round by draining all of their opponent's stamina, or by possessing more stamina than their opponent when time runs out. Gameplay uses five main buttons; light, medium, and heavy attacks, a dodge button, and a &quot;Style&quot; button. Along with the ability to use various special attacks and techniques with different directional inputs, each character possesses a Battle Style, allowing them to utilize additional moves with the &quot;Style&quot; button. Styles fall into one of six main categories: Hamon, Vampirism, Mode, Stand, Mounted, and Baoh Armed Phenomenon, each utilizing different abilities when the Style button is pressed. For example, Hamon users can use the power of the Hamon to augment their strength, whilst Stand users can summon out their Stand, giving them additional move types whilst also making themselves more vulnerable.<br/><br/>Attacking and receiving damage fills up a player's Heart Heat Gauge (\u30cf\u30fc\u30c8\u30d2\u30fc\u30c8\u30b2\u30fc\u30b8 H\u0101to H\u012bto G\u0113ji) which, when filled to either one or two levels, allows players to perform powerful Heart Heat Attacks (\u30cf\u30fc\u30c8\u30d2\u30fc\u30c8\u30a2\u30bf\u30c3\u30af H\u0101to H\u012bto Attakku, HHA) or Great Heat Attacks (\u30b0\u30ec\u30fc\u30c8\u30d2\u30fc\u30c8\u30a2\u30bf\u30c3\u30af Gur\u0113to H\u012bto Attaku, GHA), depending on how much their gauge is filled and which multiple button input is chosen. Players can decrease their opponent's Heart Heat Gauge by using taunts when they are knocked down. Players can also use Flash Cancels[&alpha;] to deplete their own Heart Heat Gauge to cancel their current combo attack and chain into a new one. The Heart Heat Gauge is also used in some Battle Styles and certain special techniques. Rush Mode (\u30e9\u30c3\u30b7\u30e5\u30e2\u30fc\u30c9 Rasshu M\u014ddo), similar to the &quot;Blazing Fists Match&quot; system of Capcom's 1998 fighting game based on the series, occurs when two &quot;Rush&quot; attacks collide with each other, beginning a button mashing minigame. When a character's Stamina is low, the character enters one of two modes to turn the tide of the match: Rumble Mode (\u30b4\u30b4\u30b4\u30e2\u30fc\u30c9 Gogogo M\u014ddo), which increases the character's attack strength and Heart Heat Gauge restoration, and Resolve Mode (\u899a\u609f\u30e2\u30fc\u30c9 Kakugo M\u014ddo), which in addition to the bonuses from Rumble Mode adds a temporary invincible armor as well. Novice players can use the Easy Beat (\u30a4\u30fc\u30b8\u30fc\u30d3\u30fc\u30c8 \u012aj\u012b B\u012bto) system, which allows them to more easily string together combos and techniques by using only a single button. Along with the stamina gauge, players also have a Guard Gauge (\u30ac\u30fc\u30c9\u30b2\u30fc\u30b8 G\u0101do G\u0113ji) which depletes when they block attacks, causing them to become vulnerable if it is completely drained in a Guard Crush (\u30ac\u30fc\u30c9\u30af\u30e9\u30c3\u30b7\u30e5 G\u0101do Kurasshu). The Guard Gauge is also depleted by Stylish Evades,[&beta;] special dodges that when executed properly make the character perform one of their iconic poses from the manga.<br/><br/>Each of the game's stages, based on locations from the manga, feature battleground gimmicks[&gamma;] which trigger when a character is knocked down onto a certain area, causing hazards such as a speeding chariot to run characters down or a rain of poison dart frogs to induce a poison status.[4] There are also Dramatic Finishes,[&delta;] which trigger when a player is defeated by a super move in a certain area, replicating scenes from the manga.<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;JoJo's Bizarre Adventure: All Star Battle&quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "165561": {"statistics": {}, "name": "Miner 2049er II", "videogamemode": {"2149": "Single-Player"}, "videogameversion": {"251832": "North American Apple ][ edition"}, "average": "0", "videogameseries": {"25783": "Miner 2049er"}, "videogametheme": {"2739": "Mining"}, "usersrated": "0", "videogamegenre": {"2164": "Platform"}, "videogameplatform": {"4978": "Apple II"}, "poll": {}, "description": "User Summary<br/><br/>Bounty Bob is back!

Each Player creates a Hero Character in search of Wealth, Adventure and Renown. To survive and thrive in a land torn apart by Religious Wars, Intrigue, Piracy and Plague, the Player Heroes must seek employment from a variety of Patrons and perform Assignments such as escorting envoys, participating in Battles, dueling rivals, espionage, political intrigue, rescuing damsels, and assassinations. As your Hero gains experience and renown they can improve their attributes and status.<br/><br/>GAME OBJECTIVE: The Objective of each Player Hero is to Gain as much Renown Points (RP) to become a Nobleman. Game length is determined by the Nobility Title desired: Baron (60RP), Count (80RP) or Duke (100RP). In order to become a Nobleman, the Player Hero must complete Assignments to earn enough RP to purchase the various Titles.<br/><br/>GAME FEATURES: Soldiers of Glory features lots and lots of colorful game counters including Swordsmen, Cavaliers, Brigands, Soldiers, Assassins, Nobles, Femmes Fatal, fierce animals, and much more. The game is played on a 6 Sheet Map with Large Hexes and a variety of terrain. Game includes Duels, Skirmishes, Battles, Fortress Assaults, Combat at Sea, Pirates and more.<br/><br/>If you are a fan of the Three Musketeers, any Errol Flynn movie, Alatriste, and other swashbuckling tales, this game is for you.<br/><br/>ASSEMBLY TIME: This game, since there are a lot of counters, may take longer than the designer's other games.

The game is part of Tom Clancy's Ghost Recon series. On 24 May 2011, Ubisoft announced that its Singapore studio would develop Ghost Recon Online for the latter half of 2011, following an initial closed beta. This game is supported by micro transactions. On 7 June 2011, Nintendo announced at the Electronic Entertainment Expo that Ubisoft would release the game for the Wii U. Also, Ubisoft presented trailers and demos for the Wii U version of the game. The Windows version is confirmed to be a free-to-play game, and requires a Uplay account. Whilst not officially confirmed to be a free-to-play model as well for the Wii U as of January 2013, Nintendo's president and CEO Satoru Iwata commented in an interview that he has no opposition against this model and is willing to work with it.<br/><br/>Despite the fact the Wii U version of the game was not presented during either Ubisoft's or Nintendo's conferences at E3 2012, Ubisoft reaffirms that the game is still coming to Wii U. According to Ubisoft's senior vice president of sales and marketing Tony Key, he says that &quot;Ghost Recon Online is being developed for the PC first. That was always the plan. The team is taking a little bit longer than they thought they would to get Ghost Recon Online to the level and quality that they want and that definitely has had an impact on how much time they're able to spend on the Wii U version because we want to make sure we get it right.&quot; Key also states that much of the development team behind the Wii U version of the game are also working on the PC version, and that focus will shift to the Wii U once the PC version is completed.<br/><br/>Additionally, Key also says, &quot;If we start working on the Wii U too soon, we might end up wasting a lot of resources because the PC is a lot easier to test and learn with. Ghost Recon Online on the PC, we can test and learn with that and apply all the best benefits we learn onto the Wii U version to make sure that it's a great Wii U game. That's an unusual product for a console and we want to make sure we nail it.&quot;<br/><br/>On 6 September 2012, the game's producer stated that &quot;as of right now, the entire Ghost Recon team is focused on the PC version only&quot; and that &quot;the Wii U version is on hold&quot;.<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;Tom Clancy's Ghost Recon Phantoms&quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "165610": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2235550.png", "poll": {}, "boardgamedesigner": {"73324": {"name": "Joseph Mysliwiec"}}, "statistics": {}, "yearpublished": "2013", "maxplayers": "2", "boardgameartist": {"73422": "Francis Vallejo"}, "boardgamepublisher": {"4": {"name": "(Self-Published)"}}, "maxplaytime": "30", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2235550_t.png", "minplaytime": "30", "boardgamecategory": {"1023": {"name": "Bluffing"}}, "description": "Round Ten is a 2 player table top card game.

The game begins with a drafting session in which you purchase units (soldiers, knights, camps and catapults) and bid on special abilities that will enhance your income, attack, or other options in the game.<br/><br/>The game is then played over four turns (seasons), and in each turn players simultaneously choose one of three potential actions: (a) tax, (b) build new units, or (c) move and attack. Each turn ends with players collecting income.<br/><br/>To attack, you move your unit into an occupied area, then secretly decide how much gold you will spend to motivate your troops. The defender then has to guess how much you have spent. If the defender guesses wrong, the attack succeeds; if the defender is correct, the attack fails and you lose your unit. Regardless of success you have spent your gold, so the tight trade-off that players have to assess is whether to be cheap with your men so that you can conserve gold for future builds and attacks, or be generous to increase your chances now but limit future options.<br/><br/>The different abilities available in each game make for varied strategies and strong replayability as no two games are alike. After the initial strategic planning stage, Melee is fast and highly interactive. Beware as the game can end suddenly with a bold attack on an inadequately defended castle, making for a game that can be very nasty, brutish and short.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": {"275654": "Indie Boards and Cards English edition"}, "age": "10", "name": "Melee", "playingtime": "20", "boardgamemechanic": {"2080": "Area Control / Area Influence"}, "average": "6.04078", "usersrated": "450", "boardgamefamily": {"8374": "Crowdfunding: Kickstarter"}}, "165658": {"statistics": {}, "name": "Gigantic Army", "videogamemode": {"2149": "Single-Player"}, "videogameversion": {"252036": "Windows Downloadable edition"}, "average": "5.5", "videogametheme": {"2658": "Aliens"}, "usersrated": "2", "videogamegenre": {"2352": "Run-and-gun"}, "videogameplatform": {"4977": "Windows"}, "poll": {}, "description": "User Summary<br/><br/>Gigantic Army is a run-and-gun in a similar style to Metal Slug.

The game was released in Japan on 27 February 2014, and the western localization of the game was released in North America on 25 March 2014, and Europe on 28 March 2014.<br/><br/>The game is a revisit of Tecmo's 1996 PlayStation game Devil's Deception. As a game focused on strategy, the player aims to defeat enemies by luring them into a wide variety of traps.[3] The aim of the game is to prevent the enemy from reaching the player, exclusively using traps. Players can choose to utilise a variety of different traps, including rolling boulders, electrocution, fire, spring boards, spiked walls, human cannons, falling bathtubs, banana peels, an iron maiden, and locomotives. Proper timing of traps is an important aspect of the gameplay, as the player is also able to fall victim to their own traps.<br/><br/>Players are able to set their trap combinations within three methods, namely Brutality, Magnificence, or Humiliation; each different type used will grant different rewards from the devil's three servants. Effective utilisation of the environment also allows the player to deal additional damage to foes. The PlayStation Vita version of the game allows players to select and activate traps using the touch screen.<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;Deception IV: Blood Ties&quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "165769": {"average": "6.23333", "poll": {}, "name": "Dozen Doubloons", "playingtime": "5", "minplayers": "1", "boardgamemechanic": {"2047": "Memory"}, "yearpublished": "2014", "usersrated": "18", "boardgamefamily": {"8374": "Crowdfunding: Kickstarter"}, "maxplayers": "1", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2644266_t.png", "boardgameartist": {"16086": "Alan Anderson"}, "statistics": {}, "boardgamepublisher": {"25723": {"name": "World Village Games, LLC"}}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2644266.png", "boardgameversion": {"252294": "First edition"}, "maxplaytime": "5", "boardgamecategory": {"1002": {"name": "Card Game"}}, "age": "8", "minplaytime": "5", "description": "Dozen Doubloons is a solitaire card game for anyone aged 8 and up.

If a BLOCK card shows up, do not remove the card but move it and all cards underneath it to a position above any other unblocked stack.

This description will focus on the 2 to 4 player game, but there are also variants for one player or for 4 players on 2 teams. When playing with 2 or more people, the object of the game is to be the first player to make The Grand Tour by collecting all 9 planetary suites, including Pluto as a planet since the game was published before 2006. In case of a tie (2 or more players completing The Grand Tour in the same round), the player who completed the Grand Tour who has the most points wins. A planetary suite consists of a planet and all of its moons. For the sake of not making the sets impossible, the gas giants Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune each have 4 moons in this game. The moonless Mercury and Venus count as complete sets by themselves. The planets are categorized as inner or outer based on their position relative to the main Asteroid Belt located between the orbits of Mars and Jupiter.<br/><br/>The game has 92 playing cards, a pad of scoring sheets, a rules booklet, and 4 reference cards, which list all the cards needed for each of the 9 suites. The set of cards are color-coded by type, and each planet is also in a different color to make it easier to see what goes together. There are 2 of each planet and the 20 moons used in this game, and 1 each of 8 asteroids and 8 comets. There are also 10 wild cards which can serve in place of other cards, 2 each of 5 different types. The two Planet X cards will substitute for planets. The other 8 wild cards can all substitute for moons, with 4 of them also being usable for an asteroid, the other 4 for a comet. There are also 8 action cards, 4 which reverse the player order and give the person playing the card an extra turn, and 4 which discard a moon card (you can either discard one yourself, or make the next player discard one before beginning their turn, which can result in some complications if they don't have any moons or moon wild cards in their hand). Action cards are played by discarding them at the end of your turn (if you choose to use the discard moon card on yourself, you get to discard that card and one of your moons, with the moon card on top in the discard pile).<br/><br/>During each turn, you start by drawing until you have 10 cards in your hand (at game start, you have 9). So the smaller your hand is at the beginning of your turn, the better are your chances to draw cards you need. You can then lay down any number of comets and asteroids, up to the maximum of 2 of each, but can only lay down the planet and moon cards when you have a complete set of the same color - a planetary suite, or enough wild cards to substitute for the cards you don't have. You can use any number of wild cards in making a set but cannot play 2 of the same moon in a suite - but must have 1 of each or a suitable wild card. You can also pick up wild cards or complete planetary suites if you can replace them from your hand. You don't need to replace a Wild Card in order to pick it up if it was acting as a comet or asteroid. You can use a planet you scored in a previous round, which is called Retro-Touring. Laying down a previously scored planetary suite does not earn you more points but can serve the player doing this in several ways. You end each turn by discarding a card from your hand, whether or not you laid down any cards on the table. You can not have more than 2 asteroids, 2 comets, 1 Inner Planetary Suite, and 1 Outer Planetary Suite laid down on the table at the same time. If you have all of these in front of you, you are said to &quot;Go Out&quot; and the round ends immediately.  When one player completes all the cards to Go Out, ending the round, all the other players are then said to be Set. &quot;Set&quot; players are penalized for the point value of the cards in their hand. You count up the points of all the cards you laid down, with the planets and Planet X on the table being multiplied by 10, and then everyone except the player Going Out have to subtract the point value of the cards in their hand (planets are at face value for this portion of the scoring). This can result in a negative score. Most of the wild cards have a value of 0, with the exception of the 2 Planet X cards, which are worth 10. The moons, asteroids, and comets are worth 1. Action cards in the hand of a &quot;set&quot; player cost them two points. The planets increase in point value from 1 to 9 based on distance from the Sun (so Mercury is 1, Pluto is 9, etc). Usually one player is designated as the scorer and writes down everyone's points at the end of each round. You only score for a completed planetary suite the first time you use that particular planet.<br/><br/>The rulebook suggests that a different player should be dealer in each round. The Dealer rotates counter-clockwise in each round, and the players also go in this order, with the player to the right of the dealer going first. This direction is used because it corresponds with the orbits of the planets around the sun. This brings up some of the other educational aspects of this game. Each of the cards has a photograph or art of the object, and a few interesting facts about the object pictured. The Wild Cards are named after and depict other objects in the Solar System that are not in the normal cards. There is also more information and many website links of other educational resources in the rulebook.<br/><br/>There is a Solitaire version of the game, in which there is no point scoring or shuffling of cards within a round, the planets have to be obtained in a specific order, you deal cards and draw to a Phantom player (which are not available until you shuffle for the next round), and there are also 9 cards permanently discarded at the beginning of the game.<br/><br/>"}, "165790": {"statistics": {}, "name": "Fatal Theory", "videogamemode": {"2313": "Cooperative"}, "videogameversion": {"252341": "Windows Downloadable edition"}, "average": "0", "videogametheme": {"2148": "Fantasy"}, "usersrated": "0", "videogamegenre": {"2342": "Beat 'em Up"}, "videogameplatform": {"4977": "Windows"}, "poll": {}, "description": "When Nick Mayhem gets wind of zombies walking the streets, he doesn't just sit around waiting for the worst to happen.

It is the 24th installment of the NHL series and was released on September 9, 2014 in North America and three days later in Europe, Australia and New Zealand. The game serves as the debut entry in the series for eighth generation consoles, receiving releases on the PlayStation 4 and the Xbox One. Patrice Bergeron of the Boston Bruins is the official cover athlete.<br/><br/>Most features are exclusive to the next generation versions (PlayStation 4 and Xbox One) and are not present in the previous generation versions (PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360).<br/><br/>NHL Collision Physics is EA's revamped player physics and allows for secondary collisions, player pileups, and net scrambles. In the next generation, this applies to all 12 players on the ice, meaning that all players are affected by physics. This allows for pileups involving all 12 players. In the previous generation, not all 12 players are affected by physics, and pileups do not involve all of them.<br/>Revamped puck physics leads to authentic and unpredictable puck bounces, rolls and goals in the next generation versions. Everything on the ice controls puck physics. According to NHL 15 producer Sean Ramjagsingh, EA hired a software engineer who worked on the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) to help make the puck physics as realistic as possible.<br/>New modeling system for players and equipment allows for dynamic cloth technology in the next generation, with the players' clothes moving and affecting physics.<br/>Authentic NHL arenas: For the next generation versions, EA is re-creating 28 NHL arenas (PNC Arena and The United Center excluded) in extensive detail, making each arena unique and enabling larger crowds at NHL games.<br/>NBC Sports Game Day Presentation: As part of a new partnership with NBC Sports, the next generation versions will feature a broadcast package that closely resembles The NHL on NBC broadcasts.[<br/>New commentary: Play-by-play announcer Gary Thorne and color commentator Bill Clement have been replaced by NBC Sports commentators Mike &quot;Doc&quot; Emrick and Ed &quot;Eddie&quot; Olczyk, respectively. Additionally, in the next generation versions, TSN analyst Ray Ferraro will give game insights at ice level. Ferraro's proximity to EA's development studios in Vancouver allows EA to call him midseason to update the game with new insights as the 2014&ndash;15 season progresses. Emrick and Olczyk were recorded in front of a green screen and have been directly put into the virtual studio in the next generation versions, which eliminates lip syncing.<br/>Living crowds: On the next generation, the crowd is more alive with individuals holding up player signs, wearing costumes, and reacting authentically to plays. Over 9,000 new crowd models produces various different types of fans.<br/>In the next generation, Vision AI makes non-human-controlled players more aware of what is happening on the ice, including potential plays.<br/>Group celebration returns to the NHL series for the first time since NHL 11, allowing goalscorers to celebrate with teammates in the next generation versions. New individual player celebrations have also been added.<br/>Ultimate Edition: On June 30, 2014, EA confirmed that buyers can purchase an &quot;Ultimate Edition&quot; of the game for 10 extra dollars than the normal version would cost. Buyers of this exclusive edition will receive special content for the game's &quot;Ultimate Team&quot; mode, a popular game mode across all of EA's sports games, and will be playable in NHL 15.<br/><br/>Features removed<br/><br/>Both EASHL and GM Connected are not included in the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One versions of the game, however they are available for the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 versions. EA plans on reintroducing an improved EASHL game mode in future versions of the game. Online Team Play will not be available for PS4 and Xbox One at launch, however the mode is planned to be added in a future content update for the game. You will also not be able to control who you draft in Be a GM Mode, which is a huge part of building a successful team. Another feature removed from the Xbox One and PlayStation 4 versions of the game was the more involved Be A Pro game mode titled Live the Life, which was originally introduced in NHL 14. Live the Life will be included in the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 versions of NHL 15. The less involved game mode, Be A Pro, will be included in NHL 15 on Xbox One and PlayStation 4, though there will be no minor league teams involved, a random draft position for players, a lack of customization for players, and players will no longer have the ability to simulate between shifts during games. In light of the removed features for Xbox One and PlayStation 4, EA Sports NHL producer Sean Ramjagsingh confirmed via Twitter that a content update will later fix and improve the drafting feature.<br/><br/>Operation Sports created a complete list of missing modes/features that were available in last year's installment of the series but are either not included in the game at all for PS4/Xbox One, or were not spotted during the early access period.<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;NHL 15&quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "165802": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2238807.jpg", "poll": {}, "boardgamedesigner": {"8347": {"name": "Phil Walker-Harding"}}, "statistics": {}, "yearpublished": "2014", "maxplayers": "5", "boardgameartist": {"8347": "Phil Walker-Harding"}, "boardgamepublisher": {"2691": {"name": "Cocktail Games"}}, "maxplaytime": "15", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2238807_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "15", "boardgamecategory": {"1002": {"name": "Card Game"}}, "description": "A mini expansion for Sushi Go! includes four copies of a new &quot;Soy Sauce&quot; card that will score four points to the player who collects the most variety of colors in a round.<br/><br/>The Soy Sauce promo is contained in the 2016 release of Sushi Go Party.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": {"265610": "Dutch first edition"}, "average": "6.94566", "name": "Sushi Go!: Soy Sauce Promo", "playingtime": "15", "boardgamemechanic": {"2041": "Card Drafting"}, "age": "8", "boardgameexpansion": {}, "usersrated": "585", "expands": {"133473": {"name": "Sushi Go!"}}, "boardgamefamily": {"5841": "Food / Cooking"}}, "165803": {"statistics": {}, "name": "Planetary Annihilation", "videogamemode": {"2313": "Cooperative"}, "videogameversion": {"252380": "Linux download edition"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2347610.jpg", "videogameseries": {"36316": "Planetary Annihilation"}, "videogametheme": {"2264": "Science Fiction"}, "usersrated": "4", "average": "7.075", "videogamegenre": {"2166": "Real Time Strategy"}, "videogameplatform": {"5248": "Linux"}, "poll": {}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2347610_t.jpg", "description": "Planetary Annihilation is a real-time strategy computer game developed by Uber Entertainment, whose staff include several industry veterans who worked on Total Annihilation and Supreme Commander.<br/><br/>In interviews with PC Gamer and Joystiq, lead game developer Jon Mavor commented that the game's complexity and playtime can vary, from half-hour, 2-player battles to lengthy matches with potentially 40-players.

It is the follow-up to Earth Defense Force 2017.<br/><br/>Gameplay<br/><br/>The player takes control of an EDF soldier from one of four soldier classes. To fight these alien forces the player can access several weapons in the game, ranging from assault rifles and sniper rifles to rocket launchers, grenades, and laser weapons. Only two weapons may be selected for each mission with the exception of the Fencer, who can have four weapons. The game has more than seven hundred weapons; roughly 175 weapons per soldier class. This the highest weapon count of any EDF. Some levels also contain vehicles which can be operated. The game takes place across levels featuring destructible environments, taking place in settings such as cities, beaches, hills, underground tunnels and more. There is no penalty for collateral damage that is inflicted on the environment by the player, for instance when buildings crumble after sustaining a few hits from a rocket launcher or grenade. Other EDF soldiers can be recruited or followed, and attack enemies on sight, as well as provide radio chatter. You can also customize the color of your soldier.<br/><br/>There are several difficulty levels. More effective weapons are dropped by the enemies in the game at the higher difficulty levels, encouraging players to repeat the missions. In addition to weapons, armor enhancements which function as permanent maximum health bonuses are dropped along with healing items.<br/><br/>Story<br/><br/>The Earth Defense Force, a unified multinational military sponsored by nearly every country, is founded after detecting an impending alien visit in case the aliens prove to be hostile. In the year 2017, that proved to be true and the EDF fought against the Ravagers, an alien race that attacked Earth with giant insect-like creatures, UFOs, robots, and gigantic, 120 foot tall lizard-like creatures. Eight years after defeating the last Ravager in Arizona, they attack again with new creatures, evolved from their underground nest. Among them is the Retiarius, a spider-like creature which makes gigantic spider-webs, and giant bees. In the year 2025, the EDF must protect the Earth again from the alien invaders.<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;Earth Defense Force 2025&quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "165828": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2438665.jpg", "poll": {}, "boardgamedesigner": {"74301": {"name": "Scott Bowden (II)"}}, "statistics": {}, "yearpublished": "2015", "maxplayers": "4", "boardgameartist": {"14289": "Michael Dubisch"}, "boardgamepublisher": {"26798": {"name": "Protean Games"}}, "maxplaytime": "30", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2438665_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "30", "boardgamecategory": {"1002": {"name": "Card Game"}}, "description": "Truths Too Terrible is a game of deduction in a monster noir world full of strange and unknowable mysteries.

During my time at TSR, I had the pleasure and privilege of writing a series of stories about flying ships and gung-ho explorers on a quest to unveil the far-flung reaches of their magical world. Three years later, the market had evolved, the company changed, and the stories came to an end. With no option to keep the familiar heroes alive, I buried my old dreams. Out of the ashes at long last, a new tale now emerges in these pages, with another generation of adventurers and a world of their own. I am nervous and worried of course, but also excited and brimming with ideas and endless stories to tell. This first book, In Stranger Skies, covers an awful lot of ground, introducing a new crew and their ship. It also sketches out an entire universe, from planets, their sun, and a central world, Calidar, to a specific kingdom, Meryath, right down to the streets of its capital city. Races dwelling in this universe and their gods are depicted as well, along with a collection of skyships and mechanics to travel from the sky to space's starry vault. Though guidelines help adapt this fantasy setting to the Pathfinder Roleplaying Game, the World of Calidar isn't a game. Rather it provides a story and background information for use with any game system. With this long-overdue book, I now invite you to discover the heart and soul of this brave new universe.<br/><br/>"}, "165836": {"statistics": {}, "name": "Leisure Suit Larry: Greatest Hits and Misses!", "videogamemode": {"2149": "Single-Player"}, "videogameversion": {"252466": "CD-ROM edition"}, "average": "7", "videogameseries": {"5041": "Leisure Suit Larry"}, "videogametheme": {"2277": "Adult / Mature"}, "usersrated": "1", "videogamegenre": {"2152": "Adventure"}, "videogameplatform": {"4714": "DOS"}, "poll": {}, "videogamecompilation": {"70702": "Leisure Suit Larry 5: Passionate Patti Does a Little Undercover Work"}, "description": "This CD collection included all the Larry games up to Larry 6, including both versions of the original game, the VGA (non-talkie) floppy version of Larry 6, the Laffer Utilities and the original Softporn game.

The first deals with government agencies including the Nazi Occult Bureau, the British MI-5, the Department of Psychotronic Research, and the GRU, among others. These semi-secret government agencies are outlined with a discussion on their purposes, policies, and practices. The Second section of this supplement focuses on secret societies, many of which deal with occultism, divine faith, or organized crime. These include the Templar Knights, the Rosicrucians, the Priory of Sion, the League of Blood, the Vril, the Genovese crime family, Skull and Bones, the Black Dragon Society, the Golden Dawn, the New Forest Witches, and many more. The descriptions also feature brief stat-blocks that detail when the society was founded, the regions of the world it is active in, its symbol, and its mission. The last section of this supplement discusses political and social ideologies of the early 20th century such as Communism, Nazism, and Capitalism, as well as a few resistance groups such as the White Russians.

This first book, In Stranger Skies, covers an awful lot of ground, introducing a new crew and their ship. It also sketches out an entire universe, from planets, their sun, and a central world, Calidar, to a specific kingdom, Meryath, right down to the streets of its capital city. Races dwelling in this universe and their gods are depicted as well, along with a collection of skyships and mechanics to travel from the sky to space's starry vault.

(The map is based off of old viking maps, it represents what they had mapped out to be the northern European islands.  In actuality there were not as many scattered islands as they had thought.  Thematically, this was the way they pictured the world to the west.)<br/><br/>There are three main sectors on the map, from east to west they are A, B and C.  The greatest rewards can be found to the far west in the C sector, but they are also the hardest to reach as they require long journeys across the sea.<br/><br/>Each player starts the game with 3 vikings on the board, 2 steel and 2 food tokens, 5 ship tokens and 12 vikings in reserve, and 10 shield tokens.  During each turn players will each have 7 action points they can use for movement, harvesting resources, razing villages, building ships and sailing, constructing runes to the gods, and attacking each other, all of which offer varying victory point margins.  Many of the actions require resources and troops to complete, requiring players to plan ahead in order to carry out their turns.<br/><br/>The game is driven by an event deck of 32 cards.  At the beginning of each round one card is drawn from the event deck, some random events will help all players and some will hurt all players, most of the events are Crusader cards that correspond to the 3 sectors.  When a Crusader card is drawn a die is rolled  for its corresponding sector and a Crusader shield is placed in that village, players can destroy the Crusader shields for points and are encouraged to because if a 7th Crusader shield is ever placed on the map then all players lose the game.<br/><br/>The game ends when a player places their 10th player shield on a village, or when the event deck runs out.  Players then tally their points for player shields, Crusader shields, vikings and ships on the board, runes, money, attack tokens, and so forth, and whoever has the most points is the winner.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": {"252522": "First edition"}, "age": "12", "name": "Rise of the Northmen", "playingtime": "90", "boardgamemechanic": {"2001": "Action Point Allowance System"}, "average": "0", "usersrated": "0", "boardgamefamily": {"22184": "Admin: Unreleased Games"}}, "165872": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2729630.png", "poll": {}, "boardgamedesigner": {"77922": {"name": "Harold Buchanan"}}, "statistics": {}, "yearpublished": "2016", "maxplayers": "4", "boardgameartist": {"2652": "Charles Kibler"}, "boardgamepublisher": {"52": {"name": "GMT Games"}}, "maxplaytime": "360", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2729630_t.png", "minplaytime": "180", "boardgamecategory": {"1075": {"name": "American Revolutionary War"}}, "boardgamehonor": {"40873": "2016 Golden Geek Best Wargame Nominee"}, "description": "Volume V in GMT&rsquo;s COIN Series takes us back to the struggle of the American Patriots against their parent British government.   A unique multi-faction treatment of the American Revolution, Liberty or Death: The American Insurrection will take 1 to 4 players between lines of clashing red and blue infantry, Indian raids, European politics, British control of the seas, French intervention, and the propaganda war.<br/><br/>Building off the good works of COIN Series Creator Volko Ruhnke and Series Designers Jeff Grossman, Brian Train, Mark Herman, and Andrew Ruhnke Designer Harold Buchanan applies his knowledge of the American Revolutionary period to take a new look at the struggle that built a nation. COIN Series Developer Mike Bertucelli continues his work on this project and Volko Ruhnke is an active advisor.<br/><br/>Liberty or Death: The American Insurrection features the same card-assisted counterinsurgency game system as GMT's Andean Abyss, Cuba Libre, A Distant Plain, Fire in the Lake and Gallic War with a set of twists that take the COIN Series to the 18th Century, including:<br/><br/><br/>    Brilliant Strokes that trump initiative (Led by leaders like Washington, Rochambeau, Clinton and Joseph Brant) <br/>    Irregular troops (Patriot Militia and Indian War Parties) <br/>    Regular troops (British and French Regulars and Patriot Continentals)  for battles and skirmishes with line infantry <br/>    Rabble Rousing, Skirmishing, Tories, variable French entry, and Indian Raids<br/>    Variable impact of naval commitments between the British and French <br/>    French blockades to confound British plans<br/>    French financing options to feed the Patriot&rsquo;s war effort<br/>    A large deck of 110 + cards for great play variety <br/>    Short, medium, and long-length scenarios with period-event or random options. <br/><br/><br/>Each faction in Liberty or Death brings new capabilities and challenges:<br/><br/>As the British, you have to deal with an Insurrection across a massive region.  With control of the seas (at least until the French arrive), you have extreme flexibility and can move across the coast and cities at will.  You will muster Tories to support your efforts.  They will march with you to battle, but they need your cover.  You can control any space you choose, but you cannot answer every threat on the map.  The Indians will work with you but, like the Tories, will need you to coordinate and protect them when the Patriots become aggressive.  With the leadership of Gage, Howe, and then Clinton, you will be able to strike a potentially decisive Brilliant Stroke if the stars align.  Each leader brings something new to the war effort.  If you can strike the decisive blow and Win the Day you will be able to build Support and reduce Opposition in short order.  If the option to Battle the French in the Colonies presents itself, it will be hard to pass up!<br/><br/>As the Patriots, you initially aren&rsquo;t powerful enough to counteract the British Army.  You will need to pick your battles and initially spread the Militia to key areas.  Over time you can train a force of Continentals to take on the British Regulars.  Until then, Rabble-rouse and work with the French to challenge British dominance.  Skirmish with the British in small numbers to make their stay expensive.  Will the French be there when you need them?  Persuade the local population to give you resources to keep the heat up.  Watch the Indians on the Frontier because if they develop their forces unanswered you won&rsquo;t be able to win the game regardless of what happens with the British.<br/><br/>As the Indian player, you have selected the lesser of two evils in aligning with the British.  You will work with them to lower Opposition using Raids but you will be developing your footprint by Gathering forces and building villages.  The British can help you to protect them from the Patriots and in return you can assist the British in controlling the region.  War Chief Joseph Brant and later War Chief Cornplanter give you the ability to mount a decisive attack with your War Parties but will it be worth exposing your villages to Patriot attack?<br/><br/>As the French, you have the ability to be the thorn in the side of the British in North America.  With the Hortalez Rodrigue et Cie Company, formed to feed the Patriots resources, you can fund the Insurrection.  Your agents can rally assistance in and around Quebec and you can facilitate privateers to steal resources from the British. When you sign the Treaty of Alliance with the Patriots, you can bring French Regulars to America to March and Battle.  You can also increase French Naval Intervention, Blockade Cities, move Regulars by sea and Skirmish with the British.<br/><br/>As with earlier COIN Series volumes, players of Liberty or Death: The American Insurrection will face difficult strategic decisions with each card.

Winning a race requires a combination of speed, tactics, planning and skill.  You will have to play the right tactics at the right time to improve your track position.  Each race car driver needs to decide if they should throttle back and save fuel, or scorch their tires making a charge to the front.  Will you risk a wreck, or play it safe?  Will you try a bold fuel strategy, or pit with the rest of the field?  3-Wide puts you in the driver's seat, and on the crew chief's pit box!<br/><br/>Each tire of each car has four levels of wear.  These tire wear levels in turn determine the custom colored dice that you will roll to determine the speed of your car.  As the team owner you have a hand of tactic cards which can be played on behalf of your team cars.  Successfully playing tactics is dependent upon the location of other cars around your car, and the timing of when the tactic cards are resolved.  Driver skills are precious resources that can be used to avoid a nasty situation on the track, or to exploit an opportunity on pit lane.  Pit stops become necessary as your tires wear away, and as your fuel gauge is nearing empty.  Planning a good fuel strategy can be vital.<br/><br/>Eighteen different race tracks are modeled in terms of configuration, braking zones, tactical card deck composition, tire wear, and fuel consumption.  Each track also features two different race lengths so you can play a short game or a long one.<br/><br/>Winning is everything, but if you don&rsquo;t come across the line first maybe you can console yourself with how well your team did overall.  You can also string together a series of races and have a championship season!<br/><br/>"}, "165876": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2239884.jpg", "poll": {}, "boardgamedesigner": {"2118": {"name": "Stephen Glenn"}}, "statistics": {}, "yearpublished": "2014", "maxplayers": "4", "boardgameartist": {"40620": "Pedro Soto"}, "boardgamepublisher": {"105": {"name": "R&R Games"}}, "maxplaytime": "60", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2239884_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "60", "boardgamecategory": {"1034": {"name": "Trains"}}, "description": "It's the early 1900's and you are the owner of one of the fastest growing rail companies in the eastern USA.<br/><br/>In Spike, you expand your rail network as you connect cities in order to pick up and deliver more goods; complete contracts and routes to bring in money to modernize your train; upgrade your engines, tenders and railcars to transport the most freight; and build farther, transport more, and amass wealth on your way to become &quot;King of the Rails&quot;.<br/><br/><br/>Game Summary <br/>Setup<br/>- Randomly distribute the 12 goods tokens into the chart on the board.<br/>- Shuffle track deck, place 4 in display.<br/>- Place the 3 game timer cards on the track on the board, the first one face up.<br/>- Each player:<br/>... gets a random contract showing a starting city, an end city, and several cities along the way.
