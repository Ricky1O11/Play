The player with the most power wins!<br/><br/>The game features satirical artwork that satirizes American interest groups, voting blocks, and political candidates.<br/><br/>Each player receives a leader card at the start of the game and 5 faction cards. Each turn, a player can <br/>1. campaign (varies with leader, but usually is draw 1 card) or embezzle (get $2)<br/>2. sneak (play 2 cards face down), exploit (play 1 faction card and use the ability listed on the card), or fundraise (get money equal to your total wealth.)<br/>3. use their leader superpower (this costs money, and some superpowers can be used even when it is not your turn.)<br/><br/>There are 10 rounds. At the end of each round there is an event. Events can have positive or negative effects on players, usually negative. 3 of those events are elections, with the very last event being a presidential election.<br/><br/>Faction cards have three stats: votes, wealth, and power. They also have either an exploit ability (used when &quot;exploiting&quot;) or a surprise ability (an effect you get if you discard the card, usually in response to another player doing something).<br/><br/>Money (called MegaBucks) can also be used to purchase investments (there are 4 face up at any time) that vary in how many influence points they give you at the end of the game. Some also let you draw cards immediately or affect vote totals.<br/><br/>Each player develops their board over the ten rounds, adding factions to their coalition of supporters, purchasing investments, trying to win elections, and using the exploit and surprise abilities listed on their faction cards, as well as the superpower listed on their leader, to interfere with opponents or improve their own position.<br/><br/>Designed by Brandon Patton and Andre Pereira.

The result was a humiliating defeat for the coalition that led to the overthrow of Otto IV, and the signing of the Magna Carta by John of England.<br/><br/>This battle isn't just important historically, but makes for an exciting gaming situation. The French have a weak left flank that must be protected at all costs to avoid automatic defeat. The Coalition's center wing has a clear superiority in Infantry, both in terms of quantity and quality, that might just prove decisive.<br/><br/>There are plenty of tactical decisions to be made, and one crucial strategic one: when the French Player declares initiative for the first time, it brings his powerful cavalry reserve-- and that of his opponent-- into play. Do it too soon and the German horse might help turn that vital flank. Wait too long, and they won't turn the tide.

Whenever a non-trivial action is attempted, the GM secretly assigned a Difficulty Rating and publicly identifies a Trump Suit that best characterizes the action.  For example, in combat the suit would be Clubs.  Players play a number of cards from their hand corresponding to their Attribute Score denoted by the Trump Suit.  The card values are summed and if they exceed the Difficulty Rating the player is successful.  Playing Trump cards allow for immediate draw-and-play.  After playing, success or failure, players draw two cards into their hand.

The number of cards are drawn on opposed actions.  Characters may cooperate on an action (if logical) and pool played cards.  Characters may attempt multiple action and split played cards.  Wounds cause characters to discard cards; running out of cards results in the inability to perform any actions.  Jokers have special rules.

Both question cards and category tokens are kept in an orange color to make them distinct from the original BEZZERWIZZER game and BEZZERWIZZER Kompakt. This means that you can mix tokens from all of the games together and create your own game with precisely the categories you like.<br/><br/>The rules below are an exact copy of the ones from Bezzerwizzer Kompakt:<br/><br/>To start with the players are divided into two to six teams. Each team can consist of one or more players. Each team then gets a bezzerwizzer token that can be used once per round (see below).<br/><br/>Now the game starts: Each team picks a token at random out of the included bag. There are 20 tokens - one for each category in the game. The token must be kept secret for the other players. The first team to go then choose either to answer a question in the category on their token or to swap with one of the other teams without knowing what they will get. If they answer the question that they end up with correctly, they will receive 3 points - a wrong answer does nothing. Scoring is kept on the included pad. This continues till all teams have answered a question. The last team will not have the possibility to swap as all other teams have used up their categories.<br/><br/>Each turn each of the teams have one opportunity to bezzerwizze one of the other teams question. This means that if the team does not answer the question correctly the team that has bezzerwizzet has a chance to answer as well. If the first team does answer correctly however the others team will have wasted their chance to bezzerwizze. The number of points you get for bezzerwizzing and answering correct is dependent on at what time you choose to do it. If you choose to bezzerwizze after the category is revealed but before the question is read aloud you will get 2 points for a correct answer. If you do it after the question has been read aloud you will only get 1 point. If the teams that bezzerwizzet can not answer correctly either the original team will receive the points.<br/><br/>The turn order then switches one place and the process starts again. If there are fewer category tokens in the bag than the number of teams when a new turn is started all of the tokens are returned to the bag.<br/><br/>The game ends when one of the teams have 20 points (the round is finished to allow other teams to reach 20 as well).

The characters are members of Macbeth&rsquo;s team, advising, executing, and working, while all around them the glittering advances of Macbeth&rsquo;s ambitions turn to ash.<br/><br/>Protocol is a series of story roleplaying games that thrusts characters together into dramatic situations. Each game uses the same set of rules, with vastly different parameters, start points, characters, and finales. Players take on the roles of directors outside the action and characters inside the action, using the ebb and flow of four different scene-framing styles (vignettes, interrogations, interludes, and ensembles) to tell meaningful stories about characters in crisis.<br/><br/>Each game in the Protocol series is zero-prep for 3 or more players. The game length is exponentially long, so games with more players take more time to complete. The Protocol Series requires a deck of poker cards as well as tokens to track drama points.<br/><br/>"}, "186576": {"rpgdesigner": ["Sean Nokes", "Walt Robillard"], "rpgitemversion": ["PDF version"], "poll": [], "name": "Belly of the Beast (Supers!)", "rpgartist": ["Ade Smith"], "rpgproducer": ["Mike Lafferty", "Ade Smith"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2715055.jpg", "usersrated": "0", "average": "0", "statistics": [], "rpggenre": ["Action / Adventure (Superheroes)"], "rpgpublisher": ["Fainting Goat Games"], "rpg": ["SUPERS!

The catch is that the stupid humans have not only placed it in a maze but also that the maze keeps changing. Nevertheless, you want that cheese, even if it means that you have to face dangerous traps. Beware, there are other mice in the maze as well and they may trick you to leave the cheese in their nests instead.<br/><br/>For each cheese that you take to your private nest, you score 1 point. For each cheese that you take to a shared nest, the players of the adjacent private nests score 1 point each. The player with the most points when all cheeses have been taken or no more actions are possible wins.<br/><br/>The game starts with 7x7 maze tiles, of which only the central one (the Cheese Chamber) is turned face up. The players start with 1 maze tile each. Each turn, a player does the following:<br/><br/>1. Move your mouse as far as you can along the path. In a nest, you may choose not to move, and in the Cheese Chamber, you may choose through which exit you move.<br/>2. Move marbles as far as they can along the path. Marbles are traps that return mice to their nests and cause them to lose 1 turn.<br/>3. Replace a maze tile anywhere in the maze by placing the one on your hand face up. If the maze tile you replace is turned face up, the next maze tile you replace must be turned face down.<br/><br/>When you leave the Cheese Chamber, you take a cheese, and when you enter a nest, you leave the cheese there, even if it is not a nest of your own. If you are hit by a marble, the cheese is left in the maze, and if you pass another mouse, you exchange whatever you carry. If you move out of the maze, you return to your nest and loses one turn while the cheese is returned to the Cheese Chamber.

Some of these Territories will allow players to purchase enchanted weaponry, lethal skills, or even grant their owners an income boost.<br/><br/>The Town is expanded by each player with 3 different tiles - Roads, Markets and Buildings. These serve as space for the unit to move through and players to claim territory over (by placing faction-coloured territory cards over, directly).<br/><br/>Thievery, as the name suggest, revolves around coin management and manipulation. You can steal from enemy units just as well as you can steal from their lands. Your Thieves will help you with all your cunning needs, your Thugs keep the enemy out. And your Rogues, well... They specialise in keeping the enemy out of Town, permanently.<br/><br/>There are several ways to win the game. Either a player places all of their faction's territory cards, or they manage to capture all their enemies' territories before they can expand too much.

The Story Telling Game is a great birthday and Christmas gift and it not only encourages creativity, but it will keep children entertained on rainy days and school holidays. Created for budding Jackanorys, The Story Telling Game sees each player start with five words on their cards and when the clock starts, the first players starts telling a story using one of their words. Then it's the turn of the next player who has to incorporate one of their words into the former player's story... and so it goes on with each player adding to the story with one of their words at a time until the buzzer declares that it's 'The End' for the player who's talking when the buzzer sounds. When this happens, the player has to pick up all the cards used by the other players and begin a new story, this time with the opening 'Twice upon a time'. The story doesn't have to win awards or be a work of literary genius - it can be about anything but has to include one of the words on each of their cards. The Smiley Trump card adds a twist to the game as it can be used as any word and if a player is caught out by the buzzer, the Smiley Trump means they get off scot-free and the next player has to collect all the cards.<br/><br/>"}, "186606": {"rpgartist": ["Jon Hodgson"], "rpgitemversion": ["PDF version", "Saddle Stapled", "\u30b0\u30ed\u30fc\u30e9\u30f3\u30b5\u306e\u5fd8\u308c\u3089\u308c\u305f\u79d8\u5bc6\u305f\u3061"], "poll": [], "name": "Forgotten Secrets of Glorantha", "rpgdesigner": ["Fabian K\u00fcchler", "Sandy Petersen"], "rpgproducer": ["Yohann Delalande", "Fabian K\u00fcchler", "Scott Martin (II)", "Sandy Petersen", "Claudia Schiller", "Kirsten Skacel", "Gianni Vacca"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2718376.jpg", "usersrated": "3", "rpgsetting": ["Glorantha"], "average": "8", "rpggenre": ["Mythology / Folklore"], "statistics": [], "rpg": ["Hero Wars (1st edition)", "HeroQuest (1st Edition)", "HeroQuest (2nd Edition)", "HeroQuest Glorantha", "Mythras", "RuneQuest (1st & 2nd Editions)", "RuneQuest (3rd Edition)", "RuneQuest (MRQ)", "RuneQuest (version Fran\u00e7aise)", "RuneQuest II"], "rpgpublisher": ["The Chaos Society", "Tentacles Press"], "rpgcategory": ["Sourcebook (rules/options to enhance play)"], "rpgseries": ["THE KRAKEN Chapbooks"], "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2718376_t.jpg", "description": "Publisher's blurb<br/><br/>Enjoy the full transcript of the awesome Sandy Petersen seminar 'Forgotten Secrets of Glorantha' at THE KRAKEN 2014 with illustrations by Jon Hodgson.<br/><br/>"}, "186607": {"boardgamedesigner": ["\u7c92\u5e78\u4e45 (Yukihisa Tsubu)"], "average": "0", "poll": [], "name": "Otenki Kaeru", "playingtime": "10", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": ["Hand Management", "Voting"], "yearpublished": "2014", "usersrated": "0", "maxplayers": "4", "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2760344_t.png", "boardgameartist": ["\u30e1\u30a4 (May)"], "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["\u30c8\u30fc\u30db\u30af\u30a6\u30a3\u30b9\u30c6\u30ea\u30a2 (Tohoku Wisteria)"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2760344.png", "boardgameversion": ["Japanese first edition"], "maxplaytime": "0", "boardgamecategory": ["Animals", "Card Game", "Children's Game"], "age": "6", "minplaytime": "10", "description": "User summary:<br/>\u304a\u3066\u3093\u304d\u30ab\u30a8\u30eb (Otenki Kaeru) means Weather Frog in English.

Players control a home galaxy and a fleet of space ships. As players upgrade their galaxies, they gain access to more ships and more dice.<br/><br/>Each turn, a player rolls a set of dice; how many dice are rolled is determined by the level of that player's galaxy.

Each die, in order, is then resolved and the results are immediate, which allows the player to pull-off unseen combos and surprise other players. Other players have the option to copy other player's actions...at a cost!<br/><br/>As players expand their galaxy by colonizing other planets through economic and diplomatic influence, they gain victory points AND the special powers brought in by those planets!

It also charts the secret, three-way war that is still being fought between the Templars, the Freemasons, and the Catholic Church.

Players sit on corners of the playing surface.  The game board randomly is generated by creating a 3x3 grid from the board pieces.  Each of the nine sectors of the game board provides various terrain benefits or penalties.  During the game a total of fifty &quot;troopers&quot; will deploy into various sectors and players may move their varan units into sectors.<br/><br/>Game Play:<br/><br/>Play proceeds in turns.  During turn setup, each player selects and plays four action cards.  Then play proceeds in player order, with each player in sequence executing their four played action cards.  Action cards are resolved in the order of priority indicated on their face; they may distribute damage tokens.  Damaged &quot;troopers&quot; are eliminated and varans with enough accumulated damage tokens also are eliminated.  After each player has taken their phase all &quot;troopers&quot; take automatic actions of either shooting at a visible varan or, if no varans are visible to them, by moving to a new sector.  At the end of each turn new &quot;troopers&quot; deploy onto the board if any counters remain.<br/><br/>The game continues until end of turn when there are no more trooper counters on the board or one varan team has all its members killed.

In the ensuing deflagration, the weakest gods are obliterated, rendered down into the small fragments of power that constituted their being. The stronger ones were able to resist total annihilation but even their prodigious power could not save them entirely. As the survivors fell from the broken mountain, the shards of their divinity and the remnants of those that did not survive were scattered to the 4 corners of a now broken world.<br/><br/>As they awoke, each god found themselves to be but a shadow of their former selves. They were still mighty, stronger than any mortal that yet walked but they were no longer all powerful, no longer immortal.

Athens burns, Crete has sunken below the waves of the roiling seas and the immortal mount Olympus is now an ash covered wreck of its former glory.

Included are 48 Medieval Unit Cards (4 Colored Factions: Blue Cross, Green Star, Red &amp; Gold, and Purple Chevron).<br/><br/>In addition to the 48 Unit cards, there are 16 Wizards (4 different classes for each colored faction), and 6 Plague Cards. Plague Cards do not belong to any color; therefore, they cannot be discarded, ONLY PURGED. Plague Cards were created to prevent you from getting rid of all your cards. There are several ways to remove these cards from your hand (see Wizard Cards). Part of the fun is discovering these various methods of &quot;purging&quot; the Plague.<br/><br/>Wizard Cards are played in the same manner as the other Colored Units. For example, a Blue Wizard can be played on top of any Blue Unit or on top of any other Wizard. There are four types of Wizard Cards, each with their own unique action.<br/><br/>Swap-A-Hand Wizard - When you play this Wizard, swap your hand with the hand of another player. The choice of which player to Swap-A- Hand with is yours. Once the &ldquo;swap&rdquo; has occurred, play continues to the next player in turn.<br/><br/>Draw Two Wizard - When you play this Wizard, the next player must draw 2 cards. The player who draws the additional cards will still be able to play their turn. If they do not have a playable card after Drawing Two, they must continue to Draw until they draw a card that can be played. A turn is determined complete when a card has been played.<br/><br/>Purge-A-Card Wizard - When you play this Wizard, you may discard ANY card of your choice from your hand. Place the card of your choice facedown on the tabletop, thus removing it from the game completely. The card has now been PURGED.<br/><br/>Purge-The-Plague Wizard - When you play this Wizard, you may discard ONLY Plague Cards from your hand. However there is no limit to how many Plague Cards you can discard. Place the Plague Card(s) face up on the tabletop, thus removing it from the game completely. *The two &quot;Purge&quot; Wizard cards are the ONLY cards that can remove Plague Cards from your hand and therefore the game. Also important is the ability of the &quot;Purge-A-Card&quot; Wizard to remove ANY card from the game. The ability to remove Any card allows various opportunities to develop.

The game is published in a Japanese / English edition.<br/><br/>In the game, the player starts with one hand card, then draws a second. From these two, they play a card to the tableau. Cards are played touching, in columns left or right but shifted halfway up or down. In the one payer game, a column is restricted to 4 cards, in the two player, the limit is 3 cards. Alternately, you may exchange a played card with a hand card. But next turn, after drawing, you must play down two cards so your hand is back down to one before drawing.<br/><br/>Once all the cards are played, cards are turned face-down if any card on its right is of a lower number. Then the player tries to find paths in the tableau from the far left to the far right side. Think of this as telling the story. Any cards that are not part of a valid path are also turned down.<br/><br/>Now you score for colour groups, and deduct points for face-down cards and gaps in the tableau. After keeping a column, shuffle the deck over and play a second round to get your final score and the King's opinion!<br/><br/>For two players, it's the same with both players working a hand of two each. You cannot consult about which card to play, but after choosing, you may confer about placing. The final score this time reflects a test of your friendship.<br/><br/>Publisher's summary:<br/>&quot;You shall be rewarded if your tale amuses me.&quot;<br/><br/>The eccentric king issued the edict to all over the country. You are a bard who is willing to take up that challenge. You have to make up a tale by mixing stories in the world and enchant the king with the tale.<br/><br/>With beautifully illustrated 22 tarot cards with four background colours, this card game demands you make a succession of tough decisions. You will be excited to see how the storyline barely keeps consistency.<br/><br/>Basically, you play a card from two cards in your hand each turn. When you have played all cards, the first round ends and you score according to the card positions. With some of these cards remaining in play, the game proceeds to the second round in the same way. The total of two rounds is your final score.<br/><br/>Publisher's summary:    <br/>\u300c\u308f\u3057\u3092\u6e80\u8db3\u3055\u305b\u308b\u8a71\u304c\u51fa\u6765\u305f\u8005\u306b\u306f\u8912\u7f8e\u3092\u53d6\u3089\u305b\u308b\u300d<br/>\u5909\u308f\u308a\u8005\u306e\u738b\u69d8\u306f\u56fd\u4e2d\u306b\u304a\u89e6\u308c\u3092\u51fa\u3057\u307e\u3057\u305f\u3002\u3042\u306a\u305f\u306f\u305d\u308c\u3092\u805e\u304d\u3064\u3051\u305f\u540d\u3046\u3066\u306e\u541f\u904a\u8a69\u4eba\u3002\u53e4\u4eca\u6771\u897f\u306e\u304a\u4f3d\u8a71\u3092\u3046\u307e\u304f\u7e4b\u3044\u3067\u3001\u738b\u69d8\u3092\u9b45\u4e86\u3057\u307e\u3057\u3087\u3046\u3002<br/><br/>\u30bf\u30ed\u30c3\u30c8\u30ab\u30fc\u30c9\uff08\u5927\u30a2\u30eb\u30ab\u30ca\uff09\u306e\u69cb\u6210\u3092\u305d\u306e\u307e\u307e\u306b\u3001\u8272\u306e\u8981\u7d20\u3092\u53d6\u308a\u5165\u308c\u308b\u3053\u3068\u3067\u9078\u629e\u304c\u60a9\u307e\u3057\u3044\u30ab\u30fc\u30c9\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u3078\u9032\u5316\u3055\u305b\u307e\u3057\u305f\u3002\u304a\u8a71\u304c\u30ae\u30ea\u30ae\u30ea\u3067\u7e4b\u304c\u308b\u7db1\u6e21\u308a\u306e\u9023\u7d9a\u306b\u3042\u306a\u305f\u306f\u8208\u596e\u3092\u899a\u3048\u308b\u3053\u3068\u3067\u3057\u3087\u3046\u3002<br/><br/>\u57fa\u672c\u7684\u306a\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u306e\u6d41\u308c\u306f\uff12\u679a\u306e\u624b\u672d\u306e\u5185\u3001\u3069\u3061\u3089\u3092\u5834\u306b\u51fa\u3059\u306e\u304b\u3001\u306e\u7e70\u308a\u8fd4\u3057\u3067\u3059\u3002\u30ab\u30fc\u30c9\u3092\u5168\u3066\u51fa\u3057\u304d\u3063\u305f\u6642\u306b\u30e9\u30a6\u30f3\u30c9\u304c\u7d42\u308f\u308a\u3001\u914d\u7f6e\u306b\u5bfe\u3057\u5f97\u70b9\u304c\u51fa\u307e\u3059\u3002\uff11\u5468\u76ee\u306e\u914d\u7f6e\u3092\u4e00\u90e8\u5f15\u304d\u7d99\u304e\u3001\uff12\u5468\u76ee\u304c\u59cb\u307e\u308a\u307e\u3059\u3002\u8a08\uff12\u5468\u3057\u305f\u7dcf\u5f97\u70b9\u304c\u3042\u306a\u305f\u306e\u30b9\u30b3\u30a2\u3068\u306a\u308a\u307e\u3059\u3002<br/><br/>"}, "186768": {"rpgartist": ["(Uncredited)"], "rpgitemversion": ["HTML Version"], "statistics": [], "name": "ORK: l'Ultime Outrage", "rpgdesigner": ["Ghislain Morel"], "rpgproducer": ["Ghislain Morel"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2720566.jpg", "usersrated": "0", "average": "0", "rpggenre": ["Fantasy"], "rpgpublisher": ["(Web published)"], "rpg": ["ORK: l'Ultime Outrage"], "rpgcategory": ["Core Rules (min needed to play)"], "poll": [], "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2720566_t.jpg", "description": "User summary:<br/><br/>This French-language role-playing game finds players creating and running Orks as they try to survive in a dangerous world overrun by humans.<br/><br/>Characters have four Physical Attributes (la Puissance, l'Endurance, l'Agilit&eacute;, and la Dext&eacute;rit&eacute;) and four Mental Attributes (l&rsquo;Intelligence, la Volont&eacute;, la Perception, and le Charisme).

Characteristics (Attributes) have a numeric score ranging from 1-24, with 11-14 being average.  Characters have several Secondary Characteristics, most of which are derived.  Characters also generate a list of Skills with associated Ratings.  The Skills are detailed in two separate HTML pages; they are assigned to genre groups, and sometimes assigned to specific nationalities or time periods as well.  Skills are usually divided into &quot;secondary&quot; applications and, particularly in combat, even further divided into &quot;tertiary&quot; applications.  Characters may have specialized ability in a secondary or tertiary application.<br/><br/>Various &quot;supplemental&quot; abilities (psionic, magic, super powers) are grouped under Paranormal Skills.  These Paranormal Skills have additional complications compared to standard Skills.  The heavy support for these types of abilities indicates the system's investment in the fantasy genres.  Combat is generally simple but does offer added complexity through numerous options and maneuvers.

The diabolical Doctor Necreaux has captured the world's top scientists and forced them to build a Doomsday Device. Your mission: Explore the Doctor's secret island lair, find the scientists, and escape in your shuttlecraft before the island is blown to Kingdom Come!<br/><br/>In this simultaneous action game, players take one turn together as a team. At the start of each turn, you decide whether you're exploring or resting. When you explore you declare a speed, which represents how quickly you're exploring the island adventure deck and determines how many encounters your team will attempt to resolve this turn. You want to draw as many cards as you can because the scientists are hidden somewhere in the middle of the adventure deck, the escape shuttle is hidden in the bottom, and you have a limited number of turns before the island blows up. However, you can't be too fast or you'll fall prey to one of the island's many traps. If you choose to rest, your team gets to heal up and recharge.<br/><br/>The Island of Doctor Necreaux incorporates creative ability manipulation (in assessing how player powers interact and applying them appropriately), press-your-luck (when selecting a speed and during combat), and resource management (deciding when to use charges - a scarce resource that fuels agent powers - and when to use a turn to rest instead of explore).

Mage's greatest rules-based asset - its flexible, personalized magick system - can also, bluntly speaking, be a royal pain in the ass when you're trying to translate Sphere Ranks and Arete levels into &quot;I turn him into a newt; how long until he gets better?&quot;<br/><br/>We present this book in an effort to minimize the headaches when your mages warp the fabric of reality.<br/><br/>The Arts are theoretically infinite. Even so, certain classic bits turn up again and again in mystic legends and Mage chronicles. And although the Common Magickal Effects chart in Chapter Ten of Mage 20th Anniversary Edition reveals the basic Spheres involved in many classic acts of magick, the following entries can answer questions and suggest possibilities for certain elaborate feats of Awakened Will.<br/><br/>How Do You DO That? cannot, of course, reflect every possible act of magick you and your fellow players can imagine. Nor should it. Part of the fun of Mage: The Ascension involves clever acts of imagination. Each mage has her own way of doing things, and each Mage player employs an individual approach to magick. You'll come up with things we hadn't even dreamed of. Even so, this book features a wide array of magickal feats - transformation, influence, martial arts, and so on.<br/><br/>This is not a book of spells or a collection of rotes; instead, it's an assortment of feats and tricks that mages of all kinds might employ in one form or another. Rather than having a Hermetic summoning ritual entry, for example, this book has a section that deals with many aspects of Summoning, Binding, Bargaining, and Warding - the basic systems, the essential Traits, the game systems involved when making a pact with an Umbral entity, and the tactics smart mages use in order to avoid having their Awakened asses kicked into some Otherworldly hell by the entity in question. Although most of the basic feats can be found on the Common Magickal Effects section in Mage 20, Chapter Ten, this book offers more detailed guidelines for the rolls, Traits, long-term consequences, and so forth that tend to be involved with those various feats.<br/><br/>Unlike most Mage books, How Do You DO That? is strictly business. Aside from bits of flavor text that show appropriate glimpses into a mage's world, there's no setting or character information offered here. Instead, we deal simply with the game systems involved. Our tone may be playful or snarky in places, but we aim to be straightforward whenever possible here and save the poetry for other occasions.<br/><br/>"}, "186815": {"boardgamedesigner": ["Kotaro Ichien"], "average": "7.2", "poll": [], "name": "The Long March 1934-1935", "playingtime": "15", "minplayers": "3", "boardgamemechanic": ["Set Collection"], "yearpublished": "2014", "usersrated": "5", "maxplayers": "5", "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2721382_t.jpg", "boardgameartist": ["Kotaro Ichien"], "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["\u9bd6\u66f8\u5e97 (Saba Shoten)"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2721382.jpg", "boardgameversion": ["Japanese first edition"], "maxplaytime": "0", "boardgamecategory": ["Card Game", "Civil War", "Political"], "age": "8", "minplaytime": "15", "description": "\u9577\u5f81 (The Long March 1934-1935)  is a card game based on the historical event of &quot;the Long March&quot; - the 1934 campaign of the Chinese Communist Party Red Army.<br/><br/>Players play roles of five generals of the Red Army and collect cards which represent political influences upon the party leaders such as Mao Zedong, Zhou Enlai, etc.<br/><br/>The artwork was drawn by the designer, working from old propaganda photographs of the period.<br/><br/>"}, "186816": {"image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2986533.jpg", "poll": [], "boardgamedesigner": ["Felix Mertikat"], "statistics": [], "yearpublished": "2015", "maxplayers": "8", "boardgameartist": ["Felix Mertikat"], "boardgamepublisher": ["King Racoon Games"], "maxplaytime": "30", "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2986533_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "20", "boardgamecategory": ["Animals", "Card Game", "Expansion for Base-game", "Fighting", "Humor", "Racing"], "description": "Promo Role<br/><br/>From the card:<br/><br/>Bewegung 3<br/>Kampf 2<br/><br/>Anstatt eine Vergabekarte auszuspielen, darfst du eine zweite Egoistenkarte ausspielen.<br/><br/>Movement 3<br/>Fight 2<br/><br/>Instead of playing an Allocation Card you are allowed to play a second Ego Card.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "4", "boardgameversion": ["German edition"], "age": "10", "name": "Sch\u00e4ferst\u00fcndchen: Rumpelstilzchen", "playingtime": "30", "average": "6", "boardgameexpansion": ["Sch\u00e4ferst\u00fcndchen"], "usersrated": "1", "boardgamefamily": ["Animals: Sheep"]}, "186819": {"rpgartist": ["Robert Altbauer", "Peter Bergting", "Andrew DeFelice"], "rpgitemversion": ["PDF Version"], "poll": [], "name": "Rogues in Remballo (5E)", "rpgdesigner": ["Matthew Finch"], "rpgproducer": ["Matthew Finch", "Jeff Harkness", "Charles Wright (I)"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2722783.png", "usersrated": "1", "rpgsetting": ["The Lost Lands"], "average": "7", "statistics": [], "rpg": ["5e Game System Product (D&D 5th Edition Compatible)"], "rpgpublisher": ["Frog God Games"], "rpgcategory": ["Scenario / Adventure / Module"], "rpggenre": ["Fantasy (High Fantasy)", "Fantasy (Sword & Sorcery)"], "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2722783_t.png", "description": "From the Module Cover:<br/><br/>Rogues in Remballo is a Swords &amp; Wizardry adventure for 4&ndash;6 first level characters, a city adventure that gets the characters embroiled in strange plots, sinister intrigue, and fierce battles.

So Pandemic Play was born.<br/><br/>In Pandemic Play, we introduce an organized play environment where every Survivor can join an international community to simulate a worldwide zombie apocalypse scenario.  You and your friends now decide the fate of not only your town, but potentially the world!<br/><br/>Pandemic Play Regions<br/><br/>Be The Resistance!<br/><br/>Find an Action Ranger (or recruit one from your ranks) and play epic events to see how you can survive.  You can play yourself as a character (which is the recommended way to play Pandemic Play), or you can build a character to use throughout the season.<br/><br/>Players get plenty of perks for season memberships.  First of all, their in-game progress will go towards the defense of their Region, which changes month to month as the various groups do what it takes to survive.  In addition to that, players will be given various exclusive reference cards that they can take to any organized play group to ensure that your character has access to the same gear and character traits that they have earned from any other session.<br/><br/>Lastly, at the end of the season, players will automatically get a digital companion of the season&rsquo;s events so they can be replayed.  This also includes short stories that can detail notable events as relayed to us by our Action Rangers.

Each section attempts to convey the feel and simplicity of the Roleplaying system; however, there may be some spots that will confuse players. To help you along, Faight Industries offers a Facts Forum (FF) to all registered users. All you need to do is register the Paradox rules and you will be eligible for all the benefits of registered users, including support.<br/><br/>The Basic Rulebook handles all the rules that Players need to be familiar with in order to enjoy the game. As they become more familiar with the system they may wish to explore the more expanded rules of the Advanced Rulebook.

You can use stations if you wish.<br/><br/>There is an extra set of cards for the &quot;cities&quot;, each with a value to be earned by visiting that &quot;city&quot;. These cards are dealt/picked up alongwith tickets in the same quantity and with the same 'keep/dispose' rules. Some of the cards give you extra facilities to complete your tickets. There are also up to 9 bonuses for the end-of-game scoring.<br/><br/>The board does not have any grey tracks or parallel tracks, though there are limited selective options for these.  There are hikes and flights in addition to the train rides.<br/><br/>The main new rule is the option to discard 5 cards and pick up 5 new ones, as your turn. This is very useful if you are desperate for engines or a particular colour card. You can also call time when your wagon stock reaches 3, if you want, giving you the advantage of stopping other players completing tickets.

A mythic secure shelter is not only larger, more comfortable, and far more secure, but can also be made to grow legs and move about at the caster&rsquo;s command. A mythic sepia snake sigil is far more persistent than the non-mythic version, and can be used to also poison the victim, to be reusable after being triggered, or even to hold victims in suspended animation indefinitely. Mythic shadow conjuration and shadow evocation can replicate the effects of mythic spells (even if you don&rsquo;t know the mythic versions of those spells), while mythic shrink item can miniaturize even entire buildings and other structures, shrinking all the creatures inside along with them.

The game describes several but notes that characters can select any Abilities they want; they are just a narrative tag describing an Ability that the character has.  Attributes may be General, Specific, or Exact.  While General Abilities offer a wide range of capability, Specific and Exact Abilities grant a discard bonus (see below).  Samples General Abilities are:  melee combat, ranged combat, dodging.  Sample Specific Abilities are: melee combat - swords, ranged combat - guns, dodging - ranged weapons.  Sample Exact Abilities are:  melee combat - katana, ranged combat - M16, dodging: bullets.  Characters assign a number of &quot;cards&quot; to each ability from an ability array of 5, 4, 4, 3, 3, 3, 2, 2, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, and 1.<br/><br/>Damage and health are narrative and proceed through several stages from Uninjured to Dead with five injury levels in between.  Characters gain experience and can spend the experience by gaining another &quot;card&quot; on an existing ability or by gaining a new &quot;one card&quot; ability.<br/><br/>When a character attempts a non-trivial action the player draws a hand of five cards and then plays the number of cards indicated by the relevant Ability's &quot;card&quot; score (1 through 5).  If the score is above five (or if the Attribute is Specific or Exact) the character may perform a discard and draw, as is done in draw poker, to attempt a better hand.

Early game chapters deal with role-playing from an introductory perspective.  The game uses fairly unique terminology to refer to fairly standard role-playing aspects (for example, the Game Master is referred to as the Director).  Character creation is inordinately complex and heavily numeric; task resolution is fairly simple.  Generally, tasks are resolved by rolling 1d10 and adding a modifier, then comparing the result to a target difficulty.  Determining which modifier to use may be problematic.<br/><br/>Character creation begins with Personality Factors which are intended to guide the character's action during the game.  There are ten Personality Factors and each one has a pair of sub-factors.  Personality Factors always have a Rating of 10, but those points are distributed among the two sub-factors in any combination from 1:9 through 5:5 to 9:1, indicating how extreme the behavior of that Personality Factor should be.  The Personality Factors are Brave/Cowardly; Caution/Impulsive; Energetic/Indolent; Extrovert/Introvert; Forgiving/Vengeful; Gentle/Cruel; Honest/Deceitful; Modest/Proud; Optimist/Pessimist; and Trusting/Suspicious.<br/><br/>Characters next have ten Primary Characteristics divided into Mental and Physical Sets.  The Mental Set includes Determination, Education, Intelligence, Intuition, and Presence.  The Physical Set includes Dexterity, Essence, Physique, Stamina, and Strength.  All Primary Characteristics start at 1 and the player then distributes 20 additional points among the Mental Set and 20 additional points among the Physical Set.  If any Primary Characteristic is ever reduced to zero the character dies.  Characters next have several Secondary Characteristics which are either randomly generated, derived from Primary Characteristics, or purchased from a points pool.  Secondary Characteristics include Age, Height, Initiative, Kick, Life, Load, Mass, Punch, Speed, and Throw.<br/><br/>Characters next have Abilities (normally called Skills in typical RPGs).  All characters have at least on Ability and most characters will have more.  Abilities are divided into Career Abilities and Life Abilities.  Abilities have a Rating ranging from 1 to 5 and are purchased from a point pool.  Abilities also have Concentrations (specific areas of expertise within the Ability), Designates (a particular area the Concentration covers), and Specializations (specific areas of expertise within the Concentration).

The players turn cards to determine what letter of the scale to move to.

Players grab a handful of mixed marbles (black, white, and a few red) and then as the Game Master outlines the narrative, characters determine success or failure by playing (discarding) either a white or black marble, respectively.  Another player may then play a red marble to reverse the decision.  Players don't get to grab another handful of marbles until they've played out the first handful--including red ones.<br/><br/>Character creation is exceptionally simple and involves defining Attributes and then arranging them across a dice number spread.  When an action is taken, the player rolls a dice, finds the Attribute, and must proceed to resolve the situation in that manner (e.g., using that Attribute).  The GM narrates the campaign; the players narrate the action scenes.<br/><br/>"}, "186999": {"rpgartist": ["(Uncredited)"], "rpg": ["Fudge"], "statistics": [], "name": "Epitaph", "rpgdesigner": ["Vincent Diakuw"], "rpgproducer": ["Vincent Diakuw"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2726327.jpg", "usersrated": "0", "rpgitemversion": ["PDF Version 1.0", "PDF Version 1.1"], "average": "0", "rpggenre": ["Fantasy"], "rpgpublisher": ["(Web published)"], "rpgcategory": ["Alternate Rules (Variant Core Rules)", "Campaign Setting (game world)"], "poll": [], "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2726327_t.jpg", "description": "User summary:<br/><br/>Epitaph is a campaign setting for the Fudge system.
