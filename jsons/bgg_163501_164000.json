The player with the most stock of a particular company in his possession acts as the president of this company and is responsible for track laying, the placement of railheads (which are necessary for train runs), route selection and train acquisition. Running trains earns money and this money is either divided by the shareholders or kept in the company's treasure for further investments (like buying better trains or constructing track). This decision influences the value of the company's shares - and not the player with the most stock or the most beautiful constructed track wins the game, but the player with the most riches in terms of cash and shares.<br/><br/>18CZ is unique as it uses three different corporation sizes, 5 small companies with 50%-25%-25% shares, 5 medium companies with 40%-20%-20%-20% shares and 5 big companies with the usual 20%-10%-10%-10%-10%-10%-10%-10%-10% share distribution.

Since the system itself was based upon RPG &quot;technology&quot; already more than 20 years old, &quot;backwards compatibility&quot; often meant sticking with the familiar, even if tradition was filled with cobwebs and decades-old assumptions. Pathfinder Unchained dares to take a fresh look at the system itself, altering some of the fundamentals of the game and giving fresh optional takes on classic rules. Inside this collection of alternate rules and options you'll find completely redesigned versions of the barbarian, monk, rogue, and summoner classes. Delve into a new system for resolving player actions designed to speed play and dispel confusion. Many of the new systems (such as the revised classes) work seamlessly with the existing Pathfinder rules. Even the most staunchly traditionalist player will appreciate the book's math-lite system for on-the-fly monster creation and the new system for generating dynamic magic items that go far beyond a simple +1 to add lore and interest to the campaign. Players will love the book's new resource pool for martial characters, allowing for exciting new tactical options, as well as the robust new system that allows spellcasters to modify their spells with powerful spell components.<br/><br/>This 256 page hardcover addition to the Pathfinder Roleplaying Game is designed to be used by GMs and players that want to change the way their game is played.

In GUILD HUNTERS you play a member of a guild in the human city of Council Bluffs. In Council Bluffs reputation is everything - you you need to gain lots. Without reputation no one takes you for a person or a guild and with too much reputation people and guilds come looking for you to build there own reputation on taking you out. Reputation becomes almost a catch-22 where you need it and then you have to defend it.<br/><br/>The game uses a new 3d12 system for the rules. There are 7 main attributes and each main attribute has 2 sub attributes to it. The sub attributes cover the skills and the main attributes cover magic defense and other random things.<br/><br/>Magic in the game is free flowing. There are no magic points or spells to remember. Magic is a big part of this world and everyone in the world can cast magic, though many do not or if they do only simple spells. If you fail a spell by 1 or more you take half the affect of the spell.

The shadows of the past have been driven away, and the dark clouds at the horizon appear to be man-made. After the Great Netherwar, which resulted in the destruction of Earth, mankind is restless, scattered across the void, bereft of its cradle. The Sol system became the last safe hideout for outcasts both mystic and mundane. Known as Vagrants, they are rebels to the oppressive might of the Consortium&mdash;the government ruling over what&rsquo;s left of Earth and its colonies.

Any poison that didn&rsquo;t do Constitution damage was a nuisance, not a threat, and poisons and diseases alike were treated as something for the cleric to wave away between combats with a convenient spell or two. Add to that the fact that few poisons and diseases have DCs high enough to be much of a challenge after 5th level or so, and that neither poisons nor diseases generally have any effect more interesting than ability damage, and the result is an entire component of the game that many players and GMs learn to avoid out of habit.<br/><br/>This book attempts to completely re-imagine poisons and diseases from the ground up, and creates an entirely new system of rules to handle them. Most of the basic elements of the poisons and diseases presented in the Pathfinder Roleplaying Game Core Rulebook are still present: you still make saving throws to resist their effects, and those effects are bad. Beyond that, though, the differences start to exceed the similarities. Both enhanced diseases and enhanced poisons (the terms for the new versions of these afflictions presented by this book) have multiple stages, and affect their victims differently in different stages. In addition to the effect, which is suffered when a saving throw is failed, as with normal diseases and poisons, each stage also has a symptom, a constant effect that applies for as long as the subject is in that stage, regardless of whether he or she succeeds on saving throws or not.<br/><br/>Of course, in reality, poisons and diseases are quite different from one another, and this is reflected here as well: enhanced diseases have new rules regarding how contagious they are, while, poisons have a toxicity rating, which measures how much of the poison is present in the victim&rsquo;s body: the rising and falling of toxicity causes the poison to progress to different stages. Enhanced diseases and enhanced poisons also have CRs, and grant XP to characters that survive them. Enhanced poisons have rules for buying and crafting them, making them easily accessible to PCs.<br/><br/>In addition to all of these new rules, 100 new enhanced diseases and poisons are also provided (50 of each), ranging from CR 1 all the way to CR 20. Healers will have their hands full with every disease imaginable, from minor nuisances like swamp cough and salamander chills, to the exotic witch pox (which cause the victim to polymorph uncontrollably) or midden sickness (which causes you to release pheromones that attract swarms of vermin), to the truly deadly diseases like apocalypse spores and lillend&rsquo;s revenge, while assassins will rejoice at a wealth of new poisons, from the simple knock-out poison, the specialized, like shifter&rsquo;s bane (which returns shapeshifters to their natural form and harms them if they try to change back), or the inevitable, like diamond dust, which is all but impossible to cure, and so much more.<br/><br/>Imagine a world where poisons and diseases are as fun and engaging as combat encounters.

The teleports have been silent for a millenia, and just recently a way to restart them was discovered. But there is a problem: as the ringworld broke into pieces and the teleports lost their connection to one another, there is no way of knowing what lies on the other side of a teleportal.

Others are frequent travelers between worlds, either physically like the wily witchwyrds and the mighty xanthos, or by sending their thoughts out among the cosmos like the contemplative. Some alien races usually remain on their own worlds, ruling kingdoms or clanholds like the soaring dragonkin and the gun-toting shobhad, while the mysterious flumph searches out dangerous invaders from beyond the tapestry of night. Some alien invaders simply seed worlds with dangerous propagation, like the spiny lunarma or the towering moonflower, but others are far more sinister, like the apocalyptic akata plagues or the insidious incursions of intellect devourers. The brand-new qomok is an alien THING that can absorb and assimilate the aspects of virtually anything, taking the semblance of other living things long enough to invade and spread its deadly seed like an all-consuming virus.<br/><br/>On top of these extraterrestrial enemies, Mythic Monsters: Aliens also introduces the alien subtype to help characterize creatures from planets beyond your own, notes on alien magic items, and 10 alien-themed spells (including mythic and non-mythic versions of the brand-new identify technology spell to help make sense of those alien artifacts your PCs are bound to discover).

Players make compound words or phrases from a set of word cards to satisfy a mission. The dealer decides which of the submissions is Good, which is Bad, and which is Funny, and rewards the players appropriately (3, -2 and 5 points respectively). The first to 21 (or -10) wins.<br/><br/>There are three main differences between The Good, The Bad &amp; The Funny and other Apples-style games:<br/><br/>The three main differences are:<br/><br/>1. Scoring. Apples games with strangers can be aggravating - will they choose the funny card or the clever one? Or the realistic one? Or just choose something terrible.<br/><br/>The dealer always has to choose The Good, The Bad &amp; The Funny.<br/><br/>The Good is the best representation of the mission card. It&rsquo;s worth three points because, while good, it&rsquo;s boring and obvious. And you probably had the perfect card, so whatever.<br/><br/>The Bad is the worst submission that round. It&rsquo;s worth negative two because I&rsquo;m sick of players constantly ditching cards instead of actually thinking about a good answer. You&rsquo;ll also notice that many of the players that think they are funny will end up with a lot of bad answers.<br/><br/>The Funny gets the biggest laugh. Subjective, of course, but it&rsquo;s worth five points for entertaining the room.<br/><br/>The first to (or above) 21 points wins, unless there is a tie, in which case play continues as normal until a single player has the highest score.<br/><br/>There&rsquo;s another small twist, which is that players can also win by scoring -10 points. This makes it a bit more fun to be chosen for that bad answer in round 1.<br/><br/>2. Players always play two cards. This is a game about compound words and phrases. Our lives are surrounded by such combinations - you&rsquo;ll start to notice much more after reading this sentence. Creating compound words and phrases is a wonderful challenge - it forces players to think about the many ways that a word can be interpreted and manipulated by another word. And the essence of this game is a carefully created wordlist that is composed of the most commonly occurring bits from compound words and phrases in the English language, almost all of which are nouns.<br/><br/>There are a couple of key benefits to this approach. Most answers are not reliant on a shared understanding of pop. Many other Apples games assume a certain level of 21st Century culture familiarity while the word cards from The Good, The Bad &amp; The Funny are timeless (the mission cards, however, do have a bit of pop-infusion). Answers won&rsquo;t get stale, as the likelihood of a one playing the same combination twice within a play session or many, many play sessions is infinitely low. Even playing the same word card won&rsquo;t have the same negative effect as in other games because it is about how two cards react together, not simply a funny reference. Even if the same two cards are played together, the order can be changed to dramatically alter the meaning.<br/><br/>The game is very replayable without the need for many, many expansions.<br/><br/>3. At any given time, three mission cards are face up. Dealers get to choose which mission they want to judge, which allows for another layer of strategy. Players can hold onto cards that match future possible missions (don&rsquo;t you hate throwing out the perfect card right before getting the matching mission?).<br/><br/>"}, "163563": {"boardgamedesigner": {"77176": {"name": "Antonio Crepax"}}, "average": "4.41538", "poll": {}, "name": "Valentina: The Game \u2013 Tutto Crepax Vol. 1", "playingtime": "15", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": {"2047": "Memory"}, "yearpublished": "2014", "usersrated": "13", "maxplayers": "6", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2155813_t.jpg", "boardgameartist": {"6322": "Guido Crepax"}, "statistics": {}, "boardgamepublisher": {"10768": {"name": "Cranio Creations"}}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2155813.jpg", "boardgameversion": {"247887": "English/Italian first edition"}, "maxplaytime": "15", "boardgamecategory": {"1045": {"name": "Memory"}}, "age": "10", "minplaytime": "15", "description": "Valentina: The Game &ndash; Tutto Crepax Vol. 1 includes 96 color tiles and 16 subject cards featuring the art of Guido Crepax with two memory-style games included in the rules:<br/><br/>&bull; In &quot;Crazy Valentina&quot; all players simultaneously try to find the six color tiles comprising their subject card in the pile of face-down tiles placed in a 12x8 grid.

These Episodes were written by Margaret Weis, Andrew Peregrine, Monica Valentinelli, and Nicole Wakelin. Featured artists include Ben Mund, Beth Sobel, Jennifer Rodgers, Kurt Komoda, and Melissa Gay!<br/><br/>Included in this compilation you will receive a single PDF with the following five FIREFLY RPG Cortex Plus releases, which are all available separately here on DriveThruRPG.com:<br/><br/>     Serenity Crew - Serenity Crew allows you to spend your days playing Mal, Zoe, Wash, Kaylee, Inara, Jayne, Simon, Book, or River. If you&rsquo;re the type that wants to try something new, take a gander at the twelve archetypes we&rsquo;re offering you, too. If the math&rsquo;s right, that&rsquo;s twenty-one different options for you to play a character in the &lsquo;Verse. The rules in this release were expanded upon in the Firefly RPG corebook. Written by Monica Valentinelli and Cam Banks.<br/>     Wedding Planners - During the War, some folks chose a side and others pitted the Alliance and the Independents against each other for fun and profit. Well, mostly profit. Enter Templeton Steele, a powerful weapons designer whose bride-to-be is none other than the lovely Liliana Fairchild. Now, on account of these two lovebirds getting hitched, you and your crew are hired to transport Lilly to a fancy ship called the Rim&rsquo;s Dream. Sounds easy enough, right? Unite the happy couple and they&rsquo;ll get paid? Only thing is, this Princess ain&rsquo;t exactly happy about the wedding. The more you find out, the worse this job gets &ndash; and the less chance you have of getting paid. Written by Margaret Weis.<br/>     Shooting Fish - The War may be over, but there&rsquo;re still plenty of bad people looking to do bad things, and they don&rsquo;t seem to need war as an excuse to come after their fellow man neither. Some folk will happily turn out a bunch of orphans to make themselves a few coins. Buzzard Lake is one such fella, but like all men he&rsquo;s got a weakness. He don&rsquo;t like to lose. That&rsquo;s where you and your crew come in. Lake needs to learn what second place feels like, and you&rsquo;re gonna teach him. You might even save some orphans in the bargain if he don&rsquo;t kill you first. Written by Andrew Peregrine.<br/>     Friends in Low Places - Sometimes meeting up with old friends in Serenity View is cause for celebration, but not this time. Over drinks, you and your Crew discover that Monty's new wife Daisy has gone missing. Worse, your pal thinks that Virgil Morningstar, a Guild trader with a heap of Alliance connections, had something to do with her disappearance. By the time you find out Daisy ain't the only one who's vanished, you and your Crew'll be neck-deep in trouble and hard-pressed to find your way out of it. Thing is, if you do unravel this little mystery, you'll claim a big reward and be heroes to boot. Written by Monica Valentinelli.<br/>     Freedom Flyer - Folk do what they can to scratch out a living in the &rsquo;Verse. Seems like some folk push their luck to scrape by in these tough times. Maggie Miller's bad history and rotten luck are keeping her from achievin&rsquo; her dreams. She wants to get out of the Georgia System to make a fresh start out on the Rim, but she needs three things to do it: a hidden pile of cash, a ship she&rsquo;s hidden with an old flame, Hollis Mason, and enough leftover credits to wipe Ma Millers&rsquo;s medical bills clean before she goes.  The Crew will have to dig for treasure, outwit a wily Alliance officer, and steal a ship hidden in orbit to help Maggie safely on her way. Trouble is, there&rsquo;s a kind of hitch: Hush Jackson, a tough-as-nails bounty hunter who&rsquo;s hopin&rsquo; to cash in on Maggie&rsquo;s head. Will the Crew turn Maggie over for the bounty? Or, will they help Maggie out and pray there is enough cash left over to cover their costs?<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Please note that the rules for these five Episodes may vary slightly from what we offered originally. After compiling these adventures, we rules edited each Episode and made a few tweaks. Both versions of each individual Episode are still compatible with the Firefly RPG corebook or, alternatively, may be run as a stand-alone Episode.

It is your job to defend humanity, quell the rising panic, and turn back the alien invasion.<br/><br/>Where the world's militaries have failed to stand against the alien invaders, you must succeed. To do so, you must make strategic use of the resources available to you. You must launch Interceptors to shoot down alien UFOs, assign soldiers to key missions, research alien technology, and use that technology to defend your base &mdash; all while trying to keep the world from collapsing just long enough that you can coordinate one final mission to repel the invaders for good.<br/><br/>One of the more notable aspects of XCOM: The Board Game is the way that it incorporates a free and innovative digital app into the core of its gameplay. This digital companion will be available both as a downloadable app and as an online tool.<br/><br/>The app's primary function is to coordinate the escalating alien invasion, randomly selecting from one of five different invasion plans. Each invasion plan represents a general outline that the alien commanders will use to coordinate the arrival of new UFOs, plan strikes against your base, and respond to your successes or failures as it seeks to conquer Earth. The app manages all of these tasks and heightens the game's tension as it forces you to respond in real-time. Then, after you move quickly to coordinate your response, you engage the enemy in the untimed resolution phase and feed the results to the app. Based upon these results, the app launches the invasion's next strikes.<br/><br/>Additionally, the app teaches you the rules, controls the information that your satellites provide you, and tracks the progress of your resistance efforts, even as it allows you to enjoy the game at any of three levels of difficulty: Easy, Normal, or Hard.<br/><br/>The use of this app does more than simply streamline your play experience and track your turns in real-time; it also permits a uniquely dynamic turn structure. While the variety of game phases remains the same from round to round, the order in which you and your friends must play through them may change, as may the number of a given phase. As a result, while you'll want to know where UFOs appear before you deploy your Interceptors, the alien invaders may be able to disrupt your satellite intel and force you to deploy your Interceptors on patrol with limited or no knowledge of the UFOs current whereabouts. Similarly, you may be forced to think about the costs of resolving the world&rsquo;s crises before you know how many troops you&rsquo;ll need to commit to your base defense.<br/><br/>The effect of the app is to immerse you deep into the dramatic tension at the core of XCOM: The Board Game, and it ensures that the game presents a challenging and cooperative (or solo) experience like no other. Just like the XCOM department heads that you represent, you'll need to keep cool heads in order to prevail.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "1", "boardgameversion": {"247971": "English first edition"}, "name": "XCOM: The Board Game", "playingtime": "90", "boardgamemechanic": {"2023": "Co-operative Play"}, "age": "14", "boardgameexpansion": {}, "usersrated": "5260", "boardgamesubdomain": {"5496": "Thematic Games"}, "average": "7.18994"}, "163603": {"boardgamedesigner": {"1678": {"name": "Brian Train"}}, "average": "6.8", "poll": {}, "name": "Kandahar", "playingtime": "0", "minplayers": "2", "yearpublished": "2013", "usersrated": "5", "boardgamefamily": {"28241": "One Small Step Folio Series"}, "maxplayers": "3", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2402712_t.png", "boardgameartist": {"81197": "Ania B.

Players can set limits on the aggression level of the game if they desire a more peaceful experience.  There is a four player introductory game designed to introduce players to the basics of the game.

Crossover is a Flash browser-based platforming game. The game's levels and graphics are all primarily duplicates of those found in Super Mario Bros.; each of the game's eight worlds feature four levels. In three of the levels, the goal is to reach a checkpoint to complete the level, while the final level has the player facing against Bowser in hopes of rescuing Princess Peach. Enemies such as Goombas, Koopa Troopas and Hammer Bros. will block the player's attempt to make it successfully through the level. As Mario, the player can jump on enemies to kill them, use Koopa shells to knock enemies over, and acquire powerups from special blocks that serve to boost health, shoot fireballs, or remain invincible for a short period of time. Besides completing the level, the player can also earn coins and points, attempting to achieve a high score.<br/><br/>Crossover varies this formula by adding in several additional main characters in addition to Mario that the player can play. In the same manner as with Super Mario Bros. 2, the player selects one of the additional characters at the start of each level. Each character, based on other classic Nintendo Entertainment System games, uses different attacks and movements that are related to their original game, as well as their own signature music. These characters are:<br/><br/>Link, based on The Legend of Zelda, uses a sword and boomerang to attack enemies. Collecting powerups increases the potency of the sword's attacks and the range of his boomerang. He is the only character with fundamental control changes from his original game, being given the ability to jump, which wasn't possible until Zelda 2.<br/>Mega Man possesses an arm cannon which he can use to fire forward to destroy enemies, with additional powerups to increase his firepower, and has the ability to slide under small spaces. Within version 1.1, Mega Man's jump height is reduced but now has the ability to call in Rush, his robotic dog, to assist in high jumps.<br/>Samus Aran, from the Metroid games, also has a gun she can fire and which gains power with powerups. Samus is also able to transform into her &quot;morph ball&quot; form, rolling through narrow spaces and planting bombs. As of Version 1.1, the player starts off playing as Samus in her Zero-Suit, and upon the capture of a mushroom, gains her Power Suit. In Version 1.2, Samus can pick up missiles when enemies are defeated. Each missile sprite icon gives Samus 2 missiles.<br/>Simon Belmont, the protagonist of the early Castlevania games, has a whip and can throw axes at foes, the attack strength and number of axes on screen increasing with additional powerups. He has the ability to double jump, which he doesn't have in the original games. His jump was also modified to be easier to control than the original games but can be changed back in the options with Classic mode.<br/>Bill Rizer, one of the playable characters in Contra use a gun to fire on enemies, which increases in power and spread with further powerups. He can shoot in 8 directions, even when jumping.<br/>Ryu Hayabusa from Ninja Gaiden was added in the version 1.1 release. Ryu, as a ninja, is able to use a sword and throwing stars, and has the ability to climb and jump walls.<br/>Sophia the 3rd, the tank vehicle from Blaster Master, was added in the version 1.2 release. Sophia's capabilities include hovering, clinging to walls and ceilings, and homing missiles, but is also the first character with a limited amount of ammunition and power, requiring the player to refill these capacities through collection from defeated foes.<br/>Luigi, Mario's brother from the Super Mario Bros. series was introduced in version 2.0. Luigi uses his gameplay from Super Mario Bros. The Lost Levels, being able to jump higher but not run as fast as Mario. He is also more slippery than Mario which makes it harder to avoid enemies and pitfalls.<br/>Bass, from Mega Man 10, was introduced in version 2.0 and has similar play to Mega Man, but his arm cannon acts differently, being able to shoot in 7 directions. Instead of a slide, Bass has a dash that is faster than Mega Man's but cannot slide under small spaces. Like Simon, he can double jump.<br/>In the version 2.0 update, character skins were a new and unique feature that allowed all characters to look different and have new music along with them. Some skins are the same character but from a different game in their respective franchise, while others are from completely different franchises. The 3.0 update added additional character skins, special rendering modes to mimic other earlier computer gaming hardware, and levels inspired by the limited-release Super Mario Bros.

It is the first such game in almost four years, and a reboot for the series. FIFA Street was developed by some of the same team behind FIFA 12, including creative director Gary Paterson, and uses the FIFA 12 game engine.[1][2] Sid Misra, the line producer for FIFA Street, promised &quot;the first true quality street football experience.&quot;[5]<br/><br/>The game was first announced on 16 August 2011 at the Gamescom event in Germany, and was released on the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 consoles in March 2012. Along with several other new EA Sports titles, FIFA Street was available early to purchasers of the EA Sports Season Ticket.[2] Lionel Messi features on the cover after EA announced, in November 2011, that he had signed a deal to become the new face of the FIFA franchise.[6] The &quot;Adidas All-Star Team&quot; including 13 of the greatest footballers in the world and the Lionel Messi Barcelona-themed venue were available as pre-order bonus.[7] A FIFA Street demo was launched on 28 February 2012 on Xbox Live and a day later on PSN.[8]<br/><br/>In an effort to make the game more &quot;authentic&quot;, the stylised cartoon-like visuals of previous games in the series has been dropped in favour of a more realistic look, though there will still be the same emphasis on skill moves and tricks. The focus is once again on fast-paced games involving small teams of five or six players per side, one-on-one, and game modes based on panna and futsal also included.[1][3] As with the previous games in the series, skill moves are an important element of gameplay. FIFA Street features twice as many tricks as are possible in FIFA 12, with much greater variety, and over 50 more than its predecessor FIFA Street 3.[1][9][10] Other new features include improved one-touch passing, a feature called Street Ball Control, and a new &quot;ATTACK&quot; dribbling system.[2][3]<br/><br/>The game features a large number of real life players from 3000 teams of many of the world's biggest leagues, and 2012 locations from around the world ranging from the streets of Amsterdam to the beaches of Rio de Janeiro. Each of these arenas attempt to reflect the style of football played in that country. The game is the first game in the series to feature both national and club teams.[1][3][9][10]<br/><br/>The game features a World Tour mode, which lets the player create their own team, from details such as crest and team kit, to players and their individual street kits. The user then competes in competitions against the AI, after which, the total skill points each player earned in the game is tallied up in a levelling system. From levelling up players the user can use points earned to upgrade their player's skill and ability from passing to shooting to goalkeeping.

You must choose the card before you draw any cards to your hand.<br/><br/>Each Stage Card on the Seeker&rsquo;s Path has a number in the upper left representing the Amount of Time you must take to overcome the card with the Abilities you have in your hand. The pointer icon next to the number shows whether you must have a total Abilities Number either great than or exactly one less than the Amount of Time needed.<br/><br/>From the cards in your hand, discard cards to your Seeker Deck&rsquo;s discard pile, adding the Abilities Numbers in the upper left. of those you discard, to overcome the Stage Card you chose on the Seeker&rsquo;s Path. Be sure when discarding cards to keep their current orientation when placing them on the discard pile (i.e. the current Abilities Numbers should be oriented upward when placed face down on the discard pile.)<br/><br/>The Magical Objects in your hand of cards can grant you special powers during your turn. You can play a Magical Object at any time during your turn. Discard them when you use their powers.<br/><br/>If you are able to overcome the Stage Card it will either be removed from the game, temporarily grant you a temporary Abilities bonus or penalty, be set in a special pile, or be added to your discard pile depending on the card.<br/><br/>End of the Game:<br/>When the Quest Card is drawn from the Stage Deck&rsquo;s draw pile, it is added to the Seeker&rsquo;s Path and play continues normally in its final phase.<br/><br/>When the Quest Card reaches the bottommost row of the Seeker&rsquo;s Path (The Quest Card always has the highest Initiative Number when deciding what cards to move at the end of a turn) the game ends.<br/><br/>2014 Solitaire Print and Play Contest Awards<br/><br/>Best Artwork<br/>First Place<br/><br/>Best Medium Sized Game<br/>Second Place<br/><br/>Best Written Rules<br/>Second Place (Tied)<br/><br/>Most Innovative Mechanic<br/>Second Place (Tied)<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "1", "boardgameversion": {"248099": "First edition"}, "age": "12", "name": "The Seeker in the Forest of Wyr", "playingtime": "20", "boardgamemechanic": {"2041": "Card Drafting"}, "average": "6.675", "usersrated": "20", "boardgamefamily": {"5666": "Solitaire Games"}}, "163688": {"boardgamedesigner": {"42166": {"name": "Todd Sanders"}}, "average": "6.52947", "poll": {}, "name": "Six Sons of the Sultan", "playingtime": "20", "minplayers": "1", "boardgamemechanic": {"2080": "Area Control / Area Influence"}, "yearpublished": "2014", "usersrated": "19", "maxplayers": "2", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2199007_t.png", "boardgameartist": {"42166": "Todd Sanders"}, "statistics": {}, "boardgamepublisher": {"1001": {"name": "(Web published)"}}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2199007.png", "boardgameversion": {"248100": "First edition"}, "maxplaytime": "20", "boardgamecategory": {"1052": {"name": "Arabian"}}, "age": "10", "minplaytime": "20", "description": "The six sons of the Sultan have come to you, the foremost tea merchants in land, with a request: Provide us with the best exotic teas the world has to offer and we will reward you richly (we may even favor you with special privileges if you impress us), but only one of you can become Chief Tea Merchant of the Sultanate!<br/><br/>The Six Sons of the Sultan is a game for two players that takes about 15-20 minutes. Players will have 10 rounds to gain prestige by supplying different kinds of tea to the Sultan&rsquo;s sons. Each type of tea has different costs and prestige points associated with it as well as special actions that may help the players during the game.<br/><br/>There is also a solitaire play option.<br/><br/>The game uses only 9 cards, 3 dice and some eurocubes. It can be printed, however, as a single page game board<br/><br/>Phase 1 - The Dice Roll<br/>The start player begins the round by rolling all 3 dice (Note: in consecutive rounds each player will only roll two dice, having had one die passed to them previously). Once the dice are rolled they are assigned as follows:<br/><br/>One die is chosen as the Order Die, the die number corresponding to 1 of the 6 Tea Card numbers.<br/><br/>One die is then chosen as the Wealth Die, and will increase a player&rsquo;s total wealth by the amount shown on the die.<br/><br/>The final die is the Passing Die and is passed to the other player. This die is locked and may not be rolled during the next player&rsquo;s turn unless the player uses the White Tea card&rsquo;s special action.<br/><br/>Phase 2 - The Tea Order<br/>The player may now place orders on the Tea Card that matches the Order Die&rsquo;s number, thus pleasing one of the Sultan&rsquo;s sons. A player may move their eurocube token up the card&rsquo;s track as many spaces as they are able to pay for (the bottom number denotes the price), moving their token on the Wealth card accordingly. If a player has (0) wealth they may not place an order this turn.<br/><br/>Spaces on the track also have a Prestige Point value which is totalled up at the end of the game (the top number shown for the space).<br/><br/>Certain marked spaces also allow the player to use the Special Action of that card. If a player can afford to move their token up a number of spaces, passing more than one Special Action space, only the final space landed on is counted. The space must be landed on to use the Special Action. The player does not have to use the Special Action if they do not want to.<br/><br/>Phase 3 - Wealth Gained<br/>The player may now move their Wealth token the number of spaces as indicated on the Wealth Die.<br/><br/>The player&rsquo;s turn is now over and the opposing player takes the remaining two dice and rolls them to begin their turn.<br/><br/>Once both players have had a turn, the round is over, the round token is moved down one space on the Time Card and a new round begins.<br/><br/>Game End<br/>Play continues for a total of 10 rounds. When the 10th round is finished, players add up their respective Prestige Points to determine who will be the Chief Tea Merchant of the Sultanate. If the game ends in a tie, the player with the most accrued wealth is the winner.<br/><br/>"}, "163689": {"statistics": {}, "name": "Pathways (Issue 41 - Aug 2014)", "rpgproducer": {"45951": "David Paul"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2196112.png", "usersrated": "0", "average": "0", "rpgissue": {"9834": "Pathways"}, "rpgissuearticle": {"125495": "Deep Dragon Creature Template"}, "rpg": {"2791": "Pathfinder System Compatible Product"}, "rpgissueversion": {"248102": "PDF"}, "poll": {}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2196112_t.png", "description": "Pathways<br/>Issue #41<br/>August 2014<br/><br/>Cover by John Morrow<br/><br/>"}, "163691": {"statistics": {}, "name": "Viktor Kalvachev's BLUE ESTATE the game", "videogamemode": {"2313": "Cooperative"}, "videogameversion": {"248116": "PSN PlayStation 4 Downloadable edition"}, "average": "6.5", "videogametheme": {"2353": "Morbid"}, "usersrated": "2", "videogamegenre": {"2167": "Shooter"}, "videogameplatform": {"21674": "PlayStation 4"}, "poll": {}, "description": "He is the one and only son of Don Luciano, the boss of the West Coast Cosa Nostra, located in Los Angeles.

Teamwork is the key to victory, for if you can't trust your fellow players none of you will reach the CDC... alive!<br/><br/>Dead Apocalypse is a fully cooperative deckbuilding game, meaning all players strive for the same goal and either win together or lose together. Players will begin the game with the same starting decks consisting of a handful of survivors, a base camp location and some equipment. Players will take turns playing their hand to gain damage, occupy locations, use abilities and cure infections. Gaining damage allows the player to defeat ghastly Zombies who are protecting invaluable equipment, or surrounding a location, or even trapping other survivors. Once a Zombie is defeated, add the resources to your personal deck to be used for another turn. Though don't think Zombies will go down without a fight. The Zombie stack of cards holds surprise attack events which will force a player to have to defeat Zombies that match the type of event. If a player does not have the sufficient resources to defeat all Zombies, other players have the opportunity to assist in combat to help even the odds!<br/><br/>Dead Apocalypse is  1-4 players so if there isn't someone in your company you still have the opportunity to try to fight for survival all alone.

Banks of turbolasers unleash torrential volleys of fire against squadrons of X-wing and TIEs. Engineering teams race to route additional power to failing shields. Laser blasts and explosions flare across the battlefield. Even a single ship can change the tide of battle.<br/><br/>In Star Wars: Armada, you assume the role of fleet admiral, serving with either the Imperial Navy or Rebel Alliance. You assemble your fleet and engage the enemy. Using the game&rsquo;s unique maneuver tool, you steer your capital ships across the battlefield, even while squadrons of starfighters buzz around them. Then, as these ships exchange fire, it&rsquo;s your job to issue the tactical commands that will decide the course of battle and, perhaps, the fate of the galaxy.<br/><br/>Maneuver Tool<br/>The maneuver tool is one of the game&rsquo;s most innovative features and adds a unique feel to the way your capital ships must accommodate for inertia as they maneuver through the stars.<br/><br/>It consists of a number of segments linked with hinges, which is used to plot the ship's course. More nimble ships are allowed to turn the ship further at each hinge.<br/><br/>Command Stack<br/>Armada balances the awesome scale of the Star Wars galaxy&rsquo;s ships and space warfare with intuitive ship designs and accessible rules for issuing commands and resolving combat that make for rich, engaging, and highly tactical play experiences.<br/><br/>Capital ships are extremely powerful war machines, but they&rsquo;re also massive and sophisticated vessels that can&rsquo;t swiftly react to every development in the heat of battle. Accordingly, the key to flying these vessels effectively is learning how to plan ahead. You want to issue your commands in such a way that your crews will be ready to execute them at just the right times.<br/><br/>Each of your pre-painted capital ships has a command value, which determines how many commands it will have in its stack at any given point in time.

For that, you can turn to a mythic heritage. This new aspect of mythic characters allows for further customization of your mythic character. A mythic character can choose a mythic heritage in addition to his or her mythic path, and doing so grants him access to a number of unique abilities that are designed to reflect the flavor of his heritage, while also being of value to characters of every mythic path.<br/><br/>This installment introduces the angelic heritage, for characters whose mythic power comes from the heavenly realms and the forces of truth and justice. Many with this mythic heritage are the direct descendants of angels or other celestial beings, who may have fallen in love with the character&rsquo;s mortal parent, or who may have deliberately been attempting to bring a prophesied hero into the world. Others had their mythic power bestowed upon them by angelic forces in order to do good in the world.<br/><br/>Whatever its cause, this mythic heritage allows you to harness the great cosmic powers of the heavens. This book includes 18 new mythic abilities, which together make up the angelic mythic heritage. In addition to all of the basics of being an angel, such as a halo that sheds light and marks you as an undeniable servant of righteousness, gaining all of the standard angel immunities and resistances, gaining feathery wings, and projecting a magic circle against evil, those with this mythic heritage can also speak with the voice of a god, damaging mortals who hear, turn any weapon they touch into a powerful holy weapon, or shield their allies with their own bodies to not only protect their friends but regain mythic power by doing so, as well as numerous other heavenly powers.

In the first phase of each round, the players (in turn order) roll their dice and attempt to get the best score possible. A given die may be rerolled any number of times until a) the player accepts the number on the die or b) the die rolls a 1. If the die rolls a one, that die is locked at one for the round.<br/><br/>Once each player has their starting roll for the round, the scheming begins. Each player must choose to help or hinder an opponent with five possible outcomes (3 outcomes if there are only two players left).<br/><br/>Outcome 1 - Player A helps Player B: Player B adds 3 points to their score for the round.<br/>Outcome 2 - Player A hinders Player B: Player B subtracts 3 points.<br/>Outcome 3 - Player A helps Player B and Player B helps Player A: Each player adds 6 points.<br/>Outcome 4 - Player A hinders Player B and Player B hinders Player A: Each player subtracts 6 points.<br/>Outcome 5 - Player A helps Player B and Player B hinders Player A: Player A subtracts 6 Points and Player B adds 6 points.<br/><br/>At the end of the second phase, the player with the lowest score in the round loses a die. Players gain bonus chips adding 1 point to their score for the next round for each player with a higher score in the current round. The player with the highest score goes first next round.<br/><br/>The game ends when only one player is left with dice.

With many strategies at their disposal, players optimize four actions per turn in attempt to score the most victory points over five epochs.<br/><br/>Each player controls several medieval characters that roam the countryside tending farms, taxing towns and taking outposts in effort to rise in power.<br/><br/>But that&rsquo;s only the tip of the behemoth's horn! You will also compete to acquire coveted feudums, which increase your membership status in one of six guilds. But beware! Feudum owners must pay homage to the king through military service or face the charge of disloyalty.<br/><br/>Once a guild member, you will dutifully play your part in a progressive economic cycle, whereby the farmer ships goods to the merchant who equips the alchemist, who invents black powder, which arms the knight, and so on.<br/><br/>If you run your guilds wisely, maintain control of key locations and adapt best to changing events, you will be victorious. Unless, of course, you starve, get sidetracked by sea serpents or develop an unhealthy interest in fermented grapes.
