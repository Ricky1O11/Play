Since the system itself was based upon RPG &quot;technology&quot; already more than 20 years old, &quot;backwards compatibility&quot; often meant sticking with the familiar, even if tradition was filled with cobwebs and decades-old assumptions. Pathfinder Unchained dares to take a fresh look at the system itself, altering some of the fundamentals of the game and giving fresh optional takes on classic rules. Inside this collection of alternate rules and options you'll find completely redesigned versions of the barbarian, monk, rogue, and summoner classes. Delve into a new system for resolving player actions designed to speed play and dispel confusion. Many of the new systems (such as the revised classes) work seamlessly with the existing Pathfinder rules. Even the most staunchly traditionalist player will appreciate the book's math-lite system for on-the-fly monster creation and the new system for generating dynamic magic items that go far beyond a simple +1 to add lore and interest to the campaign. Players will love the book's new resource pool for martial characters, allowing for exciting new tactical options, as well as the robust new system that allows spellcasters to modify their spells with powerful spell components.<br/><br/>This 256 page hardcover addition to the Pathfinder Roleplaying Game is designed to be used by GMs and players that want to change the way their game is played.

Any poison that didn&rsquo;t do Constitution damage was a nuisance, not a threat, and poisons and diseases alike were treated as something for the cleric to wave away between combats with a convenient spell or two. Add to that the fact that few poisons and diseases have DCs high enough to be much of a challenge after 5th level or so, and that neither poisons nor diseases generally have any effect more interesting than ability damage, and the result is an entire component of the game that many players and GMs learn to avoid out of habit.<br/><br/>This book attempts to completely re-imagine poisons and diseases from the ground up, and creates an entirely new system of rules to handle them. Most of the basic elements of the poisons and diseases presented in the Pathfinder Roleplaying Game Core Rulebook are still present: you still make saving throws to resist their effects, and those effects are bad. Beyond that, though, the differences start to exceed the similarities. Both enhanced diseases and enhanced poisons (the terms for the new versions of these afflictions presented by this book) have multiple stages, and affect their victims differently in different stages. In addition to the effect, which is suffered when a saving throw is failed, as with normal diseases and poisons, each stage also has a symptom, a constant effect that applies for as long as the subject is in that stage, regardless of whether he or she succeeds on saving throws or not.<br/><br/>Of course, in reality, poisons and diseases are quite different from one another, and this is reflected here as well: enhanced diseases have new rules regarding how contagious they are, while, poisons have a toxicity rating, which measures how much of the poison is present in the victim&rsquo;s body: the rising and falling of toxicity causes the poison to progress to different stages. Enhanced diseases and enhanced poisons also have CRs, and grant XP to characters that survive them. Enhanced poisons have rules for buying and crafting them, making them easily accessible to PCs.<br/><br/>In addition to all of these new rules, 100 new enhanced diseases and poisons are also provided (50 of each), ranging from CR 1 all the way to CR 20. Healers will have their hands full with every disease imaginable, from minor nuisances like swamp cough and salamander chills, to the exotic witch pox (which cause the victim to polymorph uncontrollably) or midden sickness (which causes you to release pheromones that attract swarms of vermin), to the truly deadly diseases like apocalypse spores and lillend&rsquo;s revenge, while assassins will rejoice at a wealth of new poisons, from the simple knock-out poison, the specialized, like shifter&rsquo;s bane (which returns shapeshifters to their natural form and harms them if they try to change back), or the inevitable, like diamond dust, which is all but impossible to cure, and so much more.<br/><br/>Imagine a world where poisons and diseases are as fun and engaging as combat encounters.

Besides these new wonders of technology and science, some ancient and magic-like tech-treasures still exist. Many of them are valued heirlooms or treasures found in the old ruins of the Ancestors. One example of the tech-treasures are the teleports, which can be used for instantaneous travel anywhere in Astraterra. The teleports have been silent for a millenia, and just recently a way to restart them was discovered. But there is a problem: as the ringworld broke into pieces and the teleports lost their connection to one another, there is no way of knowing what lies on the other side of a teleportal. Most of the teleports are still inactive and bold explorers are needed to activate them again and connect them with all the other re-activated teleports.

Players make compound words or phrases from a set of word cards to satisfy a mission. The dealer decides which of the submissions is Good, which is Bad, and which is Funny, and rewards the players appropriately (3, -2 and 5 points respectively). The first to 21 (or -10) wins.<br/><br/>There are three main differences between The Good, The Bad &amp; The Funny and other Apples-style games:<br/><br/>The three main differences are:<br/><br/>1. Scoring. Apples games with strangers can be aggravating - will they choose the funny card or the clever one? Or the realistic one? Or just choose something terrible.<br/><br/>The dealer always has to choose The Good, The Bad &amp; The Funny.<br/><br/>The Good is the best representation of the mission card. It&rsquo;s worth three points because, while good, it&rsquo;s boring and obvious. And you probably had the perfect card, so whatever.<br/><br/>The Bad is the worst submission that round. It&rsquo;s worth negative two because I&rsquo;m sick of players constantly ditching cards instead of actually thinking about a good answer. You&rsquo;ll also notice that many of the players that think they are funny will end up with a lot of bad answers.<br/><br/>The Funny gets the biggest laugh. Subjective, of course, but it&rsquo;s worth five points for entertaining the room.<br/><br/>The first to (or above) 21 points wins, unless there is a tie, in which case play continues as normal until a single player has the highest score.<br/><br/>There&rsquo;s another small twist, which is that players can also win by scoring -10 points. This makes it a bit more fun to be chosen for that bad answer in round 1.<br/><br/>2. Players always play two cards. This is a game about compound words and phrases. Our lives are surrounded by such combinations - you&rsquo;ll start to notice much more after reading this sentence. Creating compound words and phrases is a wonderful challenge - it forces players to think about the many ways that a word can be interpreted and manipulated by another word. And the essence of this game is a carefully created wordlist that is composed of the most commonly occurring bits from compound words and phrases in the English language, almost all of which are nouns.<br/><br/>There are a couple of key benefits to this approach. Most answers are not reliant on a shared understanding of pop. Many other Apples games assume a certain level of 21st Century culture familiarity while the word cards from The Good, The Bad &amp; The Funny are timeless (the mission cards, however, do have a bit of pop-infusion). Answers won&rsquo;t get stale, as the likelihood of a one playing the same combination twice within a play session or many, many play sessions is infinitely low. Even playing the same word card won&rsquo;t have the same negative effect as in other games because it is about how two cards react together, not simply a funny reference. Even if the same two cards are played together, the order can be changed to dramatically alter the meaning.<br/><br/>The game is very replayable without the need for many, many expansions.<br/><br/>3.

Well, mostly profit. Enter Templeton Steele, a powerful weapons designer whose bride-to-be is none other than the lovely Liliana Fairchild. Now, on account of these two lovebirds getting hitched, you and your crew are hired to transport Lilly to a fancy ship called the Rim&rsquo;s Dream. Sounds easy enough, right? Unite the happy couple and they&rsquo;ll get paid? Only thing is, this Princess ain&rsquo;t exactly happy about the wedding. The more you find out, the worse this job gets &ndash; and the less chance you have of getting paid. Written by Margaret Weis.<br/>     Shooting Fish - The War may be over, but there&rsquo;re still plenty of bad people looking to do bad things, and they don&rsquo;t seem to need war as an excuse to come after their fellow man neither. Some folk will happily turn out a bunch of orphans to make themselves a few coins. Buzzard Lake is one such fella, but like all men he&rsquo;s got a weakness. He don&rsquo;t like to lose. That&rsquo;s where you and your crew come in. Lake needs to learn what second place feels like, and you&rsquo;re gonna teach him. You might even save some orphans in the bargain if he don&rsquo;t kill you first. Written by Andrew Peregrine.<br/>     Friends in Low Places - Sometimes meeting up with old friends in Serenity View is cause for celebration, but not this time. Over drinks, you and your Crew discover that Monty's new wife Daisy has gone missing. Worse, your pal thinks that Virgil Morningstar, a Guild trader with a heap of Alliance connections, had something to do with her disappearance. By the time you find out Daisy ain't the only one who's vanished, you and your Crew'll be neck-deep in trouble and hard-pressed to find your way out of it. Thing is, if you do unravel this little mystery, you'll claim a big reward and be heroes to boot. Written by Monica Valentinelli.<br/>     Freedom Flyer - Folk do what they can to scratch out a living in the &rsquo;Verse. Seems like some folk push their luck to scrape by in these tough times. Maggie Miller's bad history and rotten luck are keeping her from achievin&rsquo; her dreams. She wants to get out of the Georgia System to make a fresh start out on the Rim, but she needs three things to do it: a hidden pile of cash, a ship she&rsquo;s hidden with an old flame, Hollis Mason, and enough leftover credits to wipe Ma Millers&rsquo;s medical bills clean before she goes.  The Crew will have to dig for treasure, outwit a wily Alliance officer, and steal a ship hidden in orbit to help Maggie safely on her way. Trouble is, there&rsquo;s a kind of hitch: Hush Jackson, a tough-as-nails bounty hunter who&rsquo;s hopin&rsquo; to cash in on Maggie&rsquo;s head. Will the Crew turn Maggie over for the bounty? Or, will they help Maggie out and pray there is enough cash left over to cover their costs?<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Please note that the rules for these five Episodes may vary slightly from what we offered originally. After compiling these adventures, we rules edited each Episode and made a few tweaks. Both versions of each individual Episode are still compatible with the Firefly RPG corebook or, alternatively, may be run as a stand-alone Episode.

The disappearances have something to do with a popular ritual where the participants tell ghost stories to each other.

These symbols are a map and instructions for opening the prison of Yomi. As the heroes try to unearth the mystery, a dark creature hunts them from the shadows. The only way to face it is to claim old forgotten weapons, and unlock their power as Potentials.<br/>     Yukidomari: Drawn to the remote village of Yukidomari, the heroes find a place plagued by hauntings and spirits of the dark. As bad weather traps them here, the strange atmosphere of the village begins to take its toll and people begin to disappear at an alarming rate. Here they may learn the truth behind the Kuro incident, but that will be no use if they cannot escape the village alive.<br/>     Tsukurigoto: Seven agents of the dark appear to hunt down the Shi-Tenno and take the keys they guard. The heroes have helped them escape into hiding, but this means the agents are coming for them! As a blackout plunges Shin-Edo into chaos, the player characters race to protect the secrets of the Shi-Tenno. But the dark Kami can be deceptive, as well as dangerous.<br/>     Kami: The thunder spirits must be stopped before they can open the gates to Yomi and time is not on the heroes&rsquo; side. Fighting through a city in chaos, they must hunt down the tools they need to fight these powerful and near immortal spirits. But destiny has a plan and the Red Storm is coming.

It is your job to defend humanity, quell the rising panic, and turn back the alien invasion.<br/><br/>Where the world's militaries have failed to stand against the alien invaders, you must succeed. To do so, you must make strategic use of the resources available to you. You must launch Interceptors to shoot down alien UFOs, assign soldiers to key missions, research alien technology, and use that technology to defend your base &mdash; all while trying to keep the world from collapsing just long enough that you can coordinate one final mission to repel the invaders for good.<br/><br/>One of the more notable aspects of XCOM: The Board Game is the way that it incorporates a free and innovative digital app into the core of its gameplay. This digital companion will be available both as a downloadable app and as an online tool.<br/><br/>The app's primary function is to coordinate the escalating alien invasion, randomly selecting from one of five different invasion plans. Each invasion plan represents a general outline that the alien commanders will use to coordinate the arrival of new UFOs, plan strikes against your base, and respond to your successes or failures as it seeks to conquer Earth. The app manages all of these tasks and heightens the game's tension as it forces you to respond in real-time. Then, after you move quickly to coordinate your response, you engage the enemy in the untimed resolution phase and feed the results to the app. Based upon these results, the app launches the invasion's next strikes.<br/><br/>Additionally, the app teaches you the rules, controls the information that your satellites provide you, and tracks the progress of your resistance efforts, even as it allows you to enjoy the game at any of three levels of difficulty: Easy, Normal, or Hard.<br/><br/>The use of this app does more than simply streamline your play experience and track your turns in real-time; it also permits a uniquely dynamic turn structure. While the variety of game phases remains the same from round to round, the order in which you and your friends must play through them may change, as may the number of a given phase. As a result, while you'll want to know where UFOs appear before you deploy your Interceptors, the alien invaders may be able to disrupt your satellite intel and force you to deploy your Interceptors on patrol with limited or no knowledge of the UFOs current whereabouts. Similarly, you may be forced to think about the costs of resolving the world&rsquo;s crises before you know how many troops you&rsquo;ll need to commit to your base defense.<br/><br/>The effect of the app is to immerse you deep into the dramatic tension at the core of XCOM: The Board Game, and it ensures that the game presents a challenging and cooperative (or solo) experience like no other. Just like the XCOM department heads that you represent, you'll need to keep cool heads in order to prevail.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "1", "boardgameversion": ["English first edition", "French first edition", "German first edition", "Italian First edition", "Polish first edition", "Portuguese first edition", "Spanish first edition"], "name": "XCOM: The Board Game", "videogamebg": ["XCOM: Enemy Unknown"], "playingtime": "90", "boardgamemechanic": ["Co-operative Play", "Dice Rolling", "Hand Management", "Press Your Luck", "Variable Player Powers"], "age": "14", "boardgameexpansion": ["XCOM: The Board Game \u2013 Evolution"], "usersrated": "4854", "boardgamesubdomain": ["Thematic Games"], "average": "7.21322", "boardgamepodcastepisode": ["7LandHand: Episode 34 \u2013 XCOM", "Alien scum!

Crossover is a Flash browser-based platforming game. The game's levels and graphics are all primarily duplicates of those found in Super Mario Bros.; each of the game's eight worlds feature four levels. In three of the levels, the goal is to reach a checkpoint to complete the level, while the final level has the player facing against Bowser in hopes of rescuing Princess Peach. Enemies such as Goombas, Koopa Troopas and Hammer Bros. will block the player's attempt to make it successfully through the level. As Mario, the player can jump on enemies to kill them, use Koopa shells to knock enemies over, and acquire powerups from special blocks that serve to boost health, shoot fireballs, or remain invincible for a short period of time. Besides completing the level, the player can also earn coins and points, attempting to achieve a high score.<br/><br/>Crossover varies this formula by adding in several additional main characters in addition to Mario that the player can play. In the same manner as with Super Mario Bros. 2, the player selects one of the additional characters at the start of each level. Each character, based on other classic Nintendo Entertainment System games, uses different attacks and movements that are related to their original game, as well as their own signature music. These characters are:<br/><br/>Link, based on The Legend of Zelda, uses a sword and boomerang to attack enemies. Collecting powerups increases the potency of the sword's attacks and the range of his boomerang. He is the only character with fundamental control changes from his original game, being given the ability to jump, which wasn't possible until Zelda 2.<br/>Mega Man possesses an arm cannon which he can use to fire forward to destroy enemies, with additional powerups to increase his firepower, and has the ability to slide under small spaces. Within version 1.1, Mega Man's jump height is reduced but now has the ability to call in Rush, his robotic dog, to assist in high jumps.<br/>Samus Aran, from the Metroid games, also has a gun she can fire and which gains power with powerups. Samus is also able to transform into her &quot;morph ball&quot; form, rolling through narrow spaces and planting bombs. As of Version 1.1, the player starts off playing as Samus in her Zero-Suit, and upon the capture of a mushroom, gains her Power Suit. In Version 1.2, Samus can pick up missiles when enemies are defeated. Each missile sprite icon gives Samus 2 missiles.<br/>Simon Belmont, the protagonist of the early Castlevania games, has a whip and can throw axes at foes, the attack strength and number of axes on screen increasing with additional powerups. He has the ability to double jump, which he doesn't have in the original games. His jump was also modified to be easier to control than the original games but can be changed back in the options with Classic mode.<br/>Bill Rizer, one of the playable characters in Contra use a gun to fire on enemies, which increases in power and spread with further powerups. He can shoot in 8 directions, even when jumping.<br/>Ryu Hayabusa from Ninja Gaiden was added in the version 1.1 release. Ryu, as a ninja, is able to use a sword and throwing stars, and has the ability to climb and jump walls.<br/>Sophia the 3rd, the tank vehicle from Blaster Master, was added in the version 1.2 release. Sophia's capabilities include hovering, clinging to walls and ceilings, and homing missiles, but is also the first character with a limited amount of ammunition and power, requiring the player to refill these capacities through collection from defeated foes.<br/>Luigi, Mario's brother from the Super Mario Bros. series was introduced in version 2.0. Luigi uses his gameplay from Super Mario Bros. The Lost Levels, being able to jump higher but not run as fast as Mario. He is also more slippery than Mario which makes it harder to avoid enemies and pitfalls.<br/>Bass, from Mega Man 10, was introduced in version 2.0 and has similar play to Mega Man, but his arm cannon acts differently, being able to shoot in 7 directions. Instead of a slide, Bass has a dash that is faster than Mega Man's but cannot slide under small spaces. Like Simon, he can double jump.<br/>In the version 2.0 update, character skins were a new and unique feature that allowed all characters to look different and have new music along with them. Some skins are the same character but from a different game in their respective franchise, while others are from completely different franchises. The 3.0 update added additional character skins, special rendering modes to mimic other earlier computer gaming hardware, and levels inspired by the limited-release Super Mario Bros.

It is the first such game in almost four years, and a reboot for the series. FIFA Street was developed by some of the same team behind FIFA 12, including creative director Gary Paterson, and uses the FIFA 12 game engine.[1][2] Sid Misra, the line producer for FIFA Street, promised &quot;the first true quality street football experience.&quot;[5]<br/><br/>The game was first announced on 16 August 2011 at the Gamescom event in Germany, and was released on the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 consoles in March 2012. Along with several other new EA Sports titles, FIFA Street was available early to purchasers of the EA Sports Season Ticket.[2] Lionel Messi features on the cover after EA announced, in November 2011, that he had signed a deal to become the new face of the FIFA franchise.[6] The &quot;Adidas All-Star Team&quot; including 13 of the greatest footballers in the world and the Lionel Messi Barcelona-themed venue were available as pre-order bonus.[7] A FIFA Street demo was launched on 28 February 2012 on Xbox Live and a day later on PSN.[8]<br/><br/>In an effort to make the game more &quot;authentic&quot;, the stylised cartoon-like visuals of previous games in the series has been dropped in favour of a more realistic look, though there will still be the same emphasis on skill moves and tricks. The focus is once again on fast-paced games involving small teams of five or six players per side, one-on-one, and game modes based on panna and futsal also included.[1][3] As with the previous games in the series, skill moves are an important element of gameplay. FIFA Street features twice as many tricks as are possible in FIFA 12, with much greater variety, and over 50 more than its predecessor FIFA Street 3.[1][9][10] Other new features include improved one-touch passing, a feature called Street Ball Control, and a new &quot;ATTACK&quot; dribbling system.[2][3]<br/><br/>The game features a large number of real life players from 3000 teams of many of the world's biggest leagues, and 2012 locations from around the world ranging from the streets of Amsterdam to the beaches of Rio de Janeiro. Each of these arenas attempt to reflect the style of football played in that country. The game is the first game in the series to feature both national and club teams.[1][3][9][10]<br/><br/>The game features a World Tour mode, which lets the player create their own team, from details such as crest and team kit, to players and their individual street kits. The user then competes in competitions against the AI, after which, the total skill points each player earned in the game is tallied up in a levelling system. From levelling up players the user can use points earned to upgrade their player's skill and ability from passing to shooting to goalkeeping. With the integration of EA Sports Football Club, players can add friends' players onto their World Tour team<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;FIFA Street (2012 video game)&quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "163661": {"poll": [], "name": "Black College Football: BCFX: The Xperience", "videogamemode": ["Local Multiplayer", "Network Multiplayer", "Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["Windows Classic edition", "Windows Legendary edition", "Xbox 360 The Doug Williams Edition"], "average": "0", "videogametheme": ["Sports - American Football"], "usersrated": "0", "videogamedeveloper": ["Nerjyzed Entertainment"], "videogamegenre": ["Sports"], "videogameplatform": ["Windows", "Xbox 360"], "statistics": [], "videogamepublisher": ["Aspyr Media"], "description": "Black College Football Experience (BCFx) is a sports video game centered on the culture of black college football.

Once the dice are rolled they are assigned as follows:<br/><br/>One die is chosen as the Order Die, the die number corresponding to 1 of the 6 Tea Card numbers.<br/><br/>One die is then chosen as the Wealth Die, and will increase a player&rsquo;s total wealth by the amount shown on the die.<br/><br/>The final die is the Passing Die and is passed to the other player. This die is locked and may not be rolled during the next player&rsquo;s turn unless the player uses the White Tea card&rsquo;s special action.<br/><br/>Phase 2 - The Tea Order<br/>The player may now place orders on the Tea Card that matches the Order Die&rsquo;s number, thus pleasing one of the Sultan&rsquo;s sons. A player may move their eurocube token up the card&rsquo;s track as many spaces as they are able to pay for (the bottom number denotes the price), moving their token on the Wealth card accordingly. If a player has (0) wealth they may not place an order this turn.<br/><br/>Spaces on the track also have a Prestige Point value which is totalled up at the end of the game (the top number shown for the space).<br/><br/>Certain marked spaces also allow the player to use the Special Action of that card. If a player can afford to move their token up a number of spaces, passing more than one Special Action space, only the final space landed on is counted. The space must be landed on to use the Special Action. The player does not have to use the Special Action if they do not want to.<br/><br/>Phase 3 - Wealth Gained<br/>The player may now move their Wealth token the number of spaces as indicated on the Wealth Die.<br/><br/>The player&rsquo;s turn is now over and the opposing player takes the remaining two dice and rolls them to begin their turn.<br/><br/>Once both players have had a turn, the round is over, the round token is moved down one space on the Time Card and a new round begins.<br/><br/>Game End<br/>Play continues for a total of 10 rounds. When the 10th round is finished, players add up their respective Prestige Points to determine who will be the Chief Tea Merchant of the Sultanate. If the game ends in a tie, the player with the most accrued wealth is the winner.<br/><br/>"}, "163689": {"rpgartist": ["Mohammed Agbadi", "Jacob Blackmon", "John Morrow", "Alberto Demetrio Muraro", "Elton Robb"], "statistics": [], "name": "Pathways (Issue 41 - Aug 2014)", "rpgdesigner": ["Jacob Blackmon", "Creighton Broadhurst", "Thilo Graf", "Mark Knight", "David Paul", "Elton Robb"], "rpgproducer": ["David Paul", "Elton Robb", "Steven D.

Players will begin the game with the same starting decks consisting of a handful of survivors, a base camp location and some equipment. Players will take turns playing their hand to gain damage, occupy locations, use abilities and cure infections. Gaining damage allows the player to defeat ghastly Zombies who are protecting invaluable equipment, or surrounding a location, or even trapping other survivors. Once a Zombie is defeated, add the resources to your personal deck to be used for another turn. Though don't think Zombies will go down without a fight. The Zombie stack of cards holds surprise attack events which will force a player to have to defeat Zombies that match the type of event. If a player does not have the sufficient resources to defeat all Zombies, other players have the opportunity to assist in combat to help even the odds!<br/><br/>Dead Apocalypse is  1-4 players so if there isn't someone in your company you still have the opportunity to try to fight for survival all alone.

Banks of turbolasers unleash torrential volleys of fire against squadrons of X-wing and TIEs. Engineering teams race to route additional power to failing shields. Laser blasts and explosions flare across the battlefield. Even a single ship can change the tide of battle.<br/><br/>In Star Wars: Armada, you assume the role of fleet admiral, serving with either the Imperial Navy or Rebel Alliance. You assemble your fleet and engage the enemy. Using the game&rsquo;s unique maneuver tool, you steer your capital ships across the battlefield, even while squadrons of starfighters buzz around them. Then, as these ships exchange fire, it&rsquo;s your job to issue the tactical commands that will decide the course of battle and, perhaps, the fate of the galaxy.<br/><br/>Maneuver Tool<br/>The maneuver tool is one of the game&rsquo;s most innovative features and adds a unique feel to the way your capital ships must accommodate for inertia as they maneuver through the stars.<br/><br/>It consists of a number of segments linked with hinges, which is used to plot the ship's course. More nimble ships are allowed to turn the ship further at each hinge.<br/><br/>Command Stack<br/>Armada balances the awesome scale of the Star Wars galaxy&rsquo;s ships and space warfare with intuitive ship designs and accessible rules for issuing commands and resolving combat that make for rich, engaging, and highly tactical play experiences.<br/><br/>Capital ships are extremely powerful war machines, but they&rsquo;re also massive and sophisticated vessels that can&rsquo;t swiftly react to every development in the heat of battle. Accordingly, the key to flying these vessels effectively is learning how to plan ahead. You want to issue your commands in such a way that your crews will be ready to execute them at just the right times.<br/><br/>Each of your pre-painted capital ships has a command value, which determines how many commands it will have in its stack at any given point in time. During setup, you secretly build your initial command stack, selecting from any of four different commands, each of which provides a different advantage. Once you have locked your selections, you place the commands in your stack in the order of your choice. Then, during each round of game play, you secretly select and assign a new command to your ship, placing it at the bottom of your command stack, before you reveal the command at the top of your stack and gain its benefits.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": ["English first edition", "French first edition", "German first edition", "Italian first edition", "Polish First Edition", "Spanish first edition"], "average": "8.01651", "name": "Star Wars: Armada", "playingtime": "120", "boardgamemechanic": ["Action / Movement Programming", "Dice Rolling", "Variable Player Powers"], "age": "14", "boardgameexpansion": ["Star Wars: Armada \u2013  Rebel Transports Expansion Pack", "Star Wars: Armada \u2013 Assault Frigate Mark II Expansion Pack", "Star Wars: Armada \u2013 CR90 Corellian Corvette Expansion Pack", "Star Wars: Armada \u2013 Gladiator-class Star Destroyer Expansion Pack", "Star Wars: Armada \u2013 Hammerhead Corvettes Expansion Pack", "Star Wars: Armada \u2013 Home One Expansion Pack", "Star Wars: Armada \u2013 Imperial Assault Carriers Expansion Pack", "Star Wars: Armada \u2013 Imperial Class Star Destroyer Expansion Pack", "Star Wars: Armada \u2013 Imperial Fighter Squadrons Expansion Pack", "Star Wars: Armada \u2013 Imperial Fighter Squadrons II Expansion Pack", "Star Wars: Armada \u2013 Imperial Light Carrier Expansion Pack", "Star Wars: Armada \u2013 Imperial Light Cruiser Expansion Pack", "Star Wars: Armada \u2013 Imperial Raider Expansion Pack", "Star Wars: Armada \u2013 Interdictor Expansion Pack", "Star Wars: Armada \u2013 Liberty Expansion Pack", "Star Wars: Armada \u2013 MC30c Frigate Expansion Pack", "Star Wars: Armada \u2013 Nebulon-B Frigate Expansion Pack", "Star Wars: Armada \u2013 Phoenix Home Expansion Pack", "Star Wars: Armada \u2013 Rebel Fighter Squadrons Expansion Pack", "Star Wars: Armada \u2013 Rebel Fighter Squadrons II Expansion Pack", "Star Wars: Armada \u2013 Rogues and Villains Expansion Pack", "Star Wars: Armada \u2013 The Corellian Conflict", "Star Wars: Armada \u2013 Victory-class Star Destroyer Expansion Pack"], "usersrated": "2636", "boardgameaccessory": ["Star Wars: Armada Dice Pack", "Star Wars: Armada \u2013 Maneuver Tool"], "boardgamesubdomain": ["Thematic Games", "Wargames"], "boardgamefamily": ["Components: Miniatures", "Star Wars", "Star Wars: Armada"], "boardgamepodcastepisode": ["#80 \u2013 Tabletop \u2013 Fantasy Flight Star Wars Games", "#88 \u2013 Tabletop \u2013 The Best Four Days in Gaming", "Best Board Games of 2015 Awards Spectacular", "Boardcast News 4.16.15 | Podcast of Nonsensical Gamers", "D6Desperados-Star Wars Armada Review - April 2015", "Episode 11: Sherlock Holmes Drinks Pom While Flying a Star Destroyer to Venus", "Episode 12: An Octodog Leaves A Legacy Of Children On A Battlecruiser", "Episode 16: Kings of Air and Steam, Tremors, and Loots and Legends", "Episode 17: Restaurant Voices", "Episode 18: Codenames Review - Games of the Year - Giveaways", "Episode 83 -- All Ramshackle and Worry Free", "Episode 9 - Craig Cillessen &amp; Clockwork Wars Review", "Episode 9: Panamax, They Live, and Solforge", "Mechanics in a Name", "Meeples &amp; Miniatures - Episode 143 - Star Wars: Armada", "Podcast #35: Rebellion in an Airport", "Se Viene La Lluvia 03x04 - Especial Tematico: Star Wars", "Strange Assembly 184 - In With The Old, In With The New", "Tema om Star Wars br\u00e6tspil", "The Game Pit: Episode 40 - Council Chamber Mega Review of 2014 with Top 5s", "The Good the Board and the Nuts and Bolts: Episode 10", "The Good, The Board, and the Gushy: Episode 11 Vlaada Chvatil"]}, "163746": {"rpgartist": ["(Uncredited)"], "rpgitemversion": ["PDF version"], "poll": [], "name": "Temple of Si Hur", "rpgdesigner": ["Frank Schmidt"], "rpggenre": ["Fantasy (High Fantasy)"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2204358.jpg", "usersrated": "0", "rpgsetting": ["Filbar"], "rpgproducer": ["Frank Schmidt"], "statistics": [], "rpg": ["AD&D First Edition (1e) Compatible Products", "AD&D Second Edition (2e) Compatible Products"], "rpgpublisher": ["(Web published)"], "average": "0", "rpgcategory": ["Scenario / Adventure / Module"], "rpgseries": ["Adventures in Filbar"], "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2204358_t.jpg", "description": "From publisher blurb:<br/><br/>Sometimes wandering through the frontier garners information as opposed to bloodshed.

For that, you can turn to a mythic heritage. This new aspect of mythic characters allows for further customization of your mythic character. A mythic character can choose a mythic heritage in addition to his or her mythic path, and doing so grants him access to a number of unique abilities that are designed to reflect the flavor of his heritage, while also being of value to characters of every mythic path.<br/><br/>This installment introduces the angelic heritage, for characters whose mythic power comes from the heavenly realms and the forces of truth and justice. Many with this mythic heritage are the direct descendants of angels or other celestial beings, who may have fallen in love with the character&rsquo;s mortal parent, or who may have deliberately been attempting to bring a prophesied hero into the world. Others had their mythic power bestowed upon them by angelic forces in order to do good in the world.<br/><br/>Whatever its cause, this mythic heritage allows you to harness the great cosmic powers of the heavens. This book includes 18 new mythic abilities, which together make up the angelic mythic heritage. In addition to all of the basics of being an angel, such as a halo that sheds light and marks you as an undeniable servant of righteousness, gaining all of the standard angel immunities and resistances, gaining feathery wings, and projecting a magic circle against evil, those with this mythic heritage can also speak with the voice of a god, damaging mortals who hear, turn any weapon they touch into a powerful holy weapon, or shield their allies with their own bodies to not only protect their friends but regain mythic power by doing so, as well as numerous other heavenly powers.

In the first phase of each round, the players (in turn order) roll their dice and attempt to get the best score possible.

If the die rolls a one, that die is locked at one for the round.<br/><br/>Once each player has their starting roll for the round, the scheming begins. Each player must choose to help or hinder an opponent with five possible outcomes (3 outcomes if there are only two players left).<br/><br/>Outcome 1 - Player A helps Player B: Player B adds 3 points to their score for the round.<br/>Outcome 2 - Player A hinders Player B: Player B subtracts 3 points.<br/>Outcome 3 - Player A helps Player B and Player B helps Player A: Each player adds 6 points.<br/>Outcome 4 - Player A hinders Player B and Player B hinders Player A: Each player subtracts 6 points.<br/>Outcome 5 - Player A helps Player B and Player B hinders Player A: Player A subtracts 6 Points and Player B adds 6 points.<br/><br/>At the end of the second phase, the player with the lowest score in the round loses a die.

The Player Characters can first get involved by helping with the search and rescue.<br/><br/>After the initial event, the Player Characters may be asked to help in the investigation by the villagers. The villagers are likely to trust them if they helped the rescue operation in the middle of the night. The surviving captain and crew need interviewed and any other witnesses out on the pier last night. The power plant is fine if investigated with no power surges or outages recorded last night. The lamp posts themselves have burned out bulbs but the electrical wiring seems fine. The villagers replace all the bulbs once the Player Characters finish investigating them.<br/><br/>That night though, the same flickering occurs and shorts out all the lamp post bulbs. After the lights are out, one of the crewmen and his midnight rendezvous are attacked in the middle of the night on one of the benches. Their bodies are discovered tossed onto the rocky shoals the next morning. Someone or something is targeting this particular crew and those that associate with them but why? And how are they shorting the bulbs out without any other damage to the lamp posts?<br/><br/>Is it sabotage by a local crime boss eliminating shipping competition for his smuggling? Or is it some sort of ghost with a grudge against this captain and crew? Or is it something far more ancient and malevolent awakened by the rays of light penetrating its once dark domain at night?<br/><br/>"}, "163825": {"rpgartist": ["Stephanie McAlea", "Ade Smith"], "rpg": ["ICONS"], "statistics": [], "name": "Assault on Precinct 9", "rpgdesigner": ["John McMullen"], "rpgproducer": ["Mike Lafferty", "Ade Smith"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2198481.jpg", "usersrated": "0", "rpgitemversion": ["PDF version"], "rpgsetting": ["Stark City"], "average": "0", "rpggenre": ["Action / Adventure (Superheroes)"], "rpgpublisher": ["Fainting Goat Games"], "rpgcategory": ["Scenario / Adventure / Module"], "poll": [], "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2198481_t.jpg", "description": "From publisher blurb:<br/><br/>Get in on the fun _fast_ with this short, ready to play adventure:Assault on Precinct 9<br/><br/>A supervillain's gang is staging a jailbreak on the precinct house where he's being held.
