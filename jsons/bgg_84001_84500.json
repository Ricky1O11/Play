You can play against another live player, or you can fight against the built-in AI.<br/><br/>Each Button Man has a unique mix of dice, including at least one die of variable size, called a &ldquo;swing die.&rdquo; For example, Avis is 4 4 10 12 X. Her &ldquo;X&rdquo; can be any size between 4 and 20.<br/><br/>Players start by rolling all of their dice, and the single lowest number goes first. After that, players take turns capturing each other&rsquo;s dice using Power and Skill attacks.<br/><br/>Each die is worth its size in points (for example, a d12 is worth 12 points). Dice that you keep are worth half their size (for example, your d12 is worth 6 to you). The goal is to score more points than your opponent by capturing, or keeping, more points.<br/><br/>The loser of each round can change his or her swing die, and the first player to win three rounds wins the match. It takes a great deal of strategy as well as good luck to win a game of Button Men.<br/><br/>Button Men won the Origins Award Best Abstract Board Game of 1999, and the paper version spawned dozens of expansions with hundreds of different characters. This edition includes 24 characters and special rules for Shadow Dice and Poison Dice, with expansions soon to come.<br/><br/>Source: The Game Website.<br/><br/>"}, "84023": {"average": "5.8", "videogamebg": ["Knights of Charlemagne"], "name": "Reiner Knizia's Knights of Charlemagne", "videogamemode": ["Hotseat", "Local Multiplayer", "Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["iPhone edition"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic816276.jpg", "videogametheme": ["Board Game"], "usersrated": "4", "videogamedeveloper": ["(Self-Developed Video Game)"], "videogamegenre": ["Puzzle", "Strategy"], "videogameplatform": ["iPhone"], "poll": [], "statistics": [], "videogamepublisher": ["(Self-Published)"], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic816276_t.jpg", "description": "Welcome to Knights of Charlemagne; one of Reiner Knizia's classic board games now available for the iPhone and iPod touch!<br/><br/>The rules are simple; turn by turn you must choose to deploy your Knights to one of ten Estates on the board.

The basic idea is that there is a battle to control and capture a starship by a boarding party moving down the corridors and rooms of the ship. One side controls the attackers, who are mostly composed of the eponymous 'Starship Marines', and the defenders, usually less well armed crewmen, with perhaps a smattering of Marines to stiffen the defense. The deck plans can either be drawn out or built in 3D, depending on your preferences and time available. The scale of toy soldier is 25mm or 1/72, and any make of figures can be used [...]<br/><br/>The minimum you need are a few toy soldiers, some dice, a large sheet of paper with a deck plan on it, and the rules. A typical small game takes about a hour or so (longer if you like arguing about rules). The largest game we know of, to date, involved some 60 people, hundreds of toy soldiers, and many very very big sheets of paper.[...]<br/><br/>"}, "84058": {"poll": [], "name": "Dance Dance Revolution Ultramix", "videogamemode": ["Local Multiplayer", "Network Multiplayer", "Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["North American Xbox (Platinum Family Hits) edition", "North American Xbox edition", "UK Xbox edition"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic817162.jpg", "videogameseries": ["Dance Dance Revolution"], "videogametheme": ["Abstract", "Dancing", "Music"], "usersrated": "4", "videogamedeveloper": ["Konami"], "videogamegenre": ["Rhythm"], "videogameplatform": ["Xbox"], "average": "5.375", "statistics": [], "videogamepublisher": ["Konami"], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic817162_t.jpg", "description": "Dance Dance Revolution ULTRAMIX, or DDR Ultramix, is the sixth home version of Dance Dance Revolution to be released in the United States, and the first DDR game to be released on the Microsoft Xbox video game console.

Set in a world much like our own, the game pits your character against the unrelenting hordes of ravenous corpses that grow legion as each hour passes. Only the strongest, bravest, and most resourceful individuals have a chance of surviving this threat. Rarer still are those who can take advantage of the rise of the dead and not simply survive, but emerge as a master of the new world in the wake of its cleansing at the hands of the undead.<br/><br/>Against the Dead is a fast paced, action oriented game that can be played either as a one or two session break from other games, or as an epic campaign that follows the fate of the world from the earliest reports of zombies rising to the last days of an apocalypse where the continued existence of life on Earth is in question. To facilitate these different approaches, the game presents the world in three stages of the zombie threat. First is the Emergence Stage, where zombies are few and mysterious. Next is the Ascendance Stage, in which zombies are quickly becoming as common as living folk and all the devices of civilization are being arrayed against them. Finally there is the Apocalypse Stage, where zombies are the norm and humans are scattered and few, faced with the real possibility of extinction.<br/><br/>The world of Against the Dead is described only as it relates to zombies. In all other ways it is the world that you woke up to this morning. Until people started to actually see the dead walk, zombies only existed in movies and comic books. Magic was fictional. Radiation could not infuse recently dead corpses with power. Faith was a personal matter that hadn't manifested a true miracle since ancient times. But something happened...<br/><br/>Against the Dead is not concerned with why the dead have begun to walk the Earth. They simply have. Some zombies are created by infectious disease, spread as the undead are driven to consume human flesh. Others are the result of profane magical or dark religious rites. Still others are created by radiation. Individual Game Masters are welcome to create whatever explanation they like for the rise of the dead. Or perhaps there are many explanations. Regardless, your character must find ways to fight the zombies or join their pile of partially consumed victims... perhaps to rise as one shortly thereafter.<br/><br/>Based on the d20 Modern System Reference Document, Against the Dead presents a streamlined version of the rules that deals exclusively with zombies and ways to fight them. The only material you need to play the game is this book, a set of gaming dice, and a pencil and paper. Miniatures to represent characters and zombies are recommended, but not necessary. A CD or two of panicky ambient music can greatly assist the atmosphere of a game session, as can a soundtrack from any of the hundreds of zombie movies - good and bad - that have been produced over the years.<br/><br/>Presented in a straightforward &quot;crunchy&quot; style that should appeal to experienced gamers and newbies alike, Against the Dead doesn't spend a lot of time with detailed descriptions or dense prose. We've all seen the flicks. We know what a good old fashioned zombie infestation looks like. The dead are out there. Go get 'em.<br/><br/>"}, "84088": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3057110.jpg", "boardgameimplementation": ["Fauna"], "poll": [], "boardgamedesigner": ["Friedemann Friese"], "statistics": [], "yearpublished": "2010", "maxplayers": "4", "boardgameartist": ["Alexander Jung", "Volker Maas"], "boardgamepublisher": ["Egmont Polska", "HUCH! & friends"], "maxplaytime": "30", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3057110_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "30", "boardgamecategory": ["Animals", "Children's Game", "Educational", "Trivia"], "description": "This is the version of Fauna for the younger ones.<br/><br/>As in Fauna it is all about animals.

More steps are given when a stage is cleared, based on how well the player did. The &quot;steps&quot; have another function, however, they are also used to add levels to monsters. At first, the player must dig and create the maze while creating monsters before a hero comes to capture the demon lord. When the hero appears and is going to enter the maze, the player must take the demon lord and change his location, preferably making him harder for the hero to find. When the hero gets into the maze, he will take random paths (if there are more than one) until he finds and captures the demon lord. The hero will fight against any monster that gets in his way.<br/><br/>When the hero captures the demon lord, he will go back by the same path taking the demon lord with him. It is possible to create monsters to save the demon lord during this.<br/><br/>The ground changes depending on the slimes that the player 'releases' from the blocks. If the block is covered with moss, and the player uses his pickaxe on this block, a slime will be released. These slimes move around the dungeon, absorbing, and expelling the material from the rocks, creating blocks with more and more material. Once a block obtains enough material, it will change colors depending on just how much is in the block. Stronger, more powerful monsters will be released if the block has more material. The death of monsters or heroes, along with some of the heroes' actions, has varied effects on the surrounding ground. For example, if a hero casts a spell, the surrounding blocks will be filled with mana. More so, if that hero dies, the remainder of his mana is expelled onto all surrounding blocks.<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;What Did I Do To Deserve This, My Lord?,&quot; available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "84095": {"rpgdesigner": ["Mark Clover"], "rpg": ["Generic / Universal"], "statistics": [], "name": "Playouts: Small Keep", "rpgartist": ["Steven Muchow", "Howard Pyle"], "rpgproducer": ["Mark Clover"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic817138.jpg", "usersrated": "0", "rpgitemversion": ["PDF version"], "average": "0", "rpggenre": ["Fantasy"], "rpgpublisher": ["Creative Mountain Games"], "rpgcategory": ["Accessory (dice, maps, screens, cards)"], "poll": [], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic817138_t.jpg", "description": "From publisher blurb:<br/><br/>Playouts are layouts to be printed and used at the game table during play.

These themes bring a certain flavor and mood to the city and help define its citizens. The GM should feel free to introduce new themes to the city and game as he sees fit, but these will hopefully provide him with some inspiration.<br/><br/><br/>     Adventure<br/><br/><br/>Crown is a home of adventurers and it could be argued that they are indeed the reason why the city is so prosperous. They serve the city and the Queen, and must pay a monthly due to the coffers of Crownmeet Castle, which helps maintain the Crown Watch and the great castle. In return the adventurers become a free people, who are very rarely, if ever, bothered by the Watch and always welcome at Crownmeet. Sometimes they are even invited by Queen Alayarra herself.<br/>Adventures are easily found throughout this magnificent city, and can be as exotic as hunting down a strange bird that has escaped from the Arcane Tower, to stopping a gang of thieves who are terrorizing one of the wards. But the party will never be alone, and at the many inns and taverns, they meet other adventurers and share stories, perhaps exchanging gear and important information that will eventually lead to new adventures.<br/><br/><br/>     Faith<br/><br/><br/>Most people believe that Crown is a city with little or no faith, but this is not true. One could even argue that the city has become more faithful and devoted with the Great Banishment of the Forgotten Gods, which forced the people to see the gods as they really were, although their faces continue to remain hidden in the shadows. Adventurers, champions and devoted is constantly searching for the answers that will help bring the gods back to the surface where they will hopefully heal the broken heart of the Crownfolk. These seekers find all the answers they seek below the surface, in mighty Tal Vorglath, a place that might even prove to be a little too dangerous even for an experienced band of adventurers.<br/><br/><br/>     Intrigue<br/><br/><br/>Crown is a city of free people, as long as they do not oppose the Queen too strongly that is, and there are many factions that constantly vie for power. This makes Crown the ideal setting for a campaign of intrigue, as nobles are constantly fighting each other in the secret, hoping to gain even greater wealth and power. But the nobles are not the only ones who thrive on intrigue, the planetouched races and wererats are playing this game as well, establishing their bases above ground as well as below. You never know what lurks in the corners, and perhaps there is nothing innocent about a feast held at Crownmeet Castle, as the shadows start their deadly dance. In a game of intrigue, a smile may prove to be as lethal as any poisonous dagger.<br/><br/><br/>     Secrets<br/><br/><br/>Shaedarsil was built on a foundation of secrets, and many of these remain undiscovered even so many years after its fall.

The warring states period of the sixteenth century. Central government was weak and ineffective as feudal lords called daimyos gained power. Each daimyo ruled a single fief, each wanted to become shogun and rule the entire nation. One man, Nobunaga Oda, came close but failed. He paid the price for failure, death.<br/><br/>Nobunaga's Ambition is a military, economic and diplomatic simulation for one to eight players that puts you in Nobunaga's place. You start with one fief and try to take the entire nation. A game of both strategy and tactics, success takes both careful planning and opportunism.<br/><br/>Administer your fiefs during peace to increase their strength. Keep your peasants and army loyal or risk revolt. Use your resources effectively, not spending too much on either guns or butter. Negotiate with other daimyos, or perhaps you'd rather just send ninja. On the battlefield, control your troops in close tactical detail. Take advantage of terrain, attack, retreat, fight a war of attrition, or go directly after the enemy general. Just be sure your side is smarter, tougher and better prepared.<br/><br/>Nobunaga's ambition is fast moving, easy to play and historically accurate. Characters and game events come from the reality of sixteenth century Japan. Maps are almost entirely accurate, both geographically and politically. Advanced graphics and animation help give the game a feel of complete reality. One to eight may play either of two scenarios and five different levels of difficulty.

(A printable 2D version of the board is provided, with coordinate numbers in each square.) This printable gameboard is laid out as a 4x4 arrangement of 16 &quot;levels&quot;, each level being a 4x4 2D chessboard. Alternatively, 4 3D 4x4x4 gameboards set up in a row are usable. The game is available on Zillions, in a version by L Lynn Smith.<br/><br/>Piece moves are translated as directly as possible from 2D to 4D, with some adaptations for play balance. So a rook now can move not only north-south and east-west, but up-down and side to side, too, for a maximum of 8 possible directions. Bishops move diagonally within each level, and may also move diagonally from level to level, which simplifies the move somewhat, changing the bishop from a fully 4D piece to one that is 2D+2D. This change makes the game much easier to play.<br/><br/>The knight, on the other hand, rivals the queen in power, because it is the only piece in chess that already moves in 2 dimensions. On a 4x4x4x4 board, it can reach up to 2 dozen spots. The queen combines the moves of rook and bishop, and the king is a one-square queen in movement.<br/><br/>Pawns are the most changed, moving 1 square &quot;forward&quot; or &quot;sideways&quot; - 6 locations in all, and capturing as it moves. This allows 2 pawns to support each other, a useful feature on <br/>a 4D board.<br/><br/>The game is won by checkmate, which with the held king rule, can be achieved in the standard fashion, or it can be forced on a bare king by a king and 2 major pieces, from any legal positions on the board. The held king rule allows a king moving onto the other king's current &quot;level&quot; to pin the enemy king in that level. This solves a major problem in higher dimensional chess, that of mating the opponent on a 4D board, which has so many ways to escape.<br/><br/>"}, "84133": {"poll": [], "name": "Triple Play Baseball", "videogamemode": ["Local Multiplayer"], "videogameversion": ["US Playstation 2 edition"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic846285.jpg", "videogameseries": ["Triple Play"], "videogametheme": ["Sports - Baseball"], "usersrated": "2", "videogamedeveloper": ["EA Sports"], "videogamegenre": ["Sports"], "videogameplatform": ["PlayStation 2"], "average": "7.24", "statistics": [], "videogamepublisher": ["EA Sports"], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic846285_t.jpg", "description": "Back of case<br/>Step out of the stands and up to the plate.

Are we playing ships captains or fleet admirals? In general naval wargamers tend to assume the role of admirals whilst demanding a level of detail more appropriate to a 'game of captains.' For most periods this isn't too much of a problem as the numbers of ships tends to be relatively small, and there are fleet level rules with appropriate levels of abstraction for most periods. However, ancient naval warfare seems to be one period where all available rules operate at the ship level. Obviously this makes battles such as Salamis, with hundreds of ships involved, difficult to handle. I wanted a set of rules that could be used to recreate these enormous battles whilst placing the placing the players truly in the roles of admirals and squadron commanders. At this level the fate of the individual ships, other than those on which the commanders themselves are embarked, is unimportant. Hence, &quot;Greek Fire and Roman Fury&quot; was born.<br/><br/>&quot;The basis for these rules is a theory that the naval battles of antiquity were fought in a style that was essentially similar to typical land actions. Therefore, in these rules, the respective fleets are represented by squadrons rather than individual ships, which are maneuvered around the 'battlefield' in a similar manner to armies. After a few false starts I decided to use the ever popular and quite robust American Civil War Fire and Fury as the basis for the system, hence the name I finally selected for this article.&quot;<br/><br/>User Summary<br/><br/>This miniatures rules set comes with information on what sorts of figures to use, and explains fleet composition, ship data (for the various sorts of ships that appear in the game), formations, sequence of play, morale, and a small number of charts<br/><br/>Rules set appears in Wargames Illustrated #187 (April 2003)<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": ["First edition"], "age": "12", "name": "Greek Fire and Roman Fury", "playingtime": "240", "boardgamemechanic": ["Dice Rolling"], "average": "0", "usersrated": "0", "boardgamefamily": ["Country: Greece", "Magazine: Wargames Illustrated"]}, "84137": {"poll": [], "name": "Power Rangers: Dino Thunder", "videogamemode": ["Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["Power Rangers: Dino Thunder (Gamecube)", "US Playstation 2"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic817159.jpg", "videogametheme": ["Superhero"], "usersrated": "1", "videogamedeveloper": ["THQ"], "videogamegenre": ["Action"], "videogameplatform": ["GameCube", "PlayStation 2"], "average": "3", "statistics": [], "videogamepublisher": ["THQ"], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic817159_t.jpg", "description": "Back of the Box:<br/>The mad scientist Mesgog has plans to send the world back into the age of the dinosaurs.

In a small town or rural area, this might be the whole team, and in such a case, they might not even be full time SWAT. Rather, they would be regular police officers trained in SWAT tactics with their armor and weapons in the trunk of their vehicle, ready to switch from officer to operator at the flip of a switch. The team might even belong to a state or federal law enforcement organization, like the FBI.<br/><br/>Whether used separately or as a team, the characters from SRT offer a quick resource for modern campaigns needing that touch of special weapons skills.

The player must switch to Flying Warrior form to use the characters' magic powers and defend themselves from the Tusk Soldiers' magic spells.<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;Flying Warriors&quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "84203": {"rpgdesigner": ["(Uncredited)"], "rpg": ["d20 Modern"], "statistics": [], "name": "Death from Above of Pulp Destruction", "rpgartist": ["Louis Porter, Jr. Design Studio"], "rpgproducer": ["Louis Porter, Jr. Design Studio"], "usersrated": "0", "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic818036.jpg", "rpgitemversion": ["PDF version"], "rpgsetting": ["Haven: City of Bronze"], "average": "0", "rpggenre": ["Action / Adventure (Pulp)"], "rpgpublisher": ["Devil's Workshop", "Louis Porter Jr. Design, Inc."], "rpgcategory": ["Sourcebook (rules/options to enhance play)"], "poll": [], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic818036_t.jpg", "description": "From publisher blurb:<br/><br/>While the word zeppelin is often used to refer to any aircraft that relies on lighter than air gasses to stay aloft, but the terms was originally a brand name used by the Zeppelin Company.

Even between role-players who have only just met, it is easy to talk about what your respective paladins were like, or how you suffered through the Dungeon of Double Doom. It is that sense of camaraderie that makes RPGs so great for those who play them.<br/><br/>Of course, these shared experiences are not always happy ones. Case in point, whether you were the Game Master or another player, it is likely that you let out a groan whenever someone said that they were casting a Summon Monster spell. Instantly, things ground to a halt as the proper stats were looked up, the appropriate Celestial or Fiendish template applied with all its various changes, and the creature&rsquo;s hit points and placement were tracked along with everyone else&rsquo;s. And that is assuming just one of it was summoned!<br/><br/>And if the PC took the Augment Summoning feat as well, introducing more changes to the summoned monster&rsquo;s stats, well... at least it made a good opportunity to go get some more snacks.<br/><br/>Ideally, this sort of situation could be avoided because- whether player or GM- the person whose character would be most likely to cast one of these spells would come to the table with the appropriate stats created beforehand, ready to be pulled out as needed. Unfortunately, it rarely works like that, as players tend to have little idea of what situations their characters will be facing until they actually happen, and GMs can only hazard a guess as to what their PCs will do in response to the threats they face. Really, the only possible way to be prepared ahead of time would be if you wrote out the stats for all possible summoned creatures, with their Augmented and non-Augmented incarnations, before you sat down.

Dreams of Witchtown is a 2D side scrolling action RPG. Players control the elderly witch Aurora, as she embarks on a quest to save her world from the sinister forces trying to destroy it. Players can defeat enemies to increase their level, and save progress. The game is a prequel to Nightmare in Witchtown, which is another initial project thought up by the developers.<br/><br/>The game was submitted for peer playtest and then peer review in December 2009. Although playtest is not required it is recommended to help catch hardware and software problems within the game, as well as to receive feedback from other Microsoft Creators Club members. The game officially released to the Xbox Live Marketplace on January 13, 2010 along with a trial-game, allowing players to try the game. The game has been released for 80 points which is approximately $1 on the Xbox Live Marketplace.<br/><br/>Gameplay<br/><br/>The gameplay in Dream of Witchtown has action, adventure and RPG elements. The combat is real-time and fast paced. Aurora gains additional spells and abilities as the player progresses through the game defeating bosses. When an enemy is defeated they will drop experience bubbles which can be collected to level up. Leveling up gives Aurora additional health and magic. Progress can be saved at many different save locations throughout the game. There are also shops throughout the game where a player can replenish their health and magic potions which are almost essential during the boss fights.<br/><br/>Like most platform games, Dreams of Witchtown is also littered with coins and health items. The coins you collect either floating around on each stage or in barrels can be used in a shop to buy items like health and magic potions. Health items, shown as apples, are used to help regain health and are really useful if you run out of health potions. The game also has multiple save locations that are extremely helpful so that you'll never have to start over if you die.<br/><br/>The most important aspect of Dreams of Witchtown is leveling up. The game can be classed as a &quot;grinder&quot; which will have the player repeatedly attacking enemies and collecting items for the all important reason of levelling up to take on tougher enemies.<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;Dreams of Witchtown&quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "84280": {"rpgdesigner": ["Ross Payton"], "rpgitemversion": ["PDF version"], "rpgseries": ["Full Metal Zero"], "name": "Prototype: Elite Operative", "rpgartist": ["Jason Walton"], "rpgproducer": ["Louis Porter, Jr. Design Studio"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic818108.jpg", "usersrated": "0", "average": "0", "statistics": [], "rpg": ["d20 Modern"], "rpgpublisher": ["Devil's Workshop", "Louis Porter Jr. Design, Inc."], "poll": [], "rpgcategory": ["Sourcebook (rules/options to enhance play)"], "rpggenre": ["Action / Adventure", "Crime (Spy / Espionage)", "Modern"], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic818108_t.jpg", "description": "From publisher blurb:<br/><br/>Espionage is usually the domain of specialists.

The job of creating an interactive story was a bit more work than I originally imagined. This game took approximately 80 hours of actual code writing with countless more hours reading the IF guides, playing competition entries from the past few years and generally reading up on what has taken place in the IF community in recent years. I grew up with the Infocom games and was pleased to see that the community is alive and well. I'd like to thank the IF community for their help and contributions. I would especially like to thank my beta testers: Chris Cenotti, Jessica Knoch, Vivienne Dunstan and Al. My game grew almost half again in size (not so much in terms of rooms but in terms of interactive objects and extended verbs) thanks to their comments and suggestions. Their efforts in testing are greatly appreciated (though all errors that remain are my own).<br/><br/>If you are stuck, type HINTS to get clues ranging from a gentle nudge to a nearly complete walkthrough. If you want to contact the author regarding this game, feel free to do so at daveber@gis.net. I hope that you enjoyed this adventure and would encourage new authors to enter into the competition for next year!<br/><br/>Post Competition: Well... the IF-Comp has come and gone. Identity placed 15th out of 36 entries. Not bad, but I had hoped to do better. I fixed the known technical issues that were uncovered during the competition - fortunately there were not many. I ended up with a lot of good constructive feedback and will continue to work towards better IF. Thanks to everyone that participated in the review process!

However, being young once, himself, your humble narrator understands the allure of lost and mysterious treasure, and will satisfy his conscience with the knowledge that the intrepid adventurer will, at the least, be forewarned and thus fore-armed by the knowledge imparted in this document.<br/><br/>This 14-page PDF is easy-to-integrate and just the sort of thing needed for DMs to add depth to any great d20 fantasy campaign world and gaming session.<br/><br/>"}, "84345": {"rpgartist": ["Ig Barros", "Louis Porter, Jr. Design Studio"], "rpgitemversion": ["PDF version"], "poll": [], "name": "Master Performers: Sourcebook for Bards, Rogues and Assassins", "rpgdesigner": ["Richard Farrese"], "rpgproducer": ["Louis Porter, Jr. Design Studio"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic818463.jpg", "usersrated": "0", "average": "0", "statistics": [], "rpg": ["d20 System / OGL Product (D&D 3.0 Compatible)"], "rpgpublisher": ["Devil's Workshop", "Louis Porter Jr. Design, Inc."], "rpgcategory": ["Sourcebook (rules/options to enhance play)"], "rpggenre": ["Fantasy"], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic818463_t.jpg", "description": "From publisher blurb:<br/><br/>This sourcebook presents all kinds of new and unusual types of artists and performers.

The coven was arranged by rank, the lower ranks belonging to witches of lesser abilities and the thirteenth rank occupied by a creature known only as the Crone.

After Britain refused to deliver newly ordered Turkish battleships, the Turko-German fleet bombarded Russian forts, signaling the Ottoman Empire&rsquo;s entrance into World War One.<br/><br/>Ottoman Sunset 2nd edition, by designer Darin Leviloff, is a stand-alone solitaire States of SiegeTM game on World War One in the Near East from 1914-1918. The player controls the Young Turks (CUP or Committee of Union and Progress) as they try to keep the Ottoman Empire alive amidst the struggles of the Great War.<br/><br/>After many years of being the &ldquo;Sick man of Europe,&rdquo; by the late 19th century the Ottoman Empire attempted to reform and modernize itself. Ironically, such attempts convinced restive nationalities such as the Greeks, Romanians, Bulgarians, etc., to assert their independence and/or seek to expand their territory.<br/><br/>This weakness caused other Imperial Powers to seize Ottoman territory, both formally and informally. By the outbreak of World War One, the Ottoman Empire was reduced to a core of territory in Asia Minor, the Levant, the Hejaz, Mesopotamia, and a sliver of European territory. This collapse led the military-political leadership in Turkey to take over under the guise of the Young Turks.<br/><br/>The Ottoman Empire began with lofty strategic goals, but soon faced a hard slog, defending its core empire against far-flung British-led forces, Russian armies, and a Hashemite Arab revolt. Furthermore, ongoing campaigns on other fronts, such as those with Austria against Romania in the East, against Italy on the Isonzo, and of course the draining stalemate of the Western Front had a direct impact on events in this theater. Like Austria-Hungary, the Ottoman Empire needed direct German aid to keep it in the conflict.<br/><br/>Despite victories at Kut and Gallipoli, by October 1918, the Turks had about all they could take and surrendered.

The primary weapons can be upgraded by collecting multiple &quot;Power P's&quot; that float throughout the stage. The secondary bombs work on a similar principle; they are obtained by collecting circles with corresponding letters in them. The bombs, however, are limited in supply to however many the player can collect.<br/><br/>Both the weapons and bombs can be progressively upgraded throughout the game. When a player has acquired a particular type of weapon, she can upgrade her weapon level by collecting several of the same circles in a row. Each time another matching circle is collected, the weapon is upgraded. This is limited to five upgrades.<br/><br/>Using the same method, bombs can also be upgraded. When a bomb is upgraded, it becomes twice as powerful, but also consumes twice as much ammunition.<br/><br/>Money can be found randomly floating through the levels, or being released by destroyed objects or enemies; it can be used to purchase upgrades in a shop in between levels.<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;Gun Nac&quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "84472": {"rpgdesigner": ["Neal Bailey"], "rpg": ["d20 Modern"], "statistics": [], "name": "Rocketships of Pulp Destruction", "rpgartist": ["Louis Porter, Jr. Design Studio"], "rpgproducer": ["Louis Porter, Jr. Design Studio"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic819649.jpg", "usersrated": "0", "rpgitemversion": ["PDF version"], "average": "0", "rpggenre": ["Action / Adventure (Pulp)", "Science Fiction (Space Opera)"], "rpgpublisher": ["Devil's Workshop", "Louis Porter Jr. Design, Inc."], "rpgcategory": ["Sourcebook (rules/options to enhance play)"], "poll": [], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic819649_t.jpg", "description": "From publisher blurb:<br/><br/>Alien cover-ups.

Set in the tumultuous and somewhat barbaric eleventh century of Scotland, the play tells the story of a heroic warrior, Macbeth, who is driven into a bloody series of murders and horror by his own unbridled ambition and the supernatural forces of darkness, manifested in the form of fatal prophecies. However, as one sees his actions become increasingly vile and depraved, one is still reminded of his humanity and former worth by the pangs of guilt which he suffers in moments of solitude and by the strong bonds of love that connect him to his equally ambitious wife. Herein we realize that the tragedy is not the murders of kings, friends, and children, or the havoc caused by civil war. It is, in fact, the knowledge that a hero has succumbed to the weaknesses inherent in the human race and, embracing wickedness, becomes a villain. This RPG sourcebook focus on the history and setting of this well known Shakespeare piece and how to integrate it into your regular local gaming session. This sourcebook also comes with several adventures seed with different endings to this classic play.

Unfortunately, this added layer of complexity may prove daunting to some gamers. The mechanic often falls by the wayside as an afterthought, used only with great reluctance, and as a result, many gaming groups miss out on a rewarding aspect of d20 combat that makes it more than the simple &quot;attack-hit-attack-miss-repeat&quot; system it is often accused of being. Attacks of Opportunity should provide a basic outline of how attacks of opportunity work, as well as a number of ideas for using the attack of opportunity mechanic to its fullest potential. This 13-page PDF is an easy-to-integrate items and just the sort of thing needed for DMs to add depth to any great d20 fantasy campaign world and gaming session.<br/><br/>"}, "84491": {"rpgdesigner": ["Leon Collins"], "rpgitemversion": ["PDF version"], "rpgseries": ["Tactics & Strategies"], "name": "Trip Attack", "rpgartist": ["Louis Porter, Jr. Design Studio"], "rpgproducer": ["Louis Porter, Jr. Design Studio"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic819710.jpg", "usersrated": "0", "average": "0", "statistics": [], "rpg": ["d20 System / OGL Product (D&D 3.0 Compatible)"], "rpgpublisher": ["Devil's Workshop", "Louis Porter Jr. Design, Inc."], "poll": [], "rpgcategory": ["Sourcebook (rules/options to enhance play)"], "rpggenre": ["Fantasy"], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic819710_t.jpg", "description": "From publisher blurb:<br/><br/>Like the attack of opportunity, the trip attack is often ignored or underutilized in many d20 games. Many gamers find its value somewhat dubious, choosing instead to focus on other aspects of combat with more immediately obvious benefits. Even among those who do make use of trip attacks, many only bother in dire circumstances, almost as a last resort. This, however, means that many gaming troupes miss out on a very rewarding part of the d20 system. There are a number of potential ways one might use a trip attack to better his or her situation. From a tactical standpoint, the trip attack need not always preempt one&rsquo;s own defeat. It can be quite useful in &ldquo;pushing&rdquo; combat encounters in a favorable direction.<br/><br/>"}, "84492": {"rpgdesigner": ["John Alger"], "rpg": ["d20 Modern", "d20 System / OGL Product (D&D 3.5 Compatible)"], "statistics": [], "name": "Spy Radios and Cipher Devices", "rpgartist": ["Jole Grahn"], "rpgproducer": ["Chris Cant"], "usersrated": "1", "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic819731.jpg", "rpgitemversion": ["PDF version"], "rpgsetting": ["1948"], "average": "5", "rpggenre": ["Action / Adventure (Pulp)", "War"], "rpgpublisher": ["Bloodstone Press"], "rpgcategory": ["Sourcebook (rules/options to enhance play)"], "poll": [], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic819731_t.jpg", "description": "From the publisher:<br/><br/>This supplement features 15 different communication devices for clandestine operatives  of the early and mid 20th century.

Published in the 14th Century, it claims to be an accurate travel guide of the unknown and sensational East. The book relates the travels of the author through Griffin-infested India and bizarre kingdoms of dog-headed people. Being nonsense, it sold like hotcakes. For a modern day example, picture what would result if a role-player had grabbed his DM's notes after a game, stuffed it full of second- and third-hand geography, added a bunch of creatures to it and published it as a Guide to Iraq, complete with manticores and talking statues. Of course, it would be a supermarket check-out aisle bestseller. More importantly, The Travels' is filled with the kind of fantasy that a DM can truly make use of. The average group of adventurers travels to far and distant lands in search of treasure...and usually finds creatures whose stats they're memorized and magic items whose gold piece value they know by heart. After all, mountain of orcs after mountain of orcs starts to make ever the most avid player's eyes glaze over. Presented herein is the first of series of things and tales truly fantastic done in Mandeville's style. Following are places, peoples, items, and monsters that are new, different, and memorable. These are things that players will ask the DM to describe twice, smiling, and talk about after the game. This is a break from the confines of The Big Book of D&amp;D Monsters Whose Tricks You Memorized at Age 12. Let the players beware. They have no idea what's going to hit them.
