However, a secret war is being fought to free mankind from their servitude. The game A Study in Emerald fleshes out this core idea by including historical figures from the late nineteenth century, most being persons involved in the anarchist movement of the time.<br/><br/>Deck-building forms the core of the game. You use influence cubes to bid for the right to draft cards and take control of cities. Each player has a secret identity, either a Restorationist fighting against the creatures or a Loyalist attempting to defend the status quo. Which side you are on determines what you score points for. An additional twist is that the performance of other players on the same side as you can stop you from winning if they are doing particularly badly, so you really want to know who is on which side. More specifically, when the game ends &ndash; and this can result from multiple causes, such as a marker on the War or Revolution track hitting 15 or the assassination of a Restorationist player agent &ndash; then the sides compare their scores; which side has the lowest score automatically loses, then the player with the highest score on the remaining team wins the game.<br/><br/>The game takes around ninety minutes to play and is more complex than most, so more suitable for the experienced gamer.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": ["English first edition"], "average": "7.2724", "name": "A Study in Emerald", "playingtime": "90", "boardgamemechanic": ["Area Control / Area Influence", "Auction/Bidding", "Card Drafting", "Deck / Pool Building", "Hand Management", "Partnerships", "Point to Point Movement"], "age": "13", "usersrated": "2538", "boardgamesubdomain": ["Strategy Games"], "boardgamefamily": ["Characters: Sherlock Holmes", "Crowdfunding: Kickstarter", "Cthulhu Mythos"], "boardgamepodcastepisode": ["39: Boardgame Cthulhu", "Board2Death Podcast Episode 5 - Introductions Round One", "Cantrip 5: Martin Wallace at Essen Spiel 2014", "clp043 \u2013 cubelove podcast \u2013 Martin Wallace Short Review Smackdown", "Episode 15: Voluspa and Tash-Kalar", "Episode 31: Five Tribes and Keri Hot Seat", "Episode 47 - The Cthulhu Mob", "Episode 53 -- The First Time Ever I Saw Your Meeple", "Episode 9 - The Council Chamber", "Episode 92 -- This Endless Whack-a-Mole", "Essen 2013 - Martin Wallace", "ET94: Dos Euros en la carrera por el Polo Sur (Toma 2!)", "I've Been Diced! episode 51: The PrezCon 2014 edition", "I've Been Diced! episode 62: Our 2014 in review", "Papstinenser er i luften", "Podcast #082 - Top 2013 parte 2", "Podcast: Di\u00f3genes Busca Juego 04 \u2013 El doble filo del Crowdfunding", "Supporting Ancient Overlords and A Study in Emerald", "The Long View - A Study in Emerald", "[Actus] N\u00b043-A Olivier devient Mormon en cellule, Cobra fait un Daybreak, les Bots braillent, Munchkin rends riche et c\u2019est la tuile pour X-Wings !"]}, "141518": {"statistics": [], "name": "Freedom Stick", "usersrated": "0", "videogamehardwarecategory": ["Controller"], "videogamehwversion": ["North American Freedom Stick"], "average": "0", "videogamehardware": ["Atari 2600", "Atari 7800", "Atari 8-bit family", "Commodore 64", "NES", "SEGA Master System"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1709180.jpg", "poll": [], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1709180_t.jpg", "videogamehwmfg": ["Camerica"], "description": "Back of Box<br/><br/>Features:<br/><br/><br/>     Wireless remote control eliminates messy wires<br/><br/><br/><br/>     Feel and action of an arcade joystick<br/><br/><br/><br/>     8 Direction precision micro action puts you in control<br/><br/><br/><br/>     Infrared receiver with universal adapator makes Freedom Stick Wireless Remote Control compatible with Nintendo, Sega, Atari 2600, 7800 and XE and Commodore 64, C64 and C128<br/><br/><br/><br/>     Automatic rapid fire or manual fire will help improve your scores<br/><br/><br/><br/>     Play 1 and 2 player games plus 2 player simultaneous games (requires 2 Freedom Stick Wireless Remote Control units)<br/><br/><br/><br/>     Multi directional signal allows freedom of movement<br/><br/><br/><br/>     Operates at maximum efficiency up to 18' away from infrared receiver<br/><br/><br/><br/>     Suction cups provided for optimum stability<br/><br/><br/><br/>     Requires 4 AA alkaline batteries (not included)<br/><br/><br/>Electronic Gameplayer Magazine writes<br/><br/>&quot;Freedom Stick wireless remote control by Camerica Corporation is a real breakthrough in joystick technology.<br/><br/>Those annoying wires are finally gone with no loss of control or performance.<br/><br/>In fact, Freedom Stick wireless remote control's 8 direction precision micro action provides the same type of precise control found in arcade joysticks.

A challenging card game with a great balance of skill and luck, and lots of interesting card combinations. Average play time is around 10 minutes per race, with the players deciding how many races they want to play in order to decide the championship winner, allowing Final Lap to be played as a time filler, or an entire evening of entertainment.<br/><br/>Players each manage a racing team of two cars and compete in a number of races through to see who can accumulate the most championship points and become the champion. In each race players need to correctly manage their hand of cards, reaping the biggest rewards possible from their good cards, and reducing the negative imapct suffered from their bad ones, to ensure the cars in their team score as many championship points as possible.<br/><br/>Championship points are only scored in a race by the cars that finish in the top 6 positions.  At the beginning of each race the cars are laid out in the reverse finishing order from the previous race.  Each player is dealt a hand of cards and during a race a player must use all of the cards in their hand.   As a car finishing in last place will ensure that it begins qualifying in the following race in first position, it is therefore beneficial for cars to finish as low as possible in a race if they do not finish in the top 6 positions, which results some very interesting and tactical game play.<br/><br/>After the cars are laid out in order at the beginning of a race, and players have received their hand of cards, qualifying will take place.  Certain cards can be used during qualifying or during a race.  If a player uses a card during qualifying to improve the qualifying order of one or both of their cars, they will discard the card and draw a random card to replace it.  Since players must use all of the cards in their hand during a race, they will need to evaluate whether they can afford to use such cards during qualifying as it may result it them drawing a very bad card as a replacement.<br/><br/>During a race players can have their cars take pit stops.  When a car takes it pit stop it allows the players to discard a card from their hand without having to play it, which acts as an outlet to remove bad cards from a players hand.  Pit stops need to be managed effectively as they can only be taken by cars that require them, and any cards not discarded through pit stops must be played even if they have severely negative consequences for your cars.<br/><br/>Excellent hand management is crucial in this game.  After you receive your hand of cards you need to formulate a race plan, working out how to get the most out of the cards you&rsquo;ve been dealt.  Adaptability is also key, being able to change a race plan or abandon it altogether as interactions with other players may not go as expected.<br/><br/>Final Lap is a hugely flavourful card game, with a whole range of racing events covered by cards, including qualifying, pit stops, crashes, oil spills, spin outs, tyre punctures, yellow flags, team orders, defensive lines, slip streaming, car setup, racing strategies, repairs and mechanical problems with engines and gear boxes.<br/><br/>"}, "141527": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1638715.jpg", "poll": [], "boardgamedesigner": ["Ivan Turner"], "statistics": [], "yearpublished": "2013", "maxplayers": "6", "boardgameartist": ["Chris Hanson"], "boardgamepublisher": ["9 Kingdoms Publications"], "maxplaytime": "40", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1638715_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "40", "boardgamecategory": ["Card Game", "Expansion for Base-game", "Horror", "Zombies"], "description": "Biker/Zombie is a promotional card and can be used with the ApocalypZe Card Game.<br/>This card was given out at PAX East - Boston, March 22-24, 2013<br/>(Boston Convention &amp;

I'm just like any other player.<br/><br/>Q: How does CHALLENGING work?<br/><br/>M: I always ask if there is any challenge at the end of each play. We will be playing according to the most recent rules regarding challenging. This means that if the challenged word is found to be a legal word, then the person challenging it loses his next turn. (By the way, don't be surprised if I challenge your word.)<br/><br/>Q: How does the game end, MONTY?<br/><br/>M: The game will end automatically as soon as one of the players has used all of his tiles and no more are available. However, if no one, including me, can think of a play using the tiles he has left, just choose menu option 7 to end the game.<br/><br/>Q: Any closing words, MONTY?<br/><br/>M: I hope I have cogently elucidated the salient points of the game.

Players try to find out which item was stolen by which person and where. For this you take over the role of the three investigators and their friends - Aunt Mathilda, Inspector Cotta and Uncle Titus. Every character has a special ability which can be used once per game (e.g. move a second time). Just like in the original version, players move on the board. As soon as they enter a room/place, they can ask questions about the crime. Each player has a certain amount of cards in his hand, 3 cards have been put to the side - they say where the crime took place, who the thief is and which item was stolen. It's the players' goal to solve the crime. With the help of questions and your cards, you try to find out as much as possible about the case so that you will be the one to solve the mystery in the end and predict which cards have been set aside.<br/>All items, characters and places are based on the adventures of the three investigators. The place where you can solve the mystery, for example, is the old house trainer in Uncle Titus' salvage yard.

El joven e inexperto emperador Hirohito no ha sido capaz de frenar a los altos mandos del ej&eacute;rcito, que se ha lanzado a una carrera por aumentar los dominios del imperio. Pero tras la r&aacute;pida y despiadada conquista de Manchuria, apenas finalizada unas semanas atr&aacute;s, el mundo ha puesto sus ojos en Jap&oacute;n y ha amenazado con imponer severas sanciones econ&oacute;micas al Imperio del Sol Naciente. Atrapado entre la espada y la pared, Jap&oacute;n busca una justificaci&oacute;n que legitime sus conquistas.<br/><br/>En las &uacute;ltimas semanas, de manera inesperada, el gobierno se ha topado con una posible justificaci&oacute;n para sus invasiones. En una peque&ntilde;a isla del mar Amarillo conocida como Yusa, frente a las costas de Manchuria, se han descubierto restos de vasijas e &iacute;dolos que parecen proceder de principios del per&iacute;odo Jomon (14.000 a.C.), es decir, que hay pruebas de la presencia de japoneses en la zona hace m&aacute;s de diez mil a&ntilde;os. &iquest;Es posible que las costas de Corea y Manchuria fueran, miles de a&ntilde;os atr&aacute;s, habitadas por japoneses? Iwao Seiichi, el ambicioso arque&oacute;logo de la Universidad Koyasan, descubridor de este fabuloso yacimiento, cree que fue as&iacute;, y que chinos y coreanos no son m&aacute;s que una rama perdida del pueblo japon&eacute;s, lo que justificar&iacute;a las injerencias imperiales en la zona.

The young and inexperienced Emperor Hirohito has not been able to curb the high command of the army, which has embarked on a race to increase the dominions of the empire. But after the rapid and ruthless conquest of Manchuria, just finished a few weeks ago, the world has its eyes on Japan and has threatened to impose severe economic sanctions on the Empire of the Rising Sun. Caught between a rock and a hard place, Japan seeks a justification to legitimize their conquests.<br/><br/>In recent weeks, unexpectedly, the government has come up with a possible justification for their invasion. On a Yellow Sea small island known as Yusa, off the coast of Manchuria, were discovered remains of pots and idols that appear to come from the early Jomon period (14,000 BC), ie no evidence of the presence of Japanese in the area for over ten thousand years. Is it possible that the coasts of Korea and Manchuria were thousands of years ago, inhabited by Japanese? Iwao Seiichi, the ambitious Koyasan University archaeologist who discovered this fabulous site, thinks so, and that Chinese and Koreans are not lost more than a branch of the Japanese people, justifying imperial interference in the area. Unfortunately, Professor Iwao and his assistants disappeared without trace two weeks ago, being totally paralyzed archaeological work.&quot;<br/><br/>"}, "141553": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1640022.jpg", "poll": [], "boardgamedesigner": ["James Desborough"], "statistics": [], "yearpublished": "2012", "maxplayers": "3", "boardgameartist": ["Darkzel"], "boardgamepublisher": ["Postmortem Studios"], "maxplaytime": "0", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1640022_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "0", "boardgamecategory": ["Card Game", "Expansion for Base-game", "Horror", "Humor", "Mature / Adult"], "description": "Spankham Asylum, a study-ground for those grappling with understanding strange fetishes and psychosexual condition.

In this wild west, gold-mining, city-building card game, you quickly find that you must be tenacious!<br/><br/>There&rsquo;s only so much gold in the hills and you must compete with rival prospectors to claim it. This deckbuilding game starts out relatively simple and becomes progressively more complex. Players begin the game with identical decks of cards that consist of basic resources such as labor, brick, lumber, food, and silver. They can use silver and eventually gold to trade these resources for more advanced resources in the market such as pickaxe, guns, leather, and paper. Different combinations of these resources allow players to purchase event cards, wanted cards, and building cards. As a result, these cards give individuals easier access to gold and provide a specified number of victory points.<br/><br/>To outmatch your opponents, your strategy may consist of cunning intellect or brutal aggression. Be the architect of a sluice box, which reduces the amount of labor needed to mine gold, or build a gangster hideout to attack your opponents.

It is named &ldquo;Isle of the Playful Moon&rdquo;. Twenty years ago, the owner of the island Mr Scotty lost its ownership on a hand of poker. The new owner an eccentric British entrepreneur decided to fulfil his dream by building a Luna Park on his new property. Sadly for him, the staff he chose to run the park were not the most suitable candidates for such endeavour...<br/>Years of poor maintenance and negligence have brought the park in a state of desertion and total disarray. Mr Funfair was ready to give up his dream and return home when he saw a small life boat named Shinky reaching his island. The teens in that life boat are the last survivors of a shipwreck and his only hope to restore his park and keep his dream alive.<br/><br/>So what is  Luna Park World? We could say that it is an amalgam of tantalizing strategic thought, high adrenaline and suspense! The variety of the gameplay modes as well as the different ways to move around the board, ensure that no two games will ever be the same.<br/><br/>Let's talk about the Gameplay Modes. <br/><br/>    First comes the Competitive mode. In this mode each player chooses one of the teen heroes and competes against his friends in a fast paced duel of wits and will. The goal of this mode is to collect more keys and trophies as well as unlock more games and rides than the competitors. The players also have three potions  in their hands, each of them granting a different boon. <br/>    The second mode is a co-operative one we call &lsquo;Mayhem&rsquo;. This is because up to 12 players can participate in this breathtaking yet unforgiving mode. The players choose among the six heroes or the six guardians (each one with his unique special ability) and participate in a chaotic race against the other team. The teens try to unlock all the games and rides of the park and the guardians to stop and arrest them! <br/>    The last mode and - needless to say - our pride is the Campaign mode. You may choose a teen hero and lead him through a series of quests and stages to obtain the title &quot;Lord of the Keys&quot;. Unfortunately, the guardians of Luna Park World will make the journey of the hero even harder by placing traps and chasing the hero around. So buy potions, act wisely and maybe at the end of the campaign you will be the one holding the One Key. <br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": ["First Edition"], "age": "4", "name": "Luna Park World: Island", "playingtime": "30", "boardgamemechanic": ["Area Movement", "Dice Rolling"], "average": "4.1", "usersrated": "1", "boardgamefamily": ["Crowdfunding: Kickstarter"]}, "141584": {"statistics": [], "bgaccessoryversion": ["Meeple Source edition", "Stainless steel edition"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1831719.jpg", "description": "Heart tokens that replace the cubes in the Love Letter card game.<br/><br/>", "usersrated": "35", "average": "8.02857", "boardgameaccessory": ["Love Letter"], "boardgamepublisher": ["(Self-Published)", "Meeple Source"], "poll": [], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1831719_t.jpg", "name": "Love Letter: Heart Tokens"}, "141585": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1641947.jpg", "poll": [], "boardgamedesigner": ["Ben Hughes"], "statistics": [], "yearpublished": "2013", "maxplayers": "4", "boardgameartist": ["Liz Gridley"], "boardgamepublisher": ["(Self-Published)", "Ambivalent Overlord Games"], "maxplaytime": "60", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1641947_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "60", "boardgamecategory": ["Dice", "Horror", "Science Fiction", "Zombies"], "description": "A strategy board game for 2-4 players.<br/><br/>Based on classic B-movies, Zombies, Aliens &amp; Monsters (oh my!) simulates a city under siege from a horde of zombies, invading aliens and a rampaging monster all at the same time!<br/><br/>A bustling city, just another day...

Take your intrepid crew on missions, earn prestige, upgrade your ship.  Solve a galactic crisis.  And do it all faster than your opponents, because they want to be in charge too.<br/>End of box<br/><br/>You are in command of a space vessel from one of the major powers of the Portable Galactic Empire (Human, Brerasan, Hragsh or Jasl-Riin). You want to become the fleet admiral.<br/><br/>You begin the game with a frigate from your race with a power/up grade cost of 1.  One level 1 crew member (orange shirt AKA (also known as) Operations, or a green shirt AKA Marine, or a blue shirt AKA Command) think Star Trek shirts with the colors changed.<br/><br/>You also draw one level 1 Component card.  there are four types (weapons, power, sensors and defence). Each of these card types has three specialty sub groups in their category.  When you add these cards to your ship you put them under your player board (ship), similar to Glory to Rome.<br/><br/>Game play:<br/>There are two decks of cards (component and crew).  On your turn you go on a &quot;mission&quot;.  An 8 sided die is rolled. Four symbols on the die match the crew deck, 4 match the component deck, 1 thumbs up and 1 explosion. If you roll a symbol with one of the two deck symbols you draw one card from that deck.  On the upper portion of the card there will be one or two symbols.  If you don't have Crew or Components that match the symbol or symbols the mission is failed. If you can match the first card you must roll again and draw another card. Now you must be able to match up evenly with what is on the cards to what is on your ship.  Lets say the first card required a missile.  This is a subset of the weapon card.  So if you have a weapon card on your ship it must also be specific to the missile to pass phase one of this mission.  The second card drawn required an orange shirt.  Lets say you only have a green shirt assigned to the security section of your ship.  No worries. As captain you count as one crewman of any shirt color.  You have passed the second part of the mission. You could push your luck and roll the die again for a third part of the mission, but if you fail the requirement of the third card the entire mission fails.  So you stop at two.  You may now attach these cards to your ship if you wish. The first card was a crewman. You assign his orange shirt self to your medical station. The second card was Defenses, sub-set shields. You put it on your ship.  These cards now help you win future missions.<br/><br/>If you roll the thumbs up symbol you pick a card from either deck and auto pass that stage no matter what.  If it is the explosion the whole mission is failed, no matter what.  There are a few more rules in this area but that's the bulk.<br/><br/>As missions progress you can use cards earned from winning missions to upgrade your ship.  Bigger ship equals more crew that can be attached and more powerful weapons.  When you upgrade to a battleship a crisis starts to perk.  This is abstract.  At the beginning of a players turn (battleship or higher in possession) a crisis chit is placed in a pool on the table.  Once that pool grows to double the amount of players a crisis has begun.

Most sorcerers have arcane lineages that tend to fall into fairly straightforward and easy to define categories. This sorcerer is descended from a dragon, and has a draconic bloodline. That sorcerer is descended from a devil, and has an infernal bloodline. But there are some sorcerous lineages that are unique unto themselves, and which, for various reasons, have developed unique powers, specific to a single family tree. This book is about those arcane ancestries.<br/><br/>While a standard sorcerer bloodline gives you mechanical abilities that match a tightly focused theme, it doesn&rsquo;t give you very much in the way of background and flavor, and their narrow focus approaches a scientific or clinical categorization. By contrast, each of the ten bloodlines in this book has a rich and unique identity, which is not only reflected in their unique bloodline abilities, but also in extensive background sections which detail the origins of the bloodline, as well as providing some insight into what life is like for members of the bloodline, and information on how other sorcerers with that bloodline live and act, not only giving prospective players great starting points for building their character&rsquo;s background and personality, but also offering fully-formed arcane families or organizations that a GM can use to make the game world a more dynamic and interesting place, even if none of his players are interested in sorcerers.<br/><br/>If you&rsquo;ve ever wondered just where your sorcerer got his magic powers, or thought that an arcane aristocracy was a cool idea, or even if you&rsquo;re just looking for a new set of bloodline powers to try or even just something fun to spark your imagination, this is the book for you.<br/><br/>"}, "141596": {"rpgartist": ["(Uncredited)"], "rpg": ["Pathfinder System Compatible Product"], "poll": [], "name": "The Book of Martial Action", "rpgdesigner": ["Joel Migas", "Alex Riggs", "Joshua Zaback"], "rpgproducer": ["Rosa Gibbons"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1640734.jpg", "usersrated": "0", "rpgitemversion": ["PDF version"], "average": "0", "statistics": [], "rpggenre": ["Fantasy (High Fantasy)"], "rpgpublisher": ["Necromancers of the Northwest"], "rpgcategory": ["Sourcebook (rules/options to enhance play)"], "rpgseries": ["A Necromancer's Grimoire"], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1640734_t.jpg", "description": "From publisher blurb:<br/><br/><br/>Barbarians, Fighters, and Rogues, Rejoice!<br/><br/>It seems that there are really two ways to go about playing Pathfinder and similar d20 games: you can be a spellcaster, and have all kinds of crazy options to choose from, or you can be a more mundane, martial character, and, well&hellip;not. Sure, barbarians get rage powers and paladins can smite evil, and if you devote a bunch of feats to it you might get a couple of nifty tricks like two-weapon fighting or spring attacking, but at the end of the day most mundane characters spend their combat rounds doing full attack after full attack, and eventually that gets a little stale.<br/><br/>There have been attempts in the past to make fighters and their ilk more interesting to play, but all too often these rely on giving these characters magical (or at least supernatural) powers, and if you just want your character to be able to do cool things with a sword that demonstrate that he&rsquo;s well-trained and knows a lot of useful techniques, that&rsquo;s too bad, because your only options are using your sword to shoot laser beams and fly, or else falling back on the good old-fashioned full attack. Plus, they often require taking a special class, or using complex rules that are difficult to integrate into your game.<br/><br/>This book aims to provide a way for martially-inclined characters of any class to be more interesting without falling back on the supernatural. Through over 50 feats and seven very detailed archetypes, A Necromancer&rsquo;s Grimoire: The Book of Martial Action will introduce you to the world of martial action points, a renewable resource that can be spent on a wide variety of martial techniques that allow your character to perform extraordinary&mdash;but decidedly non-magical&mdash;maneuvers, making combat wildly more dynamic and ensuring that you can always do something more interesting than a full attack.<br/><br/>"}, "141597": {"rpgartist": ["James M.

The items that can be created with Craft (alchemy) tend not to be worth the effort once one gets past the first few levels of the game (and even before that their value is questionable). The alchemist class has almost nothing to do with Craft (alchemy), and its extracts don&rsquo;t feel alchemical so much as they do like spellcasting by another name. For years, players who wanted a character who toiled away crafting mad concoctions and brewing strange potions had to accept that such activities would never be of any real use in the game.<br/><br/>A Necromancer&rsquo;s Grimoire: The Wonders of Alchemy aims to change all that, by providing a huge assortment of new things to make with Craft (alchemy), and introducing a new approach to the skill that greatly increases its relevance. This book introduces two new kinds of alchemical substances: infusions, which are alchemical concoctions that permanently alter the physical makeup of those who use them, and serums, which are potent alchemical substances that can be pumped directly into a subject&rsquo;s blood, and whose effects can be stacked for greater efficacy, but which carry a risk of negative side-effects if too high a dose is taken. Beyond that, the book contains 50 new alchemical wondrous items (mainly in the form of elixirs, oils, and tonics, but with a few others as well), which can be crafted either through the normal process for wondrous items, or through a new application of the Craft (alchemy) skill.<br/><br/>So, whether you&rsquo;ve always wished that your alchemy was a little more magical, or if you just want over 100 new poisons, wondrous items, serums, and infusions, this is the book for you.

No matter what you need, the knights of the crucible can be a valuable addition to fantasy games of any sort.<br/><br/>"}, "141608": {"rpgartist": ["(Uncredited)"], "rpg": ["Pathfinder System Compatible Product"], "statistics": [], "name": "Character Guide: The Gentleman Thief", "rpgdesigner": ["Joshua Zaback"], "rpgproducer": ["Rosa Gibbons"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1643638.jpg", "usersrated": "0", "rpgitemversion": ["PDF version"], "average": "0", "rpggenre": ["Fantasy (High Fantasy)"], "rpgpublisher": ["Necromancers of the Northwest"], "rpgcategory": ["Sourcebook (rules/options to enhance play)"], "poll": [], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1643638_t.jpg", "description": "From publisher blurb:<br/><br/><br/>So You Think You Can Steal?<br/><br/>Anyone with a few ranks in Sleight of Hand can be a pick-pocket, and it only takes a cudgel to be a mugger, but there is another class of thief as well, the cr&egrave;me-de-la-cr&egrave;me of crime, which has stolen hearts and captivated imaginations for hundreds of years: the gentleman thief. These princes of the night possess great cunning and guile, and prefer to outwit their opponents, instead of overpower them. They are also gifted with great charm, which allows them to win over the hearts of even those they steal from. Despite their crimes, it&rsquo;s often all but impossible not to sympathize and secretly root for these dastardly scoundrels, and many are considered heroes.<br/><br/>It&rsquo;s hard to be the best, though, and the role of gentleman thief is a hard one to play. That&rsquo;s where Character Guides: The Gentleman Thief comes in. This book examines the archetype of the gentleman thief, providing perspective on what truly makes them what they are, and how you can go about making a memorable and effective gentleman thief character for the Pathfinder Roleplaying Game or the 3.5 OGL, both from the perspective of roleplaying advice and information, and more mechanical angles, such as what feats, magic items, and so on will lend themselves best to well-prepared cat burglar, and a brand new prestige class specifically for those who want to be a gentleman thief.<br/><br/>Additionally, the book provides GMs with a wealth of information about running games involving gentleman thieves, with a close look at some of the more common difficulties that these types of characters can cause in an adventuring party, and how to resolve them, as well as advice on how to best support gentleman thief characters by providing them with ways to put their persona to good use.<br/><br/>"}, "141609": {"rpgartist": ["(Uncredited)"], "rpg": ["Pathfinder System Compatible Product"], "poll": [], "name": "Advanced Arcana, Volume III", "rpgdesigner": ["Alex Riggs", "Joshua Zaback"], "rpgproducer": ["Rosa Gibbons"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1643635.jpg", "usersrated": "0", "rpgitemversion": ["PDF version"], "average": "0", "statistics": [], "rpggenre": ["Fantasy (High Fantasy)"], "rpgpublisher": ["Necromancers of the Northwest"], "rpgcategory": ["Sourcebook (rules/options to enhance play)"], "rpgseries": ["Advanced Arcana"], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1643635_t.jpg", "description": "From publisher blurb:<br/><br/><br/>Do You Believe in Magic?<br/><br/>The Advanced Arcana series has quickly developed a reputation for excellence, not just because the individual spells contained within these books are of the highest caliber, but because each book explores a theme, pushing the boundaries of what spells are capable of doing in the Pathfinder Roleplaying Game with innovative and groundbreaking new mechanics.

At over 100 pages, it not only contains over 100 new spells, but also contains alternate familiar options, alternate arcane bonds, and new rules covering the customization of spellbooks with exotic materials and inks, and a number of optional material components that can be used to enhance spells.<br/><br/>The original Advanced Arcana set a new standard for sourcebooks devoted to providing new spells for Pathfinder and 3.5 OGL games, by providing an overall theme into which the majority of the book's spells tied. In that book's case, the theme explored the question &quot;what is the cost of a spell,&quot; and included a number of spells that cost more or less than a single spell slot.<br/><br/>Advanced Arcana Volume II continues in the proud tradition of its predecessor, though in this book the theme is not the cost of a spell, but rather an exploration of spells that can produce a variety of different effects. The popular segmented spell mechanic makes a return in the form of layered segmented spells and variable segmented spells, both new twists on the original mechanic. The book also contains modal spells (spells that can have two or more very different effects, chosen as the spell is cast), and conditional spells (spells that function differently depending on certain conditions). And, of course, a goodly number of general, all purpose spells that don't tie directly into any mechanic, but simply serve to provide support for fun and exciting concepts, and additional options for spellcasters of all sorts.<br/><br/>"}, "141611": {"rpgartist": ["(Uncredited)"], "rpg": ["Pathfinder System Compatible Product"], "poll": [], "name": "Ancient Warriors: The Vikings", "rpgdesigner": ["Alex Riggs", "Joshua Zaback"], "rpgproducer": ["Rosa Gibbons"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1643609.jpg", "usersrated": "0", "rpgitemversion": ["PDF version"], "average": "0", "statistics": [], "rpggenre": ["Action / Adventure (Nautical)", "Fantasy (High Fantasy)", "History (Europe)"], "rpgpublisher": ["Necromancers of the Northwest"], "rpgcategory": ["Sourcebook (rules/options to enhance play)"], "rpgseries": ["Ancient Warriors"], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1643609_t.jpg", "description": "From publisher blurb:<br/><br/><br/>A-Viking We Will Go!<br/><br/>Vikings. These ancient warriors, seafarers, and explorers have left an undisputable mark on the course of western history.

In the East, a group of Vikings formed one of the most elite military units in the Byzantine Empire. They were far ahead of their time in terms of seamanship, and their extensive travels brought them to nearly every corner of the world, long before most of their contemporaries.<br/><br/>Now you, too, can harness the power of the Viking. This book takes a look at what it means to be a Viking, both from a historical perspective, providing information on Vikings in the way that historical evidence indicates they really were, and from a mythological perspective, providing information on the modern myth of the Viking, and the way that Vikings are seen today by many people, regardless of whether or not it&rsquo;s accurate, and also provides some advice and suggestions for running Viking-themed adventures.<br/><br/>Even better, though, Ancient Warriors: The Vikings provides seven brand new and highly expansive and detailed archetypes for a variety of classes, allowing them to bring out their inner berserker.

Class Expansions is a series of lightweight supplements for The Pathfinder Roleplaying Game that takes a base class and offers alternative class features that, handily enough, each fit on one page or less.<br/><br/>Following in this vein, Class Expansions: Hybrid Elemental Sorcerer Bloodlines introduces six new sorcerer bloodlines, each of which is a mixture of two of the classic elements.<br/><br/>     Clouds (Air + Water)  - Your nose has always been in a storybook. Notions of a lost age of wonder constantly flit about in your mind and the desire to either be one of the heroes of old or be the kindly old sage who raises them up is one of your secret desires. When the magic of your bloodline makes itself known, you take the opportunity to make your dreams a reality. The clouds bloodline focuses on beneficial force-multiplier spells, but those with their head in the clouds must beware. Whether you are giving or selfish alters everything about how the bloodline works.<br/>     Dust (Air + Earth) - Nothing is eternal save the fact that nothing is. Time wears down people, kings, cities, mountains, and even the gods themselves. You have been touched by the primordial dust, that which remains when something's course has been run. Around you, things break, magic ceases to function, and everything sprints toward its ultimate end. The dust bloodline focuses on the end of all things, the reduction of all that is to a homogenous, and stable, whole.<br/>     Magma (Earth + Fire) - The power of the world's mantle courses through your veins, strengthening you and searing you. The constant pain brings forth anger, and anger is an excuse to exercise your strength. The magma bloodline focuses on brutal evocations and getting up close and personal with melee weapons.<br/>     Mud (Earth + Water) - Nothing is truly static. Everything is constantly in flux, though sometimes it may move incredibly slowly. Those of the mud bloodline have the strength and power of earth with some of the fluid flexibility of water, thus turning them into masters of transmutation.<br/>     Smoke (Air + Fire) - A haze has been over your eyes and mind since a very young age. The world is seen as through a fog, making it dull and monochromatic. The specific distinctions that others make regarding the nature of the world seem too specific and almost pedantic. When your magic began to express itself, it did so in a way unlike most other spellcasters. To you, magic is simply magic. There is no evocation, no necromancy, no enchantment. There is only raw power and the will to use it. This philosophy renders you incapable of focusing on a particular school of magic, but it also renders protections agsinst specific schools and even subtypes of magic increasingly useless as your skills evolve.<br/>     Steam (Fire + Water) - Wildly opposing emotions flow through your mind at all times, making you reactive and somewhat unstable. When your magic finally expressed itself around puberty, it all started to make sense. The steam bloodline focuses on brutal evocation in the fire and cold subtype and allows the practitioner to quickly swap energy types and mix spell radii for maximum collateral damage.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>"}, "141614": {"boardgamedesigner": ["5th Door Designs"], "poll": [], "name": "Slangology", "playingtime": "30", "minplayers": "3", "yearpublished": "2013", "boardgameexpansion": ["153317"], "usersrated": "7", "maxplayers": "10", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1637172_t.jpg", "average": "6.21429", "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["Playroom Entertainment"], "boardgamepodcastepisode": ["The Party Gamecast Reviews - Slangology"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1637172.jpg", "boardgameversion": ["English first edition"], "maxplaytime": "30", "boardgamecategory": ["Party Game"], "age": "13", "minplaytime": "30", "description": "Game description from the publisher:<br/><br/>In Slangology, one player draws a card that shows several slang words and definitions.

The symbol cards are dealt out among the players, then they takes turns laying out one card at a time, with each new card covering the card that the player previously played. As soon as the cards in play match the conditions on one of the slap cards, players race to slap the slap card; the first player to do so claims the card, then a new one is revealed. (If you slap at the wrong time, you must return a previously claimed slap card.)<br/><br/>Whoever collects the most slap cards wins!<br/><br/>Quick Slap! Deluxe includes more symbol cards, more slap cards, and a bell.<br/><br/>"}, "141623": {"boardgamedesigner": ["(Uncredited)"], "average": "6", "poll": [], "name": "Spekulatius", "playingtime": "60", "minplayers": "3", "boardgamemechanic": ["Trick-taking"], "yearpublished": "0", "usersrated": "1", "maxplayers": "11", "boardgameartist": ["Uli Gutekunst"], "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["Ravensburger Spieleverlag GmbH", "WI-JO-KA-PRE Gbr"], "boardgameversion": ["First edition"], "maxplaytime": "60", "boardgamecategory": ["Card Game"], "age": "9", "minplaytime": "60", "description": "Spekulatius is a variant of the classic trick-taking game Oh Hell!.  The deck consists of four suits with cards in each suit numbered 1-20 and four jokers.  In each round of the game, players are dealt a certain number of cards -- for a typical game this starts at ten cards for the first round and one fewer each successive round, until the tenth round when players only receive one card, and then in each round thereafter players receive one more card per round until the nineteenth round where players again receive ten.<br/><br/>In each round, a card is turned up from the deck to show what suit is trump and players must speculate how many tricks they will take in the round.  Players must follow suit of the lead card when possible, and can play off or trump when they have a void in the lead suit.  The player who played the highest on-suit card or trump wins the trick and leads the next trick.<br/><br/>Jokers occupy a special space in the game -- they can always be played, and when the player plays a Joker, he or she announces whether it is &quot;top&quot; -- which means it is the best card that can be played, or &quot;flop&quot; which means it dodges the trick.  When more than one player plays a Joker in a round, the last-played Joker is controlling, meaning it would &quot;top&quot; a previously-played &quot;top&quot; joker.<br/><br/>At the end of the round, players score points based on how many tricks they took, one point per trick.  Players that successfully speculated their bid exactly receive a ten-point bonus to their score; thus an exactly-made bid of 3 nets 13 points, or an exactly-made bid of 0 nets 10 points.  The game is played over nineteen rounds (or ten for a short game), and the player with the highest score total is the winner.<br/><br/>The game lists that it is playable up to eleven people, but the deck of cards only has 84 in it.  The rules suggest with more people that players use the same progression of hands with fewer cards per player on the largest hands (e.g., thirteen rounds with eleven players, progressing 7-6-5 . . . 5-6-7).<br/><br/>"}, "141624": {"boardgamedesigner": ["5th Door Designs"], "poll": [], "name": "4 Letter Words", "playingtime": "15", "minplayers": "2", "yearpublished": "2013", "usersrated": "0", "boardgamefamily": ["Admin: Better Description Needed!"], "maxplayers": "8", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1638663_t.jpg", "average": "0", "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["Playroom Entertainment"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1638663.jpg", "boardgameversion": ["English first edition"], "maxplaytime": "15", "boardgamecategory": ["Card Game", "Word Game"], "age": "8", "minplaytime": "15", "description": "Game description from the publisher:<br/><br/>In 4 Letter Words, each round players receive thirteen cards and must make as many four-letter words as they can.

Some locations offer opportunities to start quests to gain survival items or allow you to explore more lands and gain better abilities.

Players place everyday objects on the table to act as terrain.<br/><br/>On his turn, a player activates a character. He may then move and attack by flicking the corresponding disc. A moving disc that hits terrain suffers no damage, but hitting other discs causes one damage to the active character. An attacking disc suffers a point of damage if it hits terrain and causes a point of damage to another character if it hits its disc. Knocking a disc into terrain or off the table inflicts an additional point of damage. A character is eliminated when it takes five points of damage. A character's ratings determine how many times it can move and attack each time it is activated. Optional item cards, if used, can be acquired during play and provide additional actions.<br/><br/>Disc Duelers includes several play options, including classic elimination, point capture (points scored for eliminating a character, but that character returns to action), soccer or volleyball with a neutral disc representing the ball, and a race.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": ["English first edition"], "average": "6.84151", "name": "Disc Duelers", "playingtime": "45", "boardgamemechanic": ["Variable Player Powers"], "age": "10", "boardgameexpansion": ["153152"], "usersrated": "271", "boardgamefamily": ["Finger Flicking Games", "World of Indines"], "boardgamepodcastepisode": ["TPGC - Episode #29 - Rampage, Disc Duelers and Fastrack"]}, "141654": {"videogamebg": ["Keno"], "name": "Mobile Keno", "videogamemode": ["Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["Mobile Device edition"], "average": "0", "videogametheme": ["Board Game"], "usersrated": "0", "videogamedeveloper": ["Webfoot Technologies"], "videogamegenre": ["Classic Games"], "videogameplatform": ["Other Mobile Devices"], "poll": [], "statistics": [], "videogamepublisher": ["Webfoot Technologies"], "videogamecompilation": ["Mobile Casino Game Pack"], "description": "Can't wait until your next trip to Vegas?

They visit the item shop to liquidate their treasure and buy a few more potions of healing. They go to the temple to have their wounds healed or their dead resurrected. It is assumed that the real action happens elsewhere, in the wilderness or in dungeons. Going &lsquo;back to town&rsquo; is synonymous with a break in the action.<br/><br/>But not so in Nywhere. A thriving town of 20,000 souls, Nywhere is a center of civilization, to be sure. But also an adventure in its own right. Your PCs will never be be bored again. Not with such fabulous locations to explore as:<br/><br/>     The Dewy Tulip - &ldquo;To refer to the Dewy Tulip as a &lsquo;house of ill repute&rsquo; within hearing of it&rsquo;s proprietress and manager, Madame Mabienne, is to find oneself kindly but firmly invited not to come again. The Dewy Tulip is a fashionable establishment with high standards and premium prices. Would-be guests are met at the door and expected to be washed thoroughly, dressed impeccably and have both ready cash and polished manners . . .&rdquo;<br/>     The Rack of Antlers Lodge - &ldquo;Few curses are as common as dry throats, sore feet and low spirits. Thankfully, the Rack of Antlers has cures for all three. A friendly, accessible, relatively inexpensive establishment, the Rack offers beer by the mug, simple kitchen fare and reasonably unlumpy beds . . .&rdquo;<br/>     The Temple of Climaxia, Goddess of Primal Sensation - &ldquo;Though the Temple may be much more often closed than open, the red-and-white-robed clergy are a regular sight around the district and the city at large. They maintain a regular daily booth in the Market Square just outside the gates of the Temple where they sell a selection of herbal preparations, highly provocative block-printed religious and instructional literature (most of it profusely illustrated), and frankly rude holy symbols and small devotional statuary . . .&rdquo;<br/>     The Gasmen&rsquo;s Guild Hall - &ldquo;The Professor is reputed to govern the Guild like some kind of secret fraternal order. The &lsquo;Third Order&rsquo; Gasmen one encounters walking the streets tending the lamps are, if asked, likely to say they have never even seen him in person . . .&rdquo;<br/>     The Suds&rsquo; Sea Bottom Bathhouse - &ldquo;Separate changing accommodations are available for men and women, after which patrons then enter separate &lsquo;scrub rooms&rsquo; where they first soap up, then rinse off. Then they make their way into the large, mixed-gender pool. Horse play, monkey business and cat calls are all strictly forbidden . . .&rdquo;<br/>     Church of Polypod - &ldquo;Not exactly a popular place but certainly a well-known one, the Church of Polypod hulks in a blind cul-de-sac, it&rsquo;s doors overarched with carvings of weird, uneuclidean geometry, intertwined with relief-carvings of the oozing appendages of the Church&rsquo;s horrid Tentacle Gods. It&rsquo;s lime-green-robed clergy and parishioners--to the extent that anyone is willing to identify themselves as such--are particularly unwelcome in and around the precincts of the School for Girls, run by the Convent of Our Lady of Scornful Regard . . .&rdquo;<br/>     Blastington Arms - &ldquo;While many city residents still have recourse to swords and daggers to protect their lives and property, larger and cruder weapons like battle-axes, spears and longbows are beginning to be regarded as a bit anachronistic (except perhaps by dwarves or half-orcs, whose respect for a good axe or warhammer goes beyond its utility as a weapon and crosses over into the realm of aesthetic appreciation) . . .&rdquo;<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>The Town of Nywhere is an urban gazetteer for PCs to explore, combined with three short adventures for the GM to run in town. Included are all necessary 1&rdquo; square encounter maps for use with miniatures, showing the interiors of the Rack of Antlers Lodge, plus areas of &lsquo;Underside&rsquo; (the tunnels beneath Nywhere), and the streets.<br/><br/>"}, "141693": {"poll": [], "name": "Terrasauria", "playingtime": "30", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": ["Area Control / Area Influence"], "yearpublished": "2012", "usersrated": "1", "boardgamefamily": ["Animals: Dinosaurs"], "maxplayers": "5", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1639967_t.jpg", "average": "6", "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["Bioviva"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1639967.jpg", "boardgameversion": ["Bioviva first edition"], "maxplaytime": "30", "boardgamecategory": ["Educational", "Prehistoric"], "age": "7", "minplaytime": "30", "description": "In this educative game, the objective is to conquer the most continents on the game board by using your collection of dinosaur tiles.

Each match consists of one round; however, each player has two health bars. The game uses a four-button control layout of light, medium, and heavy attacks, alongside a &quot;character trait&quot; button that activates a unique ability or attack designed to showcase each character. For instance, Superman's trait provides a temporary stat boost, while Batman's trait summons a swarm of robotic bats. Ed Boon, the creative director of NetherRealm Studios, stated that characters roughly fall into two categories: &quot;power characters&quot;, who rely on brute strength and innate abilities, and &quot;gadget characters&quot;, who use weapons, items, and other external mechanisms to win.<br/><br/>The stages, based on locations such as the Batcave, Watchtower, and Fortress of Solitude, feature interactive environments and multiple tiers. Successfully connecting a heavy attack near the edges of the stage will launch the opponent into another part of the level. Each arena contains objects that the characters utilize differently depending on their class. For example, a gadget character like Batman can fire projectiles at a car to cause an explosion, while a power character like Superman can pick up the same car and smash his enemies with it. Players will have the option to turn off interactive elements.<br/><br/>During combat, players charge their &quot;super meters&quot; by performing combos or getting hit by the opponent. Portions of the super meter can be used for performing enhanced special moves or countering enemy moves. With a full meter, players can unleash their strongest special attack. Players may also expend meter to compete in wager battles, dubbed the Clash system, which combines individualized cutscene cinematics with the process of betting meter. A clash may be used to interrupt an opponent during a combo, and each player can only use it once after losing their first health bar. During the sequence, both players commit portions of their meter in secret, with the highest bidder winning the clash.<br/><br/>The story mode will be split into several chapters. As the narrative plays out, the player will swap between different characters. Minigames, such as quick time events, will also be incorporated into the story. The outcome of these minigames can impact an upcoming battle, such as giving the player a health advantage over the CPU opponent. Additional features include Battle Mode, comparable to the traditional arcade ladder, Versus Mode, and S.T.A.R. Labs, which includes 240 character-specific challenges of varying difficulty. Online multiplayer will include &quot;King of the Hill&quot;, a setup that allows up to eight players to spectate a match while waiting for their turn to fight, and a two-player online practice mode. Playing through any of the game's modes, including online matches with optional goal objectives, will net the player experience points that may be used to unlock alternate costumes, icons, achievements, and other rewards.&quot;<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;Injustice: Gods Among Us&quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>Microbadges<br/><br/> Injustice Fan - Regime<br/><br/> Injustice Fan<br/><br/>"}, "141702": {"poll": [], "name": "Dillon's Rolling Western: The Last Ranger", "videogamemode": ["Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["Nintendo 3DS eShop edition"], "average": "0", "videogameseries": ["Dillon's Rolling Western"], "videogametheme": ["Furries / Talking Animals", "Western"], "usersrated": "0", "videogamedeveloper": ["Vanpool"], "videogamegenre": ["Action", "Tower Defense"], "videogameplatform": ["Nintendo 3DS"], "statistics": [], "videogamepublisher": ["Nintendo Co., Ltd."], "description": "&quot;Dillon is headed back to the eShop in a sequel called Dillon&rsquo;s Rolling Western: The Last Ranger.

Thus, the villains will make totally random progress towards the station before each player's turn (and possibly even none at all).  The Watchtower can take four villain attacks before it's destroyed.<br/><br/>Hero attacks are straightforward; each villain has a numeric defense value, and each hero rolls two 8-siders against their villains (e.g., Superman vs. Bizarro) and one against others (e.g., Flash vs. Luthor).  Defense values range from 7 to 15, so it's unlikely for a hero to win without help.<br/><br/>Help comes in the form of allies and power cards.  Other heroes stacked with an attacking hero can roll their dice and add to the attack, greatly increasing the chance of success.  And power cards activate hero powers like moving other heroes (Superman, Flash), adding dice (Green Lantern) or allowing other heroes to play cards during your attack (Batman).  However, power cards are limited; each player starts with two and only draws a new one when defeating a villain.<br/><br/>Game description from the publisher:<br/><br/>Defend the Justice League satellite from a super-villain onslaught!<br/><br/>The most dangerous villains in the universe have combined forces to attack the Justice League satellite.

As with majority of the games in the Mario Golf series, it is being developed by Camelot Software Planning and published by Nintendo. The game was first announced on February 14, 2013, in a Nintendo Direct presentation.

The basic premise mirrors the basis of golf, the player aims to hit a golf ball with a golf club across a golf course in order to hit it into the target hole in the lowest number of strokes. The game in particular employs an arcade-like approach to golf, emphasizing simple, straight-forward controls and faster paced gameplay over realism. Despite this, some courses will be modeled to look like real-life courses, while others will be Super Mario themed environments. The game will continue to employ the gameplay mechanic of &quot;Super Shots&quot;; when chosen by the player, they allow for extra distance when hitting the ball, although only a limited number of them are allocated per course, creating a strategic aspect to their use.<br/><br/>The player controls characters from the Mario franchise.

The 1st Panzer Division fought in the French campaign of 1940 with the same organization used in Poland. All of the panzer divisions had variations in their order of battle, and 1st Panzer Division was slightly larger than most of the others. This continued after an Army-wide reorganization in the fall of 1940.<br/><br/>In preparation for the sneak attack on the Soviet Union, the German Army greatly expanded the number of its panzer divisions, making each of them smaller in the process. The greater number of divisions stroked Adolf Hitler's ego, which was important, but it also gave each smaller division a higher ratio of infantry to tanks, which analysis of the Polish and French campaigns had identified as a major weakness of the old-model division.<br/><br/>Ending up in and around Cherbourg at the close of the French campaign, 1st Panzer Division shifted to East Prussia by rail to begin its re-organization.  1st Panzer Division gave up its 2nd Panzer Regiment along with about half of its tanks, sending them to the new 16th Panzer Division then forming from the 16th Infantry Division.  In keeping with the tradition of armies everywhere, all of the division's useless Panzerkampfwagen I tankettes were assigned to the departing unit.  The two tank battalions remaining kept their PzKw IVE support tanks but received new-model PzKw III medium tanks with the new 50mm gun.<br/><br/>In exchange, the division received a newly-organized battalion of motorized infantry and switched from one regiment of three battalions to two regiments each of two battalions.  It added a company of heavy infantry guns for direct support, but the artillery regiment remained steady at two light battalions with 105mm howitzers, one medium battalion with 150mm howitzers, and one anti-tank battalion with 36 towed 37mm anti-tank guns.

Players of Gerontopoly can find themselves detained in the nursing home, adult day care center or hospital. On the upswing, each time they pass GO, they receive $300 from Social Security. During the game, players try to avoid getting &quot;Chronic Disease&quot; cards and attempt to collect as many &quot;Life Satisfaction&quot; cards and as much money as possible. They try to accomplish this by answering various questions about aging including: *With normal aging, which declines the least--hearing, smell, taste or vision? Answering 'taste' earns the player $50.

When everyone has played his cards, the next step is to resolve the stacks of cards played on characters, applying damage in the order it was dealt. If a character's stamina is equalled or exceeded, the character who achieved the knockout earns a KO point. If a character survives all the punches aimed at him, then he receives the KO point.

The game takes place in the same world as the 1991 Super Nintendo Entertainment System title, The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past, taking place six generations following that game's events. The game was released on November 22, 2013 in North America and Europe, November 23, 2013 in Australia, and will be released on December 26, 2013 in Japan. It is the second retail game in the series released on the 3DS, after The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time 3D.<br/><br/>Gameplay<br/><br/>The game follows the top-down two-dimensional gameplay of various Zelda games, especially A Link to the Past, though it is now presented with stereoscopic 3D graphics when played on the Nintendo 3DS. The top screen is used as the main screen, while the bottom touch screen contains the map, gear, and items. The loading screen consists of a black screen with a Triforce in the lower right corner.<br/><br/>Although the overworld is largely the same as that of A Link to the Past, all the dungeons are totally new. Exploration of dungeons utilize the game's 3D effects and feature Link jumping between levels to solve puzzles and advance.<br/><br/>Several items from A Link to the Past return, including arrows for shooting enemies from a long distance, the mallet which allows Link to knock down pegs in the ground, and the Fire Rod which creates a firestorm. The magic meter now refills on its own, a change from the original where it required potions to refill. The magic meter replaces previous games' ammunition system for Link's bow and bombs, as well as being used to power other items and special abilities, such as the magic hammer and spin attack. The Master Sword shoots projectiles when Link is at full health as in A Link to the Past.<br/><br/>Another new feature is the ability for Link to enter walls and become a drawing. When he does so, the camera shifts to a profile view and he is able to move along the walls to reach new areas. Drawings of hearts and rupees can be found on walls and Link can collect them when he turns into a drawing. This ability also allows Link to enter cracks in walls to move between Hyrule and Lorule. This ability causes the player's meter to deplete with time. The feature was inspired by the Phantom Ganon boss battle in The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time.<br/><br/>Rupees are much more important in this game than in previous Zelda titles because of the necessity to buy or rent items. This, along with the ability of the player to choose the order of completing dungeons in, sets apart this Zelda game from more recent installments. The only time these two features have previously appeared in a Zelda game was, notably, the original game.<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;The Legend of Zelda: A Link Between Worlds&quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "141875": {"poll": [], "name": "Panik", "videogamemode": ["Hotseat", "Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["North American TRS-80 5-1/4\" Disk edition", "North American TRS-80 Cassette edition"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1642593.png", "videogametheme": ["Aliens", "Science Fiction"], "usersrated": "0", "videogamedeveloper": ["(Self-Developed Video Game)"], "videogamegenre": ["Arcade", "Platform"], "videogameplatform": ["TRS-80 Model I/III"], "average": "0", "statistics": [], "videogamepublisher": ["Fantastic Software"], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1642593_t.png", "description": "Advertisement<br/><br/>Trapped at an enemy building site, your fate seems certain.

Well I asked myself that often and finally took the plunge and wrote one.  Originally the game was only army men but I couldn&rsquo;t resist the idea of using cowboys, Indians, and for some odd reason, firemen.  After all we are already playing with plastic dudes, we can include them all!<br/><br/>The basic idea here is to go to the Dollar store, spend less than $10 and have a fun miniatures game for two people.  This doesn't include terrain of course.  I recommend playing at the FLGS!  (buy something when you are there)<br/><br/>All the units are put into a bag and mixed up. The first player pulls a guy out of the bag and decides if he wants to keep him or reject him. Rejected units form a pile (not returned to the bag). If you keep certain units you get a bonus draw (if you keep an Indian you can draw a bonus guy from the bag or from the reject pile). The next player than can pick a unit from the bag OR the reject pile, if they pick from the reject pile they also get a second unit from the reject pile on top of any bonuses the first unit gives. So if I took an Indian from the reject pile I&rsquo;d get to take another unit from the pile AND a unit from the bag or pile, the bonus units do not give extra units however)<br/><br/>Terrain is placed, units are placed near the edge of the table and it&rsquo;s time to play. Basically it goes like this. Both guys flip cards from a deck, face cards are set aside, when the total you flipped equals 10 or more they stop. The total is the number of 6 sided dice they get for the turn. These are assigned to the individual units. Army men can have a maximum of 3 dice for example.<br/><br/>Now players take turns. On your turn you activate one unit. That unit then spends at least one die. The dice are used to move, shoot or perform special actions. Moving units are subject to opportunity fire, units performing opportunity fire are subject to covering fire. Of course these actions cost dice, and that limits what else they can do. Dice are indeed a precious commodity!<br/><br/>Remember those removed face cards? They are used to activate special powers and leadership powers. Your special power is determined by what the majority of your units are. Mainly army men? You get the artillery strike! Mainly Cowboys? You get the high noon duel! Leadership powers include healing, damage reduction and group fire. Another tough decision is how to spend those face cards!<br/><br/>The round ends when all the dice are spent. First check to see if any unit has died (taken enough wounds). Yes you don&rsquo;t realize you are dead until the end of the round. Well you can be killed outright during the round but you get to spend all your dice on a retaliatory strike! No dice are wasted! (except for all those ones I rolled) Next you check victory, if you roll a singe d6 and its higher then the total number of guys you have left your army runs away!

The game mimics social life in 1814 &mdash; if one adds magic. The goal is to improve one&rsquo;s social standing. Social standing is the value of one&rsquo;s cards. One improves it by acquiring better cards. As with all romances, the game ends when a character becomes betrothed by losing his or her last card.&quot;<br/><br/>AVAILABILITY:<br/>The game is available from the designers website as a print-and-play.  Some character cards are only available directly from the author at conventions.  The game additionally requires a standard deck of playing cards and a pen and paper.<br/><br/>GAMEPLAY SUMMARY:<br/>Each player will play the character on their character card.  Each character card has a different balance of a number of different attributes.  The attributes each map to a suit of a standard set of face cards.  Each player holds five facecards with which one will attempt to acquire the other player's character cards from them.<br/><br/>Players will take turns making advances via one of their attributes toward another player.  That player can respond in kind, or counter with a different, attribute (analogous to each suit having a different suit which can trump it).  Players then simultaneously reveal their played cards and add that total to the corresponding attribute on their character card.  The player with the higher total triumphs, and takes the opposing player's character card.<br/><br/>If one does not hold a suitable card one can attempt to bluff by playing a face card as if it is suitable, but when it comes time to compare scores, only the attribute on the character card is counted, with no additional strength given via the face card.  Alternatively one can opt to not participate in an exchange at all, before the face cards are revealed, but one will lose a turn as a penalty for doing so.<br/><br/>Play continues in rounds until only a player loses her last card.  Points are counted, and the player with the highest points wins.<br/><br/>"}, "141891": {"poll": [], "name": "Century 21-opoly", "playingtime": "90", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": ["Auction/Bidding", "Dice Rolling", "Player Elimination", "Roll / Spin and Move", "Set Collection"], "yearpublished": "0", "usersrated": "0", "boardgamefamily": ["Monopoly", "Promotional Board Games"], "maxplayers": "6", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1642054_t.jpg", "average": "0", "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["Century 21"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1642054.jpg", "boardgameversion": ["First edition"], "maxplaytime": "90", "boardgamecategory": ["Economic", "Negotiation"], "age": "8", "minplaytime": "90", "description": "Century 21-opoly is a marketing/promotional board game released by Century 21 Real Estate.

Vaccarino or Rio Grande Games.<br/><br/>Victory over your neighbors has always been kind of a big deal for you, but just when you thought building yourself the single most impressive empire in the land was all you had to worry about, the stakes went and got higher. Your victory points are now tied to your very life! It all started with that foul-cursed gold. In the future, you will never trust anything given to you by a man in a village who won't stop spinning when you try to look at him. Of course, now you have access to incredible power, but each time you use it, you bring yourself closer to your own demise. With great power comes great responsibility &mdash; or something like that.<br/><br/>Fortunately, you aren't alone in your fight. A ragtag band of mercenaries has arrived in the kingdom to save the day &mdash; or rather to fight for whoever has the coin. Your mercenaries can wreak havoc on your opponents, but if a stronger warrior takes them by surprise, the resulting curses find their way back to you. This war has turned you into a gambling man (or woman, as the case may be). How much of your own life will you risk to bring down your opponents? Oh, and remember to get your shots.<br/><br/>For Duel, players need the Treasure cards, Victory cards, Curse cards, and Trash card from Dominion or Dominion: Base Cards to play. As with other Dominion games, players must choose ten sets of Kingdom cards for each game.<br/><br/>Duel introduces several new &quot;Curse&quot; cards to the game of Dominion, the generation of a more advanced &quot;Curse Deck&quot;, and a new token: the &quot;curse token&quot;. It also introduces a &quot;life points&quot; system adding another win-condition to the game; in games with this condition, curse tokens modify a player's &quot;Life Points&quot; total. (If the &quot;Life Points&quot; win condition isn't used, whenever a card requires a player to gain +Y (curse tokens), that player must take one curse token for each curse token specified by the number &quot;Y&quot;. Each curse token is worth -1 VP.)<br/><br/>Duel also introduces a new &quot;Attack/Action/Reaction&quot; card type, the &quot;Warrior Cards&quot;. The strength of each Warrior Card is represented by a number within a shield symbol for each Warrior Card. The strengths of each Warrior Card range from 1-10, with 1 being the lowest strength and 10 being the highest strength. When a Warrior Card is played as an Action, the player playing the card first resolves the actions printed on the card in order from top to bottom (e.g. &ldquo;Gain a Silver&rdquo; for the Silver Knight; &ldquo;+1 Card then +1 Action for the Warrior Angel). After unique actions have been resolved, resolve the &ldquo;Each other player gains a Curse&rdquo; effect common to all Warrior Cards. This effect causes each player to draw a card from the Curse Deck or play a Reaction card in response.  These Warrior Cards can also be played as a Reaction card to another player playing a Warrior Card as an Attack card; In this case, the two Warrior Cards &quot;Duel&quot; eachother, and the one with the highest power wins the battle (and unique results are followed as indicated on the cards and within the rules).<br/><br/>"}, "141919": {"boardgamedesigner": ["Jason Mills"], "poll": [], "name": "BattleWin!: Battle To Win The Ultimate Battle Of Win", "playingtime": "15", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": ["Press Your Luck", "Rock-Paper-Scissors", "Secret Unit Deployment", "Simultaneous Action Selection"], "yearpublished": "2013", "usersrated": "0", "maxplayers": "4", "average": "0", "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["Keep It Simple Games"], "boardgameversion": ["First Edition"], "maxplaytime": "15", "boardgamecategory": ["Card Game", "Fighting", "Print & Play"], "age": "3", "minplaytime": "15", "description": "On the distant planet of BattleWin the BattleGods have summoned all the greatest Battlers of the universe together to compete in the Ultimate Battle of Win.<br/>Using a combination of Strategy, Bluffing, and Luck.<br/>Battlers will Battle to Win by reducing their opponents health points using numbered &quot;Battle Army&quot; cards combined with &quot;Battle Strategy&quot; Cards<br/>The Loser is the person with the least amount of Health points at the end of the game.<br/>Do you have what it takes?<br/><br/>Setup:<br/>Players face each other with a deck of 18 Battle Army cards (2xcards numbered 1-9) and 4 Battle Strategy cards (recruit,heal,battle and block)<br/>Take your 4 action cards and keep them in your hand.<br/>Place your health point card where other battlers can see it.

Gameplay goes around resources. There are two types of resources: Countable resources like food, wood, stone, ore, test-tube and gold. Special resources like horse, iron, fish, wheat, marble, diamond and mana are used to develop (science) or build (building) something. There is no storage for resources, a player needs to have access (by having a city near the resource) to certain number and type of resources to build something. Food is the most important resource, each city, extra population and army eats one food. You need food-surplus to build a city/army/extra population, but no problem if your food production goes under your food production (no starving to death).<br/><br/>Each player has an economical page (like character page in RPGs), that shows the state of his empire. Players use small  markers (for example: coins) for recording various things.<br/><br/>Player's turn have 4 phases:<br/><br/>     random event phase: A random event happens, that has effect to all players, usually a positive thing to each player.<br/>     money phase: Player adds the number of his/her gold production to treasury. (Gold is the only resource in Isle of Domination, that is storaged.)<br/>     army moving phase: Players can move their armies by grid lines of hexes. Combat system is very simple: if attacker's army is stronger than defender army, defender army has to be withdrawn. No dice rolling this time.

It is possible that all other Players have stronger economies, stronger armies and bigger empires, but still you win because you reach one of the Victory Conditions.<br/>There are 6 different types of Victory:<br/><br/>     Territory Victory: You dominate by having a large number of cities.<br/>     Military Victory: You dominate by having a very strong and large army.<br/>     Population Victory: You dominate by outnumbering others in population.<br/>     Science Victory: You dominate by knowledge.

This increased flexibility allows the fighter to be the default combat-oriented character without limiting it to just one or two styles of fighting. And like a rogue, a fighter character can pick and choose from a range of similarly-powered abilities appropriate for the fighter&rsquo;s role without making the class overpowered.

In many cases it's not necessary to create new spell options from scratch, as a few minor changes to an existing spell can create something with a very different feel or impact on game play. These spell variants are based on the idea that there are a lot of interesting effects you can make with fairly minor changes to how a spell works, or by combining effects of multiple spells, or a spell and magic item or even a class ability (preferably from a class not used in the campaign). While we have explored 330 variants in previous products (The Genius Guide to 110 Spell Variants, The Genius Guide to Another 110 Spell Variants, and The Genius Guide to 110 Spell Variants&mdash;Volume 3), there's always room for more magic!<br/><br/>Spell variants are common and fairly obvious, such as having a major magic missile spell that deals 1d8+1 per missile rather than 1d4+1. The following list of 110 spells variants are slightly more complex, and are designed to show how it&rsquo;s possible to create new spells without too much work. One important tip is that when you base a new spell on an old one many details&mdash;such as its school, components, duration, and often even interaction with other spells&mdash;are already determined. Similarly, you can often create spells that have entirely new themes just by changing casting time and legal targets. This last trick is often a great way to make spells appropriate for new classes.<br/><br/>For example it's fairly obvious the paladin class shouldn't have the animal growth spell on its spell list, but a spell variant called mighty steed which acted like animal growth but could only be cast on a mount gained through the divine bond class feature is perfect for paladin. And even better, you already know it&rsquo;s about a 4th level paladin spell, since that's the level at which it appears on the ranger class spell list.<br/><br/>"}, "141951": {"rpgartist": ["M\u00e1rton Gyula Kiss", "Manda Panda Stocks"], "rpg": ["Pathfinder System Compatible Product"], "poll": [], "name": "Patron Hexes", "rpgdesigner": ["Owen K.C.

The wishes of those without the powers of the gods seem to be able to be realized through this great and mysterious force. But there is a cost... There is always a cost. Within this tome&rsquo;s pages are magical items rivaling the power of the greatest artifacts, spells that can make a god kneel, and the means to rule the worlds across countless spheres of existence. Those who risk everything (and perhaps more) to harness the power of the ultimate magical energies need seek no further than these tenebrous pages. Beware what you find within, for the desire for power can sometimes be so great that even a paragon of all that is good can be tempted to do wicked things to possess it. If you pursue that which can grant dreams, be sure that those dreams do not become nightmares.

Presented in this supplement are three such classes, the saint, the lich, and the vampie. The saint is a good aligned character who was brought back to life by a deityafter committing a great deed. They lose all their class levels and gain an equal number of levels of saint. The lich is a powerful spellcaster who was granted perpetual life by a powerful ritual. A lich can take as many levels of the lich substitution class as class levels they sacrifice at the time of the ritual. This gives them more undead powers at the cost of their existing abilities. Vampires sacrifice as many levels as they can (to a maximum of 10) in exchange for an equal number of vampire levels. Regardless of what level a character is when they enter a substitution class, they may continue to gain levels in a substitution class when they level up as normal.
