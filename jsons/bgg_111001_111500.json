Mankind has self-actualized enough to realize that we are creatures of violence. Centuries of denying one of our base instincts has not led to a more civilized society. Technological advances have given unprecedented scales of damage potential to our conflicts. In 2153, the Council of Restraint was formed in response to the particularly devastating aftermath of a conflict between the United African Republic and Pacific Rim Conglomerate. Three years later the Conflict Resolution Accords were ratified. Now when conflicts arise, the involved states or ideological groups can settle the dispute in a manner that mitigates widespread destruction. Large, mechanized military machines meet to do battle of epic proportion. These battles are waged in controlled arenas to contain the violence and damage. Armored Terran Systems Corporation manufactures base machines called Mechs and combatants configure their Mech with armaments and options in preparation for combat.<br/><br/>The Earth Shook is a game where each player assumes the role of a large mechanized military class robot. Where man once waged war across the globe on epic proportions, machines now resolve the conflict in controlled arenas. Build your machine, defend your ideology, and destroy the others. Be the last machine standing on the field of battle; to the victor go the spoils of war.<br/><br/>Players each receive a basic identical Mech from the factory. They have a set amount of points that they can use to buy modules for the Mech. These modules adjust the ratings for Evasion, Shields, Armor, Speed, Maneuverability, Weapon Damage, Rate of Fire, and more. Once the modules have been purchased, the Mech stats are adjusted to reflect the module choices and teh game can commence.<br/><br/>Game play is similar to RoboRally or Wings of War in that each player will select 6 Move/Maneuver actions for their Mech each turn. In this manner, a turn is played out in six rounds as the Mechs execute their programmed moves. Can you out-maneuver your opponent? Do you risk an all out frontal attack. Each player will approach the battle differently, hoping to draw upon the strengths of their configured Mech.<br/><br/>Build &amp; Battle.

These creatures come from the underwater Ker-Ys city.<br/><br/>PREPARATION<br/><br/><br/>     In turn, the players place all elements of the game area (wall ruins, swamps).<br/>     Four creatures are introduced in the game and will progress from the door (in the centre of a glade) towards either side of the game board (representing the druids&rsquo; path surrounding the glade). Creatures&rsquo; moves are pre-defined and happen automatically.<br/>     The players place their team of three druids whose role is to prevent the creatures from invading the human world.<br/>     Energy markers are set at the start level and the knowledge track markers are set under the tracks.<br/>     The pile of Power cards is shuffled and placed near the board.<br/><br/><br/>THE GAME<br/><br/>The game consists of a defined number of rounds (depending on number of players). Every round is composed of the following phases:<br/><br/><br/>     The creatures progress. The creatures already on the board progress towards the side of the board using a totally automatic way of moving. New creatures (1 to 3, depending on a dice roll) arrive on the board and start to progress too.<br/>     Preparation of the Action tiles. The six Action tiles are shuffled and placed one by one forming a line, face up. These tiles represent all possible actions, each tile being separated into a major and a minor action. The number of places available on the tiles depends on the number of players.<br/>     Choice of actions. Each druid team carries out 5 actions a round, represented by Action markers. Players, in the reverse order of their position on the score track, choose their actions one by one by setting their Action markers on the available places on the Action cards. Actions can be: moving the druids (they only move on the path surrounding the glade), setting a magical stone (a magical stone is set at the intersection of the magical beams emitted by two druids looking at the glade, this costs energy; the magical beams do not cross obstacles), capturing creature(s) (a druid may capture a creature in front of him with his magical beam; this costs energy but gives MP and sometimes special properties), progressing in knowledge tracks (to increase the capacity of moving, or to increase the influence at the druid council, for &shy;instance), preparing magical beverages (to increase knowledge but also to recover energy), moving a magical stone (it is possible to move a magical stone), acquiring Power cards (they give special powers, such as allowing the magical beam to pass through a wall), and influencing a creature (allows to move a creature).<br/>     Actions are performed. Actions are performed marker by marker, from left to right, starting with the major actions before doing the minor ones. If the same colour of marker is encountered a second time on the same action, this action is not carried out. The actions on the next Action tile are then carried out and so on, until all major or all minor actions have been performed. Then, the players come back to the stopped action to perform it. Druids must inform the council about all their actions. After they have set a stone, captured a creature, or prepared a magical beverage, druids are placed at the druid council. Any druid can start from the council to enter back the path, but he can also stay at the council to influence it and gain MP at the end of the round.<br/>     Activation of magical stones. At the end of each round, all stones that are aligned and of the same colour automatically become menhirs. MP are attributed to the corresponding players and depend on the distance between the stones that have been transformed, as well as their position in the glade. Menhirs have a special property that will be activated at the end of the game.<br/>     Druid council. At the end of each round, the influence of each druid team on the council is evaluated. Players receive as many MP as their number of druids at the council. In addition, the team in majority can increase his knowledge in one of the knowledge tracks.<br/><br/><br/>Then, a new round can start.<br/><br/>END OF THE GAME<br/><br/>The game is finished after 5 or 6 rounds, depending on the number of players. In addition to the MP gained during the game, players receive MP according to the magical stones still on the board and the Power cards still in their&nbsp;hands. <br/>Also, the final menhir layout is important and can afford MP according to two different scenarios. If the central door (from which the creatures come) can be completely shut in by drawing a connecting line between menhirs, then MP are attributed to the players for the menhirs they have placed in the glade. If it is not possible to shut in the central door by connecting menhirs, then MP are attributed to the players for the creatures that they have captured.<br/><br/>THE WINNER<br/><br/>The winner is the player with the highest MP score.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": ["Multilingual first edition"], "name": "Karnag", "playingtime": "120", "boardgamemechanic": ["Action / Movement Programming", "Area Enclosure", "Worker Placement"], "average": "6.72596", "boardgameexpansion": ["131844", "133205"], "usersrated": "162", "age": "14"}, "111070": {"rpgdesigner": ["Gareth Hanrahan", "Francesco Nepitello"], "rpgitemversion": ["Geschichten aus Wilderland", "Original PDF version", "Racconti Delle Terre Selvagge", "Relatos de las Tierras Asperas", "Revised hardcover version", "Revised PDF version", "Softcover version"], "statistics": [], "name": "Tales from Wilderland", "rpghonor": ["2013 Golden Geek Best RPG Supplement Nominee"], "rpgproducer": ["Amado Angulo", "Paul Bourne", "Dominic McDowall", "Francesco Nepitello", "Luke Walker"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2670294.png", "usersrated": "48", "rpgsetting": ["Middle-earth"], "average": "8.20312", "rpgissuearticle": ["Der Eine Ring: Geschichten aus Wilderland"], "rpgartist": ["Jon Hodgson", "John Howe", "Tomasz Jedruszek"], "rpggenre": ["Fantasy (High Fantasy)"], "rpgpublisher": ["Cubicle 7 Entertainment", "Devir", "Giochi Uniti", "Sophisticated Games", "Uhrwerk Verlag"], "rpg": ["The One Ring"], "rpgcategory": ["Scenario / Adventure / Module"], "poll": [], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2670294_t.png", "description": "Publisher blurb:<br/><br/>Wilderland awakens!

Fortunately, a defecting W.A.R.D. agent briefed the Agency, allowing one of its agent teams to shut the laboratory down before catastrophe struck.

The first player to collect thirteen Bohnentalers wins.<br/><br/>At the start of the game, each player receives two order cards, each of which shows six orders; the player tries to complete orders on one card while using the other to cover completed orders. The easiest orders to complete &ndash; say, two specific bean types or three beans in any combination of two types &ndash; are at the bottom of the card, and the hardest ones &ndash; requiring, say, a four-of-a-kind or seven beans with no blue ones &ndash; are at the top. Orders must be completed from bottom to top.<br/><br/>On a turn, the active player starts by rolling the seven bean dice, three of which have one combination of beans and four of which have another combination. This player must set aside at least one bean, then she rerolls any remaining dice, setting at least one aside, etc. After at most seven rolls, she completes as many orders as she can, reusing the dice as needed to complete orders. Once a player completes three orders, she can &quot;harvest&quot; the card for one coin. Each additional completed order is worth a coin, up to a maximum of four. When a player harvests the order card, she draws a new card and uses that to record completed orders (possibly on the same turn) on the order card she already had.<br/><br/>In the Bohnanza card game, players trade cards to improve the standing of both parties involved in the trade. In W&uuml;rfel Bohnanza, the active player doesn't trade dice, but opponents do get to benefit from that player's rolls. After each roll by the active player, all other players can use the dice just rolled &ndash; and not dice already set aside &ndash; to complete orders on their own cards. Thus, the active player has some incentive not to dawdle too much with her rolls as her opponents might benefit from her turn more than she does.<br/><br/>The game ends as soon as one or more players have collected thirteen Bohnentalers. The player with the most Bohnentalers wins!<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": ["Dutch first edition", "German first edition", "German Spiele Hit edition"], "average": "6.67298", "name": "W\u00fcrfel Bohnanza", "playingtime": "45", "boardgamemechanic": ["Dice Rolling"], "age": "10", "usersrated": "1357", "boardgamesubdomain": ["Family Games"], "boardgamefamily": ["Bohnanza"], "boardgamepodcastepisode": ["BGTG 122 - SR &amp; Feedback (W\u00fcrfel Bohnanza &amp; Lords of Waterdeep)", "Episode 20 - Geekway Games And Animal Facts", "Episode 5: Around the World in 80 Days, Doomtown: Reloaded, Stone Age, Nippon, Wurfel Bohnanza", "Episode 97-- March Madness Filler Tournament", "What Did You Play This Week Podcast Thing Week 82", "What Did You Play This Week Podcast Thing Week 85!"]}, "111149": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1126920.jpg", "poll": [], "boardgamedesigner": ["Graeme Jahns"], "statistics": [], "yearpublished": "2011", "maxplayers": "5", "boardgameartist": ["Hans Janssen"], "boardgamepublisher": ["Quined Games"], "maxplaytime": "90", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1126920_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "90", "boardgamecategory": ["Ancient", "City Building", "Civilization", "Dice", "Economic", "Expansion for Base-game"], "description": "This small expansion was first issued as a promo item at the &quot;Spiel 2011&quot; in Essen.<br/><br/>These meeples can guard one of the 5 areas in the game from sabotage (except the barracks) once, moving along clockwise after it was used.

It is pretty obvious to everyone that there won&rsquo;t be long before something big happens, although what that will be, or what the meaning of all this is, noone knows...<br/><br/>Godswake is an Adventure game for 2-4 players that plays in about one hour per player. The setting is the near future (or if you read this after 2012, an alternate Earth) when apparently the world is falling apart, but in a very unexpected, mythic, supernatural way. The characters &ndash; represented by the players &ndash; race against each other to get their hands on an allegedly extremely powerful relic amidst the chaos, with what they may not only be able stop the destruction, but also to assume a god-like power for themselves. However, it is a very hard task: the dangers lie not only in the natural catastrophes caused by the troubled matter of the Earth, but also in the insanity of people trying to deal with the coming of the apocalypse, in the rivalry of others who have the same goal in mind and in the appearance of supernatural events and creatures that have only lived in people&rsquo;s imagination before. During their adventures the characters will probably travel around the world, visit exotic places, lead expeditions into relentless wildernesses in search for helpful minor Artifacts, face surprising Adventures and venture into disaster-ridden places all other people are running away from.<br/><br/>Card traits and game mechanics (such as Character Personalities that affect the outcome of adventures they have) all strive to keep the game as thematic as possible, while being simple and straight-forward at the same time. The game tries to keep a short playing time for an adventure game, while still being epic and memorable.<br/><br/>The game has been influenced by many sources ranging from Indiana Jones (regarding exploration in exotic places) and James Bond movies (high tech gear, daring action scenes), through the Supernatural tv-series (with the &ldquo;ongoing apocalypse&rdquo; setting), Hellblazer comics (giving it the darker tone, people with mystical powers, occult and magic), to the Stalker concept by the Strugatsky-brothers (regarding the whole weird zone called the Unknown, where the rumored relic lies). The mood of the game may feel like a mix of all of the above: quite dark and mature, but without resorting to graphic violence or vulgarity; a bit thought-provoking, but not taking itself too seriously.<br/><br/>The game uses lots of cards &ndash; around 350 in all &ndash; and many tokens as components, aside from a game board.<br/><br/>"}, "111175": {"rpgdesigner": ["Miceal Caudill", "Joe Charles", "Brian Jelke", "Steve Johansson", "Brad Todd", "Luke Wetterlind"], "rpg": ["HackMaster (4th Edition)"], "poll": [], "name": "Robinloft 2: Tahd's Legacy", "rpgartist": ["Chris Moreno", "Clayton Van Sickle, III"], "rpgproducer": ["Bob Burke", "Jennifer Kenzer", "Mark Plemmons", "Jo Jo Zeke"], "usersrated": "6", "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1126807.jpg", "rpgitemversion": ["Robinloft 2 softcover"], "rpgsetting": ["Garweeze Wurld"], "average": "7.33333", "statistics": [], "rpggenre": ["Fantasy (High Fantasy)"], "rpgpublisher": ["Kenzer and Company"], "rpgcategory": ["Scenario / Adventure / Module"], "rpgseries": ["HackMaster Modules"], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1126807_t.jpg", "description": "from the back of the book<br/><br/>Welcome to an adventure of dark mystery and romance for the HackMaster system!

The game follows a group of Digimon competing in a racing tournament within the Digital World, home to all Digimon. The purpose of the grand prix is to determine who is the best racer; thus, they use specially designed karts that equate all contestants in terms of ability.<br/><br/>Digimon Racing's gameplay largely resembles that of traditional racing games. It focuses on competing against seven CPU-controlled characters in cup races consisting of three laps. The usage of items to attack opponents and improve one's own condition is an integral part of the gameplay, and adds an element of kart racing games. A new feature in the game is &quot;kart hopping&quot;: using the karts to jump onto opponents, slowing them down. This adds an element of action gameplay. Digivolution, a recurring theme in Digimon, also plays a role in the game. Driving over energy hotspots scattered throughout the tracks increases an energy meter located at the bottom left of the game's HUD. As the meter increases, the player traverses the Digimon's evolutionary line, becoming more powerful and ultimately gaining the ability to use a special attack.<br/><br/>The game's fifteen tracks&mdash;four of which are available immediately&mdash;are based on conventional video game environments such as jungles, volcanoes, and cities. After completing a track for the first time, the player unlocks a time trial mode for this track, and a boss battle.

The game starts with Race #4.  The previous Races (1,2,3) have already taken place and data from these races have been recorded on the Past Performance Chart.  In actual harness racing there are various sources where you can gather the information that is needed to create a Past Performance Chart for actual horses &amp; drivers.  So based on the Past Performance chart you decided how much risk that you can take and place wagers on the race.  The movement of the horses is based on the Past Performance chart data with probabilities of different outcomes based on a history of actual races.  These probabilities are realized in the game thru movement cards and a spinner.  The movement mechanism does not take into account all of the information that is recommended to be collected for making bets at the track.  However, to take everything into account would make for an overly analytical game and would present the false concept that predicting races is just a matter of math.  The game instructions explain all of the common terms and concepts that are considered important when deciding what bets to place.  And it presents a logical method for recording important information needed to place bets.  If you ignore the educational aspects of the game it is a fun game.  The pawns movement mechanism is similar to the more well known Win Place &amp; Show.  In each round the rigs have a movement for the round and then two of the pawns receive bonus movement.

It's rules are simple enough to be understood by anyone, but give a good depth of strategy and involve different races with different skills and ships.<br/><br/>The game wants to depict BIG fleet battles, with all the clich&egrave; of sci-fi: big capital ships, carriers, flight of fighters and starbombers, elite pilots, heroes, missiles, torpedoes, black holes, big spinal cannons, and so on.<br/>All this while keeping a profound strategy and some sensation of realism and real choices.<br/><br/>RULES:<br/>A game usually consists of 2 factions/fleets, each controlled by one or two &quot;Commanders&quot;. Every Commander has his own set of &quot;order cards&quot;, and his own Flagship: all the other ships of the fleet are &quot;shared&quot; and can be called in combat by all commanders of his own faction.<br/>Before the battle starts, every commander chooses and assigns special equipment/technologies to his faction ships: these represent a fundamental difference in gameplay of every faction, giving special skills to their ships.<br/><br/>Every ship in the game is depicted by a &quot;Ship card&quot;, wich keeps the skills and data of that type of ships: there can be several ships of the same type in battle, and they need only ONE card for all of them.<br/><br/>Every turn, a Commander play an &quot;Order card&quot; to order one &quot;ship-card&quot;: all the ships belonging to that class (example, all the Fireshield destroyers) could then move and fire. If the order comes from a flagship, she can order 2 different ship-cards (including his own), if there is at least one ship of that card near.<br/><br/>The ordered cards get rotated a bit to show it has been activated and cannot be ordered again the next turn (so if there are 2 commanders and one requests for the carrier to act, you cannot order it the next turn but could only &quot;reset&quot; it to active status).<br/><br/>Order cards could also used to activate special abilities on ships (and special equipments) and also have a secondary &quot;effect&quot; and could be discarded to get that effect.<br/>In this way, there are always crucial decisions during the game, like: will I discard a card now to get that missile barrage on my enemy and support the other commander attack, or I will keep it to have more options the next turn.<br/><br/>The game almost never falls in a &quot;cannot order anything&quot; scenario, and a commander can expect to order the units he needs most of the time. But if he spens a great deal of cards to support his attacks, his decision could be limited in the next turns, while he builds back his &quot;hand&quot; of cards.<br/><br/>The firing is very simple, based on normal six sided dices rolls. Very rarely one roll is fundamental, since u can always maneuver and use skills to get the best rolling options for your attack.<br/><br/>The game has several scenarios already, and more races and scenarios are being developed/tested while we WAIT FOR AN EDITOR (the game is not yet published, just my homemade copy for now and some playtesting copies around).<br/><br/>"}, "111241": {"poll": [], "name": "Dynasty Street", "videogamemode": ["Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["Flash edition"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1137998.jpg", "videogametheme": ["Abstract", "Crime"], "usersrated": "0", "videogamedeveloper": ["Dissolute Productions"], "videogamegenre": ["Beat 'em Up"], "videogameplatform": ["Web Browser"], "average": "0", "statistics": [], "videogamepublisher": ["(Web published)"], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1137998_t.jpg", "description": "User Summary<br/><br/>A stick figure beat em up game, featuring power up weapons that only last a limited amount of uses.

It also exist in a tabletop version aimed at dinner parties. On its surface, Sixteen Tons looks like a large-scale boardgame, in which players move very heavy pieces around a four-by-four grid, trying to maneuver their pieces into a winning position. The winniong position is pre the player to get her/his two game pieces orthogonally adjacent. This core gameplay is complicated by the fact that players can pay each other with real money.

Playing the game becomes an experience that critically blurs work and play, as the real value of money is grafted onto the artificial meanings of the game, and player identitiy shifts fluidly back and forth from cooperation to competition. Winning the game requires both strategic thinking and social smarts and the rules are intentionally ambiguous about whether players keep each others&rsquo; money after a game. Sixteen Tons is named after the folk song made famous in 1955 by Tennessee Ernie Ford about coal mining and debt bondage.<br/><br/>In Sixteen Tons, four players play a strategy game using heavy sections of steel pipe as the pieces of the game. At the beginning of the game, players take out three dollar bills from their wallets. This money is used to pay other players to move your pieces for you during the game.

Depending on the choice of traits, a Hero gets access to a certain amount of skills. Currently there are 15 schools of skills available and - if a Hero uses 1 or 2 traits only - he may pick skills from up to two schools. Each school features 10 common skills as well as 5 elite skills - skills with superior effects.

So each time a Hero takes damage, he will become slower and less efficient. Gameplay takes place on comparatively small &quot;maps&quot; (a term derived from video game language), forcing the Heros from the beginning into close quarter combat. A couple of scenarios are given in the rulebook, such as the classic &quot;all vs. all&quot; (also available as &quot;team vs. team&quot;), capture the flag, king of the hill, bombing run, a treasure hunt and even a snowfall scenario allowing players to duke it out in a snowball fight.

These rules are available as a downloadable PDF. To play each player creates a gang (generally 5-10 models) depending on a predetermined number of points.  A general game is normally around 200 pts. You'll also need at least 3 10-sided dice, a tape measure and a 3'x3' play area.  Feel free to include as much 3D terrain (buildings, trees, etc) as you like.<br/><br/>1. MINIATURES<br/><br/>It is a good idea to have the miniatures of all the gang members you will be using before you create your gang. It is also a good idea for all players to have miniatures that are similar in scale.<br/><br/>2. CREATION POINTS<br/><br/>Before you can create your gang all players must decide on how many creation points will be used for gang construction. An average gang costs 200 creation points.<br/><br/>3. GANG MEMBERS<br/><br/>There are five different types of gang members for you to choose from each with its own special rule.<br/><br/>4. CREATURE TYPE<br/><br/>Creature type refers to what type of creature the gang member is. There are ten different types of creatures to choose from. Each creature has its own unique special rule.<br/><br/>5. WEAPONS<br/><br/>Once you have all of your gang members chosen you need to arm them with weapons to fight with.<br/><br/>6. FREAK POWERS<br/><br/>Freak powers only apply if one of your gang members is a freak. Freaks can be given bizarre<br/><br/>"}, "111324": {"boardgamedesigner": ["Matthew Meadows"], "poll": [], "name": "Premonition The Dice Game", "playingtime": "0", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": ["Dice Rolling"], "yearpublished": "2011", "usersrated": "1", "maxplayers": "5", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1129101_t.jpg", "average": "6", "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["MM Board Games"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1129101.jpg", "boardgameversion": ["MM Games First Edition"], "maxplaytime": "0", "boardgamecategory": ["Dice", "Horror", "Print & Play"], "age": "13", "minplaytime": "0", "description": "<br/>     Description from Wargamedownloads.com<br/><br/><br/>Premonition The Dice Game<br/><br/>You snap out of a trance in a cold sweat, having had a disturbing premonition of a stranger meeting a grisly death at a familiar location.

During the first year of its life the system reportedly sold well, but Commodore ran into cash flow problems and filed for bankruptcy. World wide sales figures for the A1200 are unknown but 95,000 systems were sold in Germany before Commodore's bankruptcy.<br/><br/>After Commodore&rsquo;s demise in 1994 the A1200 almost disappeared from the market but was later re-launched by Escom in 1995. The new Escom A1200 was priced at &pound;399 and it came bundled with two games, seven applications and Amiga OS 3.1. It was initially criticized for being priced 150 pounds higher than the Commodore variant had sold for two years prior. It also came with a modified PC floppy disk drive that was incomptible with some Amiga software titles.

It has been inspired by the old kingdoms surrounding the Great Zimbabwe, a world heritage site in southern Africa. Far into the previous century, colonial governments denied that a civilization that produced such impressive monuments and beautiful artwork could have been African in origin. But of course, this civilization was African, and the country of Zimbabwe itself was proudly named after this impressive cultural heritage. As always in our games, we have used this history for inspiration; however, first and foremost we wanted to create a highly playable and replayable Splotter game, so in many cases we took liberties with historical names, periods and artwork.<br/><br/>In the game, players strive to build the most impressive monuments to one god of their choice. They can choose this god themselves-- each of the twelve gods offers a unique blessing, but each also requires a different amount of work to win the game. Building the monuments is done by developing a logistics network stretching across the region. Through this network, players produce and obtain ritual goods to raise their monuments and bring honour to the god of their choice.<br/><br/>Here's the flavour text from the rules:<br/><br/>The Mutapa king struts into the village, followed by a bunch of young warriors herding cattle. &ldquo;Oondabezitha &rdquo;, he addresses the assembly of kings, &ldquo;I have brought twelve heads of cattle for the ceremony tonight&rdquo;. The others seem to shrink in stature as he speaks. The star of the king of Mutapa is clearly ascending. They have not brought nearly as much cattle themselves. &ldquo;Soon, we will all be praying to Obatala&rdquo;, murmurs one of the older Kilwa traders. &ldquo;The Mutapa will be raising their godless monuments sky-high. Perhaps it is time for us to resort to some magic of our own&rdquo;. Then the sky breaks into a thunder and a torrential rain pours down on the assembly. The men scramble while the plains fill with water. The ceremony will be wet tonight...<br/><br/><br/>The Great Zimbabwe is a logistico-economic game in which players are tribal leaders in Africa trying to please the gods by building monuments.<br/><br/>Buying technology, building craftsmen, gathering resources and worshipping a god are among the many decisions necessary to win in 'The Great Zimbabwe'. But the main way of getting there is building and developing a network of monuments. The higher the monuments, the closer the players will be to victory, but players must balance many subtle aspects of the game. If they develop their economy, if they worship a powerful god or if they use a lot of technology, they will need to score more victory points.<br/><br/>Clever use of turn-order manipulation, economic development in an almost close environment, scarce natural resource use and logistical optimization to deliver goods from craftsmen to monuments: You only get one action per turn, so be smart! 'The Great Zimbabwe' is a race for victory, in which you decide how far you want to go and at what speed.

It is structured to encompass the essential elements of behavior modification and designed to have the greatest positive impact on attention.  In behavior modification children receive specific positive reinforcement for accomplishing a task within an appropriate time frame and without being distracted.  The rewards are usually in the form of tokens.  This game provides two ways for players to win tokens &ndash; with or without a distraction.<br/><br/>The game has 3 sets of task cards that describe tasks that the players have to complete in order to earn their tokens.  Each task requires concentration and continuing attention and includes:<br/><br/>1.  Categories:  Players have to list things that belong in a specific category, such as listing five fruits that have one large pit in the middle.<br/><br/>2.  Forward and Back:  Players have to recite things forward and/or backwards, such as reciting the alphabet forwards and backwards from A to F.<br/><br/>3.  Problem Solving:  The game comes with various cut out shapes and cut out words.  Using shapes, the players have to create a specific design, like a triangle similar to the pattern on the card, using the shapes provided.  Using words the players have to create a sentence, like a sentence in which someone throws something to someone else.<br/><br/>A player can elect to perform the task without distraction and win one token or with distraction and win two tokens.  The distraction is optional.  The distractions are provided by one of the other players, who pick a Distraction card.  This card may ask the distracting player to hum &ldquo;Happy Birthday&rdquo; or tap fingers on the table while the other player is trying to accomplish the task.  Players can earn more tokens when they attempt a task while distracting events are taking place.  Distractions are the most common reason people lose focus on the task at hand.  This game gives players much needed practice that improves their ability to stay focused on tasks, even with distractions.<br/><br/>There are both competitive and cooperative versions for grades 1-12.  There are three decks of Task cards with varied levels of difficulty: easier, regular, and challenge.  The key is for the players to be able to complete the task most of the time if they concentrate and are not distracted.

Imagination cards ask players to imagine situations in which the player has a disability or wants to help a person with a disability. Challenge cards are multiple choice questions that add to the players&rsquo; knowledge about specific disabilities, ways for disabled people to improve their lives, and famous people with disabilities.<br/><br/>Call Me Capable was originally developed by Carol Leish, who sustained disabilities from an auto accident when she was a young child. The game gives a unique insight into both the limitations and possibilities of living with disabilities. Most of all, the game reflects Carol&rsquo;s philosophy of focusing on the capabilities of herself and other disabled people.<br/><br/>"}, "111409": {"poll": [], "name": "Circle of Respect", "playingtime": "25", "minplayers": "2", "yearpublished": "2006", "usersrated": "0", "maxplayers": "6", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1152165_t.jpg", "average": "0", "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["Franklin Learning Systems"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1152165.jpg", "boardgameversion": ["First edition"], "maxplaytime": "25", "boardgamecategory": ["Educational"], "age": "5", "minplaytime": "25", "description": "Understanding the concept of respect and developing the ability to show respect in a variety of situations are vital for success in school and throughout life.

All children have been involved in bullying incidents, whether as a target, a bully, or a bystander.  Players learn that everyone can play an important role in reducing bullying.  The target of the bullying will become the victim if he/she cannot stop the bullying attempt.  In addition, the bystander who laughs when the bully makes fun of another student is unwittingly rewarding the bully with the status he/she seeks and encouraging more bullying.<br/><br/>Like other behavior, bullying behavior is not random, rather it is motivated by specific goals.  Most bullying is motivated by social goals, such as status, popularity, power, having fun, etc.  The game emphasizes that all students in the school community have the ability to support bullying or to discourage it.  Students learn concrete, non-violent skills to use in bullying situations.  In addition to the game's systems approach, it differs from most other approaches to bullying in two important respects.  First, it pays attention to the potentially positive role of the bystanders.  Second, it gives bullies positive skills to use to achieve their goals without resorting to bullying behavior.<br/><br/>The game box includes rules for both cooperative play and competitive play.  In each version players read Situation cards that describe typical middle school bullying behavior.  Players then offer advice to the target, the bystanders, or the bully (on how the bully can achieve goals using pro-social skills instead of bullying).  Players earn tokens for their sound advice.  In order to facilitate learning and help the players give sound advice, the game includes a list of non-violent skills that targets and bystanders can use to reduce and stop bullying.  Players also learn when it is appropriate to seek help from a trusted adult.<br/><br/>"}, "111411": {"poll": [], "name": "Bible Fight", "videogamemode": ["Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["Web Browser edition"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1137360.jpg", "videogametheme": ["Mythology"], "usersrated": "0", "videogamedeveloper": ["Adult Swim Games"], "videogamegenre": ["Fighting"], "videogameplatform": ["Web Browser"], "average": "0", "statistics": [], "videogamepublisher": ["Adult Swim Games"], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1137360_t.jpg", "description": "User Summary<br/><br/>A fighting game featuring many of your favorite Biblical heroes.

Austerlitz is the first computer wargame to begin to utilize the computer's capabilities on a Grand Tactical scale, unlike those weak, slow, unrealistic board game clones. The Artificial Intelligence which drives the computer player is broken into three levels. On the Grand Tactical or highest level, the computer analyzes the battle to determine broad concepts: where to attack, who to send and when to retreat, or launch an all out attack.<br/><br/>Once this is decided, another module handles the coordination of the maneuver elements (divisions, Corps, columns). This was, by far, the most difficult element in the design. From this module, targets for each Corps are selected which are most likely to bring about the success of the Grand Tactical plan.<br/><br/>With these targets, the tactical module takes over and gives the orders to the individual units. Here things like artillery fire, units going into line to fire or column to assault towns, and the commitment of cavalry are decided.

The first player to ship one of their packages from Europe to Games Unlimited wins the game and gains all the gamer glory.<br/><br/>Play: Players take turns shipping either of their 2 packages from Europe to Pittsburgh. Each player rolls the 3 dice up to 3 times. Any die/dice may be set aside each roll, but once set aside, may not be re-rolled. Players are trying to roll combinations of particular dice to match the next transportation type shown on the path: means you must roll three airplanes (6) on the dice to move one package on to that space on the shipment path. Players may choose which shipment path they start on when first shipping a package. After all 3 rolls, the values on the dice may be used to move one or more spaces as long as the number on the space equals the dice rolled. Packages may not be placed on an occupied space.<br/><br/>Wild/Blocker Markers: Players may use the wildcard/blocker markers to do one of two things in the game: <br/>1. As a wildcard, substituting for one of the required dice values desired at any time during the 3 rolls. If you use a wildcard you must give the marker to the other player who then places it on their Transport Track on the space matching the wildcard value (ex. Player 1 uses a wildcard marker sitting on their airplane (6) transport type. They give this marker to Player 2 who then places it on their (6) space. If the transportation space is occupied that player may place it on another transportation type of their choice.<br/>2. As a blocker, placing the marker on any space along any shipment path as long as it matches the color of the transportation type on the shipment path. Any player may remove a blocker by rolling any 3 of a kind and not moving any of their packages.

The first one being, &ldquo;Who killed Cock Robin?&rdquo; And the last one being, &ldquo;Who will sing the psalm?&rdquo;<br/>The old card game offers a twist at the ending and differs from the nursery rhyme. The players of the game are told Cock Robin is alive and well and they have all been telling a story! This is the part of the game which truly has the players interacting with each other and reveals the fun age of the times.<br/>The directions for the game of Cock Robin begin with choosing a person to be the dealer. After having all the cards dealt out to theplayers, the dealer is then the person who asks the questions.  For example, the dealer reads the first question of &ldquo;Who killed Cock Robin?&rdquo; The correct animal card to specifically answer is the Sparrow card. It reads, &ldquo;I, said the Sparrow, with my bow and arrow. I killed Cock Robin.&rdquo; If the player has the &lsquo;Sparrow&rsquo; card, he lays his card down on the table in front of him and the dealer asks the next question to the next player (Who saw him die?).<br/>If the player does not have the sparrow card in his hand, he picks a card from the player to his left and reads a generic answer card (often humorous) before laying that card on the table in a separate pile. The dealer proceeds to ask the next player the same question until the correct answer card is found and played. The player who answers the question will take any of the generic cards played to the question and place them (if there are any) in his hand<br/><br/>Once all the questions have been read and answered the exciting part of the game begins! The dealer reads the following script,<br/>&ldquo;Oh, Mr. Bullfinch, Oh, Mr. Popinjay <br/>Never believe what these little birds say-<br/>Bad little birds&mdash;telling us a story-<br/>Cock Robin is alive in all his glory!&rdquo;<br/>The dealer continues to read the next line of,<br/>&ldquo;Cock Robin is all alive&mdash;Mr. Sparrow, pay a fine for that story now, about your bow and arrow.&rdquo;<br/><br/><br/>The player who has the Cock Robin Sparrow Card in front of him must then &lsquo;pay the fine&rsquo;. The fine is anything the dealer wants it to be. In the directions, suggestions for the fine are, &ldquo;to kiss the one loved best (which is often the looking glass), or to flatter some of the other company&hellip;&rdquo;<br/>Additional scripts are read for each of the animals and the players with these cards in front of them must do what it says. Other examples are as follows:<br/>  Cock Robin is all alive&mdash;Miss Lark, Shut your eyes and sing us a song in the dark. <br/>  To pay for the story you told&mdash;Mr. Linnet, tell us where your night cap is, and how you get in it. <br/>  Your manners are very bad, Mr. Rook, in all your reading what was your dullest book?<br/> The last script read reveals the winner of the game of Cock Robin. It reads, &ldquo;And now Mr. Thrush, Come out of your bush, and sing us a song. Or give us a riddle; and we&rsquo;ll grant you the fame of winning the game.&rdquo;<br/><br/>"}, "111492": {"rpgartist": ["(Uncredited)"], "rpgitemversion": ["PDF version"], "poll": [], "name": "The Dangers of Iphus IV", "rpgdesigner": ["Dave Coulson"], "rpgproducer": ["Robin Elliott"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1131484.png", "usersrated": "0", "average": "0", "rpggenre": ["Science Fiction (Space Opera)"], "statistics": [], "rpg": ["Savage Worlds"], "rpgpublisher": ["Triple Ace Games Ltd"], "rpgcategory": ["Scenario / Adventure / Module"], "rpgseries": ["Ace Tales", "Daring Tales of the Space Lanes"], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1131484_t.png", "description": "From Introduction:<br/><br/>If it weren&rsquo;t for the spectacular ruins buried beneath the ice and rock, nobody would give the small planet Iphus IV a second thought.<br/><br/>Its distance from the system&rsquo;s star coupled with a naturally thin atmosphere combine to create a planet that is frozen all year round, of little interest to anyone but small mining outfits.<br/><br/>All that changed five years ago when an archeological team sponsored by the Tigris Corporation arrived and discovered a series of ancient ruins buried underneath the snow all across the surface.<br/><br/>The corp setup shop and has worked to put the small mining operations out of business in the staport of Fria so that they can claim the entire planet as their own.
