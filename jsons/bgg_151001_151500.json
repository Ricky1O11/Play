You and your rivals start with 10 life points each.  Using a combination of Blasts (unblockable magicks), Spells, and Counter-Spells, you try to reduce your opponents to zero life points and be the last spellcaster standing.<br/><br/>If you cast a Spell, opponents have a chance to cast their Counter-Spells.  Multiple Counter-Spells can be cast on each other, adding more damage and greater effects, shifting effects, or canceling them altogether.  Imagine one of the wand battles from the Harry Potter movies and you get the idea.  It's quite fun to cast a spell on your buddy, watch someone shift the effects to someone else and add to it, watch someone else shift the effects to yet another player, watch someone dispel that shift, watch the next person dispel that shift, and finally, you shift it back to the original target.<br/><br/>Wands is best with two to five players.  Games can be as short as a couple of minutes, and it shouldn't take more than ten minutes for anyone to learn the rules.<br/><br/>Wands is not a collectible card game.

Football had become the predominant national pastime &mdash; that is until the year 2032, the year baseball decided to revolutionize the game and regain the throne!<br/><br/>Starting in 2032, baseball games were shortened to six innings. Pitchers were encouraged to have bionic arm implants to improve their pitching. These cyborgs, or 'Borgs as they're affectionately known, were immediately popular and soon ruled the league. In 2041, robotic players were introduced to get more offense back into the game. These robots were similar to designated hitters in that they were used only to bat and did not field. However, recent reports indicate fielding 'Bots are on the way.<br/><br/>Now in 2045, human players are still in the game and known as Naturals. They are the best fielders by far but are sorely challenged when it comes to hitting and pitching. Some Naturals have learned to hit by swinging before the pitcher starts his windup, which gives them a chance to hit the ball. Although it's hard for a Natural to get into the league, those who do are popular. Many Naturals have named themselves after the great players of pre-2032 baseball by taking a first and last name borrowed from different star players of the past. The fans love them, and their presence on the team ensures good revenue!<br/><br/>The stage is now set! The fans are energized and root fanatically for their new favorites, be they 'Bots, 'Borgs or Naturals!<br/><br/>Baseball Highlights: 2045 is like watching TV&nbsp;highlights of early 21st-century baseball games, with the gameplay being full of theme with no outs or innings and without bogging down in a play-by-play baseball simulation. In this quick and interactive game, two players build their teams as they play, combining both strategy (building your team) and tactics (playing the game) without any of the downtime. During each &quot;mini-game&quot;, each player alternates playing six cards to simulate a full game's highlights. The mini-game includes defensive and offensive actions, and your single card play may include elements of defensive and/or offensive plays. Do you try to thwart your opponent's pending hits, put up strong offensive action of your own, or use your better players to do both? Players buy new free agents after each mini-game to improve their roster, and the team who wins the most mini-games in the series is the champ!<br/><br/>The contents of Baseball Highlights: 2045 box is:<br/><br/>1 rulebook<br/><br/>4 stadium mats<br/>4 reference sheets<br/><br/>120 cards:<br/><br/>     60 starter cards<br/>     60 free agent cards<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>60 wooden pawns:<br/><br/>     20 red<br/>     20 white<br/>     20 blue<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>12 cardboard markers:<br/><br/>     4 triangular markers (visitor/home)<br/>     8 circular markers<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>", "minplayers": "1", "boardgameversion": {"225808": "English first edition"}, "average": "7.67101", "name": "Baseball Highlights: 2045", "playingtime": "45", "boardgamemechanic": {"2664": "Deck / Pool Building"}, "age": "9", "boardgameexpansion": {}, "usersrated": "2061", "boardgameaccessory": {"197139": "Baseball Highlights: 2045 \u2013 Double Player Play Mat"}, "boardgamesubdomain": {"5497": "Strategy Games"}, "boardgamefamily": {"5586": "Sports: Baseball"}}, "151023": {"statistics": {}, "name": "Rocksmith 2014", "videogamemode": {"2313": "Cooperative"}, "videogameversion": {"268715": "Australian PlayStation 3 edition"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1908487.jpg", "videogameseries": {"26651": "Rocksmith"}, "videogametheme": {"2316": "Music"}, "usersrated": "13", "average": "8.42308", "videogamegenre": {"2163": "Rhythm"}, "videogameplatform": {"4435": "PlayStation 3"}, "poll": {}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1908487_t.jpg", "description": "From the Back of the Box:<br/><br/>Rocksmith 2014 Edition<br/><br/>The Fastest Way to Learn Guitar<br/><br/>Join over 1.5 million people who have learned to play guitar with the award-wining Rocksmith method.

CityScape uses connective tiles such as roadways, bridges, and railways to build the transportation network of the cities. These lead to destination tiles such as a bar, barbershop, basketball half court, bathroom, caf&eacute;, fountain, gas station, grocery, hot dog stand, Laundromat, motorcycle shop, office, park, squatter&rsquo;s home, subway entrance, and town art statue. Some tiles are obstacle tiles such as barricades, potholes, and narrow alleyways created by dumpsters that can cause problems in a chase. Construct a transportation system and a town for today&rsquo;s game. Then put away the tiles and you can make a brand new city for the next game!<br/><br/>This product is intended for use in modern or near future science fiction games.<br/><br/>There are several ways to use the tiles. You can use them to create a small city before play for a wargaming scenario set in an urban environment or a chase or combat inside an urban setting in a role-playing game. Or you can stack the tiles with the logo face up and randomly draw them from a deck to build a town as the group explores it or randomly generate tiles for a board game that needs roads, buildings, and other urban terrain.<br/><br/>The Print on Demand module has 88 tiles (single-sided tiles with the DramaScape CityScape logo on the back). This allows you to create a play area of 4 x 4 feet with all the tiles deployed. The Print on Demand version is printed on 12-point card stock and has a UV coat that allows for dry erase markers to be used on the tiles and then wiped off. This surface also allows it to be taped together for stability and then the tape removed just as easily for storage without hurting the tiles.<br/><br/>"}, "151045": {"statistics": {}, "name": "Nazo Puyo: Aruru no R\u016b", "videogamemode": {"2149": "Single-Player"}, "videogameversion": {"225846": "Japanese Game Gear edition"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1912874.png", "videogameseries": {"24146": "Nazo Puyo"}, "videogametheme": {"2337": "Cute Fantasy"}, "usersrated": "0", "average": "0", "videogamegenre": {"2165": "Puzzle"}, "videogameplatform": {"5857": "Nintendo 3DS"}, "poll": {}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1912874_t.png", "description": "User Summary<br/><br/>Nazo Puyo: Aruru no R\u016b is the third game in the Nazo Puyo series.

Set in Indonesia in the near future, Joint Operations takes the player to a country on the verge of disintegration. Regional independence movements have acquired advanced weaponry as the nation's military splits into competing factions. Escalating violence threatens innocent civilians and Western economic interests. Developed using the Black Hawk Down engine, Joint Operations promises superior rendering technology and an enhanced 3rd generation multiplayer experience.<br/><br/>Gameplay<br/>Although the game contains a series of single player training missions and operations accessible under the main page option &quot;Missions&quot;, most players utilize the game's multiplayer option to compete online under the main page option &quot;Novaworld&quot; which connects the player to Novalogic's online gaming environment, Novaworld. Each Joint Operations server at Novaworld has the potential to hold up to 150 players, based on server bandwidth capacity, making the game a Massive Multiplayer Online First Person Shooter. Although a number of these servers are run by Novalogic, anyone with a PC and sufficient internet bandwidth can host a server, with a player limit of up to 64 people. Many independent servers exist, hosted by individuals or groups of players who form clans.<br/><br/>In the multiplayer setting, the game has five modes, which dictate how gameplay proceeds on any given map:<br/>-Coop: All players are on the Joint Operations side and fight against a rebel artificial intelligence team.<br/>-Advance and Secure: Both teams try to capture and hold all the bases on the maps before time runs out.<br/>-Team King of the Hill: The teams try to occupy a small zone on the map for ten minutes to win.<br/>-Deathmatch: A kill limit is imposed, and all players operate independently seeking to kill other players to reach that goal before the clock runs out.<br/>-Team Deathmatch: A kill limit is imposed, and both teams try to kill players on the opposing team to reach that goal before the clock runs out.<br/><br/>Features<br/>-Joint Ops features tons of drivable vehicles. Use land, sea, and air vehicles to attack the enemy. You can pilot helicopters, command boats, and drive fast attack vehicles with your team on board, firing on the move. Use LCACs (Landing Craft Air Cushioned) or Chinook helicopters to transport teammates and vehicles from island to island or across expansive terrain.<br/>-Choose from a vast amount of weapons to defeat the enemy.<br/>-You can play as a team online through NovaWorld, NovaLogic's online gaming service, or have a LAN party.<br/>-Play as a member of the Joint Operations team or the Rebels team with a different choice of weapons depending on what team you join!<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;Joint Operations: Typhoon Rising&quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "151066": {"boardgamedesigner": {"3": {"name": "(Uncredited)"}}, "average": "0", "poll": {}, "name": "Championship Speedway Racing StockCar Game", "playingtime": "0", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": {"2035": "Roll / Spin and Move"}, "yearpublished": "1996", "usersrated": "0", "maxplayers": "6", "boardgamefamily": {"6206": "Sports: Auto Racing"}, "boardgameartist": {"3": "(Uncredited)"}, "statistics": {}, "boardgamepublisher": {"26243": {"name": "Cars, Cards, & More, Inc."}}, "boardgameversion": {"225878": "English edition 1996"}, "maxplaytime": "0", "boardgamecategory": {"1031": {"name": "Racing"}}, "age": "6", "minplaytime": "0", "description": "A roll and move StockCar Racing game.<br/><br/>Roll 2 d6, move the number of spaces on higher of the d6.

Physically, they are similar - comparable in size, facial structure, and skin tones. Genetically, they are compatible. Given the basic physical similarity of humanoid races and creatures, elves and humans are among the few who can successfully procreate together. It is the fey defiance of mortality that is the cause of most of the problems of the elven-human bond...<br/><br/>An elf and human coupling is destined to be short lived or to end in tragedy. If the differences<br/>in culture do not end the relationship prematurely, the differences in lifespan leave elf widows and widowers. Legends abound of human heroes and elven princesses overcoming great obstacles of evil and tyranny, only to enjoy only a brief moment of happiness in their incongruent lifespans.<br/><br/>Half-elves embody the tragedy of their parents. Most half-elves grow up in broken homes, misunderstood by their parents. Half-elves reach adulthood slightly later than humans, but they reach merely middle age by the time humans are coming to the ends of their lives. When elf parents of half-elf children leave on decade-long campaigns, they return to find they have missed their children&rsquo;s formative years. Human parents of half-elf children become convinced that their children have developmental disabilities, taking longer to acquire basic skills despite the elf reputation for genius intellect. Half-elves invariably grow up marginally aware of a missing component to their childhood, nicknamed the &lsquo;soulheart&rsquo;, and are frequently frustrated by their inability to identify it.<br/><br/>Rarely, a half-elf is born of two half-elf parents. Half-elves get along together in short spurts. Unless each half-elf fulfills the other&rsquo;s soulheart, the awkwardness in one tends to provoke painful memories in the other. The most successful half-elf couplings are between a half-elf raised by elves and a half-elf raised by humans.<br/><br/>Presented here are several options for your half-elf characters, including new racial variants,feats, flaws, and equipment.

Instead, all ships are created equal with intelligent enemy strategy being used to defeat the unsuspecting human player. For the novice player even a one-on-one scenario is quite a challenge.<br/><br/>Begin also features four different nations, Federation, Klingon, Romulan and Orion, with the human player becoming the nation of their choice. The program also provides for numerous ship classes of varying design for each of the different nation.<br/><br/>There are not any artificial &quot;difficulty levels&quot; in Begin. Instead if a player wishes for an easier scenario, they may command a fleet of up to seventeen ships against a smaller enemy force. For a more difficult scenario, one-on-nine is a more likely challenge.<br/><br/>The object of Begin is (as usual) to destroy the enemy fleet before they destroy you.

The more you attract, the more likely monsters will attack!<br/><br/><br/>Overview<br/><br/>Hire and train your workers, build and upgrade your attractions, and convince your battle weary heroes to fight just one more time so without letting too many tourists get eaten! Gain Victory points by upgrading attractions and giving Heroes the rest they need. The highest scoring player when all monsters are defeated is the winner.<br/><br/><br/>Setup<br/><br/>Each player begins with a humble resort consisting of a Beach, a Tiki Hut and a small number of Tourists, placed at each attraction. Each player starts with their own worker Deck consisting of 7 Apprentices, 3 Street Performers, and 3 Lazy Peons.<br/><br/><br/>Gameplay<br/><br/>Each round consists of 4 phases:<br/><br/><br/>Phase I - Get to Work<br/><br/><br/>     Each Player draws a hand of 5 Workers from their Worker Deck.<br/>     Players simultaneously send worker cards from their hand to do work at each of their Attractions. Any missing units of work (are required by the Attraction) cause Tourists to leave before gathering resources.<br/>     Players gain the primary resource of Gold by having more tourists at each attraction, and Flair by having less tourists. <br/><br/><br/><br/>Phase II - Action: Attract, Hire &amp; Upgrade<br/><br/>In order, players take one action per turn or pass. Players will be interacting with common draft areas, as well as using abilities from their own workers and attractions. Possible actions include:<br/><br/>     Attract Tourists from the Dock (Spending Flair) - Tourists are placed at attractions, potentially increasing the Gold gained on the subsequent turn.<br/>     Attract a Hero from the Dock (Spending Flair) - Heroes start with low health, which is gained at the end of each round. Fully Rested Heroes are scored for Victory Points.<br/>     Upgrade an Attraction (Spending Gold) - Providing higher tourist capacity, better Gold payout, better abilities and more Victory Points. Upgraded attractions typically require more workers to keep them fully staffed.<br/>     Train or Hire new Workers (Spending Gold) - Upgrade your workers to provide more work, or better abilities. Training locks a worker draft pile, preventing other players from upgrading to that particular worker during the round. Training workers is a 1-for-1 exchange, keeping players' Worker Deck lean by design. <br/>     Pass - The first Player to Pass becomes the Start Player for the next round<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Any time during a player's turn, he may use abilities from fully-staffed attractions, or discard worker cards to use their unique abilities.<br/><br/><br/>Phase III - A Ship Arrives<br/><br/>The dock is refilled with new Heroes and Tourists from a center pile. While refilling, it's possible to trigger a Monster Attack!<br/><br/>     If an Attack! card is revealed, the top Monster from the Monster Pile will choose which player it's attacking; typically by Most Tourists or Most Heroes at their resort, ties broken clockwise from the start player.<br/>     If a Hero defends against a Monster Attack, he loses 1 health. Any undefended damage causes tourists to be eaten by the Monster.<br/>     Heroes may dodge into, or out of, a Monster Attack up to one time per round.<br/>     If an attraction has no Hero or Tourists, a Monster will Damage it, potentially destroying the attraction.<br/>     A player may chose (if they have one) to throw a Lazy Peon at the monster, ending the attack and permenantly removing the Worker Card from the game.<br/>     The Dock Continues to refill, potentially triggering more Monster Attacks, until it is full.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Phase IV - Clean Up<br/><br/><br/>     Used and unused Workers are placed in players' discard piles.<br/>     Any fully-rested Heroes are scored - Placed to the side, each worth Victory Points at the end of the game.

Holy crusaders march into enemy territory to recapture a location of vital strategic importance, and Road to War gives you a collection of encounters and scenarios to augment the scope and flavor of the existing adventures, replacing tedious random encounters and monotonous overland journeys with exciting and evocative events. These scenarios can be played independently or linked into a unique subplot to recover the legendary Equinox Crown, a relic of the ancient druidical circles that will come in very handy later in the campaign as they face down the Locust Lord and his swarming hosts. This item forms a key touchstone for many (though not all) of the encounters in Road to War, and it is designed to grow in power alongside the PCs as they rise to become mythic heroes in their own right, standing in the breach in a war the world dare not lose. Keep your faith and your sword ready, and set out on the Road to War!<br/><br/>Written by the dynamic duo of Jim Groves and Neil Spicer, authors of two of the Righteous Crusade AP adventures, with art by Tim Kings-Lynne, this 26-page adventure also features a text-free player handout maps and a brand-new monster, the rock-solid durdalis, and a variety of harrowing challenges of mind, heart, and strength.

The game was picked up by the DECUS user group in 1972 and distributed to many universities and other PDP-10 installations around the world, often appearing alongside the ASCII text game Star Trek.<br/><br/>The two Star Trek games were among the most popular mainframe computer games of the 1970s and could be played for free on college computer systems. The script game did not use a graphic sector/quadrant display as was used in the other popular Star Trek game. Instead, it described the action by generating a &quot;script&quot; of dialogue in traditional dramatic format using the names of Enterprise crew members from the popular television series.<br/><br/>Play begins with the player entering a name for the ship's captain. Spock then declares that a Klingon, Romulan or Tholian vessel has appeared on the Enterprise's sensors, and announce its position. On each turn, Sulu or Chekov provide updates on the enemy's position and Uhura asks for the player's orders.<br/><br/>The player issues orders by entering a number (initially from 1 to 10, later as high as 19 as additional orders were added to the code) to tell the crew of the Enterprise what to do. Additional data might need to be entered depending on the particular order. Options include moving closer or farther away from the enemy vessel, and firing phasers or photon torpedoes. The different weapons each have optimal ranges.<br/><br/>After each player turn the results are announced by Spock and then the enemy moves, fires or takes other action. Damage to shields, weapons and engines is reported, as well as the rising count of Enterprise casualties.<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;Star Trek (script game)&quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "151219": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1847400.png", "boardgameimplementation": {"63082": "Ombre"}, "poll": {}, "boardgamedesigner": {"3": {"name": "(Uncredited)"}}, "statistics": {}, "yearpublished": "1650", "maxplayers": "8", "boardgameartist": {"3": "(Uncredited)"}, "boardgamepublisher": {"171": {"name": "(Public Domain)"}}, "maxplaytime": "0", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1847400_t.png", "minplaytime": "0", "boardgamecategory": {"1002": {"name": "Card Game"}}, "description": "A traditional Japanese trick-taking card game based on the European game Ombre (originally &quot;l'Hombre&quot;), played with a special 75-card five-suited deck. This deck developed from Tensh\u014d karuta, itself a close copy of the 48-card traditional Portuguese cards called &quot;dragon cards&quot; due to the dragons holding the suit symbols in the aces. Its creation was prompted by a ban on the older form of playing cards after Japan closed off the contact with the Western world in 1633, and became critical towards everything of European origin.<br/><br/>The deck contains all 48 cards from Tensh\u014d karuta; these are supplemented by introducing a fifth suit and increasing the number of cards in each suit from twelve to fifteen. Most additions refer to Japanese and Chinese culture, presumably a conscious choice intended to downplay the European origins of the game.<br/><br/>The suits are \u306f\u3046 (hau), &quot;flower&quot; based on Portuguese 'paus' meaning &quot;clubs&quot;, \u3044\u3059 (isu) a shortened form of 'espadas' or &quot;swords&quot;, \u3053\u3063\u3077 (koppu) from 'copas' or  &quot;cups&quot;, \u304a\u3046\u308b (\u014dru) from 'ouros' or &quot;coins&quot; (literally &quot;golds&quot;) and finally the added \u3050\u308b (guru) with the traditional Japanese \u4e09\u3064\u5df4 (mitsudomoe) sign as suit symbol. As in the European predecessor games, higher-numbered pip cards beat lower ones only in the former two suits, while the latter ones are &quot;reversed&quot;.<br/><br/>The &quot;dragon aces&quot; are split into two distinct ranks by reintroducing a normal &quot;one&quot; in each suit and separate from the \u308d\u3070\u3044 (robai) or &quot;dragon&quot; which normally ranks right above the ones. Above the number cards (1&ndash;9 plus robai) there are five court cards. From low to high, these are: \u305d\u3046\u305f (s\u014dta) &quot;queen&quot;, \u3046\u307e (uma) &quot;horse&quot;, \u304d\u308a (kiri) &quot;soldier&quot; (originally a king), \u3046\u3093 (un) various Japanese mythological figures and \u3059\u3093 (sun) various Chinese officials. The latter two ranks give the game its name. In the trump suit, the robai is promoted to above the kiri and the s\u014dta above this again, except that the robai of hau is a permanent trump which is the fourth highest regardless of which suit is trump.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "3", "boardgameversion": {"226128": "Virginia and Harold Wayland replica edition"}, "average": "0", "name": "Unsun karuta", "playingtime": "0", "boardgamemechanic": {"2009": "Trick-taking"}, "age": "0", "usersrated": "0", "boardgamefamily": {"10634": "Country: Japan"}}, "151220": {"boardgamedesigner": {"3": {"name": "(Uncredited)"}}, "average": "5.54545", "poll": {}, "name": "Monopolino", "playingtime": "40", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": {"2035": "Roll / Spin and Move"}, "yearpublished": "0", "usersrated": "11", "maxplayers": "4", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1847656_t.jpg", "boardgameartist": {"3": "(Uncredited)"}, "statistics": {}, "boardgamepublisher": {"3320": {"name": "(Unknown)"}}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1847656.jpg", "boardgameversion": {"226129": "Italian edition"}, "maxplaytime": "40", "boardgamecategory": {"1021": {"name": "Economic"}}, "age": "5", "minplaytime": "40", "description": "Object of the game: be the richest player when the game ends.

It&rsquo;s played on the squares of a 10x10 square board, which is initially empty. Apart from the board, the necessary material comprises seven shooters and a sufficient number of black and white stones.<br/><br/>This game won (along with Four) the BoardGameGeek Best Combinatorial 2-Player Game of 2013 Award.<br/><br/><br/>Definitions<br/><br/>A piece is a shooter, a black stone or a white stone.<br/><br/>A group is a set of one or more like-colored, orthogonally adjacent stones. The size of a group is the number of stones in it.<br/><br/>A trapped shooter is a shooter that can&rsquo;t make any legal move in the current position.<br/><br/><br/>Play<br/><br/>The board starts out empty. Black starts the game by placing three shooters on empty squares of the board, and then White places the remaining four in the same fashion. In both cases, no shooters can be placed orthogonally or diagonally adjacent to any other. This restriction doesn&rsquo;t apply to the rest of the game.<br/><br/>From then on, the players take turns, starting with Black. On his turn, a player can (but is not obliged to) move a shooter to an empty square in a straight orthogonal or diagonal line, without jumping over any other pieces. Then, the player must place a stone of his color on an empty square which is on the same straight orthogonal or diagonal line as the destination square of the moved shooter (or any shooter, if none was moved), with no other pieces in between along that line. This is called shooting. Claimed shooters (see below) can&rsquo;t move or shoot.<br/><br/>At this moment, if there are any trapped shooters on the board that haven&rsquo;t been claimed before, each one of them is claimed by the player who owns the biggest group orthogonally adjacent to it. If there is no such group or the biggest such groups of each color are the same size, the shooter is claimed by the opponent. Claiming a shooter is indicated by placing a stone of the corresponding color on top of it. Claimed shooters remain unchanged for the rest of the game. Stones on top of shooters aren't part of any groups.<br/><br/>The game ends when a player has claimed the majority of shooters, i.e. at least four of them. That player wins. Draws are not possible.<br/><br/><br/>Smaller versions<br/><br/>For shorter but still reasonable games, the following variants are suggested:<br/><br/><br/>     7x7 board with three shooters. Black places one shooter on his first turn, and White places the other two. Whoever claims two shooters wins.<br/><br/><br/><br/>     9x9 board with five shooters.

At first, the band meets a few skeletal warriors, possessed bones of a long dead army, risen to serve their Queen. After battling against the more corrupted White Bone Demon forms, the Pilgrims find that their Cleanse Ritual is not so effective against these Demon-possessed skeletons. Finally, the narrow path takes them to the Forbidden White Cave, where the Pilgrims confront Yara, Queen of the White Bone Demon Clan, who realises that this is no ordinary group of mortals. If Yara can eat the flesh of Tripitaka, she can gain immortality, regenerate her flesh and regain her beauty. As she launches her minions into a pitched battle, the fast moving White Bone Demons scuttle across the battlefield and Yara herself joins the fray.<br/><br/>Will Yara&rsquo;s poisoned attack will be the end of our four travelers? There is more at stake than just the Pilgrims lives. If they can defeat Yara and the White Bone Demon Clan, Tripitaka will recover the second piece of the lost Sutras and will be one step closer to restoring the seal on the Underworld.<br/><br/>As normal for expansions, this is not a standalone product. There will be a rules supplement, but it will be based on the Journey rulebook. You will play with some Map Tiles and Bridge Tiles from Journey and the base rules are the same. But the expansion is more than different shaped playing pieces. The White Bone Demons play very differently to the Bull Demons, being faster and harder to cleanse. Faster means it is easier for the Pilgrims to get overrun. With the Cleanse Ritual being less effective, Pilgrims will have to risk more kills and Bad Karma. You will need new strategies to defeat the White Bone Demons.<br/><br/>Finally, there is a new game mechanic. The White Bone Demons are the reanimated bones of long dead warriors. Demon Spirits possess the bones and over time, warp them in to horrific shapes. This separation between the Demon&rsquo;s spirit and the warrior&rsquo;s body may explain why the Cleanse Ritual is harder, but it is certainly the explanation of the biggest surprise the Pilgrims will face. Dead White Bone Demons are left on the board and if Yara can attract another Demon Spirit, these piles of bones may spring back to life!<br/><br/>"}, "151261": {"rpgitemversion": {"226218": "PDF version"}, "statistics": {}, "name": "You Ain't From Around Here, Are You?", "rpgproducer": {"72045": "John Fountain"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1846348.jpg", "usersrated": "0", "average": "0", "rpggenre": {"940": "Action / Adventure"}, "rpg": {"24038": "When Worlds Collide"}, "rpgcategory": {"2084": "Scenario / Adventure / Module"}, "poll": {}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1846348_t.jpg", "description": "From publisher blurb:<br/><br/>&ldquo;Well, pardners, that weird rift-thingie done gone and dropped you right where you don&rsquo;t belong, and that&rsquo;s no mistake.

It's designed for two to six players of any age, as long as they can understand how to make matches with dice.<br/><br/>The goal is to get as high a score as possible without losing your turn. To do this, you roll five special dice (four white, one red), each with one side blank. The red die is called the &quot;Danger Die.&quot;  If at any time you roll all white blanks, or you roll a red blank, your turn ends without scoring.<br/><br/>You score points by making three/four/five-of-a-kind matches or a straight (1-2-3-4-5). After each roll, you can stop and bank your points (gaining bonus points for matches, plus the total of all spots on the dice), or you can set aside dice of your choice and reroll what's left. However, you MUST set aside any blank white dice after each roll.<br/><br/>An added element of risk management comes when you have a bonus score available, such as from four-of-a-kind. When you do, you have the extra choice of hanging onto those bonus points and rerolling all five dice, with the bonus score still in jeopardy if you should roll blanks and lose your turn. This lets you &quot;start over&quot; with a higher starting value, but all the same risks of losing your turn.<br/><br/>Educational Value<br/><br/>Chikken teaches kids to understand and analyze risks.

Facts: each card represents a fact from a biography (for example, &quot;She wrote a book&quot;, &quot;Something is named after her&quot;, &quot;She was imprisoned&quot;, etc.).<br/>2. Professions, such as &quot;politician&quot;, &quot;actor&quot;, &quot;soldier&quot;, etc.<br/>3.

Then everybody tries to name a famous person that matches the task of the card. The fastest player reveals the top card of one of the remaining decks, and now the players try to name the person who matches two criteria, and so on.<br/><br/>For example, if the cards &quot;C&quot; and &quot;She wrote a book&quot; were revealed, it's possible to name Julius Caesar, Winston Churchill, Clive Barker, or any other person with the first &quot;C&quot; in his/her name (or surname, or nickname) and known as an author. If nobody could name a person after the next card was revealed, than the player who had correctly named the previous person wins a round. You cannot reveal more than 4 cards (one per deck): if someone has managed to name a person with 4 cards, he wins that round.<br/><br/>The game is played till one of the decks is depleted.<br/><br/>Contents:<br/>96 cards (24 per deck)<br/>2 blank cards for your own tasks<br/>rules<br/><br/>"}, "151352": {"rpg": {"356": "Generic / Universal"}, "statistics": {}, "name": "The Fire Within: Codes and Principles", "rpgproducer": {"62156": "Teresa Bane"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1849717.jpg", "usersrated": "0", "rpgitemversion": {"226374": "PDF version"}, "average": "0", "rpggenre": {"961": "Fantasy"}, "rpgcategory": {"2108": "Sourcebook (rules/options to enhance play)"}, "poll": {}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1849717_t.jpg", "description": "From publisher blurb:<br/><br/>This is the character building tool you need.<br/><br/>It is a personality tool to define what a character believes in.

Each player's deck also specifies his buyer role, and he will make every effort during the game to get as many resources as possible of the type he is interested in. These roles are kept secret until the end of the game.<br/><br/>Players leave the table and split up into continually changing pairs or groups to negotiate and exchange some of their resources, away from prying eyes. Every three minutes, they return to the table to collect new resources at the docks (from the GM). Then they go again for another three minutes of secret dealing.<br/><br/>The second phase, called the Tribunal phase, starts once the players have returned to the table and the GM has run out of resources.<br/><br/>At the tribunal, players play the roles of jury members, witnesses, suspects and judges! They openly discuss their suspicions concerning the secret roles assigned to every other player. The GM reveals the suspect cards in pairs representing the dealer and buyer roles assigned to the various players. For each card pair, players have one minute to debate. After one minute, a simultaneous vote is cast, and a suspect is formally accused.<br/><br/>Scoring<br/><br/>At the end of the game, each player reveals his role pair and acquired resources. He scores one victory point for each resource acquired corresponding to his buyer role, one point for each suspect card accusing him wrongly, thus rewarding him for his skills in misdirection and discretion, but he loses 5 points for each suspect card accurately accusing him, representing 5 years spent in prison. It is very easy to end the game with a 10-year jail sentence if you are insufficiently discreet or are too greedy!<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "5", "boardgameversion": {"226405": "Multilingual first edition"}, "age": "18", "name": "Illegal", "playingtime": "25", "boardgamemechanic": {"2073": "Acting"}, "average": "6.27046", "usersrated": "109", "boardgamefamily": {"22783": "Admin: Better Description Needed!"}}, "151370": {"statistics": {}, "name": "Kabuki Warriors", "videogamemode": {"2149": "Single-Player"}, "videogameversion": {"226409": "Japanese Xbox edition"}, "average": "0", "videogametheme": {"2510": "Dancing"}, "usersrated": "0", "videogamegenre": {"2159": "Fighting"}, "videogameplatform": {"4442": "Xbox"}, "poll": {}, "description": "From the back of the box<br/><br/>As a fight promoter for a troop of Kabuki warriors trying to travel from Edo to Kyoto, your actor/samurai must possess both strength and style.

Many men have said that history is written by those who achieve victory. The truth is that history is written by those who want to hide the truth from the fragile minds of humanity. Why, you may ask? If humanity knew the truth about the world around them, it would truly drive them insane. The mind of the average citizen cannot fathom the powers that lie just beyond their reach; nor do they possess the willpower to steel their minds from the horrors that surround us every day.&rdquo;<br/><br/>- Grand Inquisitor Black Steel<br/><br/>Few understand what lurks within the shadows. Their knowledge, however, is key to humanity&rsquo;s survival. For thousands of years, humanity has been fighting a battle with the occult and the horrors from the Chaos Realm and other Mortal Realms. Sometimes they win, sometimes they lose, but the war never seems to end. As time moves on, humanity became stronger, able to stand against those wishing to enslave or kill them. However, to do this, almost everyone would have to think these horrors do not exist. It is the books of history that reflect this change from knowing to disbelieving.<br/><br/>Shadowed Earth is a fantasy horror alternate history setting that spans all time. It takes the folklore, mythology, and legends of old and makes them real. It then combines those with elements of horror to make it more dangerous. This is the core setting guide, establishing the framework and canon that makes-up all of Shadowed Earth. It is written as an all-encompassing setting for Mystical Throne Entertainment&rsquo;s various RPG settings and fictional offerings and is presented with no particular system in mind. You can use this book to expand your Shadowed Earth games, create your own Shadowed Earth settings, or plug-in various modules, placing them in the alternate history of Shadowed Earth (such as the Ultimate Roman Legions Guide and Ultimate Three Kingdoms Guide).<br/><br/>The Shadowed Earth core setting guide includes:<br/><br/>     A narrative retelling of all major historical events within the Shadowed Earth alternate history.<br/>     A journey from Prehistory to the New Age, defining the major movements of the Occult and the Inquisition.<br/>     An introduction to the major organizations: Inquisition, The Fallen, Illuminati, and the Occult.<br/>     A small GM&rsquo;s Guide for how Game Masters can incorporate Shadowed Earth into their games.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>The truth may be more dangerous than the lie&hellip;<br/><br/>"}, "151439": {"statistics": {}, "name": "Hydlide II: Shine of Darkness", "videogamemode": {"2149": "Single-Player"}, "videogameversion": {"226545": "Japanese MSX edition"}, "average": "0", "videogameseries": {"7976": "Hydlide"}, "videogametheme": {"2148": "Fantasy"}, "usersrated": "0", "videogamegenre": {"2339": "Action RPG"}, "videogameplatform": {"5134": "MSX"}, "poll": {}, "description": "The game introduced a morality meter, where the player can be aligned with Justice, Normal, or Evil.

In Shine, you are a person who has recently become a Christian. Though saved and forgiven, you still struggle with sin. Your goal is to remove sin from your life and grow in spiritual maturity. To do this, you will spend time in God&rsquo;s word, prayer, and use your spiritual gifts to minister to the lost and the hurting. It is not as easy as it seems. Satan prowls like a roaring lion. You will face various temptations, but through it all, God will never leave you or forsake you.<br/><br/>Game objective - The object of this game is to build a deck, called a Life Deck. This deck represents a player&rsquo;s spiritual maturity. Each player starts off with spiritual fruit, and a lot of sin. As the game progresses, players try to remove sin from their life decks and gain various cards, including more spiritual fruit. Character cards that represent people in need and sets of fruit cards are worth victory points.  Sin cards are worth negative victory points. The player, with the most victory points at the end of the game wins.<br/><br/>Game play - As a player you have the choice to pray or to shine.<br/><br/>If you choose to pray, you start off by using one of your spiritual gifts. Spiritual gifts allow a player to gain a specific spiritual fruit card. There are 9 different kinds of fruit cards and they are the resource used in Shine to gain other cards. <br/>- You may use the abilities on scripture cards that take effect during prayer. <br/>- You may remove a card from your deck, usually sin. <br/>- You may also place any number of cards from your hand into your discard pile. <br/>- To conclude your turn you draw cards until you have 7 cards in your hand.<br/><br/>If you choose to shine, you start by using one of your spiritual gifts. <br/>- You may play and use the abilities on scripture cards and character cards that you gained during previous rounds. <br/>- You may trade a fruit card with any card in the fellowship pool. The fellowship pool allows players to trade fruit cards. <br/>- You may trade in 2 fruit cards to gain a new fruit card. When you trade in a card it is removed from your deck.<br/>- You may play fruit cards to gain new scripture and character cards.<br/>- To conclude your turn draw cards until you have 7 cards in your hand.<br/><br/>When a player draws the last card from their life deck, the current round ends. <br/>- Each player shuffles their discarded life cards and places them under their life decks.<br/>- Then each player draws the top card of their temptation deck and does what it says. Temptation cards force the player to draw more sin cards and have stronger effects if a player has sin that they have not dealt with.<br/><br/>The game ends when all of the temptation cards have been drawn. Character cards and full sets of 9 fruit cards are worth positive victory points and sin cards are worth negative victory points.

These universes follow vastly different laws of physics and are prone to annihilating each other if they should ever touch. Though these events do happen, they are quite rare thanks to a weightless and almost completely elastic extrauniversal fluid known as the ether.<br/><br/>There are some puny and insignificant organic creatures who find themselves attuned to this background noise of the multiverse, this infinite source of energy that surrounds them and suffuses the void beyond the edge of everything. Finding they have the ability to communicate with the extrauniversal fluid and to draw from its raw, shapeless energy to do as they will, these ethermancers tend to fall into two camps. Some believe that the universe chose them to carry its greatest gift and use it to protect this tiny speck of creation. Others feel it is a perfect excuse to lord it over everyone. Given humanoid nature, the latter tends to be far more common.<br/><br/>The end result of three months of development, the ethermancer base class takes equal parts Douglas Adams and H. P. Lovecraft to produce an &ldquo;all day long&rdquo; spellcaster class with a cosmic flavor. The spiritual successor to the warlock base class of the 3.5 days, the ethermancer seeks to have improved playability by offering the ability to mix and match spell effects to make custom evocations on the fly. Whereas the warlock simply blasted, the ethermancer can ask, &ldquo;How hard?&rdquo; Thanks to the advent of a spell point pool, players must choose whether or not to spend more than they will regenerate next turn. Incredibly potent effects are indeed possible, but firing them off without a care in the world will reduce the player to single-target ranged touch attacks in a hurry!<br/><br/>Roleplayers will be pleased to find that their character's personality and character development feeds directly back into the base class. Through the Multiuniversal Philosophy class feature, players decide how their character views their great gift and receives corresponding abilities that feed directly into the character's capstone.

Until finally the Empire of Man grew too large; internal dissention and external jealousy conspired to destroy it. First the far-flung Empire became too difficult to control centrally.  Outer systems demanded more sovereignty, leading to rebellion and civil war. And once that war was lost, neighboring races pounced, snatching what they could.

Humanity has spread all over known space, but humans on Mother Terra are ready to reach again for the stars. Ready to reclaim their Shattered Empire<br/><br/>Shattered Empire is a Print and Play (PnP) solo game in which the player takes on the struggles of the people of Earth to rebuild and defend their new star empire. The map depicts the systems around Old Terra and, beyond that, the regions controlled by other governments and races. Each turn represents about a decade of time and each ship counter is an individual starship. Players try to expand and defend their empire and score victory points over a 150 year period of time (less if your empire completely succumbs to its foes).<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "1", "boardgameversion": {"226623": "First Edition"}, "age": "12", "name": "Shattered Empire", "playingtime": "60", "boardgamemechanic": {"2072": "Dice Rolling"}, "average": "6", "usersrated": "2", "boardgamefamily": {"8164": "Solitaire Wargames"}}, "151494": {"statistics": {}, "name": "Gildenbrief (Issue 53 - Mar 2004)", "rpgproducer": {"30930": "Elsa Franke"}, "average": "0", "usersrated": "0", "rpgissue": {"16866": "Gildenbrief"}, "rpg": {"1288": "Midgard (4th Edition)"}, "rpgissueversion": {"226624": "Print Version"}, "poll": {}, "description": "user summary<br/><br/>This issue focuses on the coastal states and Alba.
