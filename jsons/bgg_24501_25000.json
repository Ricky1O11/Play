The battlefield/scenario section includes 8 scenarios and 2 terrain layouts. Games can be opponent elimination, getting to a certain space, protecting a certain figure, or holding out for a certain number of turns.<br/><br/>The rulebook features two games: a basic and a master version. In the basic version, designed for younger players, characters move, attack, defend, and have range -- but there are no special powers and some other rules are minimized or eliminated. The master game includes special powers, wounds, engagement rules, falling rules, and a few other additions.<br/><br/>Each unit has a movement rating in hexes. Combat is fairly straightforward.

A Record Sheet is made out with values for each Leader and Warband involved in a game.<br/><br/>Initiative is determine by use of cards from a conventional card deck.  Each player is assigned a card number or suit, adding a card for each Warband under a player's control.  Additional cards can be added to reflect additional events or participants in a given scenario, for example, the random appearance of a traveling Lord or Bishop and retinue.<br/><br/>Dynamics of play involve Morale, Courage, Agility, Terrain, Non-Warband Movement, Shieldwalls and Wedges, the use of ships, and Mounted forces.  Information is provided for Saxons and Normans as well as Vikings, and the system is also adaptable to other peoples with whom the Vikings interacted, including Picts, Arabs or Skraelings (Native Americans) with a little historical research on the gamer's part.<br/><br/>The game is well suited to multiplayer games, each player handling one or more Warbands of anywhere from six to twenty or more figures on the table.  Game length is dependent upon the scenario design, from swift ship-to-ship fights to extended coastal raids or open-field battles.<br/><br/>The game is enhanced by the inclusion of a random events card deck which adds variety and surprises to play.<br/><br/>Unlike many sets of miniatures rules, Strandhogg can be enjoyed by players owning only a few dozen figures; an average Warband might number ten to twelve figures, and three Warbands compose a raiding force under a Noble.  The rulebook is sprinkled with sidebars featuring excerpts from the Norse Sagas for flavor, and also includes optional rules for special attributes or traits to individualize Leaders or leading warriors (for example, a warrior surnamed &quot;the Stout&quot; gains +1 on Defense; &quot;Leg Biter&quot; enjoys a +1 on Offense).<br/><br/>Players will often find themselves identifying strongly with the fortunes of their warband and even individuals within it; although Strandhogg is not a role-playing game, it deliberately strives to impart a strong flavor of its Viking focus.<br/><br/>Web address: STRANDHOGG@rochester.rr.com<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "1", "boardgameversion": {"195538": "First edition"}, "name": "Strandhogg", "playingtime": "150", "boardgamemechanic": {"2040": "Hand Management"}, "average": "6.875", "usersrated": "8", "boardgamesubdomain": {"4664": "Wargames"}, "boardgamefamily": {"5613": "Vikings"}}, "24706": {"boardgamedesigner": {"1152": {"name": "Sara Finch"}}, "poll": {}, "name": "Where is Moldova?", "playingtime": "45", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": {"2047": "Memory"}, "yearpublished": "2005", "usersrated": "35", "maxplayers": "4", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic163458_t.jpg", "average": "5.32857", "statistics": {}, "boardgamepublisher": {"5743": {"name": "S.G.

Each player controls 2-4 different lines (based on the number of players).<br/><br/>On each turn, a player can build four pieces of track on the map in any of their color.

PBI is an infantry game with armor present as support. Artillery and the like is off table.<br/><br/>A set of WW2 company level rules. The game is played on a 4 foot by 4 foot grid, split into 6&quot; squares. A company would typically consist of 3 tanks and 25 bases of infantry.<br/><br/>The scale is 1 to 1. This means that a base of three figures represents three men. A tank model represents a real tank. The tabletop scale is 10m to the inch.<br/><br/>The Overall concept.<br/><br/>PBI is intended to provide a two hour wargame. All of the dice used are simple D6. All of the mechanisms are intuitive. PBI uses a gridded board. This means that all movement, range and areas are described in terms of squares. Because the player takes the role of the company commander, the squares of the grid allow him to get soldiers to &quot;go over there and do that&quot;, rather than measuring distances and engaging in single figure management. By using a grid it is very clear what scenery type the figures are in. There are three types of square. Closed (buildings and woods), Partial (hedges, walls and fences) and open (no significant cover).<br/><br/>The rules generate a scenario which both players have a fair chance of winning. The game is always of the attack/defense style.<br/><br/>PBI uses a lot of D6 (a typical section shooting would roll 10 dice). This helps give a feel for the massive amount of ammunition expended and allows the probabilities to even out (the more dice you roll, the more predictable the result).<br/><br/>The aim of PBI is to create company level engagements which players can win by use of better tactics.

The first game in the series, Awakening the Bear! &ndash; Russia 1941-1942, takes you to the eastern front during Operation Barbarossa, the German invasion of Russia. Many consider this time period to be the birth of modern warfare tactics that continue to be used and perfected by today's modern armies.<br/><br/>Conflict of Heroes merges the elegance of streamlined Eurogame rules with deep strategic wargames. The series was designed to create a tense and highly interactive game play experience. You must manage multiple command resources to move, attack, and take other actions with your units. This gives you great flexibility in executing your battle plans, but makes constant caution necessary as unit activations on either side can happen at any time.<br/><br/>Much effort went into distinguishing the units in the game by highlighting their historical strengths and weaknesses.

In addition, a swallow cannot be dropped so as to give immediate mate.<br/><br/>The promotion zone for Swallows and the Falcon consists of the opponent's back two ranks.

Players affect how quickly or slowly the ships move and can trigger pirate raids that may cost their opponents their goods. (Traders of Osaka moves the gameplay to a new continent and era, with players now trying to deliver cargo from Osaka to Edo, but otherwise gameplay remains the same.)<br/><br/>The game has a small board that shows the route the ships will follow, marking safe ports and dangerous waters. The board also has two spaces for the draw pile and discard pile and shows where the Market and Farm cards are laid out. The game also contains a deck of cards that have multiple uses, 48 achievement tokens for when goods are sold, four ship pieces to mark how far the ships have sailed, four trader pieces to indicate a player's scoring pile, four reservation pieces for players to mark cards they wish to purchase or take on a later round and a rulebook.<br/><br/>The game is a set collection game at its core. Players are attempting to collect sets of goods that will allow them to collect cards that will be worth points at the end of the game.<br/><br/>During the game, the cards can be used to represent goods when laid out in front of players, to represent gold to purchase goods when played from their hands or urns which players will use to protect goods from pirates. Deciding how to use the cards and when is the basis of playing the game.<br/><br/>On a player's turn, they can do one of three things: Buy Goods, Get Coins or Reserve a Card.<br/><br/>Buying goods has the player buying cards from the Market. There will be a number of cards laid out, face up, in the Market. Each card has a gold value in the corners and indicates how much a card is worth (either 2, 3 or 5). When a player buys goods, they must buy all the cards in the Market, using cards in hand to pay. If a player cannot afford the whole Market, they cannot do this action. Any cards purchased this way are laid out, face up, in front of the player. These goods are now aboard the ship of the matching color. Then the player moves each matching ship either 1 or 2 spaces towards Carthage (1 space if 1 card of that color was purchased, 2 spaces if 2 or more cards were purchased). If a ship moves onto Carthage, a payout occurs and pirates attack (this will be explained in detail later). If the Market is bought out or if the current player can't take or buy market cards (due to reservation pieces), the cards in the Farm (3 face up cards) are moved to the market. 2 cards are drawn from the draw pile and are added to the Market. Then 3 new cards are drawn for the Farm and are placed face up.<br/><br/>Getting coins has the player taking a single card from the Market and placing it in his hand. That card is now money, its value indicated by the gold value in the corners. This is the only way players can increase the amount of money they have.<br/><br/>Reserving a card has the player placing their Reservation piece on a card in the Market or in the Farm. This card is now unavailable to all other players. The Reservation piece is now committed to that card and can't be taken back until the owning player acquires the reserved card either as money or as a good. The owning player may take the card on his next turn or leave it, assuming there is another legal play he can do.<br/><br/>After taking his turn, the next player takes his action, and so on until the game ends.<br/><br/>If a payout occurs, each player that has goods on that ship takes part. First the players count how many of that colored good they have. Then they look at the value of the goods and determine which has the highest value. They take that value and multiply it by the number of cards in the set, rounding up to the nearest 5 or 10. For example, if a player has 3 yellow goods and the highest value is 3, they would multiply 3 by 3 to get 9, then round up to 10. The player then takes that value and divides by 5. The result indicates how many cards of that set the player keeps. Keeping with the example, the player would divide 10 by 5 to get a result of 2. This means the player keeps 2 out of the 3 cards from the set. Players keep the lowest valued card first and work their way up until they have the reached their limit. These cards are placed face down near the players with their trader piece on the pile, indicating this is their scoring pile. At the end of the game each card in the scoring pile is worth 1 point. This procedure is completed for each ship that reached Carthage. Then those ships are moved back to Alexandria, ready for another voyage. Each player that had a payout then takes 1 achievement token for each color they scored (not each card they scored).<br/><br/>When during a payout, any player that scores and has matching achievement tokens to the scored goods, will add the amount of tokens they have to the highest value card in the set. They then figure out how many cards they keep. For example, if a player has 3 blue cards with the highest value being 5. The player also has two blue tokens. The player would add 2 (for his tokens) to 5 for a value of 7. Then he would multiply 7 by 3, getting 21 and round up to 25. After dividing 25 by 5, the player can keep 5 cards. If a player gets to keep more cards than in the set, as in this example, they keep the entire set and draw cards from the top of the draw pile to make up the difference. These drawn cards are kept face down and are added to the score pile.<br/><br/>After the payout, any ships that are in the two Pirate spaces are attacked. Affected players may now discards cards from their hand to protect their goods on those ships. Each card has either 2, 1 or no urns on them. When you discard a card with 2 urns, two goods of that color are protected from the pirates. For example, if a player has 2 blue goods and discards a blue card with 2 urns, then he may choose which two cards are protected. After all players have finished discarding cards (which is voluntary; players are not required to protect their goods), the attacked ships are moved back to the nearest safe port and may move again towards Carthage.<br/><br/>The game ends once a player has 8 or more Achievement tokens. The winner is the player with the highest score (number of cards in their score pile). If there is a tie, the tiebreaker is the number of Achievement tokens the tied players have. If there is still a tie, then the game ends in a tie.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": {"26883": "English second edition"}, "name": "Traders of Osaka", "playingtime": "30", "boardgamemechanic": {"2013": "Commodity Speculation"}, "age": "12", "usersrated": "2410", "boardgamesubdomain": {"5497": "Strategy Games"}, "average": "6.88525"}, "24828": {"boardgamedesigner": {"3": {"name": "(Uncredited)"}}, "poll": {}, "name": "Flieger greifen an!", "playingtime": "30", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": {"2072": "Dice Rolling"}, "yearpublished": "1940", "usersrated": "1", "maxplayers": "2", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2316196_t.jpg", "average": "4", "statistics": {}, "boardgamepublisher": {"3320": {"name": "(Unknown)"}}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2316196.jpg", "boardgameversion": {"112605": "First edition"}, "maxplaytime": "30", "boardgamecategory": {"1017": {"name": "Dice"}}, "age": "10", "minplaytime": "30", "description": "An old German game, published in the 40s.

He named it Graenaland, a green land. Four years later the first colonists arrived to Greanaland and founded settlements that lasted more than four centuries.<br/><br/>Take the role of one of the jarls leading their clans to the new home. You have to settle the coast and to agree with your neighbors on how to distribute the spare resources the land is giving away. As Eric wants no fights amongst Vikings, any conflicts are solving by voting. You could improve your position in order to gain more votes; however, you can also try to be righteous and to keep good relations with all your neighbors. Cooperating with them, you can fertilize and improve the land easier than when struggling for influence; just keep your position strong enough for the case something goes wrong.<br/><br/>At first glance, it might remind you just another settler-like game &ndash; there are tiles of different terrains, there are villages and other buildings built on the tiles, and there are resources produced to build more of them. However, Graenaland uses these elements by very unusual way, and offers brand new player interaction.<br/><br/>The main difference is that villages produce no resources; the tile produces them. They remain placed next to the tile, until players agree how to distribute them. Every village on the tile gives one vote to its owner, as well as the traveling heroes just visiting the tile &ndash; and you need more than half of the votes total for your proposal how to distribute the resources.<br/><br/>A tile produces only one resource per turn, no matter how many villages of how many players is built on it. Building more villages on the same tile strengthens your position here; however, if another player does the same, you both are spending lots of efforts and resources struggling for still the one resource card. May be it would be wise to live in peace instead. If you are able to come to an agreement, you can take turns taking the resource. You can vote together in the case an intruder appears. You can build some improvements on the tile together, increasing its resource production. You can spread your villages to other tiles and let your hero travel where it is more needed, rather than struggling for influence on this tile.<br/><br/>If you trust each other, you can work much more efficiently. However: does your neighbor deserve your trust? What if he returns with his hero unexpectedly, and confiscates the whole harvest of several turns? What if he builds another village here instead of the improvement he promised? And especially &ndash; what would you do if you get such an opportunity yourself? <br/>The game mechanics &ndash; simultaneous movement of heroes, small anomalies in player roles (one player has special role every turn), and decent randomness and uncertainty in resource harvesting (each terrain produces resources of more types, with different probabilities) lead to enough interesting asymmetric situations, and it is up to you whether you take any advantage you have, or whether you try to appear fair and righteous to the others instead.

Frankel, Play It Again: Asian Games and Pastimes<br/><br/>&quot;The incense game or incense ceremony (k&ocirc;d&ocirc;) probably had its origin in the Heian Period when such aesthetic skills as the identification of fragrances became part of the training of aristocrats.  Gradually, literary themes became associated with certain fragrances.  Sometime in the following Muromachi period (1185-13??), the game evolved into a complicated pastime that required a larger variety of scents than previously used, and accommodated up to ten guests as participants.<br/>  By the early Edo period, the game reached new heights of popularity, probably due to the formalization of the tea ceremony, that also included the burning of incense.  During the eighteenth century, possibly because of a shortage of imported scented woods (k&ocirc;boku), the incense ceremony survived only among the very rich and wealthy merchants who also introduced a modified version of the game and its accoutrement's.  What follows is a description of the typical components of the Incense Game of the very early part of the Edo period (1615-1867).<br/>  The game is customarily played with four fragrances (in the form of pieces of scented wood), three of which are supplied by the host and one by a guest.  The three house scents are each divided into four portions that are placed in individual packets, making a total of twelve packets of house fragrances.  The guest fragrance is put into one packet, making a grand total of thirteen.<br/>  In the preliminary round, the three house fragrances are introduced and identified for the players (the guest fragrance remaining a mystery).  Then the game begins and is played out in ten rounds, during which each of the players attempts to distinguish the four possible scents they are currently being given to identify.<br/>  In the simplest form of the game, the preliminary round begins with the guests or players (usually highly literate people, sensitive to poetry) seated close enough together for the burning incense to be passed among them easily.  The host, who has prepared small pieces of burning charcoal in a larger burner, or k&ocirc;ro, lifts a piece of the red-hot charcoal with the proper tool, and buries it within the lacquered, ash-filled kikik&ocirc;ro (a special metal-lined container for this purpose), leaving over it only a thin covering layer of ash.  The ash is then smoothed and rounded into a cone with a spatula-like tool.<br/>  When the guests appear comfortable, the host opens one packet of the three house fragrances, gives it an identifying name such as &quot;Fragrance One&quot; and then places the perfumed wood on a mica square that is in turn placed on the heated ash.  The burner is then passed around for the guests to acquaint themselves with the fragrance.  Fragrance Two and Fragrance Three are then introduced and identified in the same manner.  After all three pieces of scented wood have been gently sniffed, each is placed on one of a set of plum-blossom-shaped rests provided for this purpose.  Then the game proper begins.<br/>  At this point ten packets of fragrance remain -- nine of house fragrances and one unknown -- and the players will now have to identify them without being told which is which.<br/>  Each player will have been provided with a set of counters or ballots, all of which have that player's identifying token (some tree or flower) on one side, and a possible choice (Fragrance One, Fragrance Two, Fragrance Three, or Unknown Fragrance) on the other.  As each new packet is opened and its contents placed in the burner and then passed around, each player chooses a counter that matches his or her guess about its identity and drops it into a receptacle provided for that purpose.  The burner is passed around again, the fragrances inhaled, and their identities guessed ten times.  Sometimes these actions may be accompanied by the scent or alluding to the floral picture on the player's ballot.  As the closed room quickly fills with lingering odors from previous rounds, the game becomes increasingly more difficult.<br/>  After each round the ballots are examined, and the players' guesses are written by brush on a record board. (Sometimes the ballots are put in an envelope until the game is completed and the guesses registered on the board at that time.) The winner is often awarded the record board.  Depending on the time available and the number of guests, a recess may be called and food served in another area.&quot;<br/><br/>"}, "24883": {"boardgamedesigner": {"3": {"name": "(Uncredited)"}}, "average": "0", "poll": {}, "name": "Sea Rats!", "playingtime": "60", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": {"2072": "Dice Rolling"}, "yearpublished": "2005", "usersrated": "0", "maxplayers": "6", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic139802_t.jpg", "boardgameartist": {"3": "(Uncredited)"}, "statistics": {}, "boardgamepublisher": {"5790": {"name": "Media Firma, Inc."}}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic139802.jpg", "boardgameversion": {"257829": "First Edition"}, "maxplaytime": "60", "boardgamecategory": {"1017": {"name": "Dice"}}, "age": "12", "minplaytime": "60", "description": "As the rules put it &quot;The object o' Sea Rats! is to be the last pirate afloat&quot;.<br/><br/>Each player starts with one ship, six cannonballs, and six crates of supplies used to repair damage.

Now it's up to you to decide: Will you go for the easy points and draw, or go for the big points (and glory) by acting it out?<br/><br/>Each turn you get to choose to act, draw, hum, sculpt, or use letter cubes to get your team to guess the clue. With songs, celebrities, fads, fashions, TV shows, movies, and more, Pop 5 cards include all kinds of fun pop culture clues that span the decades -- and every turn, you get to choose how to get your team to guess!<br/><br/>* Would you act out Iron Chef or draw it?<br/>    * Would you rather hum a Spice Girls song or roll the letter cubes to give clues that start with the letters that come up?<br/>    * Would you choose to sculpt a Chia Pet out of clay or hum the jingle?<br/><br/>"}, "24934": {"boardgamedesigner": {"3": {"name": "(Uncredited)"}}, "poll": {}, "name": "Rancher", "playingtime": "60", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": {"2072": "Dice Rolling"}, "yearpublished": "1979", "usersrated": "12", "boardgamefamily": {"7530": "Animals: Cattle"}, "maxplayers": "4", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2037880_t.jpg", "average": "4.225", "statistics": {}, "boardgamepublisher": {"404": {"name": "Alga"}}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2037880.jpg", "boardgameversion": {"158363": "Alga Swedish Edition"}, "maxplaytime": "60", "boardgamecategory": {"1055": {"name": "American West"}}, "age": "8", "minplaytime": "60", "description": "Players are ranch owners buying and selling cattle.

Also, compared to ACW or WWII, there was a much bigger difference in quality of weapons used by imperialists and natives. Therefore the symbols on the dice are no longer representing the targets but rather the type of ammo/weapon used, whereby the more modern weapons have a better chance of scoring hits than outdated ones (see rules).<br/><br/>Since many colonial games are played in &quot;Darkest Africa&quot;, an (optional) set of &quot;event cards&quot; is added in order to spice up the &quot;adventure&quot; type games. When using the fast play variant, games with 20-30 native units (and about half of that number of imperial forces) can be concluded in 90-120 minutes (ideal for a club night).

They do this by placing a new tile, consisting of one volcano and two other types of landscape. A tile must always touch at least one other tile, when placed at sea level, or be placed on top of at least two other tiles (without any gaps under the land being created), with the volcano being placed on top of an existing volcano.<br/>Next, the player will place one or more wooden buildings; huts, temples or towers. Settlements must always start at the lowest level, by placing a single hut. From there on, existing settlements may expand by placing huts on all hexes of a single type of terrain around the settlement, with temples once the settlement takes up at least three hexes, or with towers, placed at level three or above.<br/><br/>The game ends when all tiles have been placed. At that point, the player who's placed most temples wins. Ties are broken by towers, then huts. Ultimate victory - and an immediate end to the game - waits for the player who manages to place all their buildings of two types. Immediate defeat is also possible, when no buildings can legally be played during a player's turn.<br/><br/>A lot of strategy results from the various placement rules. Volcanoes may never fully destroy a settlement, so single huts can block volcano placement, protecting other settlements. Alternatively, a well placed volcano can split a large settlement in two, creating the opportunity for both to expand more rapidly than a new settlement would. Limiting your opponent's growth potential is at least as important as preparing the terrain for you to expand upon...<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": {"183478": "Ferti multilingual second edition"}, "average": "7.18768", "name": "Taluva", "playingtime": "45", "boardgamemechanic": {"2011": "Modular Board"}, "age": "8", "usersrated": "6148", "boardgamesubdomain": {"4666": "Abstract Games"}, "boardgamefamily": {"5607": "3D Games"}}, "24509": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic181615.jpg", "is_expanded_by": {"32622": {"name": "De Cape & d'\u00c9p\u00e9e: La mission secr\u00e8te"}}, "poll": {}, "boardgamedesigner": {"2805": {"name": "Lutz Stepponat"}}, "statistics": {}, "yearpublished": "2006", "maxplayers": "6", "boardgameartist": {"11886": "Julien Delval"}, "boardgamepublisher": {"267": {"name": "999 Games"}}, "maxplaytime": "30", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic181615_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "30", "boardgamecategory": {"1002": {"name": "Card Game"}}, "boardgamehonor": {"8939": "2007 Fairplay \u00c0 la carte Winner"}, "description": "Description from Spielbox:<br/><br/>Kabale und Hiebe (Cabals and Blows) by Lutz Stepponat is a fast-paced card game in the tradition of Citadels.

Each child gets a colored shoe as well as a matching shoelace. The shoe has holes which have colored edges. Now, the color die comes into play.

If it&rsquo;s a different color, then he has to look carefully: If red was rolled and a free hole is also red, then he gets to thread the lace. If, however, none of the next holes are red, then he gets to give away the color by choosing an opponent who needs the color and can use it to continue threading his lace.
