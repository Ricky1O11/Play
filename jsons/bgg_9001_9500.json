There is often a chance that an expedition will end in utter failure... or, it might land in Tahiti, Fiji, or Oahu.  Clever players might even found Royal Islands to call their own!  Only fate will decide if, and where, sailors make landfall, although careful planning will give players the best odds for ever seeing land again.  The goal of the game is to spread your &quot;tribe&quot; to many different islands in order to gain the most victory points.  Islands have victory point values from 2-5, and having multiple pawns on an island gives no bonus.<br/><br/>This game uses a unique tile design never seen in any other game (hexes with wavy edges), and is easy to explain and easy to enjoy.  Players all begin on the island of Tonga, and immediate overcrowding forces players to search out other islands to populate.  For each expedition that leaves, a new tile is placed, revealing either an island, or a &quot;water path&quot; that may or may not have a number from 2-4, indicating that many different players (not number of boats) must make up that expedition for it to survive the voyage (draw and place an additional tile).  In this way, the game encourages both cooperative and competitive play at the same time.<br/><br/>From the back of the box:<br/><br/>300AD: The Polynesians embark on daring sailing trips and explore thousands of Pacific islands.  Driven by overpopulation and a desire for adventure, they set forth into the unknown on simple catamarans called Tongiakis.  Without any help from navigational instruments, they charted their course with the help of the sun, stars, wind and water temperature.  Birds, reefs, cloud formations, fishes and distinctive waves were the signals telling them that land lay nearby.  Each trip became a life-threatening journey, as landfall was often impossible to achieve or the way home became cut off by strong currents.  Suspense was their constant companion.  Will the next hour, the next day bring them to their goal...  Or will the ocean's currents force them to drift endlessly at sea?<br/><br/>Description from Uberplay's web site:<br/><br/>While originally designed to be somewhat cooperative, it can easily be played 'aggressively' in such a way as to rob other players of points and diminishing their presence on the board. The movement of pieces reaches a point where a 'triggered cascade' can alter the game drastically.

The motorized division SS Das Reich and the 10th Panzer Division were ordered to detach themselves from the outer encirclement line around the forces of the Soviet Western Reserve Fronts and head for Dorochova.  That would halfway to Moscow. Resistance was not expected to be significant.  But already rushing in to block them were all the forces that Stavka could scrape together.  Several tank brigades rolled out of Moscow to slow the German advance.  Cadet schools marched off to throw themselves in the way of the oncoming panzers while from far across Siberia, trains rushed at full steam, all other traffic shunted out of their way, bearing Stavka's ace card, the veteran 32nd Rifle Division from Vladivostok.  Despite subsequent German claims that only mud preserved Moscow from their iron clutches, an examination of the fight for the one all-weather road from Warsaw to Moscow shows a much clearer picture of what really happened.  Here is a clash of titans, two crack German divisions facing one of the best rifle divisions in the Soviet Army.  If your experience from other wargames would lead you to believe tat the panzers will romp, you, like the Germans at Borodino, are in for a big eye-opening experience.<br/><br/>Based on the award winning Black Sea Black Death game system, Borodino '41 uses a map scale of 800 meters (one half mile) per hex, three or four impulses per daily turn, with infantry battalions and tanks and anti-tank guns by company (battery).<br/><br/>The units are played mostly face down, with dummies, to recreate the Fog of War. Combat involves fire, and assault, which are influenced by troop morale, terrain effects, armor support, engineers, and various other specialized units.<br/><br/>Included are some of the best troops of both sides, as well as Soviet reserve infantry, and tanks ranging from Pzkpfw IIIs and IVs, BT-7s, T-26s, T-34s, a few KV-1s, amphibious T-38s-even a T-28 Co without engines!<br/><br/>The game uses an updated version of the Black Sea Black Death system, with relatively little chrome and a high level of excitement.

Winding along the bottom end of the board is a river into which the 34 fish counters (of quarter, half and one pound varieties) are placed. The players start the game from the Fisherman's Arms inn and take turns rolling a standard die to move their pawn across the fields to reach the river. Once at the riverbank, a player can announce he is casting for any fish which is in a direct line (including diagonally) from his pawn. If his die roll is equal to the number of squares between his pawn and the fish, the catch is made and the counter is removed from the board and placed in front of him. Many fish, particular the half pound and one pound types, can only be caught by wading in the river, a process much slower than walking.<br/><br/>Any time a six is thrown on the die, a Hazard card is drawn and the instructions followed.

The Russians appear in the 1805 and 1806 campaigns, with possible Prussian entry against the French in the 1805 scenario. The game includes a 22&rdquo; x 28&rdquo; map, a 400 counter sheet (although there are a number of blank counters) as well the rules (accordion format), and separate sheets for the scenarios and tables. The game system is based on that of the earlier Leipzig game, also by SPI. La Grande Armee has a bit more variety, as three distinct separate campaigns are covered. The composition of the various national armies also varies. The composition of the Austrian army in the 1809 scenario is quite different from that of the Austrian army in the 1805 scenario. This reflects various reforms carried out by the Austrians in the interim between the campaigns. The emphasis of the game is on maneuver, including forced marches, and supply. Dispersion for movement and concentration for combat is a key tactic. The French have a significant advantage in forced marching, as well as in the quality of their leaders.

The deck is shuffled and each player is dealt a hand of five cards. Players take turns discarding cards by matching the most recent discard in color or number. This version includes different characters for each number so that characters could also be matched. A player with one card remaining must yell Uno or draw two cards. Players without a matching card must draw one card from the draw stack. If the drawn card matches, it may be played immediately, otherwise the player's turn ends.

The Attackers are numbered 1 to 5 and each turn a die is rolled - the Attacker with that number may move. The Attackers take two steps each to surround a Beacon, which, when surrounded by three Attackers is destroyed and one of the Attackers teleports to another board to attack the opponents Guardian. You win by either surrounding the opponents Guardian by three Attackers in this manner of moving your Guardian to Home Base. The Guardian can move whenever you roll a 6. Alternately on a roll of 6 you may remove one your opponents Attackers from around one of your Beacons. On 6 you can advance or defend - this is apparently the dilemma.<br/><br/>In this manner you roll dice, move, roll, dice, move until someone wins. The strategy content is literally zero and there seems a reasonable chance the game won't end at all (as it is less likely to roll the numbers needed to advance than to hinder your opponent).<br/><br/>The pieces are elegantly cast out of soft plastic and the board is attractive in a spacey abstract kind of way.<br/><br/>The game was published on the Gold Coast, Queensland, Australia, and was probably never widely circulated in spite of the designers claim:<br/><br/>&quot;Social Championships and World Championships are to be played using the same rules. The rules are: You must declare you are playing for the championship title. The best player over three games only is the champion. If you lose to the champion you cannot challenge again for twelve months, The only way you can challenge before that time is if the champ loses the title to another challenger, you may then challenge that champion. It is advisable not to play for the championship title until you are confident that you have played enough games to learn all strategies involved in winning the game. The longest title held by a champion (as at December 1994) is 23 challenges over 1 year.&quot;<br/><br/>"}, "9110": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic38120.jpg", "poll": {}, "boardgamedesigner": {"353": {"name": "David \"Zeb\" Cook"}}, "statistics": {}, "yearpublished": "1985", "maxplayers": "2", "age": "12", "boardgamepublisher": {"16": {"name": "TSR"}}, "maxplaytime": "120", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic38120_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "120", "boardgamecategory": {"1069": {"name": "Modern Warfare"}}, "description": "The Superpowers at War game presents two hypothetical regimental level campaign scenarios set in West Germany following the hypothetical outbreak of a conflict between NATO and Warsaw Pact countries.<br/><br/>The game is played in a series of double-impulse game turns, during which the initiative (first move, first attack) may pass from player to player.

In fact, I suspect that the game was bound into a collection of Fabulous Furry Freak Brothers comics. The rule sheet looks like I cut it out of a magazine. Frankly, I don't remember. You may speculate as to why that is. The game dates from about 1979 or earlier, I think.<br/><br/>The game is a roll-and-move extravaganza. Your goal is to get the most points or the least points (your choice). If you reach 86 points, you are out of the game (there is a Eurogame-esque point track around the perimeter). Eighty-sixed, get it? Never mind.<br/><br/>You must supply a movement token for each player, a counter for each player's score, and three six-sided dice. Roll three dice on your turn, and move into one of the rooms. Once you have entered a room, you roll the three dice again and refer to a chart for each room that gives you points or lets you draw a card.<br/><br/>There is a stack of cards for each room, so that Fat Freddy's room can be different from Freewheelin' Franklin's Room, and both are different from the Living Room. Very important to the theme of the game.<br/><br/>Sample card from Fat Freddy's room: &quot;You unwittingly puncture Fat Freddy's water bed, sending a torrent of water into the apartment below, and causing a COMPLAINT and giving you FOUR points.&quot;<br/><br/>When three complaints have occurred, a RAID is the result and each player rolls the three dice to reach the exit. Those who do not are busted . It's reminiscent of the mechanic from Escape from Colditz.<br/><br/>There are also three special guests to the party, represented by three special cardboard foldup pawns. The Movie Star, The Famous Author, and the Crashing Bore. You can use leftover movement (once you're in a room) to move these pawns. They block other players.<br/><br/>You can also get three points for loitering in the hallway, which is the kind of thing that proves this was play tested.<br/><br/>Actually, reading the rules now I'm not too sure how it ends or how somebody wins.

All of the game's combat units have been exhaustively researched for technical accuracy (derived from the actual military TO&amp;Es of World War II). The naval and air units have been meticulously recreated as well, reflecting the authentic performance and abilities of these implements of war.<br/><br/>Better yet, Advanced ETO's production model is an exact duplication of the actual production figures from the Second World War, providing players with a genuine simulation of the industrial aspect of World War II in Europe.

For you naval buffs; Advanced ETO now contains absolutely every capital ship that existed during World War II, including additional aircraft carriers, battleships, cruisers and raiders. Advanced ETO even includes numerous naval vessels that were planned but never completed-allowing the players some very interesting &quot;what if&quot; possibilities. If air power is your forte, Advanced ETO includes just about every type of combat air unit that saw action in Europe during World War II. This includes many of the rare types, such as the P-61 &quot;Black Widow,&quot; the Fw 200 &quot;Condor,&quot; Yak-9, Bloch 174, &quot;Defiant&quot; and many, many more.<br/><br/>And that's not all!<br/><br/>Advanced ETO has two new beautiful 23 x 34 inch maps that encompass all of Europe and North Africa-everything from the icy Arctic Ocean to the deserts of the Middle East, including over 38 nations and  territories, newly researched topography, additional cities and ports (such as Dresden, Leeds, Gorki, and even the Azores, just to name a few). Newly added technically accurate rail road lines, updated resource areas, plus additional rivers and lakes. Virtually every aspect of World War II in Europe is here.

For those really stuck with a poor hand, 1 gold will move your caravan one place forward, but only so long as they aren't the leading caravan.<br/><br/><br/>At the end of each turn the active player draws one of five face-up cards or a random card from the draw pile to replenish their hand<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": {"64701": "Eastern European edition"}, "average": "6.17883", "name": "Marco Polo Expedition", "playingtime": "45", "boardgamemechanic": {"2041": "Card Drafting"}, "age": "8", "usersrated": "719", "boardgamesubdomain": {"5499": "Family Games"}, "boardgamefamily": {"6480": "Animals: Camels"}}, "9140": {"boardgamedesigner": {"842": {"name": "Andreas Trieb"}}, "poll": {}, "name": "Affenbande", "playingtime": "20", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": {"2020": "Simultaneous Action Selection"}, "yearpublished": "1988", "usersrated": "11", "boardgamefamily": {"7178": "Animals: Apes / Monkeys"}, "maxplayers": "4", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic78163_t.jpg", "average": "4.63636", "statistics": {}, "boardgamepublisher": {"133": {"name": "Hans im Gl\u00fcck Verlags-GmbH"}}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic78163.jpg", "boardgameversion": {"103023": "Hans im Gl\u00fcck German Edition"}, "maxplaytime": "20", "boardgamecategory": {"1089": {"name": "Animals"}}, "age": "10", "minplaytime": "20", "description": "Each player plays one race of apes, symbolized by a stack of ape cards.

At the beginning of a round everyone receives an ape map and the pertinent ape chips. The fruit markers with dark background are sorted and each player receives the five different fruit sorts. The fruit markers with the bright background are sorted and laid out in piles in the table center. A play round is divided into two phases. In the first phase the players put three apes to different harvest places. These apes are called apes scouts. In the second phase the remaining apes are secretly sent to the places, where already scouts of the own race are. In addition the players take the three different kinds of fruit, at which their apes wait and lay them out next to each other behind reproached hands. At the end, they place their remaining apes against each fruit, if they wish to do so. The next step is remove the hands at the same time and the players put their apes to the appropriate places. Only the player, who has the exclusive majority at a place, can harvest a fruit chip. All other players withdraw their entire apes again. The winner may only take half of the assigned apes to his stack, the others remain at the place. If there is a draw, nobody harvests the fruit. The entire apes move then again to the players back.

I have been selling the games for 2 1/2 years, and have sold well over 600 expansions. So I believe there is justification for presenting them in this forum.)<br/><br/>Dungeons of Peril is the collective name for my first four expansions for Hero Quest, a fantasy board game published by Games Workshop in conjunction with Milton Bradley.<br/><br/>The 4 expansions are:<br/><br/>1) Heroes of the Empire - Play one of 16 new Heroes - Cleric, Warrior-Monk, Mystic, Shapeshifter, Paladin, Halfling Thief, Alchemist, Wood Elf Mage, Vampire Hunter, Rogue, Elf Archer, Weaponmaster, Imperial Ogre, Troll Wizard, Dwarf Ranger, and Shadow Walker. This set includes 16 full-color Hero cards; 24 cards with new spells, equipment, etc. for these Heroes; a reference sheet with new Potions and Items; and a 4-page rulebook.<br/><br/>2) Endless Dungeons - Create a virtually endless number of dungeons with this set. It includes 32 different full-color dungeon tiles, a 10-page rulebook detailing the Special Tiles (with new traps, monsters, etc.), and a double-sided reference sheet. There are 16 standard tiles (4 of each of the following types: Corridor, Small Room, Medium Room, and Large Room), 2 Stairs tiles, and 14 Special Tiles. Use the tiles to create pre-generated dungeons, or create random ones in just a few minutes.<br/><br/>3) Servants of Darkness - This is a set of full-color 3-D stand-ups to use instead of miniatures. The set includes 128 stand-ups - 19 different Heroes, 8 Mercenaries, and 64 different monsters (there are multiple stand-ups for the mercenaries and some monsters). The stand- ups are (roughly) to scale and vary in size, from the standard human size to the very large Dragon and Rock Giant. Also included is a 14-page rulebook for using ALL of the monsters in Heroquest.<br/><br/>4) Perilous Quests &ndash; This expansion provides instructions on how to create and populate an entire dungeon. The rules walk you through how to create the dungeon and how to fill it with monsters, traps, dungeon features (like a Magic Mirror or strange Mould), and special rooms. This is done using two new types of cards (Encounter and Search). You can create an entire dungeon in just a few minutes. The rules are designed to allow as much flexibility as desired when creating a dungeon. The rules can be used for pre-generated quests, but they also allow you to play without a game master and are ideally suited for SOLO play! Finally, the Dungeon Bash rules allow parties of Heroes to go head-to-head!<br/><br/>Perilous Quests includes the following: 20 new Artifact cards, 16 Search cards, 8 Encounter cards, 4 Lich spells, 8 new Chaos spells, 8 Chaos monster cards (4 Sorcerers and 4 Chaos Spawn), 8 Elemental monster cards, and a sheet of dungeon counters (representing various special features).<br/><br/>Expands<br/><br/>    HeroQuest<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>", "minplayers": "1", "boardgameversion": {"248975": "English edition"}, "average": "6.5", "name": "HeroQuest: Dungeons of Peril", "playingtime": "120", "boardgamemechanic": {"2023": "Co-operative Play"}, "age": "10", "boardgameexpansion": {}, "usersrated": "11", "expands": {"699": {"name": "HeroQuest"}}, "boardgamefamily": {"69": "HeroQuest"}}, "9143": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic301195.jpg", "boardgameimplementation": {"2802": "War in Europe"}, "poll": {}, "boardgamedesigner": {"1081": {"name": "Jim Dunnigan"}}, "statistics": {}, "yearpublished": "1999", "maxplayers": "3", "boardgameartist": {"1893": "Joe Youst"}, "boardgamepublisher": {"102": {"name": "Decision Games (I)"}}, "maxplaytime": "360", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic301195_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "360", "boardgamecategory": {"1019": {"name": "Wargame"}}, "description": "(from the back of the box:)<br/><br/>War in Europe is the largest single strategy game ever professionally published. This update of the revered SPI &quot;monster&quot; game is a simulation of World War II at the division/corps level. There are nine 22&quot; x 34&quot; map sections covering an area from the North Cape of Norway to the deserts of Libya and the Middle East and from the British Isles to the city of Stalingrad. Each hex represents 33 kilometers of ground and each Game Turn represents one week of actual time.<br/><br/>War in Europe's most striking feature is the map. Over 25 countries are delineated with their industrial and resource centers, major and minor ports, significant cities, rivers and other fascinating geographic features. All of this has been beautifully rendered using satellite photography and state of the art graphic design techniques.<br/><br/>The rules have been painstakingly updated and many new optional rules and variants are featured along with carefully revised charts and tables. In addition to War in Europe's original 3600 die-cut counters, representing the armed forces of over 20 nations, there are 480 new counters in this updated edition (optional units that might have been assembled to allow exploration of some historical &quot;what ifs?&quot;) . You'll be campaigning with artillery units for all sides, German motorized units, U.S. Marines, additional Soviet Guard Tank and Mechanized units, and more French armored should you decide to build them using the game's fascinating production system.<br/><br/>All sides must manage their own war economies. Players must make choices within certain broad limits what combat units to build. For example, you must choose whether to build relatively expensive strategic units such as Air Points, Airborne capability, U-boats, Strategic Bombers, Naval units, or the more common ground combat units like infantry and armor. The routine of production is executed every four Game Turns (weeks) during a &quot;Strategic Cycle&quot; that also features Reinforcement, the U-boat War, and Strategic Bombing.<br/><br/>Although War in Europe is a big game, its complexity is not high. It can easily be played solitaire, but is most enjoyable with two or three players or teams. Players represent the leadership of the Western Allies (Commonwealth and USA), the German-dominated Axis, or the Soviet Union. Play moves back and forth over the map for nearly six years in the full Campaign Game (or for less time in the numerous scenarios provided), as the fortunes of the Axis Player rise and fall in the face of the increasing Allied and Soviet strength.<br/><br/>War in Europe also features numerous Campaign Scenarios that pick up play at historic watersheds like D-Day or the start of Barbarossa. There are even more abbreviated games in the form of limited historical scenarios using just one to four maps. These dispense with the Strategic cycle in its entirety and simulate the major events of the war, such as the Fall of France, the Invasion of Italy, or the Stalingrad Campaign. Physically, they are much easier to play than a full campaign and are complete games within themselves. Players may also focus on just the Eastern or Western Front for individual scenarios as well as the whole war.<br/><br/>A three-cornered diplomatic situation also arises from the strategic situation. While early on the Allies and Soviets share the common goal of defeating the Axis, as Germany's defeat becomes more certain there is less ground for cooperation and more chance of their alliances falling apart. Victory is determined by the relative territorial stance of the Players at game's end so, ultimately, it's an every-man-for-himself game.<br/><br/>So, it's back, and better than ever. War in Europe is not just for collectors anymore.

The Allied player controls the US Army Forces Far East command and the US Asiatic Fleet. The Japanese player controls the IJA's 14th and 16th Armies and the IJN's 3rd Fleet. The Allied player must disrupt the Japanese advance, inflicting unacceptable losses on his opponent and denying him use of the Philippine ports and airbases for as long as possible.

The Mapsheet has some RED features while the rest are of a BROWN color. The Counters are ORANGE with BLACK print for 8th Army units and GRAY with BLACK/ORANGE print for Axis units, with a few PINK informational markers. The UNIQUE symbols used for the AXIS units is actually what the Wehrmacht used for their &quot;unit types&quot; on their situation maps and vehicles!

Sequence of Play is: 1.Reinforcement Segment; 2.Initial Movement; 3.Combat Segment; 4.Exploitation Movement; 5.Supply Point Index Adjustment and then the second Player repeats these. Optional Rules include Reserve status indication &amp; possible Breakdown of Armor types using a die-roll after Exploitation Movement. Units are back-printed for step losses and allows for Replacements to be incorporated when available. <br/> Overall, this game introduces some aspects used by other companies later on, such as Wehrmacht symbols(used by Avalon Hill in the Longest Day game), single Combat factor printed on the counter and having a &quot;set&quot; movement rate for EACH type, and differing Combat results tables for various combinations of attacks.

A motorcycle consists of a front wheel, an engine and a rear wheel with the gear change. Then the knocking player begins and plays one of his cards. This can be done in four ways. If possible, one can attach another card to the motorcycle; one may also exchange a card of the owned motorcycle and put the exchanged card on the discard pile. And a player might also put a covered card on the discard pile, if he has no more use for it. Apart from that players can play cards against other players to bug other players, if the target player does not have a defense card.<br/>When all cards have been played, players count the points they get for their motorcycles (HP multiplied with the amount of gear shifts(rear tire) and front tire).

The attacker wins, if he has a higher total result than the defender. In the duel with treasure maps the attacker selects a treasure sort, which both players possess. The opponents uncover their treasures, and add the result of a dice throw and the value of the figure. The attacker wins again, if he has a higher total result than the defender. The loser is banished and the figure is again placed in front of the suitable entrance and must be brought back into play from there. <br/>The game is over, when all players possess the six different kinds of treasure. The small treasure cards are uncovered and the individual numerical values of each treasure are multiplied by the numerical value of the small definition cards. The player with the highest sum total wins.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": {"114974": "Fagus edition"}, "age": "12", "name": "Aladdins Erbe", "playingtime": "90", "boardgamemechanic": {"2072": "Dice Rolling"}, "average": "6.4", "usersrated": "10", "boardgamefamily": {"11418": "Characters: Aladdin"}}, "9171": {"boardgamedesigner": {"38018": {"name": "Jon Carper"}}, "poll": {}, "name": "Jades", "playingtime": "90", "minplayers": "1", "boardgamemechanic": {"2072": "Dice Rolling"}, "yearpublished": "1998", "usersrated": "1", "maxplayers": "8", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic38474_t.jpg", "average": "6.5", "statistics": {}, "boardgamepublisher": {"2073": {"name": "Carper Games"}}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic38474.jpg", "maxplaytime": "90", "boardgamecategory": {"1017": {"name": "Dice"}}, "age": "8", "minplaytime": "90", "description": "A Yahtzee&reg;-like game in which players take turns rolling (7) 12-sided dice to score various combinations. &quot;Rough Cuts&quot; on the upper side and &quot;Stones&quot; on the lower.

Two or more players begin with certain bug forces and then, through food acquisition, hive construction and combat, establish their side as dominant on the battlefield.<br/><br/>The book for Bug Strife is 33 pages of typing paper covered with a decently sturdy cardboard cover (monchrome green). Clip art and other cartoons are interspersed in the text and the rules are set out in a logical, well organized manner WITH a working table of contents. The last couple of pages are very useful and welcome play-aids that include a turn sequence summary, bug summary, unit cards and terrain effects table.<br/><br/>In addition to a playing surface you'll need 6-sided dice (d6), tape measures or rulers, pens/pencils, scratch paper, and poker chips or something else to represent food, and any terrain (including nest structures) that you want to put out. Last but not least, you'll need something to represent your bug army--usually the cheap plastic dollar store bug bags.<br/><br/>Bugs are placed in functional groupings based on their shared characteristics for game terms. Players can field colony insects, bees, aphids, beetles, carnivores, flying carnivores, spiders, flying raiders, slugs/snails, worms, caterpillars/grubs. These groupings serve as a common language for players to understand that different models are capable of different things.<br/><br/>Bugs are rated in a number of characteristics. If a statistic is marked &quot;0&quot;, then that bug cannot use that characteristic.<br/><br/>Leadership affects how well a bug can recruit other bugs to join his army (from offboard not the opponent's pieces). Defense and Attack are used during to determine individual combat attacks and represent a bug's ability to defend itself (shells, armor, etc.) and ability to inflict damage on an opponent, respectively. Movement is a straight translation to inches per turn movement allowance. Wounds is the number of hits a bug can endure before being removed from the game and Gathering represents how well a bug collects resources.<br/><br/>There are six phases in a turn.  What a bug does during one or more phases during a turn can limit what it can do in other phases. For example, a bug with raiding skill can do all of the following in a single turn: Raid, Move, Attack and Gather.<br/><br/>Phase 1 is Maintenance/Raiding. This is a logistics phase that requires players to feed their bugs (unfed troops simply leave the battlefield in search of food---never to return).  Bugs capable of raiding can feed themselves, provided there is food available to them.<br/><br/>Phase 2 is Movement. You can move your bugs up to their movement allotment in inches. Some bugs can move faster than others (snails and slugs being the slowest in the game). Terrain affects movement, too so moving across a featureless plain on the gaming board produces faster movement than, say, climbing a hill or moving through leaf litter (jungle).<br/><br/>Phase 3 is Construction. Only bugs with engineering ability may use this skill. Tunnels, caches and hive areas are different constructions that a bug general can have his troops with engineering abilities to construct.<br/><br/>These structures help defend his army and the ever important food supply. Tunnels ease friendly movement and restrict enemy entrance into the nest. Hives grant defenders an advantage during defense of the nest and each hive in a player's control adds a bonus to his ability to recruit new bug enlistees---after all, hives are considered the sign of a successful bug civilization. Caches serve to store food and to aid in defending food from invading bugs. Spiders also have the ability to build traps to catch enemy bugs.<br/><br/>Recruiting is Phase 4, during which bugs with leadership attributes can attempt to add more forces (randomly drawn from the bug collection off table).  Successful dice rolls, with bonuses applied if the recruiter wishes to use food as enticement, allows the player to add additional bugs to his army.<br/><br/>Attack is Phase 5 and usually takes place at close range of 1 inch or less (aphids can squirt acid at up to 6&quot;). Attacking involves an attacker and a defender (duh). Attack bonus equals the defender's Defense score subtracted from the attacker's Attack score (yes, negatives are possible). This bonus is then applied to a 2d6 roll that is compared to a quick table. Results range from no effect, to fleeing, to multiple wounds being dealt out.<br/><br/>Gathering is the last phase of a turn. Bugs capable of gathering simply roll dice equal to this stat.  The result represents the amount of food they have collected for use next turn or storage.<br/><br/>Games may be scenario driven (a sample scenario is provided) or &quot;open&quot; where each player basically does his/her level best to completely wipe out the opponent. Victory objectives such as kill the enemy general or destroy/steal half the enemy food supply are very helpful in focusing the game on more than hack and slash (though those games are fun, too).<br/><br/>Overall, a solid game with a nice logistics phase.  Although the rules are not written for a gameboard per se, Bug Strife would very easily convert to a large hex board or terrain map and in my opinion benefits from playing on this type of pre-measured surface.  It returns the game to a more boardgame like feel and helps minimize measurement fudging and arguments associated with measuring tape errors.<br/><br/>"}, "9181": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic309068.jpg", "poll": {}, "boardgamedesigner": {"335": {"name": "Frank Chadwick"}}, "statistics": {}, "yearpublished": "1980", "maxplayers": "2", "boardgamepublisher": {"181": {"name": "GDW Games"}}, "maxplaytime": "180", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic309068_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "180", "boardgamecategory": {"1047": {"name": "Miniatures"}}, "boardgamehonor": {"23001": "1980 H.G.

The players lay color rows out before themselves using their snail maps. Each player tries to protect  their color rows as quickly as possible, because only those cards score when they are played.<br/><br/>The game consists of 110 cards with different moves for snails on them. Among them are colored snails, Schnarchschnecken, snails cards and turbo-snails. To begin play, all cards are mixed and each player is dealt 5 cards for their hand. In addition 3 sets of snail cards are laid out in the center of the table. (thus again in each case 5 pieces) are laid out. These form the exchange supply.<br/><br/>If a player puts the fifth snail into a color row, this row is protected. Those cards are put aside and are counted as one point per card. Added to his own snail cards,  the player receives a card with  same color numbers as the other players. There is also a wild card color which can be added. That card is is collected by all, is thus particularly lucrative but in  addition it is risky to try and collect  . By means of this pfiffigen mechanism the author achieves a high interaction between the players.

The Byzantine Emperor, Justinian I, has started his reconquest of the Roman Empire, and the game attempts to simulate his endeavor for players to emulate.<br/><br/>One player takes on Justinian's role, the other coordinates the Barbarian faction (basically the non-Byzantines); the designer also said the game can be played solitaire.  The two factions' design are asymmetrical.  Each turn, the Byzantine has to manage its finances, gaining income by taxing its controlled provinces and spending the money to raise and maintain its armies.  Then the Barbarian and Byzantine factions alternate with each other to take actions (one at a time).  They can raise more armies, move the troops, or do nothing.  Whereas the extent of the Byzantine faction's orders are certainties, most of the Barbarian faction's are random; i.e. dice rolls sometimes determine how many armies join the Barbarians and whether these armies join the Byzantines instead.  Both sides conquer territories by moving their armies into the lands.  If two armies meet, combat occurs, which is resolved by dice rolls and cross checking the results with tables.  The game features mutinies, naval actions, and random events.  The latter throws up revolts, removal of generals and plagues.<br/><br/>The game ends after 10 turns or after a second plague has erupted.  The Byzantine faction has to control a certain majority of the empire by that time to win.  The game also ends if the reconquest was accomplished much earlier.  If the Byzantine faction is unable to win when the game ends, the Barbarian faction is the winner.<br/><br/><br/>(from the rulebook:)<br/><br/>JUSTINIAN is a game covering the reconquest of the Roman Empire by Justinian I, Emperor of Eastern Rome (Byzantium).

For that purpose, 23 planes with different colors are included in each box. Each one is depicted after accurate historical documentation.<br/><br/>Wings of War: Famous Aces is the first set of the WWI collection. It includes 5 types of planes: the Spad XIII, Albatros D Va, Sopwith Camel, Fokker Dr1, Sopwith Triplane. Each one was flown by an ace: between them Baracca, von Richtofen, Rickenbacker, Fonck, Olieslagers, Bakers. There are also 4 decks of movement cards, 1 deck of combat cards, rulers, counters and a promo card of the second set, Wings of War: Watch Your Back!, depicting an Austrian two-seater Ufag C.I.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": {"20706": "Dutch edition"}, "boardgameintegration": {"15953": "Wings of War: Burning Drachens"}, "average": "6.87098", "name": "Wings of War: Famous Aces", "playingtime": "30", "boardgamemechanic": {"2689": "Action / Movement Programming"}, "age": "10", "boardgameexpansion": {}, "usersrated": "4402", "boardgameaccessory": {"138416": "Wings of Glory: Game Mat"}, "boardgamesubdomain": {"5496": "Thematic Games"}, "boardgamefamily": {"39022": "Cities: Lugo di Romagna"}}, "9204": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic38648.jpg", "poll": {}, "boardgamedesigner": {"1253": {"name": "John Desch"}}, "statistics": {}, "yearpublished": "2001", "maxplayers": "2", "age": "12", "boardgamepublisher": {"102": {"name": "Decision Games (I)"}}, "maxplaytime": "240", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic38648_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "240", "boardgamecategory": {"1019": {"name": "Wargame"}}, "description": "Cherkassy Pocket: Encirclement at Korsun, In the depths of the winter of 1944, the Soviet Red Army executes a pincer operation against a salient in the German lines near the town of Cherkassy. Prevented from retreat by orders of Adolf Hitler, the German forces soon found themselves pocketed, their only supply source an airfield at the town called Korsun. The Soviets relentlessly tighten their stranglehold against the German troops in the pocket. At the same time, the Germans mount increasingly strong relief efforts against the outer Soviet perimeter. Can the German relief forces break the Soviet lines before the Soviet forces completely destroy the pocketed troops?<br/><br/>Cherkassy Pocket was designed by John Desch, and features a system similar to his games Wave of Terror and Berlin 45. Units are battalions and brigades, and the ground scale is 1.25 miles per hex. Each game turn represents 24 hours, and each player gets to move and perform combat twice in a turn. When it's time to activate friendly units, a player may choose to move first and then fight or vice versa. There are special rules to reflect the failure of Soviet tank maintenance, the use of the Korsun airfield as a supply source, Soviet difficulties in coordinating multi-formation attacks, and the ability for tank units to infiltrate enemy lines. Four scenarios allow you to play different portions of the battle, or to play the whole 23 turn campaign.<br/><br/>Game Scale:<br/>Game Turn: 1 day<br/>Hex: 1.25 miles / 2 kilometers<br/>Units: Battalion to Brigades<br/><br/>Game Inventory:<br/>One 22 x 34&quot; full color map<br/>Three dual-side printed countersheets (540 1/2&quot; counters)<br/>One 16-page Cherkassy Pocket rulebook<br/>Three single-side printed Player Aid Cards<br/>One 6-sided dice<br/><br/>Solitaire Playability: High<br/>Complexity Level: Medium<br/>Players: 2 or more<br/>Playing Time: 4-15 hours<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": {"152982": "First Edition"}, "name": "Cherkassy Pocket: Encirclement at Korsun", "playingtime": "240", "boardgamemechanic": {"2026": "Hex-and-Counter"}, "average": "6.40312", "usersrated": "32", "boardgamesubdomain": {"4664": "Wargames"}, "boardgamefamily": {"11966": "Country: Russia"}}, "9206": {"boardgamedesigner": {"3": {"name": "(Uncredited)"}}, "poll": {}, "name": "Tabula", "playingtime": "20", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": {"2048": "Pattern Building"}, "yearpublished": "1993", "usersrated": "1", "boardgamesubdomain": {"4666": "Abstract Games"}, "maxplayers": "4", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic321264_t.jpg", "average": "5", "statistics": {}, "boardgamepublisher": {"1016": {"name": "Pro Ligno Spielewerkstatt"}}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic321264.jpg", "boardgamefamily": {"22783": "Admin: Better Description Needed!"}, "maxplaytime": "20", "boardgamecategory": {"1009": {"name": "Abstract Strategy"}}, "age": "0", "minplaytime": "20", "description": "Another nice little wooden board game from Pro Ligno.<br/><br/>"}, "9207": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic125110.jpg", "poll": {}, "boardgamedesigner": {"94": {"name": "Reinhold Wittig"}}, "statistics": {}, "yearpublished": "1989", "maxplayers": "2", "boardgameartist": {"39883": "Bernd Skoda"}, "boardgamepublisher": {"402": {"name": "Edition Perlhuhn (G\u00f6ttinger Spiele)"}}, "maxplaytime": "30", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic125110_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "30", "boardgamecategory": {"1009": {"name": "Abstract Strategy"}}, "boardgamehonor": {"19710": "1991 Essener Feder Best Written Rules Winner"}, "description": "You move over the sea and must capture 3 of the 5 islands to win the game.

This epic struggle lasted from 1568 until 1648 and eventually brought independence to Holland and the northern provinces. In the south, the revolt was less successful and Belgium did not emerge as an independent state until after the Napoleonic era.<br/><br/>During the initial stages of the struggle, William of Orange became the symbol of freedom. His main adversary was the Spanish King Philip II, who sent in the Duke of Alba with his formidable conquistadores to stop the rebellion.<br/><br/>Revolution depicts a power struggle with many facets. Each player represents one of the principal factions involved: the Catholics, Habsburgs, Nobility, Burghers and Reformers. Each faction has its particular goals, which are often partly common. Although factions may sometimes co-operate, they are not allies for long and easily turn on each other if the situation calls for this.<br/><br/>Historically, there were periods of open warfare and others of uneasy peace. The reforming factions gradually became more established, particularly in the north and along the coast. The once supreme Habsburg armies were slowly driven out of these areas through a series of siege battles. The defeat of the mighty Armada by a combined Dutch/English fleet in 1588 cost the Spaniards dearly. The Catholics were eventually allowed to retain some of their influence, while the local Nobility, initially catholic but with local sympathies, succeeded or failed according to their willingness to accept the changed circumstances.<br/><br/>This game is not a detailed military re-enactment of the Eighty Years' War. It tries to capture the flavor of these interesting times in a much broader sense. It contains an element of warfare in the form of battles and sieges but the main theme is built on economic, religious and political control. The constantly shifting balance of power, caused by temporary alliances, makes Revolution an immensely challenging game, and not for the faint hearted. Clever and timely use of available resources, including those of foreign sympathizers and allies, is needed to achieve ultimate success.<br/><br/>Revolution: The Dutch Revolt was more than 15 years in the making, and marks Francis Tresham's long-awaited return to the forefront of game design.

Competing companies deal in spices, send ships and colonists into the world, and invest money. Are you on top or at the bottom? It depends on how you invest your profits. Will you make your ships more efficient? Enhance your plantations? Recruit more colonists? Only a steady hand in business will help.<br/><br/>Each turn begins with an auction phase, where each player gets to auction one item (and the starting player two items). The first item being auctioned gives the right to go first the next turn (along with a card that gives an extra action). If you buy your own item, you pay it to the bank. If someone else buys the item you sell, they pay you. Items include plantations complete with crops, income tiles (income in money, ships, plantation refills each turn etc.), ships, settlers, and later on tiles that score points for certain achievements.<br/><br/>After the auction, players get three actions to either improve their technologies or produce things such as spices on plantations, ships, money or build more plantations. Each player has a board showing their advancement for various things: getting ships, planting new spices, getting colonists, etc. The more a player advances along one track, the better one is doing that particular action. The further you get along a certain track, the more points that track is worth at the end, and there are also rewards to the first player who reaches the last two levels along each track. On the other hand, each player normally needs to perform the actions for all the tracks at some point, so it's not necessarily a good idea to concentrate on just a couple of them. Goa is a game that gives plenty of opportunity for tough decisions, since a player always has at least one action too few.<br/><br/>The game mixes an interactive element of the auction, which encourages you to nominate things that other players want so you receive cash with the solitaire management of your plantation, which then interacts later on as players race to be first in the top tech levels.<br/><br/>The 2012 edition of Goa includes four new tiles and a new play variant, as noted on the cover of the Z-Man Games edition.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": {"24598": "Dutch first edition"}, "average": "7.63866", "name": "Goa", "playingtime": "90", "boardgamemechanic": {"2012": "Auction/Bidding"}, "age": "12", "usersrated": "9724", "boardgamesubdomain": {"5497": "Strategy Games"}, "boardgamefamily": {"21622": "Colonial Theme"}}, "9217": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic246360.jpg", "boardgameimplementation": {"156943": "Saint Petersburg (second edition)"}, "is_expanded_by": {"29549": {"name": "Saint Petersburg: New Society & Banquet Expansion"}}, "poll": {}, "boardgamedesigner": {"928": {"name": "Bernd Brunnhofer"}}, "statistics": {}, "yearpublished": "2004", "maxplayers": "4", "boardgameartist": {"74": "Doris Matth\u00e4us"}, "boardgamepublisher": {"267": {"name": "999 Games"}}, "maxplaytime": "60", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic246360_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "45", "boardgamecategory": {"2726": {"name": "Age of Reason"}}, "boardgamehonor": {"19827": "2004 Deutscher Spiele Preis Best Family/Adult Game Winner"}, "description": "On May 16th, 1703, Czar Peter laid the cornerstone for the first building in Saint Petersburg.

The playing pieces in the game represent companies of infantry and cavalry or sections of artillery Each infantry and cavalry unit has one strength point and is equivalent to between 45 and 100 men, depending upon the scenario. Each artillery unit has two strength points and equals two guns. The players of Rebel Yell assume the roles of divisional commanders.<br/><br/>Each game turn is broken down into segments. During an action segment, the units of a particular player may conduct a single action. In the beginning modules these actions are: Move, Fire, Assault, and Rally. During any Small Arms segment, the units of a particular player may only fire.<br/><br/>There are no movement phases, fire phases, etc., as there are in other Civil War games. This absence, in addition to the fact that player segments are structured reciprocally, produces a feel of simultaneity uncommon to other designs.<br/><br/>One of the most difficult problems faced by the Civil War tactician was the &ldquo;problem of approach,&rdquo;&mdash;in other words, how he should maneuver his unit to some objective while keeping his casualties and disorganization at a minimum. A commander who did not pay heed to the destructiveness of &ldquo;modern&rdquo; weaponry would find his formation damaged up to three hundred yards from the enemy. Rebel Yell addresses this problem. Within restrictions, defending units may fire at the enemy as he advances. Like a real-life commander, a player can no longer be certain that when he initiates an advance, his units will reach their objective. Players may find that even one or two companies Standing to Fire will be difficult to dislodge by frontal assault.<br/><br/>Although Rebel Yell is a complex design, it is not out of the reach of the novice gamer. The rules are programmed, allowing small portions to be digested first and getting players into the game quickly. Provisions are made for such factors as infantry line formations (Standing to Maneuver, Standing to Fire, Skirmishers, and Cover), volley effects, leader quality, morale, and regimental flags. The rules for cavalry and artillery are also extensive.<br/><br/>Once players have learned all the rules (or even before), they can design their own scenarios. The game includes six geomorphic maps. Because the maps can be aligned in a variety of ways, the players can recreate a &ldquo;microscopic&rdquo; examination of virtually any Civil War engagement.<br/><br/>Although an excellent multi-player game, Rebel Yell accommodates the solitaire player, Likewise it can be played in a physically limited area.

The more possible directions (eight being the maximum) the card shows, the shorter the maximum move.

When a pawn moves off a movement card, the next movement card may be placed in any vacant space on the board, in any orientation. Thus there is scope for clever placement to limit what your opponent can do. Gradually the board fills up with movement cards which show the possible moves from each square.

However, there can be no set date for the end of the Hoplite. In the Eastern Mediterranean world we have taken the battle of Gaugamela 331 B.C.; in Italy we have taken c. 386 B.C. when at the Allia a Roman Hoplite-style army was defeated by Gauls, signaling the end of Hoplite tactics in Italy; but in Sicily Hoplites still seem to have been dominant till the time of Agathokles (d. 285 B.C.).

So to use this booklet you also need Hoplite Warfare.<br/><br/>The political and military history of this period is set on a great canvas. In the Eastern Mediterranean the armies of great monarchies replace the small wars of Greece, and the Greek cities band together into political leagues in an attempt to match these large kingdoms; while in the West, was Rome&rsquo;s vast struggle against Carthage. Finally Rome faced the Hellenistic kingdoms and the Greek Leagues; those that opposed her, one by one succumbed.<br/><br/>This was one of the great ages of scientific warfare. In the Hellenistic world armies of professional soldiers were led by generals who knew their business, the founders of the great kingdoms being, as it were, schooled by Alexander. Roman generals usually incompetently led soldiers whose length of service made them equally professional. The Carthaginians relied almost totally on professional mercenary soldiers.<br/><br/>Despite initial apprehensions, it was found that the modifications needed to simulate this period were not huge. The changes that have been made are an increase in armor classes to cover more heavily equipped cavalry, some changes to morale to cover the effect of elephants, shooting is modified to cater for the Roman pilum (as is hand&mdash;to&mdash;hand combat), the system for catering with unformed and disorganized troops is changed and the major addition, rules to simulate elephants. The training classes are slightly altered and rules added to simulate cavalry dismounting to fight as infantry &ldquo;taking the Omens&rdquo; is catered for.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": {"192079": "First edition"}, "name": "Hellenistic Warfare", "playingtime": "240", "boardgamemechanic": {"2072": "Dice Rolling"}, "average": "7", "usersrated": "1", "boardgamesubdomain": {"4664": "Wargames"}, "boardgamefamily": {"10640": "Country: Greece"}}, "9262": {"boardgamedesigner": {"3144": {"name": "George H.

Opposing armies deployed in sight of each other, just beyond maximum missile range, and received the sacraments before the engagement began. When &ldquo;infidels&rdquo; fought against them, European Christians displayed a special fervor to conquer all before them. Ironically, there were occasions, such as the sack of Rome in 1084, when commanders dispensed with the sacraments owing to the mixed composition of their armies. Feudal cavalry was the dominant battle winning component for most armies in this period, but its success often relied upon a close sense of coordination with civic militia and archer units, or special elite mercenary men&mdash;at&mdash;arms who formed the base from which the attack sprang. When peasant levies were included in any army, they were placed where they could do the least harm to the enemy or their own allies.<br/><br/>Woods, marshes, rivers, rocky terrain, or ocean fronts sometimes covered an army&rsquo;s flank as an anchor, but most battles took place in the open on a plain or in defense of a dominating height. Western armies rarely employed fancy turning maneuvers, and most battles between similar forces were resolved by direct brute force. Even so, the value of committing the last reserve for the ultimate decision was well appreciated.

One turn equals 5-10 minutes. An army divides into a number of Battles (Divisions), each Battle commanded by a general.<br/><br/>Units contain a number of stands.<br/><br/>MW contains a large amount of research into Army lists: 93 are in the back of the rules, from Late Patrician Roman (mid 5th Century) to Burgundian Ordinance (late 15th century). These are presented in WRG 7th style, with unit name, type, weapons, and purchase points. Four scenarios are also in the rules.<br/><br/>The sequence of play consists of Recovery (Rally phase), placing tactical orders, conducting movement, missile fire, and melee.<br/><br/>For command, a commander receives between 3 and 5 orders, depending on his competence. These can be assigned in the second phase of each turn--you receive a choice of 6 orders (charge, move, hold, defend, retire, and recover). Unlike the random pip system, the number remains a constant each turn, rather than a random number from 1 to 6.<br/><br/>MW contains two kinds of movement: strategic and tactical. Strategic occurs when units are beyond 12&quot; of the enemy--they receive additional movement of between 25% to 100% more, depending on the unit. However, they cannot come closer than 12&quot;. Again, this is similar to march movement in WRG 7th--although a lot more restricted.<br/><br/>Tactical is just that. When you want to close, you must use the slower tactical movement. For example, armored and close order infantry move 4 inches, loose order move 6 inches, and so on.<br/><br/>Terrain can slow your move. When charging and routing, each unit receives a random move amount.<br/><br/>For example, close order armored infantry go 1 inch plus an &quot;averaging&quot; die roll (2-5) for a total of 3-6 inches. Defenders have the option to counter charge.<br/><br/>There are several times during a turn, for example, such as charging and counter charging, when morale tests are necessary. This is a d10 roll, with various modifiers. If you fail by a little, not much happens. Fail by a lot and suffer extreme consequences.<br/><br/>Missile fire is by stand, with a d10 random roll.<br/><br/>Melee uses an &quot;averaging die&quot; (2-5) to which modifiers are added and then multiplied by the number of stands. The resulting number is divided by 10 to get the number of casualties. When a unit receives a number of casualties equal to the number of figures on a stand, the stand is removed.<br/><br/>When you lose 1/3 of your troops, it's morale check time for everyone. And then every time you lose a unit, more morale checks.<br/><br/>The game ends when a general either concedes defeat or all his troops run away or are destroyed.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": {"117550": "First Publication"}, "name": "Medieval Warfare", "playingtime": "120", "boardgamemechanic": {"2072": "Dice Rolling"}, "average": "7.95", "usersrated": "10", "boardgamesubdomain": {"4664": "Wargames"}, "age": "12"}, "9277": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic38636.jpg", "poll": {}, "boardgamedesigner": {"3159": {"name": "Sylvain Ferreira"}}, "statistics": {}, "yearpublished": "2000", "maxplayers": "2", "boardgameartist": {"42958": "Didier Bourgeois"}, "boardgamepublisher": {"540": {"name": "Vae Victis"}}, "maxplaytime": "120", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic38636_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "120", "boardgamecategory": {"2726": {"name": "Age of Reason"}}, "boardgamehonor": {"10940": "2000 Charles S.

Well, Goal Line Stand is &quot;Scrimmage done right.&quot;  This is a game of tactical American football played on a hex grid field with each player represented by an individual counter.<br/><br/>The heart of the game is the movement system, which is complex and, IMHO, realistic.  Player counters can occupy a hex center, a hex side or a hex corner (vertex).  Players spend movement points to move forward (straight or diagonally), backward (ditto), or sideways.  Players can be facing in 1 of 12 directions.  However, not all types of movement and facing are possible at all times - it depends upon where the counter is located (hex center, side or corner), and upon the position played and game situation.  Some movement bonuses are available.<br/><br/>Each player is rated for: mobility, power, blocking, tackling, rushing, running, passing &amp; pass receptions.  Substitutes are available at some positions.  A player may be in 1 of 2 stances: decelerated (as at the snap) or accelerated.  In an accelerated stance, a player can move much farther but has less maneuverability.<br/><br/>There are extensive rules governing illegal movement locations and player contact.  Blocking, tackling &amp; rushing are resolved (after contact) with percentage dice and a variety of die roll modifiers.  Movement after contact differs depending upon success or failure of the attempt.<br/><br/>Fake and real handoffs are possible.  Forward and lateral passing (fake and real) is handled in a realistic (and, again, complex) manner.  Passes may be lobs, lofts or bullets - each is handled in a different way for passing accuracy calculations and the chance of a deflection or interception.<br/><br/>Like Scrimmage, Goal Line Stand ignores the kicking game.  Fumbles and penalties are not accounted for.  Four learning scenarios are provided and, in my experience, are necessary to grasp this unique game system.<br/><br/>The game still suffers from a problem inherent in the concept - moving each player in 1/2 second intervals means it can easily take an evening to play 4 downs (between experienced players).

Each Division is made up of 2 to 6 units; each unit consists of 2 to 8 elements/stands.<br/><br/>Generals are allowed a certain number of order markers per turn which can be used to initiate tactical moves. Units outside a 12 inch command range need two markers to place an order. An element of randomness is introduced at deployment where the quality of the generals are determined by a set of die rolls with better generals being able to issue more orders. Orders available are Charge, Move, Maneuver (i.e. change face or formation), Defend, Retire, and Recover (from disorder or resupply with missiles). Units without orders may not move but can shoot. An order once issued must be executed, even if it puts the unit in a disadvantageous position. Orders apply for one turn.<br/><br/>Movement is either strategic movement (outside 12 inch /30 cm of enemy) or tactical movement (within 12 inches of known enemy). Troops carrying out strategic movement do not need to expend order markers, the assumption being that they are less nervous and more controllable while they are at some distance from the enemy. Some special formations are allowed:<br/><br/>Locked Shields, which confers an advantage in melee at the expense of speed of movement,<br/><br/>Square, which confers morale and close combat bonus but limited movement,<br/><br/>Testudo is similar to square but only available to Romans, who can move faster than a square,<br/><br/>Wedge allows a close combat advantage, and<br/><br/>Echeloned Line, which allows trained infantry to form a refused line while moving as a line.<br/><br/>Morale and cohesion are closely interrelated in AW. As morale deteriorates so does unit cohesion. Cohesion (and hence morale) is reduced through several causes including terrain, combat, interpenetration or failed morale tests. Units test morale by rolling a D10 die, the result being modified by a series of factors. The test isn&rsquo;t a simple pass/fail test. If a unit fails a test the outcome will depend on how badly the test is failed. A failure by 1 less that the required pass score may result in the unit halting disordered, a failure by 2 results in the unit retiring, and so on. Obviously, the higher the morale grade, the more chance a unit will pass its test.<br/><br/>Units can recover from a deteriorated state. A Recover order marker can be issued to the unit during the Order issue phase. Therefore over time a routed unit can be recovered. Given a limited number of orders available to a player each turn, the player will have to decide whether to charge, maneuver, or recovering units during each turn.<br/><br/>Shooting is calculated by whole elements/stands. An element/stand will hit its target if a D10 die achieves a high enough score. The score necessary to hit depends on the range to target, modified by several shooting factors including the target&rsquo;s armor protection.<br/><br/>Close combat is calculated on a unit-by-unit basis. Weapons, enemy armor, morale, number of ranks fighting, number of elements fighting, combat modifiers plus a random die all contribute to melee calculation. Units that suffer greater losses are pushed back 1 inch and are disordered with the winner usually following up. Units will break through morale failure or, indirectly, through accumulated pushbacks.<br/><br/>Losses in combat or shooting will result in figures being marked as lost. When the figures lost equals the number of figures on an element, the element is removed (there are no individual figures removed in AW, figures are removed in whole-element increments only). Therefore two hits will remove a skirmisher element, three hits will remove a loose order element, four a close order element. A unit&rsquo;s morale starts to suffer once it loses elements and each whole element loss through shooting or combats triggers a fresh morale test.<br/><br/>A game ends when a player concedes or his army collapses. Collapse becomes possible when an army loses one third of its units; all remaining units being required to take a morale test. This test is retaken in subsequent turns if a further unit is lost.<br/><br/>"}, "9337": {"boardgamedesigner": {"3": {"name": "(Uncredited)"}}, "poll": {}, "name": "Witchcraft Ritual Kit", "playingtime": "120", "minplayers": "0", "yearpublished": "1974", "usersrated": "7", "boardgamefamily": {"28880": "Witches"}, "maxplayers": "0", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic243273_t.jpg", "average": "4", "statistics": {}, "boardgamepublisher": {"5": {"name": "The Avalon Hill Game Co"}}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic243273.jpg", "boardgameversion": {"107884": "First Edition"}, "maxplaytime": "120", "boardgamecategory": {"1010": {"name": "Fantasy"}}, "age": "16", "minplaytime": "120", "description": "Avalon Hill's trademark for its Psychic Awareness Demonstration Kit.<br/><br/>Produced by AH in 1974, concurrent with the Black Magic Ritual Kit.<br/>Both kits were based on research by Dr. Brooke Hayward Jennings.<br/><br/>"}, "9338": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3653839.jpg", "poll": {}, "boardgamedesigner": {"3191": {"name": "Steve Knoop"}}, "statistics": {}, "yearpublished": "1974", "maxplayers": "2", "boardgamepublisher": {"4": {"name": "(Self-Published)"}}, "maxplaytime": "90", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3653839_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "90", "boardgamecategory": {"2650": {"name": "Aviation / Flight"}}, "description": "A self-published expansion for the Fight in the Skies.

The commissioner&rsquo;s path is tracked, and once they have moved across the map, bidding immediately occurs in the districts the commissioner landed on in that trip.  Players use the bidding cards to bid on a specific lot, and must only use cards of the same color as the lot.  Black cards may be added in to any bid.  The winner can then build their skyscrapers on that lot or declare a building stop.  The player that declares the building stop scores a point for every skyscraper in the district.

The RAVINE hexsides incur a HUGE movement penalty in order to cross them PLUS Zones of Control do NOT extend across them. Overall, a very nice depiction of this Napoleonic Battle resulting from the pursuit of the Russians after the debacle at Eylau in that earlier encounter, and preventing them from linking up in full force, with the Prussians.<br/><br/>"}, "9373": {"boardgamedesigner": {"68324": {"name": "B.

Get involved in the challenge of planning our nation's energy reserves&quot;.<br/><br/>The Game Equipment consists of the following: a mounted Gameboard; a tri-folded Rules sheet; 1-(6)-sided DIE; 60-Ration Cards; 1-Coupon Disbursement Packet; 6-Various COLOR Ration Coupon Cards; 20-Barter Certificates; &amp; $2,140 in various denominations ($10s,$50s,&amp;$100s).<br/><br/>The OBJECT of the Game is to Collect(through buying, selling, bartering, or auctioning), one of EACH of the SAME Color Ration Coupons which are portrayed upon their COLOR Ration Coupon Card. There are various spaces on the gameboard which indicate when a Player can: Collect an amount of Money; Sell, Buy, or Choose a Ration Coupon for some amount of money, BARTER with some other eligible Player, Collect another BARTER Certificate, and on the Supply &amp; Demand spaces-an AUCTION will take place with the Player landing there acting as Auctioneer. There are 2 LARGE Sections of the gameboard designated the &quot;Energy Market Place&quot; and &quot;Coupon Disbursement Center&quot; with a &quot;canceled Ration Coupons&quot; place for when there are less than (6)-Players participating. On each of the COLOR Ration Coupons Cards, there are (3)Sections denoting INDUSTRY, CONSUMER, &amp; GOVERNMENT requirements.      <br/> To Start the Game, each Player chooses a Color Pawn and a COLOR Ration Coupon Card, which DOES NOT have to BE of the SAME Color as their PAWN, and then picks one of the (4) corners of the BOARD to begin from. The Players are NOT allowed to perform any action depicted in the CORNER space they begin IN.  <br/> Before starting the Game, MIX &amp; place ALL 60 Ration Coupons within the Packet. Then PICK someone to be the Treasurer and then 3 Ration Coupons are picked from the Packet and placed FACE-UP in the Energy Market Section of the gameboard. The Players are EACH given $200 and starting with the Treasurer(banker), randomly pick (5) Ration Coupons from the Packet, placing ANY identically corresponding ones on his OWN Ration Coupon Card. This is performed until EACH Player is left with (5) Ration Coupons in their hand.<br/><br/>Then the DIE is rolled by EACH Player with the HIGHEST Rolling Player going first, RE-Rolling the DIE and MOVING in a clockwise direction from where they Started, &amp; then performing any Action as dictated by the space they've landed on. This is performed on every TURN so the ORDER in which Players MOVE and CONDUCT any ACTIONS can be different each TURN. When a Player Lands on the Supply &amp; Demand space, they MUST then Auction ALL (3)Ration Coupons one at a time, in the &quot;Energy Market Place&quot; and can even participate in the Auction, then the next Player can take their Turn. Once the Auctions are completed, then the &quot;Energy Market Place&quot; is replenished with (3)MORE Ration Coupons picked randomly from the Packet. When a Player lands on a Barter space, he is considered to be the &quot;Head Broker&quot; for any Barter offers. Bartering can only be conducted between the &quot;Head Broker&quot; and another Player as long as THAT Player has a Barter Certificate and once concluded, then a Barter Certificate is given up by the BARTERING Player but NOT the &quot;Head Broker&quot;, and placed back with the &quot;Bank&quot;. The &quot;Head Broker&quot; can listen to ALL eligible offers and even REFUSE them if they are insufficient to his desires.

Its main advantages are that it saves the time spent order writing, eliminates disputes of the &ldquo;If you do that, I do this&rdquo; type, simplifies interactions between the two sides, places less strain on players honesty, and largely makes umpires redundant once players know the rules thoroughly. The special sequence of play we have devised eliminates the inherent disadvantages of more primitive alternate move as opposed to alternate play systems.<br/><br/>The more innovatory a set of rules is, the more unfamiliar it is going to be to the players. Please dont write in blaming us for departing from accepted methods; after all it WAS us that invented them. It is possible that in spite of our testing anomalies will start to rear their ugly heads as more and trickier players become involved. If so, they will be cleared up with one of our usual free amendment sheets. We are in any case happy to answer rule queries enclosing a stamped addressed envelope or international reply coupon. Our test games have made us confident that the new system is a winner and will probably become the war-gaming standard. Let us know how you get on.<br/><br/>By adopting alternate play and an apparently simple &ldquo;bang you&rsquo;re dead&rdquo; combat system, we have been able to introduce a little more complexity elsewhere in the rules without overburdening the poor players brain too much. This includes a new method of choosing terrain based on actual battlefields, a command structure incorporating brigades, divisions and if you like corps, consideration of the personalities of individual generals, and a simple but very effective method of discouraging telepathic heroism and ensuring realistic conduct by units, including provision for differing national characteristics. The net effect is to give the player the sort of variety in his games previously provided only by ancient wargaming.<br/><br/>We take the RESEARCH part of our name seriously, and it is because of this that you will find many of the basic assumptions in our former set have been changed. In particular, study of contemporary drill books in the Ministry of Defense library has convinced us that the movement rates specified by us (and universally copied by our competitors) were wildly out. This led to changes in ground and time scale that were ultimately of great benefit to the rules. We must also mention Brigadier B.P. Hughes whose two recent books made an excellent starting point for reconsidering the whole question of weapon lethality under combat conditions.<br/><br/>The extension of our period back to 1685 enables us to take in all Marlborough&rsquo;s battles, starting with Sedgemoor, the Highland rebellions, and the early battles of Frederick the Great, in addition to the Seven Years War, War of American Independence, campaigns in India, French Revolutionary and Napoleonic Wars covered in the previous set. Although at first chary of such an extension, our research discovered no good technical, tactical or organizational reason against it. However, had we gone earlier than 1685 we would have had to contend with half armoured infantry and three quarter armoured cavalry, while to go later than 1845 sees the introduction of the Colt revolver by Texas Rangers in the Mexican War, of the Dreyse breech loading rifle by Prussia against Denmark and of the expanding bullet muzzle loading rifle, together with the replacement of rigid lines by thick skirmish formations, at first unofficial but later recognized by authority.<br/><br/>As for the beginner, do not be overawed by the size of this rule book and its apparent complexity. Start by reading right through it, but remember that all the basics are incorporated in the single thick reminder sheet enclosed, so that you will only need to turn to the main rules when you need fuller explanation. You will find that after a while you can increasingly rely on your memory instead of even the reminder sheet. Try and keep it simple for your first few games, bringing in more troops and more ambitious tactics when you get the feel. The rules are designed so that actual historical tactics will be the ones that work best.<br/><br/>"}, "9391": {"boardgamedesigner": {"3201": {"name": "Bruce Rea Taylor"}}, "poll": {}, "name": "Challenger II", "playingtime": "120", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": {"2072": "Dice Rolling"}, "yearpublished": "1988", "usersrated": "19", "boardgamesubdomain": {"4664": "Wargames"}, "maxplayers": "2", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic39258_t.jpg", "average": "6.55263", "statistics": {}, "boardgamepublisher": {"1716": {"name": "Tabletop Games"}}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic39258.jpg", "boardgameversion": {"106403": "Tabletop Edition"}, "maxplaytime": "120", "boardgamecategory": {"1046": {"name": "Fighting"}}, "age": "12", "minplaytime": "120", "description": "Challenger II: Ultra Modern (miniature) wargames rules<br/>               For battle group level games 1950-1995<br/><br/>These rules I hope balance playability with the complexity of modern warfare and cover the use of most of the weapon systems in use or likely to be used in the next decade.<br/>The sequence of play is designed to give a fully integrated move and fire system between the players and highlights the advantages and disadvantages of Anti-Tank Guided Weapons.

Each armour factor on a vehicle is still 25mm of actual armoured effectiveness at QO slope being taken into account in the thickness, but a 0 factor now represents armour upto about 15mm on light vehicles. The penetration value of weapons is however nearer their true value and a new set of penetration tables and effectiveness charts are used. HESH or HEP are not the super round that it appears in some rules, it has a maximum effective engagement range of 800m, after that you need to start lobbing it using the direct area fire rules. Modern infantry fire stresses volume rather than accuracy and I have therefore considered it a form of area fire and combined it on the same effects table as artillery. In this edition I have also taken the opportunity to reduce the infantry scale to that of a section as was done with the companion Firefly WWII rules.<br/>Helicopters are treated as very fast vehicles and are highly effective but fragile anti-tank vehicles, the full range of their capabilities are covered.

The idea is to enjoy yourself &mdash; do what you will.<br/>The basic concept behind the game is to allow an unspecified number of wargamers (from one upwards) to fight a battle WITH ALL THE WARGAMERS BEING ON THE SAME SIDE (as officers of the U.S. army). Your opponents, the Sioux nation, will look after themselves. The game is ideally suitable for use at a convention where experienced players can teach the rookies (either gamers or the public) the basic rules without any concealed motives &mdash; they&rsquo;re on the same side! Each new command arriving should be allocated to a person picked from the observers, that person taking the name end rank as appropriate to the command. If the character is killed then the player leaves the game. Thus a continually varying client&egrave;le is established.<br/>Alternatively, a small group of wargamers can have a great game. Each takes the name and rank of a number of officers. Any new coming commands are either given to new players (if available) or allocated to one of the existing players.

Battles were fought in deserts and mountains, in good weather and bad, with a wide selection of unit types and equipment, and this era therefore offers the wargamer an opportunity to create practically any type of combat situation he desires.<br/><br/>Those rules will allow the wargamer to simulate both small and large scale actions, which retain a high degree of realism, yet are very playable. They permit the players to easily control the large quantity of units sometimes used when gaming in this scale.<br/><br/>The basic ground scale is 1 inch equals 50 yards, and the basic time scale is 1 turn equals 120 seconds. At this particular ground scale, each unit would represent from 4 to 5 actual units, and you may, of course, play this way. However, it was found that using a 1 for 1 vehicle/unit system works out quite well also. For infantry, one (1) 1/2 inch marker, or 1/2 inch base, with 2 or 3 micro&mdash;scale figures mounted on it, represents a 6 to 10 men squad. When an infantry squad is referred to in these rules, this is what is meant.<br/><br/>The equipment lists in the tables describe most of the common pieces of equipment used during WWII. If you wish to use others, it should be a relatively easy procedure to add them, adjusting their values relative to the other equipment.<br/><br/>When playing a micro-armour wargame, it usually works best when a disinterested third party is used to settle all judgment disputes. This will help the game to move quickly, with a minimum of disruption.<br/><br/>Another recommendation which can enhance realism, and can also make the game easier to control, is to maintain some form of unit integrity. There are many references available which can be used to determine the actual composition of the units in question. As a rule of thumb, you can use the following:<br/>3 to 5 units per platoon<br/>3 to 5 platoons per company<br/>3 to 5 companies par battalion. Other specialized types of units may be attached for a given scenario. As a minimum, it is required that you maintain at least company integrity. The farthest any unit can be away from any other unit in the company is 2 inches.<br/><br/>"}, "9396": {"boardgamedesigner": {"3201": {"name": "Bruce Rea Taylor"}}, "poll": {}, "name": "Fire Fight, Modern skirmish rules", "playingtime": "240", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": {"2072": "Dice Rolling"}, "yearpublished": "1985", "usersrated": "11", "boardgamesubdomain": {"4664": "Wargames"}, "maxplayers": "2", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic39254_t.jpg", "average": "6.18182", "statistics": {}, "boardgamepublisher": {"1716": {"name": "Tabletop Games"}}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic39254.jpg", "boardgameversion": {"106409": "Tabletop Edition"}, "maxplaytime": "240", "boardgamecategory": {"1047": {"name": "Miniatures"}}, "age": "12", "minplaytime": "240", "description": "Fire Fight, Modern Miniature skirmish rules<br/><br/>These are a comprehensive set of rules for small unit actions since 1945.

Despite competition from many would be rival sets, succeeding editions have been used in every important convention worldwide since then, and are used by an overwhelming majority of ancient wargamers. Their mechanisms have become a wargames standard used for every conceivable historical period, including some for which WE consider then unsuitable!<br/><br/>The seventh edition went to the printers in late 1985, and in the seven years since has almost completely taken over from previous editions. Feedback from play by several thousand customers has made it possible to provide free update sheets available in return for a stamped addressed envelope or international reply coupon. A few of the amendments blocked minor loopholes, most clarify meanings and some incorporate goal ideas for improvements suggested and justified by players. All such changes to date are incorporated into the text of this printing of the rule book as Version 7.5.<br/><br/>Seventh was a revolutionary, rather than evolutionary, change from previous editions. It places much more emphasis on realism, the problems of command, terrain and natural conditions, and seeks to distract players from excessive pre&mdash;occupation with weapon and amour differences important only if &ldquo;all things are equal&rdquo;. It is the function of the general to ensure that things are NEVER equal! We also take the view that a putative difference in weapon characteristics that cannot be shown to have influenced tactics in, or the result of, at least one historical battle is likely to be spurious. The tendency sung rule writers to show off their knowledge rather than produce the simplest realistic simulation is natural but unhelpful.<br/><br/>The unanimous conclusion of the users is that seventh is far more realistic than other sets and greatly widens the gap between good and poor tacticians. They applaud the end of the &quot;fire work display&rdquo; with units whizzing off in all directions without getting in each other&rsquo;s way the increased mobility out of and the reduced maneuverability in proximity to the enemy the need to take conditions, terrain and the chance of a surprise into account when planning, the way the fatigue rules force a proper use of reserves, the way rebased troops no longer fall over in the box, and not least, the discomfiture of rule lawyers.<br/><br/>Since its introduction, seventh has been used in the great majority of tournaments around the world, and even passed the fearsome test of the Milton Keynes 36 hour sleepless marathon event. Tournaments normally use the full rules with terrain choice, weather, unusual deployments and unreliable generals without these causing any difficulty or complaint of unfairness. A public demonstration game at Northern Militaire with one player per side each using 3,600 points of 25mm figures on a 6 foot x 4 foot table with plenty of terrain finished with a decisive win in something over two hours. This implies that increased realism has not been achieved at the cost of &ldquo;playability&rdquo;. Gums now play &lsquo;inch quicker.<br/><br/>The major difficulty faced by players transferring from the previous editions is one of imagination. It DOES help to plan as if you wore commanding a real army rather than trying to analyze the rules to deduce goal tactics. Cannon mistakes are to leave cavalry at the rear of a marching column instead of scouting in front, keeping the general safe instead of in a position to see, letting an unreliable general continue disobedience instead of correcting him, ignoring terrain difficulties when deploying, with consequent traffic jams when moving out, accepting waver tests instead of avoiding then like the plague, deploying front and rear lines too close so that they became entangled, and leaving front line units to become exhausted or be overwhelmed instead of reinforcing or withdrawing then in goal tine. Victory with seventh edition goes to the player who has best learned the skills of real historical generals, not he with most grasp of the minutiae of the rules.<br/><br/>Finally, although 7th is simpler than its predecessor and much simpler than its rivals, it is necessarily complex and needs large numbers of figures, a full sized table, and two or mare hours to play. For those occasions for which it will not suit, we recommend our other rule set for the period, the very successful &ldquo;De Bellis Antiquitatis&rdquo;. DBA allows much quicker games with far fewer figures on a 24&rdquo; square terrain, incorporates a campaign systen and army lists, and is especially suitable for beginners, the young, jaded elders, large multi-player gases and odd moments<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "0", "boardgameversion": {"90668": "German second edition"}, "name": "War Games Rules  3000 BC to 1485 AD", "playingtime": "120", "boardgamemechanic": {"2072": "Dice Rolling"}, "age": "12", "boardgameexpansion": {}, "usersrated": "34", "boardgamesubdomain": {"4664": "Wargames"}, "average": "6.08824"}, "9399": {"boardgamedesigner": {"3": {"name": "(Uncredited)"}}, "poll": {}, "name": "Turnabout", "playingtime": "90", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": {"2072": "Dice Rolling"}, "yearpublished": "2001", "usersrated": "9", "maxplayers": "10", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic39322_t.jpg", "average": "4.44444", "statistics": {}, "boardgamepublisher": {"2122": {"name": "Jitterbug Games"}}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic39322.jpg", "boardgameversion": {"156505": "Jitterbug Games edition"}, "maxplaytime": "90", "boardgamecategory": {"1002": {"name": "Card Game"}}, "age": "6", "minplaytime": "20", "description": "Each player starts with 6 cards.

This is partly due to the reduced validity of a strict time scale in tank versus tank engagements where an exchange of fire is normally completed and one tank disabled in 10 to 15 seconds at close range. It also speeds up play, giving a truer flavor of fast moving tank action, and enables you to tell at a glance which party in an exchange shoots first.<br/><br/>Other innovations include a one to one figure scale and an arithmetical instead of a logarithmic ground scale. A model or figure therefore always represents a single tank or man, not a platoon or section, and a millimeter measured on the table always represents one meter.<br/>Metric measures are used because all campaigns were fought with metric maps, even the one inch ordnance survey has a 1,000 metro grid.<br/><br/>Finally, this is the first set of rules we have produced where we can claim relevant personal experience, one of us having served in the Desert and in Western Europe during the Second World War, and the other having been in turn a field engineer, a tank gunner with experience of Churchill and Sherman and later tanks, and an infantryman.<br/><br/>Includes the rule book and a Quick Reference Sheet<br/><br/>"}, "9402": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic163314.jpg", "poll": {}, "boardgamedesigner": {"3204": {"name": "Johannes Odenthal"}}, "statistics": {}, "yearpublished": "2003", "maxplayers": "4", "boardgameartist": {"3204": "Johannes Odenthal"}, "boardgamepublisher": {"51": {"name": "Hasbro"}}, "maxplaytime": "60", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic163314_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "60", "boardgamecategory": {"1017": {"name": "Dice"}}, "description": "Roll the dice and move the spaces.

Also included are a Historical Background and Designer's Notes for full playing enjoyment of this unusual battle of the Vietnam War.<br/><br/>During the closing days of the 1975 North Vietnamese Offensive, four NVA divisions were pitted against a small ARVN force, dug-in astride the rugged hills near Xuan Loc - a town of 30,000 people located along one of the key roads into the capital, Saigon. Advancing in strength down the coastal highway were the NVA 5th, 6th, 7th and 341st Divisions, massed with artillery and T-54 tanks. Defiantly blocking their way were the ARVN 18th Divisions and 3rd Tank Brigade. The battle which followed was unique in many respects for the Vietnam War, involving units of divisional size, devastatingly effective ARVN airpower and sophisticated US-made CBU-55 Cluster Bombs. For nearly 2 weeks, the ARVN held Xuan Loc and counterattacked against impossible odds. It was an engagement describable only as 'heroic and gallant' on the part of the South Vietnamese defenders, being one of the few places where the ARVN, though outnumbered, stood and fought with a tenacity which stunned their opponents. So epic was the stand of the ARVN that the entire South Vietnamese Army, previously routed, grew confident again. News reporters were flown in from around the world to witness the battlefield strewn with NVA corpeses, repelled in assault after assault with heavy losses. Game Rating (Based on independent test group results): Complexity - Moderate, Balance - 50% - 50%, Realism - 7, Excitement - 9, Overall - 6.5, Play Time - 3-4 hours.<br/><br/>The end of the Vietnam War - April 1975. The US have pulled out and the South's armies are crumbling before the North's advance.<br/>The components are functional with a 17&quot; by 12&quot; map and about 100 counters. The map is in 4 colours and shows the area around Xuan Loc including Bien Hoa Airbase. The counters are light green for ARVN and dark green for NVA. each counter is a Regiment or Brigade.<br/>The rules are detailed and cover most aspects of modern war without getting too complicated. Special rules include Leaders, Headquarters, Fortifications, ARVN Desertions, Cluster Bombs etc. <br/>From the Designer's Notes: the game &quot;is truly a slugfest.

To achieve this it was necessary to generalize certain areas for the sake of playability this, whilst not giving absolute realism (which can never be achieved in a game), resulted in a very fast and enjoyable game. The rules are not designed for a single ship v. single ship combat, as it was considered &ldquo;highly unlikely&rdquo; that in any future Warpac/NATO conflict a solitary NATO ship would come across and fight a solitary WarPac warship. The more likely course of events 1s for the WarPac (Soviet) navies to sail (by devious routes) to prearranged rendezvous points several days before hostilities are due to commence. From there the &ldquo;Task Forces&rdquo; prime function would be to disrupt the American reinforcement of Europe; to intercept and destroy the Vital oil cargoes in the Arabian Gulf, off the African coast and in the Indian Ocean; to prevent the transfer of allied warships into and out of the Mediterranean, and to harass the US Pacific Fleet (with the idea of drawing forces from the Atlantic to keep the Pacific Fleet &ldquo;in being&rdquo; to counter any threat in the Pacific) A further option open to the Soviets would be to use the obsolete Kynda class cruisers to bombard US coastal cities with their long range missiles, compelling the US to keep back warships to protect their own coasts.<br/><br/>In any of the above scenarios the Soviets would use their ships &lsquo;en masse&rsquo; to achieve their objectives. It was with those actions in mind that these rules were written, to enable the Wargamer to fight through the Atlantic convoys, to endeavor to keep the oil flowing or to fight for the glory of the revolution and crush the wicked capitalists (even if it costs you your life comrade).

Here, each player has a home territory of 5x5 squares and these areas are separated from one another by a wall or fence. On his turn, the player rolls a special die and uses it to move his equipment pieces toward an enemy HQ. The barriers can be breached by moving a ladder or wire-cutter onto them, or alternatively the passport piece can be moved onto the central checkpoint square to allow other pieces to pass through here. Each type of equipment has a point value (gun = 6, dagger =5, etc). When two opposing pieces occupy the same square, the one with the lower value is removed (both are removed if they are of equal value). Players cannot continue missions with fewer than five pieces of equipment and are forced to return to the outer board to acquire replacements before continuing.

The starting player begins the first fight.<br/><br/>Each fight is contested in one of two elements, either fire or earth, as announced by the starting player of the fight.<br/>During each fight, players take alternate turns to play their cards building up power in their combat and support areas.<br/>Basically, each turn the players play a character card and possibly some additional cards to at least match the total<br/>power of their opponent, who must then in turn match his opponent&rsquo;s power, and so on. &ndash; If a player is unable to do<br/>this, he must retreat from the fight.<br/><br/>A fight ends when one of the players retreats. The other player is the winner of the fight and attracts a number of<br/>dragons. Both players remove all their cards from their combat and support areas and place them onto their face up<br/>discard pile. The retreating player then starts the next fight.<br/><br/>Usually, the game ends when one player runs out of cards and retreats from the last fight.
