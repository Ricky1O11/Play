Each remaining player gets a fifth and final card, then they bet a final time or fold. Those who are still in the game show their hands and the highest ranking hand wins. The rank of hands is quite similar to that of Poker.<br/><br/>Many experts say this game was played in the 16th or 17th century in Persia, hence it is a predecessor of Poker.

A dramatic, card-driven combat system incorporates escalating damage, gives players the opportunity to allocate resources between attack and defense, and brings to bear the unique special powers of each unit type, from fortification-destroying Titans to the perverse daemons of Chaos.<br/><br/>This legendary tale of treachery and heroism is brought to vibrant life with over one hundred magnificent sculpted plastic playing pieces. The stunning three-dimensional map of Terra brilliantly portrays the landscape immediately surrounding the Imperial Palace, from the magma-filled crevasses to the fortifications that offer the Imperial player protection against both enemy assault and orbital bombardments.<br/><br/>Each one of these structures, as well as the Imperial Palace itself, have been expertly sculpted, and rise above the landscape to create a truly immersive experience. The fortifications of Terra have never looked more formidable! Once the board is set up with playing pieces and terrain for your first game, it will be a wonder to behold.<br/><br/>Horus Heresy includes six scenarios that differ in both difficulty and style. The first scenario, titled Brother Against Brother, is recommended for all new players as it provides predetermined starting locations for both player's forces.

It is intended to be played with 1/600 scale miniatures, although conversions to other scales would be relatively straightforward.<br/><br/>Hammerin' Iron 2 is a set of rules designed to covers river conflicts of the American Civil War, 1861 to 1865.<br/><br/>This rules system uses a hex movement system that is described as original to Peter Pig.  This system requires that each ship miniature be placed upon a 5.5&quot; hexagon cutout.  The hexagons are used as a 'floating' hex grid radiating from each ship miniature.  These hexes offer the ease of a hex grid in regulating movement, but since rotations of odd angles (for example, 34 or 52 degrees rotation) are possible, this system is free of the constraints of a traditional grid which would limit ships to 60 degree rotations.<br/><br/>Combat is based on a dice-pool system, in which to-hit modifiers affect the number of dice rolled. Each dice result of 5 or 6 (on a d6) is a potential hit, which is then tested against armor deflection. Potential hits not successfully deflected score hull hits.<br/><br/>A major change in this rules system compared to the first edition is the omission of the ship schematics and crew counters (in which individual crew counters were moved about the ship to allocate crew to various ship functions).  However, if one views Hammerin' Iron 2 as an &quot;expansion&quot; rather than &quot;rewrite&quot;, then one is open to include the crew and schematic rules from 1st edition in the Hammerin' Iron 2 rules.<br/><br/>Equipment (in addition to the rules) required for play include:<br/><br/>     Ship models (1/600 scale preferred)<br/>     approximately 12 hexagons cut from 5.5-inch plastic or cardboard circles<br/>     approximately 16 six-sided dice<br/>     cardstock or felt cutouts to represent sandbars, shallows, shorelines etc<br/>     cotton (white or black) to represent damage to ships<br/>     notepaper and pencil<br/>     order cards (can be cut from rulebook, or alternatively prepared from cardstock)<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>"}, "63578": {"boardgamedesigner": ["(Uncredited)"], "poll": [], "name": "Counties of Britain", "playingtime": "20", "minplayers": "3", "boardgamemechanic": ["Set Collection"], "yearpublished": "0", "usersrated": "1", "maxplayers": "0", "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1074818_t.jpg", "average": "3", "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["John Jaques of London"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1074818.jpg", "boardgameversion": ["Jaques LNER Edition"], "maxplaytime": "20", "boardgamecategory": ["Card Game"], "age": "10", "minplaytime": "20", "description": "Counties of Britain consists of groups of cards representing various counties of Britain.

The aircraft, often flying boats, are sturdy and easily patched up but have few instruments for navigation. Flying is an art, not a science. This is especially so in the still-wild regions of the Dark Continent, Africa.<br/><br/>Darkest of all is the wilderness of Belgian Congo, in the very center of the continent. Belgian colonial rule is very harsh, and traditional practices such as slavery and witchcraft remain rampant. The few airmen who  offer their services in such a place are veterans of the Great War. They navigate Central Africa by following the wide, dark, Congo River, but when night falls the only place to land is on the river itself. And there, in the African continent&rsquo;s true heart of darkness, little has changed in the twenty years since Joseph Conrad wrote his well-known book on the hell-hole that is Belgian Congo. Superstitions rule the tribes that live on or near the river. The greed of the Belgian colonial administration, for ivory, rubber, and copper, surpasses even that of the Zanzibari slavers, feared for their raids among the Congo natives.<br/><br/>But the Dark Continent hides secrets as well. In deepest Congo, a treasure-house from primeval times awaits those who dare seek it out and survive the search. An ancient flying city known as Devapura, built by an unknown civilization, and last recorded in an ancient manuscript seen in the early eighteenth century by Jonathan Swift, who copied the details into a fictitious story about one Lemuel Gulliver, who reportedly saw the city flying in July 1707. Grounded in the heart of Africa for millennia and now inhabited by nameless horrors, will Devapura again rise into the sky?<br/><br/>This monograph consists of a series of linked adventures that bring the investigators on a flying expedition across the Atlantic and along the Congo River into the very heart of the Dark Continent. They race against time, since a rival expedition, led by a sinister, wealthy industrialist bent upon summoning Great Cthulhu himself, already seeks for the ruins of Devapura and the secrets hidden there. But the investigators have one ace up the sleeve: their Curtiss F-5L flying boat can move faster than any river steamer. But only in daytime, and only if they survive the cannibals and other sundry dangers that strike at night.<br/><br/>"}, "63652": {"rpgartist": ["Lee Binding"], "rpgitemversion": ["First Printing", "First Printing PDF Version"], "poll": [], "name": "Doctor Who: Adventures in Time and Space \u2013 The Roleplaying Game (10th Doctor)", "rpghonor": ["2010 ENnies - Product of the Year - Nominee", "2010 Golden Geek RPG of the Year Nominee", "2010 UK Games Expo Best Role-playing Game Winner"], "rpgproducer": ["Angus Abranson", "Dominic McDowall"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic624244.jpg", "usersrated": "53", "rpgsetting": ["Whoniverse"], "rpgdesigner": ["David F.

Exactly what happened and how? Who is the murderer and what was the motive of the crime? The choice is far from easy. Among the twenty suspects are respected citizens of Vileburg. Step by step the detectives follow the murderer's trail, carefully checking each trace, searching out anyone in any way connected with the case. The witnesses (once identified) are ready to testify. Their statements may help or further complicate the process of investigation. In this game everything depends on the deductive skills of the players: no one else will put together all the pieces of the puzzle into one coherent and logical picture.  And even when (and if) the criminal is finally caught (after the exciting chase phase of the game), it&rsquo;s not over yet: the detectives try to deduct the motive of the crime, reconstruct the entire story from the scraps of data they have managed to collect.<br/><br/>"}, "63679": {"rpgartist": ["Ryan Beres", "Kent Burles", "Scott Johnson", "Apollo Okamura", "Ram\u00f3n P\u00e9rez", "Freddie E.

The other players take the role of the forces (The Devil and The Man) trying to get the Drifter to submit to their ownership of his life and soul. At the start of the game, The Devil and The Man control everyone but the Drifter. As the game is played, some people might redeem themselves and leave their control.<br/><br/>A recent player of the game described it as &quot;a very quiet, very powerful experience.&quot; My play of the game has felt the same.

The World Cup Card Game allows players to play through the whole tournament in around 75mins.<br/>The game consists of 65 cards. 32 of these represent all the national teams taking part. Another 32 cards are Action cards which are used to create the scorelines for each match. The final card is a summary list of what the Action cards can be used for.<br/><br/>All the teams are randomly divided between the players. These are kept face-down on the table in front of the player until required.<br/><br/>Each group is played match by match. The players controlling the four teams in Group 1: South Africa, Mexico, Uruguay and France now reveal those Team cards.<br/><br/>Each team card is coloured according to the national football team strip, it also shows the national flag and a note stating their best performance ever achieved in any World Cup tournament. There is also a grey rectangle with the number of cards that team receives in the group stage - this is always 7 or 8. There is also a 2 Goal and 3 Goal symbol, sometimes covered by a cross. Any crossed symbol means that this particular team cannot use that type of card to it's full potential e.g, Argentina have the 3 Goal symbol crossed but the 2 Goal symbol uncrossed, therefore Argentina can only play a 3 Goal card as a 2 Goal card.<br/> The number of cards and the status of the 3 and 2 goal symbols distinguishes the better teams from the lesser teams. Brazil, for example, have 8 cards and no crossed symbols which gives them the maximum options; New Zealand have 7 cards and both symbols are crossed which gives them the fewest options. Despite the small difference between the various teams, the better teams generally have a better chance. However, the differences are not as great as in The World Cup Board Game.<br/>Play continues with the first group games being played in the order on the tournament format in the rules. The first game is South Africa v. Mexico, so each player controlling those teams play from 1 to 4 cards out of that teams' hand. The number of cards should be kept secret until both players have chosen, then they are both revealed. Goals are scored for that team in that match, Defences, Fouls and Offsides can reduce goals whereas Penalties and multiple Attacks add goals. Any spare Attacks and penalties require a card draw from the unused deck to see if they can be turned into goals.<br/><br/>Each match is resolved in the same way. All scores from all games are recorded - best to use the pre-formatted scoresheet on the <a target='_blank' href='http://www.gamesfortheworld.co.uk/Downloads' rel='nofollow'>www.gamesfortheworld.co.uk/Downloads</a> web page.<br/><br/>The KO stages are played differently, more akin to the Board game.

Setup includes randomly placing &quot;island&quot; tiles on spaces designated in the land area. At the beginning of the game, you place one of your 4 windmill pawns in the special starting area indicated in approximately the center of the land area.<br/><br/>The rondel uses a unique method for determining which tiles are available in the inner ring of the market. If you select a seed tile, (cabbage, rapeseed, or tulips) you must place it on an empty space adjacent to one of your windmill pawns. If you choose a windmill tile, you place it on an empty space adjacent to a space already containing a tile. All tiles have a victory point number (some are zero). When you surround a windmill, you total the adjacent tiles and score that amount on the track, if you have at least 2 types of seed amongst the adjacent tiles. If all tiles are of the same type, no points are scored. If all 3 types are present, add 5 points to the total.<br/><br/>If you place a windmill next to one or more island tiles, you flip them over to reveal their type. They may be seeds or a farm. If you reveal a farm, you get a coin which can be used to take an immediate second turn.<br/><br/>When either the supply of windmill tiles or of seed tiles is exhausted, the game will soon end.

Completely revised, CAH:S2 is not just a universal RPG accompanied by genre-appropriate artwork. Every facet of the game was designed to flawlessly emulate the action-adventure cartoons of the 1980s, using &quot;cartoon logic&quot; as the foundation.<br/><br/><br/>Fast and Easy Character Creation: Gone is the massive amount of points-juggling of the first edition. Now, you can create your character in 15 minutes or less, thanks to an intuitive system that doesn't require a multitude of tables and lists to pour over. If you want your character to be good (or bad) at something, jot down what it is and assign a rating to it! That's the bulk of character creation.<br/><br/><br/>Retro-Toon Combat: This is not traditional RPG combat! CAH:S2 takes a more abstract approach in keeping with the source material. Remember, in the cartoons of old, it was more common for the heroes to defeat the villains by trapping, delaying, frustrating or otherwise hindering them than it was for them to do defeat them by inflicting massive damage. This is represented in the game by giving your enemies Setback Tokens. A character that suffers its fourth Setback Token is defeated. For minor fight sequences, you can opt to use the &ldquo;scene-based&rdquo; combat rules, enabling you to determine the results of an entire fight in the matter of seconds.<br/><br/><br/>Series Creation: The rulebook features rules and guidelines for designing your own series to play in or run. After all, there&rsquo;s a big difference between a series about a paramilitary team and a series that focuses on giant transforming robots!<br/><br/>Game Mastering Material Galore: Everything you need to know in order to run CAH:S2 is included in the rulebook, from implementing commercial breaks to setting up a rogues gallery. You&rsquo;ll also find advice for keeping the game in the spirit of the retro-toons; sections include: Cartoon Logic, Cheese &amp; How To Use It, After-Show Messages, Multiple Player Characters, 30-Minute Episodes, The Movie, The Star of the Show, and Cut Scenes.<br/><br/><br/>Featured Series: The rulebook presents three ready-to-play series, spanning close to 45 pages!

Players get to the center by earning points for unique answers to topics listed on game cards.<br/><br/>One player selects a card, chooses one of the three topics listed on the card and then reads the topic aloud to the other players.  The one-minute sand timer starts and players write down as many answers as they can that relate to the chosen topic.  Each unique answer earns one point.  Each point represents a space on the game board.<br/><br/>On the way to the center of the board, there are some positive and some negative places to land.  A player may land on +3 and move three spaces ahead.  Conversely, a player may land on -3 and move three spaces back.  There is also a sad-faced character for players that land on this space, go back to start.<br/><br/>The dynamics of the game always change depending on who plays.  Topics are unique and sometimes have double, triple or more meanings, so creativity really helps.  Infunitum is a fun party game, is excellent as an ice-breaker, and helps people get to know more about other players.<br/><br/>"}, "63838": {"rpgartist": ["Laura Robles", "Ron Thompson"], "rpg": ["Laws of the Wild (1st and 2nd Editions)"], "statistics": [], "name": "Mind's Eye Theatre: Laws of the Wyld West", "rpgdesigner": ["Peter Woodworth"], "rpgproducer": ["Jess Heinig", "Larry Snelly", "Cynthia Summers", "Ron Thompson"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic927498.jpg", "usersrated": "1", "rpgitemversion": ["PDF version", "Softcover Version"], "rpgsetting": ["World of Darkness (cWoD 19th Century)"], "average": "7", "rpgissuearticle": ["Frontier Felines: Pumonca for Wyld West", "MET Preview"], "rpggenre": ["History (American West)", "Horror (Supernatural)"], "rpgpublisher": ["White Wolf Publishing (White Wolf)"], "rpgcategory": ["Core Rules (min needed to play)"], "poll": [], "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic927498_t.jpg", "description": "From the Back of the Book:<br/><br/>Strap On Your Six-Guns, Pardner<br/>The range is bigger 'n' wilder than any city back east.

Machado&rsquo;s two Spain's fought each other for nearly three years in a battle which reflected the political and social tensions affecting the world at that time.<br/><br/>The opposing armies were very different: on one hand, the Republican army possessed a limited number of professional soldiers and many popular militias belonging to political parties and labor unions. To this were added the International Brigades, formed from foreign volunteers of diverse origin; a fighting force which was highly motivated, but poorly coordinated and typically poorly organized. On the other hand, the Franco&acute;s army had most of the professional military, along with Carlist and fascist militias, many native Moroccan troops, and the volunteers of the Condor Legion and the Corpo Trupe Voluntarie, sent by Hitler and Mussolini, respectively.<br/><br/>From a military point of view, the Spanish Civil War presaged the global conflict which would soon erupt. In the mid-1930s, military high commands from all over the globe theorized on the possibilities of motorized armies and &ldquo;lightning war&rdquo;. Both Nazis and Soviets rehearsed armored tactics in Spain, and tested various types of weapons. In addition, the importance that air superiority would have on all later conflicts was made clear. All of these elements make the Spanish Civil War a fascinating conflict from an historical point of view and with regard to military strategy.<br/><br/>A las Barricadas!

It belongs to the Morris family. Like other games from that family, its origins date back to antiquity. The game is played by nomadic shepherds and city dwellers where a class of professional players has emerged.<br/><br/>Shax is played on the same board as Nine Men's Morris, but with twelve pieces for each player. Play consists of two phases: the setup phase and the movement phase. In the setup phase, players take turns putting one piece on the board. Unlike in Nine Men's Morris, no pieces are removed when a jare (three-in-a-row, mill, literally: &quot;cut&quot;) is formed during the setup. It is only noted who formed the first jare.<br/><br/>In the movement phase, the player who formed the first jare moves first (if no jare was formed in the setup phase, the second player starts). He does so by removing one arbitrary piece of the opponent in order to create space for movement. The opponent does the same. Then players take turns moving their stones as in the other Morris games.<br/><br/>If a jare is formed in the movement phase, the player removes a piece of the opponent. Note that - again unlike other Morris games - pieces in a jare are never protected against capture. Another important difference is that blocking does not constitute a win. If a player is locked in, he may demand that the opponent moves his stones until the blockade is removed. No advantage may be taken from these extra moves. In particular, if a jare is formed during these moves, then no capture is performed. There is no &quot;flying phase&quot; when a player is reduced to three pieces or less. The player who loses all his pieces loses the game.<br/><br/>Numerous references to Shax exist in proverbs and Somalian literature. Favorable patterns of stones have got their own names.<br/><br/>"}, "63877": {"rpgartist": ["David Cummings", "Derek Hand", "Rick Hershey", "Craig Petersen", "Samuel Santos", "Michael Syrigos", "Kurt Taylor", "Aleksander Vjestica"], "rpgitemversion": ["PDF Version", "Softcover Version"], "poll": [], "name": "Exodus Post-Apocalyptic RPG Survivor's Guide", "rpgdesigner": ["Cary Martin", "Jason Mical", "Grzegorz Ocetek", "John E.

If those aren't admirable traits, I don't know what would be.<br/><br/>&quot;Magical World is what came out of this paradoxical perspective on magical girls. It puts them into a world of high stakes and dire consequences where, as in the real world, power can be used selfishly as surely as it can be used to help others. Some hate them, some worship them, some ignore them, and a few hunt them down. It is a place where magical girls and their youma foes are ubiquitous, and a world that truly both loves and hates them. Whatever you feel about magical girls, it can happen here.<br/><br/>&quot;Magical girls come in countless varieties; saccharine heroines, servants of darkness, hired killers, idol singers, vigilantes and more. They can save the world or bring it damnation. The choice is yours. Strap in, have your henshin wand handy, and get ready for a bumpy ride.&quot;<br/><br/>Magical World used &quot;rules modules&quot; to adapt the setting to different systems.  More were planned, but were never written.<br/><br/>"}, "63912": {"image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2297558.jpg", "poll": [], "boardgamedesigner": ["Nate French", "Eric M.

From the opening:<br/><br/>&quot;Kimagure Orange Road is popular comic and animated TV series from Japan written by a very talented Japanese artist named Izumi Matsumoto.  The story focuses on the Kasuga clan, an ancient family line with rare esper powers (referred to here as &quot;Cho-no Ryoku&quot; powers, which translates simply as &quot;super natural powers&quot;), living in Japan, and on a love triangle between the main character, Kyosuke Kasuga, a cute but irritating girl named Hikaru Hiyama and the beautiful and enigmatic Madoka Ayukawa.  I liked the universe, liked the way the powers were set up, and decided to make an RPG system and try it out on my friends. And now you can too!<br/><br/>&quot;This is a role-playing game.  It requires one person to be the Game Master (GM) and some 10 sided dice.  Also, you'll need some paper, pencils, junk food, xeroxes of the character sheets at the end of this file, and, oh yes, maybe people who care to play -- at least 2 players, but not more than 56.  Players generally assume the roles of &quot;new&quot; relatives, distant cousins of Kyosuke's branch of the family, etc., who were never in the series.  Players will have random esper powers and various stats to help define their character's abilities and goals.&quot;<br/><br/>User summary:<br/>Characters are family members of the esper clan, with a recommended age of 15-17. Characters can be male or female, but in order to play a male character, you have to roll for it (50/50 chance on a d10); you can choose to be female (presumably to have a higher concentration of female characters, as in the manga/anime).<br/><br/>There are three abilities in the game: Fighting (for combat), Smarts, and Dai-suki (looks/charisma/appeal). You roll 1d10 for each skill, but are allowed to re-roll 1s and 2s. From this base level, you can add up to 10 additional points among all 3 abilities. No ability can go past 15, which is god-like.<br/><br/>After setting your abilities, you roll percentage dice 3 times on a table to be assigned personality traits, special abilities, backgrounds, and so on. Some traits can only be kept by certain sexes. These traits can affect ability scores. Some traits give more rolls on the traits table.<br/><br/>Characters also have other skills: English, Sports, Driving, Kakko (style), Virginity, and Swimming. These range from 1-10, or have yes/no/sort-of values. There is a formula involving a d10 die roll and particular abilities or traits.<br/><br/>Characters in the game have their own personal goals, in addition to the goals of the adventure, creating interesting conflicts. Sometimes these goals come from traits, sometimes they are assigned by the GM.<br/><br/>There are hit points in the game, from 5-17 depending upon bonuses. If a player reaches 0, they are &quot;beaten up&quot;. Combat is not the main focus of the game.<br/><br/>Characters have Power Points, for esper powers, ranging from 7-11 points. Powers cost a fixed amount per use. Characters have 1 primary power and three or more secondary powers.<br/><br/>"}, "63917": {"rpgartist": ["Brent Chumley", "Richard Spake"], "rpgitemversion": ["PDF version", "Trade Paperback"], "poll": [], "name": "Eric Flint's 1632 Role Playing Game and Resource Guide", "rpgdesigner": ["Jonathan B.

The citizens may still vote to convict criminals, but the Detective has his trusty sidearm and can shoot citizens at will!

The game uses a simplified version of the D-Day at Omaha Beach system.<br/><br/><br/><br/>(from Publisher website :)Operation Jubilee: Dieppe, August 1942 (OJ) is a purpose-designed solitaire game, by John Butterfield, simulating the disastrous Commonwealth raid against the German-held French port of Dieppe on 19 August 1942. It uses an evolution of his well-liked system from our earlier boxed game release: D-Day on Omaha Beach.<br/>Historically, a mixed force of Canadian troops and tanks and British Commandos landed on several beaches along a 16-mile stretch of coast, with a variety of objectives. While the commando raids on the flanks met with some success, the major action against Dieppe was a costly failure. It didn&rsquo;t come close to achieving its objectives, and over 75 percent of that landing force were killed or captured. You control the CW forces assaulting the beaches and struggling to achieve their objectives against intense German resistance. The game system controls the German forces that oppose you.<br/><br/>The overall 34x22&rdquo; large-hex map, which is cut in half and reassembled into a 17&quot;x42&quot; play area, consists of three sector maps: the main map showing the French port of Dieppe and surrounding areas, and two smaller maps portraying coastal areas east and west of the main map. The main map is divided into four areas: Blue Beach, Dieppe town, Green Beach and Rear. Each hex represents 400 meters (438 yards) across; each game turn equals 20 minutes. Units of maneuver are companies and batteries; there are 176 large-size NATO-style and iconic counters in the mix.<br/> Rules cover such things as: coastal battery fire, random events, unit depth, command-control and communication, air attack, &ldquo;what if&rdquo; variants, amphibious warfare and much more. The game can be completed in about three to four hours. The turn sequence is as follows.<br/><br/>I. CW Amphibious Transport Phase<br/>1. Unit Transport<br/>2. Landing Check<br/>II.

In the last hour of that age, a new story begins. Will it be the story of a hero, rising up to save what is good and true about the old age to shepherd it into the new, or will it be a sad lament for things long gone to usher in a new age of darkness?

The game weaves together the creative contributions of each individual player in a structured plot arc and then helps you play through a chapter-by-chapter account of how your characters face adversity, similar to the way an author starts with an outline and fleshes it out into a full novel. By breaking up the creative responsibility and providing creative constraints to guide players&rsquo; contributions, Final Hour of a Storied Age lets everyone experience an epic fantasy story without asking anyone to shoulder an epic creative burden.<br/><br/>"}, "63935": {"rpgdesigner": ["Eytan Bernstein"], "rpgitemversion": ["PDF Version"], "poll": [], "name": "17 Magic Hats and Helmets", "rpgartist": ["The Le'"], "rpggenre": ["Fantasy (High Fantasy)"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic861964.jpg", "usersrated": "0", "rpgproducer": ["The Le'"], "statistics": [], "rpg": ["d20 System / OGL Product (D&D 3.5 Compatible)"], "rpgpublisher": ["The Le Games"], "average": "0", "rpgcategory": ["Sourcebook (rules/options to enhance play)"], "rpgseries": ["17"], "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic861964_t.jpg", "description": "From the Le Games website -<br/><br/>17 Magic Hats &amp; Helmets is the latest book in our &quot;17&quot; series, and this one is going to make your head spin (in a good way).

Combining large-scale map movement with a fast-play set of tactical rules, the game lets players follow a convoy from embarkation to destination in a single play session.<br/><br/>In the &quot;map game&quot;, convoys move in eight-hour operational turns, rolling for engagements with U-boats, blockade runners, raiders, and even weather. A large-scale map and tables generate one or more events each turn. Some events are resolved immediately with a few die rolls. Others, such as attacjs by U-boats or raiders are resolved with the fast-play tactical rules.<br/><br/>The Battle of the Atlantic is broken down into several areas and periods, each covered in a seperate map/game module. Deadly Waters is the first such module, covering the Gibraltar Run from January 1941 through December 1942. Each module includes a CD-ROM with full-color damage cards for all the ships and subs needed for convoy battles in that period.<br/><br/>Convoy will be supported by other map games currently under development. These cover other parts of the Battle of the Atlantic as well as the desperate Murmansk/Soviet lifeline. Designed by Mal Wright, the game system incorporates Mal's thorough research of published sources including interviews with veterans from both sides of the conflict, and illustrates the operational realities of the Battle of the Atlantic.<br/><br/>Both the map game booklets and tactical rules emphasize simplicity and fast play.
