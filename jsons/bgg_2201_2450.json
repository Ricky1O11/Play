Recently, it has also come out with two expansions which were released in tins: Faith of our Fathers (FooF) and Rock of Ages (RoA).<br/><br/>At its core, the gameplay is simple: use your Heroes to rescue Lost Souls from your opponent's Land of Bondage, and use your Evil Characters to defend your own Lost Souls from your opponent.  Enhancements may be played on these characters in turn to affect the final outcome of the battle.  The characters and enhancements are divided up into colored &quot;brigades&quot; to emphasize theme and maintain variety and balance.  The depth of gameplay is expanded with various support cards, such as Sites, Fortresses and Artifacts.  Dominant cards may also be played by anybody at any time, and can turn the game around in an instant.<br/><br/>Redemption is unique among its CCG counterparts in several ways.  The cards are based on characters, locations and events from the Bible.  So while no particular tradition or &quot;brand&quot; of Christianity is emphasized over another, this source material provides a solid theme for the game.  Accordingly, many of the cards and their effects bear a historical or thematic parallel to their corresponding Scripture, making Redemption an effective learning tool as well.<br/><br/>Also, while variety and depth of strategy are key factors in developing new expansions, the chance elements of the card draw and Dominant card play are never fully mitigated, allowing younger or less skilled players something of an equalizer.  This is consistent with designer Rob Anderson's philosophy that the emphasis be placed on fun and fellowship over pure competition.  It is also for this reason that, while tournaments are held regularly, with prizes and ranking points awarded to players who place, those prizes are rather modest compared to those offered by Magic: The Gathering or Pok\u00e9mon Trading Card Game.<br/><br/>"}, "2202": {"boardgamedesigner": {"3": {"name": "(Uncredited)"}}, "poll": {}, "name": "Swahili", "playingtime": "30", "minplayers": "2", "yearpublished": "1968", "usersrated": "21", "boardgamefamily": {"5607": "3D Games"}, "maxplayers": "4", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic481070_t.jpg", "average": "5.94762", "statistics": {}, "boardgamesubdomain": {"4666": "Abstract Games"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic481070.jpg", "boardgameversion": {"335342": "English 'Thick Corners' edition"}, "maxplaytime": "30", "boardgamepublisher": {"20": {"name": "Milton Bradley"}}, "boardgamecategory": {"1009": {"name": "Abstract Strategy"}}, "age": "8", "minplaytime": "30", "description": "This is a pretty straight forward adaption of Mancala.

Players move one piece per turn and can eliminate the other player's pieces by moving into their space. Movement options depend on which piece it is you're moving. In a fit of conspicuous difference, it's the black side who makes the opening move here.<br/><br/>The central gimmick is that each piece is composed of two parts, a body and a head. The height of the body determines how far a piece can move (one, two or three spaces), whereas the head determines the directions: straight lines (like rooks), diagonals (like bishops), or both (like kings or queens). Each side also has one super-powered queen/rook hybrid which can move to any space within the range determined by its body, and even one unbeatable but immobile head.<br/><br/>There's a reason for all this separation into bodies and heads: after every move the piece which just moved must swap heads with a different type of head, chosen by the player from their pieces still in play.<br/><br/>There are two victory conditions: either you move one of your pieces to a specific target square on the far side of the board, or you force your opponent to make an illegal move. Draws are possible, but rare (they require both sides' forces to be extremely depleted).<br/><br/>The theme is pretty much irrelevant - this is an abstract at heart. The rulebook frames the game as the secret strategy-honing tool of the nobles in a fictional culture, and the rules introduction is presented in dialogue form with the Wise Old Master teaching the game to his Young Noble Student, but none of this is at all relevant to gameplay. In fact, the game presented within the fiction is themeless and, quite literally, abstract: the pieces' names are translated as abstract concepts like 'strength' etc.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": {"115812": "Edition Perlhuhn edition"}, "age": "10", "name": "Ayanu", "playingtime": "30", "average": "7.0697", "usersrated": "33", "boardgamesubdomain": {"4666": "Abstract Games"}, "boardgamefamily": {"26432": "Combinatorial"}}, "2231": {"boardgamedesigner": {"904": {"name": "Claude Soucie"}}, "poll": {}, "name": "Watch", "playingtime": "10", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": {"2046": "Area Movement"}, "yearpublished": "1967", "usersrated": "21", "boardgamesubdomain": {"4666": "Abstract Games"}, "maxplayers": "2", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic44479_t.jpg", "average": "6.02381", "statistics": {}, "boardgamepublisher": {"29": {"name": "ABACUSSPIELE"}}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic44479.jpg", "boardgameversion": {"90054": "Campaign Game Company Travel Edition"}, "maxplaytime": "10", "boardgamecategory": {"1009": {"name": "Abstract Strategy"}}, "age": "6", "minplaytime": "10", "description": "Watch, a.k.a.

It employs a scale of 300 meters per hex, with daily turns and 2160 counters.<br/><br/>The most luscious wargame ever produced (OK no more editorializing). This game has possibly sunk more companies than Hasbro. The two designers spent years researching the orders of battle and aerial maps to produce a game that is possibly the most researched and arguably the most accurate depiction of a battle, mechanics aside.<br/><br/>The large, fairly thin but sturdy counters are the shades of the uniforms of the armies according to the designers. Instead of the usual American style designations on the counters to depict what type of unit it is the designers used the actual designators used by the separate armies. This could be confusing except for the wonderful large player aids supplied with actual photos of the unit types. Labels and ziplock bag are even supplied for sorting purposes although sorting can be confusing. Moves mag put out an issue in the late '70's, early '80's with an article that fixed the problem.<br/><br/>The 3 large maps are taken straight from aerial photos. You see the city block by block and outside the city individual buildings can even be seen. There is very little color on the maps but they are beautiful and very functional. The terrain effects chart once again has actual photos of the terrain so you can get an idea of exactly what the soldiers were facing.<br/><br/>There are many scenarios available so you can tailor the game for time and room as some only use 1 map or a portion of a map. Each scenario has a separate set up sheet for both sides that are large enough to put all the counters on the sheets. Each scenario has a miniature version of the map to be used with set up information. For a monster game it is very easy to set up and get into a game.<br/><br/>There are 3 rulebooks included, 2 basic game and 1 advanced game. When learning the game it is fantastic that they included a rulebook for each player. This is the kind of detail that is evident throughout the game. The rule books are detailed without being overbearing, as a lot of Avalon Hill's and SPI's were from the time period. They are chock full of examples to clear up ambiguities.<br/><br/>The game is difficult because of the scale only. It is actually a fairly simple game, mechanics wise, and can be played by anyone with some wargame experience. This game shows that it has been designed to play, by wargamers, in every detail.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": {"109635": "First Edition"}, "average": "7.4117", "name": "Streets of Stalingrad", "playingtime": "180", "boardgamemechanic": {"2026": "Hex-and-Counter"}, "age": "12", "usersrated": "47", "boardgamesubdomain": {"4664": "Wargames"}, "boardgamefamily": {"11966": "Country: Russia"}}, "2237": {"boardgamedesigner": {"934": {"name": "Marco Maggi"}}, "poll": {}, "name": "Flying Circus", "playingtime": "20", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": {"2009": "Trick-taking"}, "yearpublished": "2001", "usersrated": "14", "maxplayers": "6", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic5754_t.jpg", "average": "5.53571", "statistics": {}, "boardgamepublisher": {"485": {"name": "Dal Negro"}}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic5754.jpg", "boardgameversion": {"185576": "Dal Negro edition"}, "maxplaytime": "20", "boardgamecategory": {"2650": {"name": "Aviation / Flight"}}, "age": "10", "minplaytime": "20", "description": "Use manouver cards from your hand trying to achieve a better total than your opponents.

Players will recreate the first six months of furious aerial combat between the might of Imperial Japan and the surprised forces of the United Kingdom and the United States.<br/><br/>Zero! includes the important early-war fighters and bomber of the Imperial Japanese Navy and Army, Royal Air Force, United States Navy, United States Army Air Force, and the American Volunteer Group (the famous Flying Tigers). Fly the fearsome A6M2 Zero against the F4F Wildcat, Hawker Hurricane IIb, Curtiss P-40B and E Tomahawks, and the ill-fated Brewster Buffalo. As a pilot with the Japanese Army, take Ki-27 Nates and Ki-43 Oscars to the skies against the Allies over Malaya and Burma. Match your skills with American aces Wagner, Thach, McCuskey or their semi-mercenary countrymen of the AVG, Hill and Newkirk. The Japanese can counter with Sakai, Anabuki, Kato, and more.<br/><br/>As with the previous games in the series, Zero! includes the Campaigns covering the major aerial events of the December 1941 to June 1942 period. Each consists of multiple missions aimed at a variety of targets, for which you must wisely allocate your resources of men and material. New to Zero! are Carrier Campaigns, which give players some control over the carrier groups their naval squadrons fly from. Do you go all out for a decisive strike or hold your fighters back and let the enemy overextend himself? Campaigns included in this volume are: Pearl Harbor (solitaire), the Philippines, Malaya, Burma, Coral Sea, and Midway.<br/><br/>Both Down in Flames veterans and newcomers to the series will enjoy this latest volume. All the components needed to play are included - ownership of the first two volumes is not necessary, but the three games are completely compatible. Beautiful, newly-designed, full-color action cards drive gameplay, while cards representing the major aircraft of the period and counters of the famous aces allow players to explore a wide range of scenarios. Besides the new Carrier Campaigns, historically significant missions have been added to the standard campaigns and the rules have been updated and expanded.<br/><br/>Are you ready to relive history? Can you sweep the skies in the cockpit of the Zero, delaying or even stopping the appearance of American industrial might?

Winning Moves Games currently (2015) holds trademark for and publishes Touring.  If the mechanics sound familiar, it is the inspiration for the game Mille Bornes, which has since replaced it.<br/><br/>As driving technology improved, mileage and card names became outdated, thus replaced with longer distaances.

There is a card deck associated with each of these 3 ingredients:  a malt deck, a hops deck and a water deck.  Players have a limited amount of money to purchase ingredients for their beer.  Ingredients in each deck are valued from 1 (worst ingredients) to 6 (best ingredients).  The decks are shuffled separately and the 3 decks are placed face down in the table.  The top card of each deck is turned over.  In turn, each player may buy any of the 3 ingredients with their money.  This continues until all the ingredients are gone or the players run out of money.  Now, players sell their beer at market.  To make beer, you must have 1 hop card + 1 malt card + 1 water card.  The value of the beer is the sum of the value of the cards.  Contracts valued between 10 and 100 are turned over 1 at a time.  Players use once around bidding with their beer to buy the best contracts.

The currency of the game is seats, seats are used to pay for everything. The game is card-based, with a small map to show distances between Major and Regional Airports. The cards consist of Major Airports, Regional Airports, various Aircrafts, airline Hubs (your airline), Gates, and varied Opportunity/Events cards. The Ops/Events cards may denote bad weather in a region (thus reducing number of seats for that round), strikes (which can played on another airline), Fuel Price Adjustments (which effect your maintenance fees paid with Seats), and even an Aircraft Incident card (which people outside the industry call &quot;crashes.&quot;)<br/><br/>Airlines can be combined with the stand-alone game Airlines: United States Set 2.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": {"45377": "First Edition"}, "name": "Airlines", "playingtime": "120", "boardgamemechanic": {"2040": "Hand Management"}, "average": "4.60222", "boardgameexpansion": {}, "usersrated": "162", "age": "12"}, "2277": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic49756.jpg", "poll": {}, "boardgamedesigner": {"3": {"name": "(Uncredited)"}}, "statistics": {}, "yearpublished": "1976", "maxplayers": "6", "boardgameartist": {"3": "(Uncredited)"}, "boardgamepublisher": {"2368": {"name": "Murfett Australia"}}, "maxplaytime": "90", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic49756_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "90", "boardgamecategory": {"1023": {"name": "Bluffing"}}, "description": "Fortunes change at a stroke in this exciting game of betting and bluffing! Play your cards right and you'll be on a winning streak --but give too much away and you'll find your opponent's horse piping you at the post. Tension's high from the instant the horses leave their starting stalls. You keep the horse you've backed secret until you judge the moment's right to reveal it --cunning players will push other horses forward to create a &quot;false scent&quot;, then try to come through the field with a last minute burst and take the race at the winning post. If you back for a place, you play safe...But the stakes will be low. If you try for a big win...You could lose your shirt! This exciting race game keeps everyone guessing --and trying-- till the very last moment, and whether you win or lose it will provide hours of fascinating family fun.<br/><br/>Contents: Felt playing area, 42 horse movement cards, 12 betting indicator cards, money, six plastic horses in different colors, starting stalls and grandstand. In the Canadian edition, the felt became a standard board, and the starting stalls and grandstand are gone as they were just chrome (theme elements not employed in the game).<br/><br/>For each of the eight races the cards are thoroughly shuffled and dealt out to each player. The different cards (5 per horse) advance each horse at various rates (2 to 4 spaces) in the race and there are also 12 cards that affect any horse in the race (backwards 2 or forward 3). Players secretly bet on a horse to either win or place (take first or second place); you can also bet the jackpot (which is made up of all losing bets from previous races), which is like betting for a win except the minimum stake is higher and the payout is handled differently. Betting on a horse actually means taking one of its movement cards out...until you decide to play it, revealing your bet --one of this game's numerous subtleties.<br/><br/>During the race, the players play their horse cards in turn, maneuvering the horses as needed --horses have very limited sidestepping and could be blocked during the race. If a player &quot;loses his shirt&quot; i.e. goes broke, he just continues the game playing cards but not betting.<br/><br/>It can be best described as a cross between Win, Place &amp; Show and Undercover (a.k.a.

The board and bits are very nice plastic, except for the animals which are cardboard (and whose bases tend to fray after a while).  There is a big Ark sitting in the middle of the board that acts as a four-slotted piggy bank.  A whole bunch of four-squares bases shaped like lightning bolts come in three colours and represent the cool (white), temperate (green) and hot (yellow) continents.  Each of these bases can hold an animal.  The bases and animals are deployed semi-randomly at the game outset by all players (this could need to be better constrained by the rules as the set-up has considerable consequences on the game's outcome); the restriction is that each continent must form a single land mass.  Although the bases come in three heights, this is ignored in the rules.<br/><br/>The animals are colour-coded at their bases to indicate on which continent they belong.  They all come in pairs.  Some animals are predators, with a red background.  You must deploy them so as to split the pairs.  Your little boat has room for two animals on board.  You cannot carry a predator and a prey at once, but all other combinations are OK.<br/><br/>You roll a six-sided die to move; on a one, a continent base sinks (is removed) instead; you do not move.  The flooded base cannot have an animal on it, so if there are no floodable bases, you reroll.  Otherwise, you must use the exact die roll to move with --diagonals aren't allowed.  Once beside a continent, the die roll is used to send an &quot;expedition&quot; to catch an animal, which again must be reached by exact count.  If the trail goes through another animal  as well, you have the option of capturing it too.  You go back to your two &quot;berth&quot; spaces beside the Ark to drop the animals off --this also gets you a free second move.<br/><br/>Once the last animal is removed from the land, the game ends instantly.  All animals in transit (on board players' boats) are discarded and those in the Ark are scored.  Prey are worth one, predators two.  A pair of animals doubles in worth.  If you have animals from each of the three continents, your score doubles.<br/><br/>As the Ark hides the animals dropped in its compartments, there is an element of memory involved --you should try to remember what each player has brought back so far to have an idea of who's in the lead.<br/><br/>The movement system is annoying because diagonals aren't allowed (so parity conservation is enforced) and actually makes the game drag a bit at the end; it'd suggest playing that exact rolls aren't required --or that diagonals are allowed.<br/><br/>"}, "2310": {"boardgamedesigner": {"272": {"name": "J\u00fcrgen P.

Three to eight players take over such roles as the Mad Scientist, the Space Pirate Captain, the Phone Company, or a mystery Alien. Because the format is four way blind, and the players are uncertain of each other's motives, the fog of war is a formidable obstacle in this new gaming genre.<br/><br/>The action takes place on a space warehouse at the edge of an un-navigable region of the Galaxy known as the Coal Sack. The mad scientist in charge of the facility is trying to sell the Artifact, an alien navigational buoy, to  space pirates. The scientist wins if he completes the deal while keeping his illegal activities secret from the Phone Company, who has a couple of agents on board the station somewhere.<br/><br/>Victory for the Phone Company depends upon who their secret employers are. His agents may be just innocent employees here to fix the phone lines, they may be working for a rival Museum, or they may work for the Government or private agencies.<br/><br/>The Pirate Captain's motives are more transparent; he needs to get the Artifact by trade, artifice, or force. Even with his overwhelming firepower, this is not easy. One of his men may be a government informant. The Artifact may not be all it seems. Loss of contact with his men may mean they have turned against him, or alien bugs have laid eggs on their disemboweled remains. A clank outside may signal imminent explosive decompression, or just a sailmaker robot on the outside hull doing its job.<br/><br/>Aliens may or may not be on board; their nature is unknown. The ship's computer may or may not be a sentient character working with its own victory conditions. One's partner may be a trusted companion or a shapeshifting fiend in disguise. The ship's security system, robots, and self-destruct countdown may be puppets for unknown agencies.<br/><br/>The Artifact is a gripping drama, full of surprises and mayhem. No two games are alike, full of sabotage, sneak suits, bluster, kamikaze aliens, EMP and plasma guns, booby traps, hacking, and the prospect of the space station being blown up bit by bit by pirate cannon.

The play money and card graphics of this edition make the game a bit less abstract. Based on the stock market crash of Oct. 19, 1987.<br/><br/>There are four corporations. Each corporation is represented by its own suit in the deck of cards. The deck is shuffled and each player is dealt eight cards. Each player also gets $20,000 as starting capital. One card is placed on its matching corporation to establish a price for each stock. A player buys stock by placing a card in front of one&rsquo;s self and paying the cost of the stock. A player changes the price of stock by playing a card on the appropriate stock.<br/><br/>In turn a player can change the value of up to stocks and then buy or sell up to two of one&rsquo;s own stock &ndash; or &ndash; buy and sell and then change the value of the stocks. A player ends one&rsquo;s turn by replenishing the hand. A player may exchange up to four cards from one&rsquo;s own hand instead.<br/><br/>When the deck is exhausted, a &ldquo;Market Closed&rdquo; card is added to the deck. The deck is reshuffled and when the &ldquo;Market Closed&rdquo; card comes up the game ends. All stock held by the players is converted into cash and the player with the most money is the winner.<br/><br/>The rules of the game were published in the book Card Games Around the World.

As in the game of Go, the game is played on the intersections of the game board. The area of play is divided into two territories by a river in the middle of game board. In each territory there is a 3 line by 3 line palace, in which each player's respective General/Marshal is located. The object of the game is to capture the opponents's General/Marshal.<br/><br/>The pieces on both sides and their movements &amp; special rules are:<br/><br/><br/>    1 General: 1 Point orthogonally within the palace only. Not allowed to &lsquo;see&rsquo; the enemy General on an open file.<br/>    2 Advisors: 1 point diagonally within the palace only.<br/>    2 Chariots: Any distance orthogonally.<br/>    2 Cannons: Moves like a Chariot.

However, it shares a good number of characteristics with the 18xx series of games, while still being different enough to be a different game.  The game is about diverting water from rivers into irrigation channels and supplying the life-giving water to sections of land.  In 18xx, there are private companies; in Ur, there are independent nations.  In 18xx, there are companies with shareholders and a majority-controlling president; in Ur, there are countries with landowners and a majority-controlling King.  Once a Kingdom has enough land purchased in it, it begins to build water infrastructure in the form of reservoirs and pumps.  These structures draw the water away from the rivers into irrigation channels which are drawn straight on the board.  Like 18xx, the technology increases as the game progresses, making channel diggers obsolete and bringing out more efficient waterworks.  When a section of land is irrigated, the owner earns a small degree income and the kingdom it's located in earns a much larger income, which can then be given to the landowners or kept in the Kingdom's coffers for future upgrades.  The game is finally over when all the incoming water is used, forcing the southern tribes to invade, or a kingdom cannot fulfill it's obligation to buy more ditch-diggers and falls into revolution.

Each player has a set of 15 &quot;men&quot; that must be moved from their starting positions, around, and then off the board. Dice are thrown each turn, and each player must decide which of his men to move based on the outcome of the roll. Players can capture each other's men, forcing the captured men to restart their journey around the board. The winner is the first player to get all 15 men off the board. A more recent addition to the game is the &quot;doubling cube&quot;, which allows players to up the stakes of the game, as it is often played for money. Although the game relies on dice to determine movement, there is a large degree of strategy in deciding how to make the most effective moves given each dice roll as well as measuring the risk in terms of possible rolls the opponent may get.<br/><br/>Backgammon may be the first game to be mentioned in written history, going back 5,000 years to the Sumerians of ancient Mesopotamia. During the 1920's, archaeologists unearthed five boards from a cemetery in the ancient town of Ur. At another location, pieces and dice were also found along with the board. Boards from ancient Egypt have also been recovered from the tomb of Tutankhamun, including a mechanical dice box, no doubt intended to stop cheaters.<br/><br/>The names of the game were many. In Persia, Takhteh Nard&gt; which means &quot;Battle on Wood&quot;. In Egypt, Tau, which may be the ancestor of Senat. In Rome, Ludus Duodecim Scriptorum (&quot;game of twelve marks&quot;), later, Tabula (&quot;table&quot;), and by the sixth century, Alea (&quot;dice&quot;). In ancient China, T-shu-p-u and later in Japan, Sugoroko. The English name may derive from &quot;Bac gamen&quot; meaning &quot;Back Game&quot;, referring to re-entry of taken stones back to the board.<br/><br/>It was often enjoyed by the upper classes and is sometimes called &quot;The Aristocratic Game.&quot; The Roman Emperor Claudius was known to be such a fan that he had a set built into his coach so he could play as he traveled (the world's first travel edition?).<br/><br/>The rules in English were standardized in 1743 by Edmond Hoyle. These remained popular until the American innovations of the 1930's.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": {"46475": "3M bookcase edition"}, "average": "6.52611", "name": "Backgammon", "playingtime": "30", "boardgamemechanic": {"2014": "Betting/Wagering"}, "age": "8", "boardgameexpansion": {}, "usersrated": "9106", "boardgamesubdomain": {"4666": "Abstract Games"}, "boardgamefamily": {"4891": "3M Bookshelf Series"}}, "2398": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic121094.jpg", "is_expanded_by": {"72677": {"name": "Mastermind Ultimate Cribbage"}}, "poll": {}, "boardgamedesigner": {"985": {"name": "Sir John Suckling"}}, "statistics": {}, "yearpublished": "1630", "maxplayers": "4", "boardgamepublisher": {"171": {"name": "(Public Domain)"}}, "maxplaytime": "30", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic121094_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "30", "boardgamecategory": {"1002": {"name": "Card Game"}}, "description": "Cribbage is a card game that is played with a deck of standard playing cards and a signature piece of equipment called the Cribbage Board.

This is repeated until all players have exhausted their hand of cards.  Once all players are out of cards, each player picks up his hand and determines all possible scoring combinations, pegging points again on the cribbage board.

The Americans have 16 units spread all over the board (including a special &quot;Continental Army&quot; unit), 1 warship and a troop carrier with 4 reinforcements on board.<br/><br/>The Americans use two dice for movement (unless down to just one unit), the British one. All three dice are 0-1-1-1-2-3. Both players roll their dice using shakers and peek at them. The British player designates the unit he'll move, then the American reveals his throw and moves. Finally, the Bristish reveals his throw and moves.<br/><br/>A single unit is moved by each die --the grid is square and no diagonals are allowed. Units that end up on the same spot stack to form an army (which cannot be split), but each army is limited to 6 units. Naval moves are harbour to harbour except for the troop carriers (and any warship attempting to intercept them).<br/><br/>A Skirmish occurs when opposing units are adjacent. A card is drawn to resolve the Skirmish. This can result in a unit loss for either side (sometimes two), a major battle being triggered, or one or both armies moving a space or two. Major battles normally occur when an army lands on an enemy army by exact count; numerical superiority is added to the stronger side's throw, and the adjusted throw difference indicates how many units the losing side lost (however, that loss is limited to the number of units in the winning army).<br/><br/>Once the British have lost an army, they can call for Reinforcements. The Americans can do this once they've won a Major Battle. Reinforcement play is resolved separately from normal play. Two dice are used by both sides, one player trying to bring in his troop carrier whilst the other attempts to intercept with a warship (if the opponent has no warships left, the reinforcements automatically succeed). If the troop carrier makes it to a harbor, the reinforcements land (triggering a major battle if the harbor is enemy-held) and the troop carrier remains as a normal warship henceforth.<br/><br/>The British win by eliminating the Continental Army, whilst the American wins by eliminating all four British armies.

To be used, cavalry must have a piece at the front; artillery, if at the rear of your column, eliminates the enemy army without jumping.  Artillery cannot attack by itself.  Double jumps can happen, if the jumping infantry piece ends up facing a lone cavalry.  An open square must exist to jump to, so some map deployments are &quot;safe&quot; --but not against artillery.  However, pieces trapped so they cannot move are also removed as if they had lost a battle, so this strategy can backfire.<br/><br/>You win by completely eliminating the enemy army --but a player may concede earlier when a loss becomes unavoidable.  The four player game splits command of each army in two, and is played in partnerships.<br/><br/>A really good game, combining a historical theme with rather abstract mechanics.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": {"122439": "Milton Bradley Edition"}, "name": "Battle-Cry", "playingtime": "60", "boardgamemechanic": {"2072": "Dice Rolling"}, "average": "5.55068", "usersrated": "293", "boardgamesubdomain": {"4664": "Wargames"}, "boardgamefamily": {"3161": "American Heritage Games"}}, "2429": {"boardgamedesigner": {"3": {"name": "(Uncredited)"}}, "poll": {}, "name": "Barnabas Collins Dark Shadows Game", "playingtime": "60", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": {"2035": "Roll / Spin and Move"}, "yearpublished": "1969", "usersrated": "24", "boardgamefamily": {"6428": "Vampires"}, "maxplayers": "4", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic6014_t.jpg", "average": "4.68333", "statistics": {}, "boardgamepublisher": {"20": {"name": "Milton Bradley"}}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic6014.jpg", "boardgameversion": {"92952": "Milton Bradley blue side edition"}, "maxplaytime": "60", "boardgamecategory": {"1041": {"name": "Children's Game"}}, "age": "6", "minplaytime": "60", "description": "Based on the cult television series, the game comes with a coffin for component storage, glow-in-the-dark vampire teeth (bonus --not used in play), a spinner, some tiny wooden stakes and four sets of glow-in-the-dark skeleton parts.

Little did King Timothy realize that his nobles were planning to use his leaving as a chance to conquer one another.  Knowing the King could come back at any time, the Barons of Fyn each fought to get as much power as possible, so that when the King did return, he would be forced to ally himself with the most powerful Baron.  As a result, the most powerful Baron would hold influence over the King, which could be used to punish the other Barons.<br/><br/>The Barons of Fyn starts with King Timothy leaving Fyn, and each player becoming one of the Barons who will fight it out for ultimate power.  By expanding his frontiers, each Baron will build new villages, towns, and cities, which are loyal only to him.  These villages, towns, and cities, then allow each Baron to build ever bigger armies with which the Baron can go conquering.

Using a unique movement system that forces players to deal with momentum, and a fast and simple combat system, LNL is a great addition to the space game genre.<br/><br/>The game involves combat between the Moon and Earth, with individual ships represented by each counter.  Each side has from 3-8 ships.  Each ship has a log covering armament, fuel, engines and defence.  These logs are reminiscent or the Task Force Game 'Starfire', but have fewer options, but a more sophisticated layout.<br/><br/>The heart of the game is a vector-momentum system (like the one in Yaquinto's Shooting Stars or SPI's Vector Three).  Ships have a facing, use fuel to thrust towards the current facing, but speeds carry over from turn to turn.  Therefore ships can only decelerate only by turning and thrusting in the opposite direction of travel.  Speed is marked by placing numbered counters in the relevant direction.<br/><br/>Combat involves the use of missiles, guns (i.e. projectile weapons) and lasers.  Missiles are launched and move much like ships.  They are more manoeuvrable, but have a limited amount of fuel, used for acceleration and turning.  As a defence ships may have point defence weapons.  Guns and lasers are ranged weapons, with different arcs of fire, but essentially the same resolution.  Damage is assessed by throwing the requisite number of dice - any dice will do, or  even coins - the game using an EOR (even/odds randomiser) - with odd rolls yielding a hit.  Damage is then marked off the ship, with the affected area depending on the side through which fire was taken.<br/><br/>Each side (Moon and Earth) has a choice of 8 types of ships and 5 basic scenarios are available, each with a great deal of flexibility.  Tactics can be involved and subtle.  The  interplay of weapon types makes this an exciting game.  It is easy to learn and has great variety.<br/><br/>"}, "2439": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic36428.jpg", "is_expanded_by": {"3345": {"name": "Admiral On Deck"}}, "poll": {}, "boardgamedesigner": {"995": {"name": "Bruce Biskup"}}, "statistics": {}, "yearpublished": "1996", "maxplayers": "2", "boardgamepublisher": {"529": {"name": "BoneGames"}}, "maxplaytime": "90", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic36428_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "90", "boardgamecategory": {"1008": {"name": "Nautical"}}, "description": "Queen Victoria's Navy is a nautical combat war game for two players which simulates the period from 1880-1906.

Each player tries to reach his goals by exact count, scoring a point every time this is achieved.
