Now, in Trade Order, players put their bid card into the Ascending Market and simultaneously pull out neighboring planet cards.

This little dwarf village is a great place for new characters to &quot;cut their teeth&quot; and gain a little treasure in the process.<br/><br/>"}, "221523": {"rpgdesigner": ["Rendell Harris"], "rpgitemversion": ["Lulu perfect-bound version"], "poll": [], "name": "Alcatraz", "rpgartist": ["Rendell Harris"], "rpgproducer": ["Rendell Harris"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3434106.jpg", "usersrated": "0", "average": "0", "statistics": [], "rpg": ["APOCalypse 2500"], "rpgpublisher": ["(Self-Published)"], "rpgcategory": ["Scenario / Adventure / Module", "Sourcebook (rules/options to enhance play)"], "rpggenre": ["Fantasy (Science Fantasy)", "Science Fiction (Post Apocalypse)"], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3434106_t.jpg", "description": "From publisher blurb:<br/><br/>Alcatraz has been many things but in the last hundreds of years.

It can be played as a scenario itself OR as another expansion played together with any of the current multiplayer scenarios (Tradewars, Spacewars or Days of Glory).  In this scenario, players race to obtain &quot;retrofits&quot; for their starships which will give them bonus effects to alter the way space skirmishes are resolved.  There are a total of six (6) different &quot;retrofits&quot; available to each player.

The last heir of the line of Aridryll represents the final hope of salvation for the keep and its builder, a fallen elven paladin whose soul burns in eternal torment.<br/><br/>"}, "221592": {"rpgartist": ["Gary Dupuis", "Joan Guardiet", "Jan Willem van den Brink"], "rpg": ["Pathfinder System Compatible Product"], "poll": [], "name": "The Gloom Over Dunnocksdell", "rpgdesigner": ["Jan Willem van den Brink"], "rpgproducer": ["Joseph Browning"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3434995.jpg", "usersrated": "0", "rpgitemversion": ["PDF version"], "average": "0", "statistics": [], "rpggenre": ["Fantasy (High Fantasy)"], "rpgpublisher": ["Expeditious Retreat Press"], "rpgcategory": ["Scenario / Adventure / Module"], "rpgseries": ["1 on 1 Adventures"], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3434995_t.jpg", "description": "From publisher blurb:<br/><br/>1 on 1 Adventures 1 on 1 Adventures #20: The Tomb of Kara-Duir is a Pathfinder adventure designed for one GM and one player.<br/><br/>The recent attacks have shocked Dunnocksdell!

It's aimed for players aged 10+ and duels last around 15 minutes each. It has very simple mechanics and is a perfect light strategy game that can be played by anyone and anywhere!<br/><br/>THEME - Battle for victory in action-packed ninja combat. 16 different Ninja characters all with their own unique skills and abilities.<br/><br/>GAMEPLAY - Players take turns attacking and defending each other with a wide cast of ninja characters. Each turn has an attacker and defender. The attacker will play one card from their hand, and if attacking, the defender has a chance to defend the attack with one of their own cards.<br/>The attacker may play as many cards from their hand as they wish (one at a time) however, once they deem their turn over the will only have whatever cards are left over in their hand to defend with in the next turn.<br/>At the end of the Attackers turn, the Defender draws cards until they have a full hand of 5 and then the Defender becomes the Attacker and Attacker becomes Defender. The battle operates like this, back and forth, and whoever reaches zero health first, loses. Players each start with 10 Health points that are tracked via 'health dice'. The game operates with just a deck of 50 cards and 2 dice. It's easy to learn, immensely portable and has fantastic replayability. Every battle is unique and drenched with excitement!<br/><br/>NINJAS - There are two types of Ninjas... Battle and Special. BATTLE Ninjas are usable during either an attack and defend turn. While SPECIAL Ninjas are only usable during the attack turn.<br/><br/>DAMAGE - There are two main types of damage. Strike Damage and Spell Damage. The only difference is that Spell Damage is a bit more uncommon, therefore slightly harder to defend against.<br/>Damage can only be defended by similar damage type. ie. Strike defends Strike, Spell defends Spell... but they cannot defend against each other. However, there are also some ninjas that have SHIELD defend, which can defend both strike and spell.<br/><br/>"}, "221600": {"poll": [], "name": "Summoners War (2014)", "videogamemode": ["Network Multiplayer", "Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["Android Release", "iOS Release"], "average": "10", "videogametheme": ["Fantasy"], "usersrated": "1", "videogamedeveloper": ["Com2uS"], "videogamegenre": ["RPG", "Strategy"], "videogameplatform": ["Android", "iPad", "iPhone"], "statistics": [], "videogamepublisher": ["Com2uS"], "description": "An action-packed fantasy RPG with over 70 million Summoners around the world!

Each player takes on the role of a Clan who have been surviving within the wastes for the past four years. When a Death Cult set upon eradicating all remaining life within the wastes descend upon the Clans&rsquo; homeland, they must gather all the resources they can in order to survive.<br/><br/>The aim of Raiders is to be the last player in the game, or have earned the most points by the end of the tenth turn.<br/>Each Player&rsquo;s Clan has their own base that they are trying to protect and grow by gathering more resources. Players develop these bases by sending their Raiders to the 11 different locations that represent the wastes. The locations each player&rsquo;s Raiders are going to that turn are all revealed at the same time, meaning encounters between Raiders are always a surprise. At the end of each phase, those Raiders who survive are able to return to their base with the spoils they have recovered. Players then use the resources they have obtained to build new items upon their base that improve their performance in the rest of the game.<br/><br/>During encounters between Raiders, there are specific rules for Raiders to negotiate rather than simply battling each time. However if players are unable or unwilling to negotiate with one another, a round of combat can quickly break out. Combat rounds are fast paced and easy to follow so as not to overtake the gathering element of the game.<br/><br/>Not simply content with scrounging the wastes for more resources, Raiders can attack enemy bases in an attempt to wipe enemy factions out and gather more resources from their ruins. Each side must therefore be vigilant or risk losing all that they have amassed.<br/><br/>"}, "221626": {"poll": [], "name": "Mont-\u00e0-Mots Gribouillis", "playingtime": "30", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": ["Paper-and-Pencil"], "yearpublished": "2015", "usersrated": "0", "boardgamefamily": ["Mont-\u00e0-mots"], "maxplayers": "0", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3459978_t.jpg", "average": "0", "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["Ludik Qu\u00e9bec"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3459978.jpg", "boardgameversion": ["Mont-\u00e0-Mots Gribouillis, Ludik Qu\u00e9bec - French First Edition"], "maxplaytime": "30", "boardgamecategory": ["Action / Dexterity", "Children's Game", "Educational", "Party Game"], "age": "5", "minplaytime": "15", "description": "Mont-&agrave;-mots Gribouillis est un jeu de dessin o&ugrave; petits et grands doivent faire preuve de dext&eacute;rit&eacute;.<br/><br/>Fais tourner le crayon de la roulette et laisse le sort d&eacute;cider de ce que tu devras dessiner : un objet, un personnage ou le contenu d&rsquo;une carte &laquo; D&eacute;fi surprise &raquo;.

On your turn, you must either place a stone of your color on an empty point or remove a stone from an enemy weak pair.<br/><br/>You can't place a stone where your opponent just removed a stone from or remove a stone your opponent just placed. Also, you can't make a removal if either player made one on their single latest turn.<br/><br/>If you have no move available on your turn, you must pass. Passing is otherwise not allowed.<br/><br/>The game is won by the player who completes a chain of orthogonally adjacent stones of their color touching the two opposite board edges of their color.<br/><br/>If a board position is repeated with the same player to move, the game ends in a draw.

There are two restrictions: (1) whenever possible, each player should color an adjacent vertex of the last-played vertex; (2) when coloring a vertex on an edge of the big triangle, only the two colors of its endpoints may be used, not the color of the opposing vertex.<br/><br/>Sperner's lemma guarantees that the game cannot end in a tie: when all vertices of a triangulation have been legally colored, there will always exist a small tricolored triangle (in fact, an odd number of them).<br/><br/>The mathematical complexity game has been studied and found to be PSPACE-complete in 2010 for the special case of a &quot;regular&quot; triangulation.

The show originally ran from 7 September 1977 to 20 November 1995, and was hosted by Gordon Burns and usually broadcast on the ITV network on Mondays at 7pm.<br/><br/>Contestants from across the United Kingdom and Ireland competed in a series of rounds that tested their physical stamina and mental attributes. The title of the show is a reference to Superman's home planet Krypton, the title perceiving that the contestants had strong superhuman &quot;powers&quot; for taking part in the challenges they were set. The contestants, from 1986 onwards, all had their own corresponding colour, either red, green, yellow or blue. They wore their own clothes, apart from the Physical Ability round where the contestants wore track suits which were, in early series, red, burgundy, orange, green, black, light blue and dark blue. From 1986 onwards, the tracksuits were red, green, yellow and blue, and varied in design over the series that followed. The track suits changed to black with a coloured stripe from 1990 to 1993. For their own clothes, the contestants either wore a shirt/blouse, tie or a neckscarf of their corresponding colour. The points contestants earned through the game were not referred to as their score, but as their &quot;Krypton Factor&quot;, e.g. &quot;The winner, with a Krypton Factor of 46, is the legal secretary from Kent, Mike Berry&quot;. The 1987 series won the prestigious Premio Ondas - Spanish Television Award for Entertainment.<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;[en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Krypton_Factor The Krypton Factor]&quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/><br/>A computer game version of The Krypton Factor was published by TV Games and released in 1987 for the home computers of the era.<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;[en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Krypton_Factor%23Merchandise_and_commercial_representations The Krypton Factor]&quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/><br/>"}, "221729": {"poll": [], "name": "Gold Collection II (Amstrad CPC)", "videogamemode": ["Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["Amstrad CPC release"], "average": "0", "videogameseries": ["The Gold Collection (US Gold)"], "videogametheme": ["Driving", "Martial Arts"], "usersrated": "0", "videogamedeveloper": ["(Self-Developed Video Game)"], "videogamegenre": ["Action", "Racing"], "videogameplatform": ["Amstrad CPC"], "statistics": [], "videogamepublisher": ["U.S. Gold Ltd"], "videogamecompilation": ["Bounty Bob Strikes Back!", "Desert Fox", "Gunfright", "The Hulk (1984)", "Knight Lore", "Kung-Fu Master"], "description": "User Summary<br/>US Gold released this compilation for the Amstrad CPC with the following six games:<br/>- Kung-Fu Master<br/>- Gunfrigh<br/>- Knightlore<br/>- Desert Fox<br/>- Bounty Bob<br/>- Questprobe<br/><br/>"}, "221731": {"rpgdesigner": ["Ken Baker", "Gary Bates", "Claire Collum", "Jo Craig", "Djamila Eccleston", "Barbara Hvidt", "Bakura Matthews", "David Murrell", "Fiona Sullivan", "Joanne Webb", "Stephanie Wyman"], "statistics": [], "name": "Tower at the Edge of Reality (Issue 1 - Feb 2017)", "rpgartist": ["Claire Collum", "Stephanie Wyman"], "rpgproducer": ["David Murrell"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3439577.jpg", "usersrated": "1", "average": "7.5", "rpgissue": ["The Tower at the Edge of Reality"], "rpgissuearticle": ["Being A Trader", "Chairman's Welcome", "Contributors", "Cosplay: An Interesting Subject", "A Covent Garden Mystery: A Tale from the Rum Fellows Society", "An Editors Tale", "Folklore, Fantasy & Fiction: Goblins", "Gaming in a real (fictional) world", "How to create your own setting", "NPC Profile", "Problem with Adventurers", "Relics Required", "Stock's First Breach", "T10", "The Kimono", "The Ruins of Marshpit Fort", "The Ruins of Marshpit Fort (Maps)", "The Waterfall", "The World of Alrune"], "rpgpublisher": ["(Self-Published)"], "rpgissueversion": ["PDF Version"], "poll": [], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3439577_t.jpg", "description": "Publisher Blurb<br/><br/>(The) Tower at the Edge of Reality, otherwise known as TatEoR, is a free newsletter/magazine that covers mostly Table Top but also LARP, Re-enactment, Cos-play, CCG, Board Games, War Games and other Geekery.

Its industrial might and economic strength continues to multiply requiring significant resources from around the world.

It has shown particular interest in the Spratly Islands and Atolls which while sparse offer a very strategic position to controlling the greater South China Sea.  It started its invasion with significant naval patrols and has grown into massive land reclamation projects transforming many deserted atolls into useful island air bases and ports allowing the PRC to dominate the region and have the potential to project power further south.<br/><br/>China&rsquo;s neighbors have hardly been sitting idle while this take over has slowly occurred.  Vietnam, Taiwan, the Philippines, Malaysia and Brunei all have claims within the Spratly&rsquo;s and have challenged China on the waters and in international court a number of times. Vietnam lost a vicious naval skirmish in 1988 over South Johnson Reef and the Philippines recently won its challenge to PRC territorial claims although the results were ignored. China believes a post World War 2 map depicting a nine dash line defines its maritime territory almost as far as Indonesia.

Recreates the events of those days and allows the players to reproduce the most famous battles of the D-Day on the American beaches at a tactical level. Players take command of either the Allied or Axis forces (or can play solitaire) in the tactical battles of each scenario.<br/><br/>Normandy, The Beginning of the End while utilizing &quot;Paths to Hell&quot; standard rules, incorporates new and adapted rules and additions for this new front. The WSS promises many hours of fierce fighting between the infantry, tanks, artillery and aircraft belonging to the armies enveloped in this conflict. Just a few of the additions include:<br/><br/><br/>     Landings<br/>     Battalion officers<br/>     Paratroopers rules<br/>     Recon rules<br/>     Amphibious Tanks<br/>     Motorcycle recon<br/>     Waffen SS<br/>     Fallschirmj&auml;ger<br/>     Free French troops<br/><br/><br/>One A4 chart with many overlays including a whole beach making a large map.<br/>Normandy, The Beginning of the End has a moderate complexity with good solitaire suitability. The system emphasizes the role of officers. Officers can activate units, coordinate with other officers and their units, call for artillery support, air support, smoke screens, influence moral checks, coordinate assaults, and much more. Rules for special actions.<br/><br/>Based on the principle of simultaneous execution, or simply &quot;WE GO&quot;, a hybrid system of turns and &quot;real time&quot;. The players must activate unit officers to perform many actions (fire, assault, move, coordinate, etc). A turn ends when both players have completed all their activations. The scale is platoon level with units.<br/><br/>Representing groups of between 30 and 40 soldiers, weapons units represents groups of 3-4 weapons and their accompanying crews (20-25 soldiers), and the AFvs-Transports representing groups of 3 to 5 vehicles and their corresponding crews.

There are a lot of things you&rsquo;re not sure about, but is that really so different from before?<br/><br/>What you have before you is a comedic role-playing game where you take on the role of schoolgirls at a strange, surreal high school where every conspiracy, every urban legend, is true, though not necessarily in the way you'd expect. The simple rules and copious random tables bring Kagegami High and the island of Kageshima to life, letting you have countless strange, surreal, and hilarious adventures there.<br/><br/>To play you will need some friends, pencils and paper, and six-sided dice (with one die of a different color to be the Weird Die).<br/><br/>"}, "221950": {"poll": [], "name": "VOEZ", "videogamemode": ["Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["eShop Switch Downloadable edition", "iOS edition"], "average": "8", "videogametheme": ["School"], "usersrated": "1", "videogamedeveloper": ["Rayark Games"], "videogamegenre": ["Rhythm"], "videogameplatform": ["Android", "iPad", "iPhone", "Nintendo Switch"], "statistics": [], "videogamepublisher": ["Flyhigh Works", "Rayark Games"], "description": "VOEZ is a rhythm game developed by Rayark Games, an independent game developer in Taiwan.

They will face monsters, cast spells, perform special actions to play hide-and-seek with the other players while they try to get all the treasures that are hidden in the manor.<br/><br/>The game has an unique way to play. The players start the game with 5 Magic Cards, and when the turn begins monsters will appear in front of each player, but instead of facing the player that is in front of them, monsters will chase the player they are looking at! <br/>Then, players will have to choose secretly which monster or monsters they want to defeat, setting spells on the board face down, to prevent being chased when the magic spells are cast. No one can see those spells until the moment of revealing them, so if the monsters have changed between turns, the players will have to remember what they have prepared and if they need to prepare more to defeat the monsters. <br/>The game will end when a player gets 2 or more Lich's Treasures (which happens when you remain alone in the Manor or when you defeat alone the Lich) or when a player gets 10 coins (which are given by defeating monsters), whatever happens first.
