The winner is the player who best balances their position in the race with their success at the side goals.<br/><br/>Setting: Jamaica, 1675.<br/>After a long career in piracy, Captain Henry Morgan skillfully gets appointed to be Governor of Jamaica, with the explicit order to cleanse the Caribbean of pirates and buccaneers! Instead, he invites all of his former &quot;colleagues&quot; to join him in his retirement, to enjoy the fruits of their looting with impunity. Each year, in remembrance  of the &quot;good old days,&quot; Morgan organizes the Great Challenge, a race around the island, and at its end, the Captain with the most gold is declared Grand Winner.<br/><br/>Goal: The game ends on the turn when at least one player's ship reaches the finish line, completing one circuit around the island of Jamaica. At that point, players are awarded different amounts of gold in accordance with how far away from the finish line they were when the race concluded. This gold is added to any gold a player gathered along the way by detouring from the race to search for valuable treasure, by stealing gold or treasure from other players, or just by loading gold as directed by the cards the player played during the race. The player with the most total gold acquired through all these means is then declared the winner.<br/><br/>Gameplay: The game is played in rounds. Each player always has a hand of three cards, and a personal board depicting the five &quot;holds&quot; of their ship, into which goods can be loaded during the game. Each round, one player is designated as &quot;captain,&quot; with the next clockwise player being captain in the following round, and so on. The captain rolls two standard D6 dice, examines her cards, then announces which die will correspond to the &quot;day&quot; and which to the &quot;night.&quot; Each player then simultaneously selects a card from their hand and places it face down in front of them. Each card has two symbols on it, one on the left - corresponding to &quot;day&quot; - and one on the right (&quot;night&quot;). The symbols indicate either ship movement (forward or backward) or the loading of a type of good. After every player has selected a card, all cards are revealed simultaneously and then resolved clockwise one by one, starting with the captain's. When it is a player's turn to resolve her card, for first the left symbol on her card and then for the right symbol, the player will load a number of goods or move a number of spaces equal to the number of pips showing on the corresponding day or night die for that round. Thus the main decision each player makes during the game is which of their current three cards would best serve them on a particular turn, given the values of the day and night dice.  Finally, during the race, when a player lands on a spot already occupied by another player, there is a battle. Battles are mainly resolved by rolling a &quot;combat&quot; die, but players may improve their chances by using &quot;gunpowder&quot; tokens from their holds, if they loaded any on previous turns. The winner of a battle may steal some goods or treasure from the loser.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": ["English/French edition 2010", "Italian edition 2011", "Multilingual first edition", "Multilingual fourth edition", "Multilingual second edition", "Multilingual third edition", "Polish edition"], "average": "7.09705", "name": "Jamaica", "playingtime": "60", "boardgamemechanic": ["Dice Rolling", "Hand Management", "Simultaneous Action Selection"], "age": "8", "boardgameexpansion": ["Jamaica: Extra Treasures", "Jamaica: The Crew"], "usersrated": "10167", "boardgamesubdomain": ["Family Games"], "boardgamefamily": ["Colonial Theme", "Country: Jamaica", "Tropical theme"], "boardgamepodcastepisode": ["28 Games Later: Jamaica", "Cult of the New Board Game Podcast Episode 000 (2016) \u2013 Top 25 Games", "Cult of the New Board Game Podcast Episode 008 \u2013 T.I.M.E Stories vs Sherlock Holmes Consulting Detective", "Cult of the New Board Game Podcast Episode 038 \u2013 Jamaica vs Thunder Alley vs Race!

Players are part of a covert team (red, blue, green) that must eliminate one member of an opposing team, but your target is a mystery. At the start of the round, players are randomly dealt a card that depicts one of four characters: sniper, agent, cleaner, mole. The sniper of one team must shoot the sniper of another team to win that round. Problem is, you have to figure out who to shoot without being shot yourself.<br/><br/>As for the other characters, the mole is secretly working for one of the other teams, the agent makes the other team lose if he is shot, and the cleaner must make the shot if the sniper isn&rsquo;t a part of the team. (Two cards are randomly thrown out each round, so a team&rsquo;s sniper might be out of play. The cleaner needs to figure this out by talking with his teammates, but since all discussion is open, they still need to be covert in their talk.) Members of the winning team (or teams, when three teams are in play) receive a score card, and the first player (or players) to receive four cards wins the game. Teams are randomly determined each round, so your back-up man one round may be your target the next. Covert Action sounds utterly simple, yet is difficult to describe succinctly.

The dimensions are 250mm (10&quot;) by 355mm (14&quot;).  There are fifteen separate boards, including a Chess / Checkers board in the front papers and a Backgammon board in the end papers<br/><br/>John Astrop has written a short introduction, outlining the games he has chosen for this book and categorizing them in four groups:<br/>Easy Race Games (for small kids)- Ludo, Fire! Fire! (Snakes and Ladders), Steeplechase and Dragon.<br/>Harder Race Games (for older games) - Palm Tree, Shunting, Jackpot and Space Race.<br/>Position Games (dependent on strategy alone)- Checkers, Chess, Nine Men's morris, Five Field Kono, Asalto <br/>Wargames (strategy, imagination and luck) - Chess, Spychase, Warlord and Backgammon.<br/><br/>Palm Tree, Space Race, Shunting, Warlord, Spychase and Jackpot appear to be original games.  The others are either classic games or re-themed roll-and-move games.<br/><br/>Palm Tree is a combination of Ludo and Snakes and Ladders, with a nice art deco board.<br/><br/>Space Race is a bigger scale version of Ludo, requiring the players to roll the right numbers to build their rockets before starting on the trip to the Green Planet.  There are various squares on the way that give different results as you land on them.  The only strategy comes in deciding which piece to move.<br/><br/>In Shunting players again roll and move, but have to pick up four trucks before returning to the start.  Players have only one train each, and can only move in one direction in a turn, but can then change direction on the next direction, as if they were trains passing through points.  Trains block each other, although they do not get bigger with extra trucks on.<br/><br/>Warlord is a capture game with a pre-Raphaelite design.  Players have 4 pieces starting at castles on the corners on the board, and can move any one of these 4 in turn.  Landing exactly on an enemy piece captures it, and the captured piece can then be moved back to the castle and imprisoned.  Players can release captive pieces through the enchanted forest or lake.  A single piece can capture more than one enemy piece, but if that pile is recaptured, all friendly pieces go free.<br/><br/>Spychase is similar to Scotland Yard, with no hidden movement.  The spy player attempts to steal a set of plans by rolling and landing on them, then escaping to the airport or docks.  The police players cannot capture the spy until he has taken the plans.  At that point the police player then tries to block in the spy player so that he cannot move his full roll.<br/><br/>In Jackpot, the 2 players move their pieces up a fruit machine the full number rolled, but can only move a piece when the fruit under the piece moved is shown on the row of 6 fruit that the piece arrives on.  If no forward moves can be made, a piece must be moved down the dice roll instead.  Once all three pieces are at the final squares, a player wins.<br/><br/>"}, "28071": {"image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic202025.jpg", "poll": [], "boardgamedesigner": ["E. R.

Dracos has its own ships and the labyrinth itself to stop and destroy the other players.<br/><br/>Each player that reaches the goal square scores a marginal victory, while a total victory can only be achieved if ALL emissaries reach the goal, so cooperation is encouraged.<br/><br/>"}, "28085": {"boardgamedesigner": ["(Uncredited)"], "poll": [], "name": "Duelo & CIA.", "playingtime": "90", "minplayers": "3", "boardgamemechanic": ["Acting", "Card Drafting", "Co-operative Play", "Dice Rolling", "Line Drawing", "Paper-and-Pencil", "Partnerships", "Role Playing", "Roll / Spin and Move", "Singing"], "yearpublished": "0", "usersrated": "3", "maxplayers": "20", "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic186150_t.jpg", "average": "6.33333", "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["Hobby"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic186150.jpg", "boardgameversion": ["First edition"], "maxplaytime": "90", "boardgamecategory": ["Deduction", "Dice", "Educational", "Math", "Music", "Party Game", "Trivia", "Word Game"], "age": "14", "minplaytime": "90", "description": "This is a Party Game were the teams have to be the first ones in completing their &ldquo;cake&rdquo; with the 6 colored pieces:<br/><br/>     Green &ndash; Drawing<br/>     Yellow &ndash; Forbidden words<br/>     Orange &ndash; Charades<br/>     Purple &ndash; Trivia<br/>     Pink &ndash; Silent words<br/>     Light Blue &ndash; Words that start with the letter&hellip;<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Excellent for big reunions!<br/><br/>"}, "28086": {"image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic576949.jpg", "boardgameimplementation": ["Age of War"], "poll": [], "boardgamedesigner": ["Reiner Knizia"], "statistics": [], "yearpublished": "2006", "maxplayers": "6", "boardgamepublisher": ["Hasbro", "Parker Brothers", "Parker Spiele"], "maxplaytime": "20", "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic576949_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "20", "boardgamecategory": ["Dice", "Territory Building", "Wargame"], "boardgamehonor": ["2007 \u00c5rets Spill Best Family Game Nominee", "2007 Spiel der Spiele Hit f\u00fcr Familien Recommended"], "description": "Risk Express, part of the Hasbro Express Line, is a quick-playing game of conquest.

He then selects a card and uses the symbols rolled to conquer exactly one of the battle lines on this card (by placing the appropriate dice on that line). If he can do this, he then rolls the remaining dice, ideally conquering another line; if he can't conquer a line, he removes one die from play, then rolls again. His turn ends when either he conquers every line on the card (in which case he claims it) or he no longer has dice available to roll.<br/><br/>Each card is worth a number of victory points. You can conquer cards owned by other players, but you need to conquer an additional general line in the process. If a player owns all the cards of one continent, however, those cards are secure and cannot be stolen. What's more, these cards are now worth more points because you've united the continent under one ruler (you).<br/><br/>When the last card is claimed, players tally their points, and whoever has the highest score wins.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": ["Dutch first edition", "English first edition", "French first edition", "German first edition"], "average": "6.27191", "name": "Risk Express", "playingtime": "20", "boardgamemechanic": ["Dice Rolling"], "age": "8", "usersrated": "899", "boardgamesubdomain": ["Family Games"], "boardgamefamily": ["Hasbro Express Line", "Risk"], "boardgamepodcastepisode": ["DJ61: Age of War (2014) Reiner Knizia"]}, "28087": {"boardgamedesigner": ["(Uncredited)"], "poll": [], "name": "\u00a1\u00a1El juego del ligue!!", "playingtime": "50", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": ["Roll / Spin and Move"], "yearpublished": "0", "usersrated": "1", "maxplayers": "10", "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic186120_t.jpg", "average": "2", "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["Juegos Fournier"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic186120.jpg", "maxplaytime": "50", "boardgamecategory": ["Racing"], "age": "16", "minplaytime": "50", "description": "This is a dating game.

CC:P's main theme is the addition of three new factions to the Combat Commander family:<br/><br/>    Imperial Japan<br/>    the Pacific US - with a strong emphasis on the US Marine Corps<br/>    the Pacific Commonwealth - focusing on Indian and ANZAC forces<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>CC:P is a stand alone game in the card-driven Combat Commander game series. While utilizing Combat Commander: Europe's basic rules, CC:P includes numerous rule tweaks and additions in order to more accurately portray tactical warfare as experienced by the participants in and around the Pacific and Indian Oceans. This slightly ramps up the complexity of the Combat Commander series while at the same time imparting a bit more depth and realism. Just a few of the additions include:<br/><br/>Banzai attacks;<br/>BARs and Thompson SMGs;<br/>Beach landings &amp; river crossings;<br/>Hidden movement;<br/>Caves;<br/>Scouts;<br/>Aircraft;<br/>Bayonets;<br/>Mortar spotting;<br/>Treetop snipers;<br/>Reconnoitering.<br/><br/>SCALE: Each hex of a Combat Commander map is roughly 100 feet across (about 30 meters). Each complete Player Turn abstractly represents several seconds of real time. Each complete Game Turn abstractly represents several minutes of real time.<br/><br/>UNITS: Due in part to the unique composition of late-war USMC squads and the imbedding of specialized weapon teams within IJA squads, the units in the game are represented by 4-6 man Teams and 8-13 man Squads. Radios &mdash; and individual weapons larger than a rifle &mdash; are represented by their own counters. Individual Aircraft are also represented with their own counters.<br/><br/>VICTORY: Players attempt to achieve victory by moving their combat units across the game map to attack their opponent&rsquo;s combat units and occupy as many objectives as possible. The degree to which a player succeeds or fails is measured by a scenario&rsquo;s specific Objective chits, the destruction of enemy units, and the exiting of friendly units off the opponent&rsquo;s board edge.<br/><br/>GAME FLOW: A game of Combat Commander is divided into several Time segments. There is no sequence of play to follow, however: each Time segment is divided into a variable number of Player Turns, each of which may consist of one or more Fate Card &quot;Orders&quot; conducted by the active player.

Roberts Award&quot; winning Death in the Trenches: The Great War, 1914-1918 system to simulate the American Civil War. Units represent Generals (their component brigades are represented off-map), elite units (Iron Brigade, Cobb's Legion), cavalry (Stuart, Stoneman), guerillas (Quantrill, Kirk), and Indians (Choctaws, Delawares, Stand Watie). Like Death in the Trenches: The Great War, 1914-1918 random events and &quot;Special Event Coins&quot; are crucial, and there are about 400 (yes, 400) of them.<br/><br/>Forming stacks into 'Grand Armies' (e.g. Army of the Potomac, Army of Northern Virginia) enables the various commanders in the stack to coordinate their fighting powers. Cavalry have special abilities but also a habit of running away when you need them. Guerillas ravage the countryside (Quantrill, Price, Morgan -- and the less widely known Union barbarian, George Kirk). Generals do not always follow orders to move, and sometimes must be prodded by expending irreplaceable command chits. Special rules cover foreign intervention, the border states, as well as McClellan, Lee, Jackson and a few other characters. Naval warfare (Confederate commerce raiding) is handled by an extremely simple, elegant abstract model complete with a world map.<br/><br/>The game is won by either capturing the government marker of either player or destroying his economy. Capturing cities and winning naval battles increases the enemy's inflation rate, which affects a lot of elements like national elections (there are three over the course of the game--one in the Confederacy!) and reinforcement rates.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "1", "boardgameversion": ["First edition in small box"], "name": "C.S.A.

The game used 23 offensive basic plays and 8 defensive lines. Unlike some contemporaries and many lesser football games, the proper defense will limit the damage of a great roll. Despite the limited number of offensive plays, there are plenty of choices since the plays can showcase feature positions. Also, beyond the 8 defensive setups, the defensive player can also have the choice of which player to 'key' on. Of course, double-covering the wrong receiver will allow a lesser roll to have a higher result.<br/><br/>The true advancement for the game system was the yearly 'rating' of each team on their defensive and offensive line in each of these plays. Thus, when you played two teams, there was a die roll modifier for each play based on each defense.<br/><br/>The clock functions were also very good, allowing a true 'two minute drill' and the use of real game strategies.<br/><br/>Fran Tarkenton's Pro Football is a great time capsule with a look at the teams in the 1960s, before they merged to become the NFC and AFC.<br/><br/>"}, "28322": {"image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic189908.jpg", "poll": [], "boardgamedesigner": ["(Uncredited)"], "statistics": [], "yearpublished": "0", "maxplayers": "2", "age": "10", "boardgamepublisher": ["Philmar"], "maxplaytime": "30", "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic189908_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "30", "boardgamecategory": ["Abstract Strategy", "Sports"], "description": "&quot;Enjoy the thrills and skills of football by planning the moves that bring the goals.&quot; A very abstract two player simulation of a football match, published sometime in the late Sixties.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": ["Philmar Edition"], "name": "Goal!", "playingtime": "30", "boardgamemechanic": ["Simulation"], "average": "5.25", "usersrated": "2", "boardgamesubdomain": ["Abstract Games"], "boardgamefamily": ["Sports: Football / Soccer"]}, "28323": {"boardgamedesigner": ["Bryan Aldrich"], "poll": [], "name": "4th Street Baseball", "playingtime": "90", "minplayers": "1", "boardgamemechanic": ["Simulation", "Simultaneous Action Selection"], "yearpublished": "2007", "usersrated": "5", "boardgamefamily": ["Admin: Better Description Needed!", "Sports: Baseball"], "maxplayers": "2", "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic567828_t.jpg", "average": "6.7", "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["4th Street Software"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic567828.jpg", "boardgameversion": ["First Publication"], "maxplaytime": "90", "boardgamecategory": ["Sports"], "age": "0", "minplaytime": "90", "description": "4th Street Baseball is a baseball simulation game using individual ratings to recreate big league baseball action.  Ratings are printed in booklet format on perforated cardstock.  They measure 3.5&quot; x 2.5&quot; (the same size as a bubble-gum card).<br/>   The game starts with the pitcher.  Each pitcher is rated for his ability to get the ball over the plate, the likelihood of him giving up the long ball, walk to strikeout ratio, hits allowed, etc.<br/>   Each hitter has been rated for average, extra-base potential, strikeouts and walks, base running, stealing, bunting, and lefty-righty hitting. In addition, pitchers and hitters are rated for defensive range, error frequency, outfielder-catcher arms, and infielders ability to turn the double play.<br/>   Five dice are employed in 4th Street Baseball...one twenty-sided (d20), two ten-sided (d10), and two six-sided (d6). <br/>   Play starts by determining the count.  The two d10 are rolled and the count is determined by looking at the pitcher's count column.  If the pitcher gets ahead in the count, his ratings, along with all of the defensive players behind him, increase.  If he falls behind, then the increase is instead given to the hitter.  The defense is allowed to position its players and selects a strategy card (fastball, breaking ball, pitchout, etc.).  The offense, likewise, selects a strategy card (hit and run, steal, etc.).  All five dice are rolled, the strategy cards are revealed, and the play continues by finding a &quot;matchup&quot; on the pitcher's card.  Matchups vary from balls hit to a specific fielder, to batter-pitcher battles, to ballpark and defensive positioning effects.  Once a matchup has been determined, the defender's rating is subtracted from the hitter's rating and the result is compared to the d20.  If the result is less than or equal to the d20, the hitter wins the matchup and the final result of the play is read off the hitter by adding the two d6 and referring to the appropriate column.  If the d20 result is higher, then the play result is found similarly on the defensive player.<br/><br/>The game comes with a book (or two books, depending upon the season) full of baseball player ratings which are perforated to 2.5&quot; x 3.5&quot; (the same size as a bubble-gum card), baseball fields (printed on 8.5&quot; x 11&quot; card stock, for each team), dice, strategy cards, an easy-to-read results chart, and score sheets.

Once the students awake on the island, their biggest fears are realized: There is only one way off the island - to be the last one standing. Kill or be killed, true survival of the fittest.<br/><br/>Intended as a party game, Survival of the Fittest mixes together hand-management and bluffing of Bang! with the second guessing and alliances of Werewolf, bringing in up to 12 players to play as twelve of the fourteen unique characters which are dealt out randomly (along with a starting weapon) to the players.<br/><br/>Each turn the players secretly (or openly!) choose one of the twelve map co-ordinates to go to that turn, each space giving different advantages (an extra health, a new melee weapon). However, once there, it's time for action! Players ally together to take down other players before turning on their friends. Killing an opponent allows the player to take the weapon, strengthening their own position and in turn making themselves more of a target. However, hiding like a coward is an acceptable tactic, as players can only attack others in the same co-ordinate. With plenty of meta-gaming and whispering going around the table, you can never be sure who to trust!<br/><br/>As the game goes on, co-ordinates get randomly taken out of play to close down the areas and force confrontation until only one player remains - the fittest, the survivor.<br/><br/>Designed by Luke Morris and published by Games On The Way, Survival Of The Fittest aims to push itself head first into the big group and party game genre.<br/><br/>"}, "28394": {"image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic191533.jpg", "poll": [], "boardgamedesigner": ["David S.

It is most notable for a desperate and futile charge by the French cuirassiers and for a children's song that begins C'&eacute;tait au soir d'la bataille de Reichshoffen.<br/><br/>The scale of Reichshoffen 1870 is the same as Solferino 1859 (600 meters/hex, 1 hour/turn, units are brigades). The rules vary only slightly: French defensive fire and Prussian artillery are both more effective than in the earlier game, reflecting the two nations' technical advances in small arms and cannon, respectively. French heavy cavalry have two opportunities per game for a charge &agrave; la mort, which can strike anywhere within five hexes of a French headquarters - usually without effect but useful if saved for just the right opportune moment.<br/><br/>Other rules changes are based on the armies' command problems. The French army has no commander-in-chief. Marshal Mac Mahon, the hero of the Battle of Magenta, &quot;although physically present on the battlefield did not direct the battle&quot;. As a consequence, French formations can act effectively only by passing initiative tests. (Optional rules give the Marshal a chance to be slightly or fully effective.) On the Prussian side, there was quite a lot of initial confusion; brigades cannot launch coordinated attacks until the commander-in-chief, Prince Frederick William, arrives on the scene halfway through the action.<br/><br/>The battle begins at 8:30 am and lasts for 10 hourly turns.

Magenta 1859 recreates it using the same rules as Solferino 1859 and Reichshoffen 1870, as well as the same scale (one hour per turn, 600 meters per hex, brigades). Unlike its siblings, the game has almost no special rules.<br/><br/>Napoleon III commands the French and, though scarcely comparable to his uncle, well overmatches the Austrians' sluggish and late arriving Count Gyulai. Unfortunately for the French, Napoleon enters far away from the bulk of his forces and takes a long time to get within command range. Until then, formations may move effectively only when their commanders make successful initiative rolls, and the largest French corps suffers from an initiative penalty for the first several hours. (Its commander, General Mac Mahon, moved slowly while waiting for a Sardinian division to come up to cover his open flank. This caution did not, however, prevent him from becoming the hero of the day. The Emperor rewarded him with the title &quot;duc de Magenta&quot;.)<br/><br/>The battle starts at 10:00 a.m. and lasts 10 turns, with many brigades not arriving until the afternoon. The forces (and the map) are only about half the size of those in Solferino, and the victory conditions are simpler: Each side gets one Victory Point for each hex it holds in the town of Magenta (which has three) plus one for each demoralized enemy corps.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": ["Vae Victis magazine edition"], "average": "6.73333", "name": "Magenta 1859", "playingtime": "0", "boardgamemechanic": ["Hex-and-Counter"], "age": "12", "usersrated": "15", "boardgamesubdomain": ["Wargames"], "boardgamefamily": ["Les Grandes Batailles de Napoleon III", "Magazine: Vae Victis"]}, "28430": {"image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic221530.jpg", "poll": [], "boardgamedesigner": ["Morgan Gillard", "Nicolas Stratigos"], "statistics": [], "yearpublished": "2007", "maxplayers": "1", "boardgameartist": ["Didier Bourgeois", "Christophe Camilotte", "Giuseppe Rava"], "boardgamepublisher": ["Vae Victis"], "maxplaytime": "0", "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic221530_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "0", "boardgamecategory": ["Wargame", "World War II"], "description": "(from the rulebook :)<br/><br/>Commandos Sur Saint-Nazaire is a solitary game, it simulates the British commando raid on St Nazaire on 27-28th March 1942.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "1", "boardgameversion": ["Vae Victis magazine edition"], "average": "6.28125", "name": "Commandos Sur Saint-Nazaire", "playingtime": "0", "boardgamemechanic": ["Point to Point Movement"], "age": "12", "usersrated": "16", "boardgamesubdomain": ["Wargames"], "boardgamefamily": ["Admin: Better Description Needed!", "Country: France", "Magazine: Vae Victis", "Solitaire Games", "Solitaire Wargames"]}, "28431": {"image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic191910.jpg", "poll": [], "boardgamedesigner": ["Chalfant Conley", "Keith Stine"], "statistics": [], "yearpublished": "2005", "maxplayers": "0", "boardgameartist": ["Chalfant Conley", "Keith Stine"], "boardgamepublisher": ["Iron Ivan Games"], "maxplaytime": "0", "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic191910_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "0", "boardgamecategory": ["Expansion for Base-game", "Miniatures", "Wargame", "World War II"], "description": "This expansion to the Disposable Heroes and Coffin For Seven Brothers system adds details for including the Fighting Men of the British Commonwealth in your games.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "0", "boardgameversion": ["First edition"], "name": "Disposable Heroes and Coffin for Seven Brothers: Go Forward Together", "playingtime": "0", "boardgamemechanic": ["Dice Rolling"], "age": "12", "boardgameexpansion": ["Disposable Heroes and Coffin For Seven Brothers"], "usersrated": "11", "boardgamesubdomain": ["Wargames"], "average": "7.68182"}, "28432": {"image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic191911.jpg", "poll": [], "boardgamedesigner": ["Chalfant Conley", "Keith Stine"], "statistics": [], "yearpublished": "2005", "maxplayers": "0", "boardgameartist": ["Chalfant Conley", "Keith Stine"], "boardgamepublisher": ["Iron Ivan Games"], "maxplaytime": "0", "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic191911_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "0", "boardgamecategory": ["Expansion for Base-game", "Miniatures", "Wargame", "World War II"], "description": "This expansion to the Disposable Heroes and Coffin For Seven Brothers system adds details for including German Armed forces in your games.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "0", "boardgameversion": ["Second Edition"], "name": "Disposable Heroes and Coffin for Seven Brothers: Angriff!", "playingtime": "0", "boardgamemechanic": ["Dice Rolling"], "age": "12", "boardgameexpansion": ["Disposable Heroes and Coffin For Seven Brothers"], "usersrated": "15", "boardgamesubdomain": ["Wargames"], "average": "7.7"}, "28433": {"boardgamedesigner": ["(Uncredited)"], "average": "0", "poll": [], "name": "Dial N Spell", "playingtime": "0", "minplayers": "0", "yearpublished": "1961", "usersrated": "0", "maxplayers": "0", "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic191888_t.jpg", "boardgameartist": ["(Uncredited)"], "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["Milton Bradley", "Nathan", "Ravensburger Spieleverlag GmbH"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic191888.jpg", "boardgameversion": ["MB English edition 1958", "MB English edition 1961", "Nathan French edition", "Ravensburger German edition"], "maxplaytime": "0", "boardgamecategory": ["Children's Game", "Educational", "Word Game"], "age": "4", "minplaytime": "0", "description": "Made by Milton Bradley in 1961 for Ages 4 - 8.<br/><br/>Have fun.

However, because it is based on the popular, tried and tested 'Kampfgruppe' series it is also compatible with the rest of Dropwing's World War Two titles, allowing scenarios of infinite variety to be created.<br/><br/>Urban fighting is held by many to be one of the most challenging aspects of modern warfare and this is equally reflected by the challenge of representing such combat on the war games table. This volume enables various types of infantry and vehicles to test their mettle against some of the unique situations to be encountered whilst fighting in built up areas.<br/><br/>Some of the most significant battles of the Second World War were fought in urban surroundings, such as Berlin, the Warsaw Uprising and perhaps most notably Stalingrad. However, it should also be remembered that, in addition to such epic and historically significant encounters, countless smaller actions took place within the towns and villages along the paths of advance made at all stages of the war. The prime purpose of &quot;Rattenkrieg&quot; is to enable this style of combat, along with its unique atmosphere and challenges, to be recreated on the tabletop.<br/><br/>Special procedures are presented to incorporate sniper duels, sewer fighters and tank hunting teams, in addition to more mainstream combatants. Ready reference sheets are printed on facing pages and due to the comb binding the book can be opened flat to speed up play by having all of the main procedures available at a glance.<br/><br/>&quot;Rattenkrieg&quot; also includes a scenario based on an historical event, which can be used to introduce new players to the game as well as form a basis for experiment with various aspects of the game.<br/><br/>"}, "28458": {"image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic822335.jpg", "boardgameimplementation": ["Road Cycling Tour: Travel Edition"], "poll": [], "boardgamedesigner": ["Lajos Brons"], "statistics": [], "yearpublished": "2005", "maxplayers": "6", "age": "12", "boardgamepublisher": ["(Web published)", "Papercut Games", "Print & Play Productions"], "maxplaytime": "150", "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic822335_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "150", "boardgamecategory": ["Print & Play", "Racing", "Sports"], "description": "Road Cycling Tour (RCT) is a road cycling simulation focusing on team tactics in multi-stage races.

Movement is modified roll-and-move with some additional rules for breakaways and closing gaps (as a simulation of slipstreaming). The characteristics or qualities of the cyclists/riders are represented with 'speed counters' that can be used to replace or in addition to the dice. Teams should generally have a balanced mix of riders with different specializations represented by different sets of speed counters.<br/><br/>A 'beginners' game' and rules for time trials, team time trials, and some advanced and optional rules are included with the game, but given the flexible nature of the game, players can easily make further adaptations to simulate their favorite cycling event. To further explain the most complex rules, a series of picture tutorials can be found in the 'rules forum' here.<br/><br/>RCT is not a short game. It is recommended to play at least 5 stages in a single game, and with 2 experienced players, that would take between 2 and 3 hours. More players and more (and/or longer) stages make the game longer, smaller teams make it shorter but have a negative effect on possible team tactics.

Attach MR. IT to his stand and place him on the start facing the yellow end of the playing strip.<br/>3.

IT to face his opponent and moves MR. lT one step towards his opponent's CAUGHT YOU space. The hiding place card is left face up. He then turns over a new Crazy Creature card in the centre and goes again, looking for the next Crazy Creature.<br/>If all 8 Crazy Creature cards in the centre have been turned over before MR. IT gets to a CAUGHT YOU space, the Crazy Creature cards are re-shuffled and placed face down between the players.

Having said this, Spear Song provides a 'stand alone' system in it's own right, which provides players with the basic material to fight battles using a wide variety of warriors from the 'Sword and Shield' era.<br/><br/>"}, "28497": {"boardgamedesigner": ["(Uncredited)"], "poll": [], "name": "Tamagotchi Electronic Grow Your Pet Game", "playingtime": "0", "minplayers": "2", "yearpublished": "2007", "usersrated": "3", "boardgamefamily": ["Tamagotchi"], "maxplayers": "4", "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic192138_t.jpg", "average": "5.66667", "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["Pressman Toy Corp."], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic192138.jpg", "boardgameversion": ["Pressman Edition"], "maxplaytime": "0", "boardgamecategory": ["Animals", "Children's Game", "Electronic", "Fantasy", "Video Game Theme"], "age": "6", "minplaytime": "0", "description": "From the Press Release:<br/><br/>Based on Bandai&rsquo;s popular line of Tamagotchi virtual pets, this board game allows fans to start out as an egg and try to be the first player to evolve to adulthood.

It&rsquo;s particularly hard to define where the &ldquo;real&rdquo; ends and the &ldquo;fictional&rdquo; begins. For those of you who follow military and scientific matters, you&rsquo;re likely to spot where reality meets fiction-although in some cases, you may not be able to clearly distinguish between these boundaries. However, it really isn't important where the lines blur a bit. The fuzzy area where reality and fiction intermix is intentional. The real fun is in the game itself and what you can (or can&rsquo;t) make of it to be successful in your mission and/or goals!<br/><br/>You can play T5 strictly as a miniatures game, a roleplaying game, or both simultaneously. As you will see, the Character Profile Log sheets can be filled out and set up to use either way, depending upon the amount of information you want to know, or need to have, about a character. The game can easily be converted into a dual miniatures/roleplaying game simply by choosing to play one character as yourself while the rest of your team (Strike Cell) is played normally as miniatures would be.<br/><br/>T5 is excellent for present-day combat simulation gaming too! The unique and versatile Com20 game system mechanics give you everything you need to game battles taking place today--with no modifications necessary! See the T5 Action! page for additional details.<br/><br/>"}}
