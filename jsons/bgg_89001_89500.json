Classic games like Pong, Centipede, and Battlezone began a video gaming revolution. Atari, the video game pioneer, is bringing back these and 8 other 2-dimensional classic games, giving it an updated look for the 21st Century and introducing a new way to play them.<br/><br/>No need to dust off your Atari 2600. These classic games are now available for you to take everywhere you go on the PSP&copy; (Playstation&copy;Portable) system. Whether you&rsquo;re looking for that classic, retro experience, or you&rsquo;re looking for new-age graphics, each game will be playable in both classic and evolved forms to satisfy your itch. As an added bonus, you&rsquo;ll be able to unlock over 50 Atari 2600 titles giving you non-stop gaming action.<br/><br/>Asteroids - Shoot down flying saucers before they shoot you. Asteroids was originally released in 1979 and was quickly a hit in the United States, becoming Atari&rsquo;s best-selling game of all time.<br/><br/>Asteroids Deluxe - Asteroids Deluxe was produced in 1980 as the sequel to Asteroids.<br/><br/>Battlezone - Drive your tank around the battlefield, fire your gun and destroy the enemy tanks. Battlezone was released in 1980 and is widely considered to be the first &quot;virtual reality&quot; game.<br/><br/>Centipede - The Centipede is attacking and you must destroy all the segments before it reaches the bottom of the garden and takes you out! Centipede was released in 1980.<br/><br/>Lunar Lander - The first carbon-conscious game! Land you craft on the craggy moonscape, but try to use as little fuel as you can. Lunar Lander was released in 1979. Though it never equaled the success of Asteroids, it has always retained a strong and loyal fan-base.<br/><br/>Millipede - Released in 1982 as a sequel to Centipede. Shoot the garden nasties and watch out for the Millipede!<br/><br/>Missile Command - Defend the cities and don&rsquo;t let the nukes take out your missile stations. Released in 1980, Missile Command was a huge hit, often providing more revenue than contemporary machines until the mid-1990s.<br/><br/>Pong - Well, what can we say about this classic that you don&rsquo;t already know? Pong was released in 1972 and is the oldest game of the collection. It&rsquo;s a classic that never grows old.<br/><br/>Super Breakout - Move the bat and deflect the ball. Released in 1978, Super Breakout was microprocessor-based arcade game, as opposed to the discreet logic used in the original Breakout.<br/><br/>Tempest - Destroy the baddies as they make their way toward you. Tempest, released in 1981, was the first game to allow you to choose your starting level (a system Atari dubbed &quot;SkillStep&quot;). This feature increased the maximum starting level, depending on your performance in the previous game, essentially allowing you to continue &mdash; a feature that became a standard in later video games.<br/><br/>Warlords - It&rsquo;s like Breakout, but with four players. Defend your base and destroy the others. Warlords was released in 1980.<br/><br/>Atari 2600 (Unlockable) - To unlock Atari 2600 games, you must earn all four awards for each of the main games.<br/><br/>Source: The Publisher Website.<br/><br/>"}, "89012": {"videogame": {"69022": "LEGO Batman: The Videogame"}, "statistics": {}, "name": "Pure & LEGO Batman", "videogamemode": {"2313": "Cooperative"}, "videogameversion": {"77262": "UK Xbox 360 edition"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1060908.jpg", "videogametheme": {"2279": "Comics"}, "videogamegenre": {"2161": "Action Adventure"}, "average": "6.25", "videogamefranchise": {"5735": "Batman"}, "videogameplatform": {"4407": "Xbox 360"}, "usersrated": "4", "poll": {}, "videogamecompilation": {"69022": "LEGO Batman: The Videogame"}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1060908_t.jpg", "description": "User Summary<br/><br/>A compilation bundle pack of Pure and LEGO Batman: The Videogame.<br/><br/>"}, "89013": {"videogame": {"70676": "Star Wars: The Clone Wars"}, "statistics": {}, "name": "Star Wars: The Clone Wars & Tetris Worlds", "videogamemode": {"2422": "Local Multiplayer"}, "videogameversion": {"77264": "US Xbox edition"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1031475.jpg", "videogametheme": {"2455": "Abstract"}, "videogamefranchise": {"4846": "Star Wars"}, "average": "5.5", "videogamegenre": {"2147": "Action"}, "videogameplatform": {"4442": "Xbox"}, "usersrated": "10", "poll": {}, "videogamecompilation": {"70676": "Star Wars: The Clone Wars"}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1031475_t.jpg", "description": "User Summary<br/><br/>A compilation bundle pack of Star Wars: The Clone Wars and Tetris Worlds.<br/><br/>"}, "89014": {"videogame": {"74692": "Forza Motorsport 2"}, "statistics": {}, "name": "Forza Motorsport 2 & Marvel: Ultimate Alliance", "videogamemode": {"2313": "Cooperative"}, "videogameversion": {"77266": "US Xbox 360 edition"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic809474.jpg", "videogameseries": {"5976": "Forza Motorsport"}, "videogametheme": {"2456": "Driving"}, "videogamefranchise": {"4855": "Marvel"}, "average": "6.5", "videogamegenre": {"2339": "Action RPG"}, "videogameplatform": {"4407": "Xbox 360"}, "usersrated": "8", "poll": {}, "videogamecompilation": {"74692": "Forza Motorsport 2"}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic809474_t.jpg", "description": "User Summary<br/><br/>A compilation bundle pack of Forza Motorsport 2 and Marvel: Ultimate Alliance.<br/><br/>"}, "89015": {"videogame": {"74692": "Forza Motorsport 2"}, "statistics": {}, "name": "Viva Pi\u00f1ata & Forza Motorsport 2", "videogamemode": {"2422": "Local Multiplayer"}, "videogameversion": {"77267": "EN/EU Xbox 360 edition"}, "average": "6", "videogameseries": {"5976": "Forza Motorsport"}, "videogametheme": {"2319": "Cartoon"}, "usersrated": "1", "videogamegenre": {"2470": "Life Simulation"}, "videogameplatform": {"4407": "Xbox 360"}, "poll": {}, "videogamecompilation": {"74692": "Forza Motorsport 2"}, "description": "User Summary<br/><br/>A compilation bundle pack of Forza Motorsport 2 and Viva Pi\u00f1ata.<br/><br/>"}, "89016": {"rpgitemversion": {"77275": "Softcover Version"}, "poll": {}, "name": "Monsters of the Savage Snow", "rpgproducer": {"19989": "Don Bessinger"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1475607.png", "usersrated": "0", "average": "0", "statistics": {}, "rpg": {"1788": "d20 System / OGL Product (D&D 3.0 Compatible)"}, "rpgcategory": {"2108": "Sourcebook (rules/options to enhance play)"}, "rpggenre": {"961": "Fantasy"}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1475607_t.png", "description": "Monsters of the Savage Snow: The Wanderers Guild Guide to Frostbound Organisms<br/><br/>From the back of the Book<br/>Amid the stark, unforgiving landscape of ice and snow one can hardly be expected to find an abundance of life, yet that is precisely what I, Lord Sir Edric Morgandale, legendary explorer, nobleman, and Wanderers Guild Member in Good Standing have accomplished!

Each tile consists of a 36 square grid that depicts various special locations within the city. Players start by controlling a single temple that allows them to train either Priests or Zealots. Priests can preach to gain followers based on the population of each spot on the game board; however, they are vulnerable to be assassinated by an opponent's Zealot. Priests can also establish new temples throughout the city, which can also be desecrated and destroyed by an opponent's Zealot. Unit movement is dictated by multiple dice rolls equal to the number of temples you control.<br/><br/>Players can use divinity cards from their hand to change the outcome of certain scenarios. More powerful units like Prophets and Avatars can only be created by using specific divinity cards.

The game is played with 6 riders and 6 different colours and a derny, multiple coloured dice and a track of 60 squares long.<br/><br/>In 2012, Anki added a Print and Play update. The main differences are:<br/><br/>a) There are 9 racers now, like real in keirin races, instead of six. However, for a shorter game, you can drop some riders (the ones with the highest numbers). Playing with 6, 7 or 8 riders is ok.<br/><br/>b) You do not need a lot of different coloured dice. You just need as many dice as racers, that is, nine dice.<br/><br/>c) The motorbike now takes part in the game, even if it's just in the first turn.

Artifacts are usually described as extremely powerful items. Rather than merely another form of magic equipment, they are the sorts of legendary relics that whole campaigns can be based on. The traditional artifact has always had very high power levels and almost always been for use by high-level characters only.<br/><br/>Thus, there is the problem. Artifacts are one of the most interesting game mechanics in the d20 system and everyone loves them, but why do you have to be level 10 before ever getting one? This is where Synergy Artifacts come in.<br/><br/>Synergy Artifacts are designed to be available for low-level characters. As the character gains levels in his/her classes, the Synergy Artifact item becomes more powerful. Furthermore, Synergy Artifacts comes in sets. When a character uses multiple items from the same Synergy Artifact set, the items grant additional powers and abilities.<br/><br/>"}, "89247": {"rpg": {"524": "d20 System / OGL Product (D&D 3.5 Compatible)"}, "statistics": {}, "name": "Treasures of Malevolent Magic", "rpgproducer": {"34856": "Nathaniel Olsen"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1565666.png", "usersrated": "0", "rpgitemversion": {"77690": "PDF version"}, "average": "0", "rpggenre": {"961": "Fantasy"}, "rpgcategory": {"2108": "Sourcebook (rules/options to enhance play)"}, "poll": {}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1565666_t.png", "description": "From publisher blurb:<br/><br/>Ever wanted to try out Malevolent magic items?

Limited spell casting abilities, terrible fighting capabilities, and a list of Bardic songs that even Paula Abdule would not like. Time to change it all with our new book: UNORTHODOX BARDS!<br/><br/>This 45 page pdf contains 5 New Bard classes for you to use in any d20 fantasy world. Each Class comes as a full 20-level write-up that will give you a new respect for the Bard (each one comes with a detailed background, new abilities, and new progression charts). That's not all though -- included in this book are 2 new Bard Prestige Classes, and over a dozen artifacts for your d20 fantasy campaign. Cover your ears Simon Cowell, because these Bards are going to take you for a wild ride!<br/><br/>This book details contains the following:<br/><br/>     The Minstrel - With their Enchanted Instrument in hand, they can create over a dozen spell-like effects with just a song. This is in addition to their normal Bardic Music!<br/>     The Skald - With their magical abilities at hand, they can inscribe runes onto objects and people for different magical effects.<br/>     The Soothsayer - Fortunetellers, tarot readers, and diviners -- the Soothsayer is known by a number of names.<br/>     The Spellsinger - Many sages theorize that the true language of magic is music. Certain races such as the elves also believe in the link and have used the power of music for centuries in their most potent magic. A few very talented musicians have dedicated their lives to studying the link between music and magic -- the Spellsinger is such an individual.<br/>     The Troubad&rsquo;war - A Troubad&rsquo;war is the ultimate contradiction to himself, often referring to himself as a lover and a fighter. While some Troubad&rsquo;wars fight for the purity of love or to prove their worth to a damsel they are eager to impress, there are those that have also loved and lost. These Troubad&rsquo;wars know there is a dark side to love and use their abilities to gain vengeance against whatever has caused them to lose their loves, or maybe they are just itching for a good fight.<br/>     The Muse (Prestige class) - The Muse is a Bard who specializes in enhancing the abilities in others, for good or bad. He does this through his Bardic Music, with songs passed down by the Bards of old. The Muse&rsquo;s greatest strength is the ability to Inspire others; but unlike the common Bard, the Muse&rsquo;s music is far more potent.<br/>     The Protectorate (Prestige class) - The Protectorate is a Bard who specializes in aiding his allies in time of need. He does this by learning powerful Bardic Songs that have been passed down from the heavens. <br/>     Baubles and Urus of Ancient Power (Artifacts) - 15 artifact items that can be infused into your existing items for devestating effects!<br/>     Johansson&rsquo;s Song (Artifacts) - This artifact set consists of an Amulet, Cape, and Ring. Each one has fantastic powers, but as the set becomes more complete, the wearer gains even more powers. But the true powers and abilities only surface if the wearer is a Bard! <br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>"}, "89250": {"rpg": {"1788": "d20 System / OGL Product (D&D 3.0 Compatible)"}, "poll": {}, "name": "Unorthodox Clerics", "rpgproducer": {"33532": "The Le'"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic878064.jpg", "usersrated": "1", "rpgitemversion": {"77693": "PDF version"}, "average": "6", "statistics": {}, "rpggenre": {"961": "Fantasy"}, "rpgcategory": {"2108": "Sourcebook (rules/options to enhance play)"}, "rpgseries": {"3097": "Unorthodox Series"}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic878064_t.jpg", "description": "From publisher blurb:<br/><br/>Question: Do you love d20 and do you love Clerics?<br/>Question: Do you want a cleric that gives you a little extra something?<br/><br/>Maybe we have what your looking for in our new product: UNORTHODOX CLERICS!

The Le Games is here to help with your latest book, Unorthodox Pirates! Inside this fantastic book you will find six new pirate classes with full flavor descriptions and stats for a full 20-levels. That's not all! This product also includes Pirate familiars, twelve Pirate themed magic items, gun rules for your fantasy campaign, and a pirate theme song from our friends at Bailey records!<br/><br/>The core classes in this book includes: <br/><br/>     Freebooter: The Freebooter is the quintessential pirate. Freebooters are excellent sailors, trained from their youth in the art of living, surviving and fighting at sea. Not even the scurvy dogs that make up the civilized navies can out-climb a Freebooter in the rigging, and no man alive can best them in melee while standing on a slippery, pitching ship's deck. Freebooters are the people that society has forgotten or cast away because their race, class, or conduct was seen as unsuitable. <br/>     Ghostly Buccaneer: They say in whispers at dockside taverns and on the late watches of the seafarers that dead men tell no tales. They speak of deals that desperate sailors have made with the evils spirits deep within the blackness of the ocean depths. Most sane watermen dismiss these as mere legend and hearsay, but a few of the more grizzled and wary sailors know the truth. <br/>     Privateer: Some men and women are simply born to lead, and their natural charisma almost always carries them to positions of power. Privateers are the pirate equivalent of these people. A Privateer usually captains their own ship and crew, and possesses a letter of marquee that acts as a kind of diplomatic immunity, giving official sanction to their raiding and plundering. Privateers embody many different leadership styles - some lead from the front, while others are content to let lackeys do all the work - but they all share a common obsession with reputation and fame. <br/>     Ravager: The Ravager is the kind of pirate that other pirates fear. Whenever there is murder and slaughter to be done, the Ravager always takes his work a little too far - and enjoys it a little too much. Ravagers are the classic landlubber's idea of a pirate: fierce, horrible, bloodthirsty savages. They have no need for mercy, fine words, or logical reasoning, and they enjoy nothing more than wading into battle with a sword in each hand and another clenched between their teeth. <br/>     Swashbuckler: Some pirates live only to kill, rape, plunder and drink themseles stupid. Swashbucklers look down on these scurvy dogs; for a Swashbuckler, it's all about style. This type of pirate knows that it's not what you do, it's how well you do it. Theirs is the sword-whirling, chandelier-swinging, over-the-top school of combat, and they never pass up an opportunity to show off their skills or spin a tale of their latest daring escape. When a swashbuckler enters the room, he or she commands attention - especially from the opposite sex. <br/>     Wavelord: The Wavelord is at one with the ocean. He is a living conduit for the power and magic of the sea, a kind of nautical druid. Old sea dogs whisper that, &quot;Whenever a child is born at sea and the mother cannot keep it, it is tossed overboard to be claimed by the waves. Years later a Wavelord will emerge - a man with saltwater for blood, who can make the currents change at his command.&quot; So say the old-timers (to anyone who will listen). <br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>And much much more.<br/><br/>"}, "89261": {"rpg": {"1788": "d20 System / OGL Product (D&D 3.0 Compatible)"}, "poll": {}, "name": "Unorthodox Ranged Combatants", "rpgproducer": {"33532": "The Le'"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic878058.jpg", "usersrated": "0", "rpgitemversion": {"77712": "PDF version"}, "average": "0", "statistics": {}, "rpggenre": {"961": "Fantasy"}, "rpgcategory": {"2108": "Sourcebook (rules/options to enhance play)"}, "rpgseries": {"3097": "Unorthodox Series"}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic878058_t.jpg", "description": "From publisher blurb:<br/><br/>Dragons, Barbarians, and Giants -- what do they have in common?

That's right, Unorthodox Wizards has arrived! Inside this fantastic book you will find five new Wizard class (full 20 level), and five new Feats: <br/><br/>     Crimson Mage: Simple words and gestures can be mightier than a battleaxe, and red can be the most powerful color of all. There are some wizards who have found a way to incorporate this powerful color into their very words and gestures. A Crimson Mage is just that kind of wizard &ndash; he is fanatical, obsessed, and devoted to a single color: red. He worships it, and sits in circles with their fellow Crimson Mages to talk about the reddest things they have ever seen. They prepare their spells from red spellbooks, dress in red clothes, and usually dye their hair red. While one might say they are odd, none can deny their power over things that are red in color. <br/>     Horse Flesh Devourer: Hailing from savage tribes where horses are prized and valued for their military advantage and social prestige, the Horse Flesh Devourer is a deviant, a rebel, and an outcast. They eat the flesh of the horse gifted to them by their tribe in order to force a supernatural metamorphosis. The Horse Flesh Devourer becomes a tauric creature, combining the lower half of a horse with the upper half of a man. Most Horse Flesh Devourers are slain as quickly as possible during their slow transformation process; however, those who complete the process become feared and respected, given deference reserved for powerful warlords. When they gain control over the very thing the tribes value, their station and importance become immeasurable, making them a force not to be contended with. <br/>     Immortal Requient: The Immortal Requient is one who has sold his soul so that he may live forever and plumb the depths of all arcana. However, upon completion of the transaction, they find they have bargained for more than they could handle. Once a normal wizard, he now finds himself devouring the very thing he does not have, and in hopes that one day, he may regain what he lost. If an Immortal Requient chooses not to devour souls, he will waste away to nothing and eventually expire. In the interest of his own survival, he feeds. <br/>     Necropimp: The Necropimp is a necromancer who animates the corpses of dead humanoids and forces them to sell their bodies in mindless prostitution. There are very few professions that are more reviled than the Necropimp, who combines business practice, immorality, and arcane training to become the must gruesome of pimps. The only thing more despicable than a Necropimp is one who uses children for his business, but thankfully, there have been no such Necropimps, as they must even have some sort of code of ethics. Thank the gods there are no pedophile Necropimps. <br/>     Pact Wizard: In exchange for power, the Pact Wizard&rsquo;s fiendish patron extorts an incredible amount of control over the Pact Wizard, often denying spells and abilities on a whim, or to punish an impudent Pact Wizard. This denial of power is often used to push the fiendish patron&rsquo;s agenda on the Pact Wizard. Eventually, the ultimate cost is paid to the patron: the Pact Wizard&rsquo;s soul. <br/>     Feats: Unorthodox wizards comes with five brand new feats to trick out your caster -- Elemental Breath, Decipher Scroll, Magic Mushroom, Sonic Book, Spontaneous Missile. <br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>user comment<br/>Interior layout is landscape while cover is standard Letter.<br/><br/>"}, "89284": {"poll": {}, "name": "Das M\u00fcllspiel", "playingtime": "0", "minplayers": "6", "boardgamemechanic": {"2080": "Area Control / Area Influence"}, "yearpublished": "1989", "usersrated": "0", "maxplayers": "14", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic890147_t.jpg", "average": "0", "statistics": {}, "boardgamepublisher": {"4": {"name": "(Self-Published)"}}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic890147.jpg", "boardgameversion": {"77754": "German version"}, "maxplaytime": "0", "boardgamecategory": {"1021": {"name": "Economic"}}, "age": "14", "minplaytime": "0", "description": "An educational game for groups about pollution. 1/3 of the players are farmer and the others are industry-people.

The root of the problem is an arcane machine built to protect the city 300 years ago by extraplanar creatures called modrons. Now the machine has run out of fuel, and it's up to the PCs to obtain more by visiting each of the four elemental planes. Can they get the machine working again before the city of Porthaven is wiped from the earth? Drop the latest miniadventure for D&amp;D v3.5 by Mark A. Jindra into any coastal area with mountains nearby. Suitable for four 18th-level characters.<br/><br/>Adventure Preview<br/><br/>Three hundred years ago, the coastal town of Porthaven was built on a site that was advantageous for trade but both geologically and meteorologically unstable. A volcano in the nearby mountains threatened to erupt and destroy the town, and earthquakes, tidal waves, and hurricanes were common. But the doughty townsfolk stayed and rebuilt after each disaster, determined to make the town prosper.<br/><br/>Eventually, a powerful sorcerer named Khyber Mercane saw the carnage that the unending natural disasters wrought and decided to do something constructive. Recalling that he had once met some extraplanar creatures called modrons that favored order over chaos, he contacted them to see whether they could help. After discussing various options, Mercane struck a deal with the creatures: They would build and maintain a machine that would keep the town safe from the chaos of natural disasters, and in return, the townsfolk would keep a library of knowledge to pass along to them every year.<br/><br/>The machine worked, and the volcanic activity ceased. The harsh windstorms that had previously blown through the valley softened to mild breezes, and the high waves that had battered the shoreline shrank to harmless ripples before reaching the coast. The earthquakes that were once common occurrences no longer shook the land. Even the seasons seemed to even out so that the temperatures rarely reached uncomfortable extremes. The crews of ships that had been through rough seas and stormy weather found the calm waters and friendly people of the town a welcome sight, as did many weary travelers along the coast. The town grew rapidly and soon became a bustling city.<br/><br/>For the first seven years, the modrons sent a representative to gather the accumulated knowledge and service the machine annually. Then the visits abruptly stopped. Khyber left to see what had happened to the modrons, but he never returned.<br/><br/>Worried about the safety of the untended machine, the clerics of Wee Jas built a temple around it to shield it from unauthorized visitors. But though this tactic did safeguard the machine, it also removed it from the people's sight, and eventually it was forgotten by most of the populace. Only a handful of the church's priests still know of its existence, and fewer still know its true purpose. Sister Mara, the most senior member of the clergy, has been studying the history of the machine, and she has recently rediscovered its purpose and a few details of its maintenance. Realizing that the machine had not been refueled for many years, she warned the townsfolk that disasters might be imminent, but they scoffed at her dire predictions.<br/><br/>A few weeks ago, the machine ran out of fuel and shut down entirely. Shortly thereafter, Porthaven experienced its first earthquake since the activation of the machine, but the tremor was small and went unnoticed by most of the city's residents. The next sign that the city had lost its protection was much more obvious. This morning, the nearby volcano suddenly erupted, spewing forth a hellish river of molten rock and fire. The sky grew as black as night, and fiery ash began to rain down from the heavens. The earth beneath the city heaved upward, toppling structures and feeding the fires caused by the flaming debris. A great wall of water from the sea laid waste to Porthaven's docks, leaving many seagoing vessels and coastal homes either at the bottom of the bay or in ruins in the city's streets.<br/><br/>Currently, the city officials are busy evacuating the residents through several magic portals that are normally used only by merchants and adventurers. But these few portals cannot accommodate everyone, and the rivers of lava will reach what is left of the town in only a few short hours.<br/><br/>User comment:<br/><br/>Not to be confused with Force of Nature<br/><br/>"}, "89344": {"statistics": {}, "name": "Math Blaster Episode I: In Search of Spot", "videogamemode": {"2149": "Single-Player"}, "videogameversion": {"77847": "North American DOS edition"}, "average": "6.5", "videogameseries": {"8912": "Math Blaster"}, "videogametheme": {"2264": "Science Fiction"}, "usersrated": "1", "videogamegenre": {"2147": "Action"}, "videogameplatform": {"4714": "DOS"}, "poll": {}, "description": "Box Information:<br/><br/>Oh no!

We've all seen the industry go from simple and light to the extensive and complex. A combination of simplicity and realism is the challenge we saw and accepted.<br/><br/>We aimed our game at emphasis on the 'role playing' aspect of the genre. Believing this 'in character' play to be easiest when the adventurer is designed to player desires, we established a fresh approach to character generation - no dice rolling! We've tried to capture the realism of characteristics being in total accord with character background. Melanda offers the subjectivity, in both play and game mastering, which will provide maximum opportunity for role playing to happen freely. With minimum concentration on numbers, which distract players from 100% character identification, we feel that GM's can expect players to ask only what their hero would ask, decide only what their hero would decide, and take action only as their hero would act.<br/><br/>The Land of Mystery comes to you as a complete package in a single booklet. Everything you need to design a campaign, create characters, and manage play is included between these covers. In separate packages, gaming aids such as character cards, pre-designed scenarios, and additional non-player entities will be released as produced.<br/><br/>As you will soon discover, magic is everywhere in Melanda in a myriad of forms. Within these pages you will be exposed to approximately a half dozen different magic systems for players and non-players to learn and utilize (as well as some means for tapping into the Black Arts and dabble in Elemental Control for the power hidden within)! The magic is basic but complete enough so that the only limit to what is possible in your campaign is imagination.<br/><br/>If we had to use one word to sum up our hopes for the game and its affect in your life, it would be subjectivity. All systems and charts are designed as guidelines only -- we hope you will alter them to fit your personal likes and dislikes! In this and all Melandan concepts we welcome your input, not only to your players but to us and all of Melanda; so, please feel free to write and tell us of the cleverness of Melandians at your end. We may share your suggestions with others.<br/><br/>Alas, Melanda awaits..mystery laden. So, to you, the bold, we offer gratitude, greetings, and good luck as you embark on a future of surprise and wonder.<br/><br/>"}, "89362": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic932101.jpg", "poll": {}, "boardgamedesigner": {"4886": {"name": "Rhea Zakich"}}, "statistics": {}, "yearpublished": "1995", "maxplayers": "6", "boardgameartist": {"3": "(Uncredited)"}, "boardgamepublisher": {"738": {"name": "Talicor"}}, "maxplaytime": "60", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic932101_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "60", "boardgamecategory": {"1115": {"name": "Religious"}}, "description": "The Ungame - Catholic Version is a redesign of the classic Ungame packaged with the updated standard Ungame board and two new decks of cards with questions specifically meant to start discussion on the Catholic faith of the game participants.<br/><br/>Players roll the dice and travel around the game board answering questions along the way.

Each realm can be morphed, damaged, and manipulated by magical spells that are cast by either the player or an enemy wizard. The player's character can attack with his sword and cast spells when in a realm. Spells consist of the following types: Attack, Defense, Terrain Modifier, Personal Modifier, Transformations, and Creature Summoning.<br/><br/>Magical spells are created through the use of spell components. Start with one Aspect. Mix in a specific ratio of Powders, Jewels, Stones, and Candles. Then say the magic word. This creates a base of a magic spell that can be duplicated and used in battle. If the wrong formula is used, the player will die in one of many horrific deaths. The key is to solve the formulas by information both gathered in game and in the game's manual. The manual contains a mostly empty table where players can write-in all the spells they make in the game. Later, the player can modify his spells to customize them by slightly altering their formula to enhance one or many attributes.<br/><br/>Also the player can speak and trade with a variety of NPCs located across Earth.

So, this is a racing game composed of four kind of cards: <br/>1. Road Cards destinated to make modular circuits.<br/>2. Object Cards representing special items that drivers can use for themselves or against the others, these are the well known shells, mushrooms, stars,...<br/>3. Character Cards for each driver with his atributes: speed cards, first card, brake, attack and defense.<br/>4. Speed Cards; each driver has a set of four speed cards to determinate the movements and aceleration.<br/><br/>Drivers must move using Speed Cards. If you want play Child Mode you can use a D6. <br/>D6 is needed for attack and defense.<br/><br/>-Preparing the game<br/><br/>First you have to build a circuit and decide the total amount of laps to win the race. There must be at least one finish line and one special Road Card  where objects appear. Then each player chooses a driver (or randomly) and takes his Speed Cards. In the Driver Card is determined what is the first Speed Card to use (that is the acceleration rate somehow).<br/><br/>-The Race<br/>Player generally moves using a Speed Card that limits the maximun positions he can move on. He'll choose to move more or less, but allways within that limit.<br/><br/>-Start:<br/>Put Drivers on/beside finish line. Then each driver takes a random Speed Card and moves in turn. The first will be the<br/>younger player and then continue clockwise.<br/><br/>On the road:<br/>Each turn, every player must choose secretly one Speed Card; then Speed Cards are shown and drivers move.<br/><br/>Get objects:<br/>In the circiut there will be a Road Card with the object icon. When drivers pass on this, they get a Object Card from the Object Card deck. Drivers only can have one object card.<br/><br/>Attack/defense:<br/>When drivers are moving they could attack other players using Object Cards. The result is decided using Drivers Attack/Defense values, Object Attack/Defense values and a D6. Something like this:<br/><br/>Bowser attacks Mario with a Red Shell:<br/>  Bowser attack + Red Shell attack + D6 &gt; Mario defense + D6<br/><br/>Total attacker value must be greater than total defender value; if equal then nothing happens. Some objects could be used to add more Defense value (shells, bananas,...)<br/><br/>If the attack is successful the loser goes off the road, loses any Object Card and must wait one turn without moving. Then He must start using Drivers first Speed Card.<br/><br/>-Dangerous Curves:<br/>Some Road Cards have a special values like -1,-2,+1. These cards decrease Driver movement unless the Driver has a brake value bigger than 0. <br/>So if a player must go through a -2 curve and has a +1 brake value the movement decreases is only -1. Anyway if the driver finish a movement in a curve this decrease is not applied.<br/><br/>"}, "89406": {"videogame": {"77268": "Midway Arcade Treasures"}, "statistics": {}, "name": "Satan's Hollow", "videogamemode": {"2149": "Single-Player"}, "videogameversion": {"78004": "Arcade version"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1562305.png", "videogametheme": {"2148": "Fantasy"}, "usersrated": "3", "average": "6.33333", "videogamegenre": {"2167": "Shooter"}, "videogameplatform": {"4781": "Arcade"}, "poll": {}, "videogamecompilation": {"167735": "Midway Arcade Origins"}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1562305_t.png", "description": "Satan's Hollow is a shoot 'em up arcade game released by Bally Midway in 1982, later converted in 1984 to Commodore 64. The gameplay draws similarities to Galaga from Namco. The player must destroy the flying formations of gargoyles in order to pick up pieces of a bridge that must be built over a river of lava. As the game progresses, the gargoyles begin to throw exploding eggs, along with rocks that can destroy bridge sections; the player also occasionally faces Satan's disembodied head that floats around the screen. In addition to firing rockets at the enemies, the player can use a shield that will destroy any enemy touching it. However, this shield can only be used for a short time before it must shut down to recharge. Gargoyles will sometimes attempt to steal a ship from the player's reserve lives, similar to Galaga.<br/><br/>Once the bridge is completed, the player can immediately cross it to face Satan. Destroying him scores bonus points based on the number of waves completed to that point, and also upgrades the rocket launcher. The player then resumes the battle against the gargoyles and must start building a new, longer bridge in order to fight Satan again. The sky darkens on later waves, making it more difficult to see the enemies.<br/><br/>The game was included on the Midway Arcade Treasures collection, rereleased in 2003 for Playstation 2, Gamecube and X-Box, and in 2004 for Windows.

Each player selects a character who uses a unique gameplay mechanism to give them an edge in combat. Take control of 18 different characters, from a fire elemental, an ocean guardian and her panda familiar, a space-bending trapper, a shadowy assassin, and more! Each character's play style requires new strategies, but uses the same foundational tactics, making a new character easy to learn, but challenging to master.<br/><br/>Players move along a seven-space-long board, trading blows and attempting to strike the opponent, using attacks formed by combining a character's unique styles and abilities with a set of basic cards that all characters share. There is no hidden information: you always know exactly what cards the opponent holds, just not the ones they'll choose!

His turn continues until he draws a card that matches a card number already flipped or draws a Queen or King which cannot be placed in his array.  He discards the unusable card and his opponent can then choose to pick up that card and begin his turn by placing it into the appropriate spot in his array.  Jacks are considered wild and can be replaced by the appropriate number if they are already placed in one's array.  The first person to fill all of his spots with face-up cards wins the round and will play the next round with one less spot (so after round 1, for example, he will only use 9 cards).

Both characters can jump and run faster than normal by getting certain boosts.<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;Desert Demolition&quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "89493": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1164189.jpg", "poll": {}, "boardgamedesigner": {"3541": {"name": "Cameron Browne"}}, "statistics": {}, "yearpublished": "2010", "maxplayers": "3", "boardgameartist": {"3541": "Cameron Browne"}, "boardgamepublisher": {"1001": {"name": "(Web published)"}}, "maxplaytime": "20", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1164189_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "20", "boardgamecategory": {"1009": {"name": "Abstract Strategy"}}, "description": "Each player has thirteen hexagonal tiles, each of which has a unique arrangement of pointers to various edges.
