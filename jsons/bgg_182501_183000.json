High Strategic level gaming at the Army/Army Group level, and with unit production. No dice, no cards, nothing random used - you've only got yourself to blame if you lose! Two joined vinyl water-resistant maps: the Pacific (~21&quot; x 14&quot;) and European/African/MidEast (~27&quot; x 20&quot;) theatres are included.<br/><br/>For 2-6 players, the belligerents include Germany, Britain, France, Italy, the Soviet Union, China, Japan, the USA and major neutrals such as Poland, Yugoslavia, Greece, Turkey, Sweden and Spain. In the two-player game, it's the Axis (Germans, Italians, Japanese) against the Allies (USA, Britain, Soviets, France, China). There are three counter sheets of 88 5/8&quot; counters each representing the land, air, naval and logistical units, mostly at the Army/Army Group level (infantry, tank/panzer, mech, shock, guards, SS, etc), with specialty units such as marines and paratroops. Air units represent tactical attack aircraft and strategic aircraft, including heavy strategic aircraft (B-29) and even atomics. The naval forces are flotillas of fighting ships, carrier task forces, landing craft and convoys. Logistical units play a major role in the game - no supplies, no attacks.<br/><br/>Turns are quarterly, and proceed over two maps, one of Europe/North Africa/Middle East and one of Asia and the Pacific, with the US East Coast on the former and the West Coast on the latter. Units appear historically, but their entry can be altered when the players change historical invasion dates. There are many political rules that reflect the limits that the historical leaders faced.<br/><br/>As units are eliminated, they enter replacement pools and it is then up to the players to decide what branch gets priority in production: will the German player seek panzers for the Eastern Front, supplies for North Africa, or Tactical aircraft vs Britain? The allies can share resources up to a point, and lend lease may be all that keeps the Soviets from folding early.<br/><br/>Players are free to try alternate strategies. Should the Germans hit Turkey to open a back door to the Middle East, the Suez and Baku? Should the US hit Japan hard early, or put the emphasis on stopping Germany? Should Japan join Germany's crusade against bolshevism or put the emphasis on naval victories?<br/><br/>Weather is incredibly important, affecting every turn except Summer. Winter slows everything down - except the Soviets.<br/><br/>There are no dice in this game! Hitler didn't roll the dice, and neither did Stalin, Roosevelt, Hirohito, Mussolini or Churchill. They made decisions and lived with them. You'll do the same. There are no randomization of effects at all. Each of your actions determines your fate, as does your opponent's. There is no dice to bail you out or ruin your plans - you have only yourself and your opponent to blame for that!<br/><br/>Yet each game takes a different path. It is possible for Italy to be the last Axis player standing. It's possible for the Allies to knock Japan out a year early or liberate Eastern Europe without the Soviets. The Soviets might just take all of Europe. All of these outcomes happened in actual games. Each turn requires you to plan ahead, to anticipate enemy moves and your counter to them.<br/><br/>"}, "182530": {"boardgamedesigner": {"71730": {"name": "Christopher Batarlis"}}, "statistics": {}, "bgaccessoryversion": {"282396": "First edition"}, "description": "Secrets of the Lost Tomb Core Adventurers Miniatures include each of the character adventurers that are in the 1st Edition Core Set of the game.

On the surface, it looks much like the world you and I live in. Just beneath that surface, in the shadows, rages an ancient conflict between supernatural factions who all seek dominion over the Earth and control over the souls of humanity. Supernatural creatures stalk the night, hiding among, and sometimes hunting, humans.<br/><br/>In recent months a group of demons, the Mastim, have shifted their approach to collecting human souls. While the majority of the Mastim caste seeks worship through the use of false gods, the recent return of the Ilu has led to brutal conflict inspiring some of the more forward-thinking Mastim to change their approach to seeking followers. This small group of Mastim, known as the &ldquo;Sales Department,&rdquo; has abandoned the standard M.O. of the Mastim in favor of directly marketing damnation to the human masses.<br/><br/>War Stories: The Arrangement focuses on one such deal, where the demon Gallu seeks to finalize a pact with a desperate human woman, Sheri Bronson.  Tragedy has touched Sheri&rsquo;s life and she pins all her hopes on Gallu to resolve her problems.

The Light Cutter includes the remodeled upper deck for sea travel and a lower slave pen deck for transporting slaves recycled from The Raven Airship. By redesigning the upper deck with a lower page count and removing the lower cargo deck, this reduces the cost of a print on demand version of this product (which will be available after proofing). If you need a print on demand merchant ship with a cargo hold, River Barge can suit your needs.<br/><br/>The Light Cutter is intended for use in blackpowder fantasy and pirate settings as it is armed with four cannons. The slave pen lower deck is used to transport slaves or criminals making it a target for pirates who may or may not know slaves are on board, figuring it to be a cargo vessel, liberators who believe in freedom for all men and pushed by conscience to act on their beliefs, or criminals trying to free their friends from the law.<br/><br/>Adventure hook for use with this map:<br/><br/>Cutting across the Ocean:  The light cutter is running slaves across the ocean in dangerous shipping lanes full of pirates. The group can be hired as guards on the ship who need to fend off these pirates. If they didn&rsquo;t know the &ldquo;cargo&rdquo; was slaves they may even plan to mutiny against the merchant that hired them.<br/><br/>When pirates attack the ship, the adventurers need to decide whether to abide by the contract they signed with the merchant and protect the ship or parley with the pirates and attempt to switch sides.<br/><br/>The group could also be playing as the pirates instead, expecting a cargo hold full of trade goods and find out the &ldquo;cargo&rdquo; is slaves. They could also be liberators trying to free the slaves or criminals trying to bust their friends out of incarceration.<br/><br/>If the slaves are freed, they could be criminals who then try to take over the ship. They could play nice instead and be dropped off on shore by their liberators. Then the group hears rumors of escaped convicts committing atrocious crimes.<br/><br/>The adventurers may even be hired to investigate these crimes and then come face-to-face with the people that they freed, monsters that they let loose upon the world a second time. The criminals recognize them and tell them that they will let them go without harm, a favor for a past favor. The group can slink away or they can choose to put a stop to these criminals and return them to their original fate.<br/><br/>"}, "182573": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2691227.jpg", "poll": {}, "boardgamedesigner": {"14": {"name": "Richard Garfield"}}, "statistics": {}, "yearpublished": "2015", "maxplayers": "6", "boardgameartist": {"68126": "Markus Erdt"}, "boardgamepublisher": {"47": {"name": "Queen Games"}}, "maxplaytime": "35", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2691227_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "20", "boardgamecategory": {"1022": {"name": "Adventure"}}, "description": "This first expansion to Treasure Hunter adds new Treasure Tiles, interesting new Hero Cards, tougher goblins, and Dog Cards to chase those pesky goblins off!<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": {"282477": "English/German first edition"}, "name": "Treasure Hunter Expansion 1: Goblin's Loot", "playingtime": "35", "boardgamemechanic": {"2041": "Card Drafting"}, "age": "8", "boardgameexpansion": {}, "usersrated": "81", "expands": {"182189": {"name": "Treasure Hunter"}}, "average": "7.00062"}, "182574": {"rpg": {"9041": "Mutants & Masterminds (3rd Edition)"}, "poll": {}, "name": "Road Kill", "rpgproducer": {"68453": "C.

That is, it&rsquo;s designed to look, feel and actually play like a nintendo classic.<br/><br/>As with most video games, the goal is to defeat a &ldquo;FINAL BOSS&rdquo;. But with every hero aiming for the same goal, only one can actually go home with the glory. Players will battle against both in-game enemies and each other as they race to the final battle.<br/><br/>Giant &ldquo;QUEST&rdquo; cards make up the board of Super Hazard Quest. Each card features a unique room in the adventure, complete with obstacles (or HAZARDS) that stand in a hero&rsquo;s way. &ldquo;ITEM&rdquo; cards, along with each hero&rsquo;s innate ability help them navigate from card to card. Whenever an unexplored part of the Quest is reached, a new Quest card is drawn from the deck and connected. Thus, the level builds as the heroes explore.<br/><br/>Hidden among the Quest cards are boss rooms, including the game&rsquo;s Final Boss. But ordinary Items won&rsquo;t be enough. A SECRET CODE, well protected by other bosses, is the only weakness of the game&rsquo;s Final Boss. That said, heroes must first find a Boss, earn a Code and then be the first to reach the Final Boss. It&rsquo;s all the fun of multi-player retro gaming without ever having to blow into a cartridge!<br/><br/>We are live on kickstarter: <a target='_blank' href='https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/949523363/super-hazard-quest' rel='nofollow'>https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/949523363/super-hazard-...</a><br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": {"282487": "First edition"}, "name": "Super Hazard Quest", "playingtime": "60", "boardgamemechanic": {"2040": "Hand Management"}, "age": "10", "boardgameexpansion": {}, "usersrated": "9", "average": "7.33333"}, "182582": {"poll": {}, "name": "Yokai: Yamata No orochi", "playingtime": "30", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": {"2041": "Card Drafting"}, "yearpublished": "2015", "boardgameexpansion": {}, "usersrated": "1", "maxplayers": "4", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2652281_t.png", "average": "7.5", "statistics": {}, "boardgamepublisher": {"23013": {"name": "Miciosegone Games"}}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2652281.png", "boardgameversion": {"282488": "First edition"}, "maxplaytime": "30", "boardgamecategory": {"1002": {"name": "Card Game"}}, "expands": {"181997": {"name": "Yokai"}}, "age": "8", "minplaytime": "10", "description": "Yokai: Yamata No Orochi is the first expansion for the card game Yokai.

Together with your fellow colonists, you attempt to settle the distant Planet Irata with the so-called help of a mule-like machine you all learn to hate. But for now, he's all you've got. Well, him and your fellow colonists. I wouldn't count on their help, though &mdash; not unless there's profit. Good luck. You'll need it.<br/><br/>In M.U.L.E. (abbreviated from &ldquo;Multiple Use Labor Element&rdquo;), players claim plots of land and install mechanical robots (M.U.L.E.s) to work on them. M.U.L.E.s produce goods that colonists can use, sell for profit, or stockpile for (hopefully) even more profit:<br/>- Smithore is a metal that cannot be used by players directly, but can be sold to The Store. The Store uses Smithore to manufacture M.U.L.E.s. Since players need M.U.L.E.s to produce their Goods, they must sell Smithore to increase their production.<br/>- Crystite is a luxury mineral with a highly volatile price. It is not needed for anything on Planet Irata, but can be exported to other worlds for great profits (unless stolen by Pirates &ndash; you have been warned!)<br/>- Food is needed by players to take Development Actions, such as Assaying Lands or Installing/Refitting M.U.L.E.s.<br/>- Energy is needed to power M.U.L.E.s. You'll know the value of Energy when you lack it.<br/><br/>There will be unexpected surpluses and shortages of different goods, causing market prices to fluctuate. Players must plan ahead while maintaining flexibility to change their plans as all kinds of &rdquo;fun&rdquo; planetary disasters hit them. Interaction between colonists is highly opportunistic: they will gladly help you if there's profit in it for them. Or maybe not. You'll get to see the true colors of your friends by playing M.U.L.E. with them. The most cunning settler and trader receives fame, fortune, and the honorary title of First Founder!

Contend with myriad problems plaguing the Final Empire &mdash; rampaging koloss, disease, social unrest, even the heroes of the novels &mdash; and with every step jockey for the Lord Ruler's favor. At the end of the story, will you rise to power and prestige &mdash; or fall in ruin and disgrace?<br/><br/>Mistborn: House War is a semi-cooperative, resource-management game set during the events of the first Mistborn novel. Three to five players assume the roles of various factions and must work together to solve the &quot;Problems&quot; facing the Final Empire. In order to solve these problems players must expend a certain combination of resources, but in return they receive Favor from the Lord Ruler.<br/><br/>Each round, players produce resources (food, money, prestige, skaa, warriors, and atium) in different proportions and combinations based on their faction. You can convert between different resources to get something that is missing, but in the long run the players must work together, pooling their resources, to succeed.<br/><br/>There are four tiers of &quot;Problems&quot;; at the start of each turn a problem is added to the board in the corresponding column and each pre-existing problem moves up one tier. If a problem passes tier 4, than it is said to &quot;Erupt&quot; (a reference to the novel) and it causes various problems for the players, such as increasing the level of &quot;Unrest&quot; or giving players &quot;Disfavor&quot;. The main part of gameplay is the negotiation between players to solve these problems. Anything except Favor gained in previous turns can be negotiated: resources, Personality cards (which can have a variety of effects), out-of-game favors, etc.<br/><br/>The game can end in two ways, either the Unrest reaches 8 or a special problem card (Vin) is resolved. If she is not defeated and is allowed to erupt she increases the Unrest by 4. If the players are able to defeat Vin, then the player who has the highest amount of Favor wins. If the Unrest reaches 8, then the rebellion occurs and the player with the least Favor (the faction furthest from the Lord Ruler) wins.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "3", "boardgameversion": {"282565": "English first edition"}, "average": "6.60714", "name": "Mistborn: House War", "playingtime": "120", "boardgamemechanic": {"2040": "Hand Management"}, "age": "13", "boardgameexpansion": {}, "usersrated": "14", "boardgamefamily": {"22184": "Admin: Unreleased Games"}}, "182627": {"rpgitemversion": {"325426": "English hardcover version"}, "statistics": {}, "name": "Das Schwarze Auge Regelwerk (5.

Players take on the roll of a Medieval general, building their army, maneuvering them on the battlefield, and issuing special orders. The game uses unit cards to represent units in the players&rsquo; armies which are arranged on a unique play mat to represent the flanks, front line, and reserves of the army.<br/><br/>Players construct their armies by selecting up to eight unit cards representing fifteen different types of Medieval units. Each unit has a listed maximum army limit, type, equipment, and combat stats for their differing &ldquo;status levels.&rdquo; Players also select a hand of eight &ldquo;orders cards&rdquo; which can be issued to units during gameplay to move them to a new location on the player&rsquo;s play mat or gain one-time buffs.<br/><br/>After players alternate deploying their armies on their play mats, combat occurs in a series of turns divided into an Orders phase (when orders cards are played and resolved) and Combat phase (when combat is resolved).<br/><br/>During the Orders phase, players simultaneously play any orders cards they wish to use face-down on the unit receiving the orders. Progressing in a set pattern determined by the play mat, these orders are then sequentially revealed and resolved.<br/><br/>Combat between units on the board is resolved following the same sequential pattern as resolving orders cards. To resolve combat, players add up the relevant combat skill for the current unit and any situational modifiers (such as the type of unit opposing a unit, whether the unit is charging that turn, or any orders cards affecting the unit) to determine how many dice to roll. Each die rolled which meets or exceeds the target unit&rsquo;s current &ldquo;defense&rdquo; value for its current status level scores one &ldquo;hit&rdquo; and permanently reduces that unit&rsquo;s status by one level. As each unit&rsquo;s equipment listed on its card gives certain bonuses against certain unit types, often while imparting a penalty against other unit types, players can gain an advantage by careful use of their deployment and orders to pit their units against their optimal opponents. Units decrease in effectiveness as they take hits, becoming weaker in both offense and defense. Each unit has three status levels ranging from undamaged to heavily damaged. Any unit reduced by hits beyond its third status level is removed from the game.<br/><br/>The winning player is the one with the last unit remaining on the board.<br/><br/>"}, "182631": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2971899.jpg", "is_expanded_by": {"200427": {"name": "Star Realms: Admiral's Tabletop"}}, "poll": {}, "boardgamedesigner": {"4113": {"name": "Robert Dougherty"}}, "statistics": {}, "yearpublished": "2015", "maxplayers": "2", "boardgameartist": {"92581": "Vito Gesualdi"}, "boardgamepublisher": {"18852": {"name": "Hobby World"}}, "boardgameintegration": {"147020": "Star Realms"}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2971899_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "20", "boardgamecategory": {"1002": {"name": "Card Game"}}, "boardgamehonor": {"34501": "2015 Golden Geek Best 2-Player Board Game Nominee"}, "description": "Colony Wars is a deckbuilding game in the Star Realms series which is both a standalone box set for two players (featuring an 80-card trade deck, as in the original) and an expansion for the base Star Realms set that allows it to be played as a four-player game.<br/><br/>In Colony Wars, as in Star Realms, players will start with a fleet (deck) of 10 basic ships, and can spend Trade to acquire more powerful ships and bases from a central trade row of 5 cards.

It takes the concept behind a prestige class and makes it more accessible. Prestige archetypes have the special abilities of the prestige class spread out over the full range of 20 levels, and gain the special prestige identity from level one; there is no need to plan ahead to meet prestige prerequisites and wait for several levels before getting to the meat of the prestige class.<br/><br/>Here are nine archetypes for playing noble characters, the bloodline scion (sorcerer), chevalier (cavalier), eldritch noble (wizard), enlightened noble (investigator), hierarch cleric (cleric), monster scion (summoner), noble virtuoso (bard), renaissance man (magus), and scheming noble (rogue).<br/><br/>All the archetypes in this book are based on the same prestige class, noble scion; an adventurer born with a silver spoon. At the top of the hierarchy of her homeland, she nevertheless decided to put it all to risk as an adventurer&mdash;but she&rsquo;s not giving up her social advantages or creature comforts.<br/><br/>The noble scion archetypes are meant for players who wish to play rich and endowed from birth, characters with status and monetary advantages, balanced by weaknesses in other areas. The noble comes to best advantage in a campaign involving nobles in conflict, such as a throne war. But the archetypes are made to be balanced with normal characters, and can be used to play a noble among commoners, first among equals in a party.<br/><br/>This book is written for the Porphyra setting, and has notes on what it is like to be a noble from different lands of that campaign world. But most of the rules are generic, it can be used in any game setting if you only take the time to decide upon three skills that are considered especially noble in each region of the game world.<br/><br/>"}, "182643": {"rpg": {"7240": "Choose Your Own Adventure"}, "statistics": {}, "name": "You Are a Superstar", "rpgproducer": {"3": "(Uncredited)"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2635719.jpg", "usersrated": "0", "rpgitemversion": {"282588": "Softcover edition"}, "average": "0", "rpggenre": {"947": "Childhood"}, "rpgcategory": {"2136": "Solitaire Adventure"}, "poll": {}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2635719_t.jpg", "description": "From publisher blurb:<br/><br/>The reader has always been pretty good in sports but nothing special.

Unlike most arcade fighting games, which use a traditional joystick and buttons, the arcade version is played using console-style controllers, which are designed so that players who are not used to arcade sticks can get into the game more easily. The game is planned to focus more on action, as opposed to the more technical gameplay of Tekken, allowing both hardcore and casual fans to enjoy it. As such, players can perform various techniques taken from the Pok&eacute;mon series, such as special moves and Mega Evolutions (which can be built up from attacks using a 'Resonance Gauge').

Two to seven aspiring detectives step into the shoes of Doctor Watson, working alongside the detective Sherlock Holmes to try to solve a series of so far unpublished cases directly extracted from Doctor John H. Watson's diaries. Those who accept the challenge relive the adventures of the crime-solving duo, visiting each of the locations where the inquiries were made. Following the trail, each clue brings players closer to solving the case.<br/><br/>The objective of the game is to immerse yourself in the Victorian world depicted in each story. Visit the right places, decipher the clues, and above all find the path that leads you to solve the mystery before anybody else. Victory goes to the player who accurately uses the deductive reasoning so famously and ingeniously implemented by the hero of 221B Baker Street.<br/><br/>The game consists of a series of separate cases, each of which raises a number of questions that each player tries to solve before anyone else. To do this, once the case and the questions have been read aloud, players proceed to visit the locations where the clues are located. Each location cannot be accessed by more than one player at any one time, so if two or more players want to go to the same place, the player who travels there the fastest (i.e., he who uses the largest number of Carriage Tokens) gets the clue, forcing the others to go to a different location. Once every player has a destination, they proceed to read in secret the clue that was discovered at that location. They can discreetly take any notes they deem appropriate. Once this is done, the cards are returned to their place so that others can read them in later turns.<br/><br/>This procedure is repeated during each turn until one player believes he has found the solutions to the case; at that time, he must go to 221B Baker Street to check if his answers are correct. If all the answers are correct, the player wins; if they are wrong, he will have lost and retires from the game, and the game continues.<br/><br/>Each detective will also have the invaluable assistance of a number of Sherlock Holmes' allies, above all, the good Dr Watson and of course of the detective himself.<br/><br/>&bull;&bull;&bull;<br/><br/>Watson &amp; Holmes es un juego de deducci&oacute;n basado en la admirable obra de Sir Arthur Conan Doyle. <br/>Cada uno de los dos a siete jugadores adoptar&aacute; el papel del Dr. John Watson y acompa&ntilde;ar&aacute; a Sherlock Holmes en la investigaci&oacute;n de una serie de casos in&eacute;ditos hasta ahora, intentando resolver cada uno de ellos antes de que el gran detective le brinde la soluci&oacute;n correcta. Para ello, cada jugador deber&aacute; sumergirse en la Inglaterra victoriana e ir recopilando, en distintas localizaciones, las pistas extra&iacute;das de los diarios del propio Dr. Watson, con el fin de encajarlas correctamente por medio de la l&oacute;gica deductiva.<br/><br/>Y, todo esto, sin demorarse por el camino, pues solo aqu&eacute;l que resuelva el misterio antes que sus contrincantes se ganar&aacute; la confianza del genio de Baker Street.<br/><br/>El juego se compone de una serie de casos independientes, cada uno de los cu&aacute;les plantea una serie de interrogantes que cada jugador tratar&aacute; de resolver antes que los dem&aacute;s.<br/>Para ello, una vez se lean el caso y las preguntas en voz alta, los jugadores proceder&aacute;n a visitar las localizaciones donde las pistas se encuentran. Cada localizaci&oacute;n no puede ser visitada por m&aacute;s de un jugador, de manera que, en caso de que dos o m&aacute;s quieran dirigirse a la misma, el jugador que m&aacute;s corra (utilizando un mayor n&uacute;mero de fichas de Carruaje) obtendr&aacute; la pista correspondiente, debiendo los dem&aacute;s dirigirse a otras localizaciones.<br/>Una vez cada jugador obtenga un destino, todos proceder&aacute;n a leer en secreto la pista aparejada a la localizaci&oacute;n correspondiente, pudiendo tomar discretamente las anotaciones que estimen pertinentes. Hecho esto, se devolver&aacute;n las cartas de pista a su lugar para que los dem&aacute;s puedan leerla en rondas posteriores.<br/>Este procedimiento se repetir&aacute; cada ronda, hasta que un jugador crea haber hallado la soluci&oacute;n al caso: en ese momento, habr&aacute; de dirigirse al 221B para comprobar si sus respuestas son acertadas.<br/>En caso de ser todas correctas, habr&aacute; ganado. En caso de error, habr&aacute; perdido y se retirar&aacute; de la partida.<br/>Cada detective contar&aacute;, adem&aacute;s, con la inestimable ayuda de una serie de aliados de Sherlock Holmes, as&iacute; como con la del propio detective y, sobre todo, la del buen Dr. Watson.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": {"283861": "English first edition"}, "average": "7.54921", "name": "Watson & Holmes", "playingtime": "75", "boardgamemechanic": {"2012": "Auction/Bidding"}, "age": "12", "usersrated": "797", "boardgamesubdomain": {"5496": "Thematic Games"}, "boardgamefamily": {"7510": "Characters: Sherlock Holmes"}}, "182695": {"rpgitemversion": {"282663": "First Printing"}, "rpgseries": {"7938": "Pathfinder Flip-Mat"}, "name": "Pathfinder Flip-Mat: Bigger Basic", "rpgproducer": {"3": "(Uncredited)"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2639584.jpg", "usersrated": "1", "average": "9", "statistics": {}, "rpg": {"356": "Generic / Universal"}, "poll": {}, "rpgcategory": {"2086": "Accessory (dice, maps, screens, cards)"}, "rpggenre": {"173": "Generic / Universal"}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2639584_t.jpg", "description": "From the publisher's website:<br/><br/>Bigger than ever!<br/><br/>A dungeon filled with insidious traps, a magnificent imperial throne room, the citadel of an immortal tyrant&mdash;the possibilities for adventure are endless with Pathfinder Flip-Mat: Bigger Basic.

Each hero also has one or more character reference cards, which show the special abilities for the characters based on the die rolls. Different versions of these cards are available in booster packs, allowing for more customization of your team. Players use these dice to collect energy, recruit new heroes, and battle head-to-head.

There are four different ways to play:<br/><br/>In Trivia Party, one player draws a card and asks a question of another player.  The answering player may choose from questions ranked from 1 (easiest) to 5 (hardest) and gains points equal to the difficulty level on a correct answer.  Incorrect answers gain no points.  After one question, the next player takes a turn.  Players play until the deck is used up or to an agreed total.<br/><br/>Upward Mobility is played similarly, but each player starts off being asked question one and proceeds through the questions to number five, earning the point value for each question answered correctly until he or she answers wrong.  So, for example, if a player answers questions 1,2 and 3 correctly but misses #4, the score would be 6 points.  Like Trivia Party, play continues until the deck is used up or until one player reaches an agreed point total.<br/><br/>In Auction Trivia, each player starts with 25 points.  One player chooses a card and reads the 5-point question.  Players then bid on the card.  The highest bidder then wins the card and tries to answer all five questions on the card, gaining points for each question answered equal to the point value of the questions (for a maximum of 15 points per card).  These points are added to his starting point balance.  The winninbg player then becomes the next auctioneer.  Players are eliminated if their balance drops to zero.  The player with the most points when all cards are used up wins.<br/><br/>In Trivia Poker, score is kept in the same way as Trivia Party.  However, when a player answers a question correctly, he or she keeps the card.  Players try to gain cards to build the best poker hand possible.  When a player gains a sixth card, he or she must discard any chosen card, keeping five cards.  The game ends when all cards are used or when all players hold five-card poker hands.

Each grid section has numbers (1-10) across the top and letters (A-J) down the side.<br/><br/>After deciding who goes first, the first player calls a shot on his opponent&rsquo;s ocean grid, say E7. His opponent must declare a hit if the grid square is occupied by a ship or a miss if it is not. The player that fired marks the grid number on his target control area with a Red bomb if it is a hit or a White bomb if it is a miss. Then the second player takes his turn, with either a hit or a miss being declared by the first player and the results recorded by the second player. Turns are taken until all the ships in one players fleet have been sunk. The five ships have a total of 21 hits.

It should come as no surprise, then, that wizards, witches, and other powerful spellcasters are always on the lookout for new and exciting spells to add to their repertoires. While many spells from the Pathfinder Roleplaying Game Core Rulebook received a facelift and an upgrade in Pathfinder Roleplaying Game: Mythic Adventures, the sourcebook that introduced mythic power to the Pathfinder Roleplaying Game, dozens of spells were left behind. Missing Mythic Magic Volume XVII, and its predecessors, aim to give each and every spell from the core rules a full-fledged mythic upgrade, all the way from A to Z, with a special focus on making mythic spells that feel as over-the-top and larger-than-life as possible.<br/><br/>This installment includes 20 mythic spells, from remove disease to scrying, greater. A mythic repel metal or stone can affect objects of much greater size, and grants much greater control over how they are repelled, including allowing you to make ranged attacks with them. A mythic resilient sphere can be created so that it is not anchored in place, allowing you to roll it about freely, and is much more resistant to damage. A mythic resurrection can not only bring back outsiders, constructs, and undead, it can even bring back those whose souls are unwilling or imprisoned, and a mythic rusting grasp can affect a much wider array of objects, and can even take the form of a 60-ft.-radius burst.

The local villagers at the nearby keep tell of a crazed wizard who once dwelt there. Legends say the wizard could travel beyond the world of men, into the darkest reaches of the hidden worlds.

A wide range of monsters and challenges are involved, so a variety of classes is recommended. The adventure can be &quot;dropped in&quot; to any outdoor wilderness setting whenever the characters make camp for the night.<br/><br/>ADVENTURE BACKGROUND<br/>In ages past, an adventuring wizard named Faloren of Marks roamed the land, fighting evil alongside holy warriors of the Church of Law and Order. Faloren became obsessed with the concept of other planes of existence and devoted his life to exploring the mysteries of the universe. He eventually retired with enough wealth to build a remote wizard's tower on the borderlands and continue his research. In time, he discovered how to open mystical doorways that allowed him to explore entirely new worlds.<br/><br/>To the villagers at the nearby keep, it seemed that the strange wizard had chosen to become a hermit. Before long, folk grew uneasy and began to whisper. After a number of bad omens, failed crops, and strange disappearances, the villagers were certain that Faloren had been tainted by the evil he had once fought. They convinced a band of adventurers known as the Brighton Swords to bring the &quot;dark wizard&quot; Faloren to justice.<br/><br/>The Brighton Swords stormed the tower and a terrible battle was fought. The tower was razed, but the adventurers were slain. Faloren barely survived the encounter and fled deeper into the borderland forest where he hid in the bole of a hollowed oak tree. The villagers at the keep assumed he had been killed in the battle.<br/><br/>In time, Faloren resumed his research into planar travel and eventually opened doorways into small &quot;pocket dimensions&quot; of his own design. However, Faloren lacked the proper ingredients and resources to safely travel between worlds and with each crossing, his mind slowly became unhinged.<br/><br/>Faloren was recognized one day by a huntsman, and word spread among the nearby settlements that he still lived. The local priest led soldiers and a mob of able-bodied men into the woods in search of him. Faloren chose not to kill the misguided soldiers. Instead, he used an ancient spell to shift their life's essence into a thick stand of trees, and this forest later became known as Abbotsfolly Wood.<br/><br/>Paranoid and fearful that stronger enemies might come looking for him, Faloren poured his own life's essence into six brass chimes and hid them among his pocket dimensions. Faloren's madness continued to grow and he eventually lost all knowledge of magic. He became a sneak thief and mad hermit who roamed the countryside with various animal companions and preyed upon travelers. Legends say that Faloren was killed by a band of wandering adventurers and that afterwards, the local faeries took pity on him and laid his bones to rest inside the hollowed oak.<br/><br/>Countless years have past, and Faloren's spell has slowly begun to unravel. A lightning strike recently killed one of the enspelled trees, and one of its largest limbs fell to the ground, just waiting to be picked up by a band of weary adventurers. . .<br/><br/>"}, "182809": {"rpgitemversion": {"282837": "PDF version"}, "poll": {}, "name": "Swamp Dungeon of the Bandit Lord", "rpgproducer": {"6526": "Peter C.

The adventure involves exploration of a dungeon that has been magically transformed into a swampy cave complex. The characters can expect to encounter a wide range of monsters and challenges, so a variety of classes is recommended.<br/><br/>Note: This adventure takes place in Willow Valley, a fantasy sandbox that is fully detailed in the WhiteBox Omnibus published by Barrel Rider Games. Willow Valley is centered around Willow Lake and is home to humans, elves, dwarves, halflings, and other fantasy races. The valley setting can be easily adapted to any fantasy campaign world.<br/><br/>ADVENTURE BACKGROUND<br/>In dark times past, after the great dragon Agathareon fell to the arch-mage Asagrim the Abjurer, the beleaguered folk of Willow Valley were plagued by bandits and raiders. One of the most wicked was the bandit lord Kaven Redblood whose stronghold of Redblood Keep stood atop Tallrock Hill, allowing him to prey on travelers along the Citadel Road.<br/><br/>Kaven's ambition was to crown himself King of Willow Valley, but he knew that the people would eventually rally against him. Therefore, he ventured deep into the Swamps of Sithiss to seek an alliance with the lizardmen tribes who dwelt there. The Sithissian shaman gave Kaven the seed of a sacred cypress tree known as the Heart of Sithiss. The shaman told Kaven that once the seed was planted and nurtured, the lizardmen would honor him as a brother and the very Swamps of Sithiss would come to his aid in times of need.<br/><br/>Kaven's return to Redblood Keep did not go unnoticed by the free folk of Willow Valley. An alliance of Willowford militia, Burrowmoor halflings, and Citadel dwarves laid siege to his stronghold and reduced it to rubble, forcing him to take refuge in the dungeons below.<br/><br/>In desperation, Kaven planted the magical cypress seed in a deep dank cave, hoping its magic would conjure up a Sithissian army to fall upon his enemies. Unfortunately for him, the Sithissians had no intention of honoring their bargain. The seed was cursed with a magic that was designed to transform the very earth into swampland. The moment it was planted, it sucked the life from Kaven and his followers and used this energy to magically transform the caves of Tallrock Dungeon.<br/><br/>Unable to gain access to the dungeons, and having seen no sign of Kaven or his followers for weeks, the Willow Valley alliance grudgingly returned to their homes. Time passed, new threats arose and were vanquished, and the siege of Redblood Keep eventually became a distant memory known only to a few.<br/><br/>Cut off from the world outside, the denizens of Tallrock Dungeon slipped into a magical slumber. But all the while, the magical cypress continued to grow beneath the earth, its magic building as it waited to be unleashed.<br/><br/>Recently, a group of dwarven miners from Stoneaxe Citadel came upon a hidden staircase and a secret entrance into the dungeons of Tallrock Hill. As soon as they opened the door, the tree's magic burst forth upon the land, draining the life force of the dwarven miners and using their energy to revive the swamp creatures who dwelt within its dungeon home. Now, this magic has begun to spread. . .<br/><br/>"}, "182810": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2646171.jpg", "poll": {}, "boardgamedesigner": {"49049": {"name": "Robert Burke"}}, "statistics": {}, "yearpublished": "2016", "maxplayers": "2", "boardgameartist": {"20317": "Kerem Beyit"}, "boardgamepublisher": {"26427": {"name": "Grey Fox Games"}}, "maxplaytime": "30", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2646171_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "20", "boardgamecategory": {"1002": {"name": "Card Game"}}, "description": "An expansion for Robert Burke &amp; Richard Launius' dueling dragon card game, Draco Magi.

But take care that you are not sticked by yourself&hellip;<br/><br/>20 cards with values of 1 to 20. Quite easy card game. The active player plays a card and commends to the next &quot;up&quot; or &quot;down&quot;, which means to react with a higher or lower value. If possible, the player gives the next command to his neighbour. If not, he has to take an additional card. Bad luck, if nobody can react properly - than the first player has to take additional cards. So, recall all played cards. <br/>Winner is the player, who played his last card.<br/><br/>Misd<br/>3-8 Players<br/>Which symbol is missing? Is it missed really? A game for fast thinkers.<br/>Kids will blame you&hellip;<br/><br/>Everything planned?!<br/>For 3-4 players<br/>Is there a plan? Change places? Change Cards? Plan the use of your cards?<br/>Who plans with lack of plans, wins.<br/><br/>Schollenschubser &ndash; Floe pushers<br/>For 2-4 players<br/>Be the first to cross the icy sea over swaying floes to safety. Charity begins at home. Shurely not a game for the kindhearted&hellip;<br/><br/>Schlauraff &ndash; Smartsnatch <br/>For 2-4 players<br/>Use your dice perfectly and get the uppermost points. More than simple but never the same<br/><br/>Just a remark: since the producer delievered us... eh... somewhat insufficient dice (from our point of view...) we ordered better dice, and pass them with every sold box.<br/><br/>And another remark: authors of the games in this box are: Till Meyer, Klaus-Peter Rudolph and H.&amp;W. Fuhr<br/><br/>And another one: there only one language-based game in the box, but for this and all other games we offer an english rulesbook as download. It may need some time, since Christian enjoys his holidays and we want to present you grafics too - not just plain text. :-)<br/><br/>"}, "182821": {"rpgitemversion": {"282853": "PDF Version"}, "poll": {}, "name": "Behemet", "rpggenre": {"961": "Fantasy"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2639903.jpg", "usersrated": "0", "rpgproducer": {"16713": "Robert Neri, Jr."}, "statistics": {}, "rpg": {"1239": "Dice & Glory: The Ultimate Role-Playing Game"}, "average": "0", "rpgcategory": {"2108": "Sourcebook (rules/options to enhance play)"}, "rpgseries": {"11389": "Bizarre Beasties"}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2639903_t.jpg", "description": "User summary<br/><br/>This is a free 1-page PDF file describing the the Behemet, a humanoid CR 7 monster.<br/><br/>"}, "182822": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2738500.jpg", "poll": {}, "boardgamedesigner": {"86902": {"name": "Matt Engel"}}, "statistics": {}, "yearpublished": "2015", "maxplayers": "4", "boardgameartist": {"18995": "Marco Primo"}, "boardgamepublisher": {"3": {"name": "Rio Grande Games"}}, "maxplaytime": "0", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2738500_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "30", "boardgamecategory": {"1002": {"name": "Card Game"}}, "description": "A new promo card for Dominion releasing in 2015.

Along the way you will encounter a variety of different symbols, most of these will require you to make a random roll on a chart or two. Some of these symbols will allow you to gain treasure, while others may require you to avoid a deadly trap or fight a monster. Your gained treasures and suffered wounds are recorded on a simple character sheet, which in some ways is similar to the character sheets that you would expect to find with a typical table top role playing game.<br/><br/>Unlike a typical table top role playing game, no &ldquo;game master&rdquo; is required.

During the day they hide themselves behind the masks of their previous victims.<br/><br/>The children have to find out who these monsters are, but they are not entirely alone. In desperation the children can take comfort with what toys the orphanage has, and may draw abilities from the toys themselves. They can shine the light of the magic projector to discover the true identity of the target, shield themselves during the night with their teddy bear, save themselves from the monster in the closet by feeding it their limberjack or hide under the blanket to shield them from all danger, but beware not all toys were placed there for the benefit of the children. The boogeymen can bring their own sackcloth doll to throw off the magic projector and make others perceive an innocent child as a boogeyman.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, the children can&rsquo;t always rely on toys being there. The orphanage is short, even with many children now missing, and so every round the kindly, but out of his depth, caretaker sees to it that what toys are available are taken back and then given out at random.<br/><br/>Orphanage of Fear uses the traditional day night cycle of Werewolf. During the night the Boogeymen choose a child to drag into their realm of existence, along with the toy they are holding, to feed, and during the day the entire group debates and argues about who the impostors are before nominating a child or children. If only one child is nominated they can drag another child with them to the closet door. The player with the most votes is sent into the closet and gets eaten, along with their toy, by the monster inside. The game continues until either all the boogeymen are eaten by the closet monster at which point the children win or there are an equal amount of children and boogeymen at which point the boogeymen win.<br/><br/>"}, "182949": {"statistics": {}, "name": "1999: Hore, Mita koto ka!

The demo box takes you through a shorter, tighter version of the &quot;Caught in the Crossfire&quot; mission included in the full game &mdash; it's the quickest way for new players to learn how to play.<br/><br/>Catalyst Game Labs is giving the Shadowrun: Crossfire - Demo Box to select gamers at Gen Con 2013 in mid-August.<br/><br/><br/>The shadows of the Sixth World have every kind of danger you can imagine: ultra-violent gangers, flesh-eating ghouls, mages that summon spirits from toxic waste, backstabbing corporate raiders, hard-nosed police officers, and even dragons. You don't have much &mdash; mainly your guts, your wits, and your friends &mdash; but maybe that's enough. Between you and your teammates, you can sling spells, hack the Matrix, talk a tiger out of his stripes, and bring down a charging ork from a hundred yards away.
