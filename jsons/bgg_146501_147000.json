As temporal agents, you and your team will be sent into the bodies of beings from different worlds or realities to successfully complete the missions given to you. Failure is impossible, as you will be able to go back in time as many times as required.<br/><br/>T.I.M.E Stories is a narrative game, a game of &quot;decksploration&quot;. Each player is free to give their character as deep a &quot;role&quot; as they want, in order to live through a story, as much in the game as around the table. But it's also a board game with rules which allow for reflection and optimization.<br/><br/>At the beginning of the game, the players are at their home base and receive their mission briefing. The object is then to complete it in as few attempts as possible. The actions and movements of the players will use Temporal Units (TU), the quantity of which depend on the scenario and the amount of players. Each attempt is called a &quot;run&quot;; one run equals the use of all of the Temporal Units at the players' disposal. When the TU reach zero, the agents are recalled to the agency, and restart the scenario from the beginning, armed with their experience. The object of the game is to make the perfect run, while solving all of the puzzles and overcoming all of a scenario&rsquo;s obstacles.<br/><br/>The base box contains the entirety of the T.I.M.E Stories system and allows players to play all of the scenarios, the first of which &mdash; Asylum &mdash; is included. During a scenario, which consists of a deck of 120+ cards, each player explores cards, presented most often in the form of a panorama. Access to some cards require the possession of the proper item or items, while others present surprises, enemies, riddles, clues, and other dangers.<br/><br/>You usually take possession of local hosts to navigate in a given environment, but who knows what you'll have to do to succeed? Roam a med-fan city, looking for the dungeon where the Syaan king is hiding? Survive in the Antarctic while enormous creatures lurk beneath the surface of the ice? Solve a puzzle in an early 20th century asylum? That is all possible, and you might even have to jump from one host to another, or play against your fellow agents from time to time...<br/><br/>In the box, an insert allows players to &quot;save&quot; the game at any point, to play over multiple sessions, just like in a video game. This way, it's possible to pause your ongoing game by preserving the state of the receptacles, the remaining TU, the discovered clues, etc.<br/><br/>T.I.M.E Stories is a decksploring game in which each deck makes anything possible!<br/><br/>Official FAQ<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": {"335763": "Czech first edition"}, "average": "8.01565", "name": "T.I.M.E Stories", "playingtime": "240", "boardgamemechanic": {"2023": "Co-operative Play"}, "age": "12", "boardgameexpansion": {}, "usersrated": "11476", "boardgameaccessory": {"211205": "T.I.M.E Stories: Alternate character art pack"}, "boardgamesubdomain": {"5496": "Thematic Games"}, "boardgamefamily": {"35759": "T.I.M.E Stories"}}, "146509": {"rpgitemversion": {"216647": "PDF Version"}, "poll": {}, "name": "Attack of the Frawgs", "rpgproducer": {"69787": "Catherine DiNardo"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1747711.jpg", "usersrated": "1", "average": "2", "statistics": {}, "rpg": {"10737": "Dungeon Crawl Classics Role Playing Game"}, "rpgcategory": {"2084": "Scenario / Adventure / Module"}, "rpggenre": {"961": "Fantasy"}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1747711_t.jpg", "description": "From Publisher Website:<br/><br/>When strange creatures prey on the innocent, the meek must become the hunters!<br/><br/>Panic is mounting in the isolated settlement of Sagewood!

The 4 player cardgame is related to Whist and Bridge. In addition to the general rules, each region has its own set of minor rules. The games dates +/- 1950.<br/><br/>The game is played with 52 cards (a deck without jokers). Each round starts with the player left to the dealer making the first bid. There are many different bids possible, due to the different rules per region. However, the most commen bids are (in order):<br/><br/>- Pass: the player does not make a bid<br/>- Rik: score 8 (with a mate)<br/>- Piek: score exactly one (alone)<br/>- Miser&eacute;: score 0 (alone)<br/>- 9 or 10 alone: score 9 or 10 (alone)<br/><br/>After the bidding ends (players can over-bid eachother), the winning player announces the following:<br/><br/>- requested ace: the player who won the bid requests an ace. This must be an ace that he does not have himself. The player who does have this ace will be his mate for the current round. If the bid is a &quot;rik&quot;, then the 2 players together have to score 8 and the other 2 players try to prevent this. If the player plays alone (for example &quot;piek&quot; bid), he does not request an ace and just plays alone versus the 3 others.<br/>- choose the trump (&quot;troef&quot;): the player who won the bid also choses one colors to be the trump. The trump cards are worth the most for this round (similair to &quot;Hearts&quot;).<br/><br/>The round starts with the player left to the dealer playing his first card. The next player has to play a card of the same color. If that is not possible he can play any other card. The player with the highest card in a matching color scores. However, a &quot;troef&quot; card tops all other colors. Meaning players can &quot;steal&quot; a turn by playing a &quot;troef&quot; card.

The value of the time bomb countdown is also affected.<br/><br/>SPACE ROCKS also includes a subsidiary game called Space Battle. This enables the player to fight time bombs and enemy ships without worrying about rocks, that is to say, there are no asteroids in Space Battle. Although we imagine it is up to everybody to make their own judgement, this feature seems to us to be more use in providing an opportunity for practicing control of your space ship rather than meaning to be a serious game.<br/><br/>"}, "146523": {"statistics": {}, "name": "Frenzy (TRS-80)", "videogamemode": {"2149": "Single-Player"}, "videogameversion": {"216671": "TRS-80 edition"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1773308.png", "videogametheme": {"2466": "Other"}, "usersrated": "0", "average": "0", "videogamegenre": {"2314": "Arcade"}, "videogameplatform": {"5930": "TRS-80 Model I/III"}, "poll": {}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1773308_t.png", "description": "Catalog Description<br/><br/>This is an excellent arcade game from Bill Mansell who wrote SEAWOLF . . . Stated succinctly, there appears on the screen five levels of scaffolding there are a number of bricks that have to be collected by the player who is in control of a little figure dashing around the scaffolding. This would be relatively simple but for the fact that the player must also contend with a number of monsters, contact with which is fatal. Lest you think the game is restricted to collecting bricks and fighting monsters, it is possible for the player to dig holes in the path of the monster, the latter fall through and for a little while they are out of the way of the industrious brick collector. Control is with the four arrow keys.<br/><br/>The game starts on level one and progresses upon the collection of all the bricks. The game has a certain number of bricks to it in the sense of the method of play, but broadly it is a skill game in the sense that when a monster reaches a ladder he may or may not use it. Just as SEAWOLF made a pleasant change from space arcade games, FRENZY is equally unique. The title of this game is particular well chosen as the player has to be very fast on his feet to do well. Sound is of course supported, and the only question is whether it is the player or the monsters that achieve the frenzied condition first.<br/><br/>"}, "146524": {"statistics": {}, "name": "Delta Tau One", "videogamemode": {"2149": "Single-Player"}, "videogameversion": {"216672": "TRS-80 edition"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1772769.png", "videogametheme": {"2658": "Aliens"}, "usersrated": "0", "average": "0", "videogamegenre": {"2314": "Arcade"}, "videogameplatform": {"5930": "TRS-80 Model I/III"}, "poll": {}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1772769_t.png", "description": "Catalog Description<br/><br/>At first sight this appears like a fast version of Invaders, but there is a lot more to it than that. The mission objective of the player is to penetrate alien controlled sectors of space, destroying all positions and allowing the Galactic Fleet to occupy the area. The aliens come at you in a similar orientation to Invaders, but not in a similar way. They attack you in a haphazard, random manner from all directions. The galaxy is split up into sectors. You travel through these by way of either (at the discretion of the player) a hyperwarp control or, if you have destroyed all of the aliens in that particular sector, you are automatically taken on to the next one. The first sector is different to the others with eight alien fleets in it which you have to destroy. The following sectors have one fleet in each sector but the sectors get harder to occupy as one progresses, as each sector has a more powerful alien fleet in it. You start the game with four Galactic Empire ships and four units of hyperwarp energy. One of the latter will be dissipated if you go from sector to sector. A bonus Galactic Empire is awarded for each 10,000 points. You also get a bonus ship at the beginning of each sector. You attain further hyperwarp energy for each 10,000 points . . . In the second, third and fourth sectors the aliens are equipped with Photon torpedoes which will destroy you if they hit. After the four sectors the aliens fire torpedoes at different speeds, although the faster they are the smaller the chance is of them destroying you if they hit. A nice touch is that the last three aliens in every fleet are tough little beggars and will stop at nothing to eliminate you.<br/><br/>Delta is supplied on tape but can be transferred to disk without problem.

This one is hard. A simple description does not really give credit to the software for it is a real fun game. On the other hand it is very difficult to bring it to a successful conclusion. If a game is too difficult, then it loses its appeal - too easy and it is boring. This game is played on the screen on which is displayed various railway tracks and four stations. Going round the tracks are five trains. Tracks may be connected to others by way of about 10 sets of points. The speed of the trains may be altered and the points may be controlled, thus the direction of the trains is under your command and the purpose is to get four of the trains into stations. We say four because the fifth is a &quot;rogue&quot; train - a runaway train - and you have to get all of your other trains out of the way. You cannot control it. Our difficulty in describing the game really arises because, although it is a simple game in conception, it is a difficult one for playing. The graphics are excellent (particularly the title one). Your skill is judged by time. Assuming that you do not have a crash then a player who can park all of his trains in the station in a lesser time than another is the winner.

After a certain distance through space -- depending upon his rank at the time -- he will arrive at the first starbase, dock and report in, saving a record of his achievements, or otherwise, to disk or tape. If all goes well and he is sufficiently skilled he will progress through the ranks of SUb-Lieutenant, Lieutenant, Lieutenant-Commander, Commander, Captain and finally, Commodore. So far as is known, no-one has achieved the latter rank, including the author. The higher the rank, the greater the length of time during transits between starbases and the more frequent the contacts with the enemy.<br/><br/>The above is a not uncommon, even perhaps rather mundane, description of a space flying/fighting game. What makes Interdictor Pilot the fantastically interesting and fascinating pastime that it is, is the way in which the author has built on the basic theme. For instance, for a TRS-80, we think that the graphics are a little short of miraculous. Actually this is probably not too surprising because Interdictor Pilot is written in machine code and occupies the full 16K. As an example of the graphics . . . the large section in the middle entitled &quot;Vision Screen&quot; is the pilot's view into space. When leaving or arriving at a starbase a three dimensional tunnel appears, through which the pilot must navigate. When leaving he is, of course, taking off from zero velocity, and is therefore nicely aligned, hence a few touches of the controls here and there will keep him on the straight and level out of the tunnel. When arriving at a starbase, however, the position is drastically changed. The opening of the tunnel is displayed and it is for him to manoeuvre himself so that he not only flies into it, but also along it. In view of the fact that the aircraft is proceeding at a very fast speed, this small part of the game is no light achievement on its own. Normally, however, as we have said, the vision out through the screen is of space and this is really most amazingly realistic. The heavens seem to proceed across the screen almost exactly as one would imagine in real life.<br/><br/>Interdictor Pilot comes with what are effectively two separate manuals. The first is a short page or so prepared by Molimerx on how the program is loaded and the idiosyncracies of it when used on Tandy Model I and III machines. This section is complete with instructions for a very quick demonstration flight. The main part of the manual is a fully illustrated and document written in &quot;real time&quot;. It assumes that you are a novice pilot that has just been given your first Interdictor Mark II and it takes you through the craft description of both the Interdictor Mark I and the newer Mark II, plus the theory and practice of the deflectors, propulsion, stabilisers, Saturn array, Lewis array, weapons systems, cockpit display and light speed drive. The next section of the manual goes through, in great detail, the cockpit display and this is followed by a description of the controls and their operation. Craft types and Sortie format are described, followed by a section of combat advice, a description of the starbases and finally the use of the simulator. A Sortie, incidentally, is made up of the launch, the transit, which includes the light speed jumps and encounters with the enemy, and finally the recovery at starbase.<br/><br/>What more can you say? Interdictor Pilot is written by a serving RAF navigator and in our estimation sets new standards for micro-computer game software.<br/><br/>"}, "146543": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1752909.jpg", "poll": {}, "boardgamedesigner": {"1062": {"name": "Till Meyer"}}, "statistics": {}, "yearpublished": "2014", "maxplayers": "4", "boardgameartist": {"17414": "Christian Opperer"}, "boardgamepublisher": {"550": {"name": "Spieltrieb"}}, "maxplaytime": "40", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1752909_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "40", "boardgamecategory": {"1016": {"name": "Science Fiction"}}, "description": "In Willkommen auf Allofall (&quot;Welcome to Allofall&quot;), up to four stranded space travelers try their luck escaping the horrors of the planet &quot;Allofall&quot;, either in a cooperative or competitive version as the players prefer.<br/><br/>The aim of the game is simple: Board on your miniature mining vehicle, the &quot;Rollator MK-V&quot;, leave the ship, and get to the landing point of your shuttle on the opposite side of the game board before it leaves again.

Each player takes on the role of an admiral, commander or captain whose command could include a single ship or even a fleet of 20 or more vessels. The core game (&quot;Edition 74&quot;) has seven scenarios to choose from, everything from a small, fast and furious encounter between two frigates to a strategic action involving a total of 35 ships-of&ndash;the-line.<br/><br/>A game turn equates to a &frac12; hour watch on the day of battle. In each turn, players will play cards to execute sailing manoeuvres such as tacking, wearing or changing sail configuration in order to put their ships into position for devastating broadsides or even rakes on the enemy vessels.<br/><br/>In larger engagements ships are grouped together in squadrons and usually form a &ldquo;Line of Battle&rdquo;, a formation that provides the commander with the most control over his fleet. Using Admiral's Order cards players signal general commands to their squadrons ranging from &quot;Form a Keel Line&quot; and &quot;Wearing in succession&quot; to &quot;Prepare for Close Action&quot;. Keeping the ships in formation and effectively deploying the fleet in the heat of battle while also retaining the initiative is the main challenge for a commander.<br/><br/>Occasionally, ships will engage each other in brutally destructive Close Quarter combat.

Through a clever use of grappling hooks and boarding crews it is possible to overcome the enemy's defenses to take the ship as the ultimate prize.<br/><br/>All scenarios can be played by two players, but most also provide the option to split command between two players per side in the base game or four players using the Trafalgar expansion. Play time depends on the scenario. While an engagement between two frigates should last no more than two hours, fighting the whole Battle of Trafalgar will take up a weekend.<br/><br/>The game is produced in a small, limited edition and comes in a handcrafted linen-bound box, including a wooden presentation box with 74 (or 60) handcrafted, wooden ship models.

Three factions vie for control of this corrupt new world and everything within it. You are a mercenary known as a &quot;freelancer&quot;, here to profit off the conflict, to make a name for yourself &ndash; but ambition alone isn't enough. A network of seedy contacts will assist you in undertaking the dangerous missions necessary to bolster your rep. Whether it's hiring henchmen to carry out your dirty work or plotting with secret schemes, you'll let nothing stand between you and your squalid goals.<br/><br/>In Infamy, players find that nearly anything can be bought for the right price. Players attempt to win the game by being the first to reach 15 Infamy points or by reaching the highest reputation level in any one of three factions: the Harada Cartel, the Trust Megacorp, or the PKD Militia. The core of this auction and influence game is the &quot;Pay to Play&quot; mechanism in which players must sacrifice bidding power in order to place any bids at all. Spend too much time bidding against an opponent, and your currency will dwindle &ndash; but if you refuse to bid, you'll be forced to watch your opponent acquire all those things that only the criminal underworld can deliver.<br/><br/>Here at the end of the world, where everyone and everything has its price, there is but a single ambition that endures: Infamy.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "3", "boardgameversion": {"216727": "English first edition"}, "average": "6.96777", "name": "Infamy", "playingtime": "60", "boardgamemechanic": {"2012": "Auction/Bidding"}, "age": "13", "boardgameexpansion": {}, "usersrated": "346", "boardgamesubdomain": {"5497": "Strategy Games"}, "boardgamefamily": {"8374": "Crowdfunding: Kickstarter"}}, "146560": {"poll": {}, "name": "Make A Word", "playingtime": "0", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": {"2035": "Roll / Spin and Move"}, "yearpublished": "1965", "usersrated": "1", "maxplayers": "4", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1748786_t.jpg", "average": "2", "statistics": {}, "boardgamepublisher": {"272": {"name": "Philmar"}}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1748786.jpg", "boardgameversion": {"216728": "Philmar First Edition"}, "maxplaytime": "0", "boardgamecategory": {"1041": {"name": "Children's Game"}}, "age": "7", "minplaytime": "0", "description": "Each player places their coloured pawn on the corner of the board that matches their colour.

If the &lsquo;pawn&rsquo; lands on a letter, the player takes a matching letter from the letter tiles. Should the pawn land on a Gold Star he may take any letter he wishes; but if the pawn lands on a Black Spot the player must return a vowel card from those he has won back to the general pile; if he has not yet gained a vowel, he must owe it and return it when he obtains one.<br/>The object of the game is to form words from the tiles collected.

It should be decided beforehand the number of words (say six) and the first to do so being the winner.<br/><br/>It is also a game which may be played with enjoyment by much older children.

It&rsquo;s a game meant to encompass a wide range of superhero settings, and Stark City is just such a setting. It is both a source of inspiration and a home for all of those diverse ICONS adventures to comfortably take place, a framework to tie them together, and a springboard for your imagination. From the streets of the downtown Silver District to the ultra-modern Telsa Industrial Park, from the wealthy Platinum Coast to the seedy dives of Geartown, you&rsquo;ll find endless opportunities for taking the ideas found in this book and transforming them into stories of your own, because Stark City is ultimately about your heroes and their stories, an additional player to add to the ensemble cast of your ICONS game.<br/><br/>As a very special bonus: Steve Kenson has written an accompanying city/setting building toolkit for ICONS -called ICONIC Settings. Partly inspired by the city building rules in the Dresden Files RPG, the ICONIC Settings rules allow the players to tie setting creation into character generation and devise aspects that are tightly incorporated into their own setting.<br/><br/>"}, "146563": {"rpgitemversion": {"216750": "PDF version"}, "poll": {}, "name": "Defy the Prophecy", "rpgproducer": {"41480": "Ade Smith"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1747918.jpg", "usersrated": "0", "rpgsetting": {"23429": "Stark City"}, "average": "0", "statistics": {}, "rpg": {"4630": "ICONS"}, "rpgcategory": {"2084": "Scenario / Adventure / Module"}, "rpggenre": {"171": "Action / Adventure (Superheroes)"}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1747918_t.jpg", "description": "From publisher blurb:<br/><br/>Superheroic fun for the ICONS game system in the Stark City setting<br/><br/>Something is awry in Stark City.

Items are in your hand. You may use most of them but some have a cost you must pay to use them.<br/><br/>But in this post apocalyptic survival is not easy. Each turn you must eat and drink.  You can get wounded or contract diseases that players with good medical abilities can heal or cure.

The software programs your TRS-80 or SYSTEM 80 to produce a complete and highly accurate simulation of the solar system. All the orbits of the various planets are correctly calculated, as are their orbital speeds and gravitational pulls. Each time the game is played the planets the planets and stars in the solar system are differently placed, but still in correct relationship to each other and to the Sun. Hence every game is different and presents different problems to the player.<br/><br/>The purpose of the game is to blast off from the planet of your choice and travel throughout the solar system. There are no prizes, no free goes, nothing else. If you succeed in making a landing on another planet then your reward is the thrill of having been able to do so. Believe us when we state that it really is a thrill. Part of the reason is that the game is unbelievably difficult because all the physical laws and relationships are obeyed. Although the player of this game has the help of a computer, it will only tell him the statistics of the journey. It remains for the player to decide how much fuel to take on, what thrust to use, whether to try to blast off slowly, or whether to launch at somewhat higher velocity. Apart from the flight data, there are maps of the other planets, of the inner planets and a close up view of a planet when the craft reaches a specific proximity. Superimposed on these maps is the position of the spaceship together with the last few positions that have been occupied. At all times, gravitational pull, the laws of momentum and various other considerations are acting on the crafts course.

If a fish does not already have a condition it can be added by playing Rotten Eggs, Blistering Hot Sun, Nuclear Waste, Mustache or Fish Decoy. As it's a speed game, all players are applying modifiers to the fish simultaneously. The player that resolves the last of it's remaining conditions wins the fish.

Even the Plebs of Rome will have to be placated with bread and circuses if the Emperor is to keep his head and his throne.

During play Legions must be raised, taxes inflicted and troops moved. The choice of Generals can be critical - some are loyal and good fighters, some are neither.

In addition to changing his period, Dr Scott has also written KING ARTHUR so that, unlike the previous programs it can be completed in a comparatively short sitting. Normally it will take between twenty minutes and half an hour to play a game. As with EMPEROR and HANNIBAL, a map is displayed on the screen. In this case, of course, it shows Britain as it was at the beginning of the sixth century A.D. Also on the screen and to the right of the map is a status report listing the provinces currently under British control, together with their strategic strengths. Spies can be sent out to scout enemy territory and each year the War-Host musters at a place of the High King's choice. Contingents are sent out from the British Kingdoms, but in the Winter the men of the War-Host disperse to their homes. There are two campaigning moves each year, Spring and Autumn, and battle takes place after each campaigning move, whenever Britons meet Anglo-Saxons in the same province. In early spring of each year Anglo-Saxon reinforcements arrive, but ravaging the Anglo-Saxon lands will discourage such reinforcements. The ultimate aim of the game is to prevent further encroachment on British Territory by the Anglo-Saxons.

In April 2013, the game was rebranded as The Bureau: XCOM Declassified in its final version of a third-person view tactical shooter with strategy video game elements.<br/><br/>Set in the United States in 1962, the game tells the story of the CIA special agent William Carter, working for the United States Bureau of Strategic Emergency Command, tasked with investigating and stopping an extraterrestrial incursion on American soil, all while keeping it a secret and erasing all evidence.<br/><br/>The Bureau is a third-person shooter with an emphasis on squad-based tactics. The player controls William Carter and commands two additional agents in each mission. Carter has his own unique abilities, but other agents are divided into the Commando, Engineer, Support, and Recon classes. By entering &quot;Battle Focus Mode&quot;, which slows time significantly, the player can order their agents to move to strategic positions and activate class-specific abilities. Agents have customizable outfits, weapons, equipment and abilities. As in XCOM: Enemy Unknown, soldiers will suffer from permanent death and if Carter is unable to revive agents who have taken too much damage, they will die (variable difficulty levels also determine whether or not it is possible for downed agents to become battle-ready when revived, or if replacement agents will appear during a mission).<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;The Bureau: XCOM Declassified&quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "146652": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2225180.jpg", "boardgameimplementation": {"129437": "Legendary: A Marvel Deck Building Game"}, "is_expanded_by": {"205283": {"name": "Legendary Encounters: ALIEN Conversion Kit"}}, "poll": {}, "boardgamedesigner": {"10489": {"name": "Ben Cichoski"}}, "statistics": {}, "yearpublished": "2014", "maxplayers": "5", "boardgamepublisher": {"517": {"name": "Upper Deck Entertainment"}}, "boardgameintegration": {"195571": "Legendary Encounters: A Firefly Deck Building Game"}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2225180_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "45", "boardgamecategory": {"1002": {"name": "Card Game"}}, "boardgamehonor": {"26778": "2014 Golden Geek Best Card Game Nominee"}, "description": "Legendary Encounters: An Alien Deck Building Game, based on the four movies of the Alien series, is a fully cooperative game with original art.

Miller of Norland Software and released in 1983.<br/><br/>When the game starts, a murder has just been committed. The object of the game is to solve the murder by examining the house and talking to its occupants. Being a text-based game, the graphics are simple and consist of ASCII characters. The user moves the character with the arrow keys, and interacts with persons and objects by issuing commands (from a limited vocabulary list) at the game's prompt (similar to Sierra's &quot;Quest&quot; games). To win, the player must accurately identify the murder weapon, murder location, and the murderer. The player can do this by examining different objects in the game, talking to the occupants and observing their behavior. The murderer is the one whose alibi contradicts everyone else's.<br/><br/>The game is made challenging by the fact that the player has to keep track of everyone's stories and also can only question people once or twice before the murderer becomes suspicious. If the player takes too long to solve the mystery, the murderer will eventually kill the player's character and the game ends.<br/><br/>The game has two modes: a &quot;Basic&quot; mode and a &quot;Personalized&quot; mode. The only difference between the two modes is in the naming of in-game characters. In &quot;Basic&quot; mode, the game randomly generates the name of the characters, whereas in &quot;Personalized&quot; mode, the player can supply the names of the characters. Although the game is simple, no two murder scenarios are exactly alike as the game randomizes attributes of the game like the victim, murder scene, murder weapon, and murderer.<br/><br/>The game can be run on Mac with the use of the freeware program &quot;boxer&quot;, and has been cloned in Javascript, enabling users to play it in an internet browser.<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;<a target='_blank' href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sleuth_(video_game),&quot' rel='nofollow'>http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sleuth_(video_game),&quot</a>; available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "146707": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1788842.jpg", "poll": {}, "boardgamedesigner": {"70124": {"name": "Mike Friesen"}}, "statistics": {}, "yearpublished": "2014", "maxplayers": "6", "boardgameartist": {"29142": "John Ariosa"}, "boardgamepublisher": {"24956": {"name": "Lamp Light Games Inc"}}, "maxplaytime": "60", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1788842_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "60", "boardgamecategory": {"1079": {"name": "Humor"}}, "description": "It's the year 2047, and the world's atmosphere is filled with all manner of junk; those in charge have decided to do something about it.

Leave them in a pile face down between the 2 players, from this point on this will be known as the necropolis.<br/><br/>Next decide who goes first, then play alternates.<br/><br/>On your first turn draw a tile from the necropolis and place the tile face up in front of you, this area will be known as the grave site. Your opponent now does the same.<br/><br/>From this point on, on your turn, you may do one of the following actions.<br/><br/>- Draw a tile from the necropolis and place it adjacent to an existing tile at your grave site or<br/><br/>- Draw a tile from the necropolis but keep its value hidden from your opponent by placing it face down in front of you, but behind your grave site (This area behind your grave site will be known as the mastabas) or<br/><br/>- Draw a tile from your mastabas and place it adjacent to an existing tile at your grave site or<br/><br/>- Draw a tile from the necropolis or from the mastabas and start a new grave site, the old grave site is now considered abandoned and must not be played to for the rest of the game or<br/><br/>- Exchange a tile from your mastabas with the necropolis.<br/><br/>Now this ends your turn.<br/><br/>Tile Placement - The top number on a domino is known as its rank and the bottom number is known as its suit.

Battle involved all German mobile reserves on Eastern front which was exhausted and the losses were hardly recovered.<br/><br/>The battle started on January 24th. Red Army&rsquo;s target was very simple: surround and destroy as many as possible German units in Korsu\u0144 pocket. 2 Fronts were to assault concurrently in order to definitely cut off the pocket.

Winning at a nightclub will earn your team prestige for the night, and most prestige wins a point. Win five nights of dancing to be crowned the King of Clubs &mdash; but to earn your points, you have to dance!<br/><br/>King of Clubs is a fast-paced card game of sweet-sweet dance moves for 2 or 4 players. In the basic two-player game, each player has a team of dancers valued 1-5. In each round, four of the nine nightclubs (valued 2-7) are revealed, with nightclubs of the same value being paired for a couple's dance. Each player assigns one dancer to each nightclub (two dancers for a couple's dance), then players reveal the values of the dancers with the highest-valued dancer(s) winning the prestige value of the nightclub; the back-up dancer held in hand breaks ties. Whoever wins the most prestige in the round earns a point, and the first player to win five points wins the game. In the four-player team version, each teammate sends a dancer to each nightclub (without consulting one another about who's being sent where), and the highest low-valued dancer in each nightclub wins the prestige; if the lower-valued dancers are tied, then the higher-valued dancers are compared.<br/><br/>In the advanced game, each player also has a hand of five &quot;move&quot; cards. After revealing dancers in a nightclub, whoever has the lower-valued dancer can play one or more moves on the dancer, as long as he can chain the icons shown on the bottom of the dancer card and the bottom of the move cards. After determining who wins a nightclub, the player draws move cards equal to the &quot;move&quot; number shown on the back-up dancer still in hand, discarding down to five move cards, if needed.

It is an action-oriented first person shooter based on the Unreal Engine 2.0, that focuses heavily on team-based gameplay in both single-player and multi-player.<br/><br/>Devastation features standard first-person shooter gameplay, comparable to that of Unreal 2, as the game is based on Unreal 2's game engine. Notably, the game can be played in either &quot;arcade&quot; or &quot;tactical&quot; mode. Arcade mode features fast-paced action similar to that of many first person shooters, while tactical mode features slower gameplay more akin to tactical shooters such as Counter-Strike.<br/><br/>The single-player game focuses heavily on team-based gameplay. The player can have a squad of up to several NPCs following them at any given time. Each NPC can be issued one of 4 orders: attack, defend, follow, or stop. NPCs ordered to attack can independently make their way from the beginning to the end of the level without any guidance from the player, although they will stop moving and wait for the player to catch up if they get too far ahead of the player. In the game's initial levels, the game ends if any NPC squadmate is killed, but squadmate health regenerates fairly quickly to prevent this aspect of gameplay from being too frustrating.<br/><br/>The first 1/3 of the game features linear levels, with the player's goal being to make it from the start of the level to the end. About 1/3 of the way into the game, the player acquires a cloning machine that allows them and their squad members to respawn from death an infinite number of times. At this point, the only way to &quot;lose&quot; the game is to allow the enemy to capture and destroy the player's cloning machine. All levels from this point on are based on a capture the flag style of gameplay, with the rebel and Grathius teams starting on opposite sides of a non-linear level, each one tasked with capturing the other's cloning device.<br/><br/>Devastation also features 28 different weapons, divided into 8 categories: melee, pistols, sub-machine guns, assault rifles, sniper rifles, squad support weapons, and miscellaneous weapons.<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;Devastation (video game)&quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "146759": {"poll": {}, "name": "Decatur", "playingtime": "120", "minplayers": "3", "boardgamemechanic": {"2013": "Commodity Speculation"}, "yearpublished": "2014", "usersrated": "17", "boardgamesubdomain": {"5497": "Strategy Games"}, "maxplayers": "7", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2200596_t.jpg", "average": "7.76765", "statistics": {}, "boardgamepublisher": {"25743": {"name": "Radio Tapir LLC"}}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2200596.jpg", "boardgameversion": {"217149": "First edition"}, "maxplaytime": "120", "boardgamecategory": {"1015": {"name": "Civilization"}}, "age": "0", "minplaytime": "120", "description": "You are the head of a vast enterprise, chartered by the Crown to engage in commercial activities in the eastern hemisphere.

Consumed with greed, rival Sk&aacute;lds turned the lumbering colossus against their enemies in a race to conquer the island and seize the riches of the other settlements.<br/><br/>Rampaging Jotunn is a competitive fast paced board game for 2 players in which each both players create the island they will be playing on where they will populate it with opposing villages and armies.  Each player controls an army of Vikings trying to protect their villages while trying to destroy their opponents villages, at the same time the Jotunn rampages across the island destroying everything in sight.<br/><br/>Players use cards to influence the giant and direct him towards your opponents armies and villages.  They also use cards to move their armies into battle across the island. The last player with villages on the board wins!  Rampaging Jotunn is a half hour long game and is for players 8 and up!<br/><br/>Rampaging Jotunn features illustrations by the award winning artist, Nicolas Giancondino.<br/><br/>"}, "146763": {"boardgamedesigner": {"70060": {"name": "Matthias Bonnici"}}, "poll": {}, "name": "Dragon Chess: Arcane Battles", "playingtime": "45", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": {"2072": "Dice Rolling"}, "yearpublished": "2013", "usersrated": "3", "maxplayers": "4", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1760452_t.jpg", "average": "7", "statistics": {}, "boardgamepublisher": {"25736": {"name": "Knighthawk Games"}}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1760452.jpg", "boardgameversion": {"217153": "First Edition / Prototype"}, "maxplaytime": "45", "boardgamecategory": {"1009": {"name": "Abstract Strategy"}}, "age": "7", "minplaytime": "45", "description": "Take control of your mystic armies and fight for victory!

As players find fantastic gear and artifacts to equip their heroes, they also gain experience from their adventures. This experience is used to level up, guiding the hero's path through an expansive, class-specific upgrade tree of new skills and abilities, allowing each player to develop their hero to fit their own play style.<br/><br/>In City of the Ancients, players will encounter portals to the otherworld on the Plains of Targa, finding an ancient frozen city whose living inhabitants are nowhere to be found.

Within Eurale are seven kingdoms: Nisos, Aratoy, Oriam, Fornax, Elythria, Cathea, and Taberland. The seven kingdoms united into an uneasy alliance and built a citadel as a meeting place, which was named Avalon.<br/><br/>Within the land is a race of nomads known as the Sha'ahoul. Their religion values the earth and nature and therefore they are against farming, the building of permanent structures, and similar practices which they feel destroys the earth. After discovering the existence of Eurale, they declared war on the seven kingdoms to eradicate their way of life. As the war progresses, displaced war refugees have taken shelter in Avalon and the seven kingdoms have sent military support to defend Avalon as the citadel is seen as the last hope at stopping the Sha'ahoul. The Sha'ahoul and their leader, Mithras, chose to overtake the citadel by setting up a siege around it.<br/><br/>The game begins with an entry in the hero's journal. The siege has been going on for several years and his brother Corvus serves as part of the military in Avalon. When their father dies, the hero feels that it is his obligation to inform Corvus of the sad news, so he becomes part of the crew of a ship sailing from Elythria to Avalon to deliver supplies. The Sha'ahoul sinks all of the ships except the one the hero is on and the ship reaches Avalon without most of its supplies. It is not possible to make a return voyage to Elythria and so the hero decides to stay at Avalon and help out Avalon in whatever manner he can. The player gains control at this point and begins by speaking to Corvus and informing him about his father's death.

A number of Insurgent factions have sprung up hoping to undermine the government and send the country into a state of anarchy, in the belief they stand to gain power or wealth in the coming lawlessness.<br/><br/>Choose your side: Become one of three insurgent factions bent on sowing chaos by launching ever greater terror events, or make one last stand on behalf of the United States. If you can stand firm and keep this country from descending into anarchy you will restore the people's faith in its government and keep the American dream alive.&quot;<br/><br/>Threat Level Red is a game for 4 players where three players play the role of insurgent factions attacking from within the united states, and one player takes on the role of the hobbled, fading federal government.<br/><br/>As an insurgent faction your goal is to increase the anarchy level in the US to 20 by launching insurgent events. Each turn begins with a hidden token deployment phase where you must secretly plant sleeper cell and insurgent event tokens in major cities across the country. Once all the insurgent player's plans are set players then take turns revealing one secret token at time. Each sleeper cell token you activate increases the action points available to you to play your event cards, but also gives the US player more information about where you are planning your next event. Do you carry out small safer operations to draw additional event cards, cell tokens, and earn resources, or do you try to go all out and launch a major, but risky offensive by playing one of your major event cards? Once your organization has grown strong enough anything is possible- from a simple bomb threat, to hacking the nation's closed circuit TV network, or for the most powerful and violent factions building the dreaded suitcase nuke, but if the american player can deduce where your next event is taking place you stand to lose everything.<br/><br/>As the government player you seek to foil as many insurgent events as possible. If you can foil 12 insurgent events, or survive 5 game turns without the anarchy level rising to 20 points you are victorious. Unfortunately you are understaffed and nearly out of resources to face the burgeoning threats facing the nation. You begin the game with a small number of agent units that you must allocate between the major geographic &quot;zones&quot; of the united states. At the start of each turn you gain a small number of reinforcements: additional agent units and counterplot cards. Your counterplot cards will let you set up wiretaps, border patrols, undercover agents. Each time it is your turn you may send up to one agent token per &quot;zone&quot; to investigate a face down enemy token. If you correctly select a location of an insurgent event that event is discarded and you gain 1 stability point, but if the hidden token you reveal turns out to be an enemy sleeper cell the agent will most likely be lost in the ensuing gunfight. Since you have far fewer agents then your enemies have sleeper cells if you were to send your agents in to investigate every hint of insurgent activity you would soon be out of agents and quickly overrun. So instead, watch closely, let the insurgents overextend, give them enough rope to hang themselves before making your move. If you wait too long you risk letting another terror attack slip through your fingers, but if you strike at the right time even a small handful of well-trained agents can topple these immense terror networks.<br/><br/>"}, "146797": {"rpgitemversion": {"217238": "PDF version"}, "statistics": {}, "name": "Tales of Stercoran", "rpgproducer": {"26182": "Andy R.

A row and a column region extends from one side of the game frame to the other. A box  region can only be located in one of the game frame corners. Players take turns selecting one of the dice and placing it in the game frame. The goal is to be the first player to complete a number sequence using one of the 3 regions.<br/><br/>o Speed: This game mode is all about solving the same Sudoku like puzzle using the Region play mode as quickly as possible. A stopwatch or other timekeeping device is necessary to play this game mode. The winner is the player with the best time.<br/><br/>"}, "146804": {"statistics": {}, "name": "Alarums & Excursions (Issue 81 - May 1982)", "rpgproducer": {"13226": "Lee Gold"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1752375.jpg", "usersrated": "0", "average": "0", "rpgissue": {"1494": "Alarums & Excursions"}, "rpg": {"191": "Advanced Dungeons & Dragons (1st Edition)"}, "rpgissueversion": {"217249": "First Printing"}, "poll": {}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1752375_t.jpg", "description": "Alarums &amp; Excursions<br/>Issue #81<br/>May 1982<br/><br/>Cover art by Ken Murphy.<br/><br/>"}, "146805": {"rpgitemversion": {"217250": "PDF version"}, "statistics": {}, "name": "Legends of Ogul-Duhr II: The Hidden Halls", "rpgproducer": {"68167": "Jason Mills"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1752791.png", "usersrated": "0", "average": "0", "rpggenre": {"155": "Fantasy (High Fantasy)"}, "rpg": {"2313": "Tunnels & Trolls (7th - 7.5 Editions)"}, "rpgcategory": {"2136": "Solitaire Adventure"}, "poll": {}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1752791_t.png", "description": "From publisher blurb:<br/><br/>The stranger trying to sell his scroll is a fool!

No, the landscapers must meet certain building requirements, and unfortunately you won't always have at hand everything that you might need.<br/><br/>In game terms, each player has a personal garden that's divided into rows and columns; each row shows a color, while each column shows one of nine garden elements, such as the wells or a pavilion. Players start with one noble at the top of each column. A shared tile supply board has five rows &ndash; with colored spaces matching the colors on each player board &ndash; and two columns, which are unlabeled. At the start of the game, ten tiles are placed on this supply board; each tile depicts one of the nine garden elements.<br/><br/>Each turn, a player plays one of his two cards in hand, which determines the tile he can take from the supply, e.g. take a pavilion tile, take a tile from the red or gray spaces, etc. The player has only a single card that lets him take any tile &ndash; but if he plays a card showing a garden element that isn't present, then he can instead take any tile! The player must place this tile on his player board in the column that matches the image on the tile and the row that matches the color from which the tile was taken. If this space is already filled, he flips the tile to show the gardener on the other side, then places this tile on any free space in the same row or the same column. After placing the tile, he may move one of his nobles along a path of placed tiles as long as the noble ends up in the same column in which it started, but on a lower row. The player scores points equal to the row reached.<br/><br/>The player then refills the supply and draws a new card. The game ends after 18 rounds. Each player then receives bonus points for each completed row and column. Furthermore, each player has received two order cards at the start of the game, each of which shows one of the nine columns; each player receives bonus points for the row reached by the noble in that column.

Named the Ahargon Den, the Mouth of Darkness, the gates stand beneath the dark shadow of Aufstrag, offering entrance to the pits of hell on Aihrde. Herein lies another world, heaps piled upon heaps of dungeons, tunnels, halls, vaulted chambers of chain-bound madness, all steeped in the putrid morass of law and evil.<br/><br/>But before taking the gates one must pass a wilderness of dangers. The Outer Gate marks the end of the Causeway. It stands as a breach in a dike built to hold the surrounding swamps at bay, but one that now holds them penned into a fetid lake of stinking water and filth that laps the sides of that mighty fortress. Through this fetid morass the Causeway dips, vanishing beneath the black water. From the waters a ramp takes one to the Portico that lies before the gates, and the Kennel. Beyond the ramp lies the mirrored walk and the Portico, a broad porch, a quarter mile wide that played home to the many supplicants who came to Aufstrag for want of service, waiting for the Captain of the Gates to grant them entry. And over it all, the dread Tower of the Guard that stands watch over the whole of the gate&rsquo;s environs.<br/><br/>The dangers lie beyond old buildings. A beast of foul design broke the bondage of Aufstrag and haunts the Fetid Morass within the Dike. The Ramp itself is scrawled with a graffiti of the mad and the gate house, though the dread Mogrl are long gone, houses a nameless shadow that hungers for a taste of a world past.

A thousand square miles of impenetrable swamp lands peopled by monsters great and small; with fang and claw, upon dusky wings, or slithering through the filth they hunt any who dare to enter the Gray Pools. So great the danger that the Lords of Aufstrag ordered a road constructed; it stretched for 3 score miles over the swamps before it came to the Withing Uplands.<br/><br/>So great was the menace that the Lords of Aufstrag long ago built a causeway, 75 miles in length, spanning the northern acres of the Pools and giving travelers some shelter from the dangers of the journey. It crossed from the Portico of Aufstrag to the Withing uplands. Where the causeway met the plains, the soldiers of Aufstrag costructed a gatehouse. Two mighty bastions flanked the iron gate, so that any who passed must contend with the garrison within. The causeway wound its way across the marshland, held above the water and muck upon mighty pylons of stone that were shaped like the gods of dwarves- slaves, to Unklar&rsquo;s mind. Way stations were set up every 20 miles, offering travelers a place to stay, safely out of reach from the creatures that hunted in the swamps.<br/><br/>Though nothing could wholly protect those supplicants of the horned god from the terrors of the Pools and such were the losses that travelers suffered in the trek over the swamp that men took to calling the causeway The Wasting Way.<br/><br/>All that has fallen to the hand of time and war; now the Wasting Way stands abandoned and in ruins, and travel upon it an even greater nightmare. Whether the journey carries you across the swamp upon the long abandoned causeway, or the Lady of Garun calls upon you to free her tormented soul from the grasp of the evil devil-lord Coburg the Undying, travel upon the Wasting Way is a journey fraught with peril and one only the stout of heart dare. But the unplundered wealth of a thousand years waits on the other side.

Then, all players turn over their tokens simultaneously and take an action: either grabbing some Food from a Hen House (i.e. Eat), or exercising to trim down a bit<br/>(i.e. Lose Weight).<br/><br/>Each player has two goals in this game: first, getting a balanced diet by obtaining a variety of different Food cards &ndash; the wider the variety and the more the Food cards a player gets, the better the score; at the same time, each player should try to avoid getting marked Chubby whenever the Farm Owner makes an inspection to identify candidates for his Thanksgiving turkey dinner. At each inspection, the chubbiest turkey (as indicated by the highest number of Food cards held) will be given Chubby Markers. When Thanksgiving comes around, the turkey with the most Chubby Markers will be sent to the dinner table!<br/><br/>At the end of Thanksgiving, the survival turkey with the highest score wins! How to collect as many Food cards as possible, while avoiding getting Chubby Markers, is the key to winning this game.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "3", "boardgameversion": {"217473": "First edition"}, "age": "8", "name": "Happy Turkey Day!", "playingtime": "20", "boardgamemechanic": {"2004": "Set Collection"}, "average": "6.3125", "usersrated": "16", "boardgamefamily": {"17963": "Animals: Turkeys"}}, "146917": {"average": "5.13636", "poll": {}, "name": "Tatu ja Patu: Virheist\u00e4 viis", "playingtime": "20", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": {"2060": "Pattern Recognition"}, "yearpublished": "2013", "usersrated": "11", "maxplayers": "4", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2422743_t.jpg", "boardgameartist": {"53967": "Aino Havukainen"}, "statistics": {}, "boardgamepublisher": {"1179": {"name": "Peliko"}}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2422743.jpg", "boardgameversion": {"217478": "First edition"}, "maxplaytime": "20", "boardgamecategory": {"1041": {"name": "Children's Game"}}, "age": "5", "minplaytime": "20", "description": "Tatu ja Patu &ndash; Virheist&auml; viis has cards with two pictures.

The first of the new exotic darkmantles is the death&rsquo;s hood darkmantle (CR 3), whose smaller size is not the liability that it initially seems, as it allows it to better conform to the faces of its victims. It attaches itself to its prey&rsquo;s face and quickly strangles it, then uses the corpse like a puppet for its own nefarious ends. The equally insidious shadow weaver darkmantle (CR 5) is more powerful in areas of darkness, and is surrounded by an aura that subtly lowers the light level around it. Finally, the goliath darkmantle (CR 8) is a huge darkmantle whose favored tactic is to drop from above on unsuspecting victims, and can grapple a large number of victims at once, weakening them with its acidic drool before swallowing them whole.<br/><br/>"}, "146924": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1833188.png", "poll": {}, "statistics": {}, "yearpublished": "2013", "maxplayers": "12", "age": "12", "boardgamepublisher": {"94": {"name": "Clash of Arms Games"}}, "maxplaytime": "0", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1833188_t.png", "minplaytime": "0", "boardgamecategory": {"1042": {"name": "Expansion for Base-game"}}, "description": "(from Clash of Arms website:)<br/><br/>Mediterranean Fleets includes over 150 ships and 90 aircraft!

In the first round, players take turns turning up cards on a face-down tableau. If they turn up a set of winners, these cards are taken into hand.

The path to this ultimate goal rests on a player's ability to successfully maneuver around the playing field and utilize the special super powers of General Zod and Superman.<br/><br/>Includes:<br/>1 Superman #101 miniature<br/>1 General Zod #106 miniature<br/>2 Character cards<br/>1 Full Color Game Board<br/>2 Dice (Six Sided)<br/>32 Tokens(Two factions)<br/><br/>"}, "146978": {"statistics": {}, "name": "Shadow Force", "videogamemode": {"2313": "Cooperative"}, "videogameversion": {"217615": "Japanese Arcade edition"}, "average": "0", "videogametheme": {"2148": "Fantasy"}, "usersrated": "0", "videogamegenre": {"2342": "Beat 'em Up"}, "videogameplatform": {"4781": "Arcade"}, "poll": {}, "description": "User Summary<br/><br/>A beat em up game for one or two players.
