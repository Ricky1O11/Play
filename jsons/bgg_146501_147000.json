As temporal agents, you and your team will be sent into the bodies of beings from different worlds or realities to successfully complete the missions given to you. Failure is impossible, as you will be able to go back in time as many times as required.<br/><br/>T.I.M.E Stories is a narrative game, a game of &quot;decksploration&quot;. Each player is free to give their character as deep a &quot;role&quot; as they want, in order to live through a story, as much in the game as around the table. But it's also a board game with rules which allow for reflection and optimization.<br/><br/>At the beginning of the game, the players are at their home base and receive their mission briefing. The object is then to complete it in as few attempts as possible. The actions and movements of the players will use Temporal Units (TU), the quantity of which depend on the scenario and the amount of players. Each attempt is called a &quot;run&quot;; one run equals the use of all of the Temporal Units at the players' disposal. When the TU reach zero, the agents are recalled to the agency, and restart the scenario from the beginning, armed with their experience. The object of the game is to make the perfect run, while solving all of the puzzles and overcoming all of a scenario&rsquo;s obstacles.<br/><br/>The base box contains the entirety of the T.I.M.E Stories system and allows players to play all of the scenarios, the first of which &mdash; Asylum &mdash; is included. During a scenario, which consists of a deck of 120+ cards, each player explores cards, presented most often in the form of a panorama. Access to some cards require the possession of the proper item or items, while others present surprises, enemies, riddles, clues, and other dangers.<br/><br/>You usually take possession of local hosts to navigate in a given environment, but who knows what you'll have to do to succeed? Roam a med-fan city, looking for the dungeon where the Syaan king is hiding? Survive in the Antarctic while enormous creatures lurk beneath the surface of the ice? Solve a puzzle in an early 20th century asylum? That is all possible, and you might even have to jump from one host to another, or play against your fellow agents from time to time...<br/><br/>In the box, an insert allows players to &quot;save&quot; the game at any point, to play over multiple sessions, just like in a video game. This way, it's possible to pause your ongoing game by preserving the state of the receptacles, the remaining TU, the discovered clues, etc.<br/><br/>T.I.M.E Stories is a decksploring game in which each deck makes anything possible!<br/><br/>Official FAQ<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": ["Czech first edition", "English first edition", "French first edition", "German first edition", "German second edition", "Italian first edition", "Japanese first edition", "Polish first edition", "Spanish first edition"], "average": "8.06626", "name": "T.I.M.E Stories", "playingtime": "90", "boardgamemechanic": ["Co-operative Play", "Dice Rolling", "Role Playing", "Storytelling", "Time Track", "Variable Player Powers", "Voting"], "age": "12", "boardgameexpansion": ["Batman: Year One (fan expansion for T.I.M.E Stories)", "Broken Peace (fan expansion for T.I.M.E Stories)", "Easy Street (fan expansion for T.I.M.E Stories)", "Pariah Missouri (fan expansion to T.I.M.E Stories)", "Switching Gears (fan expansion for T.I.M.E Stories)", "T.I.M.E Stories: A Prophecy of Dragons", "T.I.M.E Stories: Beacon Promo", "T.I.M.E Stories: Estrella Drive", "T.I.M.E Stories: Expedition: Endurance", "T.I.M.E Stories: Fr\u00e8res de la C\u00f4te", "T.I.M.E Stories: Lumen Fidei", "T.I.M.E Stories: Special Reward promo", "T.I.M.E Stories: The Marcy Case", "T.I.M.E Stories: Tric Trac TV", "T.I.M.E Stories: Under the Mask"], "usersrated": "9752", "boardgameaccessory": ["T.I.M.E Stories: Alternate character art pack"], "boardgamesubdomain": ["Thematic Games"], "boardgamefamily": ["T.I.M.E Stories", "Time Travel"], "boardgamepodcastepisode": ["#11: 2015, A Year in Review", "#23: TIME Stories on tap; Qwixx; Oh My Goods; Deception; Spirits of the Rice Paddy", "015: Back to Normal (aka Random)", "11-16-15: MACE, T.I.M.E Stories, The Cave, Coup Rebellion G54, Perceived value of consumable games", "14.

The 4 player cardgame is related to Whist and Bridge. In addition to the general rules, each region has its own set of minor rules. The games dates +/- 1950.<br/><br/>The game is played with 52 cards (a deck without jokers). Each round starts with the player left to the dealer making the first bid. There are many different bids possible, due to the different rules per region. However, the most commen bids are (in order):<br/><br/>- Pass: the player does not make a bid<br/>- Rik: score 8 (with a mate)<br/>- Piek: score exactly one (alone)<br/>- Miser&eacute;: score 0 (alone)<br/>- 9 or 10 alone: score 9 or 10 (alone)<br/><br/>After the bidding ends (players can over-bid eachother), the winning player announces the following:<br/><br/>- requested ace: the player who won the bid requests an ace. This must be an ace that he does not have himself. The player who does have this ace will be his mate for the current round. If the bid is a &quot;rik&quot;, then the 2 players together have to score 8 and the other 2 players try to prevent this. If the player plays alone (for example &quot;piek&quot; bid), he does not request an ace and just plays alone versus the 3 others.<br/>- choose the trump (&quot;troef&quot;): the player who won the bid also choses one colors to be the trump. The trump cards are worth the most for this round (similair to &quot;Hearts&quot;).<br/><br/>The round starts with the player left to the dealer playing his first card. The next player has to play a card of the same color. If that is not possible he can play any other card. The player with the highest card in a matching color scores.

The main objective is to achieve a &quot;clean kill&quot;, otherwise the serpent may divide doubling your problem.

The value of the time bomb countdown is also affected.<br/><br/>SPACE ROCKS also includes a subsidiary game called Space Battle. This enables the player to fight time bombs and enemy ships without worrying about rocks, that is to say, there are no asteroids in Space Battle.

This would be relatively simple but for the fact that the player must also contend with a number of monsters, contact with which is fatal. Lest you think the game is restricted to collecting bricks and fighting monsters, it is possible for the player to dig holes in the path of the monster, the latter fall through and for a little while they are out of the way of the industrious brick collector. Control is with the four arrow keys.<br/><br/>The game starts on level one and progresses upon the collection of all the bricks. The game has a certain number of bricks to it in the sense of the method of play, but broadly it is a skill game in the sense that when a monster reaches a ladder he may or may not use it. Just as SEAWOLF made a pleasant change from space arcade games, FRENZY is equally unique. The title of this game is particular well chosen as the player has to be very fast on his feet to do well.

The mission objective of the player is to penetrate alien controlled sectors of space, destroying all positions and allowing the Galactic Fleet to occupy the area. The aliens come at you in a similar orientation to Invaders, but not in a similar way. They attack you in a haphazard, random manner from all directions. The galaxy is split up into sectors. You travel through these by way of either (at the discretion of the player) a hyperwarp control or, if you have destroyed all of the aliens in that particular sector, you are automatically taken on to the next one. The first sector is different to the others with eight alien fleets in it which you have to destroy. The following sectors have one fleet in each sector but the sectors get harder to occupy as one progresses, as each sector has a more powerful alien fleet in it. You start the game with four Galactic Empire ships and four units of hyperwarp energy. One of the latter will be dissipated if you go from sector to sector. A bonus Galactic Empire is awarded for each 10,000 points. You also get a bonus ship at the beginning of each sector. You attain further hyperwarp energy for each 10,000 points . . . In the second, third and fourth sectors the aliens are equipped with Photon torpedoes which will destroy you if they hit. After the four sectors the aliens fire torpedoes at different speeds, although the faster they are the smaller the chance is of them destroying you if they hit.

If a game is too difficult, then it loses its appeal - too easy and it is boring. This game is played on the screen on which is displayed various railway tracks and four stations. Going round the tracks are five trains. Tracks may be connected to others by way of about 10 sets of points. The speed of the trains may be altered and the points may be controlled, thus the direction of the trains is under your command and the purpose is to get four of the trains into stations. We say four because the fifth is a &quot;rogue&quot; train - a runaway train - and you have to get all of your other trains out of the way. You cannot control it. Our difficulty in describing the game really arises because, although it is a simple game in conception, it is a difficult one for playing. The graphics are excellent (particularly the title one). Your skill is judged by time. Assuming that you do not have a crash then a player who can park all of his trains in the station in a lesser time than another is the winner.

You&rsquo;ll also find the shadow worg (CR 5), a creature that is physically healed by darkness and has numerous shadow-related powers, foremost of which is the ability to summon shadow wolves to fight on its behalf. Finally, there is the great speaker worg (CR 9), an ancient and terrible creature that possesses a strange magic that grows stronger the nearer it comes to death.<br/><br/>"}, "146537": {"rpgartist": ["(Uncredited)"], "rpg": ["Pathfinder System Compatible Product"], "poll": [], "name": "Exotic Encounters: Ettins", "rpgdesigner": ["Alex Riggs", "Joshua Zaback"], "rpgproducer": ["Rosa Gibbons"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1747254.jpg", "usersrated": "0", "rpgitemversion": ["PDF version"], "average": "0", "statistics": [], "rpggenre": ["Fantasy (High Fantasy)"], "rpgpublisher": ["Necromancers of the Northwest"], "rpgcategory": ["Sourcebook (rules/options to enhance play)"], "rpgseries": ["Exotic Encounters"], "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1747254_t.jpg", "description": "From publisher blurb:<br/><br/>This particular installment of Exotic Encounters focuses on the oft-overlooked ettin. These two-headed giants are capable of being more than just a particularly ugly-looking substitute for an ogre, and have a rich history in both mythology and fantasy games and media. This book introduces three new ettins, the first of which is the primal ettin (CR 8). This monstrous giant is far more feral even than a normal ettin, and its heads are like those of giant boars. Its favored tactic is to impale foes on its tusks and literally rip them apart between its two heads. The next ettin is the ettin mage (CR 11), which trades in superior two-weapon fighting ability for the power to cast spells. Not much brighter than a normal ettin, the one-two punch of flail and magic can still make it a formidable foe, when it can stop arguing with itself. Finally, the three-headed ettin (CR 13) is exactly what it sounds like, and more. This ettin&rsquo;s extra extra head gives it all the brainpower it needs for cunning tactics, making it a supremely powerful foe&hellip;unless its heads are picked off one by one.<br/><br/>"}, "146538": {"rpgartist": ["Clipart.com"], "rpgitemversion": ["PDF Version"], "poll": [], "name": "Fate: Fudge Adventures in Tabletop Entertainment (1st Edition)", "rpgdesigner": ["Robert Donoghue", "Fred Hicks"], "rpgproducer": ["Fred Hicks"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1843109.jpg", "usersrated": "0", "average": "0", "rpgissuearticle": ["Aspects, Revisited", "Relationships in FATE", "The Case for Aspects"], "rpg": ["Fate 1.0/2.0"], "rpgpublisher": ["Evil Hat Productions"], "statistics": [], "rpgcategory": ["Core Rules (min needed to play)"], "rpggenre": ["Generic / Universal"], "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1843109_t.jpg", "description": "This is the first edition of Fate (version 1.0, released 1/15/03), based on the RPG Fudge.

The player is flying a space fighter called Interdictor Mark II. After taking off from home starbase he has to traverse space at light speed until such time as he meets an opponent. When this occurs he is automatically taken out of light speed, does battle and, if successful, re-enters light speed until the next encounter. After a certain distance through space -- depending upon his rank at the time -- he will arrive at the first starbase, dock and report in, saving a record of his achievements, or otherwise, to disk or tape. If all goes well and he is sufficiently skilled he will progress through the ranks of SUb-Lieutenant, Lieutenant, Lieutenant-Commander, Commander, Captain and finally, Commodore. So far as is known, no-one has achieved the latter rank, including the author. The higher the rank, the greater the length of time during transits between starbases and the more frequent the contacts with the enemy.<br/><br/>The above is a not uncommon, even perhaps rather mundane, description of a space flying/fighting game. What makes Interdictor Pilot the fantastically interesting and fascinating pastime that it is, is the way in which the author has built on the basic theme. For instance, for a TRS-80, we think that the graphics are a little short of miraculous. Actually this is probably not too surprising because Interdictor Pilot is written in machine code and occupies the full 16K. As an example of the graphics . . . the large section in the middle entitled &quot;Vision Screen&quot; is the pilot's view into space. When leaving or arriving at a starbase a three dimensional tunnel appears, through which the pilot must navigate. When leaving he is, of course, taking off from zero velocity, and is therefore nicely aligned, hence a few touches of the controls here and there will keep him on the straight and level out of the tunnel. When arriving at a starbase, however, the position is drastically changed. The opening of the tunnel is displayed and it is for him to manoeuvre himself so that he not only flies into it, but also along it. In view of the fact that the aircraft is proceeding at a very fast speed, this small part of the game is no light achievement on its own. Normally, however, as we have said, the vision out through the screen is of space and this is really most amazingly realistic. The heavens seem to proceed across the screen almost exactly as one would imagine in real life.<br/><br/>Interdictor Pilot comes with what are effectively two separate manuals. The first is a short page or so prepared by Molimerx on how the program is loaded and the idiosyncracies of it when used on Tandy Model I and III machines. This section is complete with instructions for a very quick demonstration flight. The main part of the manual is a fully illustrated and document written in &quot;real time&quot;. It assumes that you are a novice pilot that has just been given your first Interdictor Mark II and it takes you through the craft description of both the Interdictor Mark I and the newer Mark II, plus the theory and practice of the deflectors, propulsion, stabilisers, Saturn array, Lewis array, weapons systems, cockpit display and light speed drive. The next section of the manual goes through, in great detail, the cockpit display and this is followed by a description of the controls and their operation. Craft types and Sortie format are described, followed by a section of combat advice, a description of the starbases and finally the use of the simulator. A Sortie, incidentally, is made up of the launch, the transit, which includes the light speed jumps and encounters with the enemy, and finally the recovery at starbase.<br/><br/>What more can you say? Interdictor Pilot is written by a serving RAF navigator and in our estimation sets new standards for micro-computer game software.<br/><br/>"}, "146543": {"image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1752909.jpg", "poll": [], "boardgamedesigner": ["Till Meyer", "Nicole Stiehl"], "statistics": [], "yearpublished": "2014", "maxplayers": "4", "boardgameartist": ["Christian Opperer"], "boardgamepublisher": ["Spieltrieb"], "maxplaytime": "40", "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1752909_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "40", "boardgamecategory": ["Science Fiction"], "description": "In Willkommen auf Allofall (&quot;Welcome to Allofall&quot;), up to four stranded space travelers try their luck escaping the horrors of the planet &quot;Allofall&quot;, either in a cooperative or competitive version as the players prefer.<br/><br/>The aim of the game is simple: Board on your miniature mining vehicle, the &quot;Rollator MK-V&quot;, leave the ship, and get to the landing point of your shuttle on the opposite side of the game board before it leaves again.

Each player starts the game with four banks and four vaults in the colors red, green, blue and yellow. All the players also have a personal vault where they can save their precious cards.<br/><br/>The game is played with two types of cards: point cards and Banco cards. The point cards have a color, value and 1-3 symbols. These cards are used to score points or to invest in the banks. The Banco cards, which have a color and a bonus, are used only to close a bank. A player's turn has three phases. First, the active player can steal a card from an opponent by asking for it (color, value or a combination of both). Second, the player takes two actions, which can be playing cards on a bank and/or vault, saving cards in the personal vault, taking your personal vault to your hand, or burning cards. Finally, the player brings his hand back to five cards.<br/><br/>The goal of the game is to score as many points as possible in the vaults and secure these points by closing the banks. When a bank is closed, all players must close their vault of the same color, so no points can be scored anymore. When all vaults are closed, the game ends and points are counted.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": ["Multilingual first edition"], "name": "BancoBanco", "playingtime": "45", "boardgamemechanic": ["Card Drafting", "Hand Management", "Press Your Luck"], "average": "6.07692", "usersrated": "13", "age": "12", "boardgamepodcastepisode": ["Garrett's Games 407 - Splendor, Banco Banco, and Leelawadee"]}, "146550": {"poll": [], "name": "Call of Duty: Ghosts", "videogamemode": ["Network Multiplayer", "Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["North American PlayStation 3 edition", "North American PlayStation 4 edition", "North American Wii U edition", "North American Windows edition", "North American Xbox 360 edition", "North American Xbox One edition"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1982727.jpg", "videogameseries": ["Call of Duty (Core Series)"], "videogametheme": ["War - Modern"], "videogamegenre": ["First Person Shooter"], "usersrated": "20", "videogamedeveloper": ["Infinity Ward", "Neversoft", "Raven Software"], "videogamefranchise": ["Call of Duty"], "videogameplatform": ["PlayStation 3", "PlayStation 4", "Wii U", "Windows", "Xbox 360", "Xbox One"], "videogamehonor": ["2013 Game Critics Best Action Game of the Year Nominee", "2013 Global Game Awards Best Multiplayer Game of the Year Nominee", "2013 Global Game Awards Best Shooter of the Year Nominee", "2013 Global Game Awards Game of the Year Nominee", "2013 Spike (VGX) Best Shooter of the Year Nominee"], "average": "6.38", "statistics": [], "videogamepublisher": ["Activision"], "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1982727_t.jpg", "description": "&quot;The franchise that has defined a generation of gaming is set to raise the bar once again with the all-new Call of Duty&reg;: Ghosts.

It remains for the player to decide how much fuel to take on, what thrust to use, whether to try to blast off slowly, or whether to launch at somewhat higher velocity.

Each Color tile is divided into quadrants, each quadrant one of the four colors. A Color Tile may have each of its quadrants a different color, or they may be all the same, or a combination. Because there are four colors, there are 256 color combinations possible, 112 of which have been selected to make this standard deck. A Corner Tile is the same size but is solid in color. A set of Corner Tiles consists of one of each of the four colors in Crootle.<br/><br/>The object of the game of Crootle is to connect two corners of the playing field together. Each game the Corner Tiles are randomly set, and each player randomly selects their path, or rather their two corners to connect. Four players could feasibly be on the same path as each other.<br/><br/>Through timed turn play, each player draws Color Tiles and matches them side to side, trying to connect, or block their opponents from connecting, their two corners.<br/><br/>Fun for anyone who sits down to play.

Spies can be sent out to scout enemy territory and each year the War-Host musters at a place of the High King's choice. Contingents are sent out from the British Kingdoms, but in the Winter the men of the War-Host disperse to their homes. There are two campaigning moves each year, Spring and Autumn, and battle takes place after each campaigning move, whenever Britons meet Anglo-Saxons in the same province.

The game was in development under different titles by three different studios since 2006. It was unveiled as a first-person shooter titled XCOM in June 2010 and it has been repeatedly delayed and changed since then. In April 2013, the game was rebranded as The Bureau: XCOM Declassified in its final version of a third-person view tactical shooter with strategy video game elements.<br/><br/>Set in the United States in 1962, the game tells the story of the CIA special agent William Carter, working for the United States Bureau of Strategic Emergency Command, tasked with investigating and stopping an extraterrestrial incursion on American soil, all while keeping it a secret and erasing all evidence.<br/><br/>The Bureau is a third-person shooter with an emphasis on squad-based tactics. The player controls William Carter and commands two additional agents in each mission. Carter has his own unique abilities, but other agents are divided into the Commando, Engineer, Support, and Recon classes. By entering &quot;Battle Focus Mode&quot;, which slows time significantly, the player can order their agents to move to strategic positions and activate class-specific abilities. Agents have customizable outfits, weapons, equipment and abilities.

Miller of Norland Software and released in 1983.<br/><br/>When the game starts, a murder has just been committed. The object of the game is to solve the murder by examining the house and talking to its occupants. Being a text-based game, the graphics are simple and consist of ASCII characters. The user moves the character with the arrow keys, and interacts with persons and objects by issuing commands (from a limited vocabulary list) at the game's prompt (similar to Sierra's &quot;Quest&quot; games). To win, the player must accurately identify the murder weapon, murder location, and the murderer. The player can do this by examining different objects in the game, talking to the occupants and observing their behavior. The murderer is the one whose alibi contradicts everyone else's.<br/><br/>The game is made challenging by the fact that the player has to keep track of everyone's stories and also can only question people once or twice before the murderer becomes suspicious. If the player takes too long to solve the mystery, the murderer will eventually kill the player's character and the game ends.<br/><br/>The game has two modes: a &quot;Basic&quot; mode and a &quot;Personalized&quot; mode. The only difference between the two modes is in the naming of in-game characters. In &quot;Basic&quot; mode, the game randomly generates the name of the characters, whereas in &quot;Personalized&quot; mode, the player can supply the names of the characters. Although the game is simple, no two murder scenarios are exactly alike as the game randomizes attributes of the game like the victim, murder scene, murder weapon, and murderer.<br/><br/>The game can be run on Mac with the use of the freeware program &quot;boxer&quot;, and has been cloned in Javascript, enabling users to play it in an internet browser.<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;<a target='_blank' href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sleuth_(video_game),&quot' rel='nofollow'>http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sleuth_(video_game),&quot</a>; available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "146707": {"image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1788842.jpg", "poll": [], "boardgamedesigner": ["Mike Friesen", "Leif Steiestol"], "statistics": [], "yearpublished": "2014", "maxplayers": "6", "boardgameartist": ["John Ariosa"], "boardgamepublisher": ["Lamp Light Games Inc"], "maxplaytime": "60", "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1788842_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "60", "boardgamecategory": ["Humor", "Print & Play", "Racing", "Science Fiction", "Space Exploration"], "description": "It's the year 2047, and the world's atmosphere is filled with all manner of junk; those in charge have decided to do something about it.

Players then count the pips on their remaining dominoes in their  mastabas and add +1 points to their totals for the number of grave sites they started.<br/><br/>The player having the lowest score wins.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": ["First Edition"], "age": "10", "name": "Necropolis", "playingtime": "25", "boardgamemechanic": ["Set Collection", "Tile Placement"], "average": "7.5", "usersrated": "2", "boardgamefamily": ["Dominoes"]}, "146712": {"poll": [], "name": "Simutek Package One", "videogamemode": ["Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["TRS-80 (Adventure International) 5-1/4\" Disk edition", "TRS-80 (Adventure International) Cassette edition", "TRS-80 (Simutek) edition"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1780907.png", "videogametheme": ["Aliens", "Movie, Book, TV show", "Space", "War - Future", "War - Modern"], "videogamefranchise": ["Simutek Package"], "videogamedeveloper": ["(Self-Developed Video Game)"], "videogamegenre": ["Action", "Arcade", "Strategy"], "videogameplatform": ["TRS-80 Model I/III"], "usersrated": "0", "average": "0", "statistics": [], "videogamepublisher": ["Simutek"], "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1780907_t.png", "description": "Publisher's Catalog<br/><br/>Package One includes:<br/><br/>Graphic Trek &quot;2000&quot; -- This full graphics, real time game is full of fast, exciting action!

While the Golems and Relics are represented by physical game pieces and cards, the Golem Knights, Blood Knights, and Ancient Ones are digital units supplied through the app.<br/><br/>The Golems are your basic units, the body of the army itself. Relics are special equipment and constructs that can be carried into battle to help change the tide of war.

Ancient Ones are assigned to the army as a whole, and provide powerful Blessings, Curses, and Miracles when the player &ldquo;sacrifices&rdquo; mana.<br/><br/>Players stage their selected armies on the game map formed by the terrain tiles, and engage in one of a number of possible scenarios, including Last Man Standing, King of the Hill, and Victory Points/Missions. Using a turn-based Action Point system, players maneuver their Golems, call down blessings and curses, and assault the enemy until one player emerges victorious!<br/><br/>The Base Game Set includes six modular, double-sided terrain tiles to form the board, six fully painted and assembled Golem figures (40mm+ tall) with corresponding Golem cards, a TDI stylus, two 10-sided dice, two Control Cards, and a Quickstart Rules and Lore book.<br/><br/>The Golem Arcana app, which is a free download, is pre-loaded with a starting set of digital units including several Ancient Ones, Blood Knights, and Golem Knights. Additional Knights and Ancient Ones will be available for purchase to further expand and customize the player's army options. The app also supports up to eight players in a single game on one device through included multiplayer scenarios and a Scenario Creator that lets you generate your own.

It is an action-oriented first person shooter based on the Unreal Engine 2.0, that focuses heavily on team-based gameplay in both single-player and multi-player.<br/><br/>Devastation features standard first-person shooter gameplay, comparable to that of Unreal 2, as the game is based on Unreal 2's game engine. Notably, the game can be played in either &quot;arcade&quot; or &quot;tactical&quot; mode. Arcade mode features fast-paced action similar to that of many first person shooters, while tactical mode features slower gameplay more akin to tactical shooters such as Counter-Strike.<br/><br/>The single-player game focuses heavily on team-based gameplay. The player can have a squad of up to several NPCs following them at any given time. Each NPC can be issued one of 4 orders: attack, defend, follow, or stop. NPCs ordered to attack can independently make their way from the beginning to the end of the level without any guidance from the player, although they will stop moving and wait for the player to catch up if they get too far ahead of the player. In the game's initial levels, the game ends if any NPC squadmate is killed, but squadmate health regenerates fairly quickly to prevent this aspect of gameplay from being too frustrating.<br/><br/>The first 1/3 of the game features linear levels, with the player's goal being to make it from the start of the level to the end. About 1/3 of the way into the game, the player acquires a cloning machine that allows them and their squad members to respawn from death an infinite number of times. At this point, the only way to &quot;lose&quot; the game is to allow the enemy to capture and destroy the player's cloning machine. All levels from this point on are based on a capture the flag style of gameplay, with the rebel and Grathius teams starting on opposite sides of a non-linear level, each one tasked with capturing the other's cloning device.<br/><br/>Devastation also features 28 different weapons, divided into 8 categories: melee, pistols, sub-machine guns, assault rifles, sniper rifles, squad support weapons, and miscellaneous weapons.<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;Devastation (video game)&quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "146759": {"poll": [], "name": "Decatur", "playingtime": "120", "minplayers": "3", "boardgamemechanic": ["Commodity Speculation", "Point to Point Movement"], "yearpublished": "2014", "usersrated": "16", "boardgamesubdomain": ["Strategy Games"], "maxplayers": "7", "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2200596_t.jpg", "average": "7.75313", "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["Radio Tapir LLC"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2200596.jpg", "boardgameversion": ["First edition"], "maxplaytime": "120", "boardgamecategory": ["Civilization", "Economic"], "age": "0", "minplaytime": "120", "description": "You are the head of a vast enterprise, chartered by the Crown to engage in commercial activities in the eastern hemisphere.

Forming an adventuring posse, the Heroes venture down into the dark mines, overrun with all manner of ancient demons and foul creatures from another world. With tactical gameplay, lots of dice, and a robust card-driven exploration system, no two games are ever the same as the heroes explore the mines finding new enemies to fight, new loot to collect, and new dangers to overcome. Players can even find portals to other worlds, stepping through to continue their adventures on the other side!<br/><br/>An exciting campaign system allows the players to visit local frontier towns between adventures, spending their hard-earned loot and building their characters from game to game! As players find fantastic gear and artifacts to equip their heroes, they also gain experience from their adventures. This experience is used to level up, guiding the hero's path through an expansive, class-specific upgrade tree of new skills and abilities, allowing each player to develop their hero to fit their own play style.<br/><br/>In City of the Ancients, players will encounter portals to the otherworld on the Plains of Targa, finding an ancient frozen city whose living inhabitants are nowhere to be found.  Instead, great mechanical keepers wander the city going about their duties - until interrupted by the arrival of the players' characters!<br/><br/>So load up yer' six shooter, throw on yer' hat and

Adventure Battle Game is miniatures combat set in a retro-inspired Sci-Fi universe where each player commands heroes (or villains) referred to as solos and their companions (or henchmen) referred to as teams. Together, solos and teams form a crew. Players deploy their crews (usually according to scenario rules) and roll a die to determine who will be the &ldquo;first player&rdquo; at the start of the game. The highest number rolled (re-rolling any ties) is the &ldquo;first player&rdquo;. Each round the &ldquo;first player&rdquo; shifts, switching back and forth in a two player game and clockwise in a game of three or more players.<br/><br/>&quot;The game is played over one or more rounds where each player will have the opportunity to activate and perform actions with each member of their crew. Crew members are activated in order of initiative (highest to lowest). In the case of a tie the &ldquo;first player&rdquo; that round activates one crew member and when done the next player activates a crew member with that same initiative and so on until all crew members for all players with that initiative have been activated. Once all crew members have had a chance to perform actions the round is complete and a new one begins. Crew members may choose to hold their actions until a later point during the round. Activation of crew members that held their actions may be done between any later activations that round. In the case of more than one player wishing to activate a crew member that held their action the &ldquo;first player&rdquo; gets first choice and so on.<br/><br/>&quot;Once activated a crew member may not choose to perform one action and save the other. Any unused actions are lost.&quot;<br/><br/>"}, "146794": {"poll": [], "name": "Siege of Avalon", "videogamemode": ["Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["North American Windows edition"], "average": "3.25", "videogametheme": ["Fantasy"], "usersrated": "2", "videogamedeveloper": ["(Unknown)"], "videogamegenre": ["Action"], "videogameplatform": ["Windows"], "statistics": [], "videogamepublisher": ["BlackStar Studios"], "description": "Siege of Avalon takes place in the fictional land of Eurale. Within Eurale are seven kingdoms: Nisos, Aratoy, Oriam, Fornax, Elythria, Cathea, and Taberland. The seven kingdoms united into an uneasy alliance and built a citadel as a meeting place, which was named Avalon.<br/><br/>Within the land is a race of nomads known as the Sha'ahoul. Their religion values the earth and nature and therefore they are against farming, the building of permanent structures, and similar practices which they feel destroys the earth. After discovering the existence of Eurale, they declared war on the seven kingdoms to eradicate their way of life. As the war progresses, displaced war refugees have taken shelter in Avalon and the seven kingdoms have sent military support to defend Avalon as the citadel is seen as the last hope at stopping the Sha'ahoul. The Sha'ahoul and their leader, Mithras, chose to overtake the citadel by setting up a siege around it.<br/><br/>The game begins with an entry in the hero's journal. The siege has been going on for several years and his brother Corvus serves as part of the military in Avalon. When their father dies, the hero feels that it is his obligation to inform Corvus of the sad news, so he becomes part of the crew of a ship sailing from Elythria to Avalon to deliver supplies. The Sha'ahoul sinks all of the ships except the one the hero is on and the ship reaches Avalon without most of its supplies. It is not possible to make a return voyage to Elythria and so the hero decides to stay at Avalon and help out Avalon in whatever manner he can. The player gains control at this point and begins by speaking to Corvus and informing him about his father's death.

A number of Insurgent factions have sprung up hoping to undermine the government and send the country into a state of anarchy, in the belief they stand to gain power or wealth in the coming lawlessness.<br/><br/>Choose your side: Become one of three insurgent factions bent on sowing chaos by launching ever greater terror events, or make one last stand on behalf of the United States. If you can stand firm and keep this country from descending into anarchy you will restore the people's faith in its government and keep the American dream alive.&quot;<br/><br/>Threat Level Red is a game for 4 players where three players play the role of insurgent factions attacking from within the united states, and one player takes on the role of the hobbled, fading federal government.<br/><br/>As an insurgent faction your goal is to increase the anarchy level in the US to 20 by launching insurgent events. Each turn begins with a hidden token deployment phase where you must secretly plant sleeper cell and insurgent event tokens in major cities across the country. Once all the insurgent player's plans are set players then take turns revealing one secret token at time. Each sleeper cell token you activate increases the action points available to you to play your event cards, but also gives the US player more information about where you are planning your next event. Do you carry out small safer operations to draw additional event cards, cell tokens, and earn resources, or do you try to go all out and launch a major, but risky offensive by playing one of your major event cards? Once your organization has grown strong enough anything is possible- from a simple bomb threat, to hacking the nation's closed circuit TV network, or for the most powerful and violent factions building the dreaded suitcase nuke, but if the american player can deduce where your next event is taking place you stand to lose everything.<br/><br/>As the government player you seek to foil as many insurgent events as possible. If you can foil 12 insurgent events, or survive 5 game turns without the anarchy level rising to 20 points you are victorious. Unfortunately you are understaffed and nearly out of resources to face the burgeoning threats facing the nation. You begin the game with a small number of agent units that you must allocate between the major geographic &quot;zones&quot; of the united states. At the start of each turn you gain a small number of reinforcements: additional agent units and counterplot cards. Your counterplot cards will let you set up wiretaps, border patrols, undercover agents. Each time it is your turn you may send up to one agent token per &quot;zone&quot; to investigate a face down enemy token. If you correctly select a location of an insurgent event that event is discarded and you gain 1 stability point, but if the hidden token you reveal turns out to be an enemy sleeper cell the agent will most likely be lost in the ensuing gunfight. Since you have far fewer agents then your enemies have sleeper cells if you were to send your agents in to investigate every hint of insurgent activity you would soon be out of agents and quickly overrun. So instead, watch closely, let the insurgents overextend, give them enough rope to hang themselves before making your move. If you wait too long you risk letting another terror attack slip through your fingers, but if you strike at the right time even a small handful of well-trained agents can topple these immense terror networks.<br/><br/>"}, "146797": {"rpgartist": ["Gary Dupuis", "Jeff Freels", "Matt Jordan", "William McAusland", "Jason Mills", "Jeff Preston", "Simon Lee Tranter"], "rpgitemversion": ["PDF version"], "statistics": [], "name": "Tales of Stercoran", "rpgdesigner": ["Andy R.

A row and a column region extends from one side of the game frame to the other. A box  region can only be located in one of the game frame corners. Players take turns selecting one of the dice and placing it in the game frame. The goal is to be the first player to complete a number sequence using one of the 3 regions.<br/><br/>o Speed: This game mode is all about solving the same Sudoku like puzzle using the Region play mode as quickly as possible.

It crossed from the Portico of Aufstrag to the Withing uplands. Where the causeway met the plains, the soldiers of Aufstrag costructed a gatehouse. Two mighty bastions flanked the iron gate, so that any who passed must contend with the garrison within. The causeway wound its way across the marshland, held above the water and muck upon mighty pylons of stone that were shaped like the gods of dwarves- slaves, to Unklar&rsquo;s mind.

The first of the new exotic darkmantles is the death&rsquo;s hood darkmantle (CR 3), whose smaller size is not the liability that it initially seems, as it allows it to better conform to the faces of its victims. It attaches itself to its prey&rsquo;s face and quickly strangles it, then uses the corpse like a puppet for its own nefarious ends. The equally insidious shadow weaver darkmantle (CR 5) is more powerful in areas of darkness, and is surrounded by an aura that subtly lowers the light level around it. Finally, the goliath darkmantle (CR 8) is a huge darkmantle whose favored tactic is to drop from above on unsuspecting victims, and can grapple a large number of victims at once, weakening them with its acidic drool before swallowing them whole.<br/><br/>"}, "146924": {"poll": [], "name": "Mediterranean Fleets:  Command at Sea Volume XII", "playingtime": "0", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": ["Hex-and-Counter", "Simulation"], "yearpublished": "2013", "boardgameexpansion": ["Command at Sea (4th Edition)"], "usersrated": "7", "boardgamefamily": ["Command at Sea"], "maxplayers": "12", "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1833188_t.png", "average": "7", "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["Clash of Arms Games"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1833188.png", "boardgameversion": ["First Edition"], "maxplaytime": "0", "boardgamecategory": ["Expansion for Base-game", "Miniatures", "Nautical", "Wargame", "World War II"], "age": "12", "minplaytime": "0", "description": "(from Clash of Arms website:)<br/><br/>Mediterranean Fleets includes over 150 ships and 90 aircraft!

Object is to collect all the cards.<br/><br/>Royal Fluster<br/><br/>Players are dealt five cards from a modified standard deck and attempt to put together a Royal Flush by drawing and discarding cards. If you discard an Ace, you must draw a Fluster card and follow the instructions, hoping not to be harmed. The first player to make a royal flush wins the game.<br/><br/>Spit!<br/><br/>Each player deals 4 stacks with 7 down and the 8th card up. Play with only one hand (right, unless left-handed). At the same time, all players turn one card from the remaining deck face up in the center to start N piles. All may add to any pile. Ignore suits and colors. Build up or down, and change directions if you want: 5-6-7-6-7-6-7-8-9, etc. Numbers make a complete circle: 10-J-Q-K-A-2-3-4. Play only one card at a time from the top of of a stack onto a center pile; do not move cards sideways to create sequences on own stacks. Keep playing until ALL have used all their card piles.<br/><br/>Three Throws<br/><br/>This game has a theme of rock-scissors-paper. It is played in two different rounds. In the first round, players take turns turning up cards on a face-down tableau. If they turn up a set of winners, these cards are taken into hand. When all of the card possible are taken, the second round begins, which is essentially a game of war between players.<br/><br/>"}, "146935": {"poll": [], "name": "G.I.

Beware however of other players, as they can steal some of your cards, or destroy parts of your empire. The game calls for cunning placement of your cards in your empire and shrewd bidding in the auction phase.

The path to this ultimate goal rests on a player's ability to successfully maneuver around the playing field and utilize the special super powers of General Zod and Superman.<br/><br/>Includes:<br/>1 Superman #101 miniature<br/>1 General Zod #106 miniature<br/>2 Character cards<br/>1 Full Color Game Board<br/>2 Dice (Six Sided)<br/>32 Tokens(Two factions)<br/><br/>"}, "146978": {"poll": [], "name": "Shadow Force", "videogamemode": ["Cooperative", "Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["Japanese Arcade edition", "North American Arcade edition"], "average": "0", "videogametheme": ["Fantasy", "Science Fiction"], "usersrated": "0", "videogamedeveloper": ["Technos Japan"], "videogamegenre": ["Beat 'em Up"], "videogameplatform": ["Arcade"], "statistics": [], "videogamepublisher": ["Technos Japan"], "description": "User Summary<br/><br/>A beat em up game for one or two players.
