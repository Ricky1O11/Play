In his wake, he left the hacking coughs and pain-filled moans of the dying and the wails of the survivors mourning their dead. Over half the population died, and many of the survivors packed and fled.<br/><br/>A few folk yet dwell in Ashford among the abandoned, deserted homes of their friends and neighbours but it is now a quiet, mournful place.

Great social influence and a prestigious tea house may come in handy to propitiate the province inspector.

Class Expansions is a series of lightweight supplements for The Pathfinder Roleplaying Game that takes a base class and offers alternative class features that, handily enough, each fit on one page or less.<br/><br/>Following in this vein, Class Expansions: The Unhorsed Cavalier fixes one of the major problems of the cavalier class, the mount. Let's consider this for a moment. Back in the days of 3.5, one of the paladin's big class features was this superintelligent horse with all sorts of bells and whistles hanging off of it like some sort of gnome had cooked it up as a genetic engineering experiment. Awesome stuff! Until it took one look at the dungeon stairs and shook its head no.<br/><br/>And there was much complaining.<br/><br/>Pathfinder comes out and the paladin gets the ability to swap out the horse for some sort of holy sword!<br/><br/>There was much rejoicing!<br/><br/>Fast forward a couple of years and an advanced guide comes out containing the cavalier, who has a horse.<br/><br/>See above.<br/><br/>This product features a quartet of cavalier archetypes, all of which throw away the mount for something different.<br/><br/>Attended Knight - Grab a peasant, slap heraldry on him, and treat him like a golf caddie for your weapons!<br/><br/>Longshanks - Glare at those with horses as though they are lesser individuals and show them you know how to hustle with your own two feet. Bonuses to movement while in heavy armor, the ability to hustle while in heavy armor with no penalties whatsoever, max dex and armor check penalties, and Endurance as a bonus feat await those who take this archetype.<br/><br/>Seeker of All Knowledge - An enhanced version of the Order of the Tome, give up your horse because you're too busy with the book your nose is stuck in.<br/><br/>Wind-kissed Knight - Arcane magic is a semisentient thing. Like gods, it goes around and picks out champions to do its bidding, which is quite simple. Read the meters. That guy with the arcane deathray? He's using too much magic. Shut it down. That wizard pulling all the pointless pranks? Poke him on the shoulder. Make him stop. In short, the cavalier becomes a sort of arcane paladin, serving the whims of a great, but nearly mindless cosmic force that really just wants the wizards to get off its lawn so it can get to sleep. In return, the cavalier gains access to potent arcane magic as well as defenses against the very wizards he will likely upset time and time again.<br/><br/>"}, "143445": {"rpgdesigner": ["Dominic Skinner"], "rpg": ["Mystic Quests"], "statistics": [], "name": "Mystic Quests: The Shimmering Isle", "rpgartist": ["Dominic Skinner"], "rpgproducer": ["Dominic Skinner"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1677500.png", "usersrated": "0", "rpgitemversion": ["PDF version"], "average": "0", "rpggenre": ["Fantasy (High Fantasy)"], "rpgpublisher": ["(Web published)"], "rpgcategory": ["Sourcebook (rules/options to enhance play)"], "poll": [], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1677500_t.png", "description": "From publisher blurb:<br/><br/>The free expansion to the Mystic Quests: Core Rulebook.

The purpose of the mission was, as always, to deliver the precious ore Redennium to minor planetoids whose civilisations had evolved beyond primitive nuclear power and were seeking out new methods of energy transferrence from common elements found on their home planets. Redennium was rare in these far flung regions of the Xanotar system, consequently most governments of these planetoids were only too eager to accept samples of new elements, particularly Redennium whose energy transferrence characteristics were second to none.<br/><br/>After successfully trading the current load of Redennium and also receiving, as part payment for the consignment, a strange but interesting creature for the intergalactic zoo on your home planet, you and your crew set course for home. Initially the trip is uneventful except for a minor disturbance when the creature broke out of its cage and took to rolling about playfully in the remains of the Redennium ore left in the cargo hold.<br/><br/>After recapturing the creature and placing it back in its cage, the Pulsar 7 resumed its monotonous course for home. In the following days, however, the creature becomes restless and begins to grow at an astonishing rate.

It was released on IOS on Thursday, 25 April 2013. This sequel expands upon the original's template by adding new maneuvers like the &quot;Rainbow Savior&quot; and &quot;Gallow's Gallop.&quot; It also introduces enemies, missions, and the option to customise your unicorn's appearance.<br/><br/>The game also introduces the ability to fly, by equipping wings that you unlock in game, to your unicorn. The core gameplay remains the same as in the original browser game, the unicorn will run automatically, while you control the jump and a dash attack. But while the controls are the same, the game has also been fleshed out with a number of new ideas. You can collect coins that can be used to customize your robotic steed with everything from a flaming tail to demon wings, and there are missions that you can complete to unlock new content and abilities. There are even enemies now in the form of giant, laser spewing golems, and friendly cyborg-unicorn-whales that flies past in the background. The visuals have also received a makeover. The unicorn itself is much more detailed and fluid, and the painted backgrounds also have much more depth and detail.<br/><br/>This is the first Robot Unicorn Attack that includes in game purchases, in the form of buying credits to upgrade your Unicorn and additional sound-packs. Also Erasure's seminal song &quot;Always&quot; - which was a main part of the original game - is not part of the default package and must be purchased separately for $0.99. &quot;I will never be able to separate Always from Robot Unicorn Attack,&quot; wrote Kieron Gillen back in 2010. &quot;I can't even imagine wanting to do such a thing. It'd be like decapitating the Mona Lisa. It merges with the sparkles of sound effects and the explosions of light and makes it complete. ALWAYS IT WANTS TO BE WITH YOU.&quot; The song is not included with the default game due to copyright, and as adult swim wanted the game to be free-to-play they made it an in-game purchase. Also a message that reads &quot;To offer Robot Unicorn Attack 2 for free, we had to make the licensed music an in-app purchase,&quot; displays when you first open the options menu. Other songs are available for purchase too by such bands as Blind Guardian, Slade, Limahl and Corey Hart<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;Robot Unicorn Attack&quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "143016": {"poll": [], "name": "Arranger!", "videogamemode": ["Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["iPhone/iPad edition"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1669434.png", "videogametheme": ["Fantasy", "Music"], "usersrated": "0", "videogamedeveloper": ["(Self-Developed Video Game)"], "videogamegenre": ["Adventure", "RPG"], "videogameplatform": ["iPad", "iPhone"], "average": "0", "statistics": [], "videogamepublisher": ["(Web published)"], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1669434_t.png", "description": "[Developed by Arman Bohn.]<br/><br/>What is Arranger?<br/><br/>Arranger is a musical/adventure/rpg that combines elements of classic video games with a large, open game world. Players scour the land of Musica in search of 16 instruments and 8 chalices in a quest to become the next king of the realm. The game was created by Arman Bohn and published by Ayopa Games.<br/><br/>The game consists of 9 different worlds to explore. Each world contains a song to &quot;arrange&quot; for a character that needs some musical assistance. There are a huge number of minigames that must be completed to unlock instruments, chalices, items and new areas. Twenty four of the minigames can be unlocked and replayed competitively on Game Center leaderboards.<br/><br/>How do you arrange music in the game?<br/><br/>In Arranger, you find and unlock new musical instruments by playing minigames. Smash yucky fleaks or toss rainburgs into hungry mouths and maybe you'll be rewarded with a shiny trombone or slick synth. Certain citizens of Musica will ask for some musical assistance. To arrange music for them, you chose 3 instruments from your current &quot;repertoire&quot;. Each character will react differently to your selections, so chose wisely! Once you have selected your instruments, you must enter the listener's mind and blast away at their glowing cortex! Use the unique properties of each instrument to your advantage and convince the listener that you arrangement is good!<br/><br/>Seriously?<br/><br/>Yes.<br/><br/>Do I need to find specific instruments to arrange certain songs?<br/><br/>Nope. The game is designed so that you could potentially collect all 16 instruments before attempting to compose a song for someone. Each instrument has unique properties (flame throwing saxophone, laser blasting guitar, bomb tossing tuba ...) so it's best to have a good arsenal ... er ... collection before you try to &quot;convince&quot; a listener that your arrangement rocks. If you would like to replay any of the songs you have completed, you can always head back to the Music School and rearrange them with any instruments that you have in your &quot;repertoire&quot;. In all, there are over 5,000 possible musical combinations in the game!<br/><br/>How do I win the game?<br/><br/>Once you have searched the kingdom of Musica and collected all 8 chalices, you must return the king and prove yourself as a worthy arranger.<br/><br/>What inspired you to make this game?<br/><br/>I grew up playing old school games like &quot;Space Quest III&quot;, &quot;The Legend of Zelda&quot;, and of course &quot;Adventure&quot; on the Atari 2600. I wanted to combine my favorite elements of these games and add in some modern touches (fast re-playable minigames, quest logs ...). Arranger is my tribute to an era of gaming that painted in broad strokes and big pixels ... and players had some room to use their imagination.<br/><br/>Source: The Game Website.<br/><br/>"}, "143017": {"poll": [], "name": "LEGO Star Wars: The Yoda Chronicles", "videogamemode": ["Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["iPhone/iPad edition"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1669417.png", "videogameseries": ["LEGO Star Wars"], "videogametheme": ["Science Fiction"], "videogamegenre": ["Real Time Strategy"], "videogamedeveloper": ["LEGO"], "videogamefranchise": ["LEGO", "Star Wars"], "videogameplatform": ["iPad", "iPhone"], "usersrated": "1", "average": "5", "statistics": [], "videogamepublisher": ["LEGO"], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1669417_t.png", "description": "User Summary<br/><br/>A free-to-play real time strategy game for the iOS.

Players command small warbands in small unit combat situations.  You can acquire 28mm miniatures from any source you choose.  The skirmish game uses a stat card for each unit, and each card has a brief description of an appropriately sculpted and posed miniature.<br/><br/>Sellsword is frequently played with very limited magic.  It has a number of different fantasy levels, each listed on a particular unit&rsquo;s stat cards.  The more fantastic a unit&rsquo;s abilities, the higher its fantasy level.  This permits each skirmish played to have a cap on the fantasy level, as the players desire.  This is different from a number of roleplaying and skirmish games currently available, where magic runs rampant and high fantasy is the norm.  The Sellsword world is perhaps just a bit darker, and a bit grittier.  In this way, the Sellsword world is also closer to our own earth.  There may be magic, but it is frequently subtle.  In similar fashion, science is very limited in Sellsword.  You may find that a lightning bolt and a bonfire both do similar types of damage.  There is no &lsquo;electrical&rsquo; damage, since electricity does not exist.  Most people in the Sellsword world know that bad things live in the dark corners of the world, that poison and disease are kindred maladies, and that this is the world where they earn their place in the afterlife.<br/><br/>If the game seems a little daunting, don't despair.  The basic game is a good introduction to the system, and you can graduate to the full skirmish game after that.  The skirmish game is designed to be played by friends at home, or in a tournament scene.<br/><br/>For those of you that don&rsquo;t like Grids, we&rsquo;ll have variant rules for that as well.<br/><br/>"}, "143019": {"poll": [], "name": "Yakuza 1 & 2 HD", "videogamemode": ["Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["Japanese Wii U edition", "Wii U eShop edition"], "average": "0", "videogameseries": ["Yakuza"], "videogametheme": ["Crime", "Yakuza / Samurai"], "usersrated": "0", "videogamedeveloper": ["SEGA Corporation"], "videogamegenre": ["Action Adventure", "Beat 'em Up", "Sandbox"], "videogameplatform": ["Wii U"], "statistics": [], "videogamepublisher": ["SEGA Corporation"], "videogamecompilation": ["Yakuza", "Yakuza 2"], "description": "<br/><br/><br/>    <br/>        <br/>UNRELEASED GAME &ndash; IN DEVELOPMENT<br/><br/>    <br/>    <br/>        <br/>This game has not been released yet, therefore some of the information above may change in the future.

The regal manticore, introduced in this book, takes the more majestic, non-winged form favored in the middle ages (though it is no less monstrous for doing so). The razor manticore, by contrast, bristles with natural weaponry, gaining a deadly spiked horn, and the ability to use its teeth to gnaw opponents, to devastating results.

For one thing, if your players have a habit of browsing through such books, or are long-time veterans who know the basic ins and outs of most fantasy staples, you may need an unusual stat-block just to throw them a curve ball and teach them that they can&rsquo;t count on their out of character knowledge to take all the mystery out of the game. Alternatively, many GMs can recall a time when they wanted to make use of a certain monster in their game, only to find that it was a few CRs too high or low for what they had in mind.<br/><br/>Exotic Encounters takes a single, iconic monster, and creates three new variants on that theme. These variants aren&rsquo;t simple tweaks, and are more than simply advancing or removing Hit Dice, though that occurs as well. Each of these three variations on the monster&rsquo;s theme has a specific, flavorful goal in mind, and a role to play, and their statistics entries are gently massaged in order to make them fit those roles. Further, each of these variants comes with brand new specially-crafted special abilities, which are unique to Exotic Encounters and not found anywhere else.<br/><br/>This particular installment of Exotic Encounters focuses on the majestic griffon. Griffons have captured our imagination since ancient times, and have long been considered to be the king of beasts. More modern approaches to griffons see them as anything from noble steeds to feral and savage monsters, and everything in between. Here, you will find the dwarf griffon, a much smaller sub-species that is known for its propensity for diving hit-and-run tactics, the myllisthor griffon, a species of griffon specially-bred by elves to serve as elite mounts for their best scouts, and which are capable of flying at extreme speeds, and the redclaw griffon, tough and territorial beasts that live in high and rugged terrain and fight with an extreme and savage ferocity.<br/><br/>"}, "143028": {"poll": [], "name": "Haunted Hollow", "videogamemode": ["Hotseat", "Network Multiplayer", "Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["iPhone/iPad edition"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1669333.png", "videogametheme": ["Fantasy", "Horror"], "usersrated": "1", "videogamedeveloper": ["Firaxis Games, Inc."], "videogamegenre": ["Strategy"], "videogameplatform": ["iPad", "iPhone"], "average": "5", "statistics": [], "videogamepublisher": ["2K Games, Inc."], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1669333_t.png", "description": "2K and Firaxis Games, the critically acclaimed studio responsible for the award-winning XCOM&reg;: Enemy Unknown and Sid Meier's Civilization&reg; series, today announced their latest mobile title, Haunted Hollow, will be available for iOS devices worldwide this spring.

The first is party creation.  A party consists of four characters and any followers a player chooses to add.  Each character is created based on one of the hero miniatures the player chose to use.  Heroes are built much like characters in a role-playing game, with attributes, skills, traits and gear.  Among the most often used traits are the follower traits.  Depending on how many trait choices a hero is given a follower can be an assistant or a powerful beast.<br/><br/>A game begins by players rolling for which of the eight scenarios they will be playing.  Depending on the scenario each player is given a number of terrain points with which they can customize the table.  A game has at least five rounds, at the end of round 5, and each turn after, one of the players will roll to see if the game ends.  At the beginning of each round players roll for initiative.  The player that wins initiative takes his or her turn. During a player's turn each member of his or her party may take one action.  Examples of actions include Sprint, Charge, Cast a Spell, and Searching Terrain. Searching, combat and some hero traits give a party victory points, the party with the most victory points wins the game.<br/><br/>Finally, once a game has come to an end players roll to determine the treasure they have picked up, if any of their miniatures take permanent injuries, and collect experience for their heroes.  Once all that is settled players take turns having a miniature in their party take an out of game action.  Examples of out of game action include selling unwanted items, creating items, ritual spells and completing quests found during game play.

Any sprawl worth its mettle has its dark corners, its forgotten places, its spots that are just as wild and untamed as the deepest rainforest.<br/><br/>Seattle, the prime metroplex in the world for shadowrunning, is filled with such places, and Sprawl Wilds gives shadowrunners a chance to tour them. From a fortress-like Barrens farm recovering from a mysterious attack to a dark secret hidden in a clinic, runners have a chance to see the sites most people never encounter, and uncover information that some people want to stay secret at any cost. They&rsquo;ll meet jaded smugglers, wary police officers, passionate activists, hardened criminals, wounded warriors, and at least one deranged killer. The questions are, will they survive long enough to collect a paycheck&mdash;and how much of the sprawl will be nothing more than dust when they&rsquo;re done with it?<br/><br/>Sprawl Wilds is a collection of Shadowrun Missions developed for major summer gaming conventions. These adventures have been adapted for both Shadowrun, Twentieth Anniversary Edition and Shadowrun, Fifth Edition, and they provide hours of shadowrunning goodness for experienced street veterans and new shadowrunners alike. With complete game information, including NPC stats, these adventures are poised to plunge players into urban chaos!<br/><br/>From retailers preview:<br/>Shadowrunners know they don&rsquo;t have to wander out of their sprawls to find spaces as wild and untamed as any jungle.

However, one day, Shantae is approached by her old nemesis, Risky Boots, who informs her that her genie magic was shattered into thirty shards. These shards had fused with Risky's minions, causing them to become more powerful and overthrow Risky, plotting to ressurect her old mentor, The Pirate Master, spelling doom for all of Sequin Land.<br/><br/>Offering a deal in which Shantae can regain her magic and Risky can regain her former glory, the two strike up a reluctant alliance to recover the magic shards and thwart Pirate Master's revival.

These items include daggers, pistols, scimitars, cannons and anchor grappling hooks.<br/><br/>Many of these items have multiple uses; the daggers, for example, can be used to create footholds on walls as well as attack enemies.

Your people have gathered into two great cities awaiting word on how you will ship them to another world, their new home. It is time to Abandon Earth.<br/><br/>Introducing the first of the Bagged Game Originals (&quot;BGO&quot;) series, Abandon Earth by designer Tom Decker is a multiplayer game in which you aim to get your people to a new world that they can call home. Manage your actions wisely by searching for survivors, researching new technology, training and sending off marines to fight back, and launching rockets containing the last remaining survivors of Planet Earth. Score more Victory Points before everyone else and declare yourself (and your people) victorious!<br/><br/>Each turn you are limited to one action per remaining city that you control. You will be able to choose between developing your infrastructure, researching technology, spending resources, or counter-attacking the aliens.

Mini Motor Racing also uses Apple's iCloud to store and sync progress across iOS 5 devices.<br/><br/>Mini Motor racing is an arcade-style racer with strong emphasis on fun over realism. Rather than controlling acceleration and braking, the user must instead master powerslides and timely nitrous boosts to succeed. Cars regularly crash into the environment and each other, but there is no vehicle damage, only a time penalty. The game uses a modified version of the Unity physics engine to model these collisions.<br/><br/>Placing first, second, or third in a race nets the player cash rewards, which can be supplemented through in-game cash power ups. This money is used to unlock additional vehicles and tracks, or to upgrade existing vehicles when playing career mode.<br/><br/>The game uses HD graphics, and while the game is set in an isometric view, the cars and tracks are full 3D models. Several control schemes are available for the user's selection, though physical controls such as those on the Sony Xperia Play are not supported.<br/><br/>Mini Motor Racing uses Apple's Game Center platform for social play, featuring competitive per-track leaderboards and achievements.

During the 19th century, the game spread in Spain, becoming one of the most popular card games in the country. The name of the game was later modified by Spanish speakers, who started calling the game Tute. The game is played with a deck of traditional Spanish playing cards, or naipes, that is very similar to the Italian 40-card deck.<br/><br/>The classic version of the game is Two-player Tute, while the most played is Tute in Pairs, where four players form two teams. The object of the game is to score the most points in the baza (a pile next to a player that contains the cards that the player gets after winning a trick) and by declarations (holding certain combinations of cards). Due to its wide popularity, several variations of the game exist.<br/><br/>The game is played with a Spanish deck of cards, which is divided into four suits: Oros (coins), Espadas (spades), Copas (cups) and Bastos (clubs). The 8s and 9s of each suit are excluded, leaving forty cards in the deck. The object of the game is to score the most points in the baza and from declarations.<br/><br/>Tute in Pairs is played by four players&mdash;two teams of two players each&mdash;and every player receives ten cards (since there are 40 cards, this means that all of the cards in the deck are dealt). The last card to be dealt is shown to the rest of the players and becomes the trump. This card belongs to the player it was dealt to. The four people sit in a circle, with opponent players to the right and left of each player, and players sitting opposite their team members.<br/><br/>One person plays a card, and the player to the right of this person, from the opponent team, plays a card. As with Two-player Tute, if the second player has one or more higher cards of the same suit as the first player's card, one of these must be played. If the second player has cards of the same suit, but only ones of less value than the first card, one of these must be played. If the second player does not have any cards of the same suit but has one or more trump cards, one of these must be played. If the second player has no cards of the same suit and no trumps, any other card can be played.<br/><br/>Now, the next player to the right plays a card following the same rules as the second player: if possible, a card of the same suit as the first player's card must be played, higher than the first two cards if possible; or if this is not possible, then lower; if no card of the same suit is held, then if possible, a trump card must be played; if no trump card is held, then any card may be played. The fourth player likewise plays a card following these same rules.<br/><br/>When all four cards of the trick are on the table, the pair that played the card with the strongest card wins the hand. The trump suit beats the other three suits, with the ranking of trump cards from strongest to weakest as follows: Ace-3-King-Knight-Knave-7-6-5-4-2. The next strongest suit is the one the first player played, again with the card rankings being Ace-3-King-Knight-Knave-7-6-5-4-2. Cards of the other two suits always lose to trumps and the first player's suit. The winning team places the four cards from the trick into their baza. The rules for the declarations are similar to Two-player Tute, but it is mandatory to declare the cards after a player or the partner begins a baza. Only the scoring team can declare. To declare their cards, the opposing team has to begin a baza. Declaring cards in the plays that follow the beginning of a baza is not allowed. After the hand is over, the counting starts (see Scoring below). When the counting ends, and after the score is calculated, the cards in the bazas are mixed again in a single stack to be dealt at the start of the next round. The deal of cards rotates counter-clockwise during the subsequent hands<br/><br/>Tute games are played until an established number of game points is reached. Each time one of the competitors wins a round, one point is added to the total score of the player or pair. New rounds are played until a player or pair reaches the game points goal (three and six point games are the most common). When the number is reached the player or pair wins.<br/><br/>The winner (or the pair of winners) of the round is determined by the total of round points each player (or pair) collects. These points are calculated as the sum of card values in baza, bonus points for declarations and the final trick bonus.<br/><br/>A player (or a pair), who wins at least one trick receives an ability to gain more round points upon declaring the card combinations. In Tute in Pairs the declarations can be performed until the end of round; in Two-player Tute this ability persists until only two cards are left in the deck.<br/><br/>The player, who collected all the four Kings, is entitled to declare tute (all), which automatically ends the round with a collector's victory. Having both King and Knight of the trump suit, one can declare las cuarenta (forty), scoring additional 40 round points. The combination of King and Knight of any other suit can be declared as veinte (twenty); it adds 20 round points to the player's score. If possible, a player can declare several combination. In such cases the declarations with the higher round point value must be made first. For example, after declaring veinte the player loses right to declare las cuarenta, though declaring another veinte is still allowed. In Two-player games the declaration order rule only applies to declarations between each trick is played, so the player can declare las cuarenta after veinte if the combination is collected by picking the previously missing card from the stock.<br/><br/>The total of the round points the player (or pair) has gained is calculated as the sum of values of the cards collected in the baza and the values of the declared combinations. The winner of the last trick also receives ten bonus round points. The total value of the deck (and thus the maximum amount of round points) is 230 points.<br/><br/>"}, "143075": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1718403.jpg", "poll": [], "boardgamedesigner": ["Mark Rivera"], "statistics": [], "yearpublished": "2013", "maxplayers": "6", "boardgamepublisher": ["Backspindle Games Ltd.", "Ediciones MasQueOca"], "maxplaytime": "15", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1718403_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "15", "boardgamecategory": ["Action / Dexterity", "Dice", "Sports"], "boardgamehonor": ["2014 UK Games Expo Best Family Game Winner"], "description": "The fast-rolling, hard-hitting, body-slamming, neck-crunching, chair-smashing, table-slapping dice game for 2 or 4 players...<br/><br/>Luchador!

She has.<br/><br/>While some individuals, the druids and rangers of the world, learn to coexist and be one with nature, other individuals, the alchemists of the world, learn to harness nature and force it to do their bidding. The herbalists of the world take a path between these two extremes. Herbalists see the natural world as a tool to be revered, a cornucopia of plenty that needs to be properly exercised to extract full benefit from it. From the smallest shelf mushroom to the greatest of flora, the herbalist knows the inner secrets of all things that grow upon this earth.<br/><br/>Designed to play as an assassin / rogue / chaos druid, the herbalist uses the plants around her as a substitute for spells per day. As such, she is dependant upon her surroundings as a means of power acquisition. That is to say, if she is in the forest, the plants she can acquire are vastly different from those in the desert. Each biome (desert, forest, grasslands, mountains, tundra, underground, and wetlands) has been carefully balanced to provide healing, support, offensive, and defensive capabilities regardless of where the herbalist is.<br/><br/>Now, the idea of randomly generating &quot;plants per day&quot; may seem a bit daunting. Fear not! All the complexity has been boiled down to a few rolls on one of a set of simple tables. What's more, each biome has been summarized on a single sheet, including the functions of each herb in that biome, and each summary sheet contains a handy column for recording just how many of that herb the herbalist has.<br/><br/>&quot;Alright, but what about moving from biome to biome? Won't I lose access to the plants I like?&quot;<br/><br/>Well, yes and no. Though an herbalist will lose access to going out and picking a biome's herbs if not in that biome, she always has the option to plant her favorite plants in terra cotta pots that she hauls around, thus letting her always be sure that certain tactical options will ALWAYS be available, no matter how strange her daily plants pool may be. Further, an herbalist can carry over a small subset of her plants per day to the next day, allowing her to benefit from a glut of an herb she particularly enjoys and giving her the ability to survive the lack of an herb she leans upon heavily.<br/><br/>&quot;Fine, but isn't the idea of having everything an entire biome can do small enough to fit on a page rather limiting?&quot;<br/><br/>Again, no! The herbalist can cook down her herbs using recipes to create new and exciting concoctions, some of which are wildly different from what they started out as!<br/><br/>&quot;What if I end up somewhere that isn't one of your biomes? What if there are no plants at all?&quot;<br/><br/>The notion of an area with no plants is addressed within the class mechanics. If a new and exciting biome comes along, the very system used to create the standard biomes in the first place is presented in its entirety at the back of the document, including the raw, editable tables used to make the tables within the supplement in the first place!

First player looks at the card on the table and at the cards in their hand.<br/><br/>If their is an oxygen card that can make two single bonds on the table, for example, first player needs to have a card in their hand that can also make a single bond.  This is easy to see by the design of the cards.  If the quality of the lines fit together, you have a bond.  An oxygen is worth 8 points.  If you bond a hydrogen to it, worth 1 point, you would get a total of 8 points for this move.  If this player does not have any single bonding cards, they could also play a noble gas, if they have one.  Neon, for example, would be worth ten points.  They would then put this noble gas card in their winnings stack.  They could also play an ion card.  Sodium, for example, would be worth 11 points, but it would stay on the table.  If NONE of these options is available, they must draw from the deck until they get a card that matches the one up on the table.<br/><br/>If a player is the last one to place an atom card onto the growing molecule in the middle of the table, meaning their are no more empty slots to bond any cards to, they not only get their points, but they get to keep all the cards in this molecule.   They stack up the cards and put it in their winnings pile, along with noble gasses or ion cards won.  In order to win the ion cards, a player must have the other half of the arrow pictured on the ion card.  They get the points for both cards, and then put them in their stack.  When one player has run out of cards, players add up the points they earned, plus ONE point for each card in their winnings stack.  They then subtract any points left in their hand.  If desired, play up to 200 points, or end the game after all players have had a chance to go first.<br/><br/>"}, "143092": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1671114.jpg", "poll": [], "boardgamedesigner": ["Bryan Pope", "Benjamin Pope"], "statistics": [], "yearpublished": "2013", "maxplayers": "2", "boardgameartist": ["Tiziano Baracchi", "Leonardo Borazio", "Nick Deligaris", "Jason Engle", "Mariusz Gandzel", "Pavel Guzenko", "Diego Gisbert Llorens", "Maichol Quinto", "Addison Rankin", "Lorraine Schleter", "Craig J.

To round out the divine might of this Mage is his Holy Avenger ability.<br/><br/>A few of the creatures in this expansion, such as the Guardian Angel, are ready to defend their Mage at any cost and thus introduce the Intercept ability which allows them to jump in the way of ranged attacks if they are on guard.

In the basic included scenario, players are locked inside of the mall and searching for keys to unlock a door and a radio that will allow them to call for help and be rescued.<br/><br/>Zombie Mall can be played as a cooperative game, with all players working together toward the end goal of being rescued.  Zombie Mall may also be played where it&rsquo;s every man for himself (sometimes you have to sacrifice a friend to keep from becoming zombie food).<br/><br/>While searching the mall, players will come across Loot (random items &amp; events) and will find Objectives (hopefully one of those keys that will unlock something important, but possibly something not helpful &ndash; such as a swarm of hiding zombies).<br/><br/>That mall map is constructed from Map Tiles which may be configured differently each time you play Zombie Mall.  Sample layouts are shown in Sample Tile Layouts.  The size of your mall directly affects the difficulty, as larger malls will take longer to search and increase the odds of running into hordes of hungry zombies.<br/><br/>One thing that makes Zombie Mall different from many other games in the zombie genre is that players aren&rsquo;t forced to constantly scrounge for weapons.  Basic combat takes into account that players are grabbing whatever is handy and using everything possible as a weapon.  In addition, the players are not treated as ninja trained since childhood, so those randomly grabbed items are more than likely thrown or lodged into a zombie when used.  There are weapons to be found, but the odds are good that a given weapon won&rsquo;t be durable for more than a couple of uses.<br/><br/>"}, "143116": {"poll": [], "name": "Arrow One Adventure", "videogamemode": ["Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["Apple II 5-1/4\" Disk edition", "Apple II Cassette edition", "Atari 8-bit 5-1/4\" Disk edition", "Atari 8-bit Cassette edition", "TRS-80 5-1/4\" Disk edition", "TRS-80 Cassette edition"], "average": "0", "videogameseries": ["Adventure of the Month"], "videogametheme": ["Aliens", "Science Fiction"], "usersrated": "0", "videogamedeveloper": ["(Self-Developed Video Game)"], "videogamegenre": ["Text Adventure"], "videogameplatform": ["Apple II", "Atari 8-bit family", "TRS-80 Model I/III"], "statistics": [], "videogamepublisher": ["SoftSide Publications"], "videogamecompilation": ["Adventure SuperDisk Number 5"], "description": "Publisher Advertisement<br/><br/>You are Adam Trent, a trouble-shooter for the Federation of Space.

Until this game is released, please don't submit images for it unless given direct written permission from the publisher which must be noted in the image caption.<br/><br/>    <br/><br/><br/>From the Kickstarter Page:<br/><br/>Time Heroes, in its default setting, is about stopping the evil sorceress Morgan la Fey from altering time as we know it.<br/><br/>Morgan la Fey has come to a point in history where magic has long since died but before technology has evolved to completely replace it (basically, the present). She has torn open rips in the fabric of space and time to draw through armies from the past and future with which she intends to make the Earth her own. She has managed to place a time bubble around a few year block that has been separated from the normal passage of time. Her goal is to take control of the planet, send people back and then drop the bubble, altering the course of history in one fell swoop.<br/><br/>The Great Merlini, last living descendent of Merlin has gone from simple stage magician to discovering the power of his ancestor within himself with the assistance of his ancestor&rsquo;s book of magic, the Bionomipro. He is using this power to draw his own people through time and space in order to hold back la Fey's ambitions. While the bubble around the present allows la Fey to bring people through without repercussions, it also prevents going back to alter events that have already happened within the bubble itself. Essentially, if Merlini can keep Morgan la Fey at bay for a few years, the bubble will drop and normality will be restored.<br/><br/>So that's the basic lore behind the setting. But how do I see this play out in the game itself?<br/><br/>Time Heroes is meant to be a zany romp for a group of players. Ultimately, I envision it along the lines of a television show or cartoon where, though there may be arcs here and there, primarily each session is its own episode and - much like, Inspector Gadget, for example - Morgan la Fey will always barely slip away at the end of each &quot;episode.&quot; Obviously the reasoning behind this is because if she's taken out completely, any series would be over. Also, she will be almost entirely in the background pulling strings and not in the thick of it herself. I want the world of Time Heroes to be one in which a sword-carrying barbarian, a laser mop-wielding space janitor and a Spam salesman are all equally likely as character concepts, even in one group.<br/><br/>"}, "143134": {"rpgdesigner": ["F.E.A.R.

This game puts you in command of modern troops and the powerful equipment of war in battles fought with state-of-the-art technology; it's also the first foray for the Art of Tactic system into a desert theater of operations, allowing players to explore any historical battle from the Africa campaign of Rommel to the Iraq War!<br/><br/>The Hot War: Battle for Oil starter set includes everything you need to create the first armed conflicts between the Soviet and American armies. Each side is represented by seven units: three motorized infantry platoons, two APCs, one tank, and one helicopter each. Motorized infantry units can be further customized and reinforced by machine guns, anti-tank missiles, and air defense systems. Before each battle, the commanders must choose where to position their reinforcements: Should you spread them out among your platoons, or attach everything together into one overstrengthed unit?<br/><br/>Like all Art of Tactic games, The Hot War: Battle for Oil uses specially-designed laminated cards for every unit. Each unique unit card displays all of the information a commander needs to use it in the field. The laminated coating allows players to write their orders directly on the unit card, easily cleaning them again before the next round.

They will move around the city, gather influence with different social circles, and use that influence to invite their new friends to their home to prove their greatness.<br/><br/>In Suit Up, you will guide a person of your choosing along a new adventure. You could be the Athlete who has influence with the sports fans in the city and can move around faster than everyone else; or the Executive who knows how to garner favors and has many business acquaintances. Or you could choose one of the other archetypes, each double-sided, to give you a wide and diverse variety of options. Plan your moves carefully as the city is ever-changing and you'll need to gain influence with different social circles to gain the influence you need. Things will take a dramatic turn as morning changes to evening and the new friends you made will become more valuable than ever. You'll compete over a pool of available friends, so you'll need to carefully choose which people will be your new friends and when to make them. Your new friends, in turn, could help you gather more influence and with that crucial end-game score.<br/><br/>The goal of Suit Up is to have the highest Score at the end of 16 rounds (each the equivalent of an hour of the day).

And let me tell you, we have been on a long journey since 2010...<br/><br/>This latest book, World of Steamfortress Victory, marks a major turning point for the game. For three years, we have been building up the tone of the Five Nations and giving you a taste of the pre-history that led up to the destruction of the United States of America. We have given you a rich background to work with, setting up a clockwork world on the very edge of Total War. Well, guess what?<br/><br/>Total War is about to begin!<br/><br/>After this book, we are advancing Steamfortress Victory&rsquo;s story arc into the years following the New Century Truce of 1900. The Truce was established to give each of the Five Nations a cease fire, which would allow a slight economic recovery from the Great Steam War.  The world has stabilized since the Truce was signed, but the agreement only was to last one year. No one in the Five Nations is really sure what happens on New Year&rsquo;s Day 1901, but it likely that tensions will flare up again as the feud between the Unified States and the Confederation of Free States was never truly resolved.  We are now onto chronicling the years between 1901 and 1905, which bring about new strife in the Five Nations. This brings about a period of history we are calling the Timewelder Schism, where the final fate of the colossal steam fortress named Victory will be decided.<br/><br/>So, where does this book fit into the Timewelder Schism?<br/><br/>The World of Steamfortress Victory is more of a primer for the Timewelder Schism story arc than an actual role-playing game sourcebook. It gives you background on all of the main characters of the Timewelder Schism and explains the settings and societies that they operate in. There are still statistics and mechanics for use in the role-playing game, but this book is where Steamfortress Victory makes its transition from a &lsquo;Steampunk Role-Playing Game&rsquo; to a running &lsquo;Science Fiction Serial&rsquo;.  There will still be several short-format adventures and updated rule sets published for Steamfortress Victory, but we are going put a great deal of focus on telling the story of Silverhorn, Hawkings, and the Victory for the near future. In short, when Josh, Matt, Tyler, and I started this whole thing in 2010, we had a story to tell...<br/><br/>And in the next coming years, we are going to complete the tale!<br/><br/>"}, "143171": {"rpgartist": ["(Uncredited)"], "rpg": ["Labyrinth Lord"], "statistics": [], "name": "Tales of the North: The Raiding Party (Labyrinth Lord)", "rpgdesigner": ["Clint Elliott"], "rpgproducer": ["(Uncredited)"], "average": "0", "usersrated": "0", "rpgitemversion": ["PDF version"], "rpggenre": ["Fantasy"], "rpgpublisher": ["Black Wyvern Press"], "rpgcategory": ["Scenario / Adventure / Module"], "poll": [], "description": "From the publishers blurb:<br/><br/>Raiding Party is a Labyrinth Lord compatible module published by Black Wyvern Press for 4 to 6 1st to 3rd level characters.<br/><br/>The borderland has for over a thousand years marked the northernmost progress of human civilization.

As part of the contest the game had to follow a specific theme and use at least two special ingredients. For 2013 these ingredients are all black and white icons.<br/><br/>From the introduction:<br/><br/>The world is dark; the lights went out years ago. Why did it go dark? No one really knows and no one really cares. All that matters is that when the light left they came. There wasn't time to wonder why at that point. There wasn't time for anything except the fighting to survive.<br/><br/>Where did they come from? They came from within. They were there inside the good and pure things, just waiting for the lights to go out. The came from within and when they came they corrupted. The corrupted the flesh of the host and then spread to others. Like one rotten apple in a bunch the corruption spread and it continues to spread.<br/><br/>The corruption didn't get all of us though. Some of us still wear the mantle of humanity. Under the cloak of darkness we fight back. Those who survived the corruption within gained strength from it. Strength of the mind. Some call it mental power, psychic abilities or even magic. Most just call it power. Power to fight back. Power to beat them. Power to re-light the darkness. Welcome to the world of Polarity. This is a game of black and white, a game of sides where the light fights against the darkness. It&rsquo;s a game of Us vs. Them.<br/><br/>From the Themes of Polarity:<br/><br/>Polarity is designed to be a GM driven RPG where the GM will frame scenes for the player or players. The game works just as well with just one player and a GM as it does with multiple players. The GM creates scenes and every scene should include some form of conflict. The conflict resolution system is an opposed die roll system. The system uses 2d6 and when a player rolls they have to choose one die to be UP which helps your total and one die to be DOWN which hinders your opposition. There are both simple single roll mundane conflicts and multiple roll epic conflicts. One thing that may different from other RPGs you know is that Player vs. Player conflict is a valid and possible option, though it the players choice on whether to include it or not.<br/><br/>"}, "143173": {"poll": [], "name": "Naruto Powerful Shippuden", "videogamemode": ["Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["Australian Nintendo 3DS edition", "European Nintendo 3DS edition", "Japanese Nintendo 3DS edition", "Nintendo 3DS eShop edition", "North American Nintendo 3DS edition", "Taiwanese Nintendo 3DS edition"], "average": "0", "videogametheme": ["Anime"], "videogamefranchise": ["Naruto"], "videogamedeveloper": ["Inti Creates Co., Ltd."], "videogamegenre": ["Action", "Platform"], "videogameplatform": ["Nintendo 3DS"], "usersrated": "0", "statistics": [], "videogamepublisher": ["Namco Bandai Games Inc."], "description": "&quot;JOIN NARUTO &amp; ROCK LEE IN TWO FUN ADVENTURES!<br/><br/>A whole new side-scrolling NARUTO game developed exclusively for the Nintendo 3DS&trade; focused on cutesy presentation, comical character style and easy to pick-up-and-play gameplay for fans of all ages.<br/><br/>Features:<br/><br/>     Two different stories - Play as either Naruto or Rock Lee and enjoy missions taken directly from their animated storylines<br/>     Two different gameplay modes - Story Mode &amp; Endless Battle mode included <br/>     Anime inspired presentation - Comical graphics with humorous on-screen expressions and actions<br/>     Action-packed gameplay - Earn experience points to power up your characters, call-in support characters during battles or use the touch screen to strengthen special attacks<br/>     QR code feature - Scan special QR codes designed for the game and gain access to other bonuses&quot;<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Source: The Publisher Website.<br/><br/>"}, "143174": {"poll": [], "name": "Game of Gliding", "playingtime": "0", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": ["Point to Point Movement", "Roll / Spin and Move"], "yearpublished": "1926", "usersrated": "1", "maxplayers": "4", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1673106_t.jpg", "average": "6", "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["Milton Bradley"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1673106.jpg", "boardgameversion": ["First edition"], "maxplaytime": "0", "boardgamecategory": ["Aviation / Flight"], "age": "0", "minplaytime": "0", "description": "Directions are on inside of top cover.

A frontal attack by any other craft would be absolute suicide. However, intelligence delivered to Republic headquarters by the androids R2D2 and C3PO gives a faint hope of a successful attack by a small 1- or 2-passenger X-wing fighter.<br/><br/>There is a small unshielded exhaust port on the surface of the Death Star that leads directly to the main reactor. Since it is an emergency thermal port in case the reactor overheats, it could not be shielded. If you can slip your small fighter past the Death Star's defenses and make a direct hit on the thermal exhaust port with a torpedo, there is a chance the torpedo will penetrate the main reactor and start a chain reaction, destroying the Death Star. It is a slim chance, but it is the only one the Republic has. Obi-Wan Kenobi gave his life to get the message here; so he considered it very important.<br/><br/>The X-wing fighter is a small 1- or 2-passenger rocket that is, quite frankly, obsolete. It is armed only with a laser cannon and 3 torpedoes. Use the laser cannon to fight off any imperial fighters, and save the torpedoes for the Death Star. The target acquisition radar can detect targets in excess of 100,000 km away but can only display targets within 20,000 km. Therefore, you will be warned of approaching targets on the right side of your control panel before they are displayed in the radar screen.<br/><br/>"}, "143257": {"poll": [], "name": "X-Wing II", "videogamemode": ["Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["TRS-80 edition"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1680458.png", "videogametheme": ["Movie, Book, TV show", "Science Fiction", "Space"], "usersrated": "0", "videogamedeveloper": ["(Self-Developed Video Game)"], "videogamegenre": ["Action"], "videogameplatform": ["TRS-80 Model I/III"], "average": "0", "statistics": [], "videogamepublisher": ["The Software Exchange"], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1680458_t.png", "description": "<br/><br/><br/>    <br/>        <br/>UNLICENSED GAME<br/><br/>    <br/>    <br/>        <br/>This game represents an unlicensed use of elements of the Star Wars franchise.<br/><br/>    <br/><br/><br/>Publisher Advertisement<br/><br/>You are Pilot of an X-Wing fighter...<br/><br/>Your Mission, Destroy the Death Star!<br/><br/>Where X-Wing I left Death Star looming on the screen, X-Wing II lets you guide your fighter into the trench, find the exhaust port, aim and fire -- all the while avoiding enemy fighters.

If they get it wrong, they go back.<br/>Reach the Final Challenge square and answer the question to be crowned the Cognosis Champion.<br/>Cognosis can be played simply as a fun game by all the family but it is also so much more. It gives children valuable practice in answering CAT type questions in the typical time allowed in the tests and so promotes familiarity and builds confidence. The best bit - as it is fun, children want to play it and don&rsquo;t realise that they are learning and developing with every throw of the dice and every question answered. They also love beating their parents, grandparents or any adult so don&rsquo;t think this is just a game for the children, they will want you to play too.<br/>Cognosis with a twist<br/>Alternative 1<br/>If you're under 12 and want more of a challenge, why not play the game using the 30 second timer<br/>Alternative 2<br/>Going on a long journey but still want to play/practice, why not take a box of cards (you choose which type) and a timer ( you choose which one) and play simply by pulling out a question, turning over the timer and trying to get the right answer before the timer runs out.<br/>Alternative 3<br/>Out of the house and with a friend. Again, take a box of cards and a timer. One person pulls out a question and lays it flat and the other turns over the timer. Who can get the correct answer first? The first one to correctly answer gets to keep the card. Play for 15 minutes. The winner is the one with the most cards at the end.<br/><br/>"}, "143325": {"rpgdesigner": ["Martin Dougherty", "John Lees"], "rpgitemversion": ["PDF Version"], "poll": [], "name": "Gauss Weapons", "rpgartist": ["John Lees", "Luca Oleastri"], "rpgproducer": ["Michael J.

With a look and feel of game that could have been played by men of the Norse whilst they drank and feasted in their Mead halls or even taken on the raiding trips and played at sea.  Hydra is a completely new game of intelligence and cunning, you must create an unbroken line of tiles from one side of the board to the other whilst stopping your opponent from doing the same. The first person to do so wins the game.<br/><br/>A unique feature of Hydra is that it is played East to West and North to South or it could be West to East and South to North. The game gets its name from the style of play of creating lines that get broken like they have been cut and then you must start a new one, just like when Hercules cut off one head of the Hydra another new one or two grow back. The game mechanics are very simple with only three different types of tiles and a single hand count of rules to beat your opponent.<br/><br/>Game play can take just a couple of minutes when you first learn to play, up to tens of minutes or more as you and your opponents learn the subtle flow of cunning tactics that are wrapped in Hydra.<br/><br/>"}, "143353": {"poll": [], "name": "Alien Invasion (TRS-80)", "videogamemode": ["Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["TRS-80 5-1/4\" Disk edition", "TRS-80 Cassette edition"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1680448.png", "videogametheme": ["Aliens", "Science Fiction"], "usersrated": "0", "videogamedeveloper": ["(Self-Developed Video Game)"], "videogamegenre": ["Arcade"], "videogameplatform": ["TRS-80 Model I/III"], "average": "0", "statistics": [], "videogamepublisher": ["Software Innovations"], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1680448_t.png", "description": "Publisher Advertisement<br/><br/>Now you can continue to play this popular arcade game even after you run out of quarters.

The player's craft fires bolts of energy simultaneously in three directions (left, right and forward) that destroy the creatures but consume the ship's energy, tracked by a green bar at the bottom of the screen. Energy is replenished by shooting occasional &quot;tanks&quot; on the tunnel walls.<br/><br/>Special objects in the caverns include indestructible Rubiks cube-like boxes that can be shot to gain extra points, indestructible wriggling snakes (one of the cavern's few mobile opponents), and pulsing energy barriers.<br/><br/>The craft is destroyed if it strikes any object or the cavern wall; a new one can be put back into play at any position on the screen. The game ends when the last craft is destroyed or when the player beats the final challenge.
