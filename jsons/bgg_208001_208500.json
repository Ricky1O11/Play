The first requires the player to engage in Risk-like strategic decision-making with the goal of conquering the given land mass. The player raises cyborg armies to accomplish this goal. During the second basic component of the game, the top-down battle mode, players can choose to assume manual control of one cyborg in their army during offensive or defensive battle sessions, or let the computer simulate the battle behind the scenes to much more predictable outcomes. This allows players to play only the Risk-style board game component of the game. The opposite, battles only, is also possible. Cyber Empires innovated by mixing strategy with arcade action on a global scale.<br/><br/>The game offers a total of nine different cyborgs from which the user can create an army of up to 10 units, that is no more 10 units may occupy one country. The units range from the small fast mercury capable of little damage but a high speed, to the Titan which is the ultimate cyborg capable of long range missile attacks and short range auto-cannon attacks.<br/><br/>The strategy part of the game allows the user to place capitols in any countries occupied by their troops. Countries with capitols in them create extra revenue every turn and can be built upon. The buildings includes fortifications, factories and factory upgrades. Fortifications comes in 3 varieties: light, medium and heavy, but can only protect a country if at least one cyborg is present. Factories come in 3 varieties also, they can have 1, 2 or 4 bays. The number of bays a factory is determined the number of cyborgs it can build at once. The upgrade level of a factory, on the other hand, determines how fast an individual cyborg can be built.<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;[en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyber_Empires Cyber Empires]&quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "208005": {"boardgamedesigner": ["Agusti Bartrina"], "average": "0", "poll": [], "name": "PROELIUM LOCUM", "playingtime": "120", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": ["Dice Rolling", "Grid Movement", "Worker Placement"], "yearpublished": "0", "usersrated": "0", "maxplayers": "8", "boardgameartist": ["Agusti Bartrina"], "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["(Self-Published)"], "boardgameversion": ["Beta Edition"], "maxplaytime": "120", "boardgamecategory": ["Expansion for Base-game", "Print & Play", "Science Fiction", "Territory Building", "Wargame"], "age": "12", "minplaytime": "60", "description": "Game description from the designer:<br/><br/>Proelium LOCUM is a strategy game in which players represent small forces of colonization to gain supremacy in the new frontiers of the human race.<br/><br/>In this game, players will explore a map, the board, find and collect resources to develop their settlement and power, thus winning production, military and civilian benefits.

And as the Knight of Hope, Sanya'sTalent offers a simple but powerful benefit of increased Fate Point payouts when discarding for fate, helping everyone on the team breathe just a bit easier.<br/><br/>Molly Carpenter's deck, meanwhile, mirrors her dad's in another way: like Michael's Talent, hers must be &quot;readied&quot; by a discard before it can be used. On a subsequent turn, you can flip the readied card back over to alter one of the dice you roll when you play a card. About half of Molly's cards involve a dice roll of one kind or another, so this is a powerful engine for optimizing your plays. But perhaps even more potent is her stunt, which lets you copy another player's currently-unused stunt! Need to double up on Harry's foe-finisher or Karrin's fate-harvester? Maybe summon an extra (if illusory) pack of werewolves to chew on injured foes, or get your Toe-Moss on to play the top card of your deck? Grasshopper is here to to help. Whatever your team can do, she can do &mdash; the power of a Talented Holomancer.<br/><br/>Speaking from personal experience, both decks are a ton of fun to play and add exciting new options and strategies as you take on your scenario of choice.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "1", "boardgameversion": ["First edition"], "average": "7.83824", "name": "The Dresden Files Cooperative Card Game: Helping Hands", "playingtime": "30", "boardgamemechanic": ["Action Point Allowance System", "Co-operative Play", "Dice Rolling", "Hand Management", "Variable Player Powers"], "age": "13", "boardgameexpansion": [], "usersrated": "34", "boardgamefamily": ["Crowdfunding: Kickstarter"]}, "208021": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3244647.jpg", "poll": [], "boardgamedesigner": ["Eric B.

Overall her deck is focused most strongly on taking on the challenges that decide your ultimate win-or-lose fate, and nowhere is that more apparent than with her two &quot;on the table&quot; cards.

On the battlefield, a Young Hotshot Warden like Ramirez knows that knowledge is power; his Talent lets you remove a Clue from a Case to land two Hits on an injured Foe.

In the distance, the bloody red sun was close to setting. It backlit the army that had come to take Elend's kingdom from him...&rdquo;<br/><br/>The fall of the Lord Ruler is not the end for the Houses of Luthadel. Rather, it is the beginning of a whole new world, where fancy balls and courtly intrigue give way to wars of kings, social upheaval, and political strife. Amid the chaos, strange new beings rise at the fringes of society &mdash; hordes of rampaging koloss, eerie mist-spirits, and strange shape-shifting kandra... threatening the whole of civilization!<br/><br/>Much like Mistborn: House War follows the narrative of the first Mistborn novel, The Final Empire, The Siege of Luthadel details the trials and tribulations faced by the nobility during the events of Mistborn: The Well of Ascension. The players are leaders of the Houses left standing following the Final Empire&rsquo;s collapse, and they must navigate the perils of dangerous new times. Their negotiations continue, but now there is another balance of power to consider...<br/><br/>This supplement&rsquo;s major addition is the Siege, which divides players into two &ldquo;teams:&rdquo; one consisting of the Houses besieging Luthadel, and the other consisting of those defending it. The progress of the siege is represented on the Siege Track, a sideboard that imparts benefits to those on one side of the walls and new challenges to those on the other. Conditions on the Siege Track change regularly through the game, as certain Problems are solved or erupt.<br/><br/>Your choice of sides also changes how you&rsquo;re affected by various Problems: whether you can take control of the koloss or the Skaa Assembly, for example, and how ready certain Personalities are to cooperate with you. Houses can change loyalties throughout the game as they maneuver for the greatest advantage, and this adds a whole new layer of intrigue and politicking to the Mistborn: House War!<br/><br/>Gameplay remains the same as in the core game, with players collaborating to solve Problems, gain Favor, and control (or manipulate) Unrest. When this expansion is used, the game ends when the Battle for Luthadel Problem card is solved or erupts, or when Unrest reaches 8, but there&rsquo;s an additional twist! Only the highest or lowest score from the winning &ldquo;team&rdquo; can win the game. This gives players a reason to cooperate and collaborate, in addition to just &ldquo;being on the right side of history&rdquo; as the game comes to a close.<br/><br/>The Siege of Luthadel will also include revised and updated Problem and Personality decks, along with new House sheets to represent the thrilling events and storyline of The Well of Ascension. Now players can...<br/><br/>    ...face and solve issues like Spirits in the Mist, Koloss at the Walls, and Chaos in the Assembly.<br/>    ...employ Personalities like Spies, Oracles, and even named characters from the second Mistborn novel!<br/>    ...command the power of Houses Cett or Penrod, or new forms of old Houses like Lekal or Venture.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>These new decks and Houses are designed to be easily swapped in and out with those in Mistborn: House War but for a true-to-the-novel experience you can play them right out of the box. The ways and effects of mixing and matching to make your own perfect story is one of the team&rsquo;s primary focuses as the design comes together.<br/><br/>"}, "208123": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3180349.jpg", "poll": [], "boardgamedesigner": ["Nacho Gonz\u00e1lez Arribas"], "statistics": [], "yearpublished": "2017", "maxplayers": "8", "boardgameartist": ["Rick Ruiz-Dana"], "boardgamepublisher": ["Juegorama"], "maxplaytime": "0", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3180349_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "20", "boardgamecategory": ["Card Game", "Humor"], "description": "Oh no!

It was developed and published in 1990 by Psygnosis.<br/><br/>Gameplay<br/><br/>This game contains no clear background or storyline, just white-knuckle video game racing. After choosing whether to play with one, two or three (via keyboard) players, the player(s) must select a car and buy accessories at the &quot;pit stop&quot; before proceeding to the race. Three vehicles are available; namely the racing car, sports car, and turbo buggy. Accessories include nitros, high speed, acceleration, traction, fix damage, a change of car, as well as fuel which is imperative to the racing campaign.<br/><br/>The game consists of 32 levels, but the game ends when the fuel is depleted. To prevent this, the player must finish in a high place on most races, which rewards the player with up to 600 gasoline units. In addition, power-ups float around in the levels as well as being placed on the track, but these may be picked up by any of the four cars.<br/><br/>There are four different environments. Starting on city roads, the player advance through forest and desert tracks before playing the last levels in a wasteland terrain. (Evidently, the Nitro story is that the apocalypse occurs, and the races go on. &quot;The end of the world is nigh&quot; is graffitied on the track.) Every four races there are night levels, which means that the screen is pitch-black save for the small area illuminated by headlights. Double headlights are available as a floating power-up.<br/><br/>Obstacles during races are commonplace. Examples are cones and holes in the road, which mainly slow down the player, and (blue) oil spillage which causes the car to spin. The Nitro manual makes reference to pedestrians, and says that in some races extra points are given for hitting pedestrians&mdash;however During a replay only 1 of the 32 levels has a message prior to entering the race, mentioning: money awarded for hitting pedestrians.<br/><br/>Nitro was also available as part of the Psygnosis monster pack, volume I, along with the original Shadow of the Beast and Infestation. The &quot;monsters&quot; in the game may refer to the players &mdash; namely, Clint Eastwood (P1&mdash;white), Rambo (P2&mdash;yellow), and James Bond (P3&mdash;red).<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;[en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitro_%28video_game%29 Nitro (video game)]&quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "208227": {"poll": [], "name": "Santa's Xmas Capers (Amstrad/Commodore/ZX)", "videogamemode": ["Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["Amstrad CPC edition", "Commodore 64 disk edition", "Commodore 64 tape edition", "ZX Spectrum disk edition", "ZX Spectrum tape edition"], "average": "0", "videogametheme": ["Folklore"], "usersrated": "0", "videogamedeveloper": ["Zeppelin Games"], "videogamegenre": ["Shoot 'em Up"], "videogameplatform": ["Amstrad CPC", "Commodore 64", "ZX Spectrum"], "statistics": [], "videogamepublisher": ["Zeppelin Games"], "description": "User Summary<br/>Side scrolling shoot 'em up for 8-bit computers.

The corridors and rooms are unfurnished, allowing you to decide exactly what's in them by using your own paper or 3D furniture.<br/><br/>"}, "208244": {"rpgdesigner": ["Greg Elkins"], "rpg": ["Fantasy Hero (HERO System 6)", "HERO System (6th Edition)"], "statistics": [], "name": "Tome Of Villainy", "rpgartist": ["Storn Cook"], "rpgproducer": ["Greg Elkins"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3167209.jpg", "usersrated": "0", "rpgitemversion": ["PDF version"], "average": "0", "rpggenre": ["Fantasy (High Fantasy)"], "rpgpublisher": ["Tiger Paw Press"], "rpgcategory": ["Sourcebook (rules/options to enhance play)"], "poll": [], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3167209_t.jpg", "description": "From publisher blurb:<br/><br/>Need adversaries for you Fantasy Hero campaign.

He focuses on powerful defense and fights with his armor spikes and hurled javelins.  His capabilities are greatly bolstered by his armor mastery feats (included) gained as bonuses as he progresses levels.  These are supplemented by bonding a fiendish spirit into his armor for various arcane effects.<br/><br/>Product Overview<br/><br/>We love our fantasy villains.  We find them in films, on posters, in commercials, on snack foods, and even as action figures.  Our societies flirt and play with villains at a safe distance, and we adore them.  That same sense of awe and wonder can be captured by a player roleplaying an evil character.  It does not work for all gaming groups, but for those able to handle it, the experience can be rewarding.<br/><br/>This product can serve several purposes.  Some game groups dabble in evil adventures as a one-shot or short run campaign.  Others want to experiment with evil characters and add one or two in to see how it affects the game.  Still others fully embrace evil characters and find they sometimes need replacement characters after a sudden and unexpected character death.  For whatever reason you need a ready-to-play character sheet, this product is for you.<br/><br/>Welcome to Wicked Wanderers!  In this product, you will discover twenty complete stat blocks for a single PC, level 1 through 20, adhering to the Pathfinder&reg; Roleplaying Game rules.  The core format adheres to the standard non-player character (NPC) stat block most GMs are already familiar with minus the Tactics section.  This makes it easier for the GM to assist with finding information and also prepares the player for the day he or she is running games!  The Special Abilities section includes more detailed write-ups of feats and character abilities than a standard NPC stat block to facilitate faster play.  Sources for spells, races, classes, archetypes, and prestige classes from sources other than the Pathfinder&reg; Roleplaying Game Core Rulebook&trade; (PZO1110) are listed in the Sources section and can be referenced in the Pathfinder&reg; Roleplaying Game Reference Document.<br/><br/>"}, "208246": {"rpgdesigner": ["Aaron Frost", "Mundi King"], "rpg": ["The Black Hack"], "statistics": [], "name": "The Unearthed Hack", "rpgartist": ["Aaron Frost", "Howard Pyle"], "rpgproducer": ["Aaron Frost", "Mundi King"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3167207.jpg", "usersrated": "0", "rpgitemversion": ["PDF version"], "average": "0", "rpggenre": ["Fantasy (High Fantasy)"], "rpgpublisher": ["Shattered Pike Studio"], "rpgcategory": ["Sourcebook (rules/options to enhance play)"], "poll": [], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3167207_t.jpg", "description": "From publisher blurb:<br/><br/>The Unearthed Hack is a Collection of rules variants and extras for use with the Black Hack.

The cards are unique in several aspects. You can scratch them like lottery tickets, but by doing so you are not destroying or devaluing them. Each hero card is unique; each hero has a unique name and value generated. No one else in the world will have the same card! Slowly uncover the card by scratching it and in combination with unique values, it is pleasantly thrilling. Cards can even be bought individually. (Would you rather a hero or a weapon?)<br/><br/>With an increasing number of weapon cards, you can try a sophisticated one-on-one duel in which you equip your hero with up to five weapons, then think strategically to find out which one to use when. The duel itself is very interesting; you spin a special circular weapon: turntable paper on a stick. The hero has certain levels of energy which you spend using various weapons. Heroes can change weapons during the turn and their proper use is the focus of the game. The game is risk management; you are trying to spend the hero's energy for the best possible effects. According to the composition of effects, you choose weapon, strategy and risk. You can attack the opponent's weapon, his permanent effects, or the hero directly. You have to decide when to repair a weapon, when to save energy for the hit with more powerful weapons, etc.<br/><br/>Once you get into the basic game, you can try a more comprehensive and strategic mode in which teams of heroes compete against each other. Then you can move to the top mode where entire armies of heroes collide. With more than two players, it is possible to play in teams or each player plays by themselves with modified rules. The game is perfect for tournaments.<br/><br/>If you want to play with just one player, simply scan the card into your phone and you can play online. There is a varied range of options at your disposal, from tournaments and hero trainings to territorial fights. The goal is to level your hero up and obtain spells for him. As the first game in the world, Scratch Wars presents digital ownership so that what you have physically, you also have digitally. If you later want to replace or sell any of your heroes, you can change them digitally with all that is recorded on the card, i.e., with all the spells and experiences.<br/><br/>If you would rather play the game more as a board game and add more strategic options, you will be able to expand the game with &quot;trade&quot; cards or hero's &quot;abilities&quot;.<br/><br/>"}, "208285": {"rpgdesigner": ["Brian Engard"], "rpgitemversion": ["PDF version"], "poll": [], "name": "A Facsimile of Death", "rpgartist": ["Jason Walton"], "rpgproducer": ["David Jarvis", "Thomas Shook", "Joshua Yearsley"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3167300.jpg", "usersrated": "0", "rpgsetting": ["Interface Zero"], "average": "0", "statistics": [], "rpg": ["Fate Core"], "rpgpublisher": ["Gun Metal Games"], "rpgcategory": ["Scenario / Adventure / Module"], "rpggenre": ["Science Fiction (Cyberpunk)"], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3167300_t.jpg", "description": "From publisher blurb:<br/><br/>A Facsimile of Death is meant as an introduction to the world of Interface Zero, as well as to the Fate Core version of the game.

You must manage your Minions - the Pirates, Ninjas, and Robots that do your bidding, play actions that can improve your situation or wreak havoc with your enemies, and use your Minions to launch attacks and hope that your rivals can&rsquo;t turn the cascade of results to their own advantage.<br/><br/>Each player has a set of Minion cards that they can use to attack other players, and a set of Action cards in their hand that they can use to affect either their own minions, or other player's minions. The objective of the game is to use your Minions and Actions to attack the other players and reduce their health until only a single player remains.<br/><br/>A Minion attacks by triggering another active Minion on the board. When a Minion is triggered it has an effect - it can deal damage to players, it can heal a player, or it can add flip counters to another Minion. But be careful! Attacking a Minion can cause a chain reaction that is out of your control. Each Minion has 2 different effects on either side of its card - each time it triggers it has a different effect on the game, and then it flips to reveal the opposite side. Minions also have a limited number of flips, once they're spent they are removed from play.<br/><br/>Can you out-think your opponents? Can you take advantage of the Minions on the board in order to come out on top? Eliminate your rivals and seize control of the city. Or at the very least, take all your rivals out with you and have the strongest army of Minions left who can secure the city for your successor.<br/><br/>"}, "208300": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3175288.png", "poll": [], "boardgamedesigner": ["Attila Sz\u0151gyi"], "statistics": [], "yearpublished": "2016", "maxplayers": "5", "boardgameartist": ["Gyula Pozsgay", "Attila Sz\u0151gyi"], "boardgamepublisher": ["A-games (Board Game)"], "maxplaytime": "120", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3175288_t.png", "minplaytime": "25", "boardgamecategory": ["Ancient", "Civilization", "Economic"], "description": "The Imperator module provides a new action location to the game.

There are several modes of gameplay. In Tournament mode, the player plays every fish in the game, starting as the tiny silver sprat and eventually reaching the great white shark. A shorter Challenge mode picks four random fish (from smallest to largest) instead. The player can choose to play any fish in Practice Mode. Finally, in Create-A-Fish the player creates their own species based on various parameters such as size and agility, which also affect the appearance of the fish. The color, special ability, and nocturnal or diurnal habits are also selected. Special moves, also present for some 'real' fish, include the stingray's sting and the cuttlefish's ink squirt.<br/>Each fish has different preferences for food, as described in the educational summary before the game starts. The game consists of nine screens, arranged in three levels from the sandy bottom to the reef's top, that various fish, including the player, move through looking for food. To survive, or to gain enough points to reach the next fish, your fish has to find enough edible food (which can include plants, crustaceans or coral as well as fish) to prevent its constantly decreasing energy bar from reaching 0 and death. The other main concern, besides avoiding predators, is health, which can only be repaired by finding a bluestreak cleaner wrasse while playing as a diurnal fish, or a banded coral shrimp while playing as a nocturnal fish, and moving next to it. Health takes a serious drop if the fish eats something poisonous to it, often a sea slug or sponge.<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;[en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odell_Down_Under Odell Down Under]&quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "208331": {"boardgamedesigner": ["Michael A.

This is a game, not a simulation, and while intended to provide an insight into the struggles of the era it is meant to be fast, fun, and challenging rather than an in-depth recreation of events. This pack covers selected battles of what is known as the First Civil War, from the first major engagement at Edgehill in 1642 until the kings decisive defeat at Naseby in 1645. The designer hopes that playing these scenarios will generate interest in the history of the period and will encourage gamers to read more about the era both for education and entertainment.<br/><br/>A half sheet of die-cut mounted playing pieces is also included, as is version 1.5 of the main Holy Roman Empire rule book.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "1", "boardgameversion": ["English first edition"], "name": "Holy Roman Empire Expansion 2: Battles of the English Civil War", "playingtime": "0", "boardgamemechanic": ["Area Movement"], "average": "0", "boardgameexpansion": [], "usersrated": "0", "age": "12"}, "208430": {"poll": [], "name": "Star Trek: 25th Anniversary (NES)", "videogamemode": ["Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["North American NES edition"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic992213.jpg", "videogametheme": ["Aliens", "Science Fiction", "Space"], "videogamefranchise": ["Star Trek"], "videogamedeveloper": ["Interplay (Video Game)"], "videogamegenre": ["Adventure"], "videogameplatform": ["NES"], "usersrated": "0", "average": "0", "statistics": [], "videogamepublisher": ["Ultra Games"], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic992213_t.jpg", "description": "Star Trek: 25th Anniversary is a 1992 adventure video game developed by Interplay and published by Ultra Games for the Nintendo Entertainment System and later a different version was made with the same name (not a port) on the Game Boy.<br/><br/>It begins as the USS Enterprise is approaching the planet Sigma Iotia II. The ship is confronted with a tear in space-time that sends them to an unknown area of space. While attempting to escape, the dilithium crystals, needed to travel at warp speed, have been fused and are useless. The Enterprise is trapped in a decaying orbit above an unknown planet, but Spock detects small amounts of dilithium crystals on the planet. Once the crystals are found, the Enterprise still needs to get back to Federation space, (stopping for better crystals to continue the journey), figure out what caused the tear in space-time, and find a way to fix it.<br/><br/>When an away team beams down to a level, the gameplay becomes graphic adventure game styled.

It's played on the intersections (points) of an initially empty square board. The top and bottom edges of the board are colored black; the left and right edges are colored white.<br/><br/><br/>Definitions<br/><br/>To flip a stone means to replace it with a stone of the opposite color.<br/><br/>A vulnerable black stone is a black stone that is part of at least one of the following two patterns or their relocations, rotations or mirror images:<br/><br/>a) Black stone on b2 and white stones on b3, a3, a2 and b1.<br/><br/>b) Black stone on b2 and white stones on a4, a3, a2, b1 and c1.<br/><br/>Likewise, with colors reversed, for vulnerable white stones. In all cases, the colored edges of the board count as lines of stones of their respective colors, with a length equal to that of a normal row or column of the board. The status of any points outside those patterns is irrelevant.<br/><br/><br/>Play<br/><br/>Black plays first, then turns alternate. On their turn, a player must either place a stone of their color on an empty point of the board or flip a vulnerable enemy stone.<br/><br/>If a player has no moves available on their turn, they must pass. Passing is otherwise not allowed. There will always be a move available to at least one of the players.<br/><br/>If, at the end of a player's turn, there is a chain of orthogonally adjacent stones of their color touching the two opposite board edges of their color, that player wins. Draws are not possible.<br/><br/><br/>Pie rule<br/><br/>The pie rule is used in order to make the game fair. This means that White will have the option, on his first turn only, to change sides instead of making a regular move.<br/><br/><br/>Variants<br/><br/>The following mutators can be used (together or separately) to alter the character of the game:<br/><br/>a) Both vulnerability patterns have the stone in the top left corner removed from them. This results in a game reminiscent of Crossway, but somewhat slower and free of illegal moves on empty points. All other mutators on this list work best when combined with this one.<br/><br/>b) A stone that was flipped by the enemy on their latest turn still counts as a friendly stone for flipping purposes. In this case, the winning condition must be checked for a player at the start of their turn instead of at the end of it, and it's illegal to flip a stone if the opponent could flip it back on their next turn.<br/><br/>c) On their turn, a player must either place up to two stones of their color on empty points or flip one vulnerable enemy stone.<br/><br/>d) When a player flips a stone on their turn, their opponent has the right to place an additional stone on an empty point on their next turn.<br/><br/>e) Before the start of the game, the board is filled with stones forming a checkered pattern.

You never know who you will meet on your journey, or what you might find along the way. One thing is for sure however, somebody knows more than they are saying.<br/><br/>GAMEPLAY<br/><br/>There are six main character player cards, which may be dealt randomly or chosen by players at the start of the game. Once players have an identity, the cars are re-shuffled and one card is drawn in secret, as the culprit, to be placed in a Time Capsule along with Professor Schauberger.<br/><br/>Each player is given a matching character mat to track their working hours, coin collection, resources and locations visited during the game. As each of the players are merchants in the town, they must still work for essential items, shipping their goods using several forms of transport available in the game.<br/><br/>There are 36 Mystery locations on the board which contain either a town character or mystery box. With two cards per location, there are 72 possible hiding places for the missing pieces of the Time Machine. Some of those shady characters may help or hinder your progress. Not all locations are accessible immediately, so players must gather supplies to reach those places.<br/><br/>The game is turn based, and relies upon a custom dice to determine the players action during their turn, which are to work, trade or search.  The winner is the player who contributes the most toward solving the mystery by adding the total number of locations searched, hours worked, resources collected and Time Machine components recovered, along with matching reward coins. The winner gets to assemble the Time Machine miniature and rescue the Professor, as well as earning the full reward.
