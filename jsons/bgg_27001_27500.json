The Germans hoped to take Russia out of the war, but they never dreamed how much the world would change.<br/><br/>Now, Against the Odds lets you explore the tangled facets of the Russian Civil War, with the historical situation exemplified by a game that handles two to four players&hellip;with up to three of them commanding the &ldquo;White&rdquo; Russian factions! (In multi-player games, if the Reds are defeated, the game isn&rsquo;t over yet!) For Bloody Honor: Civil War Russkaya captures the interactions of political influence, railways, foreign intervention, and the discord among the White factions that gave the Bolsheviks their best chance to win in a battle against &mdash; as it seemed to them &mdash; their internal enemies and the whole Western Alliance. (Yes, there were British, French, Canadian, Australian, Indian, Japanese, and even U.S. troops fighting in Russia as late as 1920&hellip;and even later for the Japanese).<br/><br/>For Bloody Honor includes 10 game turns, each representing 4 months of real time from the end of 1918 to the end of 1921, and driven by chit pull which will guarantee no two turns are alike. Units represent organized troops of various sizes, with each counter (except tanks) of relatively equal strength. Yes, depending on the situations, this can become a &ldquo;buckets of dice&rdquo; game&hellip;or the fate of a region (and the political points that go with it) may hinge on a single unit. Defeat can be costly, not only in lost units but in the potential for defecting as your units may decide the other side has more to offer them!<br/><br/>Can you, as the Reds, repeat history and form a Union of Soviet Socialists Republics? Or can you, as the Whites, change the course of events in the 20th century?&rdquo; The only way to find out is by playing to &ldquo;Pobeda&rdquo; (victory).<br/><br/>Bonus Game Inside!

Now, Firefight Games offers it as a wargame. The game is unique for the rules cover everything in simplicity yet, making the correct decision makes it tough to master! Political influence and recruiting plays a vital and realistic role, for these decisions will impact military units and their use! Technology (tanks, aircraft) is important but it alone cannot win the game. The beautiful area map conveys at a glance the massive expanses of the war, for each area plays a critical political role. The game is deceptively simple to learn, yet, like Chess, hard to master. A grand strategic game on the Russian Civil War from 1918 to 1922, with each turn being four months, units represent 5 - 15,000 men, while tanks, aircraft, armor cars and armor trains are abstracted amounts. One player plays the Red , the other plays the White Factions (Polish, Kolchak, Denikin etc). The map is divided into zones. The game, designed by Mark Woloshen, designed a game that is used frequently by his students to learn about the complexities of the RCW. Thus, it is focused on how the political influence and control impacted the military events. One cannot win by military means alone. The game relies on activations and recruiting new men to man the armies is of major importance subject the game's political realities!

Although responsible for unimaginable terror and tragedy, the war also gave birth to innovation and invention on an unprecedented scale.<br/><br/>With Spitting Fire, players can take control of the aircraft forged in this crucible of conflict, and battle each other in skies the world over! We should state at the outset that those who are aching for a historically-accurate, painstakingly-researched, richly-detailed simulation of World War II dogfights should probably look elsewhere. While such games can be exciting, they aren&rsquo;t what we had in mind. However, if you want a fast-playing, fun game that gives a nod to history without getting bogged down in historical minutiae, then Spitting Fire is for you.<br/><br/>Spitting Fire is designed to be used with any scale from 1:700 to 1:72 (although larger scales will require a substantial playing area).

Cardinal Wolsey has just been dismissed as lord chancellor for failing to obtain from the pope the divorce king Henry is seeking from Catherine of Aragon, his wife of twenty years.  Thomas More is named as Wolsey&rsquo;s replacement.  More presides over a newly summoned parliament, which the king hopes will somehow find the legal means to annul his marriage to Catherine, thus allowing him to proceed with his plans to marry Anne Boleyn and have by her a male heir.  But will parliament find the means, and will it be satisfied with solving the king&rsquo;s marital and dynastic problems?  There are some in parliament who wish to use the royal divorce, as well as the rising anti-clericalism in the land, to effect a split from Rome and a conversion of England from Catholicism to Protestantism.  Other members oppose the divorce, oppose making the king head of the English church, and, most of all, oppose this new, heretical creed filtering in from the continent.  More is their leader, for as long as he can survive.  Thomas Cromwell leads the king&rsquo;s party.  One problem is that the king is ambivalent about the reform effort unleashed by his so called &ldquo;great matter,&rdquo; and so the conservatives are free to prosecute reformers as heretics, while the reformers are free to prosecute conservatives as traitors.  Conservatives are liable to this charge because their frustration at home tempts them to consider petitioning the king of Spain and Holy Roman Emperor to invade England on behalf of Catholic Europe.  The game reaches its dramatic climax around the trial of Anne Boleyn, staged as a grand contest between opposing parties, which parties actually are multiple and fluid.  All roles are individualized and most are historically based.  At issue is the clash of four contending ideas:  medieval Catholicism, Lutheranism, Renaissance humanism, and Machiavellian statecraft.

The background of the game is as follows:<br/><br/>The planet Xioc has endured major wars throughout decades of time. The life sustainable resources of the planet have returned to their raw element forms. Air, food, water and plant life is scarce, and only a few humans have survived this mass devastation. Nano-technologies, more specifically molecular sized robots called nanots, were invented prior to the apocalyptic destruction. These self replicating machines along with a special material called nanite is the only way that humans have been able to synthesize small life sustainable ecosystems across the planet. Nanite is found in only trace amounts on the planet and is considered extremely valuable.<br/><br/>Factions and tribes of people living in anarchy, fight for what meager nanite remains. War is no longer waged in taking the life of another human directly, but is decided through nano-engineered war battle arenas. A small amount of battle nanite is used with nanots and pattern cards to create virtual creatures that fight for their tribe. The prize is to win the precious collection nanite that will allow the tribe to continue living.<br/><br/>You are the leaders of your respective clans and are battling to keep your family alive!

More than 700 British bombers are dispatched to the distant city of N\u0081\u0081&uuml;rnberg. As the bomber stream crawls across the German Reich, it is set upon by swarms of nightfighters. Following the bombers' contrails the figthers infiltrate the stream in great numbers and before the moon can set they pick off bomber after bomber. The mauled stream makes a desultory attack on the target city, scattering much of their payload of high explosive and incendiaries harmlessly into the surrounding countryside. Then the raid struggles bak towards England while fresh formations of nightfighters snap and bite at the retreating formation. More than ninety bombers fail to make it home safely. Soon afterward, the C-in-C of Bomber Command, Arthur &quot;Bomber&quot; Harris, calls off the Battle of Berlin.<br/><br/>BOMBER COMMAND is a game of the night war in the skies over the Reich in World War II.<br/>The game recreates the great RAF bombing raids against the heart of Germany and the defence of the German Luftwaffe's night fighter arm.<br/><br/>Based on an air combat system derived from the award-winning Downtown and The Burning Blue 'raid-scale' games, Bomber Command details the tactics of night fighting.<br/><br/>The German player must manage flak, Himmelbett zones, Wild Boar and Tame Boar tactics.

The city is comprised of 17 fiercely competitive neighborhoods (contrada) that each have their own flag and coat of arms (stemma). Ten of the 17 neighborhoods compete with one horse each in the race. The jockeys' garb are each inspired by their neighborhood's flag &amp; stemma. A piece of fabric is embroidered with the contrada's stemma and this item is attached to the horse's head (I presume via braiding into the mane but I do not know) A horse is disqualified if its head piece is not present at the finish. The jockeys ride bareback and carry a large riding crop called a nerbata. Although striking other horses and jockeys with the nerbata is not permitted, it does happen fairly often.  The winner of the Palio is literally the horse that crosses the finish line first, the rider is not required to be mounted. The people of the winning neighborhood brag about the victory constantly until the next race.<br/><br/>This game is a very rare simulation of the Sienese Palio published in a sort of game collection series, the Italian &quot;Era della Guerra&quot; journal.  The journal has several pages about the game's theme which will help you understand and appreciate the game.  Example; The first question you will ask is: &quot;Why doesn't this game have a start like other games that I have played.  Its simple, in horse racing the gate opens and the horses can only run in one direction.&quot;  I'll give away the answer, in the text of the journal you will learn that there is no starting gate, just a rope pulled tight across the track.<br/><br/>Unlike the real Palio, where only 10 &quot;contradas&quot; among 17 are allowed to participate in the horse race around Piazza del Campo, &quot;il Gioco del Palio di Siena&quot; is open to 8-17 jockeys (a player may control more than one horse). Each &quot;contrada&quot; has 2 pawns: the &quot;montata&quot; and the &quot;scossa&quot;. The first one shows the horse with its jockey, whereas the &quot;scossa&quot; shows the runaway horse without its jockey. The preliminary actions include: drawing lots for contrada and for horses &quot;tratta&quot;, holding a sealed first price auction for jockeys, establishing a secondary purse that amounts to side bets among extra hostile &quot;contradas&quot;, determining the post line up via a humorous and combative iterative process. Finally, the race starts.<br/><br/>A rather sophisticated dice rolling system determines horse movement. There are two very sharp turns on the race-track where players must see if their horse falls or throws its rider.  Throwing a rider does not put the horse out of the race, the player replaces the &quot;montata&quot; pawn with the &quot;scossa&quot; pawn.  Players may give a nearby Horse-Jockey a wack with their club-like nerbata.  However, wacking another horse-jockey with your nerbata can back fire on you. It is a good idea for the Player to hold back enough money from the earlier game phases to bribe other Jockeys during the race.  The race-track is divided into 293 boxes, each with a number.  The numbers on the spaces determine the turn order within each round, which is important in most all racing games. The numbers are distributed in a manner so that there is a logical best path.  A horse that can get on this best path will gain ground on the leaders and the leader can pull away from the pack, unless another player has bribed the jockey!!  Il gioco del Palio di Siena lasts for 3 complete laps.<br/><br/>Nell&rsquo;ora di Sunto (the bell in the Mangia tower), al tempo della Gloria!<br/><br/>"}, "27154": {"boardgamedesigner": {"3": {"name": "(Uncredited)"}}, "average": "7.5", "poll": {}, "name": "John Drake Secret Agent Game", "playingtime": "0", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": {"2072": "Dice Rolling"}, "yearpublished": "1966", "usersrated": "1", "maxplayers": "4", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic169155_t.jpg", "boardgameartist": {"3": "(Uncredited)"}, "statistics": {}, "boardgamepublisher": {"661": {"name": "John Sands Pty Ltd"}}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic169155.jpg", "boardgameversion": {"273344": "John Sands Edition"}, "maxplaytime": "0", "boardgamecategory": {"1064": {"name": "Movies / TV / Radio theme"}}, "age": "10", "minplaytime": "0", "description": "John Drake Secret Agent is based on the television show Danger Man from the 1960's starring Patrick McGoohan.

The four players (rules are also provided for two or three) represent the North Vietnamese Army (NVA), South Vietnamese Army (ARVN), Viet Cong (VC), and the US Armed Forces. There are also civilian units. The map shows North and South Vietnam plus adjacent areas on a square grid.<br/><br/>The system has more of the flavor of an abstract strategy game than a typical wargame. Units have low movement allowances (1 or 2), although regular armed forces can move greater distances by road or rail. Combat is deterministic.<br/><br/>Some of the VC player's units start mixed in with the civilian units, only he or she knowing which ones they are. To fight, they must be revealed. The US and ARVN players can attack civilians if they think they are VC, but if they are wrong the VC player gets to add more concealed VC to the game. If the VC/civilian ratio becomes too skewed the ARVN player is out of the game.<br/><br/>The goal for the NVA and VC players is to occupy a certain value of cities on South Vietnam. The US and ARVN players win by either occupying enough cities in North Vietnam and reducing the VC level, or by eliminating all overt VC units and clearing South Vietnam of NVA units.<br/><br/>There are some additional game elements, such as a deck of event cards which can be drawn in lieu of one's turn (or if an incursion of Laos occurs), reinforcements, and the possibility of Chinese Army forces entering.<br/><br/>The game is packaged in a red folder which pretends to be a CIA briefing folder. In addition to the game rules, the booklet inside the folder contains &quot;briefing&quot; materials - a time line of the Vietnam conflict, analysis of the phases of insurgency, and a (somewhat satirical) glossary. Attached to the folder are a counter sheet containing 782 counters (all the same color), a map, and a sheet of 28 event cards.<br/><br/>"}, "27186": {"boardgamedesigner": {"180": {"name": "Bertram Kaes"}}, "poll": {}, "name": "Mystery", "playingtime": "60", "minplayers": "3", "boardgamemechanic": {"2023": "Co-operative Play"}, "yearpublished": "1995", "usersrated": "14", "boardgamefamily": {"22783": "Admin: Better Description Needed!"}, "maxplayers": "12", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic283151_t.jpg", "average": "4.42143", "statistics": {}, "boardgamepublisher": {"34": {"name": "Ravensburger Spieleverlag GmbH"}}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic283151.jpg", "boardgameversion": {"175816": "German first edition"}, "maxplaytime": "60", "boardgamecategory": {"1079": {"name": "Humor"}}, "age": "14", "minplaytime": "60", "description": "Mystery is a easy to play Party-Game for up to 12 players.<br/><br/>"}, "27188": {"boardgamedesigner": {"8126": {"name": "Martin Hackett"}}, "poll": {}, "name": "Fantasy Wargaming", "playingtime": "120", "minplayers": "2", "yearpublished": "1990", "usersrated": "9", "boardgamesubdomain": {"4664": "Wargames"}, "maxplayers": "8", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic171148_t.jpg", "average": "6.66667", "statistics": {}, "boardgamepublisher": {"2665": {"name": "Patrick Stephens Limited"}}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic171148.jpg", "boardgameversion": {"108035": "Patrick Stephens First edition"}, "maxplaytime": "120", "boardgamecategory": {"1117": {"name": "Book"}}, "age": "12", "minplaytime": "120", "description": "From the dust jacket:<br/><br/>&quot;Welcome to the wonderful world of fantasy wargaming!

With this in mind we have adopted a number of basic standards throughout.

Players evade traps set by with a lively the naughty skunk StinkySmellsTM who makes the players smell different smells as they move around the board.<br/><br/>Odorville is made up of different venues where people today encounter smell. Rigorous market testing among kids and parents help identify the venues. The game starts out at a farm and then proceeds to the beach, garbage dump, laundry, candle shops, restaurants, outdoors, garages and ends at the carnival. The board is littered with over 300 elements of smell. Another innovative idea on the board is a changing path which changes according to the landscape the player is currently on. In the farm the player is on a dirt track which changes to grass in the maze, sand on the beach till it ends in cobble stones at the carnival. The best part of the game is not the board or the lovable characters but the scratch and sniff smell cards.<br/><br/>The game comes with 45 cards &ndash; 30 of them with smell and 15 cards that have no smell but require the player to identify things that smell on the board. The smell cards are broken in to 3 categories &ndash; good, bad and mystery. The game comes with smells like skunk, manure, peppermint, BBQ sauce, popcorn etc. Additional refill packs can be purchased with different smells or different themes.<br/><br/>"}, "27229": {"boardgamedesigner": {"3": {"name": "(Uncredited)"}}, "poll": {}, "name": "Tacklebox", "playingtime": "20", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": {"2040": "Hand Management"}, "yearpublished": "2004", "usersrated": "2", "maxplayers": "4", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic199240_t.jpg", "average": "3.5", "statistics": {}, "boardgamepublisher": {"6371": {"name": "Genesis Family Today"}}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic199240.jpg", "maxplaytime": "20", "boardgamecategory": {"1002": {"name": "Card Game"}}, "age": "8", "minplaytime": "20", "description": "Tacklebox is essentially a set building card game with memory and trick taking elements.

The hunters move, shoot etc. in a fairly conventional &quot;skirmish wargame&quot;  sort of way, by means of dice, while for the animal players we have introduced a card driven system, using an ordinary pack of playing cards. The intention is to bring out the difference between human intelligence - as represented, however unlikely it may sound, by the wargamer - and that of the quarry, who should combine a limited range of tactical options with an element of unpredictability. To compensate for this, the animals will usually be able to move faster than the hunters, and will have a decisive advantage if they manage to get to close range.&quot;<br/><br/>"}, "27275": {"boardgamedesigner": {"3": {"name": "(Uncredited)"}}, "poll": {}, "name": "Monopoly: Fifa World Cup 2006 Germany", "playingtime": "180", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": {"2012": "Auction/Bidding"}, "yearpublished": "2006", "usersrated": "12", "boardgamefamily": {"10643": "Country: Germany"}, "maxplayers": "6", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic172185_t.jpg", "average": "5.04167", "statistics": {}, "boardgamepublisher": {"51": {"name": "Hasbro"}}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic172185.jpg", "boardgameversion": {"84757": "Parker German edition"}, "maxplaytime": "180", "boardgamecategory": {"1021": {"name": "Economic"}}, "age": "8", "minplaytime": "180", "description": "The 2006 World Cup edition of Monopoly.

Start with the basic rules, and when you have mastered these add some or all of the more realistic advanced rules. You can use any scale, of course - half all distances for 25mm scale, and if you insist on fighting Stalingrad in a matchbox an the 10.30 from Paddington, divide distances by 10 and use 5mm figures! As is inevitable, this has escalated to whole platoons (often still with one player per section) with some support such as a medium machine gun team or man-pack flamethrower team per side. We've never bothered very much about a points system, though one is included in the appendices to these rules, except that men defending a strong position such as a farmhouse should be attacked by about twice their number. Favourite games include two units of 10 partisans each, ambushing a German staff car with escort of two motorcycle combinations and a section in a half track, and a British Recce unit consisting of a turret less Stuart tank, a Dingo scout car and a half-track with infantry section running into a German advanced defence unit in slit trenches with MMG's and Panzerfausts. The possibilities are enormous, and great variety can be achieved quite cheaply, using Britain&rsquo;s or Airfix figures and vehicles, which are less prone to damage than Tamiya and other plastic models, though we use these too!<br/><br/>Each soldier must have the correct rank, weapons and equipment, a limited supply of ammunition (so that he can run out!) and is identified by a number on his base. This number ensures that each man stays with his correct unit - if he's more than 20cm. from it, he has deserted! Wounds are NOT bullet wounds - you don&rsquo;t go anywhere with a bullet, in you, no matter WHAT John Wayne gets up to! Wounds restrict a man's fighting ability, and may eventually prevent him from fighting, though he may recover in time for a later round if you are fighting a campaign.<br/><br/>"}, "27318": {"boardgamedesigner": {"8158": {"name": "J\u00f6rgen Bengtsson"}}, "poll": {}, "name": "Dead Walk Again", "playingtime": "60", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": {"2001": "Action Point Allowance System"}, "yearpublished": "2004", "usersrated": "12", "maxplayers": "6", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic770545_t.jpg", "average": "7.16667", "statistics": {}, "boardgamepublisher": {"1001": {"name": "(Web published)"}}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic770545.jpg", "boardgameversion": {"23396": "Print and Play Edition"}, "maxplaytime": "60", "boardgamecategory": {"1024": {"name": "Horror"}}, "age": "12", "minplaytime": "60", "description": "Dead walk Again, DwA, is a set of free, print-and play tabletop rules inspired by zombie movies that we all saw when we were younger.

The concept was developed by French essayist Guy Debord (1931-1994) in 1965, but not published for many years. Debord described himself as a filmmaker, but he is known as the founder and one of the most important members of the Situationist International, a small band of avant-garde artists and revolutionaries. One key concept of their theory is the spectacle: the image replaces substance and modern capitalist society is a society of &quot;spectacular&quot; commodity consumption. Having long been treated as a producer, the worker is now courted and seduced as a consumer.<br/><br/>In 1977, Debord created a small publishing company named &quot;Les Jeux Strat&eacute;giques et Historiques&quot; with French movie producer G&eacute;rard Lebovici. The first game was Debord's &quot;Le Jeu de la Guerre&quot;, but only 4 prototypes are produced. The game was published as a book, with a map, rules and detailed descriptions in 1987. (Lebovici had been mysteriously shot in a parking lot in Paris by this time). In 1991, Guy Debord decides to insist that all his movies &amp; books be destroyed. It is also the fate of his book/game. Debord committed suicide in 1994. Nevertheless during the '90s, his work gains more and more influence. The book/game is published again in 2006 by French publisher Gallimard (price: 18 &euro;), but it's only a book (in French), co-signed by Debord's lifetime partner Alice Becker-Ho.<br/><br/>The game uses a mapboard containing 500 squares (25 x 20) divided in two by a border line. Each territory has 2 arsenal squares, 3 fortress squares, and 9 mountain squares (blocking movement,shooting and communication lines).

Community Chest and Chance morph into Trees and Telephone poles (less sophomoric than it sounds) and instead of bank error in your favor you get rewarded for running off the dogcatcher or you have to go to the vet. The theme encourages a more light hearted approach than the serious real estate game.<br/><br/>For adults the best &quot;twists&quot; are those that speed up the action.  The game does not require you to own all the territories of a given color before you can build a doghouse.  You can only build as many doghouses as you have territories of that color, but you don't have to own them all.  For instance, yellow in Dogopoly has three territories, if you own two of them you could have two doghouses on each, even if the third is unowned, or even owned by another player.  Whenever you first buy a territory you are also given the option to immediately buy a doghouse at half-price.

The battle mechanism is based on the play of special cards. No dice are used. The game is divided into 3 levels: Basic, Advanced and Team.<br/><br/>BASIC LEVEL<br/>In order to carry out a battle, the attacker calculates his Combat Value, equal to the number of his armies involved in the battle. This value can be modified playing one or more special cards divided into Magic Cards, Troop Cards or Ordnance Cards.<br/>After this, the defender calculates his Combat Value, adding the value of his own armies and cards. The higher score wins the battle and inflicts casualties on the adversary; the difference between the two values (as an example, the black army has a Combat Value of 12 and attacks the green army with a Combat Value of 9). The difference, indicates that 3 green armies are destroyed.<br/>In case of the same Combat Value, a Duel with the special symbols printed on the cards is carried out. <br/>The use of the Magic Cards render unforeseeable consequences to the game. The winner is the first to gain 10 Victory Points, obtainable by conquering the territories of the opposing players.<br/><br/>ADVANCED LEVEL<br/>In the Advanced Level, the players divide themselves into two factions (Alliance or Darkness Forces), trying to advantage or stop the travel of the Fellowship to Mount Doom, using another set of special cards with the major character of the Lord of the Rings (Nazgul, Allies, Tom Bombadil, Shelob, and so on). <br/>The movement of the Fellowship on the map is guided by the good players, while the Darkness forces will try to hinder it.  It is also possible for players to recruit the characters of the Fellowship, Nazguls, heroes or evil creatures using them in the battles (i.e. it is possible to recruit Gandalf in the good armies, fighting versus Shelob!).<br/><br/>TEAM LEVEL<br/>Allied players conduct battles as a team.

You watch with your super eyesight as the green color smoke rolls out of the window of one of Sonic Lab&rsquo;s windows. You watch as Doctor Death leaps into the air from that very window, a beaker of the hyper explosive, chemical Y, tightly held in his armed fist. You thought he was still in jail, serving a 300-year sentence for his last attempt at destroying the city. With a sigh you dive into the coming fight, sure it will be another long night ahead. Who said being a super hero was all capes and fun.<br/><br/>Comic Book Heroes is a multi player card game where you take on the role of either a super powered hero or one of their many villainous foes. Streaking through the skies in your hyper jet boots, or crash through brink walls with your super strong muscles. All the thrills, excitement and goofy fun of classic comics are here within Comic Book Heroes. Struggle with and aid other players as they battle each other to see who will be the hero supreme.<br/><br/>So let the cosmic beams fuel your dreams of glory, the mutant genes turn you into a freak with a heart of gold or allow sinister plots to fill you with a destiny for glory and dominance of all mankind. Play Comic Book Heroes and live the adventure.<br/><br/>Each set comes with two characters, a hero and a villain with 18 cards for each.

However, there is no board or score track and the tactical nuts and bolts of the game are somewhat different. In terms of components, the game consists of cards, money, worker pawns, resource markers, the provost, and castle building stones. Each player has a set of identical cards, which are shuffled and used as a face-down draw deck. Players start with an opening random draw of cards, and on his turn a player can either:<br/><br/><br/>    extend the road by building a new building <br/>    pay 1 to draw a new building card <br/>    pay 1 to discard his hand and draw a fresh hand (with the discard deck being shuffled for a new draw deck once the draw deck is exhausted) <br/>    pay 1 to place a worker on one of the existing building cards <br/>    build one of the common prestige building cards (some of which are placed at the beginning of the game as part of the setup) or <br/>    pass<br/><br/><br/>Once everyone has passed, the cards are resolved up to the provost (which can be moved in passing order by paying money).<br/><br/>Ownership of the non-common buildings is shown by the card color. When a worker is placed on a card, the owner earns either resources or money as a reward instead of victory points. Players may also choose to help build the castle. Starting with the first player to have passed, players can pay resources to obtain castle stones. The stones are worth three different values (2-4 points). Players collect the most valuable ones first. In addition, the player who collects the most building stones each round is rewarded with a gold resource marker.<br/><br/>From round to round, 1st player privileges rotate to the left, and the provost starts two cards further down the path from the castle.<br/><br/>The winner of the game is the player who has accumulated the most victory points once the game end has been triggered the turn the castle is finished.

It is primarily a two-player game, although it is possible to have more than one player per side by dividing forces or tasks. The game can also be played solitaire. The game system is inspired in the old Freedom in the Galaxy game from SPI.<br/><br/>There are two major factions in the game, each controlled by a player. The Stellar Empire owns everything at start, and strives to maintain the status quo through its military might. The Rebel Concordance player owns nothing but a few characters and spaceships at start, but by causing unrest and rebellion throughout the Empire, he hopes to get resources that will allow him or her eventually to meet the Empire on equal terms.<br/><br/>The game presents you with action at very different scopes. First, you have to administer 50+ planets on a grand-strategic scale, with social, economic and political aspects that are tightly intertwined and can be handled in very different styles.<br/><br/>Then you will be in charge of large military units; starfleets formed by individual starships ranging from tiny fighters to mammoth battlestars, and ground units (legions, brigades and divisions) to slug it out on planet surfaces. War in space is a very complex affair, since you can't establish battle lines or prevent the enemy from hyperjumping to any location on the map&hellip; He who defends everything defends nothing, goes the maxim, and quick response is the key to victory.<br/><br/>Finally, the heart and soul of DWTE are the individual characters. As in all great space adventures, the huge starships may bumble about, but they do not determine the fate of the rebellion saga as much as the astounding contributions of a handful of heroes. The characters perform missions through which they hope to sway the people to join and support their cause, undermine the plans of the enemy and further their own side's goals. During the missions characters face all sorts of dangers, including firefights with lasers blazing against enemy soldiers or monsters, cantina brawls with unruly civilians, getting lost in wormholes, or such everyday occurrences as meteorites falling on your head!<br/><br/>Key Points:<br/>A grand-scale science-fiction strategy game, which at the same time has a very detailed combat system with individual spaceships and ground military units, and a role-playing aspect with individual characters performing heroic deeds.<br/><br/>The wide variety of events in the game and the ramifications derived from players' choices and styles of play ensure that no two games will play alike.<br/><br/>It is a large game with a moderately high level of complexity, but once the rules are learned the game itself flows easily and the on-map counter density is not high.<br/><br/>Component List:<br/>Full-color Stellar map<br/>Full-color Rebel and Imperial Starfleet Displays<br/>Over 1,400 counters<br/>Over 200 Character, Item and Stellar Event cards<br/>4 sheets of Charts and Tables<br/>Campaign Scenario<br/>108 page Rules manual<br/>20-, 10- and 6-sided dice (not provided) are necessary for the PDF version of the game<br/><br/>Target Audience:<br/>DWTE appeals especially to SF-buffs with an interest in space adventures and sagas, although its fascinating game system will be interesting and challenging for any gamer. The rules are written in a clear language with extensive explanations and examples of play. They have a logical, easily-referenced order and should not present any special difficulty even for inexperienced players.<br/><br/>Game Formats:<br/>Virtual Tabletop<br/>PDF Download<br/><br/>What is a Virtual Tabletop Game? <br/>Our line of Virtual Tabletop games are powered by the Vassal Engine.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": {"182310": "First edition"}, "name": "Down with the Empire", "playingtime": "12000", "boardgamemechanic": {"2046": "Area Movement"}, "age": "12", "usersrated": "2", "boardgamesubdomain": {"4664": "Wargames"}, "average": "5"}, "27368": {"boardgamedesigner": {"7872": {"name": "Lizet Frijters"}}, "poll": {}, "name": "Living Landscapes", "playingtime": "30", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": {"2004": "Set Collection"}, "yearpublished": "2000", "usersrated": "0", "maxplayers": "6", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic176461_t.jpg", "average": "0", "statistics": {}, "boardgamepublisher": {"6139": {"name": "Living Earth Games"}}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic176461.jpg", "boardgameversion": {"318988": "First edition"}, "maxplaytime": "30", "boardgamecategory": {"1002": {"name": "Card Game"}}, "age": "4", "minplaytime": "30", "description": "1/15/2007: The Living Earth Games website appears live, and Living Landscapes is available directly from the publisher as well as from a specific retailer in the UK: <a target='_blank' href='http://www.eco-logicbooks.com/index.cfm?fa=book_details&amp' rel='nofollow'>http://www.eco-logicbooks.com/index.cfm?fa=book_details&amp</a>;book_id=995<br/><br/>Previously:<br/><br/>Living Earth Games is a now defunct game company that made ecologically aware games printed in 100% recycled materials.

Each main personality character usually has three levels, to a maximum of five. Throughout the game, the main personality can get stronger via gaining anger, replacing the previous version played.<br/><br/>Decks are divided into seven different styles: Blue, Red, Orange, Black, Saiyan, Namekian and Free-Style. Each style focuses on a different aspect of combat. For instance, the Red style focuses on gaining anger, while the Namekian style focuses on life and energy. If a player uses nothing but one color or style in his or her deck, the player would be able to declare a Tokui-waza at the start of the game, allowing various benefits, such as certain cards allowing additional powers, as stated in the card's text box.<br/><br/>Later expansions allowed you to play Mastery cards that allowed abilities that always stayed in play. Sensei cards were also eventually introduced, allowing for sideboards to cater against one's opponent.<br/><br/>There are three ways to win the game. First is to reduce your opponent's deck to zero cards. Second is to win via having the most powerful personality, via gaining anger. This win condition may sometimes be not available, depending on who one's main personality is. Third is to play or capture, all seven Dragon Balls. Again, this win condition may sometimes be unavailable, depending on how decks are constructed.<br/><br/>The bulk of the Dragon Ball Z CCG focuses on combat. Players alternate as attacker and defender. Attacks are divided into physical and energy attacks. Physical attacks reduce the opponent's power levels, eventually dealing life damage. Energy attacks deal damage directly, but usually costs two power levels to perform. Players must strike a balance between offense and defense, as cards are discarded from one's deck upon taking damage, making it possible for a certain card to be discarded from play, even before being used.<br/><br/>The game was criticized to be highly random and greatly dependent on having better cards than one's opponent, as opposed to simply being the better player. Nonetheless, the tournament scene was quite popular during the game's existence, and the secondary market remains strong even after the game has died out.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": {"181011": "First edition"}, "average": "5.69588", "name": "Dragon Ball Z CCG", "playingtime": "20", "boardgamemechanic": {"2004": "Set Collection"}, "age": "8", "usersrated": "85", "boardgamesubdomain": {"4667": "Customizable Games"}, "boardgamefamily": {"5601": "Anime & Manga"}}, "27409": {"boardgamedesigner": {"3022": {"name": "David Eckhard"}}, "poll": {}, "name": "Dragon Ball GT TCG", "playingtime": "0", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": {"2004": "Set Collection"}, "yearpublished": "2004", "usersrated": "5", "boardgamefamily": {"5601": "Anime & Manga"}, "maxplayers": "2", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic553381_t.jpg", "average": "5.95", "statistics": {}, "boardgamesubdomain": {"4667": "Customizable Games"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic553381.jpg", "maxplaytime": "0", "boardgamepublisher": {"2022": {"name": "Score Entertainment"}}, "boardgamecategory": {"1002": {"name": "Card Game"}}, "age": "0", "minplaytime": "0", "description": "Use Dragonball GT Warriors and try to defeat your opponent!

The game is regimental scale with each hex representing approximately 20-25 kilometers with turns representing four days. The combat system is roll-to-hit and the entire game system is based on the system from World War II in the West. This game is also a preview of what the system for World War II in the West: Ultimate Edition will look like when it is published in late 2007. Turn phases include the Air Phase, the Naval Phase, the Combat Phase, the Movement Phase, and the End Phase. The game includes everything from air interception to naval-air combat, from parachute drops to amphibious assaults. While the game strives to be an accurate simulation, the level of enjoyment and ease of play is also a priority.<br/><br/>The game is a medium to low complexity and should be easy to learn relatively quickly. The game can take approximately 5-8 hours to complete.<br/><br/>Operation Weser&uuml;bung contains approximately 225 mounted counters in easy-to-cut strips. All historical land and naval units are represented in the game and individually identified. Divisional leaders are also included as well as an Admiral. All ships larger than a destroyer are individually identified and included, and air units are divided into counters representing a few squadrons of each type of aircraft. The Germans can call on the Messerschmitt Bf109 E, Messerschmitt Bf110 C, Junkers 87, Heinkel 111, and Junkers 52 during the game, while the Allies have a few Gloster Gladiators, Fairey Swordfish, Vickers Wellingtons, Capronis, and Hawker Hurricanes to try to stop the invasion. All air units have images of the aircraft on the counter while naval units have the historical profiles of the ship represented.<br/><br/>Counters are all two step and as shown in these pictures, have values on the top and bottom edge of the counter. Thus, the facing of the counter is important. This is similar to the system used in Distant Foreign Fields but a departure from the Second Edition of World War II in the West.

Typically played in Casinos, several standard decks of 52 cards are shuffled together and dealt from a communal card shoe.<br/><br/>All three variants operate on the same principle; 2 cards are dealt in alternating order to a hand designated as the Player, and a hand designated as the Banker. Typically the Player hand is played by the person who bet the most on the Player's hand to win. Depending on the variant being played, certain circumstances allow either participant to draw an extra card then the cards are totaled (2s through 9s are worth their face value while 10s and face cards are worth ten points and aces are worth one point). If the total of a hand's cards exceed 10 points, the tens digit is dropped. The hand with a total closest to 9 wins and neither hand wins in the event of a tie.<br/><br/>Punto Banco is the most common variant in North America, but requires no skill and operates solely on chance. Typically played in Casinos, the house always plays the Banker hand (although players may still bet on that hand to win). It is usually played with eight (8) decks of cards shuffled together.<br/><br/>Conversely, Baccarat Banque and Baccarat Chemin de Fer (more common in Europe) allow the players to make choices during the game so a player's skill can affect the outcome. In either of these variants a player may choose to play the Banker himself and the other players play against his 'Bank' (supply of money). In Baccarat Chemin de Fer, the Bank passes when the Banker looses a hand. In Baccarat Banque, a player may remain the Banker so long as he still has funds or until all cards in the shoe have been dealt. Baccarat Banque is typically played with 3 decks of cards while Baccarat Chemin de Fer is typically played with 6. In most cases these variants are played completely in French even in English-speaking areas.<br/><br/>Since the Banker has a slight edge over the Player in his chances of winning a hand, the house taxes all winning Banker bets when played in a casino (typically 5%).<br/><br/>"}, "27444": {"boardgamedesigner": {"3": {"name": "(Uncredited)"}}, "poll": {}, "name": "Wordlink", "playingtime": "0", "minplayers": "1", "boardgamemechanic": {"2002": "Tile Placement"}, "yearpublished": "0", "usersrated": "1", "maxplayers": "4", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic177398_t.jpg", "average": "5", "statistics": {}, "boardgamepublisher": {"4652": {"name": "Creative Educational Aids Pvt.

Players are dealt one of the four characters; each one has a power and a charisma value and a special hability. Also, each player receives an episode to complete in a determined city area and three calico cards (action cards). Then, the initial city is built: each player places one city card that matches with the starting one or with one that has been already placed.<br/><br/>Each player in his turn can spend &quot;calikillos&quot; (action points) to do several things:<br/><br/>    1 Play a card: Each card has different costs and effects<br/>    2 Move to an adjacent city tile: Each tile not only has a different cost, but also, you receive &quot;anticalikillos&quot;, wich other players will use to play monsters, special effects...<br/>    3 Place a new city tile: Spending one calikillo, you can draw a city tile and place it on a legal spot<br/>    4 Heal yourself: By spending five calikillos, you heal yourself (each character has two status: hurt and unhurt, so by healing you revert to unhurt)<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>When a player resolves an action, other players may, clockwise, spend that player's anticalikillos to play action cards on him.<br/><br/>If a player at any time in his turn is at the same city tile of a monster, he will fight it. Fights are simple: you choose a characteristic, roll a die and, if the result of the die plus the characteristic is higher than the monsters value, you defeat him, if it's lower you are defeated and turn to hurt status. Players can fight each other, but the characteristic is determined by the player who wins a rock-paper-scissors game.<br/><br/>When all the players complete their turn, a new round begins:<br/><br/>    1 Players can discard cards and draw until they have five<br/>    2 Set their calikillos to five<br/>    3 Set their anticalikillos to zero<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>"}, "27472": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic180405.jpg", "is_expanded_by": {"54157": {"name": "Amerika Bomber"}}, "poll": {}, "boardgamedesigner": {"6889": {"name": "Martin Fenelon"}}, "statistics": {}, "yearpublished": "2003", "maxplayers": "2", "boardgamepublisher": {"6423": {"name": "MSD Games"}}, "maxplaytime": "60", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic180405_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "60", "boardgamecategory": {"1047": {"name": "Miniatures"}}, "description": "What if Word War II hadn't ended in 1945&hellip;?<br/>What if Allied Air Superiority was challenged by new<br/>Luftwaffe secret weapons&hellip;?<br/>What if the Manhattan Project had been delayed&hellip;?<br/><br/>The historical end of the Third Reich occurred in May 1945, before the Luftwaffe could bring its advanced rocket and jet aircraft into full combat service.

Fitting within the broader scope of the Families of Altered Wars fictional time line, Luftwaffe 1946 and Kamikaze 1946 describe WW II in the air from the view of pilots on all sides in the conflict.<br/><br/>What follows is just a brief overview of the circumstances that led to World War II continuing another year, giving the Luftwaffe and their counterparts in Japan a second chance.
