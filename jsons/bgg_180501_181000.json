In one week, her majesty the Queen will attend their new shows and will grant her support to one of the troupes. It's the chance of a lifetime for the young authors who are inflaming the populace with ever more audacious and motley plays. But how do you create a masterpiece in such a short time? Whoever has the answer to this thorny question will probably enter the rolls of history!<br/><br/>In Shakespeare, players are theater managers who must recruit actors, craftsmen, jewelers and others in order to assemble everything needed for the play's performance at week's end.<br/><br/>In more detail, the game lasts six days and on each day players recruit one new character &mdash; starting with five at the beginning of the game: four identical ones on their individual player board and one that they've drafted &mdash; and take 1-5 actions with the characters they have. Characters and their actions are:<br/><br/><br/>    Actors: Rehearse one or more acts in the three-act play; the more you rehearse, the more benefits you receive during the dress rehearsals on days four and six.<br/>    Costume mistress: Take costume elements to enhance your actors; if they lack a complete costume, they can't participate in the dress rehearsals.<br/>    Set dresser: Build the set. The more elaborate the set you build, the more rewards you receive &mdash; but the set must be symmetrical!<br/>    Handyman: Set them to work on whatever you need. These joes can assemble both costumes and sets, but they're not very good at it.<br/>    Assistant: Increase the power of your craftsmen, i.e., the three roles described above.<br/>    Jeweler: Take a gold costume element or set piece to dazzle the crowd.<br/>    Queen: Earn money by giving her an early peek, or gain an objective to win her favor on the final day.<br/><br/><br/>After players take actions, they check the individual ambience level in their theater, gaining or losing points or rehearsal time depending on the atmosphere. Dress rehearsal on the fourth and sixth days provide another chance for fully-dressed actors to perform, and those who are well-rehearsed earn points or money.<br/><br/>On all but the final days, players must allow characters who performed to rest, with only one of those characters being able to work the next day. Thus, the more you put them to work today, the less you'll be able to do tomorrow &mdash; but those who don't plan to do as much act before other players, so that might be a good thing.<br/><br/>In the end, players must pay their actors, with each unpaid actor blemishing your reputation and costing you points.

This was easy to do since Berlin itself lay deep in the Russian zone. Two million civilians dependent on allied supply watched delivery slow to a trickle. Requiring a daily minimum of 5000 tons of food, fuel, and other necessities, Berliners began dipping into their reserves. American officials estimated they would run out of fuel in 45 days but would run out of food long before that.<br/>The Allies faced a difficult decision. Abandoning the city would be a huge loss of face that could lead to the eventual loss of all of Germany to the communist bloc. On the other hand, with all land routes into Berlin cut the city could only be supplied by air, and was such a thing even possible? The Soviets didn't think so. When the blockade commenced, Americans were only capable of delivering 300 tons of supply a day. Together with the British who could manage 400 daily tons. Officials admitted the tonnage still fell woefully short.<br/><br/>Supplying a major city by air for an indefinite amount of time? Nothing approaching it had ever been attempted. Despite the overwhelming odds, the Allies determined to give it a go. Veteran pilots and aircrews were recalled as disbanded cargo units were refitted and flown back to Europe. The effort was massive... no, it was beyond massive, nevertheless, Stalin was certain the operation would fail. His determined opponents proved him wrong. This Herculean effort is remembered as the West's most selfless accomplishment.<br/><br/>Over the course of 12 months the airlift provided 2,225,510 tons of cargo for the city's survival. At one point an airlift plane was lifting off every four minutes. In the end, more supply was provided to Berlin by air than could have been provided by rail. The Soviets did not stand passively by. There were 726 recorded instances of Soviet harassment involving everything from aerial buzzing, and ground fire to rockets, chemicals, smoke and balloons. In the course of the airlift 25 aircraft were lost, costing the lives of over 100 American, British and German personnel. And during the course of the airlift, many curious and heartwarming incidents enhanced the legend of their effort, including the candy bomber, the tour of Clarence the camel and the Easter Parade.<br/><br/>The Berlin Airlift is a historical treasure begging to be gamed and here we attempt to fit the bill. But a game is only as enjoyable as the conflict it portrays. The game pits players against each other in a race against the clock. Can players overcome accidents, miscommunication and soviet interference to achieve their goals? Who can deliver the most tonnage, and will it be enough for Berliners to survive? Naturally, Berlin Airlift is only representative of the larger enterprise, but in it, players will enjoy tense competition as they face all of the elements these brave allied aircrews faced when the war ended and - the blockade began.<br/><br/>Players will command either a British or American air squadron. Each squadron consists of up to three flights depending upon the number of people playing. Each flight contains from 3 to 5 period aircraft depending upon the scenario and the faction being played. Individual planes have a rated capacity and in some cases are restricted to carrying fuel. The object for each player is to attempt to carry his squadron's tonnage goals in fuel, food, medicine and spare parts into the city and carry refugees and finished products out (cargo is represented by colored cubes). Each turn the ACTIVE player rolls two dice, consults either the Personality chart, the Help &amp; Hindrance or the Soviet Harassment Chart to determine effects, then begins drawing flight chits to determine who moves when. Strategy enters into the Active player's assignment of problems, decision making as to what to carry and who to fix, what base to return to and how to block opponents from reaching their goals. Oh, but players must be careful, for there is a cooperative aspect to the game. Players have to keep up the Berliner Morale for if it remains in the negative range after the final flight has delivered its cargo Berlin loses and so do all players.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "1", "boardgameversion": ["First edition"], "name": "Berlin Airlift", "playingtime": "120", "boardgamemechanic": ["Chit-Pull System", "Dice Rolling", "Pick-up and Deliver", "Simulation"], "average": "8", "usersrated": "1", "age": "10", "boardgamepodcastepisode": ["I've Been Diced! episode 68: Randy Lein (Legion Wargames) and Roger Miller (Revolution Games)"]}, "180538": {"rpgdesigner": ["Joe Bush"], "rpg": ["Oubliette"], "statistics": [], "name": "Oubliette", "rpgartist": ["Joe Bush"], "rpgproducer": ["Joe Bush", "Elizabeth Bush", "Josh Meves"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2584975.jpg", "usersrated": "0", "rpgitemversion": ["PDF Version"], "average": "0", "rpggenre": ["Fantasy"], "rpgpublisher": ["Voidspiral Entertainment"], "rpgcategory": ["Campaign Setting (game world)", "Core Rules (min needed to play)"], "poll": [], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2584975_t.jpg", "description": "From the product announcement:<br/><br/>In the world of Oubliette, players take on the roles of inhabitants of Castle Oubliette, a gargantuan, sprawling, ramshackle metropolis composed of the forgotten remnants of the medieval world.

All cards has a country, a flag, and the country's capital printed on it.<br/><br/>The first player starts by playing card #4 in any color. He/she also asks the player to his left if he/she can match the country with its capital. If the player doesn't know the answer, he/she adds as many points as the card shows to his/her score. Play continues with the next player playing either another #4 card, or a #3/#5 card in the color already played. If a player is unable to play a card, he has to draw cards from the deck (up to a maximum of three cards). Game ends when the deck runs out of cards. Players with cards on their hands add up their scores. The scores are adjusted with earned minus points from answering the questions about the capitals.<br/><br/>The game resembles The Game of Capitals from 1933, but this version adds some more rules, and expands gameplay to include card placement resembling that in &quot;Sevens&quot; (also known as &quot;Ruter Sju&quot;, &quot;Laying Out Sevens&quot;, &quot;Fan Tan&quot;, &quot;Crazy Sevens&quot;, or &quot;Parliament&quot;).<br/><br/>"}, "180570": {"boardgamedesigner": ["Daniel Danzer", "Doris Danzer"], "average": "6.27778", "poll": [], "name": "Undercover", "playingtime": "40", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": ["Memory", "Pattern Building", "Tile Placement"], "yearpublished": "2016", "usersrated": "27", "maxplayers": "4", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3122885_t.jpg", "boardgameartist": ["Klemens Franz", "Juan Garc\u00eda Gonz\u00e1lez", "Andrea Kattnig"], "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["Frosted Games"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3122885.jpg", "boardgameversion": ["English/German first edition"], "maxplaytime": "40", "boardgamecategory": ["Deduction", "Memory", "Spies/Secret Agents"], "age": "8", "minplaytime": "20", "description": "The late 1960's: During the &quot;Cold War&quot;, secret services pull the strings, and agents are sent around the world exchanging information at top secret meetings.<br/><br/>Despite the fact that they represent one of the big powers of espionage, the players manipulate agents of all countries &ndash; only the ones of the direct opposite are out of their control.

Fret no more. The BtC: Supplements package adds new counters and a new scenario, the East is Red, to your Breaking the Chains game to showcase the capabilities of the Russian Pacific Fleet. BtC: Supplements also adds projected Zumwalt class US destroyers to the mix as well.<br/><br/>Putin called last night. He was upset about the absence of Russian units in the BtC counter mix. He bragged about naval reforms, new missiles, and new ships. My eyes rolled, (he couldn&rsquo;t see that over the phone) but he did make some good points. For example, Russian anti-ship missiles can outrange their U.S. and Chinese counterparts. He explained how missile technology is integral to Russian ship design by citing his aircraft carrier, the Kuznetsov. That CV allocates precious deck space to missile launchers. So, it carries fewer planes, but has an impressive anti-ship missile capability! Indeed, when the Chinese bought the Varyag from Ukraine they covered some of those missile slots to add deck space to support more aircraft. Hence, the Liaoning can carry more aircraft than the Kuznetsov even though those two ships are of the same class. And, Russian submarines are different too. Those Akulas don&rsquo;t carry land attack cruise missiles (no LACM capability), but they have more torpedoes. The man reminded me that one of those boats patrolled the Gulf of Mexico for a full month before we detected it; they are quiet.<br/><br/>So we made new counters to represent Russia&rsquo;s Pacific fleet as it might appear around 2020. WE also added some U.S. units such as the Zumwalt class destroyer; the press expects us to have three of them by 2020. Of course, we're also designing a new scenario, The East is Red, to feature these units in combat around the East China Sea although they can be also be used in the already existing campaign game.<br/><br/>Components:<br/><br/>     One scenario: The East is Red<br/>     12 counters (5/8&quot;)<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>", "minplayers": "1", "boardgameversion": ["First edition"], "name": "Breaking the Chains: Supplements", "playingtime": "0", "boardgamemechanic": ["Hex-and-Counter"], "average": "7.83333", "boardgameexpansion": [], "usersrated": "6", "age": "0"}, "180578": {"rpgdesigner": ["J.

Everyone who investigated the murders from the detectives and cops to the coroner ended up missing or dead.  A demolition crew came to destroy the house and the entire crew ended up missing or dead as well. The people in town consider the spot cursed and refuse to go near it, going so far as to beg people from out of town to not approach the house as it may cost them their lives and perhaps their soul.<br/><br/>One night, a group of investigators who debunk supernatural myths roll into town and will not be dissuaded from exploring the old house at night. These can be the player characters. They find the front door unlocked when they arrive. Every window is closed with curtains drawn. The wooden floorboards and furniture are partially rotten. Beds and other furniture are stained. Stone stairs are cracked. The bathrooms are the worst. They are the scenes of the initial murder of the family and the tile, sinks, toilets and baths are stained with dried blood. All the mirrors in the house have been smashed. All the painting in the house have been slashed.<br/><br/>As they climb to the second floor, the group sees lantern light from a room in the southwest. A pristine crib has a toddler inside bundled in blankets. As they approach the toddler, the child awakes, throwing off his blankets that appear soiled by blood. The child opens his small mouth, hissing and showing two large vampire fangs surrounded by baby teeth. Suddenly the group hears the front door swing open and the loud thump of stone hitting the floor. Within moments, they are ambushed from behind by full grown vampires sired by the toddler, all of the victims of its previous murders. Will killing the toddler stop the others? Or should the group deal with the full grown vampires first?<br/><br/>"}, "180585": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2617644.jpg", "poll": [], "boardgamedesigner": ["Nicolas Normandon"], "statistics": [], "yearpublished": "2015", "maxplayers": "4", "boardgameartist": ["Looky", "Pascal Quidault"], "boardgamepublisher": ["Asmodee", "Asterion Press", "Hobby Japan", "REBEL.pl", "Space Cowboys"], "maxplaytime": "90", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2617644_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "60", "boardgamecategory": ["Adventure", "Expansion for Base-game", "Mature / Adult", "Science Fiction"], "boardgamehonor": ["2015 Golden Geek Best Board Game Expansion Nominee"], "description": "The Marcy Case is a thrilling scenario for T.I.M.E Stories that brings you to the United States in 1992.<br/>It is the first official expansion for T.I.M.E Stories.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": ["English first edition", "French first edition", "German first edition", "Italian first edition", "Japanese first edition", "Polish first edition", "Spanish first edition"], "average": "7.88052", "name": "T.I.M.E Stories: The Marcy Case", "playingtime": "90", "boardgamemechanic": ["Co-operative Play", "Dice Rolling", "Role Playing", "Storytelling", "Time Track", "Variable Player Powers", "Voting"], "age": "12", "boardgameexpansion": [], "usersrated": "2730", "boardgameaccessory": ["T.I.M.E Stories: Alternate character art pack"], "boardgamesubdomain": ["Thematic Games"], "boardgamefamily": ["T.I.M.E Stories", "Time Travel"], "boardgamepodcastepisode": ["14.

Moneyball plays faster, smoother, and more accurately than anything before it. Player cards are not jammed with complicated and unsightly dice tables, just 5 straightforward 1-10 ratings for hitters (Contact, Patience, Power, Bunting, Baserunning) and pitchers (Control, Velocity, Repertoire, Move, and Stamina). There are no dice rolls with multiples charts to reference, just a simple card draw for the pitcher and chit draw for the batter.<br/><br/>Run your front office like a real front office by evaluating talent using the same metrics actual scouts and GMs use today. Not the stats of yesteryear. With advanced Sabermetrics, we've learned there are just a handful of underlying statistics that determine a player's performance. For pitchers the only stats that really matter are his walk, strikeout and fly ball rate. It&rsquo;s been statistically proven that a pitcher&rsquo;s &ldquo;stuff&rdquo; has very little influence on the outcome once a ball is a play. It&rsquo;s much more dependent on the stadium, weather, the defense behind him, and pure luck &ndash; all factors beyond his control. For hitters, strike out and line drive rates, more than anything, determine their batting average. Moneyball has been built from the ground up using these underlying principles.<br/><br/>Pitchers are streakier than hitters and are therefore modeled differently in Moneyball. Their performance is highly volatile and can vary greatly from game to game because your starting pitcher&rsquo;s draw deck is constructed before each game. The pitcher deck, which determines strike outs, walks, and home runs consists of 108 cards. Your starter&rsquo;s deck has only 36 of those cards and it is typically reshuffled several times each start. One of your roles as the manager is to evaluate his &ldquo;stuff&rdquo; as the game progresses. This creates fantastic &ldquo;heat of the moment&rdquo; decision making that does not exist in other baseball sims. If your starter is wilder than usual or has served up several gopher balls, it&rsquo;s probably because he didn&rsquo;t have his best &ldquo;stuff&rdquo; i.e. his draw deck has more walk and home run cards than usual. So recognizing when your starter doesn&rsquo;t have his best stuff and yanking him is CRUCIAL to your success as a manager. Starters in Moneyball are not purely random dice rolls with a backwards cause-and-effect &ldquo;fatigue&rdquo; modifier added after they&rsquo;ve already gotten lit up. Manage your starting pitcher like a real manager, not a dice roller&hellip;<br/><br/>"}, "180598": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2631881.png", "boardgameimplementation": ["Jungle Treasure"], "poll": [], "boardgamedesigner": ["Roberto Fraga"], "statistics": [], "yearpublished": "2015", "maxplayers": "6", "boardgameartist": ["Reinis P\u0113tersons"], "boardgamepublisher": ["Brain Games"], "maxplaytime": "0", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2631881_t.png", "minplaytime": "30", "boardgamecategory": ["Action / Dexterity", "Card Game", "Party Game", "Real-time"], "description": "Agile acrobats, swift jugglers and brave fire-eaters - that's circus as you know it and finally you can be part of all of the fun!

In a turn the player pulls out a token from the bag, which defines how many tasks the player has to complete (either none, one or two). However, for a turn player has limited amount of time, which is kept hidden from him by another player.<br/><br/>After pulling out a token the player draws the corresponding amount of cards and tries to complete the tasks depicted of them. There are many different tasks, for example, throwing the token in the air and catching it, or creating a tower from acrobats and so on. After player has completed the task(s) he can either end the turn and thus get the points, or try to get more points by pulling out a new token and then completing the tasks. However, if the player chooses to continue, he must complete the task before he can end the turn and this is the risk - if the time runs out while he is still performing the task, the turn ends immediately and the player doesn't receive any points this turn (any cards the player completed during this turn are put in the discard pile).<br/><br/>The game ends after each player has had three turns and the winner is the one with most total points on his cards.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": ["First edition"], "average": "6.42593", "name": "Voil\u00e0!", "playingtime": "30", "boardgamemechanic": ["Pattern Recognition", "Press Your Luck"], "age": "6", "usersrated": "54", "boardgamefamily": ["Circus"]}, "180599": {"boardgamedesigner": ["Jerry Haerle"], "average": "6.70242", "poll": [], "name": "Sly Dice", "playingtime": "45", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": ["Dice Rolling", "Set Collection"], "yearpublished": "2015", "usersrated": "62", "maxplayers": "4", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2653414_t.png", "boardgameartist": ["Reinis P\u0113tersons"], "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["Brain Games"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2653414.png", "boardgameversion": ["First edition"], "maxplaytime": "45", "boardgamecategory": ["Bluffing", "Dice", "Party Game"], "age": "14", "minplaytime": "45", "description": "Sly Dice is a dice game in which you want to get as many points as possible by scoring various dice combinations. However, you can also bluff about having those combinations and hope that others will not call on you. At the end the player with the most points wins the game.<br/><br/>Each player has three dice, a shield and tokens for marking. There are several combination cards in the middle of the table as well as three common dice that will be used by all players. In each round the starting player rolls the middle dice and then all players also have up to three rolls for their own dice, which are rolled behind player's shield. However, if you want to make a roll after your first one, you have to set one die aside, visible to other players. However, if you roll three times your last roll must remain behind the shield - thus each player will have at least one die that is not visible to others.<br/><br/>When everyone is done with rolling, all players claim, which of the visible combinations they have. The trick is - you can also lie and try to claim a combination, which you don't have. When a player has claimed a combination then all other players in clockwise order have a chance to either accuse him of lying or pass.<br/><br/>1) If everyone passes then the player scores this combination and receives the points it provides. If he lied and didn't have this combination he can now reveal this fact to others - he still scores the combination as if he had it and he also receives one Successful Liar's card, which gives extra points.<br/><br/>2) If anyone accuses the player of lying, then he has to reveal his dice, which creates two possibilities:<br/><br/>If he was not lying then he scores the combination, but the player who accused him takes a False Accusation card, which gives minus points. However, if he was lying then he was accused correctly and doesn't get to score the combination, effectively losing his turn. The accuser doesn't get anything apart from the good feeling that he didn't let the lie slip through.<br/><br/>Thus each player in a round claims one combination. At the end of the round you add a new combination card from the draw pile and begin a new round.

The goal of each player is to increase the odds of what he/she has bet during the Planning Phase. The players can influence the target opponent of each Fighter, the Speed of a Fighter, his/her Defend or Attack Power and his/her Morale.<br/><br/>c) Battle Phase: During this phase, battles between Fighters take place, rolling the respective attack and defence dice.

Each player runs a fashion magazine and is in charge of selecting the cover model every month. The game is played in seasons. Each three months make one complete season, and after each season, a season special is published with your top model.<br/><br/>To select a model, a player always has a selection of possible models available. The models are represented by hand cards. Based on the selections of the different magazines together you influence the public and determine the fashion trends for the season. By anticipating the selections of your opponents and selecting the right model for your own magazine you can try to put a model on one of your covers that is completely in line with all fashion trends so it can be your star in the season special. If you manage to do this, you keep the model in your score pile and you score points. If you haven't managed to cover such a model, you don't score points this round unless you managed to put three models on the cover that don't have anything in common with the fashion trends. If you manage to have such eccentric models you can score multiple models, but this isn't easy to achieve.<br/><br/>Unfortunately it is impossible to keep your star models as they will look for other opportunities, so during the game you will see many models leave and the selection of new models is also a key aspect of the game.<br/><br/>After three years (12 seasons/rounds), the game ends.

But more player options are always a good thing, and with so much focus directed towards new cavalier orders, there are relatively few cavalier archetypes available to players, making the class less customizable, in some ways, than others. This is particularly unfortunate, because the cavalier class has several class features that tie directly into teamwork feats, which were introduced alongside the class in the Advanced Player's Guide. What might the cavalier class have looked like if it was introduced in Ultimate Combat? What about players that aren't interested in teamwork feats? These are some of the things that the four new cavalier archetypes presented in this book explore.<br/><br/>These archetypes are split between two relatively traditional interpretations of the cavalier, and two that are a bit more radical. On the unusual side, there is the arachknight, a spider-mounted cavalier inspired by the drow, who gains the ability to use poison, train vermin, and eventually even create webs of his own. Also on the more extreme end, the driven warrior is a cavalier who makes heavy use of the vehicle rules presented in Ultimate Combat, and is designed to fight from a vehicle, rather than astride a mount, with numerous improvements to his driving ability. The favored knight represents the sorts of cavaliers who spend more time at jousts and tournaments than on the battlefield, and focuses on performance combat, also from Ultimate Combat. Finally there is the lancer, an archetype that is more archetype at combating other mounted warriors, and which can break lances off in their foes with devastating effect, and eventually perform a devastating charge that allows them to perform multiple attacks.<br/><br/>"}, "180687": {"rpgartist": ["Algol", "Billiam Babble", "Bruno Balixa", "Brian Brinlee", "Claudio Casini", "V.

Ihre Waffen und R&uuml;stungen sind von edelster Kunstfertigkeit, und manche von ihnen sogar aus einem der magischen Metalle und von einem der ein&auml;ugigen Zauberschmiede gefertigt. Ihre ganze Kampfkunst brauchen die Schwertmeister, um sich der Bestien und Unget&uuml;me der Wildnis zu erwehren und um die heilige Ordnung der Acht G&ouml;tter gegen Banditen und Aufr&uuml;hrer aufrechtzuerhalten. Halt und Orientierung geben ihnen die Azarai, die Priester der Acht, die keine Widerrede und keinen anderen Glauben dulden.<br/><br/>Die in den acht Farben der G&ouml;tter strahlende Sonne bestimmt den Tagesablauf der Tharuner und hat die Erinnerung an die Ursonne Glost fast ganz ausgel&ouml;scht.

Die exotischen Reittiere Tharuns sowie die verschiedenen Schiffstypen werden ebenso vorgestellt wie die F&auml;higkeiten der Kymanai und Numinai. Exemplarische Bestien und Monster sowie die Tier- und Pflanzenwelt Tharuns sollen einen Eindruck von den Gefahren der tharunischen Wildnis und Meere geben. Schlie&szlig;lich wollen wir Ihnen nicht nur die Erschaffung tharunischer Helden erl&auml;utern, sondern auch die Vielfalt der denkbaren Abenteuer in Tharun aufzeigen.

Each player then turns up three cards to serve as his or her hand.  Each player then turns up a fourth card into the center of the table. Players look at these cards and try to match one of the objects (silhouettes don't count) with one of the objects on a card in their hands. The card can then be played on top of the middle card, as quickly as possible. Players may play on any card in the middle, not only their own. Newly played cards cover the old ones, thus constantly giving other players new objects to match.  Once all three cards in a player's hand are played, three more cards are drawn for a new hand.

Even so, with the US likely still in another post-Vietnam-funk-type of &ldquo;neo-isolationism,&rdquo; the possibility for a blitz-style conventional Iranian victory across the region &ndash; aimed at fully establishing and certifying Tehran as the unchallengeable hegemon of the Gulf region &ndash; moves to the fore. The game&rsquo;s scenario can also be taken as a model of a possible Iranian reply to a US and/or Israeli precision aerial campaign targeted against their nuclear development facilities.<br/><br/>More particularly, though, the game examines what may well prove to be the precipitating event for such a war: a declaration of full independence by Iraqi Kurdistan. Such a move would almost certainly be quickly followed by similar declarations from the Turkish and Iranian portions of Kurdistan. In turn, no new regime in Irbil could then possible do anything other than admit those two additional territories into a &ldquo;Greater Kurdistan.&rdquo; That would then just as quickly mean Iran and Turkey would effectively find themselves at least becoming cobelligerents (if not outright allies), with a shared interest in destroying the new country as quickly as possible.<br/><br/>This wargame examines the strategic possibilities and parameters inherent in the opening Iranian offensive of such a war. There are no rules for the use of nuclear weapons or any other weapons of mass destruction. The situation is on such a hair trigger in relation to that aspect of things, if one such weapon were to go off, many more detonations would be certain to follow. The idea for Tehran (and Ankara) would be to gain a victory without resorting to &ldquo;game changing&rdquo; WMD.<br/><br/>Further, the entirely playable on its own, Isis War can also be played as an expansion and update of my earlier design, Oil War: Iran Strikes.

Queen Victoria has enlisted the aid of exceptional individuals to investigate the impending plot and save her realm from its calamitous consequences.<br/><br/>Victoriana is a cooperative game for 1-4 players. Players move throughout London marshaling and managing resources, investigating leads, and thwarting the agents of an unknown mastermind before time runs out.<br/><br/>Players take the role of investigators that have influence within different realms of British society (politics, science, occult, and the underworld). The conspiracy's three elements (mastermind, plot, and locale) are represented by cards and tokens selected in secret before the game begins. Leads relating to the conspiracy are represented by facedown cards tied to notable London locations. Players move their figures throughout the city, revealing lead cards, expending their investigator's influence tokens to acquire those leads, and deciding how to apply them toward the conspiracy's hidden aspects.<br/><br/>Time is not on their side. Mismanaging the clock or their influence tokens causes leads to go cold, traumatizing investigators and bringing the conspiracy closer to its dreadful realization. Worse, as the investigators come closer to the truth, the mastermind dispatches agents to stymie their movements, disrupt their efforts (by forcing them to discard influence tokens), and assassinate them (by causing trauma).<br/><br/>Identifying the elements of the conspiracy leads the players to a climactic confrontation. If the precise combination of influence is accrued and the investigators assemble at the correct locale, the queen is saved and the British Empire preserved; however, if too many leads go cold, Big Ben strikes midnight, or the investigators are too traumatized, a dire fate awaits.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "1", "boardgameversion": ["First edition"], "average": "7.56", "name": "Victoriana", "playingtime": "90", "boardgamemechanic": ["Co-operative Play", "Dice Rolling", "Point to Point Movement", "Variable Player Powers"], "age": "0", "usersrated": "5", "boardgamefamily": ["Admin: Unreleased Games", "Crowdfunding: Kickstarter"], "boardgamepodcastepisode": ["1P 097 - Bottom of the 9th &amp; Baseball Highlights 2045", "1P 098 - Thunderbolt Apache Leader", "1P 109 - Shadowrun: Crossfire", "The First Roll - What's New on Kickstarter? - Episode 66: Thursday, September 15th"]}, "180810": {"rpgdesigner": ["Chris Babayou", "Cl\u00e9o VIII", "Tristan Collet", "Yasalde Echardour"], "statistics": [], "name": "L'Oeuf du Dragon (Issue 4 - 1999)", "rpgartist": ["Cl\u00e9o VIII", "Yasalde Echardour"], "rpgproducer": ["Anne-Marie Agasse", "Chris Babayou"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2593946.jpg", "usersrated": "0", "average": "0", "rpgissue": ["L'Oeuf du Dragon"], "rpgissuearticle": ["Anges et Demons", "Athala", "Bulletin de Commande des Anciens Num\u00e9ros", "Couverture Dorsale", "Couveture", "Edito", "Inspiration Jeux de Roles", "La Rose de Sang", "Scenario pour l'Appel de Cthulhu", "Scenario pour Rolemaster", "Sommaire", "Un Film \u00e0 la Une Coeur de Dragon", "Une journ\u00e9e avec des galets", "Une Nouvelle Traitant d'Amour", "Ventoura"], "rpg": ["Call of Cthulhu (2nd - 6th Edition)", "Rolemaster (1st, 2nd & Classic Editions)", "Vampire: The Masquerade"], "rpgpublisher": ["(Self-Published)"], "rpgissueversion": ["Standard Edition"], "poll": [], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2593946_t.jpg", "description": "Color cover<br/><br/>Le fanzine de l'imaginaire et des jeux de simulation<br/>Mega Dossier: Anges et Demons<br/>Aide de Jeu: Vampire<br/>Scenarios: L'appel de Cthulhu; Rolemaster<br/>Le monde du Black Metal<br/><br/>"}, "180813": {"poll": [], "name": "Bloodstained: Ritual of the Night", "videogamemode": ["Cooperative", "Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["Windows Downloadable edition"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1296434.png", "videogametheme": ["Fantasy", "Horror"], "videogamegenre": ["Action Adventure", "Platform"], "videogamedeveloper": ["Inti Creates Co., Ltd."], "videogamefranchise": ["(Unreleased Games - Unavailable)"], "videogameplatform": ["Windows"], "usersrated": "0", "average": "0", "statistics": [], "videogamepublisher": ["Deep Silver"], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1296434_t.png", "description": "<br/><br/><br/>    <br/>        <br/>UNRELEASED GAME &ndash; UNAVAILABLE<br/><br/>    <br/>    <br/>        <br/>This game has officially been announced by the publisher or developer, but has not yet been released and made available for purchase.

Parts include heads, legs, wheels, arms, canisters, cameras etc. But parts also have different colors and Technical points added to them. When building a robot, players try to arrange their circuit sides into as whole circuitry as possible.<br/><br/>Players can do 4 things during their turn, in any order they want:<br/><br/>     Pick a piece from the table and add it to their pile.<br/>     Turn 3 pieces around from the table<br/>     Remove one piece from their pile.<br/>     Declare your robot as ready.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Players can look at the robotic side from their own pieces at any times. After players are done with their turn, player order goes clockwise. After players have at least 3 pieces arranged the way they want, they can declare their robot completed. When a robot is completed, it is then given points. Points are calculated from amount of pieces used, unified colors of robotic parts, complexity points and deduction of points from any mistakes on circuitry side.<br/><br/>Game consists of 125 gaming pieces, and players can choose game length with 25, 50, 75, 100 or full amount of 125 pieces. Regular game lasts until either all the pieces are taken or players don't want any piece. Goal of the game is to get more points than other players when the game ends.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "1", "boardgameversion": ["First Edition"], "name": "Tiny Robots", "playingtime": "60", "boardgamemechanic": ["Memory", "Pattern Building", "Set Collection", "Tile Placement"], "average": "5.07143", "usersrated": "7", "boardgamefamily": ["Robots"], "boardgamepodcastepisode": ["Episode 15: Survive: Escape from Atlantis!, Trading Places, and Cardinal Quest"]}, "180823": {"rpgartist": ["(Uncredited)"], "statistics": [], "name": "The Guild Companion (Jul 2015)", "rpgdesigner": ["Peter Mork", "Peter Rudin-Burgess"], "rpgproducer": ["Peter Mork", "Terence Wynne"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2591267.png", "usersrated": "0", "average": "0", "rpgissue": ["The Guild Companion"], "rpg": ["Generic / Universal", "Rolemaster (3rd & 4th Editions)"], "rpgpublisher": ["Guild Companion Publications"], "rpgissueversion": ["HTML version"], "poll": [], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2591267_t.png", "description": "Will add articles upon approval<br/><br/>"}, "180824": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2604366.jpg", "poll": [], "boardgamedesigner": ["(Uncredited)"], "statistics": [], "yearpublished": "2015", "maxplayers": "10", "boardgameartist": ["Pascal Boucher"], "boardgamepublisher": ["Robin Red Games"], "maxplaytime": "60", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2604366_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "30", "boardgamecategory": ["Card Game", "Game System"], "description": "Sakura is an hawaian version played with Hanafuda cards:<br/>This version is similar to the Ko&iuml; Ko&iuml; version of Hanafuda as we capture a card in the river (also called 'Ba') with a card of the same month we have in hands, then we reveal a card from the main deck.

The bloodrager evokes sensations of powerful savage warriors who draw upon primitive, shamanic magic in order to enhance their abilities on the field of battle. Its class features lead one to imagine that the bloodrager&rsquo;s anger and fury is the source of his magical power. In a word, bloodragers are more than just sorcerers and barbarians stuck together, and so they deserve bloodlines that reflect their nature.<br/><br/>This book presents 13 bloodlines for bloodragers, with a focus on bloodlines of a primal nature, such as those relating to totem animals, hostile terrains, and base elements. Dedicated fire, ice, lightning, stone, and wind bloodlines have unique powers relating to their element, such as fire that creates choking smoke, ice that freezes victims solid, and wind that creates whirlwinds and hurricanes, which sets these bloodlines apart from each other, and from the generic elemental bloodline that is all about dealing damage of a certain type. Totem animal bloodlines allow you to gain the power of a bear, the cunning of a wolf, the speed of a hawk, and more.

And you promise that this next one would really be your last - and you survive yet again! Nothing beats that moment of suspense as you push your luck to the extreme, only to be rewarded by  glorious victory for your bravery.<br/><br/>In the light and casual game Queen of the Hill, players are queens vying for control of a celestial hill. Taking turns, they attempt to Gather, Form and Keep the strongest female warriors from different worlds and eras to join their army. However, this is a very dangerous act, and they cannot always control what they Gather. At the end of every round, players compare their total warrior scores Formed and the highest score wrests control of the hill. Control the hill twice and a player wins the game! Watch out though, the Dark One (also the only male in the game) might accidentally be Gathered and he will prey upon all the ladies. If you push your luck too hard, you might end up drawing him, and he will clear all your points and force you to end your gathering phase. How lucky are you feeling today? How far do you dare to push your luck? The more you push your luck without drawing the Dark One, the more likely the next opponent will attract him. And the more you push your luck, the more your foes are forced to push theirs if they are to beat you! The pressure is ON!<br/><br/>In this game when a female warrior is Gathered (drawn from the deck), a player has the option of Forming her into the current fighting group for that round and her Battle Points will be counted for the player's total score in that same round, or the player can choose to Keep her in his hand instead. If he Keeps her in his hand, she will not contribute any Battle Points to the player's score this round and be set aside for now. She does not go into the player's hand immediately. Only after the current round ends will all such Kept cards go to their players' hands, where they can now be played at critical moments to turn the tide against other players. An interesting thing to note is that Gathering is secretive. Other players will never know the actual total score of a player in a round (unless the Dark One wipes them out), but they will know the amount of cards drawn by the player so they can make a rough guess.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": ["First edition"], "maxplaytime": "20", "average": "7.68", "name": "Queen of the Hill", "playingtime": "20", "boardgamemechanic": ["Hand Management", "Press Your Luck"], "age": "10", "boardgameexpansion": ["212297"], "usersrated": "20", "boardgamefamily": ["Admin: Unreleased Games", "Crowdfunding: Kickstarter"]}, "180852": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2795243.jpg", "poll": [], "boardgamedesigner": ["Scott Almes"], "statistics": [], "yearpublished": "2016", "maxplayers": "4", "boardgameartist": ["Adam P.

Each round, poker cards are dealt between the locations, which are laid out in a circle.  Players place posse members on these location cards, which will both give an action and count as a bid for the location's valuable resources.  Players also get a poker card of their own which uses the two adjacent cards from a location to form a three-card hand.  This creates a clever mix of modern worker placement and poker that drives the game. In addition, players must manage their resources of Law, Money and Force to buy buildings and gunfight.

Players pick their ship and can spend their starting resource to add tokens to their ship and cards to their deck.

Battles are a large portion of the game since you will deal with them on the way to and during a warlord battle or most end events. During battles, players draw a hand and decide what cards to play based on what their ship and crew enable them to play. They roll for the actions of their enemy and resolve the damage. This process repeats until one side or the other has been destroyed. When you win a battle you take the due rewards which can be used to trade for additional ship upgrades or crew members.

As it approaches, it blights the land with Curses, sapping the Emperor&rsquo;s resources.<br/><br/>In this asymmetric cooperative card game for two players, one player is the Dragon, who collects resources from a hex map of the empire, while the second player is the Emperor, who uses the gathered resources to power spells and create Magic Items to combat the advancing enemy. The object of the game is to acquire the three Magic Items before Evil reaches the Palace or Curses cover too much of the land.<br/><br/>"}, "180878": {"average": "8.00143", "videogamebg": ["Splendor"], "name": "Splendor", "videogamemode": ["Hotseat", "Network Multiplayer", "Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["Android edition", "iOS edition", "Windows Downloadable edition"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2597263.png", "videogametheme": ["Board Game"], "usersrated": "35", "videogamedeveloper": ["Days of Wonder", "Space Cowboys"], "videogamegenre": ["Strategy"], "videogameplatform": ["Android", "iPad", "iPhone", "Windows"], "videogamehonor": ["2015 Golden Geek Best Board Game App Nominee"], "poll": [], "statistics": [], "videogamepublisher": ["Days of Wonder", "Space Cowboys"], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2597263_t.png", "description": "The Official Digital Adaptation of the best-selling board game<br/><br/>The goal of the game is to build the most impressive jewel trade and become the best-known merchant in the world.

An alien power that lies congealed in the cloth and steel manufactured there. A hostile power that twists bone, robs children of their youth, and turns neighbors against neighbors.   It is more terrifying than any unholy spirit, slithering lifeform or doomsday device because this horror is real, grounded in social relations. It is alienation and it is generated anew each shift as men, women, and children toil at the machines.<br/><br/>Satanic Mills is a game about the production of alienation and the destruction of human lives. It is based on Karl Marx\u02bcs theory of alienation as expressed in his Economic and Philosophical manuscripts of 1844. Marx believed that workers in capitalist societies are stripped of or separated from what should be meaningful in their lives &ndash; and that what is taken from us fuels our exploitation. He identified four linked types of alienation. People are alienated from their labor, since work is not done to fulfill the worker\u02bcs human needs and creativity but to meet the external agenda of the owner. Workers are also alienated from the products of their labor, which profit capitalists and emerge as commodities that the worker must buy.  Workers are alienated from other people as the exchange of money and commodities warps social relationships. People are finally alienated from their species being, since the loss of meaningful productive activity removes one of the main capacities that makes us human. Alienation, forged in Satanic Mills, will inexorably damage the lives of the game\u02bcs characters, with you serving as both victim and executioner.<br/><br/>"}, "180892": {"rpgartist": ["(Uncredited)"], "statistics": [], "name": "Alien Realms (Issue 2 - Apr 1991)", "rpgdesigner": ["Dave Cheever", "James Maliszewski"], "rpgproducer": ["Bryan Borich"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2592485.jpg", "usersrated": "1", "average": "7", "rpgissue": ["Alien Realms"], "rpgissuearticle": ["Answerin Minor Human Race", "Cafadi Minor Human Race", "Irhadre Minor Human Race", "Luriani Minor Human Race"], "rpg": ["MegaTraveller", "Traveller (Classic)"], "rpgpublisher": ["(Self-Published)"], "rpgissueversion": ["First Printing"], "poll": [], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2592485_t.jpg", "description": "Alien Realms<br/>Issue 2<br/>April 1991<br/>by Bryan Borich<br/><br/>User summary:<br/><br/>No description given except for submission details and contact information.<br/><br/>No interior illustrations.

If you receive the Awesome card, it's worth 1 point (i.e. 1 blue cube), while a &quot;let's barter&quot; card is just a friendly message that expresses condolences and to try again.<br/><br/>Troquons! is a very simple and addictive game that will make you appear sometimes as a great and gifted philosopher gifted of profound reflexion and decisive for the future of mankind, and sometimes as a schemer trying desperately to justify a proverb that is worth not a cent.<br/><br/>"}, "180915": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2658667.jpg", "poll": [], "boardgamedesigner": ["Toni Serradesanferm"], "statistics": [], "yearpublished": "2015", "maxplayers": "4", "boardgameartist": ["Evelt Yanait"], "boardgamepublisher": ["Viravi Edicions"], "maxplaytime": "20", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2658667_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "15", "boardgamecategory": ["Children's Game", "Fantasy"], "description": "In Storytelling, players choose one of the four tales to play.

The lure of open land, religious freedom, and riches to be made has drawn you away from your home in England to the New World. Unbeknownst to those who usher you across the Atlantic, your desires are more than what the authorities may find appropriate.<br/><br/>You like to delve into the world of the unknown. Your curiosity has led you to an underground world that hides beneath everyone&rsquo;s nose. Rumors abound of the Indian shamans that can teach you new things, as long as they deem you worthy, or of the treasures waiting to be discovered. Relics of times long gone lie in wait, housing unimaginable power. Tomes of esoteric lore are said to dwell within shelters only accessible through hazardous terrain. But you don&rsquo;t let silly rumors keep you from the occult power you seek. You are determined to uncover the secrets of centuries past and harness their dark powers.<br/><br/>However, many beings stand in your way, and the journey is not without peril. There are Templars to avoid, witch hunters to fight, natives to exterminate, and worse.

The basic timeline is moved from the Revolutionary War to 1745, before the French and Indian War. The lands are filled with turmoil due to the ongoing struggles with New France and the Native Americans. Somewhere amongst all this chaos, the occult operates, hidden away from prying eyes.

The skies are grey, the winds cold, and the ruined cities eerily empty, and already being covered in greenery. Humanity was struck down by the virus, the Infected, and the wars the followed - but it survived. Now, the vast cities of yesteryear are home to numerous rough-and-tough towns, settlements and even small cities. Some are walled, some not. Some paranoid, or mad, others open and inviting of trade.<br/><br/>The ruined roads are now subject to traffic, as traders, couriers, soldiers and countless wanderers move from settlement to settlement, to bring valuable supplies, information and defense - or perhaps make their fortune in the dark underbelly of the settlements.<br/><br/>Life is perilous in these days of fallen glory. Out there are bandits, burners, crazies and cannibals - and many much closer than you think. And then there are the Infected themselves, never quite wiped out, surviving on the fringes of civilization, where they hunt in their dreaded packs, with all the cunning of vicious wolves.<br/><br/>This is a game of survival, suspense and horror.

On the one hand, they are awe-inspiring creatures of myth and fantasy, terrible draconic creatures which no human has ever lain eyes upon, stars of novels, television, and movies. On the other hand, they were real, mundane animals, not so different from the animals we know in modern day times. As a result, dinosaurs occupy a nebulous space between fantasy and reality, and require a delicate balance to handle well.<br/><br/>The dinosaurs included in the Pathfinder Roleplaying Game Bestiary do an excellent job of presenting one interpretation of dinosaurs: that of being large, but nonetheless mundane animals, differing from a bear or elephant only in Hit Dice and size category. Like other animals, they receive little in the way of special abilities or mechanics to make them come alive at the game table. With Weekly Wonders: Cinematic Dinosaurs Volume I, we present a different interpretation of dinosaurs, one which draws on the more fantastical elements of these creatures, as seen in movies, television, games, and more. Though they are decidedly non-magical in nature, these dinosaurs can hardly be said to be mundane, with numerous new and exciting special abilities designed to evoke the sorts of action attributed to dinosaurs in other media.<br/><br/>In this book, you will find:<br/><br/>    The primordial triceratops (CR 11), whose massive bulk cripples those it tramples, and which can impale opponents on its three massive horns.<br/>    The primordial tyrannosaurus rex (CR 12), whose very presence inspires fear, and whose roar can reduce even the stoutest hearts to quivering jelly, whose teeth can snap bones like twigs, and who can burst through nearly any obstacle without even slowing down.<br/>    Supplemental rules applicable to all dinosaurs and other creatures of immense size, which focus on bashing objects, including rules to make attempts to break objects more exciting and cinematic, break DCs for a variety of objects a dinosaur might want to destroy (including trees, rocks, and entire buildings of various sizes and materials), and rules for bashing large objects to shake free creatures hiding atop them.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>"}, "180992": {"rpgdesigner": ["Scott Corum", "Victor Gipson"], "rpgitemversion": ["PDF version"], "poll": [], "name": "Victory's Vault Volume 1, Issue 12", "rpgartist": ["Scott Corum", "Victor Gipson"], "rpgproducer": ["Scott Corum"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2594984.jpg", "usersrated": "0", "average": "0", "statistics": [], "rpggenre": ["Science Fiction"], "rpgpublisher": ["Dakkar Unlimited"], "rpg": ["Victory System"], "rpgcategory": ["Sourcebook (rules/options to enhance play)"], "rpgseries": ["Victory's Vault"], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2594984_t.jpg", "description": "From publisher blurb:<br/><br/><br/>&quot;Every Item Touched by Victory!&quot;<br/><br/>You can call her Phane Wonderra... she represents an ancient race that pursues the practice of Victory, and if you've got the cash, to the vault of their star fortress.

It explores approximately three months of humanitarian operations, including both the initial emergency and a later period of early recovery. Because Carana is a fragile, conflict- affected country, relief and reconstruction efforts may also involve issues of social unrest and political instability, especially during the early recovery stage once the initial shock of the crisis has worn off.<br/><br/>The primary objective of all players is to address the urgent humanitarian needs of the local population (thereby scoring &quot;relief points&quot;). However, players also need to maintain public and political support for their organizations (&quot;operations points&quot;), whether to govern (Carana), sustain the relief mission (HADR-TF), or secure financial support (UN and NGOs).<br/><br/>&quot;At-Risk&quot; cards indicate the current emergency needs for food, water/sanitation, medical, or shelter supplies in each district of the capital. Players must bring the necessary supplies into the country, and allocate aid teams to deliver them in time. Aid teams might also be engaged in rescue operations, aid coordination, needs assessment, infrastructure repair, public relations or other key tasks. Event cards inject many of the numerous challenges associated with relief operations into game play, but also indicate the self-help efforts of the local population as they struggle to survive and recover.<br/><br/>Game play is cooperative, but it is possible for some, all, or no player to win.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "4", "boardgameversion": ["First edition"], "name": "AFTERSHOCK: A Humanitarian Crisis Game", "playingtime": "120", "boardgamemechanic": ["Partnerships", "Pattern Building", "Simulation", "Worker Placement"], "average": "8.35", "boardgameexpansion": ["206223"], "usersrated": "15", "age": "14", "boardgamepodcastepisode": ["GrogCast Season 2, Episode 12"]}, "180995": {"rpgartist": ["(Uncredited)"], "rpgitemversion": ["PDF Version"], "rpgseries": ["RPG Geek One Sheet GUMSHOE Contest 2015"], "name": "Monster Squad Control", "rpgdesigner": ["Tom McGrenery"], "rpgproducer": ["Tom McGrenery"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2595560.jpg", "usersrated": "0", "average": "0", "statistics": [], "rpg": ["GUMSHOE"], "rpgpublisher": ["(Self-Published)"], "poll": [], "rpgcategory": ["Scenario / Adventure / Module"], "rpggenre": ["Horror (Supernatural)", "Modern"], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2595560_t.jpg", "description": "Introduction<br/><br/>This is a GUMSHOE scenario designed to be played via video-chat software such as Skype or Google Hangouts.

Each player sets a &quot;fleet&quot; of 20 ships on the first three rows (24 spaces)of the 8x8 gridded board nearest its home base. Four spaces are left vacant. As in Stratego the placement/order of battle is hidden from the opponent. One side is chosen to go first and movement is one space in any unoccupied direction with alternating turns. Attacks are made when one piece moves to a vacant space directly in front of an opponent's piece and the rank/class of the ship is announced. The ship with the highest assigned value is the winner and the lesser piece is removed from the board. If both have the same value, they're both removed. One important difference is that each side is given 4 Submarines with the lowest assigned value of 1, but they take ALL pieces except the 4 Subchasers (value 2). Attacks need not be made when a piece moves into attack position. If no value is announced with the move, the piece acts a block to the opposing piece.
