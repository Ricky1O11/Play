The air above was suddenly filled with parachutes as thousands of elite German paratroops&mdash;Fallschirmj&auml;ger&mdash;descended from the sky.<br/><br/>The invasion of Crete was one of the most dramatic battles of the Second World War. Over a nine-day period in May 1941, a mixed force of Commonwealth and Greek troops desperately tried to fight off the German assault. Despite appalling casualties, the paratroopers and glider-borne troops managed to secure a foothold and the critical Maleme Airfield to open the door for the German Gebirgsj&auml;ger (mountain troops) to land under fire. Together the Fallschirmj&auml;ger and Gebirgsj&auml;ger pushed the Commonwealth troops to their breaking point and forced a deadly battle of delay and pursuit.<br/><br/>This was a true soldier&rsquo;s battle, with both sides in desperate situations often lacking higher-level control and support. The Germans had to quickly secure a usable airfield or face the annihilation of their entire airborne force. The Commonwealth needed to crush the German landings or&mdash;failing that&mdash;evacuate the bulk of its forces to continue the fight in North Africa and Syria.<br/><br/>The German invasion of Crete in May 1941 stands as a landmark in the history of airborne warfare. Up until that point, airborne operations were tactical operations to seize key objectives in advance of the ground forces. The German invasion of Crete (codenamed Operation Merkur) was the first strategic airborne operation.<br/><br/>Although casualties would mean Crete was the last hurrah for the German airborne in a major air assault, it set the stage for even larger future Allied airborne operations in the Mediterranean, Western Europe, and Asia.<br/><br/>Operation Mercury maintains the same level of detail and scale as other Grand Tactical Series (GTS) games. Players command divisions and maneuver company-sized units to fight one of the most desperate battles of the war. Using the GTS 2.0 rules, Operation Mercury offers two players or teams a wide range of scenarios ranging from a single small map with a few units on each side to the full battle including up to two German divisions and several Commonwealth and Greek brigades. Operation Mercury covers all the major airdrops and fighting across the island from Heraklion in the east, through Rethymnon, and from Maleme to Suda Bay then south to the Askifou Plain, scene of the last major fight during the withdrawal.<br/><br/>As the Commander of Allied forces on Crete, can you deny the Germans a precious airfield and negate their much-needed air-landing reinforcements for a quick victory? Of all operations of war, a withdrawal under heavy enemy pressure is probably the most difficult and perilous. Can you get the bulk of your forces to the southern evacuation ports? As the German, how quickly can you force the collapse of the Commonwealth morale and trigger their withdrawal?<br/><br/>Features include:<br/><br/><br/>     Shifting Allied morale state based on relative casualties and key events, which can trigger evacuation and end-game victory conditions.<br/>     Random events, including tank breakdowns, misdirected airstrikes, and partisan attacks.<br/>     An option for Commonwealth naval support at the risk of losing precious ships to German air attacks.<br/><br/><br/>Thirteen scenarios include:<br/><br/>     Separate one-map battles for the airdrops at Rethymnon, Heraklion, and the Maleme/Canea sector.<br/>     A one-map battle for the New Zealand counter-attack to retake Maleme airfield.<br/>     One-, two-, and three-map battles for the difficult German advance and Commonwealth delay and withdrawal.<br/>     The full campaign on all five maps or just the main event from Maleme to Askifou Plain on three maps.<br/>     Hypothetical German precision drops as well as a German free drop scenario.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": ["First edition"], "age": "0", "name": "Operation Mercury: The Invasion of Crete", "playingtime": "0", "boardgamemechanic": ["Chit-Pull System", "Dice Rolling", "Hex-and-Counter"], "average": "8", "usersrated": "1", "boardgamefamily": ["Admin: Unreleased Games", "Grand Tactical Series", "Islands: Crete"]}, "194079": {"boardgamedesigner": ["G\u00fcnter Burkhardt"], "average": "5.77842", "poll": [], "name": "ROX", "playingtime": "0", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": ["Pattern Building"], "yearpublished": "2014", "usersrated": "19", "maxplayers": "4", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2897931_t.jpg", "boardgameartist": ["Franz Vohwinkel"], "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["HABA - Habermaa\u00df GmbH"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2897931.jpg", "boardgameversion": ["Multilingual first edition (Dutch packaging)", "Multilingual first edition (English packaging)", "Multilingual first edition (French packaging)", "Multilingual first edition (German packaging)"], "maxplaytime": "0", "boardgamecategory": ["Card Game", "Real-time"], "age": "7", "minplaytime": "0", "description": "Druids are preparing for a great contest.

EPIC Napoleonics allows for fighting larger battles with more units. EPIC Napoleonics is actually two game systems in one &ndash; the Epic Battles system, and the La Grande Battles system. Although the scope of our Napoleonic game has changed size wise, the historical feel and the basic rules of play, for the most part, remain the same. To experience the maximum enjoyment with these two new Napoleonic game formats, both EPIC Napoleonics and La Grande Battles scenarios are best played using the Command card and Tactician card decks that were part of the Generals, Marshals and Tacticians expansion.<br/><br/>Included in this expansion are six standard sized scenarios that focus on key phases of the battle of Austerlitz, 2 December 1805. This expansion also features 12 EPIC sized engagements and two La Grande Battle scenarios. Also included are two double-sided mounted maps. The EPIC sided battlefield is larger, and at 11 hexes deep by 20 hexes wide, it is almost double the size of the standard size battlefield of 9 hexes deep by 13 hexes wide. When laid side-by-side to form the La Grande battlefield, the battle area is a whopping 11 hexes deep by 26 hexes wide.<br/><br/>In an EPIC Napoleonics game, one player on each side assumes the role of the Commander In Chief (CIC). Each CIC has a hand of Command cards and on a turn must play one card from his hand to order units in one section of the EPIC battlefield. Also on the turn, the CIC must select one card from the Courier rack to play. The card selected from the Courier rack will also order units in one section of the EPIC battlefield. There are only three sections in the EPIC battlefield (left, center and right) and with two Command cards played each turn, the action quickly becomes very fast and furious.<br/><br/>The Courier rack is a new game mechanic, and starts each battle with five Command cards that are visible to both players. Each turn one card is taken from the rack, so the choice of cards a player has each turn is reduced, until there are only two cards remaining on the rack. The rack is then filled back to five cards before the next player&rsquo;s turn, and the card selection process from the Courier rack will start again.<br/><br/>EPIC Napoleonic will allow two or more players to enjoy a truly Epic size battle, but it is important to note in order to play most EPIC Napoleonic scenarios, players will need a copy of the Commands &amp; Colors Napoleonic game and its expansions (Spanish, Russian, Austrian, Prussian and Generals, Marshals and Tacticians) This EPIC Napoleonic expansion will only provide enough units and terrain to fill any gaps.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": ["First edition"], "name": "Commands & Colors: Napoleonics Expansion #6 \u2013 EPIC Napoleonics", "playingtime": "240", "boardgamemechanic": ["Campaign / Battle Card Driven", "Dice Rolling", "Hand Management", "Hex-and-Counter", "Modular Board"], "average": "8.44167", "boardgameexpansion": [], "usersrated": "60", "boardgamefamily": ["Commands & Colors: Napoleonics"]}, "194085": {"rpgartist": ["Max Johnson"], "rpgitemversion": ["Age of Sail Deck PDF version", "Base Set PDF version", "Demon Hunters PDF version", "Horror PDF version", "Sci-Fi PDF version", "Steampunk Deck PDF version"], "statistics": [], "name": "The GameMaster's Apprentice", "rpgdesigner": ["Nathan Rockwood"], "rpgproducer": ["Max Johnson", "Nathan Rockwood"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2919754.png", "usersrated": "2", "average": "9.5", "rpggenre": ["Action / Adventure (Nautical)", "Action / Adventure (Swashbuckling / Pirates)", "Fantasy (Modern Urban Fantasy)", "Generic / Universal", "Horror", "Science Fiction", "Steampunk"], "rpgpublisher": ["Larcenous Designs, LLC"], "rpg": ["Generic / Universal"], "rpgcategory": ["Accessory (dice, maps, screens, cards)"], "poll": [], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2919754_t.png", "description": "From publisher blurb:<br/><br/>Sooner or later, you're going to need more story!<br/><br/>The GameMaster's Apprentice is a genre-and-system-neutral deck of cards that can be used as either a supplement for traditional tabletop RPGs or as a complete game engine for GM-free solo or group RPGs.<br/><br/>On each card is a set of fourteen individual randomizers; with 60 double-sided cards, you can generate literally millions of possible adventures, all without having to hunt through a book or PDF for a single table!<br/><br/>With these cards, you can:<br/><br/>     Instantly generate NPCs with randomized names, motivations, and backgrounds.<br/>     Create random events or story seeds.<br/>     Provide sensory details or random loot for characters searching or stealing.<br/>     Run games without a human GameMaster!<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>And more--they even work brilliantly as creative writing prompt generators.<br/><br/>Comes in Base Set, Demon Hunter's, Sci-Fi, and Horror variations, with more on the way.<br/><br/>"}, "194086": {"rpgartist": ["Eren Arik"], "rpgitemversion": ["PDF Version"], "rpgseries": ["Non-Player Cards: A System Agnostic Character Generator"], "name": "Non-Player Compendium", "rpgdesigner": ["Andrew Montgomery-Hurrell", "Andreas Walters"], "rpgproducer": ["Eren Arik", "Andrew Montgomery-Hurrell", "Andreas Walters"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3098622.jpg", "usersrated": "0", "average": "0", "statistics": [], "rpg": ["Generic / Universal"], "rpgpublisher": ["Metal Weave Games"], "poll": [], "rpgcategory": ["Sourcebook (rules/options to enhance play)"], "rpggenre": ["Generic / Universal"], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3098622_t.jpg", "description": "From publisher blurb:<br/>Creating NPCs Like Never Before!<br/><br/>From the successful &quot;Non-Player Cards Kickstarter&quot; comes the first installment of the NPC series, the Non-Player Compendium.

This new edition is quite different from Dean Essig's original game from back in 2000. It features a revised order of battle, modified rules, and a new map. The most obvious change is in scale: hexes are now 3.5 miles across and there are two turns per week (the original had 2.5-mile hexes and four turns per week). This makes for a smaller, faster game that conforms to the scale chosen for Beyond the Rhine and the upcoming games set in Western Europe.

The game is played on a 4x4 grid of treasure card stacks. At the top of the stacks are easy to recover simple treasures. Each one of these will give you a small number of points and an additional bonus or way to manipulate the desert. As you take these, more valuable treasures are revealed deeper in the sands. Should you manage to reach the bottom and gather the workers needed to dig one, you'll find ancient artifacts of tremendous power. Recover one and you'll not only get a huge boost to your score, you'll be able to turn its power on your rivals!<br/><br/>Each turn, you will choose a worker to recruit and play for both progress towards recovering treasures and for a variety of effects depending on who you chose. Alternatively, many workers can be instead discarded for stronger powers, but no progress towards digging. Once you have gathered enough workers in play you can send them out to dig up a treasure from the desert grid. Each treasure is worth a number of victory points along with a wide variety of special effects from recovering them. You might find functioning tools that make your work easier or uncover old tomes that point to where more valuable treasures lie. Be warned though, the Dead Reaches are not a safe place to be. Each round an event card will be drawn that could radically change the situation and have everyone scrambling to recover. Worse still are detrimental weather cards that could bring your progress to a screeching halt. It will be up to you to carefully use your workers to mitigate the risks that lie in the Ancient Sands.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": ["First edition"], "average": "7.25", "name": "Ancient Sands", "playingtime": "30", "boardgamemechanic": ["Hand Management"], "age": "10", "usersrated": "6", "boardgamefamily": ["Crowdfunding: Kickstarter"], "boardgamepodcastepisode": ["Episode #1 \u2013 Ancient Sands"]}, "194143": {"rpgartist": ["Aaron Acevedo", "James Denton", "Irina Kovalova", "John Morrow", "Claudio Pozas", "Alida Saxon", "Thomas Shook", "Steve Wood (II)"], "rpgitemversion": ["PDF version"], "poll": [], "name": "Rippers Resurrected: Archetypes", "rpgdesigner": ["Norm Hensley"], "rpgproducer": ["Aaron Acevedo", "Jodi Black", "Alida Saxon", "Thomas Shook"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2899596.jpg", "usersrated": "1", "rpgsetting": ["Rippers"], "average": "7", "statistics": [], "rpggenre": ["Fantasy (Science Fantasy)", "History (Victorian Era)", "Horror (Supernatural)"], "rpgpublisher": ["Pinnacle Entertainment Group"], "rpg": ["Savage Worlds"], "rpgcategory": ["Sourcebook (rules/options to enhance play)"], "rpgseries": ["Rippers Resurrected"], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2899596_t.jpg", "description": "From publisher blurb:<br/><br/>An octet of heroes to battle the horrors of the Cabal!<br/><br/>This PDF contains eight ready-to-play archetypes ready to take back the night in Rippers Resurrected!

From an organized gang of street thugs, to a brawler who dabbles in the art of pickling, to an all-woman mercenary outfit, to uncoordinated table dancers and the inept piano player, there&rsquo;s a little something for everyone at Tuffy&rsquo;s Good Time Palace.<br/><br/>The only question is: are your PCs brave enough to try the pickled pig&rsquo;s feet or will they just turn tail and leave a dingy dive like Tuffy&rsquo;s for greener pastures (or cleaner glasses)?<br/><br/>Tangible Taverns: Tuffy's Good Time Palace details a dilapidated tavern filled with the city's least desirables. The drinks are terrible, the food is limited to the pickled variety, and not a soul would bat an eye at stealing your coin purse.<br/><br/>This book includes detailed information on a local gang and its leader, the town healer (who could be more than he seems), and of course the memorable tavern employees (including Tuffy herself); rumour and event tables, and a tavern map, meaning you are all set to have some role-playing fun when your PCs stop off for a drink.<br/><br/>"}, "194162": {"rpgartist": ["Peter Bradley"], "rpgitemversion": ["PDF version"], "poll": [], "name": "The Outpost", "rpgdesigner": ["Stephen Chenault"], "rpgproducer": ["Peter Bradley", "Libbie Okey"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2899652.jpg", "usersrated": "0", "rpgsetting": ["Aihrde"], "average": "0", "statistics": [], "rpg": ["Castles & Crusades"], "rpgpublisher": ["Troll Lord Games"], "rpgcategory": ["Scenario / Adventure / Module"], "rpggenre": ["Fantasy (High Fantasy)"], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2899652_t.jpg", "description": "From publisher blurb:<br/><br/>The Outpost is an adventure module for 3-6 player characters of 1st to 3rd level.<br/><br/>The Outpost stands upon a high ridge, overlooking the long, broken country of the southern Gelderland.

They own the Seaview Hotel and its attached bar and outdoor patios in the west. Their boss owns the mansion with a rooftop pool in the northeast. They also own the former motel in the southeast that has been closed for some time. A series of tunnels have been dug underneath the motel. They use the tunnels to smuggle arms (or change this to drugs if it fits the game better) to the motel and sell the guns to the highest bidder. The motel rooms are used to temporarily store the guns until a buyer can be found.  The signs outside the former motel are meant to scare people away from the &ldquo;condemned&rdquo; building.<br/><br/>The activities of the Tunnel Snakes have not gone unnoticed by the police who have arranged for undercover police officers to be the next buyer of the illegal arms. Unfortunately for the police, a rival gang arrives during the middle of their negotiations to buy the guns. The beautiful tourist trap of Seaside is riddled with bullets as the two gangs fight each other with the undercover cops caught in the middle.<br/><br/>The player characters could be any of the three factions here. As undercover cops they need to convince the Tunnel Snakes they haven&rsquo;t double-crossed them, perhaps by helping to fight off the rival gang.

To solve this problem, the Mad Science Foundation was created. Now these &quot;misunderstood geniuses&quot; can finally get the access they need to the four vital building blocks of mad science: Lasers, Dark Matter, Cryptomium, and Sharks.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, for each mad scientist who seeks &quot;funding&quot; from the Mad Science Foundation, there remains the unfortunate fact of life that mad scientists do not play well with others. In the quest for infamy, directors will be bribed, resources will be reallocated, spies will be dispatched, inventions will be sabotaged, and big, ominous buttons will be pressed with catastrophic results. Welcome to the Mad Science Foundation, where everyone is ready to stab you in the back with overly-elaborate backstabbing machines.<br/><br/>At heart, Mad Science Foundation is a drafting game. You draft resources to craft wacky inventions and dispatch minions to help with your diabolical plans. Each round, one player controls the Crooked Director for that round. They then separate the available commodities into piles to be drafted. It's up to the scientist controlling the Director to determine the value of whatever resources are available and separate them into piles. Not all piles are created equal! Players then take turns selecting which pile of goodies to grab, with the Director's controller choosing last. Sizing up your competition is key! You know what they need; don't let them have it. Or give them two choices of equal terrible-ness! But each player also has a secret side objective that you may not figure out until it's too late...<br/><br/>By crafting new inventions, you might be able to put together an engine of cards that eventually fuel themselves. Perpetual motion in our lifetime! Or perhaps you might stockpile valuable resources for later exploitation. It's all done with the altruistic goals of megalomania and personal glory in mind. What could go wrong?*<br/><br/><br/>    The Mad Science Foundation is not responsible for stock market crashes, illegal dumping, or tears in the fabric of space-time.<br/><br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": ["English first edition"], "name": "Mad Science Foundation", "playingtime": "45", "boardgamemechanic": ["Card Drafting", "Set Collection"], "average": "6.81774", "usersrated": "62", "age": "15", "boardgamepodcastepisode": ["Quick Reviews and GrandCon - Episode 046"]}, "194230": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3062097.png", "poll": [], "boardgamedesigner": ["Matt Hyra"], "statistics": [], "yearpublished": "2016", "maxplayers": "5", "boardgamepublisher": ["Cryptozoic Entertainment"], "maxplaytime": "90", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3062097_t.png", "minplaytime": "60", "boardgamecategory": ["Card Game", "Movies / TV / Radio theme"], "description": "The last human city is under attack by giant, fearsome Titans and it's up to your team to stop them!<br/><br/>Based on the action from the world-renown Attack on Titan anime and manga series, in the cooperative Attack on Titan: Deck-Building Game you and your fellow players will battle relentless Titans for humanity's very survival.

Each team has its own custom suit theme and artwork. Play any deck versus any other deck, or even three- and four-player variants.

Additionally, if you can craft a Straight, Flush, Full House, or Four-of-a-Kind, you will earn an aptly named Power Card. These unique cards give you new strategies to pursue.<br/><br/>Chances are with your initial hand of five cards, you aren't going to have much of a poker hand. But by playing only one card at a time, and drawing a new card from your deck after each play, you can slowly build up to something great. How great is up to how risky you want to get. Craft a hand of at least a pair, and your assault is underway! Now your opponent must block your cards using the cards in their hand. The defending player likewise plays only one card at a time and draws a card from their deck after each play. To block an assaulting card, match the value (2 to Ace) or play a card of the same suit (Heart, Diamond, Club, Spade), but with a higher value. Each assaulting card that gets through knocks your opponent's hit points down by one.

Complex bloodlines take this one step further by swapping out bonus spells and/or bonus feats for special talents, alternate casting systems, or really weird minigame abilities.

The Big Book of Bloodlines adds a sorely-needed layer of organization by assigning a number of first-party published bloodlines as &quot;parents&quot;, then assigning all other bloodlines as &quot;children&quot; of one or more of these parent bloodlines. For example, Lich has both Arcane and Undead as children. Why does this even need to exist? It helps multiclassing, plus the system is integral to what comes next.<br/><br/>The Bloodlord<br/><br/>Magic is everywhere, and with experimenting wizards and promiscuous dragons the world over, the average mortal has four or five different sources of magic in his blood. Thankfully, for various reasons, these sources of magic are dormant in many, but when they simultaneously awaken in a single creature, something very different from sorcerer or bloodrager ends up being created.<br/><br/>Absolute master of bloodline manipulation, the new bloodlord base class manages the powers of four different bloodlines, two bloodrager and two sorcerer, to the exclusion of almost everything else.

During store hours, some patrons swear that they see their cups moved and the contents of their cups emptied. It never seems to happen to the tea drinkers who visit the bistro.<br/><br/>The poltergeist is the ghost of a former owner of the bistro who hates the modernization of his antique bistro and is trying to drive customers away. Unfortunately for the poltergeist, not only does the place serve the best coffee in town, the latest owner has smartly hired four of the prettiest women in town to be the baristas and as a result it&rsquo;s more popular than ever. The poltergeist is also still obsessed with coffee and rages at night when there is no one there to make it (as he has no idea how to work the espresso machine) and steals sips during the day.<br/><br/>The poltergeist goes away if the modern machines are all removed and they go back to the old ways of making coffee and preparing food.<br/><br/>The player characters can get involved by this being a place they stop by to relax. While there one of them notices their cup moving and the coffee being sucked upward and then vanishing in midair. They might want to investigate the strange happenings further. Perhaps they try to sneak into the place in the middle of the night after observing the flickering lights and noises inside the place when it is closed. They could also be ghost hunters here to capture the poltergeist for the owners or ghost chasers trying to get the poltergeist on camera for proof.<br/><br/>"}, "194343": {"rpgartist": ["Rowena Aitken", "Robert Altbauer", "Colin Chan", "Tyler Clark", "David Day", "Talon Dunning", "Felipe Gaona", "Brian LeBlanc", "Eric Lofgren", "Chris McFann", "Cara Mitten", "MKultra Studio", "Terry Pavlet", "Nate Pride", "Artem Shukaev", "Richard Thomas (I)", "Timothy Truman", "Blake Wilkie", "Charles Wright (I)"], "rpgitemversion": ["PDF version"], "poll": [], "name": "The Northlands Saga Complete (Swords & Wizardry)", "rpgdesigner": ["Matthew Finch", "Jeff Harkness", "Ken Spencer", "Greg A.

Where raging storms, some sent by malevolent spirits of the Ginnungagap, howl from the Far North and bury steadings and towns alike under several feet of snow while unnamed things of tooth and shadow hunt those who dare to emerge and brave the cold. Where the blood of fighting men and women sings in harmony with the death cries of the spear-din and the clash of wood and steel when the shield walls meet. Where enchantments older than the race of Men linger in barrow fields and primeval forests waiting to ensnare the unwary or the foolish. This is the realm of the Norns where they measure and cut the threads of a man&rsquo;s wyrd. This is the Northlands.<br/><br/>A Howl From The North<br/><br/>The Northlands Saga Complete picks up where the Northlands Saga series of adventures released in 2010 and 2011 left off. Created by fan favorite author Kenneth Spencer, these four adventures first introduced Frog God Games fans to the barbaric Northlands, the stalwart folk who dwell there, and the perils, from savage beast and demon alike, that they face. Now The Northlands Saga Complete updates and expands those original adventures with new material and completes the saga with six more new adventures that follow directly after, so GMs can resume campaigns that were left off after the last adventure was released in 2011.<br/><br/>In addition, an eleventh new adventure was added as a prequel to the original four to complete an entire adventure path to take PCs from level 1 to 20. You can play any or all of the eleven adventures as standalone sessions, or you can use them as a single continuous campaign to explore the Northlands and beyond.<br/><br/>As a part of the Lost Lands campaign world, The Northlands Saga Complete incudes a full-color poster map as well as a complete campaign guide detailing the cultures, history, races, nations, languages, geography, and new monsters, magic, and equipment unique to those lands. There is also a chapter dedicated to new optional rules that you can use in your game to capture the authentic spirit of the Northlands with rules for things like a character&rsquo;s wyrd, death speeches, becoming a jarl, the examples of early representative politics in the Things and Althing, and trial by combat in the holmgang. In addition there are a multitude of new archetypes, feats, player-character races, and character traits. When you delve into The Northlands Saga Complete, you step into the Northlands.<br/><br/>Take your wyrd by the throat. With The Northlands Saga Complete you can break a shield wall on trampled fields or pull a sweep upon gray icy seas to find new shores to explore or raid.

One can never know what is hiding inside.&quot;<br/><br/>- Adolf Hitler, June '41<br/><br/>In December of 1940, Hitler made the decision to invade Russia and set the date for the middle of 1941. He had good reason to be confident that Russia would collapse under an uncompromising assault. Since the outbreak of hostilities, the German Wehrmacht had accomplished a stunning and unparalleled series of victories: Poland had fallen in one month, Denmark in one day; France, till then regarded as the strongest power in Europe, had capitulated in under six weeks, Holland in under six days; Belgium, Norway, Yugoslavia and Greece took less than three weeks each. The German military might was at its peak and the word Blitzkrieg had entered the language.<br/><br/>Russia, on the other hand had taken over three months to bring Finland to heel, despite overwhelming strength of numbers. The Russian army had not yet recovered from Stalin's purges of 1937-1938 where 400 generals were &ldquo;removed&rdquo; including three field marshals and 13 Army commanders. It was well that Hitler could say, &ldquo;Before three months have passed, we shall witness a collapse in Russia, the like of which has never been seen in history. We have only to kick in the front door and the whole rotten Russian edifice will come tumbling down.&rdquo;<br/><br/>On the 22nd of June, 1941, Operation Barbarossa - the invasion of Russia, began. Three million Axis troops in three Army Groups attacked on a front that stretched from the Baltic to the Black Sea: Army Group North under Field Marshal von Leeb was tasked with taking Leningrad; Army Group South under Field Marshal von Rundstedt was to capture Kiev and seize the Caucasus; Field Marshal von Bock's Army Group Centre, the one that concerns us, had Moscow as an objective, with Timoshenko undertaking the task of defending the capital.<br/><br/>Initially, the operation succeeded beyond Hitler's wildest dreams. Within a day, the Russian Air Force was destroyed on the ground, then vast inroads were made on all fronts accompanied by large scale surrenders of encircled Russian troops. Army Group Centre with its four armies consisting of a total of 48 Divisions, of which nine were armoured, and backed by the Second Air Fleet, had reached the outskirts of Smolensk by the 15th July. This was two-thirds of the way to Moscow and it seemed that nothing could stop von Bock from blowing up the Kremlin within another three or four weeks... or could something stand in his way?<br/><br/>Four things could now cause problems to von Bock: firstly, his supply line is stretched and had almost reached breaking point; secondly, Russian resistance is stiffening; thirdly, his infantry divisions are having difficulty keeping up with the Panzers and finally, a new Russian ally is about to enter the field: General Winter.<br/><br/>Additional concerns may come in November, with three-quarters of a million experienced Siberian veterans freed by garrisoning Soviet Far East, thanks to Stalin's spies in Tokyo revealing Japanese intentions to attack America, and not Russia.<br/><br/>As the German Commander, you must push on to Moscow before it is too late. As the Russian Commander you must re-evoke the Patriotic War and stop the invaders at any cost.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": ["English first edition", "English Kickstarter deluxe edition"], "average": "8.33261", "name": "Moscow '41", "playingtime": "120", "boardgamemechanic": ["Area-Impulse", "Dice Rolling"], "age": "14", "usersrated": "46", "boardgamesubdomain": ["Wargames"], "boardgamefamily": ["Block wargames"]}, "194393": {"poll": [], "name": "Alien vs Predator: Alien Royal Guard Expansion", "playingtime": "0", "minplayers": "1", "boardgamemechanic": ["Dice Rolling", "Modular Board", "Variable Player Powers"], "yearpublished": "2016", "boardgameexpansion": [], "usersrated": "8", "maxplayers": "4", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3211094_t.jpg", "average": "7.3125", "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["Ninja Division", "Prodos Games, Ltd"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3211094.jpg", "boardgameversion": ["First edition"], "maxplaytime": "0", "boardgamecategory": ["Miniatures", "Science Fiction", "Wargame"], "age": "8", "minplaytime": "0", "description": "From publisher:<br/>Strongest and most feriocius of them all are known to guard Queen herself.<br/><br/>"}, "194394": {"poll": [], "name": "Alien vs Predator: Power Loader Expansion", "playingtime": "0", "minplayers": "1", "boardgamemechanic": ["Dice Rolling", "Modular Board", "Variable Player Powers"], "yearpublished": "2016", "boardgameexpansion": [], "usersrated": "11", "maxplayers": "4", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3132305_t.jpg", "average": "7.27273", "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["Ninja Division", "Prodos Games, Ltd"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3132305.jpg", "boardgameversion": ["First edition"], "maxplaytime": "0", "boardgamecategory": ["Miniatures", "Science Fiction", "Wargame"], "age": "8", "minplaytime": "0", "description": "From the publisher:<br/>Caterpillar P-5000 Powered Work Loader, commonly referred to as a Power Loader.<br/>This useful piece of equipment  can be found at most human colonies.<br/>Primarily used to lift and relocate heavy objects the power loader is a true asset to Human engineering and infrastructure.<br/>You can watch that puppy scream as you throw it out an air lock.<br/><br/>"}, "194395": {"poll": [], "name": "Alien vs Predator: Predator Hellhound Expansion", "playingtime": "0", "minplayers": "1", "boardgamemechanic": ["Dice Rolling", "Modular Board", "Variable Player Powers"], "yearpublished": "2016", "boardgameexpansion": [], "usersrated": "9", "maxplayers": "4", "average": "7.66667", "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["Ninja Division", "Prodos Games, Ltd"], "boardgameversion": ["First edition"], "maxplaytime": "0", "boardgamecategory": ["Miniatures", "Science Fiction", "Wargame"], "age": "8", "minplaytime": "0", "description": "From the publisher:<br/>The Hellhounds are a canine-like species domesticated by the Predators for use in hunting.<br/> Much like The Bloodhounds of Earth they are used to chase down prey allowing a swifter, more effective hunt to be executed.

Casper) Ryx written by a Polish writer Mariusz Wollny.<br/><br/>Players assume the role of gangs ringleaders, who fight for the title of the King of Beggars, the ruler of the Cracow underworld. The winner will be the one who at the end of the game will have the highest value of points of influence (respect). The players score points by performing tasks described on the objective cards which they are drawing at the start of each turn. Many objectives will require a capture of taverns, which will become bases of operation for players and will allow to take control over districts of the Renaissance Cracow.<br/><br/>Each turn is divided into 4 phases. In the income phase players collect tribute, fill their ranks with new thugs and draw special cards according to the value provided by each inn they control. They also draw new objectives (3 cards are always kept in hand) and heal each ringleader wounded in the previous turn.<br/>In the action phase players operate on a beautiful board depicting the Cracow from the days of yore. They usually perform 8 basic actions (movement, brawl, stealing, begging, murder, trade, bribery, recruitment) and use special action cards. All 8 basic actions are printed on four 2-sided cards, one on each side. Each player has his own set of cards. At any given moment a player can perform only the action that is visible to him, that's why players must always plan on how and when to use their basic actions in order to fulfill their secret objectives in the best way possible. Each action has its cost in the form of ducats (game currency) and/or action points. A player usually can't spend more than 10 action points per turn. After the action phase comes the objective phase, in which the players reveal each task  they did perform in the action phase. For those, they receive points of influence.<br/><br/>Investigation phase is the final step of each turn. At this point, the players reveal investigation cards they previously collected. Those cards are obtained as the result of various crimes conducted in the action phase and simulate the inquiry of the title detective Kacper Ryx. Many of those cards will cost us the loss of money (ducats), thugs or will block any income that our taverns may generate in the coming turn. In addition, the investigation cards are a key factor in ending the game. Each of them will add more points to the investigation pool, common to all players. Investigation Track coincides with the Time Track. With the passage of time and the disclosure of new crimes conducted by players, both the time and investigation marker, which start at the opposing end of the time-investigation track, will move closer to each other. When they meet the game ends and the player who scores most points of influence will be the new King of Beggars.<br/><br/>A 2 players variant follows a somewhat different principles. The map of Cracow is limited to 6 districts, players do not use time/investigation track as well as the influence track. Instead they compete for fulfillment of the 4 explicit objectives drawn from separate &quot;duel deck&quot; set next to the board. Upon completion of a task, the player takes the duel card to his pool and draws new one to replace the one he took. The player who first accumulates 4 objective cards wins the game. Thanks to these modifications the game is as playable as the 3-5 players variant, but much shorter.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": ["Polish first edition"], "age": "14", "name": "Kacper Ryx i Kr\u00f3l \u017bebrak\u00f3w", "playingtime": "120", "boardgamemechanic": ["Action / Movement Programming", "Area Control / Area Influence", "Card Drafting", "Dice Rolling", "Hand Management"], "average": "7.17073", "usersrated": "41", "boardgamefamily": ["Crowdfunding: Wspieram"]}, "194401": {"rpgdesigner": ["Rafael Chandler"], "rpgitemversion": ["Hardcover version", "PDF version"], "statistics": [], "name": "World of the Lost", "rpgartist": ["Christianne Benedict", "Yannick Bouchard", "Jez Gordon", "Malcolm McClinton"], "rpgproducer": ["James Edward Raggi, IV"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2906399.jpg", "usersrated": "3", "average": "8", "rpgissuearticle": ["Games"], "rpggenre": ["Fantasy (High Fantasy)", "Science Fiction"], "rpgpublisher": ["Lamentations of the Flame Princess"], "rpg": ["Lamentations of the Flame Princess"], "rpgcategory": ["Scenario / Adventure / Module", "Sourcebook (rules/options to enhance play)"], "poll": [], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2906399_t.jpg", "description": "From publisher blurb:<br/><br/>Quicksand, Jungle Rot, and Psychotic Robots <br/><br/>Each year, the citizens of Khirima offer a massive tribute of silver to the demons which dwell within the Temple of Ages That Are Not.

They will not bow or break, they will not give up on protecting the home and hope they hold dearest to their hearts, and they will never forget that what they are fighting for peace and freedom, home and happiness matters more than anything. Whether your reluctant hero is a homebody or simple farmer, an orphan or retired hero, a denier of destiny or a scoundrel with a heart of gold, you'll find all manner of abilities designed to help you tap into unknown reservoirs of strength like rise to the occasion, unflinching, he ain't heavy, and hold onto hope,  and may tap into the breadth of their experience with abilities like heirloom, one step ahead, or curse-bearer. A reluctant hero may get through with guile and luck with accidental observation, shot in the dark, lucky guess, and right place, right time, but she's equally adept at applying the keen insights of everyday wisdom with common sense, learning by example, trusty tools, and ever practical. A reluctant hero may seem harmless due to abilities like obscurity, cautious, innocent bystander, and I'm getting too old for this, but when disaster looms a reluctant hero may snatch from death, use everything, or declare that's not fair! or you shall be avenged! Whether your hero traces his roots to simple peasant life, long-faded glory, or a lineage that haunts his destiny, you'll find a wealth of ideas to make your reluctant heroes truly legendary!<br/><br/>"}, "194446": {"rpgdesigner": ["Clinton Boomer", "Jason Nelson"], "rpg": ["Pathfinder System Compatible Product"], "poll": [], "name": "Path of Villains", "rpgartist": ["Michael Jaecks", "Tim Kings-Lynne", "James J.

The British reformed near El Alamein, just 90 miles from Alexandria. After the repulse of a hasty attack in mid-July, Rommel orchestrated a more careful assault for the end of the month. His mobile troops were to swing wide into the desert to flank the British line and unhinge it. Eighth Army was waiting, forewarned by ULTRA intercepts. Its new commander, Bernard Mongomery, arrayed his armor along the ridge of Alam el Halfa. The German assault would pit the tactical finesse of Afrika Korps against greater numbers of tanks and guns. A German victory might complete the clearance of North Africa; a British victory could spell the end of Afrika Korps. El Alamein uses the Fire &amp; Movement system designed around the realities of mechanized warfare, giving motorized and/or specially-trained units clear advantages. Players can augment units at the instant of combat with support fire, provided by weapons ranging from mortars through cannon and light ground attack aircraft to heavy bombers. A seemingly predictable assault can be overturned at the last minute by heavy defending fires, while even small units may develop tremendous offensive punch with the assistance of a heavy bombardment.

Elsewhere, an aspiring ninja runs a gauntlet of nasty traps, attempting to make it through as quickly as possible, and without being hit, to improve her agility and reflexes, while a wizard pores over ancient tomes, memorizing facts and quizzing himself on them to improve his knowledge. A monk meditates under a waterfall, to better learn to block out distractions, and a bard decides to drop by a tavern and see if he can&rsquo;t make a few friends, just so he&rsquo;s not rusty at the upcoming banquet.<br/><br/>All of these characters are conditioning themselves. They are training, in one way or another to improve their abilities. And the more that they train, the better they will be. But training isn&rsquo;t something you can just finish. It is a constant process, and must be maintained, or else muscles, memory, and even social skills can fade and become soft. In the Pathfinder Roleplaying Game, the only way for a character to improve themselves is through killing things and gaining experience, and no amount of training or practice will truly matter.
