It was released for the PC followed by subsequent releases on the Sega CD, Mac and 3DO platforms.<br/><br/>Although the scenario, the plot, and the variety of missions were considered neither original nor rich, the game was valued for the technical details, since it featured digitized footage (albeit limited, most replaced by CGI rendered sequences) and music from the original movies, and full speech. Rebel Assault is one of the oldest titles to make use of extensive full motion video (FMV) on the PC. In this case the video was used to display pre-rendered 3D graphics that were far ahead of what a PC could render in real-time at the time. Developers pre-rendered various environments and battles and the player flew through these environments. Unfortunately, because it was pre-rendered 3D graphics, the level of player control was extremely limited. In fact, the player could not stray from the path in more than a few branched areas and was usually limited to only aiming the crosshairs at enemies.<br/><br/>The game consisted mainly of recreating famous scenes from the movies, rather than being accurate to the Star Wars storyline: it primarily follows the events of Star Wars Episode IV: A New Hope, but also includes elements from the Battle of Hoth.<br/><br/>The gameplay consists of various spaceflight missions, mainly confined in a certain video looping. The course of the ship is predetermined and the player has to hit the targets (usually TIE fighters) that appear onscreen; however, he is able to partially control and steer the ship so that it won't collide with obstacles and lose hit points. In a few stages, there are branching points but most stages consist of a straight run through to the end point or consist of a looping area until all targets are destroyed. One odd aspect of the game is that if the player moves the targeting cursor after firing, the shots that were already fired will actually follow the cursor. Bonus points are awarded for certain aspects such as accuracy, or whether certain accomplishments are made, such as successfully using a torpedo.<br/><br/>In some cases, original footage was filmed for the game with actors, and a Star Destroyer model was digitized (a mini camera 'flew' around it) for a certain mission. Most of the graphics were rendered in 3D.<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, Star Wars: Rebel Assault , available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "78035": {"statistics": {}, "name": "Spyro: A Hero's Tail", "videogamemode": {"2149": "Single-Player"}, "videogameversion": {"268703": "Australian PlayStation 2 Platinum Range edition"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1311031.jpg", "videogameseries": {"5042": "Spyro"}, "videogametheme": {"2148": "Fantasy"}, "videogamefranchise": {"6403": "Platinum Range (Best Selling PlayStation Games, PAL)"}, "average": "6.07143", "videogamegenre": {"2164": "Platform"}, "videogameplatform": {"4425": "GameCube"}, "usersrated": "7", "poll": {}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1311031_t.jpg", "description": "The game introduces a new antagonist, Red, a former Dragon Elder banished years before the events of the game, and sees the protagonist, Spyro the Dragon, attempt to defeat him with the aid of his best friend Sparx, Hunter the Cheetah, flying penguin Sgt.

Originally titled World of Wonders, the game incorporated several RPG elements that were dropped when simultaneous turns were implemented. The game was co-developed by Triumph Studios and Epic Games, Dutch and American game developers respectively, and published by Gathering of Developers in 1999. This game is notable for its detailed description of mythical creatures.<br/><br/>Players have an isometric view of the map, which consists of hexagonal tiles, and can have up to three layers (surface, caverns, and depths). Units are arranged into groups (also known as parties or stacks) of up to eight units; a single such group occupies one tile. Cities occupy between one and four tiles, and other structures generally occupy a single tile.<br/><br/>Each player leads a certain race. There are 12 races available in the game, though not all of them may be present on every map, and of those which are, not all may be playable. List of races includes traditional fantasy Elves, Lizardmen, Humans, Goblins, Dark Elves, Undead, Orcs, Dwarves and Halflings, as well as several unique ones such as Frostlings, Azracs, and Highmen. Races, as well as units not belonging to any specific race, such as dragons and giants, have a certain alignment, which can be good, neutral, or evil. According to their alignment and certain other factors, cities and independent units of one race can be friendly or hostile towards another race. This can manifest itself in different ways; for example, an orc city is not likely to surrender to the elves, and if conquered, may revolt unless there is a strong military presence in it to oppress the population. Units of hostile races forced to fight alongside each other in a single group will have lower morale, and are more likely to desert. Race relations can be improved by acts of goodwill towards other races, such as upgrading their cities, or hampered by razing, looting, or migrating cities belonging to that race. Diplomacy can also affect this and even an alliance with one race might affect the relation of another race. There are also several spells which have a global effect on race relations.<br/><br/>There are two resources, gold and mana. Gold is used to build units, buy heroes, cities and spells (in Wizard Towers), upgrade cities. Mana is used to cast and research spells and use altars.<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, Age of Wonders , available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "78039": {"statistics": {}, "name": "The First Blitzkrieg", "videogamemode": {"2410": "Asynchronous Multiplayer"}, "videogameversion": {"54982": "NA  Windows Edition"}, "average": "0", "videogameseries": {"6849": "Total War in Europe"}, "videogametheme": {"2508": "Military"}, "usersrated": "0", "videogamegenre": {"2158": "Strategy"}, "videogameplatform": {"4977": "Windows"}, "poll": {}, "description": "The First Blitzkrieg  is the start of what will be a series of games called Total War in Europe.

To get around tough turns on a track, the player can initiate a &quot;power slide&quot; by tapping and holding a finger on the screen.

F-Zero X is the third released installment in the F-Zero series and the first released video game in the franchise to feature 3D graphics.[9] The game has a steep learning curve and its gameplay experience is similar to that of the original F-Zero  title. Critics generally praised F-Zero X for its fast gameplay, abundance of courses and vehicles, track design, and maintaining a high framerate. However, the game has been widely criticized for its lack of graphical detail.<br/>  Gameplay:<br/>  F-Zero X is a futuristic racing video game where thirty pilots race on circuits inside plasma-powered hovercars in an intergalactic Grand Prix at speeds that can exceed 1000 km/h. The game can be used with a Rumble Pak, which allows for force feedback. <br/>  The tracks in the game include hills, loops, tunnels, corkscrews, and pipes.[13]  Some courses have innate obstacles like dirt patches, tricky jumps, and tubes to navigate. The game introduces 26 new vehicles, and brings back the four from the original F-Zero game.  Each has its own characteristics and performance abilities and before a race, the player is able to adjust a vehicle's balance between maximum acceleration and maximum top speed.<br/>  A normal race in F-Zero X consists of three laps around the track. Each machine has an energy meter, which serves two purposes. It is a measurement of the machine's health and is decreased, for example, when the machine hits another racer or the side of the track. If the player has a &quot;spare machine&quot;--the equivalent of an extra life--then falls off a track or runs out of energy, the race will be restarted. The game introduces the ability to attack the other racers by either utilizing a side or spin attack. Also, this is the first F-Zero game in which the player can boost after the first lap which greatly increases the vehicle's speed, but also drains its energy. Energy can be replenished by driving over recharge strips, called &quot;Pit Zones&quot;, located at various points around the track. There are also dash plates around the track that give a speed boost without using up any energy.<br/>  The title does introduce a &quot;death race&quot; mode and a random track generator called the &quot;X Cup&quot;. In the death race, the player's objective is to annihilate the 29 other racers as speedily as possible, while the X-Cup &quot;creates&quot; a different set of tracks each time played.&quot;<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;F-Zero X,&quot; available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "78069": {"statistics": {}, "name": "NHL 2K7", "videogamemode": {"2422": "Local Multiplayer"}, "videogameversion": {"55034": "English/UK PlayStation 2 edition"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic783476.jpg", "videogameseries": {"5206": "NHL 2K"}, "videogametheme": {"2367": "Sports - Hockey"}, "usersrated": "6", "average": "5.41667", "videogamegenre": {"2157": "Sports"}, "videogameplatform": {"4434": "PlayStation 2"}, "poll": {}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic783476_t.jpg", "description": "The legacy lives on!

It is the second game in the Star Ocean series. The game gives the player the choice of playing as Rena or Claude, with the journey evolving and ending differently depending on the choices one makes. It was also the first game in the Star Ocean series to be released in North America (in 1999) and Europe (in 2000), courtesy of Sony Computer Entertainment.<br/><br/>A PlayStation Portable remake was announced prior to the 2007 Square Enix Party event and released in Japan in 2008 and in North America and Europe in 2009.<br/><br/>The Second Story's gameplay is broadly similar to that of most RPGs. The player goes from town to town and dungeon to dungeon, following the central story and occasionally branching off to perform side quests. Characters gain Experience Points from battle and level up as a result, becoming gradually stronger as time passes and more battles are fought.<br/><br/>However, The Second Story is a member of the Star Ocean franchise, and as such features various deviations from the standard RPG format. Battles are much more action-oriented: they take place in real time, during which the player has manual control over their character, as opposed to choosing options from a menu. Battles take place on a broad battlefield, over which the player's character can move without limit, allowing them to trade blows face-to-face with the enemy or circle around for a flanking attack. The other party members (up to 3 others) are controlled by the game's AI; the player may change an ally's Strategy to one of six different pre-determined options (ranging from &quot;Spread out and attack&quot; to &quot;Save your Magic Points&quot; to &quot;Stand Still and Don't Do Anything&quot;).<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, Star Ocean: The Second Story , available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "78073": {"statistics": {}, "name": "The Caverns of Hammerfest", "videogamemode": {"2313": "Cooperative"}, "videogameversion": {"55042": "English Version"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1258697.png", "videogametheme": {"2337": "Cute Fantasy"}, "usersrated": "2", "average": "9", "videogamegenre": {"2314": "Arcade"}, "videogameplatform": {"5084": "Web Browser"}, "poll": {}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1258697_t.png", "description": "User Summary<br/><br/>The evil sorcerer Tuberculoz has risen from his deep caverns beneath the town of Hammerfest to enact his sinister plan...

The story is as such:  Renegade cyborgs known as the &quot;Teknos&quot; crash land their ship onto a planet rich in Aur, an important mineral.  They immediately begin to spread, attempting to gain control of the Aur.  However, the indigineous life on the planet fight back, and they take the name of the &quot;Arcane&quot;.  What ensues is an Unholy war between magic and technology.<br/><br/>In Unholy war, players take control of either the Teknos Team or the Arcane Team (or both) in arena-style combat in an attempt to eliminate their opponent.  Unlike usual fighting games, the arena is packed with terrain and obstacles and can be traversed by using the D-pad.  Players will chase each other across the levels and attempt to reduce each other's life to zero.  Each character has 3 attackes which are each activated with either the square, circle, or triangle buttons (x is jump, or fly).  In this way, fights are more strategic than button mashing since each attack works a specific way.  Attacks also drain energy, which is constantly recovering at a standard rate, and you can only use attacks you have the energy for.<br/><br/>The game has two modes: mayhem and strategy.  Mayhem is a good way to learn the game: it throws the players straight into the level(s) of their choosing and lets them fight until one side has no characters.  Strategy mode involves a board where resource sites must be mined to buy warriors in an attempt to destroy the enemy base and team.

In order to do so, you will have to give orders to your lowly Minions which will try to perform evil deeds, collect valuable resources, spread terror, fight heroes and cause general mayhem. Oh, another thing: there seem to be a few other Evil Lords around who are trying to conquer the world themselves: you will have to do it before them.<br/><br/>Apart from your Dark Tower, there are 6 places in the Realm: the Countryside, the Wood, the Sanctuary, the City, the Castle and the Dungeon. There are 6 basic orders you could give to a Minion: Bring me some Gold, Bring me some Food, Bring me some Mana, attempt a Diplomacy Mission, attempt a War Mission, and Have some Fun. (Note that the Minion&rsquo;s concept of &quot;Diplomacy&quot; includes poisoning, forging, stealing and so on). <br/>Each turn you could give to a Minion just 1 of these 12 orders, thus selecting either what must he door where should him go, by means of placement on an apposite  board. <br/>For example, if you assign him the task of recovering some Gold, he will decide by himself if looking for it in the Dungeon or in the Sanctuary or elsewhere. <br/>On the other hand, if you order him to go to the Wood, it will be upon to him to decide either of having some Fun, or looking for Mana, or else.  <br/>The Minion will decide it by drawing an Evil Deed Card.<br/><br/>There are all sort of Evil Deeds, ranging  from &quot;Poison the Good King in the Castle&quot; to &quot;Beat the Monks for Fun in the Sanctuary&quot;, an each will identify univocally both where the Minion will go and what will he try to do. <br/>The chance of actually being able to perform the Evil Deed will depend on chance (die roll), special ability of the Minion (such as &quot;Violence&quot;, &quot;Stealth&quot;, &quot;Persuasion&quot; and so on; each kind on Minion has his own) and on the nature of the Evil Deed. <br/>It could be that after the Evil Deed determination there are Minions of different Dark Lord in the same Place: in that case they will not tolerate the presence of the other(s) and they will fight until the other(s) will die. Also some Evil Deed Missions will involve a fighting with a Hero (randomly drawn from the Hero Deck). <br/>By performing Evil Deeds successfully you will be able to  collect basic resources (Gold, Food and Mana), Special Items (to increase the capabilities of your Minions), and components for your Doomsday devices.<br/><br/>In addition, as you progress in your path of darkness, you will become both feared and hated by the Heroes of the Realm: while being feared is a good thing (Aid Minions in combat), since will aid your minions in combat situations, being hated too much could bring trouble, since will increase the probability of you being attacked by Heroes.<br/><br/>"}, "78098": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic869155.jpg", "poll": {}, "boardgamedesigner": {"2558": {"name": "J\u00fcrgen Heel"}}, "statistics": {}, "yearpublished": "2003", "maxplayers": "4", "boardgameartist": {"12721": "Klaus Baumgart"}, "boardgamepublisher": {"8": {"name": "AMIGO Spiel + Freizeit GmbH"}}, "maxplaytime": "15", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic869155_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "15", "boardgamecategory": {"1041": {"name": "Children's Game"}}, "description": "own description:<br/>A memory variant based on the Laura books (Baumhaus Verlag).<br/>The goal is to uncover the 12 tiles in the right chronological order, then the winning child may retell the story with the aid of the motives of the tiles.<br/><br/>Amigo press release:<br/>Eine ganz besondere Memory-Variante ist das Geschichten Memo Lauras Geheimnis.

They provide mana  for the production of new units and can be turned into buildings or monsters. When four are placed on a foundation, they may transform into a mystical site dedicated to the kind of magic the player&rsquo;s choosing. Placing a Basal Golem adjacent to a friendly mystical site will allow them to change into a different creature, based on the type of mystical site. The player automatically is only able to use the weakest transformation, and can unlock more by researching. Researching costs experience, which is gained by creating or transforming Basal Golems, creating or destroying structures, casting spells and slaying enemies.<br/><br/>The single player game consists of five regular campaigns of increasing difficulty followed by a world conquest (a long campaign during which the player conquers all 15 maps and then challenges the gods themselves). In all regular campaigns the player can choose one of two sides of conflict. To unlock the next campaign, the player has to finish the current campaign at least once. The storylines of all campaigns are typical fantasy tales (without any explicit AD&amp;D references), although each campaign has its own take on the genre.

The king&iacute;s troops were pushed back into one last royal province, and the rulers of the other provinces waged terrible, destructive wars against one another. The whole land fell into a state of chaos and now the former royal capital itself is under siege by the armies of the rebel lords. You belong to the last remaining group of loyal king&iacute;s men, and have been commanded to go to the king in view of the imminent attack.<br/><br/>Game Scenario<br/>Knights and Merchants recreates the era of the Middle Ages. Apart from the purely fictitious geography of our world, all game elements and scenes are based on the European, but more particularly, the Anglo-Saxon period, around 1200 A.D. We have not used imaginary elements like, for example, fabled creatures. The player takes on the role of a ordinary captain in the Palace Guard. A conspiracy against the king catapults the captain into a situation where he finds himself responsible for the defense of the last royal province. This is all that remains of the shattered kingdom, which has been split into numerous small principalities and earldoms. And now even the king himself, ensconced in his capital, is threatened by enemy armies. This is the starting point of your Middle Ages adventure. Now you, the player, must win back all those provinces which once belonged to your king.<br/><br/>General info about the game system<br/>Knights and Merchants can be described as a strategic economy simulation. In the main, the economics play a major role in this real-time action game. The player can manufacture different products, making use of numerous buildings and producer goods of the Middle Ages period. He can use his serfs to construct and maintain buildings and roads. The economical structuring is very specific. You manufacture finished products using various raw materials which go through your production processes. All these manufacturing systems are highly detailed and visually understandable, enabling fast and dependable control of your economy. One result of all your productive labors is the manufacture of weapons and armor. But the logistics, too, are really worth a mention. You decide where and how merchandise will be transported on the network of streets which you yourself have planned and constructed. Your serfs transport all wares between buildings, so your town planning plays a major role in production time per building, and, resulting from that, just how efficient your economy as a whole is going to be. Transported goods are displayed graphically. Each figure in the game has his/her own mission area and carries out individual tasks independently. They don&iacute;t depend on your commands or actions. You, the player, only give indirect commands for the construction of buildings, streets, corn fields, etc. However, you do have complete control of the military units.<br/><br/>Source: The Publisher Website.<br/><br/>"}, "78139": {"videogame": {"83275": "Silent Hunter Commander's Edition"}, "statistics": {}, "name": "Silent Hunter Patrol Disk 2", "videogamemode": {"2149": "Single-Player"}, "videogameversion": {"55176": "US DOS Release"}, "average": "0", "videogameseries": {"5456": "Silent Hunter"}, "videogametheme": {"2273": "War - World War II"}, "usersrated": "0", "videogameexpansion": {"75419": "Silent Hunter"}, "videogamegenre": {"2156": "Simulation"}, "videogameplatform": {"4714": "DOS"}, "poll": {}, "videogamecompilation": {"83275": "Silent Hunter Commander's Edition"}, "description": "Includes an upgrade to Silent Hunter 1.2 and a scenario editor.<br/><br/>New patrol zones for Hong Kong and Vietnam (Indochina) and fifteen new historical scenarios.<br/><br/>"}, "78140": {"videogame": {"83275": "Silent Hunter Commander's Edition"}, "statistics": {}, "name": "Silent Hunter Patrol Disk 3", "videogamemode": {"2149": "Single-Player"}, "videogameversion": {"55178": "US DOS Release"}, "average": "0", "videogameseries": {"5456": "Silent Hunter"}, "videogametheme": {"2273": "War - World War II"}, "usersrated": "0", "videogameexpansion": {"75419": "Silent Hunter"}, "videogamegenre": {"2156": "Simulation"}, "videogameplatform": {"4714": "DOS"}, "poll": {}, "videogamecompilation": {"83275": "Silent Hunter Commander's Edition"}, "description": "Adds 2 patrol zones - Aleutian Islands and Java Sea - and 15  historical scenarios.<br/><br/>This disk was only available by ordering online with SSI or SUBSIM Review, and later in the bundle pack Silent Hunter Commander's Edition<br/><br/>"}, "78141": {"statistics": {}, "name": "Crash Bandicoot Nitro Kart 2", "videogamemode": {"2310": "Network Multiplayer"}, "videogameversion": {"55182": "iPhone edition"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic805131.jpg", "videogameseries": {"6540": "Crash Bandicoot (Racing)"}, "videogametheme": {"2471": "Animals"}, "videogamegenre": {"2154": "Racing"}, "average": "5", "videogamefranchise": {"6541": "Crash Bandicoot"}, "videogameplatform": {"4443": "iPhone"}, "usersrated": "1", "poll": {}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic805131_t.jpg", "description": "Crash Bandicoot Nitro Kart 2 was developed by Polarbit for the iPhone and iPod Touch and was released on May 27, 2010 on the App Store.

It is evident that Alma does not want the rogue Replica soldier to reach his and Paxton's goal, and she proceeds to try to defeat the player with Replica still under her control, and the strange ghost-like beings she has implemented in previous instalments of the game.<br/><br/>When the player reaches the original blast site, and proceeds deep under the rubble, Paxton makes reference to other soldiers that will be his, and the player's army. They can be seen as ghosts, but unlike those used by Alma or encountered in any of the other F.E.A.R. games. If the player uses the slo-mo ability, they become visible as Replica soldiers not unlike the player's character. They are marching ceaselessly towards a large, red, beam that appears to be the player's destination. After fighting a few more of Alma's ghosts, the player opens a door to find Paxton Fettel, kneeling in the middle of the room. This is clearly a juxtaposition to the opening cinematic of F.E.A.R. where Alma enters Fettel's room through a similar door. Fettel welcomes the player as &quot;brother&quot; and reaches out in a similar fashion. As he touches the player, Fettel melts away. After he disappears completely, the Replica soldier removes his helmet to reveal Paxton Fettel's face, as Fettel's voice narrates that he has been reborn.<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, FEAR 2#F.E.A.R. 2: Reborn , available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "78147": {"videogame": {"121110": "F.E.A.R.

When an evil power takes over Hereitscool, Jimmy becomes Rayman, a super hero who must save his friends before it's too late!  But it was scrapped for obvious reasons, and Rayman is his own being in his own world in the final version.

The object of the game is to free all the electoons and defeat Mister Dark's minions across six worlds: Dream Forest, Band Land, Blue Mountains, Picture City, Cave of Skops, and Candy Chateau aka Mr darks lair.  Only when every electoon is freed will Rayman be able to enter into Mister Dark's hideout in Candy Chateau.  Otherwise, the player must traverse the levels and reach the goal (a signpost with an exclamation mark on it) at the end. But usually, since all of the levels in the game are divided into several parts, said goal post usually acts as a transition to another part of the level.<br/><br/>Rayman will come across a variety of other power-ups and bonuses, among which a golden punching fist, a faster punching fist, power to restore Rayman's lost life energy and flying blue elves that will shrink Rayman down in size.<br/><br/>"}, "78166": {"statistics": {}, "name": "Ken Griffey, Jr. Presents Major League Baseball", "videogamemode": {"2422": "Local Multiplayer"}, "videogameversion": {"186393": "North American Game Boy edition"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic808917.jpg", "videogametheme": {"2360": "Sports - Baseball"}, "usersrated": "8", "average": "7.46875", "videogamegenre": {"2157": "Sports"}, "videogameplatform": {"4422": "Game Boy"}, "poll": {}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic808917_t.jpg", "description": "&quot;Ken Griffey, Jr. Presents Major League Baseball is a Super NES baseball game that was released in 1994.

However, the evil sorcerer, who previously lost that battle, has returned.  It's up to Sir Dan to valiantly fight, eyeless and jawless, to earn his reputation.<br/><br/>The game mixes medieval fantasy with just a slight bit of horror.  Very little is actually that scary; in fact, much of the game is quite farcical.  This does not take away from the actual gameplay experience though.<br/><br/>Players will travel through various levels, tracking Zarok (the sorcerer) through Gallowmere.  Along the way, they will meet its quirky inhabitants, many of which will offer a helping hand.  The player can simply run through the levels without looking back, or they can explore each level fully, slaying enemies to fill the &quot;chalice of souls&quot;.  Filling the chalice will cause it to appear in the level to be collected, which will then grant the player access to the hall of heroes.  This is required to gain most new weapons as well as other goodies.  Amongst the weapons players stand to gain are better swords, long bows, an axe, a dragon potion, and even chicken drumsticks.<br/><br/>Medievil was a breath of fresh air to the Action Adventure genre.

In this future, cars are a primary means of protection and defense and the highways are dangerous stretches of land ruled by gangs and vigilantes with armed vehicles. The player's character starts without a car and has to enter amateur night in which they are provided a vehicle in order to raise enough capital to finance the creation of their own vehicle.<br/>With their own vehicle, a character can begin performing courier missions between the various towns along the Atlantic seaboard&mdash;including Syracuse, Boston, Manchester (Origin's headquarters at the time, which could be visited in the game) and Atlantic City among a few. The character may also enter more distinguished Arena events to earn money as well as take to the highways to fight the other cars and salvage their parts. In this sense, the game was very open-ended in what the player could do. The game also had a storyline, involving certain critical courier tasks, such as carrying important criminal evidence through the dangerous terrain between cities.<br/>The main feature of the game was combat involving customized vehicles. The vehicle construction portion of the game allowed a variety of power plants, guns, ammunition, mine-layers, smokescreens, oil slicks and rockets to be arranged onto an even larger selection of body and chassis types.<br/>The game was developed using a top-down perspective and featured two distinct setting areas: the arena or highway style area and the city area. The highway and arenas allowed acceleration and driving skills to be used in a scrolling screen format, while the city area was a single screen in which stores and other attractions of a city could be visited.<br/>description from: <a target='_blank' href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autoduel' rel='nofollow'>http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autoduel</a><br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, Autoduel , available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>Catchphrase: &quot;Where the right of way goes to the biggest guns.&quot;<br/><br/>"}, "78243": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic782732.jpg", "is_expanded_by": {"79367": {"name": "Step Chain: Expansion Set"}}, "poll": {}, "boardgamedesigner": {"39637": {"name": "Greg Miller"}}, "statistics": {}, "yearpublished": "2010", "maxplayers": "4", "boardgamepublisher": {"2456": {"name": "The Game Crafter, LLC"}}, "maxplaytime": "15", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic782732_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "15", "boardgamecategory": {"1009": {"name": "Abstract Strategy"}}, "description": "The simple, yet challenging, strategic card game where you match your cards to continue your chain.

Reviews of the game have almost always been highly complimentary. Racing Destruction Set has spawned a number of remakes and clones on other platforms.<br/><br/>The game was a one or two-player game played with joysticks. Player 1 controlled the red car on the top screen and player 2 controlled the yellow car on the bottom screen.<br/>The game had several features which created a classic and innovative computer game. First, the game allowed the player to create different race tracks using a variety of templates. The player could create ramps and elevation changes in the layout of the track as well. The builder also had the options to change the type of terrain&mdash;laying slippery ice stretches of track, normal track, or difficult sandy sections of track.<br/>For a particular race, the player could change a variety of features. The player could alter the gravity to reflect gravity on different planets or the moon. The player had the option of changing which vehicle they wanted to race in and make customized changes to the tires, engine and other aspects of the vehicle. The vehicles available were a Can-Am sports car, a Jeep, a Lunar Rover, a dirt bike, a baja bug, a pickup, a Sting Ray, a stock car, a street bike, and a indy/gran prix car[1].<br/>The race was done in split-screen mode, with one player able to race in the top half of the screen and another player in the bottom. The races had an option for racing mode or destruction mode. In racing mode, a number of laps were chosen and the quickest to complete them was the winner. In destruction mode, each player had access to oil slicks and landmines which could be ejected from the back of the vehicles.<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, Racing Destruction Set , available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "78245": {"statistics": {}, "name": "Transcendence", "videogamemode": {"2149": "Single-Player"}, "videogameversion": {"55423": "Windows Downloadable edition"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic783215.jpg", "videogametheme": {"2264": "Science Fiction"}, "usersrated": "6", "average": "6.66667", "videogamegenre": {"2161": "Action Adventure"}, "videogameplatform": {"4977": "Windows"}, "poll": {}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic783215_t.jpg", "description": "Transcendence is a realtime game of space combat and adventure.

In the game, the player chooses a hockey team and then plays against either a computer or human player on an ice rink. The goal is to score the most goals within the given time through steering the puck, speeding down the rink, and fighting other players for the control of the puck.<br/><br/>Nintendo NHL Stanley Cup lets all 26 teams from the National Hockey League at the time of the game's release (including the expansion Florida Panthers and Mighty Ducks of Anaheim) compete for the highest honor in professional hockey, the Stanley Cup. As it licenses from the NHL, but not the NHLPA, the game can use the team logos and the Stanley Cup but not the names of real players. Despite this, the players have strengths and weaknesses that correspond to their real-life counterparts, so e.g. Pittsburgh Penguins #66 or Los Angeles Kings #99 have an easier time scoring. You can substitute for or pull your goalie and institute line changes, but not line edits, as you see fit. Gameplay modes consist of Exhibition, Season and Best of Seven Series. Options include three different period lengths (5, 10 or 20 minutes) and having the penalties and line changes turned on or off.<br/><br/>This game mimics real ice hockey in that you can shoot, pass or dump the puck, and you can perform hip, shoulder and poke checks. You can even fake a slap shot and aim your shot on goal to a particular corner of the net. Hockey is an overtly brutal sport, and this game reflects that, but there are numerous penalties that you can commit, including tripping, cross checking, slashing, roughing, hooking, interference, icing and offsides.<br/><br/>A special Mode 7 viewpoint gives you a three-dimensional perspective that helps you keep your eyes focused on the puck, the center ice and the surrounding action. Battery backup lets you save your progress throughout the Stanley Cup playoffs. Other features include season and game statistics, three difficulty levels (Junior, NHL and NHL Pro), and the ability to skip games against particular opponents. After the end of each game, a sportscaster will give you a complete wrap up of the action.<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, NHL Stanley Cup , available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "78267": {"statistics": {}, "name": "The Simpsons: Bartman meets Radioactive Man", "videogamemode": {"2149": "Single-Player"}, "videogameversion": {"55458": "US NES edition"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic868683.jpg", "videogametheme": {"2319": "Cartoon"}, "videogamefranchise": {"5272": "The Simpsons"}, "average": "6", "videogamegenre": {"2164": "Platform"}, "videogameplatform": {"4430": "NES"}, "usersrated": "2", "poll": {}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic868683_t.jpg", "description": "At the beginning of Bartman Meets Radioactive Man, Bart Simpson is at home reading a Radioactive Man comic book only to be shocked as Radioactive Man's sidekick, Fallout Boy, jumps out of it.

The British missions revolve around the actual events at Wolfheze and Arnhem and the attempted capture of the bridge. The Japanese missions are centered along the lines of tropical jungle warfare and the use of tanks is somewhat limited whereas the Soviet campaign is based on the capture of the city of Kharkov and other battles along the Dniepr river waged by the Soviet Red Army.<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, Sudden Strike , available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "78286": {"statistics": {}, "name": "Guild Wars", "videogamemode": {"2327": "Massively Multiplayer"}, "videogameversion": {"116406": "English/European Windows edition"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic782018.jpg", "videogameseries": {"5052": "Guild Wars"}, "videogametheme": {"2148": "Fantasy"}, "usersrated": "121", "videogamecharacter": {"24541": "Assassin"}, "videogameexpansion": {"78289": "Guild Wars: Eye of the North"}, "average": "7.35124", "videogamegenre": {"2339": "Action RPG"}, "videogameplatform": {"4977": "Windows"}, "videogamehonor": {"30981": "2005 Spike Best Multiplayer Game of the Year Winner"}, "poll": {}, "vgcharacterversion": {"272859": "Assassin"}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic782018_t.jpg", "description": "In a world torn by conflict, where human kingdoms are all but destroyed and guilds sacrifice all for a chance to control the Hall of Heroes, a champion must rise from the ruins of a once-proud land to lead refugees from the ashes and fulfill an ancient prophecy.

In 2007, Actua Pool was ported to the Nintendo DS handheld game console, under the title Underground Pool in North America.<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;<a target='_blank' href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Actua_Pool,&quot' rel='nofollow'>http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Actua_Pool,&quot</a>; available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "78321": {"statistics": {}, "name": "Actua Tennis", "videogamemode": {"2422": "Local Multiplayer"}, "videogameversion": {"55621": "Playstation edition"}, "average": "0", "videogametheme": {"2368": "Sports - Tennis"}, "videogamegenre": {"2157": "Sports"}, "videogamefranchise": {"6877": "Actua Sports"}, "videogameplatform": {"4433": "PlayStation"}, "usersrated": "0", "poll": {}, "description": "User summary<br/><br/>The only tennis title in the Actua Sports series of games.<br/><br/>Design a player and then enter various tournaments across the globe.<br/><br/>Commentary by former Wimbledon champion Pat Cash.<br/><br/>"}, "78322": {"statistics": {}, "name": "Dive: The Medes Islands Secret", "videogamemode": {"2149": "Single-Player"}, "videogameversion": {"55623": "NA Wii Edition"}, "average": "0", "videogametheme": {"2542": "Ocean / Sea"}, "usersrated": "0", "videogamegenre": {"2156": "Simulation"}, "videogameplatform": {"4441": "Wii"}, "poll": {}, "description": "From the Publisher Website<br/>Over the past five centuries, hundreds of ships flying every ensign have succumbed to the power of the ocean.

You know, of course, that people who build railroad companies are the most generous people in the world. They love to help out their competitors, with a motto of &ldquo;all for the greater good&rdquo; while having boatloads of fun. In this expansion, you&rsquo;ll share track with your opponents while they share track with you. And all it takes to share? A share!<br/><br/>Yes, you&rsquo;re still competing with other players to move all the gifts everyone has gotten for each other to the correct party, but you&rsquo;re doing it with a wink of your eye and a fun little skip to your step. Sure, there&rsquo;s still only one winner, but it&rsquo;s really about how many friends you make while playing...and doesn&rsquo;t that make everyone a winner?<br/><br/>Sharing is for 3 to 6 players who really care about other people.<br/><br/>If you find the &ldquo;regular&rdquo; Sharing rules for Ted Alspach&rsquo;s Sharing Steam/Age of Steam expansion too competitive for your tastes, try this softer, more pleasant expansion map (on the reverse side of &ldquo;Sharing&rdquo;). You&rsquo;ll be guaranteed to make more friends in Steam/Age of Steam than ever before!<br/><br/>What if Steam/Age of Steam was a truly cooperative game, like Shadows over Camelot with out a traitor? Or if no one had to die in Clue, so you could just mosey around that neat mansion talking to your friends? Or if there were no diseases in Pandemic, or no ghosts in Ghost Story? Wouldn&rsquo;t that be fun? Sure it would!<br/>Ted Alspach&rsquo;s *Really* Friendly Sharing is for 2 to 10 players who don&rsquo;t have some horribly recessive competitive gene.<br/><br/>In Ted Alspach&rsquo;s *Really* Friendly Sharing, you work as a team to build a railroad. Many of the aspects that cause unnecessary tension in Age of Steam have been removed, like money and the AoS auction, so you can focus on laying track, making deliveries, getting VPs and having fun!<br/><br/>The 2010 Essen Aos/Steam map pack from Bezier Games features 8 new maps, including 6 mounted ones on 3 double sided expansions.

Following in the footsteps of side scrolling action games such as the Contra and Mega Man series, The Ultimate Stuntman gives the player access to a variety of levels with different concepts. A basic recurring theme in the game is the concept of three levels, a boss fight, and then a &quot;bomb disposal.&quot; In most cases, the first level in the sequence involves Stuntman chasing down Dr. Evil in some form of vehicle such as a car, hang glider, dune buggy, etc... The second series of levels has Stuntman fighting evil on foot with the help of a firearm. The third series uses a concept where the player controls Stuntman who needs to climb a structure, similar to Crazy Climber's gameplay, but at the same time, the player acts as a sniper in Stuntman's aid by shooting down objects and creatures that threaten him while he ascends. During these levels, only one action can be conducted at any given time (i.e. the player can move Stuntman, or snipe enemies on his behalf). Once a Boss has been defeated, the player is confronted with the daunting task of disposing a bomb before the fuse has been entirely burnt. The player must use the directional pad to move the cursor from block to block keeping an eye on the number on each one. Every time the cursor moves to a certain block, the number on it decreases by one. This creates a puzzle-like scenario, where if the player makes a mistake he must reset the disposal and try again with less time. One cannot advance in the game without completing the bomb disposal in the given time.<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, Ultimate Stuntman , available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "78429": {"statistics": {}, "name": "Just Dance", "videogamemode": {"2422": "Local Multiplayer"}, "videogameversion": {"55805": "US Wii edition"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1494490.jpg", "videogameseries": {"8337": "Just Dance"}, "videogametheme": {"2510": "Dancing"}, "usersrated": "15", "average": "7.12667", "videogamegenre": {"2294": "Fitness"}, "videogameplatform": {"4441": "Wii"}, "poll": {}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1494490_t.jpg", "description": "From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia:<br/><br/>Just Dance is a music video game developed and published by Ubisoft for the Wii.

The player can choose from several different types of punches and defensive maneuvers, along with unique special attacks. The player revives their stamina during the round interval by pressing the button rapidly.<br/><br/>The boxer's abilities are determined by three different stats; punch, stamina, and speed. The player can improve these stats using the power points gained after each match. Performing well in matches allows the player to create more powerful boxers. The player can save their game progress by recording a password, and two players can face off against each other in the two-player mode. Though the game is rudimentary, it is possible to counter-punch, and missing with too many punches causes the boxer's stamina to decrease.<br/><br/>The biggest characteristic of the game is the comical set of special attacks. These moves are activated when the player presses the attack button at the right timing and at the right distance. The attacks have the capability to instantly knock out the opponent, but being countered before a special attack causes an extraordinary amount of damage as well. The first special attack is a powerful hook which the boxer throws by spinning around like a top. The second is a straight punch that propels the opponent into the ropes when it connects. The third type is an uppercut that launches the opponent straight into the air. If thrown at the right timing, the uppercut can blast the opponent straight out of the ring, resulting in a technical knockout<br/><br/>The NES/Famicom version of Ring King/Family Boxing created some controversy because the boxers' cornermen appear to be performing fellatio on them between rounds. Though the scene was only intended to show the cornermen placing the Foul Cup into the boxer's trunks, the graphical limiations of the NES made the scene appear questionable. The boxers may also appear to be hugging as they grapple because of the game's poor graphics.<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, Ring King , available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "78431": {"boardgamedesigner": {"39964": {"name": "Robert Dane"}}, "poll": {}, "name": "Beehive", "playingtime": "45", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": {"2080": "Area Control / Area Influence"}, "yearpublished": "2010", "usersrated": "7", "boardgamefamily": {"7564": "Animals: Bees"}, "maxplayers": "4", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic786115_t.jpg", "average": "7", "statistics": {}, "boardgamepublisher": {"4": {"name": "(Self-Published)"}}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic786115.jpg", "boardgameversion": {"55810": "Print and Play edition"}, "maxplaytime": "45", "boardgamecategory": {"1089": {"name": "Animals"}}, "age": "0", "minplaytime": "45", "description": "Beehive is a fun simple game where players take on the role of a swarm of bees making honey.

The game can be played by two to four players each using one of the colors: blue, green, red, or yellow.  What is unique about this game are the playing pieces.  Each piece is about 1/2 inch in height and pieces are of various shapes.  If you look straight down on the pieces from above, the shapes are: square, triangle, circle, diamond, and octagon.  Furthermore, the square pieces come in three sizes: small, medium, and large.  In the basic game, only three of the shapes are used.  Many advanced variations exist, including one in which all the shapes are used.<br/><br/>The game board has a series of tracks that lead from the start area to home.  Each piece must follow the track that matches its shape.  The square piece must follow the square track, the circular piece must follow the circular track and so on.  The tracks connect to each of the player's start areas to the central home area and hence intersect with each other.<br/><br/>Certain points on the tracks and intersections allow players to jump their piece over other pieces or to bump opponents pieces back along their respective tracks.<br/><br/>Finally, players can roll up to five dice (just once) to gain additional movement points.  Players must cover the numbers 1 to 6 with the five dice.  Two or more dice can be used to cover one number.  For example, on a roll of 1-2-2-3-6, the player could cover the numbers 1, 2, 5, and 6.  In this example, 3 and 4 would be left uncovered, allowing the player to move pieces an additional seven spaces.<br/><br/>The first player to move all of his pieces to home is the winner.<br/><br/>"}, "78440": {"poll": {}, "name": "Hiyokomame", "playingtime": "0", "minplayers": "1", "yearpublished": "0", "usersrated": "2", "boardgamefamily": {"5841": "Food / Cooking"}, "maxplayers": "0", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic785446_t.jpg", "average": "7.5", "statistics": {}, "boardgamepublisher": {"7283": {"name": "Layup"}}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic785446.jpg", "boardgameversion": {"55830": "First edition"}, "maxplaytime": "0", "boardgamecategory": {"1032": {"name": "Action / Dexterity"}}, "age": "0", "minplaytime": "0", "description": "A game to learn how to eat with chopsticks.

It is the prequel to Solomon's Key, and is known as Solomon's Key 2 in Europe and Solomon no Kagi 2: Coolmintou Kyuushutsu Sakusen (Solomon's Key 2: Coolmint Rescue Mission) in Japan.<br/><br/>The aim of the game involves players extinguishing all fires in a level in order to proceed. They do this by having the ability to create or melt ice (in a Lode Runner style) or kick ice onto the fires. This game also has a level editor, but only the Japanese version permits saving the levels one creates.<br/><br/>The following is taken from the video game's instruction booklet:<br/><br/>The Rescue of Coolmint Island <br/>This is a story from long ago, when the powerful wizard Dana was just a beginner. In the sea to the far north, there was a small island made of ice. This island was called &quot;Coolmint Island&quot;. On this beautiful little island of ice, there were many Winter Fairies all living in peace. <br/>But one day... <br/>The wicked wizard Druidle appeared, and let flames loose on Coolmint Island! The flames scattered all over the island, and little by little, they began to melt the ice. The little island was in terrible danger!! The Winter Fairies were determined to do something to save their island, but they were not strong enough to face the flames by themselves. The Queen of the Fairies knew about the danger the Winter Fairies were facing, so she called forth a wizard to fight against the flames let loose by Druidle. <br/>The one chosen by the Queen of the Fairies to defend the island was Dana. This was a tremendous surprise to everybody. Dana was still just an apprentice and had very little magic power of his own. But the Queen knew that Dana had intelligence and possessed more courage than anyone else. Then the Queen gave Dana some special magic that could be used to put out the wicked flames. <br/>&quot;And what happened after that, Grandmother?&quot; <br/>&quot;Well... that's where Dana's adventure begins.&quot;<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, Fire 'n Ice , available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "78448": {"statistics": {}, "name": "M.U.S.C.L.E.", "videogamemode": {"2422": "Local Multiplayer"}, "videogameversion": {"136560": "JP Famicom edition"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic824388.jpg", "videogametheme": {"2375": "Sports - Wrestling"}, "usersrated": "2", "videogameexpansion": {"117821": "Ultimate Muscle: Legends vs New Generation"}, "average": "4.75", "videogamegenre": {"2147": "Action"}, "videogameplatform": {"4430": "NES"}, "poll": {}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic824388_t.jpg", "description": "M.U.S.C.L.E., known in Japan as Kinnikuman Muscle Tag Match, is a NES wrestling game based on characters from the Yudetamago's manga and anime series Kinnikuman.

We wish we had in our world what our favorite characters have in their worlds. Sometimes, getting what we want is worse than not getting it. Fictional worlds are as real as our own, separated by nothing more than quantum probability.<br/><br/>Metafiction is a two-page RPG about people who can travel to fictional worlds and bring parts of them into our world. Characters are described in terms of how closely they resonate with these alternate worlds, in both useful and dangerous ways. They use points of Coincidence between themselves and certain works of fiction to draw those imagined worlds into our own reality, or to travel from one saga to another. Points of Entanglement tie them far too closely to these worlds, turning them into pawns of fiction. Ideal for an evening of escapism, the game is designed with a three-panel layout, so it can be folded into a pamphlet. Everyone at the table can have both their character sheet and a complete copy of the rules!<br/><br/>Metafiction was designed as part of the Compact RPG Challenge at The Forge.

The map of Europe is phenomenal in its size, detail, and accuracy. It uses a scale of 1 hex is 15 miles! There are over 4,000 counters!!! It includes land, air, and naval units. As a bonus, the game can be broken down into smaller mini campaigns, very helpful when you haven't the table area for the full map!!! I was privileged to talk in detail with John Bannerman, one of the designers.<br/><br/>This is part of the blurb from the game's web site.<br/><br/>4480 counters covering the ground, naval and air forces of (in order of &ldquo;appearance&rdquo;): Germany, Poland, Great Britain and The Commonwealth, France, the Soviet Union, Denmark, Norway, The Netherlands, Belgium and Italy.  These are supported by a meticulously researched Order of Battle for the first year of the Second World War and include additional details for the United Kingdom and Germany until June 1941.<br/><br/>17 map sections (14&rdquo; x 21&frac12;&rdquo;) for a total of 35 sq ft of maps from North Cape to Bologna and Brest to Minsk at 15 miles per hex.  Laid out, the maps occupy an area of approximately 7&rsquo; x 6&rsquo; and have been created using digital mapping software developed in-house by Diffraction Entertainment.  Maps have been painstakingly digitised from period topographical maps in the 1:250,000 to 1:300,000 range.<br/><br/>The extensive Rule Set has been devised from the start as a standard for the entire game series including a framework for an exhaustive set of Political and Economic rules defining each nation&rsquo;s operational parameters and special cases.  By the last game in the Second World War Series, these will have evolved into a detailed production model allowing players to explore different strategic options for the major combatants.<br/>Multiple modules covering Poland (Stab in the Back), Scandinavia (Operation Weser&uuml;bung), France 1940 plus The Battle of Britain (War in the West), and of course, Blitz!, a grand module to link all these together to cover the first year of the Second World War.<br/>Ground unit values are derived from OLI formulas originally devised by Trevor N Dupuy, a methodology that allows many different weapon systems to be consistently rated then summed using the ground unit&rsquo;s TO&amp;E to give a theoretical operational combat value.  Differences in national capabilities of training, leadership, communications and other &ldquo;soft&rdquo; factors are simulated using a Combat Effectiveness Value (CEV) for each nation which is then used as a multiplier to the basic unit combat value.  CEV evolves for each nation during the war showing increasing competence for Allied forces and, after initial increases due to combat experience, a decreasing capability for German forces as manpower and unit TO&amp;E&rsquo;s degrade in capability.<br/><br/>Naval units down to destroyers are shown as individual ship counters with lesser ships and submarines depicted as flotillas.  Major liners also have individual counters so as to denote their special high-speed capabilities for transporting personnel.  The naval system utilises a naval zone approximately 75 miles wide superimposed on the 15 mile hex grid so that the unique properties of naval and air-sea interaction can be modelled simply but still keep the essential flavour of naval operations with brief bursts of high intensity operations.<br/>Air Units are sized so that half units are available for carrier operations and have been rated by a bespoke system taking in to account a large number of performance parameters.  To reflect the attritional nature of air operations, air replacements are required to be expended just to keep forces in operation in addition to replacing combat losses.  Emphasis has been placed in the rules to encourage historical missions rather than wholesale commitment of airpower to offensive and defensive close air support.<br/><br/>"}, "78469": {"boardgamedesigner": {"39637": {"name": "Greg Miller"}}, "poll": {}, "name": "Tourist Traps", "playingtime": "30", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": {"2007": "Pick-up and Deliver"}, "yearpublished": "2010", "usersrated": "0", "maxplayers": "6", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic782726_t.jpg", "average": "0", "statistics": {}, "boardgamepublisher": {"2456": {"name": "The Game Crafter, LLC"}}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic782726.jpg", "boardgameversion": {"55894": "First Edition"}, "maxplaytime": "30", "boardgamecategory": {"1002": {"name": "Card Game"}}, "age": "12", "minplaytime": "30", "description": "Tourist Trap is a card game where you see how many vacations you can complete before you run out of money.

Maximo is an attempt to merge Ghosts 'n Goblins universe with illustrator Susumu Matsushita manga artwork.<br/><br/>Maximo takes place in a dynamic, fully 3D  world. The character is controlled by the player and can move freely within areas by running, jumping, crouching, and performing other various motions. Gameplay revolves around defeating large numbers of enemies, which can be accomplished by attacking with a sword and shield and combos and special moves. Like in the Ghosts  series, Maximo fights wearing armor. If he is hit, he will lose corresponding pieces of armor and eventually be reduced to wearing his boxer shorts, with another hit resulting in him losing a life. If Maximo loses all his lives, he can continue by giving Death Coins to the Grim Reaper. However, everytime he loses all his lives, the required cost for a continue increases.<br/><br/>The game is split in 5 major worlds: The Boneyard, The Great Dank, Graveyard of Ships, Realm of Spirit and Castle Maximo. Each world has four stages to beat and a boss  battle. In a world, the player enter on a first mandatory stage and then moves to a portal stage with entrances for other stages in that world. Those portal stages offers options to save, travel to other worlds and buy health and food. Some enemies also appear in portal stages.<br/><br/>The game also has small references to Ghouls n' Ghosts gameplay elements, such as the ability to crush graves and the hero being attacked by spells turning into animals.

This title is a sequel to the first episode, Maximo: Ghosts to Glory.<br/><br/>Maximo's gameplay is characterized by hack and slash combat and platforming, as well as an armour system where damage is reflected by loss of armour. Maximo begins the game with two levels of armour (full armour sans helmet), and can upgrade to three and four (with helmet and golden armour, respectively). Level one has Maximo reduced to boxer shorts.<br/><br/>Another element of gameplay is the Grim transformation, allowing the player to turn into a Grim Reaper for short periods of time, with the souls gathered from the Army of Zin. Grim is invulnerable, powerful, and a touch faster than Maximo. However, the time spent in this form is limited but can be extended through upgrades.<br/><br/>Maximo also receives bonuses from villagers that he saves from enemies in the game, and these rewards are anything from new armour to a word of advice.&quot;<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;Maximo vs. Army of Zin,&quot; available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "78475": {"statistics": {}, "name": "Rhythm Zone", "videogamemode": {"2149": "Single-Player"}, "videogameversion": {"55904": "Windows Downloadable Edition"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic778446.jpg", "videogametheme": {"2455": "Abstract"}, "usersrated": "6", "average": "6.25", "videogamegenre": {"2163": "Rhythm"}, "videogameplatform": {"4977": "Windows"}, "poll": {}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic778446_t.jpg", "description": "From Publisher Website:<br/><br/>Rhythm Zone is the future of real music gaming.

It was developed and published in 1989 by Infogrames (now Atari Europe).<br/>  Plot:<br/>  North &amp; South is an offshoot of the Belgian comic series Les Tuniques Bleues (by Cauvin and Salv&eacute;/Lambil, from Dupuis) which is based on the American Civil War. The player basically acts out the Civil War, choosing to play as either the North or the South. The player may choose to start the game year from 1861 (the year the Civil War erupted) to 1864. Each year has a different array of armies and states that each side starts with. North and South contains a lot of humorous situations and gags.<br/>  Gameplay:<br/>  Taking an extremely simplified board interface, the game features a strategic map of the USA separated into states and territories, where army units are moved around. Railways generate money which in turn generates soldiers. Moving their army units, the player may expand westwards into unoccupied territory. If two antagonistic armies clash, it will result in a battle.<br/>  The battle screen, one of the action elements in the game, is different from the strategic map. Each player starts on opposite sides of the screen and controls an army consisting of infantry, cavalry and cannons. <br/>  In the middle of the battle map, there may be a river or a chasm, in which case a bridge serves as a choke point  where the fighters are likely to meet. The bridge can be destroyed by cannons. One hit will leave a hole in the bridge where units can fall in and die instantly.<br/>  On the states that have a train station, the player must do a short side-scrolling  mission through a fort to capture that state. Here, the player controls a single soldier who runs towards the goal while meeting obstacles such as enemy soldiers, dynamite crates or dogs, with only the help of knives or punches that send enemies towards the sky, On occasions, the player also gets the opportunity to capture an enemy train in a similar manner.&quot;<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, North &amp; South (video game), available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "78477": {"statistics": {}, "name": "Journey to the Center of the Earth (2003)", "videogamemode": {"2149": "Single-Player"}, "videogameversion": {"55908": "US Windows edition"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic781213.jpg", "videogametheme": {"2148": "Fantasy"}, "usersrated": "2", "average": "6.5", "videogamegenre": {"2152": "Adventure"}, "videogameplatform": {"4977": "Windows"}, "poll": {}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic781213_t.jpg", "description": "From the box:<br/><br/>Ariane, a determined photojournalist, falls into what is possibly the scoop of a lifetime through a twist of fate.

PS3 remains at 30 frames per second but still includes many of the animations present on the 360 albeit at a slower speed. There are 115 detailed stadiums, up from 40 in NCAA Football 2007. The game also features a new gameplay engine and branching animation system. This allows for gang tackling, mid-air collisions, sideline catches, and several other brand new animations.<br/><br/>Control Scheme: In keeping with the brand new animations, NCAA Football 08 features a fairly new control scheme from NCAA Football 07. The hit stick has been improved allowing for players to take out the ball carrier's legs by pressing down on the right analog stick. Lead blocking controls from Madden have crossed over onto NCAA Football 08. Offensive hot routes, audibles, and defensive playmaker options are also new additions to NCAA Football 08. The difference between All-American and Heisman is comparable to the difference between night and day because one could go undefeated with a team in All-American mode but move up to Heisman and lose every single game.<br/><br/>Motivation: Next gen versions include a new motivation system. If a player does well, it will boost his motivation making his attributes better. Eventually, if this player is motivated enough he will also motivate other people which will raise their attributes as well.<br/><br/>Recruiting Features: The dynasty mode includes a more in depth recruiting feature allowing the user to make promises and recruiting visits. As in previous games, NCAA football 08 allows the user to export their rosters to Madden 08.<br/><br/>Player Creation: When users create a Campus Legend on Xbox 360 or PS3, a player and high school are created, and the game begins at the state championship playoffs. Performance during the playoffs will determine your caliber. The higher your caliber, the higher your stats will get, and more schools will offer you a scholarship. As in the previous two games, the player will also have the option to walk-on at another school. There are scouts from different schools at every game, the better you play the bigger the schools that are interested. You even get the option when creating your player to choose your top choice so your coach knows who your primary school focus is on. You will no longer control the whole team, but only your player; This has not been changed for PlayStation 2 or Xbox.[2] Campus Legend on PlayStation 2 and Xbox is relatively unchanged; the user still encounters the five drills as before.<br/><br/>Mini Games: There is a new mini game of sorts available for play called Points Pursuit on the current gen versions. It is similar to a regular game except that the scoring is based on yards gained, tackles, interceptions, touchdowns, and other things as well as arcade style gameplay and several random opportunities for double, triple, and quadruple points.<br/><br/>Skills: During regular gameplay, the user can look at his or her My Skills. My Skills keeps track of all the user controlled plays a player has made. For example, if you made an &quot;user pick&quot; with CB #1, then in the My Skills menu it will read CB #1 1 INT. My Skills is only available in the current gen versions.<br/><br/>Highlights: A new feature for the series are My Highlights, which users can use to save game replays and snap shots from previously played games and subsequently upload to EA Sports World GDC 2008 Coverage: Wrapping it Up. My Highlights are exclusive to next gen versions of the game.<br/><br/>Award Tracking: My Shrine is another new addition which allows users to keep track of their trophies and accomplishments.<br/><br/>Trick Plays: Inspired by the 2007 Fiesta Bowl, NCAA Football also introduces more trick plays than before. The hook and ladder (the name of the play on the cover, but dubbed the &quot;circus&quot; by Boise State) and statue of liberty play are both playable on this game in addition to a multitude of other trick plays including a flea flicker and halfback pass.<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;NCAA Football 08,&quot; available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "78484": {"videogame": {"95926": "Atari Anthology"}, "statistics": {}, "name": "3-D Tic-Tac-Toe", "videogamemode": {"2422": "Local Multiplayer"}, "videogameversion": {"139243": "Android (Atari Greatest Hits Atari 2600 Emulation) edition"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic971021.jpg", "videogametheme": {"2455": "Abstract"}, "usersrated": "3", "average": "4", "videogamegenre": {"2158": "Strategy"}, "videogameplatform": {"6063": "Android"}, "poll": {}, "videogamecompilation": {"95926": "Atari Anthology"}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic971021_t.jpg", "description": "The game is similar to the traditional game of tic-tac-toe, but is played on four 4 &times; 4 grids stacked vertically on top of each other; it is basically a computerized version of the board game Qubic using traditional tic-tac-toe notation and layout.

Each level of the game, representing events from Danny's life and inspired by artists such as Tim Burton and M.C.

Studio 33 had previously developed Newmann Haas racing using the original F1 Game engine from Bizarre Creations. Formula One 99 showed that Studio 33 was already experienced in creating a sim-based racing game.<br/><br/>Other innovations included the pit lane speed limiter and a clutch. This game was a considerable and welcome improvement upon Formula 1 98. It may have lacked an &quot;arcade&quot; mode or that extra polish, but Studio 33 clearly concentrated on the most important aspects of the simulation mode, leaving the addition of an arcade mode for Formula One 2000. The AI was suspect, and often cheated the player when pulling out a substantial gap, the AI would then do impossible lap times to catch up and pass. This was also inherent in the Newmann Haas Game which Studio 33 also developed. Another AI tactic was to simply pass through solid walls when trying to overtake the player. This was especially noticeable in Monaco.<br/><br/>During the making of this game, Psygnosis was taken over by Sony Computer Entertainment Europe and became SCE Studio Liverpool.<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;<a target='_blank' href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formula_One_99,&quot' rel='nofollow'>http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formula_One_99,&quot</a>; available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "78500": {"statistics": {}, "name": "World Series Baseball 2K3", "videogamemode": {"2422": "Local Multiplayer"}, "videogameversion": {"55950": "World Series Baseball 2K3 for Xbox"}, "average": "0", "videogametheme": {"2360": "Sports - Baseball"}, "usersrated": "0", "videogamegenre": {"2156": "Simulation"}, "videogameplatform": {"4442": "Xbox"}, "videogamehonor": {"30911": "2003 Spike Best Sports Game of the Year Nominee"}, "poll": {}, "description": "Back of Box<br/><br/>THE MAN WITH THE GOLDEN GLOVE<br/>Scale the wall to take away &quot;would-be&quot; home runs and snare line drives with an all-new jump button.
