Also, at long last, an on-side kick can be made from a regular kick formation, so that the opponent can be caught off guard. Of lesser strategic interest are the graphics of cheerleaders and mascots, as well as detailed graphics for quarterback throws.  That's right, now you can feel the awkwardness of that Philip Rivers heave into coverage.

Johnson launched its great surprise offensive in an attempt to drive out an invading Union force led by Major-General U.S. Grant.  Thus began one of the first and fiercest battles of the Civil War.  And thus begins this remarkable simulation that bears its name - THE BATTLE OF SHILOH.<br/><br/>Historical Detail and Authenticity<br/>On a disc, we have carefully distilled every major historical feature to produce the most authentic and exciting re-creation of that classic conflict.  Every brigade of both Union and Secession armies present during the actual battle is accurately rated for movement, combat strengths, morale, and leadership ability.  The map of the battlefield is displayed on the screen with color Hi-Res graphics.  Terrain consists of hills, fields, forests, rivers, and creeks.  Artillery is provided; a step-reduction system is used to calculate combat results.  And of course, the Battle of Shiloh would be incomplete without including the Union gunboats (the Tyler and Lexington) moored off Pittsburg Landing that played such a crucial role.<br/><br/>Innovations Through State-of-the-Art Programming<br/>So far, all we've mentioned is standard fare for a good wargame.  SSI's innovations through advanced design and programming make for a great game.  Wargames have traditionally used fixed unit strength points.  Here, the computer's ideal administrative ability allows you to fine-tune the combat strengths of each side, allowing for the ultimate in play balance.  Now even a novice strategist can be on equal footing with a battle-hardened veteran!<br/><br/>Another innovation lets you select risk levels and ferocity of an attack (or defense).  Most wargames assume that the units will attack/defend with the same vigor every time.  With THE BATTLE OF SHILOH you have four levels of risk: Daring, Bold, Conservative, and Cautious.  On attack you can go: All-Out, Medium, Probe, or Recon.  On defense, your choices are: Counter-Attack, Hold Position, Withdraw, or Full Retreat.  All this gives each side sixteen different possible strategies!<br/><br/>Great Solitaire with the Computer<br/>This being an SSI game, it goes without saying that a challenging solitaire version is included.  The computer can play either (or both!) sides very competently to give you a tough fight.  As historically detailed and faithful this game is to the original Battle of Shiloh, we've made one significant departure.  We've removed Generals Grant and Johnson and placed you in command of the Union and Confederate armies.  After all, we're looking for more than just a not-too-instant replay of the past.  It is entirely up to your skills as a battle commander to either preserve or change history!<br/><br/>By Tactical Design Group<br/><br/>"}, "107003": {"boardgamedesigner": {"51943": {"name": "Thomas Loefgren"}}, "poll": {}, "name": "War Galley", "playingtime": "20", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": {"2001": "Action Point Allowance System"}, "yearpublished": "2011", "usersrated": "19", "maxplayers": "2", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1079633_t.jpg", "average": "7.63158", "statistics": {}, "boardgamepublisher": {"1001": {"name": "(Web published)"}}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1079633.jpg", "boardgameversion": {"123102": "First edition"}, "maxplaytime": "20", "boardgamecategory": {"1050": {"name": "Ancient"}}, "age": "0", "minplaytime": "20", "description": "War Galley is a game of naval warfare, which can be built and played using only matches.<br/><br/>Players create their galleys out of matchboxes, and give them orders using order matches.

They do so by battling through levels of various castles, trying to gain control of each one. When one player has won three matches, he gains control of the castle and the game progresses to the next castle. Each castle has a different theme, i.e. Lava, Water, etc. The game plays very similarly to Hudson's Bomberman series. Each player begins each match in one of the four corners of the screen. Opponents can only be killed with bombs, though the whip weapon stuns them temporarily. The goal is to trap the other players with bombs, killing them, or to otherwise force them to walk into the path of an exploding bomb. Every few levels, a large dragon is found walking around freely. The dragon gets stronger as levels progress, and in later levels begins breathing fire and attacking the players in other ways. If the dragon is successfully killed, power-ups will appear all around him. Other enemies, such as blobs of slime and walking skeletons, appear as the levels progress. They cannot kill the players, but can significantly stun them in various ways and are a big nuisance. They are easily killed, but become more numerous with each level. Chests fill each level, and can be broken with the whip. Each chest contains a power-up, such as speed shoes, boomerang, extra bombs, larger bombs, and more. The final level pits the winning player (the player who has won the most matches and who controls the most castles) against a witch. After defeating the witch, the game ends.<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;<a target='_blank' href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exvania,&quot' rel='nofollow'>http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exvania,&quot</a>; <br/><br/>"}, "107006": {"statistics": {}, "name": "Fighter Command", "videogamemode": {"2409": "Hotseat"}, "videogameversion": {"123110": "Apple II edition"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1117305.jpg", "videogametheme": {"2514": "Flight"}, "usersrated": "0", "average": "0", "videogamegenre": {"2158": "Strategy"}, "videogameplatform": {"4978": "Apple II"}, "poll": {}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1117305_t.jpg", "description": "From publisher's catalog<br/><br/>FIGHTER COMMAND gives you the thrilling opportunity to rewrite or relive the strategies of one of the greatest aerial battles ever fought: The Battle of Britain.<br/><br/>As the German commander you'll try to lure up R.A.F. fighters by bombing British airfields, radar stations, planes, and major cities.

There are more than a dozen open wheel racing tracks in the world; all of them corresponding to the 1992 Formula One season. Realistic looking advertisements are present where the audience sits complete with near-perfect spelling of sponsors; this mild level of censorship applies because some of the sponsors are tobacco or alcohol-related. The game uses the Super Famicom's Mode 7 to give the track and background perspective.<br/><br/>Players have a limited amount of money to modify their race car before having to qualify and eventually try to win the race. Modifications must be purchased out of the player's pocket like if he were a driver/owner. As with F1 rules at the time, no refueling was possible; pit stops are only used to fix damage on the automobile. Post-race damage penalties will occur if the player finished the race with a damaged vehicle. Even a minor dent can be expensive to a rookie because of the high level of marksmanship by the mechanics. Total damage can and will force the player to retire from the race. In addition to Japan, this game was also released in Europe and North America (in the latter region it was renamed F1 ROC: Race Of Champions).

There was also an attempt to move beyond 'instructional' communication with characters (in which non-player characters are told or asked to complete actions the player does not wish to or is unable to complete) to 'dialogic' communication in which characters could be questioned, challenged and persuaded with evidence.

While technically a Coalition victory, the battle demonstrated the strengths and weaknesses of both sides.<br/><br/>The game system is based on the &quot;Boots&quot; system, which makes command-control the central feature of the design. Each player commands a combat force composed of one or more sub-commands. These sub-commands are maneuvered via picking Command Chits at random; When a Command Chit is picked, that sub-command is then activated. Since players do not know the order in which those Command Chits are picked, battles become chaotic fights as players strive to create and exploit opportunities.<br/><br/>This is a two-player game, with one player commanding Coalition forces, and the other Al Qaeda. Combat in the game is quasi-tactical. Units fire at enemy targets at range. Additionally, the Coalition player has access to various types of fire support, such as airstrikes. However, owing to the chaotic nature of the battle, fire support as well as various reinforcements appear at random. The Al Qaeda player has the advantage of his units being deployed face down so that the Coalition player must use ISR (Intelligence-Surveillance-Reconnaissance) to reveal them.

All players try to find and put together an island with the same number of holes as the sum of the numbers on the dice. They are not allowed to look at the holes - they have to count by touch only. As soon as a player thinks they have the correct island, they grab a pirate ship. There is always one ship fewer than there are players, and the ships are in different colors. The first player who thinks they have an island with the correct number of holes grabs the red ship, the second one the blue ship, and the third one the green ship. When the last ship has been claimed, the round ends and the number of holes on the islands are counted. If the number is correct, the player earns a jewel in the color of the ship.

The main German offensive, dubbed the Sichelschnitt (razor cut), struck through the lightly defended Ardennes Forest and emerged at Sedan. Alarmed at the prospect of a German breakout here, and the collapsing defense at Sedan, the French ordered an immediate counter-attack. General Heinz Guderian, however, had already ordered the bulk of the German panzer formations to breakout from the Sedan bridgehead, and ordered the Gross Deutchland Regiment, with a supporting Kampfgruppe formed from the 8th Panzer Division to take and hold the high ground at Stonne, to guard the German's bridgehead over the Meuse River and expanding flank. For the first, and only, time during the 1940 campaign, Guderian's Panzers ran into the premier French tank, the Char B1-Bis, as the French counter attacked to reduce the Sedan bridgehead.

If they do not match, the cards are turned back over.<br/><br/>The object is to match more pairs of cards than the opposing player. (One point is scored for each matched pair, and the player with the highest score after all cards have been matched wins.) When cards are turned over, it is important to remember where they are for when the matching card is turned up later in the game.<br/><br/>In this online version of memory, there are twelve unique pairs of cards, making 24 cards total.<br/><br/>Source: The Game Website.<br/><br/>"}, "107086": {"statistics": {}, "name": "Pen the Pig", "videogamemode": {"2149": "Single-Player"}, "videogameversion": {"123237": "Browser edition"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1084331.jpg", "videogametheme": {"2455": "Abstract"}, "usersrated": "1", "average": "3", "videogamegenre": {"2402": "Classic Games"}, "videogameplatform": {"5084": "Web Browser"}, "poll": {}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1084331_t.jpg", "description": "The Rules<br/>The game takes place on a grid of dots (of arbitrary size -- in this online version, the grid is eight dots by eight dots).

The two players each make a fist with one hand and hold the other open, palm upward. Together, they tap their fists in their open palms once, twice, and on the third time form one of three items: a rock (by keeping the hand in a fist), a sheet of paper (by holding the hand flat, palm down), or a pair of scissors (by extending the first two fingers and holding them apart).<br/><br/>The winner of that round depends on the items formed. If the same item is formed, it's a tie. If a rock and scissors are formed, the rock wins, because a rock can smash scissors. If scissors and paper are formed, the scissors win, because scissors can cut paper. If paper and a rock are formed, the paper wins, because a sheet of paper can cover a rock. After one round is completed, another is begun. Play continues until one player reaches a predetermined score, or whenever the players' boredom is alleviated. (Often this game is played to pass the time while waiting in line for something, or while on a long road trip [as long as the driver isn't one of the players].)<br/><br/>The traditional means of scoring, not used in recent years, is not to keep any sort of numerical score but rather to allow the winner of each round to punish the loser. The punishment is executed by the loser extending his wrist (the same wrist must be used throughout the course of the game), face up, to the winner. The winner will hold the loser's hand steady with one hand (not tightly or forcibly) and use the first two fingers (only!) of the other hand to slap the loser's wrist. Wetting the two fingers just slightly is permissible; this provides a somewhat sharper sting. It's also better to hold the two fingers loosely rather than stiffly so that they slap instead of hit. The winner only gets one shot; if the slap is bungled, the loser is off the hook.<br/><br/>Playing Rock, Paper, Scissors with this traditional scoring scheme can make for the most satisfying games, particularly if you play long enough to get each other's wrists good and red. However, this version of the game should only be played by consenting adults, and RinkWorks may not be held responsible for anyone getting hurt playing the game this way.<br/><br/>In this online version of the game, there is no wrist slapping; numerical scores are kept.<br/><br/>Source: The Game Website.<br/><br/>"}, "107093": {"statistics": {}, "name": "Rotator", "videogamemode": {"2149": "Single-Player"}, "videogameversion": {"123245": "Browser edition"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1084334.jpg", "videogametheme": {"2455": "Abstract"}, "usersrated": "1", "average": "3", "videogamegenre": {"2165": "Puzzle"}, "videogameplatform": {"5084": "Web Browser"}, "poll": {}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1084334_t.jpg", "description": "A 3x3 grid of tiles is manipulated by rotating 2x2 squares within it.

Jennings founded VisiCorp together with Dan Fylstra, and the new company published Microchess to the growing microcomputer market.

It was produced by DynaMicro for the Tandy (RadioShack) TRS-80 Color Computer.<br/><br/>Dungeons of Daggorath was one of the first games that attempted to portray three-dimensional space in a real-time environment, using angled lines to give the illusion of depth. Daggorath incorporated a diverse set of features for its time, including different kinds of monsters, complex mazes, different levels of visibility, and the use of different objects and weapons.<br/><br/>The game was written by Douglas J. Morgan and Keith S. Kiyohara, with sounds by Phil Landmeier, in 1980-81. It was released as a ROMpak cartridge for the Color Computer, which limited the size of the code to eight kilobytes. Despite this, the game features a multi-level maze and uses sound effects to provide important clues to the locations of monsters.<br/><br/>Gameplay<br/><br/>The player moves around a dungeon, issuing commands by means of typing - for example, typing &quot;GET LEFT SHIELD&quot; or &quot;USE RIGHT TORCH&quot; (or abbreviations such as &quot;G L SH&quot; and &quot;U R T&quot;), gathering strength and ever more powerful weapons as the game progresses. Various creatures appear, and can often be heard when they are nearby but not visible. The object of the game is to defeat the second of two wizards, who is on the fifth and last level of the dungeon.<br/><br/>A unique feature of the game is a heartbeat which rises as the player moves and takes actions within the virtual environment. The heartbeat corresponds to the &quot;health&quot; indicator used in other games; the higher the heart rate, the more vulnerable the player is to attack. The player can faint from overexertion, in which case there is the risk of being attacked while defenseless. This heartbeat system was used instead of numerical statistics such as hit points or vitality, and was inspired by arcade games, specifically 1978's Space Invaders where a heartbeat-like sound gradually increases pace as enemies advance towards the player.<br/><br/>Legacy<br/><br/>After Dungeons of Daggorath became one of the most popular Color Computer games, Tandy produced a sequel, Castle of Tharoggad, which was made without the participation of the Daggorath programming team. It did not sell well, and received poor reviews from fans of the original.<br/><br/>Despite the dated graphics and sound, Dungeons of Daggorath game still enjoys a cult following in the retrogaming community for its challenging gameplay, and has been ported to Microsoft Windows XP and Linux via the SDL graphic and sound libraries.<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;Dungeons of Daggorath&quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "107122": {"statistics": {}, "name": "Keyboard Mayhem", "videogamemode": {"2149": "Single-Player"}, "videogameversion": {"123295": "Web browser edition"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1154277.jpg", "videogametheme": {"2564": "Words"}, "usersrated": "0", "average": "0", "videogamegenre": {"2147": "Action"}, "videogameplatform": {"5084": "Web Browser"}, "poll": {}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1154277_t.jpg", "description": "Put your touch typing skills to the ultimate test.

Maybe the nurse or the doctor with the hypodermic needle (if he really is a doctor) can be persuaded to help you.<br/><br/>Their ability to help also changes each time you load the game. Depending on the active escape route, you will either be able to escape without help from anyone, or you will need help from one or more of the people you meet. Some of the inhabitants of Bedlam are neither friendly nor cooperative. They do not get along with other inmates and some will try to stop you from leaving.<br/><br/>There are times during the game when you might be in serious danger. One particular resident of Bedlam can create problems, which only a well-timed [PLUGH] can cure. You must choose your allies wisely from among the people you meet.<br/><br/>Good Luck. I really hope you make it. Who knows? You may even be lucky the first couple of times and get out easily. You may not be quite so lucky the next time you try.<br/><br/>"}, "107130": {"statistics": {}, "name": "Canaan Online", "videogamemode": {"2327": "Massively Multiplayer"}, "videogameversion": {"123312": "Browser edition"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1084350.jpg", "videogametheme": {"2148": "Fantasy"}, "usersrated": "0", "average": "0", "videogamegenre": {"2162": "MMO"}, "videogameplatform": {"4977": "Windows"}, "poll": {}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1084350_t.jpg", "description": "God created many worlds in his pocket.

Enroute to a secret command center on the planet Harris 7, Princess Leya's ship was attacked by Doom. She is now being held prisoner on one of his battle cruisers. It is a sorry day indeed!<br/><br/>The capture holds extra prizes for Doom and his men: onboard Princess Leya's ship is the entire treasury of her Freedom Fighting Force in a chest containing Melidium Crystals, the currency used in this galaxy. The Princess is also wearing a necklace made of shinestones. Encoded in one of the stones is the location and strength of her Freedom Fighting Force. Hopefully, Doom has not yet discovered the secret of the necklace.<br/><br/>I, your computer, am your puppet. I'm hidden aboard the Princess's ship. It is possibly, although very difficult, that we may be able to save the day by rescuing Princess Leya, her necklace, and the treasury. But even if we don't, anything we can do to foil General Doom's plans may help win a victory for peace in the galaxy.<br/><br/>We must be very careful of guards who are all over the ship.

European Air War is the sequel to 1942: The Pacific Air War by Microprose. The stock standard version simulates the Battle of Britain, and the Allied Air offensives in Western Europe during the Second World War in 1943-45. The game remains popular among flight sim enthusiasts and has spawned hundreds of fan modifications.<br/><br/>European Air War consists several modes; a Quick Start option, which allows immediate undefined play; a Single Mission option, which allows selection of aircraft and mission type, and a campaign mode called Pilot Career.<br/><br/>The Pilot Career mode, allows the user to take the role of a pilot in the RAF, Luftwaffe or USAAF and play in any of three time eras, the Battle of Britain in 1940, the Allied Air offensives in 1943, and the Air offensives before and after D-Day until the end of the war in 1944-45.<br/><br/>During a Pilot Career player actions will directly affect the progress of the war, including delaying or bringing forward the invasion of Europe. Players may also rise up the ranks, starting as a non-commissioned officer to full officer commanding a fighter squadron (or staffel) and assuming responsibility for the men and machines under the player's command. As a squadron commander a player can select the rosters and weapons loadouts for use in missions, selecting between disposable fuel tanks, rockets, or bombs to assist in completing assigned missions.<br/><br/>The AI in European Air War is highly flexible, with several difficulty settings that can be altered by the user to ensure the game remains challenging for a long period of time. AI pilots within the player's squadron can be controlled by the user in Quick Start and Single Mission options, and gradually become available as the player receives promotions within their squadron in a Pilot Career.<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;European Air War&quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "107177": {"statistics": {}, "name": "Legend of Starfy", "videogamemode": {"2149": "Single-Player"}, "videogameversion": {"123419": "Japanese Game Boy Advance edition"}, "average": "0", "videogameseries": {"6279": "Desnsetsu no Starfy"}, "videogametheme": {"2337": "Cute Fantasy"}, "usersrated": "0", "videogamegenre": {"2346": "Scrolling"}, "videogameplatform": {"4423": "Game Boy Advance"}, "poll": {}, "description": "Densetsu no Stafy (\u4f1d\u8aac\u306e\u30b9\u30bf\u30d5\u30a3\u30fc Densetsu no Sutaf\u012b?) is a platform video game developed by TOSE and published by Nintendo for the Nintendo Game Boy Advance in Japan. It is the first game in the The Legendary Starfy series<br/>Plot<br/><br/>In the beginning, the protagonist Stafy, known as Starfy in Western regions, was moving things around his home, Pufftop Palace, until he tripped and dropped some things he was moving. One of them fell into the ocean, which was the Magic Jar, an object that seals the antagonist of the game known as Ogura. Meanwhile, a very severe thunderstorm with two tornadoes shook Starfy out of his home into the ocean. Later, Old Man Lobber encountered Starfy, and told him about the Magic Jar and Ogura, while he helped Starfy get back home, by making him do some swimming lessons, as well as giving directions. While Starfy was heading back home, he encountered some people he didn't know before, such as Moe the clam, and decided to help them with their problems, like finding their missing items, defeating enemies, and so on, until Starfy and his friends fought and brought back Ogura into the Magic Jar to restore peace.<br/><br/>Gameplay<br/><br/>Starfy himself can run, jump, and attack via spinning; he also gains access to various transportation objects and animal familiars as the games progress. The game usually consists of multiple stages or worlds, with each stage split up into four sub-stages. Boss characters hide at the end of each world's final sub-stage. Most of the other sub-stages' goals are centered around retrieving a lost or stolen item for another character. The main task is to meet characters and find their missing items. There are many items to collect and many enemies to defeat. Players can move Starfy on land by running and jumping, but when Starfy is in watery areas, they can move him much more freely, make him push obstacles, and so on. The game also includes minigames, some of which are similar to Atari's Breakout series.<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;Legend of Starfy&quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "107178": {"poll": {}, "name": "Phone Frenzy", "playingtime": "0", "minplayers": "2", "yearpublished": "0", "usersrated": "2", "maxplayers": "8", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1179684_t.jpg", "average": "6", "statistics": {}, "boardgamepublisher": {"601": {"name": "Buffalo Games"}}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1179684.jpg", "boardgameversion": {"123420": "First edition"}, "maxplaytime": "0", "boardgamecategory": {"1030": {"name": "Party Game"}}, "age": "14", "minplaytime": "0", "description": "Game Description: Phone Frenzy is the calling, texting, picture message party game where you use your cell phones to call and text friends, and complete hilarious challenges in four categories.

The game has backgrounds that appear to be a mixture of texture-mapped and hand-drawn graphics. The game is played mostly from the third-person perspective, and game characters are cyberpuppets. Background music and sound effects are unobtrusive. The navigation interface uses left-click to examine an object, right-click to use, interact with or combine objects in the game or in inventory. Hotspots are indicated with on-screen text. Many of the game's plot elements rely on finding a single object. For this amount of pixel hunting, a large-screen monitor is recommended. An inventory bar is accessible at the bottom of the screen, and the Escape key is used for the game control menu. The Escape key can also be used to skip video and dialog sequences, and right-clicking on screen exits avoids waiting for character walking. Useful &quot;Go to...&quot; text indicates previously-unexplored exits. A handy instant-navigation feature is also available for part of the game.<br/><br/>The game is actually somewhat non-linear since some tasks can be solved in a different order, with the gameplay periodically simplified by one-way plot elements. There are only twelve saved-game slots, which may be too few for some players. However, multiple sets of saved games can be retained by manually copying SAVEGAME.* files from the game installation directory. An audible indication of the main character's shrug is needed so you have a better idea when nothing can be done with an inventory item or hotspot. There are few inventory red herrings since most of the stuff gets used at some point or other.

German forces pushed out of the Low Vosges forests to capture Wingen-sur-Moder, situated along the road net needed for Operation Nordwind. The attacking enemy forces struck Wingen at the first light of day and rapidly moved through the village. In the confusion that followed, Company A lost communications with Companies B and C, and for a time the Company was without radio contact with the Battalion CP in the Kirchberg. Within the company perimeter confusion made it difficult for the platoon leaders and platoon sergeants to get their men organized. Nearly every squad was on its own. Their reaction to the sudden attack was left to the judgment of the individual squad leaders. By 0900 hours the Germans had captured and occupied the town, the high ground to the northeast of town, and established a bridgehead on the south bank of the Moder River. They immediately went about establishing a perimeter defense around the village then prepared to continue their attack southward toward Saverne.<br/><br/>During the first days of January 1945 German forces pushed out of the Low Vosges forests to capture the towns that lay along the snow-covered route of attack. One of these towns was Wingen, along the Moder River. American units there were initially caught by surprise as battle-hardened troopers from the 6th SS Mountain Division stormed in and captured the town. American reinforcements were soon pouring in from the west and the south and despite bitter fighting, by January 5th the German offensive had been brought to a standstill. Lacking exits from the Vosges, planned armored reserves stood idle and Operation Nordwind ended in failure. Wingen sits in a small valley along the Moder River between Bitche to the north and Saverne to the south.

The first player of team white announces the general question for the first player of team black to answer. Before the specific questions are read, a die is thrown to determine which of the two teams (the active player's own team or the opponents) has to guess how many correct answers the active player will be able to give. The number of points gained by the active player's team is determined by both the number of correct answers and by how close the team's guess were. (The system for point allocation is a bit complicated; the game comes with a cardboard dial for determining the number of points.)

The Italian units, particularly the Savoia Grenadiers, fought so well the Commonwealth forces had to conduct three assaults to break their position. Indeed, the Savoia Grenadiers were never dislodged from their hilltop position, and were only compelled to surrender after being surrounded an after the other Italian positions had fallen. In spite of their ultimate defeat, it&rsquo;s regarded as one of the Italian Army&rsquo;s most impressive showings during the entire war.<br/><br/>Keren includes one counter sheet (228 counters) and one map of the Keren area of Eritrea (each hex represents about 220 yards), portraying the Dongolaas Gorge and the heights on both sides, dominating the area south of Keren. The system&rsquo;s unique feature is the ability of infantry units to self-reduce to dispatch men as supply-runners, as was necessary for both sides historically. Fighting atop the difficult hills will give players a sense of why the Italians were so difficult to dislodge, as well as the importance of artillery and air support, and the limitation on the usefulness of tanks.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "1", "boardgameversion": {"123841": "World at War magazine edition"}, "age": "0", "name": "Keren", "playingtime": "0", "boardgamemechanic": {"2026": "Hex-and-Counter"}, "average": "5.86842", "usersrated": "19", "boardgamefamily": {"3244": "Magazine: World at War"}}, "107403": {"statistics": {}, "name": "Chron X", "videogamemode": {"2310": "Network Multiplayer"}, "videogameversion": {"123842": "Windows Downloadable edition"}, "average": "7", "videogametheme": {"2281": "Cyberpunk"}, "usersrated": "1", "videogamegenre": {"2158": "Strategy"}, "videogameplatform": {"4977": "Windows"}, "poll": {}, "description": "Chron X is a turn-based strategy game in which you battle your opponent over the Internet with an arsenal of agents, weapons, programs, and resources chosen from your deck of virtual cards.

You already know the savage horror and the joyous exultation of Rage. You know the tragedy of a warrior-people who turned on their own, and the one last hope that still burns as long as their hearts possess the will to fight. You know the glory of a struggle against a god of Entropy and Corruption, and the triumph of delivering just one small mortal soul. You know the pain of a world and the beauty of the spirit.<br/><br/>This book is for you. Werewolf: The Apocalypse - 20th Anniversary Edition. The Prophecy of Phoenix will be fulfilled.<br/><br/><br/>The Nature of the Beast<br/><br/>Twenty years ago, a game about werewolves hit the shelves like a hammer. Nobody knew quite what to expect. Vampire: The Masquerade had alluded to werewolves - we knew they were out there, that they were terrifyingly strong, and that they hated vampires. And of course, we knew what to expect from werewolf movies: creatures that went mad by the light of the full moon. But there had to be more to it than that, right?<br/><br/>And there was. There was so much more.<br/><br/>Where the vampires gathered in clans, the werewolves had tribes. They were born of humans or wolves, or neither. And although they were every inch the physically powerful, terrifying monsters we'd expected, they were also incredibly spiritual. Werewolf opened up an entirely new facet of the World of Darkness: the spirit world. They still hated vampires, but they were defined by an entirely new struggle, a battle against cosmic horror that incorporated a commentary on the horrible things humans do to one another and the world we live on. We even learned a new name for these creatures - the Garou.<br/><br/>Twenty years have passed since Werewolf: The Apocalypse came clawing its way into the world. To this day, it's still hard to find many games like it. Werewolf is a game with a laser-precise focus, mixed with and almost contradicted by a remarkable m&eacute;lange of components. It can keep a narrow, precise course of the story of a pack or sept's war against the Wyrm, or it can branch out into stories of politics, tragedy, spirituality, history, ecology - the entirety of human experience and far, far beyond. No matter what you're interested in as a Storyteller or a player, it can be relevant to the struggle of the Garou.<br/><br/><br/>How to Use This Book<br/><br/>While this book doesn't include everything from the game line's entire run, it is intended to be close enough to comprehensive that it covers all areas of the game at least a little bit. The organization is as follows:<br/><br/>Chapter One: A World of Darkness describes the overall setting as well as the basics of the Garou Nation and their struggle.<br/><br/>Chapter Two: The Garou elaborates on the breeds, auspices and tribes that define what it is to be a werewolf.<br/><br/>Chapter Three: Character and Traits details character creation and the Traits that define a werewolf character.<br/><br/>Chapter Four: Gifts, Rites, and Fetishes covers the many spiritual powers that give the Garou a potent edge.<br/><br/>Chapter Five: Rules provides the basic resolution systems for the game.<br/><br/>Chapter Six: Systems and Drama elaborates on those basics, providing more detailed subsystems to handle more complicated elements of gameplay such as combat.<br/><br/>Chapter Seven: The Spirit World explores the Umbra, the hidden side of the world.<br/><br/>Chapter Eight: Storytelling is a collection of advice and techniques for Storytellers, useful in preparing and running engaging chronicles in the world of Werewolf.<br/><br/>Chapter Nine: Allies details those that are on the same side of the war as the Garou, such as spirits, Kinfolk, and the other Changing Breeds. It also provides a look at the Lost Tribes.<br/><br/>Conversely, Chapter Ten: Enemies is a rogue's gallery of the worst enemies the Garou face, servants of the Wyrm, Weaver, and beyond.<br/><br/>Finally, the Appendix adds miscellaneous optional rules and details of sub-factions such as tribal camps.<br/><br/>"}, "107418": {"rpgitemversion": {"319272": "French PDF version"}, "poll": {}, "name": "The Hunters Hunted II (V20)", "rpgproducer": {"13940": "Justin Achilli"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1669752.png", "usersrated": "2", "rpgsetting": {"2591": "World of Darkness (cWoD Modern)"}, "average": "8", "statistics": {}, "rpggenre": {"441": "Horror (Supernatural)"}, "rpg": {"421": "Vampire: The Masquerade"}, "rpgcategory": {"2108": "Sourcebook (rules/options to enhance play)"}, "rpgseries": {"27381": "Vampire: The Masquerade 20th Anniversary Edition"}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1669752_t.png", "description": "From the back of the book:<br/><br/>Most mortals turn away from the darkness that preys upon them, going about their lives in despair of the Damned and the evils they visit upon the world.

Second, the players want to complete the unfinished church La Sagrada Familia. Towards this end, each player gets a number of jigsaw puzzle pieces which they have to buy during the game. The required money is earned by trading in language cards and asset cards. The game ends when one player has bought and laid out all their puzzle pieces and also manages to correctly solve five of the language cards he/she has collected during the game.<br/><br/>The game mechanics in more detail<br/><br/>A die determines the players' movement on the game board. The board contains the following types of spaces:<br/>Event spaces and special spaces: The player draws a card from the corresponding stack. Event cards must be played immediately, special cards can be kept until needed.<br/>Attraction spaces: The player receives an asset card of the corresponding tourist attraction. Different attractions have cards worth different amounts of money.<br/>Language spaces: The player gets a language card, which they have to learn during the game. Each language card contains two different words or phrases in German and Spanish.<br/>Metro spaces can be used either as a shortcut to a different metro space, or as an event, special or language space (player's choice).<br/>Bank spaces: On a bank space, the player can exchange asset and language cards for money. To do so, they must have learned the language cards. During an exchange attempt, one asset card and two language cards are submitted. The German words are read out, and if the active player correctly translates them to Spanish, he/she receives the amount of money specified on the asset card. If they fail, they get back their cards and can try again later.<br/>Casa de Pledras spaces: The player can pay for one of his puzzle pieces to be added to the puzzle that is laid out on the table (all players contribute to one puzzle).<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": {"123951": "First edition"}, "name": "Sagrada", "playingtime": "60", "boardgamemechanic": {"2035": "Roll / Spin and Move"}, "average": "6.9", "usersrated": "2", "age": "0"}, "107449": {"statistics": {}, "name": "Gremlins", "videogamemode": {"2409": "Hotseat"}, "videogameversion": {"123952": "US Atari 2600 edition"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1619599.png", "videogametheme": {"2148": "Fantasy"}, "videogamefranchise": {"7397": "Gremlins"}, "usersrated": "1", "average": "6", "videogamegenre": {"2147": "Action"}, "videogameplatform": {"4416": "Atari 2600"}, "videogamehonor": {"29172": "1985 Golden Joystick Best Adventure Game of the Year Nominee"}, "poll": {}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1619599_t.png", "description": "User Summary<br/><br/>You are Billy and your task is to catch the jumping Mogwai before they get to the hamburgers.

In a round, each player starts with 8-10 topping cards in hand; thus, each round consists of 8-10 tricks. The lead player in a trick plays one topping card to the table, then each player follows, with no requirement to follow suit. The highest card in the suit led wins the trick, and the person who played that card collects the topping cards one-by-one, placing those cards in separate stacks by topping type on the table in front of him, with the most recently played (and collected) cards on top.<br/><br/>At the end of the round, each player decides whether to score for one of his order cards in hand. For each topping shown on the order card, the player scores only the topmost topping card, scoring zero points if that topping is missing. The player then discards the order card.<br/><br/>The game ends after five rounds or at the end of a round in which at least one player has scored his third order card. The player with the most points wins.<br/><br/>"}, "107467": {"statistics": {}, "name": "Armageddon", "videogamemode": {"2149": "Single-Player"}, "videogameversion": {"123980": "UK ZX Spectrum edition"}, "average": "0", "videogametheme": {"2264": "Science Fiction"}, "usersrated": "0", "videogamegenre": {"2314": "Arcade"}, "videogameplatform": {"4950": "ZX Spectrum"}, "poll": {}, "description": "User Summary<br/><br/>In this missile defense style game you have a limited number of missiles with which you have to protect six cities from incoming missiles.

The game was based on the hit TV show Happy Days and the slogan was &quot;TV's hottest name, Your hottest game.&quot; The game itself was simply a rebranded variant of Sega's earlier 1976 game Moto-Cross in a customized arcade cabinet.<br/><br/>Moto-Cross / Fonz was an early black-and-white motorbike racing game, most notable for introducing an early three-dimensional third-person perspective. Both versions of the game displayed a constantly-changing forward-scrolling road and the player's bike in a third-person perspective where objects nearer to the player are larger than those nearer to the horizon, and the aim was to steer the vehicle across the road, racing against the clock, while avoiding any on-coming motorcycles or driving off the road. The game also introduced the use of haptic feedback, which caused the motorcycle handlebars to vibrate during a collision with another vehicle.<br/><br/>The general premise was the player controlled the Fonz on a motorcycle with handlebars on the cabinet where the motorcycle would be.<br/><br/>The player had to go as fast as possible without skidding off the road or colliding with other racing bikes on the screen. Turn the handlebars, and the bike would corner and bank. Twist the handle throttle open, and it would accelerate. When a collision with another bike occurs, the handlebars vibrate and the screen flashes a reverse image. To increase the challenge, the size of the bike can be regulated by the operator (usually the person that owned the arcade).  Game time is adjustable from 45 to 100 seconds.<br/><br/>Sega was allowed to rebrand their game as Fonz because its American branch at the time was owned by Charles Bluhdorn's Gulf+Western Company and they were thus legally permitted to access Paramount Television's material without any written consent (because the two were owned by the same parent company during that era). Modeling the first release of the Fonz arcade game was a female Sega staff member wearing a yellow top and white pair of short pants and standing in front of the other arcade machines in the background (presumably made by Sega).<br/><br/>Since the arcade game was released in Happy Days' second season, it didn't have to rely on the Fonz's later accomplishments like jumping the shark or crossing over into the universes of either Mork &amp; Mindy or Laverne &amp; Shirley. No other aspects of the Fonz were mentioned in the video game except his motorcycling, his motorcycling clothes, and Fonz himself. Sega's Fonz was likely the first game based on a TV character.<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;Fonz (arcade)&quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "107485": {"statistics": {}, "name": "Battle Grand Prix", "videogamemode": {"2422": "Local Multiplayer"}, "videogameversion": {"124037": "JP Super Famicom edition"}, "average": "0", "videogametheme": {"2456": "Driving"}, "usersrated": "0", "videogamegenre": {"2154": "Racing"}, "videogameplatform": {"4440": "SNES"}, "poll": {}, "description": "Battle Grand Prix (\u30d0\u30c8\u30eb\u30b0\u30e9\u30f3\u30d7\u30ea, &quot;Battle Grand Prix&quot;) is a Formula One racing video game in which one or two players can pit themselves in three Grand Prix races.

As a Space Ship Commander, players must seek out and destroy three kinds of Firebirds in three missions. The names of the Firebirds are Gulls, Eagles and the Mighty Emperor (or simply &quot;Emperor&quot;). The Emperor is destroyed by four hits, the Eagle with two hits and the Gull with one hit. The Eagles drop bombs that are aimed at sabotaging the ship controlled by players. When hit, the bomb scatters deadly shrapnel. To avoid this from happening, players must destroy the bomb from directly beneath it before it crashes. Besides shooting missiles, the main ship also uses the warp mode that can only be used once in every level to escape impending danger and/or to strike out at a flock of birds. When activated, the ship thrusts into space with a protective shield that deflects enemy fire and makes the ship invincible.
