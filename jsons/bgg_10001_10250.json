Players take turns asking each other for cards matching the ones in their hands, each card being named after a particular fish (or fish-related being, such as Atlantean Priests or Mermaids). When a player manages to get a pair, they place it face-up on the table in front of them, just like in Go Fish. Once the cards hit the table, the Magic: the Gathering aspects come into play, as most of the fish have unique powers that can be used to aid you or annoy your opponents. There are also unique cards (with names like &quot;Flying Dutchman&quot; and &quot;Offshore Oil Rig&quot;), which have more esoteric powers and move from player to player as they get used. When one player runs out of cards in their hand, everyone scores a point for each pair they possess, and a new hand is dealt until every player has dealt once, at which point the final scores are tallied and a winner is declared. (Game time is thus dependant on number of players -- my guess of 90 minutes is a rough estimate of a 6-player game, which may not be at all accurate.)<br/><br/>In many ways, Leviathan epitomizes the &quot;beer-and-pretzels&quot; game -- in fact, it was designed in a coffee shop, out of a need for something to do while sitting in a coffee shop. The rules encourage a light (&quot;jovially rude&quot;) atmosphere, and the writing style generally reflects this, although careful attention has been paid to the way the various cards interact, and to fix any possible contradictions or loopholes. (And the rule set has been edited to remove unnecessary rudeness in the author's writing style, although -- shh! -- an &quot;impolite&quot; version of the rules is rumored to exist, somewhere...)<br/><br/>Players are encouraged to devise new card powers and game variations, and as a bonus for players south of the equator, a special &quot;Southern Hemisphere&quot; option is given, which explains the way the Coriolis Effect changes the order of play.<br/><br/>"}, "10033": {"boardgamedesigner": {"3": {"name": "(Uncredited)"}}, "poll": {}, "name": "Monopoly: Las Vegas", "playingtime": "120", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": {"2012": "Auction/Bidding"}, "yearpublished": "2000", "usersrated": "45", "boardgamefamily": {"18238": "Cities: Las Vegas (Nevada, USA)"}, "maxplayers": "6", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic41878_t.jpg", "average": "5.58889", "statistics": {}, "boardgamepublisher": {"28": {"name": "Parker Brothers"}}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic41878.jpg", "boardgameversion": {"121943": "USAopoly Edition"}, "maxplaytime": "120", "boardgamecategory": {"1021": {"name": "Economic"}}, "age": "8", "minplaytime": "120", "description": "A monopoly (from Greek monos &mu;\u03cc&nu;&omicron;&sigmaf; (alone or single) + polein &pi;&omega;&lambda;&epsilon;\u1fd6&nu; (to sell)) exists when a specific person or enterprise is the only supplier of a particular commodity.<br/><br/>Monopoly is a roll-and-move game where players move around the game board buying or trading properties, developing their properties with houses and hotels.

The person who gives the correct response acts as quizmaster for the following question.<br/><br/>Round two: After hearing a list of items of a given category, the players must recall item from the list. Players alternate taking turns until one fails to call out a yet unnamed item.

The game is played in three steps.<br/>- look at a drawing at possible solutions<br/>- unscramble letters to form a word<br/>- listen to clues to find words that form a final clue<br/><br/>The first player which has solved three mysteries wins the game.<br/><br/>"}, "10152": {"boardgamedesigner": {"6430": {"name": "Ralph Baer"}}, "poll": {}, "name": "Super Simon", "playingtime": "10", "minplayers": "1", "boardgamemechanic": {"2023": "Co-operative Play"}, "yearpublished": "1979", "usersrated": "25", "boardgamefamily": {"5607": "3D Games"}, "maxplayers": "4", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic693804_t.jpg", "average": "5.112", "statistics": {}, "boardgamepublisher": {"2721": {"name": "Kod Kod"}}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic693804.jpg", "boardgameversion": {"64777": "English First Edition"}, "maxplaytime": "10", "boardgamecategory": {"1072": {"name": "Electronic"}}, "age": "7", "minplaytime": "10", "description": "Super Simon - Play head to head, individually or as a team.

The map depicts the area of operations, the Ardennes area at the borders of Germany, France, Belgium, and Luxemberg. Prominent features like roads, rivers and cities are depicted. A hexagonal grid is superimposed over the map to regulate game play. Each hexagon is 2 miles across, unit size is brigade and regiments. Each turn represents 12 hours of real time.<br/><br/>Game features include morale, prominent leaders, blitzkrieg tactics, German army boundaries, initial surprise, Allied air power and much more.<br/><br/>This is an entirely new version of the latest, or 4th edition, of this game. It has been totally revamped and owners of the previous editions may wish to acquire a copy of this one with all the bells &amp; whistles it contains.<br/><br/>First off, they've mounted the game-mapboard-(30&quot; by 46&quot;) to avoid the problems with paper mapsheets(which also increases the cost of doing such). They have improved &amp; updated the graphics for everything all around, and increased the size of the game counters to 5/8&quot;, while that's been factored into the cost as well. Then, they greatly enhanced the current Rulesbook (4th edition) with new scenarios, an additional variant, rules changes &amp; clarifications, included a Players Handbook, updated the designer's notes, and much more! There are full COLOR player aid cards, Random Events are introduced, they've updated the cartography (the map graphics), provided an updated Order of Battle, the hexes have been enlarged to contain the larger game counters, and variant counters are also introduced.<br/><br/>For those of you with distinguishing tastes in their choice of wargames, this has also been acclaimed by the noted designer and expert on the subject, Danny S. Parker. You'll have to go to the l2designgroup.com website to see this as words can't do it justice.

If they spun a hit, they would have to answer the question on the back of the cards to see if they got the hit.  As with real baseball, there are three outs to an inning, and 9 innings.

The fox player tries to remove all of the geese from the board by jumping them.  The geese player tries to prevent this from happening by pinning down the fox so that it cannot move.<br/><br/>The game of Solitaire can be played on a Fox &amp; Geese board, and some sets include additional markings for playing Siege.<br/><br/>There are some claims that Fox and Geese is related to an earlier game called Halatafl, but there is as yet no concrete definition of what exactly this game was or how it was played.  There are also several contemporary games using the Halatafl name, at least one of which is played on a similar board to Fox and Geese but with differing rules.<br/><br/><a target='_blank' href='https://av.getinfo.de/media/11310?2' rel='nofollow'>https://av.getinfo.de/media/11310?2</a> ( CC Attribution - NonCommercial - NoDerivatives 3.0 )<br/><a target='_blank' href='http://vimeo.com/51819749' rel='nofollow'>http://vimeo.com/51819749</a><br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": {"210246": "ABRA German Wooden Edition"}, "average": "4.78733", "name": "Fox and Geese", "playingtime": "20", "boardgamemechanic": {"2676": "Grid Movement"}, "age": "8", "usersrated": "217", "boardgamesubdomain": {"4666": "Abstract Games"}, "boardgamefamily": {"7544": "Animals: Foxes"}}, "10214": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic123726.jpg", "poll": {}, "boardgamedesigner": {"337": {"name": "Joseph Miranda"}}, "statistics": {}, "yearpublished": "1995", "maxplayers": "2", "boardgameartist": {"1256": "David McElhannon"}, "boardgamepublisher": {"102": {"name": "Decision Games (I)"}}, "maxplaytime": "180", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic123726_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "180", "boardgamecategory": {"1035": {"name": "Medieval"}}, "description": "Strategy &amp; Tactics magazine #177.<br/><br/>The game recreates the wars fought between England and France between 1337 and 1453.
