Maneuver. Conquer.<br/><br/>The Duke is a dynamic, tile-based strategy game with an old-world, feudal theme, high-quality wooden playing pieces, and an innovative game mechanism in its double-sided tiles. Each side represents a different posture &ndash; often considered to be defensive or offensive &ndash; and demonstrates exactly what the piece can do within the turn. At the end of a move (or after the use of a special ability), the tile is flipped to its other side, displaying a new offensive or defensive posture.<br/><br/>Each posture conveys different options for maneuver and attack. The full circle is a standard Move, the hollow circle the Jump, the arrow provides for the Slide, the star a special Strike ability and so on. Each turn a player may select any tile to maneuver, attempting to defend his own troops while positioning himself to capture his opponent's tiles. If you end your movement in a square occupied by an opponent's tile, you capture that tile. Capture your opponent's Duke to win!<br/><br/>Players start the game by placing their Duke in one of the two middle squares on their side of the game board. Two Footman are then placed next to the Duke. Each turn a player may choose to either move a single tile or randomly draw a new tile from the bag. With fifteen different Troop Tiles, all double-sided, and nineteen total pieces for each player (plus special optional tiles), the variety of game play is limitless.<br/><br/>Beyond the endless variety of the basic game, Terrain Tiles introduce a variety of game play options, altering the game board. These rules also include several alternate objectives, such as the challenging Dark Rider game which pits five Pikeman against a lone Knight.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": {"168770": "English first edition"}, "boardgameintegration": {"170901": "Jarl: The Vikings Tile-Laying Game"}, "average": "7.55645", "name": "The Duke", "playingtime": "30", "boardgamemechanic": {"2676": "Grid Movement"}, "age": "13", "boardgameexpansion": {}, "usersrated": "2786", "boardgamesubdomain": {"4666": "Abstract Games"}, "boardgamefamily": {"8374": "Crowdfunding: Kickstarter"}}, "36236": {"boardgamedesigner": {"10532": {"name": "Julie Haehn"}}, "poll": {}, "name": "Living Labyrinth", "playingtime": "20", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": {"2040": "Hand Management"}, "yearpublished": "2008", "usersrated": "90", "maxplayers": "4", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic356399_t.jpg", "average": "5.44444", "statistics": {}, "boardgamepublisher": {"8309": {"name": "Bucephalus Games"}}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic356399.jpg", "boardgameversion": {"42620": "English first edition"}, "maxplaytime": "20", "boardgamecategory": {"1059": {"name": "Maze"}}, "age": "8", "minplaytime": "20", "description": "Living Labyrinth is a light-hearted race through an ever-changing maze of garden tiles.

Now, the latest in a long line of champions, Seve Ballesteros, winner of the 1984 Open, here at St. Andrews, plays The Old Course as Touring Professional of The Old course Golf and Country Club.<br/><br/>The Old course Hotel, as it then was, was acquired by a major British public company in 1982 and a multi-million pound refurbishment programme was completed in April 1983 creating 150 luxury five star rooms, a health spa, restaurants and many other luxury amenities for the exclusive use of members of The Old Course Golf and Country Club.<br/><br/>The club offers a unique membership which gives members a passport to unparalleled golf facilities the world over and which includes many of the finest resorts both in europe and in the U.S.A., with luxurious, complimentary accomodation.<br/><br/>Jack Nicklaus, Bernhard Langer and Sean Connery are but a few of the well known members of this, the most prestigious club in the world-<br/><br/>The Old Course Golf and Country Club, St. Andrews.<br/><br/>Game: Played on full colour scale drawings of The Old Course.<br/><br/>"}, "36291": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic331240.jpg", "boardgameimplementation": {"17677": "Flying Fortress 1 & 2"}, "poll": {}, "boardgamedesigner": {"1747": {"name": "Ty Bomba"}}, "statistics": {}, "yearpublished": "2008", "maxplayers": "2", "boardgameartist": {"11857": "Nicol\u00e1s Eskubi"}, "boardgamepublisher": {"102": {"name": "Decision Games (I)"}}, "maxplaytime": "360", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic331240_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "360", "boardgamecategory": {"2650": {"name": "Aviation / Flight"}}, "description": "Best estimates today have it that the war in Europe most likely would have continued for about 24 months after February 1944 had it not been for the cumulative effects of the Allied strategic aerial offensive against the Germans. That means the war was most likely shortened somewhere between 13 and 15 months by the effects of that campaign. We say &quot;most likely&quot; and &quot;somewhere between&quot; because we can't be more certain. That is, starting at the end of 1944, the Western Allied and Soviet ground advances began to add their resource-denying effects to the successes being scored by the bombers. Where precisely the effects of the one effort picked up and the other left off is, and will likely always remain, a matter of debate.<br/><br/>We can, however, use that December 1944 cut off date to our advantage in this game. We know for certain that prior to that time any collapse of the German war effort would mostly certainly have been due to the bombings' effects. If the &quot;Bomber Barons&quot; were to prove they could win a war with their planes alone, we can now see they had to do it by that date. Thus the would-be Bomber Barons in today's wargame hobby must also bring their efforts to fruition by that time in the game in order to win.<br/><br/>In general, each &quot;game turn&quot; represents the cumulative effects of one month of aerial operations. Note, though, Game Turn 3 represents two calendar months. That's because a large portion of US aircraft strength was drawn away from this campaign during that time in order to assist in the battlefield preparation for the D-Day landings. There are a maximum of 10 game turns to each campaign.<br/><br/>The large-size, fully iconic, counters included with the game (176 total), are by famed artist Nicolas Eskubi. They represent air groups and wings, along with German FLAK brigades and divisions. Aside from all the formations historically involved in the campaign, an extended German Me-262 order of battle is included. That will allows players to determine, once and for all, exactly how many of those remarkable planes it would've taken to have finally and fully stopped the American onslaught.<br/><br/>Each large hex on the map represents 33.33 miles (54 Km) from side to opposite side.

It was first released back in the mid 1990&rsquo;s and was again released as a computer game through Battlefront in 2004. Brian Marrs did all the programming for the computer game.<br/><br/>Down In Flames places each player in the cockpit of a Leader and Wingman as they enter combat against other aircraft. By playing cards, you gain advantageous positions on your targets, fire your guns, and send them down in flames!<br/><br/>The game is based on a unique action-reaction card mechanic. Each card can be countered by specific other cards. At the bottom of every card is the list of cards it is allowed to cancel. This makes for exciting card play back and forth between players&hellip;<br/><br/>Player #1: &ldquo;I Play an In My Sights for 3 Hits. If you don&rsquo;t stop it, you&rsquo;re going down.&rdquo; Player #2: &ldquo;I counter with a Barrel Roll.&rdquo; Player #1: &ldquo;I react with a Yo-Yo.&rdquo; Player #2: &ldquo;You got me.&rdquo;<br/><br/>Each aircraft is accurately simulated with a several ratings including: Performance (the maximum cards you can hold), Horsepower (the maximum cards you can draw each turn), Bursts (how many times you can fire), Damage (how much damage your attacks inflict), and Airframe (how much damage your aircraft can sustain).<br/><br/>The air combat is simulated using a Positioning system that allows aircraft to be Advantaged, Tailing, Disadvantaged, or Tailed in relation to other aircraft. An aircraft&rsquo;s position determine if it can aircraft, and how many bonus Bursts it receives if it is Advantaged or Tailing.<br/><br/>The game uses a simple Altitude system to add this vital aspect of air combat. Aircraft get to draw cards when diving, and must discard cards when climbing.<br/><br/>The game also includes Light, Medium, and Heavy Bombers that are used in the historical campaign games.<br/><br/>Down In Flames has won several awards through the years and continues to be a favorite for both serious and casual gamers.<br/><br/>Components<br/>110 Full color Action Cards<br/>110 Full Color Aircraft Cards<br/>Full Color Rulebook<br/>Full Color Counter Sheet (88 - 5/8&rdquo; counters)<br/>6 Full Color Campaign Sheets<br/><br/>DiF: Aces High is part of the Down in Flames series.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": {"173975": "English Edition 2008"}, "average": "7.04529", "name": "Down in Flames: Aces High", "playingtime": "45", "boardgamemechanic": {"2018": "Campaign / Battle Card Driven"}, "age": "0", "boardgameexpansion": {}, "usersrated": "244", "boardgamesubdomain": {"4664": "Wargames"}, "boardgamefamily": {"75": "Down in Flames"}}, "36326": {"boardgamedesigner": {"3": {"name": "(Uncredited)"}}, "poll": {}, "name": "Soccer Dice Game", "playingtime": "20", "minplayers": "1", "boardgamemechanic": {"2072": "Dice Rolling"}, "yearpublished": "2005", "usersrated": "4", "boardgamefamily": {"5551": "Sports: Football / Soccer"}, "maxplayers": "2", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic329884_t.jpg", "average": "2.825", "statistics": {}, "boardgamepublisher": {"1954": {"name": "Koplow Games"}}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic329884.jpg", "boardgameversion": {"90860": "German Edition"}, "maxplaytime": "20", "boardgamecategory": {"1017": {"name": "Dice"}}, "age": "0", "minplaytime": "20", "description": "Game includes four oversized white dice (offensive) and one black die (defensive) in a plastic tube with small instruction booklet.

Over 300 vehicles provided various duties, as well. The chosen sector for the attack lay between the Red 8th and 9th Armies and was not covered well&mdash;it was very porous. The Red 36th and 40th divisions held the 100 km section of the line (with gaping holes where 40km was not covered) through which Mamontov's corps&rsquo; passed. Mamontov used air reconnaissance to find a sector where his cavalry could slip through without serious opposition to avoid contact with Bolshevik units and struck deep into the Red rear with orders to wreck the rail lines and destroy military stores as they advanced.<br/><br/>The Mamontov Offensive ripped through the Red lines and at lightening speed made incredible advances into the rear of the Red beast- 125 miles! Both Trotsky and Lenin were very concerned about the White advance and the ineptness of their own troops, many of which defected to Mamontov at Tambov, a supply center. Like the panzers of WW2, the White cavalry seemed unstoppable. So much so, that Red air units were sent flying to find them and attack.<br/><br/>Like all White attacks, it too, had begun well. However, Mamontov's men were not professionals, they more like mercenaries and were easily diverted to looting, mayhem and rape, which turned the local population against them. By Sept 10, many of his men had simply went home with the loot and soon he found himself and those that remained in a &quot;situation&quot; at Voronezh nearly surrounded as Red troops had finally gathered. Denikin ordered his Kuban Corps to attack from the south to divert Red divisions against Mamontov, and for the next week, a bitter battle ensued with Mamomtov trying to breakout.<br/><br/>The game comes with a 22x17&quot; map, 280 counters, rules.

This is a statistic that operates under the revolutionary and controversial theorem that a pitchers value comes from his strikeouts, walks, and home runs allowed (because these are the only events over which the pitcher has total control).<br/><br/>Each at bat starts on the pitchers card and while one of the outcomes from above (K, BB or HR) may come into play each batter has the final say.  The game includes split LH/RH ratings for all pitchers and hitters with at least 40 BF/AB against each side. Defensive plays such as range plays and errors are interwoven into the game so as to make it seamless.  All action comes from the players cards so outside chart lookups to determine the outcome of at bats are a thing of the past.<br/>Hitters are not left out as they are rated for where they actually hit the ball in the year represented.  Base running, stealing and bunting can be handled by the game engine for the solitaire player as well.<br/><br/>Ballparks play a big part in IP.  Now each park will have its own card (look just like a hitter card)  that is referenced during game play.  Ballparks will be represented on more than just HRs allowed.  All hits, strikeouts and walks will be affected by the place a game is being played.  Just by looking at the ballpark cards you will see that the Astrodome will yield few HR chances while Coors Field will earn its rep as the launching pad.<br/>These ballpark cards have been seamlessly added to the game as well by not requiring any outside lookups.  They have also give the opportunity to add rare plays and the &quot;trying to stretch&quot; hits in the game.<br/><br/>We have completed a sample game run through that shows how the game plays along with pictures to guide you the IP game play.

From where you start with the pitchers card to how the defense gets involved the game just feels right.

Following this event, the Queen of Fatal disappeared and a few enchanters left that world and arrived on Earth.<br/><br/>The five breaches in Europe gave origin to as many magic birth-signs: Flambeaux (Paris), Aquat&eacute; (Brno), Terranova (Rome), &Aring;ngb&aring;t (Tallinn), Lichtenborn (Nuremberg). Five families who over the centuries kept wavering between open war and armed peace, but who never lived in harmony.<br/><br/>Since then, the enchanters have influenced humans politics, arts and science: either directly or by inspiring and taking control over all humans who were useful for their cause, and FATAL is a piece of this tale.<br/><br/>The game features a deck of 110 cards. Each player belongs to one of the birth-signs and tries to catch the greater number of treasures by playing &quot;trimagics&quot; (combination of three cards) and/or beating other players.<br/><br/>During his turn, the player:<br/><br/>     may play a special &quot;enchantment&quot; card,<br/>     may steal a card in front of another player (with a rock-paper-scissors system printed on the cards),<br/>     may play up to two cards in front of himself.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Each player has two &quot;virtual&quot; columns where he can play cards: the first card of a column is played normally, the second card is played rotated by 180&deg;, the third card completes the column (the &quot;trimagic&quot;) and must be placed rotated by 90&deg;.<br/>The three cards of a tri-spell have a different meaning: the first card decides the performed action, the second one fixes the number of targets or the power of the spell, the third one closes the trimagic.<br/><br/>Each player has also a designed enemy (by secret role assignment at the start of the game): if he defeats this player, he is the winner.

Having a simple-to-learn strategic system and short rulebook, The Napoleonic Wars, can be played in an evening as the cards and Diplomatic Track make for tough decision-making in the face of everchanging enemy threats.<br/><br/>Set in 1805 Europe, you must weigh the strategic dilemmas facing the two alliances in mortal conflict. Napoleon's France enjoys a superb army, central position, superior leadership, and a useful, if not powerful, ally in Spain. However, she faces three foes.<br/><br/>Napoleon must beware of Britain's seapower and wealth, Austria's threatening position, and Russia's reinforcing hordes. In the wings, Prussia, Turkey, and Sweden teeter on the brink of war, begging inducements to join either side. Even lowly Denmark's fleet can upset the balance of power.<br/><br/>When fleets or armies collide, battle-related cards may be played and then dice are rolled to resolve the battle and inflict casualties. Even the most brilliant maneuver faces the chance of floundering. So play The Napoleonic Wars now, and put the strategist in you to the test.

This 35-year long conflict saw the extinction of a large number of noble houses, and would eventually set the house of Tudor upon the throne.<br/><br/>In Crown of Roses, players take on the roles of the dynastic giants - the House of Lancaster and their Beaufort cousins, and the House of York. The four player game adds in the powerful House of Stafford, and the ever-scheming Richard Neville and his son, Richard of Warwick, the 'Kingmaker'.<br/><br/>Using intuitive mechanics, Crown of Roses offers players a historical feeling with tremendous strategic depth and excellent replayability. Unit starting locations vary with each turn and even with each game, and the use of blocks creates the &quot;fog of war&quot; of limited intelligence on enemy strength and deployment. Random game events throw a touch of the chaos of the era into the mix, and the multiple uses for the player action cards leads to a level of uncertainty where enemy plans are concerned.<br/><br/>During each game turn in Crown of Roses, players will play cards to perform actions such as improving their armies, influencing the locals to support them, collecting supplies or prestige, moving to attack enemy forces, to recruit new houses to your cause, calling another Royal Heir into the fray, or even changing the nature of the conflict through the use of player events.<br/><br/>Unit blocks rotate to show strength, and each army can have a variety of experience levels and combat capabilities. A novel roll to hit-based system is used to determine combat results, with better experienced forces scoring hits more often in battle. Kill all of the enemy heirs, and you can rule England unimpeded!<br/><br/>In Parliament, players can try to gain a favorable posting or take control of the crown itself by gathering enough noble support. Gather enough votes for enough years and the nobles of parliament will welcome you as their sovereign!<br/><br/>And if you can create enough influence with the local gentry, your economic might will sway the common folk to support you as their chosen monarch!<br/><br/>And the four player game of Crown of Roses allows all of this and more without the sacrifice of the unique fog of war aspect that the unit blocks provide. With each player having up to three ways to win, who knows who will be the next King of England!&quot;<br/><br/>TIME SCALE Variable<br/><br/>MAP SCALE Area Movement<br/><br/>UNIT SCALE Noble houses and mercenary factions<br/><br/>NUMBER OF PLAYERS  Two to Four<br/><br/>COMPONENTS:<br/>22x24 inch Cardboard Game Map<br/>54 Large Wood Blocks<br/>27 Small Wood Blocks<br/>222 Counters<br/>1 sheet of 54 Block Stickers<br/>15 6-sided Dice<br/>110 playing Cards<br/>2 Color Play Aid Cards<br/>8 Parliament/Office Cards<br/>4 Player Mats<br/>1 Rules book<br/>1 Scenario and playbook<br/><br/>DEVELOPERS: Andy Young and Kevin Bernatz<br/>ART DIRECTOR/PACKAGING: Rodger B.
