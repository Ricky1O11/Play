Each captain has to make the same type of decisions that a cricket captain would normally make during a game, namely:<br/><br/><br/>     In what order to use his batsmen (four &quot;top&quot; batsmen, four &quot;medium&quot;, and three &quot;tail&quot;); typically you would use your best batsmen first, as they have no individual characteristics such as skill against a certain type of bowling.<br/><br/><br/><br/>     When to use his bowlers (two &quot;strike&quot; bowlers with one over each, two &quot;medium&quot; bowlers with two overs each, and two &quot;spin&quot; bowlers with two overs each). The rules suggest using your strike bowlers first to get the best batsmen out.<br/><br/><br/><br/>     Where to place his fieldsmen; the bowler and wicket keeper have to be in their designated positions on the board, but the other nine can be placed in any one of 21 other named positions (mid-off, mid-on, extra cover, etc.). This seems to be where most of the decision-making takes place.<br/><br/><br/>Once the batsmen, bowler, and fieldsmen are in place and ready, a bowler/batsman matchup table is consulted to determine which of three coloured dice is rolled:<br/><br/><br/>     the black die (1,1,2,3,3,4), which favours neither batsman nor bowler<br/>     the blue die (1,2,3,4,4,6), which favours the batsman<br/>     the red die (1,1,1,2,2,4), which favours the bowler<br/><br/><br/>The indicated die is rolled. On a six, the batsman simply scores six runs (the maximum). On a 1 to 4, a card is drawn from the relevant deck, there being four named &quot;Card One&quot; to &quot;Card Four&quot;). Each card has three possible outcomes, one for each type of bowler. The relevant outcome is evaluated based on the positions of the fieldsmen. For example, one of the &quot;Card Three&quot; cards says this for the &quot;strike&quot; bowler:<br/><br/>&quot;Driven in the air for some distance but a bad bounce beats mid-off who stumbles after it for 2 runs. No mid-off, 3 runs. No long-off, 4 runs.&quot;<br/><br/>Some cards call for the red die to be rolled, in which case the batsman must roll a 1 NOT to be given out (50% chance).<br/><br/>The innings is over once ten batsmen are out or ten overs have been completed. Each team has one innings, after which the team with the higher score wins the game.<br/><br/>"}, "38918": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic725301.jpg", "poll": {}, "boardgamedesigner": {"7324": {"name": "Adam Ka\u0142u\u017ca"}}, "statistics": {}, "yearpublished": "2008", "maxplayers": "4", "boardgameartist": {"32201": "Piotr Socha"}, "boardgamepublisher": {"4819": {"name": "Dr. Wood Challenge Centre"}}, "maxplaytime": "20", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic725301_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "20", "boardgamecategory": {"1009": {"name": "Abstract Strategy"}}, "description": "In Hooop!, players need to move their frogs to the opposing player's lilypads, with the first player to do so winning the game.

After each jump &ndash; or &quot;jump&quot;, as it were &ndash; the bridge used by that frog falls into the lake.<br/><br/>The lilypads are set up in a square or pyramid, depending on the number of players in the game, with one bridge between each pair of adjacent lilypads. On a turn, a player either moves one frog from one lilypad to an adjacent one (removing the bridge after doing so, except for the bridge to a player's home, which can never be removed) or places one bridge on the board to connect two lilypads. If a frog lands on an occupied space (other than a player's home), the frog already on that space must jump away in a direction of the active player's choosing, removing the bridge used; if that frog lands next to another, then the process repeats. If a frog cannot jump away when encroached upon due to a lack of bridges, then the initial jump is illegal and the active player must take another action.<br/><br/>Each player has four action cards that can be used once each game to place two bridges, jump without needing a bridge, remove an additional bridge, or take an extra jump.

The title comes from Amerigo Vespucci, and like that famed explorer, you must travel the world to search for goods. (Unlike him, you won't have a couple of continents named after you.) The farther you explore, the more likely you are to find goods of better value, but you have to make it back to market if you plan to sell anything, so don't wander off too far.&quot;<br/><br/><br/><br/>Game Summary<br/>Cards have a picture of a boat, 1-3 captain's wheels, and 1 of 5 goods types (in differing rarities in the deck). Start with a hand of ... 4? On your turn, either sail (start a voyage if you're not on one, or continue the current voyage) or market (if you're not on a voyage).To sail further, play a card with the ship moving to the right -- #wheels adds to distance of voyage. May play out of your hand, or from your score pile (play face down; counts as 3 wheels). OR, explore: rotate last card clockwise, draw cards from deck (2 x distance sailed, hand limit 12). After exploring, must sail home; cards played count 2xwheels -- home when you've played at least the distance of the voyage. Upon arriving home, draw bonus cards (hand limit still applies):<br/>- if voyage was longest distance of all current voyages, 1 card.<br/>- if voyage was 7 wheels, 1 card; 8 wheels, 2; 9+ wheels, 3.<br/><br/>If Marketing, add cards from hand to display; max 12 cards on display. Sort by type of goods. OR, sell cards already on display: sell all possible. Rarest good (looking at all markets on table) worth 1 coin per card. Most popular worth 1 coin/2 cards. All others are common, and worth 1 coin/3 cards. If tied for rarest/popular, goods become common. Sold goods are flipped over to represent coins (added to your score pile) or discarded.<br/><br/>Game ends immediately if, after the first time through the draw deck, all players are at home at the same time; or the 2nd time through the draw deck. Make final sales, with all cards left in hand and on display worth 1 coin/4 cards.<br/><br/>Most money wins.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": {"25655": "First edition"}, "average": "5.84018", "name": "Amerigo", "playingtime": "30", "age": "0", "usersrated": "140", "boardgamesubdomain": {"5497": "Strategy Games"}, "boardgamefamily": {"22783": "Admin: Better Description Needed!"}}, "38925": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic758793.jpg", "poll": {}, "boardgamedesigner": {"1358": {"name": "Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Bey"}}, "statistics": {}, "yearpublished": "2008", "maxplayers": "2", "boardgameartist": {"3290": "Pascal da Silva"}, "boardgamepublisher": {"3163": {"name": "Canons en Carton"}}, "maxplaytime": "0", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic758793_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "0", "boardgamecategory": {"1035": {"name": "Medieval"}}, "description": "Swords and Crusade is a new module for the series Au fil de l&rsquo;&eacute;p&eacute;e (By the Edge of the Sword), and includes two battles of the First Crusade.<br/>These two battles oppose, for the first time in history, the &laquo; Frankish &raquo; knights Normans of France and Sicily, French, Proven&ccedil;als, and Lotharingians to the Seljuk Turks (Dorylaeum) and to the Fatimids (Ascalon).<br/><br/>Ep&eacute;es et Croisade (Swords and Crusade)<br/>Available in English or French<br/>Dorylaeum 1097 and Ascalon 1099<br/>1 rules booklet (8 pages)<br/>1 scenarios booklet with historical notes (10 pages)<br/>2 A3x2 maps - 382 counters<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "0", "boardgameversion": {"216754": "Desktop Published English Edition"}, "average": "7.24737", "name": "Ep\u00e9es et croisades", "playingtime": "0", "boardgamemechanic": {"2026": "Hex-and-Counter"}, "age": "0", "usersrated": "19", "boardgamesubdomain": {"4664": "Wargames"}, "boardgamefamily": {"117": "Au fil de l'\u00e9p\u00e9e "}}, "38926": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic383182.jpg", "poll": {}, "boardgamedesigner": {"11433": {"name": "Fran\u00e7ois Criscuolo"}}, "statistics": {}, "yearpublished": "2008", "maxplayers": "0", "boardgameartist": {"42958": "Didier Bourgeois"}, "boardgamepublisher": {"540": {"name": "Vae Victis"}}, "maxplaytime": "0", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic383182_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "0", "boardgamecategory": {"1035": {"name": "Medieval"}}, "description": "Covers the battle of Otterburn 1388 in the Au fil de l'&eacute;p&eacute;e game series.<br/><br/>A tactical wargame where one map hexagon represents about 200 meters and each game turn represents about 1/2 hour of real time.<br/><br/>Published as second game in VV 78, jan 2008.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "0", "boardgameversion": {"31015": "Vae Victis magazine edition"}, "average": "6.18182", "name": "Otterburn 1388", "playingtime": "0", "boardgamemechanic": {"2026": "Hex-and-Counter"}, "age": "0", "usersrated": "11", "boardgamesubdomain": {"4664": "Wargames"}, "boardgamefamily": {"117": "Au fil de l'\u00e9p\u00e9e "}}, "38927": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic553625.jpg", "poll": {}, "boardgamedesigner": {"25": {"name": "Richard Borg"}}, "statistics": {}, "yearpublished": "2009", "maxplayers": "8", "boardgameartist": {"71": "Rodger B.

The Romans fight in Britain at Medway 43AD, against Boudica at Watling Street 61 AD, and later at Mons Graupius 84AD. Antony and Octavian of the Second Triumvirate battle it out twice with Cassius and Brutus at Philippi 42BC. But the main focus of this expansion is Rome's conflicts against the Parthian Empire, Teutonic Barbarians and internal turmoil of civil wars until Constantine becomes the undisputed Roman Emperor around 325AD.<br/><br/>Imperial Rome is packed full of unique and interesting play concepts and new units: cataphracted cavalry, wagon laager forts, massed units of horse archers, light infantry tossing caltrops and more. Each of these concepts operates within the confines of the original system rules, with only slight modifications to reflect historical abilities and importance. So, rules-wise, if you own Commands &amp; Colors: Ancients, you'll have no trouble learning the few new special rules.<br/><br/>Components:<br/><br/>* 293 blocks and FOUR sticker sheets<br/>    * 1 sheet of new terrain tiles<br/>    * two wooden card holders<br/>    * scenario booklet (with 24 scenarios)<br/>    * 2 reference cards<br/><br/>Important: In order to play the scenarios in the Imperial Rome expansion, you will need a copy of the basic Commands & Colors: Ancients game and copies of Expansion Nr. 1 Greek vs The Eastern Kingdoms and Expansion Nr. 2 Rome vs The Barbarians.  You can substitute &quot;other&quot; armies for some of the scenarios, but others have specific force requirements (like lots of horse archers) which may make that hard to do.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": {"30307": "First Edition"}, "average": "8.30677", "name": "Commands & Colors: Ancients Expansion Pack #4 \u2013 Imperial Rome", "playingtime": "60", "boardgamemechanic": {"2018": "Campaign / Battle Card Driven"}, "age": "12", "boardgameexpansion": {}, "usersrated": "319", "boardgamesubdomain": {"4664": "Wargames"}, "expands": {"14105": {"name": "Commands & Colors: Ancients"}}, "boardgamefamily": {"5606": "Ancient Rome"}}, "38929": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic383346.jpg", "poll": {}, "boardgamedesigner": {"405": {"name": "Peter Wichmann"}}, "statistics": {}, "yearpublished": "2008", "maxplayers": "4", "boardgameartist": {"3262": "Czarn\u00e8"}, "boardgamepublisher": {"2173": {"name": "LudoArt Verlag"}}, "maxplaytime": "45", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic383346_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "45", "boardgamecategory": {"1009": {"name": "Abstract Strategy"}}, "description": "Translated &amp; abbreviated from the publisher's site:<br/><br/>Taurus is a 100% strategy game without long waiting times for players.<br/>The object of the game is to catch Bulls by planning fences.

Players are planning cathedral layout and overseeing work at the construction site in tandem, in the same time trying to gain advantage over the opposite player.<br/><br/>The temple is built by laying square tiles adjacent to the board or already built tiles. Tiles form the plan of the cathedral. These tiles, distinguished by four colors, represent different elements of the cathedral. The pool of tiles available to players is random. Later, the players place pawns on the tiles &ndash; these pawns are the teams of builders: foremen, masons and carpenters, who will make the design a reality.<br/><br/>The players strive to achieve two goals: to lay their cathedral tiles so as to create the largest possible areas representing a single color, and to have more pawns in these areas than their opponent.<br/><br/>Every tile bears also one special action that could be played instead of adding a tile to the cathedral. Using these actions player may move pawns from tile to tile, promote them (increasing their value) or manipulate the tiles. Execution of specific order excludes the tile from being used as part of cathedral, so choice between expanding the edifice and making some action is strategic. Planning and optimal use of available resources is important, as both participants share the same selection of tiles. Thus, tiles and actions shown on them not used by the player in her or his turn become immediately available to his opponent.<br/><br/>Some tiles trigger movement of a special King pawn, which moves along the scoring track. Every few moves, the King pawn comes to a space indicating a royal visit to the cathedral. During each royal visit, the progress of work is assessed and Victory Points are assigned to the players. The number of VPs each player is awarded depends on the size and number of the areas controlled by their pawns at the moment of scoring. The more areas the player controls, and the bigger these are, the greater the reward for the player. At the end of the game, the winner is the player who has claimed more Victory Points.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": {"81354": "First edition"}, "name": "Basilica", "playingtime": "45", "boardgamemechanic": {"2001": "Action Point Allowance System"}, "age": "10", "boardgameexpansion": {}, "usersrated": "516", "boardgamesubdomain": {"5497": "Strategy Games"}, "average": "6.65519"}, "38933": {"boardgamedesigner": {"11285": {"name": "Aimee Symington"}}, "poll": {}, "name": "Blunders", "playingtime": "0", "minplayers": "0", "boardgamemechanic": {"2035": "Roll / Spin and Move"}, "yearpublished": "2008", "usersrated": "5", "boardgamesubdomain": {"4665": "Children's Games"}, "maxplayers": "0", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic698587_t.jpg", "average": "3.8", "statistics": {}, "boardgamepublisher": {"8837": {"name": "Successful Kids, Inc."}}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic698587.jpg", "boardgameversion": {"27968": "First Edition"}, "maxplaytime": "0", "boardgamecategory": {"1041": {"name": "Children's Game"}}, "age": "5", "minplaytime": "0", "description": "The board game Blunders&trade; teaches children Ages 5 - 10 about social and dining etiquette in the most unique, interactive, and educational way ever imagined!

Called War Plan Crimson, it was a subset of War Plan Red, the plan for war with England, the largest, most detailed and most amended of all the U.S. war plans. A war with Great Britain and the British Commonwealth would be a world-wide conflict, easily making the term &ldquo;Second World War&rdquo; appropriate.<br/><br/>Even without the expected aid from Japan, the powerful British navy would threaten U.S. interests in and control of the Philippines, Alaska, Hawaii, Guam, Samoa, Cuba and Puerto Rico as well as the Panama Canal. In exchange for these losses, the U.S. planned to conquer Canada. This would be a crown to Manifest Destiny and a platform to rebuild and eventually regain all that would be lost elsewhere.<br/><br/>Canada would be invaded even if neutral. The Canadian government would be abolished and the conquest held in perpetuity. It would be made clear to Canada she would suffer grievously for resistance. The British peoples were seen as tough adversaries capable of fighting against odds to the finish. Use of poison gas was authorized from the start of hostilities. It would be a terrible war where populations would be on the front lines.<br/><br/>Experience had taught the British the advantage of naval control, and geography provided an inland ocean. The Great Lakes would be a shield of the Canadian Dominion and another sword to cut and bleed the United States of America. A long period of tension during which both sides made military preparations would include building naval forces for the Great Lakes.<br/><br/>Great War at Sea: U.S. Navy Plan Crimson is the most unusual game ever published in our popular naval series. While we've created games based on wars that never happened, fought with ships that were never built, in each case military planners thought about these battles and the ships at least reached the planning stage.<br/><br/>In this case, designer Milan Becvar has created a game in which neither the ships nor the plans have a &quot;real world&quot; analogue. That allows for a wide-open strategic situation, in which friendly and enemy bases are so close together that fleets cannot hope to elude one another.<br/><br/>There are 80 &quot;long&quot; ship pieces, using a larger size than usual for our naval games &mdash; both to make it easier to assemble them and because they're just plain cool.  This is further supplemented by 264 square pieces for smaller ships, aircraft, fleet and other markers.  The American and Canadian fleets are almost exclusively composed of &quot;lake battleships,&quot; similar to the coast defense vessels of other navies, with shallow draft and anywhere from four to seven big guns. There are also a handful of cruisers and a large number of destroyers.<br/><br/>The map, by Guy Riessen, covers the Great Lakes basin at the usual 32 miles per &quot;sea&quot; zone. All of the lakes are covered, linked by canals, both those that existed and those that could have been built. Both sides of the lakes are dotted with ports, with the American side hosting many vulnerable industrial centers and the Canadian shores within easy reach of the Dominion's vulnerable east-west lines of communication.<br/><br/>There are 13 scenarios, or separate game situations, included, with many more likely to join them in future Daily Content segments. The game uses the regular Great War at Sea rules, with some special rules to address this unusual situation.<br/><br/>U.S. Navy Plan Crimson is our first print-and-play game: The playing pieces are not die-cut and mounted, nor are the maps and rules printed. Instead it comes as a series of .pdf files that will need to be assembled into the game's components.  The game isn't for sale; it's free to all members of our Gold Club.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": {"30357": "Print & Play Gold Club Edition"}, "average": "7.79167", "name": "Great War at Sea: U.S. Navy Plan Crimson", "playingtime": "30", "boardgamemechanic": {"2072": "Dice Rolling"}, "age": "0", "usersrated": "12", "boardgamesubdomain": {"4664": "Wargames"}, "boardgamefamily": {"46": "Great War at Sea"}}, "38996": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic655136.jpg", "boardgameimplementation": {"620": "We the People"}, "poll": {}, "boardgamedesigner": {"152": {"name": "Mark Herman"}}, "statistics": {}, "yearpublished": "2010", "maxplayers": "2", "boardgameartist": {"2652": "Charles Kibler"}, "boardgamepublisher": {"52": {"name": "GMT Games"}}, "maxplaytime": "90", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic655136_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "90", "boardgamecategory": {"2726": {"name": "Age of Reason"}}, "boardgamehonor": {"21158": "2010 Charles S.

Washington's War, like its predecessor, pits the forces of a world power (England) against its rebellious American colonists as they fight for their independence.<br/><br/>Washington&rsquo;s War is a true re-design that maintains the deep strategy of We the People while creating a game with a very short playing time (approximately 90 minutes). Unlike most wargames, Washington's War allows you and your opponent to play twice while switching sides in one sitting. This feature allows for rapid tournament play either face-to-face or on the Internet. Washington's War is the perfect antidote for a time conscious crowd whose only option up to now have been Eurogames.<br/><br/>Washington&rsquo;s War features a dice-driven combat system that quickly resolves combat and is very friendly to Internet play. The game also features a new CDG discard mechanic that makes every card in your hand playable by allowing your opponent to buy his discarded events for an operations card. Now, unusual card distributions create challenges and not insurmountable barriers for advancing your strategy.<br/><br/>The biggest design changes between We the People and Washington's War, besides the aforementioned new game mechanics, is the increased emphasis on the asymmetrical capabilities of the two sides. The British are a conventional army with a dominant naval capability that gives them great strengths in the coastal regions. The Americans are an unconvential force with a small Contintental Army led by George Washington who yearn for French intervention. While the British struggle to expand their influence inland, the Americans struggle to keep their militia forces in the field. In the end it is the side that is better able to play to their strengths and protect their vulnerabilities that prevails in Washington's War.<br/><br/>Washington&rsquo;s War was broadly tested on the Internet in a tournament format to ensure clarity of rules under the stresses of competition.

It pits the forces of King George III against the American colonists as they fight for their independence. In Washington&rsquo;s War, you assume the role of either:<br/><br/><br/>     The King of Great Britain as he tries to bring his rebellious colonies back into the Empire, while at the same time dealing with a global war against ancient enemies bent on revenge for their losses in the Seven Years War; OR<br/>     The Continental Congress as they battle the forces of Britain, while trying to rally their countrymen to the cause of liberty.<br/><br/><br/>Washington&rsquo;s War is not just a re-tread of my earlier design on the same subject, but a true re-design that is keeping the basic feel while simplifying and speeding up what was already a fast paced game.

The two-player game pits the players head to head where the 4-player game has two players per team working as a partnership.  Each player starts with 7 cards, replacing cards played with cards from the deck and the game comes to an end after one run through the deck.<br/><br/>The cards are divided into attacking cards eg. Pass, Dribble, Shoot, defending cards eg. Tackle, Save, referee cards, eg. Offside, Penalty, and wonder cards, eg. Wonder Goal, Wonder Save.  The side with possession aims to build up a series of attacking cards leading to a shot thundering past the opponent's keeper, the defending side tries to get possession with a tackle or to get the keeper on the end of the shot with a save card.  Tackles have the risk of being countered by a referee dishing out a yellow or a red card or even a penalty which can only be saved by a Wonder Save.<br/><br/>The game plays in under half an hour and makes for a good filler especially with football fans.<br/><br/>"}, "38518": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic395580.jpg", "poll": {}, "boardgamedesigner": {"3": {"name": "(Uncredited)"}}, "statistics": {}, "yearpublished": "1991", "maxplayers": "4", "boardgameartist": {"4654": "Stan Berenstain"}, "boardgamepublisher": {"5700": {"name": "Western Publishing Company"}}, "maxplaytime": "15", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic395580_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "15", "boardgamecategory": {"1002": {"name": "Card Game"}}, "description": "From the back of the box:<br/><br/>&quot;The object of play is to collect the four members of the Berenstain Bear family (Mama, Papa, Brother and Sister Bear) and their matching hats.<br/><br/>The begin play, shuffle the cards and place them face-down in the center of the table.

The purpose is to re-create all the relevant factors of war at the operational level in the pre-industrial age.<br/>The game is played as a sequence of &ldquo;game turns&rdquo;, each made up of several actions performed by the forces of all sides present on the game board.

And this truly has to be an honorable man.<br/><br/>Basically this game is all about resource management and conflict, but unlike other games in this category you won't necessarily win, if you conquer the most areas. Your main goal is to earn enough honor, which can be achieved in different ways. There are two kinds of honor. 'Daimyo-Honor' is the victory condition and can be directly gained by holding provinces, and indirectly by transforming 'Samurai-Honor' at a set rate. 'Samurai-Honor' is gained by winning a defensive or offensive battle. It can be transformed into 'Daimyo-Honor' with a tea ceremony.<br/><br/>The first Daimyo who earns 50 points of honor wins the game. If this goal is not reached within 12 turns, the Daimyo with the most honor at that point wins the game.<br/><br/>What needs special mentioning is the turn mechanism of the game, which is really cleverly-devised: depending on the number of players, different 'offices' are in the game that get assigned to the players. In a 4-player game these offices are:<br/><br/>Daimyo: The active player. For clarification: in game terms, every player is a Daimyo, but only the active player acts as Daimyo. The Daimyo, as active player can restock his resources, attack a province and play special tiles. Most importantly, he assigns the other offices to his opponents.<br/><br/>Samurai: The general. He will lead the attack in the Daimyo's name. He can earn 'Samurai-honor' with a successful attack.<br/><br/>Bushi: the poor guy who is attacked by the Daimyo. He can earn 'Samurai-honor' with a successful defense.<br/><br/>Sensei: He gives council to the Daimyo. Tricky position, because his council can do the Daimyo harm or good. He can cancel an attack, spy on other players, use Ronin to destabilize a province, and suggest to the Daimyo how hard to punish his Samurai    when he loses a battle.<br/><br/>The battles are resolved by a system that depends on the number of troops and a rock-paper-scissors element. The opponents have the possibility to improve their odds by investing some of their resources.<br/><br/>The tricky part of the game is that most of your actions depend at least partly on the goodwill of one of your opponents. For instance the Daimyo depends on the Samurai to win, but the Samurai will only do this, if he sees enough gain for himself. This makes the game very interactive, with much discussion and haggling at the table.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "3", "boardgameversion": {"37884": "German first edition"}, "average": "6.34946", "name": "Bushido: Der Weg des Kriegers", "playingtime": "90", "boardgamemechanic": {"2040": "Hand Management"}, "age": "12", "boardgameexpansion": {}, "usersrated": "241", "boardgamesubdomain": {"5497": "Strategy Games"}, "boardgamefamily": {"9470": "Asian Theme"}}, "38709": {"boardgamedesigner": {"17635": {"name": "Moc & Gianba"}}, "poll": {}, "name": "Raid Fiat 128", "playingtime": "0", "minplayers": "2", "yearpublished": "1975", "usersrated": "1", "boardgamefamily": {"25247": "Traffic Games"}, "maxplayers": "4", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic401053_t.jpg", "average": "6.5", "statistics": {}, "boardgamepublisher": {"253": {"name": "Editrice Giochi"}}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic401053.jpg", "boardgameversion": {"229418": "German edition"}, "maxplaytime": "0", "boardgamecategory": {"1017": {"name": "Dice"}}, "age": "0", "minplaytime": "0", "description": "<br/>Raid Fiat 128 Game  by Editrice Giochi<br/><br/>2 - 4 Players.<br/><br/>Description<br/><br/>The aim of the game is to complete the course with the smallest number of penalties. <br/>The Course consists of 128 sections marked by small yellow triangles.  - Each Represents 20Km.<br/><br/>Cars may overtake only on broken white lines - They must stay behind otherwise!<br/><br/>The game includes gear cards, radio cards and weather cards.  <br/>Watch your speed on the bends or face penalties.<br/><br/>Adverse Weather Will Affect Your Journey.<br/><br/>All Signs Must be Obeyed.<br/><br/>The Automatic Panel Feature is a Great Design Feature - To See How Far You Travel(Instead of Dice) -<br/><br/>Take a Gear Card,Engage the Gear on the Automatic Panel and Turn the Wheel Until the R.P.M Indicator Shows What the Card Reads.<br/><br/>The Speedometer Will Then Show How Many K.P.H You Can Move -<br/><br/>E.g - Card Reads  - Gear 1-11   RPM 2700.<br/><br/>Select Gear 1-11 on Panel,Move Wheel to 2700 RPM - Speedo Shows 20Km/h - You Can Then Move One Section.<br/><br/>Contents<br/><br/>1 Course Board.<br/><br/>4 Fiat 128 Miniature Playing Pieces.<br/><br/>1 Automatic Panel.<br/><br/>1 Pack of Gear Cards(34).<br/><br/>1 Pack of Radio Cards(18).<br/><br/>1 Pack of Weather Cards(10).<br/><br/>1 Pack of Tickets(30).<br/><br/>1 Set of Instructions.<br/>  <br/> "}, "38710": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic376488.jpg", "poll": {}, "boardgamedesigner": {"11182": {"name": "Francisco Ronco"}}, "statistics": {}, "yearpublished": "0", "maxplayers": "6", "boardgameartist": {"26508": "Ram\u00f3n \u00c1lvarez"}, "boardgamepublisher": {"8784": {"name": "Bellica Third Generation"}}, "maxplaytime": "0", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic376488_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "0", "boardgamecategory": {"1051": {"name": "Napoleonic"}}, "description": "Age of Muskets Volume II: Eagles Rising  <br/> &quot;Eagles Rising&quot; is the second volume of our Age of Muskets Series, it covers Napoleon's Campaign in Northern Italy 1796-97. There, Napoleon made a name for himself and earned the prestige that would put in his hands the destinies of France and, eventually, of Europe.<br/><br/>The Campaign started with Bonaparte's offensive in the spring of 1796 that knocked the Piedmontese Kingdom out of the war and subjected it to French power. Then followed the struggle against Austrian attempts to relieve the besieged Mantua, and retake the Po River Valley that led to the Battle of Rivoli in January 1797. Finally with Napoleon's offensive in the spring of 1797 that led to Leoben (on the road to Vienna) and, eventually, to his victory over the First Coalition.<br/><br/>As in Volume I the game includes all the elements that characterized pre-industrial warfare. However, the player will also find some elements distinctive of this campaign, as Alpine terrain, a different map and time scale to reflect the duration of the campaign as well as certain historical details (the systematic looting by the French, the revolts against French occupation ...).

The game starts when players meet their special someone. As they get to know each other better they can focus on the 8 things that their relationship can rely on, the things that hold the couple together &ndash; matching sense of humour, mutual outdoor hobbies, mutual intellectual hobbies, similar values, mutual dreams for the future, memories the couple have together, matching music taste and of course sex. The more they find in common in each other the more points they get.<br/><br/>The game proceeds by players placing tiles on the board. Both the tiles and game board have symbols for these 8 things that relationships can consist of and players try to match the symbols on tiles to those in game board.<br/><br/>However every tile also holds an evil promise. A chance for mistrust, a black heart that represents all the bad things in relationships. As player's tiles approach one another these black hearts become both something that jepardise your own relationship, but those of others too. If two black hearts are placed next to one another, then the one that was there first gets turned 45 degrees.

Each player takes the role of a person who continues to abuse drugs throughout his/her lifetime.  The last player left &ldquo;alive&rdquo; in the game &ldquo;wins.&rdquo;  The game uses vignettes as well as facts and quotes to emphasize the consequences amassed in the game.

Newly assigned to the sector, the Finnish Colonel Paavo Talvela  surveys the terrain and chooses the place to make a stand: a lake called Tolvaj&auml;rvi.  The weary and demoralized Finnish ski troops have mere hours to recover a semblance of order before the Russian juggernaut smashes into them yet again. Over the next five days, the world watches in awe as the Finns manage to halt the Russian advance through sheer heroic determination.  Then, miraculously, the Finns launch a successful counterattack...<br/><br/>Red Winter is a two player historical game which simulates the unusual battle at Tolvaj&auml;rvi at a rarely gamed scale: company sized combat units and 90 minute game turns.  Players assume the roles of the Russian and Finnish commanders, controlling the actions of Finnish ski infantry, Russian heavy machine gun companies, mortars, tanks, anti-tank guns, and other combat units. A desperate battle for territory and survival is about to be waged across a bleak and snowy landscape of forests, swamps, and frozen lakes.<br/><br/>The game utilizes many tried-and-true &quot;classic&quot; wargame mechanics in combination with novel and well-integrated systems for ranged attacks, unit recovery, Finnish night raids, attrition losses from sub-zero weather conditions, and more.  The design focuses foremost on playability, with low counter  density, concise rules, and sleek, simple mechanics that combine to allow each player the luxury of completing his turn in about five minutes.  This means the full 40 turn campaign game is playable in a single afternoon.  The large 5/8 inch counters and oversized hexes further increase playability.  And the illustrated examples make it easy to jump right into the action.<br/><br/>TIME SCALE: 90 Minute Game Turns <br/>MAP SCALE:  425 yards per hex <br/>UNIT SCALE: mostly companies; some sections and platoons <br/>PLAYERS: 1-2 <br/>COMPLEXITY: Moderate<br/>Playing Time: 20 minutes to 12 hours, depending on scenario<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": {"166109": "English first edition"}, "average": "8.024", "name": "Red Winter: The Soviet Attack at Tolvaj\u00e4rvi, Finland \u2013 8-12 December 1939", "playingtime": "720", "boardgamemechanic": {"2026": "Hex-and-Counter"}, "age": "12", "usersrated": "411", "boardgamesubdomain": {"4664": "Wargames"}, "boardgamefamily": {"10316": "Country: Finland"}}, "38787": {"boardgamedesigner": {"3": {"name": "(Uncredited)"}}, "average": "3.8", "poll": {}, "name": "Wheel Of Fortune Card Game", "playingtime": "30", "minplayers": "2", "yearpublished": "2008", "usersrated": "5", "boardgamefamily": {"19358": "Quick Picks Series"}, "maxplayers": "4", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic450679_t.jpg", "boardgameartist": {"44835": "Design Edge"}, "statistics": {}, "boardgamepublisher": {"562": {"name": "Endless Games (I)"}}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic450679.jpg", "boardgameversion": {"122662": "Endless Games edition"}, "maxplaytime": "30", "boardgamecategory": {"1002": {"name": "Card Game"}}, "age": "0", "minplaytime": "30", "description": "Cards replace the famous wheel of the TV show, providing the values of each guess of a letter.

Tournament &amp; Campaign Edition is a simplified version of Fantasy Rules! 3rd edition.  While the latter weighs in at over 130 pages, the TCE is less than 40 pages.  The goal of the game is to remove many of the more elaborate constructs such as burrowing creatures, battlewagons, high magic levels, and elaborate army lists, and allow players to focus on the core rules so that they can play quick games as part of a tournament and campaign.  The mechanics of the game is basically the same--it's just a much slimmed down version with a lot fewer options.<br/><br/>Although FR!TCE is designed to be compatible with FR!3, it is in some respects a very different game. All Chipco games rely on a balance between units, magic (in FR!), characters and missile fire. Every unit/character has its vulnerability. In simplifying the game for extremely fast play, we have abstracted or eliminated many of the high-level magic, capabilities, and units.<br/><br/>Features of FR!TCE include:<br/><br/>* A Grand tactical, historical-based system that rewards sound military tactics.<br/>    * Fast play; designed to play in an hour for easy compatiblity with your tournaments and campaigns.<br/>    * A Simplified but satisfying magic system; magic is not just an artillery hit.<br/>    * There are no restrictive army lists, but rather a system focusing on an army or nation's core strengths that you can use to ensure the army fits your concept.<br/>    * A campaign system that lets character/units level up with experience in battle.<br/>    * Based on Chipco's Fantasy Rules!; a vetted and well tested system.<br/><br/>Fantasy Rules! Tournament and Campaign Edition (FR!TCE) differs from the standard FR!3 ruleset in the following manner:<br/><br/>* The Morale Clock starts at 7.<br/>    * Capabilities diminish when the clock reaches 3.<br/>    * No unit RF/CF can be raised by magic or character bonuses by more than +2. Only rank and file units can have a magic or character RF/CF bonus, not Special units (except Large Monsters, when ridden).<br/>    * Large Monsters (including dragons and leviathans) and Spirits usually require a pip to move (unless ridden).<br/>    * There is only one simplified level of magic.<br/>    * The character system has also been simplified, with some differences from FR!3. Note: These new concepts are compatible with FR!3 (for example, you might wish to use the FR!3 TCE Witch Hunter capabilities instead of the original FR!3 ones).<br/>    * FR!3 optional rules are not part of FR!TCE, and unit/character lists have been streamlined.<br/>    * There are no specific army lists. Instead, we have sixteen Army Focuses; these are special character and unit core competencies in which an armies/races/civilizations might specialize. Each army picks 3-4. For example, if the Orcs in your world are noble knights or steppe riders, then you can set up the lists to accomodate.<br/>    * There is a hierarchy of units (raised, regular, veteran, and elite) to simulate campaign experience (for example, Mounted are raised, Heavy Cavalry are regular, and Knights, Light Cavalry, and Heavy Chariots are veteran).<br/><br/>FR!TCE is designed to be played in under an hour since fast, simple play is essential for conventions, campaigns and tournaments, evening play, or to just have a simplified game to introduce beginners to miniature wargame rules. In doing so, we have not sacrificed tactics, skill, or interesting variety; our players get to fight the battle, not the rules. FR!3 and FR!TCE are designed for use with 10mm, 15mm, or 25mm armies.<br/><br/>These rules are designed to be used in the fantasy or mythical world of your choice, not one that we have designed.

It is played on a 9x9 grid, traditionally on a shogi board.

The two sides are called sente [&quot;black&quot;] and gote [&quot;white&quot;], as in shogi, with sente moving first. Traditionally, Go-stones are used for the pieces.<br/><br/>The object of the game is to capture all of an opponents' pieces or to have captured more pieces than one's opponent if a situation arises in which additional captures are no longer possible. All pieces move like rooks is chess, i.e., in any uninterrupted vertical or horizontal line in any obstructed direction without jumping. Pieces are taken by custodial capture, i.e., when an enemy piece becomes horizontally or vertically sandwiches between two of a player's own pieces. One of the two pieces bracketing the captured piece must be moved in order to capture but multiple simultaneous captured are allowed.<br/><br/>The game is a member of the petteia or lantruculorum family of games. A similar game is played in Thailand and in , where respectively it is called Mak-yes and Apit-sodok; this game differs only in that the second row of pieces starts on the third rather than the second row.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": {"33371": "Print and Play edition"}, "name": "Dai Hasami Shogi", "playingtime": "0", "boardgamemechanic": {"2078": "Point to Point Movement"}, "average": "5.5", "usersrated": "9", "boardgamesubdomain": {"4666": "Abstract Games"}, "boardgamefamily": {"4055": "Petteia"}}, "38823": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2641280.jpg", "is_expanded_by": {"38216": {"name": "Conflict of Heroes Expansion Pack: Map Board #6 \u2013 The Marsh"}}, "poll": {}, "boardgamedesigner": {"7457": {"name": "Uwe Eickert"}}, "statistics": {}, "yearpublished": "2009", "maxplayers": "4", "boardgameartist": {"11866": "Steve Paschal"}, "boardgamepublisher": {"7747": {"name": "Academy Games"}}, "maxplaytime": "120", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2641280_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "120", "boardgamecategory": {"1019": {"name": "Wargame"}}, "boardgamehonor": {"8416": "2009 Golden Geek Best Wargame Nominee"}, "description": "Massive tank battles for the historical wargame that Eurogamers love to play!<br/><br/>Storms of Steel! makes you a witness to the greatest tank battle in history!

Berg, covering two of the Duke&rsquo;s great victories in the War of the Spanish Succession: Ramillies, a massive cavalry clash, and Malplaquet, a hue infantry battle. The period in which Marlborough fought was a transition between the musket-and-pike era and the more fluid, if still massed, tactics that emerged with Frederick the Great. The key transitional mechanic was the invention of the socket bayonet, which allowed gun-armed infantry to use their weapon for shock as well as fire combat. The battles fought in the War of the Spanish Succession were the first major engagements in which that innovation was used, and the commanders hadn&rsquo;t yet learned to appreciate its value. Warfare in that era was therefore mostly still formalized, rigid and stolid.<br/><br/>The map scale is 225 yards per hex. Each double-length infantry unit is composed of, on an average, four battalions and contains about 2,000 to 3,000 tightly packed men. The square infantry counters (for use in Malplaquet) each represent about half that number. Cavalry units each contain about five or six squadrons, about 600 mounted men. Artillery units each represent 12 to 18 guns. There is no per-turn time scale, as there are no distinct game turns. The game simply starts and then keeps going until one player wins.

Historically, the RAF won the Battle, and Adolf Hitler called off the invasion, sending his forces east in a fateful decision to attack the Soviet Union in 1941. In Britain Stands Alone, players are under no compulsion to repeat this, and instead the decisive campaign of World War II will take place on the shores of the United Kingdom.<br/><br/>Since the map covers all of England, and not just the historically-planned invasion beaches around Dover, the players have enormous freedom to explore other possibilities. Would East Anglia be a better landing site than Kent? Or the West Country? Maybe the Germans would want to make a direct attempt to seize the ports of Southampton and Portsmouth? All of these possibilities, and many more, are within the scope of Britain Stands Alone.<br/><br/>In addition, Britain Stands Alone comes with a wealth of further variants. The Germans might have enhanced naval forces, such as the famed battleship Bismarck joining the Kriegsmarine a year early, or the Germans might have lost fewer torpedo boats and destroyers in the previous campaign for Norway.  Maybe instead of using nothing but jerry rigged river and canal boats for landing craft, Germany manages to develop purpose-built boats similar to the LCT's employed by the Allies in World War II.<br/><br/>On the British side, there are variants for greater Free French involvement, including by elements of the French navy, more arms from the Americans, and more tanks.<br/><br/>The original edition of Britain Stands Alone, published by GMT Games, remains popular, yet is now out of print.  The Lock 'n Load Publishing edition will not be a straight reprint, but a major upgrade of a title already held in high regard.  Players can look forward to incorporation of all errata to date, fresh development, additional validation of all systems, and even more variants.<br/><br/>Of course too, Britain Stands Alone will have updated graphics that gamers have come to expect from Lock 'n Load Publishing. Designed by Jim Werbaneth, three-time Charles S. Roberts Award winner, Britain Stands Alone offers a very playable operational treatment of one of the most important campaigns that never happened.<br/><br/>Re-implements<br/><br/>    Britain Stands Alone<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>"}, "38832": {"boardgamedesigner": {"4574": {"name": "Didier Guiserix"}}, "poll": {}, "name": "En chasse, Mister Zap", "playingtime": "30", "minplayers": "2", "yearpublished": "1983", "usersrated": "2", "boardgamefamily": {"9815": "Magazine: Casus Belli"}, "maxplayers": "2", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic379334_t.jpg", "average": "5.25", "statistics": {}, "boardgamepublisher": {"3925": {"name": "Casus Belli"}}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic379334.jpg", "boardgameversion": {"31160": "Casus Belli magazine edition"}, "maxplaytime": "30", "boardgamecategory": {"1010": {"name": "Fantasy"}}, "age": "0", "minplaytime": "30", "description": "This game is published by the French magazine Casus Belli (Issue 14 - Apr 1983).<br/>Each player represents the guardian of the temple and its troops.<br/>Two are competing to be the sole guardian of the temple.<br/>Map Din A4, grid and 16 pieces.<br/><br/>"}, "38833": {"boardgamedesigner": {"2098": {"name": "Juan Rodriguez"}}, "poll": {}, "name": "La nuit de l'Esprit", "playingtime": "30", "minplayers": "3", "boardgamemechanic": {"2028": "Role Playing"}, "yearpublished": "1983", "usersrated": "1", "boardgamefamily": {"9815": "Magazine: Casus Belli"}, "maxplayers": "6", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic379339_t.jpg", "average": "5", "statistics": {}, "boardgamepublisher": {"3925": {"name": "Casus Belli"}}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic379339.jpg", "boardgameversion": {"31163": "Casus Belli magazine edition"}, "maxplaytime": "30", "boardgamecategory": {"1039": {"name": "Deduction"}}, "age": "0", "minplaytime": "30", "description": "This game is published by the French magazine Casus Belli (Issue 16 - Aug 1983).<br/>Boardgame close to the role, in which players must destroy the spirit avoiding panic.<br/>17 counters and map house in Din A4.<br/><br/>"}, "38834": {"boardgamedesigner": {"2098": {"name": "Juan Rodriguez"}}, "poll": {}, "name": "Objectif CCT 001", "playingtime": "30", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": {"2055": "Paper-and-Pencil"}, "yearpublished": "1984", "usersrated": "1", "boardgamefamily": {"9815": "Magazine: Casus Belli"}, "maxplayers": "4", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic379347_t.jpg", "average": "5.5", "statistics": {}, "boardgamepublisher": {"3925": {"name": "Casus Belli"}}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic379347.jpg", "boardgameversion": {"31733": "Casus Belli magazine edition"}, "maxplaytime": "30", "boardgamecategory": {"1016": {"name": "Science Fiction"}}, "age": "0", "minplaytime": "30", "description": "This game is published by the French magazine Casus Belli (Issue 20 - Apr 1984).<br/>The map is an icosahedron represents a satellite of energy that must be defended one player, others players trying to get hold of the CST.<br/>The movement is simultaneous.<br/>Map size Din A3 and 11 counters.<br/><br/>"}, "38836": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic639323.jpg", "poll": {}, "boardgamedesigner": {"898": {"name": "Mike Joslyn"}}, "statistics": {}, "yearpublished": "2010", "maxplayers": "2", "boardgameartist": {"11882": "Craig Grando"}, "boardgamepublisher": {"1244": {"name": "Against the Odds"}}, "maxplaytime": "240", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic639323_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "240", "boardgamecategory": {"2726": {"name": "Age of Reason"}}, "boardgamehonor": {"21174": "2010 Charles S.

The object of British efforts in the South was to bring the four southern colonies - Georgia, South Carolina, North Carolina and Virginia-back under British sway after almost four years of uninterrupted Continental control. Ideally, the English wanted to &quot;restore civil government,&quot; i.e., to return the South to its status ante-bellum with British governors, taxes paid to the Crown, and no expensive garrison to enforce the situation.<br/><br/>&quot;Tarleton's Quarter!&quot; highlights some salient aspects of the British campaign in the south. First and foremost was the effect of leadership, and the difficulty both sides had in finding leaders who were bold without being rash. Rarely did energy and sound judgment come in the same package. Another vital factor was the terrain of the southern colonies, or rather, one feature of it: water. The reason that water &mdash; in the form of rivers and swamps &mdash; is the dominant terrain feature is &mdash; surprise! &mdash; it rained a lot, particularly in the Carolinas. These facts &quot;on the ground&quot; raise the amount of non-combat losses, like those caused by disease, which made just keeping an army intact such a headache at the time. (There's nothing romantic about losing large numbers of men to something beyond a player's control.) As to why so many people lived in North and South Carolinas' pestilential swamps, it was because those swampy areas were precisely where rice and indigo grew best, and in the 18th century in the Carolinas, that was where the money was; cotton was a much later development.<br/><br/>Perhaps the most important factor of all was the continuing British belief in an untapped reservoir of loyalist support in the south. Those in command of the British army knew they didn't have enough manpower to control even the southern half of the American colonies on their own. They were relying on the appearance of a &quot;silent majority&quot; of loyal, but previously suppressed, American subjects who would take control of those provinces swept of Continental forces. Appropriately, you are allowed to indulge in as much over-confidence as your red coat will allow.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": {"252323": "First edition"}, "average": "7.39394", "name": "\"Tarleton's Quarter!\"", "playingtime": "240", "boardgamemechanic": {"2080": "Area Control / Area Influence"}, "age": "0", "usersrated": "33", "boardgamesubdomain": {"4664": "Wargames"}, "boardgamefamily": {"134": "Magazine: Against The Odds"}}, "38837": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic502843.jpg", "poll": {}, "boardgamedesigner": {"484": {"name": "Ted Raicer"}}, "statistics": {}, "yearpublished": "2009", "maxplayers": "2", "boardgameartist": {"11882": "Craig Grando"}, "boardgamepublisher": {"1244": {"name": "Against the Odds"}}, "maxplaytime": "240", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic502843_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "240", "boardgamecategory": {"1019": {"name": "Wargame"}}, "boardgamehonor": {"21218": "2009 Charles S. Roberts Best Magazine Game Nominee"}, "description": "The Pocket at Falaise is a game on the final phase of the Allied campaign in Normandy. After the failure of Hitler&rsquo;s counterattack in early August to halt the Allied breakout from Normandy, the German 7th and 5th Panzer Armies found themselves on the verge of being pocketed by converging American and British pincers. On the evening of August 16th the Germans began to pull back behind the Orne and Dives rivers, hoping to regroup for a defense of the Seine, even as the Allies attempted to close the trap on some twentyfive German divisions. Ultimately, about half the German forces in the pocket escaped, leaving almost all their heavy equipment behind. It was a major Allied victory, but not a war-winning one.<br/><br/>At the end of the Gulf War in '91, cable TV news was full of horrific photos from the &quot;Highway of Death,&quot; the route back to Iraq from Kuwait that seemed, almost literally, to be &quot;paved&quot; with burnt-out vehicles. Those who study WWII remember similar destruction... on the road out of the Falaise Pocket... where 25 German divisions raced for survival, while the Allied armies aimed to turn Hitler's delayed counterattack on Normandy from failure to war-ending disaster. In one sense, neither side succeeded. But the devastation was something unprecedented.<br/><br/>Now, you have a chance to do better. The Pocket at Falaise puts each player in the difficult position of trying to overcome the obstacles, both human and mechanical, tactical and operational, that interfered with success in 1944. Award-winning designer Ted Racier explains:<br/><br/>The story of the Falaise battle is that of two German armies trying to escape a trap set for them by their own high command, and of the Allied armies trying to close the trap, despite the hesitations and divisions of their own higher commanders.<br/><br/>While we may think of the Allies as having overwhelming forces, at the actual point of contact, there were relatively weak units trying to &quot;plug the leak&quot; against overwhelming numbers of intensely motivated Germans. The situation means that the &quot;retreating&quot; Germans are actually forced to do a lot of attacking, while the &quot;advancing&quot; allies found themselves in a desperate defense. The Pocket at Falaise uses a chit-pull activation system to capture some of the chaotic and uncoordinated efforts. Players are forced to juggle to make the best out of an increasingly difficult situation, and a combat scale that straddles &quot;tactical&quot; and &quot;operational,&quot; aiming to capture the best of both without adding a lot of fiddly rules. A complete set of solitaire rules for the game completes the package.<br/><br/>Eisenhower called it, &quot;The Great Killing Ground.&quot; What the Germans called it cannot be printed.

As the Spanish player you will need to determine where you will build your siege gun redoubts and will then have to protect your soldiers from raiding British units to finish the works in time to mount an effective bombardment. As the British player, you have far fewer forces, but armed with special raiding rules, your Regulars, Tories and Indian allies must harass and erode Spanish morale, while delaying the construction of Spanish siege works for as long as possible in the hope of keeping your three forts intact to face the coming coup de main.<br/><br/>The game begins with Don Bernardo de Galvez&rsquo;s army of 5,000 having just landed on the mainland. How many forces actually are present is decided in a special phase during the initial set-up wherein that portion of the Spanish army that sailed from Havana must run the gauntlet of the Red Cliffs Fort guns. Hence, the starting forces for Spain are likely to be different for each game played as units and leaders are eliminated or delayed in their arrival. Once these forces are ashore, the Spanish player faces some hard choices. Does he send forces to take out the Red Cliffs Fort, to protect his turn 7 Spanish and French reinforcements from having to run the same gauntlet, or does the Spanish player immediately begin construction of the siege works, to achieve the longest possible bombardment before the coup de main?<br/><br/>The British player is outnumbered, but must employ his small forces in aggressive and often risky raids to slow down siege construction, wear down Spanish morale and worry the Spanish lines of supply. Getting a small force into one of two Spanish stockades can be devastating for the Spanish. Thus, though numerically superior, the Spanish player has much to do and protect, and will often be spread thin by a well-conceived series of raids. Giving the Spanish too many siege turns to bombard your three forts and/or permitting the Spanish to launch the coup de main with high army morale is likely to spell disaster for the British player.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": {"67344": "First edition"}, "average": "7.21672", "name": "Pensacola", "playingtime": "360", "boardgamemechanic": {"2026": "Hex-and-Counter"}, "age": "0", "usersrated": "61", "boardgamesubdomain": {"4664": "Wargames"}, "boardgamefamily": {"54": "Battles of the American Revolution"}}, "38871": {"boardgamedesigner": {"11262": {"name": "Steve Wagner"}}, "poll": {}, "name": "Bounce-Off", "playingtime": "15", "minplayers": "1", "boardgamemechanic": {"2019": "Partnerships"}, "yearpublished": "2008", "usersrated": "1", "boardgamefamily": {"5552": "Finger Flicking Games"}, "maxplayers": "6", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic404493_t.jpg", "average": "7", "statistics": {}, "boardgamepublisher": {"772": {"name": "(Unpublished)"}}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic404493.jpg", "boardgameversion": {"189623": "First edition"}, "maxplaytime": "15", "boardgamecategory": {"1032": {"name": "Action / Dexterity"}}, "age": "0", "minplaytime": "15", "description": "This game is a mix of Pitchcar and Bowling with a twist.<br/><br/>Each player begins with 4 wooden circles, which are flicked one per turn.
