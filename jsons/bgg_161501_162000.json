Each location features three different primary days with five different hunts available from the start of the region. In Cabela's Big Game Hunter 2012 animals can see, hear and smell you. The game features a big variety of environments available including lush forests, dry deserts, craggy mountains, flooded plains, scorching savannas and the freezing tundra. The game also features multiple scenarios where &quot;decisions&quot; will have to be made. Each region features a variety of animals each specific to the environments in which can be hunted throughout the game.<br/><br/>The game incorporates many new elements not found in previous main series games, such as having shooting blinds, shooting rests and tree stands, a caller, and other things to aid the player. But other new things are implemented in this game to work against the player. Animals now have an improved and more realistic AI, meaning they could see, smell, or hear you if you make a wrong move. Similar to Dangerous Hunts, predators can randomly surprise the player by jumping out of a bush or off a cliff, and time is slowed down so the player can shoot before it kills you. Getting to your target is now more challenging with the implementation of stealth hunts and timed hunts. Stealth hunts are when the males are not within reach and the player must use stealth and cover (usually thick bushes, logs, and rock formations)to avoid does, noisy terrain, and other animals like birds. The player is also given a device called a UTD that measures your presence to the animals. A low-pitched beep means that the animals can't detect you, while high-pitched beeps tells the player that animals have spotted the player and they will run away. A timed hunt is activated either when you reach your target, a predator or another force could disturb the animals and the player must kill it in a certain amount of time; or when the animals appear as a large herd and the player must kill a certain amount of males before time runs out. Many birds and small mammals roam around for the player to shoot at their leisure. Sometimes the player can reach a hidden area, where they have an opportunity to photograph rare animals and natural behaviors. There's also a gun store where players can buy, customize, and upgrade their weapons.<br/><br/>The game also features multiplayer where players can create either an area found in campaign mode, or customize their own. Players can create custom animals, which they can hunt with friends. Players can set challenges to compete in hunting the rarest animals and like Campaign mode, players can also buy and customize their weapons for each type of situation (a typical weapon is usually a variation of a scoped hunting rifle). There are multiple shooting galleries like arcade, where you can kill as many animals as want, or reflex which tests your hunting skills by instructing the player to kill certain animals in a chronological order. The game is planned to be released packaged with the Top Shot Elite, a plastic peripheral for the Wii controller.<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;Cabela's Big Game Hunter 2012&quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "161808": {"statistics": {}, "name": "Destiny of Spirits", "videogamemode": {"2149": "Single-Player"}, "videogameversion": {"244791": "PlayStation Vita Downloadable edition"}, "average": "0", "videogametheme": {"2148": "Fantasy"}, "usersrated": "0", "videogamegenre": {"2155": "RPG"}, "videogameplatform": {"10373": "PlayStation Vita"}, "poll": {}, "description": "Destiny of Spirits is a free-to-play online social strategy game with RPG elements exclusively for the PlayStation Vita.

News spread around the world and the era of the 49&rsquo;ers began. Thousands of young people left their farms and homes to make their fortunes out west.<br/><br/>As these pioneers swarmed to California, hundreds of mining camps sprang up throughout the Mother Lode. Eight miles from the gold discovery site, a camp known as &ldquo;Old Dry Diggins&rdquo; was established. By 1849, it became known as &ldquo;Hangtown.&rdquo;  There are many stories as to how this infamous nickname came to be, but the most common is that in January of 1849, after a very brief trial, three men were hung from a large oak tree near the corner of Main and Center Streets&mdash;an act of swift justice, as they say.<br/><br/>In April and again in July of 1856, most of Old Hangtown, now bearing the name Placerville, was destroyed by fire. Buildings were ultimately built of brick and stone thereafter. In addition, a large bell tower was erected in the center of town as a fire warning system. By then, people had begun to value the area for more than just mining. The region had an abundance of lumber and rich agricultural land, making it perfectly situated to grow into a thriving community.<br/><br/>____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________<br/><br/>In the game of Hangtown, players become Gold Rush era Pioneers who are competing for riches, resources, property, and prestige. &hellip;They must also be prepared to deal with outlaws, shootouts, and hangings at the infamous Hangman&rsquo;s Tree!<br/><br/>The game features a thoughtful variety of streamlined mechanics, which are notably innovative, yet traditional and familiar in feel&mdash;such as fresh spins on tableau building, worker placement, simultaneous action selection, variable turn order, and resource and hand management.<br/><br/>Some of the best strategies in Hangtown rely on a balance between optimizing one&rsquo;s own scheme and cunningly &ldquo;playing the players&rdquo;. A standout theme in the game is &ldquo;Boom or Bust&rdquo;. If a player can get &ldquo;out of phase&rdquo; for a turn, he or she will profit from a &ldquo;Boom yield&rdquo; and get bonuses, while the other players may go &ldquo;Bust&rdquo; and get very little. But of course, this takes sharp wits and some clever guesswork&hellip;<br/><br/>The game is played in a series of rounds, which break down into a series of turns and phases. In a turn, each player selects one card that will determine the phase that his or her Pioneer will take action in. When the players are ready, they simultaneously reveal their chosen cards and place their Pioneer pawns in the corresponding yield sites on the board.<br/><br/>Then the phases are resolved in numeric order as the players take their Pioneers&rsquo; actions. The total number of Pioneers in each yield site determines whether the outcome is Boom or Bust. To whatever degree, the different site actions allow the players to place workers, activate workers, collect resources, and add cards to their face-up tableau areas of historic buildings, districts, and monuments. Every card built in a tableau grants the player new abilities as well as Victory Points for the final scoring.<br/><br/>After each turn is completed, the looming Outlaw pawn advances into the next section of the board, locking that particular yield site into a Bust outcome. Furthermore, when the Outlaw lands in the last section, it triggers a &ldquo;Final Shootout&rdquo;! In this special phase, all of the players must defend themselves against the Outlaw&rsquo;s bold attack by using gunmen positioned on Main Street. If the players beat the Outlaw, they gain additional Victory Points as a reward. But if they fail, they must send their lost gunmen to their early graves in the Union Cemetery&hellip;<br/><br/>The Wild West theme of the game is based closely on the California Gold Rush of 1849 through the turn of the century. The city of Placerville, also known as Old Hangtown, has a rich history, which has been worked into the game at every juncture. For instance, the town cards feature historic landmarks such as the Bell Tower, Soda Works, and Studebaker Wheelbarrow Shop; while the periodic &ldquo;Events&rdquo; feature the Wagon Train, mail delivery from Snowshoe Thompson, and digging up The Mother Lode at Gold Bug Mine. Many beautifully restored historic photographs and illustrations are included as well.<br/><br/>Hangtown plays wonderfully with two to six players, and it can be set to play in two separate modes: Discovery for newcomers and casual gamers, and Highgrade for seasoned gamers and experienced players. The modes appeal to a wide range of folks and settings&mdash;from light family fun to heavy brain burning. The game also includes an expansion that opens up bidding on several character roles. These roles, such as the Robber, Deputy, Prospector, and Gunslinger, allow each player to use a unique special ability for one entire round at a time.<br/><br/>The game offers many paths to victory and great replayability.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": {"244812": "English first edition"}, "average": "7.54239", "name": "Hangtown", "playingtime": "90", "boardgamemechanic": {"2664": "Deck / Pool Building"}, "age": "13", "boardgameexpansion": {}, "usersrated": "46", "boardgamefamily": {"8374": "Crowdfunding: Kickstarter"}}, "161814": {"average": "0", "poll": {}, "name": "Eine Reise durch Deutschland", "playingtime": "0", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": {"2078": "Point to Point Movement"}, "yearpublished": "0", "usersrated": "0", "boardgamefamily": {"10643": "Country: Germany"}, "maxplayers": "6", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2063795_t.jpg", "boardgameartist": {"76295": "Max Fuhrmann"}, "statistics": {}, "boardgamepublisher": {"3320": {"name": "(Unknown)"}}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2063795.jpg", "boardgameversion": {"244816": "First edition"}, "maxplaytime": "0", "boardgamecategory": {"1031": {"name": "Racing"}}, "age": "0", "minplaytime": "0", "description": "This is a promotional board game for &quot;Hederich-Kainit&quot; and &quot;Kali-D&uuml;nger&quot;.<br/><br/>The players travel from Berlin (space 1) to B&uuml;ckeberg (space 90).

At ten o&rsquo;clock, the charge of the Royalist gendarmes hit the first line of Huguenot cavalry despite the deadly fire of the artillery commanded by Sully.

Planetary Reign is a space civilization game based on classic video games of the same genre from the 1980's and 90's in which each player is the leader of a space-faring empire that is attempting to expand into and exploit the riches of a new-found galaxy. Planetary Reign provides a rich 4X experience without an overly complex rule-set and can be played within a couple of hours.<br/><br/>As a leader of THULE, VEYNA, METHIOS or CALDERA, you will assign your workers to a variety of actions - choosing which, when and how often they will be performed - with the ultimate goal being to dominate the galaxy and ensure the survival of your people. Your empire will build, upgrade and send its fleets into a galaxy to explore its unknown worlds. There, you will encounter planets with strange environments, hosts of alien species and a variety of resources as well as occasionally running into your opponents.<br/><br/>The main mechanics employed in Planetary Reign are worker placement, area control and a new specie assimilation mechanic. With nearly 5 years in development, Planetary Reign has been designed for players who enjoy medium to heavy games with low luck factors.

There are 6 tile series with different pictures. 3 series of 16 tiles each (steamboat, wonder machine, sun flower), 2 series of 9 tiles each (flowers of the spring, bird), 1 series of 6 tiles (helicopter). The basic idea is that one tile of each series has the least amount of small details, another one the greatest amount of details (like with or without doorknow depicted, a bee with or without wings etc.). These cards must be sorted according to the amount of details picted from least to most in ascending order. A check is possible by turing the tiles around. On each tile back is one half of an animal or thing - horse, train car etc. If the cards are in correct order those halves match.<br/><br/>The rulebook suggests 3 games:<br/>1) Solo game: The solo player takes one or more tile series, shuffles them and must lay them in the correct order. <br/>2) Group game: The short helicopter series is done away with. Each player gets one tile series (well shuffled). Players start to put their series in order. The first player to do this wins - if he did correctly. This can be done with one round or in several rounds. If rounds are played the player who finishes first and has his order correct he gets victory points equal to the number of tiles in the series plus 5 extra points. The other players get one victory point for each tile that is in correct order. For the next round the series are shuffled again and each player gets another series than before.<br/>3) What is disappeared: A series is laid on the table in random order.

Due to lack of resources, each Panopticon has developed conflicts with others, and large portions of the populace are forced into serving sentences in order for these cities to maintain effective control. All inhabitants of a Panopticon are constantly watched by the state to ensure they abide by the draconian laws put into place, essentially forming a collective of dystopian surveillance societies at war with one another.<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;Freedom Wars,&quot; available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "161878": {"statistics": {}, "name": "The Rifter (Issue 66 - May 2014)", "rpgproducer": {"13722": "Alex Marciniszyn"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2903662.jpg", "usersrated": "0", "average": "0", "rpgissue": {"1954": "The Rifter"}, "rpgissuearticle": {"178120": "Bite of the Snake Men"}, "rpg": {"341": "Heroes Unlimited"}, "rpgissueversion": {"301956": "PDF version"}, "poll": {}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2903662_t.jpg", "description": "From the Publishers Blurb<br/><br/>The Rifter&reg; #66 offers a variety of source material, monsters, baddies and information.

You define the struggles of a post-apocalyptic community, and attempt to build something good within their quiet year. Every decision and every action is set against a backdrop of dwindling time and rising concern.<br/>For a long time, we were at war with The Jackals. But now, we&rsquo;ve driven them off, and we have this &ndash; a year of relative peace. One quiet year, with which to build our community up and learn once again how to work together. Come Winter, the Frost Shepherds will arrive and we might not survive beyond that. But we don&rsquo;t know about that yet. What we know is that right now, in this moment, there is an opportunity to build something.<br/><br/>The game plays through a year of relative peace for a small post-apocalyptic community. Players take turns playing through weeks in this year. Each week, the active player draws a card from the top of the deck (which represents the year), and reads the card. They carry out the actions or answer the questions that are specified on the card. Once the card is resolved, some quick upkeep occurs: projects that the community has in motion get closer to completion. Finally, the active player picks an action from a short list: hold a discussion, make a decision, discover something new.<br/><br/>The three actions give players a meaningful and difficult set of choices: do you spend time listening to others, in the hopes that they'll listen to you in kind? Do you pursue your own goals, ostensibly for the good of the whole community? Do you focus inward or outward?<br/><br/>The game is played using a deck of cards &ndash; each of the 52 cards corresponds to a week during the quiet year. Each card triggers certain events &ndash; bringing bad news, good omens, project delays and sudden changes in luck.

At the beginning, the game starts very similar to basic Pandemic, in which your team of disease-fighting specialists races against the clock to travel around the world, treating disease hotspots while researching cures for each of four plagues before they get out of hand.<br/><br/>During a player's turn, they have four actions available, with which they may travel around in the world in various ways (sometimes needing to discard a card), build structures like research stations, treat diseases (removing one cube from the board; if all cubes of a color have been removed, the disease has been eradicated), trade cards with other players, or find a cure for a disease (requiring five cards of the same color to be discarded while at a research station). Each player has a unique role with special abilities to help them at these actions.<br/><br/>After a player has taken their actions, they draw two cards. These cards can include epidemic cards, which will place new disease cubes on the board, and can lead to an outbreak, spreading disease cubes even further. Outbreaks additionally increase the panic level of a city, making that city more expensive to travel to.<br/><br/>Each month in the game, you have two chances to achieve that month's objectives. If you succeed, you win and immediately move on to the next month. If you fail, you have a second chance, with more funding for beneficial event cards.<br/><br/>During the campaign, new rules and components will be introduced. These will sometimes require you to permanently alter the components of the game; this includes writing on cards, ripping up cards, and placing permanent stickers on components. Your characters can gain new skills, or detrimental effects. A character can even be lost entirely, at which point it's no longer available for play.<br/><br/>Part of the Pandemic series<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": {"296084": "Brazilian first edition (blue)"}, "average": "8.6686", "rpgpodcastepisode": {"178325": "Episode 50"}, "name": "Pandemic Legacy: Season 1", "playingtime": "60", "boardgamemechanic": {"2001": "Action Point Allowance System"}, "age": "13", "usersrated": "19079", "boardgamesubdomain": {"5497": "Strategy Games"}, "boardgamefamily": {"24281": "Campaign Games"}}, "161937": {"boardgamedesigner": {"76346": {"name": "Wilhelm Ridderstad"}}, "statistics": {}, "name": "Taktiskt relief-krigsspel", "playingtime": "0", "minplayers": "0", "yearpublished": "1884", "usersrated": "0", "maxplayers": "0", "average": "0", "boardgamepublisher": {"4": {"name": "(Self-Published)"}}, "boardgameversion": {"245177": "Swedish first edition"}, "maxplaytime": "0", "poll": {}, "age": "0", "minplaytime": "0", "description": "Tactical wargame designed for military training, played by two players or teams plus an umpire.

There are 9 of them (different for each game) and they are not only very powerful, but also very expensive. But money means nothing, when there's academic pride at stake! And the possession of these artifacts will definitely earn you some reputation too.

Apart from the traditional 22 cards, it contains optional extra cards (Strength, Sword, Wizard, Wolf, and the kickstarter-exclusive The Beginning).<br/><br/>Publisher Summary<br/>The Deck of Many Things is a legendary artifact in tabletop roleplaying games such as Dungeons and Dragons and Pathfinder.  It was introduced to D&amp;D in 1975, in the Greyhawk rules supplement to the original game (the very first D&amp;D supplement ever released).  It has continued to appear in RPG publications ever since, its run of almost four decades making it one of the most legendary items in the  RPG world.<br/><br/>A Deck of Many Things is usually found in a box or leather pouch. Each deck contains a number of cards or plaques made of ivory or vellum. Each is engraved with glyphs, characters, and sigils. As soon as one of these cards is drawn from the pack, its magic is bestowed upon the person who drew it, for better or worse.  The character with a deck of many things who wishes to draw a card must announce how many cards she will draw before she begins. Cards must be drawn within 1 hour of each other, and a character can never draw from this deck any more cards than she has announced. If the character does not willingly draw her allotted number (or if she is somehow prevented from doing so), the cards flip out of the deck on their own. If the Idiot or Jester is drawn, the possessor of the deck may elect to draw additional cards.  Each time a card is taken from the deck, it is replaced (making it possible to draw the same card twice) unless the draw is the Jester or Fool, which are discarded when drawn.<br/><br/>A classic Deck of Many Things contains 22 cards, but the Analog Games LLC Deck of Many Things includes four new cards as a result of stretch goals requested and unlocked by our Kickstarter backers.  Traditionalists may, of course, choose to leave these cards out of their Deck when using it in play.  Our deck is also composed of entirely original artwork, both front and back.

Prentice employed illustrators to produce bright graphics in his games and utilized high quality materials as well.<br/><br/>From the rules:<br/><br/>SETTING UP THE GAME. The playing board with the colored chart is placed in the center of the table. The playing cards are lined up with the four packs of picture cards, face up, on one side of the playing board. They should be in this order: Freshman, Sophomore, Junior and Senior. On the other side of the board the four packs of Fun, Sports, Re-Exam and Flunk cards should be placed with these words up. The chips are divided among the players so that each has an equal amount of l's, 2's, 3's, 5's and 10's.<br/><br/>PLAYING THE GAME. The player on the left of the host plays first As a Freshman entering I. O. U., he stands up each time he plays. If he fails to remember this, he must draw a Flunk card as a penalty, altnougn he does not miss his turn. He pays 5 chips, registration fee, to the business office. He then rolls the dice on the playing board as he tries to pass his first course. Only the dice which remain on the board alter rolling , may be counted, using only the top numbers. He multiplies the dice total by ten to find his grade for the course. After rolling the dice, the player proceeds all follows: If, after multiplying, his grade comes to 120: he must pay 2 chips to petty expense, on the playing board, placing the chips so they do not interfere with the chart. If his grade is 110, he must pay 1 chip. This means he has tried too hard to pass. In either case he rolls the dice again, right away. If his grade is 100, 90, 80 or 70, he can draw the top Freshman Course card and keep it. He also must take or put chips into petty expense as indicated opposite his grade on the chart. If there are not enough chips to take, he is out of luck, and can take only what is there. This happens quite frequently throughout the game. If his grade is 60, 50 or 40, he must place on playing board the indicated number of &quot;put&quot; chips. He then has his choice of drawing a Fun, Sport or Re-Exam card. He must read his card aloud and after fulfilling the duties, he returns it to the bottom of the same pack. <br/>If his grade is 30, 20 or 10, he must place on playing board the indicated number of &quot;put&quot; chips. He then has to take a Flunk card and follow its instructions before returning it to bottom of pack. If both dice roll off the playing board he receives a zero, and must place 15 chips on the board and draw a Flunk card. As soon as a player has completed his turn, the next player on his left rolls the dice to obtain his grade for his first Freshman course, and so on. To pass Freshman year and become a Sophomore, a player must hold two Freshman Course cards. The first to finish Freshman year receives all chips in Petty Expense. As soon as each player finishes his first year he must pay 5 chips, registration fee for Sophomore year, to the business office. Sophomore year is the same as Freshman year, only players may now be seated while playing. Sophomores must have two Soph Course cards before becoming Juniors. The first to finish receives all chips in petty expense. As soon as players finish Sophomore year they pay 5 chips, registration fee for Junior year, to the business office. Junior year proceeds the same as Sophomore year. The first to finish receives all chips in petty expense. As soon as a player gets two Junior Course cards he must pay 5 chips, registration fee for Senior year, to the business office. Seniors must obtain the usual two Senior Course cards before graduation. The first to finish Senior year receives all chips petty expense and IMMEDIATELY the game is ended.<br/><br/>"}, "161503": {"poll": {}, "name": "From Sailor Boy to Admiral", "playingtime": "0", "minplayers": "0", "boardgamemechanic": {"2035": "Roll / Spin and Move"}, "yearpublished": "1900", "usersrated": "0", "maxplayers": "0", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2057983_t.jpg", "average": "0", "statistics": {}, "boardgamepublisher": {"7198": {"name": "C.W.

Those with deception in their hearts will find no end of uses for mythic disguise self, which can not only allow you to take on the form of creatures of any type, and even appear to be notably larger or smaller, but also lets you duplicate tactile and auditory elements, while those who want to uncover the truth will be equally well-served by mythic discern lies, which denies non-mythic creatures a saving throw, and reveals when someone withholds information, as well as when they give false information.<br/><br/>"}, "161516": {"rpg": {"2791": "Pathfinder System Compatible Product"}, "poll": {}, "name": "Giants", "rpgproducer": {"14055": "Rick Hershey"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2115566.jpg", "usersrated": "0", "rpgitemversion": {"244317": "PDF version"}, "average": "0", "statistics": {}, "rpggenre": {"155": "Fantasy (High Fantasy)"}, "rpgcategory": {"2108": "Sourcebook (rules/options to enhance play)"}, "rpgseries": {"23661": "Mythic Monsters"}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2115566_t.jpg", "description": "From publisher blurb:<br/><br/>The 14th volume in our Mythic Monsters series, Mythic Monsters: Giants brings you a dozen and one terrifying titans to shake, rattle, and roll your heroes until they are battered, bloody, and beaten. From true giants that tower over the lesser races to bloodthirsty trolls and ogres that are scarcely more than beasts. Every culture on earth has its own myths and legends about giants, and RPGs themselves are no different, having established their own mythology, and few monsters are better suited to the mythic treatment than these towering tyrants. Here you will find all the classic RPG giants you have known and feared (and slain) since 1st Edition, including mysterious stone giant elders and savage frost giants, as well as gigantic cloud giants astride their cloudborne castles andthundering storm giants that rule both sea and sky. You will also find newer additions to the giant family, including tyrannical rune giants that seek to dominate their giant-kin with both strength and sorcery, and cruel three-armed athaches that kill for just for pleasure. Smaller members of the giant family are also found herein, from stealthy moss trolls, the indominatable rock trolls that fear nothing but the sight of the sun,and the nine-headed horrors called jotund trolls, as well as aquatic ogres known as merrows. Even in death, hulking brute wights bring the terror of the damned to all they face. In addition, we bring you the all-new angurboda, a vile shapeshifting ogress all too eager to seduce man, giant, beast, and every creature in between to give birth to a brood of monstrous beasts. As if these mythic giants were not enough, Mythic Monsters: Giants also discusses the unique role that giants play and how they interact with the rules, for good and for bad, and equips your mythic giants with a number of specialized tactics and feats that enhance their fighting prowess. The 13 giants contained herein, ranging in CR from 4 to 22, are updated for the mythic rules, and when we say updated we mean complete stat blocks, yes, but more than that every one of these massive menaces has its own unique and exciting new mythic abilities, from a mythic brute wight's terrifying bulk and corpse colossus to the clobbering critical and cloudscape of a mythic cloud giant!<br/><br/>"}, "161517": {"statistics": {}, "name": "Pack of Aces", "videogamemode": {"2422": "Local Multiplayer"}, "videogameversion": {"244320": "English Amstrad CPC Cassette edition"}, "average": "0", "videogametheme": {"2455": "Abstract"}, "usersrated": "0", "videogamegenre": {"2147": "Action"}, "videogameplatform": {"5203": "Amstrad CPC"}, "poll": {}, "videogamecompilation": {"71900": "Boulder Dash"}, "description": "User Summary<br/>Pack of Aces is a compilation of four games for the ZX Spectrum, Amstrad and Commodore 64 computers on cassette.

This is the first of nine releases planned for a fun deck building that can all be connected to play as one game.<br/><br/>The Avant Europa series allows you to walk through important times in the history of France and other nations of Europe. Have your own shot at impacting history by making the choices that change it. Witness the events that shaped the national histories of that era, and try to survive them while building your own political Empire.<br/><br/>The Avant Europa - Liberte storyline represents the viewpoint of various small noble factions. Starting out with a small Commune you build up your connections and influences in Politics, Lands, Trade, Economics, Goods, and Military. The goal is to protect France from it's enemies (inside and out), but also to be the one player with the most Victory Points amassed at the end of the game. As your Empire of influence grows at some point you can end up commanding great influence and power across Revolutionary France.<br/><br/>Players begin with a standard deck of 8-10 cards - depending on if playing the basic, intermediate, or advanced rules.   The game runs from 12 turns (basic) to 28 turns (full version), divided into turns called &quot;Seasons&quot;. At the beginning of each Season players draw four cards into hand. Play continues in Rounds until all but the last player have used or played all of the cards in their hand. That player gets one last Round of play and the Season ends.<br/><br/>Each Season player initiative is important because being First Player to start a Season gives that player first go at available cards in the Commons to purchase. Like many deck-building games there is the typical 1-and-1 Round, where a player can play 1 Action and gets 1 additional choice (usually to Purchase cards from the Commons that get added to the owners discard - and thus eventually to the players hand).<br/><br/>In addition players can move cards to their Domain, which reflects their public face to the world.  Cards in Domain are not discarded until used and can be played as if from hand. Many give special abilities and benefits that increase a players ability to response to other players actions, increase income generated by other cards, have special means of defense, etc.  To add even more color to game play these Domains can come with Asset cards that are unique to the controlling player and provide political flavour of the times to expand the options of game play.<br/><br/>This game is a very diverse peek into the life and times of the people of the era's it represents. Actual historical personalities and figures of the Revolution are available as Allies, along with the actual historically political factions, organizations, and local government forces of the day.<br/><br/>Unique mechanics include the ability to Raise Funds that the player can add to their treasury to help purchase cards, make bribes, and pay off Tax collectors -- which were the common bane of public that lead to the Revolution.  Other unique mechanics include the ability to place Bribes on cards in Commons area, the ability to Power Block some cards to prevent others from using or getting them. Players can engage in gathering Goods that can be sold on the open market for increased income. Players have the option of building up basic militia forces to protect themselves against common Bandits or foreign powers, or to use their military to defend against other players once the anger of the French Revolution and civil conflict goes into full swing.<br/><br/>Every card in the game has two or more uses, which is what makes provides the plethora of strategic choices and card combinations. The game promises no two play sessions of this game will be exactly the same, and it is easy to see why given the options. The game will certainly appeal to veteran card fans of games like L5R or Magic who appreciate the artistic details. It will also appeal to players who have played out their copies of Dominion and want something far more immensely real then Ascension or Thunderstone.<br/><br/>There are many roads to Victory, largely based on the acquisition of certain key cards of value -- especially getting control of Cities and Ports of France. This can be done many ways,  through political underhanded activities, military force, or economic control. The person with the most Victory Points accumulated at games end determines the winner.

Stockpile centers on the idea that nobody knows everything about the stock market, but everyone does know something. In the game, this philosophy manifests in two ways: insider information and the stockpile.<br/><br/>First, players are given insider information each round. This information dictates how a stock&rsquo;s value will change at the end of the round. By privately learning if a stock is going to move up or down, each player has a chance to act ahead of the market by buying or selling at the right time.<br/><br/>Second, players purchase their stocks by bidding on piles of cards called stockpiles. These stockpiles will contain a mixture of face-up and face-down cards placed by other players in the game. In this way, nobody will know all of the cards in the stockpiles. Not all cards are good either. Trading fees can poison the piles by making players pay more than they bid. By putting stocks and other cards up for auction, Stockpile catalyzes player interaction, especially when potential profits from insider information are on the line.<br/><br/>Both of these mechanisms are combined with some stock market elements to make players consider multiple factors when selling a stock. Do you hold onto a stock in hopes of catching a lucrative stock split or do you sell now to avoid the potential company bankruptcy? Can you hold onto your stock until the end of the game to become the majority shareholder, or do you need the liquidity of cash now for future bidding? Do you risk it all by investing heavily into one company, or do you mitigate your risk by diversifying your portfolio?<br/><br/>In the end, everyone knows something about the stock market, so it all comes down to strategy execution. Will you be able to navigate the movements of the stock market with certainty? Or will your investments go under from poor predictions?<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": {"315674": "Chinese first edition"}, "average": "7.63455", "name": "Stockpile", "playingtime": "45", "boardgamemechanic": {"2012": "Auction/Bidding"}, "age": "13", "boardgameexpansion": {}, "usersrated": "2747", "boardgamesubdomain": {"5499": "Family Games"}, "boardgamefamily": {"8374": "Crowdfunding: Kickstarter"}}, "161617": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2060116.png", "is_expanded_by": {"162529": {"name": "Dungeon Lords: Kickstarter Expansion Pack"}}, "poll": {}, "boardgamedesigner": {"789": {"name": "Vlaada Chv\u00e1til"}}, "statistics": {}, "boardgamecompilation": {"45315": "Dungeon Lords"}, "yearpublished": "2014", "maxplayers": "4", "boardgameartist": {"12692": "David Cochard"}, "boardgamepublisher": {"7345": {"name": "Czech Games Edition"}}, "maxplaytime": "90", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2060116_t.png", "minplaytime": "90", "boardgamecategory": {"1022": {"name": "Adventure"}}, "description": "Dungeon Lords: Happy Anniversary includes the Dungeon Lords base game, the Festival Season expansion, stickers for food tokens, metal coins, a new &quot;Dungeon Set-up&quot; mini-expansion, and other items.<br/><br/>In Dungeon Lords, you are an evil dungeon lord who is trying to build the best dungeon out there. You hire monsters, build rooms, buy traps and defeat the do-gooders who wish to bring you down. Each turn, players use a hand of cards to choose where to place their worker imps. Actions vary from mining gold, hiring monsters, buying traps etc. Each action has three spots available - with each spot having different effects (e.g., mining gold lets you mine more gold in each spot). When using the cards, two cards will become locked and will not be able to be used next turn.<br/><br/>The entire game lasts two &quot;game years&quot;, and each year consists of four seasons (a.k.a. turns). At the start of each season, players see the heroes and events to come in the following season, allowing them to prepare. At the end of each season after the first, heroes are allocated to each player according to the players' level of evilness. Heroes range from mighty heroes to sneaky thieves. Each hero has its own power for which the player needs to prepare for. At the end of each year, the heroes travel into the dungeons to fight.<br/><br/>Scoring in the game is based upon what you have built, the monsters you have hired and the heroes you have captured.<br/><br/>The Festival Season expansion adds a fifth season to the year:  festival season. More time to build your dungeon, but also more time for adventurers to gather a larger party. There are new monsters, rooms, and traps to prepare your dungeon for the battle, but also new nasty spells for the adventurers and sneaky bards who encourage them to perform so-called &quot;heroic&quot; deeds &ndash; not to mention two paladins for each year, now ready to punish up to two evil players.<br/><br/>Would you like to push other players toward evil instead of moving yourself toward good when visiting the city? What about making an investment instead of traditional gold digging? Or what about repairing conquered tunnels or rooms instead of digging new ones? Only eight actions are still available to you, but each season one of those actions is replaced by an alternate set of spaces that offer new and intriguing options.

Each card has a full color illustration on the front, and game play stats on the back. We have main event stars (like Superbandit, Goliath, all the way down to low carders like Tadpole). The unpredictability of the D24 die adds to the &quot;anything can happen&quot; feel of the game!<br/><br/>There are two versions of the game: basic and advanced. A &quot;basic&quot; match begins when two players roll the d24 to see which wrestler will start on offense. The player that gained control will then roll on his wrestler's offensive set (each wrestler has 24 moves, including their finisher(s)! For the offensive wrestler to stay in control, he must roll successfully vs. the skill rating (power, speed, technical, brawling, aerial and striking). The offensive wrestler loses control when he does not roll successfully vs. his skill rating; then the opponent takes over on offense (just like a real match!). When a wrestler hits their finisher, the opponent must roll their 3-Count or Submission Rating, plus the opponent's finisher rating, to see if he is defeated. If the opponent rolls their 3-Count Rating or below, the match is over and the opponent wins (there are also other random ways to win, such as pin scenarios on the &quot;Into the Ropes Action Chart&quot;).<br/><br/>The advanced game turns up the heat with more strategy options and player input. The advanced game allows a wrestler to attempt pins up to three times during the course of a match. Strength of moves is taken into account (some moves are more damaging than others). Maximum Damage Points from close pins/submission attempts, and finishers indicate how hurt a wrestler is, including blood! The advanced game also allows for wrestlers to use steel chairs and other foreign objects...but be careful, a disqualification may result! Other options found in the advanced version: exiting the ring, suicida moves, finisher counters, submission wrestling--you have four turns to get out of a basic submission move, and three for a submission finisher--or you tap out!<br/><br/>The game comes complete with a storyline that also allows you to take on the role of owner/booker/promoter and run your own version of WOX! Crown champions, develop feuds, determine rankings, create TV and house shows that culminate in pay per views! Schedule tournament and play nights or focus on the storyline element of the game...you're in charge!<br/><br/>"}, "161651": {"boardgamedesigner": {"3": {"name": "(Uncredited)"}}, "average": "0", "poll": {}, "name": "ASAT: Orbital Combat", "playingtime": "30", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": {"2070": "Simulation"}, "yearpublished": "2014", "usersrated": "0", "maxplayers": "2", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2079020_t.jpg", "boardgameartist": {"3": "(Uncredited)"}, "statistics": {}, "boardgamepublisher": {"32644": {"name": "Paper Forge"}}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2079020.jpg", "boardgameversion": {"244523": "First edition"}, "maxplaytime": "30", "boardgamecategory": {"1120": {"name": "Print & Play"}}, "age": "12", "minplaytime": "30", "description": "ASAT is a board game of orbital combat in the foreseeable future.

Get me off this Planet is that lift off points (space vehicles) are all different and often require multiple players to work together to take off.

Strange signs have started to appear all over the world: seas flecked with blood, flocks of shadowy figures wheeling in the sky, prophetic visions that leave people mumbling in addled madness. The time has finally come. The Old Ones are stirring, and it&rsquo;s your job to wake them up!<br/><br/>In Rise of Cthulhu you play as the leader of a cultist faction wishing to awaken Cthulhu and the other Old Ones awaken to rule this world. But a competing faction races against you to be the first to awaken these chaotic masters. By playing various numbered and colored Cultist Cards, you must control the prime Lovecraftian locations &ndash; Arkham, Dunwich, Innsmouth and Kingsport &ndash; in an effort to awaken an Old One. The faction that maintains the most influence on a location will gain favor when the Old One arises, while the losing faction risks the destruction of their sanity and souls. Through clever pairing of colored and numbered cards, players can summon dangerous Monster Cards to their aid, unlock the eldritch secrets of lost Artifact Cards, and even manipulate an Unspeakable Guardian to terrorize your opponent. All of this and more await the cunning and adventurous in this tactical card game of influence and horror for 2 players.<br/><br/>On your turn you will have 2 actions: you can either draw 2 cards, play 2 cards from your hand, or draw a card and play a card. Cards can be drawn from a face down deck of Cultist cards or a face up pile of discarded Cultists cards, known as the Valley. Cards must be played on your side of one of the four main Lovecraftian locations - Arkham, Dunwich, Innsmouth and Kingsport. The player with the most total points on a given location turns the location to face them, marking that location as being influenced by their cultists. As the values change during gameplay, locations will shift their influence from player to player. Playing three of the same color, three of the same number, or a run of three cards of the same color (ex. 2-3-4 of green) will earn players the right to draw from special Monster and Artifact cards to help their hold on locations or hinder their opponent. At key points in the game, Old Ones will be drawn from the Cultist Deck and attach themselves to a location: the player currently influencing that location will reap the benefits of the Old One. When all three Old Ones awaken, the game ends and the person with the most locations facing them (or points in play if there's a tie) is the winner.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": {"244613": "First edition"}, "average": "6.80454", "name": "Rise of Cthulhu", "playingtime": "30", "boardgamemechanic": {"2080": "Area Control / Area Influence"}, "age": "14", "boardgameexpansion": {}, "usersrated": "119", "boardgamesubdomain": {"5497": "Strategy Games"}, "boardgamefamily": {"8374": "Crowdfunding: Kickstarter"}}, "161720": {"poll": {}, "name": "Rumplestiltskin!", "playingtime": "0", "minplayers": "7", "boardgamemechanic": {"2073": "Acting"}, "yearpublished": "2014", "usersrated": "22", "boardgamefamily": {"22184": "Admin: Unreleased Games"}, "maxplayers": "20", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2600372_t.jpg", "average": "5.40909", "statistics": {}, "boardgamepublisher": {"24331": {"name": "Artistic Justice Games"}}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2600372.jpg", "boardgameversion": {"244614": "First edition"}, "maxplaytime": "0", "boardgamecategory": {"1023": {"name": "Bluffing"}}, "age": "0", "minplaytime": "0", "description": "Based on the popular game concept of Werewolf and Mafia, Rumplestiltskin offers a re-imagined take with our Fairytale Games theme.

They are suitable for any scale figures and any basing standard, the only requirement being that figures are organized into units of equal frontage. A typical game has around 8&mdash;15 units on each side, and games take around two to three hours. The rules are designed from a top-down perspective, focusing on outcomes rather than detail.<br/> Sword &amp; Spear features a clever and innovative system for activating units that creates interesting and challenging decisions, keeps both players involved at all times, and has a lot of depth and subtlety. Each turn is split into phases, where players each receive a number of action dice, which are rolled and then used to activate their units. The number shown on each dice determines which units can activate (with better quality units being easier to activate), what the unit can do when activated, and also determine the activation sequence. Certain dice also give bonuses to combat, movement distance, or shooting range. So there is a lot to think about, and allocating the action dice well is the key to success (although rolling lots of sixes helps as well!).<br/> The rules are relatively straightforward, and there are no &quot;to hit&quot; tables, charts, or lists of dieroll modifiers. They can be played using only the one-sided Quick Reference Sheet, with very little reference to the rulebook after the first couple of games.<br/> Army lists are available as free downloads online, covering a wide range of Ancient and Medieval armies. These include points for each unit, so that players can play relatively balanced games by building armies to a set points total. There are currently over 40 army lists, including many of the most popular armies, and more are being added each week, with the aim to have over 100 lists available. The rules also include guidelines to help in recreating historic battles, and there are three generic scenarios included as alternatives to the pitched battle.<br/> The strengths of the game are that it gives an exciting, interesting and challenging experience, plays relatively quickly for the size of battle that is being depicted, and the rules are straightforward to learn, whilst having the depth to retain interest after repeated play.<br/><br/>"}, "161727": {"rpgitemversion": {"244627": "PDF Version"}, "poll": {}, "name": "Mystery Genre Charts", "rpgproducer": {"75007": "Frank Lee"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2061979.png", "usersrated": "0", "average": "0", "statistics": {}, "rpg": {"356": "Generic / Universal"}, "rpgcategory": {"2108": "Sourcebook (rules/options to enhance play)"}, "rpggenre": {"178": "Crime (Mystery / Detective / Noir)"}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2061979_t.png", "description": "User Summary:<br/><br/>An expansion pack for The Covetous Poet's Adventure Creator and Solo GM Guidebook that adds charts for mystery-genre role-playing games.<br/> <br/>From the Introduction:<br/><br/>The Mystery Genre Charts are for roleplaying games featuring clever detectives who use their uncommon skills and desire to stop crime to see justice done.

The player then either places one of his totem pole pieces on an available village tile OR places one of his headdresses on an existing totem pole to claim it; in the latter case, he places this tile in front of himself and tilts the next village tile in line (if any) to make it available for play.<br/><br/>Once all six poles have been claimed, the players tally their score based on the rules on their tiles, e.g. score 3 points per animal skin on all of your poles or score 2 points per piece for your tallest pole.

It's about making deals with other players, riding the rise and fall of various authentic nineteenth century railroad companies.  In most railroad board games, one player is one company, and is engaged in pure competition with the other players.  That doesn't make for a very social experience.  Since players are investors in Railroads, they have the opportunity to benefit from semi-cooperative ventures, while hedging out their allies with other investments.<br/><br/>Additionally, Railroads is not a game about budgets and check books.  Money functions as points and are never spent.  Stock tokens are played and moved in a simplified fashion that means strategy is emphasized and budgeting is eliminated.  Stocks are merely methods of earning money (scoring points) so players can focus on their larger plans.<br/><br/>Players who play alone in Railroads will not do very well.  Railroads only gain as much track per turn as there are players in the company.  If there is only one player in the company, they only lay one track per turn and will not make a lot of money.  However, if you can get one or two people to join your venture, you can double or triple the speed that your railroads grow, turning your fledgling railroad into a geopolitical force to be reckoned with.

It is possible that players can swap control back and forth over the KGB chief even as he is trying to determine who to assassinate!<br/><br/>Once the carnage is done, players have to survive the ravages of aging--and every time a politician takes action, he ages faster than normal...your 50 yr old star of the party?  Well, suddenly he's acting like he's 83, Comrade.  Life near the top will do that to you.  In the Health phase, politicians may die or grow sick--sick politicians can choose to go to the hospital, but while there, they exert no influence and their responsibilities pass on to other politicians. Sometimes this means your man must make the heroic sacrifice to the Rodina and remain on the job even while at death's door.<br/><br/>Once we know who is still alive, the Party Chief is allowed to move politicians between posts.  After all, he's in control of the bureaucracy.  He can move people up and down, and when he's done, upper ministers do so as well--but can only affect politicians below them on the food chain.  Heck, politicians can even sponsor comrades in exile in Siberia to come back to the People.  Of course, each person you bring back ages you five years....want to bring back five?  Age 25 years in the blink of an eye, Tovarich.<br/><br/>Intrigue cards allow you to take control of situations or foil other players' schemes.  In one of the older versions, you could have things like Chernobyl take place in 1920.  That's been corrected--so that while events may be the same, they have now been made era-appropriate.<br/><br/>The turn ends with the May Day Parade.  If the party chief is healthy, he can wave throughout the day making people happy--clearly our socialist union is prospering.  But if he's sick, sometimes he leaves early and is unable to wave, sending doubts through the ranks.  If a faction (player) earns three waves, they win the game.<br/><br/>The Jolly Roger version provides three different KREMLIN games in one box.<br/><br/><br/>    1: The 'original' with fictional politicians, set in a USSR where KGB investigations send those found guilty to Siberia.  This version will have victory conditions based on the original Fata Morgana rules.<br/><br/><br/><br/>    2: A version inspired by the Avalon Hill variant titled 'Revolution'.  Set in the 1920s, it uses historical politicians as well as fictional politicians.  It's a more violent game as those arrested by the KGB are shot and removed from the game<br/><br/><br/><br/>    3: A new version, set in the modern USSR and Russia, an era of entrenched bureaucracy and alternatives for escaping KGB persecution.  This version introduces the concept of &quot;Going into Exile&quot; to avoid Siberia.  It also includes modern politicians from the 1960s onwards, whether it is Kosygin or Putin and Gorbachev.<br/><br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": {"244738": "Jolly Roger Edition"}, "name": "Kremlin (Limited Edition)", "playingtime": "45", "boardgamemechanic": {"2040": "Hand Management"}, "average": "7.15625", "usersrated": "72", "boardgamefamily": {"11966": "Country: Russia"}}, "161784": {"statistics": {}, "name": "Poppo Hunter", "videogamemode": {"2149": "Single-Player"}, "videogameversion": {"244741": "Wii U eShop edition"}, "average": "0", "videogametheme": {"2471": "Animals"}, "videogamegenre": {"2333": "Dating Sim"}, "videogamefranchise": {"25362": "Nintendo Game Seminar 2013"}, "videogameplatform": {"10763": "Wii U"}, "usersrated": "0", "poll": {}, "description": "User Summary<br/>In Poppo hunter, the player sits on a bench and feeds birds in hopes of finding a suitable mate for a pigeon named Popoda.<br/><br/>"}, "161785": {"poll": {}, "name": "Hog Trivia", "playingtime": "0", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": {"2035": "Roll / Spin and Move"}, "yearpublished": "1987", "usersrated": "0", "maxplayers": "4", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2065596_t.jpg", "average": "0", "statistics": {}, "boardgamepublisher": {"27630": {"name": "The Hog Farm"}}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2065596.jpg", "boardgameversion": {"244743": "First edition"}, "maxplaytime": "0", "boardgamecategory": {"1027": {"name": "Trivia"}}, "age": "5", "minplaytime": "0", "description": "Hog Trivia is a game that was created in 1987 and was part of a lawsuit brought on by Harley Davidson, Inc against the manufacture of the game &quot;The Hog Farm&quot;.
