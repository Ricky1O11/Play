Germany's 17th Army and 1st Panzer Army steamrolled over all opposition until they reached the mountains. There the Russians slowed and then stopped the Germans at the outskirts of Novorossisk, on the road to Tuapse and along the Terek River. This infuriated Hitler who then took over personal command of Army Group A and poured replacements and reinforcements into the area that were badly needed at Stalingrad. Eventually 27 Axis divisions were fighting south of the Don.<br/><br/>The Axis forces include 2 mountain divisions, 2 light (j&auml;ger) divisions, an SS motorized division (Wiking), and 3 panzer divisions -- two of which had three tank battalions while many on the east front have only one. The German army is accompanied by 1 Slovakian and 7 Romanian divisions.<br/><br/>The ranks of the Soviet army in the Caucasus is filled with Armenians, Georgians, Azerbaijanis, Cossacks and Turkoman who have questionable loyalty. These divisions are reinforced by Soviet Guard and NKVD units sent across the Caspian, and by Soviet Naval troops stationed along the Black Sea.<br/><br/>The Caucasus Campaign is a quick playing, moderately complex game with large hexes and easy-viewing 5/8 counters. The game system is based on the classic Igo-Ugo/movement-combat-exploitation system, but modified with elements from Ardennes '44 (specifically: Determined Attacks and Defense and unit morale). The tournament scenario (6 turns) can be completely in roughly 2 hours. The full game is 14 turns long and can be finished in one sitting (approximately 5 hours).<br/><br/>Game Scale:<br/>Game Turn: 1 week<br/>Hex: 18 miles / 29 kilometers<br/>Units: Regiments to Divisions<br/><br/>Game Inventory:<br/>One 22 x 34&quot; full color map<br/>One &amp; 1/2 dual-side printed countersheets (264 5/8&quot; counters)<br/>One 24-page The Caucasus Campaign rulebook<br/>Two dual-side printed Player Aid cards<br/>Ten small plastic baggies<br/>One 6-sided dice<br/><br/>Solitaire Playability: High<br/>Complexity Level: Medium-High<br/>Players: 1 or more<br/>Playing Time: 3-6<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": ["First edition"], "name": "The Caucasus Campaign", "playingtime": "360", "boardgamemechanic": ["Dice Rolling", "Hex-and-Counter"], "age": "0", "usersrated": "373", "boardgamesubdomain": ["Wargames"], "average": "7.64555"}, "33004": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic375402.jpg", "poll": [], "boardgamedesigner": ["Fred Horn"], "statistics": [], "yearpublished": "2007", "maxplayers": "2", "boardgameartist": ["Andreas Resch"], "boardgamepublisher": ["Ducosim", "Knucklebones Magazine", "WIN - Das Spielejournal"], "maxplaytime": "15", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic375402_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "15", "boardgamecategory": ["Abstract Strategy", "Animals", "Racing"], "description": "Can the Sardines is an abstract game included in the January 2008 issue of Knucklebones magazine.

Instead of trying to gather evidence to identify  a specific suspect selected and hidden at the start of the game (i.e. Col.

For once, though, the French far outnumbered the Germans. As a result a heavily outnumbered German army was forced to make a series of attacks to prevent the French discovering its weakness and to deny the French their retreat to the west.<br/><br/>Had the French pushed the Germans aside they would have been able to combine their armies and possibly protect Paris.

The Mayor of Farum (city on the outskirts of Copenhagen) had ruled the city like a king for almost a decade. His party ruled the city board and no one dared to speak out against the Mayor. But as with Hamlet, something is rotten in the Kingdom. A Danish newspaper blew the story wide open. It turned out that the Mayor, among other things, had made some creative investments and given his friends loads of city business. To top that off, his expense account carried not only trips to Championship Football games, but also wine for more than 10,000 a bottle &ndash; Cheers&hellip;<br/><br/>Sales and PR<br/>PBX was released in the beginning of November 2002, and were sold out before New Year &ndash; that made PBX: The fastest selling board game in Denmark ever. 12,000 copies sold from the shops in only 6 weeks &ndash; without a dime spent on marketing. Yet PBX was able to create heavy and very positive media coverage: The media also focused on the fact that PBX was the first of it's kind. Some articles even had politicians (the main characters in PBX) playing the game and reviewing it. National TV News gave it full coverage as Christmas Gift of the Year, including a review done by two Mayors. The second largest daily newspaper had &quot;business&quot; Cavling Winning (same as Pulitzer) journalists reviewing the game (BT).<br/><br/>Game play<br/>As a Mayor of a Danish town, you are obsessed about making your city the best city in the country. To fulfil all the dreams you have for the city, the Game starts out with you taking an illegal loan of 250 million from the Government. Now your job as a Mayor is to drive around the game board in your Mayoral car and try to spend the money as fast as possible. On your way you pick cards with instructions on how much to spend on, for instance, &quot;gifts &quot; to business relations in return for favours, dinners you have to give to keep your fellow politicians on board and travels you need to make in order to do proper &quot;research &quot;. You have to be careful, because the people you mingle with can easily forget their obligations to you, even though the gifts you spent on them were expensive. Your political opponents (though still full from the &quot;friendly &quot; dinner you hosted) will try and expose you, or the Government might even call you in for a little chat that would force you on a leave of absence, where you have no chance at all of blowing your 250 million.

If any of these are hit, a catch is released and the marbles in the compartment above are released to the player. One marble must be replaced in the compartment once it is reset for the next player. A plastic ramp located behind the targets catches stray marbles which roll up the ramp and then enter one of the three compartments in the machine.

It's a matching game! You and your opponents try to collect the most matching pairs of cards by choosing cards from the board or from players' hands. Can you remember where Tantor the elephant is hiding on the board? Or Manu the monkey? Whose hand is Bara the antelope in? Find two of these-or any other colorful characters in the game-and you have a match! The player with the most pairs wins the game.<br/><br/>Strategy Hints:<br/>try not to show the players the cards in your hand or on your side of the board. you know what these cards are, but other players may not. Unless another player chooses one of your cards, don't show them, choose one of their cards instead. <br/>Mix up the cards in your hand as often as you'd like, but especially when other players have seen your cards. Don't make it easy for them to make a match with your cards.<br/><br/>"}, "33103": {"boardgamedesigner": ["Manuel Morales"], "poll": [], "name": "Tempt Destiny", "playingtime": "0", "minplayers": "1", "boardgamemechanic": ["Hand Management"], "yearpublished": "2006", "usersrated": "3", "maxplayers": "10", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic283162_t.jpg", "average": "6", "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["Maverick Inc."], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic283162.jpg", "maxplaytime": "0", "boardgamecategory": ["Card Game"], "age": "0", "minplaytime": "0", "description": "The patent pending Tempt Destiny&trade; game method enables fans and family members to play the entire TV sports broadcast, including the commercials!<br/><br/>"}, "33104": {"boardgameversion": ["First edition"], "boardgamedesigner": ["Patrick Laterrot"], "poll": [], "name": "ToTem", "playingtime": "30", "minplayers": "2", "yearpublished": "2007", "usersrated": "4", "boardgamesubdomain": ["Abstract Games"], "maxplayers": "4", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic398258_t.jpg", "average": "5.25", "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["1-2-3-Games \u00c9ditions"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic398258.jpg", "boardgamefamily": ["Cirkle Series"], "maxplaytime": "30", "boardgamecategory": ["Abstract Strategy", "Bluffing", "Deduction"], "age": "0", "minplaytime": "30", "description": "The game is played on a grid of 9 x 9 squares, each with one of 4 signs (cross, circle, square, triangle) in one of four colours (purple, green, yellow, blue) on it. The 8 pieces are called &quot;totems&quot;: statues consisting of four stacked cubes, each separately pivotable, and a sculptured head on top of them. On the four cubes you find the same symbols and colours as on the field.<br/>Each totem can move on the field with the same sign AND colour like the corresponding cube of his pole (the side facing the player!) as follows: If you want to move one space, your lowest cube must correspond to the space one step away, etc., the topmost to the space four steps away. At every turn each player may either move one of his totems as many spaces as the correct cube corresponds to the target field (he can change directions during his move as often as he wishes) or turn one of the cubes of one of his totems and thus prepare for future moves. There is no capturing.<br/>The aim of the game is to move first one of your totems from your starting row to the marked &quot;totem space&quot; on the opposite side (2-player version) or on one of three totem spaces on the sides not being your starting row. In the 2-player game, each player owns 4 Totems, in the 4-player variant 2 of them.<br/>To foresee their opponents` next moves, players have to remember the possibilities of the other totems - more easily done, because before the first move, each player puts the cubes of the opposing Totem into the positions he wants to.<br/>There is a bluff element, too, as only the player moving knows, whether his move is correct or not. If another player doubts the correctness, he may call &quot;Totem!&quot; and the move is checked.

It has three large-hex maps, with 560 half-inch counters, covering the ETO from D-Day to V-E Day at 20 miles per hex. The main fronts are covered, excluding only Scandinavia and Greece. Each game turn equals a third of a month. Units are divisions for the Western Allies and Germans, corps for the Soviets (but with a complete divisional artillery order of battle), and armies for the Yugoslav's and the various minor powers.<br/><br/>The system is an operational (rather than strategic) derivation of the one used in &quot;Beyond the Urals&quot; and &quot;Operation Kremlin.&quot; No unit will have more than one step. All entry data, notes about reinforcement or special status, etc., can be printed on their reverse sides. Stacking is eight units per hex, with both sides having the move/fight or fight/move sequence option, along with the possibility for limited use of fight/fight.<br/><br/>The system will be simple, making for a game players can finish in one long weekend, but there will also be plenty of historic chrome, such as: V-weapons, the Warsaw Rebellion, liberation of the death camps, F&uuml;hrer-Mandated Offensives, FLAK divisions, the Upper Silesian industrial region, German economic collapse, National Socialist ardor, proletarian heroism, heavy bombers, naval gun support, fortified lines, etc.<br/><br/>Play begins with the Western Allied player (or the &quot;Grand Alliance&quot; player in a two-player match) launching the D-Day landing. He'll be free to choose just about any coastal hex from northern Germany to the Spanish border as his landing site. Or he might choose to come ashore that first time on the Mediterranean coast of France, the far north of Italy, or even somewhere along the Yugoslavian coast. He'll also have a second invasion available for use later that summer.<br/><br/>Victory is determined using a point system, primarily based on the German retention of cities according to a schedule derived from the historic Allied advance. There will be periodic victory checks to prevent the German player from adopting any kind of unhistorical strategy based on retreating into the Reich's heartland at the very start of play to try to form some kind of super defensive hedgehog. That ploy would have been impossible for the Germans to support economically in the real-world, and having to maintain a certain level of victory points in order to survive the period victory checks will work to the same effect in the game.<br/><br/>The combat results table will be of the unit-elimination type, with results of &quot;D-elim,&quot; &quot;D-back-2,&quot; &quot;Exchange,&quot; etc. Thus replacements will be plentiful and the action along the fronts fast and furious. Typical German infantry division will have attack and defense factors of 1-1, 1-2 or 2-3, while panzer divisions will weigh in as 3-2s and 4-3s. In comparison, US infantry divisions will be 3-4s, while that nation's armor divisions will be 4-3s and 5-3s.<br/><br/>A boxed game to be designed by Ty Bomba. Est. Retail: $60 (Est.

Seagoing empires expand their frontiers by sending ships to the farthest reaches of the globe in search of new lands, new alliances, and new conquests. The wealth of the newly-discovered worlds abroad is a tempting prize for those with the strength and the cunning to seize it... and to hold it!<br/>You represent a growing empire engaged in a glorious endeavor to expand your<br/>influence and status at home and across the great oceans of the world. Through exploration and shipping, colonization and war, you will struggle with the other great powers to control the resources and the regions that unfold before you.<br/><br/>The goal in Endeavor is to earn the most glory for your empire. Players earn glory by increasing their scores in Industry, Culture, Finance, and Politics, as well as by occupying cities, controlling connections between cities, and by holding certain Asset Cards and Building Tiles. Short-term goals of constructing useful buildings, gathering Trade Tokens, and obtaining Asset Cards must be balanced with the overall goal of attaining glory as you compete for control over the various regions of the world. The game only lasts seven rounds, and when it is over you want to be the one who has earned the most Glory points!<br/><br/>Each round every player gets to build a new building, based on their Industry track. They then obtain new population markers based on their Culture track and retrieve used markers from building based on their Finance track. During the action phase, players take turns to either activate a building using a population marker or spend trade tokens to take an action: Ship, Occupy, Attack, Payment or Draw. Some buildings and tokens allow a player to take one or both of two actions. Shipping is used to open new regions for Occupation and Drawing, and gains you Trade Tokens. Once a shipping track is full, the player with the most influence in that region gains the powerful Governor card for that region. Occupation of a city results in glory and Trade Tokens, while Attacking steals a city from an opponent! Either Occupation or Attacking can result in claiming the connection between two cities, if both connected cities are controlled by the same player. Drawing gains a card from a region up to the maximum hand limit based on the player's Politics track. A player's influence in a region determines which cards they can draw.

The best poems evoked the scene, the season, and represented the depth of the courtier's knowledge of the fashionable themes at court. By far, the most successful such lover was a fictional one named Hikaru Genji, the Shining Prince. Genji was, for the ladies of the court, the symbol of the perfect lover. For the men of the court, he was the perfect example to emulate. <br/>In GENJI, players take the roles of courtiers out to woo fair princesses. Players score points for writing the finest poetry, or winning the most hearts. But beware: other courtiers will be waiting in the wings to steal those hearts away!

A player moves 1-3 spaces each turn, then either studies new material (discards poetry cards and draws new ones) or woos the lady he is currently visiting. If he has no rivals who have previously presented her with poems, he can present her with a poem on one or two cards. &ldquo;Each poem card has the top or the bottom of a classic Tanka poem (5 lines, 5,7,5,7,7 syllables each, respectively),&rdquo; says Kirk. &ldquo;A poem can be considered either a top, a bottom, or a match of the two cards.&rdquo;<br/><br/>&quot;If another player has already presented a poem, then he can either complete the poem (assuming only a single card was played) or challenge it (by playing a poem card that increases the beauty of the poem, thus revealing the other player for the poser he is).

Materials are provided on perforated sheets and include: SimBucks of various denominations, travel passes, sustenance tickets, and coupons which can be exchanged for &quot;munchies&quot; during the game (representing luxuries).

Games usually last from 60 to 90 minutes. The game features an innovative dice drafting mechanism for players to obtain resources used in bidding for cards which yield points. Each turn, players have a variety of actions available to them and tempo is an important consideration &ndash; it may be good to get a bid in first to win a card cheaply, but at the cost of taking a high value die instead.<br/><br/>In Seafood Palace, players take on the role of Chinese seafood restaurant owners in Singapore, seeking to gain fame points by bidding to satisfy public demand for tasty seafood dishes. The more resources you put into the dish, the more likely that people will identify that dish with your restaurant, and this recognition is represented by fame points.<br/><br/>Every player starts with stores of fish, prawn, crab, non-seafood resources (chicken and vegetable), beverages and coins. The resources are represented by counters on the player&rsquo;s own board, which represents the player&rsquo;s stores.<br/><br/>Each round, public demand is represented by dish cards that become available for auction. Players bid to satisfy the demand with the corresponding resources and the highest bid wins the card and the fame points on the card.<br/><br/>Each round, new resource dice and number dice are available for players to replenish stores.  These dice are traded in as pairs (one of each kind) to get the specified number of the specified type of resource (e.g. a 5-number die and a crab resource die are traded in for 5 crab resources).<br/><br/>There are also bonus cards which could permit special actions to benefit the player - some of the bonus action cards include discounts on buying seafood resources, using MSG to get an advantage over your competitors (but with a penalty) or the abundant catch that helps you stock up on seafood. Bonus cards could also be set menus, which if fulfilled by the end of the game, will yield bonus points. A wedding banquet menu is valuable, and this game also caters to vegetarians with a vegetarian set menu. If you hire a master chef, your lowly 1-point dishes will increase in value.<br/><br/>The twist is that players have to choose which of several actions they want to take (take a die, bid on a dish, claim a dish, bid on a bonus card, claim a bonus card, or pass) and focusing on one action means sacrificing the tempo to carry out another action. If you decide to go for the high number die, someone else could take the resource die of the type you need badly, and yet another will get in a bid on a valuable card that you can&rsquo;t outbid because you haven&rsquo;t managed to obtain the right dice yet &hellip;<br/><br/>The game lasts enough rounds so that each player has the advantage of going first an equal number of times. At the end of the game, players score fame points for dish cards they have won, set menus they have fulfilled with their dishes, and recognition for having the best stocked cellar (player with the most beverages) and best seafood stocks (player whose least seafood resource is greater than other players&rsquo; least seafood resource).

BSO FOOTBALL provides its players with remarkable statistical accuracy in almost every category, in the most accessible, playable form in the game industry. There&rsquo;s no trying to outguess yourself on offense or defense. You just call the play and roll the dice (which you provide). Player Cards, one for every offensive player on the team, the Defensive Ratings on the Team Charts, and the Results Tables do the rest.<br/><br/>Check the sample Player Cards, above, to see how players are rated.<br/><br/>The Team Charts provide the ratings/information for Defense, Interceptions, Clutch Play,  Fumbles, Penalties, and the full range of Returns and Kicking details. They also have Extra Information on Special and Unusual plays that team used. The Charts include Rushing, Pass Completion, Pass Gain and Return, Out-of-Bounds, Medium and Long Gains, Kickoff (including Onside Kicks), Punting (including Blocked Kicks), and a full range of Penalties.<br/><br/>The Game Clock is also extremely accurate, with each quarter using 180 &ldquo;points&rdquo;, each point equal to 5 seconds. A normal play would use 8 points, but an incomplete pass or Time Out only 1.<br/><br/>The first edition of BSO FOOTBALL brings you one of the greatest seasons in the History of Football, 1958, with the famous overtime Championship game between the Colts and the Giants. In the East the Giants and the Cleveland Browns, led by the great Jim Brown, had to use a playoff game to determine the winner, and the Steelers, led by the veteran Bobby Layne, were not that far behind. In the West, the Colts beat out both the Bears and Rams by one game.<br/><br/>Some of Pro Football&rsquo;s greats are present:  Ollie Matson, Norm Van Brocklin, Johnny Unitas, Jon Arnett, Y. A. Tittle, and the first glimpses of Bart Starr, Jim Taylor, and Paul Hornung, all playing for one of the worst Green Bay teams ever (1-10-1)! And wait&rsquo;ll you see the average yards per pass catch!  Steeler rookie, Jimmy Orr, led the league with 27.6, with many others not far behind.<br/><br/>For gamers who like to play entire seasons and revel in great statistical accuracy, BSO FOOTBALL is unbeatable.

It combines traditional elements of chess &mdash;such as a squared board&mdash; with original pieces and movements. The game symbolizes a battle between two feudal lords: the White Lord and the Black Lord. Each one leads an army composed by attack towers and portable bridges.<br/>The principal aim of attack towers is to capture enemy castles. But these are surrounded by deep moats. Portable bridges are used to cover those moats. In this way, towers can cross moats; and thus, they can take castles&hellip; but only if the tower is as high as the castle. Most attack towers are initially smaller than most castles. However, they can get bigger by capturing an enemy tower. When this happens, the stages of the defeated tower are added to the winning one. So, winning attack towers become higher and higher. In the end, they may even match the highest castle: that is, the enemy lord&rsquo;s one.<br/>During the combat, both contenders may be helped by mercenaries and flying creatures. But these are jailed in strong citadels, so first of all, attack towers must free them. Once they have been liberated, mercenaries can blow enemy bridges up; and winged creatures can transport their lord by air, crossing even moats not covered by bridges.<br/>The main purpose in the game is to trap the opponent&rsquo;s feudal lord, who takes shelter in the highest castle. The player who gets this objective wins.<br/><br/>NOTES:<br/>-This information was submitted by the publisher.<br/>-The game has been published in English and Spanish.<br/>-The game has been published as a book.

He loved each in his own way, but favored his oldest most of all.  In fact, he showed affection and appreciation to each son in descending order of their birth.  Over time, this greatly displeased his younger sons to the point of confrontation.  Being respectful to their father, the younger two sons did not accuse their father directly, but merely asked the question:  &quot;What more can I do to earn your respect?&quot;  At first the father was outraged that his younger sons would question his fidelity, but then he realized their defiance presented an opportunity.<br/><br/>His land had been plagued by prankster Dragon that ate his crops, scared away his workers and generally caused chaos throughout his land.  He decided to put his younger sons to the test of ridding his land of this Dragon.  The sons agreed, but pleaded:  &quot;Should our older brothers be denied this opportunity to prove their devotion to you?&quot;  Knowing full well his sons' intent, Wei Fu agreed to send all five sons on the quest.  However, his older sons, fearful for their safety, begged for a reprieve.  Acquiescing, Wei Fu decided to ease the burden by declaring:  &quot;The Dragon is the quest!  However, I would still appreciate any son who brings me the finest examples of the Five Elements of Water, Wood, Fire, Earth, and Metal, which provide the very foundation of our world.&quot;  With this alternative quest, he would assign the easier tasks to his older sons&mdash;or so he thought.<br/><br/>Weilong or &quot;Powerful Dragon&quot; is a simple dice game based loosely on the dice game One-O-Five and the Chinese card game Shou Ba Yi.  Each player represents the role of one of Wei Fu's sons on their quest to collect the Five Elements or capture the Dragon.  Each player rolls their dice and sets aside those dice showing their target number (Element).  The objective is to roll all five dice of the target number before any other player.  Target numbers are determined by drawing cards (Son Cards).   The Son Cards also have unique abilities for the players.<br/><br/>Once a player has set aside all five dice of the target number or captured the Dragon (by collecting the dice 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5), the remaining players add up the total of the dice they have collected along with the penalty number at the bottom of the card and track those points.  Your goal is have the lowest point total each round and for the game.  The Son cards are then passed to the left and the next round begins (5 Player Game).  The winner is the player who has the least amount of points after 5 rounds.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": ["Print and Play Edition"], "average": "5.90677", "name": "Weilong", "playingtime": "20", "boardgamemechanic": ["Dice Rolling", "Set Collection", "Variable Player Powers"], "age": "0", "usersrated": "96", "boardgamesubdomain": ["Family Games"], "boardgamefamily": ["Animals: Dragons", "Country: China"]}, "33360": {"boardgamedesigner": ["Leisure Trends Ltd.", "B.

The Turks have three provincial armies, composed of a mix of infantry and cavalry, and the Sultan's own army of heavy cavalry, janissaries, and artillery. They can also call upon Wallachian and Tatar allies. The Imperials have their core Habsburg-Austrian army, plus contingents from the Holy Roman Empire, and elements from the personal armies of Saxony, Bavaria, and even Modena. They also have the irregular forces of the Military Border.<br/><br/>Both sides are evenly matched - weakened by war but still dwarfing the forces of their neighbors. The Imperials begin as the aggressors, but will have to play cannily to avoid surrendering the initiative to the Ottomans. Playing for Prestige (like the other games in the series), your goals are modest, but can add up to significant gains that may influence the outcome of the peace talks. The peace process, more or less out of your hands, is the mechanism by which the game ends.<br/><br/>Map scale is 8.5 miles per hex. Unit scale is battalion/regimental. Units are rated for Effectiveness and Movement; raw strength is factored into Effectiveness.<br/><br/>Turns are equivalent to three weeks - 16 turns per year. Each turn is broken down into several phases - supply, operations, admin, etc. There are scenarios for each year of active operations - three in all - and a Campaign Game.<br/><br/>A few key concepts include Initiative and Operational Preparedness, Campaign Plans, Prestige, and Auxiliaries. This game uses the 3rd edition of the Lace Wars rules, amended to 3.1.<br/><br/>The heart of the game is the Operations Phase, where the players move their formations, lay siege to fortresses and engage in battle. The player with the initiative can dictate the pace of the game, but since initiative is based on operational preparedness, it can pass to another side, perhaps at an inconvenient time.<br/><br/>Auxiliary counters represent support troops and irregulars who had a major impact on operations, but cannot be adequately represented as traditional game units. Instead, a player might have a pontooneer auxiliary that he can play onto a stack to help it cross a major river, or a converged grenadier auxiliary that provides a morale bonus in combat. Because of the scale, many combat elements can be used either as units or as Auxiliaries.<br/>[Playing cards could have been used instead of counters, but there are production issues involved, and besides, some of the auxiliaries' functions are hard to indicate with cards. In essence, however, auxiliaries are that kind of game asset, not &quot;pawns&quot; like the combat units.]<br/><br/>Leaders have an important role to play, as befitting an era where personal command was critical. They are rated for skill or effectiveness, personality, and influence (i.e. the chance they have of retaining command despite their incompetence).<br/><br/>The supply system incorporates lines of communication, the strategic placement of depots, foraging, and attrition. River and canal movement has been taken into account and will prove as critical to success as the use of rail lines in games that cover more modern periods.<br/><br/>The combat system has a tactical feel - while not a full sub-system with battlefield maps, it addresses the key issues of frontage, reserves, and supports, as well as firepower and morale. Winning a battle will bring you the acclaim of your noble peers, but may not gain you any strategic advantage; losing a battle can be catastrophic.<br/><br/>Components<br/><br/>1) Eight 12x18 inch full colour maps representing the Danube Basin and the surrounding lands, from the Adriatic to the Black Sea, and from central Hungary to Bulgaria.<br/><br/>2) 1080 counters representing the forces of Austria, Saxony, Bavaria, Hesse, Cologne and other Holy Roman Empire states, Modena, the Sultan's Army, the Ottoman provincial commands of Bosnia, Rumelia, and Silistria, the Wallachians, and the Crimean Tatars.<br/><br/>3) A set of charts and tables, plus several 11x17 inch display cards.<br/><br/>4) A series rulebook - 3rd Edition (3.1) - called the King's Regulations and Orders (KR&amp;Os), a game-exclusive rulebook, scenario &amp; OOB information, and an historical commentary.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "0", "boardgameversion": ["First edition"], "average": "7.8125", "name": "T\u00fcrkenkrieg (1737-1739)", "playingtime": "0", "boardgamemechanic": ["Hex-and-Counter"], "age": "0", "boardgameexpansion": ["40570"], "usersrated": "8", "boardgamesubdomain": ["Wargames"], "boardgamefamily": ["Age of Kings", "Lace Wars"]}, "33390": {"boardgamedesigner": ["Allan Macfarlan", "Paulette Macfarlan"], "poll": [], "name": "Handbook of American Indian Games", "playingtime": "0", "minplayers": "0", "yearpublished": "1985", "usersrated": "0", "maxplayers": "0", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic277096_t.jpg", "average": "0", "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["Dover Publications"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic277096.jpg", "maxplaytime": "0", "boardgamecategory": ["Book"], "age": "0", "minplaytime": "0", "description": "This 288-page trade paperback is an very well-researched overview of the sports and games of American Indians.  150 different activities are covered, but of particular importance to board gamers are the chapters on guessing games and ceremonial games.

To line up the horses for the next race simply pass the string in front of the horses and draw them back to the start line. All horses have an equal chance of winning the race because once the race starts no one can have control of the action of the horses.<br/><br/>The rules then go on to say that in some instances dirt or dust can retard the forward motion of a horse.

During the race (hand)all players try to form a sequence of horse cards from 1 to 3 in front of them. Beginning with number 1 and then adding 2 and 3 consecutively. A player completing the sequence 1-2-3 ends the hand (race). The winning sequence does not have to be completed with the same horse in all three positions. If a  player does complete the 1-2-3 with the same horse that player becomes the next BANKER. The banker in the game sells and redeems Bank shares and Wager Tickets. All money received from the sale of bank shares and wager tickets is kept in an account. At the end of the game the amount in this account is divided among shareholders with an equal amount being given for each share held. At the beginning of the game players can purchase bank shares which are always redeemable for their face value. Anyone not redeeming purchased bank shares during the game is entitled to a split of whatever money is in the bank at the end of the game. At the beginning of the game (race) players can purchase wager tickets on their favorite horses. Bets are made across the board in all 3 positions and players collect from the bank for how a horse finished.<br/><br/>In order to play the game the deck of cards is shuffled and then the first player draws a card, if its a number 1 card it is kept face up in front of the player, if its any other card it is discarded play continues until someone has completed the 1 2 3 sequence at which time players holding winning tickets matching names of horses somewhere in the winning sequence are paid off.

The dealer places the toppers on the playing board in the center of the table. He then shuffles and distributes the card face down to everyone. The object of the game is to get a complete book of cards in their hand. You do this by passing one card to the player on his left. That player decides if he wants to keep the card and give a different card or if he wants to pass the card on to the next player. This goes on until a player has 4 cards the same in his hand at which time that player then grabs a topper from the center of the board and then everyone else tries to make a mad grab for a remaining toppers. Of course since there is always one topper less than the number of players playing one will not get a topper. that player accumulates the letter T on his score card. Each additional time that the player gets no topper another letter in the word TOPPER is accumulated. The first player who has TOPPER next to his name loses the round and sits out the rest of the game which is then played with less cards and less toppers.

You as a gang boss get Notoriety Points by having your characters fight and hurt other players' characters. If you miss in a fight, you do Collateral Damage to the city (thus the name of the game).

The four games are Roundtable Chess, Roundtable Checkers, Wordstack, and Checkers Roulette. The game includes 4 complete sets of chess men, 4 complete sets of checkers (15  per set), and four sets of letter tiles (45 per set) that are used for playing Wordstack and Checkers Roulette.<br/><br/><br/>     Roundtable Chess is extreme and exciting chess play for 2 or 4 players. Each player plays with a complete set of 16 chessmen. Chessmen move and make captures as done in the traditional two player chess game. Chessmen in Roundtable chess can also be move in circular directions. Each player&rsquo;s objective is to gain control of the center of the Roundtable by safely moving his/her king into that position without it being checked or captured. The first king to control the center of the Roundtable wins.<br/>     Roundtable Checkers gives traditional checkers and extreme twist of excitement and face lift. It's designed for 2 or 4 players. Each starts with 15 checkers and can choose thousands of ways to set them up.  Players can also move up to four different checkers per turn in a circular, diagonal, horizontal, or vertical direction. Like regular checkers, you make single or multiple jumps to capture the opponents' playing pieces. The player that captures the greatest number of enemy checkers wins.  <br/>     Wordstack is an exciting 3-dimensional word game that plays 2 or 4 players. Each player selects 15 lettered checkers from her set of 45 tiles ranging from A to Z. Players may move up to 10 different lettered checkers per turn in diagonal, vertical, horizontal, or circular patterns. The player's objective is to earn points by combining (joining) her checker(s) with an opponent's checker(s) in order to spell words. Words may be spelled forward or backward, and in a diagonal, vertical, horizontal, or circular direction. Players may also capture (jump) an opponent's checker(s) to form a stack of checkers. The stack of captured checkers becomes a &quot;Wordstack&quot; when it is combined (joined) with an opponent's piece(s) to form words. The player who earns the highest number of points wins.<br/>     Checkers Roulette is numbers fun for 2 or 4 players. Each player uses 15 numbered checkers that include the values 5, 10, 25, and 50.  Players may move up to 4 different checkers per turn in a circular, diagonal, horizontal, or vertical direction. You score points by capturing (jumping) an opponent's checker(s), and lose points when your checkers are captured. For example, if your checker with the value of &quot;5&quot; captures an opponent&rsquo;s checker with the value &quot;10&quot;, you earn 50 points (5 &times; 10 = 50), and the opponent loses 50 points. You also earn or lose points by setting up plays. The player that earns the greatest number of points wins.<br/><br/><br/>"}, "33426": {"boardgamedesigner": ["S.
