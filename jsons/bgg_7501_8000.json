It tells how the peerless prince Siegfried from Xanten in the Netherlands, comes to Worms to court the beautiful Kriemhild.  However, King Gunther and his two brothers jealously guard their sister Kriemhild.  Gunther wishes to win the hand of Brunhild of Iceland, but she will only marry the man who can win three contests against her mighty strength.  Gunther and Siegfried strike a pact, whereby Siegfried will help Gunther win Brunhild's hand and in return he may marry Kriemhild.  Using his magic cloak, Siegfried secretly assists Gunther to defeat Brunhild, both on the field and in the bedchamber.  Unfortunately, Siegfried keeps Brunhild's ring and girdle, and ultimately bestows them upon his wife Kriemhild.  A small grievance leads the queens to fight, the ring and girdle are produced, and Brunhild is humiliated.   She enlists Hagen, the chief vassal of Gunther, to help her get vengeance, and Gunther and Hagen murder Siegfried while out hunting.  Kriemhild swears to exact revenge, marries the recently widowed King Etzel (Attila the Hun) and finally invites Hagen and her brothers to Attila's court, where in a crescendo of battle and blood, everyone dies and honour is redeemed.<br/><br/>Siegfried and Brunhild are clearly destined for each other, and in older versions of the story he is betrothed to her, but is bewitched away by Kriemhild.  The Natural Order would be that Brunhild is won fairly and that Siegfried may marry any woman that he chooses.  The forces of Tragic Destiny twist the natural order so that Brunhild is tricked by Gunther and Siegfried, or that Hagen and Gunther murder Siegfried to obtain his magic cloak.<br/><br/>"}, "7556": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic52707.jpg", "poll": [], "boardgamedesigner": ["Tom Walczyk"], "statistics": [], "yearpublished": "1979", "maxplayers": "2", "boardgameartist": ["Redmond A.

With roots tracing back to Avalon Hill's classic Rise and Decline of the Third Reich, and to its eventual successors--Advanced Third Reich and Empire of the Rising Sun--A World at War takes this system even further, expanding on the detail and choices in what was already a fine family of wargames.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>    <br/>         <br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>         <br/><br/>         <br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>         <br/><br/>         <br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>         <br/><br/>         <br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>         <br/><br/>         <br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>    <br/>    <br/>         1974,  1976,<br/><br/>         <br/><br/>         1992<br/><br/>         <br/><br/>         1995<br/><br/>         <br/><br/>         2003, 2013<br/><br/>         <br/><br/>         2015<br/><br/>    <br/>    <br/>         1981, 1984<br/><br/>         <br/><br/>         <br/><br/>         <br/><br/>         <br/><br/>         <br/><br/>         <br/><br/>         <br/><br/>         <br/><br/>    <br/><br/><br/><br/>A World at War, a game that brings you everything in one meaty box: marines and paratroopers battling infantry and armor; submarines and carriers ambushing cruisers and battlewagons; army planes and carrier planes dogfighting bombers and interceptors and ultra-fast jets. Yet unlike in other games, in A World at War you decide which units to build the most of, and you decide where to deploy them. Will this corps march across Europe, or sail the Pacific? Will these planes strafe the eastern front, or hunt the waters of the Med? Whatever you decide, decide carefully--for in A World at War, the deployment of arms is crucial. But don't think they constitute the only battlefield. The struggle extends into foreign parliaments, through diplomacy; into your own skunk works, through research; and even behind enemy lines, through partisans. So seize every advantage you can get--not just in drop tanks and detonators, but also in oil fields and wool parkas. Most of all, stay flexible. For when the worst happens and you find yourself outwitted and outgunned, you may need to adjust your strategy. Facing that storm, do you surge-research the atomic bomb, or do you take the exigency--less glitzy and less risky--of barricading your beaches and erecting flak near your factories? (Self-recriminations can come later, like how you cracked too few encryptions, or gobbled too many islands, or skimped too much on Murmansk.) For all of these things are possible, and more!<br/><br/><br/>A World at War, a game of warfare not only on land, under sea, and in the air--but also on trucks and in treasuries, on the lab bench and in the diplomatic pouch. With so many elements in play, winning strategies will always be interwoven and winning decisions always anguished. But if you hang on long enough and unleash the latest weapons in the boldest assaults, then you just may earn the chance to crush armies and rule empires . . . even if they're only cardboard.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Contents of the Second Edition:<br/><br/>     2800 full-color single-sided die-cut counters, in ten countersheets.<br/>     Four 22-inch x 30-inch full-color mapsheets, forming two large maps of the European and Pacific theaters.<br/>     A 236-page rulebook.<br/>     A 104-page status-sheet booklet.<br/>     A 24-page research &amp; diplomacy booklet.<br/>     A 20-page scenario booklet.<br/>     Fifteen player aid cards.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>    <br/>         Number<br/><br/>         Color<br/><br/>         Tables<br/><br/>    <br/>    <br/>         1<br/><br/>         olive<br/><br/>         combat--attrition, CRT, air defense and combat, naval attack, nationality DRMs<br/><br/>    <br/>    <br/>         1<br/><br/>         lt blue<br/><br/>         naval--interception, search, surprise, construction, raider, sub attack, air range<br/><br/>    <br/>    <br/>         1<br/><br/>         blue<br/><br/>         strategic warfare--modifiers and combat, Pearl Harbor surprise, harbor attack<br/><br/>    <br/>    <br/>         1<br/><br/>         green<br/><br/>         misc--winter, BRP costs, Commonwealth and minor country forces, naval activities<br/><br/>    <br/>    <br/>         1<br/><br/>         yellow<br/><br/>         surrender--resistance modifiers, British concessions, U.S. elections<br/><br/>    <br/>    <br/>         1<br/><br/>         white<br/><br/>         SoP, research results summary<br/><br/>    <br/>    <br/>         1<br/><br/>         white<br/><br/>         historical charts--events, shipbuilding<br/><br/>    <br/>    <br/>         4<br/><br/>         many<br/><br/>         naval status charts--TF displays<br/><br/>    <br/>    <br/>         2<br/><br/>         white<br/><br/>         naval combat charts--CG tracking<br/><br/>    <br/>    <br/>         2<br/><br/>         white<br/><br/>         conference<br/><br/>    <br/><br/><br/><br/>     Eight six-sided dice.<br/>     One deck of oil effect cards.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>    <br/>         Air<br/><br/>         Naval<br/><br/>         Army<br/><br/>         Economy<br/><br/>         Construction<br/><br/>    <br/>    <br/>         4<br/><br/>         4<br/><br/>         4<br/><br/>         3<br/><br/>         3 <br/><br/>    <br/><br/><br/><br/>     Four decks of Magic and Ultra cards.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>    <br/>         Nation <br/><br/>         Submarine<br/><br/>         ASW<br/><br/>         Tactical<br/><br/>         Strategic<br/><br/>         Combined<br/><br/>         Blank<br/><br/>         Wild<br/><br/>    <br/>    <br/>         German<br/><br/>         2<br/><br/>         0<br/><br/>         2<br/><br/>         2<br/><br/>         1<br/><br/>         5<br/><br/>         0<br/><br/>    <br/>    <br/>         British<br/><br/>         0<br/><br/>         2<br/><br/>         2<br/><br/>         2<br/><br/>         1<br/><br/>         5<br/><br/>         0<br/><br/>    <br/>    <br/>         Japanese<br/><br/>         2<br/><br/>         2<br/><br/>         2<br/><br/>         2<br/><br/>         1<br/><br/>         6<br/><br/>         0<br/><br/>    <br/>    <br/>         American<br/><br/>         2<br/><br/>         2<br/><br/>         2<br/><br/>         2<br/><br/>         1<br/><br/>         3<br/><br/>         1<br/><br/>    <br/><br/><br/><br/>     One GMT counter tray.<br/>     One pack of ziplocking bags.<br/>     One promo sheet.<br/>     One box.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>", "minplayers": "1", "boardgameversion": ["First Edition", "Second Edition"], "name": "A World at War", "playingtime": "2880", "boardgamemechanic": ["Hex-and-Counter"], "age": "14", "boardgameexpansion": ["151952"], "usersrated": "254", "boardgameaccessory": ["A World at War: Countersheet 11"], "boardgamesubdomain": ["Wargames"], "average": "7.62854", "boardgamepodcastepisode": ["The Remotish Gamer - Episode #04 - Royals"]}, "7615": {"boardgamedesigner": ["Jeff Siadek"], "poll": [], "name": "Caesar", "playingtime": "240", "minplayers": "3", "boardgamemechanic": ["Auction/Bidding"], "yearpublished": "1993", "usersrated": "9", "boardgamefamily": ["Ancient Rome"], "maxplayers": "8", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic31110_t.jpg", "average": "4.77778", "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["Gamesmiths"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic31110.jpg", "boardgameversion": ["Gamesmiths First Edition"], "maxplaytime": "240", "boardgamecategory": ["Ancient", "Economic", "Political"], "age": "0", "minplaytime": "240", "description": "From the rules summary:<br/><br/>Each turn represents one year in the life of a Roman estate.

Each player starts on the &quot;surface&quot;. The player is then asked a question from a box of cards (similar to the question cards used in the game Trivial Pursuit).

The game is started as pawns, much like in life. Movement is made by standard two 6d rolls. There are various hazards and events on the board and penalties and bonuses are paid in cash or movement limitations. Along the game path, there are six home bases of the various character images. A pawn can enter any one of his choosing and assume that character for the rest of the game. Character images may not harass pawns in any way.<br/><br/>At this point a player assumes his character image role and each player has different powers and functions. Primary functions include: Eagle receives a cash commission for ALL financial transactions in the game, Fire  sweeps  and moves players about the board, Demon harasses players and blocks them from advancing, Throne buys properties and investments that increase each round, Serpent harasses and robs players, and Cross saves players from being robbed, harassed, or burned (moved against their will) by Fire. There are dozens of specific other roles, functions and actions that each character may do, and image characters add a &ldquo;magic red&rdquo; die to their roles that also allows them to perform custom functions and actions, as well as common actions to all characters in the game.<br/><br/>The player with the most money/property at the end of the game wins.<br/><br/>"}, "7679": {"boardgamedesigner": ["(Uncredited)"], "poll": [], "name": "Busine$$ GO", "playingtime": "60", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": ["Roll / Spin and Move", "Stock Holding"], "yearpublished": "1996", "usersrated": "20", "maxplayers": "5", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic33070_t.jpg", "average": "6.45", "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["America Games Inc."], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic33070.jpg", "maxplaytime": "60", "boardgamecategory": ["Economic"], "age": "12", "minplaytime": "60", "description": "From the rules :<br/><br/>&quot;Want to test your money making instincts in the cutthroat world of finance?

Scorched Earth uses Fire in the East as a base (and cannot be played without Fire in the East), adding more maps, counters, and rules. The game requires two players - one for the Germans and one for the Soviets - or two teams of players. The size of the game makes it well-suited for team play, with up to 3 or 4 players per side.<br/><br/>Scorched Earth's three maps extend the coverage of those in Fire in the East. The maps cover:<br/>     The Volga River, from its heavily forested northwestern reaches to its mouth at the edge of the deserts of Asia; the western shores of the Caspian Sea; the Caucasus Mountains area of the USSR, to the borders of Turkey and Iran.<br/><br/>Scorched Earth's sixteen counter sheets (3840 counters total) encompass the diversity of forces in this theatre. All Axis forces engaged in the east are shown, from German through the Axis Allies (Finnish, Hungarian, Italian, Rumanian, Slovakian), and including the eastern troops - Soviet citizens fighting against their government. The entire range of Soviet forces is given: regulars, guards, NKVD, militia, and the foreign contingents in the Red Army, including the Poles, Czechs, and even the German formations raised from prisoners of war. Over 40 different types of ground units are represented, from divisions (including division-sized Soviet Corps) to individual batteries of super-heavy artillery, such as tank corps, panzergrenadier divisions, artillery divisions, parachute brigades, and commando battalions. Aircraft units cover the many new aircraft sent to the front, such as the Fw 190 fighters and ground attack aircraft, Hs 129 tankbusters, A-20 and B-25 lend-lease bombers, Yak-9DD long-range fighters, and even late-war German jet aircraft.<br/><br/>Scorched Earth's rules expand upon those in Fire in the East to cover the rest of the war in the USSR. New features include:<br/><br/>    Abilities of new aircraft types  <br/>    Partisan warfare<br/>    Oilfields<br/>    Surrender and defection of Germany's eastern front allies<br/>    Continual upgrading of armored and mechanized forces<br/>    Use of artillery divisions *Allied Lend-Lease to the USSR<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Scorched Earth's orders of battle present in game terms the most detailed and accurate orders of battle ever published for the Russian front. The grand campaign game can be played to the end of 1944 from two starting points: from June 1941 or April 1942. The rules also allow the 1941 and 1942 campaigns to be played seperately, giving two campaign games shorter in playing time than the grand campaign game.  Scorched Earth covers the largest land campaign in history with the scope it deserves. It presents a detailed, exciting game situation, challenging and rewarding the players' strategic and tactical skills.<br/><br/>Game Components:<br/><br/>    3840 die-cut counters (16 countersheets: Europa 6A to 10A, 46 to 56)<br/>    Three maps (Europa #7A, 8A and 9A)<br/>    One rules booklet<br/>    Two orders of battle booklets (Axis &amp; Soviet)<br/>    One set of game charts:<br/>        Combat Result/Terrain Effects Chart (x2)<br/>        Unit Identification Chart/Counter Formats<br/>        Turn Record Chart<br/>        Soviet Game Chart/1942 Scenario Front Line Maps - North<br/>        Axis Game Chart/1942 Scenario Front Line Maps - South<br/>        Europa marker Display<br/>        Master Sequence of Play/Special Dates List<br/>        Europa Map Legend<br/>        Map Guide<br/>    <br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": ["English edition"], "average": "7.90236", "name": "Scorched Earth", "playingtime": "360", "boardgamemechanic": ["Dice Rolling", "Hex-and-Counter"], "age": "12", "boardgameexpansion": ["28394", "33579", "33590", "9196", "167261"], "usersrated": "127", "boardgameaccessory": ["Scorched Earth, Europa Play Aids Kit 4"], "boardgamesubdomain": ["Wargames"], "boardgamefamily": ["Country: Soviet Union", "Europa Series"]}, "7691": {"boardgamedesigner": ["(Uncredited)"], "poll": [], "name": "MTV: The Game", "playingtime": "90", "minplayers": "2", "yearpublished": "1999", "usersrated": "9", "maxplayers": "6", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic50185_t.jpg", "average": "4.33333", "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["Cardinal", "MTV Networks"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic50185.jpg", "maxplaytime": "90", "boardgamecategory": ["Movies / TV / Radio theme", "Music", "Trivia"], "age": "13", "minplaytime": "90", "description": "Take turns answering MTV trivia questions and lifestyle questions about your fellow players until one player has collected three tokens and the MTV Video Music Award moon-man.

The types of winning collections (and the collection size limits) vary based on the number of players. Easily collected animals offer a smaller bonus than rarer beasts. Event cards and co-location both dictate whether a player successfully captures an animal for his collection.<br/><br/>In a single game, the first player to complete a collection will almost always end up with the most money even with the smallest award -able bonus. However, a series of games can be played which raises the importance of the value of one's collection.<br/><br/>Players may travel slowly on foot within a territory, and more quickly all over the board by plane. The more distant the target location, the more expensive the flight.<br/><br/>Animals may also be sold prior to the end of the game to gain working capital. This is necessary in some cases when a player spends his money flying across the board for a prize animal, only to have another player in the same location draw a &quot;capture&quot; card first from the event card deck.<br/><br/>For the most part, the game is also educational.

One player is chosen to be the starting player.<br/><br/>The Lucky Number<br/>Now each player receives one or more lucky numbers. The starting player places the face down deck in front of him on the table. He reveals the topmost card in such a way that everyone can see it at the same time. The revealed card is either a symbol or a touch card.<br/><br/>A symbol card shows one to eight small &quot;lucky mushrooms&quot; (blue), &quot;lucky pigs&quot; (yellow) and chimney sweeps (red) in different combinations and in the color of the target cards. When a symbol card is revealed, each player has to find out, how often a symbol is found on the symbol card. If the number of one symbol equals the lucky number of a player he tries to draw the appropriate target card as quickly as possible towards him.<br/><br/>For each target card a player has successfully drawn he receives a card from the deck. These cards are placed in front of the player. If a player draws (touching counts as drawing) a card, which he was not allowed to draw (e.g. because he miscounted the symbols) he has to put three of his own cards in the jackpot, for each card he has drawn wrongly. If he has less than three cards, all of them have to go into the jackpot.<br/><br/>The jackpot is a collection of cards (maximum five). It is placed near the target cards. If there are at any time more than five cards in the jackpot, the surplus cards are shuffled back into the deck before revealing the topmost card. At the start of play there is no jackpot.<br/><br/>After the first player has given a card from the deck to each player who has correctly drawn a target card, the target cards are placed back in the middle of the table. The revealed card is placed in the jackpot as are all the cards the players have lost.<br/><br/>If a touch card is revealed, quick reactions are called for. Each player tries to touch the matching target card with both his hands, placing one after the other. This will create a huge pile of hands, sometimes in wildly mixed order. The target card remains in the middle of the table.

He then announces he is open to attack and the Opponent will then try to strip off weapons or damage the player. When the attack is done, the next play is the Turn-Player and has 3 cards to play, etc. Defense from Opponent's attack is played from cards left in hand after the 1-3 turn-cards are played.<br/><br/>COMBATANT REQUIREMENTS: 2 Warriors each get a Shield, Helmet, Sword and Spear. 1 Archer gets a Helmet, Bow and Quiver.<br/><br/>The game is configured and sold for 2 Player action (optimal play).

This game covers the Italian Front in World War I. There are five scenarios covering the offensives of each year.<br/><br/>May 1915 (1st Isonzo):  The Italian army attempts to enter Austria-Hungary across the Isonzo River, towards Trieste. The Austro-Hungarian army is dug in and waiting for them. The first battles along the Isonzo are a futile foreshadowing of what is to come.<br/><br/>May 1916 (Strafexpedition): The Chief of Staff of the Austro Hungarian army, Conrad von Hotzendorff, feels the time is right to strike a blow against Italy. He ignores the advice of the German chief of staff, von Falkenhayn, who foresees the main threat to be on the Russian Front. The Italians in the southern Tirol have neglected their rear area defenses. This and the fury of the Austro-Hungarian attack put the Italian army in peril. Cadorna, the head of the Italian army, rushes reinforcements to the front. It is a dicey affair, but the Italian lines hold fast. The threat to the Italian armies along the Isonzo is checked.<br/><br/>May 1917 (10th Isonzo): In endless offensives, valiant Italian infantry go over the top and into the maelstrom of the Isonzo. Each battle differs from the last only by its increasing intensity and skyrocketing casualty lists. In the end, both armies are exhausted. The Italians have become weary of the war, but the Austrians feel that one more attack along the Isonzo will break through.<br/><br/>October 1917 (Caporetto): When the Central Powers strike, they break through the Italian front lines along the headwaters of the Isonzo. German and Austrian units pour through the mountain passes and into the Italian rear. Caporetto is an overwhelming victory for the Central Powers. But Italy is not defeated and her citizens rally for another year of war.<br/><br/>June 1918 (Albrecht and Radetzky): Conrad's attacks across the Piave are initially successful, but his divisions quickly bog down. The Austrians are unable to push their bridgeheads far enough forward to keep their pontoon bridges out of range of Italian artillery.

Recent Russian pressure had almost cracked the final Austro-Hungarian defensive lines in the Carpathians, and new pressure was being brought to bear on Germany's weak ally by the Italians, who had just entered the war.<br/><br/>To help the Austro-Hungarians, a new German army is formed under the capable von Mackensen, and placed in the line east of Crackow. After a furious hurricane barrage, von Mackensen attacks and completely pierces the Russian lines. A Russian retreat ensues that enables the Central Powers' forces to recapture most of Galicia.<br/><br/>Von Falkenhayn wanted to stop operations at this point and shift to the west, but pressure from the Kaiser, at the insistance of Hindenburg and Ludendorff, resulted in a widening of the offensive. Attacks were then launched in the northern sector of the eastern front as well. Enveloped on two sides, the Russians reacted with their classic response, a retreat back into Russia, leaving Russian Poland to the Germans.<br/><br/>The Central Powers offensive wound down as they struggled to supply troops hundreds of miles past the supply heads. The offensive has saved Austria-Hungary from immediate peril, but it does not knock Russia out of the war. And instead of enabling von Falkenhayn to focus on the west, most of the newly created German forces are fed into the increasing vastness of the eastern front.<br/><br/>The Brusilov Offensive: June 1916<br/><br/>In response to French pleas for help to relieve the pressure at Verdun, the Russian STAVKA authorizes a major offensive. General Brusilov plans attacks all along the front of his Southwest Army Group aiming primarily at Austro-Hungarian positions. His belief is that attacks across the width of his front will prevent the enemy from being able to quickly reinforce areas under local attack.<br/><br/>The Austro-Hungarians are caught off-guard as their focus is a new offensive of their own in Italy. The Russian attacks achieves numerous breakthroughs in numerous sectors and many Austro-Hungarian units are completely routed. The Russians take hundreds of thousands of prisoners and advance tens of miles, recapturing significant cities.<br/><br/>German reinforcements are rushed from the north and from Verdun. The Germans also take over command of almost the entire eastern front, and Austria-Hungary is placed in a subserviant position. The Russian offensive peters out as Brusilov's forces start to experience supply shortages, and Central Powers' resistance stiffens.<br/><br/>Brusilov had planned on support from Russian armies to the north to pin down German forces with attacks of their own, but they failed to support him. The losses mount and, after months of fighting, the Russians finally call a halt to further attacks.<br/><br/>The Brusilov Offensive did relieve the pressure on the French and it came very close to knocking Austria-Hungary out of the war. Had Brusilov been supported by his peers to the north, and by the Russian Allies (including the hesitant Romanians) the war might well have been won by the Entente in 1916.<br/><br/><br/>This game contains 2 scenarios covering the Gorlice-Tarnow offensive of 1915 and the Brusilov Offensive of 1916.<br/><br/>NOTE: This is not a stand-alone game.

Played using counters or miniatures figures (54mm or 25mm) on a hex grid. For two or more players.<br/><br/>Gladiators was designed as a system for single figure miniatures combat. But it is more like a role-playing game's combat system than a traditional miniatures system. Combat takes place on a hex grid making Gladiators similar in nature to Steve Jackson's Melee system (the combat system which evolved into The Fantasy Trip which eventually evolved into GURPS). Of course, the rules are a bit more specialized than Melee in that they focus on the gladiator combat of ancient Rome.<br/><br/>Gladiators took two years of play-testing and conceptual development to create. A set of playable yet detailed and realistic rules for simulating gladiatorial combat. Players will be able to move their gladiators, feint, and dodge about as they prepare to lunge at their adversaries. They can slash or jab at their chosen targets, and must parry the return blows of their opponent. Shields can be used to bash opponents off guard. Accidents also have a place in this simulated universe. Men can trip or stumble, weapons or shields can be dropped, or nets cut to shreds. In short, an imaginative player can momentarily enter the arena and prepare himself for a contest which will be won or lost by the same elements that brought victory or defeat, fame and wealth or sudden death to a gladiator. Skills, cleverness, foresight, and luck all play their respective roles.<br/><br/>These rules open a new dimension of wargaming--the realistic and exciting simulation of one man versus one man in the arena. Give them a try. You'll find a game hard to beat for moments of challenge.<br/><br/>Contains 1 cardstock sheet of tables printed on both sides and 1 cardstock hex sheet printed on both sides (2 difference sized hexes, one size on each printed side).<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": ["Fantasy Games Unlimited First Edition"], "average": "5.79167", "name": "Gladiators", "playingtime": "20", "boardgamemechanic": ["Hex-and-Counter", "Simultaneous Action Selection"], "age": "12", "usersrated": "12", "boardgamesubdomain": ["Wargames"], "boardgamefamily": ["Ancient Rome", "Gladiators"]}, "7768": {"boardgamedesigner": ["Bruce Lutz", "Fitzhugh R.

For the Gauls it meant subjugation. For the gamer, it means six battles of Pure Excitement.<br/><br/>Bibracte 58BC     <br/>Caesar is called on by the Aeudui to repel the Helvetii. Caesar corners the Helvetii near the Aeudui oppidum, Bibracte, and forces them to attack him. The Helvetii fall back, regroup and, as Caesar's legions march toward them, attack again. At this moment, contingents of the Boii and Tulingi tribes hit Caesar's right flank.<br/><br/>The Rhine 58BC     <br/>Having defeated the Helvetii, Caesar is now asked by the Gauls to do the same against the aggressive Germans. The German tribes are led by a very capable and wily chief, Ariovistus -- he outmaneuvers Caesar to cut his supply line, to which Caesar reacts by outbluffing the Germans so that their lines are now cut.<br/><br/>The Sabis 57BC     <br/>Having decided to pacify Gaul, Caesar realizes he will have to start in the north, with the Belgae, the most dangerous tribe. He marches against them, reaching the banks of the Sabis (today, the Sambre) River. Without warning the Nervii and their allies, the Viromandui and Atrebates, emerge from the woods in full barbarian fury.<br/><br/>Bay of Biscay 56BC     <br/>The sea-oriented Amorican tribes of NW Gaul proved most difficult. They could not be defeated on land, so had to be attacked at sea. For that purpose, Caesar had his men build an entire fleet of biremes from scratch in less than two months. The Roman fleet, under Admiral Decimus Junius Brutus faced a difficult foe.<br/><br/>Britannia 55BC     <br/>Late Summer, and Caesar decides to cross the Channel. A fleet of 80 warships and transports reach the shores of Britannia near modern Dover. But their cavalry has been dispersed by a storm, and the Romans have a difficult time beaching their galleys. The Romans are beset by large numbers of Britons.<br/><br/>Lutetia 52BC     <br/>There are rumblings of a Gallic uprising, and Caesar sends his right-hand-man Titus Labienus, with four legions, against the local tribes around what is now Paris (Lutetia). After some up and down river maneuvering by both armies, the Gauls attack Labienus in a classic set-piece battle that serves as a learning scenario.<br/><br/>Game Components:<br/><br/>    840 multi-colored counters <br/>    Two double-sided 22x34&quot; full-color mapsheets<br/>    One 10-sided die<br/>       26-page Rule Book<br/>        16-page Play Book<br/>        8-page Naval Scenario Book<br/>        Player Aid Cards: One double-sided 8.5x11&quot; card and one 11x17&quot; card showing game charts and tables.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Game Features:<br/><br/>        Eight of Rome's most vaunted legions, including Caesar's favorite, the Xth, and its maximum-rated 1st cohort...each with its own artillery, auxiliares and hired cavalry.<br/>        Ten tribes of sword-armed, axe-throwing barbarian infantry, fueled by special rules for Barbarian Impetuosity and Ferocity.<br/>        For the first time in the GBoH system, war galleys, sail ships and transports...all in a preview of the Naval Warfare system for the series.<br/>        A much simplified command system (as opposed to the hierarchical system in Julius Caesar: The Civil Wars), reflecting the smaller Roman armies as well as the leadership theories of the tribes.<br/>        All three major land battles of the war, a full-scale invasion scenario as well as a smaller battle perfect for getting a feel for the game.<br/>        Special rules for Hit and Run tactics, as well as revised artillery use mechanics.<br/>        The *feared German cavalry...a combination of light horse and light infantry so effective that even the disciplined Romans sought to avoid confrontation.<br/>        A system that is perfect for solitaire play.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>TIME SCALE:     20 minutes per turn<br/>MAP SCALE:     75 yards per hex<br/>UNIT SCALE:     100-150 men per size point<br/>NUMBER OF PLAYERS:     One to four<br/><br/>(source: GMT website)<br/><br/><br/>Expansion Modules:<br/><br/>     Caratacus: two battles from the Claudian invasion of Britannia<br/>     Gergovia: Caesar's defeat in 52 BCE<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": ["GMT Games First Edition", "GMT Games Second edition"], "average": "7.3444", "name": "Caesar: Conquest of Gaul", "playingtime": "240", "boardgamemechanic": ["Dice Rolling", "Hex-and-Counter", "Simulation"], "age": "12", "boardgameexpansion": ["42208", "11678", "20076", "42213", "1347", "25603", "62425"], "usersrated": "232", "boardgamesubdomain": ["Wargames"], "boardgamefamily": ["Ancient Rome", "Great Battles of History"], "boardgamepodcastepisode": ["Episodio 7 \u2013 Los primeros juegos"]}, "7844": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic128081.jpg", "poll": [], "boardgamedesigner": ["Joe Angiolillo", "Joseph M.

The objective of the Germans is to push through the Ardennes, then cross the Meuse River and head for Antwerp. Hitler hopes to split the Allied armies apart and smash their vital supply port at Antwerp. Can the Americans stop them?<br/><br/>Historically, the German army trampled the American VIII Corps and penetrated within two miles of the Meuse. The Americans stubbornly fought the Germans at many critical crossroads slowing and then stopping Germany's elite forces. Historically, the German offensive achieved little except to create a &quot;bulge&quot; in the American line.<br/><br/>Ardennes '44 explores this fascinating campaign with a detailed order of battle and an extremely accurate Ardennes game map which covers the area from the Our River to the Meuse. Ardennes '44 covers the period from December 16th to the 26th. Two shorter one-map scenarios are included which cover the initial stages of the German attack. The Ardennes '44 game system is designed by Mark Simonitch, winner of the CSR James F. Dunnigan Award for Design Elegance and Best WWII Board Game of 2000 for Ukraine '43.<br/><br/>The result is Ardennes '44, a game that both the &quot;Bulge enthusiast&quot; and the casual player will enjoy.

There are 180 huge and thick playing pieces like those in Granada, 165 smaller marker pieces, two large hard-mounted game boards like that in Granada, and 64 cards.<br/><br/>The map stretches from Britain to Persia, North Africa to Norway. Europe is divided into areas, each of them rated for their resources, manpower potential, and defense value. Armies move along the routes that connect these areas, and the object of the game is to conquer and hold as much territory as you can. Soldier Emperor is very true to history but is easily playable by anyone with an interest in games or history.<br/><br/>This is probably the first time that Persia has appeared in a Napoleonic wargame, but the Persians fought the Russians twice in this period and also threatened war with the Turks. They receive two armies, plus their fine leader, Crown Prince Abbas Mirza.<br/><br/>Turkey's eastern border regions are shown as well: Kurdistan and Baghdad appear. Unlike other games, the Turkish player can't operate with a secure right flank but must worry about his or her &quot;back door.&quot; The Turks begin with rather mediocre leadership, Ebubekir and Bayrakdar on land and Seyit Ali on the sea. But once Sultan Selim is overthrown (an event brought about by card play), Turkish leadership improves as junior generals are promoted. The Turks also can deploy the Banner of the Prophet, using Mohammed's ancient flag to inspire their troops.<br/><br/>Austria has a large army, one good general for most of the game (Archduke Charles) and a slim chance to receive an excellent one (Radetzky) and another good one (Frimont) late in the game. The rest of the Austrian generalship is not so good, and the empire is surrounded by potential enemies.<br/><br/>Prussia is small and relatively weak, but does have two fair generals (Yorck and Bl&uuml;cher) and a good army. But if the army is lost in action Prussia's low resources and manpower will make the losses difficult to replace.<br/><br/>France of course has Napoleon, some other very good generals, and the largest army in the game. The French player also has the Imperial Guard. France has a powerful economy and strong starting position &ndash; and a large target painted right on the French player's back. France's revolutionary ways bring its player a number of game advantages (in movement and battle) and some disadvantages as well (in diplomacy, at least until France's enemies have been beaten into submission).<br/><br/>Britain has the expected advantages: large income from overseas trade, a powerful fleet, and Lord Nelson. They also have a couple of lesser admirals (Collingwood and Jervis) and the outstanding Duke of Wellington to lead the land forces. But the army is small, and hard to replace if lost.<br/><br/>Spain can call out guerrillas if invaded, and will need every advantage to offset its weak economy, poor generalship and second-rate army. The fleet is good, and Gravina is a good admiral. Spain also has access to several minor countries that others can't easily reach, and a starting position in Italy that can allow for quick expansion (Etruria, held by a Spanish prince in 1803).<br/><br/>Russia, the final player-controlled country, has a vast land area, a strong position on the edge of the board, and a large and strong army. Leadership is good, with Kutusov and Kamensky the best of the lot plus Senyavin to command the fleet. But as in Soldier Kings, the Russian player will be chronically short of cash and willing to do many things to change this.<br/><br/>As in Soldier Kings, the game can be played with fewer than seven players, all the way down to two. Card play drives the action, with players able to play cards at any time and thwart their opponents' plans. Play order is determined by each country's initiative, and generals and admirals move their forces from area to area. And like Soldier Kings, combat is simple to resolve but contains many wrinkles of strategy.<br/><br/>If you liked Soldier Kings, you'll adore Soldier Emperor. Play is fast and furious, strategies are many, and the excitement level is high. A game lasts about four hours, with the campaign game taking somewhat longer.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": ["First edition", "Second edition", "Third edition"], "maxplaytime": "240", "average": "6.11038", "name": "Soldier Emperor", "playingtime": "240", "boardgamemechanic": ["Campaign / Battle Card Driven", "Point to Point Movement"], "age": "14", "boardgameexpansion": ["191636", "104444"], "usersrated": "106", "boardgamesubdomain": ["Wargames"], "boardgamefamily": ["Gunpowder Strategy"]}, "7862": {"boardgamedesigner": ["Stacey Merrill"], "average": "5.52364", "poll": [], "name": "Birds, Bugs and Beans", "playingtime": "30", "minplayers": "2", "yearpublished": "2003", "usersrated": "55", "boardgamesubdomain": ["Children's Games"], "maxplayers": "6", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1600609_t.jpg", "boardgameartist": ["Scott Fleenor"], "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["R&R Games"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1600609.jpg", "boardgameversion": ["English first edition"], "maxplaytime": "30", "boardgamecategory": ["Action / Dexterity", "Children's Game", "Humor"], "age": "6", "minplaytime": "30", "description": "From the publisher:<br/><br/>It's a party in the jungle and you're invited!

The Vector starts in the middle of the board, which is ruled off in squares.  Direction cards are played face up in turn, then all players secretly select a Distance card.  These are revealed simultaneously, and the Vector moved by each player according to the Direction/Distance cards they played.  After all players have moved the Vector, a new round begins with the Vector in the current location and a new first player.<br/><br/>Many of the squares contain actions (plus/minus scoring, mandatory Vector redirects, lost turns, etc.) that are performed when the Vector ends a player's turn there.  Scores are totaled after 12 rounds of play, leveling out the advantage of being the first to move the Vector.<br/><br/>To add some tension, each player has a &quot;Goal&quot; of three squares on their side of the board.  When a goal is scored, by moving the vector into it, the player to whom the goal belongs immediately doubles their score - whether positive or negative - and the game ends.<br/><br/>As with similar blind action games (Basari, Dragon Delta, Robo Rally to name a few), astutely predicting your opponents' intent and disguising your own is the key.  It takes some analysis to determine all the possible options, but not so much as to cause paralysis.  Guessing right three times and scoring big when playing last in a round is very satisfying!  The constant surprises due to bluffs and doublethink make this a light, entertaining game.<br/><br/>"}, "7940": {"boardgamedesigner": ["(Uncredited)"], "poll": [], "name": "Cheops", "playingtime": "30", "minplayers": "1", "boardgamemechanic": ["Pattern Building"], "yearpublished": "1977", "usersrated": "3", "boardgamesubdomain": ["Abstract Games"], "maxplayers": "4", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic664023_t.jpg", "average": "4.83333", "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["Cydot Products"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic664023.jpg", "maxplaytime": "30", "boardgamecategory": ["Abstract Strategy", "Ancient"], "age": "0", "minplaytime": "30", "description": "From the instructions:<br/><br/>CHEOPS is a recreational and educational game of skill and logic for 1, 2, 3, or 4 players.

The game uses a two-dimensional movement system; the &ldquo;plane&rdquo; of the playing area represents the ecliptic of the star system in which each battle occurs. Each Game-Turn represents 15 minutes.<br/><br/>During play, each player moves one or more spaceships about the game-map using a maneuver system that abstractly simulates the laws of Newtonian motion. Each spaceship is composed of a hull with a varying number of attached pods. Each pod represents a system that improves the ship&rsquo;s capabilities in combat, movement, and/or some other aspect of spaceship operations.<br/><br/>Each player controls his spaceships by issuing Maneuver Commands (so that the ship may alter its velocity or direction of movement) and Battle Commands (so that weapons and other systems aboard the ship may be prepared for use). A spaceship&rsquo;s combat abilities include laser fire, particle fire, four types of missiles, and battle craft (two man fighter craft launched from larger ships). The attributes of each spaceship are recorded on a Spaceship Log before beginning play. During the game, energy expended, missiles launched, and damage incurred by the ship are recorded on the ship&rsquo;s log.<br/><br/>Delta Vee is the tactical space combat system for SPI&rsquo;s science fiction role-playing game, Universe.

It is, so far as we know, the first and only playable form of chess in three dimensions. A number of attempts have been made over the years to extend chess into three dimensions, but in one way or another each has suffered some flaw that has compromised the integrity of the basic game, and therefore none has been generally accepted. We feel that Hyperchess overcomes these problems and is for the first time a viable three-dimensional version of chess.<br/><br/>The regular rules of chess apply in Hyperchess, and the object of the game remains the same--to checkmate the opponent's king.  In addition, the game is played on the same number of board squares as traditional chess, with the same number of chessmen who keep their same moves.  The dramatic difference is, of course, that play is extended into the next dimension.  Each chessman may move vertically as well as horizontally.  This opens up exciting new possibilities for the world's oldest and most popular game.<br/><br/>"}, "7999": {"boardgamedesigner": ["Brian L. Knipple", "Brien J.
