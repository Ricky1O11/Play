The use of FACs keeps the action moving along at a pace simulating the real sport.<br/><br/>All of the action comes from the players&rsquo; cards with no chart lookups needed. In ITP, each player will have 3 columns per card showing regular offense, offensive rebound and fastbreak sections. In each section the players frequency of 2/3 FGA, drawing fouls, turnovers and assists come into play. For the Dennis Rodman types when the offense does come his way a simple PASS may be the outcome. Each player has separate GOTO ratings where the more they are involved in the offense the better chance you will see him be called upon to make a play. You often see players that don't have great offensive stats (FG%, TO) but these are often guys that have to create offense. If you don't have a any offensive weapons (good or bad) on the floor then you will see the offense bog down in ITP.<br/><br/>Defense in ITP is not an afterthought and is intertwined into the game at all points. Players are rated separately for steals, blocks, committing fouls and overall defense. A special DENY rating for defensive players works with the aforementioned GOTO ratings where good defenders can actually keep a player from being able to take an action on the court. The defensive ratings come into play in what are called possible defensive stops. There are special notations on the FACs that can possibly stop an offensive action or affect a shot.<br/><br/>ITP keeps the action moving with a fastbreak system that is simple yet effective to use. The run-and-gun style teams will feel that way as will the plodders. Each player gets a fastbreak rating that shows his propensity to get out on the break and, when he does, his card has a column just for that event.<br/><br/>The special Momentum Factor (*MOM) is built into the FACs and either gives a team a boost or causes them to miss some shots. The use of timeouts can readjust this factor and keep the game on an even keel but you must use them wisely as timeouts can be very useful towards the end of a game allowing you to call plays and get extra time when you may need it. Managing timeouts can be very challenging. If you use too many timeouts for momentum swings then you will be limited to using your TO's for subs and especially late in a very close game when you want to call a designed play to a specific player. However, not calling timeouts on a momentum run can cause the game to get out of control, thus hurting a teams' chances to win.<br/><br/>So, if basketball is your game, get out of your seat and get Inside the Paint!<br/><br/>"}, "62624": {"statistics": {}, "name": "Saga (Issue 14 - Jul 1992)", "rpgproducer": {"30623": "Signe Dahl-Madsen"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic611882.jpg", "usersrated": "0", "average": "0", "rpgissue": {"3840": "Saga (Danish)"}, "rpgissuearticle": {"50607": "Anmeldelse"}, "rpg": {"191": "Advanced Dungeons & Dragons (1st Edition)"}, "rpgissueversion": {"17328": "saga #14"}, "poll": {}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic611882_t.jpg", "description": "Index:<br/>1 Forside (Front page): Jesper Ejsing<br/>2 Indholdsfortegnelse (Index)<br/>3 Leder (Editorial): Kasper Thing Mortensen<br/>4 Nyheder (News): Mikkel Kolbak S&oslash;rensen<br/>6 Biograf i dagligstuen (Cinema in your living room): Christian Peter Koch S&oslash;rensen<br/>9 Midg&aring;rd - Anmeldelse (Review): Martin Stachowski Winther<br/>12 Llandroths Forbandelse (The Curse of Llandroth): Michael Galle<br/>21 Greyhawk - Temaanmeldelse (Theme review): Bo Giedekier Andersen<br/>24 Spilverdenen (Game world)<br/>27 Play-By-Mail: S&oslash;ren Busck-Knudsen<br/>29 Ardoffs Pirater (The Pirates of Ardoff): Christian Peter Koch S&oslash;rensen<br/>39 Brevkassen (Letters)<br/>41 Anmeldelse - Al-Quadim (Review): Matias Stuven<br/>42 Abonnementsoplysninger (subscription information)<br/>44 N&aelig;ste nummer (Next issue)<br/><br/>"}, "62626": {"boardgamedesigner": {"2": {"name": "Reiner Knizia"}}, "average": "5.83333", "poll": {}, "name": "Gelini Nightlife", "playingtime": "20", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": {"2035": "Roll / Spin and Move"}, "yearpublished": "2009", "usersrated": "24", "maxplayers": "5", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic634908_t.jpg", "boardgameartist": {"76990": "J\u00f6rg Zahradnicek"}, "statistics": {}, "boardgamepublisher": {"38": {"name": "Schmidt Spiele"}}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic634908.jpg", "boardgameversion": {"98073": "First edition"}, "maxplaytime": "20", "boardgamecategory": {"1054": {"name": "Music"}}, "age": "7", "minplaytime": "20", "description": "It's Saturday evening and lots of guests are waiting outside the discotheques to be let in.

The game contents consist of a deck of 70 cards, each illustrated in a &lsquo;70s/&lsquo;80s retro art style, and a rule sheet, attractively packaged in a small black cardboard box.  Most of what you need to know is printed on the cards themselves and makes picking up and getting into the game very easy.  The use of icons on the cards, representing different aspects of the game (e.g. the discard pile, the play area and your hand of cards), makes the game even easier to understand.<br/><br/>The game is designed for 2 to 6 players of ages 7 and up.  Games can take as little as 5 minutes or as long as 30 minutes to play - depending on the experience of players and the number of players in each game.<br/><br/>The objective of the game is to be the first player with 100 points down on the table, which isn&rsquo;t as easy as it sounds.  Players have cards that can steal cards you have tabled or send them to the discard pile.  So you need to be able to judge the best time to put cards on the table and how to defend your cards once they are down.<br/><br/>Game-play is highly interactive and the base rules are simple to follow to make it accessible to casual and non-gamers as well as dedicated gamers.  At the start of play, each person is dealt a hand of five cards.  These cards each have values clearly printed on them, ranging from negative amounts to a maximum of 20 points.  They also have actions printed on them, along with a graphic (which features some pun on vision such as &lsquo;wink&rsquo; or &lsquo;blind spot&rsquo;).  The action associated with an individual card is usually executed as you attempt to put the card face up into your play area (known as your Field of View).  There are a few cards (such as Spectacles) that allow you to play the card as a reaction to other players trying to affect your cards.<br/><br/>While your first few games of Viewpoint might not appear to involve a high degree of skill for winning, you will soon discover that you need to be much more strategic about how and when you play your cards, as well as keeping a careful eye on what people have got down on the table.  Simply placing cards into your Field of View won&rsquo;t win you the game, as other players will start targeting you as you hit a score of around 80+. You need think &lsquo;out of the box&rsquo; and bluff your opponents, by sitting on a &lsquo;non-threatening&rsquo; score, while searching for cards that will let you steal cards or take multiple turns, allowing you to suddenly win the game by coming from behind.<br/><br/>The design of the game system provides an entertaining and interactive experience encouraging replayability.  The games system also provides the opportunity to release future expansion packs of cards to add to the mischief already present in the base deck.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": {"349986": "English first edition"}, "name": "Viewpoint", "playingtime": "15", "boardgamemechanic": {"2040": "Hand Management"}, "age": "7", "boardgameexpansion": {}, "usersrated": "59", "average": "5.90102"}, "62639": {"boardgamedesigner": {"10724": {"name": "Peter Kaszian"}}, "poll": {}, "name": "Hi!Noon: Das Duell", "playingtime": "15", "minplayers": "2", "yearpublished": "2009", "usersrated": "3", "boardgamesubdomain": {"4666": "Abstract Games"}, "maxplayers": "2", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic612408_t.jpg", "average": "7.33333", "statistics": {}, "boardgamepublisher": {"4": {"name": "(Self-Published)"}}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic612408.jpg", "maxplaytime": "15", "boardgamecategory": {"1009": {"name": "Abstract Strategy"}}, "age": "6", "minplaytime": "15", "description": "HI!Noon - Das Duell is a four-in-a-row game on a 4&times;4&times;4 cube.  32 black and 32 white balls are used.

Each player, at the end of his turn, moves two of the face-down counters around the board. You can move these counters to block the way to other players or even in a square with another player to force him to fight with the enemy knight you just moved!

Playing a game with SuperSystem requires the following: a copy of these rules, painted miniatures, around 20 six-sided dice (D6&rsquo;s), copies of the SuperSheets printed in the appendix of this book, pencils, and a roughly 4&rsquo; x 4&rsquo; playing area.<br/><br/>SuperSystem is an ideal game for two players, but more participants can get involved for longer, multi-player games. Battles in SuperSystem can involve as few as two models per side, or as many as ten to thirty models per side. There are two basic types of models in SuperSystem: characters and henchmen. Characters are the heroes and villains that make up the superhuman population of Four-Color Earth, the fictional setting of the game. Henchmen are their underlings, goons, mooks, or cannon fodder. Although some henchmen can also possess superhuman powers, they never rise to levels of the characters.<br/><br/>Players may fight SuperSystem battles as one-off encounters, or as extended campaigns where their heroes and villains develop unique personalities, gain new abilities, and sometimes suffer grievous injuries. These developments occur over a number of game sessions, and are known in SuperSystem as Series.<br/><br/>This revises SuperSystem 2nd Edition.<br/><br/>"}, "62709": {"boardgamedesigner": {"3": {"name": "(Uncredited)"}}, "poll": {}, "name": "Funglish", "playingtime": "0", "minplayers": "3", "yearpublished": "2009", "usersrated": "270", "boardgamesubdomain": {"5498": "Party Games"}, "maxplayers": "99", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1836808_t.jpg", "average": "5.66315", "statistics": {}, "boardgamepublisher": {"51": {"name": "Hasbro"}}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1836808.jpg", "boardgameversion": {"87533": "Hasbro English edition 2009"}, "maxplaytime": "0", "boardgamecategory": {"1025": {"name": "Word Game"}}, "age": "12", "minplaytime": "0", "description": "There&rsquo;s no time to lose&hellip; so grab some clues!

Special actions include being able to scan a far-away planet, harvest extra resources, swap locations with another player, etc.<br/><br/>When players &quot;Jump&quot;, they add one of their markers to the Jump Gate Board.  The player with the most markers on the Jump Gate Board at the end of the game gains an extra 5 points.  If a player collects a Resource that has a &quot;Black Hole&quot; icon on it, a marker is added to the Black Hole Board.  If too many markers get added to that board, the game ends and the player with the most markers on the Black Hole Board loses some of his/her collected Resources.  The game can also end when all non-Black-Hole Resources have been collected from all of the planets.<br/><br/>Scoring is done at the end of the game, and players are awarded points for Scanning and Claiming Planets, as well as for the combination of Resources they had collected.  Each type of Resource has a different method for scoring -- but all encourage a player to collect as much of that Resource as possible.  The player with the most total points is the winner.<br/><br/>3rd Edition Gameplay Changes<br/>The 3rd Edition, published in a smaller box with artwork and player component updates, also included a number of design changes:<br/><br/>    Max. Players is reduced to 5<br/>    New &quot;Sand&quot; resource replaces the &quot;Nothing&quot; cards from earlier editions<br/>    Setup changes include giving players two or three hidden resource cards (as opposed to a single face-up card) and not every resource getting used in the game<br/>    In-game changes include cleaner, more thematic scanning and harvesting rules<br/>    The Black Hole only has 7 marker spaces on it, and triggering the end game via the Black Hole results in the player with the most markers on the Black Hole losing their hidden resources they received during setup instead of randomly-chosen resources<br/>    No points are scored for scanning or the Jump Gate ... only the resources collected and Planets claimed<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": {"214552": "English third edition"}, "name": "Jump Gate", "playingtime": "45", "boardgamemechanic": {"2040": "Hand Management"}, "age": "12", "usersrated": "141", "boardgamesubdomain": {"5499": "Family Games"}, "average": "6.31407"}, "62810": {"statistics": {}, "name": "Far & Away (Issue 2 - Nov 1990)", "rpgproducer": {"46814": "Hilary Ayer"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic613990.jpg", "usersrated": "0", "average": "0", "rpgissue": {"4172": "Far & Away"}, "rpgissuearticle": {"45643": "BattleTech: Hi-Tech BattleTech"}, "rpg": {"719": "2300 AD"}, "rpgissueversion": {"17480": "No. 2"}, "poll": {}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic613990_t.jpg", "description": "User Summary<br/><br/>Table of Contents<br/><br/>FEATURES<br/>- Traveller: 2300<br/><br/>     Time and Tide on Beowulf by William H.

It ain&rsquo;t much, but its home. And it ain&rsquo;t easy either, I&rsquo;ll tell you that much &lsquo;migo. Forget what you read in those back east dime novels. Life out here isn&rsquo;t all about shoot outs at high noon and stage coaches getting robbed. It&rsquo;s about moving two miles of cattle across dangerous terrain and spending two months on horseback. It&rsquo;s about gold rushes and sod busters, boomtowns and cattle barons. This is the way the west was won.<br/><br/>Homestead is a sourcebook for players and GM&rsquo;s who want to transport their characters into the world of classic TV westerns. This book details the genre of dramatic westerns set on small farms and sprawling cattle ranches. Most people envision the Old West as a place filled with gunslingers and cold blooded killers. While the western frontier did have a noticeably violent streak to it, most settlers and homesteaders faced a different array of problems. The some of the more popular television westerns of old sought to capture this dramatic struggle for survival set amidst the epic background that is the Wild West<br/><br/>The villains you face may be cut throats, gamblers, and outlaws, but they may just as well be slimy politicians, scheming cattle barons, and smooth talking con artists. Life on the open frontier means that there is always a problem to be solved and a new obstacle to overcome.

Now, with the navy gone, a handful of corvettes is a battlefleet, and a world that can build them is a major power. A single cruiser represents a massive naval force.

Valu - The Game of Survival is a abstract 2 to 4 player Game of Strategy based on Traditional Pacific island warrior culture.<br/><br/>The object of Valu is to take all of your opponent&rsquo;s pieces or to create situation where your opponent/s pieces are unable to move and are forced to surrender.<br/><br/>The board is made up of 96 light green and dark squares (= four islands), 36 light and dark blue squares (= ocean) and 28 light yellow and orange squares (= beach). Opposing pieces (= Clan), red, green, blue and/or yellow are initially lined up on the sides.<br/><br/>The game has similarities to checkers. All pieces only move diagonally, and only one space at a time. Players take turns moving one of their pieces in an attempt to capture or develop their positions. Capturing occurs when a piece is able to jump over of an opposing piece into an empty space. Capturing is mandatory and jumping/capturing more than one piece on turn is possible. Time between moves is limited and has to be mutually agreed before start of play (1 - 5 minutes). Player must decide the move before touching any of the piece and complete the move immediately. If piece is touched but not moved, it is then sacrificed and removed from the board. Each player has four Chiefs and eight Warrior/Elder pieces. Each type of piece has a slight variation on its form of movement:<br/><br/>- Chiefs are the most powerful pieces. They can move both backward and forward and move to any area on the board that is in play. Chiefs are allowed to jump over their own pieces, but only if the square adjacent to it is vacant. When jumping over your own piece the piece remains in play, however if playing in teams the team member&rsquo;s piece being jumped over is sacrificed and removed from board.<br/><br/>- Warriors can only capture and move in a forward direction. They cannot move onto another island apart from the island it started on or the island directly opposite. Warrior reaching the opposite island is immediately made an Elder (by being turned upside down).<br/><br/>- Elders can move forward or backwards and can move to all board areas that are in play. They cannot jump their own pieces or, if playing in a team, they cannot jump their team mate&rsquo;s piece<br/><br/>Valu can be played as two, three of four with only a minor variation of the rules.<br/><br/>"}, "62908": {"statistics": {}, "name": "Knights of the Dinner Table Magazine (Issue 93 - Jul 2004)", "rpgproducer": {"28474": "Jonathan Albin"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic613588.jpg", "usersrated": "1", "average": "7", "rpgissue": {"2076": "Knights of the Dinner Table"}, "rpgissuearticle": {"60843": "All Things Magic"}, "rpg": {"1298": "HackMaster (4th Edition)"}, "rpgissueversion": {"240804": "PDF Version"}, "poll": {}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic613588_t.jpg", "description": "&quot;Thursday Knight Fever&quot;<br/><br/>Cover by George Vrbanic<br/><br/>The table of contents is detailed in the Article list below.<br/><br/>"}, "62909": {"statistics": {}, "name": "Knights of the Dinner Table Magazine (Issue 92 - Jun 2004)", "rpgproducer": {"28474": "Jonathan Albin"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic613591.jpg", "usersrated": "1", "average": "7", "rpgissue": {"2076": "Knights of the Dinner Table"}, "rpgissuearticle": {"60795": "...And an Old Friend as Well"}, "rpg": {"1298": "HackMaster (4th Edition)"}, "rpgissueversion": {"240803": "PDF Version"}, "poll": {}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic613591_t.jpg", "description": "&quot;It's a Small Wurld After All&quot;<br/><br/>Cover by Blaine Taggart<br/><br/>The table of contents is detailed in the Article list below.<br/><br/>"}, "62910": {"boardgamedesigner": {"254": {"name": "Walter M\u00fcller"}}, "poll": {}, "name": "Schiebung", "playingtime": "0", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": {"2081": "Route/Network Building"}, "yearpublished": "1985", "usersrated": "0", "boardgamesubdomain": {"4666": "Abstract Games"}, "maxplayers": "4", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic622571_t.jpg", "average": "0", "statistics": {}, "boardgamepublisher": {"79": {"name": "Walter M\u00fcller's Spielewerkstatt"}}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic622571.jpg", "boardgameversion": {"117583": "First Publication"}, "maxplaytime": "0", "boardgamecategory": {"1009": {"name": "Abstract Strategy"}}, "age": "0", "minplaytime": "0", "description": "The wooden game board has 6 x 6 &quot;rail&quot; intersections.

Roberts Best Post-Napoleonic to Pre-World War 2 Era Board Wargame Nominee"}, "description": "from MMP's website:<br/><br/>In September of 1862 after months of uninterrupted and spectacular successes, Robert E. Lee's Army of Northern Virgina was poised to win the war.<br/><br/>Lee has beaten back McClellan's Army of the Potomac from the gates of Richmond, routed Pope's Army of Virginia, and built a reputation of invincibility.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, Lincoln had already penned the Emancipation Proclamation which would recast the war from one of a political disagreement over Federal control to a moral crusade which just could not be argued away. He just needed a victory to cast the entire war in an a new strategic light.<br/><br/>All could very well be decided by what happens in the western part of Maryland over a few days.<br/><br/>McClellan fought Lee's army back to the banks of the Antietam creek near the town of Sharpsburg. There both armies stood to fight the bloodiest single day battle in American history. The final decision is in your hands.<br/><br/>None but Heroes is a game about that terrible day. Players tackle each other head-on. Can you do better than McClellan? Can you fight McClellan off like Lee? The stakes couldn't be higher!<br/><br/>None but Heroes is the first game in the new Line of Battle Series. While drawing on the lessons of over 20 years of ACW design work of its two ancestor series, LoB represents the next generation of ACW game design. No stone was left unturned in making this system the best gaming experience possible. All the unit rosters and paperwork that interfered with the fighting is gone. The typical (and time consuming) multiple fire phases have all been integrated into movement so the action is non-stop.<br/><br/>For the first time, the rat fight feel of the ACW open battlefield comes alive. The historical units (generally regiments of infantry and batteries of cannon) actually show the combined arms interactions and tactics available at the time. Old hands will see the history in a new light as they explore the implications of more recent research.<br/><br/>Representing many years of original research, the game contains information not available anywhere else regarding the strength, equipment, location, capabilities, and order of battle of both armies. Extensive historical notes layout just some of the myriad of details included in the units, scenarios, and map.<br/><br/>As one small example, it explores the frequently overlooked &quot;Green&quot; units at the battle (units which have been in the army for a few weeks or even less). The Green units will make you look at McClellan's strength in a whole new way. This is a level of &quot;greenness&quot; well beyond the usual sense of &quot;not having been in combat, yet&quot;. These are enthusiastic men, but some of whom have not yet been taught to load their muskets.<br/><br/>The Union player is only mildly inhibited by his McClellan persona; you can try a lot of different approaches to cutting the Rebels down to size. You are equipped with the same heavy guns and infantry with just as much grit and determination as he was.<br/><br/>The Confederate player will need to use his thin forces wisely, but cannot fail to counterattack as needed to blunt Union advances. You must use your troop's elan to make up for their limited numbers.<br/><br/>The game features four two-map scenarios which allow players to pick up the action at various times during the day and the morning of the next. The ability to start play the day after the battle allows players a chance to explore the options available on that day. Each of the other three scenarios can alternatively be played as a two day campaign game.<br/><br/>In addition to the large scenarios above, there are four smaller scenarios involving only portions of one map. One is a very short learning scenario showing the charge of Hood's Texans into the Cornfield. The other three isolate key actions of the battle: The compete Cornfield fight, the Battle for the Sunken Road, and the final attack by Burnside to take Sharpsburg and the counterattack by A.P.

In the 16th century, alchemists made attempts to do that in their laboratories, aspiring to gain wealth and never-ending fame. Some, as Edward Kelley, thanks to royal sponsors, achieved all that, nevertheless they never succeeded in transmutation of metals&hellip; In this magical game that you are holding it&rsquo;s very simple. <br/>Build a laboratory and collect the necessary components. And transformation of metals? If you manage to adjust to the changing moods of the Spirit of Transmutation, then it&rsquo;s really not complicated at all. So, what is the game about? You have competition in your town &ndash; other alchemists who also know the right technology. Only the one of you who is the most efficient will win recognition and fame. It will surely last until the next game, or, who knows, perhaps eternally&hellip;<br/><br/>Players will try to be the most effective alchemist.<br/>To achieve that they will need to build buildings, represented by cards. In these buildings, they will acquire resources, transform them into gold and finally sell them for victory points or cards. Selling gold isn't only way to win the game.<br/><br/>Game is using Rondel mechanic to pick an action by players and hand management, where cards represent buildings, currency and resources.<br/><br/>Alchemicus was designed as a family game with little negative interaction. Requests planning but also concentrating on other players movements and predicting them. Many beginners forget it, being focused on their own technology structure, so very often they fall behind. We think that this game style can be useful for teaching young players to think beyond their own needs. Anyway, the game is not for kids. The youngest of our testers who was able to win the play against his father was 12 years old (consider that his father is lawyer, so probably he is quite smart ;))) hahaha one of them. Father or son. we are not sure which one :D).<br/>Because the factor of negative interaction is not very strong the play goes ahead in a nice atmosphere which is fun for family play.<br/>Older players can play a bit differently, by using the position of The Transmutation Ghost to foil your opponents' plans. This strategy can be counteracted by defending yourself with buildings and goods in circulation which are resistant to your opponents' actions.<br/><br/>"}, "62980": {"boardgamedesigner": {"3": {"name": "(Uncredited)"}}, "poll": {}, "name": "Grammatical Game in Rhyme: By a Lady", "playingtime": "0", "minplayers": "2", "yearpublished": "1802", "usersrated": "0", "maxplayers": "0", "average": "0", "statistics": {}, "boardgamepublisher": {"11215": {"name": "Saml.
