You play as that most terrifying of creatures, the pretty, popular, teenage girl. The goal is simple, to accumulate enough popularity to take over the Clique and rule the school. You accomplish this by gaining the things all girls need for societal domination, The Car, The Look, The Gear and the ultimate accessory: The Guy. But your opponents, the other girls in the Clique are out to stop you with that most powerful and destructive of weapons: Gossip. Is that Look So Last Season? Is your new Car actually Used? Is your new Guy Secretly Gay? Get all four Acquisitions, free yourself from the vicious Gossip, and you can take over the Clique.<br/><br/>Mechanics<br/><br/>The deck breaks down like this:<br/><br/>6 Avatars - These are the girls, each with a unique look and style.<br/>6 Looks - From Goth to Ghetto Fabulous.<br/>6 Cars - Will you go for Classic or Import?<br/>6 Guys - If Jock is not to your liking, how about Vampire Chic?<br/>6 Gears - Do I go for the Jewelry or take the Dog?<br/>24 Gossip - Hand Me Down? Late Bloomer? Cruelty in card form.<br/>30 Specials - Remove Gossip or dramatically alter the game.<br/>50 Status - 10, 20, or 50 point cards to measure your popularity.<br/>And so we come to gameplay. I'll try to keep this simple. The players set what level of popularity they need to reach in order to win. Each turn you play from your hand to try to get Acquisitions (The Gear, The Guy, etc.) for yourself. Each one gives you 10 points each round toward that goal. But the other players can put Gossip on them. While an Acquisition has a Gossip card on it, it earns you nothing. Of course, turnabout is fair play, so you'll be attacking them with the same vicious rumors. The first to earn enough popularity while having all four Acquisitions in play with no Gossip on them takes over the Clique and rules the school.<br/><br/>Along the way, there are also unique cards to, for instance, prevent Gossip being played on your Car (My Daddy Owns A Dealership). It possible that everyone might lose their Guys in one fell swoop if someone should play Smoking In The Boys Room. The game can change dramatically from turn to turn. But isn't that the way with high school popularity? One day you are the queen, the next you are the outcast.

Its Position in the center of Europe, however, made it the perfect target for revolutionary France and in April 1792, France declared war on Austria. The first war lasted for 5 years. Austria renewed the war against France in 1799 and again in 1805, but in both cases was swiftly defeated. In April 1809, judging that Napoleon&rsquo;s army<br/>was bogged down with the fighting in Spain, Austria invaded Bavaria, but Napoleon recovered quickly and Austria&rsquo;s defeat at Wagram led to another humiliating peace treaty.<br/><br/>Even though the Austrian army was the third largest in the world, the Austrians lost many more battles than they won. At the time of the Napoleonic Wars, the Austrian army was a large multi-national army, made up of Austrians, Swedes, Hungarians, Englishmen, Scots, Irishmen, Walloons, Poles, Russians, Ukrainians, Germans, Croats, Serbs, and even French royalists.<br/>The infantry regiments were large and somewhat reliable, but the tactical formations and drill were still entrenched in the past. The cavalry, although well mounted, still applied the practice of scattering their formations in small bodies, which greatly reduced their combat effectiveness. In general, the Austrian army did enjoy many successes on a regimental level, but at the brigade, divisional and corps levels its commanders were often<br/>woefully inadequate.<br/><br/>In this expansion you will find 20 historical scenarios that focus on the Austrian Army battles from 1805 to 1809 against Napoleon, plus all the new units you&rsquo;ll need to field for these engagements.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": ["English First Edition"], "average": "8.39481", "name": "Commands & Colors: Napoleonics Expansion #3 \u2013 The Austrian Army", "playingtime": "90", "boardgamemechanic": ["Campaign / Battle Card Driven", "Dice Rolling", "Hand Management"], "age": "14", "boardgameexpansion": ["Commands & Colors: Napoleonics"], "usersrated": "183", "boardgamesubdomain": ["Wargames"], "boardgamefamily": ["Commands & Colors", "Commands & Colors: Napoleonics", "Country: Austria"]}, "112067": {"image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2199538.jpg", "poll": [], "boardgamedesigner": ["Richard Borg"], "statistics": [], "yearpublished": "2014", "maxplayers": "2", "boardgameartist": ["Rodger B.

But in spite of Prussia&rsquo;s reputation as a formidable fighting nation, Prussia withdrew from the First Coalition as an active opponent of the French Revolution and remain on the sidelines until the Fourth Coalition in 1806.<br/><br/>In 1806, the Prussian Infantry were products of a system that had not altered since the Seven Years' War. The cavalry although probably the best mounted in Europe thanks to the East Prussian horse studs, were scattered amongst the army divisions at Jena, and were committed in numerous uncoordinated attacks. In general, the lack of coordination of the arms in combat was one of the major causes of the Prussian defeat at Jena.<br/><br/>In the words of Napoleon&hellip;<br/><br/>&quot;At Jena, the Prussian army performed the finest and most spectacular maneuvers, but I soon put a stop to this tomfoolery and taught them that to fight and to execute dazzling maneuvers and wear splendid uniforms were very different matters.&quot;<br/><br/>- Napoleon<br/><br/>In 1806 Napoleon crushed the fearsome Prussian military machine. The humiliation of military defeat and being forced to cede much of its territories forced the Prussian king, Frederick William III, into much-needed military reform. The new Prussian army that emerged became one of the finest in Europe., due in part to the organizational genius of Scharnhorst and Gneisenau and in part due to Field-Marshal Prince Bl&uuml;cher, who drove his regiments to fight with relentless vigor. In 1813 Prussia rejoined the war against Napoleonic France and the Prussian army under Bl&uuml;cher, although sometimes playing second fiddle to Austria, Russia and Great Britain, was a major force in bringing an end to Napoleon Bonaparte's rule.<br/><br/>In 1815 Napoleon returned to meet the English and Prussians, which would lead to his Waterloo. Prussia&rsquo;s reward in 1815 at the Congress of Vienna was the recovery of her lost territories, as well as the whole of the Rhineland and Westphalia and other territories. Prussia therefore emerged from the Napoleonic Wars as the dominant power in Germany.<br/><br/>In this expansion you will find 18 historical scenarios that focus on the Prussian Army battles from 1806 to 1815 against Napoleon, plus all the new units you&rsquo;ll need to field for these engagements.<br/><br/>- Richard Borg<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": ["English First Edition"], "average": "8.27841", "name": "Commands & Colors: Napoleonics Expansion #4 \u2013 The Prussian Army", "playingtime": "90", "boardgamemechanic": ["Campaign / Battle Card Driven", "Dice Rolling", "Hand Management"], "age": "0", "boardgameexpansion": ["Commands & Colors: Napoleonics"], "usersrated": "132", "boardgamefamily": ["Commands & Colors", "Commands & Colors: Napoleonics"]}, "112068": {"image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1542765.jpg", "poll": [], "boardgamedesigner": ["Richard Borg"], "statistics": [], "yearpublished": "2013", "maxplayers": "2", "boardgameartist": ["Gene Billingsley", "Tony Curtis", "Pascal da Silva", "Andy Lewis", "Rodger B.

It would then suffer under &quot;Mad&quot; Tsar Paul I, until his assassination in 1801, which brought his son Alexander I to the throne. Alexander, in command of a Russian army that was as vast as the territory from which it was drawn, did his best by various treaties and alliances to counter the increasing power of France under Napoleon without going to war.<br/><br/>The Russian army at the time of Napoleonic wars still had many characteristics of Peter the Great&rsquo;s regime; senior officers were largely recruited from aristocratic circles, and the Russian soldier was regularly beaten and punished to instill discipline. Furthermore, many lower-level officers were poorly trained. Yet the Russians involved in hostilities with its neighbors - Sweden, Poland, Turkey and Austria - were capable of astonishing feats and total, blind obedience to orders.<br/><br/>In 1805 Britain and Russia signed an alliance against France. In 1806, Prussia joined the Coalition and Prussia and Russia mobilized for a fresh campaign. After Napoleon&rsquo;s humiliation of Prussia at Jena, the French Emperor turned his attention to subduing his Russian foe and marched into Poland. After a series of sanguinary battles, the French drove Russian forces out of Poland back to Mother Russia and created a new Duchy of Warsaw, but made a solid treaty between the two nations at Tilsit.<br/><br/>In 1812, the Russo-French treaty gradually became strained, as the requirement of joining France's Continental Blockade against Great Britain was a serious disruption of Russian commerce. Bonaparte decided to bring the Russians back into line in June, and invaded Russia hoping to inflict a major defeat on the Russians and force Alexander to sue for peace. The invasion of Russia and the retreat of the French army, as many historians point out, proved to be the turning point in the Napoleonic Wars.<br/><br/>In 1813 Russia opened the campaign against Napoleon joined by Prussia and Austria, and during the three-day battle of Leipzig, Bonaparte's fate was sealed.<br/><br/>In this expansion you will find 18 historical scenarios that focus on the Russian Army battles from 1806 to 1814 against Napoleon, plus all the new units you&rsquo;ll need to field for these engagements.<br/><br/>- Richard Borg<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": ["English first edition", "English second edition"], "average": "8.33006", "name": "Commands & Colors: Napoleonics Expansion #2 \u2013 The Russian Army", "playingtime": "60", "boardgamemechanic": ["Campaign / Battle Card Driven", "Dice Rolling", "Hand Management", "Hex-and-Counter"], "age": "14", "boardgameexpansion": ["Commands & Colors: Napoleonics"], "usersrated": "248", "boardgamesubdomain": ["Wargames"], "boardgamefamily": ["Commands & Colors", "Commands & Colors: Napoleonics", "Country: Russia"]}, "112069": {"poll": [], "name": "Mister Slime", "videogamemode": ["Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["North American Nintendo DS edition"], "average": "0", "videogametheme": ["Cute Fantasy"], "usersrated": "0", "videogamedeveloper": ["Lexis Numerique"], "videogamegenre": ["Platform"], "videogameplatform": ["Nintendo DS"], "statistics": [], "videogamepublisher": ["SouthPeak Games", "VectorCell"], "description": "Mister Slime (known as Mr Slime in Australia and Mr. Slime Jr. in Europe) is a video game that was first released on May 2, 2008.<br/>The game was designed by Paul Cuisset, the former lead designer of Delphine Software International and the creator of the mega-hit Flashback.<br/><br/>The players will play as the character &quot;Mister Slime&quot; in his adventure to protect the Slime Village from the evil enemy Axons.<br/><br/>Gameplay of the game is based largely around the stylus and touch-screen capabilities of the Nintendo DS.

To do this, you will need powerful spells, skills, attacks and loot. When the game begins, you are a basic hero; you can explore and fight. Luckily for you, Shadowrift is a deck-building game! You can buy new cards to add to your deck, cards that will define you as an adventurer and complement the strengths of your fellow heroes. Unlike other deck-builders, there is constant interaction with your fellow players as you figure out who will gain which benefit from the limited supply of townsfolk, offer their coin to help construct walls, and seek healing from anyone who's learned such magic.<br/><br/>Shadowrift also features monsters that don't merely sit waiting to be slain; if you leave them alone, they will rip Haven Town asunder. They'll kill people, break walls, and kick your heroes in the face. Combat with them is intuitive (though frequently painful). For defeating a monster, heroes gain Heroism, a simple, consistent boost to their power that makes them better at anything they undertake. Since the monsters won't stop coming until the last Shadowrift is sealed or the town has been built into a mighty fortress, you'll need every boost you can take.<br/><br/>The second edition of Shadowrift features many improved mechanisms, including a revised system for how monsters choose who to attack (based on types of villagers, instead of specific people) and a new system for monster powers (making them much more dangerous).

The goal is to dump all of your cards first. If the next play is running back running for 15+ yards and you have that card then you can play it. That is once less card you have to dump AND if that card you use is a + or - card then you get to dump more of your cards or have a player (or two) pick more cards up from the leftover pile. Its that simple.....AND FUN!!<br/><br/>2. Play your cards by predicting what will happen next in the game. The goal is to collect as many cards as possible. Before the next chance (inning, possession, break, etc...) each player chooses a play from the hand they are dealt. Place it face up so everyone knows whos playing what. When the first person who chose correctly wins then he/she gets to collect all the cards that were played. Plus if his/her card was a +/- card then she could get more cards from the leftover pile or they can choose the cards that other players have to dump. Trade cards are used as well and when you win with that card you get to pick a players card (blindly) to trade with your worst card. Its that simple....AND FUN!<br/><br/>***There are many other ways of playing GAME ON.

It is played on the intersections (from now on points) of a square board, which is initially empty. The suggested size is between 9x9 and 14x14. Both players must have access to a sufficient number of black and white stones. The goal of the game is to end up with the fewest groups on the board. Draws are not possible.<br/><br/><br/>Definitions<br/><br/>A group is a set of orthogonally connected, like-colored stones. A single stone is also a group.<br/><br/><br/>Rules<br/><br/>Starting with Black, players take turns placing one or two stones of any color on empty points. On his first turn, Black can only place one stone.<br/><br/>At the end of each turn, there must be an odd number of groups on the board (i.e. the sum of the number of Black and White groups must be an odd number).<br/><br/>Players can pass their turn at any moment, unless it violates the previous rule (this means Black can't pass on his first turn).<br/><br/>When both players pass in succession, the game ends. The player with the fewest groups on the board wins.<br/><br/><br/>Notes on gameplay<br/><br/>Double placement serves both as a first move equalizer and a way to make the game playable under the group restriction rule.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, apart from the intended goal of eliminating draws (they would be common otherwise), forcing an odd number of groups at the end of a turn has many interesting tactical implications. For example, groups separated by two empty points can't be joined on a single turn, since the player runs out of stones to restore the groups count to an odd number. Also, the diagonal connection is safe if the opponent has exactly one or three groups adjacent to the two neighbour points shared by both stones, and unsafe otherwise.<br/><br/>Endgames are also quite tricky under this rule: you'll often want to join two of your own groups or create another opponent group, but you'll be unable to do it because you can't restore the groups count anymore!<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": ["First edition"], "name": "Xodd", "playingtime": "45", "boardgamemechanic": ["Paper-and-Pencil", "Tile Placement"], "average": "7.1375", "usersrated": "8", "boardgamefamily": ["Combinatorial", "Connection Games"]}, "112112": {"poll": [], "name": "Winter Voices: Like a Crow on a Wire", "videogamemode": ["Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["Macintosh Downloadable edition", "Windows Downloadable edition"], "average": "0", "videogameseries": ["Winter Voices"], "videogametheme": ["Fantasy"], "usersrated": "0", "videogamedeveloper": ["Beyond the Pillars"], "videogamegenre": ["RPG"], "videogameplatform": ["Macintosh", "Windows"], "statistics": [], "videogamepublisher": ["Beyond the Pillars"], "description": "For the first time in what seems an eternity, a tiny village crushed by the huge mass of mountains indicates the presence of other human beings...

Can the goblins, elves, and dwarves put aside their differences to ally with the Great Republic of these United States? Can alchemy and sorcery stand up to locomotives and six-guns?

It combines soccer, racing, demolition derby, rocketry, and surf music into a unique action game.  Your pilot straddles a rocket (or &quot;sled&quot;) which propels you in a straight line (&quot;an object in motion stays in motion...&quot;).  You then fire grappling hooks to attempt to latch onto objects in order to steer your rocket like the Batmobile in the Batman movie of '89.  Said grappling hooks can also be used to latch onto a giant soccer ball, which can be thrown into various nets/goals to score points or better yet, thrown at your opponents to dismount them from their rockets.  You can even yank enemy &quot;jockeys&quot; off their mechanical steeds with a well aimed grapple, and then drag them around the arena. The game uses a physics engine that makes every action have a reaction.  You'll find yourself making hard left turns with a grappling hook, while a second hook is spinning the soccer ball around like a cat-o-nine tails.  All the while the surf sounds of Dick Dale are blasting in the background.  The game captures a retro vibe of a 1920s that never existed.<br/><br/>The game features 3 modes:<br/>Rocket Ball- soccer astride an out of control rocket<br/>Rocket Race- may the fastest man win<br/>Rocket War- deathmatch: smash, crash, and grapple your opponents for the win<br/><br/>There's multiple rockets and pilots to choose from, different arenas, and upgrades to earn.<br/><br/>So what are you waiting for?

C.J. and Edison form a double act of sorts with C.J. being an ardent, self-styled &quot;adventurer&quot; while Edison is the more pragmatic straight man, who frequently makes sardonic comments in response to C.J.'s grandiosity. The duo have appeared in many other JumpStart products, such as JumpStart Advanced 2nd Grade; however, their looks and personalities have both undergone enormous changes throughout the years.<br/><br/>C.J. and Edison lead the user into a secret elevator hidden behind a bookcase. This elevator leads to several different floors, most of which are caverns beneath the school. The clubhouse and the classroom levels are the only ones to contain more than one activity.

Long ago they filled up all their cemeteries with their loved (and not so loved) ones. Now they&rsquo;ve run out of room so they have taken to dumping the bodies down the sewer (out of sight out of mind). You, enterprising 3rd Class Sewer Engineers (Plungers), see a chance to make some fast money and solve the corpse clog threatening to overwhelm the existing system. At a quiet back door behind the Treatment Plant a line of customers queue up for the bits and pieces you have on offer. Deliver them the right parts, aged to the right amount of time and you&rsquo;ll receive your reward.<br/><br/>Needed to play: The deck of 27 cards<br/>10 eurocubes in each of 4 colors for the body parts (white for Bones, brown for Organs, gray for Brains and red for Hearts) and 9 black eurocubes for the rats<br/>1 eurocube marker in each of 2 other colors to keep track of player scores on the Gore Track<br/>1 large bag [or an old sock] (the Bag O&rsquo; Parts) to hold all the body parts, 10 small ziplock bags to act as body bags in the game and 1 four-sided die<br/><br/>Setup: Place the 4 Sewer Pipe cards,  Gore Track, and the score markers between the Plungers (players).<br/>Shuffle the customer deck and deal 2 customers to each Plunger, placing the rest in a face down draw pile known as &ldquo;The Queue&rdquo;, next to the Sewer Pipe. Each plunger should place their customers face up in front of them.<br/>Shuffle the tool deck and deal 3 tools to each Plunger that they will use as their initial hand of cards. The remaining tool cards will be placed in a tool card draw deck next to The Queue.<br/>Place the body bags within reach of both Plungers. Each Plunger should take 1 body bag for each customer they have during the game. Lastly place all the body parts and rats in the Bag O&rsquo; Parts.<br/><br/>Phase 1: Adding new body parts<br/>Roll 1d4 and add that value to the number of waiting customers in front of them. The Plunger will then blind draw that number of body parts from the Bag O&rsquo; Parts. Shift all existing body parts towards The Clog to make room for the incoming body parts. Rats will never move. Set aside any body parts that are shifted off of the Day 3 card into a reserve pile. Place the new body parts in the order they are drawn on the Sewer Pipe cards beginning from the rightmost space on the Day 1 card. If any rats are drawn they will be placed on the Rat spaces beginning from the far left of the Day 3 card. Any body part occupying a Rat space where a Rat will be placed, during this phase, will be removed and tossed back into the Bag O&rsquo; Parts.<br/><br/>Roll 1d4 and place that many reserved Day 3 parts on The Clog card spaces, tossing the rest back in the Bag O&rsquo; Parts.<br/><br/>Phase 2: Filling orders<br/>Each customer card lists the number of parts required to fill the order.<br/><br/>To fill an order a Plunger must choose all of any of 1 type of body parts on any one Sewer card (meeting the desired aging requirement) placing those parts in the customer&rsquo;s body bag. Any extra body parts not needed for the orders go back in the Bag O&rsquo; Parts. Plungers may use the body parts to attempt to fill 1, 2 or more customer orders as long as the body parts are of the desired type and aging. If a customer&rsquo;s complete order is filled the Plunger scores the money value, indicated in the lower right corner of the customer card, on the Gore Track. All body parts from this order are then tossed back in the Bag O&rsquo; Parts. A new customer is then drawn from The Queue.<br/><br/>Tool Cards: Each Plunger may use one of their tool cards at any point during their turn. Once played, the card will be placed on a discard pile next to the tool card draw pile and a new card is drawn.<br/><br/>Game End: The game ends in one of two ways:<br/>a. The Clog card has become full of body parts. In this case, the current Plunger finishes their turn and any final scoring is marked.<br/>b. All 10 customers have had their orders filled.<br/><br/>The Plunger who has earned the most money is declared the winner and receives a promotion to 2nd Class Sewer Engineer.<br/><br/>This game can be played solo as well.

Here, in the fifth volume of our line, we present options and alternatives for a dozen white dragons, covering every age category of the pale hunters of artic mountains, frozen deserts, and chilled tundra. Each age category also has three pregenerated treasure hoards, some alternative monster builds, and suggestions on how to build even deadlier dragon encounters.<br/><br/>Dragons are among the most iconic, and most popular, of all fantasy roleplaying game foes. Once the domain exclusively of higher-level adventures, dragons now have rules for every stage of life. This means that wet-behind-the-ears PCs can face dragons early in their careers (though likely they will be facing dragons the size of housecats). To ensure that a dragon is always just the right threat for PCs of any level, dragons are given twelve stages of life that, when combined with the many different types of dragons, creates a range of CRs from 2 to 22.<br/><br/>The problem with that, of course, is that it requires a lot of stat blocks, and those take up room. To save space, instead of presenting a full write-up of every dragon at every age category, the game&rsquo;s creators present a set of rules outlining how to write up dragons, and then give a few examples of each type. As a result, although you can find a dragon of the right CR for an encounter, it takes a considerable amount of work to get that dragon ready for the game.<br/><br/>To help with that problem, the fine folks at D20PFSRD.com took on the job of creating full stat blocks for every true dragon of every type, and when we expressed an interest in using those as the starting point for our Codex Draconis line, they were kind enough to give us their blessing. In addition to their dragon write-ups, Codex Draconis: White Terrors of the North presents additional material to expand the ways you can use these dragons and allows you to drop them into your campaign.<br/><br/>"}, "112187": {"rpgartist": ["Joseph J.

On your turn, you must either make your sugar glider jump or go into a brief state of torpor:<br/><br/>JUMP<br/><br/>Move your sugar glider in a straight line a number of spaces equal to your &lsquo;jumping tile&rsquo; (this means one space in the first turn). If you have no &lsquo;jumping tile&rsquo; underneath your sugar glider, you must use one from your reserve. Notice that purple fruits count as 5 movement points.<br/><br/>Then you take the &lsquo;jumping tile&rsquo; that you just used, and put it beside yourself face-up. This is your &lsquo;reserve&rsquo;. If you had no &lsquo;jumping tile&rsquo; underneath your sugar glider and had to use a tile from your reserve, discard this tile to the game case; it cannot be used again for the rest of the game.<br/><br/>The tile on which your sugar glider has landed (if any) is your new &lsquo;jumping tile&rsquo;.<br/><br/>Exceptions:<br/><br/>- The sugar gliders cannot jump outside the tree.<br/>- A sugar glider sitting in the center space can jump to any space on the board by spending any tile from his reserve (no need to match the length of the jump).<br/>- A sugar glider cannot move through another sugar glider.<br/><br/>Example: Anna wishes to make her sugar glider jump, but there is no &lsquo;jumping tile&rsquo; underneath her sugar glider. She uses a &lsquo;2&rsquo; from her reserve, moves the sugar glider 2 spaces in a straight line, and discards the tile she&rsquo;s used to the case.<br/><br/>TORPOR<br/><br/>You don&rsquo;t move your sugar glider. Take the &lsquo;jumping tile&rsquo; from underneath your sugar glider (if there is one), and add it to your reserve.<br/><br/>GAME END<br/><br/>The game ends when all the sugar gliders are consecutively in a state of torpor, or when the tree runs out of tiles, whichever happens first.<br/><br/>Each player sums the values of the tiles in his reserve (purple tiles count as 5 points). Highest score wins. In case of a tie, play again.<br/><br/>VARIANT FOR 2 PLAYERS<br/><br/>For shorter 2-player games, discard all the purple fruit tiles and 3 tiles of each other value. Then play on the inner board.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": ["Brazilian first edition", "English first edition", "Multilingual edition 2015", "Polish first edition"], "average": "6.86007", "name": "Sugar Gliders", "playingtime": "30", "boardgamemechanic": ["Grid Movement"], "age": "8", "usersrated": "139", "boardgamesubdomain": ["Abstract Games", "Family Games"], "boardgamefamily": ["Combinatorial"]}, "112193": {"poll": [], "name": "Spawn", "videogamemode": ["Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["NA SNES edition"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1308861.png", "videogametheme": ["Comics"], "usersrated": "1", "videogamedeveloper": ["Ukiyotei Company, Ltd"], "videogamegenre": ["Action"], "videogameplatform": ["SNES"], "average": "5", "statistics": [], "videogamepublisher": ["Acclaim Entertainment Inc."], "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1308861_t.png", "description": "This video game is based on the comic series of the same name. <br/>The game is a typical side-scrolling combat game.

In the stations and tunnels deep below the surface a new civilization emerges.<br/><br/>Gameplay<br/><br/>Each player is a leader of one of the many factions of post-nuclear underground. In order to win, a faction has to achieve ten victory points (VPs). Each station under the faction's control gives it 1 VP; different quests also bring VPs when completed. The other way to win is to capture all four stations of Polis &mdash; the cultural and political heart of Metro. Each faction has a hero at its disposal. Heroes can travel the underground, gain quests and equipment that increases their abilities, fight opponents' heroes, attack stations, and so on. The army of a faction can also attack stations, and usually with better chances to win, but it can target only adjacent stations. Stations under factions' control produce resources &mdash; pigs, ammo and mushrooms &mdash; that are used to capture new stations, strenghten the army, buy equipment and obtain quests. The production of resources and other game events are determined by a special sequence. This sequence tells what will happen each round: production of certain recources, a vote for a new law, or a sudden attack from the dark that must be repelled.<br/><br/>Players can attack stations with their armies or their heroes. Both have strength that may be increased by hiring new troops or buying useful equipment. When attacking a neutral station, the army/hero fights a random threat from the special deck and has to beat its strength. When attacking an opponent, the attacker confronts his army or hero. In battles between players a special set of combat cards is used; these cards give various bonuses to strength depending on the card chosen by the opponent, so the goal is to deduce which combat card will be used by the other side.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": ["English second edition", "English second edition (sample printing)", "Polish edition", "Russian second edition"], "average": "5.88661", "name": "Metro 2033", "playingtime": "60", "boardgamemechanic": ["Area Control / Area Influence", "Time Track", "Voting"], "age": "12", "usersrated": "168", "boardgamesubdomain": ["Strategy Games", "Thematic Games"], "boardgamefamily": ["Cities: Moscow"]}, "112211": {"poll": [], "name": "Stone Protectors", "videogamemode": ["Cooperative", "Local Multiplayer", "Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["North American SNES edition"], "average": "7", "videogametheme": ["Cartoon"], "usersrated": "1", "videogamedeveloper": ["Eurocom"], "videogamegenre": ["Beat 'em Up"], "videogameplatform": ["SNES"], "statistics": [], "videogamepublisher": ["Kemco"], "description": "A Super Nintendo game was released in November 1994 by Kemco.

Wizard's Tournament is a fantasy deck building game of magic combat where two players attempt to defeat each other using spells, monsters, and relics.  The game comes with thirty-five different sets of cards but only twelve of these card sets are picked at random to be used during a game.  These cards are added to a player's deck during a game so every time you play, it will feel like a new and exciting game.<br/><br/>Spell Cards<br/>Spell cards allow a player to perform special actions including dealing damage, drawing cards, healing, and causing an opponent to discard cards.  When cast, the ability of a Spell card occurs once and then it is discarded.  Fast spells can be played at any time but regular spells can only be cast on the owner's turn.  Spell cards can also be discarded to add Spirit to your Spirit Pool.<br/><br/>Monster Cards<br/>Monsters are permanent creatures used to attack your opponent and defend you from enemy monsters.  Every monster has a special ability that makes them more dangerous and difficult to defeat.<br/><br/>Relic Cards<br/>These permanent artifacts give a player special abilities that allow them to perform an action every turn until they are destroyed or stolen.<br/><br/>Game Play<br/>Each player starts with thirty Life.  If a player reduced his opponent's Life to zero, he wins the game.  A player can also win by having thirty or more Spirit in his Spirit Pool or by having one hundred or more Life.<br/><br/>Each player starts the game with ten Spirit cards.  Twelve cards are drawn from the Selection deck and these twelve card sets are placed on the table.  The starting player is determined randomly.   Before play begins, the player that is going first draws one card and the player going second draws three cards.<br/><br/>There are three possible icons on the each card: Green, Blue, and Red.<br/><br/>Green Icons: This is the Cast cost to activate a Spell, Monster, or Relic card.  This is also the purchase price in Spirit to add this card to a player's discard pile.<br/><br/>Blue Icons: This is the amount of Spirit added to a player's Spirit Pool when a card with a blue icon is discarded without activating it.<br/><br/>Red Icons: Monster cards have red icons equal to its Power.  A monster's Power is equal to a monster's Life and the amount of damage it can deal to a player or another monster.<br/><br/>Turn Sequence - 5 Phases<br/><br/>Draw Phase<br/><br/>A player draws five cards from her deck.  A player may never have more than ten cards in her hand at any time.  If a player cannot draw a card because her deck has run out of cards, the player must shuffle her discard pile into a new deck.<br/><br/>Purchase Phase<br/><br/>During any phase, Spirit cards or Spell cards can be discarded to add Spirit to a player's Spirit Pool equal to the number in the blue icon on the card.  This Spirit can be spent to purchase any of the twelve cards in the center of the table.  To add a card to your discard pile, you must pay the value in the card's green icon in Spirit.  Only one copy of each card can be purchased each turn.<br/><br/>Magic Phase<br/><br/>Players can spend Spirit to cast Spell, Monster, and Relic cards.  When Spell cards are cast, their ability is performed once and then they are discarded.  When Monster and Relic cards are cast, they are placed in play with an Activation token. Relics and monsters can use their abilities during the Magic and Combat phases.  An Activation token is placed on a relic when it is activated.  Relics and monsters with an Activation token cannot be activated.<br/><br/>Combat Phase<br/><br/>A Monster card can be used to attack another player or defend you from an attacking monster.  Monsters with an Activation token on them cannot attack, defend, or use their ability.  To attack, select all the monsters under your control that you want to attack.  Your opponent then decides which of his monsters will defend against each of the attacking monsters.  More than one monster can be used to block a single attacking monster.  After the attack, place an Activation token on each of the attacking monsters.<br/><br/>If a monster attacks and is not blocked, the defending player&rsquo;s Life is reduced by the Power of that monster.  If a monster is blocked by a defending monster, both monsters deal damage equal to their Power to his opponent.  If a monster's damage is ever equal to or greater than its Power, it is destroyed and placed in its owner&rsquo;s discard pile.  If a defending monster cannot absorb all this damage, the excess damage is applied to the defending player.  Excess damage applied to an attacking monster is ignored.<br/><br/>If more than one monster is used to block a single attacking monster, the attacking player may apply damage equal to the Power of the attacking monster divided amongst any the defending monsters in any way.  Any of these defending monsters that receive enough damage to be destroyed are placed in his owner&rsquo;s discard pile.  If a group of blocking monsters cannot absorb all the damage, the player that controls them has his Life reduced by the excess damage.  All the Power of the blocking monsters are combined and applied to the attacking monster.  If the damage dealt is equal to or greater than the Power of the attacking monster&rsquo;s Power, the attacking monster is destroyed and placed in its owner&rsquo;s discard pile and the excess damage is ignored.<br/><br/>End Phase<br/><br/>All Activation tokens are removed from play, all monster damage is discarded, and all Spirit Pools are emptied.<br/><br/>3 or 4 Player Optional Rules<br/><br/>The game can also be played with optional rules for three or four players when you use the extra Spirit cards included in the game.<br/><br/>Players: 2<br/><br/>Time: 30 Minutes<br/><br/>Ages: 12+<br/><br/>Contents: 292 Cards, Tokens, and a Rule Book<br/><br/>"}, "112276": {"poll": [], "name": "Der st\u00f6rrische Esel", "playingtime": "30", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": ["Hand Management"], "yearpublished": "2003", "usersrated": "0", "boardgamefamily": ["Animals: Donkeys"], "maxplayers": "4", "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1194341_t.png", "average": "0", "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["Piatnik"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1194341.png", "boardgameversion": ["Piatnik Edition 2003"], "maxplaytime": "30", "boardgamecategory": ["Animals", "Card Game"], "age": "5", "minplaytime": "30", "description": "The donkey carries fruits in a basket towards the market, but a bridge is causing problems.

The testudo is a 4-piece square formation and phalanx is a 4-piece linear formation, in which pieces move as one.<br/><br/>The method of capture depends of the capturing formation (or lack of) and of the captured piece/pieces, and can be by approach, by flanking or by moving and replacing.<br/><br/>There's 3 victory conditions: <br/><br/>     capture all opponent latros (pieces)<br/>     capture the opponent centurion or,<br/>     when a player in the beginning of his turn can't move his centurion, he loses. <br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>"}, "112284": {"poll": [], "name": "Danger!

The original launch was accompanied by a small range of miniatures developed by Brigade Models. However the original designers, Patrick Doyle, Mike Tastsides and Doug Glover were serving members of the US armed forces and as such had more pressing demands on their time than playing games, so development of the rules understandably stalled.<br/>[...] We've avoided unnecessary changes to the core rules, being content to tinker around the edges with minor changes to the design system and the inclusion of a hex-less movement system. Our main goal has been to streamline the rules a little without drastically altering the flavour. Probably the one major change has been to do away with the 12-point movement system that allowed movement along hex edges - we abandoned this in our own games very early on. We've also removed the distinction between the Basic and Advanced versions of the game in favour of a single unified set of rules.&quot;<br/><br/>The game uses miniatures of starfighters, it is played on a hex map but a set of rules to use hexless maps is also included. The main dice roll used is the 2d6 roll, this is modified by another kinf of dice (ranging from a d4 to a d12) based on the pilot skill. These dice rolls are used to resolve fights and control rolls when your fighter is going spinning around due to damages or wrong manouvers. The damage system is very interesting, being it not the &quot;classic&quot; set of boxes that have to be crossed out but a system that takes in account a series of debilitating damages that during the game, imposing each a number of malus and penalties, can render your fighter inoperative or totally destroyed. Statistics for the official fighter models are in the end of the book.<br/><br/>These are introductory free rules, Brigade Models is going to publish in a near future more complete rules (this time you are going to buy them) that will also include campaign games rules, pilots' skill progression and others more convoluted situations not presented here.<br/><br/>"}, "112363": {"poll": [], "name": "Dr. Kinkin Bacteriapanic", "playingtime": "0", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": ["Card Drafting", "Set Collection"], "yearpublished": "1988", "usersrated": "0", "maxplayers": "8", "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1143677_t.jpg", "average": "0", "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["Yonezawa corp."], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1143677.jpg", "boardgameversion": ["Japanese first edition"], "maxplaytime": "0", "boardgamecategory": ["Card Game", "Educational", "Medical", "Party Game"], "age": "0", "minplaytime": "0", "description": "Japanese card game that has numbered sickness cards and numbered medicine cards.

First of all, the box top or cover actually becomes the game board (we don&rsquo;t think anyone has ever done this before), hence the name Outside the Box. Secondly, it is a team game (there are very few team games out there) where everyone is actively involved throughout the game. This makes it a great party game, but also gives every single player a chance to be a hero by helping his or her team win. Most importantly, Outside the Box is all skill. There are no dice. Teams can only advance by getting the answers right. It&rsquo;s very fast. It&rsquo;s very fun and it&rsquo;s very, very addictive.<br/><br/>GAME PLAY<br/><br/>Outside the Box&trade; consists of four types of rounds: Volley Box, Team Play, To Each His Own, and Speed Round. In most rounds, answers are given, in order, A through Z. Teams begin on the Start square with a Volley Box round. The team that wins the Volley Box moves onto the board to the first Team Play space, receives 3 PassCards, and will play the first Team Play round. As your teams progress through the game, you advance through 3 phases, and the 377 categories become more challenging. To win the game, you leave Phase 3, flip over the Start square (which reveals the Winner's Box), and attempt your Final Challenge.<br/><br/>FOUR ROUNDS OF PLAY<br/><br/>With four different rounds and hundreds of categories, it's like playing four games in one...so it's never the same, as it changes each time you play. Here are some examples:<br/><br/>Team Play - You have been chosen as the Captain of your team for this round. The category is: &quot;Musical Groups and Rock Bands.&quot; The timer is set for 2 minutes, and the pressure is on! You must go, in order, A through Z, and name a group or band that begins with each letter of the alphabet. Your team may help you, but only by giving you &quot;outside the box&quot; clues. Did you just say, &quot;That's easy?&quot; Ready, set, go!<br/><br/>Volley Box - In this round, teams battle back and forth through the alphabet in a verbal hot potato! The category is: &quot;Things you give, share, or offer to others.&quot; The timer is placed away from view and is set for 1 minute. Again, going in order, A through Z, the first team could shout, &quot;Alimony!&quot; The other team might respond with, &quot;Benefit of the doubt!&quot; The first team says, &quot;Condolences!&quot; (or &quot;Cup of sugar!&quot; or &quot;Custody!&quot; or &quot;CPR!&quot; or &quot;Coat!&quot;) The team that is stuck when the timer beeps loses the round. Just how far &quot;outside the box&quot; will you go to help your team win?<br/><br/>To Each His Own - The category is picked and 4 letters are randomly chosen from the alphabet. Both teams are given 2 minutes to secretly write down a response for each letter. Try not to match each other. If you're really good, you may just get the chance to &quot;stump the Master!&quot;<br/><br/>Speed Round - You are the &quot;Actor.&quot; You have picked a Speed Round card and the timer is set. You must go in order through the alphabet and get your team to say exactly what is on that card. Go ahead, jump around, sing, use props -- but you better not say any part of the words on the card, or &quot;it sounds like&quot; or &quot;rhymes with..&quot; The timer is going... what are you waiting for?<br/><br/>CONTENTS<br/><br/>Included are 377 category cards with thousands of possible answers (which makes the game different each time you play). The Master List is a three year compilation of well over 15,000 possible responses in which you could get the chance to stump the &ldquo;Master&rdquo; by coming up with your own &ldquo;outside the box&rdquo; answers. Also included is an audio CD featuring the inventor of the game, Rick Sugarman, explaining the rules. There are also live unscripted role playing examples, as well as helpful hints. In addition, the game comes complete with easy-to-follow, learn-as-you-play instructions and quick reference cards, an electronic digital programmable timer (battery included), team game pawns, scoring chips, letter cards, and PassCards.<br/><br/>"}, "112365": {"poll": [], "name": "Stone Age", "videogamemode": ["Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["English/European Amiga edition", "English/European DOS edition"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1143656.png", "videogametheme": ["Prehistoric"], "usersrated": "2", "videogamedeveloper": ["Bones Park Software Artistic"], "videogamegenre": ["Puzzle"], "videogameplatform": ["Amiga", "DOS"], "average": "5.5", "statistics": [], "videogamepublisher": ["Eclipse Design"], "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1143656_t.png", "description": "User Summary<br/><br/>Stone Age is a puzzle game set in the prehistoric era.

Life as we know it struggles to endure on the Abaddon. Once the home of a mysterious, non-human civilization, the planet is now a desolate wasteland bearing one immensely precious resource: Feronium power crystals. The unimaginable energy contained within the crystals is coveted by two groups of humans: the Satellite City-States and the Commonwealth Alliance. Using Links &ndash; giant bio-mech suits made from modified military vehicles and alien technology &ndash; the warring factions fight a weary battle for territorial control of the Abaddon.<br/><br/>At your disposal in Abaddon is a 28&quot; x 19&quot; battlefield game board with 32 highly-detailed mech figurines, 18 free-standing landscape terrain features, over 100 game-changing Wild Fire and Weapon System cards, dozens of tokens, battle dice and a Battle Manual containing over 15 mission scenarios. Choose your allegiance and lead your army in non-stop excitement as you forge through unforgiving terrain, fight to overcome random and bizarre technological glitches, and battle your enemies in never-ending war.<br/><br/>Abaddon is a furious, two-to-four-player game of futuristic combat. Each scenario is laid out on the customizable battlefield game board with each side using a varying number of units. The game is played in turns during which a player rolls his Activation Dice, allowing him to &quot;activate&quot; certain units and move them. These mechanical units &ndash; Links &ndash; are powered by Feronium power crystals, and as they take damage these crystals are depleted. A unit that runs out of crystals is unable to continue functioning and is considered destroyed.<br/><br/>Combat is card- and dice-based. The attacker lays out his Weapon System cards, targeting defending enemy units. Once the attacker has laid out all of his planned attacks, the defender may defend with his own Weapon System cards. These cards can modify the dice rolls that are used to determine the results of the combat. Additionally, due to the experimental nature of the Links and the mysterious happenings in the Abaddon region, things can, and often will, go wrong. These malfunctions and odd happenings are represented by Wild Fire cards, the drawing of which can result in anything from possible shutdowns to anti-gravity surges.<br/><br/>Victory is determined based on stipulations presented by the chosen mission scenarios. Typically, victory is achieved by damaging and destroying your opponent's units by way of their power crystals. Each destroyed enemy crystal is worth one victory point, which players must collect in order to win.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": ["English first edition"], "average": "6.77285", "name": "Abaddon", "playingtime": "45", "boardgamemechanic": ["Dice Rolling", "Hand Management"], "age": "14", "boardgameexpansion": ["Abaddon: Shattered Command"], "usersrated": "158", "boardgamesubdomain": ["Thematic Games", "Wargames"], "boardgamefamily": ["Commands & Colors", "Robots"], "boardgamepodcastepisode": ["I've Been Diced! episode 64: Richard Borg", "Wooden Cubes &amp; Iron Soldiers: \u201cJust the Two of Us\u201d Episode 8"]}, "112382": {"rpgdesigner": ["Kevin Barthaud"], "rpgitemversion": ["Ashcan Version"], "statistics": [], "name": "Witch: The Road to Lindisfarne (Ashcan Edition)", "rpgartist": ["Jonny Gray"], "rpgproducer": ["Richard Lacy"], "rpg": ["Witch: The Road to Lindisfarne"], "usersrated": "2", "rpggenre": ["History (Medieval)"], "rpgpublisher": ["(Self-Published)"], "rpgcategory": ["Core Rules (min needed to play)"], "poll": [], "average": "6", "description": "Back cover blurb:<br/><br/>It is the year of our Lord 1350 and an unholy plague sweeps across our beloved Britain.

This game is developed by Just Games Interactive, and published by Midway Games. The race starts in New York's Times Square, and ends in Los Angeles's Muholland Drive. The objective of this game is to outrun seven different cars by cruising through twelve different courses, doing different kind of stunts, and using the new nitrous system. This game introduces the money system which you gain money to unlock new cars. When you start the game only four tracks and four cars where unlocked. Along the way you unlock different stages and cars by gaining money or racing in the Circuit Challenge. This game allows up to two players on the track.<br/><br/>Back in 2001, another Cruis'n game was planned to be in for works for the Nintendo Gamecube as a console conversion of Cruis'n Velocity, but the idea was scrapped. But in 2006, Midway was planning to bring The Fast and the Furious to home consoles, but lost the license during the game's production cycle. Midway then changed the name of the game to Cruis'n and hired game developers Just Games Interactive to develop the game for the Nintendo Gamecube, but then the project was moved to the Wii shortly after the development has started. The game was announced in the summer of 2007 and was planned for release on the Wii exclusive.<br/><br/>During the summer of 2007, Midway released three screenshots demonstrating somewhat dated graphics. Later, Midway released additional screenshots and announced a two-player mode as well as a car customization feature for the game like its original arcade counterpart The Fast and the Furious. A few months later, Midway released the game, despite experiencing some manufacturing difficulties.<br/><br/>Cruis'n fared poorly in reviews by both gamers and critics. Many thought it was a slapped-together version of The Fast and the Furious arcade game with few new features. The main areas of criticism were its outdated gameplay, poor sound, lack of extra features (the title is a straight port), and lack of depth; the game can be beaten in less than an hour. Its loading times were considered problematic as it takes up to a minute to load and start a race. The game's graphics were also heavily criticized for resembling a game from the Nintendo 64 era. The game was often praised for its responsive controls, but the overall experience of the game was hampered by its other flaws. Some reviews expressed the belief that Cruis'n was a quick cash-out for Midway.<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;Cruis'n&quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "112414": {"poll": [], "name": "Daisy Fuentes Pilates", "videogamemode": ["Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["European Wii edition", "North American Wii edition"], "average": "0", "videogametheme": ["Other"], "usersrated": "0", "videogamedeveloper": ["Collision Studios"], "videogamegenre": ["Fitness"], "videogameplatform": ["Wii"], "statistics": [], "videogamepublisher": ["505 Games Ltd.", "SEGA Corporation"], "description": "Set at a lush tropical resort and hosted by Daisy Fuentes, Daisy Fuentes Pilates features customizable workouts, fitness tracking real-time coaching and interactive feedback.<br/><br/>Daisy Fuentes Pilates, the first self-titled Pilates endeavor, goes beyond the one-way, static workouts of traditional DVDs using the Wii&rsquo;s controls to monitor movements and offer instant feedback, ensuring proper body motion so players get the most from every Pilates session.

The abandoned colony shows no signs of struggle yet something is clearly not right: Herds of animals lie mutilated in the surrounding fields. The savage beasts of the island have run amok inside the compound. And the silent, gaping mines&mdash;each named for a different layer of Hell&mdash;lead to new threats beyond anyone's imagining.
