Tom Clancy also wrote a book by the same name, based on this storyline.<br/><br/>SSN is also the title of a board wargame published by Game Designer's Workshop in 1975, and was the first attempt at a serious modern submarine and anti-submarine warfare simulation game published for the entertainment market. It was designed by Stephen Newberg and developed by Marc Miller.<br/><br/>Gameplay<br/><br/>The computer game version uses video briefings and fictional news reports to enhance the atmosphere both before and after the missions. The view during gameplay is from the perspective of an external trailing rotatable camera. In game player weapons are limited to submarine launched torpedoes, with a VLS system for launching Tomahawk missiles at off-map targets (as a mission objective). The player is provided with a simplified scanning screen display for Sonar. Thermoclines at various depths are simulated as well, affecting sonar readings and accuracy. Commands are limited to directional steering, ballast tank and periscope controls, basic sonar functions and weapons targeting and firing, providing an arcade like feel to the game play, as opposed to a true submarine command simulation.<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;Tom Clancy's SSN&quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "111504": {"poll": [], "name": "Frost Bite", "videogamemode": ["Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["Web Browser edition"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1140526.jpg", "videogametheme": ["Cute Fantasy"], "usersrated": "0", "videogamedeveloper": ["Nitrome"], "videogamegenre": ["Action", "Platform"], "videogameplatform": ["Web Browser"], "average": "0", "statistics": [], "videogamepublisher": ["(Web published)"], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1140526_t.jpg", "description": "User Summary<br/><br/>Climb the mountain to raise your flag.

A few of her citizens, who wanted to fight for one reason or another, went off to form fighting groups, risking their United States citizenship. Some went on, later in the war, to become such groups as the Fighting Tigers and the Eagle Squadrons of Britain&rsquo;s Royal Air Force.<br/><br/>By August of 1939, the Axis started gaining chunks of the world in its conquests.

The player takes the role of the captain of the submarine seaQuest DSV 4600, and is tasked with carrying out a series of missions in a series of levels, divided up as &quot;ocean quadrants&quot;. There is a Game Boy game as well, although completely different compared to the 16-bit console versions.<br/><br/>The game is divided into two parts; one in which you control the seaQuest in an isometric perspective overworld and are able to buy equipment and weapons and travel the ocean quadrant, and the actual horizontal scrolling shooter style missions, in which you are to achieve various objectives using a complement of mini-subs, robots, and even a trained dolphin wearing an aqua-lung. Some of the missions are simplistic and require you to make use of only one of the seaQuest's vessels, others have you make use of several of them in succession. For example, there's a mission in the first ocean quadrants where you have to rescue the crew of an exploration vessel trapped in a caved-in underwater cave, and have to use armed subs to clear several cave-ins before you can bring in the only mini-sub you have that's equipped to rescue personnel from other subs. The missions also typically involve combat between your mini-subs and the units of pirates, eco-terrorists, and other foes, but also more often than not require you to perform some sort of non-combat task such as the aforementioned rescue operation.<br/><br/>The other part of the game is the overworld where the player controls the seaQuest herself. These areas give you access to several menus in which you can replace lost equipment, buy new weapons for the seaQuest, and read up on the various missions you will receive while in your quadrant. While traveling your quadrant, you will also come across minefields, automated torpedo launchers and hostile submarines, many of which you need to destroy in order to achieve missions you are assigned in their area. For example, there's a mission in which you are to seal the leaks in an oil tanker sunk by ecological terrorists. In addition to accomplish this objective with your mini-subs, you need to not only complete the mission itself, but also to use the seaQuest herself to sink every terrorist submarine near the oil tanker wreck.<br/><br/>The game features a currency system, and awards you money for destroying enemy targets and completing objectives. The player can also lose money for destroying underwater settlements and killing animals present in some missions. Money is spent on weapons, countermeasures and mines for your seaQuest submarine, as well as replacements for lost vessels in missions. You don't need to spend money on repairs, though, as the seaQuest and her complement subs repair themselves over time.<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;SeaQuest DSV (video game)&quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "111585": {"poll": [], "name": "Shien's Revenge", "videogamemode": ["Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["North American SNES edition"], "average": "0", "videogametheme": ["Anime"], "usersrated": "0", "videogamedeveloper": ["Givro/Almanic"], "videogamegenre": ["Shooter"], "videogameplatform": ["SNES"], "statistics": [], "videogamepublisher": ["Vic Tokai"], "description": "Shien's Revenge is an action game released for the Super Famicom (SNES) in 1994.

Shien must now travel through the Time Gate to defeat this unknown evil and rescue his girlfriend.<br/><br/>Shien's Revenge is played from a first-person viewpoint as the player aims a cursor at enemies to either throw shurikens or slash with a kunai dagger. There are six long levels, each with scaling bosses that nearly fill the screen. A set of candles indicates the Shien's life meter. Power-ups such as rapid fire and magic scrolls can be picked up by defeating enemies; the use of scrolls produces a powerful attack that damages everything on the screen.

Jerry has been transformed into a blob by a mysterious wizard at the behest of his jealous brother, Tom, who has a crush on the young princess Emi. In that incarnation, the player plays as a little jelly bean with eyes, traveling across a photorealistic grassy landscape. The game has graphics and terrain that are characterized as cartoony and cute, which attracts younger players.<br/><br/>The player is able to defend Jerry or attack enemies by controlling certain physical characteristics of Jerry, such as flattening or stretching his body in order to hit enemies, or by finding objects, such as balls, to throw the enemies. The player can also run by pressing the Y button on the controller. Jerry has the ability to stick to walls and ceilings by holding down the Y button as you jump towards them, adding an advantage over Jerry's enemies. The player advances through each level along a filmstrip map, and can revisit previously-completed levels by &quot;rewinding&quot; the filmstrip. Each level is a romp up and down hills, jumping between platforms, and squeezing through pipes. Scattered around each level are a number of plants that open up to reveal balls, power-ups, 1ups, seeds, and jumping enhancers.

There are twelve different drivers to choose from and the frame rate offers fast action on the field.<br/><br/>Features included mode 7 scrolling and MIDI-quality sound. The player moves the ball up the field by shooting it. Nintendo Power once accidentally claimed that this game was a one-player only game. However, they did correct their mistake in a future issue. Obstacles are thrown in the players way to block progress. This is to replace the lack of defenders used in an American football game played in the real world. These obstacles include magnetic flux fields that drains the player's energy and spincycles that twist the player out of control. Every background has a science fiction look to it with the stars and the space colony being shown. The goal scoring areas are similar to soccer nets but without the goalkeeper blocking it. It is assumed that each player is a quarterback, wide receiver, and defensive lineman all rolled into one person.<br/><br/>There is a timer announcing the number of time units left in the game. The actual gameplay resembles Faceball 2000 and Ballblazer more than the modern-day football played by the NFL. There are also elements of polo to the overall presentation as the player is not allowed to hold the ball after four seconds.<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;Space Football: One on One&quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "111592": {"poll": [], "name": "Dungeon Maker: Hunting Ground", "videogamemode": ["Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["Japanese PSP edition", "North American PSP edition"], "average": "0", "videogametheme": ["Fantasy", "Occult"], "usersrated": "0", "videogamedeveloper": ["Global A Entertainment"], "videogamegenre": ["RPG"], "videogameplatform": ["PSP"], "statistics": [], "videogamepublisher": ["Taito", "Xseed Games"], "description": "User Summary<br/><br/>The player creates a dungeon to lure monsters inside.

The players must guide four Squires on their journey around the board on their quest to become Knights and garner influence for their household.  During their journey, they will also be attempting to keep the rival households in check.  Can you be the most influential Lord and gain the ear of the King?  Only time will tell.<br/><br/>Inspired by classic games such as Parcheesi/Ludo and Checkers/Draughts, Accolade is an abstract game of chance and strategy, which has players maneuver their Squires around the exterior path of the board in an attempt to reach their home cathedral (similar to Parcheesi).  Once the Squire makes it to the cathedral, he receives his Accolade and is knighted.  This new Knight now reenters the board, now with the sole goal of interfering with your opponent's Squires and Knights.<br/><br/>The board is made up of a central hub and 4 spokes, which are assembled differently depending on the number of players (2-4), allowing for a scalable game that decreases the amount of dead time experienced in a 2 player game of Parcheesi/Ludo.  Though the board could also be used as an alternate Parcheesi board using those standard rules (and there is a bonus draughts board on the back of the main hub as well).<br/><br/>The main mechanic of the game is simple dice rolling for movement in a similar style to Parcheesi, but the pieces have more options on what they can do with those rolls.  Opposing pawns (Squires/Knights) interact with each other by Checking (landing on them, as in Parcheesi) or Capturing (jumping over, as in Checkers) them.  Pawns can attain a degree of safety by being in Castle spaces, or forming a Castle by doubling up 2 pawns of the same color.<br/><br/>Points (influence) are scored for removing opposing Squire / Knights and for any of your own Knights on the board (not in your home area).<br/><br/>The game ends once all remaining pawns are Knights, then the player with the most points (influence) gains the ear of the King and is considered the winner.<br/><br/>The game was created as an entry for TGC Classic Game Mashup Contest.<br/><br/>"}, "111632": {"average": "8", "videogamebg": ["German Eagle vs. Russian Bear"], "name": "German Eagle vs. Russian Bear", "videogamemode": ["Local Multiplayer", "Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["Android edition"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1287666.png", "videogametheme": ["War - World War II"], "usersrated": "1", "videogamedeveloper": ["DK Simulations"], "videogamegenre": ["Strategy"], "videogameplatform": ["Android"], "poll": [], "statistics": [], "videogamepublisher": ["DK Simulations"], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1287666_t.png", "description": "From the application's &quot;About&quot; file<br/><br/>This is a classic hex and counter wargame converted for Android.<br/><br/>There is a map of Easter Europe divided into hexes.<br/><br/>Each hex can be controlled by one of two players: One player represents the Axis forces, while the other represents the Soviet.

The Dragons are very similar to the TRS-80 Color Computer (CoCo), and were produced for the European market by Dragon Data, Ltd., in Port Talbot, Wales, and for the US market by Tano of New Orleans, Louisiana. The model numbers reflect the primary difference between the two machines, which have 32 and 64 kilobytes of RAM, respectively.  Aside from the amount of RAM, the 64 also has an RS-232 serial port which was not included on the 32.<br/><br/>A minor difference between the two Dragon models is the outer case colour; the Dragon 32 is beige and the 64 is light grey. Besides the colour and the Dragon 64's serial port (and the model name stickers, of course), the two machines look exactly the same. The Dragon 32 is upgradable to Dragon 64.<br/><br/>The Dragon is built around the Motorola MC6809E processor running at 0.89 MHz. This was an advanced 8-bit CPU design, having, among other things, limited 16-bit capabilities. In terms of raw computational power, the Dragon beat most of its contemporary rivals based on the older MOS Technology 6502, but this made little difference in a market where graphical capabilities and games were much more important to consumers.<br/><br/>It was possible to increase the speed of the computer by using POKE 65495,0 which accelerates the ROM-resident BASIC interpreter, but temporarily disables correct functioning of the cassette/printer ports. Manufacturing variances means that not all Dragons are able to function at this higher speed, and use of this POKE can cause some units to crash or run highly unstable, though with no permanent damage. POKE 65494,0 returns the speed to normal. POKE 65497,0 pushes the speed yet higher but the display is lost until a slower speed is restored.<br/><br/>The Dragon also used the SN74LS783/MC6883 Synchronous Address Multiplexer (SAM) and the MC6847 Video Display Generator (VDG). I/O was provided by two MC6821 Peripheral Interface Adapters (PIAs). Many Dragon 32s were upgraded by their owners to 64 KB of memory. A few were further expanded to 128 KB, 256 KB, or 512 KB, with home-built memory controllers/memory management units (MMUs).<br/><br/>A broad range of peripherals exist for the Dragon 32/64, and on top of this there are add-ons such as the Dragon's Claw which give the Dragons access to the BBC Micro's large range of accessories (a particularly important factor in the UK home market). Although neither machine has a built-in disk operating system (cassette tapes being the default data-storage mechanism in the home computer market at the time), DragonDOS was supplied as part of the disk controller interface from Dragon Data Ltd. The numerous external ports (by the standards of the time), including the standard RS-232 on the 64, also allows hobbyists to attach a diverse range of equipment.<br/><br/>An unusual feature was a monitor port for connection of a computer monitor, as an alternative to the TV output. This was rarely used due to the cost of dedicated monitors at that time. The port is actually a Composite Video port and can be used to connect the Dragon 32 to most modern TVs to deliver a much better picture.<br/><br/>The Dragon uses analogue joysticks, unlike most systems of the time which used less versatile but cheaper digital systems. Other uses for the joystick ports include light pens.<br/><br/>Tony Clarke and Richard Wadman laid out the specifications for the Dragon.  The units had a robust motherboard in a spacious case, reminiscent of the BBC Micro, and so were more tolerant of home-modification than some of their contemporaries, which often had their components crammed into the smallest possible space.<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;Dragon 32&quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "111683": {"poll": [], "name": "Scramble", "playingtime": "0", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": ["Roll / Spin and Move"], "yearpublished": "1955", "usersrated": "2", "maxplayers": "4", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1135027_t.jpg", "average": "3.5", "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["Chad Valley Co Ltd."], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1135027.jpg", "boardgameversion": ["First Edition"], "maxplaytime": "0", "boardgamecategory": ["Economic", "Transportation"], "age": "0", "minplaytime": "0", "description": "Contents<br/>1 Game Board.<br/>4 Cars.<br/>16 Shops(4 Green/12 Red).<br/>8 Traffic Lights.<br/>8 Pedestrians.<br/>4 One Way Street Arrows.<br/>16 Treasury Notes(Two Denominations).<br/>1 Pack of Traffic Control Cards. <br/>8 Conical Obstruction Pieces.<br/>1 Set of Rules.<br/><br/>Each player sets out from their home garage on a shopping expedition by car.

Started as a proprietary PC variant, intended for multimedia applications and PC games, it later became more compatible with regular PCs. In 1993, the FM Towns Marty was released, a gaming console compatible with the FM Towns games.<br/><br/>The name &quot;FM Towns&quot; is derived from the codename the system was assigned while in development, &quot;Townes&quot;; this was chosen as an homage to Charles Hard Townes, one of the winners of the 1964 Nobel Prize in Physics, following a custom of Fujitsu at the time to codename PC products after Nobel prize winners. The e in &quot;Townes&quot; was dropped when the system went into production to make it clear that it was to be pronounced &quot;Towns&quot; rather than &quot;Tau-Ness&quot;, and the &quot;FM&quot;, which stood for &quot;Fujitsu Micro[computer]&quot;.<br/><br/>Fujitsu, which had the best-selling 8-bit home computer FM-7, and the Fujitsu Micro 16s PC in early 1980s in Japan, decided to release a new home computer after the FM-7 was overcome by NEC's PC-8801 computer. From this experience, Fujitsu learned that software sales drove hardware sales. In order to acquire usable software quickly, the new computer was to be based on Fujitsu's &quot;FMR50&quot; system architecture. The FMR50 system, released at 1986, was another x86/DOS-based computer similar to NEC's popular PC-9801. The FMR50 computers were sold to moderate success in Japanese offices, particularly in Japanese government offices. There were hundreds of software packages available for the FMR, including Lotus 1-2-3, Wordstar, Multiplan, and dBASE III. With this basis of compatibility, the more multimedia-friendly FM Towns was born.<br/><br/>NEC's PC-9801 computers were widespread and dominated in the 1980s, at one point reaching 70% of the 16/32 bit computer market. However, they had poor graphics (640&times;400 at 16 of 4096 colors) and sounds (4-operator/3 voice monaural FM sounds). Just as Commodore saw an opening for the Amiga in some global markets against the IBM PC, a computer with improved graphics and sounds was considered to overcome the PC-9801 in the home-use field in Japan.<br/><br/>With many multimedia innovations for its time, the FM Towns was that system, though for a number of reasons it never broke far beyond the boundaries of its niche market status.<br/><br/>Eventually the &quot;Towns&quot; lost much of its uniqueness by adding a DOS/V (PC Clone + DOS with native Japanese language support) compatibility mode switch, until Fujitsu finally discontinued making FM Towns specific hardware and software and moved to focus on the IBM PC clones that many Japanese manufacturers who previously were not players in the PC market were building by the mid to late 1990s. To this day, Fujitsu is known for its laptop PCs globally, and FM Towns (and Marty) users have been relegated to a small community of aficionados.<br/><br/>Several variants were built; the first system was based on an Intel 80386SX processor running at a clock speed of 16 MHz, with the option of adding an 80387 FPU, featured one or two megabytes of RAM (with a possible maximum of 64 MB), one or two 3.5&quot; floppy disk drives and a single-speed CD-ROM drive. It was delivered with a gamepad, a mouse and a microphone.<br/><br/>The earlier, more distinctive models featuring a vertical CD-ROM tray on the front of the case (1F, 2F, 1H, 2H, 10F and 20F) were often referred to as the &quot;Gray&quot; Towns, and were the ones most directly associated with the &quot;FM Towns&quot; brand. Most featured 3 memory expansion slots and used 72-pin non-parity SIMMs with a required timing of 100ns or less and a recommended timing of 60ns.<br/><br/>Hard drives were not standard equipment, and were not required for most uses. The OS was loaded from CD-ROM by default. A SCSI Centronics 50/SCSI-1/Full-Pitch port was provided for connecting external SCSI disk drives, and was the most common way to connect a hard drive to an FM Towns PC. Although internal drives are rare, there is a hidden compartment with a SCSI 50-pin connector where a hard drive may be connected, however the power supply module does not typically provide the required Molex connector to power the drive.<br/><br/>The video output was RGB using the same DB15 connector and pinouts as earlier Apple Macintosh computers.<br/><br/>The operating system used was Windows 3.0/3.1/95 and a graphical OS called Towns OS, based on MS-DOS and the Phar Lap DOS extender (RUN386.EXE). Most games for the system were written in protected mode Assembly and C using the Phar Lap DOS extender. These games usually utilized the Towns OS API (TBIOS) for handling several graphic modes, sprites, sounds, a mouse, gamepads and CD-audio.<br/><br/>A minimal DOS system that allowed the CD-ROM drive to be accessed was contained in a system ROM; this, coupled with Fujitsu's decision to charge only a minimal license fee for the inclusion of a bare-bones Towns OS on game CD-ROMs, allowed game developers to make games bootable directly from CD-ROM without the need for a boot floppy or hard disk.<br/><br/>To boot the system from CD-ROM disk, the FM TOWNS had a &quot;hidden C:&quot; ROM drive in which a minimum MS-DOS system, CD-ROM driver and MSCDEX.EXE were installed. This minimal DOS system ran first, and the DOS system read and executed the TownsOS IPL stored in CD-ROM disk after that. The Towns OS CD-ROM disk had an IPL, MS-DOS system (IO.SYS), DOS extender, and Towns API (TBIOS).<br/><br/>Various Linux and BSD distributions have also been ported to the FM Towns system, including Debian and Gentoo. A version of GNU called GNU for FM Towns was released in 1990.<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;FM TOWNS&quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "111685": {"boardgamedesigner": ["Daniel Solis"], "poll": [], "name": "Pebble Rebel", "playingtime": "10", "boardgamecompilation": ["Level 99 Games Microgames Collection"], "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": ["Pattern Building"], "yearpublished": "2010", "usersrated": "6", "maxplayers": "2", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1383046_t.jpg", "average": "5.83333", "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["(Web published)", "Level 99 Games"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1383046.jpg", "boardgameversion": ["First edition", "Microgames Collection Edition"], "maxplaytime": "10", "boardgamecategory": ["Abstract Strategy", "Print & Play"], "age": "5", "minplaytime": "10", "description": "Pebble Rebel is a strategy game for two players.

It was the first 32-bit home video game system, and came complete with a built in CD-ROM drive and disk drive. It was based on the earlier FM Towns computer system Fujitsu had released in 1989. The Marty was backward-compatible with older FM Towns games.<br/><br/>In 1994 a new version of the console called the FM Towns Marty 2 was released. It featured a darker gray shell and a new lower price (66,000 yen) but was otherwise identical to the first Marty. It is widely believed that the FM Towns Marty 2 would feature similar improvements to the FM Towns 2, which had a swifter CPU than the first, but this is not the case. It has also been speculated that the Marty 2 featured a 486 CPU, however this was also discovered to be false.<br/><br/>As well as this, there is also the FM Towns Car Marty for installation in automobiles. This came in two versions, the MVP-1 (released in April 1994) and MVP-10 (released in November 1994). The only difference between the MVP-1 and MVP-10 is the drive mechanisms. There has been speculation that the MVP-10 was introduced since the MVP-1 broke easily.

Fujitsu also officially released a PCMCIA 2400 bit/s modem (FMM-CM301) for the FM Towns Marty. This modem was bundled with the special TCMarty that also came with a printer port. While it is widely believed that the IC Card slot can be used for RAM expansions, this is not correct.<br/><br/>Controllers:<br/><br/>- 4-way D-pad, A and B buttons, Select, and Run, as well as an extra button above the two &quot;face&quot; buttons<br/>- 2 standard controller ports<br/>- Keyboard port<br/><br/>The controller connector is a DB9, referred to as an &quot;Atari Type&quot; in Japan because it's fundamentally the same connector as an Atari 2600.

A six-button controller from Fujitsu was available for use with Capcom's Street Fighter II. Capcom also released an adaptor for their CPS Fighter stick which made the stick compatible with the FM Towns/Marty as well as the Sharp X68000.<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;FM Towns Marty&quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "111687": {"rpgdesigner": ["Anna Dobritt", "J.

This wonder element acts as a super conductor, and would launch a new epoch in technology for all humankind, and the Conglomocorporation that controls stands to make a fortune.<br/><br/>Since Gottahavium can only be found in deepest reaches of the ocean, a very inhospitable places for humans, Deep Sea Drones (DSDs) are utilized to locate and then mine the deposits.<br/><br/>With so much on the line, the ConCorps have covertly shifted resources from military contracts to ensure they will be the sole proprietors.  And so, a quiet little war has sprung up under the sea.<br/><br/><br/>Gameplay:<br/><br/>Each player controls one of three ConCorp exploratory forces, which are vying for control of the limited deposits in the volatile oceanic depths.<br/><br/>The game is patterned after the classic Micro/Mini-games in the late 70&rsquo;s early 80&rsquo;s, and is meant to be a light quick wargame that can be played in a single session.<br/><br/>Before starting, players must choose the scale of the game they wish to play.  This can range from a small skirmish, allowing for multiple sessions in a night, or have a much larger scale conflict that would allow for a much more in depth battle.<br/><br/>Once the size of the game is decided, player will pick a ConCorp to represent, and the pick their force of DSDs.  Each ConCorp has 5 different drones to choose from, with an overall theme for each of the 3 ConCorps.<br/><br/>After setup, players take turns mining &amp; moving, with a simultaneous fire phase between each player&rsquo;s move phase, so as not to give any one player an advantage in being able to move in, without repercussions.<br/><br/>However, this is not just a straight up shooting gallery.  As with many games of this genre, the map is hex based, and the terrain has an impact on both movement and combat.  There are also oceanic events, such as strong currents, undersea volcanoes and seaquakes that provide a random element that can ruin even the best-laid plans of AIs and Drones.<br/><br/>While the main goal is to attempt to mine a set number of resources (depending on game size), players can also take a more offensive stance and attempt to annihilate the other player&rsquo;s base going for the more brutal total victory.<br/><br/><br/>The Future?:<br/><br/>The game was created as part of the Microgame contest here on BGG, but there are plans to expand it beyond the bounds of the initial restraints of that contest.<br/><br/>The goal will be to release expansion modules over time, which will add new drones, ConCorps , maps and rules, all of which will be compatible with the existing system, including having map halves being interchangeable.<br/><br/>"}, "111704": {"rpgartist": ["Brett Barkley", "Andrew Cremeans", "Brendon Fraim", "Brian Fraim", "John Grigni", "Scott Heine", "Mark Helwig", "Fred Hicks", "Sam Kennedy", "John Lees", "Christian N.

To set up each of the three cities in the game, draw five gangster cards at random, then place them in a row in numerical order (with a range of 1-80). Even and odd cards belong to different gangs and are color-coded. Each player has a hand of four gangster cards and a random special action card.<br/><br/>On a turn, each player chooses one gangster and one city card/one special card, then they reveal them simultaneously. Players place cards in ascending order from lowest to highest. If a gangster was played with a city card, it's placed in that city in the proper numerical spot; if it was played with a special card, it can be placed in any city, with the special card being placed in the same city before or after the gangster. If the card you placed is one of two gangsters surrounding at least two gangsters of the other color, then you capture the surrounded gangsters and remove them from play. Special cards let you play on the end of a row, switch a gangster from even to odd (or vice versa), or move a gangster from one row to another.<br/><br/>After four rounds, players discard their special card (if it hasn't been played), then receive a new hand of four gangsters and a special card. Any rows with fewer than five cards are filled to five cards. The game continues until not enough cards remain to fill players' hands and the rows; when this happens, the game ends immediately and players count the revolvers on the gangsters they've captured.

F&ouml;nsterluckorna p&aring; det lilla v&auml;rdshuset var f&ouml;rseglade och elden sprakade med magins f&ouml;rtrollande kraft. Vinden tj&ouml;t och vinterstormen rasade runt husets knutar. L&aring;ngv&auml;ga hade vi vandrat f&ouml;r att tr&auml;ffa denna mytomspunne man och lyssna p&aring; hans ber&auml;ttelser. Det sades att han hade dragit sig tillbaka fr&aring;n klosterlivet bistra liv sedan m&aring;nga vintrar tillbaka. Han hette Jorge Gronfjard och hade en g&aring;ng i tiden varit Ovus fr&auml;msta bestiarie, en s&aring;dan som kartlade v&aring;r v&auml;rlds bestar och vidunder. Hans kunskaper var outsinliga och alla fr&aring;gor som vi st&auml;llde fick vi svar p&aring;. Han l&auml;rde oss att de fruktade hrimtursarna bar p&aring; en s&aring;dan k&ouml;ld att folk dog om de kom n&auml;ra de v&auml;ldiga j&auml;ttarna. Med ivriga ord och brinnande &ouml;gon ber&auml;ttade han om hur logedrakarna och j&auml;ttespindlarna en g&aring;ng varit bittra fiender. Han ber&auml;ttade om den m&ouml;rka andekraften som gjorde att de ondskefulla trollen st&auml;ndigt var p&aring; jakt efter nya sj&auml;lar.<br/> Pl&ouml;tsligt tystnade knarret fr&aring;n gungstolen och Jorge sl&ouml;t sina &ouml;gon. Bl&aring;sten avtog i styrka och det verkade som om vinden som varit hans livskamrat under s&aring; m&aring;nga &aring;r nu v&ouml;rdnadsfullt sa adj&ouml;. Jorge var h&auml;dang&aring;ngen. Kanske for han till den gud som han tillbett under s&aring; m&aring;nga &aring;r, kanske blev han ett med vinden. N&auml;r vi senare p&aring; kv&auml;llen gick igenom den gamle mannens f&aring; &auml;godelar f&ouml;r att skicka dem tillbaka till klostret fann vi en m&auml;rklig bok.

The window boards in the small inn were locked and the fire cracked with the enchanting power of magic. The wind howled and the winter storm raged outside the house. We had walked a long way to meet this legendary man and hear his stories. It was said he had retired from the harsh life in the cloisters many winters ago. His name was Jorge Gronfjard and had once upon a time been Ovus' best beastiary, a man who cataloged our worlds beasts and creatures. His knowledge was inexhaustible and he answered all our questions. He taught us that the feared Hrimtursar carried such a coldness that men who went to near the enormous giants died. With eager words and sparkling eyes he told us about how the Logedrakar and giant spiders used to be bitter enemies. He told us about the dark spiritual powers tha made the evil trolls keep constantly hunting for new souls.<br/> Suddenly the creaking from the rocking chair ceased and Jorge closed his eyes. The wind ceased and it seemed as if the wind, which had been his life partner for so many years, now said a respectful good bye. Jorge had passed on. Maybe he went to the god he had worshiped for so long, maybe he became one with the wind. When we later that night looked through the old mans few possessions to send them back to the cloister, we found a strange book. The front was graced by two loaded words: Jorge's Beastiary. When we looked through it we found a treasure, the like of we had never seen.<br/><br/>Jorges Bestiarium takes you deeper into the world of fairy tales than you could ever imagine. Now all the beasts of Trudvang are categorized. Jorges Bestiarium contains grand descriptions of each monster and detailed rules for how to play them. In the book you will also find the description of a new religion - Hamingjes, the dark faith - and the first official map of Trudvang.<br/> Come with us on a journey through Trudvang! Let Jorges Bestiarium be an insatiable source of inspiration for you in your scenarios and campaigns.<br/> To use Jorges Bestiarium you will need Drakar &amp; Demoner: Rollspelet.<br/><br/>"}, "111775": {"poll": [], "name": "1830: Chattanooga Promotional Card", "playingtime": "0", "minplayers": "2", "yearpublished": "2011", "boardgameexpansion": [], "usersrated": "12", "boardgamefamily": ["18xx", "Country: USA", "Promotional Cards"], "maxplayers": "7", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1130042_t.jpg", "average": "7.25833", "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["Lookout Games", "Mayfair Games"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1130042.jpg", "boardgameversion": ["First edition"], "maxplaytime": "0", "boardgamecategory": ["Expansion for Base-game", "Trains"], "age": "0", "minplaytime": "0", "description": "A micro-expansion for 1830: Railways &amp; Robber Barons featuring one city, Chattanooga.

Two years later, through masterful propaganda and factional maneuver, Castro, his brother Ra&uacute;l, and iconic revolutionary Che Guevara had united disparate guerrillas and exploited Cubans&rsquo; deep opposition to their dictator Fulgencio Batista y Zald&iacute;var.  Castro&rsquo;s takeover of the country became a model for Leftist insurgency.<br/><br/>Castro&rsquo;s Insurgency<br/><br/>Following up on GMT Games&rsquo; Andean Abyss about insurgency in modern Colombia, the next volume in the COIN Series, Cuba Libre, takes 1 to 4 players into the Cuban Revolution.  Castro&rsquo;s &ldquo;26 July Movement&rdquo; must expand from its bases in the Sierra Maestra mountains to fight its way to Havana.  Meanwhile, anti-communist student groups, urban guerrillas, and expatriates try to de-stabilize the Batista regime from inside and out, while trying not to pave the way for a new dictatorship under Castro.  Batista&rsquo;s Government must maintain steam to counter the twin insurgency, while managing two benefactors:  its fragile US Alliance and its corrupting Syndicate skim.  And in the midst of the turmoil, Meyer Lansky and his Syndicate bosses will jockey to keep their Cuban gangster paradise alive.<br/><br/>COIN Series, Volume II<br/><br/>Cuba Libre will be easy to learn for Andean Abyss players&mdash;both volumes share the same innovative GMT COIN Series system.  Like Volume I, Cuba Libre is equally playable solitaire or by multiple players up to 4&mdash;and with a shorter time to completion than Andean Abyss.  But Cuba Libre&rsquo;s situation and strategic challenges will be new.  A deck of 48 fresh events brings 1950s Cuba to life and includes &hellip;<br/><br/>&bull; The Twelve:  The first wave&rsquo;s escape to the Sierra Maestra&mdash;inspirational legend or harbinger of defeat?<br/>&bull; El Che and Ra&uacute;l:  Brilliant in the field, or bungling hostage-takers?<br/>&bull; Operation Fisherman:  Can the rebels pull off a second invasion?<br/>&bull; General Strike:  Urban disruption or rebel embarrassment?<br/>&bull; Radio Rebelde:  Are the masses tuning in, or just the Army direction finders?<br/>&bull; Pact of Caracas:  Can the rebels unite?<br/>&bull; Armored Cars:  Mobile striking power, but in whose hands?<br/>&bull; Rolando Masferrer:  Brutal pro-government tactics&mdash;will they help or hurt?<br/>&bull; Fat Butcher:  Can the Mob&rsquo;s enforcer protect its casinos?<br/>&bull; Sinatra:  Frankie&rsquo;s Havana show a boom or bust, and who collects?<br/>&hellip; and much more.<br/><br/>New twists match the COIN Series system to the situation in 1950s Cuba:<br/><br/>&bull; It&rsquo;s the insurgents who build lasting capabilities, while the Government is limited to fleeting bursts of momentum.<br/>&bull; The Syndicate&rsquo;s bases are Casinos&mdash;expensive to build, but so important to Cuba no army will destroy them.  <br/>&bull; Syndicate special activities include calling in the &ldquo;muscle&rdquo; of Government troops and police to protect mob assets.  <br/>&bull; Stacks of Syndicate cash awaiting launder can fall in anyone&rsquo;s hands&mdash;even the corrupt Government&rsquo;s.<br/>&bull; The Government has its own terror tactic&mdash;reprisals&mdash;and can skim a portion of Syndicate profits.<br/>&bull; The eroding US Alliance with Batista overshadows all Government actions, not just through aid levels but also through the day-to-day ability of troops and police to operate.<br/>&bull; Even if Batista flees, the struggle may not end&mdash;the counterrevolutionary government may even become stronger!<br/><br/>Multiplayer, 2-Player, Solitaire<br/><br/>Cuba Libre provides up to 4 players with contrasting roles and overlapping victory conditions for rich diplomatic interaction. For 2- or 3-player games, players can represent alliances of factions, or the game system can control non-player factions . Or a single player as the Cuban Revolutionaries can attempt to topple Batista and seize power for themselves. The non-player sides will fight one another as well as the players, but too much power in the hands of any one of them will mean player defeat.<br/><br/>More COIN Series Volumes to Come<br/><br/>Andean Abyss and now Cuba Libre present a game system on modern insurgency readily adaptable to other conflicts, particularly those featuring the interaction of many sides (thus the name COunterINsurgency Series). A rich and under-represented history of guerrilla warfare beckons, as modern insurgency offers virtually unlimited, under-gamed topics for the COIN Series.

When a level has been completed within its time limit, the player starts on the next.<br/><br/>The player's control over the motorcycle allows moving the front wheel upwards or downwards, allowing for jumps over obstacles and rotating stunts when in the air. If the player lands incorrectly, the rider will fall off his bike and climb back on it.

Gravity pulls the platform and pieces from side to side as the tower rises, so players might have a tough time adding a piece to the stack &ndash; especially since each level must be filled before players can play on top of other bricks.

When a player plays her final piece, the game ends. Players then score one point for each brick of theirs visible from a top-down view of the tower. Whoever has the high score wins.<br/><br/>Tremblex, a revised version of Shake Shake Tower, uses the same pieces and nearly the same scoring method, but players are free to place pieces as they wish on the tower &ndash; with one small exception that drives play in a different direction. Each piece you place must touch one of your pieces already in play; if all of your pieces have been covered by other players, then you're forced to sit out until someone else knocks pieces off the tower! Once this happens, all players are back in the game. The game ends when a player places her final piece, and players tally their scores, earning one point for each brick showing from a top-down view of the tower, losing one point for each brick in pieces knocked off the tower, and collecting a three point bonus if their piece is highest up in the tower.<br/><br/>Tremblex includes variant rules as well, such as a cooperative mode in which players try to complete the tower with no holes and a two-player game in which opponents place pieces only on their half of the platform, trying to scale higher than the other player in order to win.<br/><br/>"}, "111872": {"rpgartist": ["(Uncredited)"], "statistics": [], "name": "The Guild Companion (Sep 2009)", "rpgdesigner": ["Nicholas Caldwell", "Massimiliano Caracristi", "R.

The rules have been crafted to give players a deep experience without having to sacrifice choice. There are many way to play and there are nearly infinite builds allowing a player to craft her character to be exactly what she wants. Design efficiency is the key; keeping and utilizing rules that allow the system to be deep enough that players can shape, yet not so deep that the rules are dozens of pages deep.<br/><br/>Age Past is also designed to be modifiable. There are many optional rules that can help set the proper depth of complexity for the Game Master (GM). Play with anything you want and make new stuff up! If something seems too powerful then tone it back and if something seems weak then make it stronger. The GM and players can choose the level of intensity when playing.<br/><br/>Many gamers enjoy intricate investigation scenarios. Some love brutal combat. Others enjoy evenly matched and tough combat with big boss fights. Others love political intrigue. In Age Past all of these scenarios are possible. The GM and players can craft a gaming experience that is of their own choosing. Age Past has minion and henchman combat rules, so if you like, you can sit back and let your underlings duke it out for you... or you can get in there and sever some heads. The combat system is simple yet is broken up into actions. Characters can spend actions to make things happen so combat becomes more dynamic than just move and attack. A typical combat includes attacking, moving, counter attacking, and moving again. There are many abilities that can be used right along with attacking.<br/><br/>The magic system in Age Past was designed to give those who like casting magic the ability to use it in any circumstance that is listed above. Casters have access to powerful damaging, mind altering, and mystery solving spells. Any spell can be cast at any time as often as you like so there are not any limitations except your caster&rsquo;s stamina. Utility spells are build right in with all the other spells so there&rsquo;s no need to try to choose between the &ldquo;fire blast&rdquo; and &ldquo;open lock&rdquo; spells.<br/><br/>The skill system has been completely rethought and designed to help keep character&rsquo;s balanced and every ability in the game is paid for in build points known as BP&rsquo;s. This means that the more powerful the ability the more it costs to add it to your character. While character balance is perfect, it keeps everyone in line so that no one gets left behind.<br/><br/>Terres is the world that Age Past takes place in. It is made up of different spheres. A sphere is an area of land or continent separated by water, mountains, or crevasses. Each sphere is attached to its neighbor, but travel between the two is impossible or extremely difficult. Hence, natural life in each sphere as grown and developed differently over the many thousands of years.<br/><br/>Time and gravity on Terres is constant unless altered by a magic spell or Gods&rsquo; intervention. Characters will become hungry and need to sleep, and they will age at a standard rate. Different realms have different physical rules and will act differently from how Terres works. Realms are areas that lay on top of or coincident with each other. Travel between realms is extremely difficult and is only done by strong magic. In some realms characters will not grow hungry or age, while others will speed up time for the travelers or slow it down in relation to Terres. Not surprisingly, the races and cultures can live exclusively in these realms will be very strange to those who live outside.<br/><br/>"}, "111905": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1139046.png", "poll": [], "boardgamedesigner": ["Thomas Schuster"], "statistics": [], "yearpublished": "0", "maxplayers": "5", "boardgameartist": ["Tom Espen"], "boardgamepublisher": ["Espenlaub"], "maxplaytime": "25", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1139046_t.png", "minplaytime": "25", "boardgamecategory": ["Dice", "Racing", "Sports"], "description": "Objective: make most of your money manipulating the running-in<br/>- moving by turns -<br/>1 each player draws a hidden card which proposes a different running-in of the 5 (coloured) horses<br/>2 each player rolls 3 coloured dice - colours on top designate the horses to be moved during this turn - 3, 2 and 1 space<br/>by choice of the active player<br/>3 if a die shows a horseshoe - free choice<br/>4 obstacles and/or special positions are going to change/modify results<br/>5 if all horses have crossed the finish line there is a check/comparison how many positions are matching with the running-in proposal on your card<br/>6 after collecting points players will run 2 additional rounds<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": ["First edition"], "age": "8", "name": "Pferde-Rallye", "playingtime": "25", "boardgamemechanic": ["Betting/Wagering", "Roll / Spin and Move"], "average": "4", "usersrated": "1", "boardgamefamily": ["Sports: Horse Racing"]}, "111906": {"rpgartist": ["Noah Bradley", "Britt Martin", "David A.

[..] The game is the first main entry in the Grand Theft Auto series since 2008's Grand Theft Auto IV. Set within the fictional state of San Andreas (based on Southern California), the single-player story follows three criminals and their efforts to commit heists while under pressure from a government agency. The open world design lets players freely roam San Andreas, which includes open countryside and the fictional city of Los Santos (based on Los Angeles).<br/><br/>The game is played from a third-person perspective and its world is navigated on-foot or by vehicle. Players control the three lead protagonists throughout the single-player mode, switching between them both during and outside of missions. The story is centred on the heist sequences, and many of the missions involve shooting and driving gameplay. The player character's criminal activities may incite a response from law enforcement agencies, measured by a &quot;wanted&quot; system that governs the aggression of their response. Grand Theft Auto Online, the online multiplayer mode, lets up to 30 players explore the open world and engage in cooperative or competitive game matches.<br/><br/>Development began in 2009, soon after the release of Grand Theft Auto IV. The development team envisioned Grand Theft Auto V as a spiritual successor to many of their previous projects, such as Red Dead Redemption and Max Payne 3. The game's use of three lead protagonists is a break from series tradition&mdash;a design choice from the developers to innovate on the core structure of its predecessors. As part of their research for the open world, the developers conducted field research around California throughout development and captured footage for the design team. Development duties were shared between many of Rockstar's studios worldwide.<br/><br/>Following its announcement in October 2011, Grand Theft Auto V was widely anticipated. It was acclaimed by many reviewers, with praise particularly directed at its multiple protagonist design, open-ended gameplay and technical advancements. Critics were polarised by a scene depicting torture and the game's treatment of women. Some labeled the game inherently violent and misogynistic. Grand Theft Auto V broke industry sales records and became the fastest-selling entertainment product in history, earning US $800 million in its first day and US $1 billion in its first three days. It won year-end accolades, including Game of the Year awards from several gaming publications.<br/><br/>Gameplay<br/><br/>Grand Theft Auto V is an action-adventure game played from a third-person perspective. Players complete missions&mdash;linear scenarios with set objectives&mdash;to progress through the story. Outside of missions, players can freely roam the open world. Composed of the San Andreas open countryside area and the fictional city of Los Santos, the world of Grand Theft Auto V is much larger in area than earlier entries in the series. The world may be fully explored from the beginning of the game without restrictions, although story progress unlocks more gameplay content.<br/><br/>Players use melee attacks, firearms and explosives to fight enemies, and may run, jump, swim or use vehicles to navigate the world. To accommodate the map's size, the game introduces vehicle types absent in its predecessor Grand Theft Auto IV, such as fixed-wing aircraft. In combat, auto-aim and a cover system can be used as assistance against enemies. Should players take damage, their health meter will gradually regenerate to its halfway point. Players respawn at hospitals when their health depletes. If players commit crimes while playing, law enforcement agencies may respond as indicated by a &quot;wanted&quot; meter in the head-up display (HUD). On the meter, the displayed stars indicate the current wanted level (for example, at the maximum five-star level, efforts by law enforcement to incapacitate players become very aggressive). Law enforcement officers will search for players who leave the wanted vicinity. Players arrested or killed by officers during missions may restart from the last checkpoint. The meter enters a cooldown mode and eventually recedes when players are hidden from the officers' line of sight (as displayed on the mini-map).<br/><br/>The single-player mode lets players control three characters: Michael De Santa, Trevor Philips and Franklin Clinton&mdash;criminals whose stories interconnect as they complete missions. Some missions are completed with only one character and others feature two or three.[22] Throughout single-player, players may switch between the protagonists at will by means of a directional compass on the HUD. The game may switch between characters automatically in single-player missions to complete certain objectives. A character's compass avatar will flash red if he is in danger and needs help, and flash white if he has a strategic advantage.[23] Though players complete missions as any of the three protagonists, the more difficult heist missions require aid from AI-controlled accomplices with unique skill sets, such as computer hacking or driving. If an accomplice survives a successful heist, they take a cut from the cash reward[24] and may be available for later missions with improvements to their unique skills.[25] The game encourages differentiation in heist mission strategies&mdash;for example, in a holdup mission, players may either stealthily subdue civilians with an agent or conspicuously storm the venue with guns drawn.<br/><br/>Each character has a set of eight skills that represent their ability in certain areas such as shooting and driving. Though players improve characters' skills as they play, each character has a skill with expertise by default (e.g. Trevor's flying skill). The eighth &quot;special&quot; skill determines the effectiveness in performing an ability that is unique to each respective character. Michael enters bullet time in combat, Franklin slows down time while driving, and Trevor deals twice as much damage to enemies while taking half as much in combat. A meter on each character's HUD depletes when an ability is being used and regenerates when players perform skilful actions (for example, drifting in vehicles as Franklin or pulling off headshots as Michael).<br/><br/>While free roaming the game world, players may engage in context-specific activities such as scuba diving underwater or BASE jumping via parachute. Each character has a smartphone for contacting friends, starting activities and accessing an in-game Internet. The Internet lets players trade in stocks via a stock market. Players may purchase properties such as homes and businesses, upgrade the weapons and vehicles in each character's arsenal, and customise their appearance by purchasing outfits, haircuts, tattoos and jewelery.<br/><br/>Developed in tandem with the single-player mode, the online multiplayer mode Grand Theft Auto Online was conceived as a separate experience to be played in a continually evolving world. Up to 30 players freely roam across a re-creation of the single-player world and enter lobbies to complete jobs (story-driven competitive and cooperative modes). The Content Creator toolset lets players create their own parameters for custom jobs, like racetracks and deathmatch weapon spawn points.[36] Players may band together in organised player teams called crews to complete jobs together. Rockstar Games Social Club extends crews formed in Max Payne 3's multiplayer mode to that of Grand Theft Auto Online. Players can create their own crews and join up to five total. Crews win multiplayer matches to earn experience points and climb online leaderboards.<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;Grand Theft Auto V&quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "111921": {"rpgartist": ["(Uncredited)"], "statistics": [], "name": "Rebel Times (Issue 31 - Apr 2010)", "rpgdesigner": ["Tomasz \"Sting\" Chmielik", "Rafa\u0142 Cholewa", "Tomasz \"Gambit\" Dobosz", "Mateusz \"Darcane\" Nowak", "Mateusz \"JAskier\" Pitulski", "Micha\u0142 \"de99ial\" Romaniuk", "Arkady Saulski", "Marcin \"Ajfel\" Zawi\u015blak"], "rpgproducer": ["Marcin \"Ajfel\" Zawi\u015blak"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1137579.jpg", "usersrated": "0", "average": "0", "rpgissue": ["Rebel Times"], "rpgissuearticle": ["Aktualno\u015bci", "Daj kamienia!", "Imperium Galaktyczne w 30 minut", "Jak oceniamy", "Jestem szalenie dumny z tego, co uda\u0142o nam si\u0119 osi\u0105gn\u0105\u0107", "M\u00f3zgo\u017cerny przegl\u0105d", "P\u0119dz\u0105cych kapsli ci\u0105g dalszy", "Pierwsze kroki w IV ods\u0142onie D&D", "Plany na maj", "Pojedynek na karty", "Polska nierz\u0105dem stoi", "Spis tre\u015bci", "Szale\u0144stwo?

In Olga Romanoff, written in 1893-4 and set in 2030-37, the last inheritor of the Tsar takes her devastating revenge. Both are lavishly illustrated by Fred T.

The hero and Jowee (who loves adventure) go off to Jangala to find Zsasha, who has been held captive for days by the monkey king. Shadow walkers appear; invading Jangala. After the hero defeats them and saves Zsasha, the monkey king gives them a strage mask (which will later be important to the story). Mari realizes Zsasha did not steal the items. Mari and her assistant Circi wonder who the thief is. Mari believes Wilfre might be the thief. To make sure if Wilfre is alive Mari sends the hero (and Jowee) to Shadow City. Soon the hero finds the ink factory working again creating shadows. The hero then finds Wilfre's journal which holds a plot to destroy the Creator. They must get; branches from the tree of ages, the eternal furnace, a pen and pencil, (which they already have) and a magic mask (which they also have, given to them by the monkey king). Mari sends the hero to Icy Wastes to find the eternal furnace. While there, a strange shadow creature appears stealing it. The shadow creature is unknown but resembles a Raposa girl. Soon in the Eastern Winds the tree of ages is in danger. After fighting off the shadow creatures the hero saves the tree. Mari is happy Wilfre's plan has failed till Circi reveals she's Wilfre's wife. She uses the items that the hero had found to make creation ink and recreate Wilfre, but she can't remember what he looks like. She keeps on drawing pictures of him but they don't resemble Wilfre. After throwing away the pictures they begin to combine together creating a monster. The items used for creating the monster combine into it too. The village is flooded with ink and the monster.

To set up the game, you divide the number tiles into four piles based on the number of scarabs on them, with more scarabs typically signifying larger numbers. To create the number pyramid, you lay out one tile with four scarabs, two tiles with three, and so on.<br/><br/>On a turn, one players rolls the three dice &ndash; an octahedron, a decahedron and a dodecahedron &ndash; then all players try to use the four fundamental arithmetic operations to transform the numbers on two or three of the dice to match one of the numbers on a tile. For example, amongst the cards on the board is a 72 and you rolled two 8s and one 1; you can calculate 8 x (8 + 1) and the result is 72. As soon as a player has reached a target number, she takes that tile off the game board, then flips the thirty-second sand timer. Everyone else can grab one tile during this time, then once time expires the players must demonstrate how they reached the number in question. If a player calculated correctly, she keeps the tile face-up; otherwise she flips it face-down as a penalty.<br/><br/>Players then fill up empty spaces on the game board, then roll the dice again to start another round. As soon as a row cannot be filled, the game ends. Players then tally the scarabs they collected, subtract penalty scarabs, and see who has the highest score.<br/><br/>"}, "112000": {"rpgartist": ["(Uncredited)"], "statistics": [], "name": "The Hall of Fire (Issue 81 - Sep 2011)", "rpgdesigner": ["Luke Enyart", "Micah A.
