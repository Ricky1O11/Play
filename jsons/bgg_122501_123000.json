As her first act, she strangled him with his own &ldquo;soap-on-a-rope&rdquo; while being forced to bathe him.

Embark on an epic, story-based adventure through a variety of huge environments. Explore, level up, customize, fight, talk, and more! Experience a unique blend of action, adventure, and RPG in a brand new, fully realized fantasy setting!<br/><br/>Source: The Game Website.<br/><br/>Bug Heroes Quest is a Universal iPhone game set in the world of Bug Heroes, released on August 3rd, 2011. Unlike Bug Heroes' survival-based, high score-focused gameplay, Quest focuses more on RPG elements, continuous gameplay, persistant elements and the story of the BH universe. Bug Heroes Quest explores the backstories of its heroes, and further explore the world in which the events of Bug Heroes transpire.<br/><br/>Bug Heroes Quest originally sold at a sale price of $0.99 for the first three days, but is now $1.99 with three IAPs (the new cheats). It focuses on the original three heroes: Ant, Beetle, and Spider, but will still feature the 9 heroes. Only one 'reinforcement' hero appears on the game: Roach the Mechanic. A trailer of the game is available on YouTube.<br/><br/>PLOT<br/><br/>The plot begins before the events of Bug Heroes. The scorpions had only just recently attacked, with armies of bugs already captured. The actual game begins when Master Spider, a black widow assassin spider, assigns Spider to kill some rebel ants. Later she is ordered to kill their general ant, but not before she shakes her trust with the other spiders. Master Spider has her interrogate their prisoner which happens to be Worm, who does not tell her a single secret. While the colony is attacked by enemy forces, Spider is told by Master Spider that she needs to kill a beetle general. However Worm mentioned earlier that he could help take away her uneasiness.<br/>Meanwhile in the Garden, Beetle, that same mentioned general, begins to fight some bugs that trespassed his village. He then decides to retire. However his fighting career must continue when the scorpions attack the village over night.<br/><br/>Spider gets to the Garden, but the villiage has already been destroyed. Many beetle corpses are found laying around, with the huts burned down. However, Beetle's body was nowhere to be found. Spider, confused, traveled back to Garage to report what happened. Meanwhile, Beetle somehow awoke in the Kitchen.<br/><br/>GAMEPLAY<br/><br/>The game play is mostly similar to it's predecessor, Bug Heroes. It's a 3D shooter with different characters, and multiple abilities. However, RPG-like elements are added, such as damage shown and upgradable damage (through treasures), and there are much more numerous level-up skills. Unlike Bug Heroes, most of the missions require you to destroy a certain enemy/object or get to a certain place, but some missions tell you to survive for x amount of minutes. Food spawns around the areas, similarly to Bug Heroes, as a healing source. Also, most of the missions contain a treasure, which gives you some ability or equipment to upgrade one of your heroes. It is also more story-driven, progressing as you complete the missions.<br/><br/>Source: Wikia, &quot;<a target='_blank' href='http://bugheroes.wikia.com/wiki/Bug_Heroes_Quest&quot' rel='nofollow'>http://bugheroes.wikia.com/wiki/Bug_Heroes_Quest&quot</a>;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "122926": {"statistics": {}, "name": "Catch A Word", "videogamemode": {"2149": "Single-Player"}, "videogameversion": {"161153": "iPhone edition"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1276758.png", "videogametheme": {"2564": "Words"}, "usersrated": "0", "average": "0", "videogamegenre": {"2153": "Educational"}, "videogameplatform": {"4443": "iPhone"}, "poll": {}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1276758_t.png", "description": "&quot;Hurry.

AD 2012 - Beyond&infin;, players are ancient astronomers reading the stars and sun patterns. Using the Mayan Haab agricultural calendar invented in roughly 500 BC, players inform their villages when to best plant their seeds so that they may grow a tremendous harvest to feed their people. After their seeds are planted, the astronomers recommend rituals to aid in their harvest and their reading of prophecies in the stars, but problems arise. A village conducting a ritual to help their crop could be stealing the power of the sun or cosmos from a nearby neighbor. Droughts may crush other villages.<br/><br/>After crops have been harvested, the ancient astronomers now begin to forecast the prophecies of the stars. Using the technologies found in the Aztec Calendar, the important messages from the sky above may be telling us when and how the world will end. Players wager a bet about the ultimate destiny. With their knowledge of Prophecy they may influence this ultimate end, and also may know the exact date! Could the world end by the fires of a super volcano in 1969 AD, or will an alien race arrive in 2012 AD, or will a super nova occur light years away destroying our planet in 3,000,000,000 years? Players are now trusted prophets and will have the knowledge of the end of time.<br/><br/>The game can be played as either a basic SUN game or an advanced DESTINY game. The basic Sun game involves players moving the tiles by conducting rituals, tile positioning can help or hinder players as they grow crops and collect prophetic knowledge. Players in the basic game will score for the amount of villages they feed and Prophecy tokens they collect. The Destiny game is for players desiring a more involved game in which Prophecy tokens, earned conducting ritual, must be used to either influence the value of villages, investments in the future, and/or influencing how and when the world may come to an end.<br/><br/>"}, "122963": {"statistics": {}, "name": "Legend of Grimrock", "videogamemode": {"2149": "Single-Player"}, "videogameversion": {"255790": "Linux Downloadable edition"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1286582.jpg", "videogameseries": {"26022": "Legend of Grimrock"}, "videogametheme": {"2148": "Fantasy"}, "usersrated": "103", "videogamecharacter": {"17674": "Giant Spider"}, "average": "7.42913", "videogamegenre": {"2789": "Dungeon Crawler"}, "videogameplatform": {"5248": "Linux"}, "videogamehonor": {"20111": "2012 Golden Geek Best Indie Video Game Nominee"}, "poll": {}, "vgcharacterversion": {"280032": "Giant Spider"}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1286582_t.jpg", "description": "What is Legend of Grimrock?<br/><br/>- Old-school dungeon crawling game inspired by Dungeon Master, Eye of the Beholder and Ultima Underworld.<br/>- Explore a vast dungeon riddled with hidden switches, pressure plates, sliding walls, trapdoors and more.<br/>- Discover secrets, cast spells with runes and craft potions with herbs.<br/>- Fight murderous monsters and seek lost artifacts in ancient tombs.<br/>- Create a party of four characters and customize them with different races, classes, skills and traits.<br/><br/>Legend of Grimrock is a dungeon crawling role playing game with an oldschool heart but a modern execution. A group of prisoners are sentenced to certain death by exiling them to the secluded Mount Grimrock for vile crimes they may or may not have committed. Unbeknownst to their captivators, the mountain is riddled with ancient tunnels, dungeons and tombs built by crumbled civilizations long perished now. If they ever wish to see daylight again and reclaim their freedom the ragtag group of prisoners must form a team and descend through the mountain, level by level.<br/><br/>The game brings back the oldschool challenge with highly tactical real-time combat and grid-based movement, devious hidden switches and secrets as well as deadly traps and horrible monsters. Legend of Grimrock puts an emphasis on puzzles and exploration and the wits and perception of the player are more important tools than even the sharpest of swords could be. And if you are a hardened dungeon crawling veteran and you crave an extra challenge, you can arm yourself with a stack of grid paper and turn on the Oldschool Mode which disables the luxury of the automap!

It&rsquo;s working with everyone else without wanting to run screaming for the hills.<br/><br/>Collaborating with smart people on challenging problems is, inevitably, fraught with conflict. Conflict can be good for creative work, moving a project forward as designers wrestle with the challenge. But not all conflict is healthy, and frankly most designers aren&rsquo;t, shall we say, diplomats.<br/><br/>Surviving Design Projects is, among other things, a little game to help designers hone their people skills. It&rsquo;s pretty easy. Each player takes turns being the Creative Director. He or she turns over a Situation card, and then tells a little story about the situation shown. She can make it up or draw from her own experience.<br/><br/>Let's say I turn over the situation &quot;Lack of Inputs.&quot; Maybe I make up this story:<br/><br/>Though the client has provided stacks of user research, they can&rsquo;t offer us any clear business priorities. They&rsquo;re just asking us to make their site better without giving us a sense of what they want to accomplish. I need to go talk to the client about this, and try to get them to give us some inputs.<br/><br/>Each player around the table chooses a Pattern card from their hand and places it face-up next to the situation card. The Creative Director chooses one player to go first and describe how they would apply the pattern to the situation. That is, to describe the technique would they use to make the conflict productive. Let&rsquo;s say one player uses &ldquo;Make Educated Guesses&rdquo; and describes it this way:<br/><br/>The Make Educated Guesses pattern suggests we fill in the holes ourselves with some assumptions. I guess the idea is that we&rsquo;re smart people, so we should know what the starting point is. We could brainstorm a list of assumptions about the project&rsquo;s business priorities, then share that with the client to validate it.<br/><br/>The Creative Director then chooses which technique she would use to deal with the situation and leads a group discussion about the choice. The person who suggested the pattern receives the situation card. The player to the Creative Director&rsquo;s left becomes the next creative director, flipping the top Situation card, and starting again. At the end of the game, the person who has the most Situation cards is the winner.<br/><br/>So that&rsquo;s it.

Please only submit images if you own a copy or have legal access to this item.<br/><br/>    <br/><br/><br/>Cipher Complex was being developed for the Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 systems by Edge of Reality. The game was first announced in June 2006, by which time it was reported to already have been in production and self-funded for two years; the title was then signed with Sega in 2007, but in July 2009 it was revealed that the game had been cancelled by the publisher earlier that year after over half a decade of work, as noted in the LinkedIn profile of a former internal producer at the studio. Further details surrounding the cancellation and the game's fate in their entirety remain unclear to this day, as no official announcement regarding its status has been made by either Sega or Edge of Reality, however, more recently, a U.S. federal trademark registration was filed on September 11, 2009, which as of October 19, 2011, has been granted a third extension. While confirming nothing else, this does indicate that Edge of Reality has retained the intellectual property rights to the game.<br/><br/>Although the game was widely believed to be permanently cancelled by Sega, game designer Phil Fogerite (who worked as level designer on the project from March 2008 to April 2009) has most recently stated that Edge of Reality itself had in fact decided to put the game on indefinite hold.<br/><br/>The official storyline, as quoted from the game's original press release is as follows:<br/><br/>U.S. surveillance satellites detect activity onboard the decommissioned Soviet Bargration Missile Defense Station 4 off the east coast of Siberia. When the Russians deny the U.S. access to the facility, Department of Defense strategists suggest that a small, plausibly deniable reconnaissance mission be sent in to investigate. The Defense Threat Reduction Agency is given the go-ahead for operation BLACKOUT, the insertion of a single expert Operator on Russian WMDs and launch facilities. Lt. Col. John Sullivan, callsign: Cipher is air dropped in, and what was supposed to be primarily a reconnaissance mission becomes a race against a terrorist threat; one with implications that will shake the foundations of American democracy and freedoms.<br/><br/>It is unknown to which extent this plot changed throughout development. As such, the synopsis outlined above may not be indicative of the final plot intended for the game.<br/><br/>Edge of Reality was hoping to &quot;revolutionize&quot; the stealth action genre. The main character carries out various actions with speed, precision, strength and cunning stealth to neutralize enemies.<br/><br/>In June 2010, gameplay footage of a level from Cipher Complex was leaked online in via Dailymotion, depicting the player character (Cipher) infiltrating a steel mill in China, under orders to extract a General who is being held hostage; in addition, short clips of gameplay can be seen on Edge of Reality's official homepage. An &quot;in-game screenshot&quot; of the steel mill level, as well as some concept art, textures and logos from the game has also been posted to Picasa by the lead environment artist, who has since clarified that it is a demo level. Part of an early cinematic as well as some character animations were again posted via Dailymotion in March 2011.<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;Cipher Complex&quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "122986": {"rpgitemversion": {"271951": "La Maledizione di Luce della Signora"}, "poll": {}, "name": "Curse of the Lady's Light", "rpgproducer": {"36215": "Judy Bauer"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1426653.jpg", "usersrated": "9", "rpgsetting": {"1897": "Golarion"}, "average": "7.55556", "statistics": {}, "rpggenre": {"155": "Fantasy (High Fantasy)"}, "rpg": {"1627": "Pathfinder Roleplaying Game"}, "rpgcategory": {"2084": "Scenario / Adventure / Module"}, "rpgseries": {"2481": "Pathfinder Adventure Path"}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1426653_t.jpg", "description": "Publisher's blurb:<br/><br/>Varisia's newest heroes have stumbled across a powerful relic from the ancient empire of Thassilon&mdash;yet the artifact has been sundered into seven fragments.

Other factions, including the abolitionist Eagle Knights of Andoran, have their own opinions on the matter, however, and frequently send undercover agents into dangerous territory to break up slave rings.<br/><br/>When one such Eagle Knight goes missing while investigating an underground slave operation beneath the dilapidated Twilight Gate district, it&rsquo;s up to the PCs to delve an abandoned (but hardly uninhabited) qanat beneath Katapesh and discover her dire fate. Yet not everything is as it seems in the dank slave caverns under Twilight Gate, and clues hint that the slavers may have even more loathsome connections than initially suspected. Can the PCs recover the missing Eagle Knight before her fate is sealed?

Each round represents a season: spring, summer, autumn, and finally winter. Each player starts the game with a &quot;home&quot; tile and an initial team of eight workers, each of which is colored red, yellow, or blue. Workers of matching colors are used by the players to bid for tiles to add to their villages. Matching workers may alternatively be used to generate resources, skills and additional workers, not only from the player's own tiles, but also from the tiles in the other players' villages and from the new tiles being auctioned.<br/><br/>In spring, summer and autumn, more workers will arrive on board the Keyflower and her sister boats, with some of these workers possessing skills in the working of the key resources of iron, stone and wood. In each of these seasons, village tiles are set out at random for auction. In the winter no new workers arrive and the players select the village tiles for auction from those they received at the beginning of the game. Each winter village tile offers VPs for certain combinations of resources, skills and workers. The player whose village and workers generate the most VPs wins the game.<br/><br/>Keyflower presents players with many different challenges and each game will be different due to the mix of village tiles that appear in that particular game. Throughout the game, players will need to be alert to the opportunities to best utilize their various resources, transport and upgrade capability, skills and workers.<br/><br/>Keyflower, a joint design between Richard Breese and Sebastian Bleasdale, is the seventh game in the &quot;Key&quot; series from R&amp;D Games set in the medieval &quot;Key&quot; land.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": {"228291": "English / German / French edition"}, "average": "7.92843", "name": "Keyflower", "playingtime": "120", "boardgamemechanic": {"2012": "Auction/Bidding"}, "age": "12", "boardgameexpansion": {}, "usersrated": "12269", "boardgamesubdomain": {"5497": "Strategy Games"}, "boardgamefamily": {"21622": "Colonial Theme"}}, "122516": {"poll": {}, "name": "Shadow", "playingtime": "0", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": {"2055": "Paper-and-Pencil"}, "yearpublished": "1977", "usersrated": "1", "maxplayers": "2", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1268543_t.jpg", "average": "5", "statistics": {}, "boardgamepublisher": {"6354": {"name": "Games and Puzzles (magazine)"}}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1268543.jpg", "boardgameversion": {"159993": "Games & Puzzles First Publication"}, "maxplaytime": "0", "boardgamecategory": {"1009": {"name": "Abstract Strategy"}}, "age": "0", "minplaytime": "0", "description": "Logical deduction game.

It is the fourth UFC game released and the second and last on the PlayStation 2.<br/><br/>The gameplay in Sudden Impact is very similar to that of the previous entries in the series. Each fighter possess a fighting style that varies between Boxing, Karate, Kung-Fu, Luta Livre, Kempo, Muay Thai, Ninjitsu, Sambo, Submission, Sumo, Pit Fighting, Pro Wrestling, Kickboxing, Wrestling, Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu, and more. Each of the four face buttons on the controller specifically controls one of the fighter's limbs. By hitting two buttons at once, the player can perform a takedown, a grappling move, a submission move or other similar technique. An addition made to Sudden Impact's gameplay is an added focus on fence positioning. When backing an opponent into the cage that surrounds the Octagon ring, attempting a grapple maneuver will put the player into one of several different possible positions, including a standing face-off as well as a special ground-mount, where the bottom fighter's head is literally pressed against the cage. The overral gameplay is also slightly faster in comparison to the previous games. Fights are announced by Bruce Buffer and refereed by &quot;Big&quot; John McCarthy.<br/><br/>In Arcade mode, the player choose a fighter and fights against CPU controlled opponents for an unlimited number of fights. On Versus, up to two players fight against each other.  In Story Mode, the player can create his own mixed martial artist. The player start as a street fighter who is found by a MMA trainer. The trainer sets the player on the path of making it to the UFC within three years. The player then chooses one dojo out of eight, each with their own fighting styles. Each aspect of the training requires the player to perform a specific challenge, such as landing three left punches or taking an opponent down twice in a match, and more. Winning challenges earns stat points and new moves. At the end of each month, the player will be presented with an evaluation challenge, which varies between hitting a punching bag in a timing-based minigame or a simulation of the created fighter sparring against another recruit or fighter.<br/><br/>In December of each year, the player take part in an amateur Open Weight UFC-style tournament against a number of generic characters. The mode ends after three years of training are completed and the player successfully reaches the UFC. Additionally, graduating to the UFC level means that the created fighter will be available in the remainder of the game's modes.  In Champion Road, the player picks a fighter and must win four fights before having a title match. On winning, the player receives a Silver Belt. If the player choose the same fighter again, Champion Road will become Legend Mode and it is needed to win nine matches before receiving a title shot and winning the Gold Belt. On these modes, the player will only fight against fighters of his same weight class, and it is necessary to win titles to unlock certain characters on that class.  In Tournament mode, the player can compete in an eight man eliminatory tournament that mirrors the early UFC events. The player has to win two matches before reaching the final and win the tournament.<br/><br/>Although the matches in Arcade and Versus modes occur in an Open Weight format, the fighters are indeed separated in weight classes. Referee &quot;Big&quot; John McCarthy, UFC president Dana White, UFC chairman Lorenzo Fertitta and the late UFC Hall of Famer Charles Lewis, Jr., known as The Mask from the TapouT clothing brand, are also unlockable fighters.<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;UFC Sudden Impact&quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "122536": {"statistics": {}, "name": "UFC: Throwdown", "videogamemode": {"2422": "Local Multiplayer"}, "videogameversion": {"160107": "English/European GameCube edition"}, "average": "0", "videogameseries": {"5446": "Ultimate Fighting Championship"}, "videogametheme": {"2493": "Martial Arts"}, "usersrated": "0", "videogamegenre": {"2159": "Fighting"}, "videogameplatform": {"4425": "GameCube"}, "poll": {}, "description": "UFC: Throwdown, known in Japan as UFC: Tapout 2 on the PlayStation 2 and UFC 2 Tapout Final Spec. on the GameCube, is  based on the Ultimate Fighting Championship.<br/><br/>There are five different game modes; &quot;Career&quot;, &quot;UFC Mode&quot;, &quot;Arcade&quot;, &quot;Tournament&quot; and &quot;Exhibition&quot;.

After the tournament is over, the player picks a new fighting style to learn, and completes the same process until it has been done five times.<br/><br/>In UFC Mode, the player picks a heavyweight or light-heavyweight fighter and must win four fights before having a title match. On winning, the player receives a silver belt, which can later become a gold belt if UFC Mode is completed again with the same fighter. There is also an open-weight division, where the player can face fighters from outside their weight class.<br/><br/>In arcade mode the player selects a fighter and must win ten consecutive fights.

Your tongue felt heavy, thick; your arms refused to push your up. You floundered for a few minutes there, trying to get your bearings, trying to gain stability, control. You took a breath and were hit with something metallic mixed with the scent of sweat and fear. You opened your eyes, cautiously, and pushed yourself up.<br/><br/><br/>The room was small, bare concrete walls and hard stone floor. That was the first thing your saw; the second was the body. It lay in the center of the room, face-down, sprawled, a crimson pool congealed around it. The man was dressed in formal attire, though the clothes were shabby and worn. His hair was dark, mussed, matted with blood.<br/> You pushed yourself back, away from the corpse, and looked around the room wildly, alert for danger. That was when you saw the others. Four of them, two men and two women, all around the room. Three were unconscious, prone, as you had been, unceremoniously left on the floor to wake. The Fourth, one of the women, was huddled in the corner, her eyes shut tight, rocking gently and muttering to herself.<br/> Who were these people? Was one of them the killer? Were they all potential victims? What was this place, and why were you here?<br/> You searched your memory for the answers, but found nothing. Nothing at all. That struck you as slightly odd at first, but the more you searched the more terrified you became. You did not even know your name. The more you searched, though, the more you became aware that nothing was there. you could remember nothing of your life, nothing of the events that had led you here.<br/> Something was very wrong.<br/><br/><br/>Who are you?  Do you even know?  If you do, you're better off than I am, I'll tell you that much.<br/><br/> <br/>This is both a game and an adventure.  There is a story here; there are characters and places, there is a beginning, a middle, and an endgame.  But this adventure is not tied to any particular game or setting.  True, it uses the FATE 3.0 SRD as the basis for its rules, but liberties are taken, modifications are made.  You do not need any one specific FATE game to play with this book; all you need is this book, and a knowledge of how FATE works (the free FATE SRDs help with this).<br/> You're a regular person.  A good person.  This is a lie.<br/><br/><br/>In this game, you are a citizen of the Dome.  You are a good person, and you serve society in some way.  You have a good life, good friends, a loving family.  At least, that's what you think.  The life you think you know is a lie, a cleverly constructed work of fiction pulled over your eyes to blind you to who and what you truly are.  In reality, you are broken, wicked.  You have done terrible things, and you have had terrible things done to you.  Your true self is at odds with your fabricated persona, and the two will come crashing together violently; it will be up to you to determine which one isyou.  Maybe both are.  This is a game about identity, discovering your true self, and coming to terms with it.<br/> Something is wrong with the world.<br/><br/><br/>This is also a game about discovering the truth about the world around you. The scenario presented within this book is an investigative scenario, steeped in noir, dark fantasy, and Lovecraftian horror.  While you discover yourself, you will investigate the world and the people around you.  You will peel back the veneer of wholesomeness to find the darkness beneath.  And when all is said and done, you will be faced with a choice: do you find redemption, or do you become the monster your memories say you are?<br/><br/>You'll see it soon, and when you do, you won't be able to shut your eyes. You'll see it everywhere.<br/><br/>"}, "122557": {"statistics": {}, "name": "Clever & Smart", "videogamemode": {"2149": "Single-Player"}, "videogameversion": {"160159": "Amiga edition"}, "average": "0", "videogametheme": {"2279": "Comics"}, "usersrated": "0", "videogamegenre": {"2147": "Action"}, "videogameplatform": {"4415": "Amiga"}, "poll": {}, "videogamecompilation": {"206200": "Kind of Magic 3"}, "description": "User Summary: <br/>Clever &amp; Smart is an four-way scrolling, action game from 1987 from Magic Bytes.

This placement may change in the next race of the circuit depending on how well the racers do. If the player places first, he or she will be in the first position, as the placement in the following races is based on how the racers did in the previous race. The race is seen from behind the player, and uses Mode 7 effects to simulate the three dimensions.

Beer flows freely, but not even the cellars of Byggvir, the God of Beer, could quench the thirst of Nordland's greatest warriors. Servants run for cover, knowing full well where all this is going. Suddenly an eerie silence fills the common room. On the table, only one full cup remains. Who will get the last drink? Not a single step back is allowed to the warrior who wishes to enter Valhalla. One single thought in everyone's mind: may Fenrir eat the sun, that beer will be mine! All vikings laugh at the thought of death, draw their war axes, joining the fight at the call of &quot;OOOODIIIIIIIIIIN!&quot;<br/><br/>In Beer &amp; Vikings you are a fierce and thirsty viking warrior, willing to do anything to get the last cup of beer. The winner is the most drunk viking &ndash; in game terms, the player who has collected the most beer drink counters &ndash; at the end of the sudden death round.<br/><br/>Be wary, though, for drinking too much will dull your wits and mastery with the war axe. Each drink of beer prevents you from using one of your resources, be it a weapon, an item, or even your personal skill! You must always be wary not to drink too much or you risk becoming a defenseless sot in the hands of your enemies. On the other hand, you will be able to burn up some of the beer you have drunk to obtain significant bonuses which may well save your life. Show yourself as the wise warrior you are and balance your strategy with care, not burning up too much beer, thus finding yourself in the rear at the end of the game, when the cup is empty and the sudden death round begins. Those who will succumb to their enemies' blows won't be eliminated from the game, but will become Spirits of Loki, the thirsty god of evil, and team up with the other Spirits to attack the living, aiming to steal their beer. Raise your glasses (and your axes)!<br/><br/>Beer &amp; Vikings introduces 112 brand new cards! including a new type of cards called &quot;Valhalla&quot; which provide you a strong ability during the match &ndash; but to obtain them you need to kill an opponent.

You've made it this far, so congratulations are certainly in order for you&rsquo;ve chosen the greatest game ever developed by mankind: HACKMASTER. At this point, a fair warning is probably in order. In all likelihood you cut your teeth on another game system and have either picked this game up as a curiosity or plan to move to HackMaster as a temporary or permanent change of pace. The more you play HackMaster, the more you will come to realize that it behaves differently than other games. For most games, having some preconceived notion of what to expect or background experience makes the transition easier. This is often not so with HackMaster; in fact, complete gaming newbs sometimes command a distinct learning-curve advantage over their seasoned RPG counterparts. This is because while HackMaster plays like an old-school game, it more closely models real-life than any previous edition (old or new school), despite its fluid mechanics. So rather than spend the introduction to this exalted tome blathering on about how great the designers are or how devoted HackMaster fans are we will simply cover some fundamental differences with which you will need to become accustomed, all in the hopes of saving a few of your character&rsquo;s lives. In other words, this might be the first useful introduction ever penned (being as how I haven&rsquo;t read them all &ndash; I usually skip them &ndash; I cannot certify this as the strict truth). Here are some things you will find different about HackMaster than other games:<br/><br/>- You needn&rsquo;t ever wait for your turn &ndash; the whole game is based on the &lsquo;seconds&rsquo; system, much like timekeeping in the real world. If your character wants to take an action or change his mind in the middle of an action, by all means, do it! No sense standing around<br/><br/>- Both shields and armor make it easier for foes to hit your character &ndash; they simply absorb damage and deflect blows, making your character less likely to be injured. Just like in real-life!<br/><br/>- Characters use an active defense (and roll to defend as well as attack); a low roll isn't the end of the world. So you rolled a six against that orc? Don't whine about missing until the GM rolls for the hobgoblin's defense. You still have a chance &ndash; he may roll a five.<br/><br/>- Going first and fastest is not always best. Charging into a group of surprised foes may be great for the first strike, but it may also be a way to find yourself surrounded if your allies aren't as quick as you.<br/><br/>- Being surrounded or even outnumbered is a very bad thing. Taking on multiple foes, even if far inferior to your character, can be bad news. A large group of orcs will be a tough fight even for high-level characters when in other games this would be a cake-walk. It wasn&rsquo;t in the Mines of Moria and it won&rsquo;t be in HackMaster, either.<br/><br/>- Ranged weapons don't work quite as well in real-life (or for low level characters) as they do in most recent RPGs. Frankly, I&rsquo;d rather be shot with an arrow from a longbow than hit with a broad sword if forced to make that choice. Think about it.<br/><br/>- Every character cannot do everything and no character is an island. HM is a game of hard choices for each character. You need a TEAM of characters with complementary skills/abilities. HackMaster really is a game where you need to know the answer to the question, &quot;Who's Watching Your Back?&quot;<br/><br/>- Each character class has a specific role. Fighters fight and should be in front. Mages should be kept out of melee at all costs Thieves should be on point but ready to let the fighters take the lead in combat. Clerics are the party's all around support. Each role is important to party survival. Playing a thief like a fighter, or worse a mage like a fighter, just gets the character, and sometimes the party, killed.<br/><br/>- All the min/maxing during character creation doesn't mean a thing if you don't use your brain during the game. That spreadsheet that managed to save you 4 BPs on your mage/thief&rsquo;s Lying skill doesn't mean much if you try to straight-up melee a troll.<br/><br/>- 3d6 in order does NOT mean you usually get an unplayable character &ndash; HackMaster drags the average 3d6 character ability back to 10-11 from 15-16.<br/><br/>- Intelligence is important in melee &ndash; it increases your chance to hit an enemy. That&rsquo;s why the stupid giant can be defeated by the clever warrior.<br/><br/>- There are no perfect characters, but there are many different ways to create a great character.<br/><br/>- You can never tell the outcome of a battle before it starts - just because your fighter is at full hit points doesn't mean killing that goblin with the spear is a sure thing.<br/><br/>- Simply because you've encountered goblins/kobolds/zombies in other games doesn't mean they're just as easy to defeat in HackMaster.<br/><br/>- The GM is not out to kill you &ndash; he&rsquo;s out to kill you if you are foolish. A tactical withdrawal is a perfectly acceptable option &ndash; far more often than in other games you&rsquo;ll wind up in over your head.<br/><br/>In the end, the best advice I can give you is that HackMaster is a game of difficult choices. You will never have enough building points to buy everything you want (or even need). There is not one &lsquo;no brainer&rsquo; weapon that every combatant should use, nor is there one class that bests them all. The BEST advice is to just play the game with an open mind, ready to learn. Nothing brings out the genius of HackMaster like actual play. During play you begin to see how well the system flows and works.

Basically the positional shape of the holes is a five times five grid with corners removed:<br/><br/><br/>5 ooo<br/>4ooooo<br/>3ooooo<br/>2ooooo<br/>1 ooo<br/> ABCDE<br/><br/><br/>The dark player has seven dark shafted game pieces to control. The light player has seven light shafted game pieces to control. Each game piece is formed as a stick which will fit nicely into any of the holes. Each piece has coloured caps at the end in six combinations:<br/><br/>1.) yellow / orange<br/>2.) orange / red<br/>3.) red / purple<br/>4.) purple / blue<br/>5.) blue / green<br/>6.) green / yellow<br/><br/>Game rules give the hint that these form a circle of colours. This information might help and can be used to find logical game strategies here.<br/><br/>The seventh piece being special is<br/><br/>7.) white / black<br/><br/>Colour white is used being a 'wild' (joker). It can be used as a legal replacement for any colour mentioned before.<br/>Black is basically a blocker not representing any colour.<br/><br/>Players take alternating turns. When a game piece is placed in a hole one of the coloured end caps is obviously not visible anymore. Placing a game piece the non visible colour must be announced loudly and clearly enough to the opponent while setting the piece.<br/><br/>On his first turn a player must place one of his pieces into any free hole. After the first turn a turn consists of one of the following actions:<br/><br/>1.) Play another own offboard piece into another free hole, or<br/>2.) Turn any one of your already played pieces upside down in the same hole (announcing the non visible colour towards the opponent clearly and loudly), or<br/>3.) Move any one of your played pieces to another hole (but not turning it upside down)<br/><br/>The object is to get three of the same colour in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) and the first player to do so wins. Since each player's set contains only two caps of each colour (as listed above), at least one of the three-in-a-row might has to be an opponent's piece.<br/><br/>The 'wild' game piece can only be played as soon as all other six pieces are already set before. This way you can build and win creating a three-in-a-row using own and/or opponent's white game piece as well. The black colour can not be used in a three-in-a-row constellation since it is used as a blocking piece only.<br/><br/>In general each player can only move game pieces with a shaft of own colour. But any game piece can be used to form the three-in-a-row to win.<br/><br/>Initially you draw by lot who goes first. In consecutive rounds the previous loser takes the first turn.<br/><br/>You might find similarities in game play like in Quarto (published in 1991, using opponent's pieces as well to form the winning row) and Memory (published in 1959, remembering the hidden colours is definitively helpful).<br/><br/>In contrast to Tau the newer Calypso does not include the aspect of a Memory game any longer. The colour which is not visible in Tau (and has to be announced each time) is still visible in Calypso due to the other construction of the game pieces.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": {"203773": "Four Generations edition 1973"}, "name": "Tau", "playingtime": "15", "boardgamemechanic": {"2048": "Pattern Building"}, "average": "0", "usersrated": "0", "age": "10"}, "122681": {"statistics": {}, "name": "Vertex Dispenser", "videogamemode": {"2310": "Network Multiplayer"}, "videogameversion": {"160473": "Windows Downloadable edition"}, "average": "4", "videogametheme": {"2455": "Abstract"}, "usersrated": "1", "videogamegenre": {"2166": "Real Time Strategy"}, "videogameplatform": {"4977": "Windows"}, "poll": {}, "description": "Vertex Dispenser is a fast-paced abstract strategy game with mathematical puzzle elements.

The first gunslinger card game for two or more players.<br/><br/>Out smart, out shoot and out play your opponent in this fast-paced, high action card game.<br/><br/>Check out this game review from Father Geek!<br/><br/>Playing Wild Guns:<br/>Each player acts as a Wild West Gunslinger, with a Gunslinger character card placed face up in front of him, each with unique skills and abilities.<br/><br/>The game play of Wild Guns is quite simple. Each player has a hand of Gun cards and Run cards. In a two player game each player starts with six Gun cards and six Run cards. During the game the players place one Gun card and one Run card facedown in front of him. The other player does the same. When both players have their cards facedown on the table the player with First Shot reveals his Gun card, while is opponent reveals his Run card. Then compare the cards to ensure a shot can be made. If player A reveals a Head Shot Gun Card and Player B Reveals a Crouch Run Card - the attack from player A cannot be made, the Run card avoids his shot. The play proceeds to player B as he reveals his Gun card to compare to player A's Run card. If player B reveals a Chest Shot Gun Card and player A reveals a Jump Run Card, he jumps into the shot! Player B gets to make a shot and rolls the dice, as indicated on the Gun card.<br/><br/>After rolling he compares the numbers rolled his Gunslinger card and dishes out the damage to player A!<br/><br/>Play continues until one or both Gunslingers are dead, with zero health left! The goal of Wild Guns is to be the last Gunslinger standing.<br/><br/>Looking for a party game? Wild Guns is a great party game and can play with up to ten players. Watch out, this is when the bullets fly and the Gunslingers drop dead!<br/><br/>"}, "122690": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1537370.jpg", "is_expanded_by": {"133997": {"name": "Star Trek Deck Building Game: Data Promo"}}, "poll": {}, "boardgamedesigner": {"48618": {"name": "Alex Bykov"}}, "statistics": {}, "yearpublished": "2012", "maxplayers": "4", "boardgameartist": {"43191": "Jak L.

Venus &amp; Braves includes both a single player mode and multiplayer PlayStation Network battles. The game's plot revolves around an immortal warrior named Blood Boall who is sent by a goddess to save the world from destruction in a hundred years' time. The story itself takes place during the ensuing century and beyond.<br/><br/>Venus &amp; Braves uses a &quot;Rotation Battle System&quot; in which seven characters are placed on a 4 block by 3 block isometric grid, and fight enemies in a similar pattern on the opposite grid. The abilities of characters are geared towards different rows; some may attack from the back row, while others may heal ally characters in the same row. Battle takes place automatically, with the player deciding whether to send the front row to the back at the end of the turn, thus &quot;rotating&quot; the field. As the field is rotated, the second row is sent to the front lines, and so on.

It is the sequel to the 1999 PlayStation game Vib-Ribbon, released in Japan in 2004, but never published in any other markets.  Vib-Ripple is notable for allowing the player to import photographs to be used as the game's playing field.<br/><br/>The player takes control of Vibri, the simple, vector-shaped rabbit from the game's predecessor Vib-Ribbon. The game puts the player on top of various photographs, using each one as trampoline. Jumping on a photograph loosens up 2D items called &quot;Peta Characters,&quot; which Vibri must collect before a time limit expires. An icon on the left side of the screen gives the player a hint as to what part of the photograph to jump on to find the item; the icon's color, shape, and size corresponds to a certain combination of the three on the photograph. When Vibri is close enough to the item, a drumming sound is made and the controller vibrates. Other than the time limit, Vibri must avoid creatures called &quot;Boonchies&quot; that inhabit the surface of the picture. Coming in contact with a Boonchie will cause Vibri to de-evolve from a rabbit, to a frog, to a worm, and eventually causing a game over. However, it is possible for Vibri to evolve into a form called &quot;Super Vibri,&quot; allowing the player to temporarily disable a Boonchie, as well as see hidden Peta Characters.<br/><br/>Vib-Ripple has 60 default photographs. The player can create their own stages by uploading his or her own photographs from a digital camera or cellphone via the PlayStation 2's USB port, or even send pictures across the system's online network. The game automatically scales photographs down to 200 by 200 pixels.<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;Vib-Ripple&quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "122760": {"statistics": {}, "name": "Virtua Cop: Elite Edition", "videogamemode": {"2422": "Local Multiplayer"}, "videogameversion": {"160685": "English/European PlayStation 2 edition"}, "average": "0", "videogameseries": {"5494": "Virtua Cop"}, "videogametheme": {"2280": "Crime"}, "usersrated": "0", "videogamegenre": {"2160": "First Person Shooter"}, "videogameplatform": {"4434": "PlayStation 2"}, "poll": {}, "description": "Vietcong is a 2003 tactical first-person shooter video game Virtua Cop: Elite Edition is a compilation/deluxe edition of two light gun games by Sega for the PlayStation 2.

A notable change is the &quot;random event&quot; engine in the game, which creates random hazards which the player must navigate as they drive the course. These random events can be anything from rockfalls from cliffs above, animals on the track or even rivers or pipes spilling water on the road surface, making it slippery. However, some random events are an advantage to the player - other (AI) drivers are on the course (although this is rare as this is not a common occurrence in the real WRC), and the player can pass them (thus beating them on the course). Also, the co-driver keeps players updated on other cars, and occasionally other cars crash and retire from the rally (players can often spot wrecked or overturned cars at the trackside, complete with co-drivers warning oncoming cars).<br/><br/>WRC: Rally Evolved also features new sets of cars, including &quot;Historic&quot; vehicles, essentially the highly-tuned Group B rally cars including the Ford RS200, the Renault 5 Turbo and the Peugeot 205 T16.<br/><br/>WRC: Rally Evolved includes several different game modes.<br/><br/>In a quick race mode, the player will play a randomly selected stage with a randomly selected car and driver.  In time target mode, the player will have to beat a time trial (although this is not needed to advance in the game). The time target will be the in-game time at the first attempt. If beaten, the time target will be the personal best with a specific car class.  The Championship mode lets the player play through the 2005 WRC season. The player can choose between a real life calendar, that follows the schedule for the 2005 WRC season, or a non-real life calendar, where the player can choose the countries to play in a wanted order. Championship mode ends when all 16 countries are played, but the player can stop playing after any country, because the game saves after each country is finished. The player can play all three stages in a country, but normally the player will have to buy the stage to play it in other modes.<br/><br/>In a single rally mode, the player will play all the three stages in a selected country.  Unlike the quick race, in a single stage the player will play one stage of own choice. The player can also select car and driver.  In rally cross, the player will play against three AI generated opponents in a SSX course from any of the countries. The goal is to finish first in a circular track with all classes of cars.  In historical challenge, the player have to race on a small part of a stage to beat a specific time. The player will have to choose between six cars and race first for bronze, then silver and gold.<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;WRC: Rally Evolved&quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "122771": {"statistics": {}, "name": "WWE SmackDown vs. Raw 2011", "videogamemode": {"2422": "Local Multiplayer"}, "videogameversion": {"160709": "Australian PlayStation 2 edition"}, "average": "6.5", "videogameseries": {"5229": "WWE SmackDown vs. Raw"}, "videogametheme": {"2375": "Sports - Wrestling"}, "videogamefranchise": {"4843": "WWE Wrestling"}, "videogamegenre": {"2157": "Sports"}, "videogameplatform": {"4434": "PlayStation 2"}, "usersrated": "4", "poll": {}, "description": "WWE SmackDown vs. Raw 2011 (also shortened to WWE SvR 2011) is is the seventh game in the WWE SmackDown vs. Raw series and the final game under the SmackDown vs. Raw name, with future installments simply being named WWE.

Many of the major and minor characters from the show make appearances, including Skinner, Kersh, The Lone Gunmen, Krycek, Marita Covarrubias and the Cigarette Smoking Man.<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;The X-Files: Resist or Serve&quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "122774": {"statistics": {}, "name": "X-treme Express", "videogamemode": {"2422": "Local Multiplayer"}, "videogameversion": {"160738": "English/European PlayStation 2 edition"}, "average": "0", "videogametheme": {"2473": "Commercial / Public Transport"}, "usersrated": "0", "videogamegenre": {"2154": "Racing"}, "videogameplatform": {"4434": "PlayStation 2"}, "poll": {}, "description": "X-treme Express is about racing trains, which vary from North America, Europe and other parts of the world.<br/><br/>The goal in Grand prix mode is to get to the finish line first although on each track you race to the end and then back in 2 different races.

It is being followed by a new game for modern consoles and PC tentatively titled Y!F Lifestyle.<br/><br/>In the program, a digital aerobics instructor named Maya (voiced by Yumi Lee) serves as the player's guide. Maya leads the player through a series of exercises that is specially tailored to the player's current health and specifics. This is achieved by dynamically tracking their progress on an ongoing profile using the hard drive (or the PS2's memory card), setting up a schedule to be followed, and Maya making suggestions to the player using computations being made by the program. Maya leads the exercises in a variety of locations and accompanied by music from several music genres, all of which are selected before the workout by the player, and more of which can be unlocked by keeping to the schedule.<br/><br/>The game includes over 500 types of exercises, although some exercises with multiple directions or emphases are counted as separate in this tally. Furthermore, if the player owns an exercise ball, hand weights, an exercise step, or a heart rate monitor, Maya can incorporate these into the program.

In 1996, Falcom released a second version of the game for the Super Famicom with a higher difficulty level, known as Ys V Expert.

However, the combat system has been changed again; the player now must press a button to swing Adol's sword and attack enemies. Adol is also given the ability to jump and defend with his shield in Ys V.  A new magic system is introduced in Ys V as well, which requires the player to charge up spells by holding a button before they can be cast.<br/><br/>The soundtrack to Ys V was composed by Falcom's Sound Team JDK.

The game covers the Dark Tournament story arc in which Yusuke and his allies are invited by a powerful demon named Toguro to participate in a deadly martial arts tournament.<br/><br/>Dark Tournament is a 3D versus fighting game where the player progresses by completing specific objectives tied to a combat system. These objectives range from following simple commands to full-out battles with opponent characters. Each unique character can utilize a number of basic moves as well stronger &ldquo;spirit&rdquo; attacks. Dark Tournament was developed by Digital Fiction and published by Atari in North America and Europe as part of a distribution deal for the latter. Both the animation company Studio Pierrot and English licensor Funimation had limited involvement in the game&rsquo;s production.<br/><br/>As a fighting game, a large majority of Dark Tournament relies on its combat system. The player is able to move within a straight line on a 3D arena. The purpose of each battle is to deplete an opponent&rsquo;s health while maintaining one&rsquo;s own, although a participant may win by forcing an opponent out of the ring. Each of the game&rsquo;s 25 player characters has a specific set of basic punches, kicks, blocks, throws, and combo moves. In addition, characters have access to powerful &ldquo;spirit&rdquo; attacks once a meter located below one's health fills to capacity. This meter fills as opponents exchange hits with each other. Dark Tournament features a story mode which is divided into 31 chapters, progressing linearly through the plot of the manga and anime. The mode features different objectives relating to the narrative. For instance, one chapter requires the player to trade blows with the drunken master Chu in a match that restricts either character from moving or dodging. Other chapters allow the player to use multiple characters in battle using a tag team system.<br/><br/>Other, optional gameplay modes include a training mode for learning each character&rsquo;s moves; an arcade mode, where the player fights through a series of chosen opponents; a multiplayer Skirmish mode; and a token minigame, which plays like a modified version of the card game War.   Initially, only five characters (Yusuke, Kuwabara, Kurama, Hiei, and The Masked Fighter) are playable in these modes. However, as the player advances through the story mode, other characters are added to playable roster, alternate costumes are made available, more tokens can be used in the token game, and two extra modes (Survival and Dark Tournament Plus) are unlocked.<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;Yu Yu Hakusho: Dark Tournament&quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "122787": {"rpgitemversion": {"160761": "Paper Version"}, "poll": {}, "name": "The Paladin", "rpgproducer": {"3": "(Uncredited)"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1273302.png", "usersrated": "0", "average": "0", "statistics": {}, "rpg": {"11105": "Dungeon World"}, "rpgcategory": {"2108": "Sourcebook (rules/options to enhance play)"}, "rpggenre": {"1013": "Fantasy (Sword & Sorcery)"}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1273302_t.png", "description": "User summary:<br/><br/>This includes a character sheet and rules summary for players of Dungeon World Basic using the Paladin character class.

Other items came about as the course of several campaigns progressed, and rules were needed for things which DragonQuest did not cover. Poor Brendan&rsquo;s Almanac was developed out of a set of in-house rules and modifications to DragonQuest (2nd Edition) used in several campaigns going back as far as 1981. Although it has existed in a fairly fixed form for nearly 10 years, it is only relatively recently that a reasonable means of distributing it (namely the Internet) has been broadly available.<br/><br/>The DragonQuest community on the Internet has developed into a small but devoted core of players and GMs. This supplement is dedicated to all of you who have contributed to the DragonQuest Newsletter, or written to WebRPG or the dqn-list or one of the other DragonQuest discussion forums or newsgroups. Your presence and continued support for DragonQuest makes it worthwhile to produce this project. Some material in this supplement has been previously distributed through the DragonQuest Newsletter.<br/><br/>Two versions of Poor Brendan&rsquo;s Almanac will be available. This one is a smaller file with lower-resolution images. A second file with higher resolution images (suitable for making a laser printed copy of the book) will also be produced. Both files are machine-readable with Adobe Acrobat software.

Clash! Strongest Demons) is a fighting game released on the PlayStation 2. The original Japanese version was published by Bandai at the end of 2005, after merging with Namco but before the formation of Namco Bandai Games. The subsequent international releases and the GameCube versions were published under Namco Bandai Games. The game is based on the Zatch Bell! anime franchise.<br/><br/>Story Mode: Play is done over the course of 40 levels consisting of different opponents. Often special conditions will need to be met, such as defeating an opponent with Bao Zakeruga. Note that this does not necessarily mean that the opponent be at minimum health. In addition to the regular Story Mode there is a series of mini games which are consolidated into &quot;Zatch's Diary&quot;. These follow every day situations in Zatch's life. Previously played levels can be reselected either to improve rating or on higher difficulties.<br/><br/>Arcade Mode: Choose a character and fight against eight opponents. Once completed, a special cut-scene for the chosen character will play that contains dialogue between the mamodo and his or her partner. After the scene concludes you will see the statistics of all eight matches. These statistics determine the chance of the mamodo becoming King. To receive a 100% rating, all matches must be one with an &quot;A&quot; rating.<br/><br/>VS. Mode: This is a traditional one-on-one battle. Choose any character and stage and begin fighting immediately. Play can either be against CPU opponents or other people via two controllers. A ranking up system is also available. Stats for individual characters can be upgraded by the obtaining of &quot;Mamodo Points&quot;, which are distributed after the conclusion of a match. The amount of points given is based on the aforementioned ranking system, with &quot;A&quot; being the best and &quot;E&quot; being the worst.<br/><br/>4P Battle: Meant as more of a party mode, the 4P battles are in the form of mini games. These include &quot;Burn the Spell Book&quot;, which has each player try to kick another's spell book into a small campfire, among others.<br/><br/>Mini-Games: This game mode contains seven mini games where certain goals must be completed. One level requires you to find 30 lollipops and give them to Kanchome within 80 seconds.<br/><br/>Gallery: The Gallery is split into several subtypes: the Model Gallery, which shows all the character models used in the game along with a short description of each; Visual Gallery, which has all the cut scenes from the Story Mode; Stage Gallery, which lets the player control Suzy Mizuno and roam freely along the multiplayer stages; and the Sound Gallery, which contains all the music from the game.<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;Zatch Bell!

You will have to be clever to estimate the number of outlaws needed to attack &ndash; and watch out for the Sheriff and your opponents!<br/><br/>The game is played in rounds. Each round, players bid on the right to perform the next bank robbery by placing a number of outlaws in the center of the playing area; each player starts with eight outlaws. Alternatively a player can skip the round or postpone an attack until after other players bid, but doing so will cause one or more of his outlaws to become wounded. When a player bids outlaws, the sheriff token moves a number of city tiles equal to the number of outlaws bid (in most cases). If a sheriff lands on a player's Chief of the Outlaws token &ndash; as these tokens are located on city tiles and not used for bidding &ndash; one of that player's outlaws is wounded.<br/><br/>The winner of the bid attacks a city, most likely netting him gold and possibly giving him new outlaws (as they are freed from that city's prison), but which city is attacked is determined by the difference between the winning bid and the lowest bid. Thus, bids from the other players will influence the winner's gains &ndash; and if the winner lands on the city tile where the sheriff is located, he gets nothing. The player with the second highest bid attacks the stagecoach and gains one silver.<br/><br/>If a player claims something from a city tile, it's flipped over and now has a different power for the remainder of the game, allowing a player who lands on the tile to steal gold or silver cubes from an opponent or wounding one of that player's outlaws. After each round, players collect the outlaws they used to bid and &quot;wound&quot; the healthy outlaws by flipping them over to their wounded side. A wounded outlaw who is wounded again is removed from the game. (Prisoners come into the game wounded, so they can be used only once.)<br/><br/>The game ends when no player has any outlaws remaining or all players refuse to bid in a given round.
