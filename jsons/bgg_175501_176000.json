Its mission was to investigate Tunnicliffe, a rogue neutron star that was travelling past Sol. To accomplish this trick, it was equipped with an experimental star drive which would allow it to break the light barrier.<br/><br/>NFH Bulbar was escorted to Saturn&rsquo;s orbit, activated its drive, and streaked into the inky-black cosmos. The groundbreaking technology of the star drive promised to bring the ship back in three short months.<br/><br/>The star drive did not deliver on said promise.<br/><br/>Two weeks ago, however, a new point of light appeared outside the orbit of Saturn. NFH Bulbar is terribly late, but it has finally arrived. Of course, it finds a solar system drastically changed, teetering on the brink of starvation and civilization-wide collapse. And as one might expect, not all is well on board, either&hellip;<br/><br/>NFH Bulbar is a level five derelict written for five players. As with any other derelict, the level is trivial to shift up or down. To make a derelict a higher level, add dice and squares to damage tracks; to lower the level, remove them. Exactly how many to add or remove can be found in the NPC R&uuml;l in R&uuml;ls of the Void.<br/><br/>"}, "175505": {"boardgamedesigner": {"81500": {"name": "Nicklas Westin"}}, "average": "3", "poll": {}, "name": "Havets konung", "playingtime": "15", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": {"2047": "Memory"}, "yearpublished": "2012", "usersrated": "1", "maxplayers": "6", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2466647_t.jpg", "boardgameartist": {"61596": "Mats Minnhagen"}, "statistics": {}, "boardgamepublisher": {"29481": {"name": "Ferrytail AB"}}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2466647.jpg", "boardgameversion": {"270009": "First edition"}, "maxplaytime": "0", "boardgamecategory": {"1089": {"name": "Animals"}}, "age": "6", "minplaytime": "15", "description": "- En kappsegling runt Gotland (A race around Gotland).<br/><br/>The players competing in a race around the Island Gotland in the Baltic sea.

Twenty years later, a former Parker Brothers employee gave a prototype of the game to the operator of the AtariAge website. Surprisingly, the game was quite complex and seemed to be complete.<br/><br/>The game essentially recreates the action from Book 1 in The Lord of the Rings novel. You play the roll of Frodo Baggins trying to safely journey from Hobbiton to Rivendell while being relentlessly pursued by Dark Riders. You may use the ring to hide from spying birds but this also speeds up your pursuers. You may also meet several characters from the book including Sam Gamgee, Strider and Gandalf, along with the usually neglected characters of Tom Bombadil and Glorfindel who all give you special powers to aid you in your flight.<br/><br/>"}, "175514": {"statistics": {}, "name": "Magical Maiden Madison", "videogamemode": {"2149": "Single-Player"}, "videogameversion": {"270030": "Web Browser edition"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3331132.jpg", "videogametheme": {"2278": "Anime"}, "usersrated": "0", "average": "0", "videogamegenre": {"2713": "Visual Novel"}, "videogameplatform": {"5084": "Web Browser"}, "poll": {}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3331132_t.jpg", "description": "User Summary<br/><br/>A Twine visual novel parodying magical girl anime such as Sailor Moon.<br/><br/>"}, "175515": {"statistics": {}, "name": "Even Cowgirls Bleed", "videogamemode": {"2149": "Single-Player"}, "videogameversion": {"270031": "Web Browser edition"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3331128.jpg", "videogametheme": {"2267": "Western"}, "usersrated": "0", "average": "0", "videogamegenre": {"2506": "Light Gun Shooter"}, "videogameplatform": {"5084": "Web Browser"}, "poll": {}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3331128_t.jpg", "description": "User Summary<br/><br/>A text adventure about heartbreak in the West... with shooting gallery sections.<br/><br/>"}, "175516": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2829035.jpg", "is_expanded_by": {"225433": {"name": "MoonQuake Escape: Access Card"}}, "poll": {}, "boardgamedesigner": {"73482": {"name": "Jeff Johnston (II)"}}, "statistics": {}, "yearpublished": "2016", "maxplayers": "6", "boardgameartist": {"77510": "Michael Parla"}, "boardgamepublisher": {"29082": {"name": "Breaking Games"}}, "maxplaytime": "60", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2829035_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "45", "boardgamecategory": {"1023": {"name": "Bluffing"}}, "description": "HOOK: The movies Alien and Escape from Alcatraz meet 3-Card Monte meet the spin cycle of your washing machine!<br/>HOOK: Only the player with the best Plan B will Escape because Plan A never survives the MoonQuake!<br/><br/>In MoonQuake Escape, get ready to face the challenges of the spinning, changing 3D surface of the doomed prison planet of Zartaclaton.

The truth is concealed for the sake of mortal minds. The unendurable reality that boils behind the stars is veiled by the pleasant blindness that human sanity requires. Yet every comforting shroud must fall in time, and for these investigators, that time is now.<br/><br/>Silent Legions is a game of modern-day Lovecraftian horror, one carefully designed to support sandbox adventures by hard-bitten investigators and fearless hunters of the dark. Its clean, lightweight old-school rules are compatible with the free Stars Without Number sci-fi game and give both GM and players a steady framework for plumbing the unspeakable secrets of the eldritch night. Now, after a successful Kickstarter with more than 1,100 backers, a Kickstarter completed a month early, this tome of dark secrets can be yours.<br/><br/>Silent Legions isn't just about traditional Yog-Sothothery. Silent Legions is a creation kit, a toolbox in the Sine Nomine style for creating your own Mythos, with all-new deities, alien entities, foul magics, accursed artifacts, unaussprechlichen kulten, and diabolical dream-worlds to bedevil your players. These tools are system-neutral, so even fans of other Lovecraftian gaming systems can scoop them up to add a splash of fresh horror to their more familiar tentacular abominations.<br/><br/>Not only that, but Silent Legions is built to help the GM create investigative adventures with minimal strain. Within these pages you'll find a modular set of templates and adventure guides that help you snap together an evening's intrepid investigation and fit it neatly into your campaign setting. Like the Mythos creation tools, these guides are system-neutral and can be exported for any occasion when you need something wicked to this way come.<br/><br/>So seize now upon this opportunity! Plunder this vault of forgotten lore. Grasp these dark tools of creation and wield their power to fashion your own nightmarish reality. Perhaps none dare name the things that await your animating will, but soon enough the world will know them well&hellip;.<br/><br/>"}, "175549": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2464282.jpg", "poll": {}, "boardgamedesigner": {"81535": {"name": "Travis Hancock"}}, "statistics": {}, "yearpublished": "2015", "maxplayers": "12", "boardgameartist": {"98151": "Sarah Keele"}, "boardgamepublisher": {"1001": {"name": "(Web published)"}}, "maxplaytime": "35", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2464282_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "25", "boardgamecategory": {"1023": {"name": "Bluffing"}}, "description": "Accuse and defend your fellow townsfolk as you hunt down the witches of Salem. Act fast, before conspiracy turns you against your own.<br/><br/>The year is 1692, and it is a perilous time to live in the town of Salem, Massachusetts. One wrong step, or one misplaced accusation, and you could be the next witch to hang. &quot;Salem&quot; takes players into this perilous world and lets them re-live the tension, politics, and religious extremism that still has people talking about it 300 years later.<br/><br/>The game is packaged in a faux book box that closes magnetically. The game, disguised as a worn out leather book, can easily hide on your bookshelf and masquerade as an antique.<br/><br/>Players can play as prominent villagers from the old Salem town, and even read their bios in the instruction manual. The servant girl Mary Warren, pastor Samuel Parris, farmer John Proctor, storyteller Tituba, and beggar Sarah Good are some of the 12 characters featured in the game.<br/><br/>Players, each acting as one of these unique characters, are given 3-5 Tryal cards (depending on the number of players). These Tryal cards reveal the true identity of each player, &quot;Witch&quot; or &quot;Not a Witch.&quot;<br/><br/>During gameplay, players gather cards that they use to accuse, or defend, other players. Deciding who to trust is key to survival, since you can never play a card on yourself. When you suspect someone to be a witch, you can begin accusing them with red accusation cards. When enough accusations have been placed on one of the players, the player who lays the final accusation chooses one of that player's Tryal cards to reveal. Once all &quot;Witch&quot; Tryal cards have been found, the villagers of Salem win.<br/><br/>Players can also use green and blue cards such as &quot;Alibi&quot;, &quot;Stocks&quot;, &quot;Matchmaker&quot;, &quot;Asylum&quot;, and &quot;Scapegoat&quot; to help or hurt their allies or enemies.<br/><br/>As players draw cards, they will eventually draw black cards that take immediate effect. One black card, &quot;Night&quot;, forces all players to close their eyes while the Witches choose someone to eliminate, the Constable chooses someone to potentially save, and the Spy chooses a Tryal card to look at. The other black card, &quot;Conspiracy,&quot; forces all players to take a face-down Tryal card from the player to their left. Killing witches quickly is essential, otherwise &quot;Conspiracy&quot; may soon have the whole town turned evil.<br/><br/>Before long, accusations will be flying, and screams of &quot;She's a WITCH!&quot; will wake the neighbours. Will you be the hero who purges your town of witches, or will you be wrongly accused and hung for witchcraft? Or perhaps you will be a witch yourself, escape conviction, and bring Salem to the ground.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "4", "boardgameversion": {"270107": "English first edition"}, "average": "6.98626", "name": "Salem", "playingtime": "35", "boardgamemechanic": {"2040": "Hand Management"}, "age": "12", "usersrated": "425", "boardgamesubdomain": {"5498": "Party Games"}, "boardgamefamily": {"8374": "Crowdfunding: Kickstarter"}}, "175550": {"rpg": {"25511": "Atlantis: The Second Age (2nd Edition)"}, "statistics": {}, "name": "Atlantis: Hero's Guide", "rpgproducer": {"15261": "Jerry Grayson"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2464354.jpg", "usersrated": "0", "rpgitemversion": {"270144": "PDF version"}, "average": "0", "rpgissuearticle": {"151564": "New Releases June 2014"}, "rpggenre": {"1013": "Fantasy (Sword & Sorcery)"}, "rpgcategory": {"2108": "Sourcebook (rules/options to enhance play)"}, "poll": {}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2464354_t.jpg", "description": "Publisher Blurb:<br/><br/>The heroes of the ATLANTIS: The Second Age RPG are evocative and varied and many character combinations exist.

The game is set in a mythical Chinese world like that of the Chinese classic &quot;Investiture of the Gods&quot;. The game world is further fleshed out in other Magical Legend comics and novels.<br/><br/>There are 2 game modes.<br/><br/>Game Mode 1 (Deities vs Demons): <br/>Gameplay-wise this is similar to Bang. There are 3 roles (Deity, Demons, Spirits). The Deity wins if he kills all Demons and non-subjugated Spirits. The Demons win if they kill the Deity. The Spirits win if they kill the Deity and 1 Demon or 1 Spirit who has killed a Demon. The Deity has 3 power up cards which he can offer as a reward to subjugate(ie. ally) a Spirit. Spirits can renege on the alliance/subjugation but will suffer penalties for doing so. The game replaces the suits (Heart, Spades, etc) of Bang with a 5-element system (Metal, Wood, Water, Fire, Earth) and characters, abilities and card actions vary depending on the elements involved. There is no concept of Distance and no Missed cards. Attacks succeed or are countered based on the elements. Card actions often require Magic points to power them. Otherwise the gameplay is quite similar.<br/><br/>Game Mode 2 (Faction Battles):<br/>This mode can only be played with an even number of players (4-10).

Make villagers fall in love, turn them into frogs, or teleport them to different locations. Use your familiars to gather ingredients and cast spells on the villagers to achieve goals and score victory points as you vie to be named the village crone.<br/><br/>All the players are witches who have come upon a medieval village without a crone. They send out familiars to gather ingredients they can use in spells to complete Witch's Scheme cards. Each of the cards is worth 1, 2, or 3 points, which also indicates how difficult the scheme is to complete. The witch who scores 13 points wins.<br/><br/>The village consists of 6 location game boards: village green, lord's manor, farm, mill, forge, and tithe barn. The locations are modular and can be placed in any order or configuration as long as the gridlines line up. (The easiest way to play is with a 3x2 retangular configuration.)<br/><br/>The villagers, who are the most frequent targets of the Witch's Schemes, have starting locations. The peasant begins in the village green, the lord in the lord's manor, the farmer in the farm, the miller in the mill, the blacksmith in the forge, and the priest in the tithe barn.<br/><br/>The ingredients can be found at 4 of the 6 locations. Silver is in the lord's manor, soil in the farm, flour in the mill, and fire in the forge. There are also 3 eye of newt cards in each stack of ingredients and can be used as wild cards in spells.<br/><br/>At the beginning of the game, each player is dealt 1 of each of the 3 levels of Witch's Scheme cards. Consulting their Books of Spells (which are the same for each witch) to determine which ingredients will be needed to cast the spells on their Witch's Scheme cards, they put 1 familiar in the village green, take turns placing 2 additional familiars in other locations, and draw 2 ingredients from those locations.<br/><br/>The first step in the order of play is to tithe. As soon as each player knows which ingredient they will sacrifice, they place it facedown in the tithe barn. This seeds the tithe barn with ingredients that can be gleaned with the Fortune spell (which allows a player to draw any 3 ingredients from the tithe barn). However, any player who placed a familiar in the tithe barn does not have to tithe.<br/><br/>Then, in turn order, players may move their own familiars and/or villagers and cast spells. (Spells may be cast for strategic or tactical purposes as well as to complete Witch's Schemes.) The movement is limited to a total of 6 spaces, and the number of spells is limited only by the ingredients the player has. The movement and spellcasting can be in any order on a player's turn. A player can even intersperse movement and spellcasting. If a player completes a Witch's Scheme, the card is turned over so that the other players can clearly see how many points that player has. After he/she is finished moving and casting spells, he/she draws 1 of each of the 3 levels of cards, reads them, and decides which one(s) to add to his/her hand as replacements.<br/><br/>When all players have finished moving and casting spells, the players harvest 2 ingredients for each familiar in a location, and the broom (which indicates the first player) is moved clockwise.<br/><br/>The spells are Conjuring (to add up to 2 more familiars into play), Love (to join the fates of 2 villagers, meaning spells cast on one affect the other and movement of one moves the other), Transformation (to turn a villager into a frog or vice versa), Binding (to lock a location down and prevent anyone or anything from entering or leaving a location), Switching (to change the place of 2 familiars and/or villagers), Summoning (to cause a villager to move to a location containing one of the player's familiars), Fortune (to allow a player to draw any 3 ingredients from the tithe barn), and Protection (to block a spell cast by another player). 1 silver can also be used to complete a Scheme out of turn or to discard and draw a new Witch's Scheme card. Each spell requires not only ingredients but also an incantation, which is provided in the Book of Spells. Alternatively, players can make up their own incantations. If a player is caught trying to complete a spell without speaking the incantation, the spell does not work.<br/><br/>Each witch has access to the same number of starting familiars, the same ingredients, the same spells, and 3 Schemes of the same level. But the witch who most cleverly uses these resources to reach 13 points is named the village crone.<br/><br/>The Village Crone also includes rules for solitaire play.<br/><br/>"}, "175593": {"average": "0", "poll": {}, "name": "Whirly's World", "playingtime": "30", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": {"2035": "Roll / Spin and Move"}, "yearpublished": "2015", "usersrated": "0", "maxplayers": "6", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3153414_t.jpg", "boardgameartist": {"11478": "Alvin Madden"}, "statistics": {}, "boardgamepublisher": {"3491": {"name": "SimplyFun"}}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3153414.jpg", "boardgameversion": {"270173": "First Edition"}, "maxplaytime": "30", "boardgamecategory": {"1041": {"name": "Children's Game"}}, "age": "6", "minplaytime": "15", "description": "Glide along the trail rolling dice, completing odd &amp; even cards &amp; gathering Whirly tokens.

Can the Prussian rear guard under Hohenlohe hold off Napoleon's Grand Arm&eacute;e long enough at Jean to allow Brunswick's main body to crush Davout's lone French corps under which blocks their path to safety, or will the &quot;Iron Marshal's&quot; veteran 3rd Corps stand firm against three times their numbers and seal the Prussian's doom?

(These three Themes stick with the player throughout the game. Many but not all of the Themes have a manga/anime/Japanese flavor.) Then each player chooses a title and &quot;pen name.&quot;<br/><br/>After players have had a few minutes to brainstorm, the five-minute timer is activated and core gameplay begins. Players have five minutes to draw their comics (on pre-printed Comic Pages) and express their Themes. When time is up, each player takes a turn reading their comic to the group (or, in the suggested 'professional mode,' the other players read the player's manga amongst themselves without the artist being allowed to give explanation). Based on the other players' judgement, each player earns 2 Fame Tokens for following each of the three core rules: (1) express your Themes (2) use 3 or fewer Word Balloons and (3) draw something recognizable in every Panel.<br/><br/>Beginning with round 2, Trend Cards appear, putting more Fame in play. Trend cards (examples: Science Fiction, Fantasy, Shojo Manga, Sports, Destruction, Subtlety, etc.) provide new victory conditions in the form of instructions and a corresponding reward of Fame Tokens.

Players take control of a 7 metre tall walking vehicle called an Ironcast. They must face off against an invading force of enemy Ironcast in order to defend 1880's Victorian England.<br/><br/>Battles are fought by generating resource nodes which in turn drive the Ironcast's various weapons and systems. Players must choose how to spend these nodes wisely, either offensively in order to cripple and destroy their opponents, or defensively, if they suspect a barrage of incoming weapons fire is due.<br/><br/>Turn based strategy combat set against a rich and interesting alternate 1880's history.<br/><br/>Roguelike campaign mode where death is permanent but with persistent rewards from one game session to the next.

It stops when a player has 7 tiles in its dolmen.<br/><br/>In a turn, players will either move their korrigan AND watch a slab OR try to add a tile to their dolmen AND watch a slab<br/><br/>A korrigan moves from 0 to 3 (without rolling the dice) on the light points around the circle in any direction.<br/><br/>Each tile has a colored light on two of its sides. Arranged on the circle early in the game, the face of each slab has points (2 to 6). These will serve as the final countdown to determine the winner.<br/><br/>To add a stone to the dolmen, the korrigan must be in front of it and one of the colored sides of the stone must be the same color as the ends of the dolmen.<br/><br/>The player rolls the dice and if the result is more than the score of the slab, it can be placed by matching lights. <br/>If the dice score is not enough, you need to consume power points symbolized by colored gems and give the difference on the stone table of the fairy.<br/><br/>To recover its power points, the player must go see the fairy. This will also take the opportunity to replace the stones around the circle.<br/><br/>As soon as a dolmen is finished, each player counts his points (even those with incomplete dolmen) and adds the unused points of powers. The winner is the one with the highest score.<br/><br/>Warning, this is not necessarily the fastest who is the winner ...<br/><br/>"}, "175650": {"statistics": {}, "name": "Dragon Age: Inquisition \u2013 Jaws of Hakkon", "videogamemode": {"2149": "Single-Player"}, "videogameversion": {"270259": "PSN PlayStation 3 Downloadable edition"}, "average": "7.71429", "videogameseries": {"9919": "Dragon Age"}, "videogametheme": {"2148": "Fantasy"}, "videogamegenre": {"2155": "RPG"}, "videogameexpansion": {"120241": "Dragon Age: Inquisition"}, "videogamefranchise": {"10496": "Dragon Age"}, "videogameplatform": {"4435": "PlayStation 3"}, "usersrated": "7", "poll": {}, "description": "User Summary<br/><br/>Jaws of Hakkon adds a new side story, a beautiful new area, new challenges, enemies, and items.<br/><br/>"}, "175651": {"boardgamedesigner": {"8": {"name": "Richard Ulrich"}}, "poll": {}, "name": "Heavy Hippos", "playingtime": "20", "minplayers": "1", "boardgamemechanic": {"2023": "Co-operative Play"}, "yearpublished": "2014", "usersrated": "0", "boardgamefamily": {"11627": "Animals: Hippopotamus"}, "maxplayers": "4", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3153398_t.jpg", "average": "0", "statistics": {}, "boardgamepublisher": {"3483": {"name": "Beleduc"}}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3153398.jpg", "boardgameversion": {"270262": "First edition"}, "maxplaytime": "20", "boardgamecategory": {"1089": {"name": "Animals"}}, "age": "4", "minplaytime": "15", "description": "A cooperative children's game in which distinguishing the weight of objects is a central element.<br/><br/>Aim of the game: 6 wooden hippos (two light ones, two medium-weight ones, two heavy ones) have to be moved to the finishing spaces that correspond to their weights.

Together the players create a plot involving their characters, much like an ongoing television series or soap opera. Unlike reading a novel or watching a show, however, the players can actually change the course of the story. They are not spectators to the action; rather, the plot revolves around the characters they play.<br/><br/>The world of Ghastly Affair is characterized by monsters and madness, desperate love and implacable hate. Innocent damsels are imperiled by the desires of wicked men, while creatures of nightmare lurk in the dark corners of the world. Lovers are torn apart by twisted customs and pitiless laws. Dark castles hide the horrible secrets of ancient noble families. Obsessed men of science create abominable new forms of life. Brutal brigands lurk in dark forests. Grave robbers despoil churchyards for profit. Worst of all, the dead are said to walk by night, and certain men are cursed to wander the moors as wolves.<br/><br/>A character might engage in a forbidden romance with a brooding poet, battle an infestation of Vampyres in a lonely graveyard, or play cards with Death in a secluded coffeehouse. Characters could wield dark sorcery atop a bare mountain, sell their soul for wealth, or run from a forced marriage to the freedom of banditry. The game can feature as much thrilling action and dramatic role-playing as the players want.

I hear you ask, well in the game once you have reclaimed a park, it is used to produce food. You can spend food at the start of your turn to give 3 survivor 2 action points that turn making them &ldquo;well fed and ready for zombie carnage&rdquo; However you can actively farm a park tile, spending a survivors action point. <br/>This means that at the start of your next turn that farm produces 2 food instead of 1.<br/><br/>Ending the game!<br/><br/>The game can end in 4 ways: <br/>The research centre is reclaimed (the cure has been found and the outbreak is over) <br/>The military base is reclaimed (More guns than any one army could need, you are left with a city flooded with zombie soup) <br/>When a group of survivors has reclaimed and spends one turn actively farming 5 farms (who needs to worry about zombies when you have fresh veg and steak every day) <br/>Or finally if one player reaches 50 Victory points before any of the other conditions are met<br/><br/>However it is the player with the most Victory points that reigns king.

They are part magical hacker (modifying their spells on the fly with impromptu adjustments), part antimage, and part blaster.<br/>    Gnostic: A mathematical mage with multitude of multiplying effects on their magic. They practice a form of divine numerology to power their spells and modify their all-AoE spell list based on how many creatures they target. They have a small list of about a dozen spells that all have variable spell levels and are based on a fluctuating resource rather than a vancian system.<br/>    Godaiken: If you have played our &quot;tao&quot; this is it's elemental brother.

They are trained diplomats and peacekeepers, using their abilities to snuff the flames of war. They are masters of debilitating magic- able to drain or subdue creatures with either their diplomacy or their magic.<br/>    Worldshaper: A worldshaper is a magical artisan who is part of a masonic guild (though not as covert). They have the ability to manipulate materials like clay, animate objects (our playtest had a house try to coup de grace a t-rex), while still remaining a viable character.

Any number of players can conduct a campaign, in which each type of army has a different set of victory conditions. While holding off Rome's many enemies, the Roman players are also trying to defeat each other and ultimately become (and remain!) emperor.<br/><br/>The Persians are trying to carve away provinces in the east and add them to the Sassanian monarchy. The barbarians are trying to raid and carry away as much loot as possible while amassing glory from victorious battles over any sort of enemy, even one's own tribe. Every battle is therefore a balancing act, in which the military and political context is constantly shifting.<br/> Aurelian can be played with miniatures, or with &quot;unit tiles&quot; on any flat surface, much in the same manner as Bl&uuml;cher's unit cards. The centerpiece of the game is the campaign, in which each player manages the fortunes of his character and faction, much in the manner of the campaigns in Maurice and Longstreet. <br/> Unlike most Ancients games, which attempt to span the millennia from Moses to Columbus, Aurelian concentrates on a specific period of roughly 70 years. Players fight a series of nine battles against a variety of enemies, often from one's own side. The composition of their armies changes. Veteran Roman legionaries become incresingly scarce and irreplaceable as the Roman players cobble together vexillations and recruit barbarian foedorati and tributarii. Will the Persians squander their expensive elite cataphracts and elephant units in early battles, or hold them in reserve? Will a barbarian warlord play it safe and not raid as deeply into the empire, at the risk of not bringing back enough treasure and glory to maintain the loyalty of his optimates?<br/><br/>"}, "175744": {"boardgamedesigner": {"5426": {"name": "Sam A.

It is also &ndash; not coincidentally &ndash; the name of a subsector in that area. The two overlap, though the term &lsquo;Borderland&rsquo; is sometimes used in a wider context to refer to the general area surrounding the subsector of that name.<br/><br/>The Borderland is a region of great strategic significance lying between the border of the Third Imperium in Tobia subsector and the territory of the Aslan Hierate in Tlaiowaha subsector. One cluster of seven star systems (the Voidsedge Cluster) lies entirely within the Borderland subsector, whilst another (the Wildeman Cluster) of eight worlds lies on the border of the Borderland and Tobia subsectors. These two clusters of worlds make up the region normally referred to as the Borderland, whatever the star charts may say about which subsector they are in.<br/><br/>The Borderland is a buffer zone between the Imperium and the Aslan Hierate, with its own small local powers caught between the two big players. It is a region of rather vigorous local politics, in which a handful of relatively small starships can tip the balance of power. The sort of place where the crew of a beat-up old Free Trader can make a real difference&hellip; or meet an untimely end without anyone knowing what happened to them.<br/><br/>This book is an overview of the Borderland; its powers and polities, their agendas and their rivalries. Further supplements will detail the Wildeman and Voidsedge clusters and the surrounding systems, presenting a wealth of adventure opportunities in a &lsquo;small ship universe&rsquo; where a group of Travellers can rise to fame and fortune with a few good decisions, and lose it all just as quickly.<br/><br/>"}, "175841": {"rpgitemversion": {"270604": "PDF version"}, "poll": {}, "name": "Hangar Control", "rpgproducer": {"36704": "Steven J.

Each isometric square represents a tile. At the beginning of each level, a picture made up of sixteen tiles will be displayed to the player. The computer will then rearrange the tiles which make up the picture, and distribute some in other areas of the level. The player's task is to restore the picture to the way it looked at the beginning of the level. This is achieved by walking around the isometric world, picking up tiles, and placing them in the correct place. Throughout a level, warps must be found which allow the player to change from walking on the floor to walking on the walls. Each level has a time limit. If the time runs out, the player loses. When the picture is complete, the player progresses to the next level.<br/><br/>From level two onwards, chess pieces patrol the level.

In this game, where you can fight monsters as well as your opponents, and get a reward if you win the fight. At the end, when you are strong and equipped enough, you can dare to fight and beat the evil Dragon - which is menacing the world of Arcasam - before your opponents do. You will get better, stronger and more powerful each round, however your victory depends on the strategy you choose.<br/><br/>Setup<br/>There are 7 big hexes in the game - 1 center hex, which is the Dragon's den and 6 other hexes creating the terrain. The shape of the game board varies according to the number of players - it is versatile. This will guarantee that the game board will be always adequate - not too big, not too small.<br/><br/>Each hex contains 5 slots - you can place a castle, tavern, iron mine, tailor, tanner, orchard or monsters there. You can place them evenly or randomly. This factor contributes to the variability of the game as well.<br/><br/>Apart from the game board, each player has his own player board in front of him. He can mark his place a weapon there, place his companion card as well as mark his current attack, defence and health points. The last component is a main board, where players count the rounds and phases of the game.<br/><br/>Game Play Overview<br/>Each round,player has a fixed number of steps he can make (at the beginning it is 13) and during his turn, he can step on/pass through the following:<br/><br/><br/>    Empty spot: No action<br/>    Iron mine / Tailor / Tanner / Orchard: You will get the supply of iron / cloth / leather / food. Materials (iron, cloth and leather) are needed when you want to buy a weapon and upgrade your skill tree. Without weapon, you cannot fight the monsters and your opponents.<br/>    Monster: Once you step on this slot, you have to fight the particular monster. If  you win, you get a precious piece of gold along with the loot.<br/>    Castle: In the castle, you can buy weapons needed for the fights, or you can improve your skill tree.<br/>    Tavern: Each time you pass through the tavern, you have to draw 1 companion card, where you will find some kind of advantage. In the tavern, you can be also healed after the fight. (1 step = 1 life).<br/><br/><br/>If you encounter one of your opponents during your round and you both already have a weapon, you or him can choose to fight one another. The winner gets 8 materials from the backpack of the loser and the loser will have to get healed in the tavern.<br/><br/>So, you can fight either the monster or one of your opponents. The system of the monster fight is different than the system of the fight with your opponent. Weapons have different costs, however you always need to pay one piece of gold which you can get only if you beat the monster.<br/><br/>-Fight with your opponents<br/><br/>When one hero encounters another one, and both of them have a weapon, each of them can choose to start a fight. For 1 food they can always draw 2 action cards (they can be either attack or defense) but the maximum they can have in hand is 10.<br/><br/>Hero who chose to fight his opponent starts and plays an attack. The attacked has to have a defense card in order not to loose any lives. Then the other player (attacked) plays an attack and and the attacker has to play a defense. If one of the players does not have a defence card, he has to subtract certain number of lives, depending on the attack of the attacker and defense of the attacked. If one of the players has 0 lives, he lost the fight and has to give 8 materials from his backpack to his opponent. Then he has to get healed to the tavern.<br/><br/>-Fight with the monsters<br/><br/>Fight with the monster is much easier then the fight with other hero. Each monster has certain number of lives and strength of his attack, depending on the phase of the game. This is the only part of the game where player uses the dice. Depending on the number the player rolled on the dice and on the current phase of the game (1,2,3), monster attacks with a certain strength. The player has to play defence cards in order not to loose the fight. Then he has to play the attack cards to beat the monster, depending on number of lives the particular monster has, and on the weapon the hero has.  If the hero wins, he will take 1 gold and choose 1 loot, where he can find some kind of advantage.<br/><br/>The fight with the Dragon is the same as a fight with other monsters, but he is very strong, so the player has to be very well equiped and experienced.<br/><br/>"}, "175937": {"rpgitemversion": {"270813": "PDF version"}, "poll": {}, "name": "Imbued with Magic", "rpgproducer": {"81658": "Dan Coleman"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2479304.jpg", "usersrated": "0", "average": "0", "rpggenre": {"155": "Fantasy (High Fantasy)"}, "statistics": {}, "rpg": {"25418": "5e Game System Product (D&D 5th Edition Compatible)"}, "rpgcategory": {"2108": "Sourcebook (rules/options to enhance play)"}, "rpgseries": {"27122": "Dungeons On Demand"}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2479304_t.jpg", "description": "From publisher blurb:<br/><br/>Who doesn't want more magic items?<br/><br/>Inside are 15 new magic items to use in your 5th edition campaign.

A derelict world where you can experience true sci-fantasy gaming that allows you to fight skirmishes that focus on the cinematics and action of the genre without skimping on the tactics. It features:<br/><br/><br/>    ROGUE Die Mechanic<br/>    PAWN System<br/>    FX Phyisics Engine<br/>    Skill Based Combat<br/>    ENERGY Expenditure System<br/>    No labor intensive bookkeeping!<br/>    No measuring!<br/>    Custom point based force creation<br/>    Equipment and Upgrades<br/>    Sorcery and Psionics<br/>    Multiple game levels<br/>    Scenarios<br/><br/><br/>-Play Aids<br/><br/>INNOVATIVE SYSTEMS<br/>ROGUE DIE&trade; | The ROGUE DIE mechanic allows you to counteract your enemies&rsquo; actions during their turns and fuels your powered weapon, powered armor, and psionic force weapon abilities and effects. Counter-actions include things like: dodging, returning ranged fire, counter casting, and intercept maneuvers.<br/><br/>PAWN SYSTEM&trade; | The innovative PAWN system provides a unique mechanism for representing your leader&rsquo;s retinue and followers and makes for dynamically changing battles as your hero loses abilities, power, and support during a game. PAWNS are also a prime feature of the campaign system and allow a leader to gain new abilities, change strategies, and evolve as a adventure progresses.<br/><br/>Pawns include: ammo grunts, bots, expendables, familiars, intimidators, and brutes [and many more!]. Who will follow you into battle?<br/><br/>FX | The FX Physics Engine&trade; powers the epic throws, collisions, and staggering blows on ROGUE PLANET. It also gives players the option to make the battlefield more interactive with the implementation of destructible, throwable, and treacherous terrain types. Want to throw an orc in powered armor halfway across the battlefield into a group of goblins and see what survives? FX makes it happen!<br/><br/>ENERGY | The ENERGY expenditure system allows you to simulate the strength of your force, powers the various armor ratings of your troops, and gives you the option to keep your units in play when you want or need to- but there&rsquo;s always a cost!<br/><br/>STREAMLINED GAMEPLAY<br/>GOT SKILLS? | Actions on ROGUE PLANET are a measure of skill. You&rsquo;ll find no &lsquo;buckets-of-dice&rsquo; or straight-line probabilities here. The interactive skill check system means that all players are constantly involved in the game, and you&rsquo;ll need to work for the best possible tactical advantage or risk having your opponent counter you and take advantage of your failures.<br/><br/>NO BOOKKEEPING! | There are no hit point boxes, extensive tables, or detailed stat tracking on ROGUE PLANET&trade;. Not only that, but there are no chits, tokens, spell, psionic, or effect markers littering the table either. The focus is always on the miniatures, terrain, and action on the table.<br/><br/>MEASUREMENT? | There are no measuring sticks, grids, rulers, centimeters, or inches used for the game. Measurements are based on the relative position of units, line-of-sight [LOS], terrain, and the in-game FX Physics Engine&trade;.<br/><br/>CREATE WHAT YOU WANT<br/>CUSTOM FORCE CREATION | Point based unit creation system gives you total control to bring your force to the tabletop in the way you envision it.<br/><br/>EQUIPMENT AND UPGRADES | There are over 30 different types of base weapons, armor ratings, and enhancements in the game that be used by themselves to equip your troops or combined with one another to create almost limitless supply of custom combi-weapons. These upgrades include: axes, blades, lances, blasters, heavy launchers, powered armor, powered fists, gravity hammers, chained blades, psionic force weapons, and grenades.<br/><br/>SORCERERS AND PSYCHERS | What sci-fantasy world would be complete without the inclusion of sorcerers and psychers. Heroes on ROGUE PLANET can be either [or both!] and wield powers like: psionic throw, anchor, time stop, magic missile, blink, deflection, and more. May the psionic force be with you space wizard- always.<br/><br/>PLAY HOW YOU WANT<br/>GAME TYPES | There are multiple levels of play that allow players with various collection sizes and gameplay preferences to enjoy the game and have it grow with them.

For example, during Extended Ops, your heroes may not only gain new followers but just might gain [or become] a nemesis.<br/><br/>SCENARIOS | The included scenarios range from simple battles to ambushes and there are also options for unique modes-of-play featuring ROGUE elements.<br/><br/>"}, "175960": {"statistics": {}, "name": "one after another", "videogamemode": {"2149": "Single-Player"}, "videogameversion": {"270844": "Windows Downloadable edition"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2476692.jpg", "videogametheme": {"2265": "Horror"}, "usersrated": "0", "average": "0", "videogamegenre": {"2346": "Scrolling"}, "videogameplatform": {"4977": "Windows"}, "poll": {}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2476692_t.jpg", "description": "User Summary<br/><br/>one after another is a freeware, procedurally generated horror game played from a third-person, side-scrolling perspective.

The game depicts this conflict at a strategic level, with most operational and tactical details represented by fast and easy-to-play systems, rather than intricate mechanisms. The intent of the game is to provide a broad overview of the historical events while being fun to play. The object of the game for the Japanese player is to control the sea areas around Japan to prevent Russian combatants from bombarding and cutting off supplies to the island nation, and to destroy the naval forces of Russia. The object of the game for the Russian player is to disrupt Japanese sea control, retain sea control around the Russian and Manchurian coastline for as long as possible, and destroy Japanese naval forces. Both players must obtain their objectives by deploying their naval resources into the sea areas on the map, earning victory points at the end of each of six turns for areas under their control, and for opposing units destroyed.<br/><br/>Setting Sun, Rising Sun owes its original inspiration to War at Sea, designed by Jon Edwards and Don Greenwood and published by The Avalon Hill Game Company, a game which covered the war in the Atlantic in World War Two. Setting Sun, Rising Sun borrows a number of concepts from this earlier game as a starting point, such as area movement, individual capital ships, battle line resolutions, and rolling sixes to hit, and then diverges significantly to reflect the Russo-Japanese War situation. The game includes about 280 counters, a 22&quot;x28&quot; map sheet of the combat areas including charts and tables, and a set of rules to play the game.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "1", "boardgameversion": {"270877": "First edition"}, "age": "12", "name": "Setting Sun, Rising Sun", "playingtime": "120", "boardgamemechanic": {"2046": "Area Movement"}, "average": "5.95455", "usersrated": "11", "boardgamefamily": {"6379": "War at Sea"}}, "175981": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2523808.png", "poll": {}, "boardgamedesigner": {"9393": {"name": "N\u00e9stor Romeral Andr\u00e9s"}}, "statistics": {}, "yearpublished": "2015", "maxplayers": "2", "boardgameartist": {"9393": "N\u00e9stor Romeral Andr\u00e9s"}, "boardgamepublisher": {"10094": {"name": "nestorgames"}}, "maxplaytime": "45", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2523808_t.png", "minplaytime": "30", "boardgamecategory": {"1016": {"name": "Science Fiction"}}, "description": "An expansion for Arcade by N&eacute;stor Romeral Andr&eacute;s.<br/><br/>Situation: Tanks are powerful and rugged, but slow, and they must manoeuvre around obstacles.<br/><br/>Solution: Deploy the interceptors.<br/><br/>Interceptors are a new type of unit that can hover over tanks; they&rsquo;re faster but have less endurance and firepower.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": {"270878": "First VHS case edition"}, "name": "Arcade: Reinforcements \u2013 The Interceptor", "playingtime": "45", "boardgamemechanic": {"2072": "Dice Rolling"}, "age": "8", "boardgameexpansion": {}, "usersrated": "12", "boardgamesubdomain": {"5499": "Family Games"}, "expands": {"175845": {"name": "Arcade"}}, "average": "7.625"}, "175982": {"statistics": {}, "bgaccessoryversion": {"270879": "First edition"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2512494.jpg", "description": "Cards for build a team in Zombicide game.<br/>Represent all characters from season 1 to 3.
