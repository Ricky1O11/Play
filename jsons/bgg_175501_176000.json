Its mission was to investigate Tunnicliffe, a rogue neutron star that was travelling past Sol. To accomplish this trick, it was equipped with an experimental star drive which would allow it to break the light barrier.<br/><br/>NFH Bulbar was escorted to Saturn&rsquo;s orbit, activated its drive, and streaked into the inky-black cosmos. The groundbreaking technology of the star drive promised to bring the ship back in three short months.<br/><br/>The star drive did not deliver on said promise.<br/><br/>Two weeks ago, however, a new point of light appeared outside the orbit of Saturn. NFH Bulbar is terribly late, but it has finally arrived. Of course, it finds a solar system drastically changed, teetering on the brink of starvation and civilization-wide collapse. And as one might expect, not all is well on board, either&hellip;<br/><br/>NFH Bulbar is a level five derelict written for five players. As with any other derelict, the level is trivial to shift up or down. To make a derelict a higher level, add dice and squares to damage tracks; to lower the level, remove them.

Twenty years later, a former Parker Brothers employee gave a prototype of the game to the operator of the AtariAge website. Surprisingly, the game was quite complex and seemed to be complete.<br/><br/>The game essentially recreates the action from Book 1 in The Lord of the Rings novel. You play the roll of Frodo Baggins trying to safely journey from Hobbiton to Rivendell while being relentlessly pursued by Dark Riders. You may use the ring to hide from spying birds but this also speeds up your pursuers. You may also meet several characters from the book including Sam Gamgee, Strider and Gandalf, along with the usually neglected characters of Tom Bombadil and Glorfindel who all give you special powers to aid you in your flight.<br/><br/>"}, "175514": {"poll": [], "name": "Magical Maiden Madison", "videogamemode": ["Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["Web Browser edition"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3331132.jpg", "videogametheme": ["Anime", "Comedy", "Superhero"], "usersrated": "0", "videogamedeveloper": ["(Self-Developed Video Game)"], "videogamegenre": ["Visual Novel"], "videogameplatform": ["Web Browser"], "average": "0", "statistics": [], "videogamepublisher": ["(Self-Published)"], "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3331132_t.jpg", "description": "User Summary<br/><br/>A Twine visual novel parodying magical girl anime such as Sailor Moon.<br/><br/>"}, "175515": {"poll": [], "name": "Even Cowgirls Bleed", "videogamemode": ["Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["Web Browser edition"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3331128.jpg", "videogametheme": ["Western"], "usersrated": "0", "videogamedeveloper": ["(Self-Developed Video Game)"], "videogamegenre": ["Light Gun Shooter", "Text Adventure"], "videogameplatform": ["Web Browser"], "average": "0", "statistics": [], "videogamepublisher": ["(Self-Published)"], "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3331128_t.jpg", "description": "User Summary<br/><br/>A text adventure about heartbreak in the West... with shooting gallery sections.<br/><br/>"}, "175516": {"image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2829035.jpg", "poll": [], "boardgamedesigner": ["Jeff Johnston (II)"], "statistics": [], "yearpublished": "2016", "maxplayers": "6", "boardgameartist": ["Michael Parla"], "boardgamepublisher": ["Breaking Games"], "maxplaytime": "60", "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2829035_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "45", "boardgamecategory": ["Bluffing", "Card Game", "Science Fiction"], "description": "HOOK: The movies Alien and Escape from Alcatraz meet 3-Card Monte meet the spin cycle of your washing machine!<br/><br/>In MoonQuake Escape, get ready to face the challenges of the spinning, changing 3D surface of the doomed prison planet of Zartaclaton.

Silent Legions is a creation kit, a toolbox in the Sine Nomine style for creating your own Mythos, with all-new deities, alien entities, foul magics, accursed artifacts, unaussprechlichen kulten, and diabolical dream-worlds to bedevil your players. These tools are system-neutral, so even fans of other Lovecraftian gaming systems can scoop them up to add a splash of fresh horror to their more familiar tentacular abominations.<br/><br/>Not only that, but Silent Legions is built to help the GM create investigative adventures with minimal strain.

Act fast, before conspiracy turns you against your own.<br/><br/>The year is 1692, and it is a perilous time to live in the town of Salem, Massachusetts. One wrong step, or one misplaced accusation, and you could be the next witch to hang. &quot;Salem&quot; takes players into this perilous world and lets them re-live the tension, politics, and religious extremism that still has people talking about it 300 years later.<br/><br/>The game is packaged in a faux book box that closes magnetically. The game, disguised as a worn out leather book, can easily hide on your bookshelf and masquerade as an antique.<br/><br/>Players can play as prominent villagers from the old Salem town, and even read their bios in the instruction manual. The servant girl Mary Warren, pastor Samuel Parris, farmer John Proctor, storyteller Tituba, and beggar Sarah Good are some of the 12 characters featured in the game.<br/><br/>Players, each acting as one of these unique characters, are given 3-5 Tryal cards (depending on the number of players). These Tryal cards reveal the true identity of each player, &quot;Witch&quot; or &quot;Not a Witch.&quot;<br/><br/>During gameplay, players gather cards that they use to accuse, or defend, other players. Deciding who to trust is key to survival, since you can never play a card on yourself. When you suspect someone to be a witch, you can begin accusing them with red accusation cards. When enough accusations have been placed on one of the players, the player who lays the final accusation chooses one of that player's Tryal cards to reveal. Once all &quot;Witch&quot; Tryal cards have been found, the villagers of Salem win.<br/><br/>Players can also use green and blue cards such as &quot;Alibi&quot;, &quot;Stocks&quot;, &quot;Matchmaker&quot;, &quot;Asylum&quot;, and &quot;Scapegoat&quot; to help or hurt their allies or enemies.<br/><br/>As players draw cards, they will eventually draw black cards that take immediate effect. One black card, &quot;Night&quot;, forces all players to close their eyes while the Witches choose someone to eliminate, the Constable chooses someone to potentially save, and the Spy chooses a Tryal card to look at. The other black card, &quot;Conspiracy,&quot; forces all players to take a face-down Tryal card from the player to their left. Killing witches quickly is essential, otherwise &quot;Conspiracy&quot; may soon have the whole town turned evil.<br/><br/>Before long, accusations will be flying, and screams of &quot;She's a WITCH!&quot; will wake the neighbours. Will you be the hero who purges your town of witches, or will you be wrongly accused and hung for witchcraft? Or perhaps you will be a witch yourself, escape conviction, and bring Salem to the ground.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "4", "boardgameversion": ["First Edition", "Print-and-Play first edition"], "average": "7.02129", "name": "Salem", "playingtime": "35", "boardgamemechanic": ["Hand Management", "Voting"], "age": "12", "usersrated": "373", "boardgamesubdomain": ["Party Games"], "boardgamefamily": ["Crowdfunding: Kickstarter", "States: Massachusetts", "Werewolf / Mafia"], "boardgamepodcastepisode": ["TRCP Launch Episode 4", "TRCP Sunday Fund Day Episode 2"]}, "175550": {"rpgartist": ["Yoann Boissonnet", "Jerry Grayson", "Renee Grayson", "Nathan Marcel", "Nathan Rosario"], "rpgitemversion": ["PDF version", "Softcover Version"], "poll": [], "name": "Atlantis: Hero's Guide", "rpgdesigner": ["Douglas Bramlett", "Jerry Grayson", "Kieran Turley"], "rpgproducer": ["Jerry Grayson"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2464354.jpg", "usersrated": "0", "average": "0", "rpgissuearticle": ["New Releases June 2014"], "rpg": ["Atlantis: The Second Age (2nd Edition)"], "rpgpublisher": ["Khepera Publishing"], "statistics": [], "rpgcategory": ["Sourcebook (rules/options to enhance play)"], "rpggenre": ["Fantasy (Sword & Sorcery)"], "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2464354_t.jpg", "description": "Publisher Blurb:<br/><br/>The heroes of the ATLANTIS: The Second Age RPG are evocative and varied and many character combinations exist.

There are 3 roles (Deity, Demons, Spirits). The Deity wins if he kills all Demons and non-subjugated Spirits. The Demons win if they kill the Deity. The Spirits win if they kill the Deity and 1 Demon or 1 Spirit who has killed a Demon. The Deity has 3 power up cards which he can offer as a reward to subjugate(ie. ally) a Spirit. Spirits can renege on the alliance/subjugation but will suffer penalties for doing so. The game replaces the suits (Heart, Spades, etc) of Bang with a 5-element system (Metal, Wood, Water, Fire, Earth) and characters, abilities and card actions vary depending on the elements involved. There is no concept of Distance and no Missed cards. Attacks succeed or are countered based on the elements. Card actions often require Magic points to power them. Otherwise the gameplay is quite similar.<br/><br/>Game Mode 2 (Faction Battles):<br/>This mode can only be played with an even number of players (4-10). Players split into 2 camps and a representative from each camp draw 1 of 5 faction cards to see what faction they are. Factions have specific powers which can be triggered to allow cooperation between members of the faction.

Make villagers fall in love, turn them into frogs, or teleport them to different locations. Use your familiars to gather ingredients and cast spells on the villagers to achieve goals and score victory points as you vie to be named the village crone.<br/><br/>All the players are witches who have come upon a medieval village without a crone. They send out familiars to gather ingredients they can use in spells to complete Witch's Scheme cards. Each of the cards is worth 1, 2, or 3 points, which also indicates how difficult the scheme is to complete. The witch who scores 13 points wins.<br/><br/>The village consists of 6 location game boards: village green, lord's manor, farm, mill, forge, and tithe barn. The locations are modular and can be placed in any order or configuration as long as the gridlines line up. (The easiest way to play is with a 3x2 retangular configuration.)<br/><br/>The villagers, who are the most frequent targets of the Witch's Schemes, have starting locations. The peasant begins in the village green, the lord in the lord's manor, the farmer in the farm, the miller in the mill, the blacksmith in the forge, and the priest in the tithe barn.<br/><br/>The ingredients can be found at 4 of the 6 locations. Silver is in the lord's manor, soil in the farm, flour in the mill, and fire in the forge. There are also 3 eye of newt cards in each stack of ingredients and can be used as wild cards in spells.<br/><br/>At the beginning of the game, each player is dealt 1 of each of the 3 levels of Witch's Scheme cards. Consulting their Books of Spells (which are the same for each witch) to determine which ingredients will be needed to cast the spells on their Witch's Scheme cards, they put 1 familiar in the village green, take turns placing 2 additional familiars in other locations, and draw 2 ingredients from those locations.<br/><br/>The first step in the order of play is to tithe. As soon as each player knows which ingredient they will sacrifice, they place it facedown in the tithe barn. This seeds the tithe barn with ingredients that can be gleaned with the Fortune spell (which allows a player to draw any 3 ingredients from the tithe barn). However, any player who placed a familiar in the tithe barn does not have to tithe.<br/><br/>Then, in turn order, players may move their own familiars and/or villagers and cast spells. (Spells may be cast for strategic or tactical purposes as well as to complete Witch's Schemes.) The movement is limited to a total of 6 spaces, and the number of spells is limited only by the ingredients the player has. The movement and spellcasting can be in any order on a player's turn. A player can even intersperse movement and spellcasting. If a player completes a Witch's Scheme, the card is turned over so that the other players can clearly see how many points that player has. After he/she is finished moving and casting spells, he/she draws 1 of each of the 3 levels of cards, reads them, and decides which one(s) to add to his/her hand as replacements.<br/><br/>When all players have finished moving and casting spells, the players harvest 2 ingredients for each familiar in a location, and the broom (which indicates the first player) is moved clockwise.<br/><br/>The spells are Conjuring (to add up to 2 more familiars into play), Love (to join the fates of 2 villagers, meaning spells cast on one affect the other and movement of one moves the other), Transformation (to turn a villager into a frog or vice versa), Binding (to lock a location down and prevent anyone or anything from entering or leaving a location), Switching (to change the place of 2 familiars and/or villagers), Summoning (to cause a villager to move to a location containing one of the player's familiars), Fortune (to allow a player to draw any 3 ingredients from the tithe barn), and Protection (to block a spell cast by another player). 1 silver can also be used to complete a Scheme out of turn or to discard and draw a new Witch's Scheme card. Each spell requires not only ingredients but also an incantation, which is provided in the Book of Spells. Alternatively, players can make up their own incantations. If a player is caught trying to complete a spell without speaking the incantation, the spell does not work.<br/><br/>Each witch has access to the same number of starting familiars, the same ingredients, the same spells, and 3 Schemes of the same level. But the witch who most cleverly uses these resources to reach 13 points is named the village crone.<br/><br/>The Village Crone also includes rules for solitaire play.<br/><br/>"}, "175593": {"average": "0", "poll": [], "name": "Whirly's World", "playingtime": "30", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": ["Roll / Spin and Move"], "yearpublished": "2015", "usersrated": "0", "maxplayers": "6", "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3153414_t.jpg", "boardgameartist": ["Alvin Madden"], "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["SimplyFun"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3153414.jpg", "boardgameversion": ["First Edition"], "maxplaytime": "30", "boardgamecategory": ["Children's Game", "Educational", "Math"], "age": "6", "minplaytime": "15", "description": "Glide along the trail rolling dice, completing odd &amp; even cards &amp; gathering Whirly tokens.

Careful, calculating, and efficient, the agents of law are as purposeful as they are relentless. They are not wholly emotionless, but their is a certain dispassionate aloofness that characterizes their interactions with one another and especially with others. Their analytical frankness often feels like condescending hauteur, but the lords of law tend to be disturbingly perceptive and brutally honest when it suits them. It is duty, purity, stability, and consistency that are their bywords, whether their goal is succor or slaughter of the innocent. This book contains a wide variety of ultra-lawful beings, from the near-angelic archons to the shadowy and sinister jangling kytons. You will find tiny servitors of order like lantern archons and augur kytons, up through footsoldiers like the hound archon and kyton to the glorious trumpet and star archons. Between such extremes of good and evil, and often beyond any conventional sense of morality other than the pursuit of perfection, this book also brings you a bevy of truly lawful beings, from the azer working the forge-fires of creation to the axiomites that record the calculus of the universe, and the race of inevitables from lowly arbiters to mighty maruts that monitor and judge the flow of reality and excise corruption and chaos wherever it is found. As if these were not enough, we also bring you the serpentine sakathan, a race of reptilian kings who sought order, dominion, and divinity over their home world but gave into diabolic temptation. These fallen god-kings became suzerain-slaves to the Lords of Hell, their new emissaries in bringing new worlds under the inflexible tyranny of purest law and blackest evil.<br/><br/>"}, "175636": {"image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2598493.jpg", "poll": [], "boardgamedesigner": ["Catarina Lacerda", "Vital Lacerda"], "statistics": [], "yearpublished": "2017", "maxplayers": "5", "boardgameartist": ["Mihajlo Dimitrievski"], "boardgamepublisher": ["Knight Works, LLC"], "maxplaytime": "30", "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2598493_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "15", "boardgamecategory": ["Card Game", "Deduction", "Dice", "Fantasy"], "description": "The game is battle between an evil hunter who wants to shoot the dragons and its keepers.<br/><br/>In this fantasy Dragon universe, there are the hunter and the keepers.<br/>Each player is the Chief of a tribe of Dragon keepers defending the dragons from attacks by the Evil Hunter<br/><br/>The hunter wants to see those cute dragons dead, but they need to pass the dragon keepers.<br/> The keepers belong to different tribes but together they have the common goal of protecting the Dragons.

The Dearg Due is Ireland&rsquo;s original vampire. A woman of stunning beauty, the Dearg Due was forced into a marriage to a man she didn&rsquo;t love by her controlling father. Distraught about never being able to be with the man she truly loved, she killed herself, but death could not hold her in the grave. She rose up and exacted revenge on her father and husband, and drained their bodies of blood. Now, she rises from her grave in County Waterford to spread her curse upon the land.<br/><br/>Her vampire minions must drink in the counties of Ireland, vying to become the top vampire of all the island. Or, choose to be a werewolf and try to thwart the vampires.<br/><br/>Gampeplay<br/>The gameplay is designed so that the game is interesting and fun, even for those not drinking, but simple enough that people who are drinking can play the game. The game will still be quite enjoyable if the drinking aspect is omitted entirely.<br/><br/>Goal<br/>The first player to reach 25 victims, and make it safely back to the Waterford Cemetery, wins the game.<br/><br/>Players travel from adjacent county to county (or by train, if they wish to skip to a different part of the island).

Together the players create a plot involving their characters, much like an ongoing television series or soap opera. Unlike reading a novel or watching a show, however, the players can actually change the course of the story. They are not spectators to the action; rather, the plot revolves around the characters they play.<br/><br/>The world of Ghastly Affair is characterized by monsters and madness, desperate love and implacable hate. Innocent damsels are imperiled by the desires of wicked men, while creatures of nightmare lurk in the dark corners of the world. Lovers are torn apart by twisted customs and pitiless laws. Dark castles hide the horrible secrets of ancient noble families. Obsessed men of science create abominable new forms of life. Brutal brigands lurk in dark forests. Grave robbers despoil churchyards for profit. Worst of all, the dead are said to walk by night, and certain men are cursed to wander the moors as wolves.<br/><br/>A character might engage in a forbidden romance with a brooding poet, battle an infestation of Vampyres in a lonely graveyard, or play cards with Death in a secluded coffeehouse. Characters could wield dark sorcery atop a bare mountain, sell their soul for wealth, or run from a forced marriage to the freedom of banditry. The game can feature as much thrilling action and dramatic role-playing as the players want.

Any number of players can conduct a campaign, in which each type of army has a different set of victory conditions. While holding off Rome's many enemies, the Roman players are also trying to defeat each other and ultimately become (and remain!) emperor.<br/><br/>The Persians are trying to carve away provinces in the east and add them to the Sassanian monarchy. The barbarians are trying to raid and carry away as much loot as possible while amassing glory from victorious battles over any sort of enemy, even one's own tribe. Every battle is therefore a balancing act, in which the military and political context is constantly shifting.<br/> Aurelian can be played with miniatures, or with &quot;unit tiles&quot; on any flat surface, much in the same manner as Bl&uuml;cher's unit cards. The centerpiece of the game is the campaign, in which each player manages the fortunes of his character and faction, much in the manner of the campaigns in Maurice and Longstreet. <br/> Unlike most Ancients games, which attempt to span the millennia from Moses to Columbus, Aurelian concentrates on a specific period of roughly 70 years. Players fight a series of nine battles against a variety of enemies, often from one's own side. The composition of their armies changes. Veteran Roman legionaries become incresingly scarce and irreplaceable as the Roman players cobble together vexillations and recruit barbarian foedorati and tributarii. Will the Persians squander their expensive elite cataphracts and elephant units in early battles, or hold them in reserve? Will a barbarian warlord play it safe and not raid as deeply into the empire, at the risk of not bringing back enough treasure and glory to maintain the loyalty of his optimates?<br/><br/>"}, "175744": {"boardgamedesigner": ["Sam A.

They are presented in chronological order of their Historical Angst&trade; appearance in the 1800s-ish timeframe, and include:<br/><br/>     Captain Robert Walton: Walton is a failed poet who believed his only saving grace was to launch an expedition to the North Pole that, unfortunately, ends with his boat getting stuck in the ice. From Frankenstein by Mary Shelley, Walton represents the epitome of the suffering goth.<br/>     Countess Anna Fedotovna: The Countess is not only an arrogant yet absent-minded Russian royal who boasts friends like the Comte de Saint Germaine, but is also a gamer with &ldquo;the&rdquo; trick to winning card hands. From The Queen of Spades by Aleksandr S. Pushkin, Fedotovna is &ldquo;the&rdquo; gamer goth.<br/>     Princess Hermonthis: A four-thousand year old Egyptian teenaged mummy named Princess Hermonthis is beside herself, because she lost her foot. From The Mummy&rsquo;s Foot, written by Th&eacute;ophile Gautier, the Princess highlights the turbulent nature of the angsty goth.<br/>     The Black Cat: No collection of Gothic characters would be complete without a terrifying Gothic creature, and this poor, distraught, one-eyed, pitiful black cat represents the emo goth. From The Black Cat by Edgar Allan Poe.<br/>     Baron Vordenburg: After taking up the charge of his vampire-hunting ancestor, Baron Vordenburg arrives in the nick of time to save the day! From Carmilla by Joseph Sheridan Le Fanu, the Baron is the iconic wannabe goth, for he&rsquo;s actually never hunted or encountered a vampire before.<br/>     Thomas Carnacki: Last but not least, Thomas Carnacki is a ghost finder for England&rsquo;s elite. He dresses up in Victorian era clothing, pens unusual occult tomes no one else has ever heard of, and tinkers with strange objects like his electrified pentagram. From Carnacki the Ghost-Finder, the occult investigator dresses so well, he&rsquo;s labeled a Victorian goth.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>"}, "175855": {"image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2476358.jpg", "poll": [], "boardgamedesigner": ["Jon Nord", "Matt Nord"], "statistics": [], "yearpublished": "2015", "maxplayers": "3", "boardgameartist": ["Mark Soderwall", "Kevin Toft"], "boardgamepublisher": ["Summon Entertainment Corp"], "boardgameintegration": ["Epic Roll: Eclipse", "Epic Roll: Eclipse"], "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2476358_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "15", "boardgamecategory": ["Dice", "Fantasy", "Fighting", "Zombies"], "description": "Epic Roll is a quick-playing, dice-based, fantasy board game.

Each isometric square represents a tile. At the beginning of each level, a picture made up of sixteen tiles will be displayed to the player. The computer will then rearrange the tiles which make up the picture, and distribute some in other areas of the level. The player's task is to restore the picture to the way it looked at the beginning of the level. This is achieved by walking around the isometric world, picking up tiles, and placing them in the correct place. Throughout a level, warps must be found which allow the player to change from walking on the floor to walking on the walls. Each level has a time limit. If the time runs out, the player loses.

In this game, where you can fight monsters as well as your opponents, and get a reward if you win the fight. At the end, when you are strong and equipped enough, you can dare to fight and beat the evil Dragon - which is menacing the world of Arcasam - before your opponents do. You will get better, stronger and more powerful each round, however your victory depends on the strategy you choose.<br/><br/>Setup<br/>There are 7 big hexes in the game - 1 center hex, which is the Dragon's den and 6 other hexes creating the terrain. The shape of the game board varies according to the number of players - it is versatile. This will guarantee that the game board will be always adequate - not too big, not too small.<br/><br/>Each hex contains 5 slots - you can place a castle, tavern, iron mine, tailor, tanner, orchard or monsters there. You can place them evenly or randomly. This factor contributes to the variability of the game as well.<br/><br/>Apart from the game board, each player has his own player board in front of him. He can mark his place a weapon there, place his companion card as well as mark his current attack, defence and health points. The last component is a main board, where players count the rounds and phases of the game.<br/><br/>Game Play Overview<br/>Each round,player has a fixed number of steps he can make (at the beginning it is 13) and during his turn, he can step on/pass through the following:<br/><br/><br/>    Empty spot: No action<br/>    Iron mine / Tailor / Tanner / Orchard: You will get the supply of iron / cloth / leather / food. Materials (iron, cloth and leather) are needed when you want to buy a weapon and upgrade your skill tree. Without weapon, you cannot fight the monsters and your opponents.<br/>    Monster: Once you step on this slot, you have to fight the particular monster. If  you win, you get a precious piece of gold along with the loot.<br/>    Castle: In the castle, you can buy weapons needed for the fights, or you can improve your skill tree.<br/>    Tavern: Each time you pass through the tavern, you have to draw 1 companion card, where you will find some kind of advantage. In the tavern, you can be also healed after the fight. (1 step = 1 life).<br/><br/><br/>If you encounter one of your opponents during your round and you both already have a weapon, you or him can choose to fight one another. The winner gets 8 materials from the backpack of the loser and the loser will have to get healed in the tavern.<br/><br/>So, you can fight either the monster or one of your opponents. The system of the monster fight is different than the system of the fight with your opponent. Weapons have different costs, however you always need to pay one piece of gold which you can get only if you beat the monster.<br/><br/>-Fight with your opponents<br/><br/>When one hero encounters another one, and both of them have a weapon, each of them can choose to start a fight. For 1 food they can always draw 2 action cards (they can be either attack or defense) but the maximum they can have in hand is 10.<br/><br/>Hero who chose to fight his opponent starts and plays an attack. The attacked has to have a defense card in order not to loose any lives. Then the other player (attacked) plays an attack and and the attacker has to play a defense. If one of the players does not have a defence card, he has to subtract certain number of lives, depending on the attack of the attacker and defense of the attacked. If one of the players has 0 lives, he lost the fight and has to give 8 materials from his backpack to his opponent. Then he has to get healed to the tavern.<br/><br/>-Fight with the monsters<br/><br/>Fight with the monster is much easier then the fight with other hero. Each monster has certain number of lives and strength of his attack, depending on the phase of the game. This is the only part of the game where player uses the dice. Depending on the number the player rolled on the dice and on the current phase of the game (1,2,3), monster attacks with a certain strength. The player has to play defence cards in order not to loose the fight. Then he has to play the attack cards to beat the monster, depending on number of lives the particular monster has, and on the weapon the hero has.  If the hero wins, he will take 1 gold and choose 1 loot, where he can find some kind of advantage.<br/><br/>The fight with the Dragon is the same as a fight with other monsters, but he is very strong, so the player has to be very well equiped and experienced.<br/><br/>"}, "175937": {"rpgdesigner": ["Dan Coleman"], "rpgitemversion": ["PDF version"], "poll": [], "name": "Imbued with Magic", "rpgartist": ["Dan Coleman"], "rpgproducer": ["Dan Coleman"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2479304.jpg", "usersrated": "0", "average": "0", "rpggenre": ["Fantasy (High Fantasy)"], "statistics": [], "rpg": ["5e Game System Product (D&D 5th Edition Compatible)"], "rpgpublisher": ["Dan Coleman Productions"], "rpgcategory": ["Sourcebook (rules/options to enhance play)"], "rpgseries": ["Dungeons On Demand"], "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2479304_t.jpg", "description": "From publisher blurb:<br/><br/>Who doesn't want more magic items?<br/><br/>Inside are 15 new magic items to use in your 5th edition campaign.

The game depicts this conflict at a strategic level, with most operational and tactical details represented by fast and easy-to-play systems, rather than intricate mechanisms. The intent of the game is to provide a broad overview of the historical events while being fun to play. The object of the game for the Japanese player is to control the sea areas around Japan to prevent Russian combatants from bombarding and cutting off supplies to the island nation, and to destroy the naval forces of Russia. The object of the game for the Russian player is to disrupt Japanese sea control, retain sea control around the Russian and Manchurian coastline for as long as possible, and destroy Japanese naval forces. Both players must obtain their objectives by deploying their naval resources into the sea areas on the map, earning victory points at the end of each of six turns for areas under their control, and for opposing units destroyed.<br/><br/>Setting Sun, Rising Sun owes its original inspiration to War at Sea, designed by Jon Edwards and Don Greenwood and published by The Avalon Hill Game Company, a game which covered the war in the Atlantic in World War Two. Setting Sun, Rising Sun borrows a number of concepts from this earlier game as a starting point, such as area movement, individual capital ships, battle line resolutions, and rolling sixes to hit, and then diverges significantly to reflect the Russo-Japanese War situation.
