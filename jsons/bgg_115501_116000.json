The citizens of every nation were already living in dread of the bomber, and its promise to rain death down upon the cities in which they lived with impunity &ndash; that nightmare was now a reality.<br/><br/>From the outset of the war, Germany demonstrated just how lethal aircraft could be when used in conjunction with infantry and armour. Indeed, this was the very cornerstone of Blitzkrieg. However, aircraft evolved into weapon delivery platforms in their own right. For the first time, ship-launched attack aircraft could destroy vessels far beyond the visual range of their parent carrier, as demonstrated first by the Royal Navy at Taranto, then at Pearl Harbour by Japan, and finally by US forces as they hopped across the islands of the Pacific.<br/><br/>Heavy bombers pounded cities and factories throughout the war, but the dreams commanders had of aircraft being able to win wars proved to be mislead. A population bombarded did not automatically result in a breakdown of national morale &ndash; quite the opposite. Also, technology evolved to counter bomber attacks, from the dogged defence of the British Isles during the Battle of Britain, to the sophisticated layered defences of Germany against the thousand bomber raids.<br/><br/>On the battlefield, the importance of air superiority became apparent, with the dominant force claiming the skies. Once enemy aircraft had been chased from the battlefield, fighter bombers used cannon, bomb and rocket to annihilate ground forces. Even mighty tanks were fodder for the Stuka, Thunderbolt and Typhoon.<br/><br/>Infantry and armour were still needed to wage war and take ground. The addition of aircraft made their task either a great deal easier or far more difficult, depending on how their pilots fared in the air.<br/><br/>This book contains aircraft from every period of the war, for every military force featured in Battlefield Evolution: World at War. Each aircraft has been painstakingly researched, and includes upgrades throughout the war, and multiple payload options, guaranteeing you will find a use for all the weapons included in your average aircraft kit!<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": {"142270": "Mongoose Publishing Paperback edition"}, "average": "0", "name": "Battlefield Evolution: Warbirds of World War II", "playingtime": "0", "age": "15", "boardgameexpansion": {}, "usersrated": "0", "expands": {"25253": {"name": "Battlefield Evolution"}}, "boardgamefamily": {"5201": "Battlefield Evolution"}}, "115520": {"boardgamedesigner": {"180": {"name": "Bertram Kaes"}}, "average": "0", "poll": {}, "name": "LET's go!", "playingtime": "60", "minplayers": "3", "boardgamemechanic": {"2041": "Card Drafting"}, "yearpublished": "1999", "usersrated": "0", "maxplayers": "6", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1183617_t.jpg", "boardgameartist": {"56533": "Gabor Racsmany"}, "statistics": {}, "boardgamepublisher": {"21261": {"name": "PwC"}}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1183617.jpg", "boardgameversion": {"142272": "PwC promotional edition"}, "maxplaytime": "60", "boardgamecategory": {"1039": {"name": "Deduction"}}, "age": "16", "minplaytime": "60", "description": "Objective: be the first ending on space 25 (finish line)<br/> - acting/moving by turn -<br/>a 'Trivia' approach with (some) unusual challenges<br/>1. roll the die, move your (question) meeple<br/>2. ending on a coloured space your right neighbour draws a card <br/>3.

In the panic of the evacuation, classified information has been left behind in the eastern sector. The enemy's grip tightens and an immediate raid must take place to retrieve the vital data. This is a jobfor ACTION FORCE ...<br/><br/>Flint, Lady Jaye and Quick Kick use a modified A.W.E. Striker to cross the hazardous path to the eastern side of the island. You are Snake Eyes, using a custom-built helipack and armed with an automatic rifle. You must defend A.W.E. Striker and clear a safe path. Pontoons must be<br/>utilised to allow A.W.E. Striker to cross canals. The enemy have installed missiles, initiated electric charge generators and built barricades. You must deal with all of these to allow A.W.E. Striker tocomplete the mission successfully.<br/><br/>Gang of Five meet ACTION FORCE! Virgin's crack programming team have created this excellent arcade game featuring superb graphics and compelling game play.<br/><br/><br/>     8 levels of increasing difficulty<br/>     Smooth-scrolling, fast arcade action<br/>     Your Spectrum's capabilities pushed to the limit<br/><br/><br/>The small island of Botsneda, just off the mainland, was heavily populated by civilian and military personnel. A ruthless attack by COBRA, the enemy, meant the evacuation of civilians from the tourist resorts of Botsneda.<br/><br/>The military installation was not so lucky. Despite the latest early warning systems guarding the installation, they only realised they were being attacked after it was too late to retaliate. The only sensible option was to withdraw, which was carried out swiftly. However, the allied forces destroyed much of the installation to prevent it falling into enemy hands. The eastern sector of the installation could not be destroyed during the attack as there wasn't time, and certain classified information may now be in the evil clutches of COBRA! The allies will have many embarrassing questions to answer about just how this was allowed to happen.<br/><br/>Botsneda's closeness to the mainland is of great strategic advantage to the enemy. COBRA cannot be allowed to consolidate their position, nor must they have the time to retrieve and analyse the classified information left behind on the installation. Time is of the essence, but conventional forces cannot be used because their planning and deployment will take time.<br/><br/>The eastern sector of the military installation was a spy base which collected information about COBRA personnel and tactics. The main database is on hard disc attached to the computer. Gun-happy Dreadnoks may well have destroyed it, but the risk cannot be taken. If the enemy studies the intelligence information they will know how to change their tactics and defence systems to defeat the allied forces. Also, the information will take years to replace.<br/><br/>A crack squad is needed to mount an immediate raid to get back the information (if it is still intact) and get out again.<br/><br/>The ACTION FORCE (tm) squad will land on the western sector of the island, cutting straight through enemy defences. A.W.E. Striker and an airborne Snake Eyes, using a custom-built helipack, are to carry out the raid. The All Weather and Environment Striker has four-wheel drive and is capable of speeds of 60 MPH cross country. These give it manoeuvrability, speed and smooth passage over rough terrain.<br/><br/>Fastened to the back of the A.W.E. Striker is a delicate but powerful tapping computer necessary to retrieve the classified information from the hard disc. Modifications to the dashboard are necessary so the front passenger can operate the controls; additional space has been created for an extra passenger. The swivelling roof cannon has been removed to allow for greater speed, so Snake Eyes will have to defend the vehicle from the air. Snake Eyes can pick up canisters of fuel and ammunition from supply towers on the island, although it is wise not to use them until needed.<br/><br/>Crankcase is the natural choice for this mission as he is an expert driver and experienced with A.W.E. Striker [although it said Quick Kick earlier on. JimG]. Intelligence expert Lady Jaye is extremely knowledgeable in the processing and retrieval of intelligence data. She will operate the tapping and message retrieval system from the passenger seat. Flint will also travel in A.W.E. Striker to cover personnel at the computer system.<br/><br/>COBRA, the enemy, have placed many dastardly traps to delay or destroy the ACTION FORCE (tm) team. Rocket silos present a dangerous obstacle to Snake Eyes and concrete barricades prevent the A.W.E. Striker from reaching its destination easily. Other dangers include floating target mines and electric charge generators. All of these will have to be navigated in order to reach the eastern sector of the island. Additionally, pontoon bridges must be lifted and set over canals and areas of water to allow A.W.E. Striker to pass.<br/><br/>Now you have been fully briefed on the mission, ACTION FORCE (tm) is in your hands.<br/><br/>"}, "115529": {"statistics": {}, "name": "Action Force II", "videogamemode": {"2149": "Single-Player"}, "videogameversion": {"142288": "ZX Spectrum Cassette edition"}, "average": "0", "videogameseries": {"16893": "Action Force"}, "videogametheme": {"2508": "Military"}, "usersrated": "0", "videogamegenre": {"2314": "Arcade"}, "videogameplatform": {"4950": "ZX Spectrum"}, "poll": {}, "description": "From the instructions:<br/><br/>LOOK OUT COBRA, ACTION FORCE ARE BACK!<br/><br/>In the run down slums of the city, COBRA backed terrorists are holding innocent citizens hostage. Action Force have vowed to rescue as many hostages as possile from the clutches of the evil COBRA enemy.

As AIRTIGHT you must use your skill and marksmanship to protect your friend as he climbs the buildings and braves the deadly COBRA tanks to reach the hostages.<br/><br/>QUICK KICK starts at the base of a building and climbs to the roof where the hostages are being held. Along the way he will be attacked by various COBRA terrorists. These may appear from doorways, windows or even dustbins. Watch out! All these are deadly and they will attack if they can. You must aim the telescopic sight of your Machine Gun at the terrorists and shoot them before they are able to attack. After sucessfully freeing the first set of hostages, AIRTIGHT has the option of selecting either a Machine Gun, Bazooka or Bio Gun. QUICK KICK then rushes the next level to free more hostages.<br/><br/>If QUICK KICK is hit he will lose one of his lives. As he climbs the building, he will gradually lose energy. By shooting the 'Stars and Stripes' fixes to the walls on some screens, you can replenish his energy. Otherwise he will lose a life when his energy falls to zero.<br/><br/>On every third level, QUICK KICK will have to destroy a COBRA battle tank. The player must build up and keep his rate of fire steady by alternately pressing the left and right keys/joystick control as fast as possible. If QUICK KICK does not score 39 hits on the tank before the time limit expires, the tank will have finished loading its ammunition and will return fire.<br/><br/>At the end of each game you will be given a rating on your performance.<br/><br/>FEATURES * Quick kick * Gunsight * Bazooka * Bio Gun * Machine Gun * Dustbins * Oil Barrels * Crates * Hostages * Gunmen * Baseball Thugs * Dynamite throwers * Plant pots * One ton weights * Bullet holes * Bazooka craters * Explosions * 'First Aid Box' extra lives * Torches * Blue flame explosive torches * Helicopter * Battle tank * Hostage Hut * Hostage Tower * Doorways * Opening windows * Multi levels<br/><br/>"}, "115530": {"videogame": {"115536": "Family Party: 90 Great Games \u2013 Party Pack"}, "statistics": {}, "name": "Family Party: 30 Great Games", "videogamemode": {"2422": "Local Multiplayer"}, "videogameversion": {"142291": "Australian Wii edition"}, "average": "0", "videogameseries": {"16894": "Family Party"}, "videogametheme": {"2428": "Minigame Compilation"}, "usersrated": "0", "videogamegenre": {"2338": "Party"}, "videogameplatform": {"4441": "Wii"}, "poll": {}, "videogamecompilation": {"115536": "Family Party: 90 Great Games \u2013 Party Pack"}, "description": "Fun for kids of all ages, Family Party: 30 Great Games lets up to 4 players participate in wide variety of fun and addictive party games.

The two players sit opposite each other. The sphere in front of each player represents their respective flag (or, in this case, &quot;phlag&quot;). The spheres in the middle represent a wall. These four spheres cannot be moved.<br/><br/>Movement rules:<br/>Two players, White and Black, take turns either placing a sphere of their color within their half of the game board (the half facing the player, e.g. anywhere within the triangle B7-G2-G7 for the lower player, and A6-F1-A1 for the upper player), in any level possible, or by moving their sphere up to a total of 4 spaces. No spheres can be initially placed along the diagonal line indicated by the wall (A7-G1), or the opponent&rsquo;s half, although spheres can be moved into these positions.<br/>A &quot;space&quot; is defined as a space on the grid (not the holes). This means that moving from one hole to the next (for example, E7-C7) involves moving 2 spaces. Player movements may involve movements up or down levels. If a sphere that supports only one other sphere is moved, the top sphere drops down into the vacated hole. If a sphere supports more than one other sphere, it is locked into place.<br/><br/>Other rules:<br/>The last turn's board position cannot be repeated (ko rule). Passing is allowed. If a player cannot make a legal move, the player passes.<br/><br/>Aim:<br/>Players aim to touch their opponent&rsquo;s flag with as many of their own spheres as possible. There are three legal positions at which an opponent&rsquo;s flag can be &quot;touched&quot;; E7, F6, G5 for the lower flag, and A3, B2, C1 for the upper flag.<br/><br/>Winning conditions:<br/>Players win instantly upon moving at least two of their spheres into touching contact with the opponent&rsquo;s flag. Otherwise, the game ends when both players pass sequentially or if both players agree to end the game. The player that has more spheres touching the opponent&rsquo;s flag after ending the game wins. In case of a draw with respect to the number of spheres touching the opponent&rsquo;s flag, the player with fewer spheres on the board wins. If both players have identical numbers of spheres touching their opponent&rsquo;s flag, and equal numbers of spheres in the game, the game ends in a draw.<br/><br/>Examples of legal moves are shown in the files section.<br/><br/>Designed by Lars Rose, 2011.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": {"142339": "First edition"}, "age": "6", "name": "Sphlag", "playingtime": "15", "boardgamemechanic": {"2046": "Area Movement"}, "average": "0", "usersrated": "0", "boardgamefamily": {"5902": "Marble Games"}}, "115552": {"statistics": {}, "name": "Arel Wars", "videogamemode": {"2149": "Single-Player"}, "videogameversion": {"142342": "iPhone edition"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1222548.png", "videogametheme": {"2337": "Cute Fantasy"}, "usersrated": "0", "average": "0", "videogamegenre": {"2339": "Action RPG"}, "videogameplatform": {"4443": "iPhone"}, "poll": {}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1222548_t.png", "description": "RPG action and defense strategy combine in AREL WARS!

The Green Eye of Zub was last located on the tenth planet and once the Eye is found, Zub has to return to the first planet to present the Eye of Zub to Emperor Zub.<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;Zub&quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "115572": {"boardgamedesigner": {"56557": {"name": "Antonio Aiazzi"}}, "poll": {}, "name": "Venezia & I Veneti: I Cicchetti", "playingtime": "45", "minplayers": "2", "yearpublished": "0", "usersrated": "0", "boardgamefamily": {"17740": "Cities: Venice"}, "maxplayers": "6", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1182335_t.png", "average": "0", "statistics": {}, "boardgamepublisher": {"5530": {"name": "Giochi Uniti"}}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1182335.png", "boardgameversion": {"142367": "English/Italian first edition"}, "maxplaytime": "45", "boardgamecategory": {"1094": {"name": "Educational"}}, "age": "4", "minplaytime": "45", "description": "Venezia &amp; I Veneti: I Cicchetti (aka, &quot;Venice and the Venetians&quot;) is a trivia game for kids to adults.

Teutonic Knights were in the village when Ded Moroz came to visit and the haughty knights openly mocked this &lsquo;old, hoary man&rsquo; representation of Morozko. Angry at the Teutonic Knights for mocking him, he froze them in their steps. One knight, little more than a squire escaped the freezing, however. He remained behind at the Order&rsquo;s camp to guard the supplies. By the time the adventure begins, he is becoming nervous and scared, working up the nerve to head into the town.<br/><br/>Morozko&rsquo;s anger did not stop with the Teutonic Knights; however, the god was infuriated that the town did not defend him against the knights. To teach the village a lesson, Morozko sent the worst winter ever to strike the village, and there is no promise of spring.<br/><br/>When the heroes arrive, they find the village and surrounding area covered in snow and the people clinging to life.<br/><br/>"}, "115653": {"statistics": {}, "name": "Food Network: Cook or Be Cooked", "videogamemode": {"2422": "Local Multiplayer"}, "videogameversion": {"142559": "North American Wii edition"}, "average": "0", "videogametheme": {"2624": "Food / Cooking"}, "usersrated": "0", "videogamegenre": {"2156": "Simulation"}, "videogameplatform": {"4441": "Wii"}, "poll": {}, "description": "Cook like a pro in the first video game from Food Network&trade;!<br/><br/>Cut, slice and dice your way through 30+ real recipes taught by the experts from Food Network .

Would we welcome the world of fantasy into our lives or would we fear its very presence?<br/><br/>Hearts of Chaos is a special introductory adventure for Amethyst. It was originally released in stores for Free RPG Day and is now available as a low-priced PDF. In this adventure, the characters are a small cell of a large international mercenary company, the Iron Sons. They have been handed a critical mission: A former Iron Sons colonel, Montgomery Cross, has gone rogue and vanished in the deep wilderness. He has information on cell locations and strengths, but&mdash;more importantly&mdash;the face of the Iron Sons highest ranking officer, General Chauk&mdash;a man with bounties for his arrest. Chauk believes this colonel to be a severe security risk, regardless of the state of his sanity. The characters are tasked with venturing into a no-man&rsquo;s land where few humans have been, finding this colonel, and killing him.<br/><br/>This journey takes the group deep into fantasy, where they encounter various fae monsters, suffer a vehicle breakdown, and fall under a pagus attack (a corrupted race of fae and loyal soldiers of darkness).<br/><br/>This is a complete, stand-alone adventure for Amethyst.

Poets declaim, lovers rendezvous, and rakes duel with wits and monoblades. Colonists settle virgin worlds, merchant princes vie for emerging markets, and free traders hawk their exotic wares. The Navy rules the jumplines, putting down pirates and charting new star systems. Scientists uncover startling new truths on long-dead worlds and posit revolutionary theories dizzying in their implications. Technology advances at a rapid pace, each year improving the lot of all who accept its boons. None dare deny the bright destiny Man has seized for himself.<br/><br/>It is a time of upheaval.<br/><br/>The inhabited galaxy-the Thousand Suns-teeters on the brink of chaos. Half a millennium since the Concord, and a generation since the bloody Civil War, the dynamism that ended the Age of Warring States is sorely tested. Diplomats try new gambits, shifting their ground for an unknown future. On dozens of worlds across known space, the lights are going out again and the process of decivilization begins anew. Despots and tyrants who would rather lord it over benighted backwaters than bend their knee to even a distant authority, arise once more. At the edges of explored space, rivals-both human and alien-watch and wait.<br/><br/>It is a time of glory.<br/><br/>Victorious fleets smash enemy armadas in distant star systems. Soldiers parade through liberated planets to alien cheers. Sector governors draw up breathtaking visions of terraforming and orbital cities. New jumplines open to the heart of unex- plored space, daring the bold to venture into the unknown for profit and peril. Surveyors stumble upon lost colonies and puzzle out the mysteries of inscrutable clades. Captains with blazing eyes save worlds from barbarism-and rule them as gods. Daring thieves turn new technologies to unexpected ends or sell them to shadowy cartels on the fringes of known space.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, bold operatives seek out these criminal plans for reprisal. Everything is possible with enough beauty, brains, or blasters, and it's all within reach of a single jump.<br/><br/>It is a time of adventure.<br/><br/><br/>The Thousand Suns: Rulebook is a complete 276-page science fiction roleplaying game consisting of 15 chapters that cover everything from character generation to starship combat to world and alien lifeform design.<br/><br/>Thousand Suns is a straightforward, flexible toolbox game that draws heavily on the &quot;imperial&quot; science fiction literature of the '50s, '60s, and '70s -- authors like Poul Anderson, Isaac Asimov, Bertram Chandler, Gordon Dickson, and H.

The first part, as everyone well knows, is centered on combat. Your character can wield dual weapons, cast deadly spells, come flying out of the shadows, and so on. This is the first part of the Dungeons &amp; Dragons experience. The second part is the role playing. Role playing is what your character does when they are not in an encounter, be it fighting an orc, solving an ancient puzzle, or disarming a trap. Role playing is what actually gives your character personality. It breathes that little spark of life into them that makes them more than a sheet full of numbers.<br/><br/>Consider your favorite fantasy novel. Now think about the main characters involved in that novel. As the story unfolds, the characters do much more than fight monsters. They explore their past, talk with each other, and interact with the world around them. Were that novel to be nothing more than back to back combat descriptions, it would probably get pretty boring. You would know nothing about that character. What are their likes? What are their dislikes? What do they do when they&rsquo;re not in combat? What were they like as children? Do they have any talents, aside from fighting? All these things help make a character a memorable one. Instead of telling your friends that your character can deliver 80 damage in one attack, you&rsquo;ll be able to tell them about how your character has overcome adversity in their youth, worked their way up to the status of hero, and are recognized wherever they go as someone who made a difference.<br/><br/>Presented here are a few different methods by which you can flesh out your character. Some are no more than the player writing up a description of their character&rsquo;s past, while others go very in-depth into a character&rsquo;s history, allowing them to hand-pick their family, their interests, their fears, and so on. Players and DMs alike are encouraged to use whatever methods work best for their game. If background history has little bearing on your game, then so be it. However, if having a virtually living, breathing character sounds more interesting, then read on.<br/><br/>"}, "115705": {"statistics": {}, "name": "Envoyer (Issue 94 - Aug 2004)", "rpgproducer": {"19936": "Christian Fischer"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1185434.jpg", "usersrated": "0", "average": "0", "rpgissue": {"5242": "Envoyer"}, "rpgissuearticle": {"70090": "BEHIND - Interview"}, "rpg": {"310": "Call of Cthulhu (2nd - 6th Edition)"}, "rpgissueversion": {"142651": "Softcover"}, "poll": {}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1185434_t.jpg", "description": "This issue contains:<br/><br/><br/>     Odyssee 2004 Con<br/>     Cthullu: Terror Britannicus (Review)<br/>     D&amp;D Complete Divine (Review)<br/>     Star Wars: Ultimate Adversaries (Review)<br/>     VG: X-BOX Wrath unleashed (Review)<br/>     DVD: Die Jugger (Review)<br/>     Bill Brown - composer (Review)<br/>     Heroquest - The Rolpayinggame (Adenture &quot;Das Werben von Enerin und Maniski&quot;)<br/>     Im Namen des Herren - preprint (Shadowrun Novel)<br/>     Die Weltretter - Versumpft (Comic)<br/>     BEHIND Tabletop (Interview)<br/>     Larp: G&ouml;ttliche Intervention und G&ouml;tter im Allgemeinem<br/>     Envoria: &quot;Von einer Zeit der Ver&auml;nderung&quot; Part 1<br/><br/><br/>"}, "115706": {"statistics": {}, "name": "Luminous Arc 2", "videogamemode": {"2422": "Local Multiplayer"}, "videogameversion": {"193891": "English/European Nintendo DS (Limited Edition) edition"}, "average": "7", "videogameseries": {"8547": "Luminous Arc"}, "videogametheme": {"2278": "Anime"}, "usersrated": "3", "videogamegenre": {"2414": "Tactical Role-Playing Game"}, "videogameplatform": {"4734": "Nintendo DS"}, "poll": {}, "description": "Description From Back of Case<br/><br/>As the threat of a rogue Witch looms over Carnava, the Queen calls upon the Magic Association to save the land.

From the ground, the PCs can&rsquo;t be sure, but it appears as though there is someone&hellip;or something&hellip;riding on the dragon.<br/><br/>The woman runs up to the PCs and tells them that she was attacked on the way into the city by &ldquo;devils from Hell&rdquo;, as she calls them. She said her husband was killed, as were her children. She says she was allowed to survive to warn the city that its end was drawing near. She tells the PCs that a large creature that looked like a giant skeleton with a long, scorpion-like tail told her that the portal to Hell had been re-opened, and revenge would be theirs.<br/><br/>The dragon makes one huge circle above the city, and then flies off to the north.

But the true hope of the Free Peoples lies with the quest of the Ringbearer: while the armies clash across Middle Earth, the Fellowship of the Ring is trying to get secretly to Mount Doom to destroy the One Ring. Sauron is not aware of the real intention of his enemies but is looking across Middle Earth for the precious Ring, so that the Fellowship is going to face numerous dangers, represented by the rules of The Hunt for the Ring. But the Companions can spur the Free Peoples to the fight against Sauron, so the Free People player must balance the need to protect the Ringbearer from harm, against the attempt to raise a proper defense against the armies of the Shadow, so that they do not overrun Middle Earth before the Ringbearer completes his quest.<br/><br/>Each game turn revolves around the roll of Action Dice: each die corresponds to an action that a player can do during a turn.

Strange Abominations have mysteriously appeared and unleashed legions of monsters on the helpless populace. To combat them, an organization known as the Order was established to study jewels and harness their power.

After two years of waiting, your family holds a memorial service and your partner is now returning to a social life as a single person.<br/><br/>Players must strike a balance between plundering the island&rsquo;s resources for points while ensuring they&rsquo;re not last off the island to face the worst news once home (and the most penalty points). Each day you&rsquo;ll beachcomb the golden sands to see what has been gifted to you from the azure, salty brine. Use this flotsam and jetsam, such as rusty cans and broken umbrellas, represented by chunky, 3D DriftCube shapes, to build a shelter, craft essential tools and a fishing spear; then explore deep into the island's heart. Link the same DriftCubes together on your playmat to &lsquo;build&rsquo; action grids, such as exploring, fishing, and foraging for food. In these instances DriftCube shapes represent time as opposed to raw materials.<br/><br/>It&rsquo;s a race for survival.

The streets are full of the brave and foolhardy, eager to draw steel and strike for little cause, and war between kingdoms is a constant occurrence.

Each city or town includes details on its population, overview, government, economy, military, temples, mages and sages, underworld, interesting sites, and special notes.<br/><br/>Chapter Eight: Independent Organizations presents several independent groups with influence over the population, including the slave-freeing Brotherhood of the Broken Chain, the oft-greedy Golden Alliance merchant's guild, the evil, power-hungry Secret Network of the Blue Salamander, and several more!<br/><br/>Chapter Nine: Languages details the naming conventions and languages of each major human and humanoid race.<br/><br/>Chapter Ten: The Gods of Tellene includes descriptions of each of the setting's 43 deities, whether good, unaligned, or evil. Each listing includes details on the deity itself (such as racial names, nicknames, spheres of influence, alignment, and symbol) and on the church and clerics (holy symbols, holy days, raiment, friends and allies, enemies, places of worship, advancement within the church hierarchy, and more).

Milestones largely occur according to the GM's discretion, and the frequency of their occurrence will do a lot to establish the overall tone and feel of a campaign&mdash;frequent milestones allow the characters to grow rapidly and give a sort of &quot;epic&quot; feel to the campaign as the opposition scales in response; infrequent milestones make things feel more grounded and established.<br/><br/>Milestones fall into three categories&mdash;minor, significant, and major. There are some guidelines for when each happens, along with what characters can do during each type of milestone.<br/><br/>"}, "115905": {"rpgitemversion": {"143116": "HTML version"}, "poll": {}, "name": "The Living City", "rpgproducer": {"3": "(Uncredited)"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1185595.png", "usersrated": "0", "average": "0", "statistics": {}, "rpg": {"26509": "Fate 3.0"}, "rpgcategory": {"2130": "Alternate Rules (Variant Core Rules)"}, "rpggenre": {"173": "Generic / Universal"}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1185595_t.png", "description": "User summary:<br/><br/>An IP-free version of Chapter Three, &quot;City Creation,&quot; from The Dresden Files Roleplaying Game, Volume 1: Your Story, made freely available on the faterpg.com website.<br/><br/>From Introduction:<br/><br/>When you sit down to play, you'll want to know the setting&mdash;which is to say, you'll want to come up with and flesh out the city in which your game takes place. Since it mostly takes place in today's urban jungles, this doesn't have to take a long time, as you're already pretty familiar with the way our world works.<br/><br/>(For crazy stuff like games taking place in the supernatural world or the like, read on&mdash;we've got you covered, too. We have a loose definition of &quot;city.&quot;)<br/><br/>There's a lot of stuff in this chapter. Our purpose is to give you lots of ideas and options. If you don't really want to immerse yourself in the process we lay out here, it's no big deal. While we still encourage you to read through the chapter so you see what we're going for, toward the tail end we provide an on-the-fly city creation technique that highlights the really critical parts, letting you get to the gaming faster. (If you do the full city creation process a few times, your own process will probably move toward that anyway as you learn which parts are the most useful for your group.) You should feel free to pick and choose the parts that look fun as you go along.<br/><br/>A city is much more than just a collection of streets and buildings&mdash;it's a world filled with people, including the players' characters and all the characters they might encounter. Creating your city includes mapping out both some of the physical locations and the relationships the people who live and work there have with the places and with each other. Once you're done with city creation, you should be ready to sit down and play.<br/><br/>"}, "115906": {"rpgitemversion": {"143117": "HTML version"}, "poll": {}, "name": "Stunts", "rpgproducer": {"3": "(Uncredited)"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1185594.png", "usersrated": "0", "average": "0", "statistics": {}, "rpg": {"26509": "Fate 3.0"}, "rpgcategory": {"2130": "Alternate Rules (Variant Core Rules)"}, "rpggenre": {"173": "Generic / Universal"}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1185594_t.png", "description": "User summary:<br/><br/>An IP-free version of Chapter Nine, &quot;Mortal Stunts,&quot; from The Dresden Files Roleplaying Game, Volume 1: Your Story, made freely available on the faterpg.com website.<br/><br/>From Introduction:<br/><br/>What Are Stunts?<br/><br/>Just enumerating a person's skills doesn't quite give you the full picture of what he's capable of. Most people have little tricks, advantages, or knacks that they pull out when they need a bit of something extra. We call these little knacks stunts.<br/><br/>What Stunts Do<br/><br/>Stunts exist to provide guaranteed situational benefits. These benefits might be the result of special training, unique (but non-supernatural) abilities, or something that's just innately cool about your character. A stunt may grant a character the ability to use a skill under unusual circumstances, using it in a broader array of situations than normal, substituting it for another skill, or using it in a complementary fashion to another skill. A stunt might allow a character to gain an effect roughly equal to two shifts used in a specific way or to otherwise grant other small effects. Put more simply, stunts allow the usual rules about skills to be bent&mdash;or even broken. We'll get into how to build your own stunts shortly.<br/><br/>Some stunts may have prerequisites (other stunts or even aspects). Particularly potent stunts may also require the use of a fate point to be activated. In general, a character should not take a stunt tied to a skill he does not have at least at Average level.<br/><br/>"}, "115907": {"rpgitemversion": {"143118": "HTML version"}, "poll": {}, "name": "Character Creation", "rpgproducer": {"3": "(Uncredited)"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1185593.png", "usersrated": "1", "average": "1", "statistics": {}, "rpg": {"26509": "Fate 3.0"}, "rpgcategory": {"2130": "Alternate Rules (Variant Core Rules)"}, "rpggenre": {"173": "Generic / Universal"}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1185593_t.png", "description": "User summary:<br/><br/>An IP-free version of Chapter Four, &quot;Character Creation,&quot; from The Dresden Files Roleplaying Game, Volume 1: Your Story, made freely available on the faterpg.com website.<br/><br/>From Introduction:<br/><br/><br/>Character Creation Is Play<br/><br/>Many roleplaying games propose a simple idea: you create characters, then you begin play. We think it&rsquo;s even simpler than that. We say, &ldquo;As you create the characters and the world they inhabit, you have begun play.&rdquo; The style of character creation we present here does three things to reinforce that.<br/><br/>First, character creation tells part of the characters&rsquo; stories, just like any other game session does. Characters that really come alive have histories of their own and with each other&mdash;character creation establishes where they&rsquo;ve been, what they&rsquo;ve done, and why they continue to act together against the threats they face. It&rsquo;s like there&rsquo;s a game that&rsquo;s been going on that you&rsquo;re now stepping into&mdash;it&rsquo;s just that the most interesting parts haven&rsquo;t happened yet.<br/><br/>Second, it sets the stage for the next part of the story. Each arc of a roleplaying game sets up the next, so that they flow into one another in a natural evolution of the story. Character creation needs to set up the first story arc the same way any other phase of play does.<br/><br/>Third, character creation in FATE is highly collaborative. As with city creation, character creation is best done as a group activity. Doing all of this together will build a stronger foundation for your characters and your game. The character creation process includes a number of built-in ways to establish connections between the characters and the setting. Combined with city creation, character creation can take a full session to do&mdash;this provides a good opportunity to lay out the basics of the setting and allows everyone to learn about it and about each others&rsquo; characters. This sort of collaborative story building is, in a word, play.<br/><br/>During character creation, you and the other members of your group will talk about your characters, make suggestions to each other, discuss how to make your characters connect, and even establish some of the campaign background. You&rsquo;ll want to keep good notes on this process.<br/><br/>You&rsquo;ll start by determining your character&rsquo;s high concept and trouble. Then you&rsquo;ll build your character&rsquo;s back-story, a process that takes place over five phases. Each phase outlines events in your character&rsquo;s life, though not necessarily in chronological order. The first phase sets up the character&rsquo;s general background, concept, and early history. The second covers the events that pull the character into the the setting of the specific game your group is playing. The last three phases delve into your character&rsquo;s past adventures&mdash;both his own and those of the other players&rsquo; characters.<br/><br/>"}, "115908": {"rpg": {"1789": "4e Game System Product (D&D 4.0 Compatible)"}, "statistics": {}, "name": "Dargrim Four-Fingers", "rpgproducer": {"6037": "Jeff Walker"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1185585.png", "usersrated": "0", "rpgitemversion": {"143119": "PDF version"}, "average": "0", "rpggenre": {"961": "Fantasy"}, "rpgcategory": {"2084": "Scenario / Adventure / Module"}, "poll": {}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1185585_t.png", "description": "From publisher blurb:<br/><br/>This is a fully developed D&amp;D 4E gaming aid designed as a sample of our writing and design style.

Like Power Stone, these stages have some level of interactivity. Players must then fight their opponents. Unlike other fighters, D.O.N uses a combined health gauge, that is, decreasing the health of one player will in turn increase the health of the other players. Thus, in order for one player to win a fight, they must make their own health bar take up the entire bar. As such, a fight can potentially last indefinitely if no time limit is set. Also, there are in-game techniques that can be pulled off (i.e. Kamehameha for Goku and Summoning Jutsu for Naruto) and supers that can transform the characters into a new form (i.e. Naruto's Rasengan turning him into the Kyuubi and Goku's Genki Dama turning him into Super Saiyan). In addition, some characters can induce a temporary transformation during the battle (i.e. Sasuke's Sharingan and Luffy's Gear 2nd).<br/><br/>The single player mode has the player fight through five rounds, 2 or 3 of which have missions with goals selected randomly. However, depending on the difficulty chosen by the player, different amounts of missions are given out with easy giving the least and very difficult giving out the most. Fulfilling the missions' goals rewards the player with coins that can be used in the slot machine available upon completing the fights. The slot machine is the way through which unlockables are obtained.<br/><br/>Up to four players can participate in a multiplayer session, though a multitap must be used for more than two players for the PS2 version.<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;Battle Stadium D.O.N&quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "115952": {"statistics": {}, "name": "BCV: Battle Construction Vehicles", "videogamemode": {"2422": "Local Multiplayer"}, "videogameversion": {"143243": "Europe PS2 edition"}, "average": "0", "videogametheme": {"2456": "Driving"}, "usersrated": "0", "videogamegenre": {"2159": "Fighting"}, "videogameplatform": {"4434": "PlayStation 2"}, "poll": {}, "description": "BCV: Battle Construction Vehicles, known in Japan as Kensetsu Juuki Kenka Battle: Buchigire Kongou!, is one of the first PlayStation 2 titles to be released in DVD-ROM format, rather than CD-ROM as most early PS2 titles were.<br/><br/>This is an odd fighting game, where you must battle in various construction vehicles, like a high-hoe or a front-end loader.

This is the first version of the music video game beatmania IIDX to be released in the United States.<br/><br/>The game uses the engine from the console version of Beatmania IIDX 9th Style, and was originally demonstrated with its original cyan and white UI, but the final release uses a reskinned version of it recolored purple. The judgement also has changed from the Japanese version, with the flashing &quot;Great!&quot; judgement being shown in the North American version as &quot;Perfect&quot;, much like in Dance Dance Revolution (recent versions of IIDX in Japan have referred to them as &quot;perfect greats&quot; in their &quot;judge mode&quot; display). The grading system in this game is also significantly easier than the Japanese games, requiring much lower scores to attain the highest grades.<br/><br/>Another change from the Japanese version of the game is the included controller has been modified slightly from the original Japanese version. The two controllers are similar in appearance. However, whereas the Japanese controller has a rectangular shape, the American controller features a rounded edge on the side where the turntable sits, and generally has a slightly lower profile. The keys on the American controller are also springloaded, whereas the Japanese controller's keys are not. This is presumably to prevent sticking, which is a common problem on the Japanese controller. Most players, American or Japanese, felt that the new American controller was a welcomed improvement, making the American controller the preferred choice.<br/><br/>The regular beatmania and beatmania IIDX modes correspond to their regular counterparts, and both feature songs and gameplay mechanics from their respective series integrated into the 9th Style engine (such as 5/10 and 7/14 keys, and the return of free scratch zones in 5-key mode). In contrast, recent IIDX games in Japan have had a 5-key mode selectable in an options menu on the song selection menu.<br/><br/>There are 58 tracks in this game (not counting the fact that 20, November is &quot;single mix&quot; on Single and &quot;radio edit&quot; on Double). All tracks are playable in Game Mode, and then in Free Mode after being played once in Game Mode. While there are no hidden songs, only a few are available when starting the game. More appear as the game progresses, but once the game is started again only those same few are available.<br/><br/>Because the Beatmania controller uses the standard PS2 controller connection, it was not originally compatible with the PlayStation 3. The release of PS3 firmware 1.70 and the Pelican PS3-to-PS2 adapter (which has also been said to work with Guitar Hero controllers and Dance Dance Revolution dance pads) fixes this issue.

The game features over 50 new songs, some of which can be unlocked using Konami's e-Amusement platform - which made its official debut on 9th Style.<br/><br/>The interface used by 9th Style is more modern and crisper looking than previous styles, taking advantage of the better graphics capabilities of the new PC based hardware which 9th Style now utilizes. The new hardware also eliminates the separate DVD player which was used on previous versions for background videos, as all the videos and data are now stored on the hard drive contained within the machine.<br/><br/>Core gameplay remained the same on 9th Style. 5-key mode has been removed and replaced by a separate 5-key modifier, which can be used on any song on any difficulty.<br/><br/>9th Style was the first version of Beatmania IIDX to use a new Windows XP PC-based platform nicknamed the Bemani PC instead of the PlayStation-based Bemani Twinkle hardware which had been used since the beginning of the series. The improved platform had its benefits, such as better graphics capabilities, network support through e-Amusement, larger storage, and background videos being stored on the hard drive along with the game data (dropping the need for a separate DVD player).  The new platform however, became blamed for a multitude of issues with 9th Style, such as longer load times and off-sync timing windows on some songs.<br/><br/>9th Style was the first version of IIDX to have support for Konami's new e-Amusement system, which can be used for the saving of stats and records to &quot;entry cards&quot;. The entry cards were magnetic cards usually containing game artwork, inserted into a card reader mounted on the sides of the cabinet, and protected by a 4-digit pin. The cards could save stats and scores in between games, allowing new features such as the ability to sort songs by a player's previous performance on it (by letter grades, clear status, or full combos). When connected to the internet, scores could also be uploaded to the internet, but unlike future implementations, this was entirely optional. 9th Style did not require a network connection for full e-Amusement compatibility, and thus could be used while offline too. 10th Style however, would require a network connection to use e-Amusement.<br/><br/>An extra stage can be earned for meeting specific criteria on the final stage. If the last stage is played on Another with Hard Mode enabled on any song rated a Flashing 7, and the player gets a AAA, the player is able to play PARANOiA survivor MAX by 290, well known as the boss song of DDR Extreme. If the stage is played on hard mode and an a grade of AAA is obtained, the player is forced to play One More Extra Stage, this song being Quasar by Outphase. On the PS2 version, getting an A is sufficient.<br/><br/>A home version of 9th Style was released in Japan for the PlayStation 2 on March 21, 2005. As with other IIDX home releases, it contains all the new songs from the Arcade version, revivals from older styles, and new songs. The home version also features higher quality graphics than previous versions, and S/PDIF audio output for higher quality sound. Of note, the console version of 9th Style does not suffer from the same timing issues as the Arcade version.<br/><br/>The engine and UI of 9th Style (but recolored Purple and Orange) was also used for the US release of Beatmania.<br/><br/>Notable songs from this version include:<br/><br/>Rislim ~remix~ - a remix of Rislim from 5th Style. The song is a subject of an unfunny inside joke in the IIDX community, involving a player's fondness for the song, and specific times on when to actually play it.<br/>    rottel-the-Mercury - a continuation of sampling masters MEGA's series of Rotterdam techno songs. The video contains many scenes of food preparation and fishing, creating a double meaning for the title (where Mercury can either be a planet in relation to their previous song rottel-the-sun, or a chemical sometimes found in fish)<br/>    PARANOiA survivor MAX - well known as the hardest song on the then-recently released DDR Extreme. The song is one of several crossovers from Extreme that are present on 9th Style. It is also the first Extra Stage song to be removed on later arcades, as it was removed on Beatmania IIDX 14: Gold.<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;Beatmania IIDX 9th Style&quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "115982": {"statistics": {}, "name": "Igor The Game (DS)", "videogamemode": {"2422": "Local Multiplayer"}, "videogameversion": {"143311": "English/European Nintendo DS edition"}, "average": "0", "videogametheme": {"2265": "Horror"}, "usersrated": "0", "videogamegenre": {"2165": "Puzzle"}, "videogameplatform": {"4734": "Nintendo DS"}, "poll": {}, "description": "He always had a hunch he could change the world...<br/><br/>Join Igor, Eva, Scamper, and Brain as they quest through the Kingdom of Malaria.

As suggested by the title, IIDXRED's color scheme is red and black, and was one of the first versions to not use the word &quot;style&quot; to denote its version and have a legitimate theme (a pattern that would continue on later versions).<br/><br/>Core gameplay remains the same on IIDX RED. A new rating, a flashing 8 was added to the difficulty scale. The unused side of the screen during single player play is now used to house a score graph, containing a real-time comparison of the current player against the high scores.<br/><br/>IIDX RED was the first version of IIDX to require the network for unlocking songs. Unfortunately, this move is seen as an issue for importers of IIDX machines as e-Amusement is not available outside of Japan. e-Amusement can also pull score for a player on a song onto the score graph over the network.

The game also features 2 songs from the US Beatmania game (Toxic and You Really Got Me) with new Another charts. One of the revivals, Gambol, received an Another chart, although it is rated an 8 - it is exactly the same as the Light7 and 7KEYS charts, with the only differences between the difficulty levels being increasingly strict timing windows, with Another containing very strict timing windows.

Happy Sky introduced several small but significant changes to the series, such as a new difficulty scale, and a new boss song.<br/><br/>Core gameplay remained the same on Happy Sky. Songs are now ranked on a 12-point rating scale, with the difficulties being renamed in the process as well. &quot;LIGHT7/14&quot; is now Normal and &quot;7/14KEYS&quot; is now Hyper. All songs have been readjusted to fit the new ranking scales. A new folder called &quot;HARD CLEAR&quot; has also been added to the song selection screen for songs cleared using the Hard mode modifier, it is considered to be of higher value than a Full Combo.<br/><br/>Two new modifiers have been added, Hidden+ and Sudden+, which allows the user to adjust a lane cover to cover up a specific portion of the screen. This had been popularly done with towels beforehand, acknowledged by Konami in the PS2 version of Gold, which offers a picture of a towel as one of the lane cover options.<br/><br/>Happy Sky was the last version of IIDX to support the old styled e-Amusement cards, as Distorted would switch to the new &quot;e-Amusement Pass&quot; system. A cell phone application called &quot;IIDX WAVE&quot; could customize the interface of Happy Sky, with different menu music options, different frames for the gameplay interface, and being able to create custom courses.<br/><br/>If the player gets AA's on all stages (with all 3 stages being played on Hard Mode and on Another difficulty, and the final stage being a 10), the player is awarded a chance to play the extra stage, where Scream Squad by Calf is offered. If a AAA is scored and the stage is played on Hard Mode, the player gets to play One More Extra Stage, \u51a5 (Mei) by Amuro vs Killer, a song rated 12 on Another.  Mei, the OMES of Happy Sky, is known for its Another chart, which is rated 12 on Another and contains exactly 2000 notes. It is considered one of the hardest songs in IIDX history. Xepher gained more exposure outside of IIDX when it was one of several new IIDX crossovers featured on Dance Dance Revolution SuperNOVA, and later as part of a set of Bemani crossover unlocks on Toy's March 2 (which also included Mei). Scripted Connection sounds slightly different on each difficulty level, thus having 3 different &quot;versions&quot;. DJ Murasame stated in a &quot;bio&quot; page for the song on Konami's Happy Sky microsite, that the 3 different versions could be played together one after the other at once, and suggested a situation where all 3 versions could be played sequentially using 3 IIDX cabinets next to each other. The console version of Happy Sky would later include all 3 variations playable separately, and a long mix of all 3.<br/><br/>A home version of Happy Sky was released in Japan for the PlayStation 2 and  includes 9 new songs, plus an unlockable &quot;long mix&quot; of Scripted Connection. The home version also features unlockable customization features and artwork.<br/><br/>The original soundtrack for Happy Sky was released on October 19, 2005.

Distorted's interface is a refresh of Happy Sky's interface, but using a monotone color scheme with orange wireframe patterns in menu backgrounds.<br/><br/>Of note, Distorted was the first arcade version of IIDX to be officially exhibited in North America, making an appearance at E3 2006 alongside GuitarFreaks V2 in response to low sales of the US PS2 version and the debut of a sequel to a game which overshadowed its release, Guitar Hero II. An English build of the next version was ultimately beta tested but not officially released.<br/><br/>Core gameplay remained the same on Distorted, but with several minor additions, such as the ability to change the High Speed setting used in-song by holding down the start button. Double and 2-player notecharts can now be flipped (so that the 1P side would be on the 2P side instead and vice-versa. In addition), High Speed 4.5 and 5.0 options have been added.<br/><br/>Distorted switched the e-Amusement system to the new standardized e-Amusement Pass system. e-Amusement was also required to save progress in the new extra stage system, the Cardinal Gate.<br/><br/>Unlike previous versions of IIDX, Distorted features 4 different extra stages in a setup known as the Cardinal Gate. The system is based on the Four Symbols in Chinese mythology. The 4 main songs are identified by their artists in the menu, and are done under aliases of the main IIDX artists. The 4 songs are Contract by \u6731\u96c0 (Suzaku), Ganymede by \u7384\u6b66 (Genbu), waxing and wanding by \u9752\u9f8d (Seiryuu), and \u83ef\u8776\u98a8\u96ea (Kachoufuusetsu) by \u767d\u864e (Byakko). The One More Extra Stage for Distorted is \u5606\u304d\u306e\u6a39 (Nageki no Ki) by \u91d1\u7345\u5b50 (Kinjishi). The OMES is accessed by A'ing all the other songs on Another with Hard Mode enabled.<br/><br/>To access it, one must get a B or higher on the first stage, and get another B or higher on the second stage (with the second song being of equal of higher difficulty than the first). On the last stage, the player must either full combo a 5 or 6 leveled song, finish a level 7 song with a full Groove Gauge, or pass any song with an 8 or higher.<br/><br/>The system is not used on machines in &quot;beat#2&quot; mode (which unlocks all songs). All of the Cardinal Gate song feature different frames for the gameplay interface. When a Cardinal Gate song was beaten, its corresponding frame would be unlocked to use in regular play using Konami's IIDX mobile site.<br/><br/>Notable songs from this version include:<br/><br/>Zenius -I- vanisher - a Cyber Opus song by Tatsh. The song's name is shared by a recently established Bemani fansite, and the end of the video hints about a possible sequel to the song on a later mix.<br/>    iFUTURELIST - a song by Akira Yamaoka, the lead single and title track of his newest album.<br/>    Go Beyond!! - one of the several exclusive songs found on the Console version of DistorteD, by Ryu\u2606 and S\u014dta Fujimori. The song is a Level 12 song on Another, which is known to have a complicated middle section.<br/>    \u5606\u304d\u306e\u6a39 (Nageki no ki) - The OMES of DistorteD, this song is the 2nd in IIDX history to have exactly 2000 notes, with the 1st being \u51a5 (Mei) in Happy Sky.<br/><br/>The PlayStation 2 version of Distorted was released in Japan on August 30, 2007. It contains all the new songs from Distorted (except one, SAMBA DE JANEIRO), 12 new songs, a selection of revived tracks, a preview song from Gold, and in honor of the 10th anniversary of Beatmania, 6 songs from the original 5-key beatmania series. The training mode on Distorted CS also features the Regul-Speed modifier option.<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;Beatmania IIDX 13: Distorted&quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "115987": {"statistics": {}, "name": "Beatmania IIDX 14: Gold", "videogamemode": {"2422": "Local Multiplayer"}, "videogameversion": {"143333": "Japanese Arcade edition"}, "average": "0", "videogameseries": {"4821": "beatmania IIDX"}, "videogametheme": {"2316": "Music"}, "usersrated": "0", "videogamegenre": {"2163": "Rhythm"}, "videogameplatform": {"4781": "Arcade"}, "poll": {}, "description": "Beatmania IIDX 14: Gold (stylized as beatmania IIDX14: GOLD) is the 14th game in the beatmania IIDX series of music video games.  The game features over 45 new songs, some of which are unlocked over Konami's e-Amusement platform. The game instituted another hardware change for IIDX, now running on more powerful hardware using Windows XP Embedded as its operating system.<br/><br/>The user interface features a predominantly metallic appearance, with gold and silver accents throughout.<br/><br/>Core gameplay remained the same on Gold. A new hidden modifier, &quot;REGUL-SPEED&quot;, locks the BPM of a song to a constant 150, but scores achieved with it turned on are not recorded. In addition, a new song folder was added, Assist Clear, for songs which were cleared using the 5-Key or Auto Scratch modifiers. Gold also utilizes less strict timing windows than previous arcade releases, utilizing more CS-like timings. Also, the ability for 2 players to play on separate difficulties was added.<br/><br/>A new e-Amusement feature added to Gold are &quot;GP&quot;, points earned during songs which can unlock secret songs such as console exclusives and revival songs from previous styles.<br/><br/>If the player gets three AA's on any difficulty (without use of the Random or Mirror modifiers) and the levels for all the songs add up to either 20 for Hyper or 30 for Another, the player is awarded a chance to play the extra stage, Vanessa by \u6731\u96c0 (Suzaku). The stage is played on Hard mode, which removes the 80% groove gauge requirement, but will fail the player if it drops down to 0%. If the stage is cleared, the player gets to play One More Extra Stage, Fascination MAXX, a crossover from the then recently released Dance Dance Revolution SuperNova.<br/><br/>An additional extra stage-like system added to Gold through e-Amusement is the VIP Room, an extension on the system introduced by Distorted's &quot;Cardinal Gate&quot; system. To access the VIP Room, the player must play 30 songs on one difficulty, then pay 1700 GP. This unlocks the Silver Room, containing GOLD RUSH by DJ Yoshitaka-G feat. Michael a la mode.<br/><br/>Clearing 60 songs on one difficulty, then clearing GOLD RUSH with an A in hard mode, plus another payment of 1700 GP unlocks the Gold Room, containing CANDY GALY by Risk Junk-G.<br/><br/>Clearing 90 songs, 5 songs from IIDX Records on the same difficulty, clearing CANDY GALY with an A or higher in hard mode, and another payment of 1700 GP unlocks the Platinum Room, which contains \u96fb\u4eba\u3001\u6681\u306b\u6583\u308c\u308b\u3002 (Denjin, Dead at Dawn) by L.E.D-G. An additional OMES in the Black Room was Sense 2007 by good-cool.<br/><br/>The VIP Room system was later dropped as all songs were later unlocked for regular play on e-Amusement connected machines. All songs contain different frames for the gameplay UI in their room's color.<br/><br/>Notable songs from this version include:<br/><br/>GOLD RUSH - a song accessed through the VIP Room system. The song is an extended remix of Gold's opening theme by DJ Yoshitaka, with additional vocals provided by &quot;Michael a la Mode&quot;, and a middle breakdown containing a naming of all the IIDX versions in order of release. The song gained a cult following in IIDX online communities due to Michael's incomprehensible but booming vocals, and lines from the song have often become memes. Michael a la Mode as a character has appeared in other roles due to his popularity among fans, such as hosting the Tutorial mode in future versions, and later appearing in a B4U remix.<br/>    TRANOID - a tribute to video game music. The video for the song contains an opening sequence for a fictitious game of the same name, starring &quot;Tran&quot;, an alien character seen frequently in IIDX videos. The actual game, consists of her running down a track (which resembles the gameplay area of IIDX but tilted on its side), dodging other red, white, and blue aliens. The &quot;game&quot;, is actually Tranoid's notechart on Normal for that portion of the song, and the game area and colors even imitate the standard colors of notes on IIDX. The logo for the game, resembles the logo for Gradius, another Konami game.<br/>    The Smile of You - the theme song from the Konami game Elebits, which coincidentally also includes references to other Bemani games in general.<br/>    Golden Cross, a techno song by DJ REMO-CON and dj TAKA, and one of the collaborations on the console version of Gold. The song is the toughest out of the new songs on Gold CS, with its another chart being ranked a 12 and containing a total of 1765 notes. The video features several of the musicians in a show named &quot;Yoshitaka no Shogi&quot; (a parody of Hikaru no Go, another television program based around a Japanese board game).<br/>    Sense 2007 - a song accessed through the VIP Room system. Sense 2007's normal difficulty is rated a 9, making it the hardest normal difficulty in IIDX history.<br/><br/>The home version of Beatmania IIDX 14: Gold for the PlayStation 2 was released on May 29, 2008. The console version includes new songs such as 6 collaborations with IIDX regulars, 6 unlockable songs, and revivals of older songs from other IIDX versions and from the original 5-key Beatmania series, a total of 96 songs.<br/><br/>Two songs from the Kaiden course in Class mode, Vanessa and Kamaitachi, feature new Another charts only playable on the course, which are more difficult than their original charts. As with other recent PS2 styles, the game also contains unlockable interface items, such as different menu music, category announcers, additional lane covers for the Sudden+ modifier, and discs for the turntable icon in gameplay.<br/><br/>The original videos of Last Message and Sense 2007 (which are infamous for containing scenes of sexually provocative imagery, were replaced with generic videos on Gold CS due to stricter age certification processes by the CERO and a desire to keep the game A-rated, although Last Message's video was included on the console version of 7th Style (which does not have a CERO rating). On the contrast, \u661f\u3092\u3053\u306e\u624b\u306b now has a dedicated video, and Metallic Mind now has overlays featuring Hihumi, the mascot of the game.<br/><br/>Some pre-order bundles for the game also include the &quot;Beatnation Summit&quot; DVD, the artwork book &quot;Puzzle - Maya Takamura's Pieces&quot;, and L.E.D's album, Denjin K.<br/><br/>Gold was the first version of Beatmania IIDX to have a dedicated English build for the North American market. As with other music video games, Japanese IIDX machines have been imported by some arcades, but are still considered rare. This is not the first time a Beatmania IIDX game has been released in North America though, as a Beatmania game based on 9th Style, featuring songs from IIDX, and the original Beatmania games, were released for the PlayStation 2 in 2006. These did not have an arcade counterpart.<br/><br/>The build was first seen at a location test at Brunswick Zone Naperville in Naperville, Illinois. Most of the instructions in the interface was translated into English, though Dan mode was untranslated, and song titles were not translated or romanized (although the LED marquee does show titles in a romanized format on all styles by default). The English build of IIDX Gold was never released.<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;Beatmania IIDX 14: Gold&quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "115988": {"statistics": {}, "name": "Beatmania IIDX 15: DJ Troopers", "videogamemode": {"2422": "Local Multiplayer"}, "videogameversion": {"143338": "Japanese Arcade edition"}, "average": "0", "videogameseries": {"4821": "beatmania IIDX"}, "videogametheme": {"2316": "Music"}, "usersrated": "0", "videogamegenre": {"2163": "Rhythm"}, "videogameplatform": {"4781": "Arcade"}, "poll": {}, "description": "Beatmania IIDX 15: DJ Troopers is the 15th game in the beatmania IIDX series of music video games.  The game features over 50 new songs, some of which are unlocked over Konami's e-Amusement platform. The overall motif of DJ Troopers is a military themed style, containing rustic greens, grays, and camouflage patterns.<br/><br/>Core gameplay remains the same on DJ Troopers. A new hidden modifier called &quot;ALL-SCRATCH&quot; changes most of the notes to scratches. In addition, a new tutorial mode has been added featuring interactive tutorials on basic gameplay elements, which is presented by Michael a la Mode, the vocalist from GOLD RUSH from the previous style (who is visually portrayed as a young short-haired man with sunglasses and a &quot;Beatnation Records&quot; t-shirt). In addition, tweaks to 5-key mode have been made, using the right-side of the keyboard on the 2P side instead of the first 5 keys.<br/><br/>New cabinets produced after the launch of DJ Troopers also feature slight changes, such as a LCD monitor rather than a CRT monitor, and new artwork on the transducer platform.<br/><br/>If the player gets three AA's on two songs rated 8 and a song rated 9 (without use of the Random or Mirror modifiers) for Hyper or the total difficulties of the 3 AA'd songs adding up to 31 for Another, the player gets to play the Extra Stage, Time to Air by \u9752\u9f8d (Seiryu). The stage is played on Hard mode, which removes the 80% groove gauge requirement, but will fail the player if it drops down to 0%. If the stage is cleared with an AAA and the player is playing on Another, the player gets to play One More Extra Stage, PARANOiA ~HADES~ by &alpha;TYPE-300, a crossover from the recently released Dance Dance Revolution SuperNOVA 2.<br/><br/>An additional extra stage system used on DJ Troopers for e-Amusement users is Military Splash, an extension of the VIP Room concept from Gold. The system is divided into 2 tiers, one containing 3 songs and a One More Extra Stage, and the other containing 4 plus another One More Extra Stage, aptly titled Military Splash #02. The songs contained on the first tier are Mirage Residence by Jimmy Weckl, &Uuml;bertreffen by dj TAKA, TRIP MACHINE PhoeniX by DE-SIRE alterative, and the One More Extra Stage, TROOPERS by Des-TRACT. When Military Splash is unlocked, an option appears when an Extra Stage is unlocked in Standard mode, allowing access to it instead of a regular Extra Stage.<br/><br/>To unlock Military Splash, the player must meet the criteria for any one of the 3 songs. The first tier of songs are based on the BEMANI series, with contributions from GuitarFreaks/DrumMania, Pop'n Music, And DanceDanceRevolution, respectively. To unlock Mirage Residence the player must get a Border Bonus (a pass with exactly 80% on the Groove Gauge) or Perfect Bonus (getting all Greats and Flashing Greats). To unlock &Uuml;bertreffen, one must play a specific number of new songs. To unlock TRIP MACHINE PhoeniX, the player must play 2 songs from every song folder with an A or higher without using 5-key or Autoscratch. To access TROOPERS, the player must AA all the previous songs.<br/><br/>The second tier of songs, &quot;Military Splash #02&quot; in a similar fashion to the Cardinal Gate songs on Distorted, are under pseudonyms of major IIDX artists. These 4 songs are Do it!! Do it!! by Kraken (Ryu\u2606), Steel Needle by Scorpion (L.E.D.), four pieces of heaven by Lion (dj TAKA), and ICARUS by Eagle (kors k). The OMES for #02 is MENDES by Humanoid (DJ Yoshitaka). The background animations for these songs are similar to final bosses in arcade shooting games - there is an &quot;HP bar&quot; at the top that represents the number of notes left in the song in Another mode.<br/><br/>The PlayStation 2 version of DJ Troopers was released in Japan on December 18, 2008. New songs include collaborations, smooooch \u30fb&forall;\u30fb from the recently released Beatmania IIDX 16: Empress as a preview song, along with revivals from past styles.<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;Beatmania IIDX 15: DJ Troopers&quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "115989": {"statistics": {}, "name": "Beatmania IIDX 16: Empress", "videogamemode": {"2422": "Local Multiplayer"}, "videogameversion": {"143344": "Japanese Arcade edition"}, "average": "0", "videogameseries": {"4821": "beatmania IIDX"}, "videogametheme": {"2316": "Music"}, "usersrated": "0", "videogamegenre": {"2163": "Rhythm"}, "videogameplatform": {"4781": "Arcade"}, "poll": {}, "description": "Beatmania IIDX 16: Empress is the 16th game in the Beatmania IIDX series of music video games. It was released in arcades by Konami on November 19, 2008 (11 months since the arcade release of Beatmania IIDX 15: DJ Troopers). The game features over 50 new songs, some of which are unlocked over Konami's e-Amusement platform. The design of Empress's interface is based on a pink color scheme, dominated by sparkles, butterfly wings, and motifs of royalty and jewellery. A PlayStation 2 port for the game was released on October 15, 2009, simultaneously in Japan and South Korea.<br/><br/>Core gameplay remains the same on Empress. A new hidden modifier called &quot;ALL-SCRATCH&quot; changes most of the notes to scratches. More tutorials have been added to the Tutorial mode from DJ Troopers. Many sound effects in the user interface have also been changed. A new mode that is introduced before DJ Troopers CS, &quot;Hazard Mode&quot;, instantly fails the player if a combo is broken many times (effectively requiring a full combo in order to pass the stage). To access this mode, All the black buttons must be pushed (When highlighting Free mode in mode selection) to activate the Hazard mode.<br/><br/>The upgrade to Empress also comes with a new turntable design, which has been built to be easier to trigger, and also features a more textured surface.  More advanced statistics can be accessed through e-Amusement's online components. Jewels can be collected for the Empress Place system using e-Amusement.<br/><br/>Empress Place is the extra stage system used by Empress. During regular play, players randomly accumulate colored jewels (the algorithm has not been disclosed). These jewels are used to unlock the 3 songs, each song representing a famous empress. The 3 songs are Kung-fu Empire by \u98db\u71d5\u6d41\u821e (Consort Yang Yuhuan), Arabian Rave Night by dj MAX STEROID (Cleopatra), and Marie Antoinette by Marguerite du Pre {Marie Antoinette}. When all songs have been cleared with AAA rating using HARD option and the player is playing on ANOTHER, then the player will have opportunity to play the One More Extra Stage, \u5351\u5f25\u547c by \u6731\u96c0 VS \u7384\u6b66 {Himiko}.<br/><br/>The home version was released on October 15, 2009. Unlike previous home version, the home version of Beatmania IIDX 16: Empress contain two discs. The first one is the EMPRESS disc, which contains songs from the arcade version, home version-originals, and some revivals. The second, called PREMIUM BEST disc, contains the rest of the revivals which selected from the whole Beatmania IIDX games. Each disc contains 99 songs, adding the total to 198 songs. It is speculated to be the final release of home version of Beatmania IIDX, because no home version was released after this game.<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;Beatmania IIDX 16: Empress&quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "115990": {"statistics": {}, "name": "Imagine: Fashion Party", "videogamemode": {"2422": "Local Multiplayer"}, "videogameversion": {"143350": "Australian Wii edition"}, "average": "0", "videogametheme": {"2466": "Other"}, "videogamegenre": {"2156": "Simulation"}, "videogamefranchise": {"5561": "Imagine"}, "videogameplatform": {"4441": "Wii"}, "usersrated": "0", "poll": {}, "description": "-    Hit the runway with your friend and compete in the ultimate Fashion Reality Show.<br/>-    Express your creativity in numerous workshops including Hair, Makeup, Clothing, and Accessories.<br/>-    Make all the right moves with the Wii Remothe and Nunchuk as youmodel your designs in front of a fierce panel of judges.<br/><br/>Source: The Publisher Website.<br/><br/>"}, "115991": {"statistics": {}, "name": "Imagine: Party Babyz", "videogamemode": {"2149": "Single-Player"}, "videogameversion": {"143351": "North American Wii edition"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2038227.jpg", "videogametheme": {"2428": "Minigame Compilation"}, "videogamegenre": {"2338": "Party"}, "average": "4", "videogamefranchise": {"5561": "Imagine"}, "videogameplatform": {"4441": "Wii"}, "usersrated": "1", "poll": {}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2038227_t.jpg", "description": "Play as a babysitter and attend a famous babysitting academy.
