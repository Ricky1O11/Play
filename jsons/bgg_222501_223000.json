Your story. You are an unknown football expert like everyone else. But you got the chance to run a club. A very small club, of course. But hey, you got to start at the bottom. <br/>Club Stories is a game for 1 or 2 players. You play solo or co-op. You try to defeat the 5 different scenario&lsquo;s in the right order. Every next scenario has it&lsquo;s own story. If you win it, you move on to the next scenario. You may move on to a bigger club. Of course you can also replay the scenario&lsquo;s to defeat your high score and reach higher levels of professionalism.<br/>The goal of every scenario is to reach a certain level. In the 1st scenario you have to reach the level of unexperienced professional manager. If you earn enough manager points during season (respect) you win the scenario. But every scenario has different season goals. Reaching these goals, may help you earn the manager points. For example, In the 1st scenario you try to prevend relegation, in the 2nd you try to get rid of all the corruption and in the 5th scenario you want to finish your new stadium in time. <br/>The game is played over 8-10 rounds, depending on which scenario you play. Every turn you use 6 dice to plan your actions. There is a realistic push-your-luck system in the game which fits to the theme very well. You can push your chance up to 100%.<br/>Your turn always starts with a board meeting. Your 3 board members will make a decision about a dilemma. Choose your board members well, because they have different opinions about a football club. You may want to attend the meeting and use your dice to influence decisions. After this, you plan your actions. Hire players, staff, send scouts to watch opponents or players, train tactics, hire a sponsor, etc. <br/>You try to keep the markers on the 4 tracks on the board(income, fitness, morale and popularity) as high as possible. otherwise, bad things may happen. For example, if your morale is low, your players may get suspended more often. After planning your actions, you choose tactics, select your team and play the match. If your form is high, you may end up high in the league. But bigger clubs will be intested in your players more often. Can you convince them to stay?

Although the game contains a lot of snippets of text describing basic environmental problems and solutions around Senegal, the actual game play is language independent producing simple, thematically imaginable situations which the players can use as a node of thought for discussions and learning.<br/><br/>During the game, players move their pawns around a highly abstracted map and use combinations of knowledge cards in three colours to remove corresponding combinations of problem markers from affected areas. Starting with just one card, players can acquire new ones by collecting enough markers from the map or by going to the education center. The three different colours represent three generic categories of issues: water, the natural environment and human activities.<br/><br/>Because the problems are often too complicated or become too large, players need to work together and plan their turns carefully so that their characters can work together in the game and share their knowledge and effort in the most effective way. Due to the randomly allocated problem markers giving players new objectives and blocking movement on the map, the game is constantly presenting small, changing spatial puzzles for players to solve. Separate game sessions can develop in very different ways and provide varied narratives to think about.<br/><br/>Players win the game by removing all the larger problems from the map or by each player collecting enough knowledge cards so that everyone is prepared for the future. The players lose if all the villages on the map are covered with problem markers or if too many larger problems accumulate anywhere on the map. Woomal could be described as a very simple version of Pandemic, played on a grid of hexagons.<br/><br/>"}, "222591": {"poll": [], "name": "OutDrive", "videogamemode": ["Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["Windows downloadable release"], "average": "0", "videogametheme": ["Driving", "Music"], "usersrated": "0", "videogamedeveloper": ["(Self-Developed Video Game)"], "videogamegenre": ["Arcade", "Survival"], "videogameplatform": ["Windows"], "statistics": [], "videogamepublisher": ["Siberian Digital"], "description": "User Summary<br/>Your girlfriend is dying and your car gives her artificial life support - she only lives as long as you drive while she trips on the awesome neon landscapes to the Retowawe/Synthwawe music playing.<br/><br/>Developped by Denver Productions (first production)<br/><br/><br/><br/>"}, "222592": {"poll": [], "name": "Tug-A-War", "videogamemode": ["Hotseat", "Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["Amiga type-in release", "Apple II type-in release", "Atari 8-bit type-in release", "Atari ST type-in release", "Commodore 64 type-in release", "DOS type-in release", "TI-99 type-in release"], "average": "0", "videogametheme": ["Abstract", "Sports - Other"], "usersrated": "0", "videogamedeveloper": ["(Unknown)"], "videogamegenre": ["Classic Games", "Strategy"], "videogameplatform": ["Amiga", "Apple II", "Atari 8-bit family", "Atari ST", "Commodore 64", "DOS", "TI-99"], "statistics": [], "videogamepublisher": ["Compute!

Publications"], "description": "From publishing magazine<br/>&quot;Prisonball&quot; is a two-player action game that combines the best elements from two classic computer games, Pong and Breakout. The object of the game is simple&mdash;knock out as many bricks as you can in the allotted time. Type in Prisonball from the listing for your computer; then save a copy of the program before you try to run it. Every version of the game is similar, so be sure to read the general game rules before referring to the specific notes for your computer.<br/><br/>Break To The Center<br/>The game begins by displaying five colored walls running vertically down the center of the screen. Each player controls two paddles located at the left and right sides of the screen. Three balls appear at a random location and start bouncing around the screen. When a ball is on your side of the screen, move one of your paddles into its path to deflect the ball toward the walls. You can only hit a ball when it's moving toward your paddles (away from the interior walls). Balls travelling from the opposite direction go right through your paddles. If you happen to miss a ball, it wraps around the screen and appears on the other side, giving your opponent a chance to score.<br/><br/>At the beginning of the game, all three balls are a neutral color. Each time you hit a ball, it changes to the color of your paddle. You score whenever a ball of your color hits one of the five interior<br/>walls. The score depends on which wall you hit. The center wall is the hardest to reach, so it yields the most points. The two intermediate walls are worth less than the center wall. The outermost walls are easiest to hit and score the fewest points.<br/><br/>The top of the screen displays each player's score and a countdown timer. When the timer runs to zero, the game ends and the player with the most points wins.<br/><br/>Every time a ball hits one of the walls, a brick is knocked out of the wall at the point of impact. By aiming your shots carefully, you can bore a path through a wall and move a ball into the interior space between two walls. When this happens, the all bounces wildly back and forth between the walls, scoring many points in a short time.<br/><br/>An additional bit of strategy has to do with the redrawing of walls. Whenever wall has been destroyed, it is immediately redrawn. Some of the highest scores result when you trap one or more balls behind a wall when it is redrawn. Since the wall is new, the trapped balls may hit it many times before they break back out to the exterior.<br/><br/>"}, "222596": {"rpgartist": ["Elisha Allard", "Azzedar Ranthalion"], "rpg": ["Pathfinder System Compatible Product"], "statistics": [], "name": "Racial Repository: The Lagos", "rpgdesigner": ["Kristopher Kruz"], "rpgproducer": ["Troy Daniels", "Rick Hershey", "Lucus Palosaari"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3452042.jpg", "usersrated": "0", "rpgitemversion": ["PDF version"], "average": "0", "rpggenre": ["Animal (Anthropomorphic)", "Fantasy (High Fantasy)"], "rpgpublisher": ["Fat Goblin Games"], "rpgcategory": ["Sourcebook (rules/options to enhance play)"], "poll": [], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3452042_t.jpg", "description": "From publisher blurb:<br/><br/>Just don&rsquo;t call them bunnies!<br/><br/>The Lagos are a race of nomadic humanoid hares that spend their lives in tight-knit, but flighty, family packs called droves!

If they fail to reach their bid, they gain ZERO points!<br/><br/>2) When you win a trick you may choose to keep either the winning card or a card from the meadow (community pool) to add to your personal garden (tableau). The player with the most total points in their garden at the end of the round gains 2 points.<br/><br/>3) There are up to 5 suits being used during play. The lower the value of the card, the more fruit it produces. This rewards players for winning tricks with lower-valued cards because another way to score points is to collect the majority of each suit type. For each majority you have the highest sum in, you gain a bonus point.<br/><br/>4) Finally, a player may gain an additional bonus point for collecting a card from each different suit into their personal garden.<br/><br/>There are other strategic choices to be made as well. When to use a Raven Card is important as it allows you to take two cards into your garden instead of one.<br/><br/>Before bidding takes place, each player must draft a suit to become their trump suit. Once a player has their cards in hand, and have examined them, they must choose a suit that will be most advantageous for them in that round. The suit become their personal trump suit, meaning that if they cannot follow suit during play, they can trump using any card from their chosen suit. No two players can have the same trump suit, making the game both entertaining and balanced.<br/><br/>"}, "222638": {"poll": [], "name": "Chess3D", "videogamemode": ["Local Multiplayer", "Network Multiplayer", "Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["Windows Downloadable edition"], "average": "0", "videogametheme": ["Board Game"], "usersrated": "0", "videogamedeveloper": ["Whitefishgames"], "videogamegenre": ["Classic Games"], "videogameplatform": ["Windows"], "statistics": [], "videogamepublisher": ["SW-Winsoft"], "description": "User Summary<br/><br/>Classic chess game in 3D.

The play combines negotiation and placement. Players take it in turn to place a 'Peep', which is a wooden or acrylic game piece with several connections, in the play area. They may then, also flip or move another player's piece. Flipping a piece down prevents it from scoring. However, a piece that has been flipped face down, may be flipped face up with some help from other Peeps, restoring its value. A piece may also be moved from one area to another. A player may never move their own pieces, and a piece may only be moved if it will not cause a discontinuity in the connected pieces already in play. The player with the most points at the end of the game wins.<br/><br/>Each player has either 8, 16, or 24 pieces, depending on format. There are 16 unique pieces per 'color' and 6 colors. Play revolves around the unique connections each piece have, which create blocking pieces, good for preventing other players from making favorable connections, hub pieces, good for leaving open connections that allow you to connect to your own color (giving you bonus points), as well as pieces with different 'awake' and 'dormant' peeps, which have varying point values.<br/><br/>Play continues until no more valid placements are available. The game comes with some variants on scoring, including a version which takes into account the direction that the 'peeps' eyes' point, and a version with rules for gambling, as a potential substitute for poker night.<br/><br/>The game combines bluff and negotiation, as players get bonus points for connecting to their own color, but cannot directly reverse the moves other players make against their pieces. Even if players choose not to discuss their moves, the moves, themselves act as a form of diplomacy, potentially forcing other players to react to 3rd parties as play progresses.<br/><br/>The pieces are generally wood, though some limited sets in Acrylic are available.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": ["First Edition"], "age": "8", "name": "PeltaPeeps", "playingtime": "80", "boardgamemechanic": ["Modular Board", "Tile Placement", "Trading"], "average": "0", "usersrated": "0", "boardgamefamily": ["Crowdfunding: Kickstarter"]}, "222659": {"rpgartist": ["(Uncredited)"], "rpg": ["Generic / Universal"], "poll": [], "name": "Tower of the Fox", "rpgdesigner": ["Daniel Dean"], "rpgproducer": ["(Uncredited)"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3453636.jpg", "usersrated": "0", "rpgitemversion": ["PDF Version"], "average": "0", "statistics": [], "rpggenre": ["Fantasy"], "rpgpublisher": ["(Web published)"], "rpgcategory": ["Scenario / Adventure / Module"], "rpgseries": ["One Page Dungeon Contest 2014", "One Page Dungeon Contests"], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3453636_t.jpg", "description": "User summary:<br/><br/>The party has come to a village in search of missing goats and sheep.

This is Delmer Esau's Blak Dragon.<br/><br/>The Techno-Communists have razed the Earth. The former NATO group, now known as the Rogue Army, face the Cyborg Uprising in a thrilling 3D competitive tactical board game series. Also play as the Techno-Communists, the Zero-G Mafia, the Corporates or the Settlers.<br/><br/>This is a biopunk cyber-tactical military board-game. At the dawn of the 22nd century the ambush assault at the hands of the Machine Communists destroyed much of the planet. NATO and others hold on to honour while others, like the Zero-G Mafia and Corporates do it for cash. The Settlers, Martians and other Solar communities fend for their land titles and spatial positions.<br/><br/>This game features cutting-edge game technology like layered board modules, dry erase record keeping, character units and multi-theatre elements. Fight it out in orbit while waging a ground campaign at the same time. Large Junkspace orbital cities are often the battleground depicted by map-tile layers that players can record damage, fuel and ammunition supplies on. Virtually any hotspot in Sol system will be supported with full mapping and engineering information; in-game attributes provided on the boards.<br/><br/>Typically a Blak Dragon mission has players' fielding a capitol vessel, with garrisons and hangers bays, against each-other. Players field these capitol ships complete with square 3D map-boards that depict the vessels deck plan and attributes on cards provided (attributes like space travel movement). Also, capitol vessels are represented by a large unit piece on hexagonal map-boards that has three layers that allow three-dimensional fighting in outer space. A vessel's action is planned three moves ahead with secret Command and Network cards being played face down. The vessel's movement, weapons, and network abilities are declared this way. Players will have to guess ahead to what their opponents Commands will be, simulating slow-acting-commands and fog-of-war. Network digital hacks can be assisted by netrunners deployed along with other space infantry units in boarding parties.<br/><br/>ALL vessels from capitol ships to fighter craft are combined with dry erase playing card markers. Fuel, ammo and air are recorded and spendable. Fighters, gunships, mecha, all can move on the main board.<br/><br/>Genre conflict elements include nuclear weapons, cluster missile pods, recoiless A.I. automatics, lasers and hand-to-hand blade and martial arts. Fighter-craft, robotic weapon systems, gunships and stealth units are deployable. Send fighter craft, gunships and mecha to assault enemy vessels in zero gravity space and wage infantry battles with your boarding parties. Die rolling and skill attributes compared with die-rolling, armor and dodge determine damage and or loss of units.<br/><br/>Also, the Uplift Community, everyone from the Dolphins and the Dawgs, will be represented.

Constant interaction between players anchors a fluid combat system; subroutines are assigned and executed in devastating assaults. Unleash your custom code as lethal programs drive your Wreckers onward in a brutal frenzy of destruction.<br/><br/>There are 4 initial factions in The Third Law, each with their own back-story, motivations, look and play style.  With in-faction options for Machinists, Wreckers and upgrades, each Array selected will be unique to you and the strategy you determine.<br/><br/>The Third Law is a skirmish level, sci-fi miniatures wargame where players take on the role of a 'Machinist'; selecting and controlling their Wrecker Arrays to do battle against rival factions in a dark, near future world.<br/><br/>Starting with your choice of Machinist, you will select, upgrade and control a small team of robotic combatants (Wreckers) in tabletop combat.  Your ultimate goal is to inflict enough feedback damage to the opposing Machinist (while minimising the feedback you endure) to ensure that it is them and not you that is removed from the battleground in a comatose state.<br/><br/>You can inflict feedback in a myriad of ways but most commonly damage to a Machinist is done through the temporary loss of a Wrecker, through The Grid itself (by controlling the strategically significant 'Nodes') or through direct Machinist attacks.  Depending on the faction you chose, you will discover a wide range of options and specialisms that can help you emerge victorious.<br/><br/>With its innovative 'subroutine' resource allocation system, The Third Law is an unparalled tactical challenge for even veteran gamers.  Your choice of Machinist, Wreckers and upgrades will determine the type and quantity of resources available to you in battle.  With each Wrecker making a contribution to the global subroutine pool you begin defining your strategy as you select your Array.<br/><br/>Futher strategic depth is delivered through an ever changing battlefield; as Nodes change hands new fronts open up and astute Machinists can take advantage of the ebb and flow of power across The Grid to inflict further punishment on their opponent.  It may not be enough simply to dominate by weight of metal, often victory is seized by those who can best control the currents of energy and create crippling waves of feedback.  By using your Wreckers to secure and hold Nodes deep in enemy territory you can ensure the safety of your neural pathways while inflicting untold damage on the mental capacity of your foe.<br/><br/>Finally, as the controlling Machinist you are able to bring your own range of special abilities to bear on the outcome of the battle.  With each Machinist equipped with their own custom code you can take advantage of more efficient programmes to drive your Wreckers.  Depending on your class you may find yourself able to support your Wreckers with more effective subroutines or cripple your enemies with devastating viral strikes.  Whoever you chose to play as, you can create a bespoke package of abilities that reflect your playstyle and tactical preferences.<br/><br/>"}, "222727": {"rpgdesigner": ["Jose Lomo", "Manuel J.

Characters don&rsquo;t have Attributes or even Skills, but they are instead described by Strengths like Secret of the Bear or Eye of the Panther and Weaknesses such as Fearful or One-Eyed. The nature of the game is at your discretion &mdash; you may play a game that&rsquo;s more historically accurate or you may decide to incorporate fantastical elements like magic and the spirit world that are discussed in the rules.<br/><br/>Originally published in France, W&uuml;rm has been professionally translated. Nocturnal Media is proud to present this acclaimed RPG to an Enlish-speaking game audience.<br/><br/>In W&uuml;rm you will find adventure in the prehistoric past of our own world. In this long-forgotten time, many powerful creatures roamed a vast territory covered in steppes and taiga, reaching from the white mountains to the raging sea: mammoths, aurochs, bison, giant deer, cave bears and cave lions. Among these huge creatures, two species of humans live in small communities of hunter-gatherers: the robust Bear Men (Neanderthals) and the taller Long Men (Cro-Magnon, or Cavemen).<br/><br/>When you play W&uuml;rm, it will be up to you to imagine what life was like for our ancestors, and explore your own vision of this time. During your adventures, whether simply surviving or going on perilous hunts or legendary quests, your characters will gain strength, wisdom and prestige by exploring unknown territories, daring to enter the darkness of mysterious caves, seeking out the powers of ancient spirits, or challenging the creatures of the night.<br/><br/>All the rules you need to play W&uuml;rm are included in the core rulebook, detailed over nine chapters. These rules were designed to be simple and clear. For the most part, they only require a few 6-sided dice. Most of all, they were designed to be well adapted to the atmosphere of the Stone Age. For example, to develop the characters, you won&rsquo;t need skills and stats, but a number of Strengths and Weaknesses that are connected to specific totems. Additionally, Talents and Secret techniques represent the abilities that a character may learn, such as painting, shamanism or certain combat techniques.<br/><br/>The game rules have been developed to be as close as possible to established archeological sources, carefully relaying what we know of the technical knowledge, the environment and part of the culture of our ancestors. However, the world of W&uuml;rm also leaves room for a touch of fantasy and adventure: you will therefore find rules that allow you to play with the real powers of totem spirits, as well as a whole range of fantastical creatures living along side the mammoths and the cave bears, such as fire spirits, witches and glacier giants.<br/><br/>So you may dive right into the prehistoric adventure of the world of W&uuml;rm, the core rulebook ends with four introduction scenarios, each one offering a specific atmosphere, including adventure, investigation, melancholy, or humor. One scenario is designed to introduce younger players to the game.<br/><br/>"}, "222734": {"rpgdesigner": ["Olivier Castan", "Julien Cl\u00e9ment", "Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Debout", "Emmanuel Roudier"], "rpgitemversion": ["PDF version"], "statistics": [], "name": "Voice of the Ancestors No. 1: Tales of the Antler Bearers", "rpgartist": ["Emmanuel Roudier"], "rpgproducer": ["Kathy Calmejane", "Fran\u00e7ois-Xavier Cuende", "Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Debout", "Franck Florentin", "\u00c9ric Gilleron", "Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Morla\u00ebs", "Arnaud Pri\u00e9", "Emmanuel Roudier", "Stewart Wieck"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3453705.jpg", "usersrated": "0", "average": "0", "rpggenre": ["Fantasy", "History (Prehistoric)"], "rpgpublisher": ["Nocturnal Media"], "rpg": ["W\u00fcrm"], "rpgcategory": ["Scenario / Adventure / Module"], "poll": [], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3453705_t.jpg", "description": "From publisher blurb:<br/><br/>More adventure at the very origins of humanity!<br/><br/>W&uuml;rm is a system-lite RPG set in the last period of the Ice Age 35,000 years ago.

Mojo Samurai is inspired of the classic Koi-Koi (or Hanafuda).<br/><br/>At the begining of a round, Players deploy their samurais on deployement locations.

For example, the red player associate a card with number 2 red from his hand, and 2 red from the table, he picks those cards up and places them in front of him. He then moves either 1 samurai of 2 spaces, or 2 samurais of 1 space.

Meaning that if a samurai attacks a space with one enemy samurai, both are destroyed, and the tile becomes free.<br/><br/>If the content of a tile is destroyed with the use of card symbols, a fortress (if present) on the targeted tile is sacrificed instead, saving the units present.<br/><br/>Once a round is finished, (with no associations possible, or no card symbols can be spend anymore) 2 victory points are allowed for the players controlling most tiles, the player with the most samurai on the battlefield, the player with most fortress on the field, the player with most encampments on the field, tied players get 1 points. and 1 point for each controlled special locations, and 3 point for controling the center tile.<br/><br/>After three rounds, the winner is the player with the most victory points.<br/><br/>"}, "222743": {"rpgartist": ["Jeff Brown (II)", "Luigi Castellani", "Ejiwa Ebenebe", "Arvo \"OoznynKoo\" Halme", "David Lewis Johnson", "Joyce Maureira", "David Revoy", "Miguel Santos", "Tan Ho Sim", "Mariana Ruiz Villareal"], "rpgitemversion": ["PDF Version"], "poll": [], "name": "Lords of the Nexus", "rpgdesigner": ["Arvo \"OoznynKoo\" Halme"], "rpgproducer": ["Arvo \"OoznynKoo\" Halme"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3453881.jpg", "usersrated": "0", "average": "0", "statistics": [], "rpg": ["5e Game System Product (D&D 5th Edition Compatible)"], "rpgpublisher": ["(Web published)"], "rpgcategory": ["Scenario / Adventure / Module"], "rpggenre": ["Fantasy (High Fantasy)"], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3453881_t.jpg", "description": "A Campaign Framework<br/><br/>From the introduction:<br/><br/>Lords of the Nexus contains a Hexcrawl system built atop of 5th edition D&amp;D.

(1 to 3) and throws them on the table and turns the hourglass.  These token have random pictures on them, and the player must tell the story of how his superheroe stopped the supervillain mentionning his superpower, and his story must include all the randomly selected tokens. Other players may play one of their special tokens to add an additionnal random token to the story if they feel it's going to be too easy, and after the player finishes his story, they can also play special token to contest his story by either telling that it's the other players superhero who really did the job, and that this players version was not the truth, or that the superhero was beated by the supervillain and lost his encounter.

It cannot be. I am just a guy with a computer and access to a laser printer and sometimes copy machines. IT is just MY set of house rules of how I want to run a game. Simple and easy rules with great stories and action and adventure! Many class and race options all in a simple framework. Try this game out as your &ldquo;other&rdquo; fantasy game when you have nothing prepped or when not everyone shows up for the main game. With less rules and more options to try, it might just become your new game. This book features a few fantastic races by the very talented RPG Blogger Charlie Warren! It also includes rules for Psions and Warlocks! Make sure and check out the SLAYER!

Facing the disastrous loss of their North African colonies, the Italians accept the aid of their allies and the Germans deploy the Deutsche Afrika Korps to Libya, under the command of General Erwin Rommel.

He rules with fear and violence, and no one dares stand up to him. No one but you. Starting with nothing more than righteous indignation, you acquire the training, resources, equipment, and experience needed to take down the Nemesis and get back your life. You move in the shadows. You let nothing and no one stand in your way. You are a vigilante!<br/><br/>Objective:<br/>In Vigilante, the goal is to become the first player to reach 40 Experience Points, then defeat the Nemesis.<br/><br/>Player Ability Slots<br/>Your playmat lets you keep track of your progress as you complete your costume. You can have 1 Head Equipment, 1 Body Equipment, 2 Arm Equipment, and 2 Signature Moves/Weapons. If you acquire Equipment, but there is no room for it, you gain the E.P. from it, but then must decide which card will stay on your playmat. The other card is removed from the game. It also states your character bonus. This bonus can be used once every turn and represents your area of expertise.<br/><br/>Turn Overview:<br/>Each turn you will be using your skills (dice) to increase your experience and bring you closer to facing the Nemesis. Each turn consists of three phases:<br/>1) Upkeep Phase.<br/>2) Roll Skill Dice.<br/>3) Use Skill Dice.<br/><br/>Using Skill Dice:<br/>Once you have finished rolling your dice, you may engage them to further your plans. Dice can be used to Obtain Equipment, Steal Equipment, Discard an Equipment Card, Train, Gain Resources, trade one color of cubes for the other (Focus Intent) Obtain New Skills, or Patrol the City. You can do as many of these actions each turn as your dice will allow, in any order you want. If you cannot or do not want to perform any of these actions, you may just pass your turn.<br/><br/>Game End<br/>The game ends as soon as one player can defeat the Nemesis. To challenge the Nemesis, you must first reach (or pass) the 40 spot on the Experience Point Track. Once this is done, you can challenge the Nemesis. You must declare that you are challenging the Nemesis at the beginning of your turn after the upkeep phase, but before rolling any dice. Move your maker off the board and place it next to the area marked &ldquo;Level One&rdquo; on the Nemesis card.<br/><br/>To defeat the Nemesis, you must be able to overcome all three levels on their card. You do not have to overcome all three levels in the same turn. If you overcome a level, you may move your marker to the next level and end your turn. You may also press your luck and attempt to overcome another level. If you do so, you gain the reward from completing the level. You can then re-roll your dice up to three more times, but none of the equipment you&rsquo;ve used so far is refreshed. If you ever fail to complete a level, you lose all of the progress you made this turn and must move your marker back to the level it was on at the beginning of your turn.<br/><br/>You do not have to challenge the Nemesis each turn after acquiring 40 Experience. You can still use your turns to gain more equipment, experience, or training before attempting to challenge the Nemesis.<br/><br/>"}, "222814": {"rpgartist": ["(Uncredited)"], "rpg": ["Generic / Universal"], "poll": [], "name": "Magic Dungeon", "rpgdesigner": ["Sadhbh Brennan"], "rpgproducer": ["Rob Brennan"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3454736.jpg", "usersrated": "0", "rpgitemversion": ["PDF Version"], "average": "0", "statistics": [], "rpggenre": ["Fantasy"], "rpgpublisher": ["(Web published)"], "rpgcategory": ["Scenario / Adventure / Module"], "rpgseries": ["One Page Dungeon Contest 2014", "One Page Dungeon Contests"], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3454736_t.jpg", "description": "From the introduction:<br/><br/>Note: You fall into a room when you fall into the pit.

From this vantage the Archmage and her Order of Mages ruled these lands for an Age, drawing together the warring magics of the mythic races into one all-powerful and cohesive force. That was, of course, before The Ending.<br/><br/>The Ruined City is now home to but a fragment of the mythic races that once served the Archmage and her Order. And until now, no human has dared step foot in these forsaken streets. The newcomers, of human stock, are the descendants of the ancient Mages, now outcasts living in camps in the farthest reaches of the lands. Unusual shows of power in their home villages have already gathered them small but enthusiastic bands of followers. And now they have travelled to meet with representatives of the mythic races, to seek their wisdom and magical secrets.<br/><br/>The mythic races are the keepers of six very different spheres of magic, with very different abilities. It was only the power of the Archmage that long ago found ways to combine the spheres and gain higher and higher levels of magic. Now, much of the magic of the mythic races is lost, and the newcomers, having come so far, are told they must now travel the lands to reclaim lost relics sacred to the races. It seems the journey to absolute magical power has only just begun...<br/><br/>Archmage is a euro-thematic hybrid, where players take on the role of fledgling Mages, traveling the lands to recover ancient relics, gather followers, and train apprentices in six spheres of magic and beyond. As the power of their Order grows, they will pit apprentices against each other, and attain unheard of spells and magical powers, building their own Mage tower to watch over the lands and weave their magics.<br/><br/>When the time of reckoning comes, a new Archmage will rule.<br/><br/>Each turn is formed of two phases:<br/><br/>1) The Journey: A Mage travels across the map (formed of hex tiles): discovering new locations; deploying followers to gather relics from Ruins, Libraries, Sacred Glades, and other locations sacred to each of the mythic races; and encountering and dealing with the followers of their opponents.<br/><br/>2) Journey's End: A Mage will finish each Journey in a specific location where they can perform a specific action. <br/>     - Ending a Journey on a Town will let the Mage call on their Followers to deliver the relics and resources they have gathered.<br/>     - Ending in a Settlement (where the spurned descendants of the Mages fled after the Ending) will let a Mage recruit more Followers to their Order.<br/>     - Ending with a Mythic Race will let the Mage train Followers as Apprentices specialising in the magic of that Mythic Race (at a cost of the Relics with which the magic must be weaved).<br/>     - Ending in the Wilderness will let the Mage's followers take more physical control over the area. <br/>     - Ending in the Mage's Tower (once it has been built), will let the Mage train and test their Apprentices. On the floor of the tower (player board) is a mandala in which the Apprentices stand. Moving apprentices on the mandala will change the sorts of spells the Order has access to. Testing apprentices sees one apprentice advance to a higher level and allows an Order to discover new spells and magics beyond what any of the Mythic Races could individually know, and to add to those magics to their spell library.<br/><br/>Spells provide Mages with a range of options for strategic and tactical play. Archmage has a modular spell system, with 18 spells included in the base game, and expansions planned to add more sets. Spells are used by expending a cost in Relics, the magical currency of the game that is unique to each mythic race.<br/><br/>The game is played over a number of turns, depending on the player count. After the last turn, the Mage with the most powerful Order of Mages, is declared the new Archmage and power is restored to the lands... until the next time!<br/><br/>"}, "222864": {"boardgamedesigner": ["\u9577\u8c37\u5ddd \u767b\u9bc9 (Tori Hasegawa)"], "average": "6", "poll": [], "name": "8bit Trick", "playingtime": "30", "minplayers": "3", "boardgamemechanic": ["Trick-taking"], "yearpublished": "2016", "usersrated": "1", "maxplayers": "5", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3511275_t.jpg", "boardgameartist": ["\u9577\u8c37\u5ddd \u767b\u9bc9 (Tori Hasegawa)"], "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["MOGwai"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3511275.jpg", "boardgameversion": ["First edition"], "maxplaytime": "30", "boardgamecategory": ["Card Game", "Video Game Theme"], "age": "10", "minplaytime": "20", "description": "8bit Trick is simple trick taking game themed after 8 bit video games.<br/><br/>Players play 3 rounds and aim to take just &quot;8&quot; tricks.<br/>If you get less than 8, you drop out.<br/>If you get more than 8, your score decreases.<br/><br/>There are 2 additional mechanics, &quot;Flip Card&quot; and &quot;Black +3 Card&quot;.<br/><br/>"}, "222865": {"poll": [], "name": "Rise of the Kings", "videogamemode": ["Network Multiplayer", "Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["Android edition", "iOS edition", "Web Browser edition"], "average": "0", "videogametheme": ["Medieval"], "usersrated": "0", "videogamedeveloper": ["Onemt Limited"], "videogamegenre": ["MMO", "Real Time Strategy", "RPG"], "videogameplatform": ["Android", "iPad", "iPhone", "Web Browser"], "statistics": [], "videogamepublisher": ["Onemt Limited"], "description": "A real time strategy game putting you in a world crying out for help.

Each participant begins the game with over/under and yes/no cards they use to make their predictions about the dealer.<br/><br/>Play begins when the first dealer selects a card from the stack, reads the prediction to be made, then reveals the card to all players. Each player signifies how they think the dealer will respond by placing their prediction card face-down in front of them. Once all players have locked in their predictions, the dealer reveals their answer, and players flip their prediction cards face-up. The number of correct predictions by the players will determine how many correct predictions the dealer will need to take the card and earn a point.<br/><br/>Using the same prediction selected by the dealer, players place their answer card face-down in front of them to lock in their answers about themselves. The dealer then makes the same prediction about each player. If the dealer makes at least as many correct predictions about the players as the players made about them, the dealer places the active card in front of them, signifying they've earned one point. A tie favors the dealer, as long as they've made at least one correct prediction. Play continues by the next clockwise player becoming the dealer and drawing a new card from the stack.

No game master needed, all you have to do is play four cards.<br/><br/>Each player is dealt a duplicate preset hand of action cards before the game. Some are &quot;Murder&quot;, some &quot;Investigate (Accuse)&quot;, some &quot;Guard&quot;, and so on.But unlike Werewolf-style games, there is no predefined role. You choose your own role in game.<br/><br/>There are four rounds in a game, and you play one card per round. If you ever play a &quot;Murder&quot; card, you took the &quot;Murderer&quot; role. Otherwise, you are the opposing &quot;Investigator&quot; role. Since you can't draw additional cards in the game, if you check your remaining hand it is obvious which role you played.<br/><br/>You must act as either a Murderer trying not to get caught, or as a Detective to accuse the culprit. Every player has an urge for murder, but if you failed to cover your tracks, you would be accused and have to drop out of the game.<br/><br/>You get 5 points if you survive, 5 points if you successfully manage to murder the mansion owner, 3 points for killing other players, or 4 points for a successful accusation... The player with the most points at the end of the fourth day is the winner.<br/><br/>Should your murderous intentions rule you or keep your good will? Should you act as a murderer or act as a detective? It's all up to you.<br/><br/>After the first edition was released, a revised edition was produced.

The Nation players on their turns roll two dice and can move any of the pieces by either or both dice. Each starts with a single Vote card and adds another each time a Nation piece reaches the center or when a third Nation is moved onto a space with two others.

Many adventurers are familiar with wading into combat against monsters and small groups of enemies, but this is nothing next to the glory and chaos and carnage that is true war. More than simply a change in scale, the difference between war and other combat can be profound. In a war, the characters are part of something larger than themselves, contributing to the efforts of their armies, or perhaps leading those armies themselves. The priorities of a soldier are different from those of an adventurer, and often the challenges that they face are, as well. While many characters can translate their talents as adventurers to the battlefield, one who specifically focuses on warfare and battlefield tactics will have the edge on others when it comes to true war. Each installment of Weekly Wonders: Archetypes of War provides six new war-themed archetypes for a variety of classes.<br/><br/>For this book, we focus on siege warfare, and especially on tactics employed to break through sieges and defensive barriers. Whether it is breaking through walls and doors with brute strength, or using magic to make them twist and melt away, the characters in this book laugh at the obstacles laid to block their paths. This book contains the following archetypes:<br/><br/>    The sapper, an alchemist archetype specializing in using bombs for demolition purposes, including explosive mines and bombs that can collapse fortifications.<br/>    The juggernaut, a barbarian archetype that is all but unstoppable in battle and can even crash through solid walls.<br/>    The behemoth trainer, a hunter archetype whose animal companion grows to incredible size, and is perfect for smashing through buildings.<br/>    The land channeler, a medium archetype that invokes the spirit of the land, turning it against his enemies as stone erodes, wood warps and twists, and the very terrain itself conspires on his behalf.<br/>    The war mage, a wizard archetype that specializes in creating and destroying fortifications.<br/>    A bonus archetype for the warder, from Path of War by Dreamscarred Press, the valiant defender serves as a rallying point for his allies, bolstering those nearby.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>"}, "222993": {"rpgartist": ["Bob Greyvenstein", "Michael Jaecks", "Gordon Napier", "Tanya Sangsnit", "Rian Trost", "Steve Wood (II)"], "rpg": ["Pathfinder System Compatible Product"], "poll": [], "name": "Legendary Kineticists II", "rpgdesigner": ["N.

The lid lifted off to form the playing field, with individual yard markings and eight lines running the length of the field lettered A-G. A wooden bar on a slider is used to mark the position of the ball, and there is a metal 10-yard marker that slides up one side of the lid.<br/><br/>The base has a large mechanism in the center, with a brass spinner embedded in a wooden wheel with 19 spaces numbered in a random order. The wheel in turn has a knob that is used to rotate the wheel against numerically ordered numbers on the surrounding board. There are six small windows on each side of the wheel, with the offense to the left and the defense to the right.<br/><br/>The offensive player has three play options (line buck, forward pass or end run) as well as three kicking plays (kick-off, goal kick and punt). The defensive player has a matching set of windows.<br/><br/>The offensive player calls a play, spins the spinner, and then rotates the wheel so that the spun number on the wheel aligns with the same number on the outer circle. He then reads the initial results of the play from the appropriate offensive window. The defensive player then spins, using the wheel to produce additional results in the matching window. For instance, an offensive pass play might read &quot;25 yds A&quot;, a gain of 25 caught at the sideline. The defensive window would then indicate whether the pass was complete, incomplete, intercepted or triggered an offensive or defensive penalty.<br/><br/>The game proceeds and scores using normal football rules. The intricate double spinner and interlocking wheel mechanism is unusual, as is the solid wood construction. But except for the limited offensive play calling options, the results are essentially random.<br/><br/>"}, "222999": {"rpgdesigner": ["(Uncredited)"], "rpgitemversion": ["Deck Version"], "statistics": [], "name": "It's not my fault!
