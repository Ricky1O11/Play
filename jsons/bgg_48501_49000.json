One potent reason for this is a general lack of cultural complexity and diversity. D&amp;D races tend to be presented as monocultural societies&mdash;all elves are the same the world over, and so on.<br/><br/>Hard Boiled&trade; Cultures aims to make it easy to change that, outlining versatile, easy methods for diversifying the ideas of culture and race in your D&amp;D 4E game.

The day there was no sun rise - no moon or stars for that matter - only absolute darkness and hysteria.<br/><br/>&quot;It is your seventeenth birthday when &quot;The Becoming&quot; changes your life and your world view forever. That was the day you discovered there were two of you, your human-self and the inhuman creature you can become at will.<br/><br/>&quot;You quickly learn there are &quot;monsters&quot; in the world, both human and supernatural, evil and good. The question is, which are you?&quot;<br/><br/>The Nightbane are characters who discover that they not entirely human. In fact, they are shape-changers who possess a comparatively frail, human &quot;facade&quot; and a supernatural, superhuman &quot;morphus.&quot;<br/><br/>The morphus is said to reflect the character's personality or subconscious fears, desires and self-image. Thus some are exotic and beautiful, while others (most) are misshapened monsters. No two appear exactly alike and even the most hideous can have the spirit of a saint, while the handsome and beautiful may be evil incarnate.<br/><br/>Whether hideous or beautiful, cruel or kind, the Nightbane are feared and slaughtered by most humans who see only a monster. Creatures of shadows, when slain, they disappear like the morning mist, as if they never existed (and leaving no evidence of their existence).<br/><br/>A surprising number of Nightbane cherish and cling to their humanity. Many of these become secret protectors of humankind and champions of good. Yet even these misbegotten heroes must operate in secret lest fearful, evil or misguided humans torment or destroy them. But there are far greater horrors loosed in the world than this. Evil Nightbane, vampires, human sorcerers, supernatural predators and other dark forces all busy building their petty power structures, preying on the weak and innocent, or engaging in foul pursuits. Worse, the Nightbane are hunted and slaughtered without just cause and without mercy by the Nightlords and their minions.<br/><br/>The Nightlords plan to quietly seize control of the world! They have already secretly infiltrated the highest levels of world government and business, and have begun to manipulate and enslave humankind. Their only opposition: humans who have uncovered the truth, vampires (rivals for world domination), and the Nightbane who have elected to fight their own kind to save the human race.<br/><br/>Feared and hunted by humans, the Nightlords, and the forces of evil, the Nightbane are the ultimate anti-heroes who struggle to triumph against all odds!<br/><br/>A complete role-playing game! Compatible with Beyond the Supernatural, Heroes Unlimited, Ninjas &amp; Superspies, Mystic China, and adaptable to Rifts.<br/><br/>Highlights Include:<br/><br/>* The Nightbane R.C.C. enables gamers to play supernatural shape-changers. Beings who can appear completely human, but are really superhuman creatures from the twilight dimension known as Nightlands.<br/>    * Nightbane &quot;talents&quot; are supernatural and magic abilities of incredible power and range.

These include a spell progression system that ranks spells from levels 1 to 20, new rules for healing and curative magic, magical disciplines for spellcasters that always give them an active power and a way to contribute, and much more.<br/><br/>This book also includes a new base class, the runeblade, for players wanting a character that combines magic and martial skill without the use of spells. New rules for wizards, clerics, druids, paladins, and rangers are provided, offering each class magical disciplines like Godhammer, Eldritch Bolt, and Nature's Senses. And, of course, the book also offers dozens of new spells, feats, and magic items.<br/><br/>Inherent within all the rule changes in this book is the idea that characters should be able to keep adventuring longer than the rules currently allow. Disciplines, more ample healing, and the other experiments in this supplement help bring down the barriers -- like casters running out of spells and characters running low on hit points -- that traditionally make parties stop to rest before they really want to.<br/><br/>Start your own experiment now!<br/><br/>"}, "48684": {"rpgitemversion": {"4480": "Hard Cover"}, "poll": {}, "name": "Castle Zagyg, Volume 1: Yggsburgh", "rpgproducer": {"4894": "Davis Chenault"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic519396.jpg", "usersrated": "14", "rpgsetting": {"1831": "Castle Zagyg"}, "average": "7.57143", "statistics": {}, "rpg": {"509": "Castles & Crusades"}, "rpgcategory": {"2107": "Campaign Setting (game world)"}, "rpggenre": {"155": "Fantasy (High Fantasy)"}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic519396_t.jpg", "description": "This campaign setting is based on Gygax's classic campaign (Greyhawk) but renamed as he no longer owns the rights to it's original name.<br/><br/>This book is currently out of print as after Gary Gygax' death in March, 2008, all of his intellectual property was removed from Troll Lord Games by a new company Gygax Games which has stated it's intention to reprint this and his other works.<br/><br/>From the back of the book:<br/><br/>The book you hold in your hands is the Setting for the famed Castle Zagyg, the monstrous dungeons of which are detailed in the forthcoming six volumes of this series.<br/><br/>This book consists of the East Mark, which includes the town of Yggsburgh and its Environs, the town of Garham and 60 different geographic locals, each with their own peculiarities and adventures.<br/><br/>The map charts over 1500 square miles of adventuring terrain, allowing the inclusion of Yggsburgh  and Environs into almost and fantasy campaign setting.

Until this morning -- yesterday morning now -- the war had been almost an abstract concept, held far to the south and having little impact at home. The cruise missiles and bombing runs changed all that, striking at military and civilian targets alike. The Christobal Hospital was one of the worst hit sites, throwing the relief effort into chaos. Lang had worked diligently since the first missiles struck, desperately attempting to save her people and forge order out of chaos. It had been thirty hours but felt like thirty days. <br/><br/> &quot;Blood will pay for blood.&quot; That was the Western way, she thought. Yet, if that happened the cycle of violence would escalate and her plans to limit this self-destructive and futile conflict would be for nothing. She could not allow that to happen but there was nothing she could do to halt the rampaging bull that was the Protectorate. Or was there? Perhaps she could prod the lumbering juggernaut, steering it around the worst of the chaos while waiting for an opportunity. One way or another she would end this pointless war.<br/><br/>The war to the south is not going well and, after having been the subject of minor raids since the start of the conflict, the bombing of Fort Henry has brought the Western Frontier Protectorate its first real taste of the horrors of war. Many militaristic Westerners are clamoring for revenge, seeking the prosecution of a centuries-old feud. Others argue that this is not their war and that the Protectorate's troops are being sacrificed on the altar of Norlight and Mercantile ambition. The lines are drawn but which will win?

An alien frontier awaits the brave and daring!  This new planet will be harsh, but if you have the skills to manage your resources, build a fleet, research alien life, and settle colonies, the world can be yours.<br/><br/>Alien Frontiers is a game of resource management and planetary development for two to four players. During the game you will utilize orbital facilities and alien technology to build colony domes in strategic locations to control the newly discovered world.<br/><br/>The game board shows the planet, its moon, the stations in orbit around the planet, and the solar system&rsquo;s star. The dice you are given at the start of the game represent the space ships in your fleet. You will assign these ships to the orbital facilities in order to earn resources, expand your fleet, and colonize the planet.<br/><br/>As the game progresses, you will place your colony tokens on the planet to represent the amount of control you have over each territory. Those territories exert influence over specific orbital facilities and, if you control a territory, you are able to utilize that sway to your advantage.<br/><br/>The planet was once the home of an alien race and they left behind a wondrous artifact in orbit. Using your fleet to explore the artifact, you will discover amazing alien technologies that you can use to advance your cause.<br/><br/>Winning the game will require careful consideration as you assign your fleet, integrate the alien technology and territory influences into your expansion plans, and block your opponents from building colonies of their own. Do you have what it takes to conquer an alien frontier?<br/><br/>Roll and place your dice to gain advantages over your opponent and block them out of useful areas of the board.  Use Alien Tech cards to manipulate your dice rolls and territory bonuses to break the rules.  Steal resources, overtake territories, and do whatever it takes to get your colonies on the map first!  Don't dream it'll be easy, though, because the other players will be trying to do the same thing.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": {"71069": "English first edition"}, "average": "7.4934", "name": "Alien Frontiers", "playingtime": "90", "boardgamemechanic": {"2080": "Area Control / Area Influence"}, "age": "13", "boardgameexpansion": {}, "usersrated": "11523", "boardgameaccessory": {"141439": "Alien Frontiers: 4th Edition Board"}, "boardgamesubdomain": {"5497": "Strategy Games"}, "boardgamefamily": {"5679": "Aliens"}}, "48727": {"rpg": {"1298": "HackMaster (4th Edition)"}, "poll": {}, "name": "Meenlock to Nefarain: Other, Soul Larva", "rpgitemversion": {"4517": "Soft Cover"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic551838.jpg", "usersrated": "13", "rpgsetting": {"1315": "Garweeze Wurld"}, "average": "8.07692", "statistics": {}, "rpggenre": {"155": "Fantasy (High Fantasy)"}, "rpgcategory": {"2108": "Sourcebook (rules/options to enhance play)"}, "rpgseries": {"1838": "Hacklopedia of Beasts"}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic551838_t.jpg", "description": "(From the back cover)<br/><br/>The Hacklopedia of Beasts:  This comprehensive set of reference manuals is a must for HackMaster GMs.  In this volume, terrifying monster whose names begin with the letters Me-Ne are described in sometimes-frightening scientific detail.

It's for the people who'd like to flesh out the background of their gaming world, but don't have the time to dig through scholarly books. A Magical Medieval Society: Western Europe provides you flexibility and advice in creating your own world. It contains a massive amount of game-usable information about the medieval period and focuses on how D20 magic could change a traditional medieval setting. Generation systems for kingdoms, cities, manors, aristocratic wealth and landholding; a thorough construction system; and an economic simulator allow GMs to recreate the high middle ages feel with ease.<br/><br/>A Magical Medieval Society: Western Europe solves age-old dilemmas like: How much does it cost for my PCs to repair the formerly-orc-infested abandoned keep they want to use as a home base? What would happen, politically, were the PCs to set up their keep? How big is my city of 15,000 people? How many buildings are in my city? What do all the NPCs do? How do I start my PCs on the road to becoming kings? Just how much does a king earn a year anyway? What about just a regular noble? How big is a kingdom of 5,000,000 people? How many cultivated acres does it take to feed them? How should I map towns, cities, and smaller communities within my kingdom? What type of government should I use for my kingdom? How does magical religion really work?

If someone isn't certain about what is involved in being a lawyer in a pseudo-medieval setting, the introduction will give a overview of the information needed to put a lawyer to work in the game.<br/><br/>Taking full advantage of the electronic medium, the book includes comprehensive Bookmark choices, breaking the NPCs down by chapter sequentially as well as an alphabetical listing for ease of reference. Your download (or CD) includes two versions: one full colour version complete with graphics and bookmarks, another &quot;Low Impact&quot; edition without the backgrounds so those printing the book can save on toner! Being in PDF format, a DM can cut and paste the desired statblock into her game notes and then customize to suit her campaign or adventure in the wordprocessor of her choice. And since all of the text is 100% open game content, everyone can cut and paste to their heart's content.<br/><br/>Ready-made statblocks are faster than any PC generator, and far more portable! Not just a &quot;rogues gallery&quot;, Everyone Else's NPCs are non-adversarial and non-adventuring NPCs, and reduce prep-time needed for the space between adventures, allowing a DM more freedom to work on the fun stuff -- the dungeons, quests, and thwarting the evil villains. This is one book in your DM's collection that won't collect dust!<br/><br/>"}, "48740": {"rpgitemversion": {"4530": "Hard Cover"}, "rpgseries": {"537": "Legends & Lairs"}, "name": "Wildscape", "rpgproducer": {"448": "Greg Benage"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic539333.jpg", "usersrated": "8", "average": "6.0625", "statistics": {}, "rpg": {"1788": "d20 System / OGL Product (D&D 3.0 Compatible)"}, "poll": {}, "rpgcategory": {"2108": "Sourcebook (rules/options to enhance play)"}, "rpggenre": {"155": "Fantasy (High Fantasy)"}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic539333_t.jpg", "description": "From the Back of the Book:<br/><br/>The definitive d20 System resource for wilderness adventures and campaigns.<br/><br/>Following in the tradition of DUNGEONCRAFT and CITYWORKS, this invaluable toolbox gives players and DMs everything they need to create and run memorable fantasy adventures and campaigns in the untamed wilderness.<br/><br/>- New options for druid characters, including druid realms that allow players to customize their druids' spells and abilities.<br/><br/>- New styles for ranger characters, including two-handed fighting and spear-fighting, as well as new options for non-spellcasting rangers.<br/><br/>- Complete descriptions, hazards, and stat blocks for a wide range of terrain types, including deserts, forests, mountains, swamps, and wastelands.<br/><br/>- Comprehensive rules for weather and climate, including ready-to-use stat blocks for a variety of storms and conditions.<br/><br/>"}, "48741": {"rpgitemversion": {"4531": "Soft Cover"}, "poll": {}, "name": "Pax Draconis", "rpghonor": {"13971": "2003 Indie RPG Awards - Best Support - Runner Up"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic556511.jpg", "usersrated": "2", "average": "5.25", "statistics": {}, "rpg": {"1468": "Pax Draconis"}, "rpgcategory": {"2083": "Core Rules (min needed to play)"}, "rpggenre": {"162": "Science Fiction (Space Opera)"}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic556511_t.jpg", "description": "Quoted text from cover:<br/><br/>&quot;One Galaxy.<br/>One War.<br/>One million ways ... to profit!&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;This is a unique science-fiction role-playing game -- the first to create a complete panoramic view of a future universe, combining features and technology of city grunge and space opera adventure.&quot;<br/><br/>"}, "48742": {"rpgitemversion": {"4532": "Electronic Version"}, "poll": {}, "name": "Above and Beyond", "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic932144.jpg", "usersrated": "0", "average": "0", "statistics": {}, "rpggenre": {"171": "Action / Adventure (Superheroes)"}, "rpg": {"231": "Mutants & Masterminds (1st Edition)"}, "rpgcategory": {"2108": "Sourcebook (rules/options to enhance play)"}, "rpgseries": {"3500": "M&M Superlink"}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic932144_t.jpg", "description": "[From the introduction.]<br/><br/>Above and Beyond is role-playing game supplement dealing with high-powered, superheroic games.

Averett&quot;.<br/><br/><br/>No country ever lost a war by being too strong&quot; <br/>Field-Marshall Viscount Montgomery of Alamein<br/><br/><br/><br/>CONQUEST OF THE WORLD represents a significant departure from traditional game design. The components have been designed to provide you with a very realistic model of the real world to both electronically and graphically simulate strategic and tactical confrontation between world powers. <br/>Electronic land, sea and air forces can be deployed against each other in any combination and are totally dependent on supplies which are represented by energy units.The game board is a true-to-life model of the relationships between countries of the real world in the early 1980's.<br/><br/>Forty-three countries have been divided into eleven &quot;politectonic&quot; or geo-political zones. Each country has been weighted with a power base figure that reflects its capability to persuade other nations to conform to its wishes - by diplomatic coercion or by direct military force.<br/><br/>These figures are based on the formula created by Ray S. Cline, formerly Deputy Director of Intelligence for the C.I.A.<br/><br/>Pp = (C+E+M)x(S+W)<br/><br/>PERCEIVED POWER = (Critical Mass (Population + Territory) + Economic Capability + Military Capability) x (Strategic Purpose + National Will).<br/><br/>Future shifts in world power and change in governments will - of course - make changes in these numeric weightings appropriate. Players can feel free to sustain realism by changing the numbers assigned to each country as life goes on.<br/><br/>If you play other war games such as those published by Avalon Hill and SPI, you will find that the computer cartridge interfaces very effectively with them. The onscreen combats will generate much more excitement and realism than the usual dice provided to resolve conflicts. Onscreen energy units can be programmed into the computer to reflect the relative strength between different forces. The differential between the onscreen energy units at the end of each battle can also be applied to the combat results tables that come with these games.<br/><br/>Conquest of the World is the first game of its kind, so be ready for many unusual features.

Some reach the journey&rsquo;s end by slaying mighty enemies, others by fulfilling epic quests or discovering long lost secrets and ancient treasures. Still others turn the tide of history by leading great armies or nations, and some even walk a darker path, reveling in infamy rather than heroic fame.<br/><br/>This book details nine epic destinies that lead down nine paths to immortality; they are individually as unique as snowflakes, yet identical in their ultimate conclusions. These paths may lead a hero to the radiant glory of the celestial realms or to the very depths of Hell itself. Some unlock the lost or hidden potential of a hero&rsquo;s race, while others reveal the brutal and everlasting truths of martial superiority.<br/><br/>Hearts of Chaos<br/><br/>Coming to stores in September from Goodman Games, Amethyst is an RPG that postulates what would occur if a true-to-book fantasy setting was forced upon our real world. How would humanity truly respond? This is not some stylized, fanciful view of Earth seen in books and on TV. It is a world with all the problems, both social and political, intact. Would we welcome the world of fantasy into our lives or would we fear its very presence?<br/><br/>The characters are a small cell of a large international mercenary company, the Iron Sons. They have been handed a critical mission: A former Iron Sons colonel, Montgomery Cross, has gone rogue and vanished in the deep wilderness. He has information on cell locations and strengths, but -- more importantly -- the face of the Iron Sons highest ranking officer, General Chauk -- a man with bounties for his arrest. Chauk believes this colonel to be a severe security risk, regardless of the state of his sanity. The characters are tasked with venturing into a no-man&rsquo;s land where few humans have been, finding this colonel, and killing him.<br/><br/>"}, "48786": {"rpgitemversion": {"7110": "Almanach Potwor\u00f3w"}, "poll": {}, "name": "The Creature Companion", "rpgproducer": {"15206": "Shannon Appelcline"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic973348.jpg", "usersrated": "22", "rpgsetting": {"2149": "Cthulhu Now"}, "average": "6.95455", "statistics": {}, "rpg": {"347": "Call of Cthulhu (1st Edition)"}, "rpgcategory": {"2108": "Sourcebook (rules/options to enhance play)"}, "rpggenre": {"988": "Horror (Cthulhu Mythos)"}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic973348_t.jpg", "description": "From the Back of the Book:<br/><br/>We are not alone.

In the tradition of A Magical Medieval Society: Western Europe and A Magical Society: Ecology and Culture, A Magical Society: Beast Builder gives you the tools you need to make your own campaign specific monsters to challenge and excite your players while adding to the depth and realism of your campaign world.<br/><br/>Chapter One: Monster Concepts and Functions&mdash; Monster concepts and functions drive what a monster is and even more importantly, what it does. This chapter discusses common concepts such as creature hierarchies (juvenile, adult, elder etc.), additive abilities (like the vrock&rsquo;s dance of ruin), mythological inspiration and other monster building aspects.<br/><br/>It gives advice on creating a good concept based upon the function of a creature. Every monster has a concept and a type (such as giant, vermin, etc.), but more than that every monster has a function; the part of the monster that answers the question &ldquo;What does it do?&rdquo; I outline the 20 most common functions such as grappler, caster, disabler, energy attacker and PC killer, and how such functions play out in the game. Under each function, you&rsquo;ll also find a list of the creatures from the SRD as well as creatures from Monster Geographica: Underground that possess that function.<br/><br/>Chapter Two: Monsters and their Environment&mdash; Every monster has a place in your world and every place has its monsters. This chapter is simply stuffed with useful information about environment, ecology, biology, and behavior that will help you completely customize every creature to suit your needs. We all know that statistics alone don&rsquo;t make a great monster. The best monsters are ones with a rich place within your world and this chapter will help you give your new creation a fitting background.<br/><br/>Chapter Three: Monster Statistics&mdash; Although a great background is a must for a great monster, statistical accuracy is just as important. This 19 page chapter discusses every bit of the monster stat block and gives you the information you need to insure your great fluff isn&rsquo;t let down by poor crunch.<br/><br/>Chapter Four: Type and Subtype&mdash; Continuing the statistical break-down of creatures, type and subtype is analyzed in chapter four. I give advice about determining subtype (just what is an aberration anyway?) as well as breakdown on ability scores based upon the SRD monsters. You&rsquo;ll find that although the rules say one thing, the execution often shows another when it comes to ability scores.<br/><br/>Chapter Five: Templates&mdash; Worthy of their own chapter, templates are great additions to any GMs bag of tricks. This chapter gives you information on the main 14 template (such as archetypal, greater, half, and planar-aligned) themes as well as seven main ways of acquiring a template. It finishes with a template-only version of chapters four and seven, giving you all existing information so you&rsquo;ll have more options when designing your own templates.<br/><br/>Chapter Six: Bits and Pieces&mdash; Bits and pieces is a short chapter filled with campaign oriented monster parts. In a magical world filled with hostile monsters, holistic magic plays its role and the remains of fallen foes can often be used against those who lived. This chapter helps think of monsters from yet another perspective.<br/><br/>Chapter Seven: Special Attacks, Special Qualities, and Conditions&mdash; This huge chapter provides you with 600 special abilities taken from all the creatures in the SRD and all the creatures in Monster Geographica: Underground. Each of these abilities has been broken down to component parts to demonstrate useful guidelines when using them with any CR creature. For example the balor&rsquo;s death throes SA/SQ is now tied to a creature&rsquo;s HD, instead of being a straight 100 points of damage. Every SA/SQ has its source monsters (the monsters that possess that ability) listed as well. Once you jump into this chapter there&rsquo;s no turning back; there&rsquo;s simply so many cool things you could do when making your monsters you may not want to move onto the next chapter.<br/><br/>Appendix I: D20 Mechanic Table&mdash; A single table showing the d20 mechanic. You&rsquo;ll be surprised how useful this is when deciding monster hit percentages and saving throw percentages. It&rsquo;s much easier than just doing it in your head.<br/><br/>Appendix II: Editing Checklist&mdash; Every monster should face the checklist!

It is widely played in Louisiana, particularly within the Cajun culture and on the off-shore oil platforms near the Louisiana Gulf Coast.<br/><br/>Bourre uses a standard 52-card deck. Players ante up and are dealt a five card hand. They may then &quot;fold&quot; or continue, swapping out up to all five cards (in some variants they will re-ante to play a hand). The rules are fairly straightforward:<br/> (from Wikipedia entry):<br/>   1. You must play to win. This goes beyond simply &quot;playing a higher card&quot;; if you know that no one else has any trumps, and it is your turn to lead, you must play trumps if you have them.<br/>   2. You must play on-suit if possible, even if your highest on-suit card will not beat the highest card in play. Even if a trump has been played on a non-trump lead, if you have a card of the suit led, you must play on that suit.<br/>   3. You must play a trump if you have no on-suit cards. You still must play to win; if the only trump played is a 3, you hold the 2 and the Ace of trumps but no cards of the lead suit, you must play the Ace of trumps.<br/>   4. If you have neither any cards of the lead suit nor any trumps, you may play any card. This is an off card, and is effectively lower than the 2 of the lead suit.<br/><br/>At the end of the round, the person with the most tricks, takes the pot. If there is a tie, the pot stays in for the next round. If one of the players who played a hand did not take any tricks at all, he is said to have &quot;bourreed&quot; and must match the pot as his ante for the next round. Needless to say, the pot can get quite large, especially with larger groups playing.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": {"67665": "Winning Moves English first edition"}, "age": "13", "name": "Bourr\u00e9", "playingtime": "30", "boardgamemechanic": {"2009": "Trick-taking"}, "average": "5.54645", "usersrated": "31", "boardgamefamily": {"98": "Traditional Card Games"}}, "48868": {"statistics": {}, "name": "Earthdawn Journal (Issue 1 - Aug 1994)", "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3256769.jpg", "usersrated": "0", "average": "0", "rpgissue": {"1674": "Earthdawn Journal"}, "rpgissuearticle": {"55791": "Children of Jaspree"}, "rpg": {"929": "Earthdawn (1st Edition)"}, "rpgissueversion": {"332958": "PDF version"}, "poll": {}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3256769_t.jpg", "description": "The first issue of the officially licensed Earthdawn magazine.<br/><br/>Earthdawn Journal, Vol. 1<br/>An Official Publication Devoted to Earthdawn FRPG<br/><br/>Cover art by Mike Sorensen<br/><br/>"}, "48869": {"rpgitemversion": {"4648": "Saddle Stapled (modules/pamphlets)"}, "poll": {}, "name": "Dungeon Master Screen", "rpggenre": {"155": "Fantasy (High Fantasy)"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic517120.jpg", "usersrated": "10", "rpgsetting": {"809": "Mystara"}, "average": "7.4", "rpgissuearticle": {"151123": "Capsule Reviews - Part 1"}, "rpg": {"389": "Basic Dungeons & Dragons"}, "statistics": {}, "rpgcategory": {"2086": "Accessory (dice, maps, screens, cards)"}, "rpgseries": {"1768": "Challenger"}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic517120_t.jpg", "description": "From the back cover:<br/><br/>&quot;This new DUNGEON MASTER(TM) Screen puts the most important combat and encounter tables at your fingertips!

Apart for some little semplifications, the core of the rules are the same of the first edition. With minor adjustments to character statistics all adventures are then compatible. the new edition also features an introduction by Franco Cuomo, famous Italian novelist whose &quot;Gunther d'Amalfi Cavaliere Templare&quot; is an award-winning bestseller.<br/><br/>The Order got esoteric knowledge in the East that allow them to separate their &quot;astral body&quot; from the physical one. Characters are members of a secret and esoteric organization born from the ashes of that order when it has been destroyed by the King of France and the Pope. They start the outermost part of the organization, knowing very little of the real purposes of their missions, and they are sent travel in time and space to direct the course of history follwing a secret &quot;Celestial Plan&quot; of the organization.<br/><br/>The setting is strictly historical and the kind of magic available reflects the credible supernatural power that could be believed at that age in the real world. Basic manual start with Middle Ages, but the system allows to feature adventures in any historical period or even in the future.<br/><br/>After a detailed introduction to the secret and esoteric organization of the Templar Knights born from the ashes of the Templar Order after its trial and destruction, the &quot;Initiate book&quot; details character generation. Each player is provided two different character sheet: he has to develope an &quot;astral body&quot; that is aethernal and will travel from a time to the other, between adventures. The other sheet is for the &quot;physical body&quot; in which the astral one will enter at the beginning of each new adventure, if time and place are different from the previous one.<br/><br/>The astral body has personality traits that can influence the actual mehaviour of the character: this is not totally under the control of the player. A character may speak less or more than his players would like, or panic, or do something really dangerous to save a friend... All according checks n the character traits choosen by the player while defining his character.<br/><br/>The physical body is defined by a collection of skills, used to resolve normal actions and checks. Some esoteric powers, compatible with the historical setting and the secrecy of the organization, belong to the astral body. Checks are made under the value of the attribute or skill, using a growing number of 6-sided dice depending on the difficulty: 3 dice are used for easy checks, up to 6 dice for extreme checks. Trying a check on a skill that the character does not have means adding one more die. If in the dice there are three 6s (the &quot;number of the beast&quot;) means total failure, while three 1s are the perfect roll.<br/><br/>A glossary going from &quot;Abbey&quot; to &quot;Travels&quot; gives all the informatin that the master and the players may need about everyday life in the Middle Ages. Several standard Non Player Characters (NPCs) typical of that age are supplied, and they can also be used as a basis to choose skills when creating PCs. There are also a few historical famous NPCs, that will also have a role in the introductory adventures: &quot;I Trentasei Invisibili&quot;, a mission from the Suth of France to Genoa in Italy, and &quot;Le porte del paradiso&quot;, a sequel that will bring characters up to Verona.

When there are only three players, the team work typical of the standard game is reduced to a pleasant memory. Each player has his own set of Influence Tokens and faces both his opponents in the Intrigue Card game and the struggle for board domination. The rules changes involved are simple, but the tactical options and scope for treachery have multiplied. Of course, final victory still depends on the scores of the Secret Identities, which are not revealed until Game End.<br/><br/>&quot;Now you're on your own...&quot; is the motto of this expansion, again developed by Peter Struijf and Melchior van Rijn and self-published by Geode Games.<br/><br/>The 3-player expansion to Krakow 1325 AD will make its debut in October 2009 at Spiel in Essen (Germany). There are two versions: a ziplocked English/Dutch version and a boxed German version (which also contains a complete set of Intrigues and rules in that language).<br/><br/>Peter wisely decided not to rely on his own high-school education to create the German version. He was overwhelmed when he found Andreas Brandhorst, sci-fi author and translator of almost the entire Discworld (Scheibenwelt) series, willing to translate the texts of the Intrigue cards. The game rules were translated by fellow Boardgamegeek Christian Krach.<br/><br/>Ownership of the basic game is, probably obviously, required to play the expansion set.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "3", "boardgameversion": {"34796": "Dutch edition"}, "average": "6.33684", "name": "Krakow 1325 AD: 3-player expansion", "playingtime": "45", "boardgamemechanic": {"2080": "Area Control / Area Influence"}, "age": "10", "boardgameexpansion": {}, "usersrated": "38", "expands": {"37461": {"name": "Krak\u00f3w 1325 AD"}}, "boardgamefamily": {"10317": "Country: Poland"}}, "48970": {"rpgitemversion": {"4747": "First printing"}, "rpgseries": {"1799": "O - One-on-One"}, "name": "The Gem and the Staff", "rpgproducer": {"18472": "Tim Kilpin"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1714991.jpg", "usersrated": "18", "average": "6.41667", "rpgissuearticle": {"16940": "Capsule Reviews"}, "rpg": {"389": "Basic Dungeons & Dragons"}, "poll": {}, "statistics": {}, "rpgcategory": {"2084": "Scenario / Adventure / Module"}, "rpggenre": {"155": "Fantasy (High Fantasy)"}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1714991_t.jpg", "description": "From the front cover: The stakes are high, and time is running out.
