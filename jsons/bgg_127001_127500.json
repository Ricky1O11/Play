It&rsquo;s heavily inspired by 90s fantasy comedy anime and manga like Slayers and Dragon Half, though the rules are derived from D. Vincent Baker&rsquo;s game Apocalypse World. Another way to think of it is it&rsquo;s a game for playing just the really silly parts of a D&amp;D campaign.<br/><br/>To play you&rsquo;ll need some friends to play with (at least three people total), some six-sided dice (two per player), pencils, and paper. Printouts of the playbooks work best by far, but any paper will do in a pinch.

Another problem was posed by artillery and other modern weapons. They made older fortifications pretty much obsolete and at the same time stores filled with ammunition have become prime targets.<br/><br/>This bunker is an example for modern ammunition storage taking these things into account. Its walls, as well as floors and ceilings are made of thick steel reinforced concrete, covered with a thick layer of soil and grass, both for additional protection and concealment. A single ramp leads down to the first massive steel door leading into an anteroom from where the actual storage area can be accessed through another such door.<br/><br/>A simple warning sign over the outer access hatch hints at the explosive contents of the bunker and only a few safety lamps provide illumination within, revealing rows of crates filled with mortar and artillery shells of various calibers equipped with a number of different payloads.<br/><br/>"}, "127018": {"rpgdesigner": ["Mike Fraley", "Phil Hatfield", "Raymond McVay", "Peter Schweighofer", "J.

In addition, you place three technology tiles at random on the tan, orange and violet sections of the tech chart and six random tiles on the brown section; the tech tiles show 1-5 arrows. You also shuffle tan, orange and violet decks of cards and place them in the appropriate places. Tan cards provide an one-shot effect, orange cards give you a permanent power, and violet cards present you with an objective you must meet; if you do so, you can play the objective card on your turn, and immediately draw another. You can play at most one card of each color each turn.<br/><br/>On a turn, a player takes one of three actions:<br/><br/><br/>    Place a new piece on a region of the game board, with this piece sharing two of the three characteristics of a piece in a neighboring region; the new piece cannot be shorter than the original piece. Mark this piece with a token of your player color.<br/>    Move one of your pieces on the board to an empty region, with short pieces moving only one space, medium height pieces moving up to two spaces, and tall pieces up to three.<br/>    Take over a region controlled by an opponent by moving one of your pieces into this region and relocating the opponent's piece to the region your piece left. You can do this only if the attacking piece is thicker than the opponent's piece.<br/><br/><br/>When you place a new piece on the board or move an existing piece, you're rewarded based on the color of the space you occupy. If you place in or move into a tan, orange or violet region, either you take a tile and the top card of this color or you draw three cards of this color and keep one of them. For a brown region, you either draw two tiles from the brown section of the tech board or draw one tile from anywhere. The technology tiles must be acquired from low to high &ndash; so you can't acquire a 4 unless you have a 3 &ndash; but you can have multiple tech stacks. You must meet a certain technology threshold in order to play the orange cards and acquire their special power.<br/><br/>In addition, you can score points during the game by occupying a grassland on a continent or the two regions on opposite sides of a waterway strait.<br/><br/>Players take turns until either all of the pieces are on the game board or all the tiles have been acquired or all the cards of one color have been drawn.

In Metal Adventures, you'll use cards to explore, enhance your ship and your crew, and live up to bold challenges. There will be negotiations, battle tactics, and the uncertainty and risk that really make a pirate's life.<br/><br/>During the game, each player uses a fancy four-wheeled astrolabe to track their power (which can be improved via equipment), damage (which reduces power), glory (which is how players win), and the &quot;judgement of pirates&quot; (which affects glory).<br/><br/>On a turn, a player either rests (gaining money and repairing their ship) or else travels (paying to do so), battles (either starships, planets or opponents), and optionally takes the &quot;tour of pirates&quot;, visiting one of the ten planets in the game and taken the action available there. Each player holds two trophy cards, and when they meet the conditions on one of them, they can reveal it to earn credits, glory or both.

It is an essential dungeon exploration game with hundreds of hours of playability and many unique features ~ including the fact that it may be played as a single player (SP) game or, with its included server, as an on-line game where a group of up to sixteen players from around the world or in a local neighbourhood, may play the Multi-Player (MP) version.<br/>As the game progresses beyond Volume I there is more interaction with the monsters and the occasional Non-Player Character (NPC) and a broader picture of the environment around the Dungeon and City of Dejenol emerges.<br/><br/>The game is played with characters whose attributes have been determined by the player and with the aim of progressively making your character or characters stronger, more capable and able to survive in the rich environment that will progressively unfold. <br/>In both single player(SP) and multiplayer(MP) you can explore the dungeon in a group of up to four characters.  In SP these characters are all created by you and you have complete control of them.  In MP, you can only play one character at a time, and must join with other players in order to make a party. Of course you can also choose to play with only one character, but a party has a greater chance of surviving the many perils that lie in the dungeon and beyond.<br/><br/>There are 9 different humanoid species which you may select for your character.  Think Human, Elf, Dwarf, Giant ... you get the idea!  Your choice determines how long you live, your basic characteristics (some are faster/stronger/smarter than others), your starting resistances to any special forms of attack (such as poison or acid), what alignment you can be (Good, Neutral or Evil), and which &quot;Guilds&quot; you can join.  A Guild is an organization dedicated to a profession ... but all characters start out as an 'Artisan' - a &quot;Jack of all trades and master of none&quot;.<br/><br/>There are 12 guilds in Demise, and your standing in these guilds represents how powerful your character is. Some Guilds only accept certain species, and some will not admit certain alignments, so think carefully about making these choices.<br/><br/>Guilds represent a way of life, and gaining levels as a member of  each Guild you choose increases the skills your character has related to that particular Guild.  The Warriors' Guild teaches characters how to fight, the Thieves Guild teaches characters to open chests without setting off traps, and the Sorceror's Guild teaches characters how to cast powerful spells at enemies.  In Ascension, a character can be anywhere from level 1 to level 1499 in a Guild to which they belong, with a level 1 character being a wimpy NOOB, and a level 1499 character being extremely knowledgeable and powerful in the ways of the Guild ( and perhaps a PITA on the forums ;-) ).<br/><br/>A character may be a member of more than one Guild at a time, but they can only learn (gain experience) from one guild at a time, and may switch their &quot;active&quot; Guild at any time.  However, since Guilds represent a way of life, certain Guilds are forbidden to use some types of weapons, armour or other items.  The Sorceror's Guild will not allow their member to swing a huge sword at his enemies as he or she may as a member of the Warrior's Guild, but similarly, when actively enrolled in the Warrior's Guild, he or she may not be able to use that powerful magic item that was 'won' in the last battle.<br/><br/>The original dungeon in Demise was limited to a little over 30 dungeon levels.  In each of these levels there are multiple areas or rooms, which are in turn are mapped to square cells (think of each cell as a 10' x 10' area or 3 square metres ). Note that the original dungeon was limited to 45 by 45 cells on each level.  Ascension 'includes' the original dungeon and game of course, but has more than doubled the area that may be explored with the addition of access to the regions beyond and further below.<br/><br/>An area or room may (and usually does) contain monsters that are increasingly more treacherous the deeper you travel in the original dungeon or the further 'abroad' you travel in the new regions.  Monsters can come in up to four groups.  Each monster in a group is of the same type, but there may be four groups of different types of monster.  There could be four groups of slaves in a room, OR there could be a group of 2 slavers, a group of 12 slaves, a giant centipede, and two black bears in a room.  If they delight in killing or think the characters have something useful or valuable on them, monsters will likely be hostile, but if the character or party look powerful, they might be warily peaced and possibly even run away.<br/><br/>Every time a character damages or kills a monsters he or she gains experience.  If a character gains enough experience, and are able to afford the fee, a level may be gained in their current guild, making them more powerful, and more likely to survive the dungeon.  When a character defeats a monster they may also find some gold, possibly an item and perhaps even a treasure chest.  As the characters grow more powerful, they can defeat stronger monsters, who will have more gold and better items.  The characters may also come across books of magic, which they can give to the magic using Guilds (who will pay them well), to allow research into powerful spells.  Characters can then learn these spells, provided they are a high enough level.<br/><br/>Eventually, after many, many hours, the characters may become powerful enough to face any monster in the dungeon, so you might consider then, that you have beaten the game.  Other players might consider that it is time to play a new character, a different race, or a member of different guilds, which offer different skills to the characters, and might repeat the process over and over and over ... of course you could always pay heed to those in the City who may have Missions or Quests, after all, the game does have a storyline that you may be well rewarded by following!<br/><br/>But, you don't need to go overboard - and remember you have different SP &amp; MP characters, just because your single player party can beat the strongest monster in the dungeon, what's to say there aren't players or parties in MP that can do it without raising a sweat?<br/><br/>If you HAVEN'T played the game - what on earth are you waiting for?

Power is the currency you will use to buy new, stronger cards to add to your deck. The goal of a deck-building game is to craft your personal deck into a well-oiled machine. There are five different types of cards that can be acquired: Enemies, Allies, Artifacts, Manuevers, and Locations.<br/><br/>To bolster their existing deck of cards, players use Power to acquire cards from &quot;The Path&quot;, a large, central stack of cards that supplies a five-card line-up from which players make their purchases. Each player will always have five face-up cards from which to choose each turn, so every turn there are new options and surprises.<br/><br/>When a player has amassed enough Power, he or she may defeat more powerful enemies from the &quot;Archenemy&quot; deck. &quot;Archenemy&quot; cards are represented  by the notable enemies from The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring, including Saruman, and the Balrog, among others. When an &quot;Archenemy&quot; is defeated, a new one appears and makes an Attack against each player in the game! Players can defend themselves with Defense cards like Boromir's Shield, Mithril Armor, &quot;You Shall Not Pass!&quot; and several others.<br/><br/>The objective for each player is to acquire the most VPs by the end of the game.

On a turn, a player announces that they'll play 1-3 cards, then they turn the cards over from their deck one by one, placing them on the tree as required by what's depicted on the card.

The snake must be placed between two other cards, the toucan tossed on top from a foot away, the leopard dropped straight onto the tree from a foot above, and the bat dropped onto the tree &mdash; but only after you close your eyes before extending your arm over the table! The beehive card can't be covered by anything except foliage and flowers, while the chameleon copies the card previously played.<br/><br/>If any cards fall off the tree while you're adding something to it, then you place those cards (and any cards that you've yet to place that turn) in a personal penalty pile.

The adventure is set in the Lortmil Mountains on a newly established trade route between Ulek and Verbebonc, but could be on any route that takes the characters through a mountain pass.<br/><br/>Adventure Background<br/><br/>Several years ago, the merchants of Tringlee, the capital city in the Duchy of Ulek, opened a new trade route through the Lortmil Mountains to the town of Verbebonc. However, in the last few months, reports of manticore raids along the route have filtered back to Tringlee. A month ago, the merchants hired a group of adventurers and sent them into the mountains to end the manticore raids. The party never returned.<br/><br/>The manticore raids are actually orchestrated by a juvenile red dragon that recently came to the region to increase its wealth and power. The red dragon, named Kardrako, has made its home in the back of the manticores' cave, which is set into a cliff several hundred feet below a bridge on the trade route.<br/><br/>Kardrako uses the manticores and, more recently, two hill giants named Geet and Gern, to waylay travelers and force them to pay a toll to cross the bridge. All of the money, of course, goes to Kardrako. The adventurers whom the merchants sent into the mountains did indeed locate the trouble they were sent to find. However, only one -- a rogue named Finglos &ndash; survived. Where his loyalties now lie is a matter for some debate.<br/><br/>The adventure consists of meeting Geet and Gern, finding Finglos, climbing down the cliff to the caves, exploring the caves, and ultimately facing Kardrako. All of the treasure that the manticores and the hill giants have collected rests in Kardrako's treasure trove.<br/><br/>"}, "127139": {"rpgartist": ["(Uncredited)"], "rpgitemversion": ["HTML Document"], "poll": [], "name": "The Candlemaker's Fire", "rpgdesigner": ["Jesse Decker"], "rpgproducer": ["(Uncredited)"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1352765.jpg", "usersrated": "0", "average": "0", "rpggenre": ["Fantasy (High Fantasy)"], "statistics": [], "rpg": ["Dungeons & Dragons (3rd Edition)"], "rpgpublisher": ["Wizards of the Coast"], "rpgcategory": ["Scenario / Adventure / Module"], "rpgseries": ["Cliffhanger Adventures"], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1352765_t.jpg", "description": "From the Web Page<br/><br/>Jesse Decker wrote the short adventure The Candlemaker&rsquo;s Fire for four 4th-level characters.

On his turn, a player must place one stone of his color on an empty point.<br/><br/>After a placement, if the two escorts of one or more squares are occupied by friendly stones and said squares aren't occupied by friendly stones yet, the player must place a stone of his color on each one of them, removing, where appropriate, any enemy stones already placed there. Note that some squares on the edge of the board have only one escort or no escorts at all. These squares are not affected by this rule.<br/><br/>The game is won by the player who completes a chain of orthogonally adjacent stones of his color touching the two opposite board edges of his color.

His reign was full of prosperity in all areas, like culture, science and politics. His life and his famous court are said to be the ispiration for the &quot;One Thousand and One Nights&quot; collection of folk stories.<br/><br/>In Al Rashid, players will take the role of the heads of powerful families, and will use the members of their families for trading, travelling, and ultimately trying to exercise influence over the court of the powerful ruler.<br/><br/>Al Rashid is a mostly deterministic strategy game &ndash; with a slight hint of randomness &ndash; based on worker placement, influence, resource management, and the efficient scoring of prestige points (PPs). As heads of families, players will have three different worker types at their disposal: the Sage, the Merchant and the Pasha. The three different types of workers, each with a different influence value, can be placed on the map of ancient Middle East to gain resources, or can be placed on the corporations to get more workers, or on government and imperial offices. The corporations represent several powers at the court of the Caliph: Intrigue, War, Science, Commerce, and Politics.<br/><br/>The game takes place over five turns, with turns split into two main phases: the placement phase and the resolution phase. Each phase is split in several rounds. During the placement phase players take turns placing their workers on the board. During the resolution phase they take turns deciding which action will be resolved. Each action, either a zone on the map or a corporation, can hold workers from all of the five players, but only the top three players, identified by influence and placement order will get to resolve the move. During placement workers can be added to the same areas to improve a players's influence. Players with higher influence will get a bigger and better effect out of the action they are resolving.<br/><br/>Resolving geographical areas will give a player resources. The resources come in five flavors: Wood, Pottery, Metal, Spice and Silk, and they can be used in trades. The dominating player &ndash; that is, the one with more influence, or in case of a tie, the one who placed first &ndash; will get three different resources, or all of the resources of one type (resources are distributed unevenly on the map), the second player will get two different resources and the third player just one.<br/><br/>The resources gained by resolving geographical areas can be used in the corporations to buy more workers or get government offices. Government offices work more or less like buildings in other placement games. Some give permanent advantages, some have a one-shot effect, and some can be used every turn. As for the geographical areas, having more influence will be advantageous, and dominating players will get cheaper workers or better effects out of the corporations.<br/><br/>The game contains no currency, so players will need to be careful when they combine resources to get money because if they pay more than they should, no change will be returned.<br/><br/>Every turn raiders will spontaneously appear on random locations on the map, so players will need to use some of their actions to hire mercenaries that can be used to combat the raiders and give them access to resources. Players accumulate PPs when they buy offices and workers, and at the end of the fifth turn the player with more PPs is declared the winner.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": ["First edition"], "average": "6.73951", "name": "Al Rashid", "playingtime": "100", "boardgamemechanic": ["Area Control / Area Influence", "Set Collection", "Variable Phase Order", "Worker Placement"], "age": "13", "usersrated": "329", "boardgamesubdomain": ["Strategy Games"], "boardgamefamily": ["Middle Eastern Theme"], "boardgamepodcastepisode": ["TDT - Episode # 301 - Throwing Games Away"]}, "127283": {"boardgamedesigner": ["(Uncredited)"], "poll": [], "name": "Krimi-Quiz 2", "playingtime": "0", "minplayers": "1", "yearpublished": "2012", "usersrated": "0", "maxplayers": "8", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1362613_t.jpg", "average": "0", "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["Ars Vivendi Verlag"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1362613.jpg", "boardgameversion": ["Ars Vivendi Edition 2012"], "maxplaytime": "0", "boardgamecategory": ["Card Game", "Trivia"], "age": "12", "minplaytime": "0", "description": "Trivia game about crimes.<br/><br/>71 entertaining and educational riddles about movies.

This Treasure Map indicates the Region where the Victory Cup is located--a final Quest required for victory!<br/><br/>During the game, one Treasure Map card is always visible as an Open Quest for any player to fulfill. To fulfill a Treasure Map Quest, a player must travel to the Region showing on the Treasure Map and dig there (using his &quot;Dig Dog&quot;). On doing this, the player claims one +1 Point Bonus Token and one Mystery Token (see below). The Treasure Map card is discarded face-up at the bottom of the Treasure Map deck and a new Treasure Map card is displayed on top (reshuffle as needed).<br/><br/>When one player reaches the Quest Goal, the Victory Cup Quest tucked beneath the Quest Goal is revealed, face-up, for all to see. The first player who fulfills both of the following conditions wins the game: a) the player&rsquo;s score meets or exceeds the Quest Goal, and b) the player uses a &ldquo;Dig&rdquo; symbol (on his Dog card) to unearth the Victory Cup from the Region showing on the card.<br/><br/>List of Mystery Tokens:<br/><br/><br/>    Artifact: Draw one Artifact from the top of the Artifact deck and claim it for free.

Players assume the roles of heroes called to the magical land of Storm Hollow to aid in a time of need. Each adventure provides a stand-alone game scenario with a specific story-driven goal for the players to try to accomplish, and multiple adventures can be strung together in campaign mode to experience fully interactive epic stories. Players work together to fight monsters, overcome obstacles, rescue characters, find lost treasures, and drive back the darkness using a simple skill-based system and unique heroic powers. Goals and progress are tracked using the game board and cards, and each scenario provides a different set of options and path to victory.<br/><br/>In a Storyboard Game, one player takes on the role of the Storyteller and runs the adventure, while the other players work together to achieve the scenario goals. Each scenario is made up of three connected scenes in which the players gain information about the problem, solve story challenges, and try to defeat a final action-based encounter. Success or failure in each scene provides benefits or penalties for the next scene, creating a narrative arc that unfolds differently each time depending on the choices the players make. A Storyboard Game rewards collaboration, teamwork, and creative problem solving by presenting players with multiple ways to approach each challenge and allowing for innovative and fun solutions to be effective at accomplishing goals. In campaign mode each adventure, whether won or lost, affects how the next part of the story will unfold and what resources will be available to players in future adventures.<br/><br/>The game comes with one book of 10 linked adventures that can be used as individual game scenarios or played chapter by chapter in campaign mode to reveal a grand overall plot. Storm Hollow also includes extensive Storyteller tools and materials to create and play your own scenarios and campaigns, including a fully fleshed out world full of unique creatures, locations, and lore.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": ["English first edition"], "average": "7.77778", "name": "Storm Hollow: A Storyboard Game", "playingtime": "60", "boardgamemechanic": ["Co-operative Play", "Dice Rolling", "Role Playing", "Storytelling", "Variable Player Powers"], "age": "5", "usersrated": "9", "boardgamefamily": ["Admin: Unreleased Games", "Crowdfunding: Kickstarter"], "boardgamepodcastepisode": ["Awesome In The Pants", "Episode 44 - Keep Up!", "Funding the Dream on Kickstarter Ep 115 Story Realms Legal Battle", "Funding the Dream on Kickstarter Ep 81 Story Realms and Angie Hickman"]}, "127325": {"boardgamedesigner": ["(Uncredited)"], "poll": [], "name": "Rock & Pop-Quiz", "playingtime": "0", "minplayers": "1", "yearpublished": "2011", "usersrated": "0", "boardgamefamily": ["Music styles: Rock"], "maxplayers": "8", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1362622_t.jpg", "average": "0", "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["Ars Vivendi Verlag"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1362622.jpg", "boardgameversion": ["Ars Vivendi Edition 2011"], "maxplaytime": "0", "boardgamecategory": ["Card Game", "Music", "Trivia"], "age": "12", "minplaytime": "0", "description": "Trivia game about rock and pop music.<br/><br/>71 entertaining and educational riddles about movies.

It has a board resembling a Monopoly board with spaces with sports competitions, training, and both specified and random events. The game features five decks of cards: One for each sport and one for random events, much like the Chance cards in Monopoly. Also included is a variety of paper currency.<br/><br/>The goal of the game is to train oneself and compete in the various sports to gain a million dollars. The first player to obtain that amount wins. The tournaments are divided into minor and major competitions with varying prize amounts for the first two places, as well as a &quot;walkover&quot; prize which will be handed out if only one player were to enter the competition. Training cards can be obtained in the training spaces. These cards are not only necessary to gain access to competitions, but can also boost the &quot;skills&quot; of the player when dice are rolled. Throwing dice is done to move on the board as well as determine competition winners, with the highest rolls winning unless card modifiers are in play. Other spaces include sponsorship funding, income taxes, injuries, travel fees, sporting luck (chance cards) and the start square, which trains a player in all sports.<br/><br/>While the game cover says that it supports 2-6 players, the rules inside the box mention 3-6 players. While it can be player with only two players, the game works much better with more players. Even 3 is quite few and in order to really play well, at least 4 players should be present as the competition dynamics really require that many players.<br/><br/>It was made and printed in South Africa.<br/><br/>"}, "127390": {"rpgdesigner": ["Graham Bottley"], "rpg": ["Generic / Universal"], "statistics": [], "name": "Celts", "rpgartist": ["Graham Bottley"], "rpgproducer": ["Graham Bottley"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1358486.jpg", "usersrated": "0", "rpgitemversion": ["Power Point"], "average": "0", "rpggenre": ["Fantasy", "History (Britain / Ireland)"], "rpgpublisher": ["Arion Games"], "rpgcategory": ["Accessory (dice, maps, screens, cards)"], "poll": [], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1358486_t.jpg", "description": "Publisher Comments<br/><br/>To make that first RPG experience even more memorable and exciting, Arion Games brings you this miniatures pack, full of visual goodies.

To secure Andor's borders, the heroes will embark on dangerous quests over the course of five unique scenarios (as well as a final scenario created by the players themselves). But as the clever game system keeps creatures on the march toward the castle, the players must balance their priorities carefully.<br/><br/>At the heart of Legends of Andor is its unique narrative, the linked scenarios of which tell an overarching story as the players successfully complete objectives. For each scenario, or &quot;Legend&quot;, a legend deck conveys the plot of an ever-unfolding tale...one in which the players are the protagonists. A wooden marker moves along the board's legend track at key points during each scenario, triggering the draw of a new legend card, the introduction of new game-altering effects, and the advancement of the story's plot. In the end, the players must endeavor to guide the fate of Andor through their heroic actions, bringing a happy ending to their epic fantasy tale.<br/><br/>Will their heroes roam the land completing quests in the name of glory, or devote themselves to the defense of the realm?

Often, special magic items are given to heroes by the gods (Perseus famously receives gifts ranging from Hades&rsquo; helm of invisibility to Hermes&rsquo; winged sandals), or other supernatural forces (many swords of Norse mythology, including Dainsleif, Hqfud, Ridill, and Tyrfing, are forged by the dwarves, who also make magic items for the Norse gods).<br/><br/>While such items are clearly the progenitors of the magic items found in modern fantasy RPGs, there&rsquo;s often a serious disconnect between how the two kinds of items work. Mythological items are often an important and defining feature of the heroes who carry them, and accompany those heroes throughout a large chunk of their adventures. Most magic items in the Pathfinder Roleplaying Game Core Rulebook are useful only at a fairly narrow range of character levels, and thus likely to be abandoned as more useful magic items become available. In terms of game mechanicc, this is a good design as it keeps characters excited about new treasure and ensures that much of the loot gained by overcoming encounters needs to be spent on or traded for new gear to overcome more powerful encounters.<br/><br/>However, it can be disappointing for players who grow attached to a magic item. If Dara the paladin overcomes a minor fiend early in her career, using a cold iron weapon she receives from the spirit of a local hero who died a generation earlier in the lair, she may be saddened to learn it&rsquo;s nearly impossible for her to take the time to have it enchanted to keep up with her as she gains levels. While not every magic item needs to be a prized possession throughout a hero&rsquo;s career, the idea of iconic, special magic items that do take such a role are appealing to many game groups. To help provide an option to fill those roles, Relics of the Godlings presents a new magic item, the godling relic, and numerous rules for adding them to a campaign.<br/><br/>"}, "127400": {"rpgdesigner": ["Christopher De La Rosa", "Ivan Van Norman", "Robert B.

To exert their power to these distant stars, they need you to go there on their behalf and act as their eyes, ears, and hands away from home. The FNH government needs reliable administrators who can think on their feet, loyal military officers to project its force, and determined Justice Commission agents to uphold the law where the colonial authorities cannot.<br/><br/>The Megacorporations want results and want them now and demand people who can get results fast, by any means necessary. They also need researchers, explorers, and workers for their projects on the frontier and spies and mercenaries for the darker side of inter-corporate competition. The locals need you, too: as a professional, a hired gun, an explorer or as a fellow colonist. You need the Frontier, too: opportunities and adventures abound there for both the hireling and the freelancer.<br/><br/>The Frontier is large, deep, and wide open. Humanity's young sphere of interstellar space is surrounded on all sides by unexplored space. At the edge of this tiny sphere lies the Outer Veil, a partly-explored, sparsely-settled region of space separating the known and the unknown. Despite its best efforts, the Core has little influence in these dark reaches, and nearly anything can be found there: unsanctioned colonies, pirate enclaves, secret laboratories, alien ruins, isolationist groups, strange worlds and colonies scraping out a living on the edge of the Great Unknown.<br/><br/>The space beyond the Outer Veil is unexplored, unknown and undisturbed by human exploration, habitation or influence. The future of Humanity lies beyond the Outer Veil, where untold opportunities, riches and dangers await the trail-blazing explorer. The present human institutions hold little or no power amongst these far stars; whatever lies beyond the slowly expanding Outer Veil is an enigma waiting to be explored and colonised: a new opportunity for Humanity to begin anew and build new civilisations.<br/><br/>Authority is scarce and your bosses, if any, are weeks of Jump travel away from you. The Core can only give you general guidance and standing orders; when trouble strikes, you have to make your own decisions. If you are the captain of a patrol frigate, the commanding officer of a Marine detachment, a colonial governor or a Justice Commission agent, you are the government. If you are a trouble-shooter or a local exec for a Megacorporation, you are the company. And if you are a freelancer, you truly are independent.<br/><br/>In the Outer Veil you are on your own.<br/><br/>Outer Veil includes background and historical information on the Outer Veil universe, eight new, setting-specific careers, statistics for 20 new starships and smallcraft, rules for asteroid mining and belting, a complete sector of space with UWPs and subsector maps, Referee's information on the Outer Veil setting, patrons and 'Brotherhood &amp; Justice', a complete introductory adventure ste in the Outer Veil universe.<br/><br/>"}, "127405": {"rpgdesigner": ["John Griffiths"], "rpgitemversion": ["PDF version"], "statistics": [], "name": "Outer Veil Sector Map", "rpgartist": ["David Redington"], "rpgproducer": ["John Griffiths"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1358768.png", "usersrated": "2", "rpgsetting": ["Outer Veil"], "average": "7.5", "rpggenre": ["Science Fiction (Space Opera)"], "rpgpublisher": ["Spica Publishing"], "rpg": ["Traveller (Mongoose)"], "rpgcategory": ["Accessory (dice, maps, screens, cards)"], "poll": [], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1358768_t.png", "description": "From publisher blurb:<br/><br/>The Outer Veil Sector Map is a full colour, high resolution, A1 size, complete map of the entire area of space of the Outer Veil setting.

To catch a pigeon, you must place a tile so that it covers the square or squares with the pigeon(s) you need. You may capture pigeons only if you need them; you cannot catch pigeons which belong to a flock already claimed by an opponent, but you can (re)catch pigeons from your or your team's flocks. You receive a tile for each pigeon captured and place those tiles on your goal card.<br/><br/>When you fill a goal tile, you place the tiles on it on your mat, optionally take a new goal card, play the now-freed goal card, then place the tiles on your mat wherever you wish to make one of your (or your partner's) flocks bigger, provided either of you have already built a dovecote to claim a particular flock as your own.<br/><br/>You can also use the tiles to breed falcons. You need to discard two of them to get a baby falcon and two more on a subsequent turn to have it grow into an adult falcon that you can then send to prey on your opponents' flock and make it smaller.<br/><br/>The game ends when no more goal cards can be drawn; any player with an unfulfilled goal card loses four points.

Each region can have 1-11 influence points placed there. Cards are used to move blocks and leaders from region to region, add influence points, exploit events, and bring protestors and militia to the Maidan. Blocks &mdash; representing political forces such as Pora, avid supporters and government forces &mdash; battle for the hearts and minds of the Ukrainian people. Blocks need to be present in a region to add influence points or for a leader to hold a rally in a region.<br/><br/>The Maidan may be activated during the game, leading to a sub game of amassing supporters and militia. The blue forces will have to choose to crackdown on the orange forces or allow the dangerous, but historical peaceful protests to swell. Will you bring Tulia Tymoshenko or Yushchenko to the Maidan to draw more crowds? Or use them to rally across the nation?<br/><br/>Orange Revolution will immerse you in the events of its namesake with thematic mechanisms, events and graphics.
