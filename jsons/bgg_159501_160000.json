Set around a deep, subterranean lake the villages residents &ndash; a curious mix of surface dwellers and dark creepers &ndash; live in relative peace and harmony. The arrival of surface dwellers, though, has caused tension in the village, as few of the villagers trust outsiders. With its strategic location as a staging post for expeditions into the Ebon Realm and its abundant resources of silver and precious gemstones Severed Umbra is unlikely to remain a free village for much longer.<br/><br/>Subterranean Enclaves are short, richly detailed supplements that each present a single subterranean settlement ready to insert into almost any home campaign. Perfect for use as a waystop on the road to adventure or as an adventure site themselves, Subterranean Enclaves present the details so the busy GM can focus on crafting exciting, compelling adventures.<br/><br/>This product is a Dual Format PDF.

Originally designed as a hunter-killer for the military but ultimately employed as police interceptors and high-end racing yachts, these sleek ships are built for speed. For the private market, the utilitarian military interior has been remodeled with luxury accommodations and components have been upgraded with cutting edge technology. No expense is spared, making a Kintar\u014d -class yacht a status symbol as well as a top tier racing machine.<br/><br/>This issue also includes the Tachikaze-class police interceptor. Developed in parallel, it uses the same hull design and general layout as Kintar\u014d but lacks the luxury d&eacute;cor and upgrades. It has an improved sensor suite instead of a swimming pool and detention cells rather than servants quarters, as well a barracks for half a dozen marines instead of a couple pampered guests. Both types of ship, as well as their support vessels (the Masakari jetbike and a law enforcement version of the Series-10 Comet shuttle) are fully detailed and illustrated in this chapter of the Codex.<br/><br/>The Kintar\u014d package contains four highly detailed, layered PDF files:<br/><br/>     Main Book<br/>         24 page PDF file detailing the ships, interior areas, and carried vehicles.<br/>         Contains several 3D rendered scenes as well as orthographic views of the ships.<br/>         Includes system independent statistics designed for easy adaption to your game of choice.<br/>         Background, art, and text are on different layers for custom display and printing.<br/>    <br/>     Map Pages<br/>         25 page PDF file containing complete interior maps and instructions for assembly.<br/>         Miniature-scale maps for tactical combat with an optional 1 inch = 5 ft grid.<br/>         Divided into pages for easy printing in full color or printer-friendly black and white.<br/>         Selectable layers include: grid, black &amp; white version, optional objects, and more.<br/>    <br/>     2 Uncut Map Images<br/>         Two single page PDF files containing giant 24 x 40 inch images of the complete deckplans.<br/>         Both the Kintar\u014d yacht and Tachikaze interceptor are included.<br/>         Select either a light or dark background (for printing or projection/display).<br/>         Includes layers for grid, black &amp; white version, optional objects, and background choice.<br/>    <br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Both Kintar\u014d and Tachikaze ships are 195 feet long. The former, with its enhance artificial intelligence suite, can be operated by a single person but has room for five additional guests and four servants or crew. The police interceptor carries a standard crew of five plus half a dozen optional marines.

To start, one player volunteers as Moderator and gives everyone a secret role on one of two teams: the Mob or the Feds. The fog of war is thick in the beginning, as players\u02bc first task is to use their secret passwords to identify who to trust. As the game goes on, players learn how to hustle as they continue to identify and organize their teammates, discover the other team\u02bcs secrets, sow misinformation, infiltrate the opposition, and score points&mdash;all while watching their own backs.

If you prefer more subtle magic, use demand to send suggestions to several creatures at once, even if you&rsquo;ve never met them.

What post apocalyptic game isn't complete without raiders?  They scour the wastelands in search of drugs, weapons, money, and even people to enslave and sell.  If it doesn't belong to them...it soon will.  Or they'll die trying to make it so.<br/><br/>And where do the raiders take their booty after a successful day pillaging the wastelands?  Back to their base, of course!  Which is what this map offers.  A place to track raiders back to their home.<br/><br/>Set in a pre-war bank (complete with vault and safe deposit boxes), the raiders have decided to make this their home.  It is well fortified, with old cars forming a wall around the bank, and sandbags placed and concertina wire strung to add that extra level of protection.  If that's not enough, the roof of the bank has been fortified as well, giving any defenders on the roof an added height advantage.<br/><br/>Of course, this could be nullified by smart players.  Any PC that examines the map will notice an old standing billboard just off a ways from the bank.  A great place to climb up and snipe those pesky guards on the roof!  In addition, there are other places to take cover, including old cars the raiders never got around to moving, as well as natural objects, like trees and bushes.<br/><br/>This map comes with a roof section that can be interchanged with the ground level as needed.  Before your players breach the interior of the bank, lay out the roof section and deal with the guards up there.  When your players are ready to go in, remove the roof section and lay down the interior.<br/><br/>In addition to any loot your players might recover from the bandits themselves, you have the option of making the bank vaults and safe deposit boxes still sealed.  If your players didn't come here hunting raiders, perhaps they're here to recover a pre-war artifact or weapon that might have been stored in one of these rooms.  The raiders aren't smart enough to open the vaults...but maybe your players are!<br/><br/>"}, "159965": {"rpgdesigner": ["Brandon Goeringer"], "rpgitemversion": ["PDF version"], "poll": [], "name": "Back Hatcher", "rpgartist": ["William McAusland"], "rpgproducer": ["William McAusland"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2031344.jpg", "usersrated": "1", "average": "8.5", "rpggenre": ["Science Fiction (Post Apocalypse)"], "statistics": [], "rpg": ["The Mutant Epoch"], "rpgpublisher": ["Outland Arts"], "rpgcategory": ["Sourcebook (rules/options to enhance play)"], "rpgseries": ["Creatures of the Apocalypse"], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2031344_t.jpg", "description": "From publisher blurb:<br/><br/>What&rsquo;s that squishy popping sound?<br/><br/>Walking anywhere in the wastelands of The Mutant Epoch is always risky, but swamps pose a whole new level of peril.

Elemental magic created the world and went into slumber for centuries, leaving myths about dreadful and marvelous creatures ruling over the living. Everybody knows fairies and trolls are just stuff of legends, right? Wrong! A few weeks ago, an adventurer awoke a powerful dragon and triggered a chain of events leading to the destruction of an empire. Magic is returning in a world shaken by sudden chaos. Armies are assembling to repel the awakening creatures and seize power!<br/><br/>In Drakerys, each player chooses a side, gathers miniature troops and takes the lead against other players in story-driven skirmish battles. The terrain setting as well as the victory conditions are laid out by a battle scenario all players agreed upon. The fate of warriors is determined through combat rules and some rolls of dice. As a war leader, you&rsquo;ll need tactical insight - and a bit of luck - to win!<br/><br/>The Starter Box contains everything you'll need to discover miniature games and enjoy Drakerys. Two armies are featured with fully assembled miniatures: the Human Paladins of Irosia and the wild Orcs of Ashral.<br/><br/>As the story begins, they are pitted against each other in a campaign to conquer a mysterious archipelago filled with danger, secrets about the magical events to come, not to mention countless treasures! The winning side will take an important advantage in the beginning war.<br/><br/>The old world is about to crumble. It&rsquo;s a time of heroes. Will you be the king of tomorrow? Find out with Drakerys!<br/><br/>The game uses classic fantasy army building with an fresh twist: players use a special Action Wheel to determine whose turn is it to play and what units can do. The same player can play several times in a row or execute glorious feats at the price of increased risks, or use a more cautions approach to moving his army. This unforeseen game mechanic sets a new vision in fantasy gaming strategies.<br/><br/>"}, "159982": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1171513.jpg", "poll": [], "boardgamedesigner": ["Travis Schario"], "statistics": [], "boardgamecompilation": ["Blankety Blank", "The Price Is Right"], "yearpublished": "0", "maxplayers": "8", "age": "8", "boardgamepublisher": ["Marks & Spencer"], "maxplaytime": "60", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1171513_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "60", "boardgamecategory": ["Movies / TV / Radio theme"], "description": "A combination edition published by Marks &amp; Spencers, to sell exclusively in their stores.<br/><br/>Blankety Blank is a board game based on the UK BBC TV quiz show of the same name first introduced by Terry Wogan in 1977, itself based on the 1970's version of the US Game Show Match Game.<br/><br/>The game simply involves guessing the missing &quot;blank&quot; in a sentence. The sentence itself often gives an innocuous clue to the blank. Players then compare answers and score points for matching answers.<br/><br/>One player acts as quizmaster and the other players take turns to be a &quot;contestant&quot; and a &quot;panelist.&quot; The quizmaster decides who the first contestant is going to be the first question is read out and the contestant and panelists write their answers on the sheet provided.<br/><br/>When everyone has recorded their answer, the contestant reads out his answer first, followed by each panelist in turn. Each time that the answer of the contestant matches that of the panelist the contestant gets a point.<br/><br/>The two contestants with the highest number of points then go on to play the &quot;Super Match Game.&quot; In this game there are three possible answers to each question--the answers are worth 50 points, 100 points or 150 points. When a player matches any of these answers, they record the number of points won. The player with the most points at the end of the Super Match is the winner and goes on to the Head to Head game, the last round.<br/><br/>In The Price Is Right, one player acts as host to set up the puzzles and verify correct answers. The other players make bids on prizes. The player who bids closest without going over plays a pricing game against the house for more prizes. (The television series rotates over seventy different games. Some home game editions contains as many as forty-five games; some as few as six.)<br/><br/>The finale is called the Showcase Round. The two players involved may be the players with the highest scores or it may be the players who won their respective Showcase Showdowns. (It depends on the edition of the game.)

The scale of the rules is designed for fighting the larger battles of antiquity, where armies would number 25,000 men or more, on an average sized table.<br/><br/>Missile and melee combat has been designed to reflect the fatigue and decline in fighting ability during the course of the battle.  While it is possible to defeat an opposing force with missile fire it will take quite a while compared to engaging in melee.  As troops take casualties, their morale will decline with one side usually routing from the field while the victor will usually only have a few losses.<br/><br/>As for battlefield tactics, one thing you will find is that using multiple lines and a reserve, though creating a narrower front, will have an advantage over an army arrayed in a single battle line with no reserve.  Attacking with fresh troops against fatigued enemies will usually result in victory for the army with the fresh troops.&quot;<br/><br/>"}, "159985": {"boardgamedesigner": ["James Cooke Brown", "Albert Lamorisse", "Michael I.

For the most part, M&uuml;ckenstich follows traditional trick-taking rules. The active player lays down a card, then each other player follows by playing a single card, following suit, if possible. Whenever a mosquito is played, that player declares one color to be trump. (The game starts with no trump color.) A mosquito or 12 played later in the round is considered higher than one played earlier. Once all players have laid down a card, the highest trump card (if any) wins the trick; with no trump, the highest card in the suit led for the round wins the trick. Players keep track of tricks won, and the winner of a trick leads to the next trick.<br/><br/>Once all tricks have been played, the single player with the fewest tricks names one suit to count double during scoring, then the single player with the most mosquitoes names one of the three remaining suits to be worthless. Then players tally their points: The first mosquito in a suit is worth -5 points, while all other mosquitos are worth 0. Suited cards are worth 0-2 depending on whether they are worthless, scored as normal, or doubled.<br/><br/>After a number of rounds equal to the number of players (or twice as many rounds with three players), the player with the highest total score wins.<br/><br/><br/>In Danger, players draw numbered and colored cards, trying to collect as many points as possible in each color each round without exceeding the limit of 15 points.<br/><br/>On a turn, a player draws the top card from the deck and places it in front of her in a row for cards of that color; some cards are multicolor, and the player chooses in which row to play these cards. After laying a second card in the round, a player has the option of securing a row at the end of each turn. To secure a row, the player must not have the lowest total in that color when compared to the other players; the player secures a row by turning the last card in that row 90&ordm;. A player can secure only one row each turn.<br/><br/>If a player exceeds a total of 15 points in a row, that row is now blocked and worth 0 points; the player turns those cards face-down.<br/><br/>If a player draws a colored card for a row either secured or blocked, she must discard the card. The next player in turn order has the option of taking this discarded card instead of drawing randomly from the deck.<br/><br/>Once the fourth row of any player is secured or blocked, the round ends immediately. Whoever has the fewest points in a color (with blocked rows worth 0 points) scores nothing for this color; all other players score points equal to the numbers showing in this color in their row. Players then empty their rows and continue playing with the cards remaining in the deck. After five complete rounds, the player with the highest total score wins.<br/><br/><br/>Zwickern is a public-domain card game of the fishing variety, in which the game starts with a pool of cards on the table and players try to claim these cards for points by using the cards in their hands. Most cards have a single number in the corner to show their value when being played, while some cards have two numbers (e.g., 2/12) and cards like these can be either value when played or when lying on the table; each card also has a victory point value.<br/><br/>On a turn, a player plays one card from her hand and either:<br/><br/>    Buys cards from the display (using an 8, for example, to buy a 5 and 3, or an 8, or all three cards)<br/>    Builds a pile of cards (by adding or subtracting the card played with a card or pile already on the table, or vice versa)<br/>    Plays to the table (making the card available for piles or buys on future turns)<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>After players play out the few cards in their hand, they receive a few more cards. After a certain number of rounds, the game ends and players sum the points of the cards they've collected, earning additional points for collecting the most cards and for buying all cards on display during a turn.

Players compete head-to-head to destroy each other's fleets and space station; the last player or team standing is the victor.<br/><br/>Gameplay:<br/><br/>Players choose from a variety of pre-constructed decks or can assemble their own, then each player takes turns either building up their base or building ships to attack their opponents. First player to destroy (or take over from boarding action) is the winner.<br/><br/>Each faction/deck has a unique power and varied amounts of resources generated each turn. With these resources you can add on modules to your base, or play ships/marines to the table. Your base functions as a mothership where your subsequent ships make up the fleet you will use for offense and defense. Each turn you will get more resources based on your base and the modules attached (which can add to your resource generation).<br/><br/>The ships and marines have different special abilities such as stealth (to avoid enemy detection). Some ships can even retrieve more ships from your deck at no cost.<br/><br/>Combat is resolved with d10s. You count up the total amount your roll for offense (based on the current stats of the cards involved) then roll. The target roll is determined by the defense of the ship. Most small ships can only take 1 or 2 hits, but larger ships will need multiple hits to take down. Wounds do carry over but there are mechanisms to remove some wound tokens over time.<br/><br/><br/>Second Edition Updated Rules<br/><br/>Stackable Traits are no more! <br/>To reduce the amount of math that HB Commanders have to do in combat, traits that granted a +X ability are being retooled.  Values are now only the printed numbers, and do not increase with any +X effects.<br/><br/>Trait-or-Fire!<br/>Use your weapons or a trait. That's one of the simplest rules in Hull Breach! It also now applies to stations as well &ndash; no more Target Painting for 4 and shooting 6 at the same target with your station. Stations should have advantages but testing reveals that certain station builds were becoming pwnmobiles, capable of ripping apart attacking fleets.<br/><br/>Spicing Up Events!<br/>The tried-and-true Event cards now have two possible outcomes: a Critical outcome and a Nominal outcome. When you deploy the card, you make a D10 die roll to determine what you'll get. A roll of a 1 or a 10 is a Critical outcome, and is in some cases a more powerful result, and sometimes a bad result for the person wielding the card. Any other roll result is a Nominal outcome, which results in the 'usual' outcome for that card.<br/><br/>Faction-Only Cards!<br/>Some cards, specifically some Marines, Upgrades and Events, are now marked as Faction-Only, meaning that only the faction printed on the card gets to use them. This has been done in an attempt to work a little more story flavor into the game. For example, Special Operations Groups represent the RDF Marine Corps' elite troops and are no longer available to non-RDF players. As compensation, Corporate Commanders can now field their own elite Marines known as Direct Assault Response Teams (DART).<br/><br/>Module Overhaul!<br/>There have been significant changes in the world of Modules. In HB Alpha, Modules were further divided into Module-Ship, Module-Station, and Module-Marine cards. No longer! They've been broken into more obviously different types depending on what they attach to, and we've made a more clearer distinction of size on ships, Stations, and Modules. One of the new things we can do is attach multiple mods to ships, and Stations are a little more narrowly restricted to what they can or can't attach, depending on what the purpose of the station is (military versus economy).<br/><br/>Say Goodbye to Characters!<br/>Character cards were a neat idea. Unfortunately they proved to be too frequently used as the basis for an entire deck strategy. So, they're all dead. Most, however, have been reborn as Add Personnel cards that can be attached to Marines and do something cool for your local units. The tradeoff is that they're no longer independent units that can board ships or stations and fire back at you, and they're nowhere near as powerful as they once were.<br/><br/>First-Turn Facefisting is Ancient History!<br/>We have implemented a couple of new mechanics at game start that will alleviate most first-turn knockouts. We've achieved this by revising the initiative rules for the starting phase of the game: the Commander with the smallest fleet and Station size (printed on the card, and mentioned above), begins play after the Setup Phase. So, if you deploy fewer or smaller ships than your adversary, you take the first in-sequence turn of the game rather than leave it to a die roll for initiative.<br/><br/><br/>New Combat Mechanics!<br/><br/>Initiative in Engagements<br/>Now controlled by unit size and progresses from the smallest ships up to the largest. The heavies are much slower and more cumbersome than your Fighters and Frigates, so they take longer to get into firing position.<br/><br/>Attacker and Defender<br/>Volley fire at each other in turn, in order of smallest to largest, with the exception of the defending Station getting first shot.  So: Defender station, then attacker's fighters, defender's fighters, attacker's Frigates, etc, all the way up to Capital Ships.<br/><br/>New Skirmish Phase<br/>The Interceptor Phase has been replaced by Skirmish.  Any ships with the trait Interceptor (defending) or Raider (attacking) get to jump to the head of the attack order line, for the first turn only.  No more extra turns for defenders!<br/><br/>Boarding Actions<br/>Just like volley fire, boarding actions (now part of the Maneuver Phase) adhere to initiative rules: smaller ships act first, reflecting the idea that faster and more maneuverable craft have the advantage in landing Marines on-target. Boards are not declared until the start of the Maneuver Phase, and once they're all declared, Escort effects are applied and then they're resolved in ascending size order.  You can now only declare a board on a ship of equal class size or larger.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": ["English edition 2014"], "maxplaytime": "60", "average": "6.96944", "name": "Hull Breach: Corporate Wars", "playingtime": "60", "boardgamemechanic": ["Hand Management"], "age": "13", "usersrated": "36", "boardgamefamily": ["Crowdfunding: Kickstarter"]}, "159502": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2055270.jpg", "poll": [], "boardgamedesigner": ["Jason Gough"], "statistics": [], "yearpublished": "2015", "maxplayers": "4", "boardgameartist": ["Jeremy S."], "boardgamepublisher": ["Casual Dragon Games"], "maxplaytime": "60", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2055270_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "30", "boardgamecategory": ["Dice"], "description": "Survive the Players, Survive the Island, Survive the DICE.<br/><br/>Playtime - 30 minutes plus.

That said, the captain has decided he's willing to keep two of you in his crew. To prove you're worthy, you will fight amongst yourselves, trying to shove other players' pirates off the end of the plank while keeping yours alive!<br/><br/>Get Bit! is a card game in which the player pirates find themselves in the ocean, competing to stay alive as others are being eaten by a shark. The order of the swimmers is determined by simultaneously playing cards face down, then revealing the values. The number on each player's card determines position in line (higher numbers in front, lower numbers in back), however ties don't move. The swimmer at the back loses a limb to the shark and is flung to the front of the line! The process is repeated until only two swimmers remain on the table. When this happens, the swimmer at the front of the line wins the game!<br/><br/>In Hold Your Breath!, the game is played in two rounds. In the first round each player may dive deeper, providing they have the &quot;Swim&quot; and &quot;Air&quot; cards to do so. Players press their luck each turn since it is the pirate who dives the deepest in round one AND resurfaces in round two who is the winner. Players can play &quot;Panic&quot;, &quot;Shark&quot; and other nasty cards on the other players, slowing their progress. In the second round each player struggles to reach the surface before they run out of air and therefore decide to take a rest (aka LOSE).

This ancient mystical arena was originally located in an abandoned Serpente subsystem forgotten by time. After the First Apocalypse, the Terrans built endless numbers of space platforms to colonize space, and an agreement was brought forth between the Terrans and a mystical sect of great influence to lease the space platform CETUS-7. The ancient arena was rebuilt on top of the platform, taking the galactic fights into space.<br/><br/>The Atomic Brotherhood holds all the broadcast rights for the Arena, netting them trillions of Credits for every minute of every fight. Their aptitude for organizing unconventional games makes them exceedingly popular with the masses, and now the time has come again. Gladiators from all over the galaxy are gathering on CETUS-7. Only five heroes will survive to face the coming Apocalypse. The Oracles have spoken the words: &quot;May the Zenites shine upon you.&quot; Those who cannot understand their meaning are destined to meet their doom.<br/><br/>Apocalypse Universe: Galactic Arena, the first of five projects set in the Apocalypse Universe, is a strategic science fiction &quot;hero vs. hero&quot; game that takes place in the Galactic Arena of CETUS-7. The guiding principle of this game is replayability. Each hero has different stats and abilities, allowing unique builds that depend on player choice.<br/><br/>The game is played by 2-6 players and can be played as 1vs1, 2vs2 or 3vs3. In 1vs1, the players follow a draft procedure and pick 1-3 heroes out of the ten available. After both players have chosen their heroes, they prepare them to enter the Arena. Heroes can equip weapons and special abilities before combat. The arena board consists of a grid of hexagons with starting positions, secret traps, and treasure crates.<br/><br/>Both players secretly choose, then reveal heroes, placing them on the two starting positions of the board. The hero with the highest initiative score plays first. The player controlling him is considered the attacker and his opponent is the defender. Each hero has a number of action points that can be used to perform his special abilities, to defend, or to attack. A ten-sided die is used for attacking and defending. The attacking player adds his hero's attack score to his attack roll and the defending player respectively adds his hero's defense score to his defense roll. When a hero is wounded, he loses health points &mdash; and at zero health, he's defeated.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": ["English first edition"], "age": "10", "name": "Apocalypse Universe: Galactic Arena", "playingtime": "30", "boardgamemechanic": ["Action Point Allowance System", "Area Movement", "Dice Rolling", "Grid Movement", "Take That", "Variable Player Powers"], "average": "6.55625", "usersrated": "48", "boardgamefamily": ["Crowdfunding: Kickstarter"]}, "159526": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2025712.png", "poll": [], "boardgamedesigner": ["Corey Somavia", "Panagiotis Zinoviadis"], "statistics": [], "yearpublished": "2015", "maxplayers": "2", "boardgameartist": ["Daniel Silverman"], "boardgamepublisher": ["Your Move Games"], "boardgameintegration": ["Battleground", "Battleground Fantasy Warfare: Dark Elves", "Battleground Fantasy Warfare: Dwarves of Runegard", "Battleground Fantasy Warfare: Elves of Ravenwood", "Battleground Fantasy Warfare: High Elves", "Battleground Fantasy Warfare: Lizardmen", "Battleground Fantasy Warfare: Men of Hawkshold", "Battleground Fantasy Warfare: Monsters & Mercenaries", "Battleground Fantasy Warfare: Orc Army", "Battleground Fantasy Warfare: Umenzi Tribesmen", "Battleground Fantasy Warfare: Undead Army", "Battleground Fantasy Warfare: Wuxing", "Battleground Historical Warfare: Second Punic War 218-201 BC", "Battleground", "Battleground Fantasy Warfare: Dark Elves", "Battleground Fantasy Warfare: Dwarves of Runegard", "Battleground Fantasy Warfare: Elves of Ravenwood", "Battleground Fantasy Warfare: High Elves", "Battleground Fantasy Warfare: Lizardmen", "Battleground Fantasy Warfare: Men of Hawkshold", "Battleground Fantasy Warfare: Monsters & Mercenaries", "Battleground Fantasy Warfare: Orc Army", "Battleground Fantasy Warfare: Umenzi Tribesmen", "Battleground Fantasy Warfare: Undead Army", "Battleground Fantasy Warfare: Wuxing", "Battleground Historical Warfare: Second Punic War 218-201 BC"], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2025712_t.png", "minplaytime": "50", "boardgamecategory": ["Ancient", "Card Game", "Dice", "Wargame"], "description": "This is an expansion for the Battleground system, although it can be played as a stand-alone game since it contains both opposing armies and the rules, containing the armies of Alexander the Great and the Persian Empire and explores Alexander's invasion of Persia.

Each map is highly detailed with random decorative elements put in to make the apocalyptic wastelands feel more alive than ever!<br/><br/>Wasteland Ruins III is focused on a common city river walk.  Evidence of older battles can be found here, whether that be the partially destroyed office building, or the doomed M1 Abrams tank.   Other minor details that give the map life include a statue to a fallen war hero, a potentially working anti-air tracked vehicle, and a collapsed bridge that may have fallen either due to age or damage from the battles that took place in this area long ago.<br/><br/>As with any of Stoneworker Cartography's battle maps, there is no need to print out the entire battle map.

They rule the Elemental Plane of Fire with a red-hot, molten iron fist. Their capital, the fabled City of Brass, is known throughout the multiverse as a great center of learning, culture, trade, and much more. Even the least among them is skilled in magic, by mortal standards, and their race was ancient when man and elf first came into being. They are also a proud race, and chafe at the thought of being forced to serve lesser beings, but the threat of fiery vengeance does little to dissuade the numerous spellcasters who nonetheless take it upon themselves to summon and bind efreet for their own mysterious purposes. It is rumored among these circles that there are some efreet who rival&mdash;or even exceed&mdash;the greatest efreeti nobles in power, and these are the mythic efreeti.<br/><br/>This book presents game statistics for a mythic efreeti, which has several unique abilities never seen elsewhere. A mythic efreeti can breathe clouds of thick black smoke on a whim to blind and disable their foes. They can also burn with much greater intensity than their lesser kin, and their ability to change the size of other creatures is enhanced as well. Perhaps their most notorious power is their ability to bind foes with golden shackles that impair their ability to fight, and also their ability to resist the mythic efreeti&rsquo;s power. Finally, in addition to the mythic efreeti itself, the book contains rules for performing special rituals that can be enacted by characters of any class in order to summon a mythic efreeti, as well as two such rituals: the flame warrior&rsquo;s calling, and the invocation of the chained sultan.<br/><br/>"}, "159598": {"rpgartist": ["(Uncredited)"], "rpg": ["Generic / Universal"], "poll": [], "name": "Kaiju Patrol Zero", "rpgdesigner": ["Berin Kinsman"], "rpgproducer": ["Berin Kinsman"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2023700.png", "usersrated": "0", "rpgitemversion": ["PDF version"], "average": "0", "statistics": [], "rpggenre": ["Action / Adventure", "Mecha", "Science Fiction"], "rpgpublisher": ["Asparagus Jumpsuit"], "rpgcategory": ["Campaign Setting (game world)", "Scenario / Adventure / Module"], "rpgseries": ["Official Series Bible"], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2023700_t.png", "description": "From publisher blurb:<br/><br/>Kaiju Patrol Zero is the revised version of Kaiju Patrol, the original, systemless Official Series Bible setting where you battle Giant Monsters and Evil Aliens with science!<br/><br/>Kaiju Patrol is currently being expanded into a complete game, powered by Fate!<br/><br/>"}, "159599": {"rpgdesigner": ["Jeff Lee"], "rpg": ["Pathfinder System Compatible Product"], "poll": [], "name": "Twin Furies", "rpgartist": ["Louis Porter, Jr. Design Studio"], "rpgproducer": ["Louis Porter, Jr. Design Studio"], "usersrated": "0", "average": "0", "rpgitemversion": ["PDF version"], "rpgsetting": ["NeoExodus: A House Divided"], "statistics": [], "rpggenre": ["Fantasy (High Fantasy)"], "rpgpublisher": ["Louis Porter Jr. Design, Inc."], "rpgcategory": ["Sourcebook (rules/options to enhance play)"], "rpgseries": ["Treasures of NeoExodus"], "description": "From publisher blurb:<br/><br/>The religion of the dark god Khayne is divided and scattered, with each small cult worshiping their bloody lord after their own malicious fashion.

Have you ever GM&rsquo;d for a player who always seemed to want to wander off into the woods (or the merchant district) in search of rare and exotic reagents and compounds for his next magical experiment, and struggled to come up with an exciting and suitably fantastic material for him to find?<br/><br/>Then this is the book for you. The sequel to the triumphant book A Necromancer&rsquo;s Grimoire: The Secret of Herbs, A Necromancer&rsquo;s Grimoire: Herbs of the Jungle continues its predecessor&rsquo;s unique approach to the sorts of low-cost special substances that can be created with the Craft (alchemy) skill. Presented herein are ten new jungle-themed herbs with very special properties, as well as everything you need to know about how to use them in your game.<br/><br/>Take the resailia, a strange herb that resembles a giant inverted carrot with a bright blue flower the size of a man&rsquo;s head. In addition to being a great substance from which to make arms and armor, and serving as an odd-looking but simple and effective one-man boat, extracts made from the herb can be used to increase or decrease the hardness of objects, allowing talented alchemists to mold steel like clay, or create solid blocks of non-frozen water.<br/><br/>Or perhaps you prefer the chordoit bean, which is similar to coffee beans in many ways, but prized for alchemical use as well as as a food item. It can be made into a stimulating elixir that does away with fatigue for a short time, or concentrated into a speed-enhancing potion that can be incredibly valuable in combat. More sinister applications include the jitter poison, which causes the victim to shake uncontrollably, and the chordoit powder, which causes restless sleep and itching.<br/><br/>Other highlights include a salve that allows one to meld affected body parts into the earth, a poison which causes its victims to float uncontrollably off the ground like a balloon, an elixir which enhances Charisma at the expense of Intelligence and Wisdom, and a curious elixir that allows one to stay awake even while they&rsquo;re asleep.<br/><br/>By themselves, each herb can be specially prepared into a handful of different special substances called preparations with a successful check, and further information outlines additional compounds and poisons that can be created by mixing two of these herbs together, for a total of over 70 new special substances and poisons.<br/><br/>Also included are guidelines for foraging and preparing these herbs, as well as optional rules for cultivating herbs deliberately and identifying the properties of unknown herbs, and many of the herbs in this book have special properties even without any special preparation. Whether you want to make the best alchemist (or witch, or hedgewizard, or even druid or ranger) ever, and display your superior knowledge of special plants, or just want to make sure that your players never look at a flower stand the same way ever again, don&rsquo;t pass this book up.<br/><br/>"}, "159637": {"poll": [], "name": "Giana Sisters: Twisted Dreams \u2013 Rise of the Owlverlord", "videogamemode": ["Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["Windows Downloadable edition"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3115038.jpg", "videogameseries": ["Giana Sisters"], "videogametheme": ["Cute Fantasy"], "usersrated": "2", "videogamedeveloper": ["Black Forest Games"], "videogamegenre": ["Platform"], "videogameplatform": ["Windows"], "average": "6", "statistics": [], "videogamepublisher": ["Black Forest Games"], "videogamecompilation": ["Giana Sisters: Twisted Dreams \u2013 Director's Cut"], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3115038_t.jpg", "description": "Giana Sisters: Twisted Dreams - Rise of the Owlverlord is a blistering platformer with morphing worlds, featuring seven brand new levels, a new boss and new gripping tracks from Chris H&uuml;lsbeck and Machinae Supremacy!<br/><br/>Dash through tricky levels and transform the whole world at will in this fast-paced platformer.

I was a fan, Jonathan was a pro, and we became friends after I started sending him postcards about Over the Edge outside the fanzine. First we were friends, then alternating GMs in our game group, then co-workers, and now collaborators again on 13th Age.<br/><br/>Fanzines rock. They&rsquo;re the place to try stunts that you might or might not come off, to test material that can then be focused down into your gaming group, to hone writing and design skills, and to find people you&rsquo;re going to stay in touch with the rest of your life.<br/><br/>In a weird sense, I have already had a fanzine-like experience with 13th Age. The 700+ pages of playtest comments we got on the core rulebook read just as much as a fanzine as playtest data. Alongside comments on bad wording and broken spells, there were oodles of campaign write-ups, cool little mini-adventures, delicious quotes, character and monster sketches, construction schemes for escalation dice, and even photos of a minis battle played out in front of a toenail painting party!<br/><br/>We half-designed the world of 13th Age, inviting people to fill in or recreate the pieces anew every campaign.

The lone player seeks to win more card points than the other two players together. Points are received for winning aces and tens in tricks, winning the last trick, and for the combination of king and over-knave of a suit.
