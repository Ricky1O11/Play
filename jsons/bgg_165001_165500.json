Most significant property is owned by clans rather than individuals.  There are people with elemental powers, and people with scales, living on every street &ndash; and their powers are directly incorporated into industry and life.  And Tenochans, while having the same degree of physical sexual diversity as real people, often marry in groups, and sort themselves into three base genders, rather than two (man, woman, arha).<br/><br/>IT IS A PLACE WITH PROBLEMS.  Just off the eastern coast of Tenocha lies the reach, an island chain ruled by dragons and with whom Tenocha is perpetually at war.  It has enemies inside; cults operate in secret across Tenocha, calling up diabolical entities to bind or worship. It is built on an unstable base; the magical industries of the region are powered by decaying artifacts, which cannot be repaired or replaced easily.  And it is stratified - Status is based on age, class, race, and gender, in a system vastly different from our own, but still one that is deeply imperfect and unequal.<br/><br/>Note: THIS IS A LIVING DOCUMENT.

After this first part of the game, 2 VPs are awarded to the player with the most recruits.

Have you ever imagined leading troops, which included elephants over the Pyrenees and the Alps to try to conquer Rome? Have you enjoyed a good historical novel dated on the old Republic of Rome, and you would like to travel to that time?<br/><br/>ONUS! Rome Vs Carthage is a war game similar to miniatures games in which both sides fight an ancient battle. The game is mainly based on the II Punic war, although battles from III to I B.C centuries can be also simulated. The game concept combines both, orders and events cards, that makes each game different and each combat becomes unpredictable and thrilling.<br/><br/>ONUS! can be played anywhere but to get the best gaming experience we do recommend a game area as large as possible, i.e. 3.2 x 2.9 feet (100 x 90 cm)<br/><br/>Units are represented by cards which have been scaled around a Centuria (also known as Century) or to a Maniple (also known as Manipulus), representing formations from 80 to 100 men for Infantry units, 20 cavalrymen for Cavalry units or 6 Elephants.<br/><br/>Units have their own set of traits to represent permanent attributes of the unit, like Melee Combat, Range Attack, Defensive capacity, Morale and Life, and Movement capacity. This set of traits gets bonuses and penalties depending on the ongoing situation and combat engagements.<br/><br/>Units also have their unique set of skills to represent specific abilities they can perform: from defensive formations to extremely effective techniques to attack enemies. Some of these skills need to be activated, meaning only one of them can be used in an engagement, while others are inherent to the units.<br/><br/>Leadership is represented in the game by the figure of the General. A General&rsquo;s token represent his HQ and its own escort. In addition to the leadership benefit, a General grants bonuses to nearby units, boosting the morale of the troops and providing additional benefits when they are engaged with the enemy in those bloody encounters. Both, Hannibal and Scipio, two well-known Generals are included in the game with their unique set of bonuses! Also, Heroes, Veterans and Elite units take part in Onus!<br/><br/>In more detail, ONUS! Rome Vs Carthage is played in turns, composed by six different phases each:<br/><br/>1.    Activation of Units: in this phase, the active player can play any number of Order cards from his hand, stating what units are going to be used during the turn.<br/>2.    Movement and Charges: in this phase, the active player may move all those units activated in the previous phase. Those units finishing their movement in contact with enemy units, may Charge against them.<br/>3.    Range Attack: those active units able to carry out Ranged Attacks and which haven&rsquo;t moved or executed a Reduced Movement may shoot enemies within its maximum range. Also, special units like Skirmirsher have this skill, thus they may want to use this ability.<br/>4.      Skirmishers: units having these specific skill can harass enemy units, provided they haven't spent all their movement points.<br/>5.    Combat: All engagements are resolved in this phase, being the active player the one choosing the order of combats.<br/>6.

These cards must be resolved first according to the symbols printed on them. After this, each player moves its marker the number of spaces indicated on that same card.<br/><br/>Players then explore the boards turning the tokens around and seeing what lies beneath, looking for their 4 objectives.<br/><br/>Hidden beneath the tokens may be be good things, objects or enemys.

Thus they became Nutri-Masters and created the seven kingdoms of nutrition where even today they retain the foods that were entrusted to them and the secrets of their incredible NUTRI-POWERS.<br/><br/>30 years later NUTRILAND became gray and entirely dominated by ALEX GRAND, which gave it a new name - GRANDLAND. The population forgot food over time and ALEX became an businessman adored by all and the GENEX-100 the only food available.<br/><br/>Having realized ALEX&rsquo;s scheme, and having discovered the existence of food, TEO, LENA, BEN and NINA take on the exciting mission to discover the seven kingdoms of nutrition and restore food diversity to GRANDLAND.<br/><br/>"}, "165009": {"rpgartist": ["Mohammad Ramlan", "Robert Treherne, III", "Vojislav Vasiljevik", "Buddy Wagner"], "rpg": ["P.E.R.K.: The Pretty Easy Roleplaying Kit"], "statistics": [], "name": "P.E.R.K.

Though, the pieces and their abilities, in addition to 20-sided dice (called action dice, or AD) are what makes this game maintain its role-playing aspect. Each character has the following attributes:<br/><br/>Hitpoints: Ranging from 8 to 14. Based on the physical prowess of a character, the Hitpoints of the character can change. for example, the Sorcerer only has 8 hitpoints, while the Knight has 12 and the Warrior has 14.<br/><br/>Armor Points: Ranging from 1 to 4. The difference between armor and health being that you can roll a D20 to try and negate damage as damage will always go to armor first.<br/><br/>Accuracy: This is broken up into either melee, ranged, magic, or shield accuracy. You must roll equal to or higher than the indicated number. Rolling a 19 or 20 will cause a CRIT, usually causing double damage. When you have to hit your target you roll however many action dice your weapon allows. Refer to your accuracy, and if the dice you rolled are equal to or above your accuracy, you successfully hit.<br/><br/>Weapons: Each character has some form of a melee weapon. Most characters will be able to cause either 4 or 6 total damage with their weapon. Though the way it is caused is different for every character. The knight with a flail rolls 1 action dice causing 6 damage. While the Crusader with his longsword rolls 6 action dice each causing only 1damage. The Cleric with his hand mace causes 4damage with 1 action dice, while the Sorcerer and their casting staff rolls 2 action dice each causing 2 damage.<br/><br/>Movement: Movements between the characters vary based on their maneuverability and battlefield mobility. The ranger holds roots to the Bishop of Chess, allowing them to go as far as they want in a diagonal line. The knight is able to move in the classic 'L-move' associated with knights of Chess. Though when it comes to the Crusader (able to move up to 2 squares diagonally) or Assassin(able to move up to 2 squares in ANY direction) Cathedr'l takes on its own personality as characters must use their unique movement to navigate the battlefield.<br/><br/>Spells: The Sorcerer, Cleric, and Paladin, utilize magic to support themselves and their allies in combat with powerful abilities only used by the select few magic users of Cathedr'l.<br/><br/>Abilities: Abilities are what will allow certain characters their unique traits. The Warrior and his Charge ability allow him, like a pawn, to move up to 2 squares on his first movement. The Paladin with the ability of STED, has built extreme strength and endurance and has an extra Hitpoint that regenerates at the end of every turn, essentially ignoring 1 point of damage whenever he is hit.<br/><br/>Using a system that is as deep and complex, as a tried and true RPG, and the unique strategy offered by chess, both players will use strategy and the role-playing aspect of a 20-sided Action Dice in order to outsmart and gain better positioning against their opponents. <br/>   <br/>   In order to beat the game, you must slay your opponents King AND Queen. After slaying either of the two 'royal' characters on your opponent's team, all of the their characters that started the game on their respective royal's side of the board, go into exile and are removed from play. This allows for another layer of strategy as slaying your opponents king or queen can leave your opponent at half strength and weak against your troops.<br/><br/>"}, "165026": {"poll": [], "name": "Ray Tracers", "videogamemode": ["Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["European Playstation edition", "Japanese PlayStation edition", "PSN edition", "US PlayStation edition"], "average": "0", "videogameseries": ["Chase H.Q."], "videogametheme": ["Driving"], "videogamegenre": ["Action", "Arcade"], "videogamedeveloper": ["Square Enix", "Taito"], "videogamefranchise": ["Chase H.Q."], "videogameplatform": ["PlayStation", "PlayStation 3", "PlayStation 4", "PlayStation Vita", "PSP"], "usersrated": "0", "statistics": [], "videogamepublisher": ["Sony Computer Entertainment", "Square Enix", "Taito", "THQ"], "description": "Ray Tracers is an arcade-style auto racing and combat video game released by the Taito Corporation in 1997 for Sony's PlayStation game console.<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;Ray Tracers&quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "165027": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2686830.jpg", "boardgameimplementation": ["Song of Blades and Heroes", "Song of Gold and Darkness"], "poll": [], "boardgamedesigner": ["Eric Louchard"], "statistics": [], "yearpublished": "2011", "maxplayers": "3", "boardgameartist": ["Giovanni Castro", "Melvin de Voor", "Eric Louchard", "Andrea Sfiligoi"], "boardgamepublisher": ["AntiMatter Games"], "maxplaytime": "30", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2686830_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "30", "boardgamecategory": ["Expansion for Base-game", "Miniatures"], "description": "From the publisher:<br/><br/>Our group was not prepared for the horrors of the Stygian Depths, as we have named the accursed lands below.

In most cases, these feats require an ally with the same feat to have a specific position on the battlefield. Teamwork feats provide no bonus if the listed conditions are not met. Allies who are paralyzed, stunned, unconscious, or otherwise unable to act do not count for the purposes of these feats. Inquisitors and cavaliers have special class abilities that allow them to use teamwork feats even when their allies do not have the feats.<br/><br/>The 47 feats in this book are all Teamwork feats that can allow your characters and their allies to work together in combat -- and in other areas! -- when they have like abilities.<br/><br/>This book contains feats from the PRD and from third-party publishers.<br/><br/>"}, "165087": {"rpgdesigner": ["Owen Barnes", "Jordan Goldfarb"], "rpgitemversion": ["PDF version"], "poll": [], "name": "Dark Heresy Second Edition: Game Master's Kit", "rpgartist": ["Alex Boca", "Matt Bradbury", "Ilich Henriquez", "Mathias Kollros", "Mark Molnar", "David A.

It was developed primarily by Edge of Reality, with the Nintendo 3DS version developed by WayForward Technologies. It was published by Activision and released worldwide on June 24, 2014. It is the third installment in the War for Cybertron series and the fourth installment in the movie game series. The game was released on June 24, 2014 for Microsoft Windows, Nintendo 3DS, PlayStation 3, PlayStation 4, Wii U, Xbox 360, and Xbox One. The game serves as both a prequel to Transformers: Fall of Cybertron and the film Transformers: Age of Extinction.<br/><br/>The console and Microsoft Windows versions of Transformers: Rise of the Dark Spark are a third-person shooter, much like its predecessors from High Moon Studios Transformers: War for Cybertron, Transformers: Fall of Cybertron, and Transformers: Dark of the Moon. The game has a single-player campaign. Escalation, the online multiplayer mode where four players fend off waves of increasingly tough enemies, returned with the addition of upgradable defenses. The mode features over forty playable characters, and has levels based on both Cybertron and Earth. Escalation mode is absent in the Wii U and 3DS versions of the game. In addition, experience points collected by players in both single and multiplayer will be shared.<br/><br/>The 3DS version of the game is a strategy RPG.[6] Melee combat is turn-based. The player is given three rounds to deplete their opponent's health. If successful, the enemy is removed from the overworld map. The player can choose from seven different attacks, each with their own recharge time after each use. Combat will use 3D rendered character models, while the overworld screen uses 2D sprites, similar to the 3DS game Fire Emblem Awakening.<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;Transformers: Rise of the Dark Spark&quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "165290": {"poll": [], "name": "Grid Autosport", "videogamemode": ["Network Multiplayer", "Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["PS3 download edition", "PS3 physical edition", "Windows edition", "Xbox 360 download edition", "Xbox 360 physical edition"], "average": "8.85", "videogametheme": ["Driving"], "usersrated": "2", "videogamedeveloper": ["Codemasters"], "videogamegenre": ["Racing"], "videogameplatform": ["PlayStation 3", "Windows", "Xbox 360"], "videogamehonor": ["2014 Global Game Awards Best Racing Game of the Year Nominee"], "statistics": [], "videogamepublisher": ["Codemasters"], "description": "Grid Autosport (styled as GRID Autosport) is a racing video game by Codemasters and is the sequel to 2008's Race Driver: Grid and 2013's Grid 2.

The aim of the game is to amass victory points by shipping goods to Europe or by constructing buildings.<br/><br/>Each player uses a separate small board with spaces for city buildings, plantations, and resources. Shared between the players are three ships, a trading house, and a supply of resources and doubloons.<br/><br/>The resource cycle of the game is that players grow crops which they exchange for points or doubloons. Doubloons can then be used to buy buildings, which allow players to produce more crops or give them other abilities. Buildings and plantations do not work unless they are manned by colonists.<br/><br/>During each round, players take turns selecting a role card from those on the table (such as &quot;Trader&quot; or &quot;Builder&quot;). When a role is chosen, every player gets to take the action appropriate to that role. The player that selected the role also receives a small privilege for doing so - for example, choosing the &quot;Builder&quot; role allows all players to construct a building, but the player who chose the role may do so at a discount on that turn. Unused roles gain a doubloon bonus at the end of each turn, so the next player who chooses that role gets to keep any doubloon bonus associated with it. This encourages players to make use of all the roles throughout a typical course of a game.<br/><br/>Puerto Rico uses a variable phase order mechanic, where a &quot;governor&quot; token is passed clockwise to the next player at the conclusion of a turn. The player with the token begins the round by choosing a role and taking the first action.<br/><br/>Players earn victory points for owning buildings, for shipping goods, and for manned &quot;large buildings.&quot; Each player's accumulated shipping chips are kept face down and come in denominations of one or five. This prevents other players from being able to determine the exact score of another player. Goods and doubloons are placed in clear view of other players and the totals of each can always be requested by a player. As the game enters its later stages, the unknown quantity of shipping tokens and its denominations require players to consider their options before choosing a role that can end the game.<br/><br/>The new buildings are: Aqueduct, Forest House, Black Market, Storehouse, Guesthouse, Church, Trading Post, Small Wharf, Lighthouse, Library, Speciality Factory, Union Hall, Cloister, and Statue.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": ["First edition", "Second edition"], "average": "8.10213", "name": "Puerto Rico + Expansion I", "playingtime": "150", "boardgamemechanic": ["Variable Phase Order"], "age": "12", "boardgameexpansion": ["69178", "159761", "40688"], "usersrated": "47", "boardgamefamily": ["Alea Big Box", "Colonial Theme", "Country: Puerto Rico", "Puerto Rico", "Tableau Building"]}, "165333": {"poll": [], "name": "The Game of Roaches", "playingtime": "15", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": ["Dice Rolling", "Role Playing", "Storytelling"], "yearpublished": "2015", "usersrated": "0", "maxplayers": "7", "boardgamefamily": ["Admin: Unreleased Games", "Animals: Cockroaches", "Crowdfunding: Kickstarter"], "average": "0", "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["(Self-Published)"], "boardgameversion": ["First edition"], "maxplaytime": "15", "boardgamecategory": ["Animals", "Children's Game"], "age": "5", "minplaytime": "15", "description": "The Game of Roaches is a beginner RPG that allows players to play as roaches who are trying to take over the house for themselves.

Surprisingly throughout the years, the basic attributes of these races have remained the same despite sweeping changes to the worlds around them. It begs the question &ldquo;What makes these races what they are?&rdquo; Just being born an elf doesn&rsquo;t mean they&rsquo;ll be an archer or mage, despite both archetypes being explored in detail over the years. We took examples from real world cultures and analyzed the different archetypes these races fill, what makes them perceived as they are and what makes them stand out in the minds of fans across the globe. Within are suggestions on how to create a culture in your game that enhances your races and world, with mechanical reinforcement to help bring them to life. With specialized classes from some of our favorite fiction, reimaginings of races into new archetypal roles and a boatload of racial feats from the excellent Christos &ldquo;+5 Toaster&rdquo; Gurd, you&rsquo;ll be hard pressed to think of the peoples that make up your setting of choice in the same way ever again.  <br/><br/>New Prestige Classes<br/><br/><br/>     Magelord [Elf]: Part politician, part specialist mage with the unique &quot;arcane cascade&quot; mechanic. <br/>     Bladesinger [Elf]: Part magus, part arcane archer, part bard- all elven grace. <br/>     Emissary [Human]: A human who adopts elements of another race/faction in order to gain bonuses against their enemies. <br/>     Battlesmith [Dwarf]: He crafts, he fights, and he drinks (hopefully in that order).

Players control the eponymous Spidy, an extraterrestrial spider, and navigate him through a series of levels that are filled with deadly obstacles. Spidy can run and jump, and has the ability to shoot a web, allowing him to grapple and swing from object to object within the environment. Interspersed throughout each level are a large number of orbs, which Spidy can collect to score points. Finishing the level quickly, collecting a large number of orbs, collecting several orbs in quick succession, and finding score multipliers all increase the player's score for that level. Players can also lose points by dying, collecting certain orbs that decrease the player's score, or going for too long without collecting an orb. Players earn between one and five stars on each level, based on their score. Levels are grouped into several stages, including a forest, a pond, a cave system, and outer-space. In order to progress from one stage to the next, players must collect a certain number of stars. Players can collect special power-up orbs scattered throughout levels. These orbs allow Spidy to perform feats he is otherwise incapable of, including traveling underwater and jumping to extreme heights. There are 69 levels in the game, and most of them take between 90 seconds and three minutes.<br/><br/>"}, "165386": {"poll": [], "name": "Standard Action: Legend of the Lonely Dragon", "videogamemode": ["Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["Web Browser edition"], "average": "0", "videogametheme": ["Comedy", "Fantasy", "Medieval"], "videogamegenre": ["RPG"], "videogamedeveloper": ["(Self-Published)", "Dragonprime"], "videogamefranchise": ["(Unreleased Games - Available)"], "videogameplatform": ["Web Browser"], "usersrated": "0", "statistics": [], "videogamepublisher": ["(Web published)"], "description": "<br/><br/><br/>    <br/>        <br/>UNRELEASED GAME &ndash; IN BETA<br/><br/>    <br/>    <br/>        <br/>This game is in Beta and has not been fully released yet.<br/><br/>    <br/><br/><br/>User Summary<br/><br/>Standard Action: Legend of the Lonely Dragon is a web browser RPG that is based on the fantasy comedy series Standard Action.<br/><br/>"}, "165387": {"poll": [], "name": "BlackSoul: Extended Edition", "videogamemode": ["Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["Windows Downloadable edition"], "average": "0", "videogametheme": ["Horror"], "usersrated": "0", "videogamedeveloper": ["XeniosVision"], "videogamegenre": ["Adventure"], "videogameplatform": ["Windows"], "statistics": [], "videogamepublisher": ["XeniosVision"], "description": "User Summary<br/><br/>BlackSoul is a third person survival horror adventure game that takes place somewhere in the English countryside, in 1972.

These tiles may reveal enemies, such as wizards, elves and orcs; villages; or even lost royalty, optimistically eager for a lift home. The player then flies to a new location before raining fireballs down on any unsuspecting foes, using the flaming tower of death to determine where they land.

The first player to play all of their cards ends the game and then players count up the scores of all of the cards that they captured minus all of the cards that they didn&rsquo;t manage to get rid of. The player with the highest score wins the game.<br/><br/>The rules are simple but the strategies can be complex. Skill and luck play their parts in equal measure in this short but engaging card game. It pays to get rid of your cards and be the Ghost Hunter who ends the game but victory is never assured until the final scores are counted.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": ["The Game Crafter first edition"], "maxplaytime": "20", "average": "6.43333", "name": "Ghost Hunter", "playingtime": "20", "boardgamemechanic": ["Hand Management", "Take That", "Trick-taking"], "age": "13", "usersrated": "9", "boardgamefamily": ["Crowdfunding: Kickstarter", "Ghost Hunter"]}, "165486": {"rpgartist": ["(Uncredited)"], "rpg": ["Fudge"], "statistics": [], "name": "CyberFUDGE", "rpgdesigner": ["David Jaquith, Jr."], "rpgproducer": ["David Jaquith, Jr."], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2233238.png", "usersrated": "0", "rpgitemversion": ["PDF Version"], "average": "0", "rpggenre": ["Fantasy", "Science Fiction (Cyberpunk)"], "rpgpublisher": ["(Web published)"], "rpgcategory": ["Core Rules (min needed to play)"], "poll": [], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2233238_t.png", "description": "from the Introduction<br/><br/>Hello.

The Majority is a Japanese card game to form strong political factions and gain the most money! The Majority Complete Edition combines two games previously available only in Japan, The Majority and The Majority 2.<br/><br/>The Majority:<br/>The Majority is playable with 3 or 4 players. In a 4 player game, the game is played in teams of 2, forming a 2 versus 2 game. In this game, each player will be playing a card from his or her hand to form political parties. Cards have different special abilities as well as strengths in the political party. Players will be using these cards to form a strong and powerful party. However, in this game, having the strongest party won't make you the most money. Instead, being the second most powerful party will grant you more money! Remember though, that getting some money is always better than getting nothing. You must carefully coordinate your plays with your partner so that you and your partner will end up with the most and second most powerful party!<br/><br/>In a 3 player game, the game is played almost identically. However, you will not have a partner, so it will be a 3 person free for all. You will need to play cleverly to ensure that you will end up with more money than your opponents!<br/><br/>The Majority 2:<br/>The Majority 2 is playable only with 2 players. In this game, a player's goal is to create more political factions with higher authorities than his or her opponent. Board members are the various residents of the pandemonium, including Witches, Demons, Dragons, Angels, and Reapers. These inhumane creatures are equipped with exciting and powerful special abilities that can aid their factions or hinder their opponents. The game has a very unique card drafting mechanics where the hand of cards are shared between the player and their opponent.
