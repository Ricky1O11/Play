The opposing players have the option to play in which they must get two tricks to succeed.

Each player attempts to control a single tribe, to ensure the survival of his tribe, and to boost it along the road to civilization. Towards this end, players work to control the normally random movements of their tribes across a hexagon grid representing a typical area of the pre-historic world, so as to avoid or destroy hostile tribes, contact friendly tribes, and gather as much food as possible.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;The success or failure of previous actions influences a tribe's willingness to obey a leader's orders. Tribes may be ordered, among other things, to go on the warpath against other tribes, to strip the immediate area bare of food, or to conduct mystic rituals, which may have dire results. A unique aspect of this simulation is that, theoretically, a player may win by ordering nothing at all. Of course, victory is more likely if the leader seizes control of the tribe and leads it boldly into the future... or perhaps into a tar pit.&quot;<br/><br/>The following comes from an advertisement for the game in The Dragon #42:<br/><br/>&quot;COULD YOU LIVE WITHOUT METAL, POTTERY, FARMING OR FIRE?&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Well, Java Man could ... sometimes.

My training has been in all aspects of infantry combat, and my research has included not only books but interviews with combat infantry veterans of WWII . . .

The rules are written with the works of Victorian science fiction authors in mind, such as Wells, Verne, and Haggard. In addition to standard colonial era actions, special rules are included for adding various science fiction elements to the plot, including, but not limited to, steam conveyances, fabulous inventions, glorious weapons, and strange creatures from the depths of the jungle or the core of the Earth.<br/><br/>In G.A.S.L.I.G.H.T., units generally consist of ten figures led by one or more Main Characters. A player normally controls one or two units. A player may also control one or two vehicles and their crews. G.A.S.L.I.G.H.T. includes rules for creating Main Characters with somewhat more detail than the Extras. The games then are a combination of unit actions and individual heroism in the tradition of adventure novels and swashbuckling films.<br/><br/>Command and control is accomplished through a card-based turn system. Movement is based on moving individual figures. Firing is done by figure as well, but the firing procedure is very quick. Morale is accomplished through a unique, stateless system that treats loss of cohesion in an novel way.<br/><br/>Detailed charts are provided for creating personal weapons, heavy weapons, vehicles, and fantastic creatures. The concept used in G.A.S.L.I.G.H.T. is that of imperfect mechanization -- machines don't always work as intended. This often adds a bit of excitement and humor to the games.<br/><br/>The authors of G.A.S.L.I.G.H.T. made the specific design choice not to build their own world for these rules. Instead the rules allow for the generation of vehicles, weapons, and creatures that allow groups of players to tailor the rules to their perception of Victorian science fiction. As a result, the rules are flexible.<br/><br/>The system now includes The G.A.S.L.I.G.H.T. Compendium which includes most of the expansion books.  It adds some new material and revises some of the old material.

You and your opponents will devaluate the neighborhoods by building slums and destroying property.

You also have the option of just buying the cheap stock and letting someone else rebuild for you.

In the middle portion of the game, players hold onto their stock waiting for opportunities to build key buildings in order to tip the tide of the game in their favor.

In addition to henchmen, a Don may play actions directly from his hand to affect either his own Associates or his opponent&rsquo;s. The Don who bankrupts his opponent&rsquo;s funds is the winner.<br/><br/>DON: CCE is set in a timeless world of crime, containing elements from the Prohibition era through the rise of the modern mob. This fantasy world of the Mafia is simulated to allow players to battle each other in a spirit reflective of classic Gangster movies.<br/><br/>Player Dons use their tradable cards to generate funds, control vices and even whack their opponent&rsquo;s Associates. Game rules are provided to play Sealed Deck, Double Sealed Deck and Constructed decks for use in tournament play, multiple player, and direct head to head competition. The Capo starter deck is available now.  The Capo booster packs, available in Summer 2003, will add a wealth of characters, actions, and possibilities to any game of DON: CCE. The complete card set at present contains over 200 separate cards representing everything from a lowly Babbo Crew to the powerful Made Men and the infamous Penitent Wife&trade;.  The artwork is highly stylized to represent the classic gangster photos of yesteryear with hints of contemporary crime.<br/><br/>Using a revolutionary new game system, Dons are able to control cards in ways that other card games have never imagined. Each player&rsquo;s actions control how many cards he wishes to deploy as well as how many funds he chooses to spend.  In DON: CCE, each Don controls his fate through strategy, not luck.<br/><br/>Future expansions will add even more stylized elements of the genre, including more Law Enforcement, additional Associates, more Family members, and even more Vices for Dons to expand their &ldquo;businesses&rdquo;.<br/><br/>"}, "7075": {"boardgamedesigner": {"1371": {"name": "Matthew J.

Both the game and series depict the early days of World War III in West Germany. Combat is conducted at the company, battalion, and regiment level, with a map scale of 4 km per hex. The map covers the Fulda Gap and includes the major West German cities of Frankfurt and Mainz.<br/><br/>Fifth Corps uses a collection of mechanics, including &quot;Operations Points&quot; and &quot;Friction Points&quot;, variable length game turns, and Zones of Control to simulate modern battlefield conditions. As with most modern warfare games, Fifth Corps includes rules for airpower, airmobile operations, and nuclear/chemical warfare. The game includes three scenarios: an introductory &quot;Rhein-Main Raid&quot;, a more advanced &quot;The Battle for Fulda&quot;, and the campaign game, &quot;Fifth Corps&quot;.<br/><br/><br/>    The Rhein-Main Raid Scenario: Three days after the next war began, the Soviets had not crossed into the Fulda/Frankfurt area. All Warsaw Pact lines of advance had been to the north and south of Fifth Corp's area of operations.Thus, NATO vacated the area to reinforce other hard hit sectors. NATO was surprised then, when two Soviet motorized rifle divisions entered the Fulda Gap supported by attack helicopters, aiming to seize a NATO nuclear site at Giessen, the Wiesbaden Airfield, and the critical Rhein-Main Airbase... A mobile, confusing engagement ensured, independent of the major battles along the rest of the front.<br/><br/><br/><br/>    The Battle for Fulda Scenario: At the outbreak of the next war, few areas were harder hit than the Fulda Gap.

As portions of the race are completed, the map cards from that segment are returned to the draw pile to be reused later in the game.<br/><br/>There are no spaces on the board. The direction and strength of the wind are indicated by lines on the plastic map cards. The distance a ship moves is determined by the wind strength and the ship's bearing in relation to the wind direction.<br/><br/>The ships have clear plastic bases with a numbered wheel mounted in the center. The ships' bases have lines molded into them that are aligned with the lines on the map cards to establish the bearing of a ship. As the ship is moved across the map, the wheel in the center turns, and each number on the wheel indicates one unit of movement.  On a map card with strong wind indicated a ship bearing on a beat, broad reach or downwind moves 4 units or one complete revolution of the wheel.  A beam reach bearing generates 6 units of movement.  On a map card with light wind indicated, the movements are half.<br/><br/>A plastic &quot;windshadow&quot; card is used to determine when an opposing boat is in &quot;disturbed air&quot; - this differs based on whether the boats are on the downwind or windward (upwind) leg.  The sail of a ship will cause the air downwind (behind) of it to move in weak chaotic swirl patterns, the sail effectively blocks the wind from supplying power to any other boat following downwind  within about 1 1/2 boat lengths.  In the game, the &quot;windshadow&quot; card is used to determine if one boat has blocked the wind from powering another boat.  If this is the case, the movement of the blocked boat is reduced.<br/><br/>"}, "7128": {"boardgamedesigner": {"1646": {"name": "Don Alexander"}}, "poll": {}, "name": "AirLand Battle: Corps Operational Command in Europe", "playingtime": "1800", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": {"2026": "Hex-and-Counter"}, "yearpublished": "1988", "usersrated": "10", "boardgamesubdomain": {"4664": "Wargames"}, "maxplayers": "2", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic29202_t.jpg", "average": "5.93", "statistics": {}, "boardgamepublisher": {"962": {"name": "Omega Games (I)"}}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic29202.jpg", "boardgameversion": {"160812": "Omega First Edition"}, "maxplaytime": "1800", "boardgamecategory": {"1069": {"name": "Modern Warfare"}}, "age": "12", "minplaytime": "1800", "description": "AirLand Battle: Corps Operational Command in Europe is an operational level wargame that pits an American corps against a Soviet combined arms army which is reinforced by a second echelon tank army.<br/><br/>Players control additional air, artillery and helicopter assets.<br/><br/>This hex and counter wargame features limited intelligence, doctrinal tactical formations, organic supplies, missile and artillery ammunition restrictions, electronic warfare capabilities, chemical warfare, night combat restrictions, special light infantry capabilities, air interdiction and close air support units, refit of units and more.<br/><br/>"}, "7129": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic436499.jpg", "poll": {}, "boardgamedesigner": {"406": {"name": "Dean Essig"}}, "statistics": {}, "yearpublished": "1990", "maxplayers": "2", "age": "12", "boardgamepublisher": {"219": {"name": "The Gamers"}}, "maxplaytime": "180", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic436499_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "180", "boardgamecategory": {"1069": {"name": "Modern Warfare"}}, "description": "Force Eagle's War, is the first game in the Tactical Combat Series (TCS) Modern Expansion.

The game combines a mechanic usually reserved for smaller games -- a chit pull combat system -- with two gorgeous maps, 900 counters, and a 36-page rulebook that should have &quot;Don't Panic!&quot; inscribed on its cover (the designer was content to place the warning on the first page of rules instead).<br/><br/>As you read the rules, you get the feeling that the designer wants to bring back the best parts of the &quot;good old days&quot; of wargaming -- that newfound excitement and thrill you once had that gradually wore off as you slogged through the complexity of the latest SPI monster. The rulebook is written almost in prose, gently explaining each rule and including historical footnotes when appropriate. Though long, it is well-organized and easily cross-referenced.<br/><br/>The graphics are detailed but subtle, aiding play without distracting the player (in contrast with maps from games like The Gamers' &quot;Thunder at the Crossroads&quot;, where the vibrant color can make you cross-eyed). Hues of gray and green predominate. A fair amount of information is packed on each counter. Player aids are plentiful.<br/><br/>The game itself focuses on post-invasion Normandy, where the Germans are trying to delay and attrite the Allies prior to their inevitable breakout. As much of the victory depends on the Allies' ability to maintain momentum throughout the campaign as it does capturing key victory point hexes -- any signs of trench warfare or, worse, seesaw battling over villages is severely penalized.<br/><br/>In yet another attempt to limit intelligence, the combat system includes a combat effectiveness 'chit pull' system that disguises actual unit combat strength up to the last moment.

That is a delusion. All I can do is provide you with cardboard pieces and a paper map, and instructions on what to do with them, and maybe some words of historical commentary. Can you feel the confusion and chaos, the reports, false and true, that filled British Headquarters when the counterattack hit ? Can you think what it was like to see the ranks of feldgrau figures appear two hundred yards away, peering through the fogged eyepiece of a gas mask into the back sight of a Lee-Enfield rifle ? I cannot tell you what was in the minds and souls of men who fought the battle. I'm no artist. I design wargames&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Through the mud and the blood to the green fields beyond.&quot; This quote, attributed to Brigadier General Hugh Elles, who led the Tank Corps into action at Cambrai, succinctly states the British objective-to penetrate the German trenches and break into their rear areas. The idea of a breakthrough to the green fields beyond had dominated Allied thinking since 1915. Cambrai was to be as close as they were to come before the final breakthrough of 1918.<br/><br/>To the Green Fields Beyond is an operational level simulation of the Battle of Cambrai which lasted from 20 November to 7 December, 1917. There are two players, one commanding the British and the other the German forces. The game consists of three scenarios and a campaign game. The players should start with a scenario- the British Breakthrough is best- before attempting the full 17 turns of the campaign game. Players should note that each game turn in To the Green Fields Beyond requires many decisions, and will probably take between 30 and 75 minutes to play.<br/><br/>To the Green Fields Beyond is uncommon amongst games in that both players get the opportunity to take the offensive. The campaign game provides opportunities for both sides to attack. The British Breakthrough and Battle for Bourlon scenarios have the British attacking, while the German Counterattack scenario obviously has them as defenders, although they can still often mount attacks as well.<br/><br/>Each hex on the mapsheet represents 1250 yards from side to side.

The cards not only represent the Powers, various capabilities, and events that the players use to gain victory, but they also provide the playing board, a map that is divided into 19 Cards, only 8 of which start the game in play. The rest of the Map Cards - and the map - come into play randomly, but at the players' pace.<br/><br/>The remaining cards are for the 27 Powers - countries from the strong but troubled Holy Roman Empire, England and France, through the various Islamic powers, down to such minor, but important, countries such as The Kingdom of Jerusalem, Livonia and Trebizond. Even such mysterious and far away areas as Polovtsy and The Cumans come into play. - and the various &quot;events&quot; the players use to forward their schemes.<br/><br/>Each Player represents an ever-changing conglomerate of these Powers, using his wiles, and the cards, to further his control over areas of Europe to win the game. There are Spies, Assassins, accusations of Heresy, Jihads, even the use of the various Knights of Christ.<br/><br/>And then there are the Popes. Each player, randomly, can become Pope (they're named and historical). As Pope he can arrange alliances, excommunicate players, and call for Crusades (a great way to make money).<br/><br/>But hovering like a very, very black cloud over all of this are The Mongols. No player knows exactly when they start to arrive, although the card play does give them hints &hellip; and some time to prepare, if they choose to heed the warnings. But when they do arrive, all Tartar Hell breaks loose, as The Mongols, also represented by cards, literally eat the map, east to west, conquering Powers, chewing them up and making them disappear from European view.<br/><br/>The winner is the player who survives the onslaughts of religion and the Mongols to control the largest part of 13th century Europe.<br/><br/>Medieval is for 3 to 5 players and takes around 2 hours to play, once you've learned the system.

From the publisher's web page:<br/><br/>Vanished Planet is a cooperative board game. That means that all players work together to play the game, and either win as a group or lose as a group. It can be played with as many as six players or as few as one.<br/><br/>Playing the game requires complex strategies involving ship movement, resource management, and technology building, all while trying to delay the creature's progress towards destroying the players' home worlds.<br/><br/>The difficulty level is scalable, making it enjoyable for everyone from the beginner to the expert. Vanished Planet can be made easy enough for parents to play with their children or difficult enough to challenge the most masochistic hardcore gamers.<br/><br/>Vanished Planet takes place in a richly detailed game world.<br/><br/>The past one hundred years had been marked by an unprecedented peace. Humans from the Earth, newcomers to the Galactic Sextant, surprised the Elder Races with their grasp of foreign technologies and their dedication to freedom and peace. With Earth's help, a massive communications and trade network was established. Treaties were negotiated. Disputes were settled and wars became less frequent. The Peoples of the Sextant welcomed the children of Earth and looked toward a brighter future.<br/><br/>Then, without warning, Earth vanished.<br/><br/>In its place appeared a writhing mass of darkness. It was impenetrable. It was unassailable. It was without reason. It drank energy like water and consumed all matter it touched. After devouring Earth's solar system, the Creature began stretching massive tentacles across space with terrifying speed, reaching straight toward the homeworlds of the Six Peoples.<br/><br/>With Earth gone, the communications network all but broke down. Each of the Peoples accused the others of betraying Earth and setting loose the Creature, for each had lost many of their top men and women with the planet when it disappeared. And with them vanished all hope of stopping the dark Creature. In their despair, colonies revolted, workers ran from their jobs and soldiers abandoned their posts in an attempt to flee the approaching darkness.<br/><br/>It was days before any news came to them. Even the hub satellites that formed the backbone of the network spun silently in empty space. News came in the unexpected form of a single ship; one of the few to survive the cataclysm and return to tell what they had seen. Unlike the other ships, they brought not rumor, but six of those thought lost in the vanishing and their tale was devoid of the speculations the other ships had brought.<br/><br/>The ship, Hope, raced from home world to home world bringing what truth they knew of Earth's disappearance to their peoples, narrowly avoiding the wars that were preparing to burst forth over the galaxy even as the Creature began groping insatiable tentacles toward them over the vastness of space. <br/> Then the messages came. As one, the hub satellites flickered into life; suddenly and strangely, for the words were not sent by the peoples to one another, but to all six peoples from the the vanished planet Earth!<br/><br/>Bizarre blueprints for wondrous new technologies were transmitted and strange instructions were given, both for the banishment of the Creature and the formation of a new system for Earth to use when it returned. Time was of the essence.

In a sense, it was something more akin to a social experiment and performance art in game form. On the bottom side of its box, the game description reads: &ldquo;Experience the ghetto. Live on Welfare. Try to buy a place in a white suburb. Your challenge: To keep the land-hungry majority type from winning the game cheaply and quickly.... If Black players turn the tide against white advantages, a kind of irrepressible excitement takes over the board.&rdquo;<br/><br/>Players were divided into Whites and Blacks and had to make economic progress while competing with each other. Based on &quot;Monopoly&quot;, the idea was to demonstrate how the odds were stacked against black people in society by having different rules for each race in the game. The difference between this and all the other roll-and-move go-around-the board-buying-property games is that before the game, each player assumes the role of either a Black or White person.<br/><br/>Whites start out as the majority with $1,000,000.00 to spend and are able to buy property anywhere. Blacks start out as the minority with only $10,000.00 to spend; are unable to buy certain properties; have to draw from a separate Chance deck; are banned from purchasing property in the 'Surburban Zone'; and collect less money for completing a lap around the gameboard. Blacks are limited to certain areas of the board until they had accumulated at least $100,000.00. Players are encouraged to change the rules when anyone lands on the People's Park space.<br/><br/>Needless to say, it turned out to be one of the most controversial board games of all time and even merited an article in Time magazine: &quot;The game, produced by Psychology Today Games (an off shoot of the magazine) now on sale ($5.95) at major department stores, was developed at the University of California at Davis by Psychology Department Chairman Robert Sommer. It was conceived as a painless way for middle-class whites to experience &mdash; and understand &mdash; the frustrations of blacks. In Sommer&rsquo;s version, however, the black player could not win; as a simulation of frustration, the game was too successful. Then David Popoff, a Psychology Today editor, redesigned the game, taking suggestions from militant black members of 'US' in San Diego. The new rules give black players an opportunity to use &mdash; and even to beat &mdash; the System.&quot;<br/><br/>Although turning &quot;Monopoly&quot; into an attempt to draw people&rsquo;s attention to social issues seems a little bit of a long shot, it&rsquo;s worth noting that the original version of 'Monopoly' itself, called &lsquo;The Landlord&rsquo;s Game&lsquo;, was designed to demonstrate how the current economic system led to inequality and bankruptcy.<br/><br/>Psychology Today&rsquo;s board game division seems to have been short-lived but other titles included 'The Cities Game' involving &lsquo;urban tension, corruption and the undercurrents of city politics'; and 'Woman and Man' where &lsquo;Each woman must accumulate enough Status Quo points (100) to prove her equality to Men. Each man must collect enough Status Quo points (100) to prove once and for all a Woman&rsquo;s place is beneath his.&rsquo;<br/><br/>"}, "7246": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic30074.jpg", "poll": {}, "boardgamedesigner": {"3": {"name": "(Uncredited)"}}, "statistics": {}, "yearpublished": "1984", "maxplayers": "4", "boardgameartist": {"3": "(Uncredited)"}, "boardgamepublisher": {"117": {"name": "International Games"}}, "maxplaytime": "20", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic30074_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "20", "boardgamecategory": {"1002": {"name": "Card Game"}}, "description": "From the makers of Uno<br/><br/>Object of Game: To avoid the Gremlins!

All other players read out the SAME statistic. Whoever has the best or highest value wins and places all the top cards including their own to the bottom of their pile. They then choose the statistic for the next round.<br/><br/>During a round, if 2 or more cards &lsquo;tie&rsquo; or no data is available for that particular statistic then all the cards are placed to one side and the same player chooses again from their next card.

There are 5 white dice (par 4s), 2 red dice (par 3's) and 2 blue dice (par 5s). Each dice has the ability to shoot above par, par, or below par. There are as many formats as there are golf side games, but players typically play in one of two formats:<br/><br/>Traditional Format:<br/><br/>All nine dice are rolled--the player chooses at least 1 die, but can use more than one to count toward his/her 9-hole total. The remaining dice are picked up and rolled again. Players have the option of having multiple dice count toward their score, or choose as few as one and try to &quot;GO LO&quot; (shoot a low score--golf parlance).<br/><br/>Golf Course Format:<br/><br/>In this format, the players must follow along to the scorecard of their favorite course, or any course. If the first 9 holes (&quot;Front 9&quot;) at Pebble Beach are laid out in this order--4-4-3-4-5-3-4-4-5=36, then when the player begins by rolling all 9 dice, he/she must play the course &quot;in order&quot; by choosing two par 4's before he/she may then chose a par 3. Having to go in the order of holes on a golf course creates a different strategy and usually produces higher scores than the Traditional format.<br/><br/>In all formats, tournament play is the most exciting--where players are playing against each other, and their scores are affecting other players' choices and strategies.<br/><br/>A game primarily for non-gamers and sports nuts, which nevertheless is a very strategic, &quot;push-your-luck&quot; dice game. It is not just a matter of rolling dice and counting up your score; the requirement of keeping one or more dice each time you roll presents many interesting choices, depending on what your opponent has done, and what you already have kept for scoring.<br/><br/>The game is sold online at <a target='_blank' href='http://www.igolo.com' rel='nofollow'>www.igolo.com</a> and in major golf shops and golf stores.

It may not give you the smell of freshly plowed ground or the self-satisfaction of a hard day&rsquo;s work, but it will wake you up to the fact that farming is much more than just plowing and planting.  You&rsquo;ll experience the responsibility of farm ownership and development, and with luck, reap the benefits of successful farm management.<br/><br/>RICH FARMER, POOR FARMER was invented by a 28-year old Alabama farmer, Donald McDonald, as a means of educating the public to the realities of farming.<br/><br/>The game was first introduced in October, 1978, at the Sunbelt Agricultural Exposition.  With the news coverage of tractorcades and the farmers dilemma over the past year, the game&rsquo;s popularity has steadily gained momentum.  It continues to receive widespread exposure in farm magazines, newspapers and television.  As a result, the game has been mailed all over the United States.<br/><br/>The object of the game is to survive financially &ndash; just as in real life.  In the game, an actual farmer has no advantage over a city slicker who thinks a &ldquo;bush hog&rdquo; is a type of pig.  Players can end up a Rich Farmer or a Poor Farmer, depending on how well they manage their money.<br/><br/>An entertaining and educational game about farming for 2 to 6 players.<br/><br/>"}, "7303": {"boardgamedesigner": {"3": {"name": "(Uncredited)"}}, "poll": {}, "name": "What shall I be?

The &amp;quot;movement of the spheres&amp;quot; would begin as the older cacike conceded the honor of moving the first sphere to the younger, less experienced one; thereafter the two appointed warriors would alternate turns moving the spheres as the cacikes instructed into pits (36 in total) dug out of the hard surface of the batey following strict rules of placement.<br/><br/>"}, "7374": {"boardgamedesigner": {"2557": {"name": "Jordan Tuzsuzov"}}, "poll": {}, "name": "Veptheca", "playingtime": "10", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": {"2039": "Line Drawing"}, "yearpublished": "2003", "usersrated": "0", "boardgamesubdomain": {"4666": "Abstract Games"}, "maxplayers": "2", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic82473_t.jpg", "average": "0", "statistics": {}, "boardgamepublisher": {"4": {"name": "(Self-Published)"}}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic82473.jpg", "maxplaytime": "10", "boardgamecategory": {"1009": {"name": "Abstract Strategy"}}, "age": "0", "minplaytime": "10", "description": "Veptheca is an abstract strategy game for two or more players, which is played with pen and paper.<br/>The board of Veptheca is a arbitrary quad-board with dots.

The games in this series features a common four (4) page series rulebook and generally a four (4) page game specific rulebook, of which one page is the cover. The games of this series feature simple rules that are a quick study and low counter density. Most games feature step reduction and have substitute counters included in the counter mix.<br/><br/>CAEN 1944 features an 11x17 map and 100 counters. The units are divisions with some brigade/regiments. Several units have step reduction.<br/><br/>From the rules introduction:<br/>After the Allied landings in Normandy in 1944, the main concern of Eisenhower was to expand the bridgehead and bring in supplies and new units. Ike thought Montgomery should have made more rapid progress in his attacks on Caen. One thing slowing down the British and Canadians was the preponderant numbers of SS and regular Panzer divisions facing the British along the Caen position.<br/><br/>Turning slow progress into a partial tactical victory, Montgomery held down this large German armoured strength while the Americans broke out on the other flank and cut off a large number of German troops in what became known as the &lsquo;Falaise Pocket.&rsquo; In this game the Allied objective is to accomplish what Montgomery did only much sooner. The Axis objective is to stop the Allies in their tracks and destroy Montgomery's army group.<br/><br/>From the design notes:<br/>Caen is truly siege warfare with Panzer and armoured divisions leading the siege. The massive number of German Panzer and SS divisions employed at Caen were able to stop Monty cold for weeks.<br/><br/>This game uses a very complex sequence of play to bring in all the elements of the campaign.<br/><br/>In general, the SS was usually better equipped and stronger than a comparable Whermacht(sic) unit. Some SS units in this game are weaker than one would expect, this was due to the immense difficulty in reaching the front intact and because of Allied air harassment or they were being rebuilt when thrown into the campaign.<br/><br/>Caen helped the Allies tie the Germans down, but it would have been an even bigger victory for them if Monty had reached Falaise sooner. Now it's your turn to try or try to stop him. <br/><br/>By today&rsquo;s games standards the complex sequence of play referred to in the design notes is a very relaxing stroll in the park.<br/><br/>Other games in the PBSS include: Caen 1944, Crimea 1941, Sidi Rezegh 1941, Cassino 1944, Ancient Conquest, Atlantis 12,500 B.C., Crete 1941, Edgehill 1642, and Tunisia 1943.<br/><br/>"}, "7416": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic45553.jpg", "boardgameimplementation": {"159577": "Battle of the Bands: World Tour Edition"}, "poll": {}, "boardgamedesigner": {"403": {"name": "Dan Smith"}}, "statistics": {}, "yearpublished": "2002", "maxplayers": "6", "boardgameartist": {"403": "Dan Smith"}, "boardgamepublisher": {"884": {"name": "Third World Games"}}, "maxplaytime": "30", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic45553_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "30", "boardgamecategory": {"1002": {"name": "Card Game"}}, "description": "Backstage Pass adds 60 cards to Battle of the Bands.

But, obviously, your previous allies will use the breathing space to re-arm, ally themselves with the enemy and invade us!  As the President, it is your sacred duty to beat the other countries to the punch.  The time for decisive action is now!<br/><br/>Each player has his own little country map, divided into conceptual areas: political, military, communications, production and population.  Each player also has a production card, 60 people tokens, 6 Action cards, 3 ships, 2 carriers and 1 airplane.  The players share 30 missile markers (power 5, 15 or 30) and 15 Goal cards.<br/><br/>The Goal cards represent your secret victory conditions (see below).  People will eventually spread not only over your own areas but the other players' --giving you a say in each player's destiny as will be seen below.<br/><br/>Play is in rounds, with each round beginning with a Player Order and Political phase, and then a varying number of player turns.<br/><br/>Player Order phase: The order of play is determined by each player's Communications area.  Each player counts his people in that area, and each other player with people in that area either adds, subtracts or stays neutral (his choice).  Largest score goes first during the round and so on.<br/><br/>Political phase: Place up to four of your six Action cards (keeping at least one), face down, in front of the other players, in any ratio.  This phase is resolved in sequence by all players.  Next come the individual player turns.<br/><br/>Production phase: Each player's production card is progressively filled up with people markers; the level reached indicates what can be produced.  Producing anything, even something way below the current &quot;fill line&quot;, empties the card (the people go back to the player's Production area).<br/><br/>Embarkation phase: People of your colour (up to 10) may be embarked on one of your ships.  Missiles (up to 30 total power) of a controlled colour may be embarked on a carrier or airplane of a controlled colour which happens to be off the missile's shores.<br/><br/>Action phase: The player must play one of his Action cards (the ones he kept earlier plus those played on him).  Political clout (people in your Political area) can be used to instead lay a card aside for a later round.<br/><br/>These player turns continue until all players pass.  The players then recover their Action cards from the discard pile.  Cards laid aside during the round are put back in the player's hand --so you may end up with a smaller or larger hand than usual.  A player without any people in his Population area, or with less than 5 total people markers on his country (diasporas don't count!) is eliminated.<br/><br/>Goal cards indicate either a player to eliminate (you win even if another player is responsible for your target's elimination) or two players to dominate politically or demographically.<br/><br/>The Action cards are:<br/><br/>Transfer - Transfer up to 5 people of your colour from one area to another, within your country.<br/><br/>Disembark - Up to 5 embarked people on one of your ships off another country's shores disembarks into any area.<br/><br/>Growth - For each 5 people of one colour in your Population area, add two more.  Enemies also grow if present.<br/><br/>Production - Move up to 5 people from your Production area into the production display.  They may be of another colour if their owner agrees.<br/><br/>Move - You can move one ship of your colour, or one carrier or airplane of a colour you control by one country.  Ships and carriers move clockwise or counter-clockwise, airplanes move anywhere.<br/><br/>Shoot - Fire a missile on board a carrier or airplane of a colour you control onto an area of the country where it currently is.  The missile kills as many people as its power.  The more powerful missiles can spill their effect over into other areas of the target country.  Casualties must be fairly spread between the colours present in the area (if it matters).<br/><br/>"}, "7490": {"boardgamedesigner": {"1121": {"name": "Jim Deacove"}}, "poll": {}, "name": "Walk in the Woods", "playingtime": "20", "minplayers": "1", "boardgamemechanic": {"2023": "Co-operative Play"}, "yearpublished": "1999", "usersrated": "2", "boardgamesubdomain": {"4665": "Children's Games"}, "maxplayers": "8", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic52470_t.jpg", "average": "5", "statistics": {}, "boardgamepublisher": {"603": {"name": "Family Pastimes"}}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic52470.jpg", "boardgameversion": {"176789": "First edition"}, "maxplaytime": "20", "boardgamecategory": {"1041": {"name": "Children's Game"}}, "age": "5", "minplaytime": "20", "description": "From the box:<br/><br/>Ah, a Walk in the Woods... to observe beautiful things such as Wild Flowers &amp; Butterflies... to help each other gather Goodies such as Apples, Berries, Nuts &amp; Herbs... to keep an eye out for nasty stuff such as Poison Ivy, Stinging Nettle, Biting Bugs, even Hot Sun... to share our Remedies to solve Problems we meet... and to plan together where to look next for Goodies &amp; Remedies.
