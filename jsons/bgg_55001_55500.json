This game may be used for fun and entertainment or for teaching morality and the consequences of actions.<br/><br/>The books revolve around the journey of a Traveler on the River of Light, who is trying to reach Fountainhead, a glorious and wonderful place, which one must strive for by working one's way upstream. The Traveler meets numerous obstacles along the way, making this journey a treacherous one.<br/><br/>The journey begins, for each Traveler, with his/her appearance on the River. Travelers do not remember anything before this point. All they know they must learn from the two River Guides with whom they share a boat. Soon, they are given oars to help in the rowing of their boat, as their River Guides try to teach them how to navigate the River.<br/><br/>Eventually, Travelers are issued their own boats, though these boats come in all styles and sizes. At first, they are still connected to the boat of their River Guides, but eventually the rope is cut and they are left to make their own way on the River. The most important possession any Traveler has is his/her boat. Keeping the boat in good condition is the job of the individual. Along the way, there are Way Stations, places where the boat can be repaired, but these are rare. In order to become a successful Traveler, one must learn the proper maintenance and piloting of one's craft.<br/><br/>The standard scope of a campaign in The River of Light RPG spans the journey of Travelers, beginning with their appearance on the River. Because Fountainhead is a flexible destination, appearing on a River that has many different courses, the scope of this game does not include the destination.<br/><br/>"}, "55355": {"rpgartist": ["(Uncredited)"], "rpgitemversion": ["PDF Version"], "poll": [], "name": "Amazing Monkey Adventures", "rpgdesigner": ["Jared A.

This can be done as a Solo player or with any number of players controlling and arguing over the party members.  (I have run one of my D&amp;D groups through it with 8 people as the party)<br/>Your Adventuring Party is made up of 5 Unique and Specific Classes that must be represented as you begin the game.  Each class has a Hero that Begins at Level 1 and can advance up to Level 5 during game play.  Most 1st level Heroes need 3xp to advance to level two. 7xp more to advance to level three, 10-15 more to level four, and 18-24 to level five. This depends on the class and individual Hero.<br/>Here is a list of the 19 Heroes that we have at this time and what they are at each level.<br/>Protection Class:<br/>Griff - Journeyman - Fighter - Warrior - Barbarian - Berserker<br/>Sonya - Wanderer - Explorer - Questing - Paladin - Angel<br/>Olli - Son of Hamfast - Pikeman - Squire - Knight - Crusader<br/>Solarion - Footman - Swordsman - Lieutentant - Captain - General<br/>Death Class:<br/>Selene - Outlaw - Bandit - Thief - Rogue - Shadow<br/>Gabriel - Urchin - of the Streets - Minstrel - Bard - Muse<br/>Grimm - Outlaw - Bandit - Enforcer - Assassin - Reaper<br/>Sabban - Rebel - Renegade - Deciever - Deserter - Betrayer<br/>Nature Class:<br/>Richard - Farmer - Woodsman - Guide - Scout - Ranger<br/>Isseili - the Fey - Forester - Naturalist - Druid - Warden<br/>Venr - Awakened - Scavenger - Hungering - Feasting - Vampire<br/>Magic Class:<br/>Marteel - Novice - Adept - Wizard - Mage - Archmage<br/>Callius - Novice - Adept - Cultist - Warlock - Demon<br/>Zaphian - Underling - Adept - Sorcerer - Necromancer - Lich<br/>Rymar - Stonehead - Preserved - Protected - Encased - Fortified<br/>Life Class;<br/>Dana - Follower - Acolyte - Healer - Priestess - High Priestess<br/>Jesse - Follower - Acolyte - Brother - Preacher - Martyr<br/>Sarah - Searching - Enlightened - Forgiving - Redeemed - Guardian Spirit<br/>Mary - Acolyte - Cleric - Devoted - Blessed - Saint<br/><br/>The Adventure consists of a 60 card Dungeon, which has one Quest Objective, Terrain, Creatures, Equipment, Effects, Fast Effects, Events, and other Items.  There are always two Unigue Tier Creature Cards that can be interchanged after completion of each Tier to make the adventure last longer and become more difficult.  The eight Adventures that we have complete are listed below with the amount of games played, completion rate, and Quest Objective.<br/>Goblin Kingdom -    71/120     60%    Goblin King<br/>Dead Marshes -      58/90       63%    Lord of the Undead<br/>Demonic Rift -          35/63       54%    Balor              <br/>Ruby Mountain -      31/64       49%    Ancient Red Dragon<br/>Forsaken City -        25/51       50%    King of the Streets<br/>Nature's Abundance 23/50      46%    Ancient Treant<br/>Dangerous Seas -    21/47       38%    Captain Davy Jones<br/>Tomb Kingdom -      17/50       34%    Tomb King<br/>We are planning on a total of 10 adventures to become available in the future.<br/>        <br/>Game-play:<br/>In Quest: A New Age there are Abilities, Upgrades, and four stat Values -- Accuracy, Armor, Life, and Damage. <br/>Abilities differ for each Hero and Creature according to their assigned value in the game, (e.g. a Goblin Recruit has no abilities and is worth 1 point value, while a Goblin Captain has a value of 3 and grants abilities to other Goblins).<br/>5 levels of Upgrade are available to each Hero and are earned in the Dungeon as the party delves deeper into the adventure. As you gain XP from Terrain, Trap, and Creature cards, you can spend the XP to make your Heroes stronger. <br/>Accuracy is the Hero or Creatures base accuracy which you then combine with a roll of a D20 to attempt to hit.<br/>Armor is the Hero or Creatures base defense against attacks.<br/>Life is the Hero or Creatures base damage that they can take before dying.<br/>Damage is the Hero or Creatres base damage they can inflict against another.<br/> Phases of the Game:<br/>1)  Quest Deck - Turn over the appropiate amount of cards.  Fast Effects happen at this time and can change how many cards are turned over.<br/>2)  Effects - Any Effects that are turned over happen at this time.<br/>3)  Hero1 - All Heroes have one action per turn, which can be used to either Attack, Heal, Pick Up and item or attempt to Disarm a trap.  The Hero may also Hold their action for Hero2 phase.<br/>4)  Dungeon - Any surviving Creatures may perform one action at this time.<br/>5)  Hero2 - The Heroes that held their action can now act.<br/>6)  Events - Events such as traps that have not been disarmed and other Events take place at this time.<br/>7)  End of Turn - End of Turn abilities such as Regenerate and Aura's take place at this time.<br/>8)  Upgrade - XP that has been collected can now be used to upgrade your Heroes.  When a Hero is upgraded they gain full health.  Once XP has been spent on a Hero, it cannot be used again.<br/>Start the Phases over at this time.<br/> The game begins by shuffling your Quest Deck and turning over three cards.  As the game progresses and your Heroes are upgraded, you start to turn over more cards to make the Adventure more difficult.  The Breakdown is as follows:<br/>Game Begins - 3 Cards per turn<br/>After Two Hero Upgrades - 4 Cards per turn<br/>After Five Hero Upgrades - 5 Cards per turn<br/>After Eight Hero Upgrades - 6 Cards per turn<br/>After Ten Hero Upgrades - 7 Cards per turn<br/>After Twelve Hero Upgrades - 8 cards per turn<br/> Rules Questions:<br/>1)  When Attacking you take the Accuracy and add a D20 roll. That roll must equal or beat the targets Armor.  You do not have to roll when Healing or using an Ability unless it is used as an attack.<br/>2)  Melee characters cannot target Ranged characters unless all other Melee opponents are defeated.<br/>3)  Rolls of a 1 are considered an Epic Fail and always miss.  Rolls of 20 are considered a Critical Strike and always hit, in addition a Critical causes Double damage to the target.<br/>4)  All XP this is collected goes into a community pool which can be used at the direction of the Party's controller or controller's.<br/>5)  As an overall rule: The Cant's outweigh the Can's<br/><br/>We did a short Demo on youtube which is quite boring but you are free to take a look at the mechanics of the game. :)<br/><a target='_blank' href='http://www.youtube.com/user/HiddenKeep#play/all/uploads-all/1/hDXivVltVB4' rel='nofollow'>http://www.youtube.com/user/HiddenKeep#play/all/uploads-all/...</a><br/><br/>"}, "55389": {"rpgartist": ["Nicole Cardiff", "Kim Feigenbaum", "Craig Largent"], "rpgitemversion": ["PDF Version"], "statistics": [], "name": "The Beast Within (Savage Worlds Version)", "rpgdesigner": ["Mike DeSanto"], "rpgproducer": ["Cray Crouse", "Preston P.

Howard.<br/>        The fundamental framework for adventuring in Tunnels &amp; Trolls is the concept of an underground tunnel complex wherein dangerous traps and deadly monsters guard undreamed-of treasures, where magic and high sorcery meet sword and shield, in alliance or as violent opponents.

This boxed set includes a 192-page book filled with information on these topics:<br/><br/>- History: The Empires of the Shining Sea hold tales and legends passed down by word of mouth across the years. The myriad mysteries and dramas of more than 300 rulers across four empires--including the infamous Shoon Imperium--reveal themselves in the history and timeline spanning more than 8,000 years.<br/><br/>- Calimshan: The long-fallen empire of Calimshan rises yet again, as a new ruler and new power groups take control of the former land of the genies. Updated and expanded by more than 100 pages since its first appearance in FR3, Empires of the Sands, Calimshan shows itself to be a land bent on returning to its former greatness--at any and all costs!<br/><br/>- The Land of the Lions: This rugged land sandwiched between the Deepwash and the Lake of Steam seems empty, but many surprises lurk among its plains and woods--nomads and raiders astride giant lynxes, elder orbs, ruined cities, lost cultures, and more!<br/><br/>- The Lake of Steam: This steaming bay of the Shining Sea unveils its secrets, proving that it holds more than easy trade routes to the Inner Sea. Scarlet pearls the size of a human fist or the smoking majesty of the volcanic Arnrock tempt those who dare test its deceptively calm waters.<br/><br/>Also inside are two full-color poster maps showing Calimshan and the Lake of Steam region at 30-mile-per-inch scale.<br/><br/>Everything you need to adventure in the conspiracy-laden Empires of the Shining Sea is here!<br/><br/>"}, "55452": {"rpgartist": ["Preston P.

The aristocracy press down from above squeezing profit and privilege out of the lower classes like fine wine from a grape. The streets are thronged with beggars and outcasts. Those who can work do so in appalling conditions in factories and mines, their sweat lining the pockets of the rich. Those who cannot eke out whatever life they can in the wilderness, foraging for scraps amongst the caverns of a subterranean world packed full of dangerous creatures whose very existence is against nature. But there is a storm coming, a revolution that could shake the pillars of society and send the privileged tumbling from their lofty perch, taking the rest of civilisation with them.<br/><br/>Maybe you had a home once, long ago, but you barely remember it now. How you got here is a mystery of unreasonable sciences from the haziest theories of quantum mechanics. The laws of physics don&rsquo;t apply here as they should. Electricity is little more than a dream and a phantom. Gravity is optional. Space can be distended with a little effort. Steam power is far more effective than should ever be possible. Even time itself can be defied if you know the way of it. Worst of all, there is no escape from this asylum of a place.

With the threat of outright war on the horizon, an as-yet young and untried duke seeks outside assistance to find the source of these troubles.<br/><br/>Digging into this mystery, however, could prove dangerous. Moreso than any might suspect. The darkness that dwells at the heart of this plot has done a far graver harm than the duke realizes, and uncovering the truth could prove costly.<br/><br/>Will your characters be able to find the source of that darkness? Or will they be consumed in their attempt to seek out these missing persons? Duke Regan has asked for your aid...will you answer his call and find what was lost?<br/><br/>The second module in the Dark Spiral Quintet, Missing Persons, is an adventure for characters levels 5-6 in the Arcraetia setting.<br/><br/>If you've never purchased a WorldWorks adventure before, you should know what sets it apart from a typical adventure. With the contents of this adventure, and the WorldWorks sets &quot;DungeonWorks: Gothic Realms&quot;, and a little bit from out of &quot;DungeonWorks Classic&quot;, &quot;Chunky Dungeons&quot; or &quot;MiniChunk&quot;, you can create the entire adventure setting as a richly-detailed, immersive 3D environment! Don't just draw flat lines on a board, or even set down colorful flat maps...the Sewers of Kiermont come to life, and your players can see every wretched sewage-filled tunnel! The newly designed Modular Sewer System expands on Gothing Realms, and makes it possible to explore an immense area without having to build the whole thing ahead of time. Move pre-made tiles about and reconnect them in different ways to represent the PC's entire journey through the underside of Kiermont.<br/>For those of you familiar with DungeonWorks: Gothic Realms already, Missing Persons is a must-have for the models alone. It expands on the original with a bundle of new pieces. Take a look at the models included with Missing Persons.<br/><br/>MORE SEWERS:<br/><br/><br/>    Crevasse Waterfall Tile<br/>    Sewer End pieces to make the connections work (in all four Gothic Realms colors)<br/>    Sewer T-Intersections (in all four Gothic Realms colors)<br/>    Sewer X-Intersections (in all four Gothic Realms colors)<br/>    Shattered Bridges (in all four Gothic Realms colors)<br/>    Elevated pool sides, to make your sewer pools fully 3D (in all four Gothic Realms colors)<br/>    A &quot;river gate&quot; entrance to the sewers, connecting to the outside<br/>    A &quot;river wall&quot; to extend that entrance to either side<br/>    An elevated 4x4 platform<br/>    Arches to go over the sewer tunnels<br/><br/><br/>&quot;pockets&quot; to insert the arch ends into for a more finished look<br/><br/>    An overhead sewer grate, leading down from above<br/>    A &quot;ruined section&quot; of sewer for a crumbled-down area, including an &quot;island of rubble&quot;<br/>    Transition steps to go from higher areas to lower<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>More Gothic Dungeons:<br/><br/><br/>    A full torture chamber, complete with &quot;viewing platform&quot;<br/>    Barred cell doors<br/>    A new &quot;chain curtain&quot; trap<br/>    Stairs up (narrow and wide)<br/>    Extra wall &quot;covers&quot; for a chamber of horrors<br/>    And more...the final encounter room must be seen to be believed<br/><br/><br/>Concerned that you might not have the miniatures to run this adventure, and that you might be substituting an orc for an elf (or vice-versa)? Fear not! Missing Persons also includes a full set of &quot;Standees&quot;. Print every single creature, or even the pre-generated player characters out as flat standup paper models. Sure, you can use your own minis if you have them...but this way you have the option. Need more? Print more! 43 unique standees, with nearly 80 different models in total from printing each page once.<br/><br/>And what's more, Missing Persons is released with our new Standee system. Print them out and fold them into simple T-Fold models for quick, easy construction, or follow the second set of lines and produce swappable models with different bases.<br/><br/>And let's not forget the pre-generated characters? Eight of them...each in a convenient single-page format, complete with picture and background. Enough to accommodate even a big gaming group, or give some variety and choice to a smaller one. If you don't care for, or don't use pre-generated characters, then you've a pack of NPCs ready to roll at a moment's notice. If you do use them, though, then you'll be ready to start your players heading through the adventure without wasting half a night rolling characters. Just pass 'em out, give 'em a few minutes to study them over, and you're ready to play!<br/><br/>These characters are the ones that came through the events of Something Below...higher level, a little more powerful, and hopefully a little wiser. Their story continues, and will continue onwards from here as well.<br/><br/>Come discover the WorldWorks difference in adventure modules today. Your campaigns will never be the same. And if you like what you see, just wait! Missing Persons is the second of a five-part adventure series, the Dark Spiral Quintet. If you missed Something Below, definately check it out as well, for it is there that this journey began, and come back again soon, for the story continues forward as well, and the next Dark Spiral adventure is soon to come.<br/><br/>"}, "55024": {"rpgartist": ["Matthew Tito Cuenca", "Alberto J.

But under the surface? A seething cauldron of political intrigue, kidnapping, drug running and human sacrifice; an underworld dominated by greed and corruption at all levels.<br/><br/>The king is dying and has no heir. As the borders of the kingdom strain under the threat of war from neighbouring Worheim and Crenn, the Dukes and Barons of the kingdom vie for position in the struggle for succession that will follow the king&rsquo;s death. A marriage designed to cement a bloc of two powerful duchies is planned, but just days before the wedding, the erstwhile bride is kidnapped. The kingdom is on the brink of anarchy! Meanwhile, out on the mean streets, a dark plot based on the exploitation of thousands is unfolding&hellip;<br/><br/>Having recently returned to Himmelveil to enjoy the spoils of your latest adventures, you receive a request from a very powerful man in a desperate situation: &ldquo;Find my daughter!&rdquo; says the Duke, &ldquo;and you will be richly rewarded.

Under the Veil also features floorplans that take the classic WorldWorks model set Pubs and Inns to a new level, and includes a handful of new bits and pieces designed to fit into the Pubs and Inns set. Gothic Realms is also recommended (what can we say, the adventure is just that big).<br/><br/>No figures? No problem! Under the Veil comes with a complete set of standees for every nasty NPC and vicious monster your characters are likely to encounter, from the squirming swarm of giant centipedes to the Valdsparian vampire lord, Count Khachzcyk.

You never use both halves of the card at once &mdash; either one or the other.<br/><br/>A turn consists of first playing a card to cover the shot your opponent played, then playing another card to dictate which of the six zones you'll hit the ball to. Finally, you play a preparation card, indicating which zones you're prepared to cover. The preparation card can be used to cover a shot if the appropriate zone is highlighted; otherwise you must cover the shot with a card from your hand, in which case the preparation card becomes the attack. Thus, by playing cards that your opponent cannot cover with her preparation card, you maintain control of the match because you'll see from where the next attack will come and will be able to prepare for that. Of course if a player cannot cover a shot at all, then the point is lost.<br/><br/>Combinations of cards can create special shots, which if not covered by the corresponding combination of cards, leave a player off balance, with her drawing only one card at the end of the turn instead of the usual two. This will leave her with fewer options and make it less likely that she'll cover your shots.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": ["Chinese Edition", "English/Korean first edition"], "age": "8", "name": "Grand Slam", "playingtime": "30", "boardgamemechanic": ["Card Drafting", "Hand Management", "Simulation"], "average": "6.35301", "usersrated": "83", "boardgamefamily": ["Sports: Tennis"]}, "55032": {"rpgartist": ["Jode Carrasco"], "statistics": [], "name": "Grampa Barmo's Discount Game Magazine (Issue 4 - Spring 2002)", "rpgdesigner": ["Christopher Clark (II)", "Demian Katz", "Beniamino Sidoti"], "rpgproducer": ["Demian Katz"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic546212.jpg", "usersrated": "0", "average": "0", "rpgissue": ["Grampa Barmo's Discount Game Magazine"], "rpg": ["Bad Movie Night", "Grampa Barmo's Discount Game Magazine", "Groucho Marx contro Frankenstein, la Mummia e il Vampiro sulla nave pirata in mezzo alla tempesta", "Inner City", "Shriek"], "rpgpublisher": ["On-a-Stick Publications"], "rpgissueversion": ["First Printing"], "poll": [], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic546212_t.jpg", "description": "From the table of contents:<br/><br/>Editorial: Game Over (by Demian Katz)<br/>A fond farewell to a mostly-pleasant and distinguished old gentleman.<br/><br/>Feature: Bad Movie Night (by Demian Katz)<br/>It's the unconventional role-playing game of bad movie watching!<br/><br/>Grampa Barmo's Discount News<br/>Some highly abbreviated (but still interesting) goings-on.<br/><br/>Feature: Focus on Inner City Games<br/>Here begins a look at one of the longest-lived cheap game companies out there.<br/><br/>Feature: History of a Small Press Outfit<br/>A brief history of Inner City Games, courtesy of co-founder Christopher Clark.<br/><br/>Board Game Review: Space War (by Demian Katz)<br/>Road rage in a plastic zip-lock baggie, complete with plastic pawns!<br/><br/>Board Game Review: When Good Villagers Go Bad (by Demian Katz)<br/>Beware the fury and power of the common people.<br/><br/>Silly Game Review: My First Larp (by Demian Katz)<br/>The introduction to live-action role-playing that (fortunately) you never had.<br/><br/>Board Game Review: The Anyville Horror (by Christopher Clark)<br/>Monster + family + common household implements = fun.<br/><br/>Board Game Review: Rally (by Demian Katz)<br/>A look at Mythrole's simple, strategic, downloadable racing game.<br/><br/>Board Game Review: The Mage's Triangle (by Demian Katz)<br/>Checkers with three different magical twists.<br/><br/>Role-Playing Review: Shriek 2nd Edition CD-ROM (by Demian Katz)<br/>A fast and easy horror role-playing game in an innovative format.<br/><br/>Card Game Review: SpaceBeans (by Demian Katz)<br/>Yep, it's one of those wacky German games about beans.

Think Three Musketeers meets Brave New World.<br/><br/>What's the core mechanic?<br/>SK uses a die-step, roll-over-target-number system. So skill checks, attack rolls, and magic rolls are all rated according to a die-size (d4, d6, d8, d10, d12, and d20). If you roll and beat the target number or your opponent's roll, then you succeed.<br/><br/>What's combat like?<br/>It's kinetic. It's a little wild and hectic. And it's very, very fast.<br/><br/>There's no initiative. Everyone goes at once. If you can guess what your opponent is going to throw at you - a Haymaker, say, or a Trip - then you can choose your own maneuver to counter that. You're aided in your guessing because each fighting style is different in how one attack sets up the next. Knowing what style your opponent is using is quite important. Not only does an opponent's style betray his possible attacks and counters, but it also allows you to change your own style, if you know more than one.<br/><br/>Twin Weapon Fighting, for instance, has lots of attacks, but not a lot of penetrating power. Guardsman is a good counter-style. But if you don't know Guardsman, and you're facing a TW Fighter, then you have to make do with the different maneuvers within a style that you do know.

The Guildmaster sits behind a vast desk made of some unknown, exotic wood.<br/><br/>The Guildmaster gazes at each of you in turn. &quot;Thank you for agreeing to this meeting. We have heard many tales of your adventures, of the services you have rendered and the quests you have undertaken on behalf of so many, both lordly and common.&quot;<br/><br/>The Guildmaster's eyes drift to one of the maps hanging on the far wall, one that charts the great mountain range to the north. &quot;This guild trades extensively with the mountain dwarves, largely for precious metals of all varieties. Recently, the dwarves lost contact with one of their most valuable mines, Silverhall, which lies in the heart of those mountains.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Our dwarven friends have dispatched two separate parties to travel to the mines and return with word of what has transpired there. Neither has been heard from since leaving the dwarven holdfast. The dwarves have no entreated us for our assistance, and we intend to provide it.&quot;<br/><br/>The Guildmaster reaches into a desk and draws fourth a large leather bag that clinks enticingly when he places it before you. &quot;We ask you to travel to Silverhall and learn what has happened there. If, as I fear, something terrible has befallen the miners, do all that is in your power to find and rescue any that yet live. Do this, and you shall have our gold and our gratitude.&quot;<br/><br/>You're not sure which is more valuable, but both could come in handy.<br/><br/>"}, "55086": {"rpgartist": ["(Uncredited)"], "statistics": [], "name": "RQ Adventures (Issue 3)", "rpgdesigner": ["Troy Bankert", "John E.

Each player starts with a set of 16 tokens referred to as stones; one light set and one dark set. The board is placed between players so that there are seven rows and eight columns. To start the game, each player takes a set of stones and stacks two stones on each of their eight home cells; their nearest row. The Roman player uses the light set and goes first. The Gaul player uses the dark set. Players alternate turns.<br/><br/>The basic units of the game are towers and walls. A tower consists of two like-colored stones in a cell. A wall is a single stone in a cell. Only towers move. The main function of walls is to block the opponent's movement and secondarily they act as stepping stones which can be used later on to create new towers. Towers move by sowing as in Mancala with a stacking limit of two and only like-colored stones may be stacked. Each of the destination cells must be empty or contain a friendly wall. Tower stones can be used to remove adjacent opponent walls. This is done by sacrifice! Material remains equal throughout the game but slowly erodes for both players as players defuse threats. A player is stalemated if unable to move/sow or sacrifice at the start of his or her turn. Going flat out (stalemating yourself) in order to stalemate your opponent can be very satisfying.<br/><br/>Murus Gallicus is a game of balance, space and timing. Players must balance defense and offense. By controlling the board's center, a player can gain mobility. Players must wait for the right moment to squeeze through the opponent's defense. The endgame can be very tense thanks to the balance in material.<br/><br/>There are several useful structures players can employ. The Gallic Wall consisting of orthogonally connected walls (and sometimes towers) requires the opponent to go around the wall or blast his or her way thorough using a sacrificed stone. The Chariot consists of a tower, wall and empty space aligned. By sowing the towers stones in the direction of the wall, the two-celled formation glides forward. The battering ram consists of two towers and an opponent wall aligned. By sacrificing a tower stone, the opponent's wall can be removed. The remaining chariot formation can then move through the breach on the player's next turn. Lastly, a siege tower is a tower sitting within striking distance of the opponent's home row. Such a tower can tie up many of your opponent's pieces.<br/><br/>The true excitement of the game is in the playing. A sneak attack that squeezes through a breach or a well-timed all out assault can be quite satisfying.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": ["First edition", "Print and Play edition"], "average": "7.6549", "name": "Murus Gallicus", "playingtime": "20", "boardgamemechanic": ["Grid Movement"], "age": "10", "usersrated": "51", "boardgamesubdomain": ["Abstract Games"], "boardgamefamily": ["Combinatorial"]}, "55132": {"rpgartist": ["Leonel Domingos da Costa", "Andrew Dobell", "Travis Leichssenring", "German Ponce", "Marco Primo", "Carlos Nunez de Castro Torres"], "rpgitemversion": ["Buch 6: Gesetzlose (German Hardcover Version; 13Mann)", "Little Black Book edition", "PDF Version", "Softcover Version"], "poll": [], "name": "Scoundrel", "rpgdesigner": ["Gareth Hanrahan"], "rpgproducer": ["Charlotte Law", "Nick Robinson"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic552557.jpg", "usersrated": "6", "average": "7.33333", "rpgissuearticle": ["Critics' Corner", "New Releases", "Das Traveller-Pack"], "rpggenre": ["Science Fiction (Hard Sci Fi)", "Science Fiction (Space Opera)"], "rpgpublisher": ["13Mann Verlag", "Mongoose Publishing"], "rpg": ["Traveller (Mongoose)"], "statistics": [], "rpgcategory": ["Sourcebook (rules/options to enhance play)"], "rpgseries": ["Mongoose Traveller Books"], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic552557_t.jpg", "description": "From the Publisher's Website:<br/><br/>Concentrating on Rogue and Drifter careers, Scoundrel brings to life some of the most favoured characters in Traveller - those who avoid legitimate lines of work, who straddle the grey areas of the law.

People come from all over the world and beyond to haggle, trade, and profit, whether the merchandise is common foodstuffs, exotic spices, potent drugs, rare magic, or hardy slaves.

Often mistakenly described as a desert wasteland, Katapesh has a lush ecology that thrives on the spring storms. Bizarre creatures unlike any others in the world live and hunt here. Strange cults worship stranger gods in the secrecy of hidden canyons. Desperate alchemists seek lifegiving herbs in bug-infested swamps.

To howl at the moon as a wolf, to roam the woods as a bear, to scale the trees as a squirrel, or even to cut through the waves as an otter. And not any ordinary animal either, but one from the beloved fables of the Grimm brothers, for example. Although you retain a normal animal appearance, you can be smart, conniving, just, ruthless, resourceful, and whatever the animals were portrayed as in these tales. You can also use tools if you are dexterous enough, move with not only four but with two legs also, and perform feats usually associated with humans.<br/><br/>This game is inspired by and designed to make use of the enchanting world of fables. Therefore, it can be quite far from reality. Although the animals' physical qualities have been made to reflect those of their real-life counterparts as well as possible, some liberties have been taken to serve the fact that this is a game. All animals in this game's world are roughly as intelligent as humans would be. They can also use tools to some extent, while still having arms useable for walking.<br/><br/>This game is based on the assumption of &quot;why not&quot;, so strictly following the rules of realism is not a concern. More important is to attain the atmosphere of fables and be able to produce sessions and campaigns that reflect their world.<br/><br/>"}, "55177": {"rpgartist": ["Lonny Chant", "Nate Furman", "Chris Quilliams", "Philip Renne"], "rpgitemversion": ["Hardcover Version"], "statistics": [], "name": "Hammer's Slammers", "rpgdesigner": ["Gareth Hanrahan"], "rpgproducer": ["William J.

When the domain Almoravids began to fall, arose the second Taifa kingdoms (1144-1170), which were later conquered by the Almohades Arabs. In this period of time raised new Muslim kingdoms that fought with the Christian princes of the north. Muslim Spain bordered with the kingdoms of Portugal, Leon, Castile and Aragon. Fighting and looting was constant and borders and kingdoms were changed continuously. The players represent various Arab and Berber families who struggle for the conquest of Al-Andalus.<br/><br/>The players take roll of kings (emirs) who have small independent kingdoms called Taifas.

Now the imperial bureaucracy enforces devil-worship as the state religion, and the common people bow their heads in perpetual servitude to the dark lord of Hell. Fortunately, Cheliax still has heroes: crusaders and revolutionaries motivated by glory, honor, greed for the throne, or hatred of what their land has become under the infernal thumb of Asmodeus.<br/><br/>This Pathfinder Companion describes the nation of Cheliax, its diabolical capital of Egorian, and its shadow-haunted former capital of Westcrown. Inside you&rsquo;ll also find new character traits, magic items, spells, combat feats, and Chelish NPCs suitable for cohorts or contacts. This book is perfect for use in the Council of Thieves Adventure Path, set in the city of Westcrown, or any adventure taking place in a nation of devils and decadence.<br/><br/>"}, "55275": {"rpgdesigner": ["Jason Blair", "Morten Braten", "Richard Miller (II)", "John A.

Worry rises as regular channels of communication between nations cease like a candle suddenly snuffed. Slowly, throughout the lands claimed by the Ragesian Empire, rumors spread between isolated villages, traveling by foot and horse and word of mouth -- rumors that Drakus Coaltongue, the immortal emperor whose armies conquered every land he set his gaze upon, has fallen in a distant land to the west. How the tyrant was defeated is unknown, but if it is true, everyone knows that a war is coming. The generals of Emperor Coaltongue will strike for control, oppressed peoples will rise up in rebellion, and dangers once held in check only by fear of the mighty warlord will bring doom to the world.<br/><br/>Those in power are preparing for the coming conflict, readying fervent armies and powerful weapons and subtle, deceptive plots, but two questions burn in their minds: who killed the seemingly-immortal Emperor Coaltongue; and what has become of the artifact that would let a man rule of the world? Who has the Torch of the Burning Sky?<br/><br/>E.N.

Players control one of four clans struggling for survival and dominance at the dawn of humanity. To win, you&rsquo;ll have to use everything you&rsquo;ve got: shamanic powers, mighty beasts, brutal weapons, cunning inventions, shiny rocks, diplomatic grunts, threatening stares, and more! Just remember no talking during your turn!<br/><br/>Each player assembles a clan of archaic Homo sapiens, Dino sapiens, Neanderthals, or Troglodytes. Archaic Homo sapiens are our primitive ancestors. They are physically weaker than their rivals, but make up for it with character types that include the nimble Florz (cave halflings) and Cave Nerds (who create amazing prehistoric &quot;technology&quot;). Dino sapiens are semi-intelligent dinosaur people who enlist fierce dinosaurs as their allies. Neanderthals have brawny fighters and shamans who use powerful magic. Troglodytes are the most primitive clan (making even Neanderthals look civilized) but have fearsome creatures like Trogres and the dreaded Dragonasaurus working for them.<br/><br/>Sticks &amp; Stones is a 2-4 player card game. There are 110 cards, including characters from each clan, Woot! cards (events, gear, and special items), and Quest cards (challenges faced by your clan). An optional 5th player can serve as the Cave Master for the game. Players must resort to prehistoric roleplaying as they bluff, intimidate, and cajole each other--all without speaking during their turn!<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": ["First Edition"], "age": "0", "name": "Sticks & Stones Card Game", "playingtime": "0", "boardgamemechanic": ["Card Drafting", "Role Playing"], "average": "6.08333", "usersrated": "21", "boardgamefamily": ["Animals: Dinosaurs"]}, "55291": {"rpgartist": ["Toren Atkinson", "Ed Bourelle", "Kevin Crossley", "Pawel Dobosz", "Talon Dunning", "Jason Engle", "Michael Komarck", "Brian LeBlanc", "Todd Lockwood", "Eric Lofgren", "Howard Lyon", "Michael Phillippi", "Alan Pollack", "R.
