The games are touted as being good for the brain.<br/><br/>There are at least four different games you can play with the Janken Plus set, though not all of them are Rock-Scissors-Paper games.<br/><br/>1. Janken Game: Because the four boards are interlocking, they can be arranged differently, as a 6X6 square (basic game using all 24 janken pieces), or other arrangements with games for 12 pieces.<br/><br/>The pieces can be moved in any direction, any number of squares. Pieces are taken in the traditional Rock beats Scissors beats Paper beats Rock way. The game ends when one player has only two pieces left. On the box it says it's a similar game to Shogi.<br/><br/>2. Play-off Janken: Each player places their pieces face down; they can arrange the pieces as they like. The board isn&rsquo;t used. They each choose one piece and play janken. The winner is the player who captures the most of their opponent&rsquo;s pieces. (This is not a thinking game.)<br/><br/>3. Tic-Tac-Toe variant: Using one board, the players play a Tic-Tac-Toe game aiming to get three pieces in a row. Once a player has played three pieces, he or she can only move them on the board. A variant is to use two or more unconnected boards and more pieces, with the ability to move pieces from board to board.<br/><br/>4. Pinch-pon: Players use six pieces each on the 6X6 board. They capture their opponent&rsquo;s pieces by sandwiching them between two of their own (as in the ancient game of Hnefatafl and similar games).<br/><br/>"}, "19011": {"boardgamedesigner": {"5743": {"name": "Donald S.

It isn't made to teach a list of &quot;facts&quot; about the gospel. Instead, gospel principles are woven into the very fabric of the game. It doesn't give any advantage to the scriptorians or historians. Succeeding at the game requires cooperation, caring for other players, knowing how to build a solid foundation in one's youth, and an understanding of how faith and testimony help you endure trials, and any player who approaches the game in this manner can win.<br/><br/>The game is great at fostering friendly interaction among the players. Even the losers enjoy it, because they tend to end up being the focus of charitable efforts by the other players. Succeeding at the game requires strategy, luck, and advance planning. It teaches LDS values, including the importance of building a foundation that will withstand the adversities of life, the value that hardships can have in building testimony, and the benefits of selfless service. Yes, there is competition in Mortality, because there is a winner, and that's a big part of the entertainment value. But a great part of the fun is in the joking that surrounds the dealing together with experiences and trials in the game that are so much a part of life, but are presented in a somewhat humorous way.<br/><br/>Mortality takes about an hour to an hour-and-a-half to play, depending on the experience and luck of the players. It requires a minimum of three players and up to six can play. Young children can be helped to play the game, but truly understanding it requires an age of at least eight.<br/><br/>You start the game in the childhood section. Here you gain points or &quot;Testimonies&quot; as they are called, strictly by chance, based on what your family does. From there you enter the youth section. As a youth, you begin making decisions on your own that can help you later on or be a detriment to your later progress. You can serve as an LDS missionary, go on dates, and either get a civil marriage or a temple marriage. Avoiding a civil marriage may require some careful advance planning in order to avoid landing on the &quot;civil marriage&quot; square. From there you move into the adult section. One player gets to be the bishop. This assignment may pass from player to player depending on what happens in the game. As you move around in the adult section, you encounter trials of faith. Depending on how many Testimonies you already have, these trials can hurt you or help you. You also have an opportunity to help other players, for which you will gain even more Testimonies.

Some cards are laid face up and you pay 3 pesos to buy the ones you want, or 2 pesos for an unknown card from the draw deck. You spend the cards to put your markers on land and to place your animal tokens on the board. Animals of a type go together to make a herd naturally, and each time a herd touches a market town on the board, you earn money for the size of herd and land attached. With careful hand and herd management, you can make good cash gains and also block your opponents. You need the money to buy more cards of course. 12 pesos also buys waterholes you can place next to your herds, or haciendas to go on your land or herds. If you run short of money, you can call a harvest and get cash off your land.<br/><br/>But the game is not about money. You score victory points halfway through the game and at the end. The more markets you are serving, the more points you get. The herds and the land get you points.

The scale of the game is a 1:1 representation of men and equipment. Time scale is one game turn equals 2 and a half minutes; ground scale is 1 inch equals 10 meters. The miniatures are mounted in multiples on bases that represent rifle teams (3-4 figures), light machine gun teams (2 figures), leaders (1 figure) and weapons teams (2-4 figures depending on the weapon). Tanks and vehicles are mounted singly. Infantry units are made up of two or more rifle teams and zero to two light machine gun teams.<br/><br/>The rules work very well for representing actions on a platoon or company scale. The rules are best for infantry actions. The rules for tanks are not very detailed: one die roll to see if a hit is made, another for the result based on a comparison of the penetrative ability of gun firing with the overall armor quality of the target. However, they tend to give as good an end result as more complex rules. Anti-tank weapons range from the PzB38/39 and PTRD AT rifles to massive 128mm and 152mm AT guns.<br/><br/>GSRS provides rules for hidden set up, pre-battle recon, weather, command control, and target location that can be used to make challenging game scenarios. There are also some &quot;chrome&quot; rules for things like Panzer Aces, Heroes of the Soviet Union, and civilians in the combat zone. The rules also cover the use of cavalry and air support.<br/><br/>The rules includes a lot of information about unit organization, AFV data, and aircraft data. There is also a section detailing the differences between Soviet and German tactics and capabilities.<br/><br/>GSRS is a somewhat obscure and underrated set of miniatures rules that provides a great deal of flavor and compares very well to tactical boardgames like Squad Leader, ASL, and the Advanced Tobruk (ATS) series.<br/><br/>"}, "19119": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic87199.jpg", "boardgameimplementation": {"164363": "Hammer's Slammers: The Crucible"}, "is_expanded_by": {"64604": {"name": "Hammer's Anvils"}}, "poll": {}, "boardgamedesigner": {"2884": {"name": "John Lambshead"}}, "statistics": {}, "yearpublished": "2004", "maxplayers": "4", "boardgamepublisher": {"4354": {"name": "Miniatures Wargames Pireme Publishing Ltd."}}, "maxplaytime": "60", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic87199_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "60", "boardgamecategory": {"1047": {"name": "Miniatures"}}, "description": "Vehicle designs &amp; technical specification plus an easy play gaming system.

It's the kind of game for those nights when you'd like to play something, but don't want to commit to a traditional fantasy sports simulation.<br/><br/>One of the great mysteries of the sport of Elfball is just where it began, and how it got its name. The Elves of the vast forests of the Westerlands claim to have been playing the sport since the dawn of time, and that they named it in honor of themselves. The Dwarves and Orcs, high in their mountain homes, dispute this bold claim and insist that the game&rsquo;s name instead refers to the type of severed head that makes the best ball core; both races maintain that they are in fact the originators and some of the bloodiest wars in the history of the realms have been fought over this claim. The men of the Middle Kingdoms ignore the squabbles of the elder races and call the game De Circque instead.<br/><br/>Today Elfball is played by every nation and tribe of the world, and with a few regional variations, it is played the same on fields throughout The Realms. The design of the field, the distinctive ball, and the rules of play are all quite standardized.<br/><br/>This game was prototyped in 2002 by Phigs Miniatures but did not see production until the game rules were overhauled and changed about 80% from the prototype and then released by Impact!

The local Viet Cong commander, Colonel Nguyen Than Hong, aimed to make a large attack on 6th Bn causing a politically unacceptable loss, hoping to cause its withdrawal.

As a player you have been invited to a wild party along with twelve naughty but nice characters. The object of play is for you to score as many &quot;seductions&quot; as possible.<br/><br/>The board is set up as a modest movie star type estate with various rooms. Bedroom, den, kitchen, etc, with an outside garden, pool, and entrance way. The objective of the game is to move various characters about from room to room, with the intent of gathering as many together in a room as possible. You must have the characters and the room card to score points. So as you move a character towards a room to have a group seduction with other character cards you have in hand, another player may have the same character card, and wishes this character to have a seduction with the players they are gathering in a different part/room of the estate. The more people you can gather in a room together the more points you score. There are optional rules that allow for gay seductions. Like Ticket to ride, the longer the track built the more points, in Lovers Wild the more characters in a room having a seduction, the more points. Multiples of characters must be as equal as possible, if 5 people in a room are having a seduction, 2 or 3 must be women, one woman and four men does not make an seduction or scoring hand. Fast moving game, lay your hand for points if you can, draw a card, move a character. The more players the more difficult larger seductions are. The board in nicely done, and character chits are humorous with a variety of people types, that fits well in with game, with names like Hands a Roaming, Lucy Love Lace, Dolly Pardon.

The player purposefully conducts the affairs of the Russian Empire and its allies, while the game system does the same for the anti-Russian coalition made up of a shifting alliance of powers.<br/><br/>Central to play of the game are its 'policy cards.' They trigger various strategies, powers at war, and other events that shape the general course of play. Policy cards are activated in one of two ways: the Empire player can choose which policies he will activate, while coalition policies are activated by the draw of markers. The Empire player may move his forces freely. The game system moves coalition forces according to a schedule of precedence.<br/><br/>The objective of the game is for the Russian Empire to have gained an advantageous position at the end of play, measured in terms of gaining certain objectives. The player must, however, also look toward maintaining the &quot;balance of power,&quot; or he may face disintegration of the entire European state system. Depending on how well the player attains his objectives, then, will really be the thing that determines the nature of victory.<br/><br/>While Catherine the Great has been purpose-designed to be a solitaire game, more than one can play at the same time as part of a Russian Empire command team. Players can divvy up responsibilities as they please for different parts of the Russian Empire, with the most veteran gamer taking the role of Czar and deciding who gets what resources.

However, there are also the external enemies of these kingdoms: the Irish, the Picts, and the Saxons. There is also an army list for Romans.<br/><br/>Figures are mounted in multiples on stands that represent warbands. Warband types can be Heavy Cavalry (HC), Light Cavalry (LC), Heavy Infantry (HI), and Light Infantry (LI). The warbands are further distinguished by a set of three &quot;characteristics&quot; that play an important role in movement and combat. These characteristics are Formation, Aggression, and Strength and are represented by a numerical value that can fluctuate during the game. Based on warband type and nationality or kingdom, there are set maximums for each of these characteristics. If the value for any one characteristic decreases to zero, the warband is lost.<br/><br/>Players control their armies through Command Points that are determined by a die roll. Using his Command Points, a player can move his warbands or increase their Formation and Aggression values up to the maximum allowed. (The Strength characteristic represents the number of warriors in the warband. Once a Strength point is lost, it stays lost.)<br/><br/>Armies are divided into two distinct categories of warband. The Comitatus represents the personal retinue of the leader, the trained warriors whose only job is to be fighters. The Contingent represents levy troops who are not primarily warriors but can be pressed into service to swell the numbers of an army. The maximum Formation and Aggression values for the Comitatus are higher than those for the Contingent.<br/><br/>When choosing the warbands that make up his army, a player must use all the Comitatus warbands in his army list (there are always five). However, he may choose any number of the Contingent warbands from none to all. The number of warbands in the army is a critical pre-game decision a player must make. The starting values for Formation and Aggression are assigned to the warbands from a pool of 30 Command Points that a player starts with. Even if he chooses only the Comitatus, he will likely be unable to start with his warbands at maximum values and must build them up during the game using his Command Points. This &quot;building up&quot; of the warbands represents the need for a leader to organize and inspire his warriors for them to be at their maximum effectiveness in battle. If a player divides his 30 Command Points between too many warbands, the starting values will be very low and he must spend several turns building up his warbands.<br/><br/>Combat is divided between missile file and melee. Every warband has some kind of missile weapon (javelins, slings, bows). Firing is done by comparing a firing warband's Strength to the target's modified die roll. If the die roll is lower than the firing unit's Strength, some effect is made against the target.<br/><br/>The values that warbands use for melee depends on the nature of contact: warbands that move into combat use their Aggression value, warbands who are stationary when contacted use their Formation value, and warbands that are continuing a melee (no initial contact this turn) use their Strength--the combat has degenerated to a slog bewteen mobs of armed men.<br/><br/>As a result of combat, warbands may Stand, Rally Back, or Retreat in addition to varying losses in Formation, Aggression, and Strength. A very successful warband may actually increase Aggression as a result of combat. Warbands are never eliminated outright in combat unless their losses reduce one of their characteristics to zero. In many cases, a warband has to get hammered for several rounds of melee before it is lost.<br/><br/>Glutter of Ravens is based on the Dark Age Infantry Slog concept that was featured in a volume of Wargames Illustrated magazine. The rules also seem to borrow from the De Bellis Antiquitatis (DBA) rules from WRG.

Step right up, ladies &amp; gents! Make fantastic medical claims for your bottled elixir. Slander your opponents and steal their secrets! Avoid angry mobs and law enforcement while weaseling the highest price possible for your Snake-Oil!<br/><br/>3-4 players is ideal, but can be played by 2-8.<br/><br/>From the rules:<br/><br/>The Setting: In the latter part of the 19th Century and well into the 20th, an industry boomed across the American Midwest. That industry was the Medicine Show, where any entrepreneur with a questionable recipe and plenty of business savvy could pull his wagon up to the center of town and hawk his medicinal wares for a few cents per bottle. You and your opponents are these peddlers of &ldquo;Snake-Oil&rdquo;.<br/><br/>The Object: In Snake-Oil, the object is to achieve the highest per bottle price for your elixir. To do this, you may have to hire thugs, slander your opponents and plant ringers in the crowd. But it&rsquo;s all in good fun and, hey, you always have the next town for your opponents to get revenge.<br/><br/>Game Length: A game of Snake-Oil can last is little as 5 minutes or as long as an hour, depending on how many towns you and your opponents decide to hit. Each hand of Snake-Oil constitutes a town. The game includes a score sheet with room for the name of your product and a running tally for three towns. When you&rsquo;ve played the number of hands you&rsquo;ve agreed upon, add up the totals for each town and the winner is the player with the highest total value.<br/><br/>Setup: Each player is dealt 7 cards face down (if there are more than 4 players, deal 5 cards each). This constitutes his hand at the start of the game. The remaining cards are placed in the middle of the table, and the discard pile will go next to it. The player to the dealer&rsquo;s left goes first.<br/><br/>Play: A player must first play a Cure if he has one. This goes directly in front of him in his playing area. He may then play any other card (except for another Cure). If he doesn&rsquo;t have a Cure to play first, he may go directly to playing his second card. [Cards that are not Cures modify the value of the Cures or may cause Cures to be switched or discarded, etc.] He may opt not to play a second card. At the end of the player&rsquo;s turn, he may draw as many cards from the deck as necessary to ensure he ends the turn with 7 cards in his hand. A player may opt to discard his entire hand and draw an equal amount of cards from the deck in lieu of playing any cards on his turn. This simply indicates his wagon has burned down and he&rsquo;s buying new ingredients.<br/><br/>Ending the Hand: The hand ends when the player who draws the last card from the deck finishes his turn, or when a hand-ending card is played successfully. There are 2 such cards: Rain! and Bust!. There is also a counter (or negating card) for each of them. A player may not end the hand by this method unless he has a value of at least 20&cent; in front of him. Ending a hand by this method does not affect any cards already in play.<br/><br/>Added Hype: There is a quick table included to randomly determine the name of your product (handy if you&rsquo;re playing a four town Medicine Show). Snake-Oil is fun to play, but it&rsquo;s a lot MORE fun when players start getting into the spirit of the game and hyping their products with zeal.

Even though the mechanics are pretty straightforward (there are only 14 pages of actual rules), there is a great amount of adjudication needed for every shot taken.<br/><br/>Players use range estimation and plot their shots by target, distance, number of shots, and spread. Factors such as the hieght of the firing ship's gun platform from sea level and a target factor based on the target ship's size are cross-referenced with the range to determine the &quot;Danger Space&quot; that extends beyond the ship model. All shots that are estimated to fall within the Danger Space are considered hits. The location of hits is determined from the Hit Probability Table and Armor chart that is unique to every ship. After this, penetration, damage, and critical hits are determined. The whole process for a single shot can be lengthy. Games that involve several model ships can take a very long time to adjudicate all the shots in any one game turn.<br/><br/>The rules recommend that judges be used in the game in order to adjudicate the shots and record damage that only the player commanding the ship can see. Because of the time involved in this, the rules also recommend that an area be set aside for the players commanding the ships to play other games (like Monopoly) while waiting for the results of the firing to be determined.<br/><br/>The area needed for play can be quite large. Gun ranges at 1:2400 scale can go up to 30 feet. Something like a gymnasium floor is the best place to play if you plan on a large fleet action like Dogger Bank or Jutland.<br/><br/>For small actions, like the SMS Emden vs. the HMAS Sydney, these rules can be very good becasue the detail makes the individual action more exciting.

The game includes three booklets: Campaign Game, Miniatures Game, and Historical Analysis.<br/><br/>The Campaign Game is played on a map of the American colonies that is divided into regions. Each region is worth a number of victory points for the British player if they hold it. Holding a region requires a garrison whose size varies by region. For example, Massachussetts Bay requires a garrison of 4000 men; the Mohawk Valley requires a garrison of only 500 men. Regions also provide a number of Loyalists that can be recruited as Provincial units in the British army, Militia who fight as partisans against the British, and a variable number of Continental Army recruits.<br/><br/>Movement in the campaign is by area (Region). Americans move pretty freely, but the British forces can have some difficulty getting around. This represents the fact that the British found it hard to get their armies where they wanted them when they wanted them (for example, Gentleman Johnny Burgoyne's miserable time in upper New York in 1777). As the British move through areas, they trigger the arrival of loyalists and militia.<br/><br/>Campaign years are divided into four seasons (turns). The fourth season is winter, which prohibits any British units from moving while allowing American forces to move at a lower rate. However, winter also causes &quot;winter attrition&quot; among American Continental units.<br/><br/>American forces are created through Continental recruitment and militia (who appear as a result of British being in an area). British forces, except for Provincial units, arrive (and leave) according to their historical schedules. The French may intervene depending on whether the Americans can win a Major Victory.<br/><br/>Winning the campaign game for the British requires a long, slow haul of hanging on to sufficient regions (which generate victory points) from 1775 to 1783. Americans win the campaign game by winning Major Victories over the British or by holding out and denying the British their victory conditions.<br/><br/>The rules for the Miniatures Game are pretty standard for 1976, but compare very well to many current rules. The ground scale is 1&quot; equals 15 yards. Time scale is 1 turn equals 15 minutes. Figure scale is variable; regulars are 1:30 while milita and Indians are 1:50.<br/><br/>The size of the playing area depends on the number of combatants in the campaign battle. The terrain set up for a battle depends on the size of the playing area and the Terrain Factor of the region where the battle is located. The defending player places the terrain in the playing area and the attacking player chooses which edge of the playing area he will deploy on.<br/><br/>Morale plays a large part in the game. British units tend to be very good, while American units are mostly average to poor. Battles can be a challenge for the Americans, but they can rely on their strengths in skirmishing and shooting--and avoiding British bayonet charges.<br/><br/>Leaders play a significant role in the game and are specified as Class I and Class II, who are named individuals, and Class III, who represent generic leaders. The rules offer ratings for different historical generals (Benedict Arnold is only rated once as an American).<br/><br/>Without being difficult, the rules add some nuances that bring out the flavor of 18th century warfare. Shooting is *very deadly* at point blank range (1&quot;), but its effect attenuates dramatically as the range increases. Units that stand to receive a charge roll on a Volley Effectiveness Table to determine the range when they open fire. Poorer units will fire too soon and waste the potential destructiveness of the volley; better units can hold their fire on the attacker until they &quot;see the whites of their eyes.&quot;<br/><br/>There are also some &quot;chrome&quot; rules like sappers, Indians, Night Attacks, and the &quot;Simcoe/Tarelton Bugle Tactic.&quot;<br/><br/>"}, "19292": {"boardgamedesigner": {"3": {"name": "(Uncredited)"}}, "poll": {}, "name": "Let's Bowl A Game", "playingtime": "20", "minplayers": "1", "yearpublished": "1965", "usersrated": "0", "boardgamefamily": {"5700": "Sports: Bowling"}, "maxplayers": "4", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic150815_t.jpg", "average": "0", "statistics": {}, "boardgamepublisher": {"4399": {"name": "DMR Company"}}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic150815.jpg", "boardgameversion": {"238201": "First edition"}, "maxplaytime": "20", "boardgamecategory": {"1002": {"name": "Card Game"}}, "age": "0", "minplaytime": "20", "description": "Roll a strike, pick up a spare or even make that split and &quot;bowl over&quot; your opponents.

Movement, stacking, and Zones of Control are typical of most other games. Combat consists of artillery barrage and infantry assault.<br/><br/>Artillery can play a big part in the game, as it did historically in the battle. Players are limited in using their artillery by the ammunition factors they must keep track of on the Ammunition Availability Chart. Artillery expends ammunition factors when it fires, which may cause shortages. So, despite a large number of artillery units on both sides, players must use their guns judiciously.<br/><br/>Assault is done after movement and after artillery bombardment. Attackers must designate their assaults during the movement phase before artillery fire. As a result of artillery fire, both an attacker and defender can be severely affected. Attackers must carry out their assaults regardless of losses from artillery, which can be disastrous.<br/><br/>Supply rules are typical of many wargames. The rules provide means of destroying the opposing players artillery ammunition stocks and for interdicting rail lines and roads that serve as supply lines.<br/><br/>The game adds some chrome with German pioneers (who aid in assaults), balloons spotting for artillery, road interdiction (which affects French supply), and gas attacks.

The easy game system recreates battlefield conditions with a move-fight-rally play sequence to simulate the grand tactics of these battles. Additional rules include command control, morale, artillery, light infantry, and dragoons. Each battle is represented by its own units and map along with exclusive rules to recreate the unique battlefield situation. Units are generally regiments, and rated for combat strength, morale, and march capabilities. Famous leaders are also included-Washington, Howe, Greene, and Knyphausen. Battles range from Bunker Hill, through Brooklyn and Trenton, to Saratoga and Monmouth, and on to the South at Cowpens, Guilford, and King's Mountain.<br/><br/>Volume III:<br/><br/>The New York Campaign :<br/><br/><br/>     Brooklyn (27 Aug 1776). Howe moves his forces onto Long Island and uses a long flanking march to get behind the advance American forces, but does not follow up his victory with an assault on the American main line. Fearing a naval trap, Washington retreats his forces to Manhattan.<br/><br/><br/><br/>     Harlem Heights (16 Sep 1776). After positioning new lines at the neck of Manhattan, the British move onto Manhattan and take New York City. On 16 September, an American foraging party runs into a British scouting force and a skirmish begins. Both sides begin sending forces into the developing battle. The Americans push the British back two miles nearly reaching the British camps before being stopped. The American morale, flagging after the defeat and retreat from Brooklyn, was restored. Still, the growing British threat to outflank the Americans forced Washington to fall back.<br/><br/><br/><br/>     White Plains (28 Oct 1776) Historically, the battle ended after a lengthy skirmish on Chatterton Hill between a mixed force of British and Hessians versus American militia and regulars. The slow moving British prepared for a battle three days later, but by then Washington had retreated further north to cross the Hudson River and head south to New Jersey. Howe decided not to pursue and instead seized Ft. Washington. However, there are accounts that suggest that Howe might have assaulted the main American line immediately.<br/><br/><br/>The New Jersey Campaign :<br/><br/><br/>     Trenton (26 Dec 1776) Washington conceives of a bold move to cross the Delaware River and surprise the Hessian outpost in Trenton as a means to gain a victory, and turn the morale of his troops. After crossing the Delaware and marching for several hours in snow and sleet, the force divided into two columns in an effort to surround Trenton, and cut off retreat and reinforcement. The Hessians had no expectation of a surprise attack, and partied late into Christmas night. The American columns managed to emerge almost simultaneously on the few pickets, overwhelming them, and moving in and around Trenton as the Hessians scrambled to defend themselves. In less than two hours, almost the entire 1,400 man garrison was bagged.<br/><br/><br/><br/>     Princeton (3 Jan 1777) At the end of 1776, Washington was facing the imminent departure of most of his remaining force.

It is for anyone interested in politics, or who likes playing games - or who thinks the two are synonymous anyway. It is intended also as a useful adjunct for both teachers and students of politics, adding a practical, constructive but enjoyable dimension to their studies.<br/>It is about getting your own way, seizing power, making money, reneging on your promises. Players can be politicians, form parties, fight elections, overthrow governments and make all kinds of deals. From 'Primitive Politics' to 'Rolling Logs' and from 'Elections' to 'Agenda', each game is an attempt to capture the cut and thrust of political double-dealing.&quot;<br/><br/>The author hopes that the games in this book will be fun to play and can be enjoyed by people who don't care about politics. However, the games are intended to show some aspect of the political process. Ten fundamental laws of nature that apply to all the games are set out in the first chapter of the book. Each subsequent chapter gives the rules of a new game and includes a discussion on strategy and how the game relates to reality.<br/><br/>The games in this book are:<br/>1) Primitive Politics (number of players 2 to 2,000,000,000)<br/>2) Entrepreneurs<br/>3) Elections<br/>4) Coalitions<br/>5) Coelections<br/>6) Rolling Logs<br/>7) Agenda<br/><br/>The games can be played with a minimum of equipment - pencils, paper, money, playing cards.<br/><br/>The book was originally published be Pelican in 1979.

They use a figure scale of 1 figure equals 20 men and a ground scale of 1&quot; equals 20 paces.<br/><br/>Units are made up of five or more figures. Units are rated by such things as how they are armed, what kind or armor protection they have, how they are trained, and what level of morale they have.<br/><br/>Shooting and hand to hand combat are done by comparing the weapon of the attacker with the armor of the defender, and then adding tactical factors to get a total factor, which is then cross-referenced with the number of figures in the unit that is shooting or attacking. The result is an actual number of casualties in men, which players have to divide by 20 to see how many figures are removed from the unit. Casualties that are less than 20 are noted and added to further casualties later on. This way of recording casualties, which was unique to the WRG games of the 70s, is a nice way of getting around an all-or-nothing casualty removal system. Even if casualties are few in any single combat event, there is still a cumulative effect that can cause figure removal later on.<br/><br/>The morale of units may need to be checked with a Reaction Test for several reasons throughout the game. There are many variables that can affect the Reaction Test. Each variable adds to or subtracts from a roll of three average dice (2-3-3-4-4-5). The result is cross-referenced with the morale grade of the unit to determine the outcome. As a result of a Reaction Test, a unit may initiate an uncontrolled advance towards the nearest enemy, break and run away, or do something in between (the best result is always &quot;carry on&quot;).<br/><br/>Units are given orders at the start of a game. Units must move and attack according to their orders until they lose their orders through a failed Reaction Test or until the orders are changed. Orders are the only command/control mechanism in the game. Players always have one CinC figure and may have one or more sub-generals. The CinC and sub-generals mostly aid in combat and Reaction Tests.<br/><br/>The rules are complex and require players to use good tactical sense, which includes supporting units with other units (this helps in Reaction Tests) and knowing when and where to attack an opponent's units to get the best possible result. They are much more subtle than the Warhammer games produced by Games Workshop. They aren't designed for a quick &quot;bash 'em up.&quot; They take time to learn, but they reward players who use sound tactics rather than players who are lucky with dice.<br/><br/>The first edition of the rules covers warfare from about the beginning of the Italian Wars to the end of the English Civil Wars. The second edition adds things like handguns (primitive firearms) and plug bayonets that allow for wargaming battles from the latter part of the Hundred Years War, which saw the introduction of firearms, to the Nine Years War in the Low Countries, which was the end of the Pike and Shot era. The second edition also adds siege rules.<br/><br/>Note: The second edition rules are called Wargames Rules for Fifteenth to Seventeenth Centuries (1420-1700).<br/><br/>These wargame rules are based on an earlier set of rules by Dave Millward called Musketeer. They are also heavily based on Wargames Research Group's (WRG) 4th and 5th edition Ancients rules, which pioneered the basic game mechanics.<br/><br/>As with other WRG rules, several Army Lists were separately published that provide guidelines for players to create historical armies.<br/><br/>"}, "19309": {"boardgamedesigner": {"3": {"name": "(Uncredited)"}}, "poll": {}, "name": "Brandubh: Celtic Royal Chess", "playingtime": "30", "minplayers": "2", "yearpublished": "1932", "usersrated": "2", "boardgamesubdomain": {"4666": "Abstract Games"}, "maxplayers": "2", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic104650_t.jpg", "average": "6.5", "statistics": {}, "boardgamepublisher": {"4317": {"name": "Acorn Games"}}, "boardgamefamily": {"4049": "Tafl"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic104650.jpg", "boardgameversion": {"200638": "First edition"}, "maxplaytime": "30", "boardgamecategory": {"1009": {"name": "Abstract Strategy"}}, "age": "0", "minplaytime": "30", "description": "From the publisher:<br/><br/>Brandubh translates into &quot;Black Ravens&quot; or &quot;Black Crows&quot; in Ancient Gaelic and features a larger force of &quot;Robbers&quot; attacking the &quot;King&quot; and his &quot;Lords&quot;.

The rules are suitable for 1:300th to 28mm scale, though they work best for 15mm miniatures.<br/><br/>The ground scale for the game is 1&quot; equals 10 metres, 1 turn equals 2 1/2 minutes, 1 model soldier/vehicle equals 1 real soldier/vehicle.<br/><br/>The basic unit for the game is an infantry squad or individual gun and crew or single AFV. Infantry are mounted in multiples on bases that represent rifle groups, light machine gun groups, heavy machine gun groups, light mortar groups. etc. Leaders, who represent platoon leaders and senior NCOs, are mounted singly.<br/><br/>The sequence of play follows traditional lines: Initiative, Move, Fire, Close Assault, Morale. However, there is a Watch and Shoot phase, where units can elect to fire before the normal Fire phase or hold their fire to take opportunity fire against the opponent's moving units. Only units with Watch and Shoot orders can take opportunity fire.<br/><br/>Firing is done by individual stands; there is no mechanism for combining the fire of several stands, though the results of fire combat can have a cumulative effect. Fire combat uses a unique system where a firing stand's weapon type is first cross-referenced with one of six major columns that represent the cover state of the target unit(s), then cross-referenced with the result of a modified die roll. Results can create individual casualties for a stand or, in a separate die roll, the loss of the entire stand. Because casualties represent the loss of single soldiers, a stand may take several casualties before it is lost.<br/><br/>Before units can be targeted for fire, they must be spotted. The visibility of units can be affected by  activities such as moving, firing, etc. Units might be very difficult to spot, which represents the historical difficulty of seeing the enemy in the dense terrain of Normandy. In larger games, keeping track of which units are spotted may be cumbersome.<br/><br/>Morale is strictly based on the performance of historical units. There is a special category called Fanatic that is used solely by units of the 12th SS &quot;Hitlerjugend&quot; division. This represents the relative inexperience of the troops combined with the fanaticism instilled in them through their Hitler Youth indoctrination. Most Allied units are classed as Inexperienced, which represents the fact that, though well-trained, they are experiencing combat for the first time. Other Classifications are Elite (such as Airborne units and most of the SS), Veteran (most German units), and Poor (such as German Ostbattalion units).<br/><br/>The antitank rules are fairly simply, but they tend to provide predictable historical results. The rules don't really seem to emphasize tank combat. Rather, tanks are added in as a specialized heavy weapon, but the rules are not intended for large tank vs. tank actions.<br/><br/>The game play allows for hidden set up and limited hidden movement, which can give the defender (usually the Germans) the ability to mount a very tenacious defense while being strongly outnumbered.<br/><br/>Overlord can be used to play games that consist of only a few squads or up to a full battalion on each side. However, larger games can be slow.<br/><br/>Many of the mechanics for Overlord are similar to the mechanics used in the designer's other WW2 tactical rules, &quot;Grey Storm, Red Steel.&quot;<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "name": "Overlord", "playingtime": "90", "boardgamemechanic": {"2070": "Simulation"}, "average": "6.33333", "boardgameexpansion": {}, "usersrated": "3", "boardgamesubdomain": {"4664": "Wargames"}, "age": "0"}, "19331": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic88747.jpg", "poll": {}, "boardgamedesigner": {"3": {"name": "(Uncredited)"}}, "statistics": {}, "yearpublished": "1994", "maxplayers": "4", "age": "4", "boardgamepublisher": {"254": {"name": "University Games"}}, "maxplaytime": "30", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic88747_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "30", "boardgamecategory": {"1041": {"name": "Children's Game"}}, "description": "This is a newer edition of the &quot;Where in the World is Carmen Sandiego&quot; game but redesigned for younger players.<br/><br/>FROM THE BOX:<br/>&quot;Attention Parents of Junior Detectives:<br/>Your children don't need to read to track Carmen Sandiego!

Ship models are organized in squadrons of varying size. Each ship is rated by speed, ramming factor, and boarding factor.

Moving by oars can tire your crews, but moving by sail makes you subject to the wind--also, having a sail aboard your boats can be a negative for taking reaction tests (have sail, will sail away).<br/><br/>The action is pretty fast when ships start crunching together. The rules for ramming are simple and deadly. Boarding actions can be affected by the use of towers or &quot;ferrea manus&quot; (grappling devices such as the Roman corvus).

Forces became a hotch-potch of individual ships, differing widely in their abilities and deficiencies, as the older ships mixed with the new. Specialized missions and hostile environments sometimes necessitated vessels of novel and awkward design, such as the river craft of the American Civil War. With these new ships came new and terrifying weapons, destroying forever the world of Nelson and Hornblower.<br/><br/>&quot;However, two factors bound this era of change into a single period: the predominance of steam propulsion and the control of gunnery by individual gunners.<br/><br/>&quot;It is upon these two factors that this set of rules has been based, enabling players to experience the changes &quot;first hand&quot; as a continuous process rather than examining each conflict in the period as an event unrelated to any other, and to appreciate as a whole the era of naval warfare before the Dreadnought.&quot;<br/><br/>These rules offer some interesting mechanics to take into account the vast changes in naval warfare that occurred during the period they cover. Rules exist for maneuvering ships under sail, under steam power, and under a combination of both sail and steam.<br/><br/>Gunnery includes muzzle-loading smooth bore cannon, muzzle-loading rifled cannon, early breech-loading cannon, and modern naval ordnance. The gunnery also includes rules to cover the different effects of the rounds that could be fired, such as solid round shot, solid armor-piercing (AP) shot, later AP shell, and common shell.<br/><br/>Ships' armor values are calculated using tables in the rules that cover such things as the kind of metal (solid iron, laminated iron, mild steel, Harveyized steel, Krupp steel, etc.) and, for earlier ironclads, the type and thickness of the wood backing the iron armor.<br/><br/>For an aficionado of the era, the rules can be very interesting because of the details of ship design and armament that are addressed.<br/><br/>However, there is something about the wide scope of the rules that creates problems. For example, to determine where a shot hits, players roll on a table that lists the various parts of a ship. But the parts listed don't apply to all ships within the period. Things like &quot;secondary turrets&quot; don't exist on an ironclad ram. Inapplicable hits are simply assigned to one of two areas, but this tends to skew the hit allocation.<br/><br/>There are very few ready-to-go ship stats included in the rules. Players are expected to create ships stats to use in the game based on the guidelines in the rules for designing these using data from external sources, such as &quot;Jane's Fighting Ships,&quot; &quot;Conway's All the World's Fighting Ships,&quot; and others.<br/><br/>Players will also need to supply the templates used to determine the turning radii of the model ships. The ones included in the rules are hand drawn and not really suitable for play.<br/><br/>One the whole, The Devil at the Helm has a lot of good ideas and is a strong basis for a good set of naval wargame rules for this period. But they leave a lot of rough edges for the players to smooth.<br/><br/>"}, "19355": {"boardgamedesigner": {"5847": {"name": "Ben King"}}, "poll": {}, "name": "Fusil and Fortress", "playingtime": "180", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": {"2070": "Simulation"}, "yearpublished": "1977", "usersrated": "3", "boardgamesubdomain": {"4664": "Wargames"}, "maxplayers": "2", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic89102_t.jpg", "average": "7.33333", "statistics": {}, "boardgamepublisher": {"4411": {"name": "Systems Analysis"}}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic89102.jpg", "maxplaytime": "180", "boardgamecategory": {"2726": {"name": "Age of Reason"}}, "age": "12", "minplaytime": "180", "description": "&quot;Being an Account of the Art of War During the Time of His Grace The Duke of Marlborough&quot;<br/><br/>Introduction<br/><br/>Fusil and Fortress is a Systems Analysis Classic Series game which offers the player an incredible amount of detail while providing a game which is easy to learn, interesting to read, and challenging to play. Fusil and Fortress is designed as a two-part game. Sections one through nine contain the rules required to play the tactical game, with Section three devoted to history, tactics, and organization. Sections ten through fourteen contain the rules for siege warfare, supply, engineering, and administration. Fusil and Fortress is not designed as a multi-level game in which you must learn more and more complicated rules. Once you have read the game, you can play it. We do this for two reasons. Our games are clearly written and our design staff feels that the wargamer has a lot more common sense than many games give him credit for. As an added bonus, Fusil and Fortress is designed to be played with or without an umpire.<br/><br/>We feel that Fusil and Fortress will be one of the most engaging games you have ever played. The reason for this is that all our designers are wargamers and understand problems with rules.<br/><br/>Designer's Notes<br/><br/>Because Fusil and Fortress is the first commercial wargame to effectively address warfare in the early 18th Century, the design staff felt that it was appropriate to discuss certain elements of game construction because of the radical departure from traditional game mechanics.<br/><br/>In most games, actual formations are sacrificed in order to cram the appropriate number of figures in the proper space. Thus, a one-deep line of figures may represent a two- or three-deep line of actual soldiers. While this method of game design may be perfectly acceptable for other eras, it would not be for the early 18th Century. Linear Infantry formations and numbers of ranks were of paramount importance and it would be impossible to use one rank of figures to represent more than one rank. Therefore, we have sacrificed a little space for accuracy and detail unknown in any other game. The upshot is that a unit will operate in the correct linear space in the proper number of ranks, but it will occupy an area slightly deeper than it actually would have. The rules have been formulated to mitigate this depth.<br/><br/>This unique design enables Fusil and Fortress to demonstrate the differences in the Dutch, Swedish, and French methods of musketry in a way you can actually see so that you can make them work the way they actually did.<br/><br/>The rules for artillery have also been designed to accurately represent the &quot;fall of shot&quot; and the occasional ricochet. The windage gauge is normally placed near the target which results in a smaller angular deviation of shot as the range increases. The inaccuracy of this method is obvious, and we have corrected it. Because of the design of the artillery firing system in Fusil and Fortress, no artificial additions for enfilade fire or other tactical advantages are needed.<br/><br/>The siege rules are a wargaming first and we do not believe that anything like them can be found anywhere. We have done everything possible to create in miniature the Vauban method of siegecraft and fortification. In conjunction with these unique combat and siege rules, we have also provided every last detail for engineering, supply, and administration, so that you can even &quot;pay&quot; your troops if you want to. You do not have to use all the information in Fusil and Fortress to have an exciting early 18th Century wargame, but when you do want information, it is there.<br/><br/>We feel that keeping these design differences in mind will help you understand the game better and enjoy it more. Good gaming.<br/><br/>"}, "19357": {"boardgamedesigner": {"3": {"name": "(Uncredited)"}}, "poll": {}, "name": "Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles Tower of Doom", "playingtime": "15", "minplayers": "1", "usersrated": "9", "yearpublished": "1990", "boardgameimplementation": {"173646": "Star Trek: The Next Generation \u2013 The Final Frontier"}, "boardgamefamily": {"7366": "Animals: Turtles"}, "maxplayers": "4", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic89434_t.jpg", "average": "5.38889", "statistics": {}, "boardgamepublisher": {"1574": {"name": "Habourdin International"}}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic89434.jpg", "maxplaytime": "15", "boardgamecategory": {"1032": {"name": "Action / Dexterity"}}, "age": "0", "minplaytime": "15", "description": "Our Ninja heroes must escape from the &quot;Tower of Doom&quot; and the Giant Samurai Swords penetrating it.

Turns are regulated by the visits of Lincoln, who determines, bit-by-bit, the value of the towns relative to those three criteria. These criteria can and do change every round, and you will need to adapt to these changing criteria to win this game!<br/><br/>Each player has his own board on which he will be building his town. Every building gives him different, and increasing, rights and abilities, and therefore power.

Of 22 different buildings, six of them are identified every round as &quot;bonus&quot; buildings, and players are forced to adapt varying strategies and test new combinations of these buildings for their town as the game progresses.<br/><br/>In addition to logic and strategy, Marshals will need to bluff and occasionally resort to questionably bending the law a bit, to succeed in building their Western Town.

Players compete to build the longest caterpillar from tiles depicting heads, body segments and tails. To do this they take turns spinning a plastic pointer. When it stops, it will point to either a head tile, a body tile or a tail tile. The player picks up a tile of the indicated kind and adds it to the caterpillar he is currently building in front of him. A complete caterpillar has a head, at least one body tile, and a tail. A player must complete his current caterpillar before beginning a new one. If his caterpillar needs a tail, and the pointer stops at a head or a body tile, he may not pick up a tile but must try again on his next turn. There is nothing players can do the affect the outcome. Longest caterpillar at the end of the game wins.<br/><br/>There are 40 body tiles, 8 head tiles and 8 tail tiles. All heads are different but they are all happy faces, some with hats and so on. It doesn't really matter which heads you choose, but this may still seem important to young players.

In the catalogue for the exhibition, Asian Games: The Art of Contest, the following names for this game are mentioned:<br/>hulu pan (gourd board) - southern Fujian and eastern Guangdong area<br/>hulu qi (gourd chess) in Hong Kong<br/>hulu wen (gourd puzzle)in Suzhou<br/>fenghuang qi (male and female phoenix chess)in places such as Tianjin, Weixian (Shandong Province), and Chengdu (Sichuan Province).<br/><br/>I know it, in Singapore, as Hor Lor Boon.<br/><br/>This game is played on a board showing a spiral track and the object is to move one's piece from the outside into the center of the track first(q.v. Game of Goose and Sheng Guan Tu). The track is made up of individual symbols which will be repeated once on the board. Players roll two dice and move the number of symbols along the track. Wherever they land, they will then jump to the corresponding symbol elsewhere on the board (which could be a help or a hindrance).
