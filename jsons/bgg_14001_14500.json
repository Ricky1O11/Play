The four engines start at the sheds and must get to the station around the various lines and branch lines. There are three principle junctions and here may stand (in imposing black) the ample figure of The Fat Controller (the worthy Sir Topham Hatt). Engines may not go down the line blocked by The Fat Controller. However, a player whose engine lands on a yellow space (of which there are a number) must move The Fat Controller to another junction. Coming at a strategic moment this can send one's opponents off around a loop-line. There are also a number of spaces with special effects; 'Throw Again' and (very popular this one) 'Send any engine back to shed' are examples. Movement is regulated by a dice roll. Engines may pass each other but may not occupy the same space.<br/><br/>Undoubtedly a popular feature of Thomas the Tank Engine is the four little engine models executed in excellent detail in the predominant colour. The wheel arrangements are correct although it must be remarked that James The Red Engine (who is, you will remember, a Mixed Goods engine) lacks his tender. The four engines provided are Thomas, Percy, James and Toby, and the only complaint among my nephews was that there was no Gordon, Henry or Edward (I'm a Troublesome Truck man myself). Naturally I had to point out that the game board dipslayed Thomas' branch line, not the main line where extremely important engines would operate. I felt there was a ground swell here for an expansion kit.<br/><br/>Among its intended market the game is a great success but it is too simple other than for tinkering with by older gamers.

Play is split into 15 rounds, in each of which players campaign and fight elections. Seats won translate into victory points (necessary, because this is a game in which the parties are not of equal strength and so each has its own conversion rate), and at the end the player with the highest number of victory points wins. Each party has a percentage share of the vote. At the start these range from 44 for Fianna Fail down to 3 for the Independents, but these will fluctuate during the game as a result of electoral successes and failures and the campaigning attentions of one's opponents. Each 5 per cent, or part thereof, that you have at the start of a round entitles you either to draw a constituency card or to place a marker on the board. Owning a constituency card enables you to decide when the election will be called for the seat, and having a marker in the constituency is necessary if you are to take part when it is.<br/><br/>An election can not be called if a constituency contains fewer than 3 markers. Markers once played can be moved, and there is a limit to the number of markers that can be in a constituency at any one time (with a Civilization-style combat mechanism for removing any surplus). All of which makes for a lot of tactical jostling. When an election is called, players with markers in the constituency collect votes equal to 1d6 plus the number of their markers. An overall majority is needed for victory, and votes of less successful candidates are reallocated until this is achieved. Reallocation is done using a preference list mechanism, which again offers a lot of scope for tactical maneuver.<br/><br/>"}, "14406": {"boardgamedesigner": ["William Whyte"], "poll": [], "name": "Aras An Uachtaran", "playingtime": "90", "minplayers": "4", "boardgamemechanic": ["Area-Impulse", "Dice Rolling", "Set Collection"], "yearpublished": "1997", "usersrated": "2", "maxplayers": "6", "average": "6.25", "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["(Self-Published)"], "boardgameversion": ["First edition"], "maxplaytime": "90", "boardgamecategory": ["Political"], "age": "12", "minplaytime": "90", "description": "A self-published game that shares components with Dail Eireann, with both games being themed to Irish politics.<br/><br/>From the review by Stuart Dagger in Sumo Magazine:<br/><br/>Each player is a presidential candidate, with a playing piece that moves around the map picking up votes. Movement is by die roll. My first reaction when we started to play was that there was really nothing much to the game, but by the time we were a third of the way through, everyone was clearly having to think, I was enjoying myself and my opinion had been changed.<br/><br/>Three constituency cards are dealt face up by the board. The first candidate to visit the constituency collects the card and replaces it with another one from the deck. The object is to collect as many cards as you can and eventually an overall majority. Very much at the ``6 and up level so far. The fun again comes with the markers. When you collect a card you place one of your markers in the constituency, and on a turn when you fail to pick up a card you place one in a constituency of your choice. The effect of these is to slow down the movement of your rivals. The basic cost to move from one constituency to the next is one point from the die roll, but if you are trying to move into a constituency where some other player has more markers than you, you increase the cost by the number of markers you are behind the constituency leader.<br/><br/>So what starts as a level field soon develops some very adverse gradients, and regional fiefdoms begin to appear. If this were the only effect the markers had, the game would still be fairly straightforward, but it isn't. Once again, this is an Irish election, and a simple majority is not enough to become president; you need an overall one. So after all the cards have been picked up and a pecking order established on the first count, votes start being transferred. When a candidate is eliminated, the votes they had switch over on a constituency by constituency basis, going to whichever still active candidate has most markers in the constituency. The effect of this is that in the later stages of the game proper you have to start making choices. Do you place markers so as to impede your rivals, or do you start planning for the count? And if the latter, whose switches do you aim for? What looked easy at the start isn't any longer.<br/><br/>"}, "14407": {"boardgamedesigner": ["Ellis Simpson"], "poll": [], "name": "Fastcard Soccer", "playingtime": "10", "minplayers": "1", "boardgamemechanic": ["Area Movement", "Hand Management"], "yearpublished": "1997", "usersrated": "11", "boardgamefamily": ["Sports: Football / Soccer"], "maxplayers": "2", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic288857_t.jpg", "average": "7.59091", "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["The Select Game Company"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic288857.jpg", "boardgameversion": ["First edition"], "maxplaytime": "10", "boardgamecategory": ["Sports"], "age": "10", "minplaytime": "10", "description": "A representative of the 'replay' subgenre. Players run through a game of soccer using a deck of cards and a board, but have no actual control over the events in the basic game (though official variants included in the rule book *do* allow for choices on things like substitutions, making this a game)<br/><br/>From the review by Mike Siggins:<br/><br/>Ellis Simpson has been working on a soccer replay game for almost as long as I've known him. I think, having been privy to certain stages of its development, that the turning point came two years ago and Fastcard Soccer is the outcome. The resulting design emphasizes fast play (an admirable and difficult target), yet manages to retain many of the detailed trappings and flavour so important to the soccer fan. Well, this soccer game fan anyway. Like most replay games it is best enjoyed solitaire, but I have played some two-legged matches recently with a friend and these worked well enough. By way of a caution, please bear in mind throughout this review, as with Final Score, that I know next to nothing about football. What I feel I can comment upon is the atmosphere and game content of the system, and these are both first rate.<br/><br/>The system uses, predictably, a fast action card system that generates almost all of the action. Reference to charts is needed for goal attempts or unusual results (the infamous Z card effects) and the game status levels, essentially the team's overall ratings, are tracked on the pitch display using counters. The rest is a matter of choosing which teams you want to pair off, logging their ratings on the display, and playing the game.<br/><br/>The central structure, to a lazy bugger like me, seems like simplicity itself. Teams are rated for attack, defence and midfield. The latter ratings are compared to see which team wins possession and mounts an attack. A letter is read off, referenced to produce an attack number and then compared to the defence rating; if it is higher, the attack proceeds, if it is lower the attack breaks up, if equal there has been a clearance but the attacker retains possession. The whole setup runs on the highlight system by which, after each complete passage of play, a random number of minutes are marked off on the time display and the game runs through to 90 minutes, or longer if extra time is applicable. This method is now well established and it is an ingenious way of making sure that some ties have a lot of action and chances while other games are much like Arsenal at home to Arsenal. Game length will vary because of the use of highlights, but should take no more than a few minutes per match and it will get quicker as you become familiar with the card turning.<br/><br/>The big selling point for me is that the game features a commentary system that runs straight off the Fastcards themselves. As the attack builds up, you read a comment off the card that may go something like 'A flurry of passes wins a corner; a dipping cross into the box....'. The next card is flipped to reveal, say, 'A header from the back of the six yard box'. The header may go towards the corner of the goal, only to be saved spectacularly or any number of other possibilities. I may be a sucker for atmosphere, but at the speed this all runs (once you are used to the mechanics), it really conjures up the images for me. It is very much like watching the league goals on Match of the Day. Oddly, given one of my criticisms of Final Score, the speedy handling of this seems to negate the problem of not knowing who is on the ball. You can readily work out who has the goal attempt, but it doesn't seem to matter as much who brings the ball upfield.<br/><br/>The slight problem, and the only one in the game really, is that occasionally the commentary pairs don't seem to match up. Although this hasn't yet happened to me in about twenty games, other reviewers have mentioned it and I have seen it happen in the flesh. You might for instance get a header straight at the keeper, only to find him diving to get his fingertips to it. In this instance you can perhaps explain it away by a deflection or perhaps going the wrong way, but it does grate a little even for a man used to rationalising the weirdest German game systems. I can understand why this wasn't picked up (because of the large number of possible outcomes), but it must feel a little odd when it happens.<br/><br/>"}, "14409": {"boardgamedesigner": ["Michael Salmon"], "poll": [], "name": "Watch Out Wombat", "playingtime": "0", "minplayers": "2", "usersrated": "0", "yearpublished": "1987", "boardgameimplementation": ["Catch That Kiwi", "Catch that bunyip"], "boardgamefamily": ["Aliens"], "maxplayers": "6", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic59010_t.jpg", "average": "0", "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["Matchbox", "T M Promotions Pty Ltd Australia"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic59010.jpg", "maxplaytime": "0", "boardgamecategory": ["Animals", "Children's Game"], "age": "4", "minplaytime": "0", "description": "The object of the game  is for Wombats to reach the wombat burrow without getting caught and for Aliens to catch as many wombats as possible.<br/><br/>"}, "14410": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic70323.jpg", "poll": [], "boardgamedesigner": ["Matthew Nadelhaft"], "statistics": [], "yearpublished": "2002", "maxplayers": "4", "boardgameartist": ["Garry Haggerty"], "boardgamepublisher": ["(Self-Published)", "(Web published)"], "maxplaytime": "120", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic70323_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "120", "boardgamecategory": ["Economic", "Print & Play", "Science Fiction"], "description": "&ldquo;Oh No, There Goes Tokyo!&rdquo; is a multi-player combat game in which each of 2-4 players controls a segment of Tokyo under attack by the dreaded Godran, Self-Appointed Emperor of Monsters.

Each combination has both strengths and weaknesses. Additional expansion sets allow even more formations, objectives, and scenarios.<br/><br/>From the box:<br/><br/>In a different time, enemy warriors will do battle using strange and menacing weapons.

Players start off following some &quot;initial rule set&quot;, which dictates how the rules can be changed. Once a rule change has been made, players then follow this new rule set. Most importantly, the rules about how rule changes are made can themselves be changed!<br/><br/>In the words of Nomic's author, Peter Suber: &quot;Nomic is a game in which changing the rules is a move. In that respect it differs from almost every other game. The primary activity of Nomic is proposing changes in the rules, debating the wisdom of changing them in that way, voting on the changes, deciding what can and cannot be done afterwards, and doing it. Even this core of the game, of course, can be changed.&quot;<br/><br/>The game can be played face-to-face with as many written notes as are required, or through any of a number of Internet media.<br/><br/>Initially, gameplay occurs in clockwise order, with each player taking a turn. In that turn, they propose a change in rules that all the other players vote on, and then roll a die to determine the number of points they add to their score. If this rule change is passed, it comes into effect at the end of their round. Any rule can be changed with varying degrees of difficulty, including the core rules of the game itself. As such, the gameplay may quickly change.<br/><br/>Rules are divided up into two types: mutable and immutable. The main difference between these is that immutable rules must be changed into mutable rules (called transmuting) before they can be modified or removed. Immutable rules also take precedence over mutable ones. A rule change may be:<br/><br/>* the addition of a new mutable rule<br/>    * an amendment to a mutable rule<br/>    * the repeal of a mutable rule<br/>    * the transmutation of a rule from mutable to immutable<br/>    * or the transmutation of a rule from immutable to mutable<br/><br/>Alternative starting rulesets exist for Internet and mail games, wherein gameplay occurs in alphabetical order by surname, and points added to the score are based on the success of a proposed rule change rather than random dice rolls.<br/><br/>"}, "14452": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic434289.jpg", "poll": [], "boardgamedesigner": ["Dean Essig", "David A.

However, it has also been suggested that some versions of the Game featured generic/non-brand-name Troops clearly made with the same GIANT molds but not stamped with the GIANT logo. <br/><br/><br/>"}, "14484": {"boardgamedesigner": ["(Uncredited)"], "poll": [], "name": "Tank Trap", "playingtime": "20", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": ["Hex-and-Counter"], "yearpublished": "1967", "usersrated": "4", "maxplayers": "2", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic59245_t.jpg", "average": "3.25", "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["Helen of Toy"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic59245.jpg", "maxplaytime": "20", "boardgamecategory": ["World War II"], "age": "8", "minplaytime": "20", "description": "One of 9 games released by the Helen of Toy Game Company that graced many a comic book from the late 50's into the early 80's.

The puzzles are paintings of four different horses, with each in a similar setting, but in a different season.<br/><br/>The puzzle pieces are mixed and distributed facedown, with 40 pieces to each player. Each player sets up a partition to hide his pieces. The horse pictures are mixed facedown and one is dealt to each player. Each player places his picture in the holder slots of his partition; this is the puzzle that player must assemble.<br/><br/>To start the game, players turn over their pieces and begin assembling their puzzles. At any time and throughout the game, any player may offer to trade one to four puzzle pieces. When another player agrees to trade that number, they immediately trade those pieces facedown. At any time, a player may call out &ldquo;Hold Your Horses,&rdquo; and designate right, left, or across. All players must immediately pass one puzzle piece in the direction specified.<br/><br/>Trading continues until one player completes his puzzle. The game may be played by three players by removing one complete puzzle before beginning.<br/><br/>Note: This game was produced by the Springbok puzzle division of the Hallmark Card company. There is no date on either the box or the instruction sheet, so the production year is approximate. Naturally, there is no information regarding who designed the game.

New Amici has set as its goal to tune up people's often only limited knowledge of foreign languages, so that players can make new friends when on vacation abroad.<br/><br/>Up to four teams / solo players in two different nationalities take part, independent of language knowledge or age. By virtue of three difficulty levels, played in parallel, even novices can stand a chance against advanced speakers and learn the basics of the language along the way. The game works in two directions: people that normally speak German, for example, but wish to learn English can play the English-German version with English speakers who wish to learn German. Both profit from each other. But even players who all have the same mother tongue can play. The correct pronunciation of words in foreign languages is no problem, as New Amici uses a unique phonetic system that doesn't require any advance knowledge. Unlike the dictionaries, the words are spelled using 'normal' alphabet letters instead of phonetic symbols.<br/><br/>The goal of the game is to win cards over three rounds. This is accomplished by translating cards in both the mother tongue as well as the foreign language. Novices have to translate simple words, advanced players have to translate tougher cards. In addition to vocabulary know-how, New Amici also provides information about countries and peoples. In addition to words, sentences and idiomatic expressions, there are also cards with information about culture, business, as well as food and drink. The next rounds begins after seven cards have been won. The winner is the player who, in the finals, translates all of the played cards error-free.<br/><br/>The game has sold over 42,000 copies in Norway. In Germany, it is being distributed through toy stores, department stores, as well as book stores. Thus far, four versions are available for the suggested retail price of 39.90 Euros: German-English, German-French, German-Spanish, German-Italian.

The box is then turned around several times, so that nobody can remember exactly where each color of worm is located any more!

If it's the wrong one, then maybe he'll have better luck next time, once several worms have been discovered. The box is turned around at the end of each round, so players have to pay close attention to where the worms are! At the end of the game, once all cards have been assigned to their worms, each child gets to place a marker where they think a worm of the matching colour is located.

These and other design puzzles are solvable by only the most gifted designers.<br/><br/>Renowned Japanese wargame designer Tetsuya Nakamura has successfully met these challenges and Multi-Man Publishing is to offer the elegant result - Fire in the Sky. Fire in the Sky has, until now, only been available in Japanese.<br/><br/>With only one map and 180 counters, Fire in the Sky packs years of prior Pacific design attempts and experience into an effort that beautifully distills the essence of the conflict and serves as further proof that great things do indeed come in small packages. Fire in the Sky provides players with the same problems and perspectives faced by the historical combatants, yet does so in a game that can be played in 5 hours or less. The game is ingeniously balanced and so provides not only a look into the minds of the actual commanders, but also a fun, competitive and tense gaming experience.<br/><br/>The game includes glorious 1-inch counters, a clever map that integrates hexes and areas, and rules that cover all of the essential aspects of the Great Pacific War. Oil convoys and troop transports are as vital to victory as the massive Carrier fleets that steam over the vast Pacific.

Quite an ambitious undertaking for one game, yet Commands &amp; Colors by design is a unique historical game system which allows players to effectively portray stylized battles from this time in history. The 15 battles, showcased in the scenario booklet, although stylized, focus on important terrain features and the historical deployment of forces in scale with the game system. The battles include Bagradas, Cannae, and Zama.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;The scale of the game fluctuates from battle to battle. For some scenarios, an infantry unit may represent a legion of fighters, while in other scenarios a unit may represent just a few brave warriors. But the tactics you need to execute conform remarkably well to the advantages and limitations inherent to the various units, their weapons, terrain and time.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Unlike its older brother, Battle Cry by Avalon Hill (Hasbro), Commands &amp; Colors: Ancients is moderately more complex and contains additional historical details without the battlefield clutter.

There are (3) Scenarios presented, beginning the Game at either '1618', '1630', or even '1636'. Players will need to provide their OWN '6'-sided DIE, before commencing play.

The scale is given as '48'-kilometres across EACH 'Hex' and &quot;Yearly&quot; Game Turns.

War constantly flared between the Indian kingdoms, both against one another and against the British and French interlopers.

Over a dozen scenarios cover these wars, from Hyder Ali's defeat of the British in the First Mysore War in 1767 to Britain's final conquest of the Sikhs in 1846. Colorful leaders of the time are all present: Hyder Ali and Tippoo of Mysore. Sir Arthur Wellesley, the &quot;sepoy general&quot; who would become Duke of Wellington. The brilliant Madhav Rao of the Marathas. France's Admiral Suffren. Zaman Shah of Afghanistan, and the Sikh ruler Ranjit Singh. These and more lead your armies.<br/><br/>The playing pieces are the decadently thick tiles seen in Soldier Emperor and Granada: The Fall of Moslem Spain. Artist Terry Moore Strickland has gone well beyond those games; pieces like the Mysore Tiger Soldier or the Maratha War Elephant are tiny works of art.<br/><br/>As in Soldier Emperor, successful card play is a key to victory. Soldier Raj features high-quality playing cards, and includes a new deck of these for use in Soldier Emperor when playing the two games together.<br/><br/>Soldier Raj can also be played together with Soldier Emperor. Players can either add more seats at the table, or assign the Indian kingdoms to players with only European holdings. Britain becomes both more powerful in the combined game, and more vulnerable.<br/><br/>As in Soldier Emperor, players command their nation's military, political and economic destiny. The map is a painting of South Asia, with a network of areas and routes between them laid over it. Generals move their armies along these routes, attempting to conquer territory for their nation. Fleets control the seas around India; the locals have very little seapower, and Britain outnumbers France on the seas.<br/><br/>Combat is resolved by dice rolls, with larger armies casting more dice. Good generalship is even more crucial in India than in Europe.

Their brilliant investigations were conducted through art and polemic, manifesto and demonstration, love and politics. But most specially and remarkably, it was through games, play, techniques of surprise and methodologies of the fantastic that they subverted academic modes of inquiry, and undermined the complacent certainties of the reasonable and respectable. Playful procedures and systematic stratagems provided keys to unlock the door to the unconscious and to release the visual and verbal poetry of collective creativity.&quot;<br/><br/>A small format book details numerous games that involve automatism, simulation, role playing, story creation, randomness, and dadaist poetics.

There are 6 types of commodity spread across the 5 continents and players must control these to satisfy two different winning conditions. So to win, you might need to control two tractors and two factories for one condition, and one commodity in each continent for your second condition. Alternately, the first player to earn 1 million wins.<br/><br/>There are decks of cards; Country (which shows a commodity in a country and a price, e.g. Factories are in Britain and cost 70,000), Yes (good stuff), No (bad stuff), Auftrag (winning conditions). You start with some cash money, a few countries and two Auftrag. For the countries you own, you put the plastic commodity onto your colored disc onto the country. So the player owning Britain puts a factory on one of their discs onto Britain. This way, ownership can be seen and can change.<br/><br/>The game is driven by two dice. The player rolls them, chooses one for itself and the other for the player on the left to use. The dice are marked Buy, Sell, Country, Yes, No, Cash. Buy means you can buy a commodity/country from another player - regardless of whether they want to sell it - at the price on the card. There is also a red die you can roll to gamble on the price, making it higher or lower. Sell means you may sell a Country back to the bank. Country means you draw a Country card and place the commodity on your disc on it. Yes/No means you draw from the appropriate deck and apply the result, e.g. all players get a dividend, or pay a tax, etc. Cash means you move a marker on the board and whoever has that commodity or continent gets a bonus.<br/><br/>Since the game is completely driven by two dice, it is pure chance if a good thing or bad thing happens to a player. Due to the nature of the dice, the cards, and the rules, it is quite possible for the game to end in the first round. ...or it can go on forever.

A square, heavy cardboard base with raised frame allows specific battlefields to be composed from a set of 144 one-by-one-inch terrain tiles (using the backs for &quot;clear&quot; terrain), producing a square-grid map.  Terrain tile types include hill (white slope splashes on brown), wooded (white outlines of trees on green), swamp (green swamp grass humps on white), river (white waves on blue), fort (white squares on brown), city (white &quot;streets&quot; on brown), objective (star), and combinations of several of these types (such as city streets superimposed on brown-backed hill).<br/><br/>Scenario cards provide a summary of each battle, order of battle for each side, terrain diagram for board set-up, and initial deployment.  Several scenarios have special rules or late-appearing forces.<br/><br/>Combat units are 7/8&quot; square two-sided counters.  Full-strength side is a white silhouette (infantryman, rider, or cannon) on a dark blue (Continental) or bright red (British) background.  Also represented are French (lighter shade of blue) and Hessians (lighter shade of red).  The reverse side of each counter is a national-color silhouette on white, representing a reduced-strength unit.<br/><br/>Units are further differentiated into Regular, Light, and Grenadier Infantry, Artillery, or mounted Dragoons.  The counter mix includes includes eight Continental infantry units (all rated as Light), two Continental Dragoons and two Continental Artillery, plus two French Regulars, one French Light, one French Grenadier, one French Dragoon and one French Artillery.<br/><br/>On the side of the Crown are six British Regular, one British Light, one British Grenadier, two British Dragoon and two British Artillery units, plus two Hessian Regular, one Hessian Light, one Hessian Grenadier, one Hessian Dragoon and one Hessian Artillery.<br/><br/>Most battles feature from seven to ten units on a side.  From battle to battle, unit scale, obviously abstracted, varies from one regiment to a division each.  The overall composition of each army in a scenario, however, strives to represent the historic proportions present at that action.<br/><br/>Unit scale, combined with the grid scale of each battlefield, allows great variety in approach and many options for force allocation and maneuver.<br/><br/>Movement is Igo-Ugo with a twist.  Movement is regulated by the draw of one card each turn by each player.  Cards are pre-cut, about three by two inches, glossy red on the back with a red number on the face.  The number on each card (from one to ten) indicates the total number of movement points that may be expended by the owner's side that turn.  There are a total of forty cards, one for each turn in a scenario.  When the cards are all used, the scenario is ended.<br/><br/>Movement points may be divided among the owning player's units in any manner desired.  One unit might move ten spaces through clear terrain, or multiple units may be moved in any desired order, so long as the maximum number of moves for that turn (defined by the card drawn) is not exceeded.  Friendly units may move through one another, but no stacking is permitted at turn's end.<br/><br/>Rules (which only total four pates) are divided into &quot;Basic&quot; and &quot;Advanced.&quot;  In the Basic Game, Swamps stop movement and rivers may only be crossed at diagonal bends between river squares (representing &quot;fords&quot; or &quot;bridges&quot;).  No diagonal movement is permitted except for such river crossings.<br/><br/>In the Advanced Game, terrain becomes more restrictive; Artillery, for example, may not enter Forest or Swamp squares.  Dragoons and Light Infantry units may move diagonally--a significant advantage.  Dragoons, if chosen for movement,  may also move two squares for each &quot;turn movement point&quot; allowed on the movement card for that turn.  Advanced Rules also provide for defensive benefits in fort, city or hill terrain, a quality advantage for Grenadiers, new rules for retreats, and Bayonet Attacks--costly but devastating if successful.<br/><br/>Units adjacent to enemy units at turn's end will receive defensive fire (roll one or two on a D6 for a hit).  Units are flipped on the first hit, eliminated on the second.  Attacking units which receive a first hit are retreated one space.  Surviving friendly units will then attack an adjacent enemy unit by the same method.<br/><br/>Victory is determined by points scored.  Two points are scored for each &quot;objective square&quot; occupied by a friendly unit at game's end, and one point for each enemy unit eliminated.  Given the area represented by each battlefield map, players usually have a choice between driving for geographical objectives and destroying enemy forces.  However, troop resources are finite and a reverse often compels a change in plan.<br/><br/>Although &quot;George Washington's Campaigns&quot; might more accurately be titled &quot;Battles of George Washington,&quot; a campaign game rule provides for a victory based on accrued points from multiple battle scenarios.  Since each scenario plays fast--rarely more than an hour--this is a viable approach to the game.<br/><br/>The game is free of ambiguity and errors, provides a fine vehicle for introducing new gamers to the hobby, and provides a fast but entertaining and balanced puzzle for the more experienced.  Almost thirty years later, it is notable for its clean rules, accessibility, and replayability.  Until the recent appearance of Decision Games' American Revolution series, it also provided the only published Long Island scenario in the gaming world.<br/><br/>This game was evidently produced with the U.S. Bicentennial (1976).  The number of copies printed is unknown; this game was found in the early 1980's at a shop in Alexandria, Va.  The box is approximately 16 x 14 by 1 1/2 inches in size, white background with a large blue drawing of Washington and his staff mounted on a hil, with red, white and blue letters in the lower right proclaiming the title.  Included is a cardboard insert providing a tray for pieces and printed examples of play.<br/><br/>"}, "14269": {"boardgamedesigner": ["Giorgio Cremese"], "poll": [], "name": "Giochiamo con la Barcolana", "playingtime": "60", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": ["Dice Rolling", "Point to Point Movement", "Simulation"], "yearpublished": "2004", "usersrated": "1", "boardgamefamily": ["Sports: Sailing"], "maxplayers": "8", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic132647_t.jpg", "average": "5", "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["Giorgio Cremese"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic132647.jpg", "maxplaytime": "60", "boardgamecategory": ["Nautical", "Racing", "Sports"], "age": "10", "minplaytime": "60", "description": "It is set in Trieste, Northern Italy during the Barcolana Regatta, which takes place every year in October.

The board is a striking 8x8 grid of large coloured squares. These alternate, with one row being green and yellow, the next red and blue. The effect of this was illustrated by Alastair (age 1) sobbing his heart out when I wouldn't let him play on it. The plastic pieces comprise circular bases, from which a stem protrudes, and large numbers of coloured 'polo shaped' rings. The object of the game is to be the survivor.<br/><br/>The initial set up is achieved by the players alternately placing one of their pieces on the board, at the same time dropping a coloured ring onto the stem. The basic principle is that the uppermost ring will always be the same colour as the square the piece occupies. This continues until all have been placed; ten each if two player, otherwise eight.<br/><br/>Player turns then continue, with one piece being moved each turn. This may be done in one of two ways: by moving one square and adding a ring or by removing rings and moving up to three squares. The former option is the standard move, and in this way stacks of up to four rings may be built up. Each time the colour ring selected matches the square moved to. The latter option is generally an attacking move. The top ring is removed, and the ring thus revealed shows the colour square which is then moved to. This process may be continued, until only one is left, at which point the move must stop as the last ring may never be removed. Any enemy pieces encountered during this move are eliminated from play. It is theoretically possible to capture three enemy pieces in one turn.<br/><br/>"}, "14310": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic58158.jpg", "poll": [], "boardgamedesigner": ["(Uncredited)"], "statistics": [], "yearpublished": "1985", "maxplayers": "4", "age": "8", "boardgamepublisher": ["Milton Bradley"], "maxplaytime": "45", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic58158_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "45", "boardgamecategory": ["Fighting", "Movies / TV / Radio theme", "Sports"], "description": "Players must win two matches with two different WWF stars.

Seems complicated.<br/>Lots of different dice, coloured counters etc <br/>Basic Rules for 2 players<br/>Players will be called Captains. The toss of a coin will determine who will elect to bat or bowl first. You are now in a position to set up the board to commence play as outlined in Diagram 1. The bowling captain selects any one of his five bowlers and places him at either end of the pitch in the position marked &quot;bowler&quot;. The batting captain selects any two of his eleven batsmen and places one on the pitch as &quot;striker&quot; and the other as &quot;non-striker&quot;. The striker is placed on the opposite end of the pitch to the bowler.<br/>CRITICAL ASPECTS OF PLAY TO REMEMBER a)Study the layout of the board prior to commencement of play<br/>b) The bowling captain moves the yellow deliveries counter prior to each delivery. c) The bowling area must be cleared before casting of the dice. d) The batsmen in play must change ends on the scoring of one or three runs. e) It is the bowling captain's responsibility to complete the scoresheet. f) The batting captain is responsible for recording his batsmen's runs on the individual batsman's scoreboard. Extras are recorded by the bowler on the scoresheet. g) The three blue dice i.e. bye, wide and runout, once selected must be cast with the umpire dice. h) Once a batsman is dismissed the batting captain must advise the bowling captain of the runs scored before removing scoring counters from the individual batsmen's scoreboard. i) If a game is shortened to a lesser number of overs than fifty, it is essential that all five bowlers bowl the same number of overs each. DISMISSALS Batsmen can be dismissed in four ways: 1. Bowled 2. Caught 3. L.B.W 4.

If a player&rsquo;s Main Figure is removed from the board, all of his/her figures are removed from this game.<br/><br/>Gaming concept:<br/>The game play is based on rounds taking place after each other. A round is divided into 3 phases. In the 1st phase of all round, the players makes their movements with the figures, using the points available to them on the fields. After this the game proceeds to the 2nd phase, in which some of the hex-fields produces points available to be used in the next round. In the 3rd phase the battles takes place on fields occupied by more players. As a result of battle the field becomes the territory of the player with more figures standing on it, or in case of a draw, the field&rsquo;s ownership stays unclear causing this field not to produce points in the next round.<br/><br/>After all have been done, a new round begins, and the game goes on like this round by round.<br/><br/>More information can be found here:<br/><a target='_blank' href='http://www.hextri.hu' rel='nofollow'>http://www.hextri.hu</a><br/><br/>"}}
