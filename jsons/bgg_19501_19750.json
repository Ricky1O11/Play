It features all the units, from Morgan's Rifles to the British grenadiers, and all the dense, wooded terrain you would normally expect, but in a way you've probably not seen before.<br/><br/>The game uses two decks of cards, one deck for each player to drive the game. Each player gets a certain number of his cards each turn, never his full deck, and his allotment is usually different (in terms of number and type) from his opponent. The cards are used to determine movement, combat, and special items, such as Indian Stealth, Counter-Attack, Rifle Fire, and Rapid Movement, among others. Players may play as many cards as they wish when it's their turn, using each card for only one of the possible three purposes. Play passes back and forth between players, until both players have used all their cards &hellip; and the Turn is over.<br/><br/>Turning Point is thus a game of card play and management, which unfolds on the map of Freeman's Farm, which uses squares, rather than hexes,. You're still moving units, trying to outflank, attacking with what you hope are better odds (since you don't know what cards your opponent will play, if any, and you never know what his final strength will be), and using your cards, and wits, to outplay your opponent.<br/><br/>Turning Point was a nominee in the Charles S.

The first player to reach the end of the score track wins.<br/><br/>The heart of the game is a &quot;push your luck&quot; dice mechanism to advance on the challenge board.  A player begins by rolling five dice, setting aside ones.  Other numbers can be used to advance a pawn along one of five columns, representing Looks, Faces, Tickles, Ouchies, and Teases.  After each roll, you can either stop or keep rolling.  If you stop and your pawn is the most advanced pawn in that column, then you remove any pawn it passed.  If it is not the most advanced, then you remove your pawn from the challenge board.  If your pawn has not been removed from the board by your next turn, then you score points for it on the score track.<br/><br/>You can keep rolling dice to advance your pawn farther up the challenge board, but when you accumulate three or more ones, your parents have caught you picking on your sibling.

Each turn, the player rolls a pair of dice. That player will then choose 2 out of the 3 options to perform, and allocates one of the rolled dice to each of those options. The options are:<br/><br/>Option 1: The player turns tile face up from a face down stack, until the number of face up tiles matches the number on the chosen die.<br/><br/>Option 2: The player chooses the number of tiles indicated by the die, and adds those tiles to their existing maze.<br/><br/>Option 3: The player advances their pawn through their maze as many squares (there are 2 squares per tile) as the die indicates.<br/><br/>The tiles have various configurations of bold lines around certain edges, indicating walls of the maze. When the maze is completed, it must be fully enclosed by the border, and all squares must be reachable by the pawn.<br/><br/>The round ends when a player has completed their maze and has moved the pawn from the Start to the Finish, entering Finish with an exact die roll.

The players have the option to place a Daily Double bet, which in this game is betting that the player's own horse will win the first two races. The players, one at a time, play a movement card.  Most of the movement cards specify a number of spaces to move the player's horse pawn. Some of the movement cards state, &quot;Ask Jockey&quot;.  &quot;Ask Jockey&quot; means that the player turns over the top card of the &quot;Ask Jockey&quot; deck.  The Ask Jockey cards are marked on their backs with a blue dot if the card has advantages for the player, red dot for disadvantages for the player, question marks ?? for instructions that may or may not affect the player that plays it.  Holding an Ask Jockey card until that deck has a card with a blue dot on top is ideal. After the players have put into play and discarded all of the cards dealt, the entire movement deck is shuffled and four more cards are dealt to each player. &quot;Ask Jockey&quot; cards can require a player to give a number of his movement cards to another player or just discard them without using them.  Therefore, players may use more or less than four movement cards per hand dealt. After the second race is complete, the Program cards are shuffled and dealt for each race.  The race track board is proportionally marked for all of the common lengths of horse races.  A game is complete after an agreed upon number of races and the instructions recommend 8 races.

Formally played by women, today both men and women of all ages enjoy the excitement of C&eacute;exstem. The goal of the game is to see who can reach the agreed upon point total first. Any number of individuals can play at one time. The game is a wonderful way to learn the number system of the Nim&iacute;ipuu, counting from n&aacute;aqc (one) to le'dptit (twenty), and have a lot of fun doing so!<br/><br/>To play the game, you need two sets of game sticks, each set colored a different color, e.g., blue and red, and each set marked indicating a &aacute;ayet (male) and hamma (female), a &quot;couple.&quot; The male stick is often marked with an extra perpendicular line across it. The reverse side of a stick is called, caya, &quot;nothing.&quot;<br/><br/>Before starting the players agree upon the number of points to win, the higher the number, the more challenging and the more fun. Typically, 5, 7 or 11 point totals are selected. Usually starting with the youngest player and proceeding to that person's right, each person throws the four game sticks onto the rug before them. Depending on how the sticks land, the following points are possible.<br/><br/>* one &quot;couple,&quot; a &aacute;ayet and a hamma of the same color = one point<br/><br/>* two &quot;couples,&quot; both sets of &aacute;ayet and a hamma sticks = three points<br/><br/>* one &aacute;ayet and two hamma = two points. This combination refers to the Nim&iacute;ipuu practice of looking after a male friend's wife should he fall in combat.<br/><br/>* if there are no pairs matched, e.g., &aacute;ayet and a hamma of differing colors = no points<br/><br/>* but if all the sticks land caya, &quot;nothing&quot; = all points accumulated are lost and the player starts over.<br/><br/>After deciding on the win point total, be it 5, 7, or 11, the players need to agree on other rules. Will you need to win on the exact number, be it 5, 7 or 11, not going over that total? If a player gains points beyond the agreed upon win point total, will extra points over that total be subtracted from that player's earned points? As players gain points, they should always announce their totals in Nim&iacute;ipuutimptneewit.<br/><br/>Nim&iacute;ipuutimptneewit numbers:<br/><br/><br/>     n&aacute;aqc - one<br/>     lep&iacute;t - two<br/>     mit&aacute;at - three<br/>     p&iacute;ilept - four<br/>     p&aacute;axat - five<br/>     'oyl&aacute;aqc - six<br/>     'uyn&eacute;ept - seven<br/>     'oym&aacute;tat - eight<br/>     kuyc - nine<br/>     p&uacute;utimt - ten<br/>     p&uacute;utimt wax n&aacute;aqc - eleven (ten and one)<br/>     p&uacute;utimt wax lep&iacute;t - twelve (ten and two)<br/>     le'eptit - twenty<br/><br/><br/>"}, "19621": {"boardgamedesigner": {"3": {"name": "(Uncredited)"}}, "poll": {}, "name": "Mental Floss Game", "playingtime": "0", "minplayers": "4", "boardgamemechanic": {"2035": "Roll / Spin and Move"}, "yearpublished": "2005", "usersrated": "70", "maxplayers": "6", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic94295_t.jpg", "average": "5.30143", "statistics": {}, "boardgamepublisher": {"115": {"name": "Pressman Toy Corp."}}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic94295.jpg", "boardgameversion": {"28139": "Pressman edition"}, "maxplaytime": "0", "boardgamecategory": {"1030": {"name": "Party Game"}}, "age": "16", "minplaytime": "0", "description": "Developed in partnership with mental_floss magazine is a quick and quirky trivia game that you brainiacs will be sure to enjoy.

Fortunately, a mounted die-cut set of counters was available for like $1 additional, so we were spared the nightmare of trying to hand-mount two-sided counters &lt;shudder&gt;.<br/><br/>The Mapsheet consists of four sections (mine are hand-glued into one map) showing the island of Sicily, in light and dark blue and light and dark brown on white paper, 19&quot; x 27&quot; assembled. The Combat Results table (from 1-4 to 7-1), Terrain Effects chart (six types), Time Record track (12 four-day turns), Unit Designations Within Divisions chart (initial Axis), German Order Of Battle chart (reinforcements and &quot;What If?&quot; units), and Allied Order of Battle chart (initial and reinforcements) are all printed on the mapsheet. The starting Axis locations for the historical scenario are printed on the map, as are the historical and alternate Allied landing sites.<br/><br/>The Rulebook assembles into 8 pages. Front is picture, title and credits. Second page is historical info (&quot;Introduction&quot;). The next four pages are rules and victory conditions. Then 1/2-page of (six) alternate scenarios, 1/2 page of designer's notes, and 1/2-page of bibliography (on the last page, with instructions for assembling the mapsheet).<br/><br/>Units are mostly regiments and brigades (or similarly-sized kampfgruppen), with some battalions, some Italian divisions, and an Army HQ for each army (4). There are 120 of the 1/2&quot; counters -- 22 Americans (olive green, 3 are battalions, 1 is Army HQ), 18 British and Canadians (dark olive green, 1 is Army HQ), 39 Italians (yellow, 3 are divisions, 11 are battalions, 1 is Army HQ), 25 Germans (tan, 1 battalion, 1 Army HQ), and 16 blanks, some of each color. The mounted counters are unique in that the full-strength side is printed on what is normally considered the back of the counter. While it doesn't look as nice, it does actually facilitate handling the counters - they are easier to pick up. Another idea that never caught on.<br/><br/>This is not a complex game, more along the lines of the old Conflict games. The game sequence is 1. Allied airdrops; 2. Allies move; 3. Allied combat and post-combat moves; 4. Axis airdrops; 5. Axis moves; 6. Axis combat and post-combat moves. ZOCs are fluid for movement and rigid for combat. Combat is odds-based, with step losses, retreats and advances indicated for both attacker and defender. For example, at 1-1 odds, the results are: 1. Att 1 step retr 1, Def adv 1; 2. Att 2 steps retr 2, Def adv 1; 3. Att 1 step, Def 1 step retr 1; 4. no effect; 5. Def retr 1; 6. Def 1 step, retr 2. Stacking is 3 regt/brig. Rules for invasions, airdrops, supply, evacuations, and naval support fire are all simple and non-cluttered.<br/><br/>One interesting aspect is Italian desertion. On turn one, the Axis player must roll for every Italian non-infantry unit, losing it to desertion on a 3-6 on 1D6. The Italian infantry are sturdier, and will not desert unless attacked at 3-1 or more with no German unit within three hexes.<br/><br/>Victory conditions are based on three elements: Italian desertion, casualties, and cities held. Levels of victory are: Axis wins if he has more than 3/4 of Allied points, decisively if equal or more; game is drawn if Axis has less than 3/4 but at least 2/3 of Allies points; otherwise Allies win. Also, the Axis win immediately if they destroy both the US 7th Army and UK 8th Army HQs (not bloody likely).<br/><br/>I can't believe no one ever listed this game before. It is one of my all-time favorites.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": {"222588": "Ziploc Edition"}, "name": "The Invasion of Sicily", "playingtime": "60", "boardgamemechanic": {"2026": "Hex-and-Counter"}, "average": "6.9", "usersrated": "5", "boardgamesubdomain": {"4664": "Wargames"}, "boardgamefamily": {"27534": "Islands: Sicily"}}, "19633": {"boardgamedesigner": {"2805": {"name": "Lutz Stepponat"}}, "average": "3.9697", "poll": {}, "name": "Gefangen in der Geisterbahn", "playingtime": "60", "minplayers": "3", "yearpublished": "2005", "usersrated": "33", "boardgamefamily": {"7479": "Ghosts"}, "maxplayers": "5", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic169474_t.jpg", "boardgameartist": {"12011": "Eckhard Freytag"}, "statistics": {}, "boardgamepublisher": {"39": {"name": "Pegasus Spiele"}}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic169474.jpg", "boardgameversion": {"102595": "First edition"}, "maxplaytime": "60", "boardgamecategory": {"1024": {"name": "Horror"}}, "age": "12", "minplaytime": "60", "description": "Directly translated &quot;Trapped in the ghost train&quot;<br/><br/>A new horror-themed game from the author of &quot;Return of the Heroes&quot;.

In turn order, cards are played out and the values added together or subtracted: 24&hellip;29&hellip;32&hellip;25&hellip; but beware: if you say a number that someone has in hand, then you&rsquo;ve put your foot in it. Those with a talent for this will learn how to ship a Fettnapf around and win the game.<br/><br/>Each player receives 3 cards (valued 0 to 9) and an island card (10 to 30). In turn order, each player plays a card and draws a new one into his hand. The played-out cards get added (up to 30) or subtracted (down to 10) and announced out loud: 24-28-32-26-18-9-12. Whenever a player goes over the limit, the right-hand player gets an island card. When a player announces a number that another player has in hand as an island card, then he&rsquo;s put his foot in it and receives a Fettnapf card. The game ends when a player has collected 4 Fettnapf cards.

Standing atop the Hill of Tara and contemplating the conjoined ringforts of Forradh and Teach Chormac, the games of Sacred Hill and High Kings of Tara were born.  Steeped in the ancient legends of Ireland&rsquo;s Celtic heritage and royal past, these unique games of pure strategy are appreciated by young and old alike.<br/><br/>Tailten Games won the Games Magazine award for BEST ABSTRACT GAME 2006; the  Spiele f&uuml;r Zwei - Spiele Akademie 2005 (Austria); Index 100 - Showcase 2005 in Ireland; and the award for 'Best Irish-Style Traditional Gift' 2005 in Ireland for Project Kells.<br/><br/>According to the designer, Murray Heasman,&quot;The game takes five minutes to learn, yet a lifetime to master.&quot; The sheer beauty of this game alone makes it a gift to treasure--but the three separate games  each pose a daunting task for any strategic or abstract gamer.<br/><br/>In all there are eight variants to stimulate the mind, so take it to your own level.  From a more simple Sacred Hill, a go-like game with its' elemental challenges, to an all-out-brain-burner in the form of Poisoned Chalice... Project Kells combines the best of beauty, gameplay, theme, and replay value.<br/><br/>You&rsquo;ll be amazed at the possibilities.  Once you&rsquo;ve learned the basics, be prepared to delve deeper, because you&rsquo;re likely to be already hooked on this game.  Scoring with knots (instead of kingdoms) will get you addicted.<br/><br/><br/>     This first game: Sacred Hill introduces the basic elements of play.  The aim of both games is the same -- to have the least number of kingdoms by the time the game is ended, a kingdom being a group of linked ring forts.  There are two phases to the game.  In manoeuvres (first phase) you are building a network of unconnected ring forts scattered around the board.  In Battle (second phase) you are adding ring forts next to your own, linking them together with bridge tiles, to form larger (and fewer) kingdoms.  This starts to magically create the Celtic knotwork.  Isolated ring forts that are besieged must be captured.  No ties are possible with either ringfort scoring or knot scoring.===<br/>     The second game:  High Kings of Tara introduces the kings.  Each player has three which do the work of building your ring forts. They move like the knight in chess and add many more twists and turns to the game, taking it to another dimension.  Kings can capture enemy ring forts and kings; they can also be immobilized.  Your own kings cannot work in tandem and they must always move to a vacant hill whenever possible.  Ties are possible, but the duality of scoring pursuits (ringforts versus captured kings) usually prevents this possibility.  This is especially true in tournament scoring...<br/><br/><br/><br/>    Those who feel that they have mastered those variants are encouraged to try the real brain burner of the bunch.  Poisoned Chalice  Played at right angles to each other, each player tries to exert total control over each other from a position of inferiority. The end scoring is the same as in the Sacred Hill variant, but in this endeavor the limitations of placement create challenging strategic obstacles for both opponents.  It is possible to exert control over an opponent in such a way that at times they are limited to one possibility for tile placement.  However, there are twists that occur if a piece is captured (surrounded) on the board (like in 'go').  No ties are possible with either ringfort scoring or knot scoring.<br/><br/><br/>This is very probably the same game [system] as The High Kings of Tara.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": {"270732": "English Collectors edition"}, "name": "Project Kells: Sacred Hill, High Kings of Tara  & Poisoned Chalice", "playingtime": "30", "boardgamemechanic": {"2048": "Pattern Building"}, "age": "8", "usersrated": "229", "boardgamesubdomain": {"4666": "Abstract Games"}, "average": "6.25838"}, "19666": {"boardgamedesigner": {"5936": {"name": "Jim Gladstone"}}, "poll": {}, "name": "Gladstone's Games to Go", "playingtime": "10", "minplayers": "1", "boardgamemechanic": {"2047": "Memory"}, "yearpublished": "2004", "usersrated": "16", "boardgamesubdomain": {"4666": "Abstract Games"}, "maxplayers": "10", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic297348_t.jpg", "average": "6.80625", "statistics": {}, "boardgamepublisher": {"4512": {"name": "Quirk Books"}}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic297348.jpg", "boardgameversion": {"319284": "First edition"}, "maxplaytime": "10", "boardgamecategory": {"1009": {"name": "Abstract Strategy"}}, "age": "10", "minplaytime": "10", "description": "Gladstone's Games to Go describes over 45 games, none requiring any special equipment beyond paper, pencils, and coins.

Clubs count as negative points, and diamonds require another card to be drawn for that column. The object of the game is not to simply win more cards, but to win &quot;point cards&quot;. Point cards start with the Aces, then move to Kings when all of the Aces are claimed, and so on. Play is continued until all points are claimed through a pre-agreed goal (for example, if playing to Queens, then the game will end when all Aces, Kings, and Queens are claimed). The player with the most point cards wins.

Movement and orientation are kept track of in three dimensions using a simple and intuitive (math-less) method of dealing with line of sight, along with easily understood indicators on the ship control sheets. Range determination is performed simply by measuring distance with a tape measure and checking a chart, to take into account altitude.<br/><br/>Damage is tracked through a common damage-box method with damageable systems individually represented, along with hit location charts on the ship control sheets. Weapon information is likewise available on the ship control sheets.<br/><br/>Aside from the 3D aspects of the game, here are some features in development which are not commonly found in starship combat games:<br/><br/>Computer Warfare - the ability for ships to infect enemy vessels with computer viruses, jam missile guidance systems, or even steal control of enemy weapons or systems.<br/><br/>Crew Levels - A ship may drop out of a fight if it takes too many losses to its crew.<br/><br/>Damage Control - Ships can make limited battlefield repairs, things like bringing a damaged weapon back online or getting a thruster to work again.<br/><br/>Fires - Ships can catch fire, fires can spread, and crew members can be sacrificed when fires are vented to space.<br/><br/>Fuel and cargo - Makes for a wider range of possible scenarios as well as a seamless tie-in to campaign games.<br/><br/>Adaptable Game System - While the game will provide its own exciting universe, from the ground up it is being designed with the intent that others can adapt it to their favorite universe with relative ease. Having this foundation will also give the game and its setting the ability to grow without the system falling apart or failing in some regard.<br/><br/>WHI will be consistent and predictable with its ability to simulate movement in space, but it will not be a rigid simulation or necessarily be mathmatically accurate. It will be relatively quick and easy to play but will not be simplistic. It will have a lot of detail suitable for a wide range of battle sizes as well as adaptation to other gaming applications (roleplaying, campaigns, etc), but will avoid being tedious or micromanagerial.<br/><br/>The goal is for the game to be fun to play, first and foremost.<br/><br/>"}, "19723": {"boardgamedesigner": {"5951": {"name": "Matthias Hunstig"}}, "poll": {}, "name": "Bellum Numerorum", "playingtime": "30", "minplayers": "2", "yearpublished": "2002", "usersrated": "0", "boardgamesubdomain": {"4666": "Abstract Games"}, "maxplayers": "2", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic312457_t.jpg", "average": "0", "statistics": {}, "boardgamepublisher": {"4531": {"name": "Schloss-Spiele"}}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic312457.jpg", "boardgameversion": {"319002": "First edition"}, "maxplaytime": "30", "boardgamecategory": {"1009": {"name": "Abstract Strategy"}}, "age": "0", "minplaytime": "30", "description": "Bellum Numerorum is a abstract tactical boardgame for 2 players.
