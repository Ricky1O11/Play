The counters representing the sorcerers and their minions are then placed on the board, and on the sorcerer player's first turn they can begin summoning other evil units. The wizard player brings in the wizard units and their allies through one or more hexes along the valley border, and the struggle begins.<br/><br/>Each side can attack with spells and by physical combat. The wizard player should usually try to strike quickly, before the sorcerer player can organize an effective resistance. Only the sorcerer player gets a steady stream of reinforcements, in the form of wandering-orc counters, but the wizard player has the advantage of special attacking bonuses.

Many boxed versions with suggestions and timers are available, and several TV shows have been made using the basic idea of the game.<br/><br/>In most versions, one player silently acts out a title (book, movie, show, etc.), phrase or person and their team must guess it. The words can be from a commercially made list or just creatively made up by the players. Many signals and conventions have become traditional (see link below). The experience is usually humorous, whether you are strenuously flapping away like a buzzard - alternating with pretending to push a buzzer and lying dead on the floor - for several minutes while your team guesses everything but buzzard (&quot;bird!&quot; &quot;scavenger!&quot; &quot;bird of prey!!&quot; &quot;raptor?&quot;) or frantically struggling to think up clever clues. Many of the clues use the &quot;sounds like&quot; hint - pretending to sew for the word &quot;so,&quot; for example. The excitement and frustration of piecing together the clues and guessing is also a great part of the fun, of course, and the relief is immense for both the actor and the guessing team when the guess is finally (or miraculously suddenly) correct.

If a boat is captured by the pirates, the players have a chance to rescue the prisoners... at the cost of valuable time and supplies.<br/><br/>This cooperative game is played on a board which shows the route from Adventure Island back to the player's home town. Each player starts with a boat on Adventure Island, and two pirate ships are placed along the route. The game is played in turns. Each turn, a player rolls two dice, then choses one die to use for his own boat and one die to use for one of the pirate ships. Both are moved as many places forward as the selected die shows. At certain points, the player can have his ship take a hidden route, which is not used by the pirate ships.<br/><br/>If a pirate ship passes a boat, or if a boat passes a pirate ship, the boat is captured and placed on Pirates' Island. Other boats can free it if they manage to land on one of the rescue spaces on the track; the rescued boat is then returned to that same space.<br/><br/>When all boats have reached the home town, the players have won the game. However, if some ships are captured while all other ships have reached the home town, the players lose.<br/><br/>The difficulty level can be increased by giving each player two or three boats instead of one. The greatest challenge is the Grand Adventure, in which each player has three boats, there is a third pirate ship, and each player may hide on the hidden routes at most five turns during the game.<br/><br/>The 2011 AMIGO edition is part of its &quot;&Ouml;kologisch + Kooperativ&quot; (Ecological &amp; Cooperative) line of games.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": ["Asmodee Dutch/French edition", "German third edition", "Multilingual first edition", "Multilingual second edition with \"Sonderpreis Kinderspiel\" badge"], "name": "Piraten-Abenteuer", "playingtime": "20", "boardgamemechanic": ["Co-operative Play", "Roll / Spin and Move"], "age": "4", "usersrated": "64", "boardgamesubdomain": ["Children's Games"], "average": "6.29375"}, "5137": {"boardgamedesigner": ["Darwin Bromley", "Laird A.

The pieces in the game represent the actual military units that took part in the historical conflict. The large numbers on the pieces indicate the relative strength of these units. Each Player maneuvers his pieces on the map to engage those of the enemy. Battles take place when units are adjacent to enemy units. The total relative strengths of the involved units are compared. The attacking Player consults a simple probability table (the Combat Results Table) to determine the outcome of each battle. First one Player moves his units and conducts attacks, and then the other. The game proceeds this way (for a specified number of turns) as the Players try to achieve the historical objectives set forth in the rules. The final outcome of the game can be very different from the actual historical result.

You can play it simply as a two-player ship-to-ship combat game, using either basic or advanced combat rules.  The advanced rules use a system reminiscent of Ace of Aces to track your opponent's sailing ship (and the wind) relative to your ship.  The basic game is much simpler, just keeping track of your hull points, guns, sails, and boarders.  (Boarding rules are similar to Battle Chips from Tim's Games.)<br/><br/>The campaign game can be played by four players - more if you photocopy player mats and don't mind people doubling up on roles.  With four, each person takes one of four roles: pirate, British privateer, merchant, Spanish galleoneer.  Each has different goals to win the game.  There is a simple map of the Caribbean with six ports (some British, some Spanish, some neutral, some cities, some towns, some villages) and two different sea zones.  You simultaneously select your destinations and reveal (you can't go directly from port to port - you must first go to one of the sea zones).  If you're in the same area as another player, there may be combat - use either basic or advanced ship-to-ship combat as described above.  Once that's resolved, roll on the encounter tables, modifying the result depending on if a port is hostile or friendly or neutral to you.  After resolving events and encounters on the tables, you may trade if in port.<br/><br/>Goals involve varying quantities booty, supplies, medals and legends.

You own a castle by encircling it (as closely as possible).  You control territory by encircling it.

Included are cards for 50 men and 50 women professionals. Each card has a column for &quot;Serve&quot;, &quot;Serve Return&quot;, &quot;Volley&quot; and &quot;Special&quot;. Play consists of rolling dice (two white dice, plus a red die that isn't added to the others but sometimes changes the outcome) and cross-indexing the number rolled with the proper column. The result will be a point for one of the players or an instruction to roll next in one of the other columns. Once in a while, a player gets to make a choice that varies a column's results, and random events, such as stomach cramps, broken rackets, arguments with the umpire and thunderstorms, are possible.<br/><br/>To take an example, Connors is pitted against McEnroe. Connors has the serve. He rolls 1, 5 (white) and 3 (red). The dice roll is 15 (read the dice as digits, low roll first); the red is ignored unless it's a 5 or 6. A 15 in Connors' Serve column is &quot;I&quot;, which means that McEnroe can return the serve. He rolls 2, 2 (white) and 1 (red) - a 22, which yields a &quot;V&quot; in his Serve Return column. Connors must now roll against his Volley column. He gets 4, 6 (white) and 5 (red). Ordinarily, a 46 would be a point for him, but the red 5 allows McEnroe to make a clutch return. He rolls the white dice (only). A score equal to or less than his Clutch Value is a V result; anything higher loses the point. McEnroe's Clutch Rating is 33. He rolls a 3 and a 6 - not good enough, and Connors is ahead 15-love.<br/><br/>Connors serves again: 4, 6 (white) and 5 (red). An ace for Connors; McEnroe doesn't even get a clutch return. 30-love.<br/><br/>The next Connors serve: 2, 2 (white) and 2 (red). Triples generate a random event. (Many players think that random events are too common and limit their appearance to rolls of triple 1's.) Connors rolls the two white dice: 3, 4. He's gotten into an argument with the umpire (realism!) and draws a warning. If he argues again, he'll automatically lose a point.<br/><br/>Back to serving: 1, 4 (white) and 2 (red). The result is &quot;I&quot;. McEnroe's return: 3, 4 (white) and 1 (red) - a &quot;V&quot;. Connors rolls 1, 2 (white) and 4 (red). A 12 on his Volley column is &quot;S&quot;, which means that he returned the shot but left his opponent in a good position. McEnroe can roll on the favorable &quot;Special&quot; column. Sure enough. He rolls 3, 5 (white) and 3 (red); a 35 on his Special column wins the point. 30-15.<br/><br/>And so it goes.<br/><br/>This not a game for anyone who wants to devise winning strategies. Rather, the players watch as the dice play. That is, however, the point of this kind of sports simulation: to project what would happen if real athletes competed in imaginary matches.<br/><br/>The game also includes rules for doubles, mixed doubles and matches between men and women.<br/><br/>"}, "5286": {"boardgamedesigner": ["(Uncredited)"], "poll": [], "name": "Sports Spectacular", "playingtime": "30", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": ["Dice Rolling"], "yearpublished": "1977", "usersrated": "9", "maxplayers": "4", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic18378_t.jpg", "average": "6.55556", "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["Research Games, Inc. / Athol / RGI / ARC"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic18378.jpg", "boardgameversion": ["RGI First Edition"], "maxplaytime": "30", "boardgamecategory": ["Sports"], "age": "8", "minplaytime": "30", "description": "This set contains simple games for six sports.

The eight scenarios contained herein focus on historical World War II battle situations involving the Resistance forces of various countries vs. the German and Axis Minor troops occupying their lands.  PARTISAN! will challenge your abilities in basic infantry combat as you maneuver and fire your squads, leaders and supporting weapons in scenarios whose forces run the gamut from elite Germans to poorly equipped but highly-motivated freedom fighters, to low-grade occupation troops.  Experience - as only ASL can let you - the vicious, no-quarter ambushes, surprise raids and set-piece assaults that characterized guerilla warfare in the cities, forests and mountains of Europe.  Regardless of your preferences (including solitaire play), if you're an ASL infantry-grognard you're bound to find something pleasing in the wide assortment of PARTISAN! scenarios, which range from the large, high-piece-density type to the small, quick setup kind.  One is even &quot;three-dimensional&quot;, with most of the action occurring underground, using separate boards for the above and below-ground levels.<br/><br/>PARTISAN!, along with its eight scenarios, contains one countersheet of Axis Minor infantry and support weapons - and also includes two boards: 10, with new, revised artwork; and 32, which features dense woods, a stream and a small cluster of buildings.

The Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor will usher the United States into World War II and seal the doom of the Thou&shy; sand Year Reich.

The Visiting Team bats in the top half of each of the nine innings and the Home Team, in the bottom half. Runners move around the bases, and runs and innings are recorded on a stand-up scoreboard screen. The game uses a special deck of 54 cards, which represent typical baseball plays. When a manager&rsquo;s team is at bat, that manager will try to play cards that will help score runs. When not at bat, that manager will try to play cards that will result in outs for the other team.<br/><br/>The designer on his original edition: &quot;The scoring rules are simple and logical, and differ only slightly from the official rules of baseball. The elements of luck and skill are balanced carefully, so as to make each game an interesting and different contest.&quot;<br/><br/>The game includes rules for the Heirloom edition as well as the original 1962 rules, which contain instructions for playing with 3 or 4 players plus &quot;Slugfest&quot; and &quot;Shutout&quot; variants.<br/><br/>GAMEPLAY<br/>Each player draws a hand of 3 cards, which when played will result in a play result. At the beginning of each half inning, the batting team plays a card for the first batter. The play is then resolved and the player draws a card to bring his hand back to three. The pitching team then plays a card to derive a result for the second batter and draws a card to replace into his hand. Play goes like this until three outs are made.<br/><br/>There are two different types of special cards in the game. Substitute cards, when drawn, are immediately played face up in front of the player drawing them, along with another card drawn from the deck and placed, unseen, on top of it. A player may use the substitute card as a &quot;pinch hitter&quot; or &quot;relief pitcher&quot; in the game when his hand does not have a useful card (i.e. a hit when he is at bat or an out when he is pitching). The substitute card is then flipped over and played.<br/><br/>Wild cards are those which only affect base runners and do not resolve an at bat (e.g. wild pitch, passed ball, stolen base, balk). When one of these cards is played, the result is noted, but then play passes back to the opponent, who will play a card to resolve the at bat.<br/><br/>After every three innings, both players return their hands to the deck, reshuffle the deck, and receive a new hand of three cards. After nine innings, whoever has the most runs is the winner.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": ["Out of the Box Heirloom Edition"], "average": "6.32072", "name": "Harry's Grand Slam Baseball Game", "playingtime": "20", "boardgamemechanic": ["Hand Management", "Simulation"], "age": "8", "usersrated": "394", "boardgamesubdomain": ["Family Games", "Thematic Games"], "boardgamefamily": ["Sports: Baseball"], "boardgamepodcastepisode": ["BGTG 66 - Dec. 8, 2006 - Thanksgiving Leftovers (Qwirkle, Winner's Circle, Harry's Grand Slam Baseball, Hyle7, Make Five) &amp; Feedback", "BGTG 86 - All About Harry's Grand Slam Baseball (with David Gullett)"]}, "5307": {"boardgamedesigner": ["Dan Verssen"], "poll": [], "name": "Among Nations", "playingtime": "30", "minplayers": "3", "boardgamemechanic": ["Hand Management", "Trading"], "yearpublished": "1994", "usersrated": "11", "boardgamefamily": ["Gamefix / Competitive Edge"], "maxplayers": "6", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic70746_t.jpg", "average": "3.72727", "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["Game Publications Group"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic70746.jpg", "boardgameversion": ["First edition"], "maxplaytime": "30", "boardgamecategory": ["Card Game", "Negotiation", "Political"], "age": "0", "minplaytime": "30", "description": "An easy-to-play card game of international wheeling and double-dealing.

The two battles, Brice's Crossroads and Tupelo, resulted from U.S. General William T. Sherman's campaign to remove Forrest as a threat to his flank and supply lines. Before the Union Army marched on Atlanta, Elements of Sherman's Army pursued Forrest, and others, into Mississippi and engaged his cavalry twice before its destruction at Tupelo.<br/><br/>All game-turns represent approximately 1 hour real time, and each Strength Point is the equivalent of 50 men or 1 gun. In Brice's Crossroads, the map scale is 115 yards per hex. In Tupelo the scale is 160 yards per hex.<br/><br/>This game is an excellent example of the, ever evolving, TSS/GBACW game system.

Each player has a hand of cards that are numbered from 0 to 3, plus a &quot;Battle&quot; card. To get a body, you play a &quot;war&quot;-like card game, blindly drawing one of your cards. The player with the highest card gets to choose from the four bodies available. The loser chooses from what is remaining. Next, the players bid for accessories, the armor and weapons. The loser of the body choice gets to choose the first accessory up for bid. Each robot has a specific set of armor that will fit it. If you lose the bid on it, you are at a severe disadvantage. However, your opponent will have had to use up bid cards and thus will have less for later auctions. You also can prevent your opponent from completing his robot by playing your &quot;Battle&quot; card in an auction. This gives the item up for bid to your opponent, but ends all bidding for accessories and sends you to the next stage of the game.<br/><br/>Once you have a robot and accessories for it, it is time to battle in the arena. You build your robot on a plastic arm that has a wheel control and trigger on the other side. Robots face off on any flat surface. Battles have a Rock 'Em Sock 'Em Robots robots feel, as the goal is to maneuver your robot where it can knock off your opponent's armor and expose a release button.

Highest score wins, with some elements automatically destroying others and most others being destroyed if their final score is half, or less, than that of the opponent.<br/><br/>The strength of the game is that there are no 'fixed' armies. With only a few restrictions (concerned with which elements can be generals and the proportion of 'powerful' troop types) you can construct your army any way you wish.

There are bonuses that allow the players to &quot;go again&quot; or &quot;give a word&quot; to another player. The object is to get rid of all of your words first. Other players then lose points for the words they have left.<br/><br/>Rounds are played until someone gets to zero and then highest score wins.<br/><br/>"}, "5371": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic354605.jpg", "poll": [], "boardgamedesigner": ["Dieter Gebhardt"], "statistics": [], "yearpublished": "1998", "maxplayers": "4", "boardgameartist": ["Anja Dreier-Br\u00fcckner"], "boardgamepublisher": ["HABA - Habermaa\u00df GmbH"], "maxplaytime": "20", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic354605_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "20", "boardgamecategory": ["Animals", "Children's Game", "Educational", "Environmental"], "description": "Hamsterbacke is a children's game for 2-4 players, Ages 4 and up<br/><br/>The underground burrows of the little hamsters are empty once again.

Each player represents a family that buys up and develops large tracts of land. The area of settlement is 98 squares (9 x 11, with one square missing). Each family starts with a double-sized tile of each of the three land types - settlement, cropland, pasture. Tiles have undeveloped and developed sides; naturally, they start undeveloped.<br/><br/>In each round after the initial placement of the starting tiles, players bid for the right to buy more land tiles or development cards - up to two per round. A total of 9 combined tiles and cards are available each round for purchase. The advantage of bidding high (and thus paying more for each purchase) is that high bidders get the first choice, and the highest bidder gets to decide how many tiles and cards will be up for auction in the next round. Tiles or cards must be played immediately after purchase, unless barns are available to store cards (but not tiles) for later use. Those that can't be played may not be bought.<br/><br/>Development cards are of two kinds. One lets a player buy pilgrims (who generate shillings, the game's currency), barns (to store development cards) or ships (to add extra tiles or cards to those on offer). The other is needed to develop land tiles. Development is possible only if the player owns undeveloped tiles of the same type, number and configuration as shown on the card, e. g., three cropland tiles forming a right angle, two adjacent pastures or a square of four settlements.<br/><br/>Playing development cards earns victory points, the number depending on the difficulty of using the card. A square of tiles scores 10 points, while a pilgrim, barn or ship gains only one.<br/><br/>Play continues until there are too few cards and tiles left to stock a full auction. At that point, the players tally their victory points, adding bonuses for most pilgrims, barns or ships. The winner is the player with the most points; shillings are the tie breaker.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "3", "boardgameversion": ["Goldsieber German Edition", "\u00dcberplay English edition"], "average": "6.52189", "name": "New England", "playingtime": "90", "boardgamemechanic": ["Auction/Bidding", "Tile Placement"], "age": "12", "usersrated": "1751", "boardgamesubdomain": ["Strategy Games"], "boardgamefamily": ["Country: USA"]}, "5407": {"boardgamedesigner": ["Greg Poehlein"], "poll": [], "name": "Stock Car Saturday Night", "playingtime": "30", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": ["Hand Management"], "yearpublished": "2003", "usersrated": "4", "boardgamefamily": ["Sports: Auto Racing"], "maxplayers": "12", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic104027_t.jpg", "average": "5.75", "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["Microtactix"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic104027.jpg", "maxplaytime": "30", "boardgamecategory": ["Racing", "Sports"], "age": "0", "minplaytime": "30", "description": "Print-'n'-Play game by Greg Poehlein brings stock car racing action to your tabletop!

The game is a joint work of Leo Colovini and Michael Schacht.<br/><br/>The southern region of Italy was called Magna Grecia and was settled 2,500 years ago by Greek merchants and adventurers. Before the arrival of the Greeks, the country was inhabited by only a few small tribes. Fruitful soil, navigable rivers, large forests, and bronze and silver mines offered enormous development possibilities. Larger cities developed, such as Tarantum, Syracuse, Katane, Locri, and Naxos. In addition, there were numerous villages of which no trace remains. A local road system promoted trade, and rich markets developed in the cities. More and more rivalries between the cities arose, particularly over control of the Oracle, which represented an important source for fame and wealth.<br/><br/>Sufficient material for an evening of play. Each player must successfully settle and develop Magna Grecia. At favorable points, markets are built, villages are developed into cities and interconnected by a road system. Only thus may the interior be opened and the Oracle controlled. Constructing your own large city is often very expensive, and it is sometimes worthwhile to build instead in the neutral villages or opponents' cities.<br/><br/>The board is covered with a hexagon grid on which pieces of road, towns, or markets are placed. A game is 12 rounds long. Each round is determined by an action map, which is set up at the beginning of play according to a certain pattern. The map specifies the player sequence and indicates to which extent the three basic actions (road construction, city building, and supply) may be used. There are also, of course, certain building rules to be considered. Additionally, markets can be established, the value of which depends on the number of connected locations. The Oracle is shown on the board. In order to control the Oracle, a player must connect one of his own cities to it by road. But if several cities are connected to an Oracle, the most important city takes precedence, determined by the number of locations connected to the city (not including Oracles).<br/><br/>Markets and the Oracle determine when the game ends.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": ["German first edition", "Rio Grande Games edition"], "name": "Magna Grecia", "playingtime": "90", "boardgamemechanic": ["Route/Network Building", "Tile Placement"], "age": "12", "usersrated": "780", "boardgamesubdomain": ["Strategy Games"], "average": "6.58881"}, "5420": {"boardgamedesigner": ["Douglas Alan Byrne"], "poll": [], "name": "Assassin: The Final Game", "playingtime": "90", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": ["Commodity Speculation", "Pick-up and Deliver", "Roll / Spin and Move"], "yearpublished": "1980", "usersrated": "77", "maxplayers": "4", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic227433_t.jpg", "average": "4.62078", "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["Alga", "Southold Game Corp."], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic227433.jpg", "boardgameversion": ["Alga First Swedish Edition", "Southold First English Edition"], "maxplaytime": "90", "boardgamecategory": ["Mafia", "Spies/Secret Agents"], "age": "12", "minplaytime": "90", "description": "The object of the game is to arrange the assassination of all opposing players and thereby take control of world traffic <br/>in illegally obtained commodities (drugs, plutonium, munitions, oil, secrets, diamonds and gold).<br/><br/>As you move around the board, you can buy and sell the commodities as indicated in each city.

Hired Assassins come in three classes (A through C), the cheaper being less proficient in weaponry than the more expensive ones (A: five weapons; C: three weapons).<br/><br/>Assassinations are resolved by drawing an Assassin card and comparing it with a Location card; each location lists permissible weapons --if the assassin isn't proficient with at least one of those, too bad.  If he is, you draw a Weapon card to see if he managed to find/smuggle one of the needed weapons.  Assuming the three cards show a match, the designated weapon(s) lists a number that needs to be matched on the dice.  An assassinated player is eliminated.<br/><br/>To defend, you may offer 1 M$ to the player who ordered the assassination just before the dice are rolled, or you may hire an assassin of your own as a bodyguard.<br/><br/>"}, "5421": {"boardgamedesigner": ["Renato de Rosa"], "poll": [], "name": "Inferno", "playingtime": "30", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": ["Trading"], "yearpublished": "1995", "usersrated": "23", "maxplayers": "6", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic19486_t.jpg", "average": "4.48913", "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["Phalanx Games B.V.", "Venice Connection"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic19486.jpg", "maxplaytime": "30", "boardgamecategory": ["Economic"], "age": "10", "minplaytime": "30", "description": "Inferno is a card game when you trade souls of famous damned historical character.<br/><br/>An intriguing game of trade when time is the enemy.<br/><br/>"}, "5422": {"boardgamedesigner": ["Ennio Peres"], "poll": [], "name": "Verba Volant International", "playingtime": "10", "minplayers": "2", "usersrated": "11", "yearpublished": "1998", "boardgameimplementation": ["Sai Dov'\u00e8"], "maxplayers": "6", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic19484_t.jpg", "average": "6.42273", "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["Giovani nel tempo", "Venice Connection"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic19484.jpg", "boardgameversion": ["Giovani nel Tempo Italian second edition", "Venice Connection Italian first edition", "Venice Connection multilingual edition 1998"], "maxplaytime": "10", "boardgamecategory": ["Card Game", "Word Game"], "age": "8", "minplaytime": "10", "description": "Cardboard tiles (or, in one edition, cards) with letters on them are dealt face down on the table.

This great &quot;Reconquista&quot; fired the crusading zeal of countless generations. The Arabs, or Moors as the Spanish knew them, saw the Spaniards as backward barbarians and fought ferociously to protect their sophisticated civilization. Finally, in 1482 King Ferdinand of Aragon embarked on the last campaign, to take the fabled city of Granada from its Islamic rulers.<br/><br/>This quick-playing, physically beautiful game re-creates the final 10-year struggle for Granada. Players take command of the Christian and Moslem holy warriors. God is on your side. Will you prevail? <br/><br/>Granada is a two-player game based on the 1481-1492 campaign between Ferdinand and Isabella of Aragon and Castille on one side (the &quot;Spanish player&quot;) and Muhammed XII and later Muhammed XIII on the other (the &quot;Moorish player&quot;). The game's designer is Robert G. Markham, known for Soldier Kings and dozens of other game designs.<br/><br/>The game is not overly complex. The game board (mounted, 22x17 inches) shows southern Spain including the Kingdom of Granada and surrounding areas. A network of key points is laid over this map, with castles, ports and unfortified areas connected by roads. Troops move along these roads from point to point. The object of the game for the Spanish player is to conquer the Moorish kingdom - Granada herself and five other important Moorish sites. The Moorish player seeks to prevent this, or to force peace on the Spaniards by taking their key cities of Cordoba and Lorca.<br/><br/>Each player has troops with which to carry out these tasks - knights, cavalry, and foot soldiers plus warships. The Spanish player also has siege cannon. Both players have leaders to move their troops and assist them in battle, with Ferdinand for the Spaniards and Muhammed al-Zagal for the Moors being much better at this than other leaders.<br/><br/>In battle, both players place their units on a combat display and roll dice to determine how many &quot;hits&quot; are achieved. Four hits will eliminate most units. The best units in the game are the Moorish Jund armored cavalry and the fanatic Spanish Knights of Santiago and Calatrava. A well-manned castle is very difficult to capture, but the Spanish siege guns can make an enormous difference. At sea, the Spanish player is trying to deny the Moor reinforcements from Africa. Many Moorish troops are volunteers from overseas, who must arrive at ports. The Moor can also gain aid from the Ottoman Empire, but only if he or she has kept the ports open.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": ["First edition"], "name": "Granada: The Fall of Moslem Spain", "playingtime": "120", "boardgamemechanic": ["Area Movement", "Dice Rolling", "Point to Point Movement"], "average": "5.97535", "usersrated": "71", "boardgamesubdomain": ["Wargames"], "boardgamefamily": ["Cities: Granada", "Country: Spain"]}, "5454": {"boardgamedesigner": ["(Uncredited)"], "poll": [], "name": "Canadian Checkers", "playingtime": "30", "minplayers": "2", "yearpublished": "0", "usersrated": "15", "boardgamesubdomain": ["Abstract Games"], "maxplayers": "2", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic19482_t.jpg", "boardgameversion": ["Game Crafter edition"], "average": "7.03333", "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["(Public Domain)", "The Game Crafter, LLC"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic19482.jpg", "boardgamefamily": ["Checkers", "Combinatorial"], "maxplaytime": "30", "boardgamecategory": ["Abstract Strategy"], "age": "7", "minplaytime": "30", "description": "This game, played mainly in Quebec, is different enough from Checkers to be called a distinct game.

The trick is, if you play a Wasp in response to being zapped by a wasp, then the opponent to your left must draw 2 cards equal to the numbers of wasp cards in the stack, unless your opponent plays a wasp which would make the next player draw even more cards unless HE also played a wasp, etc.<br/><br/>It's not uncommon for players to quickly draw huge handfuls of cards. There is a nice  balancing mechanism however. If you can match an identical card that someone just played you can &quot;match&quot; the player by quickly discarding the card. The player who played the original card must draw one card and play passes to the next player from the person who laid the Match. So the more cards you have in your hand, the more matches you can make to get rid of them.<br/><br/>Zar has a faster pace than UNO and constantly keeps you on toes to match your opponent's cards. This increases player interaction, excitement, and much more chaos.<br/><br/>If even Zar becomes too tame for you check out The Totally Insane Card Game.<br/><br/>"}, "5494": {"boardgamedesigner": ["(Uncredited)", "Peggy Brown"], "poll": [], "name": "Talkin' Tango", "playingtime": "60", "minplayers": "4", "boardgamemechanic": ["Partnerships"], "yearpublished": "2000", "usersrated": "71", "maxplayers": "8", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic472364_t.jpg", "average": "6.49296", "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["Damm / Egmont", "Patch Products"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic472364.jpg", "boardgameversion": ["English first edition", "English second edition", "Norwegian edition"], "maxplaytime": "60", "boardgamecategory": ["Party Game", "Word Game"], "age": "8", "minplaytime": "60", "description": "Pick your partner!

You can&rsquo;t win unless you have 10 Object cards on your side with no virus tokens on them. Other Action cards shield your Objects from viruses (like Anti Virus), and help to clean virus tokens off your Object cards (Cleanup). There are Action cards that allow you to steal a card from another player (Piracy), remove anti-virus protection (AV Killer), or that pesky Virus Generator card (Scan), or search for a card in the discard pile (Backup). Some Action cards like Virus!, Recycle or Repair use a 6-sided die to determine how many virus tokens are placed or removed from your Object cards. This adds an aspect of chance to the game, and helps make every game you play different.<br/><br/>A more attainable goal of playing to just 6 virus-free objects is recommended by some players.<br/><br/>"}, "5498": {"boardgamedesigner": ["(Uncredited)"], "poll": [], "name": "Maltese", "playingtime": "30", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": ["Hand Management", "Set Collection"], "yearpublished": "1977", "usersrated": "3", "boardgamesubdomain": ["Abstract Games"], "maxplayers": "4", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic20508_t.jpg", "average": "6.5", "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["Dawn Enterprises"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic20508.jpg", "boardgamefamily": ["Rummy Games"], "maxplaytime": "30", "boardgamecategory": ["Abstract Strategy", "Card Game"], "age": "0", "minplaytime": "30", "description": "Maltese uses tiles in an original rummy-type game in which completing sets can enable players to force tiles out of their opponent's hands.<br/><br/>Tiles come in 5 colors, and each tile has an inset in any of those same 5 colors.  Half of the insets will match the tile's exterior, half won't.  So, for example, of the 16 green tiles, 8 have green insets, 2 have orange, 2 have white, 2 have read, and 2 have blue.<br/><br/>All players can see the external color of a tile, but only the owner sees its inset - and the inset color is what really counts.<br/><br/>Additionally, each player has a tile holder (&quot;shield&quot;) which holds the tiles in 5 rows.  When playing into this section of the shield, all the tiles in a row must be a single color (inset), and each row must be a different color.  So you'll have one row that is all-white, one that is all-red, etc, but you can choose which is which.  Furthermore, each row contains a different # of tiles, from 1-5.  The goal is to completely fill in this section of your shield: a total of 5 matched rows with a total of 15 tiles.<br/><br/>A typical turn involves choosing a tile randomly, placing it into your hand, and then moving one tile from your hand into the central, scoring, part of the shield.  There are two key moves that occur.  One is when you complete a row.  At this point, you announce ALL UNFINISHED ROWS OF THAT SAME INSET COLOR GO BACK TO THE ARMORY (Draw pile).  This is where both the varying # of tiles, and the limited information are crucial.  You could, for example, play a single green tile in your &quot;#1&quot; row - and complete it.  If an opponent is working on a larger green row that is incomplete, he may have to discard as many as 4 green tiles.  You know that half of the green exterior tiles are green - so you only have limited information as to which of your opponents' rows might be green, or if they are even working on any green rows.<br/><br/>The second attack move occurs when you complete a row that is entirely &quot;matched&quot; (Insert color matches exterior color).  You can even do this by replacing unmatched tiles with matched tiles in rows you've already completed.  You then announce ALL FINISHED BUT UNMATCHED ROWS OF THAT SAME ROW NUMBER ARE BACK TO THE ARMORY.  In this case, if you complete a matched #3 row, all opponents who have completed unmatched #3 rows must toss all of these three tiles back into the draw pile.<br/><br/>Game ends when the first player completes all 5 rows with 5 different colors - matched or not.<br/><br/>"}, "5499": {"boardgamedesigner": ["Wolfgang Kramer"], "poll": [], "name": "Das gro\u00dfe Unternehmen Erdgas", "playingtime": "90", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": ["Pick-up and Deliver"], "yearpublished": "1982", "usersrated": "15", "boardgamefamily": ["Oil, Gas, and Petroleum", "Promotional Board Games"], "maxplayers": "5", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2277073_t.jpg", "average": "5.53333", "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["Information Erdgas", "Otto Maier Verlag"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2277073.jpg", "boardgameversion": ["Information Erdgas First Edition"], "maxplaytime": "90", "boardgamecategory": ["Economic", "Industry / Manufacturing", "Transportation"], "age": "0", "minplaytime": "90", "description": "This is the first published game to use a victory point track going around the board (known among German gamers as a Kramerleiste).<br/><br/>This game is a precursor to Wolfgang Kramer's Wildlife Adventure and Expedition games, utilizing similar mechanisms but with a gas pipeline-building theme.
