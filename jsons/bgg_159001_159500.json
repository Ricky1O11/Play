Crippled with production problems, delays, illness, and actor changes, the final piece plays out like a glitter-stained collage of leftover jigsaw pieces, while the characters are random bits of nonsense drawn from the imagination of a confused screenwriter.

Or will the flop prove what the producers knew all along?<br/><br/>Each game in the Protocol series is zero-prep for 3 or more players.<br/>The game length is exponentially long, so games with more players take more time to complete.

From the ashes of a devastating third World War, a precious few golden cities emerge offering hope to those who struggle for survival in the wastelands. Players explore the ruins of the modern world completing quests, honing their skills and maneuvering for social status in order to claim a precious spot as a citizen with a Golden City. To enter the golden city you must:<br/><br/><br/>    Become an expert: Reach 20 skill points.<br/>    Serve the city: Fulfill three secret quests.<br/>    Become a nobleman: Get the most possible character points.<br/><br/><br/>In each turn, the players can spend action points to do several actions such as moving through the city, raiding buildings, attacking other players, and more. Each player has a specific skill &mdash; mechanic, trader, electrician, bodyguard and medic &mdash; and has his own unique items to build; those items can be traded off against other items or resources.<br/><br/>The board of the game is modular so that in every game you have a new map to discover. All over the map, the players find different buildings which they can raid. Each time a player raids a building, a raid card of this type of building is taken and read, which leads to specific circumstances taking place. The player will be made to make various decisions including important moral decisions! Upon resolving the various decisions, you will receive character points. The choices you make, for good or for bad, will lead to specific perks and advantages (or disadvantages) during the progress of the game. When raiding a building, you get resources (tools, scraps, mechanics, electronics, etc.). By combining these resources, you can craft items with special abilities. By doing so, you will advance your skill points.<br/><br/>Every player also gets secret quests of the golden city. To fulfill these quests, the players have to spend the resources mentioned on the card. To fulfill a quest will not only lead the players closer to victory but also give them advantages for the rest of the game.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "3", "boardgameversion": {"239773": "English first

The top three cards of the mutation deck are revealed after shuffling the mutation deck.<br/><br/>Phase of Play:<br/><br/>Each player can perform the following during their turn:<br/><br/>&bull; Combat<br/><br/>&bull; Action<br/><br/>&bull; Transformation.<br/><br/>During the combat phase, the player fights the adventurers with combat cards. Should the player win, the adventurer card is \\&quot;consumed\\&quot; and may later be used to purchase mutations. Should the player be defeated, his/her slime is removed from the game and regenerates in the next turn. Other players may also raise the combat difficulties when certain conditions are met.<br/><br/>During the action phase, the player may move his/her own slime, the adventurer decks or purchase the revealed mutation cards by spending adventurer cards.<br/><br/>During the transformation phase, the player may discard and refill the cards in his/her hand.<br/><br/>The game ends whenever<br/><br/>&bull; a player accumulates six mutation cards<br/><br/>&bull; less than 4 adventurers remain at the end of any player\\'s turn.<br/><br/>In the former situation, the player with six mutation cards wins. In the later situation, the winner is<br/><br/>decided based on the mutations each player has and the adventurers they defeated.<br/><br/>The Game Design<br/><br/>The slime adventure is a party game that is easy to learn. However, it also enjoys a satisfactory strategy depth by employing a system where the card placement opens up many different options for the players. Similar to many other games in this genre, one can win either by focusing on progressing toward the victory condition or denying other players. The random components play a huge role in this game, as it should. However, players are not knocked out of the game before the game ends. Hence, \\&quot;poor hands\\&quot; are more bearable. Overall, the slime adventure is quite fun and contains quite some humorous JRPG references. If you like both card games and JRPG, you might want to check this game out.<br/><br/>"}, "159018": {"rpgitemversion": {"239797": "PDF version"}, "poll": {}, "name": "Getting There Is Half the Fun", "rpgproducer": {"13437": "Brennan Taylor"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2013480.jpg", "usersrated": "1", "average": "8", "statistics": {}, "rpg": {"11015": "Bulldogs!

For years now, warlords have roamed the land, every surface is covered with filth, and disease has ripped through towns like great tornadoes. King Sivolc has dreamed that building a great gothic structure is the answer to leave this Dark Age behind forever. But for the last decade, there has been a massive decline in the building activity, and hardly any great cultural achievements have been made.<br/><br/>Recently, while on one of his crusades, King Sivolc met a master architect named Elias. Elias told the King about his devotion to the mortar arts and how he longed to build a structure so great that people would travel hundreds of miles just to gaze at it. This meeting created a spark that ignited the King&rsquo;s dream with a fire that would burn away even the darkest of days forever. King Sivolc looks on from his castle and watches with great expectation as his dream becomes a reality.  With Elias&rsquo; help, he has hired some of the greatest architects and monks in the land to complete this task. He waits patiently for this great abbey to be raised from the earth, filled with people, changing the course of history forever!<br/><br/>The King's Abbey is a worker placement/resource management game in which each player has their own player board that represents the abbey they have been tasked to build. Players take charge of monks that are represented by ten dice as they go out and gather resources, go on crusades, construct buildings, train clergy, bring in peasants, and defend their abbey against the darkness. Each player does this by rolling their dice and then assigning each die (monk) to different places on their player board, resource boards, and crusade cards. The places on the player boards will bring in peasants and train clergy. The places on the resource boards will give them wood, grain, stone, and sand for building the various parts of their individual abbeys.<br/><br/>Each player receives prestige (victory points) for completing crusades and constructing various things in their abbey such as towers and different kinds of buildings. The game proceeds over a total of seven rounds where the &quot;darkness&quot; becomes greater each round. The darkness represents things like depression, famine, raiders attacking, and other things that the Dark Ages brought with it. You fight the darkness by keeping the defenses of your abbey strong. Players are trying to have the most prestige than any other player by the end of the seventh round.<br/><br/>After seven rounds, players add up all prestige earned. Whoever has the most prestige wins the game!<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "1", "boardgameversion": {"239881": "English first edition"}, "average": "7.21125", "name": "The King's Abbey", "playingtime": "180", "boardgamemechanic": {"2072": "Dice Rolling"}, "age": "12", "boardgameexpansion": {}, "usersrated": "401", "boardgamesubdomain": {"5497": "Strategy Games"}, "boardgamefamily": {"8374": "Crowdfunding: Kickstarter"}}, "159060": {"rpgitemversion": {"239883": "PDF version"}, "poll": {}, "name": "Seawolf Submarine", "rpgproducer": {"60450": "Christian Hollnbuchner"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2213096.jpg", "usersrated": "0", "average": "0", "statistics": {}, "rpggenre": {"162": "Science Fiction (Space Opera)"}, "rpg": {"499": "Traveller (Mongoose)"}, "rpgcategory": {"2108": "Sourcebook (rules/options to enhance play)"}, "rpgseries": {"24587": "Vehicle Book"}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2213096_t.jpg", "description": "From publisher blurb:<br/><br/>This product is a little booklet of a Traveller compatible vehicle.

The Alien card of a Master Alien is twice the size of a standard card. It&rsquo;s also printed on both sides, each with a different set of stats for the Alien. The Master Alien can flip its card from one side to the other during combat, making its behaviour dynamic and unpredictable.<br/><br/>A common feature of Master Aliens is their &ldquo;Archenemy&rdquo; power.

To properly represent this new setting, a new system of modular tiles creates the game board, using smaller tiles with a variable number of areas. The tiles remain fully compatible with all the maps of the GD Universe to create custom missions. This new system, combined with standard map tiles create an unique game experience.<br/><br/>Below the ground, alien menaces lurk in the shadows.

Players are dealt character, weapon, and location cards after the top card from each card type is secretly placed in the confidential file in the middle of the board. Players must move to a room and then make an accusation against a character saying they did it in that room with a specific weapon. The player to the left must show one of any cards accused to the accuser if in that player's hand. Through deductive reasoning each player must figure out which character, weapon, and location are in the secret file. To do this, each player must uncover what cards are in other players hands by making more and more accusations. Once a player knows what cards the other players are holding they will know what cards are in the secret file.<br/><br/>In Parcheesi, each player has a set of pawns that start in his or her corner of the board. The goal is to move the pawns around the board to the &quot;home&quot; section. Movement is controlled by dice. All players move around the same board, so they may capture each others pawns.

The initial attack was a coup-de-main glider assault on Pegasus Bridge, but it was not the only action taken against bridges that night.

So you could be a slightly inferior fighter (i.e. one level lower), and with less hit-points too, but with the spellcasting ability of the 7th level wizard.

For this reason, FANTASTIC HEROES &amp; WITCHERY instead proposes split-class characters, for those who would want to pursue two careers rather than a single one. Then, as fighter-mages were much popular back in the days, and split-class fighter + wizard characters tend to be weak, the war-mage class was also introduced.<br/><br/>Nonetheless, there might still be room for multi-class characters as in earlier editions. That is: combine two classes. The character gets the better BtH and save progression of the two classes; all the class abilities of  both  classes;  and  for  hit-points,  half  the  sum  of  both  classes&rsquo;  hitdice (round fractions up). However, to prevent multi-class characters to be too powerful, they will be restricted to NPC classes, which are less powerful (have no special abilities) than adventuring core-classes. These NPC classes (which are detailed p.130-131 of the core rulebook, and are also reproduced here) are the: Fighting-man, Clergyman, Cultist, Magic-user, Professional, and Thug.<br/><br/>"}, "159152": {"rpg": {"11105": "Dungeon World"}, "statistics": {}, "name": "The Ghoul", "rpgproducer": {"68005": "David Guyll"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2016042.jpg", "usersrated": "0", "rpgitemversion": {"240037": "PDF version"}, "average": "0", "rpggenre": {"155": "Fantasy (High Fantasy)"}, "rpgcategory": {"2108": "Sourcebook (rules/options to enhance play)"}, "poll": {}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2016042_t.jpg", "description": "From publisher blurb:<br/><br/>You are dead.

Cards in hand can be used to defend your own buckets and attack those of others &mdash; and if you knock out a bucket low in someone's pyramid, you might cause a cascade that takes out even more!<br/><br/>Each turn, the active player either plays cards or loses buckets; the game is played in rounds with a new round starting after anyone loses one or more buckets. At the start of each round, the active player chooses 1-3 cards in hand of the same color/animal, lays them face up in front of himself, announces their sum, then draws one card to add to his hand (regardless of how many he played). Each subsequent player must lay down 1-3 cards of the same suit as the initial player with a higher sum than previously announced or else lose a bucket. (If play circles the table to the round's start player, he can add 1-3 new cards to those previously played, then announce the sum of all cards in front of him.)<br/><br/>When a player cannot or chooses not to defend his pyramid by playing cards, he removes one bucket of that card color from his pyramid by pushing, flicking or poking it with only one finger. (If he doesn't have a bucket of the required color, he removes a bucket of his choice.) This player then starts a new round after everyone has cleared their played cards.<br/><br/>In a two- to four-player game, the game ends when a player loses his last bucket; in a five- to six-player game, a player who loses his last bucket is out of the game, and the game ends when only three players have buckets still in play. Whoever has the most buckets remaining in his pyramid wins.<br/><br/>Bucket King 3D includes 2 variants for experience players: <br/>(1)Play with the Special &quot;One&quot;!<br/>Whenever a player lays down a 1 while playing cards of the appropriate color, he can also play one other card of any color, adding the value of that card (and any others played) to his sum; he then draws two cards (one as normal, plus another card for the bonus card played) to end his turn. For example, if the required suit is blue, he may play a blue 1, with a red 4 as the additional card, announce his sum as &quot;Five&quot;, then draw two cards from the deck.<br/><br/>If he plays two 1s, then he may play two additional cards of any color and draw three cards at the end of his turn. A player can lay down at most five cards.<br/><br/>(2) Play with the Backfiring Discard!<br/>This variant is played with all the basic rules, but the direction of play may change during the game!<br/>When the active player plays cards to attack on his turn, the direction of the play is reversed if he plays an additional card of the same colour onto the discard pile. He draws cards as normal for the cards he has played in front of himself, but he does not draw any card for the additional card he has played.<br/>For example, a player has played a Blue 4. The next player plays a Blue 5 in front of himself and discards a Blue 2. Then he draws only 1 card. The direction changes now and play continues with the previous player.<br/>You may play both variants (1) and (2) in the same game! For example, a player may play a Blue 1 and a Red 7 in front of himself (variant 1) and the direction of play remains unchanged. But if he plays a Blue 1 and a Red 7 in front of himself (variant 1) and discards a Blue 2 (variant 2), the game continues in the reverse direction.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": {"281015": "Dutch/French first edition"}, "average": "6.26242", "name": "Bucket King 3D", "playingtime": "20", "boardgamemechanic": {"2040": "Hand Management"}, "age": "8", "usersrated": "334", "boardgamesubdomain": {"5499": "Family Games"}, "boardgamefamily": {"5607": "3D Games"}}, "159210": {"statistics": {}, "name": "Sportsfriends", "videogamemode": {"2422": "Local Multiplayer"}, "videogameversion": {"240150": "US PS3 edition"}, "average": "8.33333", "videogametheme": {"2319": "Cartoon"}, "usersrated": "3", "videogamegenre": {"2159": "Fighting"}, "videogameplatform": {"4435": "PlayStation 3"}, "poll": {}, "videogamecompilation": {"142307": "Johann Sebastian Joust"}, "description": "Sportsfriends is a multiplayer video game created by the Danish independent developer collective Die Gute Fabrik, known for their previous title Where is my Heart?. It consists of four games: Johann Sebastian Joust (J.S. Joust), Super Pole Riders, BaraBariBall, and Hokra.<br/><br/>Super Pole Riders is a polevaulting game created by Bennet Foddy, developer of QWOP.<br/><br/>J.S. Joust is a local multiplayer no-graphics contact sport video game created by Douglas Wilson. The objective of the game is to be the last man standing. This is done by players trying to cause a rapid motion in their opponent's controller: a PlayStation Move. During the game, music from Johann Sebastian Bach's Brandenburg concertos is played at a slow tempo. In relation to a player being knocked out, there is a tolerance of motion the controller will allow that is linked to the speed of the music. As the speed of the music increases, so does the motion tolerance, which allows players to move more rapidly without setting off their controller.<br/><br/>BaraBariBall is a 2-4 player sports game that draws comparisons to well known fighting games such as Super Smash Bros. and PlayStation All-Stars Battle Royale, since the game focuses heavily on platforming. BaraBariBall injects a ball and goal into the platforming fighter genre, taking the priority away from killing an opponent. Instead, the players focus on scoring by throwing or dunking the ball into the opposing players' water, scoring two points upon a successful dunk. The players attempt to knock the ball out of each other's grasp by attacking the player in possession of the ball with directional based combat similar to Super Smash Bros. However, the players are not limited to only one or two jumps, instead able to jump up to eight times as long as the player still has enough &quot;charges&quot;. These are represented by circles floating around the character, which are consumed each time a player jumps and recharge as long as the player is on the ground. Once the player runs out of circles, the player falls. If a player falls into the water (the goals), the player dies and re-spawns at the center of the stage a few seconds later, causing their team to lose a point.<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;Sportsfriends&quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>User addition:<br/>Hokra is a minimalist sports game, where players are split into teams of green or pink squares.

Game play is centered around building an economic engine, and uses a bidding mechanic where players must balance bids to get the good stuff and to avoid the bad against the actions needed to build their empire, while saving high bids as much as possible to convert to cash at the end of each season.<br/><br/>The game has a fixed number of turns - six seasons of five rounds each - and total play time tends to be about 2-2.5 hours for 4 people (the game is designed for 3-5, with a solid 2-player variant), on par with a feature movie. In every round there is one card per player up for grabs - every player gets a card every round. The cards on which players bid are businesses that are used to build up your economic engine, extra actions to be saved until needed most (and they let a player do some things outside the normal rules of play), special agenda cards that give score a bonus at the end of the game (how much depends on how well the conditions for the given card are fulfilled), and bad events (which are to be avoided if possible).<br/><br/>Players are bidding pick order rather than on a particular item. Each players uses a set nine of bidding cards (getting them all back at the start of each season), which represent how the player is dividing their attention that round between trying to get the best of the available items and getting other stuff done. Each bid has a specific action that it allows (lower bids have more powerful actions), and bids saved for the end of the season are worth extra money - the higher the bid the more it&rsquo;s worth. These additional aspects associated with each bid, the action and the end-of-season cash value, make for exciting, meaningful choices every round.<br/><br/>Business Mogul supports multiple valid strategies, though the highest final score usually goes to the player that dabbles in additional strategies beyond their primary one. The key to winning is being tactically smart about balancing pick order vs action vs end-of-season-payout, paying attention to the state of other player&rsquo;s empires and the bids they've already used in the current season, and executing a strategy that adapts to the flow of items up for bid.<br/><br/>There are some fairly common game mechanics/attributes that Mogul specifically does not have:<br/><br/>- It has no player-to-player aggression - the bidding each round is the only point of direct competition. <br/>- It does not have random action outcomes (that is whether or not a given action succeeds is not determined by dice, card draw, or anything like that). <br/>- It does not have any kind of territory control. <br/>- It has no resources / production beyond money and end-game score.<br/>- It does not require memorization of what&rsquo;s been played; aside from a single hidden card each player gets at the start and the particular bid a player is making in a given round, the state of the game is fully revealed.<br/><br/>"}, "159243": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2021020.jpg", "poll": {}, "boardgamedesigner": {"8167": {"name": "Warwick Kinrade"}}, "statistics": {}, "yearpublished": "2013", "maxplayers": "2", "boardgameartist": {"28351": "David Pentland"}, "boardgamepublisher": {"27259": {"name": "Iron Fist Publishing"}}, "maxplaytime": "120", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2021020_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "120", "boardgamecategory": {"1042": {"name": "Expansion for Base-game"}}, "description": "Back of the book:<br/><br/>1945, GERMANY... the heart of Germany is threatened by the remorseless advance of Allied armies from the east and west.

However, the original formatting was preserved to demonstrate how far Alluria Publishing has come in the last half-decade. While the content and art are still top notch, the format and layout are quite primitive by our current publishing standards, but still very enjoyable.<br/><br/>"}, "159258": {"rpg": {"2791": "Pathfinder System Compatible Product"}, "statistics": {}, "name": "A Player's Guide: The Colonies", "rpgproducer": {"52038": "John Bennett"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2017970.jpg", "usersrated": "0", "rpgitemversion": {"240239": "PDF version"}, "rpgsetting": {"24001": "Shadows Over Vathak"}, "average": "0", "rpggenre": {"155": "Fantasy (High Fantasy)"}, "rpgcategory": {"2107": "Campaign Setting (game world)"}, "poll": {}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2017970_t.jpg", "description": "From publisher blurb:<br/><br/>Shadows over Vathak: Colonies - Player's Guide<br/><br/>Welcome to the world of Shadows over Vathak, a realm where the abominations known as the Old Ones seek to destroy humanity.

There is a single deck of cards, no other play components. Advanced players may add custom cards.<br/><br/>The main mechanics are: shuffled cards, card drawing, turns, card playing, abilities (whose rules are applied when cards are played), and combo actions (= combining the abilities of multiple cards played in a single turn).<br/><br/>The system's logic is based on the diversity of the (rules of the) abilities present on the cards, and has an emphasis on combo actions. Combo actions emerge fluidly from the abilities, and have to be created on the spot by the players. To master the game, a player has to master combo actions.<br/><br/>The typical game duration for veteran players, without advanced gameplay, is (consistently) 30 minutes. Beginner players (who already know the rules) need about 60 minutes.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Gameplay Synopsis<br/><br/>Most of the time, a player has to engage (= play from hand) during his / her turns cards whose total sway (= numeric card value) is at least equal with the total sway of the cards engaged by the rival, thusly obstructing the rival.<br/><br/>Normally, during a turn, a player may engage only 1 card, but the abilities of the engaged cards allow for more cards to be engaged or drawn. This multiple engagement of cards is called combo action and forms the game's logic. Combo actions with 10 cards are not rare, and even with more than 20 have been seen.<br/><br/>From time to time, a player will not be able to obstruct the rival because he / she will not be able to create combos that are strong enough. In such a case, the player must discard 1 card from his / her reserve. Reserve is a play zone of each player, zone which contains a number of cards which is fixed at the beginning of the game; the number is normally 3, but advanced players can increase it by recruiting (= choosing) cards at the beginning of the game.<br/><br/>By discarding a reserve card each time when a player can't obstruct the rival, the player will have fewer cards to engage during the last turn of the game, the turn which will determine the winner of the game. However, simply having more or fewer cards in the reserve at the end of the game doesn't guarantee winning or losing the game, it just increases or decreases the chances. This is because each player also has some random cards in his / her hand, and this randomness affects the ending.<br/><br/>"}, "159333": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2310850.jpg", "poll": {}, "boardgamedesigner": {"3063": {"name": "Dieter Stein"}}, "statistics": {}, "yearpublished": "2014", "maxplayers": "2", "boardgameartist": {"73376": "Ludwig Gerhards"}, "boardgamepublisher": {"1001": {"name": "(Web published)"}}, "maxplaytime": "45", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2310850_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "45", "boardgamecategory": {"1009": {"name": "Abstract Strategy"}}, "description": "Fendo is a board game in which players take turns placing and moving their pieces.

Quoting again from the rules: &ldquo;When a player lands on another player&rsquo;s privately owned property, rent shown on the deed is paid as follows:<br/>1. The landing player pays rent to the property owner.<br/>2. The property owner is taxed half of his rent by the Administration, except that unions are exempt from this tax.<br/>3.

Give $5,000 to the player who has the least cash.&rdquo;<br/>&ldquo;Administration announces a new welfare program. You get something for nothing. A new tax. Pay $5,000&Prime;.<br/>&ldquo;By extensive correspondence, you refute Administration claim that you owe $600 in back taxes. Pay $500 postage.&rdquo;<br/>&ldquo;Administrative planning staff hires malcontent leftist professors recently employed by the university. Pay $2,000 staff salaries.&rdquo;<br/><br/>&ldquo;COURT RULINGS&rdquo; cards include these notices:<br/>&ldquo;You win case but must pay $1,000 to Administration for court record.&rdquo;<br/>&ldquo;You lose case and are charged $3,000 for contempt of court.<br/><br/>&ldquo;FAVORITISM&rdquo; cards run like this:<br/>&ldquo;Rusty Steel Co. gets order from Communist for 190 million shovels.

Combine cards, launch devastating attacks, and defend against a barrage of creativity!<br/><br/>In Ultimate Battle, the goal is to utterly destroy your opponent. In this creativity-fueled game it's one-hit destruction, so players must plan attacks and defenses carefully.<br/><br/>The gameplay centers around two to four players each drawing from a deck of Ultimate Battle Cards. These fully illustrated cards contain everything from powerful weapons and creatures (like sharks and poison) to more mundane objects (like a brick). Using their imaginations, players must illustrate attacks against their opponents on a large sheet of paper rolled out between both players. The attacking player uses any combination of cards in their hand to launch their attack. The defending player must then use cards from their hand to defend.<br/><br/>If players disagree on whether an attack or defense is valid a Disagreement Card is drawn, which quickly resolves any qualms. This gets the group back to playing as quickly as possible.<br/><br/>If a player can't defend an attack, or loses a disagreement when trying to defend, he or she is destroyed! Whether a world-class artist or a stick-figure impresario, everyone can draw out wild attacks in Ultimate Battle. Think quick, sketch even quicker, and may the best battler win!<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": {"240368": "English edition"}, "age": "0", "name": "Ultimate Battle", "playingtime": "15", "boardgamemechanic": {"2055": "Paper-and-Pencil"}, "average": "7.35714", "usersrated": "7", "boardgamefamily": {"22184": "Admin: Unreleased Games"}}, "159354": {"rpg": {"2069": "Mekton Zeta"}, "rpgseries": {"25116": "GagMen Podcast Scenarios"}, "name": "The Scrap Yard Club", "rpgproducer": {"3": "(Uncredited)"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2018559.png", "usersrated": "0", "rpgitemversion": {"240369": "PDF version"}, "average": "0", "statistics": {}, "rpggenre": {"174": "Animation / Comics (Anime / Manga)"}, "poll": {}, "rpgcategory": {"2084": "Scenario / Adventure / Module"}, "rpgpodcastepisode": {"119027": "Episode 8 - Everybody Cut Mek-Loose!"}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2018559_t.png", "description": "from the introduction:<br/>Mekton Zeta combines the all best elements of Japanese anime, such as sweet looking robots, unstoppable monsters, sinister villains, romantic angst, titanic battles , and most importantly: anime girls that make you wish you were a cartoon!

Players race to be the first to get to the center of the board while avoiding getting knocked back to the start by other players. Highlighting the power of the prime numbers, Prime Climb is mathematical, deep, creative, and fun.<br/><br/>Each player controls two pawns that start at the 0 circle. Players take turns rolling two 10-sided dice and applying the values to their two pawns using any of the four basic arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. The first to get both pawns into the 101 circle exactly wins the game! Be careful: if another player lands on you, you get sent back to the start. Along the way, players who land on the red circles collect Prime cards&mdash;some are helpful now, some are helpful later, and a few are trouble!<br/><br/>One of the great innovations of Prime Climb is the coloring scheme. Each of the prime numbers less than 10 has its own color: 2 is orange, 3 is green, 5 is blue, and 7 is purple. After 10, each prime number is red. Any number that is not a prime is a mix of colors that corresponds to its prime factors. For example, 14 = 2 x 7, so the 14 circle is half orange and half purple.<br/><br/>The color coding allows players a way to quickly analyze the factors and multiples of the numbers on the board. This helps players check their multiplication and division, and even allows kids who haven't yet learned multiplication to play the game.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": {"240406": "First Edition"}, "age": "10", "name": "Prime Climb", "playingtime": "45", "boardgamemechanic": {"2072": "Dice Rolling"}, "average": "6.57942", "usersrated": "62", "boardgamefamily": {"8374": "Crowdfunding: Kickstarter"}}, "159376": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2018939.png", "poll": {}, "boardgamedesigner": {"3": {"name": "(Uncredited)"}}, "statistics": {}, "yearpublished": "0", "maxplayers": "6", "boardgameartist": {"3": "(Uncredited)"}, "boardgamepublisher": {"3530": {"name": "Sala"}}, "maxplaytime": "25", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2018939_t.png", "minplaytime": "25", "boardgamecategory": {"1089": {"name": "Animals"}}, "description": "Objective: be the first reaching space 90 <br/> - moving by turns -<br/>Roll the die and move forward.

At the end of each player's turn, one of the chambers on the end of the lab gives way, plunging all test subjects on it into oblivion. But should your test subjects have numbered greater than all others in the falling chamber, they earn you some wonderful parting gifts, which can include cake.<br/><br/>Yet these moist slices of industrial-grade cake must be stored in the lab where they are at risk of falling into said oblivion. Not to mention that your jealous opponents can pick up your cake and move it closer to that precipice. He who has acquired the most cake when a team has lost its last test subject wins.

The first 48 pages details tactical rules and gives advice for running scenes of physical, social, and mental conflict. The remaining pages detail 135 pre-generated characters and archetypes for the Core system, addressing the three archetypal genres of sci-fi, fantasy, and modern settings.<br/><br/>The advice and rules are designed to enable a more precise understanding of the system in order to provide players with a meaningful challenge and balanced experience. The pre-generated characters are meant to provide the Game Master with easily accessible NPCs, story hooks, and more efficient prep time.<br/><br/>The book itself is divided into four parts. Part one is the technical stuff that addresses the rules as a function of the game. It contains observations about conflict types and breaks down the math behind the Fate Core system. It discusses the use of Fate Points as a tactical tool, and explains how the tactical system in Fate materially differs from traditionally crunchy tactical sims. Finally, it provides several pages of Aspects and Stunts alongside a few words of explanation.<br/><br/>Parts two, three, and four consist of the characters and archetypes built ready for use in any Fate Core conflict. The characters are divided into the sci-fi, fantasy, and urban genres, and further subdivided into physical, mental, and social opponents.

Rumors in a nearby village are that if you visit the place at night, you can still see the ghosts of those slain.<br/><br/>If the place is visited at night, the player characters see the ghosts of a crowd that looks to be milling around shopping. They can hear faint music and faint yelling from the ghosts standing on the northwest platform. A ghostly merchant hawks his wares and has the loudest voice and seems to be able to both see and hear the player characters. The merchant attempts to buy, sell, and haggle with them but seems to have no goods at all. However, if they give him money, the item bargained for does indeed appear and is an exact replica of one of the items the merchant lost in the fire. The merchant is the key to the haunting. If he can finally sell all the items he lost in the fire, it will free him and all the lost souls tethered to this place. If the player characters offer money to the street performers or the herald, the faint music or the words of the herald gain clarity and volume, allowing the player characters to hear the music and voices clearly. The herald is announcing the new merchant shop and the street performers sing and play a song about buying and selling goods.<br/><br/>If the player characters try to take anything from the plaza, even broken barrels, the ghosts materialize and attack them. As long as their souls are tethered to the forgotten plaza, they cannot allow any item to leave without the proper payment.

The Austro-Hungarian fleet that never was is present, along with French, British, Greek, Italian, German and Turkish ships, aircraft and airships.<br/><br/>There are also thirty new scenarios based on the battles that might have been waged on the Mediterranean Sea in this alternate world, plus more of the story of the Second Great War first begun in The Kaiser's Navy.  This module is not playable by itself, but requires ownership of Bomb Alley and Black Sea Fleets to enjoy all of the scenarios.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "1", "boardgameversion": {"240504": "First edition"}, "average": "7.4", "name": "Second World War at Sea: The Habsburg Fleet", "playingtime": "30", "boardgamemechanic": {"2072": "Dice Rolling"}, "age": "12", "boardgameexpansion": {}, "usersrated": "5", "boardgamesubdomain": {"4664": "Wargames"}, "expands": {"30069": {"name": "Second World War at Sea: Black Sea Fleets"}}, "boardgamefamily": {"41379": "Second Great War"}}, "159434": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2025859.jpg", "poll": {}, "boardgamedesigner": {"3": {"name": "(Uncredited)"}}, "statistics": {}, "yearpublished": "1976", "maxplayers": "4", "boardgameartist": {"3": "(Uncredited)"}, "boardgamepublisher": {"27341": {"name": "Poirot Corporation"}}, "maxplaytime": "60", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2025859_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "60", "boardgamecategory": {"1021": {"name": "Economic"}}, "description": "The object of the game is to have fun and learn more about the past and present of America's birthplace. A secondary object is to &quot;win&quot; the game by either controlling the entire city and forcing the other players out of the game or possess the most cash value at the end of an agreed on time period - 60 minutes, 90 minutes or whatever.<br/><br/>To start the game everyone begins at Independence Hall and receives $1776.00. Players take turns in order moving the allotted number of spaces (dice roll) in a clockwise direction around the board. If a player lands on a property with special instructions, they must be followed. If the player lands on an unowned property, it may be purchased. If the player lands on a property owned by another player, then rent must be collected. If the player lands on a property they already own, that player than receives rent from the bank. If a player rolls doubles, they roll again. A second roll of doubles send that player to the Roundhouse.<br/><br/>A player may sell any properties they own to any other player at any time during the game. The bank is forces to buy back any property a player choose at 67% of the original cost. The rent of each property is 10% of its original cost. If a players owns two properties of a kind (for example the Art Museum and the Academy of Music - cultural institutions) the rent is doubled. If a player owns three properties the rent is tripled. A player may not collect any rents while his pawn is at the Roundhouse or on the Expressway.<br/><br/>Whenever a player rolls a &quot;one&quot; that player gets to draw a Travel card. Whenever a player rolls a &quot;six&quot; that player gets to draw a News card. If a player rolls both a &quot;one&quot; and a &quot;six&quot; on the same roll that player can select either type of card, but not both. If double &quot;ones&quot; or &quot;sixes&quot; are rolled, that player draws nothing. When a player ends their turn on a block marked &quot;Travel Card&quot; or &quot;News Card&quot; that player draws the appropriate card. A player that ends their turn on either the Free Library or Franklin Institute gets to answer a Quiz card drawn by the player on their left. The &quot;correct&quot; answers to the Quiz cards are left to the discretion of the game players.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": {"240507": "First edition"}, "age": "0", "name": "The Philadelphia Game", "playingtime": "60", "boardgamemechanic": {"2012": "Auction/Bidding"}, "average": "0", "usersrated": "0", "boardgamefamily": {"18235": "Cities: Philadelphia (Pennsylvania, USA)"}}, "159435": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2026593.jpg", "poll": {}, "boardgamedesigner": {"20990": {"name": "Jay Cormier"}}, "statistics": {}, "yearpublished": "2014", "maxplayers": "4", "boardgamepublisher": {"47": {"name": "Queen Games"}}, "maxplaytime": "30", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2026593_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "30", "boardgamecategory": {"1017": {"name": "Dice"}}, "description": "This mini-expansion was a non-exclusive stretch goal during the Kickstarter campaign of the Tortuga base game and will be available as promo.

Lasting for 600 years, until the Norman Conquest of 1066, this era decided the future of a great kingdom that would become England.<br/><br/>Designing your Earl Deck before play begins is one of the key features of the game. Ortus Regni is a deck-design game, rather than a deck-building game &mdash; that is, you are entirely in control of the deck that you will begin play with in a game of Ortus Regni. Several canonical Ortus Regni deck design concepts exist &mdash; such as a Lord deck, an Army (Land) deck, a Politics deck, or an Emissary (Monk) deck, and more &mdash; but such concepts are only the start of your design options. The Earl Deck you put together can be a subtle hybrid of several concepts, or something entirely different and unusual.<br/><br/>Your opponents in Ortus Regni will have access to the exact same suite of cards that you do when they design their own Earl Decks for game play. So it all comes down to your choices and your strategies! There is also tactical space during a game to zig and zag, even if you find yourself against an Earl Deck design that you did not anticipate. You might pull out an unexpected win nonetheless if you play your deck well.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": {"240596": "English first edition"}, "average": "7.49543", "name": "Ortus Regni", "playingtime": "50", "boardgamemechanic": {"2664": "Deck / Pool Building"}, "age": "14", "boardgameexpansion": {}, "usersrated": "247", "boardgamesubdomain": {"4667": "Customizable Games"}, "boardgamefamily": {"22783": "Admin: Better Description Needed!"}}, "159470": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3255873.jpg", "poll": {}, "boardgamedesigner": {"75371": {"name": "Nightsorrow Chou"}}, "statistics": {}, "yearpublished": "2013", "maxplayers": "4", "boardgameartist": {"88814": "Loreine"}, "boardgamepublisher": {"29636": {"name": "EmperorS4"}}, "maxplaytime": "30", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3255873_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "30", "boardgamecategory": {"1009": {"name": "Abstract Strategy"}}, "description": "In Jungle Rumble, you're in charge of a herd of cats &mdash; yes, cats &mdash; and those cats must do your bidding in order to mine, build plantations, water your farm, and recruit more helpful kitties.<br/><br/>Each round, a number of action tiles are available.
