It was released in 2003 for the Sony PlayStation.<br/><br/>Gameplay:<br/><br/>Turnabout consists of 100 levels, but the player can only access them in groups of ten, requiring most of the levels to be completed to reach the next ten. The game's main feature is the ability to rotate the stage 90 degrees in either direction (but not 180), causing all the dynamic elements to fall in that direction. The stages are grids, being about 16x16 at maximum size. The goal is to get all the colored pieces to disappear. There are colored balls, which are dynamic, and colored blocks, which are stationary and often act as blockages. When one ball (let's say red) collides with another (red) ball (or a red block, or many other red balls, etc), all of the (red) pieces that just touched now disappear. This repeats until the player is stuck (losing) or the player makes all colored pieces disappear (clear).<br/><br/>Although this may seem easy, the levels introduce a number of obstacles. Colorless blocks are dynamic pieces, which, unlike balls, are not limited to taking up only one space. Colorless blocks may have very complicated and specific shapes that make progression difficult. Colorless blocks can also not be matched, meaning they exist for the entire round. Balls and colored blocks can have five different colors (red, blue, yellow, green, purple). Each color can only match with itself, and can touch a block of a different color without disappearing. Speaking of colors, one of the more elaborate gimmicks of Turnabout is the 1 red ball 2 red blocks situation. In order to clear the level, all the red must be cleared. However, if we match one ball with one block, then the other block will still remain, requiring the level to be restarted. The solution is to get the ball to touch both the blocks simultaneously, matching all 3 at once. There are also other situations, including 2 red balls 1 red block, where the player must match all 3 at once while keeping the red balls separated at all times.<br/><br/>This game does include a level editor, where you can save a certain number of levels on your memory card and play them anytime. You will be limited to 9 colorless blocks, however.<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;Turnabout (video game)&quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "155668": {"boardgamedesigner": {"66008": {"name": "Steven Cole"}}, "average": "6.95294", "poll": {}, "name": "Tradecraft: A Spy Game", "playingtime": "30", "minplayers": "3", "boardgamemechanic": {"2041": "Card Drafting"}, "yearpublished": "2014", "usersrated": "17", "maxplayers": "6", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1942109_t.jpg", "boardgameartist": {"66008": "Steven Cole"}, "statistics": {}, "boardgamepublisher": {"1001": {"name": "(Web published)"}}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1942109.jpg", "boardgameversion": {"233751": "Print and Play edition"}, "maxplaytime": "30", "boardgamecategory": {"1002": {"name": "Card Game"}}, "age": "12", "minplaytime": "30", "description": "trade&middot;craft  (tr\u0101d&prime;kr\u0103ft&prime;) n. <br/>The methods used in clandestine operations such as espionage.<br/><br/>Lock picks.

Tracks contains two types of spaces : straight section, or curve. The average length of a lap is between 40 spaces (fast tracks) and 60 spaces (long tracks). For the moment, there are 9 tracks : Monaco, Canada, Belgium, Japan, Italy, Catalunya, Singapore, China, Le mans.<br/><br/>Grand-prix Elite uses plastic racing cars (dimension = 27 mm long).<br/>Six-sided dice are used for Wear tests, Skid tests, etc...<br/>Optional rules include weather variation and Event cards.<br/><br/>HOW TO PLAY : each player has a certain number of Speed cards. In order to move his car he plays 1 Speed card. <br/>Then the Speed card goes to his dashboard : this is now the current speed of the car. <br/>Each turn, the player can increase or decrease this speed by 1 level. <br/>Also, extra movements are given by a Tyre-Setup card located in the dashboard. The Tyre-Setup card represents the strategy chosen for the car (soft, hard or rain tyres, aero grip, suspension, etc..)<br/>Once moved, a car can engage another car in order to gain its position.<br/><br/>Each player faces 3 challenges in this game :<br/>a) Damages. The number of Speed cards owned by the player is also the number of damages his car can absorb without consequences. Powerful Speed cards often leads to damages (due to engine wear or dangerous curve)...Some cars are fast but fragiles, so pit stops will be necessary in this case.<br/>b) Curves. Each curve has an optimal speed. If a car's speed exceeds the optimal speed while taking the curve, the car can goes off track (and possibly taking damages). <br/>However, a driver has 3 choices when his car is about to take a curve : short, medium, or long trajectory. With a short trajectory, you go faster, but it's risky. With a long trajectory, you take the curve more easily, but you become an easy prey if engaged by opponents...<br/>Here, tyre and set-up strategies are very important things for purpose of taking a curve.<br/>c) Ghost cars. In addition to his normal car, each player controls one or several Ghost cars. Ghost cars follow their own rules, and symbolize the bulk of lapped cars driven by anonymous drivers.

Every game is played over a series of rounds, as you and your opponents play character cards in an attempt to claim the Iron Throne for yourselves.<br/><br/>In each round, you pursue your own plans and seek to foil your opponents by playing character cards. Each turn, you will play a character card from your hand, adding to the court at King&rsquo;s Landing. You can advance your own prospects by playing your character cards cleverly, but certain rules govern exactly where you can place your character cards.<br/><br/>The first character cards must be played in a single row, forming the bottom row of the court. Once there are two cards in a row, you may play a card in a new row above them. The card that you play in the new row, however, must match the House of one of the two cards below it. In Game of Thrones: Westeros Intrigue, character cards are divided between House Stark, House Lannister, House Baratheon, and House Targaryen, and each player may have character cards from any of these Houses in his hand.<br/><br/>The court develops as you and your opponents play cards, but a player will eventually discover that he can no longer legally play a character card. Once this occurs, that player is eliminated and the round continues. A round ends when no one can play another character card, and whoever played the last character card wins the round. In Game of Thrones: Westeros Intrigue, you will play rounds equal to the number of players.<br/><br/>If you win a round of Game of Thrones: Westeros Intrigue, you reap the rewards by drawing an Iron Throne card, which cancels a number of your penalty points. Your opponents, on the other hand, must take penalty points equal to the number of character cards that they have left in their hand. Over the course of the game, players gain penalty points from having character cards at the end of the round, and reduce their penalty points by winning a round and drawing an Iron Throne card.

He then selects a card and uses the symbols rolled to conquer exactly one of the battle lines on this card (by placing the appropriate dice on that line). If he can do this, he then rolls the remaining dice, ideally conquering another line; if he can't conquer a line, he removes one die from play, then rolls again. His turn ends when either he conquers every line on the card (in which case he claims it) or he no longer has dice available to roll.<br/><br/>Each card is worth a number of victory points. You can conquer cards owned by other players, but you need to conquer an additional daimyo line in the process. If a player owns all the castles of one clan, however, those castles are secure and cannot be stolen.

With very few options and a will to survive, this world alliance became an inevitable truth in the eyes of many of the factions&rsquo; leaders. Even factions who hated one another had nothing left but each other. Under the guidance of the Order of Gamelyn, a Capital City was chosen and factions from all over the world came to call this city their new home.

It had no specific name, because its inhabitants did not feel the need to differentiate it from others, and, indeed, hardly knew of the existence of realms other than their own. &ldquo;The World,&rdquo; they called it, and it was enough for them. Its inhabitants were very different from each other: Dogs, Cats, Mice, Foxes, Wolves and more shared the World. Of course, they were different from each other, as I said, but harmony reigned between them due to an old treaty of truce, imposed on them in the first centuries after decades of bitter conflict. Together, they formed the People.<br/><br/>The People were animals, or Animals: they could speak, move, grasp objects, create, think and do everything a human can do. But they were not alone: the world was also inhabited by animals, those with a lowercase initial. Animals were... just animals, and therefore were their prey. For every People there was also its animal.<br/><br/>The World was formed by a small continent, about the size of what we call Australia. It was surrounded by sea and a single large river, with many streams flowing into and out of it, and covered by dense forests. Within these forests, in small and large clearings, stood the Cities of the People, spread all over the world according to the customs of each: some on treetops, some underground, some outdoor. Not all People built Cities, but you could find any kind of Animal in them, from the most shy to the most social, each with its commitments.<br/><br/>If any of us had been able to move in that idyllic world, he would see magnificent places and views, with rich Cities in a Renaissance style surrounded by wilderness, with fields and farms here and there spotting the green masses of woods and forests. A virtually perfect world.<br/><br/>What People did not know was that, beyond the endless ocean that surrounded the World, there was a &ldquo;real&rdquo; world, with islands, continents, archipelagos and all the rest. In one of these places magic was known and used. In that distant kingdom, the Prince in charge was engaged in a fierce battle against the militia of the Witch Queen, an evil spellcaster looking for fame and power that had begun an assault against the main local rulers. With his sword and shield, the Prince had reached the inner sanctum of the Witch Queen, when her, in a desperate attempt to save her life, attempted to cast a powerful spell of destruction, to eliminate once and for all the threat of the Prince.<br/><br/>But something went wrong: some say that the hero had killed the Witch Queen shortly before she ended to utter the spell, some say that this was diverted from a good heart or from his armor, some say other things. The fact is that the Prince killed the Witch Queen, dissolving most of her spells and then removing all forms of power to her armies. Shortly thereafter, he had the victory.<br/><br/>But her own power was far too strong to die. Instead, it left her body just before her death, and travelled through dimensions. When it found the World, it decided to stay there.<br/><br/>What happened next is confused, partly because it happened very quickly, partly because it happened differently in each area of the World. The only thing all the Animals saw and understood was about the color of the sky, which changed from blue to red. Blood red, bright red, a colour not easily forgotten. It was a flash, but remained in the memory of all, to the point that the day went down in history of the World as the &ldquo;Red Day.&rdquo; From that moment everything changed. The Strange made its entrance into the World, a force hitherto unknown, but living, although impalpable, and can change everything it enters in contact with. It penetrated into the trees and mountains, into rivers, animals and People, deeply changing many of them. The trees began to speak, some to move, some more... to eat. The leaves of some oaks near a bend of the great river became metal, rocks along the estuary still drip blood.

Not all People built Cities, but you could find any kind of Animal in them, from the most shy to the most social, each with its commitments.<br/><br/>If any of us had been able to move in that idyllic world, he would see magnificent places and views, with rich Cities in a Renaissance style surrounded by wilderness, with fields and farms here and there spotting the green masses of woods and forests. A virtually perfect world.<br/><br/>What People did not know was that, beyond the endless ocean that surrounded the World, there was a &ldquo;real&rdquo; world, with islands, continents, archipelagos and all the rest. In one of these places magic was known and used. In that distant kingdom, the Prince in charge was engaged in a fierce battle against the militia of the Witch Queen, an evil spellcaster looking for fame and power that had begun an assault against the main local rulers. With his sword and shield, the Prince had reached the inner sanctum of the Witch Queen, when her, in a desperate attempt to save her life, attempted to cast a powerful spell of destruction, to eliminate once and for all the threat of the Prince.<br/><br/>But something went wrong: some say that the hero had killed the Witch Queen shortly before she ended to utter the spell, some say that this was diverted from a good heart or from his armor, some say other things. The fact is that the Prince killed the Witch Queen, dissolving most of her spells and then removing all forms of power to her armies. Shortly thereafter, he had the victory.<br/><br/>But her own power was far too strong to die. Instead, it left her body just before her death, and travelled through dimensions. When it found the World, it decided to stay there.<br/><br/>What happened next is confused, partly because it happened very quickly, partly because it happened differently in each area of the World. The only thing all the Animals saw and understood was about the color of the sky, which changed from blue to red. Blood red, bright red, a colour not easily forgotten. It was a flash, but remained in the memory of all, to the point that the day went down in history of the World as the &ldquo;Red Day.&rdquo; From that moment everything changed. The Strange made its entrance into the World, a force hitherto unknown, but living, although impalpable, and can change everything it enters in contact with. It penetrated into the trees and mountains, into rivers, animals and People, deeply changing many of them. The trees began to speak, some to move, some more... to eat. The leaves of some oaks near a bend of the great river became metal, rocks along the estuary still drip blood. It is said that somewhere in the woods further away from the Cities of the People exists a living being formed with all the bodies of an old pack of wolves&hellip;<br/><br/>"}, "155718": {"rpgitemversion": {"233850": "PDF version"}, "statistics": {}, "name": "The Spellbook", "rpgproducer": {"54032": "Michael Tangherlini"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1942922.jpg", "usersrated": "0", "average": "0", "rpggenre": {"1103": "Animal (Anthropomorphic)"}, "rpg": {"24625": "Whispering Willows"}, "rpgcategory": {"2108": "Sourcebook (rules/options to enhance play)"}, "poll": {}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1942922_t.jpg", "description": "From Introduction:<br/><br/>This booklet collects additional rules expanding concepts regarding the Strange in play.

There are ways to avoid this, of course, but wouldn&rsquo;t it be better to have some traps that are built specifically in order to be exciting and engaging encounters in and of themselves?<br/><br/>Enter the mythic trap: these dastardly devices make use of mythic rules and mythic power to come alive in your game, in more ways than one. A mythic trap acts like a monster or NPC, taking turns in initiative order, and using (under the GM&rsquo;s guidance) one or more of its devilish and hazardous components. They provide traps that are fun and engaging on several levels, and cannot be ignored in the same way that a simple pit trap or poison dart trap can be.<br/><br/>This book introduces rules for mythic traps, which can be run easily in both mythic and non-mythic campaigns, and also provides four specific mythic traps to serve as examples. Brave the efreeti&rsquo;s tomb trap, dodging fireball-spitting statues while navigating over a rune-covered floor to reach safety.

Players can try to achieve one of three different victory conditions:<br/><br/><br/>     Leadership: Be the leader &mdash; i.e., have more clan figures than any other player &mdash; of territories containing at least six opponents' clans.<br/>     Land: Have your clans present in at least six different territories.<br/>     Religion: Have your clans present in territories that collectively contain at least six sanctuaries.<br/><br/><br/>Over the course of the game, players also earn deeds, typically chanted by bards or engraved by master crafters, that reduce by one the magic total of six for any condition. While one victory condition is enough to claim the title of King, a game of experienced players usually has a tight balance of power, emphasizing the leadership of the capital of the island.<br/><br/>At the start of each round, players draft a hand of four action cards (with 13 action cards for three players and 17 for four players) during the Assembly. Action cards not played at the end of one season are not held for the next. Players also have access to leader cards for the territories that allow it and where they were elected leader during the assembly. Each Assembly reallocates those cards. Finally, they collect &quot;epic tales&quot; cards that depict the deeds of the ancient Irish gods and heroes, like Cuchulainn, the Dagda, Lugh and many others. These will be kept and used to inspire the clans and achieve extraordinary feats...under the right circumstances. The cards provide a variety of actions: adding clans, moving clans, building/exploring, and special actions.<br/><br/>Careful drafting, hand management, bluffing (especially once players understand the importance of passing their turn), good timing, and a precise understanding of the balance of power are the keys to victory. After a discovery game you'll be ready for a full and epic game, where an undisputed player will be king by the Assembly for his merit and wisdom.<br/><br/>While Inis has &quot;dudes&quot; that are &quot;on a map&quot;, it's a beginner's mistake to play this as a battle game because eliminating other clans reduces your chances of scoring a Leadership victory condition. Peace among different clans, with or without a clear territory leader, is the usual outcome of a clan's movement. Battles will occur, of course, as the Celtic clans can be unruly and a good player will listen to his clan's people (i.e., his hand of cards). That battle aspect is reflected in the clan's miniatures representing warriors. Woodsmen, shepherds and traders complete the set of twelve minis for each player; these occupations have no impact on the game, but give it flavor.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": {"319189": "English first edition"}, "average": "7.81232", "name": "Inis", "playingtime": "90", "boardgamemechanic": {"2080": "Area Control / Area Influence"}, "age": "14", "usersrated": "3426", "boardgamesubdomain": {"5497": "Strategy Games"}, "boardgamefamily": {"11546": "Country: Ireland"}}, "155822": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1965055.jpg", "is_expanded_by": {"187356": {"name": "Krosmaster: Arena \u2013 Arty"}}, "poll": {}, "statistics": {}, "yearpublished": "2014", "maxplayers": "4", "boardgamepublisher": {"4785": {"name": "Ghenos Games"}}, "boardgameintegration": {"203719": "Krosmaster Arena 2.0"}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1965055_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "5", "boardgamecategory": {"1041": {"name": "Children's Game"}}, "boardgamehonor": {"26779": "2014 Golden Geek Best Children's Board Game Nominee"}, "description": "A simpler version of Krosmaster: Arena, aimed at younger players (ages 7+), and targeted for mass market sale.

Sadly, more times than not, that shiny new toy slips out of the fingers, or misses completely, leading the victim to try insert more cash and repeat these steps.<br/><br/>The Unstable Crane Game is an up to 4-player, simultaneous rendition of this traditional arcade game, where the players each place their &quot;claw tokens&quot; over the various prizes on the table and wait to see if they snag it. Each round, the players flip the top cards of their Player decks, and either get to move their claw, drop their target, or claim their prize according to their card. The first player to achieve a Prize collection worth at least 10 points will be declared the winner! Good luck...<br/><br/><br/>    Notes*<br/><br/><br/>1. There are 3 kinds of cards in each player's deck for simulating their claw's behavior: &quot;Not Yet&quot; (they still have time and may move their claw over another prize.), &quot;Oops! Unlucky!&quot; (their claw snagged a prize, but dropped it while attempting to lift or carry it.), or &quot;You Got It!&quot;(the player's claw successfully claimed a Prize.)<br/><br/>2. Multiple players can try for the same prize. However, since the actions determined by each player flipping the card of their Player Deck occur at roughly the same time, should multiple players draw their &quot;You got it&quot; card in the same round and be over the same prize, their claws instead interfere with each other and play resumes as if they'd dropped the prize instead!<br/><br/>3. &quot;Set collection&quot; is also used lightly in this game. Should a player claim at each 3 prizes that share a type, that player is considered an &quot;enthusiast&quot; and each prize of that type in their collection is worth an additional point.<br/><br/>"}, "155903": {"statistics": {}, "name": "The Hardy Boys: The Perfect Crime", "videogamemode": {"2149": "Single-Player"}, "videogameversion": {"234206": "North American Windows edition"}, "average": "0", "videogameseries": {"24682": "The Hardy Boys"}, "videogametheme": {"2280": "Crime"}, "videogamegenre": {"2152": "Adventure"}, "videogamefranchise": {"6533": "Nancy Drew"}, "videogameplatform": {"4977": "Windows"}, "usersrated": "0", "poll": {}, "description": "User Summary<br/><br/>A series of bizarre crimes hits Bayport, and it's up to the Hardy Boys to aid the police in finding the culprit.

Edgewalkers believe in the duality of all things. Life and death, or light and darkness, for that matter, are just two sides to the same coin. How otherwise rational creatures, such as paladins, could get so riled up about one half of a duality is quite confusing to the neophyte edgewalker, though this soon passes given their philosophy's capacity to accept things as what they are.<br/><br/>The training of an edgewalker resembles that of a martial, ascetic monk, while also resembling that of an assassin or other such stalker of the shadows. Experienced edgewalkers are just as cunning as they are wise and revel in the eventual realization that their training is a smattering of that of all other professions. By being trained in such a manner, edgewalkers understand the nature of their adversaries as extrapolated facets of themselves, granting themselves a significant advantage in battle.<br/><br/>Toeing the razor's edge between many paths, the edgewalker's journey and outlook tends to be a source of amusement or confusion for all those he takes on as traveling companions, but there is no doubting that his strange combination of monk and assassin, light and darkness, and wisdom and naivet&eacute; are surprisingly effective when brought to bear.<br/><br/>Product Features<br/><br/>     The edgewalker base class, a combination assassin/shadowdancer/monk base class whose primary innovation is two &quot;ki&quot; pools, one for light and one for shadow.

Every few screens you will be rewarded with bonus cities to replace any that have been lost.<br/><br/>SPACE RESCUE<br/>Protect the humans from the marauding aliens. If they manage to pick up your humans and carry them to the top of the screen they will transform into fast moving mutants. Losing all 10 of your humans will cause you to enter hyperspace where the action becomes frantic.  Removing all aliens from a landscape will reward you with a bonus for each human remaining. The humans will be replenished every few screens. Watch out for the pods which when hit, explode into multiple swarmers and avoid taking too long because baiters will appear to hurry you along.<br/><br/>THE INVADERS<br/>Protect various well known landscapes around the world from alien invasion. Control your ship left and right along the bottom and shoot the relentlessly approaching invaders. Clearing a wave will advance you to the next level with ever closer opponents. Occasionally, a passing mother-ship can be hit for added bonus.<br/><br/>ALIEN RAIDERS<br/>Avoid swooping dive-bombing aliens whilst saving the universe. Hit aliens in flight for higher scores.<br/><br/>BUGS<br/>Destroy the multi-segmented creatures using your bug which is restricted to the bottom portion of the screen. However, you can move up and down to get a little closer to the action and jump over the top of creatures as they move closer. The bugs change direction and move ever downwards whenever they hit mushrooms. Once they reach the bottom they will then start upwards again. Use the DDT canisters wisely to destroy many segments simultaneously. As you progress through the levels, a number of different bugs and attack patterns will be revealed.<br/><br/>Source: The Publisher Website.<br/><br/>User Summary<br/><br/>The included games are not original arcade games.

The Allfather did not forge each of the first dwarves and set them in the mountains as one would precious gems. Nature was not woven as one would weave a tapestry. Instead, a booming voice called out unto the void at the beginning of everything. It named the earth and sky. It named the winds and water. It named the grasses and the fish, the trees and the and birds. It named everything, and everything came into being. Granted, the very idea of an alternate beginning makes a number of religions very upset and more than a little uncomfortable. Those who make these claims are the truenamers, and, moreover, they claim to have found the First Language that made it all happen.<br/><br/>The Libram of the First Language is a reboot of the concept of codified truemagic. First introduced to the d20 system back when version 3.5 of Dungeons and Dragons was officially supported, the original truenamer was the original skill-based caster, a brilliant idea in theory, but was plagued by mechanics that forced a specific playstyle on both the player and the Game Master. Any deviation from a campaign wherein monsters had a CR that was exactly equal to the party level resulted in either an overpowered or totally useless party member. This almost always resulted in a creatively-starved GM, a bored player, or both.<br/><br/>Remastered herein, the truenamer is, as always, a flavorful, alternate approach to magic, but now features mechanics that do not force specific behaviors on the entire game to make it work.<br/><br/>This new truenamer's design focuses on the following main points.<br/><br/>     The truenamer features a skill-based casting system based on the level of the spell to be cast, not the HD of the target to be affected. This removes the lingering uncertainty of whether or not the next combat will include an enemy that is effectively impossible to cast upon.<br/>     Checks made to cast spells resemble concentration checks rather than skill checks, thus eliminating the need to build in safeguards against players who find ways to get +50 to skill checks by level 10. There is no longer the inherent need to be a powergamer or be useless.<br/>     Inflections, the system's metamagic equivalent, do not simply add +20 to the skill check needed to cast the spell. Instead, the DC increase is more modest, but the DC of that particular spell increases sharply for the rest of the day. Players must choose whether they want a few boosted uses of their favorite spells or many unboosted uses, thus making every round potentially very important for the rest of the day.<br/>     Reversible spells, the absolute coolest part of the classic truenamer, have been salvaged and are present in the largest two of the four codices presented in this product.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>This product features the following.<br/><br/>     The truenamer base class, remastered to work within any campaign framework.<br/>     The orator archetype, which focuses on what politicians would be like were they able to make their claims come true<br/>     The truescribe archetype, who specializes in writing the First Language, weird tonality and all<br/>     The verminspeaker archetype, who specializes in using the First Language to elicit an effect in mindless creatures<br/>     10 feats, including a chain that can help counter a truenamer in play<br/>     210 distinct spell effects in four codices: the Codex of Heart and Mind, the Codex of Artifice, the Codex of Far-Flung Spheres, and the Codex of the Realized Vision<br/>     The speaker of the word prestige class, a divine caster who has found the Truth in the First Language<br/>     The willshackler, a specialized truenamer who studies proper nouns in the First Language<br/>     The wordsworn defender, a martial truenamer who specializes in tower shields<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>"}, "155507": {"statistics": {}, "name": "Decahedron (Issue 2 - Feb 2014)", "rpgproducer": {"46692": "Larry Moore"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1940170.png", "usersrated": "0", "average": "0", "rpgissue": {"21072": "Decahedron"}, "rpgissuearticle": {"114892": "Caer Urdak"}, "rpg": {"20439": "BareBones Fantasy Role-playing Game"}, "rpgissueversion": {"233473": "PDF version"}, "poll": {}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1940170_t.png", "description": "From publisher blurb:<br/><br/>Decahedron is a magazine designed to support the BareBones Fantasy RPG.

It is a trick-taking game without trumps, in which the object is to win the last trick.<br/><br/>Spar is usually played by 2, 3 or 4 players, but it is possible for up to 7 to play. The game uses 35 cards from a standard international 52-card pack, the cards of each suit ranking from high to low: A, K, Q, J, 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, but the Ace of Spades is normally not used, so the highest card in that suit is the King.<br/><br/>Play<br/><br/>Whoever played the highest card of the suit that the first player led is the winner of the trick. The cards played are not gathered in but remain in a face up pile. The winner of the trick leads any card from hand to begin the next trick, playing it face up on top of the pile, and once again the other players must each play a card: this must be the same suit as the card that was led if possible, otherwise any card.<br/><br/>This continues until five tricks have been played.<br/><br/>Scoring<br/><br/>Whoever wins the fifth and last trick wins the hand and scores:<br/><br/>3 points if the winning card is a 6;<br/>    2 points if the winning card is a 7;<br/>    1 point for winning with any other card - 8 or higher.<br/><br/>The winner of the hand deals the next hand, and therefore plays last to the first trick of the next hand. The session continues for as long as the players wish - there is no fixed number of deals or target score that ends the session.<br/><br/>Variations<br/><br/>Two other versions of this game exists: Jeu de Carte, which is played in Benin, and Sipa, a game played in Togo. Both share similar rules however.<br/><br/>Jeu de Carte<br/><br/>It is played with 31 cards (all the cards from Ace down to Seven except the Ace of Spades).<br/><br/>Players play their cards in front of them, rather than in a single pile in the centre.
