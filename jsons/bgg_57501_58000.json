GURPS Spaceships 3: Warships and Space Pirates provides ships and game mechanics for exciting space combat between medium and large vessels. It includes an overview of space navy and pirate operations; it also features GURPS Spaceships statistics for dozens of sample warships, from patrol ships and frigates to star cruisers and battleships. Tactical maneuvering rules expand the GURPS Spaceships combat system to handle hex-based combat and chases using counters or miniatures, and additional rules cover squadron-level command tasks. In space, there's nothing personal between two enemy ships . . . just hard vacuum and hard choices.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;This is the third volume in the GURPS Spaceships series by David Pulver (co-author of GURPS Fourth Edition). It requires only the GURPS Basic Set and GURPS Spaceships. GURPS Space is recommended for characters and campaigns; GURPS Spaceships 2: Traders, Liners, and Transports provides civilian ships and cargo to loot or protect.&quot;<br/><br/>"}, "57502": {"rpgitemversion": {"12895": "First Edition"}, "statistics": {}, "name": "Vampire Storytellers Screen (2nd Edition)", "rpgproducer": {"13954": "Sam Chupp"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic566985.jpg", "usersrated": "9", "rpgsetting": {"2591": "World of Darkness (cWoD Modern)"}, "average": "6.11111", "rpggenre": {"441": "Horror (Supernatural)"}, "rpg": {"421": "Vampire: The Masquerade"}, "rpgcategory": {"2086": "Accessory (dice, maps, screens, cards)"}, "poll": {}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic566985_t.jpg", "description": "From the back of the book:<br/><br/>&quot;Straight from the pages of Vampire comes the tragically hip, angst-ridden, gut-wrenching, stomach-churning Storytellers Screen, suitable for gaming, framing or rat flamb&eacute;ing.

This book will teach you everything you need to know about being part of this elite fighting force. You will learn how to fight, how to think, and how to survive. You will learn to use power suits, Morita rifles and other tools. You will learn how to stare death in the eye and laugh.<br/><br/>This book details the process of becoming Mobile Infantry. It covers every step from recruitment through the first mission. If your players all want to be Mobile Infantry, this book provides adventures at every stage &ndash; you can run them through select pieces or use the entire book as an introductory campaign. If the Player Characters are not all Mobile Infantry, this book can be used to provide the ones who are with valuable background. The Starship Troopers corebook provides all the rules necessary to create Mobile Infantry characters, but it does not go into details about their training. This book does that, offering players a chance to see exactly what their characters went through and thus think about how those events affected them. Players who read this book will have a better grasp of their Player Characters, and can create more believable figures because they know understand the Player Character&rsquo;s history.<br/><br/>Boot Camp is divided into four sections. The first section deals with how characters become recruits. The second section talks about the training itself, and details the boot camp where training takes place. The third section discusses the characters&rsquo; placement after their graduation from recruit to private, and gives suggestions for introductory missions. The final section, Escort Duty, provides a full adventure that ties back to the training characters received in Section Two. Each of the first three sections offers smaller adventure suggestions and these can be used to fine-tune Player Characters and solidify the group before the larger scenario at the end. But whether you choose to use one section or the entire book and, whether you are a player or the Games Master, this book will tell you how the Mobile Infantry are created from lesser men, and what rites of passage they must endure to gain that privilege.<br/><br/>"}, "57586": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic567308.jpg", "poll": {}, "boardgamedesigner": {"8869": {"name": "Roberto Chiavini"}}, "statistics": {}, "yearpublished": "2009", "maxplayers": "2", "boardgameartist": {"10858": "Giulia Canova"}, "boardgamepublisher": {"6597": {"name": "TCS Games"}}, "maxplaytime": "30", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic567308_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "30", "boardgamecategory": {"1120": {"name": "Print & Play"}}, "description": "Third in entry in TCS print &amp;

It's all generic, too, covering realistic, fantastic, and superscience troops at every tech level, and providing guidelines for customizing their quality, special training, and equipment. And it never loses sight of the fact that GURPS is a roleplaying game -- every hero gets a chance to shine, and the rules emphasize what the PCs do and what happens to them.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;GURPS Mass Combat requires only the GURPS Basic Set, Fourth Edition.&quot;<br/><br/>"}, "57627": {"rpgitemversion": {"13040": "hard cover"}, "poll": {}, "name": "Herz des Reiches", "rpgproducer": {"24459": "Ralf Berszuck"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic567794.jpg", "usersrated": "5", "rpgsetting": {"2005": "Aventurien"}, "average": "6.98", "rpgissuearticle": {"92270": "Das tote Schneiderlein"}, "rpggenre": {"961": "Fantasy"}, "rpg": {"608": "Das Schwarze Auge (DSA) (4th Edition)"}, "statistics": {}, "rpgcategory": {"2108": "Sourcebook (rules/options to enhance play)"}, "rpgseries": {"2824": "Aventurische Regionen"}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic567794_t.jpg", "description": "User Summary:<br/>This sourcebook deals with the centre of the great Middle Empire in the continent of Aventurien, calles Mittelreich.<br/>It&acute;s organization reminds of the Holy Roman Empire.

The Big Six consists of six separate tasks, which help students focus research, solve problems and make decisions. The players must have received instruction in The Big Six before playing this game.<br/><br/>The board game consists of a series of questions which players need to answer correctly in order to score points and cycle through the Big Six process twice. The game board is divided into six areas that represent each step. These areas are flanked by &quot;rooms&quot; which occupy the four corners of the board. The rooms describe locations in which Big Six activities typically take place: the Classroom, the Library Media Center, the Home, and the Group Study (where students might work collaboratively on projects).<br/><br/>The game is a linear race game which continues until all the players have finished. The first player to finish is not necessarily the winner. Nuts and Bolts has been designed to reward understanding the Big Six more than the roll of the die. Those players who have answered questions most deftly accrue the greatest number of points.

It compiles the original adventures Alptraum ohne Ende, Unsterbliche Gier, and Grenzenlose Macht into a single volume. It also adds a campaign overview, pre-generated characters, and background information.<br/><br/>Warning: Spoilers ahead!<br/><br/>The campaign is suitable for characters starting with roughly 5000 points of experience. They start at a fair in Baliho from where they set out to investigate the burning of a priest of Tsa by a mob in the small village of Dragenfeld. They compete with a group of Prios followers and an inspector of the secret police. Arriving in Dragenfeld the adventurers find the village destroyed and the surrounding lands withered. The temple of Tsa has been desecrated by an evil wizard. When he is destroyed, the characters find out that they have been moments too late. The spirit of the long-dead Borbarad has been released into the world to wreak havoc in the following adventures. At the end of the events, the eye of one of the characters changes into a glowing red ruby which makes him the first of the Marked Ones. This concludes the first adventure Alptraum ohne Ende (Endless Nightmare).<br/><br/>The second adventure is Unsterbliche Gier (Immortal Craving). It seems at first not related to the events of Alptraum ohne Ende. The adventurers are called to the duchy of Weiden where they reveal and fight an infestation of vampires. It was caused by the dark elf Pardona in her attempt to steal enough life force to form a new body for Borbarad's spirit. At the climax of the adventure, the characters battle Pardona and the arch vampire Walmir von Riebeshoff in their sinister tower, and one of the characters becomes the second Marked One.<br/><br/>Grenzenlose Macht (Infinite Might) leads the characters to the ravaged city of Greifenfurt. They are hired by the monastery of Arras de Mott to investigate and prevent acts of sabotage that jeopardize the reconstruction of the monastery. Unknown to them, the head of the monks was replaced by a shapechanging demon that tries to build a portal to the Valley of Elements and a focus for magical energy. In the valley, Borbarad wants to create his new staff from Seelenstamm, a gigantic ancient tree. The attacks on the monastery are masterminded by Archon Megalon, a druid the characters may have encountered before and whom they will not remember with joy. After some events in the monastery, the arrival of the inquisition will force the characters to escape and enter the Valley of Elements, where they battle Borbarad's minions. They come back to Arras de Mott to destroy the astral focus. Here they meet the first time with the real Borbarad who bathes in the magical energy. The destruction of the astral focus delays Borbarad's plans, but also destroys the monastery, which is the end of this third adventure.<br/><br/>"}, "57705": {"rpgitemversion": {"13177": "La Faucille Noire (Schmidt France)"}, "poll": {}, "name": "Die Schwarze Sichel", "rpgproducer": {"3": "(Uncredited)"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic569729.jpg", "usersrated": "5", "rpgsetting": {"2005": "Aventurien"}, "average": "5.25", "statistics": {}, "rpggenre": {"961": "Fantasy"}, "rpg": {"1189": "Das Schwarze Auge (DSA) (1st Edition)"}, "rpgcategory": {"2136": "Solitaire Adventure"}, "rpgseries": {"3272": "Basis Abenteuer"}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic569729_t.jpg", "description": "Translated from the back:<br/>Down in the valleys of the 'Schwarze Sichel' (Black Sickle) it is not so dangerous as the name of the mountain range suggests.

It compiles the original adventures Pforte des Grauens and Bastrabuns Bann into a single volume, and adds a new adventure: Schatten im Zwielicht. It also presents background information and ideas for additional adventures.<br/><br/>Warning: Spoilers ahead!<br/><br/>The first adventure in the book is Pforte des Grauens (Portal of Dread). After Borbarad's temporary defeat, the characters head to Punin, where they are sent to investigate the theft of large amounts of the magic metal Endurium on the isle of Maraskan. The metal should have been transported to Punin, but never arrived. The sea voyage from Khunchom to Tuzak goes not as expected and the party is stranded on the Maraskan shores north of their destination. They have to find their way through the jungles where they meet Achaz, the lizardmen. The Achaz want the characters to return an artifact that was robbed from them, a mission they can accept or decline.<br/><br/>After days in the jungle, the party finds the Endurium mine, human sacrifices and a demon that is forced to mine the Endurium ore. The Endurium has already been moved away from the mine, but the thieves also been slain. The characters can track the murders to the Friedhof der Seeschlangen (Graveyard of the Sea Serpents) where followers of Borbarad and lizardmen try to open a portal to let a demonic army into the world. After the destruction of the cultists, the adventurers find the artifact they were sent to recover for the good lizardmen tribe. When they bring it back they fight a ritual duel, and one of them becomes the third Marked One. At last they reach the city of Tuzak and reveal an infiltrator in the ruler's palace. They find Borbarad himself in disguise and finally fight him and force him to flee, capturing his staff.<br/><br/>In Bastrabuns Bann (Bastrabun's Banishment), Borbarad is able to widen his influence. An ancient spell - Bastrabuns Bann - held off the lizardmen from invading the lands of the Tulamids in former times. It is thought that this spell can be used against the invading  demon forces, if only the relics are found that aided in casting the original banishment. In the desert and mountains they discover another evil wizard who summoned the arch demon Asfaloth. Asfaloth creates an army of insectoid creatures and is threating to release the Great Swarm to conquer the Tulamid lands for himself. While the characters can defeat him, this only strengthens Borbarad who did not intend to share with the arch demon.<br/><br/>The last adventure of this book is a completely new one: Schatten im Zwielicht (Shadows in the Twilight) It was designed to tie together several loose threads of the original campaign.<br/><br/>At the start of the adventure, the party almost get's poisoned, but are saved by a member of the Shadows, a secret organization of dark mages opposing Borbarad. They are invited to participate in assassination operations against Borbarad's followers throughout Aventurien. After a few successful, though ethically questionable, attacks, a large-scale assault on Maraskan leads the party and a large fleet of ships manned by almost all Shadows into a trap.

The third adventure - Die Letzte Schlacht des Wolfes - is a compilation of three adventures that have been released on the internet and in magazines. The first two modules presented here are part of the side line that depicts events in the wake of Borbarad's rise. They can be experienced by the characters of the main campaign, or can be used to show uninvolved characters a glimpse of the Horrors of Borbarad's demonic armies.<br/><br/>Warning: Spoilers ahead!<br/><br/>In Goldene Bl&uuml;ten auf Blauem Grund (Golden Blossoms on Blue Ground), followers of Borbarad plan a new march of the ogres. The last one happened years ago and was described in the adventure Mehr als 1000 Oger. The characters can prevent this from happening, but are driven from vanguard of Borbarad's armies to the amazon stronghold Kurkum where they help with evacuating the surrounding villages and preparing the defenses. They can repel many attacks and stop saboteurs, but a traitor manages to call a demon winter upon Kurkum. The final assault can be beaten back at first, but the death of amazon queen Yppolita leads to the destruction of Kurkum that the characters cannot prevent.<br/><br/>Die Letzte Schlacht des Wolfs (The Last Battle of the Wolf) takes place after the fall of Kurkum. Their flight takes the party of characters to the next battlefield of Eslamsbr&uuml;ck, where also the next defeat waits for them. The prince of Tobrien falls, and the characters escape to Ysilia, where the prince's brother, Bernfried, gather's fresh troops. To be made duke, Bernfried needs the insignia that were stolen by a traitor. The party has to operate behind enemy lines, and on their return have to participate in the next large battle that at last can stop the troops of Borbarad. At least for a while. Winter has set in and both sides prepare for action in spring.  A ruse leads most of the troops away from Ysilia, and the city falls before the black hordes, driving the characters before them.<br/><br/>The third adventure starts in Punin where a convent of mages tries to  bring Rohal back, the emperor that defeated Borbarad 400 years ago.

Count Dracula did not appear on the printed page until 1897; however, the Victorian vampire myth was alive and well in the forms of Lord Ruthven, Varney, and Carmilla. Other monstrosities in the same mould included Brunhilda and Lady Ducayne. Pharos had a different spin on the mummy, while the Great God Pan destroyed the lives of mortals.<br/><br/>And all of these literary creations paled in comparison to the factual and all-too-human Victorian monstrosity, the anonymous and uncaught serial killer known as Jack the Ripper, as well as the urban legend of Spring-heeled Jack.<br/><br/>While most of the monstrosities collected herein are from the Imperial Age or the overall Victorian era, exceptions have been made where the author has felt that the monstrosity would fit in well within the context of an Imperial Age campaign. Also, while care has been made to ensure that each monstrosity adheres to its source material as closely as possible slight changes have been made for artistic license and compatibility with the core rules.<br/><br/>The Victorian Monstrosities follow the standard monster format.

After months of constant retreats and loss, the Don River offered a respite. Even though the river was partially frozen, crossing proved difficult for either side except at one of the four bridges which span it. Weather and time also proved to be a friend of Denikin one last time, as both sides had to fight freezing temperatures and slowed the rapid advance of the Red Army chasing them into Rostov, a small city at the time. Much of the Red forces that reached the city were to too small and the main body of the army was still several days away.<br/><br/>Denikin pulled his forces back to Bataisk and dug in and by the time the Red lead elements arrived, the Reds found themselves in a much weaker position because Denikin had gathered his units. Denikin planned for a quick offensive, one to retake Rostov and hopefully beyond to buy additional time before the inevitable. Retaking Rostov would also be a desperately needed morale boost. Thus, he gathered his last available Mk V tanks, aircraft, and reinforced his elite Volunteer Army. He suddenly struck, completely taking the Red units by surprise, routing many. Within a day or so, he entered Rostov, and pushed onto the suburbs along the fringe. The reversal was complete. Stunning. Morale rose. But, like the Germans and the Ardennes in 1944, the weight of the Red army was felt once it arrived. Bitter fighting in Rostov set the city on fire as the Whites fell back across the banks of the Don. It was their last hurrah!<br/><br/>The game comes with a 11x17&quot; map, 280 counters, rules.

To that end, the elements we include will be system-generic so that you can drop them into any campaign, no matter what system you use!<br/><br/>In order to make Star System more utilitarian, we&rsquo;ll be using generic terms when we describe characters, starships and creatures, which can be easily translated into your campaign&rsquo;s particular game system. Adamant Entertainment is providing this free introductory guide as a key to those terms, and as a special bonus, the previously released Space Opera Adventure Generator is incorporated into this guide free of charge!

To take a building you must pay its requirements -  some combination of money, workers and building materials. More difficult combinations yield more victory points.<br/><br/>Furthermore, not all of the available buildings on the table are ripe for the taking, as only the ones on the right and left hand border of the 2 rows of buildings are available for selection.<br/><br/>The game's core mechanic revolves around identical decks of 13 cards for each player, of which only 2 are played per round. But in addition to the card's function, the numerical combination of cards played is important (e.g. a card with a value of 3 and 4, result in the value 34) as the player with the lowest combined number acts first.<br/><br/>So not only is the start player constantly changing, but it is also possible that a planned action cannot be taken, as another player has already used the same role. Not all roles are exclusive, so the turn order will also determine whether your &quot;half of all pesos in the middle&quot; is half of eight, or half of four (if a player before you played the same card). Some roles allow you to tax others or steal from them, and some cards defend against this, so it's not all just collecting pieces in a solitary manner.

The idea of Frazed is simple, and a bit mischevious.<br/>Write a sentence or phrase that someone else would be unable or unwilling to say outloud one time through without stopping, within five seconds of recieving it.<br/><br/>Frazed challenges the players' creativity, vocabulary, acting skills, social inhibitions, concentration, knowledge of their friends and their silliness tolerance all at the same time.<br/><br/>Have you ever wanted to make your friends confess to a crime they didn't committ, make them sing out loud, stammer over the weirdest thing that comes to your mind, act like a fool or simply make the laugh till they are red in the face and crying? Well Here Is Your Chance!<br/><br/>The game consists of two parts. The Fraze card which details a type of sentence category along the lines of tongue twisters, compliments, insults, confessions, secrets, gibberish etc and a second deck of cards called Exploits. Exploits are ways in which the sentence should be read, or act as a distraction while trying to read the phrase. Exploit categories for example might be miming a death scene, talking in your best German accent, or reading the sentence really fast.<br/><br/>During any particular players' turn there are two people in an interaction. The Scribe and the Reciter; the Scribe has the challenge of choosing from a limited number of fraze and exploits that he believes the Reciter will find difficult to say in front of a group. He must consider several things, his personal knowledge of the Reciter, such as personal hang ups about saying something silly in front of a group, whether his spirit could say take the brunt awkwardness of confessing to something he didn't do, while perhaps talking like a munchkin.<br/><br/>The Reciter will have his/her social inhibitions challenged in simply performing in front of a group, pronouncing a made up word, or punching out a tongue twister. Since the Reciter has a very limited time to process what he/she is about to say it also provides a psycological component as it can sometimes be difficult to psyche oneself up under limited time constraints.<br/><br/>Points are awarded according to a simple scale, whether the Reciter was able to read the sentence out loud under duress without stopping, laughing, stammering etc, within five seconds, and whether he was able to perform the exploit to a satisfactory level.<br/><br/>There is a simple system where disagreements regarding the performance was acceptable or not, or whether the attempt was successful.<br/><br/>Buy a copy of Frazed Today!<br/><br/>Includes:<br/><br/>* fraze Deck (75 cards)<br/>    * exploit Deck (71 cards)<br/>    * Frazed Rules Deck (12 cards)<br/>    * frazed rules Document<br/><br/>"}, "57950": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic570217.jpg", "is_expanded_by": {"129012": {"name": "MERC: The Expansion"}}, "poll": {}, "boardgamedesigner": {"11384": {"name": "JT Smith"}}, "statistics": {}, "yearpublished": "2009", "maxplayers": "6", "boardgameartist": {"11384": "JT Smith"}, "boardgamepublisher": {"2456": {"name": "The Game Crafter, LLC"}}, "maxplaytime": "120", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic570217_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "120", "boardgamecategory": {"1069": {"name": "Modern Warfare"}}, "description": "From The Game Crafter's website:<br/><br/>&quot;MERC is a complex strategy game where each player hires and controls a team of mercenaries. You may play against each other, or cooperatively against the evil dictator Koen, and you may play individually or as teams. Either way, the goal is the same, to take control of the war torn tropical island of Tenagra.<br/><br/>Tenagra is a wealthy country full of industries. Taking control of those industries will finance your efforts. Along the way you'll pick up equipment and hire additional MERCs. You'll need to train guards to fortify and hold territory after you've taken it.<br/><br/>There are 50 unique MERCs for you to hire, each with their own personalities, special abilities, skills, and weaknesses. The right combination of MERCs will lead you to victory, but you'll have to compete to hire them against the other players who are also drawing from the same talent pool.<br/><br/>MERCs would be nothing without their equipment. The game offers more than 40 different types of equipment. There are various types of weapons; everything from a simple 9mm handgun, all the way up to a shoulder mounted assault weapon (SMAW). There are various types of armor and accessories. And you can even get vehicles like tanks and helicopters to assist in your conquest.<br/><br/>Every game of MERC is unique, because the map deck allows you to reconfigure the island of Tenagra so many ways. Plus, some times the best MERCs are killed in the first couple days on the island, so you have to fight your way to victory with their lesser counterparts. And don't forget that you can play as teams or individuals both in death-match and cooperatively.

The shrewd Trader may buy additional assets, while the cunning Thief can steal from other players.  The deck contains words which players combine into laws that everyone must obey.  The Trader might make a law stating The Theif loses 2 cards when they use an ability, which should put a stop to the Thief's meddling - for awhile.<br/><br/>Things get interesting when the Doctor, Priest and Banker manipulate existing laws, and when the Thief gives up his life of crime to swap professions with another player.  The result is a game which is never the same twice, and will keep you looking for new ways to turn the situation to your advantage.<br/><br/>Laws and Disorder is best played with 4-6 players and ample table space, although it makes for a longer and more strategic game with 2-3 players.

These products expand standard d20 rules to cover exciting new adventure opportunities ranging from chases to the fury of the open sea.<br/><br/>Why, then, did Adamant release Narrative Combat? D20 is, effectively, a tactical combat simulation with a thick gloss of other things thrown over the top. Combat hardly represents an &ldquo;exciting new adventure opportunity&rdquo; for the average player. In fact, it features fairly regularly in even the least violent campaigns. Characters in violent campaigns play out more combat in an afternoon that most real world soldiers see in a lifetime of service.<br/><br/>However, for all its focus on tactical combat, the d20 rules provide us with few ways to run combat involving goals more complex than &quot;beat down the other guy&quot;. This gets fairly old after the first few times the characters beat someone up and take their stuff. So Game Masters invent their own rules in an attempt to spice things up.<br/><br/>Regardless of whether these rules work or not the players and Game Master still wrestle with the detailed tactical combat system cluttering d20 books. Concerns about scene pacing and dramatic rhythm take a back seat to calculating exact damage numbers and accounting for all of the tactical possibilities. This kind of play makes for a fun game when used in moderation. However we also need a way to run all of the other kinds of combat we would like to include in our games.<br/><br/>Thus was born Narrative Combat. Inside these pages you will find a combat system designed to help spark narration rather than record-keeping. It assumes character intent and skill matters more than their position on the field of battle. It uses standard d20 character information, but does so without getting bogged down into intricate calculations. Most importantly it provides a unified method for discussing and running everything from simple brawls to tense combats on burning bridges or keep sieges.<br/><br/>"}, "57989": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic570889.jpg", "poll": {}, "boardgamedesigner": {"10364": {"name": "Erik Oosterwal"}}, "statistics": {}, "yearpublished": "2009", "maxplayers": "4", "boardgameartist": {"10364": "Erik Oosterwal"}, "boardgamepublisher": {"1001": {"name": "(Web published)"}}, "maxplaytime": "15", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic570889_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "15", "boardgamecategory": {"1009": {"name": "Abstract Strategy"}}, "description": "Road Rally is an abstract tile placement, path negotiation, and counter collecting game with a racing theme.<br/><br/>Two to four players take turns placing square tiles on a 6x6 grid and moving their cars through a continually growing maze of streets and road hazards from their start positions, past two check points, and on to the finish line.

The player to his left then rolls the 6-sided die. The caller then consults his card and reads out the corresponding clue as the player rolled.

If so you receive the 2nd clue. If you still haven't guessed the sporting celeb you are allowed to roll again to see if you roll 'three' etc. This is called the Rule of One.<br/>The Rule of Two - if a player rolls 'two' they get to hear the 2nd and 3rd clues.<br/>If you roll a 'six' you effectively get given the card as the 6th clue is the person's name.<br/>The remaining 10 cards in the pack are bonus cards that when drawn are revealed by the caller.
