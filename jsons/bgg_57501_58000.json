GURPS Spaceships 3: Warships and Space Pirates provides ships and game mechanics for exciting space combat between medium and large vessels. It includes an overview of space navy and pirate operations; it also features GURPS Spaceships statistics for dozens of sample warships, from patrol ships and frigates to star cruisers and battleships. Tactical maneuvering rules expand the GURPS Spaceships combat system to handle hex-based combat and chases using counters or miniatures, and additional rules cover squadron-level command tasks. In space, there's nothing personal between two enemy ships . . . just hard vacuum and hard choices.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;This is the third volume in the GURPS Spaceships series by David Pulver (co-author of GURPS Fourth Edition). It requires only the GURPS Basic Set and GURPS Spaceships.

If that kind of dice cannot be found (look in any good adventure game store), a deck of cards (face or suit cards removed and shuffled) will do in a pinch.<br/><br/>One amongst you should take on the role of Director- the one that actually runs the game, keeps the story moving, and embodies everyone who is not a Cast Member. This person should read all the rules laid out here and the specifics of the adventure Derby Day (see p. 22). The others play the Cast Members- the characters actually participating in the events of the game. They can read the rules portion of thi  pack and should be provided with copies of the Original Cast (see p. 5-15).

This book will teach you everything you need to know about being part of this elite fighting force. You will learn how to fight, how to think, and how to survive. You will learn to use power suits, Morita rifles and other tools. You will learn how to stare death in the eye and laugh.<br/><br/>This book details the process of becoming Mobile Infantry. It covers every step from recruitment through the first mission. If your players all want to be Mobile Infantry, this book provides adventures at every stage &ndash; you can run them through select pieces or use the entire book as an introductory campaign. If the Player Characters are not all Mobile Infantry, this book can be used to provide the ones who are with valuable background. The Starship Troopers corebook provides all the rules necessary to create Mobile Infantry characters, but it does not go into details about their training. This book does that, offering players a chance to see exactly what their characters went through and thus think about how those events affected them. Players who read this book will have a better grasp of their Player Characters, and can create more believable figures because they know understand the Player Character&rsquo;s history.<br/><br/>Boot Camp is divided into four sections. The first section deals with how characters become recruits. The second section talks about the training itself, and details the boot camp where training takes place. The third section discusses the characters&rsquo; placement after their graduation from recruit to private, and gives suggestions for introductory missions.

A hero making his own myth can travel to the distant past to aid or oppose the gods in their battles; journey to the underworld and release the souls of the dead; or bend the wildest demons to his will and arness great magical power.<br/><br/>Our aim is to explain the many people, kingdoms, religions, and gods of Glorantha. It's intended to be both a general introduction to the endlessly fascinating fantasy world of Glorantha and a companion book to the Hero Wars role-playing game. We paint the history and present of Glorantha with broad strokes, occasionally highlighting an interesting feature or person.<br/><br/>"}, "57611": {"rpgartist": ["Zoltan Boros", "Caryad", "Eva D\u00fcnzinger", "Jens Haupt", "S\u0142awomir Maniak", "Michael Nietzer", "Mia Steingr\u00e4ber", "G\u00e1bor Szikszai", "Sabine Weiss"], "rpgitemversion": ["Hardcover version", "Limited authors' edition - green cover", "Limited Edition", "Limited publishers' edition - black cover", "PDF Version"], "poll": [], "name": "Wege der Helden", "rpgdesigner": ["Florian Don-Schauen", "Olaf Michel", "Elias Moussa", "Stephanie von Ribbeck"], "rpgproducer": ["Ralf Berszuck", "Florian Don-Schauen", "Patric G\u00f6tz", "Tobias Hamelmann", "Olaf Michel", "Thomas R\u00f6mer"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1240587.jpg", "usersrated": "10", "rpgsetting": ["Aventurien"], "average": "7.5", "statistics": [], "rpggenre": ["Fantasy"], "rpgpublisher": ["Ulisses Spiele"], "rpg": ["Das Schwarze Auge (DSA) (4th Edition)"], "rpgcategory": ["Core Rules (min needed to play)"], "rpgseries": ["DSA 4.1 Grundregelwerke (\"Wege\")"], "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1240587_t.jpg", "description": "User summary:<br/><br/>Wege der Helden (Ways of the Heroes) contains the Das Schwarze Auge 4th Edition character creation rules.<br/><br/>It includes:<br/><br/>- A character point system for buying attributes and skills<br/>- Character advantages and disadvantages<br/>- The various races and their sub-species and cultures of Aventurien<br/>- Character professions<br/>- Rules for creating additional races and professions<br/>- Lists of character names for the different cultures<br/><br/>"}, "57613": {"rpgdesigner": ["Frank Wilco Bartels", "Florian Don-Schauen", "Julian Marioulas", "Elias Moussa", "Thomas R\u00f6mer", "Philipp Seeger", "Tahir Shaikh", "Oliver Steiger", "Stephanie von Ribbeck"], "rpgitemversion": ["Hardcover version", "Limited Edition", "Second Printing (Hardcover version)", "Second Printing (PDF Version)"], "statistics": [], "name": "Das Schwarze Auge Basisregelwerk", "rpgartist": ["Zoltan Boros", "Elke Broska", "Eva D\u00fcnzinger", "Vincent Dutrait", "Ina Kramer", "S\u0142awomir Maniak", "Michael Nietzer", "Thomas R\u00f6mer", "Klaus Scherwinski", "Mia Steingr\u00e4ber", "Florian Stitz", "G\u00e1bor Szikszai", "Sabine Weiss", "Eva Zimmermann"], "rpgproducer": ["Ralf Berszuck", "Florian Don-Schauen", "Tobias Hamelmann", "Manuel Krainer", "Thomas R\u00f6mer", "Lars Schiele", "Stephanie von Ribbeck"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic852058.jpg", "usersrated": "14", "rpgsetting": ["Aventurien"], "average": "7", "rpgissuearticle": ["Aventurischer Seehandel", "\u00dcberarbeitung der Schmiederegeln von DSA"], "rpggenre": ["Fantasy"], "rpgpublisher": ["Fanpro", "Ulisses Spiele"], "rpg": ["Das Schwarze Auge (DSA) (4th Edition)"], "rpgcategory": ["Campaign Setting (game world)", "Core Rules (min needed to play)"], "poll": [], "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic852058_t.jpg", "description": "User summary:<br/><br/>The Das Schwarze Auge Basisregelwerk (The Dark Eye Basic Rulebook) is a new and expanded edition of the 4th Edition basic rules.<br/><br/>It contains:<br/>- An introduction to role playing<br/>- Twelve pre-generated character archetypes<br/>- Character creation and advancement rules<br/>- Skill mechanics and descriptions<br/>- Combat rules<br/>- Magic rules and spell descriptions<br/>- Rules for damage and healing<br/>- An overview of the continent of Aventurien, its history, regions, and religions<br/>- A bestiary<br/>- Descriptions of poisons and diseases<br/>- Game master advice<br/>- A full-color poster map of Aventurien and a smaller full-color map of Nostria and Andergast<br/>- Two loose character sheets<br/>- Two loose full-color rules summary sheets<br/><br/>"}, "57614": {"rpgartist": ["Roy Boholst", "Catherine Burnett", "David Day", "John Dollar", "James Holloway", "Robert Lazzaretti", "Tony Szczudlo"], "statistics": [], "name": "Dungeon (Issue 59 - May 1996)", "rpgdesigner": ["Paul F.

It's all generic, too, covering realistic, fantastic, and superscience troops at every tech level, and providing guidelines for customizing their quality, special training, and equipment.

This spring, the baron's back, with a new army, and once again threatens the communities that have taken root in the ruins of the former capital of Poland. The baron plans to conquer the communities before the winter wheat crop is ready, while the defenders are still short of food.<br/>The characters have been asked for help by Filip Kizysztof, leader of the Sielce settlement. Filip needs the characters' aid in reuniting the splintered communities to defeat the baron a second time, and in the process save what's left of civilisation in this part of Poland.<br/><br/>Return to Warsaw is the first in the Return to Europe series of Twilight: 2000 adventure modules.

I said helping Father Wojiech is insane and is only gonna get us all killed. We should hole up somewhere and see what the situation is in the spring.<br/>So who are we linked up with? Guess.<br/><br/>In White Eagle, powerful forces are struggling to control a nation. The armed might of King Julian of Silesia is matched against the equally powerful economic forces of the free city of Krakow. Opposing them both is the Wojsko Ludowa (People's Army) of Father W. Niekarz. Krakow has mercantile connections. money, and technological expertise. The &quot;king&quot; has military expertise and a steadily expanding government of local warlords backed by an organized military. Father Niekarz and his followers have a devout belief in the righteousness of their cause, a burning desire to see Poland free of tin-pot dictators and petty warlords backed by &quot;soldiers&quot; who are nothing more than bandits - and the Black Madonna of Czestochowa, a religious icon and a powerful symbol of Polish nationalism.<br/>For the WL's banner, Father Niekarz has chosen a white eagle (the tradional symbol of Poland) on a red field (red and white are the Polish national colors). The People's Army has no stockpiles of weapons and ammunition, no vast treasury, no great military leaders. That's where you come in....<br/><br/>White Eagle outlines what has happened in southern Poland since the players last saw the region: the transmutation of General Julian Filipowitz into the despotic King Julian, the power struggle within Krakow for control of the region's industrial economy, the deteriorating agricultural situation that threatens to spark another round of civil unrest within the towns and villages of Poland - these factors and others threaten the fragile blossom of civilisation.<br/><br/>"}, "57634": {"rpgdesigner": ["James L.

It compiles the original adventures Alptraum ohne Ende, Unsterbliche Gier, and Grenzenlose Macht into a single volume. It also adds a campaign overview, pre-generated characters, and background information.<br/><br/>Warning: Spoilers ahead!<br/><br/>The campaign is suitable for characters starting with roughly 5000 points of experience. They start at a fair in Baliho from where they set out to investigate the burning of a priest of Tsa by a mob in the small village of Dragenfeld. They compete with a group of Prios followers and an inspector of the secret police. Arriving in Dragenfeld the adventurers find the village destroyed and the surrounding lands withered. The temple of Tsa has been desecrated by an evil wizard. When he is destroyed, the characters find out that they have been moments too late. The spirit of the long-dead Borbarad has been released into the world to wreak havoc in the following adventures. At the end of the events, the eye of one of the characters changes into a glowing red ruby which makes him the first of the Marked Ones. This concludes the first adventure Alptraum ohne Ende (Endless Nightmare).<br/><br/>The second adventure is Unsterbliche Gier (Immortal Craving). It seems at first not related to the events of Alptraum ohne Ende. The adventurers are called to the duchy of Weiden where they reveal and fight an infestation of vampires. It was caused by the dark elf Pardona in her attempt to steal enough life force to form a new body for Borbarad's spirit. At the climax of the adventure, the characters battle Pardona and the arch vampire Walmir von Riebeshoff in their sinister tower, and one of the characters becomes the second Marked One.<br/><br/>Grenzenlose Macht (Infinite Might) leads the characters to the ravaged city of Greifenfurt. They are hired by the monastery of Arras de Mott to investigate and prevent acts of sabotage that jeopardize the reconstruction of the monastery. Unknown to them, the head of the monks was replaced by a shapechanging demon that tries to build a portal to the Valley of Elements and a focus for magical energy. In the valley, Borbarad wants to create his new staff from Seelenstamm, a gigantic ancient tree. The attacks on the monastery are masterminded by Archon Megalon, a druid the characters may have encountered before and whom they will not remember with joy. After some events in the monastery, the arrival of the inquisition will force the characters to escape and enter the Valley of Elements, where they battle Borbarad's minions. They come back to Arras de Mott to destroy the astral focus. Here they meet the first time with the real Borbarad who bathes in the magical energy. The destruction of the astral focus delays Borbarad's plans, but also destroys the monastery, which is the end of this third adventure.<br/><br/>"}, "57705": {"rpgartist": ["Claus D.

It compiles the original adventures Pforte des Grauens and Bastrabuns Bann into a single volume, and adds a new adventure: Schatten im Zwielicht. It also presents background information and ideas for additional adventures.<br/><br/>Warning: Spoilers ahead!<br/><br/>The first adventure in the book is Pforte des Grauens (Portal of Dread). After Borbarad's temporary defeat, the characters head to Punin, where they are sent to investigate the theft of large amounts of the magic metal Endurium on the isle of Maraskan. The metal should have been transported to Punin, but never arrived. The sea voyage from Khunchom to Tuzak goes not as expected and the party is stranded on the Maraskan shores north of their destination. They have to find their way through the jungles where they meet Achaz, the lizardmen. The Achaz want the characters to return an artifact that was robbed from them, a mission they can accept or decline.<br/><br/>After days in the jungle, the party finds the Endurium mine, human sacrifices and a demon that is forced to mine the Endurium ore. The Endurium has already been moved away from the mine, but the thieves also been slain. The characters can track the murders to the Friedhof der Seeschlangen (Graveyard of the Sea Serpents) where followers of Borbarad and lizardmen try to open a portal to let a demonic army into the world. After the destruction of the cultists, the adventurers find the artifact they were sent to recover for the good lizardmen tribe. When they bring it back they fight a ritual duel, and one of them becomes the third Marked One. At last they reach the city of Tuzak and reveal an infiltrator in the ruler's palace. They find Borbarad himself in disguise and finally fight him and force him to flee, capturing his staff.<br/><br/>In Bastrabuns Bann (Bastrabun's Banishment), Borbarad is able to widen his influence. An ancient spell - Bastrabuns Bann - held off the lizardmen from invading the lands of the Tulamids in former times. It is thought that this spell can be used against the invading  demon forces, if only the relics are found that aided in casting the original banishment. In the desert and mountains they discover another evil wizard who summoned the arch demon Asfaloth. Asfaloth creates an army of insectoid creatures and is threating to release the Great Swarm to conquer the Tulamid lands for himself. While the characters can defeat him, this only strengthens Borbarad who did not intend to share with the arch demon.<br/><br/>The last adventure of this book is a completely new one: Schatten im Zwielicht (Shadows in the Twilight) It was designed to tie together several loose threads of the original campaign.<br/><br/>At the start of the adventure, the party almost get's poisoned, but are saved by a member of the Shadows, a secret organization of dark mages opposing Borbarad. They are invited to participate in assassination operations against Borbarad's followers throughout Aventurien. After a few successful, though ethically questionable, attacks, a large-scale assault on Maraskan leads the party and a large fleet of ships manned by almost all Shadows into a trap. The characters only barely escape after having seen the real power of their nemesis.

It contains three adventures Two of the adventures have been official DSA adventures: Goldene Bl&uuml;ten auf Blauem Grund and Rohals Versprechen. The third adventure - Die Letzte Schlacht des Wolfes - is a compilation of three adventures that have been released on the internet and in magazines. The first two modules presented here are part of the side line that depicts events in the wake of Borbarad's rise. They can be experienced by the characters of the main campaign, or can be used to show uninvolved characters a glimpse of the Horrors of Borbarad's demonic armies.<br/><br/>Warning: Spoilers ahead!<br/><br/>In Goldene Bl&uuml;ten auf Blauem Grund (Golden Blossoms on Blue Ground), followers of Borbarad plan a new march of the ogres. The last one happened years ago and was described in the adventure Mehr als 1000 Oger. The characters can prevent this from happening, but are driven from vanguard of Borbarad's armies to the amazon stronghold Kurkum where they help with evacuating the surrounding villages and preparing the defenses. They can repel many attacks and stop saboteurs, but a traitor manages to call a demon winter upon Kurkum. The final assault can be beaten back at first, but the death of amazon queen Yppolita leads to the destruction of Kurkum that the characters cannot prevent.<br/><br/>Die Letzte Schlacht des Wolfs (The Last Battle of the Wolf) takes place after the fall of Kurkum. Their flight takes the party of characters to the next battlefield of Eslamsbr&uuml;ck, where also the next defeat waits for them. The prince of Tobrien falls, and the characters escape to Ysilia, where the prince's brother, Bernfried, gather's fresh troops. To be made duke, Bernfried needs the insignia that were stolen by a traitor. The party has to operate behind enemy lines, and on their return have to participate in the next large battle that at last can stop the troops of Borbarad. At least for a while. Winter has set in and both sides prepare for action in spring.  A ruse leads most of the troops away from Ysilia, and the city falls before the black hordes, driving the characters before them.<br/><br/>The third adventure starts in Punin where a convent of mages tries to  bring Rohal back, the emperor that defeated Borbarad 400 years ago. To make this happen, a magical artifact has to be pieced together. Borbarad's agents try to sabotage this, but will not be successful if the characters do their job. Rohal will be brought back at last and battle Borbarad, but this time he fails. But at least he is able to shatter Borbarad's invincibility before he is destroyed. The last part of the adventure is spent searching for ways to defeat the Demon Master.<br/><br/>"}, "57738": {"image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic570302.jpg", "poll": [], "boardgamedesigner": ["Denise Rothman"], "statistics": [], "yearpublished": "2007", "maxplayers": "4", "boardgameartist": ["Denise Rothman"], "boardgamepublisher": ["Darf"], "maxplaytime": "0", "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic570302_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "0", "boardgamecategory": ["Action / Dexterity", "Animals", "Card Game", "Children's Game", "Dice", "Party Game"], "description": "The DICE game where people compete to get dogs to do fun activities!<br/><br/>Roll the paw print dice, pick a matching paw print card, get your dog to do the activity, enter your score on the score pad.

The background for it is a tourney in which the successor to the head of Rondra's priests shall be determined. The tourney is a cover for another operation that the characters are performing. They have to collect the Seven Chalices, artifacts from which the legendary sword Sevenstroke can be forged. Various expeditions have been sent to collect the relics, but given the war, many are in danger or have already failed. As Borbarad gains knowlegde of these expeditions, his followers try to seize or destroy the Chalices. In the last steps of the adventure, Borbarad's troops launch an open assault against the temple of Angrosch where Siebenstreich is to be reforged. After the fight the party is hopefully victorious and Siebenstreich can be carried against Borbarad in the last step of the campaign.<br/><br/>The last part of this epic campaign is Rausch der Ewigkeit (Drunken with Eternity). At it's start, the characters are sent on a diplomatic mission to the trolls to gain their support against Borbarad. In the course of their journey they gain the Sixth Mark.

After months of constant retreats and loss, the Don River offered a respite. Even though the river was partially frozen, crossing proved difficult for either side except at one of the four bridges which span it. Weather and time also proved to be a friend of Denikin one last time, as both sides had to fight freezing temperatures and slowed the rapid advance of the Red Army chasing them into Rostov, a small city at the time. Much of the Red forces that reached the city were to too small and the main body of the army was still several days away.<br/><br/>Denikin pulled his forces back to Bataisk and dug in and by the time the Red lead elements arrived, the Reds found themselves in a much weaker position because Denikin had gathered his units. Denikin planned for a quick offensive, one to retake Rostov and hopefully beyond to buy additional time before the inevitable. Retaking Rostov would also be a desperately needed morale boost. Thus, he gathered his last available Mk V tanks, aircraft, and reinforced his elite Volunteer Army. He suddenly struck, completely taking the Red units by surprise, routing many. Within a day or so, he entered Rostov, and pushed onto the suburbs along the fringe. The reversal was complete. Stunning. Morale rose. But, like the Germans and the Ardennes in 1944, the weight of the Red army was felt once it arrived. Bitter fighting in Rostov set the city on fire as the Whites fell back across the banks of the Don. It was their last hurrah!<br/><br/>The game comes with a 11x17&quot; map, 280 counters, rules.

To take a building you must pay its requirements -  some combination of money, workers and building materials. More difficult combinations yield more victory points.<br/><br/>Furthermore, not all of the available buildings on the table are ripe for the taking, as only the ones on the right and left hand border of the 2 rows of buildings are available for selection.<br/><br/>The game's core mechanic revolves around identical decks of 13 cards for each player, of which only 2 are played per round. But in addition to the card's function, the numerical combination of cards played is important (e.g. a card with a value of 3 and 4, result in the value 34) as the player with the lowest combined number acts first.<br/><br/>So not only is the start player constantly changing, but it is also possible that a planned action cannot be taken, as another player has already used the same role. Not all roles are exclusive, so the turn order will also determine whether your &quot;half of all pesos in the middle&quot; is half of eight, or half of four (if a player before you played the same card). Some roles allow you to tax others or steal from them, and some cards defend against this, so it's not all just collecting pieces in a solitary manner. Some combinations require the presence of an architect, so you must choose whether to use one of your two card spots for him. Other cards add different twists. What and when to choose, who to hurt, and what you're aiming for, make up the game's main decisions.<br/><br/>These different ideas make Havana its own game even if some of it is familiar.

Now their forces are bolstered. The newest battle pack, Path of the Zealot, sees their chittering horde grow. Poison Wind Globadiers rain death upon the heads of their opponents, as they can corrupt to deal damage. The Chittering Horde tactic brings more Skaven into your fold, as it allows you to search a portion of your deck for ratmen recruits.<br/><br/>Not to be outdone, the forces of Order gain the assistance of the Zealot Hunter, who destroys that which doesn&rsquo;t belong upon entering play. He brings with him the capricious Veteran Sellswords, who change sides with each passing moment.<br/><br/>The starmetal known as Gromril has been a part of Dwarf lore for as long as the mountains have sheltered them. Now it emerges onto the battlefield, to shield the sons of Grungi. The Gate of Sigmar bars the entrance into one of the most populated cities in the Empire, and the staring skulls carved into the doors greet any invader as they crash against its might. Each turn, it shall do the same for you and keep damage from reaching your noble home.<br/><br/>Every zone sees new additions, and players will be forced to re-evaluate their plans. Will you devote the newest Empire hero, Gustav the Bear, to protecting your newly built Kingdom, or will he assist you in further developing your Quest zone? Dwarf Miners are an excellent unit to bring in later in the game. Their ability to &ldquo;fix&rdquo; the part of your capital they enter can be a game saver, especially in the often targeted Quest zone. The deadly Bloodsworn make an excellent protector for damaged zones, as each opposing figure that falls restores their health.<br/><br/>Speaking of the Quest Zone, a new Quest appears for the foul followers of Chaos, as they can now show themselves to be the Wolves of the North. Rumor has it that Valkia has personally found this quest to be most rewarding...<br/><br/>The Path of the Zealot also increases the number of High Elves and Dark Elves, as the war spills over into their lengthy lives. The Repeater Bolt Thrower launches a wave of indirect damage at your foe, and gets stronger the more developed you are. Vaul&rsquo;s Unmaking removes the weapons from the hands of the enemy and leaves them with nothing. Dark Elves call upon dark powers and pul the very blood from their foes. Call the Blood can remove a damaged unit from play, a nasty surprise for the foes of Malekith. Dark Riders, wielding wicked swords, charge down upon those foolish enough to be in their way.<br/><br/>This fall shall see some of the fiercest battles and desperate races to develop mighty empires.

You can play this game in any period from the American War of Independence to the Crimean war, though it concentrates on the Napoleonic wars.

You are born with Interest, but in order to get Notice, you have to burn with zeal and throw yourself headlong in harm's way.<br/>     Competitive Play: There can be only one Captain. One hero. Is it going to be you, or the guy sitting next to you?<br/>     Voluntary Wounds: You are face to face with the Captain of the French dragon. He's a master of the blade, and after a long duel, cuts you down. Instead of taking damage from it now, you can turn some or all of the damage into a permanent wound, and deal with it later. You stay on your feet, and slash him in return. He drops to your feet, dazed and bleeding. The dragon is yours - but that left arm is going to have to come off...<br/>     Avocations: You're an officer, sure - so are all your fellow officers - but you are also an intelligence agent.

Well Here Is Your Chance!<br/><br/>The game consists of two parts. The Fraze card which details a type of sentence category along the lines of tongue twisters, compliments, insults, confessions, secrets, gibberish etc and a second deck of cards called Exploits. Exploits are ways in which the sentence should be read, or act as a distraction while trying to read the phrase. Exploit categories for example might be miming a death scene, talking in your best German accent, or reading the sentence really fast.<br/><br/>During any particular players' turn there are two people in an interaction. The Scribe and the Reciter; the Scribe has the challenge of choosing from a limited number of fraze and exploits that he believes the Reciter will find difficult to say in front of a group. He must consider several things, his personal knowledge of the Reciter, such as personal hang ups about saying something silly in front of a group, whether his spirit could say take the brunt awkwardness of confessing to something he didn't do, while perhaps talking like a munchkin.<br/><br/>The Reciter will have his/her social inhibitions challenged in simply performing in front of a group, pronouncing a made up word, or punching out a tongue twister. Since the Reciter has a very limited time to process what he/she is about to say it also provides a psycological component as it can sometimes be difficult to psyche oneself up under limited time constraints.<br/><br/>Points are awarded according to a simple scale, whether the Reciter was able to read the sentence out loud under duress without stopping, laughing, stammering etc, within five seconds, and whether he was able to perform the exploit to a satisfactory level.<br/><br/>There is a simple system where disagreements regarding the performance was acceptable or not, or whether the attempt was successful.<br/><br/>Buy a copy of Frazed Today!<br/><br/>Includes:<br/><br/>* fraze Deck (75 cards)<br/>    * exploit Deck (71 cards)<br/>    * Frazed Rules Deck (12 cards)<br/>    * frazed rules Document<br/><br/>"}, "57950": {"boardgamedesigner": ["JT Smith"], "average": "5", "poll": [], "name": "MERC", "playingtime": "120", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": ["Area Control / Area Influence", "Area Movement", "Co-operative Play", "Modular Board", "Partnerships"], "yearpublished": "2009", "boardgameexpansion": ["MERC: The Expansion"], "usersrated": "1", "maxplayers": "6", "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic570217_t.jpg", "boardgameartist": ["JT Smith"], "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["The Game Crafter, LLC"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic570217.jpg", "maxplaytime": "120", "boardgamecategory": ["Modern Warfare", "Wargame"], "age": "18", "minplaytime": "120", "description": "From The Game Crafter's website:<br/><br/>&quot;MERC is a complex strategy game where each player hires and controls a team of mercenaries.

Either way, the goal is the same, to take control of the war torn tropical island of Tenagra.<br/><br/>Tenagra is a wealthy country full of industries. Taking control of those industries will finance your efforts. Along the way you'll pick up equipment and hire additional MERCs. You'll need to train guards to fortify and hold territory after you've taken it.<br/><br/>There are 50 unique MERCs for you to hire, each with their own personalities, special abilities, skills, and weaknesses. The right combination of MERCs will lead you to victory, but you'll have to compete to hire them against the other players who are also drawing from the same talent pool.<br/><br/>MERCs would be nothing without their equipment. The game offers more than 40 different types of equipment. There are various types of weapons; everything from a simple 9mm handgun, all the way up to a shoulder mounted assault weapon (SMAW). There are various types of armor and accessories. And you can even get vehicles like tanks and helicopters to assist in your conquest.<br/><br/>Every game of MERC is unique, because the map deck allows you to reconfigure the island of Tenagra so many ways. Plus, some times the best MERCs are killed in the first couple days on the island, so you have to fight your way to victory with their lesser counterparts.

The shrewd Trader may buy additional assets, while the cunning Thief can steal from other players.  The deck contains words which players combine into laws that everyone must obey.  The Trader might make a law stating The Theif loses 2 cards when they use an ability, which should put a stop to the Thief's meddling - for awhile.<br/><br/>Things get interesting when the Doctor, Priest and Banker manipulate existing laws, and when the Thief gives up his life of crime to swap professions with another player.  The result is a game which is never the same twice, and will keep you looking for new ways to turn the situation to your advantage.<br/><br/>Laws and Disorder is best played with 4-6 players and ample table space, although it makes for a longer and more strategic game with 2-3 players.

If the player answers their Meeting Room Card question correctly, they get to leave one of their colored keys in that Meeting Room. Players must watch out for Surprise spaces. Surprise Cards may require them to lose a chip or lose a turn. Surprise Cards may also reward the player by gaining an extra chip or roll of the die. If a player lands on a Meeting Content space, they must answer a Content Card question correctly to get a playing chip.<br/><br/>"}, "57974": {"boardgamedesigner": ["Charles M.

These products expand standard d20 rules to cover exciting new adventure opportunities ranging from chases to the fury of the open sea.<br/><br/>Why, then, did Adamant release Narrative Combat? D20 is, effectively, a tactical combat simulation with a thick gloss of other things thrown over the top. Combat hardly represents an &ldquo;exciting new adventure opportunity&rdquo; for the average player. In fact, it features fairly regularly in even the least violent campaigns. Characters in violent campaigns play out more combat in an afternoon that most real world soldiers see in a lifetime of service.<br/><br/>However, for all its focus on tactical combat, the d20 rules provide us with few ways to run combat involving goals more complex than &quot;beat down the other guy&quot;. This gets fairly old after the first few times the characters beat someone up and take their stuff. So Game Masters invent their own rules in an attempt to spice things up.<br/><br/>Regardless of whether these rules work or not the players and Game Master still wrestle with the detailed tactical combat system cluttering d20 books. Concerns about scene pacing and dramatic rhythm take a back seat to calculating exact damage numbers and accounting for all of the tactical possibilities. This kind of play makes for a fun game when used in moderation. However we also need a way to run all of the other kinds of combat we would like to include in our games.<br/><br/>Thus was born Narrative Combat. Inside these pages you will find a combat system designed to help spark narration rather than record-keeping. It assumes character intent and skill matters more than their position on the field of battle. It uses standard d20 character information, but does so without getting bogged down into intricate calculations. Most importantly it provides a unified method for discussing and running everything from simple brawls to tense combats on burning bridges or keep sieges.<br/><br/>"}, "57989": {"image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic570889.jpg", "poll": [], "boardgamedesigner": ["Erik Oosterwal", "Jason Spears"], "statistics": [], "yearpublished": "2009", "maxplayers": "4", "boardgameartist": ["Erik Oosterwal"], "boardgamepublisher": ["(Web published)"], "maxplaytime": "15", "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic570889_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "15", "boardgamecategory": ["Abstract Strategy", "Maze", "Print & Play", "Racing"], "description": "Road Rally is an abstract tile placement, path negotiation, and counter collecting game with a racing theme.<br/><br/>Two to four players take turns placing square tiles on a 6x6 grid and moving their cars through a continually growing maze of streets and road hazards from their start positions, past two check points, and on to the finish line.

The player to his left then rolls the 6-sided die. The caller then consults his card and reads out the corresponding clue as the player rolled. The roller then tries to guess the name of the famous sporting person. If guessed correctly the card is won by the roller, and then the pack and die both move clockwise for the next player to roll and the previous roller now gets to cross-reference the die score against the next card drawn.<br/>There are some gifts if you roll low, as these are the harder clues.<br/>If you roll 'one' you receive the first clue, but in addition you are allowed another roll to see if you manage to roll a 'two'. If so you receive the 2nd clue. If you still haven't guessed the sporting celeb you are allowed to roll again to see if you roll 'three' etc. This is called the Rule of One.<br/>The Rule of Two - if a player rolls 'two' they get to hear the 2nd and 3rd clues.<br/>If you roll a 'six' you effectively get given the card as the 6th clue is the person's name.<br/>The remaining 10 cards in the pack are bonus cards that when drawn are revealed by the caller. They either allow him to steal subsequent cards if not guessed correctly, or ask for extra clues, or whether the subject is male or female when it is his own turn in rolling and guessing.<br/>When all the pack is used up then the game is over and the player with the most won cards is the victor. However as this can last a long time (especially if knowledge of the subject is poor), time restraint can be imposed by pre-agreeing a number of celebs for victory.<br/>This is a U.K. game and therefore the sportsmen and women are predominantly famous to a U.K. audience either by virtue of being well-known domestically, and/or by having global reknown.<br/><br/>"}, "57995": {"rpgdesigner": ["Charles Abner", "Gerry Ball", "Mike Bartnikowski", "John Hill (I)", "Tim Kask", "George Nafziger", "Liam O'Reilly", "Kathleen Pettigrew", "John Prados", "Glenn Rahman", "Mark Rastogi", "Bill Somers", "Rick D.

Each marker has a number ranging from zero to five which represents the number of nobles that the player is placing in that area.  Most actions in the game require a player to remove a noble cube from an area in order to perform an action in that area.  Players also have income-generating estates in the different areas of Poland, and these holdings may determine which areas a player is most eager to defend.<br/><br/>Each turn, players may raise private armies and use them to strike at the five nations that threaten the different areas of Poland.  If a player is successful enough at attacking an enemy nation, then that nation may not have the resources to attack Poland that turn.  Later, a roll of four die will determine which enemy nations receive reinforcements, and then enemy nations will take their turn attacking Poland.  A successful enemy invasion of Polish territory may result in players losing one or more estates in that region.<br/><br/><br/>Bo\u017ce Igrzysko - Dzieje Rzeczpospolitej Szlacheckiej.<br/><br/>&quot;Nierz\u0105dem Polska stoi&quot; -  nie\u017ale kto\u015b powiedzia\u0142;<br/>Lecz drugi odpowiedzia\u0142, \u017ce nierz\u0105dem zginie.<br/>Pan B&oacute;g nas ma jak b\u0142azn&oacute;w.
