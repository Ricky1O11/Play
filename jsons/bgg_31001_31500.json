Every player gets a Hat Card, 5 (random) Craft Cards, and 3 Bravo Chips. The Heckle Cards are placed in the middle of the playing area, and the StoryTimer is handed to the player who is going first.<br/><br/>The game starts with the first player reading aloud one of the 53 included storylines. There are three phases to play:<br/><br/>Phase I: StoryTelling<br/>The player holding the StoryTimer creates (speaking out loud) the next part of the story (typically a sentence or two). Play moves around the table, with each player creating and speaking a new addition to the story. During this time, if a StoryTeller uses one of the elements on your Craft cards, you place it next to your Hat Card. Bravo Chips can also be tossed to StoryTellers who do a particularly good job.<br/><br/>Phase II: Discussion<br/>Anyone who played a Craft Card points it out to the others. If no one object, it goes on to that player's Hat Card and will be a point at the end of the game.<br/><br/>Phase III: Recitation<br/>The player holding the StoryTimer gives a Recitation of the story so far. Other players can toss Bravo Chips for a Recitation well done. The StoryTimer is passed to the left, everyone draws back up to 5 Craft Cards, and we go back to Phase I.<br/><br/>At the end of the game, players vote to assign awards (most creative, most hilarious, most surprising, most dramatic). These go into the recipients' hats.<br/><br/>The winner is the player with the most points in his or her hat.<br/><br/>A couple notes about the cards are in order. Craft Cards contain elements of the StoryTellers Craft, which means that players score points by either using or recognizing good storytelling. There are also Heckle Cards which are common to everyone and can be tossed to stop things from getting out of hand.<br/><br/>Home Page: <a target='_blank' href='http://www.liveoakgames.com/storytellers' rel='nofollow'>http://www.liveoakgames.com/storytellers</a><br/><br/>"}, "31027": {"boardgamedesigner": {"3": {"name": "(Uncredited)"}}, "poll": {}, "name": "Civil War Battles", "playingtime": "120", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": {"2070": "Simulation"}, "yearpublished": "2007", "usersrated": "10", "boardgamesubdomain": {"4664": "Wargames"}, "maxplayers": "6", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic238847_t.jpg", "average": "7.4", "statistics": {}, "boardgamepublisher": {"2496": {"name": "Peter Pig"}}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic238847.jpg", "maxplaytime": "120", "boardgamecategory": {"1048": {"name": "American Civil War"}}, "age": "0", "minplaytime": "120", "description": "Civil War Battles is a miniatures system in a book of 136 pages of which 46 pages are battle rules.

Studying the &quot;personal description&quot; given by the dice in the tumbler, you can help Paul track down the crooks in a thrilling chase. Who will be the best assistant policeman and the quickest at catching the right crook?&quot;<br/><br/>This is a game in Haba's range of tumble-dice games, which include dice inside a sealed tumbler with a clear plastic dome. This game has 3 six-sided dice, two of which are essentially D3s, with 3 different faces repeated once. There is a die with dots (1, 2 or 3 dots), a colour die (yellow for the beach, green for the park and blue for the town) and a crook die (Policeman Paul, a chubby crook, a woman crook [on 2 faces] or a crook with a loot bag[on 2 faces]). Besides the dice and the rules, there's a large wooden piece representing Policeman Paul and a deck of 27 cards, showing all possible combinations with crooks of the three dice.<br/><br/>The 27 cards are placed face up on the table around the Policeman Paul piece. A player shakes the tumbler. Depending on what the dice in the tumbler show, players try to claim the corresponding cards on the table. If the crook die shows the Policeman Paul face, the other dice are ignored and players try to grab the Policeman Paul piece - the successful player gets to choose any card on the table and place it in front of himself. If the crook die shows a crook, the players try to cover with their hand the card showing the corresponding number (on the die with dots) of that kind of crook in the venue specified (by the colour die). Players can only use one hand and the player who successfully covers the correct card with his hand gets to place the card in front of him. Players who wrongly grab Policeman Paul or cover the wrong card can make no further attempt to claim the right card that turn. Cards in front of players can be captured by other players if the same combination of dice get rolled again.<br/><br/>The first player to claim five crook cards wins.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": {"198526": "First edition"}, "age": "0", "name": "H\u00e4nde hoch!", "playingtime": "5", "boardgamemechanic": {"2072": "Dice Rolling"}, "average": "6.33333", "usersrated": "3", "boardgamefamily": {"21541": "HABA W\u00fcrfelbecherspiel series"}}, "31034": {"boardgamedesigner": {"9132": {"name": "Ria Lu"}}, "poll": {}, "name": "Talecraft", "playingtime": "60", "minplayers": "1", "boardgamemechanic": {"2027": "Storytelling"}, "yearpublished": "2006", "usersrated": "7", "maxplayers": "5", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic233230_t.jpg", "average": "5.57143", "statistics": {}, "boardgamepublisher": {"7240": {"name": "Komikasi Enterprise"}}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic233230.jpg", "maxplaytime": "60", "boardgamecategory": {"1002": {"name": "Card Game"}}, "age": "0", "minplaytime": "60", "description": "As a game, Talecraft aims to promote creative thinking through story creation. As a story-creation tool, Talecraft aims to help writers generate ideas for stories, and help combat Mental Block.<br/><br/>Talecraft provides the different Genres and Archetypes as cards. Since the setting is dependent on the genre of the story, Talecraft leaves the creation of the time and place to the imagination of the player. For the plot, Talecraft uses the Key cards, where a player may either be given plots, or keywords that would govern the story. Players may be required to add more characters to his cards. In this event, the player&rsquo;s story would be more character-driven than plot-driven.<br/><br/>A player of Talecraft has to create a story using the cards he had picked. The limit the picked cards set to a player prompts the use of the player&rsquo;s resourcefulness; and the need to fit all the cards into a story stretches his imagination.<br/><br/>It is not a requirement to appoint a winner when playing Talecraft. Since the aim of the game is to make stories, and the basis of a good story often depends on the judge's personal taste, Talecraft is often played without declaring winners. Should a winner be required, however, here is how it is done:<br/><br/>Each player will have a cup before him. After the player tells his story, all the other players will drop coins in the storyteller&rsquo;s cup, depending on its impact on them. If a player thinks the storyteller&rsquo;s story was not well made (like if there are a lot of loose ends, or if the events of the story are too scattered), the player does not drop any coin into the storyteller&rsquo;s cup. If the player thinks the story is acceptable but has little impact on him, he drops a coin in the cup. If the story manages to amuse the player, he drops two coins. And if the story awes him, he drops three coins. At the end of the game, or rounds of game, the players tally the scores. The player with the most coins wins.<br/><br/>Another way to decide a winner for Talecraft is to appoint a non-player as a judge who would decide who the winner is to be.<br/><br/>"}, "31035": {"boardgamedesigner": {"190": {"name": "Spartaco Albertarelli"}}, "poll": {}, "name": "People Game", "playingtime": "0", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": {"2014": "Betting/Wagering"}, "yearpublished": "1995", "usersrated": "1", "maxplayers": "10", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic233285_t.jpg", "average": "5", "statistics": {}, "boardgamepublisher": {"253": {"name": "Editrice Giochi"}}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic233285.jpg", "maxplaytime": "0", "boardgamecategory": {"1027": {"name": "Trivia"}}, "age": "14", "minplaytime": "0", "description": "Despite its English name People Game is a German Word Game for at least 2 players or teams.<br/><br/>The cards show each uncommon or unusual German words with their explanation or definition.

As the US commander, your mission is to eliminate key German industrial complexes. You select the targets, direct the bombers, and plan a strategy intended to keep the Luftwaffe off-balance. As the German commander, the entire arsenal of German aircraft is at your disposal against the finest in Allied designs. Turns are quarterly, with German reinforcements keyed to that player's production choices. Units are wings and squadrons, and they're rated by type, sub-type, firepower, maneuverability and endurance. There are rules for radar, electronic warfare, variable production strategies, aces, target complexes, critical industries and diversion of forces to support the ground war. Beyond that, the original, classic game system remains essentially sound and hasn't otherwise been changed much. Most of the upgrade was in adding in additional rules, revising the order of battle, and adding more deployment and industrial options.<br/><br/>The reverse side of the units now represents a condition of loss of effectiveness, rather than loss of material strength. That's due to a combination of factors: damage to aircraft, an infusion of novice pilots, or to veteran crews suffering combat fatigue. Historically, pilot training and morale were critical factors, and the game now shows that. Replacement points represent not only new aircraft but also logistical support, rest and relaxation time for aircrews, all of which are used to restore fatigued units to good morale. Fatigued units count the same as veterans for stacking on the assumption that a shot up or novice unit would be more difficult to coordinate in the air.<br/><br/>The orders of battle are much the same as in the original game, though the German player now has to plan ahead if he wants to get jets. We added a US P-61 unit. While P-61s were historically used mostly as night fighters, the USAAF based two groups in France and used them as intruders, so they can be useful in attacking German airbases. The Americans also get a &quot;Droop-Snoot&quot; P-38. They were P-38s that had their guns replaced with a bombardier and were used as light bombers. While only a small number were built, they were effective as bomber-leaders, so they're included in this edition.<br/><br/>The German player can now increase his ability to stack by expending fuel points, representing training pilots in large-unit formation tactics. The US player doesn't need to do that, since they had a much bigger training base as well as unlimited fuel. Since the Germans now get additional oil, owing to a more historic evaluation of the Ploesti fields, they can maintain an effective fighter defense as long as they can preserve that reserve of fuel.<br/><br/>There are also other new targets on the map, such as the Germans' power generation grid. In the original game the US player had to bomb all the targets on the map to win. Given the way the victory point system now works, the Americans need bomb about four out of the five major target systems to win, thereby duplicating the historic result.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": {"31831": "English second edition"}, "average": "6.55", "name": "Luftwaffe: Aerial Combat \u2013 Germany 1943-45", "playingtime": "240", "boardgamemechanic": {"2057": "Chit-Pull System"}, "age": "12", "usersrated": "44", "boardgamesubdomain": {"4664": "Wargames"}, "boardgamefamily": {"10643": "Country: Germany"}}, "31068": {"boardgamedesigner": {"189": {"name": "Michele Quondam"}}, "average": "5.16471", "poll": {}, "name": "Bulp!", "playingtime": "20", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": {"2041": "Card Drafting"}, "yearpublished": "2007", "usersrated": "68", "maxplayers": "4", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic233917_t.jpg", "boardgameartist": {"12213": "Alberto Bontempi"}, "statistics": {}, "boardgamepublisher": {"7251": {"name": "Giochix.it"}}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic233917.jpg", "boardgameversion": {"72426": "Giochix International edition 2007"}, "maxplaytime": "20", "boardgamecategory": {"1002": {"name": "Card Game"}}, "age": "8", "minplaytime": "20", "description": "From publisher site:<br/><br/>&quot;On the Hill of Bulp a water spring has been discovered.

The game uses a board, a cup and a plurality of cards. The cards are randomly transferred to and from the players. The players use the cards to form words. In the best mode, a game board defines a flat surface bounded by a peripheral wall upon which the cup freely travels about. A player begins a turn by spinning the cup, which eventually lands upon a card transfer space. The card transfer space dictates whether the player either draws or passes cards. The player transfers cards either from the deck or to a discard pile or to or from another player during a turn. Then the player attempts to spell a word by selecting cards in his hand and laying them face-up in front of him. Opponents may challenge the player's word. Any player who transfers all of his cards during a set becomes empty-handed and may not challenge words. The number of points earned by each player is dependent upon their performance both in forming words and in manipulating the number of cards in their hand. Preferably, a chance card multiplies the number of points a player can get. The set ending player's total score is doubled if the player ended the set with the chance card. Other player's scores are multiplied by zero if they held the chance card when an opponent ended the set.&quot;<br/><br/>In English, players use a cup shaped spinner that will move around the 5x5 board to determine card movement between the players.

The board consists of an array of hexagonal spaces with ice floes (hexagonal plastic tiles) that are introduced at the top and can be moved down the board by players with rates dependent on where they are on the board.  On their turn players must first move, rotate or introduce a new ice floe, then they can move one of their explorer as far as they can (or want) before collecting an item from the tile they finished on.  When moving, explorers are limited by the obstacles they must overcome and the tools they have available.  For example, the ice floes have smooth sides and rough side: the rough sides depict &quot;pack ice&quot; which is hard to cross, and costs a rope.  Similarly, explorers can swim up to one space, but that costs a fish as swimming through arctic waters is energy sapping.

The mob players use their tokens to secretly choose one or more answers.<br/><br/>When the mob players have finished distributing all of their tokens, the contestant may ask for one of three helps before giving a response to the question. The helps one response of the contestant&rsquo;s choosing), Trust the Mob (the contestant is forced to choose whichever response has the most tokens on it) or Ask the Mob (this eliminates one wrong response). The contestant can use each help only once.<br/><br/>If the contestant gives the correct response, the money is added to the bank equal to the level the player is on multiplied by the number of tokens the mob has put on the wrong responses. The levels start at $1000 and ascend to $10,000. The mob tokens that are on the incorrect responses are out of play.<br/><br/>The game is over when the contestant gives an incorrect response. This means the money in the bank is divided among the mob players who still have tokens.  The contestant wins $1,000,000 when the mob loses all its tokens. The contestant can quit the game before ascending to the next level and keep whatever money has been accumulated in the bank.<br/><br/>Players continue the game until each player has been the contestant. A running total of the scores of each game is kept.

After more than a decade of employment in different companies and industries, different departments and sectors of the businesses, from agriculture to software production, I realized that at the end of the day, one common factor was evident; the desire for career advancement and the fruits and privileges that accompanied the advancement.   To me, everything seemed to revolve around this common factor, Advancement; the economy, lifestyle and life in general all seemed to be a game where the rules were already written and I had to follow them.<br/><br/>With this understanding in mind, I embarked on the arduous task of arranging it all on paper and it wasn&rsquo;t long before I had a complete and playable game.  The circular design of the game was chosen to emphasize the revolving aspect of the game.  I had four gas stations to remind us of both the need for gas and the high gas prices.  I included childcare; a common denominator in our families and most other successful and complete families.  Since we all have to pay taxes, I included a slot for the IRS on the game.  It was abundantly clear that since I got paid once every pay period, then one complete revolution around the board was equivalent to one complete pay period.  Domestic utilities were also included in the game for this was an everyday necessity.<br/><br/>There were several things I could have included in the game such as food and health insurance but I ran out of room.  However, I did include vacation, a common phenomenon at work, whether earned or incidental such as sick time or penalty (suspensions).  The Superior Court was included to provide a platform for one to forward his/ her grievances and concerns and to provide a platform for one to mount their best defense whenever the circumstance arose.<br/><br/>For disciplinary purpose and as an instrument of the constant penalty awaiting the lawbreakers, I included the jail slot on the game.  I also included the INS slot on the game due to the fact that there are numerous undocumented immigrants who masquerade as legal entities hence the need for consistently proving ones eligibility for employment.  As much as I despise paying the high insurance premiums, the state law requires that we maintain auto insurance at all times.  In an effort to keep the game fun and entertaining, I included the mailbox and email as tools to deliver messages, promotions, bonus, and even penalties.<br/><br/>The eight departments, Shipping and Receiving, Production, Assembly, Customer Service, Packaging, Maintenance, Quality Assurance and Management were chosen because I had personal experience in them and I felt that they were crucial to any manufacturing enterprise.  Other departments such as accounting, advertising and marketing though important to a company were not included because I figured that some companies were able to operate profitably by either doubling or outsourcing these departments.<br/><br/>"}, "31159": {"boardgamedesigner": {"9695": {"name": "Gr\u00e9gory Kirszbaum"}}, "poll": {}, "name": "Piratatak", "playingtime": "15", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": {"2004": "Set Collection"}, "yearpublished": "2008", "boardgameimplementation": {"67026": "Diamoniak"}, "usersrated": "97", "maxplayers": "4", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic270462_t.jpg", "average": "5.35309", "statistics": {}, "boardgamepublisher": {"4567": {"name": "Djeco"}}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic270462.jpg", "boardgameversion": {"99913": "First edition"}, "maxplaytime": "15", "boardgamecategory": {"1002": {"name": "Card Game"}}, "age": "5", "minplaytime": "15", "description": "The objective of the game is to construct your own ship before pirates arrive and attack you!<br/><br/>The basic mechanic is to draw cards to found gold (for buy ship cards to your opponents), ship cards (for construct your own ship),cannons (for attack pirates if they appear) but if you draw a pirate card you lose 3 cards!

The first player to get to the end of the track by exact count wins. The Social Responsibility Game has a circular track (in the sense that you go round and round the track) and players follow instructions on the board where their pieces land. There are Social Responsibility Quotient (SRQ) cards worth up to 20 SRQ points. Players can also earn and lose money depending on their social behavior. There are red penalty cards, drawn when a player lands on a 'Penalty Square', and green cards that a player picks up after landing on a 'Good Social Habit Square'. The game ends when a player runs out of money, or there are no more SRQ point cards. The player with the most SRQ points wins. A curious feature of the game is the role of Social Responsibility Judege (SRJ) - the SRJ administers all penalties, rewards or awards.<br/><br/>Graphics and illustrations by Rolling Art Pte Ltd.<br/>The year of publication is based on a discount coupon (for Popular Bookstore) that came with the game and was valid only till October 2005.<br/><br/>A version of this game, called Tampines Our Pride, combining the Social Responsibility Game and Tampines Our Pride Game (a roll-and-move game, like the Our Town Sparkles Game) was created for the Tampines Town Council. The differences are in the roll-and-move game (different track and events) and the Social Responsibility Game has some slightly different artwork - for example, there's a picture of the Tampines Changkat Community Club on the board.

You might think about having kids in order to get more work accomplished, but first you need to expand your house. And what are you going to feed all the little rugrats?<br/><br/>The game supports many levels of complexity, mainly through the use (or non-use) of two of its main types of cards, Minor Improvements and Occupations. In the beginner's version (called the Family Variant in the U.S. release), these cards are not used at all. For advanced play, the U.S. release includes three levels of both types of cards; Basic (E-deck), Interactive (I-deck), and Complex (K-deck), and the rulebook encourages players to experiment with the various decks and mixtures thereof. Aftermarket decks such as the Z-Deck and the L-Deck also exist.<br/><br/>Agricola is a turn-based game. There are 14 game rounds occurring in 6 stages, with a Harvest at the end of each stage (after Rounds 4, 7, 9, 11, 13, and 14).<br/>Each player starts with two playing tokens (farmer and spouse) and thus can take two turns, or actions, per round. There are multiple options, and while the game progresses, you'll have more and more: first thing in a round, a new action card is flipped over.<br/>Problem: Each action can be taken by only one player each round, so it's important to do some things with high preference.<br/>Each player also starts with a hand of 7 Occupation cards (of more than 160 total) and 7 Minor Improvement cards (of more than 140 total) that he/she may use during the game if they fit in his/her strategy. Speaking of which, there are countless strategies, some depending on your card hand.

The object is to get the highest score after six rounds.  Each of the two dice has number on five of the six sides, and a skull on the sixth side.<br/><br/>Determine which player goes first by any convenient method.  First player rolls both dice.  If no skulls are showing, the player adds the numbers showing to his score for the round.  He he has the option of rolling again, or passing the dice to the next player.  If he passes the dice, his turn is over, and the score he has rolled so far is &quot;protected.&quot;  If he rolls again, he may get more points, but he may also lose all the points he has received so far that round.  A player may continue to roll the dice until he decides to pass them, or until he rolls one or more skulls.  If a player rolls one skull, he loses all the points he has gained that round, and gets a score of zero for the round.  He must then pass the dice to the next player.  If a player rolls two skulls, he loses all the points he as gained that round, and in all previous rounds.  He is completely wiped out, and must start again the next round.  He must pass the dice to the next player.<br/><br/>After all the players have had a chance to roll the dice, draw a line under the scores to signify that the scores above the line are &quot;protected&quot; (i.e., cannot by wiped out the the roll of a single skull).  Note that each player must roll the dice at least once each round.<br/><br/>Subsequent rounds:  In the following rounds, players roll the dice in the order of their score so far.  The player with the highest score at they end of the first round will roll first for the second round.  The player with the second highest score will roll second, and so on.  There is an advantage to rolling last, so we give that position to the player who is losing the worst.  If two players are tied for score, they may roll a dice or flip a coin to determine which must roll first.<br/><br/>At the end of six rounds the player with the highest score wins.  If two players are tied for the highest score, then all players must roll another round.<br/><br/>Hint:  although the odds of rolling a skull on any one roll are always exactly the same as any other roll, the more times you roll in one round, the more points you are rising on any one roll.<br/><br/>Flying Buffalo Inc.

But when HLBS Publishing (The Honourable Lead Boiler Suit Company) was planning their Victorian British in Home Service uniforms figure range they decided to publish their own rules to go with them.  Why?<br/><br/>Firstly, because the emphasis in Ever-Victorious Armies is rather different from that of most rule sets.  The authors were especially interested in the role which the British army might have played in a European War of the period, and so they wanted to cater for this sort of hypothetical scenario. They also wanted to be able to fight &quot;alternative history&quot; campaigns, involving fictional armies based fairly loosely on real-life prototypes.  This required a &quot;broad brush&quot; approach, catching the essence of the period, but without concentrating too intently on the tactical and organizational minutiae of a particular conflict.<br/><br/>The other factor which HLBS Publishing (The Honourable Lead Boiler Suit Company) sought to emphasize in this war-game is the &quot;game&quot; part.  Some of the best known rules for the period -- as for many other periods -- are a bit too much like work to play.  Authenticity is all very nice but real warfare has been aptly described as a combination of ninety percent boredom and ten percent confusion.  HLBS Publishing (The Honourable Lead Boiler Suit Company) have tried not to reproduce this aspect too faithfully in Ever-Victorious Armies.<br/><br/>Ever-Victorious Armies is based on individual figures, which are removed to simulate casualties, thus minimizing record-keeping.  It requires little if any paperwork, no little boxes to tick off, and only one kind of dice.  The command and control rules require each on-table unit to be given orders at the start of the game, to which they must try to adhere as long as morale test results permit. The orders should specify the objective and route if the units are to move, or the position to be defended if not. An army's Commander-in-Cheif may attempt to modify the orders of one unit, per turn, by utilizing a messenger figure to convey a new set of written orders.<br/><br/>The rules ideally require figures to be based so that they are individually removable, but multi-figure &quot;blocks&quot; -- like those produced in 2mm and 6mm bi Irregular Miniatures -- can be used instead, if you prefer to use the smaller scales.  In this case, simply treat each block as if it was a figure.<br/><br/>A game involving several hundred figures a side can easily be completed in an evening. After a few attempts players will be able to remember most of the rules which are needed, and so will be able to keep the game moving without constantly referring to the rulebook.  This leaves the players free to enjoy the games and admire their carefully painted figures -- which is what it is all about, after all.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": {"185425": "First edition"}, "name": "Ever-Victorious Armies", "playingtime": "120", "boardgamemechanic": {"2072": "Dice Rolling"}, "average": "7", "usersrated": "1", "boardgamesubdomain": {"4664": "Wargames"}, "age": "0"}, "31304": {"boardgamedesigner": {"2282": {"name": "Robert G.

Famous convoy operations like those of PQ12 and PQ17, British carrier raids, German-Soviet destroyer skirmishes along the Arctic coast &mdash; all of these and more are included. Like all games in the series, this one come stuffed with scenarios and variations on them.<br/><br/>Most scenarios are very straightforward &mdash; each side knows what the other must do. The Allied player has large convoys of vital merchant shipping that must reach their destination. The German player has bases in Norway well-placed to intercept them, with submarines and aircraft that can hit them almost continuously. As in Bomb Alley, aircraft are drawn in a semi-random fashion so neither player has perfect intelligence about their numbers and location. German surface ships are few in number, but there's a lot of open sea in which they can hide and strike the convoys at vulnerable moments. And with war raging simultaneously on many other fronts, the convoy escort forces are stretched very, very thin.<br/><br/>There are two maps, covering the Norwegian and Barents Seas from Iceland in the southwest to Novaya Zemlya in the northeast, from the Norwegian coast to the Arctic pack ice. It's one of the larger play areas in the Second World War at Sea series, and unlike Leyte Gulf's three maps, both of these are in use in almost every scenario.

These issues then shape the four values, but also bring points through them. This means that the more militaristic the society is the more militaristic influence points you get from cards like 'Raise in Defence Budget' or 'War on Terrorism'. With these points you then push through laws that focus on that value. Only these law cards that the players have pushed through with their political influence they get victory points. And as each value has limited amount of laws there is a race who stands as the best advocate for each value.<br/><br/>Most cards have special abilities that makes them stronger with certain other cards (i.e. Feminism with Equality) or for example prevent certain points to be scored (i.e. Torture Scandal on militarism points or UN in Crisis on Human value points).<br/><br/>As the game proceeds the players try to sell their world view to the masses.

Corporation Incorporated builds them. Everyone knows their drivers -- the brave men and women who fear no danger and would, if the pay was good enough, even fly through Hell.<br/> Now you can join them. You will gain access to prefabricated spaceship components cleverly made from sewer pipes. Can you build a space ship durable enough to weather storms of meteors? Armed enough to defend against pirates? Big enough to carry a large crew and valuable cargo? Fast enough to get there first?<br/><br/>Of course you can. Become a Galaxy Trucker. It's loads of fun.<br/><br/>Galaxy Trucker is a tile laying game that plays out over two phases: building and flying. The goal is to have the most credits at the end of the game. You can earn credits by delivering goods, defeating pirates, building an efficient ship, and being the furthest along the track at the end of the flying phase.<br/><br/>Building happens in real time and has players build their personal space ships by grabbing tiles from the middle of the table before the timer runs out. Tiles start out facedown so they won't know what they have until they take it, but they may choose to return it faceup if they don't want it. They must place the tiles they keep in a legal manner in their space ship. Usually this just means lining up the connectors appropriately (single to single, double to double, universal to anything) but also includes proper positioning of guns and engines. Tiles represent a variety of things including guns, engines, storage containers, crew cabins, shields, and batteries. They may also peek at the cards they will encounter in phase 2, but they must sacrifice building time to do this. At any time players may call their ships finished and take an order marker from the center.<br/><br/>Once building is completed, and ships have been checked for errors, the flight begins. The flight cards are shuffled and player markers are placed on the flight board according to the order markers taken. Cards are revealed one at a time and players interact with them in order. They may include things such as pirates, abandoned vessels, disease outbreaks, meteor showers, worlds with goods to pick up, player-on-player combat zones, and other various things.<br/><br/>Most of the cards will cause players to move back on the flight track and they must decide if the delay is worth their efforts. When all the cards are encountered players sell any goods they have collected, collect their rewards for finishing in first, second, or third place or having the most intact ship, and then lose some credits for damaged components. Space can be a very dangerous place and it is not uncommon to see your ship break into smaller and smaller pieces or lose some very valuable cargo off the side. If your ship gets damaged too much you can get knocked out of the race, so be careful!<br/><br/>3 rounds of this are done, and in each round players get a bigger board to build a ship that can hold more components. After the 3rd round the player with the most credits wins!<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": {"320717": "Chinese first edition"}, "rpgpodcastepisode": {"177172": "Episode 47 - Lamentations of the Flame Princess"}, "name": "Galaxy Trucker", "playingtime": "60", "boardgamemechanic": {"2072": "Dice Rolling"}, "age": "10", "boardgameexpansion": {}, "usersrated": "21276", "boardgameaccessory": {"40684": "Galaxy Trucker Compatibility Pack"}, "boardgamesubdomain": {"5496": "Thematic Games"}, "average": "7.47461"}, "31482": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic240832.jpg", "poll": {}, "boardgamedesigner": {"8483": {"name": "Roger Cambell"}}, "statistics": {}, "yearpublished": "2005", "maxplayers": "4", "boardgameartist": {"3": "(Uncredited)"}, "boardgamepublisher": {"6679": {"name": "CSS Chicora Production"}}, "maxplaytime": "0", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic240832_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "0", "boardgamecategory": {"1048": {"name": "American Civil War"}}, "description": "The first chapter is the game.

They loaded their covered wagons with all they could and headed west across steppes, deserts, and mountains. Many chose to settle in Oregon, where the farming and hunting was plentiful and they could stake out a bit of land for themselves.The players have already reached Oregon and gaze upon the rich farmland below and the potential gold and coal reserves of the mountains. They build ports on the lakes and rivers, churches, warehouses, post offices, and train stations on the plains. And, of course, they must farm the rich land to grow the food necessary for the area to grow and thrive. To win, a player must choose the right times to farm and the right times to build, for planning is necessary, even here in the untamed wilderness of Oregon!Oregon - the way the west was won ...<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": {"26464": "Hans im Gl\u00fcck German Edition"}, "average": "6.7826", "name": "Oregon", "playingtime": "45", "boardgamemechanic": {"2080": "Area Control / Area Influence"}, "age": "8", "usersrated": "2892", "boardgamesubdomain": {"5499": "Family Games"}, "boardgamefamily": {"22783": "Admin: Better Description Needed!"}}, "31498": {"boardgamedesigner": {"5245": {"name": "Daniel Solis"}}, "poll": {}, "name": "Plastic Glory", "playingtime": "20", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": {"2072": "Dice Rolling"}, "yearpublished": "2005", "usersrated": "0", "maxplayers": "2", "average": "0", "statistics": {}, "boardgamepublisher": {"5318": {"name": "Luchacabra"}}, "maxplaytime": "20", "boardgamecategory": {"1046": {"name": "Fighting"}}, "age": "0", "minplaytime": "20", "description": "Plastic Glory is, essentially, a simple miniatures rules system -- except it isn't for miniatures.
