It does bring a few tricks to the table though that make it worth considering.<br/><br/>Mobility<br/>With a movement that some would call on the lower side of average the Poltergeist can have a hard time keeping up with Pandora once she begins her train of effects. It should be able to keep up with most other models okay though, or at the very least have little issue getting into a useful position when thought out a turn or two ahead.<br/><br/>Offense<br/>With no range attack some would quickly overlook the capabilities of this model, but it has a rather good severe damage for close combat. It's strength lies more so in the distraction abilities it brings to the table, however, in that it can make enemy models slow (and your own as well do not forget) and a few other shenanigans that suit a Pandora list quite well. Magical extension lets you use one of Pandora's spells another time each turn, and who doesn't want to cast Self-Loathing or Project Emotions another time?<br/><br/>Resilience<br/>This model is short and so can hide easily. It has a high defense, but low wounds, so can die fairly easily if the opponent focuses on it. Spirit will help reduce the damage too, though, so the model can be quite survivable.<br/><br/>Magical Extension<br/>Remember that any enemy model failing a WP duel within range of Pandora takes a wound, so casting spells that keep this going or give an opposing model negative flips while freeing up Pandora herself for other actions is always a plus.<br/><br/>Tips and Tricks<br/>One trick with this totem is to use its Persistent Distraction spell while your own models are clustered near it to force your opponent to activate and use all of his models before you use any more of yours effectively out activating their entire crew with all of yours. This can be very situational and is probably not a good idea later in the game as you can leave yourself very exposed to attack, but can give you an early game advantage to seeing what your opponent has planned.<br/><br/>Using Magical Extension to cast Project Emotions and give enemy models a negative flip can help out several of the models often found in a Pandora crew.<br/><br/>"}, "132504": {"statistics": [], "name": "Malifaux: Legion of Sorrow", "playingtime": "0", "minplayers": "2", "yearpublished": "0", "boardgameexpansion": [], "usersrated": "4", "maxplayers": "10", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1457082_t.jpg", "average": "6.25", "boardgamepublisher": ["Wyrd Miniatures"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1457082.jpg", "boardgameversion": ["First edition"], "maxplaytime": "0", "poll": [], "age": "12", "minplaytime": "0", "description": "This box set expands the Malifaux universe by adding the Legion of Sorrow.

She features powerful debuffs, crushing offensive abilities, and deceptive maneuverability, making her one of the more dangerous Masters in the game.

These four abilities form her core and are utilized by her spells and actions. The Box Opens allows her to affect just about any model in the game with her Wp-based effects while Emotional Trauma harms any enemy model failing a Wp duel near her. Expose Fears is her main defense against enemy models and forces any enemy model targeting her into a Wp -&gt; Wp duel. Finally, Fading Memory adds a deceptive amount of maneuverability to an otherwise slow Master and, when paired with the other three abilities, provides her a unique defensive option of darting away from (or towards) an opponent trying to target her.<br/><br/>Pandora's starter box is about perfect. It gives you a nicely rounded list of 23ss, leaving you 2 more for your Soulstone Pool during the game, and has a mix of Wp based models and dual purpose models.

This crew includes the Dreamer (leader), Lord Chompy Bits, Coppelius, and 2 Stitched Together.<br/><br/>From the Malifaux Tactica Wiki page:<br/><br/>The Dreamer is a child Earth side of the Breach whose dreams take him to Malifaux where his powers manifest in the ability to warp reality to his every whim. But he is not aware that the lives he plays with are those of living humans, he thinks it is all a dream and plays &quot;games&quot; with them. Noticing the child's immense powers, the primordial Nightmare came to him and attempted to drain him of his powers but found he was unable to. Given the name Lord Chompy Bits, he now protects the child and follows him around in his adventures in the &quot;dream land&quot;.<br/><br/>The Dreamer &amp; Lord Chompy Bits (LCB) have one of the most unique playstyles of any Master in Malifaux. Much like Viktoria you have 2 models for your Master but that is where the similarity stops. The Dreamer's main strategy is burying and unburying his Nightmares, letting him quickly move them across the field completely protected and drop them on your opponent when he least expects it. But for that power, the Dreamer trades any real kind of combat ability himself. He has a versatile but weak ranged attack but it is good for little more then harassing your opponents models. This is where Lord Chompy Bits comes into the picture; he can't move the Nightmares around like the Dreamer can, but he is one of the most dangerous melee Masters in the game. The Dreamer or Daydreams can unbury him, letting him deliver LCB to a desired location.<br/><br/>The Dreamer's crews are almost always made up exclusively of Nightmares as those are the only models he can bury and unbury with his abilities. He is not restricted to only bringing Nightmares, but there are very few non-Nightmare models that are worth taking over another Nightmare model. So this does make the list of models for his crews a bit small, but it doesn't hurt him. The models in that list have a variety of uses for them and really none of them have only a single use, they can all be useful in a variety of ways and play styles. So with very little variety compared to other Masters, The Dreamer certainly does a whole lot.<br/><br/>As a word of warning, The Dreamer is one of the most complex Masters in Malifaux and often requires a very firm grasp of the core rules to fully understand.<br/><br/>The Dreamer's starter box contains The Dreamer, Lord Chompy Bits, Coppelius, and 2 Stitched Together. Regardless of the type of Nightmare force you want to run, your first purchase must be a box of 3 daydream totems. They are the linch pin to The Dreamer's burry/unbury style of play and the master functions quite badly without them. Adding the daydreams gives you a starting crew of exactly 25ss. While The Dreamer does have a cache of 0, his Master of Dreams rule means he gains 1ss to his pool per non-master nightmare in the crew up to max of 5. The starter set plus daydreams has 6 nightmares giving him the max 5ss pool<br/><br/>"}, "132524": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1451659.jpg", "poll": [], "boardgamedesigner": ["Brian Engelstein", "Geoff Engelstein", "Sydney Engelstein"], "statistics": [], "yearpublished": "2012", "maxplayers": "6", "boardgameartist": ["Karim Chakroun"], "boardgamepublisher": ["Stronghold Games"], "maxplaytime": "90", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1451659_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "90", "boardgamecategory": ["Expansion for Base-game", "Science Fiction"], "description": "A small card expansion / promotional give-away for Space Cadets.<br/><br/>It consists of three new Experimental Equipment cards for the Captain, four Special Crystal cards, a cover card with the rules and a grey plastic spaceship miniature.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "3", "boardgameversion": ["Stronghold First Edition"], "average": "6.49452", "name": "Space Cadets Promo Pack", "playingtime": "90", "boardgamemechanic": ["Co-operative Play"], "age": "8", "boardgameexpansion": [], "usersrated": "62", "boardgamefamily": ["Promotional Cards", "Space Cadets"]}, "132525": {"poll": [], "name": "The King of Chicago", "videogamemode": ["Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["North American Amiga edition", "North American DOS edition", "UK DOS Cinemaware edition", "UK DOS Mirror Image edition"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1461513.png", "videogametheme": ["Crime"], "usersrated": "1", "videogamedeveloper": ["Cinemaware"], "videogamegenre": ["Action Adventure"], "videogameplatform": ["Amiga", "DOS"], "average": "8", "statistics": [], "videogamepublisher": ["Cinemaware", "Mirrorsoft"], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1461513_t.png", "description": "From the Back of the Box:<br/><br/>Chicago in the 30's.

Hoffman or Leveticus. This model is typically well worth the 9 SS cost, and overall has good survivability, a good attack, and consistent damage output.<br/><br/>Overall, the Arachnids are pretty straight forward, and are basic melee attack units.<br/><br/>On the other hand Scatter uses a Summon technique, so if you plan to do the Scatter action, always be sure to use 1 general AP for something else first, and use your (+2) Melee Master and probably Self Repair or Disruption Field as well. Then when you Scatter, if you activated Disruption Field, it will automatically pass onto each of your newly summoned individual Arachnids. When they come into play, since they are Summoned, they are treated as new models, each with their own activation, but they will be Slow during that turn which they were summoned. The Scatter action is also different from Swarm Together, in that the individual Arachnids do not activate immediately, as in the Swarm Together scenario.<br/><br/>Against models with high Df, as mentioned above, Latch On is typically a good approach. One thing that works well is to move a Swarm up to the opponent, as long as it's less than 4&quot; total, attack twice with (+2) Melee Master, activate (0) Disruption Field, and then use the Swarm's last (1) to Scatter. Since you have to put the individual Arachnids in base contact with the Swarm, you should be able to place at least two of the new Arachnids in base contact with your target. Then, when those individual ones get to activate (thus, good to do this at the end of your turn, after your opponent has activated all their models, if possible), you start out with the one not in base contact to move into base contact and (0) Latch On. Then your two Arachnids in base contact can (0) Latch On and attack vs -4 and -6 Df. If you can manage to set this up where your Steamborg Executioner or another Arachnid Swarm still need to activate after all of this, then you should be able to really do some damage. This is one of the best ways to handle high Df opponents like Lilith, Perdita Ortega, or the Coryphee Duet (if you can get them to stand still, that is).<br/><br/>Lastly, the Overwhelm trigger, as mentioned above is one of the most dangerous things about the Arachnid Swarm, and it is worth learning how to utilize it well, both in the game itself, and as a psychological tactic. If your opponent knows that you have not yet activated a Swarm or two in range of some of his better pieces, he may be cautious about playing higher cards from his hand earlier in the turn, because he wants to keep those for cheating up his Df against the potential Swarm attacks. So there are some good mind-games that can be utilized with the Swarm.<br/><br/>"}, "132541": {"boardgamedesigner": ["Adam Jastrzebski", "Michal Mulicki"], "average": "5", "poll": [], "name": "Crown of Underworld", "playingtime": "180", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": ["Area Control / Area Influence", "Auction/Bidding", "Hand Management", "Variable Phase Order", "Variable Player Powers"], "yearpublished": "2012", "usersrated": "2", "maxplayers": "6", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1461480_t.jpg", "boardgameartist": ["Michal Mulicki"], "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["Platypus' Lounge"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1461480.jpg", "boardgameversion": ["First edition"], "maxplaytime": "180", "boardgamecategory": ["Mafia"], "age": "18", "minplaytime": "180", "description": "user summary<br/>Players compete as mafia bosses for the most influence in Munshine City.<br/><br/>Each player takes one of 8 different families/organisations, each with special powers.<br/><br/>The game takes 10 turns, divided into phases of which the most important are:<br/><br/>Bribing phase: The players bid blindly on one or more of 6 so called Key Figures, which convey special powers in the following turn.<br/><br/>Planing Phase: The players plan their next moves by adding influence tokens to the board, hiring or assigning gangster cards, so called suspects, to the tasks of attacking, defending or collecting income.

Choose between 9 and 18 holes to make the game longer or shorter (about 1-2 hours of play time). Each of the 18 holes is represented by a unique, hand-drawn map of the area, which is divided into small segments to help players gauge the approximate distance from the tee-off point to the green. Players use different colors of golf ball pawns to track their progress across each map. Just as with actual golf, players will attempt to complete the game in the fewest number of &quot;strokes&quot; possible. For each stroke, a player will first decide whether or not they wish to spin for a &quot;distance bonus&quot;--a free number of segments they are allowed to move their pawn toward the hole. This can be advantageous, but a bad spin also has the potential to land the player in a dangerous sand trap or water hazard (both of which carry a stroke penalty), so the decision should not be made lightly. After resolving or skipping this spin, the player then decides how many dice to throw, from 1 to 3, attempting to land as close to the green as possible. Each pip on the dice represents the player's ball moving forward 1 segment; therefore, if too many or too few dice are thrown, players can easily fall short of, or overshoot, their goal. Once a player lands on the green, they attempt to putt their way into the hole, which involves slightly different dice-rolling mechanics.<br/><br/>At the beginning of the game, each player is also given a number of Skill Cards which can be spent in various ways:<br/>1. A Skill Card can be discarded before a roll to add an extra die. This is helpful for players who wish to have a longer drive, thereby increasing their chances of avoiding a large number of hazards or traps near the center of a map.<br/>2. If a player does land in a hazard or trap, he or she may discard a Skill Card to ignore the stroke penalty of that hazard or trap.<br/>3. A Skill Card may be used to change one die result on a player's putting roll, thereby refining the putting accuracy.<br/>4. Finally, any unspent Skill Cards can be used at the end of the game to subtract a stroke from one's own score, or to add a stroke to an opponent's score.<br/><br/>Also includes a solo variant in which the player attempts to finish all 18 holes in under 72 strokes. This goal is then adjusted according to the player's level of success.<br/><br/>"}, "132565": {"poll": [], "name": "Saw", "videogamemode": ["Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["German PlayStation 3 edition", "German Xbox 360 edition", "North American PlayStation 3 edition", "North American Windows edition", "North American Xbox 360 edition", "UK PlayStation 3 edition", "Windows Downloadable edition"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1461166.jpg", "videogametheme": ["Horror", "Morbid", "Movie, Book, TV show"], "usersrated": "0", "videogamedeveloper": ["Zombie Studios"], "videogamegenre": ["Action Adventure"], "videogameplatform": ["PlayStation 3", "Windows", "Xbox 360"], "average": "0", "statistics": [], "videogamepublisher": ["Konami"], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1461166_t.jpg", "description": "SAW centers on Detective David Tapp who awakens in a decrepit, abandoned asylum.

As they navigated their way through the conflicts erupting on hundreds of worlds, these mercenaries grew in power, prestige, and character. Facing adversity, victory, defeat, and enemies within and without, they were typical of many commands touched &mdash; for ill or for good&mdash;by the Jihad. As the Jihad unfolded through the Jihad Hot Spots plotbooks, players were introduced to the Chaos Campaign, a new game play system that gave players the opportunity to craft their own games around specific battles and events of the Jihad.

There are 54 cards in four 'suits' of eleven and ten reserve cards. The 'suits' are four football teams - Red Rovers, Blue Devils, Green Goblins and Yellow Dwarfs. A team consists of 1 Goalkeeper, 2 Full Backs, 2 Half Backs and 5 Forwards.<br/><br/>Each player receives an equal number of counters. At the start of every hand, a player must pay i unit into the Big Pool (a 'pot' that is taken by the winning player). Everyone then get five cards and can chooseto keep the hand or to discard any number of cards and receive replacements. Once this has been done for everybody, each player may discard the hand or support it. If he does indeed support it, he must pay three units into the Small Pool After everyone has had the chance to discard or support their hand, the hands left in are revealed and the winning player takes the Small Pool. The hands are valued as in Poker, except that it is possible to have five of a kind.<br/><br/>The winning player of each hand may take from his winning hand any cards that he might be needing to form his team. For example, if he was collecting red players and he won the hand with cards Red Full Back x 2 and a red forward, he may take those three cards and lay them out in front of him. When any player has all 11 players of the same colour, he has won. Reserve team players can be in the team, substituting for actual red player cards.<br/><br/>If you run out of units, you are out of the game. The player who first builds a complete team wins and takes the units in the Big Pool. The units seem only to be interesting if you are playing for real money.

The game is a localization of the 1990 Japanese Game Boy game Nekketsu K\u014dha Kunio-kun: Bangai Rant\u014d Hen (\u71b1\u8840\u786c\u6d3e\u304f\u306b\u304a\u304f\u3093 \u756a\u5916\u4e71\u95d8\u7de8, &quot;Hot Blooded Tough Guy Kunio: The Further Brawls), which was part of Techn\u014ds Japan's Kunio series. The graphics, music, and storyline were changed for the international versions.<br/><br/>The player take control of martial artist Billy Lee, who is being hunted down by an organization called the &quot;Scorpions&quot; for murdering one of its members. The objective of the game is to fight off the members of the Scorpions and confront the true culprit, a rival martial artist named Anderson. Unlike the Game Boy version of the first game, a second player can now join anytime via the use of a Game Link Cable, taking control of Billy's brother, Jimmy.<br/><br/>The play mechanics are simplistic compared to previous Double Dragon games. Like in the Game Boy version of the first game, the player has a punch button and a kick button. However, instead of jumping, pressing both buttons will cause the character to kneel. While kneeling, pressing either button will cause the player to perform a jumping uppercut. Instead of the hair grab from previous games, the player will do a collar grab (similar to Renegade), in which the player can repeatedly knee kick the opponent or toss them. The player also leap over fallen opponents as well. Despite the presence of armed enemies, the player cannot disarm them and pick up their weapons like in other Double Dragon games.<br/><br/>The game is composed of three stages, with four levels for the first two stages and two for the final stage (a total of ten levels). The third and final stage is only available when the game is played on the Normal or Hard difficulty setting.<br/><br/>The Japanese version, Nekketsu K\u014dha Kunio-kun: Bangai Rant\u014d Hen, was released on December 7, 1990. The Japanese version features completely different graphics (similar to those featured in Downtown Nekketsu Monogatari, the Japanese version of River City Ransom), music, storyline, and characters (with Kunio and Riki being replaced by Billy and Jimmy in the international versions). However, the play mechanics, level designs, and overall structure of the game are otherwise identical.<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;Double Dragon II (Game Boy)&quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "132635": {"rpgartist": ["Sandy Carruthers", "Master Digital Color"], "rpgitemversion": ["ePub version", "Library bound version", "Paperback version"], "statistics": [], "name": "Twisted Journeys #13: School of Evil", "rpgdesigner": ["Marie P.

This is merely an 'arcade' option of the game, which doesn't explore the minor storyline. The game offers a campaign mode which comprises a group of missions in which these encounters escalate. These missions evolve from incursion defense, to escort duty, even outright assaults.<br/><br/>Players are provided only the Star Ranger spaceship throughout the campaign, but are offered a fair amount of customization of loadout and tuning. You can divert energy to defenses (shield recharge) and offense (plasma gun recharge, autocannon reload). These levels can be adjusted for maximum performance or efficiency, energy being consumed faster in the former than the latter. You acquire a wider variety of missiles for your arsenal as you progress, from 'sharpsticks' to torpedoes.<br/><br/>Enemies vary only slightly, and range from scout craft, to fighters, bombers, transports, cruisers, carriers, and even hostile bases.<br/><br/>Strategy evolves from the mapping system built-in, where the player (and/or his/her wingman) and enemies can travel across a certain area of space. Enemies can attack multiple targets including friendly bases and sensor buoys. Buoys contain map information and so when destroyed or not present act as a rudimentary fog of war. The player has the option, at expense of energy, to warp and near-instantaneously travel across the map to attack, defend, or even refuel at a friendly base.<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;Star Rangers (video game)&quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "132647": {"rpgdesigner": ["Justine Fontes", "Ron Fontes"], "rpgitemversion": ["ePub version", "Library bound version", "Paperback version"], "statistics": [], "name": "Twisted Journeys #19: The Fifth Musketeer", "rpgartist": ["Jennifer Manley Lee", "Dylan Meconis"], "rpgproducer": ["Marshall Dillon"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1458580.jpg", "usersrated": "0", "average": "0", "rpggenre": ["Action / Adventure (Swashbuckling / Pirates)", "Fantasy", "History (Victorian Era)"], "rpgpublisher": ["Graphic Universe"], "rpg": ["Twisted Journeys"], "rpgcategory": ["Solitaire Adventure"], "poll": [], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1458580_t.jpg", "description": "From publisher blurb:<br/><br/>Seventeenth-century France is crawling with bandits, werewolves, and angry swordsmen.

First is the Command and Control enhancement which premiers the first of its kind Radio Line of Sight checks.  All HQ units must check to see if they have good communication and use a Radio Line of Sight to check this.  If the commo check fails the HQ without good commo must check its initiative to see if it will have to attack or regroup or freeze.  The HQ will also have to check and see if the commo check is intercepted and/or located.  When located the HQ becomes a possible target for enemy artillery counter fire.  If the commo check is intercepted the HQ gives up a negative DRM to the enemy player for combats until commo is re-established.  The game will now include Signal units that are the focal point for transmissions and maintaining good commo with subordinate and higher HQ.  The last and most exciting part of this specific enhancement is the inclusion of German Company level counters and an optional Tiger Tank Battalion that could have joined the battle if the Axis High Command hadn't sent it to North Afrika and wasted it.<br/><br/>Each German Division and Soviet Army have a new Task Organization Chart that provides the players a means to change the assignments of Companies in the case of the Germans and Battalions in the case of the Soviets.  These charts are the ultimate in showing the command relationships that change on the battlefield and help to keep the troops organized.<br/><br/>In addition to all this is the Fire Support elements.  Counters that show specific artillery battery assignments and what those assignments mean.  There are artillery mission markers for Direct Support (DS), General Support (GS), and Reinforcing (R).  These missions have specific rules that restrict artillery fire on the field of battle to what they could actually do.  Coupled with the Task Organization charts you will need to plan carefully in order to have the right amount of artillery available to support different parts of your divisions.  The Fire Support Enhancement gives you the ability to fire smoke and even provides for better counter-battery fire.<br/><br/>There are now some new counters to support play.  These are included at the direct request of the playtesters and will help you keep track of when units have fired, moved, opportunity fired, with either secondary or primary weapons, and which units are Out of Command or Out of Supply.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": ["English first edition"], "name": "Death Ride Kursk: Command and Control and Fire Support Enhancements", "playingtime": "0", "boardgamemechanic": ["Hex-and-Counter"], "average": "7.16667", "boardgameexpansion": ["95369"], "usersrated": "6", "boardgamefamily": ["Death Ride"]}, "132655": {"poll": [], "name": "Acrobat Mission", "videogamemode": ["Cooperative", "Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["Japanese Arcade edition", "Japanese Super Famicom edition"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1552472.png", "videogametheme": ["Science Fiction"], "usersrated": "1", "videogamedeveloper": ["Universal Play Land"], "videogamegenre": ["Shoot 'em Up"], "videogameplatform": ["Arcade", "SNES"], "average": "5", "statistics": [], "videogamepublisher": ["Taito", "Teichiku Entertainment, Inc"], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1552472_t.png", "description": "Acrobat Mission is a vertically scrolling shoot 'em up arcade game released by UPL in 1991, licensed to Taito for manufacture and distribution.

And other sets help as well. Neville Chamberlain was still Prime Minister for instance.<br/><br/>The game mechanic is very much like Rummy card games. You draw and discard cards until you get a set. This is laid before you. The same applies to a second set but now you would be out of cards in your hand so then you have to spend three turns just drawing a new card each time. Once you are up to three cards in your hand, you can collect properly again.<br/><br/>Each set has a point value on the card. In general, the British named character sets are worth between 10 and 20 points. The German characters are worth between 5 or 10 points. Hitler is 10, Goering only 5, for example. You might find it strange that Chamberlain is worth 20 but Churchill only 15. Churchill was not Prime Minister at the time of publication so was not worth the 20 you might have expected.<br/><br/>The round ends when one player has three completed sets. That player collects the point value of each set (the rest score nothing) and a game will last until one player achieves a set score agreed upon at the start.

Changes from the standard game:<br/>1) Jumping over: when an opponent's piece is jumped over, either man or king, the player who made the move picks it up and replaces it in a free square at his choice, but of the opposite color. At the beginning, all pieces are positioned as usual on black squares, but in the following the game evolves in two parallel plays. Those plays are interconnected, since a &ldquo;capture&rdquo; made on squares of a color moves the jumped piece on a square of the opposite color. On his  turn, a player can choose to move a piece either on the white or on the black squares. All the other movement rules remain the same. <br/>2)Promotion: as in the standard game, a man is promoted to king when it reaches the opponent's kings row. The player that gained the promotion must choose one of his other men, remove it from the game and place it on top of the promoted piece. Each promotion makes a king from a pair of men, reducing in that way the overall number of pieces on the board.<br/>3) Goal and scoring: the game is won by the first player that promotes all his men to kings. Each player will score one point for each king he has at the end of the game. A match should be composed of an even number of games, to be started alternately by the players.

Later in the game, &quot;colonizer&quot; bombs may be used to change the color of various surfaces, and &quot;splash&quot; bombs absorb colors as they bounce toward their target. Lastly, some levels include energy fields that alter a bombs color as it passes through, as well as reflectors and launchers.<br/><br/>"}, "132712": {"poll": [], "name": "Inside Golf", "playingtime": "30", "minplayers": "1", "boardgamemechanic": ["Roll / Spin and Move"], "yearpublished": "1961", "usersrated": "0", "boardgamefamily": ["Sports: Golf"], "maxplayers": "0", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1457585_t.jpg", "average": "0", "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["(Unknown)"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1457585.jpg", "boardgameversion": ["First edition"], "maxplaytime": "30", "boardgamecategory": ["Sports"], "age": "10", "minplaytime": "30", "description": "Players chose a club and then spin the wheel to determine the outcome of each shot.

Each player starts the game with a Strong Hold card in play, which represents the center of their kingdom. Each player takes turns playing each phase of the game. During each turn players roll dice to represent sending out their peasants to do work for the kingdom. Sometimes these peasants comply and other times they do not. Once the dice are rolled, they are assigned to the corresponding decks. There are 5 decks in all; Fortification (deck 2), Assault (deck 3), Development (deck 4), Devine (deck 5), and Siege (deck 6), there is no deck for 1. If the players have rolled a 1, this peasant decided to slack off and did nothing, so it is assigned to no deck. Players are then able to draw a card for each die they rolled.<br/>Players may draw a card from whatever deck the die was assigned to or any deck below that one in number. For example, if a player rolled a 5, this die is assigned to the 5 deck and the player may choose to draw from the 5 deck or any deck below that one in descending order. In this way, players are able to choose cards from decks strategically.<br/><br/>Once players have drawn their cards, play then moves into the Fortification phase. During this phase, players may play any fortification cards they drew. Fortification cards build up the player&rsquo;s kingdom; they provide a buffer for the Strong Hold. These cards represent towers, walls, and gatehouses. Once each player has done this, play moves on to the Siege phase. During this phase, players play and fire siege equipment such as ballista and catapults. These cards directly target the fortifications of the opposing player.<br/>Players then move on to the Assault phase of the game. During this phase, players play any Assault cards they drew. These cards make up the troops that will be played to attack an opposing player&rsquo;s Strong Hold. These cards have Footmen, Archers, etc. These Assault cards then are able to attack an opposing player&rsquo;s Strong Hold. However, the total power of an assault force is only able to damage a Strong Hold if it is greater than the total amount of Fortification the opposing player possesses.<br/><br/>Throughout all the phases, players are able to build developments and use divine powers (draw from those respective decks) to support their tactics. These cards can be a devastating and tide turning strategy to employ. These cards include; Hand of God, Sapper Bomb, Siege Ladder, Blacksmith, etc. Play continues through these phases until a player&rsquo;s Strong Hold has been reduced to (0).<br/><br/>This is a fast paced game of strategy and luck. The theme is fantasy medieval combat and focuses on divine catholic inspired societal norms of the day. Throughout the game, players feel as though they are in charge of a kingdom and are working to overtake their opponent&rsquo;s kingdom through force of arms and smart planning.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": ["First Edition"], "name": "Throne Wars", "playingtime": "20", "boardgamemechanic": ["Campaign / Battle Card Driven", "Dice Rolling", "Hand Management"], "average": "7.1875", "usersrated": "8", "boardgamesubdomain": ["Customizable Games", "Strategy Games"], "boardgamefamily": ["Crowdfunding: Kickstarter"]}, "132728": {"rpgartist": ["James Dawsey", "Jon Gibbons", "Dan Houser", "Ade Smith"], "rpg": ["ICONS"], "statistics": [], "name": "The USHER Dossiers", "rpgdesigner": ["Charles Rice"], "rpgproducer": ["Dan Houser", "Paula Rice"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1457083.png", "usersrated": "0", "rpgitemversion": ["PDF version"], "average": "0", "rpggenre": ["Action / Adventure (Superheroes)"], "rpgpublisher": ["Vigilance Press"], "rpgcategory": ["Campaign Setting (game world)", "Scenario / Adventure / Module"], "poll": [], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1457083_t.png", "description": "From publisher blurb:<br/><br/>Welcome to the USHER Dossiers!<br/> The official setting for the &ldquo;Vigilance Universe&rdquo; that has appeared in our popular WWII line is now put under the spotlight.

Hoffman or Leveticus. This model is typically well worth the 9 SS cost, and overall has good survivability, a good attack, and consistent damage output.<br/><br/>Overall, the Arachnids are pretty straight forward, and are basic melee attack units.<br/><br/>On the other hand Scatter uses a Summon technique, so if you plan to do the Scatter action, always be sure to use 1 general AP for something else first, and use your (+2) Melee Master and probably Self Repair or Disruption Field as well. Then when you Scatter, if you activated Disruption Field, it will automatically pass onto each of your newly summoned individual Arachnids. When they come into play, since they are Summoned, they are treated as new models, each with their own activation, but they will be Slow during that turn which they were summoned. The Scatter action is also different from Swarm Together, in that the individual Arachnids do not activate immediately, as in the Swarm Together scenario.<br/><br/>Against models with high Df, as mentioned above, Latch On is typically a good approach. One thing that works well is to move a Swarm up to the opponent, as long as it's less than 4&quot; total, attack twice with (+2) Melee Master, activate (0) Disruption Field, and then use the Swarm's last (1) to Scatter. Since you have to put the individual Arachnids in base contact with the Swarm, you should be able to place at least two of the new Arachnids in base contact with your target. Then, when those individual ones get to activate (thus, good to do this at the end of your turn, after your opponent has activated all their models, if possible), you start out with the one not in base contact to move into base contact and (0) Latch On. Then your two Arachnids in base contact can (0) Latch On and attack vs -4 and -6 Df. If you can manage to set this up where your Steamborg Executioner or another Arachnid Swarm still need to activate after all of this, then you should be able to really do some damage. This is one of the best ways to handle high Df opponents like Lilith, Perdita Ortega, or the Coryphee Duet (if you can get them to stand still, that is).<br/><br/>Lastly, the Overwhelm trigger, as mentioned above is one of the most dangerous things about the Arachnid Swarm, and it is worth learning how to utilize it well, both in the game itself, and as a psychological tactic. If your opponent knows that you have not yet activated a Swarm or two in range of some of his better pieces, he may be cautious about playing higher cards from his hand earlier in the turn, because he wants to keep those for cheating up his Df against the potential Swarm attacks. So there are some good mind-games that can be utilized with the Swarm.<br/><br/>"}, "132737": {"poll": [], "name": "Zombie Carnival", "videogamemode": ["Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["iPhone edition"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1555364.png", "videogametheme": ["Horror", "Zombies"], "usersrated": "0", "videogamedeveloper": ["Taito"], "videogamegenre": ["Management", "Tower Defense"], "videogameplatform": ["iPhone"], "average": "0", "statistics": [], "videogamepublisher": ["Taito"], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1555364_t.png", "description": "In this social simulation game you'll have a chance to collect a wide variety of icky and cute zombies, expand and decorate you    r carnival, battle attacking zombies, and interact with other carnival owners!<br/><br/>     Zombies come in all shapes and sizes, from dogs and cats to people and even dinosaurs!<br/>     Make your own unique carnival, adding buildings, roads, decorations, and other landmarks as you see fit!<br/>     Visit your friends' carnivals and call on their support in battle!<br/>     Zombie Enhancement lets you turn your favorite zombies into a formidable fighting force!<br/>     FUSE different zombies to create a variety of new icky and cute creations!<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Source: The Developer Website.<br/><br/>"}, "132738": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1500834.jpg", "poll": [], "boardgamedesigner": ["PK Torretto"], "statistics": [], "yearpublished": "2013", "maxplayers": "2", "boardgameartist": ["Sho Higuchi", "PK Torretto"], "boardgamepublisher": ["(Self-Published)", "PK Torretto"], "maxplaytime": "47", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1500834_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "47", "boardgamecategory": ["Abstract Strategy", "Card Game", "Expansion for Base-game", "Modern Warfare", "Wargame"], "description": "This long awaited expansion to P.O.W.E.R. will now incorporate US Air Force and US Navy units.

Note that because leap is their only 0 action, you might as well try each turn and flip for it.

Players are investors who send prospectors on a quest to find gold at various locations &mdash; in the mountains, in a forest, at a river, etc. &mdash; with each location having perils, gems, quantities of gold and bountiful supplies of silt. As players remove valuable gold cards from the location decks, silt becomes more prominent and gold harder to find.<br/><br/>Each player starts Fool's Gold with six coins and 2-4 prospectors, depending on the number of players. The game lasts five years (i.e., rounds), and at the start of each year, each player receives an additional coin and an additional prospector, giving you both more to spend and more on which to spend. Each year consists of two phases: the prospecting phase and the mining phase. During the prospecting phase, the start player rolls ten dice, then places the dice on the mines of the same number, with 6s being placed in the central camp. Each mine has a path to it starting with the numbered die, then spaces numbered 0-6. After placing dice on the mine paths, players take turns taking one of these actions:<br/><br/><br/>    Place a prospector on a mine path, paying the cost of the space you cover; whenever you pay coins, place them in front of your player screen.<br/>    Place a wild die on a mine path, paying 1 for each die already on the path.<br/>    Place a prospector in front of your screen to take back three coins.<br/>    Pass, place all of your remaining prospectors in reserve next to any mine or mines of your choice, then take back all coins and prospectors in front of your screen.<br/><br/><br/>Once everyone has passed, the mining phase begins. Starting at mine #1, shuffle the mine deck, then draw a number of cards equal to the product of the number of prospectors and the number of dice at the mine. Foul weather forces fewer cards to be drawn, while false alarms might result in treasure being snatched away from everyone. Players then choose rewards from the mine in order of priority, which is determined by the number of prospectors each player has at a mine (include those in reserve) and their location on the path; players must redetermine priority after each action at a mine. The player actions are:<br/><br/><br/>    Take a gold card from the mine.<br/>    Take a gem card from the mine, but only if you don't already have this gem.<br/>    Take two coins from the bank, which gives you additional funds for the rest of the game.<br/>    Lay down your prospector (removing it from priority) and wait for winter.<br/><br/><br/>Once all standing miners have been removed, roll the winter die and draw that many cards for winter. If any goods come up, those layabout prospectors finally get to profit; if not, tough cookies, sourdough! After five rounds, players compare their findings, losing points if they've failed to collect gold from each mine. In addition, each player must throw out all the gold from the mine where he found the most. Turns out it was so easy to find because it was fool's gold! Players then sum their nuggets and score 1-15 points for their gem collection.

A greatly extended version was posted on Usenet in 1984 by Andries Brouwer. It is licensed under a 3-clause BSD-like license.<br/><br/>The object of the game is to delve into a dungeon to retrieve the Amulet of Yendor. The player confronts various monsters: hobgoblins, leprechauns, acid blobs, bats, centaurs, chameleons, dragons, ghosts, imps, trolls, and more. The player must have a fire-resistance ring on to enter Hell, and taking it off while there causes instant death. (In later versions, Hell is renamed and having fire-resistance is no longer necessary.) The player encounters special rooms such as shops, crypts, and vaults. Also found in the game are traps, food items, weapons, tools, armor, potions, scrolls, wands, gems and rings.<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;Hack (Unix video game)&quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "132770": {"rpgdesigner": ["Nadine Ansmann", "Gerrit Ansmann", "Y\u00f6rn Buttelmann", "Stefan Droste", "Andreas Melhorn", "Daniel Neugebauer", "Kaid Ramdani", "Ralf Sandfuchs"], "statistics": [], "name": "Cthulhus Ruf (Issue 2 - Oct 2012)", "rpgartist": ["Nadine Ansmann", "Gerrit Ansmann", "Fran\u00e7ois Launet", "Marc Meiburg"], "rpgproducer": ["Y\u00f6rn Buttelmann", "Stefan Droste", "Marc Meiburg", "Daniel Neugebauer"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1458800.jpg", "usersrated": "1", "average": "6", "rpgissue": ["Cthulhus Ruf"], "rpg": ["Call of Cthulhu (2nd - 6th Edition)"], "rpgpublisher": ["(Self-Published)"], "rpgissueversion": ["issue 2"], "poll": [], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1458800_t.jpg", "description": "(user summary)<br/>issue 2 of Cthulhus Ruf magazine.<br/><br/>table of contents:<br/><br/>preface<br/>Die Fl&uuml;stert&uuml;te - a special column<br/>Eine Herzensangelegenheit - a scenario set in 1920's Cairo<br/>Das Totengericht - on beliefs of death in old Egypt<br/>Fragmente des Grauens - a medieval talke of terror<br/>La Picadura de la Serpiente Corrupta - a mythos tome<br/>One on One - on playing CoC with one keeper and one player<br/>Protect the elder sign! part No 1  - a one-on-one Scenario in modern times<br/>Die Barone - on voodoo<br/>Krieg der Welten - on alien invasions<br/>Count Byaron de Prorok - an NPC<br/>Wanderer - a travel game<br/><br/>"}, "132771": {"poll": [], "name": "2 WAY \u30dc\u30fc\u30c9\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0 \u9003\u8d70\u4e2d \uff06 \u6226\u95d8\u4e2d", "playingtime": "40", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": ["Co-operative Play", "Dice Rolling", "Partnerships", "Roll / Spin and Move"], "yearpublished": "2012", "usersrated": "0", "maxplayers": "5", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1471273_t.jpg", "average": "0", "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["Bandai"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1471273.jpg", "boardgameversion": ["First Edition"], "maxplaytime": "40", "boardgamecategory": ["Movies / TV / Radio theme"], "age": "8", "minplaytime": "40", "description": "Combining two games into one box on a reversible game board, 2 WAY Board Game Tousouchuu &amp; Sentouchuu brings the excitement of the popular Japanese TV game shows to your table.<br/><br/>In Tousouchuu: run for money players must try to avoid being caught by the ultra-fast Hunters while earning more money every second they are in the game.

Players take turns turning them face up and placing them on the board in clockwise order. The clock hand is placed in the center of the board. The wooden cuckoo is placed on the red twelve. The 24 cards are distributed evenly among the players. They show what the cuckoo is doing (watching TV, going for a hike etc.) and how long it takes him (1-4 hours).<br/><br/>Game play: The starting player spins the clock's hand. The hand shows the time at which the cuckoo has to be back to call out the hour. Then the active player puts a card next to the board and moves the cuckoo 1-4 spaces, depending on the duration that the card states. If the cuckoo lands on a space before the time indicated by the clock's hand, the cuckoo is too early. He's got time for another activity and it is the next player's turn now. If the cuckoo lands on space indicated by the clock's hand, he is just on time. As a reward, the player may place another card of his/her choice on the stack next to the board.

This can be any enemy model that is in play, and indeed a pair of Shikome may opt to hunt the same target.<br/><br/>&quot;(0) Hunting Partner&quot; only affects friendly Beasts, but it does give them the advantage of fast, and a plus flip to hit and damage against the Shikomes prey. Within the resurrectionist faction this only applies to Rogue Necromancy, Night Terrors and another Shikome. It is worth using on another shikome with the same prey as it adds another positive modifier to the attack and damage flips.<br/>The bonus from the Hunting Partner will last until the closing phase.<br/>Don't assume that Shikome need to kill their prey.

It depends on your style of play, but its usually not that recommended as giving up a turn to just say &quot;I'm coming for you and only you&quot; can be quite wasteful as in that same turn you could have your Shikome move to attack any model in charge range.

All other playing pieces are stored -together with the prince charming playing piece- in a mechanical and musical wishing well. The players then start their journey through the forest trying to reach Cinderella's castle before the other players do. In order to win the game, they must transform their playing piece into the prince charming piece before reaching the castle.<br/><br/>For that purpose, players roll-and-move through the forest and whenever they reach a transformation square they may (depending whether their playing piece is shown on the square or not) transform into another creature. To do so, they drop their playing piece in an empty slot of the wishing well, then spin the handle on the well until another creature 'magically' pops up out of the well.

Being the younger of the two, Hotsuma looked up to Moritsune, and considered his older brother to be a superior warrior. Eventually, the Oboro Clan commandment was revealed to the two boys after they discovered Akujiki, the evil soul-stealing sword that would be used in the ritual to decide the clan's leader. The commandment deems that the next clan leader must be determined by a duel to the death between the eldest clan heirs-in this case, Moritsune and Hotsuma. Aware of their destiny, the brothers trained incessantly, instructed by their foster parent, Kobushi.<br/>Shinobi is a 3D action-adventure game viewed from a third-person perspective. The player guides protagonist Hotsuma through eight levels that each consist of two sections and a boss battle. Gameplay consists of quickly moving through levels and killing enemies. The game does not feature checkpoints, but allows the player to continue from the start of a boss battle should they die.<br/><br/>Combat is hack and slash-based, involving large numbers of recurring enemies. Hotsuma's sword, Akujiki, is his primary weapon. Akujiki feeds on souls, initially devouring those of the enemies he kills, then that of Hotsuma himself if he does not kill any enemies for too long. This leads to an emphasis on killing all enemies in a battle as quickly as possible. To ensure that Akujiki's hunger remains sated, Hotsuma can kill four or more enemies with no more than a few seconds between each kill to perform an exaggeratedly violent &quot;TATE&quot; attack that will release more souls for Akujiki. The mechanic of jumping from enemies after dispatching them adds an element of platform gameplay.<br/><br/>Hotsuma can also use shurikens to briefly paralyze his enemies. Three types of ninja magic are available to him: &quot;Ka'en&quot;, an area-based fire attack; &quot;Kamaitachi&quot;, a ranged shock wave attack; and &quot;Raijin&quot;, which grants him invincibility for a short period of time.<br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;<a target='_blank' href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shinobi_(2002_video_game),&quot' rel='nofollow'>http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shinobi_(2002_video_game),&quot</a>; available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "132850": {"poll": [], "name": "Attack of the Heavenly Bats", "videogamemode": ["Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["Web Browser edition"], "average": "0", "videogametheme": ["Cute Fantasy"], "usersrated": "0", "videogamedeveloper": ["(Self-Developed Video Game)"], "videogamegenre": ["Action", "Platform"], "videogameplatform": ["Web Browser"], "statistics": [], "videogamepublisher": ["(Web published)"], "description": "User Summary<br/><br/>An action platformer with weapon upgrades.

The focus characters are people, or anything that seems to have a free will and is able to act, who know that the end of the world is coming and they need to prepare for that. How that is done, everybody needs to decide for himself. They can be humans, fantastic characters, mutant animals, robots, ethereal creatures or anything in between.<br/><br/>The artificial intelligence controls the quantum information field and alters it to better represent its vision of the world and to provide interesting twists on the fates of the settlement's inhabitants. It also awards achievements to the inhabitants for doing particularly grand, interesting, clever or stupid things.<br/><br/>In their quest to prepare, a lot of threats and complications will come the characters' ways and they will have to struggle to achieve their goals. However, the ways of the quantum field are tricky and the truth will most likely not be obvious. Things can be retroactively different than thought of before, people and threats can appear out of nowhere, sudden links can tie objects far apart together. It's a mysterious world.<br/><br/>Also, the settlement itself is a weird place. Of course, the inhabitants don't think that but when compared to the players' world, it shows some peculiarities. It literally resides on the edge of the world. The sun is about to set, maybe forever. In this very last stage of the world, the light always comes from the sides, producing harsh shadows and golden glitter. The structure of the settlement seems to be more vertical than horizontal, leading to steep falls, wooden ladders, glass elevators and some vertigo.

Or have you ever wondered that your RPG character cannot do the things he should be able to do because you learned the wrong skills in the beginning? If you answered one or both questions with yes than storytelling-RPGs like Storychips might have something to offer for you. The general idea is that the players describe what they like to do and that they succeed if they can convince the gamemaster that they can do what they want to do and/or that it is good for the story if they have success.<br/><br/>There is one problem that can arise with these storytelling games: If everybody can do everything he can explain good enough than it is not really a game but rather creative &quot;writing&quot; in a group. This does not have to be a bad thing. Telling stories to each other or making up stories together is a great pastime but if you want to have a &quot;real&quot; game you have to add something else.

The game incorporates many different gameplay aspects from previous Forza Motorsport titles, like the large variety of cars, realistic physics and high definition graphics. The aim is to progress through the game by means of obtaining &quot;Wristbands&quot; by driving fast, destroying property, winning races and other driving antics. Horizon is set to feature the physics of Forza Motorsport 4, which have been optimised to work on the 65 variants of terrain said to be present in the game. Players will be able to drive anywhere their cars can reach, such as fields and plains.<br/><br/>Multiple race types are included, from drift to rally and point-to-point races. AI traffic will be present on the roads, which provides a new dynamic to the Forza racing system. Players may also challenge other Horizon festival drivers they encounter in a one-on-one race to a given location. The location is random each time, and the AI have the ability to use shortcuts to their advantage. Races will take place at different times throughout the day/night cycle included in the game, including night races. A skill system is implemented in the game; players earn street cred during races by driving aggressively. Acts such as as drifting, jumping over obstacles and getting a car on two wheels all contribute to the cred. These can be chained together in a combo, which in turn affects the money players are paid at the end of a given race. Cred also affects a player's popularity level in the game. As a player's popularity increases new special events are unlocked, such as races against helicopters and planes.<br/><br/>Speed traps are present in the game, and players can challenge each other for the top speed in a given area. Cameras record player times, which can then be shared among rivals. Those rivals can then attempt to beat the shared time. A photography mode is also included. In addition to races, players can search for barn find cars&mdash;cars that have been stored away for long periods of time&mdash;have them restored, and add them to their car collection.<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;Forza Horizon&quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "132940": {"poll": [], "name": "Just Dance: Disney Party", "videogamemode": ["Local Multiplayer", "Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["English/European Wii edition", "English/European Xbox 360 edition", "North American Wii edition", "North American Xbox 360 edition"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2352121.jpg", "videogameseries": ["Just Dance"], "videogametheme": ["Music"], "videogamegenre": ["Rhythm"], "videogamedeveloper": ["Ubisoft Entertainment S.A.

In addition to being a game, it is also used as occult sorcery with each occult initiate expected to make their own boards and pieces.<br/><br/>There are two versions of the game, the simple and the advanced. The simple game has seven boards placed one above the other in a spiral, with the boards named after particular stars. Each board has nine black and nine white squares, making 126 squares in total over the seven boards. Each player (white and black) starts the game with three sets of nine pieces (27 pieces per player) with each piece allowed to move across a board, and up or down from board to board, in a different way. Only some types of pieces can capture other opposing pieces, and a captured piece is removed from the boards and plays no further part in the game.<br/><br/>The seven boards are named Naos, Deneb, Rigel, Mira, Antares, Arcturus, and Sirius. At the start of the game, each player has six particular pieces on Sirius, three pieces on Arcturus, six pieces on Antares, three on Rigel, six on Deneb, three on Naos, and none on Mira. As in other board games, the players take turns to make their moves.<br/><br/>The basic rule of play is that after a piece has been moved - whether across a board or from one board to a higher or lower board - it is transformed into another piece according to a set sequence and then can be moved according to its new designation. Another rule is that pieces can only stay on the Mira board for three moves.<br/><br/>The basic aim of the simple form of the game is for one player to place three of their pieces on certain squares on Mira, with the type of these pieces and their placing on that board decided by both players beforehand. The first player to do this wins the game. This takes some skill and some time since not only can an opposing player capture pieces on Mira but also pieces are only allowed to stay on Mira for three moves, after which the player must move the piece. Depending on the skill of the player, to win a simple game takes from a few hours to a day or more.<br/><br/>In the advanced Game, each board has six (minor) boards (three at each end), with there being additional pieces (more sets of nine for each player making 81 pieces per player). There are also additional rules regarding movement. In this version of The Star Game, each board is divided into three other levels so that there are four levels to each board, making a total of 308 squares over the seven main boards. Depending on the skill of the player, to win an advanced game can take several days.<br/><br/>In both the simple and the advanced games, the pieces are usually small tetrahedrons (or small squares) marked with the particular abstract symbol (or the particular occult symbol) which is used to designate that type of piece.<br/><br/>Complete game rules are outlined in &quot;NAOS: A Practical Guide to Modern Magick&quot;.

For example, he had players acting as town mayor, banker, and university chancellor. When two players challenged each other to a duel, Wesely found it necessary to improvise rules for the encounter on the spot. Though Wesely thought the results were chaotic and the experiment a failure, the other players enjoyed the role playing aspect and asked him to run another game.<br/><br/>Wesely thus contributed to the development of RPGs by introducing: (1) a one-to-one identification of player and character, and (2) open-ended rules allowing the players to perform any action, with the result of the action determined by the referee.<br/><br/>[*] 1969: Tresca, Michael J.
