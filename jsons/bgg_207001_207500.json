Pitcher rolls 1D6: 1-3 = ball; 4-6 = strike. Batter may take or swing. If he swings, rolls 1D6: matching the pitch number is a square hit; rolling an adjacent number is a weak hit.<br/><br/>On a hit, player rolls 3D6 for a weak hit and 4D6 for a square hit. The total indicates a location on the field, each of which is either an out or has a picture of a die with a target number from 2 to 6. The defending player rolls a D6, and if he rolls &gt;= the target number, the player is out. If not, the batter gets at least one base. The defender rolls again, adding the result to the previous, and if the total still fails to reach the target number, the runner gets another base and a third roll is made. Batting totals of 19, 22 and 24 are home runs.<br/><br/>The unique feature of the game is that it is designed to be played with regular baseball trading cards, so that players can use their favorite real-life players in their line-ups and keep statistics on their performance over a season. The game includes 18 generic cards (2 for each position) that can be used as is, or customized with names.<br/><br/>There are additional rules for double and triple plays, sacrifice bunts, base stealing, clutch pitching and slugging.<br/><br/>"}, "207005": {"rpgartist": ["Gregor Hutton", "Eric Quigley", "JB Roe"], "rpgitemversion": ["Digital Edition (Final)", "Softcover Version"], "statistics": [], "name": "International Incident", "rpgdesigner": ["Nathan D.

The goal is to capture the opponent's King Checker. Checkers make chess moves based on the roll of a special pair of dice. One die -- the Numbers Die -- is a standard D6. The other -- the Chess Die -- has the 6 chess symbols.<br/><br/>Roll a King, Knight or Pawn and pick ANY checker -- including your King Checker -- to move as King, Pawn or Knight. The Numbers Die does not matter on these rolls. Roll a Queen, Bishop or Rook and Numbers Die tells you how far the checker MUST move as a Queen, Bishop or Rook. So, if you roll a BISHOP 6, the checker you select must move diagonally for 6 spaces, unless it makes a capture, hits the edge of the board or is blocked by a fellow piece.<br/><br/>Again, any checker can be moved by any roll of the dice. So, the King Checker may move as a Knight or a Pawn or even a Queen 6 if desired. But no checker retains any chess rank after the completion of the turn. Every roll of the dice wipes the slate clean. For the length of the turn, the selected pieces behave as chess pieces. But pawns do not get 2 spaces on their first turn. They don't get promoted for reaching the opposite side of the board. But they do still capture diagonally. There is no check or checkmate or castling. Just capture the king.<br/><br/>Roll a King on your first turn, and you may flip your King Checker over. This hides your king -- STEALTH MODE -- and your opponent has to keep track of it to capture it and win.<br/><br/>"}, "207044": {"poll": [], "name": "Owlboy", "videogamemode": ["Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["Windows Downloadable edition"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3292351.png", "videogametheme": ["Furries / Talking Animals"], "usersrated": "4", "videogamecharacter": ["Asio", "Bonacci", "Fib", "Geddy", "Otus", "Solus"], "videogamedeveloper": ["D-Pad Studio"], "videogamegenre": ["Platform"], "videogameplatform": ["Windows"], "videogamehonor": ["2010 IGF Awards Excellence In Visual Art Nominee", "2017 D.I.C.E.

Beer! also tests your knowledge with crazy categories like Types of Liquor, Cartoon Dogs, and Excuses for Not Making Love. If you win, you get to assign LOTS of drinks to the other players!<br/><br/>RULES<br/><br/>Object: To end a game with the highest cumulative number of drinks on the drink cards in your hand<br/><br/>Setup: Deal each player five cards. Place the rest of<br/>the deck face down in the center of the table.<br/><br/>Play: A player begins a turn by either &quot;knocking&quot; (see below) or by playing a card After a card is played, take the appropriate action, then the player draws a replacement card. The player to the left of the dealer takes the first turn and play continues clockwise around the table. Stack the played cards in a pile face up next to the draw pile<br/><br/>Card Values: If you play a drink card (One, Two Three, Four, or Six Drinks), assign that number of drinks to a player. Play a Social card and everyone drinks. For Blackout, select a player to lose a turn. If you play Steal, take a card from the player of your choice. (Don't look at the other player's hand and she draws a replacement card, you do not.) For the Drunken Hookup card, you select two players who either kiss or drink three drinks each (they decide)<br/><br/>Category Cards: If you play a category card, select one of the categories on the card and announce it to the group. Players then take turns naming items that fit into that category. You name the first item, then continue around the table until a player either repeats an item or cannot think of anything else that fits in the category. Allow 10 seconds per turn. The person<br/>making the mistake takes a drink<br/><br/>Knocking: If a player knocks instead of playing a card, that is the signal that the player wants to end the round. Each player following the knocker gets one last turn, then everyone shows their hands. Add up your cumulative drinks by counting the number of drinks on each drink card in your hand. The player with the highest number wins the round. you knock but do not win, take five penalty drinks. (Note: the round also ends if you reach the end of the deck and no one has knocked.)<br/><br/>Assigning Drinks: The winner hands out his drink cards to whomever he chooses. Drink the number of drinks on each card that is given to you. (lf players tie each winner assigns only three drink cards.)<br/><br/>"}, "207076": {"poll": [], "name": "Deus Ex Go", "videogamemode": ["Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["Android edition"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3537138.png", "videogameseries": ["Deus Ex"], "videogametheme": ["Cyberpunk"], "usersrated": "0", "videogamedeveloper": ["Square Enix Montreal"], "videogamegenre": ["Puzzle"], "videogameplatform": ["Android"], "videogamehonor": ["2016 CVA Best Animation of the Year Nominee", "2016 CVA Best Art Direction of the Year Nominee", "2016 CVA Best Audio of the Year Nominee", "2016 CVA Best Canadian-Made Game of the Year Nominee", "2016 CVA Best Game Innovation of the Year Nominee", "2016 CVA Best Mobile/Handheld Game of the Year Nominee", "2016 CVA Best Soundtrack of the Year Nominee", "2016 CVA Game of the Year Nominee", "2016 Global Game Awards Best Mobile Game of the Year Nominee", "2017 British Academy Game Awards Best Handheld/Mobile Game of the Year Nominee", "2017 D.I.C.E.

Where Ajax relied on customized cargo containers to fulfill vital roles, Telemon provides dedicated space for crew quarters and other necessities. A version with cargo bays rather than containers is also provided.<br/>    Next is a set of HMT 337 cargo containers customized to serve as prefabricated structures for a fledgling colony. To efficiently move these colony pods into place is the Tri-TOAD &ndash; a more powerful version of the boxy VTOL craft.<br/>    Finally, Future Armada ends up where it started with a variant of the CSS Morningstar &ndash; the flagship of the series. Starlance is a Fenris-class warship reworked with an mercenary or adventuring group in mind. It has fewer bunks but tons of extra space for fighters, a shuttle, and a lot more cargo.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>The goal is to add a sense of continuity to your universe by providing an evolution of some well known vessels.

But sometimes, it can be fun to take on the mantle of the otherworldly, and to embrace the alien terrors of the cosmos.

Each of the archetypes in this book builds on themes of aquatic adaptation, monstrous features and appearance, a strange call to the sea, and terrible transformations into deep ones. This book contains the following archetypes:<br/><br/>    The shore strider, an arcanist archetype that draws magical power from proximity to the ocean, and can mentally command ocean life.<br/>    The deepspawn broodmate, a hunter archetype with deep one lineage, who trades in the standard animal companion for a deep one companion, instead.<br/>    The channeler of the deep, a medium archetype very much at home in the waves, and which can mentally possess aquatic creatures.<br/>    The deep one ancestry, a psychic discipline, for those whose powers come from a familial connection to the spawn of Dagon.<br/>    The benthic infiltrator, a vigilante archetype who doesn&rsquo;t just don a mask, but sheds his human disguise to rampage as a horrible monstrosity from the deep.<br/>    A bonus cleric domain devoted to those who worship Father Dagon.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>"}, "207105": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3155149.jpg", "poll": [], "boardgamedesigner": ["Ole Steiness"], "statistics": [], "yearpublished": "2016", "maxplayers": "4", "age": "10", "boardgamepublisher": ["Grey Fox Games"], "maxplaytime": "90", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3155149_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "60", "boardgamecategory": ["Adventure", "Dice", "Expansion for Base-game", "Fantasy", "Fighting", "Medieval"], "description": "From Dice Tower Season 12 Kickstarter Campaign<br/><br/>A new troll card<br/><br/>Attack value of 4<br/>Defense Value of 3<br/>Worth 9 Glory<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": ["First edition"], "name": "Champions of Midgard: SeeZam Promo Card", "playingtime": "90", "boardgamemechanic": ["Dice Rolling", "Set Collection", "Worker Placement"], "average": "7.66667", "boardgameexpansion": [], "usersrated": "18", "boardgamefamily": ["Vikings"]}, "207106": {"poll": [], "name": "Fly and Destroy", "videogamemode": ["Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["Windows/Macintosh/Linux Downloadable Edition"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3143601.jpg", "videogametheme": ["Space"], "usersrated": "1", "videogamedeveloper": ["Just1337"], "videogamegenre": ["Action", "Shoot 'em Up"], "videogameplatform": ["Linux", "Macintosh", "Windows"], "average": "4", "statistics": [], "videogamepublisher": ["KupiKey"], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3143601_t.jpg", "description": "User Summary<br/><br/>You gather energy and set traps for asteroids to gather even more energy.<br/><br/>"}, "207107": {"boardgamedesigner": ["Lou Coatney"], "average": "0", "poll": [], "name": "Murmansk Run:  Arctic Convoys to Russia", "playingtime": "300", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": ["Dice Rolling", "Point to Point Movement", "Secret Unit Deployment", "Simulation"], "yearpublished": "2016", "usersrated": "0", "maxplayers": "4", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3145611_t.jpg", "boardgameartist": ["Lou Coatney"], "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["(Self-Published)"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3145611.jpg", "boardgameversion": ["First edition"], "maxplaytime": "300", "boardgamecategory": ["Bluffing", "Nautical", "Print & Play", "Wargame", "World War II"], "age": "8", "minplaytime": "210", "description": "Game description from the designer:<br/><br/>Simple/abstracted.  9 seasonal turns, Spr42-Spr44.

It's an experience of survival, betrayal, and fragile alliances in the moments before Earth is annihilated. Anyone who doesn't want to die on the soon-to-be-burning rock will have to team up with a partner to outfit their janky rocket transport for the interplanetary jump. But everyone's looking out for number one, and alliances can change at any time.<br/><br/>Every turn, each player secretly decides which direction to send their rocket. They reveal their choices simultaneously, then take turns collecting resources from the board, or stealing them from each other. This would all be safe and pleasant if it weren't for the deadly meteor that will strike at the end of the round, drastically altering the map and damaging any rockets in its path. One player knows in advance where the meteor will hit, but depending on who they choose to share that information with &hellip; well, friends tend to come and go during the meteor apocalypse.<br/><br/>To win the game, you and one other player will both need to acquire enough resources to launch, prep your rocket, then survive for one more round without getting stolen from or blown up. There's no limit on the number of teams that can pull this off &ndash; it's even possible for everyone (or almost everyone) to win, as long as everyone plays nice. But once the first wave of rockets launch, anybody left on the planet is stuck.

And that is true of both the physical product and the in-world game as it is played. Hidden within the pages of the books, within the components of the game, and perhaps even within the box itself, lie clues to discover&mdash;clues that can unlock new secrets. Invisible Sun is as much about interacting with the physical game itself as it is about interacting with the other players. This is a game of deep immersion. Of escape.<br/><br/>Players create in-depth and intricate characters where the house in which they live is as important as their stats and skills. Character choices drive everything, with game rewards based on personalized story arcs, and emergent mechanics arising from not just from character creation, but from ongoing character development. However, in the end, it&rsquo;s not game mechanics that dominate gameplay, but roleplaying.<br/><br/>Player characters in Invisible Sun discover and utilize secrets. These secrets often involve the very nature of the universe, and those who master such secrets can change that nature. In common parlance, this is magic, and thus player characters are magicians and sorcerers called vislae. How they utilize their magic&mdash;casting spells, creating objects of great power, entreating with otherworldly spirits, or improvising effects by weaving together threads of power&mdash;is up to them. Character creation and customization are paramount, and no character concept is refused. In a game where everything is possible, it&rsquo;s never a matter of &ldquo;You can&rsquo;t do that,&rdquo; but &ldquo;How do you go about discovering the secret to do that?&rdquo;<br/><br/>"}, "207141": {"rpgartist": ["Eric Lofgren", "William McAusland", "James V.

The game engine is designed around an individual player's ability or inability to win battles or one-on-one matchups.  Each play from scrimmage calls on one or more players to make a play that will influence the result.  Offensive players will block, read defenses, read holes, get open, pass, catch and run, all in an attempt to make a positive play for the offense. Defensive players will play the run, tackle, hit, rush the passer, sack the passer, defend pass routes, intercept the ball and force fumbles all in an attempt to make a positive play for the defense.  The task(s) on each play and the player(s) involved are determined by a GAME CENTER Chart which serves as the centerpiece for game play. A double-sided Play Result Card deck is used in conjunction with the GAME CENTER to determine who is involved on the play and what the result of the play is.  Nearly all plays from scrimmage come from the Play Result Deck, GAME CENTER Chart and individual player cards.  Long Gains, Special Teams, Trick Plays, Turnovers and Injuries get their results from a series of supplemental charts.  On any given play, an offensive player, defensive player or a combination of the two can influence the result.

On top of that, the deadly dragon will appear once in awhile and raze the lands. If your castle is not well fortified against dragon attacks, it might just crumble! Score Victory Points (VP) by having the most number of important folks residing in your castle, as well as have the most magnificent castle of all and take home the title of Grand Duke! Castle Dukes is a very visually appealing game of Dexterity and Strategy - And it's 3D to boot!<br/><br/>Each round, players start with 5 Coins. 6 Room cards are revealed from the stack and placed in positions 1 through 6 (from bottom to top), each room costing a higher amount of Coins to acquire than the last. The player with the First Player token gets first rights to the Room cards, passing the turn in clockwise direction until all players have had their chance to acquire rooms with their Coins. Rooms acquired leave a gap on their position and are not replaced with new cards during any player's turn. At the end of the whole turn after every player has had a chance at the rooms, any remaining room cards are then moved downwards to fill any gaps. Draw more Room cards from the Room Stack to fill all positions as needed. It is possible to choose not to acquire any Room card during a player's turn. Note: In the various positions 1 through 6, players also acquire additional castle components such as Tables and Coffers along with the Room cards, as depicted on the position on the main game board.<br/><br/>Once done, all players then simultaneously acquire pillars, Floor Tiles, and Construction cards using their remaining Coins. They may then immediately build the newly acquired components, adding on layers to their castles until they gradually become beautiful fortresses of various shapes and heights. When all players are done with this next phase, a Guest card is revealed to show which Guests have dropped by for that turn. The princess always goes for the most comfortable castle, even if its flimsy. The king's life is very precious and he always seeks out the most defended castle. The knight looks for glory and always goes for the castle that best gives him the chance to slay a dragon. This is the end of a turn in Castle Dukes. The First Player token is now passed on to the right, and a new turn begins with each player having 5 Coins again. And yes, a dragon might appear now and then to attack all castles! Depending on your level of Defence or Offence, each castle will take varying amounts of damage.<br/><br/>Beware! This is also a dexterity game! If at any point in the game your castle collapses, be it a small portion or even just one tiny component falling off, you will take a Crumble token which at the end of the game reduces your Victory Points by 2!<br/><br/>"}, "207203": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3148614.jpg", "poll": [], "boardgamedesigner": ["Emilio Fabbri", "Riccardo Lucidi", "Simone Mancini", "Enrico Navarra", "Gianluca Torrente"], "statistics": [], "yearpublished": "2017", "maxplayers": "4", "boardgameartist": ["Chamba", "Lorenzo Giusti", "Javier Bordon Kuzminski", "Eric Ou", "Maichol Quinto"], "boardgamepublisher": ["(Self-Published)"], "maxplaytime": "120", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3148614_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "60", "boardgamecategory": ["Dice", "Fighting", "Miniatures", "Science Fiction"], "description": "Description from the publisher:<br/><br/>War Titans is the first Crawling Chaos Games project: a cooperative game in which players face hordes of Invaders.

Whichever team wins the most mini-games in the series takes the cup!<br/><br/>Coaches start the game with a team, which consists of 15 1st level players. On his turn a coach sends one offensive player to make 1 trick, and the other coach sends one defensive player to prevent the trick. Next, both players may use one of their special actions. An unprevented trick leads to goal. At the end of third period, if the score is tied, they play overtime, which is followed by a penalty shootout. After every game, a coach uses 3 experience points to raise the level of his players. A 2nd level player can make 2 tricks, 3rd level - 3 tricks.<br/><br/>"}, "207213": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3145900.jpg", "poll": [], "boardgamedesigner": ["Stefan Risthaus"], "statistics": [], "yearpublished": "2016", "maxplayers": "4", "boardgameartist": ["Christian Fiore"], "boardgamepublisher": ["OSTIA Spiele"], "maxplaytime": "20", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3145900_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "15", "boardgamecategory": ["Expansion for Base-game"], "description": "Tallinn: The Elders is a mini-expansion for Tallinn that consists of three large figures and stickers.<br/><br/>During the game, the first player to have at least five symbols of a faction on their played influence cards (and not their start card) claims the matching large figure, which doubles the associated faction total on their tower cards at the end of the game.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": ["English/German first edition"], "age": "10", "name": "Tallinn: The Elders", "playingtime": "20", "average": "6.75", "boardgameexpansion": [], "usersrated": "6", "boardgamefamily": ["Cities: Tallinn"]}, "207214": {"rpgdesigner": ["Maria Smolina"], "rpg": ["Pathfinder System Compatible Product"], "poll": [], "name": "Avalon Haunts 04", "rpgartist": ["Lord Zsezse Works"], "rpgproducer": ["Robert Hemminger"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3514075.png", "usersrated": "0", "rpgitemversion": ["PDF version"], "average": "0", "statistics": [], "rpggenre": ["Fantasy (High Fantasy)", "Horror (Supernatural)"], "rpgpublisher": ["Avalon Games"], "rpgcategory": ["Scenario / Adventure / Module"], "rpgseries": ["Avalon Haunts"], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3514075_t.png", "description": "From publisher blurb:<br/><br/>Need something a bit scary for your game?

The first drive on St. Louis had been repulsed and Van Dorn was summoned to take command of the force and launch a new offensive into the heart of Missouri. Van Dorn, an Indian-fighting cavalryman by trade, arrived at the Rebel camp and even though he was quite ill (due to a fall into a river) he immediately roused the troops. He proposed to launch an immediate attack, despite the freezing weather and fatigued state of his troops. Van Dorn force-marched the army north and managed to pull off a classic Napoleonic stratagem - the &ldquo;maneuver sur la derrieres&rdquo;. He placed his army astride the line of communications of his enemy and by any normal military measure this should have been settled the issue for the two armies. But by doing so at such an ill-advised time and at such an inhuman pace the Rebel troops were little more than a frozen and exhausted armed mob when they finally reached their positions. <br/> Brig. General Sam Curtis was not a man to be intimidated and he realized that he had a fighting chance, even in this seemingly impossible position.

Then you will take the fight to the invader, trying to drive it out of the mind of its human host, or destroying it completely.  But it will not be easy.  The invader is completely alien, and uses deckbuilding to achieve its goals.  Meanwhile you must use six sided dice to achieve yours.<br/><br/>The Invader gets the first turn.  On the Invader turn you draw 3 cards from the Invader deck, each showing a different fear, such as Ghosts or Spiders.  Any guests afraid of these fears become panicked.  If the Invader can panic a guest 5 times before you wake them, they succumb to the will of the Invader and their card is added to the Invader deck, making it stronger.<br/><br/>On your turn, you roll 6 dice.  Each die can be used once.  If a die roll is high enough, you can use it to calm down a guest and if you calm the guest completely, they wake up and are removed from play.  Dice can also be used to learn extra skills and abilities, such as removing the Invader's health, or adding distractions to the Invader deck.<br/><br/>It's a battle of dice versus cards.

The steadings of the region all worked with each other, one in particular, the dwarves of Smitheim defended the region from the horrors that creep from the depths of the Grytfell mountains. One of such horrors is Ugothos, it appeared long ago emerging from a meteorite that fell on the mountain near the area now known as the Grytt Crater. The dwarves managed to seal it then a few days back another meteorite fell which released Uguthos, the dwarves failed to seal him again and fearing the madness and corrupting Uguthos brought would spread through the water, they closed the dams they controlled which gave water to most of the steadings of the region. Its been now 5 days since the dams were closed and no one knows why. To make things worse, it hasn't rained a single inch either (even when magically induced) and wells are drying out one by one. The adventurers come into the region to investigate what is going on, discover the Uguthos danger, find a way to reseal the creature and save the region (and the world) from succumbing to its corruption.<br/><br/>This product contains A 59 page adventure for Dungeon World with<br/><br/>    One primary danger and two optional ones depending on what the characters do.<br/>    Four fleshed out steadings, each with their own map<br/>    Four dungeons and one optional dungeon.

With a simple but powerful narrative game system and unique character motivation and evolution mechanics, City of Mist will let you experience just what happens when everyday life on the streets awakens to unfathomable mythical forces from within.<br/><br/>City of Mist is a role-playing game of film-noir investigation and super-powered action. It is set in a modern metropolis rife with crime, conspiracies, and mysteries. The protagonists are Gateways, ordinary people who became the living embodiment of a legend, their Mythos. While your Gateways may seek to strike a balance between the mysterious nature of their Mythos and their mortal aspirations, the powers within them always threaten to tear their lives apart. They have unwittingly become a part of a secret world of clashing stories, and soon other legends will come looking for them with demands.<br/><br/>City of Mist is based on the story-driven Apocalypse Engine, but it takes a step further into narrative gaming by introducing several new features:<br/><br/>    Rich character motivations built around compelling Mysteries and Identities. Follow your characters&rsquo; themes to gain their benefits and evolve them or go against them to discover new aspects with a unique non-linear character evolution system.<br/>    Know no limits for powers, abilities, traits, gear, or allies. Everything in City of Mist is described by free text tags, so you can create exactly the character you want.<br/>    Full-on narrative engine, with an edge. Every action you take in the game is based on the interpretation of your tags, using moves to deliver dramatic outcomes that drive the story forward.<br/>    Status spectrums, a new system of &lsquo;narrative damage.&rsquo; You can use descriptors to create any imaginable setback or advantage so that every action in the fiction, in and out of combat, can have lasting gameplay implications.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>", "usersrated": "3", "rpgitemversion": ["PDF version"], "average": "8.33333", "rpggenre": ["Action / Adventure (Superheroes)", "Crime (Mystery / Detective / Noir)", "Fantasy (Modern Urban Fantasy)"], "rpgpublisher": ["Son of Oak Game Studio"], "rpgcategory": ["Quick Start / Fast Play Rules"], "poll": [], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3148115_t.png", "rpgpodcastepisode": ["173.

Drawn from a variety of cultures and traditions, even a few from the neighboring Baltic lore of Finland and Germany, these creatures range from CR 1 to 21 and range from mild and almost benevolent spirits of home and hearth to dreadful doombringers of titanic size and terrifying evil. The kindly kikimora might tend house and home from her humble hidey-hole, but her irascible temper can make her unpredictable at best, much like the wise but wily vodyanoi, just as likely to bargain and banter as to drown and devour anyone that displeases them, or even trap their soul for all eternity. A triumvirate of humble house spirits guard and tend the home fires, including the hot-tempered ovinnik, the industrious domovoi, and the garden guardian dvorovoi. The Slavic spirits of nature are beautiful and terrible in turn, from the graceful air veela and their delightful dance of death to the metamorphic and misty etiainen and the seductive rusalka trapped just beneath the water's surface, all too eager to add another conquest to their boudoir of bodies. These beasts of the east can be vicious like the hungry vukodlak or the cunning bagiennik, with savage serpents from the venomous tiny tatzlwyrm to the titanic three-headed gorynych. As if a dozen existing monsters were not enough, the brand-new stalimedved is an ironclad dreadnought, a mighty mystic bear perverted through foul enchantments into a steel-shod engine of destruction.

This game was initially designed as a game-base learning tool at the London School of Economics and Political Science to introduce students to collective decision-making, game theory and market regulation. The game scales well at different player counts and plays under 1 hour. Gamers and non-gamers alike will enjoy Kill the Bill. It rewards experienced players who manage well their hand of cards and use them in the appropriate way and at the right time. However, the game can be also thoroughly enjoyed as a party game with a strong take-that component in which negotiation and bluffing skills may compensate the lack of experience playing the tactics cards.<br/><br/>Overview<br/>In Kill the Bill, players are members of a high profile Committee in the U.S. Congress who try to pass legislation benefiting both their political party and their own secret individual agenda. Each year 3 bills are discussed and voted by the Committee. The goal of the game is to become the most popular politician by the end of the fourth year (round) so to become the front-runner in the next presidential campaign. <br/>Players obtain points by passing bills which are favorable to the interest of their party (party scoring track), or favorable to their individual agenda (agenda scoring track). Moreover players get (and lose) popularity points throughout the game as effect of the political tactics cards played. Skillful persuasion and negotiation are important to success. However, in politics things are never straightforward. A wide range of political tactics (cards) are available to players who can unexpectedly turn decisive votes in their favor. Building alliances across the party lines, having a long-term strategy in mind and showing tactical flexibility are important in &quot;Kill the Bill&quot; too. Players must be ready for blackmail, bribery, deception and treason. Sometimes the end justifies the means.<br/><br/>Turn order<br/>Each round consist of 4 phases:<br/>1-Preparation (new tactics cards are dealt -draft in the first year, Committee Chair is selected and bills presented)<br/>2-Logrolling (negotiation) phase: players try to persuade each other to support or oppose certain bills<br/>3-Political tactics phase: tactics cards are played<br/>4-Voting phase: bills are voted and scoring tracks adjusted.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "4", "boardgameversion": ["First edition"], "age": "12", "name": "Kill the Bill", "playingtime": "60", "boardgamemechanic": ["Card Drafting", "Co-operative Play", "Hand Management", "Take That", "Voting"], "average": "0", "usersrated": "0", "boardgamefamily": ["Admin: Unreleased Games"]}, "207368": {"rpgartist": ["(Uncredited)"], "rpgitemversion": ["HTML Version"], "poll": [], "name": "Flip: Disgustingly Simple Live-Action Role-Playing", "rpgdesigner": ["Daniel Bayn"], "rpgproducer": ["Daniel Bayn"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3149056.jpg", "usersrated": "0", "average": "0", "statistics": [], "rpg": ["Flip: Disgustingly Simple Live-Action Role-Playing"], "rpgpublisher": ["(Web published)"], "rpgcategory": ["Core Rules (min needed to play)"], "rpggenre": ["Generic / Universal"], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3149056_t.jpg", "description": "From the introduction:<br/><br/>Characters are defined by their Traits, which can be skills (hacking, fortune telling), professions (investigator, assassin), or simple adjectives (clever, strong, vicious).

Each turn, you draw a product card, on which a product type and value is written. No matter if you want the card or not, you must offer it to one opponent, disclosing either type or value of the product. You may not tell a lie in the disclosure, but there is some room for the opponent to deduce the untold part, and that's where you may confuse the opponent. The opponent takes the product if your offer is accepted, otherwise it is yours.<br/><br/>When you are offered a product by an opponent, you may not always accept or refuse the offer. When you have already used up your refuse attempt, you have to accept the next offer to regain a refuse attempt, and vice versa.<br/><br/>You score victory points according to the products you have collected, but because of tricky scoring rules, you sometimes don't want a certain kind of cards.

Digital game timer made especially for go and able to handle advanced time modes such as byoyomi time, Canadian Style, Fischer time, etc. Evidently, also usable as an advanced chess clock as well as for Shogi and Xianqi.<br/><br/>Advanced models are able to count down the remaining time (1 min, 30 secs, 10, 9, 8, etc.) verbally in several languages, thereby allowing the players to keep their focus on the board with no need for looking at the clock during play.<br/><br/>Thus, what makes this kind of game timer different from a standard chess clock is the ability to handle the very different time keeping used in go compared to chess. In chess, typically one period of time is allocated to each player - e.g. 1 or 2 hours for the whole game or for the first 40 moves, or - in blitz - 5 min for each player for the whole game. In go many more moves are made during a game. Therefore, typically each player are given a small initial amount of time (eg. 10 min) after which the time keeping changes such that a certain number of moves must be made within a certain time limit (e.g. 10 min to 25 moves) after which a new time period is allocated. This pattern then repeats over and over again. Thus, in chess the players typically only get close to the time limit once in the game whereas in go the players are getting close to the time limit again and again. In a typical go game most of the game will be played during the byoyomi time with numerous count downs as the time limit will be met over and over again. A go clock is as initially described able to handles this more advanced time keeping with multiple count downs. Importantly, as mentioned above, the more advanced models counts down verbally (in English, Japanese, Chinese or Korean) mimicking tournament time keeping with a human time keeper, allowing the players to keep their eyes at the board instead of the clock.<br/><br/>", "usersrated": "1", "boardgameaccessory": ["Go"], "boardgamepublisher": ["(Unknown)"], "poll": [], "average": "9", "name": "Go: Clock"}, "207389": {"poll": [], "name": "MotorHEAT", "videogamemode": ["Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["Windows Downloadable edition"], "average": "0", "videogametheme": ["Driving"], "usersrated": "0", "videogamedeveloper": ["Milkstone Studios"], "videogamegenre": ["Racing"], "videogameplatform": ["Windows"], "videogamehonor": ["2010 AzPlay Awards Most Re-Playable Game Winner"], "statistics": [], "videogamepublisher": ["Milkstone Studios"], "description": "You&rsquo;ve got the ultimate racing car, and an unlimited road to drive on.

The game begins on 5 October 1944 with the 2nd Ukrainian Front and the 4th Ukrainian Front launching an offensive to isolate the German 8th Army which is still defending an area off-map to the East in the Carpathian Mountains.<br/><br/>Hungarian Rhapsody allows players to play the two  major Soviet offensives and several smaller scenarios covering the German counter offensives.<br/><br/>Hungarian Rhapsody is the next game in the award winning Operational Combat System. Players control units ranging from battalions through divisions, making key decisions on the use, objectives, and means of war. The series is based on modern concepts of maneuver warfare and allows players a far more insightful look into how campaigns (large and small) really work.<br/><br/>Game Scale:<br/>Game Turn: Half Week<br/>Hex: 5 miles / 8 Km<br/>Units: Battalion to Division<br/><br/>"}, "207399": {"poll": [], "name": "Barabariball", "videogamemode": ["Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["Windows Downloadable edition"], "average": "0", "videogametheme": ["Sports - Other"], "usersrated": "0", "videogamedeveloper": ["(Self-Developed Video Game)"], "videogamegenre": ["Sports"], "videogameplatform": ["Windows"], "videogamehonor": ["2012 AzPlay Awards Best Game Design Winner"], "statistics": [], "videogamepublisher": ["(Self-Published)"], "description": "BaraBariBall is a competitive sports game.<br/><br/>Source: The Game Website.<br/><br/>"}, "207400": {"poll": [], "name": "Hikaru", "videogamemode": ["Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["Android edition"], "average": "0", "videogametheme": ["Puzzle"], "usersrated": "0", "videogamedeveloper": ["Totxa Games"], "videogamegenre": ["Puzzle"], "videogameplatform": ["Android"], "videogamehonor": ["2012 AzPlay Awards Best Basque Game Winner"], "statistics": [], "videogamepublisher": ["Totxa Games"], "description": "Features<br/><br/>- 48 levels in easy and normal mode.

ELECTION! is a game of trivia, teamwork, &amp; campaign strategy. Players compete to be the first party to claim the most electoral votes in an American Presidential election campaign. Players lead their party&rsquo;s campaign for president by raising funds and purchasing Town Hall, Advertise, and Charisma cards to earn votes. Then with votes in hand, they strategically claim State's electoral votes and ensure their party's victory. Game Play:<br/><br/>Each turn involves three actions.<br/>1 Roll dice<br/>2 Buy Cards<br/>3 Claim States<br/>ACTION 1: Players can choose to roll the dice to raise funds. ACTION 2: They can opt to buy cards to build their campaign and earn popular votes. For example, buy a Town Hall trivia card to test your knowledge of history, State Capitals, State nicknames, and more. A correct response earns the votes. ACTION 3: With popular votes in hand, the players use them to win selected States on the score ballot.<br/><br/>Players may also &quot;endorse&quot; a teammate after their three actions. This is done by forwarding cards to a teammate's hand, pooling cards and votes to claim more States during their turn. Can the party now claim enough electoral votes to win the election?<br/><br/>Game progress is kept on the score ballot. The score ballot lists all 50 states and DC, and is sorted based on presidential election results from 1988 through 2008. There are states that lean red, states that lean blue, and swing states in the middle. States that lean toward the player's political party require fewer popular votes to claim. The swing states are equal for each party, and are more difficult for both. By claiming states with earned votes, players win electoral votes for their party and work toward victory. The electoral votes listed are current for the 2012, 2016, and 2020 presidential elections.<br/><br/>"}, "207408": {"poll": [], "name": "Inaris: The Cloud Temple", "videogamemode": ["Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["Windows Downloadable edition"], "average": "0", "videogametheme": ["Puzzle"], "usersrated": "0", "videogamedeveloper": ["DigiPen Institute of Technology"], "videogamegenre": ["Puzzle"], "videogameplatform": ["Windows"], "videogamehonor": ["2014 AzPlay Awards Best Basque Game Nominee"], "statistics": [], "videogamepublisher": ["DigiPen Institute of Technology"], "description": "Inaris is a tale of discovery about a lonely soul wandering in a set of empty familiar temples.

Each character has a specific combination of skills, represented by colorful icons, that can be used to defeat monsters along the way; stars represent physical might, while books stand for lore and hearts embody social skills. As the right combination of skill icons is required to defeat monsters and eventually dethrone the main villain of the piece. By doing this, children not only see that they differ from the other players, they even need to make good use of the other players' strengths &mdash; and help them cope with their weaknesses &mdash; to succeed.<br/><br/>Players start off in the idyllic medieval kingdom, where they'll confront weaker monsters drawn randomly from a stack of encounters while also traveling from one location to the next. When they feel up to it, certain locations give them access to the evil Shadowrealm, where stronger monsters roam but ancient, powerful magics can also be discovered.

As a mansion owner, you've come to the Freak Shop to stock your mansion with the horrors that will guarantee that your visitors have a most unforgettable stay!<br/><br/>Freak Shop is a short and simple tactical card game for 2 to 5 players that relies on a tricky trade mechanism. All cards in the game represent the frightening things, with values going from 1 to 10, that any real good freaky mansion owner must have in their collection. Players begin with four cards in their mansion (personal area), and cards are available in the Freak Shop (common zone at the center of the table). Each player's aim is to have their mansion worth the most fear points when the Freak Shop closes, with points coming from a combination of three randomly chosen objectives. To achieve this, they try to make the best trades between cards currently in their mansion and cards available in the Shop so that their collection grows in both quantity and value, while also best fitting the objectives.<br/><br/>On your turn, you make one single trade between cards currently in your mansion and cards available in the Shop. To do that, you have the choice between two options:<br/><br/><br/>     Sell at the fair price =&gt; Trade any number of cards totaling a given value for any number of cards worth exactly the same total value. <br/>     Get a good deal =&gt;  Exchange a series of cards of one single value with a series of the same number of cards of another single value.<br/><br/><br/>Throughout a game of Freak Shop, you try to take the best trade opportunities each turn to first make your mansion grow, then ensure that you can end with the collection worth the most points. Good deals help to get higher value cards, and fair price trades help to get more cards in your mansion. As everything is about trades, a central strategic point is to determine which cards are better used for optimizing new trades instead of being kept for scoring!<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": ["English/French first edition"], "name": "Freak Shop", "playingtime": "30", "boardgamemechanic": ["Set Collection", "Trading"], "average": "6.71106", "boardgameexpansion": ["213960"], "usersrated": "85", "age": "8"}, "207488": {"poll": [], "name": "Brain it on", "videogamemode": ["Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["Android release", "iOS release"], "average": "0", "videogametheme": ["Abstract"], "usersrated": "0", "videogamedeveloper": ["Orbital Nine"], "videogamegenre": ["Puzzle"], "videogameplatform": ["Android", "iPad", "iPhone"], "statistics": [], "videogamepublisher": ["Orbital Nine"], "description": "User summary<br/><br/>A &quot;draw on the screen&quot; physical puzzle, slightly similar to &quot;Crayon Physics&quot;.<br/><br/>The player is presented with a problem, like &quot;get the ball to tought the right wall), and can draw lines on the screen to achieve this.
