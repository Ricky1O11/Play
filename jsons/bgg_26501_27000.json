When a player takes the trick, he is allowed to cast a spell to manipulate the rules governing the rest of the round (when possible). The further the game progresses, the more spells become available.<br/><br/>The game is played from a unique deck of 84 cards ordered by three characteristics: rank, set, and suit. The rank corresponds with the card's spell level. As players increase their score and achieve new levels, more spells open up to them.<br/><br/>At the start of each round, players split the 13 cards dealt to them into a wand of 10 cards and a bag of 3 cards. The wand determines which cards are played during the round, while the bag is a selection of pre-determined spells to cast during the round. Spells are only cast by a player taking the trick.<br/><br/>Zards is unique to other trick-taking games:<br/>    * Zards is adjustable to play 3 to 6 players without the need to add or remove cards from the deck.<br/>    * By not dealing out the entire deck, the ability to accurately count cards is reduced, providing more comfort for novices playing against experts.<br/>    * Players can manipulate the rules for the round with a selection of over 20 spells.<br/>    * Each round allows the player in last place the advantage of playing first. Though, maintaining the lead depends on how cards are played and spells are cast.<br/><br/>"}, "26625": {"boardgamedesigner": ["(Uncredited)"], "poll": [], "name": "Colony Ten", "playingtime": "30", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": ["Card Drafting", "Trick-taking"], "yearpublished": "0", "usersrated": "0", "maxplayers": "6", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic162738_t.jpg", "average": "0", "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["Ace Power Trumps"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic162738.jpg", "boardgameversion": ["ACE edition"], "maxplaytime": "30", "boardgamecategory": ["Science Fiction"], "age": "12", "minplaytime": "30", "description": "A very simple trick taking trump card game with attractive card art.

The British did not think the Iraqis would counterattack. On May 22, in the early morning, the Iraqi 6th Brigade\\3rd Division (800 men) with CV33 tankettes attacked. Iraqi artillery pulverized the two British companies holding the town in their trenches surrounding it. They were forced to pull back into the town. The three Iraqi battalions with tanks were as good as the British by accounts in combat but for one thing: steady morale. From 3 a.m. to 10 a.m., the two British companies held but were nearing their end in this urban type combat. Luckily, the Luftwaffe had failed to support this attack (although they did the following day!). At 10 a.m., the tables began to turn when two additional British companies arrived.

The rules were designed specifically to accommodate the many large-scale engagements of this important war - from a few divisions to several corps per side.  The intention was to enable gamers to recreate very large battles without getting bogged down in extraneous details more appropriate for regimental-size skirmishes -- indeed, the normal command per player in most games is a corps or two: two to six infantry divisions.  Extensive morale and fire modifiers, multiple movement and fire opportunities, and national or troop type nuances have therefore been kept to a minimum in the interest of finishing a reasonably faithful approximation of a large historical battle in an afternoon.  A half-scale variant of the basic rules enabled smaller engagements to be fought simply by doubling the number of stands per unit in 1870.<br/><br/>Besides the rules, 80 percent of the booklet is devoted to detailed historical notes, background information, orders of battle, and an extensive annotated bibliography which provide ample reference material for custom designing additional campaigns or battles <br/>Fourteen exhaustively-researched historical battle scenarios are included in the book; these cover both the Imperial and Republican phases of the war. Enabling gamers to accurately recreate the wars' most interesting battles. Each scenario also includes &quot;what if&quot; variants positing historically plausible alternative missions or forces.<br/><br/>The book is extensively illustrated in color throughout, and contain ample diagrams and examples of play, formation diagrams, and game board photographs to help the gamer understanding the nuances of formations, maneuvers, and tactics, as well as visually differentiating the three different playing scales available.<br/><br/>Later expanded by 1859. This book consists of two parts: &quot;1859&quot; and &quot;1864&quot;.<br/>&quot;1859&quot; depicts the Second Italian War of Independence between Austria and France/Sardinia. Same scale as &quot;1870&quot;, though the 'Double Scale' in 1870 is renamed 'Half Scale' here. 7 scenarios.<br/>&quot;1864&quot; depicts the Second Schleswig War between Denmark and Austria/Prussia.

It was a runner-up for the Changing Landscapes design competition sponsored by Mesomorph Games.<br/><br/>IceFloe uses a piecepack set, piecepack pyramids, and a candle (or another easily accessible incendiary device) for its components.  The game board consists of piecepack tiles that are placed suit-side up; each representing an ice floe.  One player is selected to be the torch bearer and is given the candle.  Game play is broken up into phases.  During the movement phase, starting with the torch bearer, players take turns either moving a game board tile, or moving one of their own pyramids.

Keep in mind that horses of this period were too small to &quot;ride&quot; with a man on their back in a &quot;cavalry&quot; way. Only chariots offered a battle platform faster than sandals, and provided the &quot;shock troops&quot; of their day and a platform to designate the aristocracy and elite peoples. Alexander and the Roman legions might sneeze at chariot power... but not for another 900 years!<br/><br/>Kadesh must be the chariot battle of all time. Sources conflict and disagree, but there may have been as many as 5000 chariots in this twisted, confused, and bloody battle, fought to determine the borders between Egypt and the Hittite confederacy...<br/><br/>As an early example of &quot;spin,&quot; Egyptian pharaoh Ramses II claimed a tremendous victory and the total vanquishing of the Hittite army... although he also signed a peace treaty that left the disputed city of Kadesh in the hands of the Hittites and never returned. Hmm. (A later and more formal treaty between Ramses and the next Hittite king is reproduced on the walls of the United Nations, as one of the first recorded international peace treaties. Ramses did not get Kadesh with that one either.)<br/><br/>Now you can take the reins and lead your lines/lions into battle. Day of the Chariot: Kadesh offers a classic design by Gene Dickens fully updated into a tactical view of one of the most-discussed battles of middle eastern history, with 320 double-sided counters, 30 minute turns, and everything you need to play a system emphasizing command control and flexibility (or the lack thereof). Three distinct scenarios provide the battle that did happen (according to Ramses), the battle that both sides had &quot;prearranged&quot; to happen, and the smaller, more confused battle that historians think actually did happen.

The new game covers the same time period as the older ones (summer of 1941 to the spring of 1942) but uses a completely new Soviet OB, a new map, and the latest rules for the Europa system.<br/><br/>Total War gives the Axis player the opportunity to see if he can improve on the massive offensive that pocketed and captured millions of Soviet soldiers. Can you take Moscow or Leningrad? Or are you condemned to suffer the Soviet winter short of victory? The Soviet player must build a strategic reserve large enough to stop the advancing Axis forces and throw them out of Russia. The Soviet player is aided by massive reinforcements that allow him to form new defensive lines in an attempt to slow down or stop the Axis armor thrusts.<br/><br/>Total War is a historical game on the German invasion of the Soviet Union, from summer 1941 to spring 1942. It charts the titanic struggle of the largest ground campaign in World War II, from the Axis offensives that brought the Germans to the gates of Moscow to the Soviet winter counteroffensive that hurled them back.<br/><br/>Total War is a two-player game. One side controls the forces of Germany and its allies while the other controls the forces of the Soviet Union. The maps cover Eastern Europe and the western USSR from the Arctic Ocean to the Black Sea, from the plains of Poland to the steppes along the Volga River. Ground units represent corps, divisions, brigades, regiments, and battalions. Air units represent groups of 40 to 120 aircraft. Naval units represent task forces of warships.<br/><br/>Total War is a complete remake and updating of the classic Europa game, Fire in the East. The game&rsquo;s Soviet order of battle makes extensive use of formerly secret Kremlin information on the Red Army forces that fought the war. The game includes a Soviet order of battle for all of the USSR from 1939 to 1942 and is the more comprehensive game OB ever published on the Red Army in peace and war. The Axis order of battle also is updated, reflecting new research since the publication of Fire in the East. The rules for Total War incorporate the latest rules for the Europa system, with on-demand air power, armor effects, combined arms, and much more, recreating both the German blitzkrieg that captured entire Soviet armies and the Soviet deep operations that nearly splintered the invaders in the depth of the Russian winter.&quot;<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "name": "Total War", "playingtime": "6000", "boardgamemechanic": ["Dice Rolling", "Hex-and-Counter", "Simulation"], "average": "3.3", "usersrated": "10", "boardgamesubdomain": ["Wargames"], "boardgamefamily": ["Admin: Unreleased Games", "Europa Series"]}, "26805": {"boardgamedesigner": ["Martin H.

Aircraft carriers (4 British and 1 French) can search the six adjacent hexes. The German player can search the hexes ships are in, plus the Graf Spee has two search aircraft that can search within four hexes. The German player can also search any other three hexes on the board (u-boat reports?).<br/><br/>Both players must keep track of fuel expenditures, and both have supply ships available to re-fuel (or they can re-fuel in ports). Every other turn the German player can roll on a table to sink one (or two) merchantmen. If he sinks any, he then rolls on another table to see how many turns later he must inform the British player in which hex the sinking occurred. The German player must sink a number of merchant ships and escape the map to win; otherwise the British player wins.<br/><br/>No indication is given of map or time scale.

Introducing MonkeyWinks! The popular indoor game that is easy to learn for kids, and formidable enough to appeal to adults wanting a special challenge.<br/><br/>Like its predecessor, MonkeyWinks is a game played with sets of small, thin discs (called winks) lying on a special felt mat. Players use a larger disc (called a squidger) to pop a smaller disc into flight by pressing down on one side of the smaller disc. The basic goal of an informal game (easily playable by young children) is to cause the smaller discs to land inside a pot or cup. The formal game has a more robust set of rules, goals, and strategies suitable to serious competition for adults and older children.<br/><br/>MonkeyWinks is interactive fun for all players, pros and beginners alike. However, MonkeyWinks is a lot more than just a flipping disc game. For example, the included &quot;Go Bananas&quot;&trade; cards incorporate random events and player changes inspired by everyday kids games. <br/><a target='_blank' href='http://www.monkeypoker1.com' rel='nofollow'>www.monkeypoker1.com</a><br/><br/>"}, "26857": {"boardgamedesigner": ["Wes Smith"], "poll": [], "name": "Monkey Poker", "playingtime": "0", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": ["Set Collection"], "yearpublished": "2006", "usersrated": "2", "boardgamefamily": ["Animals: Apes / Monkeys", "Poker"], "maxplayers": "6", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic192343_t.jpg", "average": "6.5", "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["Three Monkey Games"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic192343.jpg", "boardgameversion": ["Three Monkey First Edition"], "maxplaytime": "0", "boardgamecategory": ["Card Game", "Children's Game"], "age": "7", "minplaytime": "0", "description": "From Three Monkey Games website:www.monkeypoker1.com<br/><br/>Looking for a fun, new indoor game idea for children, and kids of all ages?

The jinxed canal, dug through the swamps in an attempt to bypass the city's guns. Now another plan is in motion. Grant will march his Army of the Tennessee through the Louisiana swamps, sneak his ships past the rebel fortress in a daring run of the gauntlet, conduct the largest amphibious invasion in U.S. history, separate himself from his supply base, wedge himself in between two rebel armies, and seize control of the city from the east!

Its game mechanism is borrowed from An Qi (literally dark chess, because pieces are covered at the start and so unknown to the players: it is a game played using Xiangqi pieces). Each side has a number of pieces ranking from President down to Hostages or Civilians, and also Bombs, Fighter Planes and Oil-fields. Like An Qi (and for that matter games like LuZhanJunQi and Stratego), the pieces have a ranked order and higher ranked pieces eliminate lower ranked ones. Pieces start face-down and are randomly distributed in alternate colors on the 6X6 square grid that is the game board. Players take turn to expose pieces and once exposed, pieces may be moved one space orthogonally. Enemy pieces are eliminated by a higher or equal ranked piece moving on to them. There are special rules for specific pieces - the Assassin may eliminate the President, Bombs neutralize (i.e. both pieces get eliminated) all other pieces, capturing an Oil-field/Hostages/Civilians piece allows substitution of your own piece for a previously eliminated piece, etc. The Fighter Plane has the capture of the Pao (Cannon) in An Qi - just like in Xiangqi, it jumps over another piece to land on a distal piece and capture it. <br/>The game is won by the player who is able to capture both the opposing President and Vice-president.<br/><br/>The game has interesting details - one player takes the Iraqi side and the other is the Allied side. The President, Vice-president and Ally pieces are different and have pictures appropriate to the side (Saddam, Bush, Gaddfi and Thatcher all feature). Another difference is that the Iraqis have a Civilians piece but the Allied forces has a Hostages piece instead (in the game, they are equivalent). The board comes with two sides - one side has yellow and blue circles to show where the pieces go. The other has the same 6X6 grid superimposed on a background map showing the Persian gulf.<br/><br/>"}, "26880": {"boardgamedesigner": ["(Uncredited)"], "poll": [], "name": "Bozo the Clown Circus Game", "playingtime": "0", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": ["Roll / Spin and Move"], "yearpublished": "1960", "usersrated": "0", "boardgamefamily": ["Characters: Bozo the Clown", "Circus"], "maxplayers": "4", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic200098_t.jpg", "average": "0", "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["Transogram"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic200098.jpg", "boardgameversion": ["First Edition"], "maxplaytime": "0", "boardgamecategory": ["Children's Game", "Movies / TV / Radio theme"], "age": "0", "minplaytime": "0", "description": "Spin and move children's game.

Preceding the Little Bighorn by a week, the outcome of this battle directly influenced what happened to Custer and the 7th US Cavalry.<br/> General George Crook was given command of the Southern column of the Bighorn Campaign.  With Gibbon's column coming in from the West and the Terry/Custer column from the Northeast, the campaign's objective was to trap the Sioux and Northern Cheyenne and forcibly return them back to their reservation.<br/> Tactically the battle was inconclusive.  Casualties on both sides were relatively low, and in the end Crook held the field.  But strategically the Rosebud fight was a great victory for the Sioux and Cheyenne.  Crook expended a huge amount of ammunition; most soldiers were down to 10 rounds or fewer each.  Many horses were killed, injured, or worn out. Because of these reasons Crook decided to withdraw his command back to his base camp, effectively taking his column out of the campaign.<br/> Had Crook been able to continue operations he could have linked up with Custer's column, adding his infantry and cavalry to the 7th Cavalry.

This game is played mostly in European countries like France, The Netherlands, Russia, Poland and Belgium and in African nations like Congo, Senegal and Ivory Coast. However, there are countries outside these two continents that boast of good players like in the United States, Italy, Israel and Brazil.<br/><br/>Rules of the Game: This game is played on a 10 x 10, or 100 squares checker board where the double corner is on the right of each player.<br/><br/>The Moves of the Men: Checkers pieces can move forward on each empty square to the left or to the right. When these pieces reach the last line on the opponent's side they become kings.<br/><br/>The Moves of the King: Kinged pieces can move across multiple squares on the two diagonals that cross their position for so long as these squares are open, in a rule known as the &quot;flying kings.&quot;<br/><br/>Captures: In International checkers, maximum captures are obligatory, which means that if a player has more than one path to jump to capture his opponent's pieces, he must take that path that will effect the most capture of his opponent's pieces. If a piece lands on the king row during a jump, it must continue jumping backward for as long as there is a jump opportunity. That particular piece cannot be kinged unless it finishes the move and stops on king row.<br/><br/>Captures by the Men: Men can effect capture by moving forward or backward and jumping over a single piece of the opponent provided that the said piece is adjacent to it and the following square is empty. If the man can jump again from the arrival square to effect another capture, then it must do so.<br/><br/>Captures by a King: A kinged piece can capture an opponent's piece if it is on the same diagonal where it is positioned provided that the squares between them are empty and that the square beyond the piece to be captured is also empty. The king can stop on any square within the same diagonal line and if another capture can be effected from any of these squares, then it must continue to do so.<br/><br/>The Winning Player: The player who cannot move any of his pieces loses the game.<br/><br/>Conditions for a Draw:<br/><br/>     By mutual agreement of the players.<br/>     Both players have played five moves, after a position arises of one king against two pieces, which includes a king.<br/>     Both players have played sixteen moves, after a position arises of one king against three pieces, which includes a king.<br/>     Both players have moved twenty five moves solely with kings and not a single piece was captured.<br/>     For the third time the same position arises with the same player at move.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Information from checkershistory.com<br/><br/>Online Play <br/><br/>    Boardspace.net (real time play against humans, or play against the computer)<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": ["Dommelsch Promotional Edition", "Game Crafter Compact budget edition", "Jumbo Dutch Edition 1978", "Nestor games edition", "Print and Play edition"], "average": "6.49663", "name": "International Checkers", "videogamebg": ["Maximus Draughts"], "playingtime": "40", "boardgamemechanic": ["Grid Movement"], "age": "5", "usersrated": "163", "boardgamesubdomain": ["Abstract Games"], "boardgamefamily": ["Checkers", "Combinatorial"]}, "26953": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic166835.jpg", "poll": [], "boardgamedesigner": ["David Hewitt"], "statistics": [], "yearpublished": "2001", "maxplayers": "8", "age": "3", "boardgamepublisher": ["Trendmasters"], "maxplaytime": "0", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic166835_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "0", "boardgamecategory": ["Card Game", "Children's Game", "Collectible Components", "Fighting", "Science Fiction"], "description": "Rumble Robots was a children's collectible card game sold in starter decks and booster packs circa 2001.

The island has fascinated travelers, mystics, and scientists for years as people have wondered how such a small, isolated area could have been home to a society that created the world's most spectacular outdoor museum. In the 1940s, Norwegian archeologist Thor Heyerdahl sailed the reed boat Kon-Tiki from South America to Easter Island to show that the technology available made it possible for Polynesia to be settled from the Americas. In the 1970s, Erich Van Daniken popularized the idea that the world was visited by ancient astronauts and the beautiful and enormous stone statutes, the Moai, of Easter Island were used as some of his &quot;evidence.&quot;<br/><br/>Today, scientists around the world generally agree that Easter Island was settled from other Polynesian islands to its west, and the extreme culture that produced hundreds of stone Moai is related to other cultures in the region. The history of the island is a history of constraint, and the carving of the Moai, the rapid deforestation of the island, and the limited food sources available all worked together to build an extreme culture that became the victim of its own consumption. In this way, Easter Island today represents more than just a wonderful place to travel, but also is a reminder of the greater resource limits of our entire planet. As populations continue to grow and we put further strains on sources of fuel and food, are we heading toward the same fate that this small island suffered hundreds of years ago? The island today is owned by Chile, and the small population thrives with a few weekly flights to mainland South America and the occasional cargo ship visit.<br/><br/>Moai is a game that closely follows the developments and excesses of the island until the arrival of Dutch Admiral Jacob Roggeveen, the first European to discover the island and name it for the day of his discovery. Combining many of the historical features of the island's culture in an exciting and well-playing strategic game, players can have fun reliving the dramatic history of this exciting little island.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": ["English edition", "French edition"], "average": "6.24346", "name": "Moai", "playingtime": "75", "boardgamemechanic": ["Auction/Bidding", "Card Drafting", "Worker Placement"], "age": "12", "usersrated": "220", "boardgamesubdomain": ["Strategy Games"], "boardgamefamily": ["Admin: Better Description Needed!", "Country: Chile", "Tropical theme"], "boardgamepodcastepisode": ["Episode 2 - Picking Over the Bones"]}, "26962": {"boardgamedesigner": ["(Uncredited)"], "poll": [], "name": "Monopoly: Reading", "playingtime": "60", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": ["Auction/Bidding", "Roll / Spin and Move", "Set Collection", "Stock Holding", "Trading"], "yearpublished": "2003", "usersrated": "4", "boardgamefamily": ["Monopoly"], "maxplayers": "6", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic166640_t.jpg", "average": "3.5", "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["Winning Moves UK Ltd."], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic166640.jpg", "boardgameversion": ["First edition"], "maxplaytime": "60", "boardgamecategory": ["Economic", "Negotiation"], "age": "8", "minplaytime": "60", "description": "An edition of the commercially successful board game, Monopoly.

The Emperor Claudius had dispatched Aulus Plautius and 45,000 men to conquer the mist-covered island where Julius Caesar had failed almost a century earlier.<br/> Over the next 40 years, Roman would clash with Celt in a series of battles that neither realized would determine the future of Western civilization.  The Romans broke the Britons, whose furious courage could not match Roman discipline. The island would pass under Roman rule for the next several centuries, implanting a Latin-oriented culture and shoving Celtic ways to the very fringes of Europe. All that would remain were their legends; not least among them the fiery leadership of Boudicca, warrior-queen of the Iceni and resolute enemy of Rome.<br/><br/>The Rome at War series covers Roman battles against both their neighbors and each other. The first game, Rome At War I: Hannibal at Bay, covered the last battles of Carthage&rsquo;s favorite son. The second, Rome at War II: Fading Legions, focused on the empire&rsquo;s latter years, when it was beset by barbarian invasion, an implacable rival, and civil war.<br/><br/>Rome at War: Queen of the Celts is the third installment in the series. Rome has outstanding heavy infantry, good light cavalry (provided by her allies) and even an elephant. The Britons depend on the fury of their Celtic charge, and also chariots and slingers.

Players link Species cards with other Species cards and battle other players in &ldquo;Turf Wars&rdquo; in order to collect &ldquo;Eco-points&rdquo; before one of the player&rsquo;s decks runs out of cards. In addition, &ldquo;Boost&rdquo; cards aid the players in Turf Wars, and &quot;X\u0113ko&quot; cards may help or hurt players in acquiring additional Eco-points by permitting changes to the standard game rules.

The period ends when all cards in the deck have been used, and the deck is then reshuffled for the next period.<br/><br/>During a period the attacker uses his attack maneuvers &ndash; Pass, Dribble or Shot &ndash; to try to score a goal. The defender uses his defense maneuvers &ndash; Block, Tackle or Interception &ndash; to try to prevent a goal. If the attacker scores a goal or the defender intercepts the ball, the roles are reversed and the game continues.<br/><br/>In addition to the regular attack and defense maneuvers, the players can use special maneuvers to score a lucky shot or intercept the ball using the goalie. It's also possible to foul by making illegal maneuvers, but beware &ndash; you don't want the referee to see you.<br/><br/>Forceball consists of 56 cards and is a complete game in itself, not a trading card game.

This game has three levels of play for harvesting your crops:<br/><br/><br/>     The first level is for kids ages 3-5.  It consists of rolling a red die (values 1-3) and moving the number of spaces indicated by the die roll.  If you land on a type of produce, you get a matching card for it.  If they land on a school bus or playground, they get nothing.  The first player to reach the end stops the game.  All players count their cards and the one with the most wins.<br/>     The second level is for kids ages 5-7.  Again, you roll the red die to move, but instead of collecting produce cards when you land on a produce space, you roll a white die (values 1-6) and match it with a produce rate card to see how much money you sold that produce for.  You then get it in play money.  The first player to reach the end stops game play and all count their money.  The one with the most money wins.<br/>     The third level is for kids ages 7-9.  This combines the aspects of levels 1 and 2 and adds additional complexity.  When you land on a produce space, you get the matching produce card.  You can then roll the white die to sell the produce, or keep the card.  If you keep it, the next time you land on that produce space, you get another card.  You then have two of a kind.  If you want to sell them, roll the white die, consult the rate chart, and sell all of your cards of that produce.  The one who makes it to the end, stops the gameplay and the one who has the most money wins.  You can also trade cards with other players before the red move die is rolled.<br/><br/><br/>This game has a colorful board and easy-to-read rate charts and money.<br/>Even parents can find amusement with this game.<br/><br/>Re-implements:<br/><br/>    The Farming Game<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": ["First Edition"], "name": "The Farming Game Kids", "playingtime": "30", "boardgamemechanic": ["Roll / Spin and Move", "Simulation"], "average": "4.70588", "usersrated": "17", "boardgamesubdomain": ["Children's Games"], "age": "3"}, "26606": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic345746.jpg", "poll": [], "boardgamedesigner": ["Richard H.

To play Barbarian, you will need the game SPQR for maps, basic rules, and some counters. Barbarian can also be played with the Simple Great Battles of History Rules.<br/><br/>As Rome strove to conquer the Italian peninsula in the Fourth and Third Centuries BCE, her most formidable opponents were not the advanced Etruscans, nor the crafty Greeks. Instead, it was the barbarian tribes that nearly overcame Rome: the savage warriors of Cisalpine Gaul and the fierce hill tribe fighters of Samnium.<br/><br/>The nimble mountain warriors of Samnium taught the Romans the advantages of a more flexible formation over the ponderous phalanx. After suffering a sharp reverse at Lautulae, 315, the Romans recovered and dealt a counterstroke at Tifernum, 297 in two battles representative of the many fierce fights between these implacable foes. The political genius of the Samnite general Gellius Aegnatius welded former foes Samnium, Etruria, Umbria and the Gauls into a grand coalition that nearly broke the power of Republican Rome at Sentinum, 295. This battle, more than any other, decided the fate of Italy.<br/><br/>Even as the Samnites and their peninsular allies were subdued, the Gauls arose to carry on the struggle. Calling on reinforcements from across the Alps, the Gauls invaded Italy in 225 and only by a stroke of fortune was this army trapped between two Roman consular armies at Telamon. The battle that followed was one of the most unusual in all of military history, with the Gauls fighting in desperation in two opposite directions, as Roman armies closed in from north and south. Finally, just after Rome had withstood Hannibal&rsquo;s devastating invasion, Hamilcar, a die-hard Carthaginian officer, raised the Gallic tribes for one last great battle at Cremona, 200. In the end, Rome emerged victorious and dominated the Italian peninsula from the straits of Messina to the Alps.<br/><br/>The Battles:<br/><br/>    LAUTULAE, 315.

It's that simple.  or is it?  When it's your turn, lay down cards in  your hand that make sets (3 or more of the same value) or runs (3 in a row of the same color) or play cards on another player's piles to get rid of your cards faster.  For those who really like to explore all their possibilities, transport cards from other piles to combine with new cards, and make new piles.  Just remember, each pile must always have at least three cards.  The possibilities are out of this world!<br/><br/>The Action Cards make INFINITY even more fun.  Give every one of your opponents three extra cards when you play the Re-Fuel card.  Get new cards to replace the ones in your hand with the Re-Entry Card.  Or play the Countdown Card to force someone to make a play and gain control of the board.  Don't wait for your turn, either, play any of these any time you want!<br/><br/>"}}
