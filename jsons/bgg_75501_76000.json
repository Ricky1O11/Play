While ostensibly very similar to Breakout, the layout, sound, and general behavior of the game is identical. Super Breakout is a microprocessor based game instead of discrete logic, programmed by Asteroids programmer Ed Logg  using an early M6502 chip. Super Breakout can therefore be emulated in MAME  and is also featured in a number of different Atari compilation packs. The original Breakout has not been featured, since there is no processor in Breakout, the game would have been more &quot;simulated&quot; than emulated.<br/><br/>In Super Breakout, there are three different and more advanced game types from which the player can choose:<br/><br/>* Double gives the player control of two bats at the same time, one placed above the other, and two balls. Losing a life occurs only when both balls go out of play, and points are doubled while the player is able to juggle both balls without losing either.<br/>    * Cavity retains the single bat and ball of Breakout, but two other balls are enclosed on the other side of the wall, which the player must free before they, too, can be used to destroy additional bricks. Points are increased for this, but triple points are available if the player can keep all three balls in play.<br/>    * Progressive also has the single bat and ball, but as the ball hits the paddle, the entire wall gradually advances downwards step by step, gaining in speed the longer the ball lasts in play.<br/><br/>"}, "75803": {"videogame": ["Arcade's Greatest Hits: The Atari Collection 2", "Atari Anniversary Edition", "Atari Anthology", "Atari: 80 Classic Games in One"], "poll": [], "name": "Crystal Castles", "videogamemode": ["Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["Amstrad Release", "Android (Atari Greatest Hits Arcade Emulation) edition", "Android (Atari Greatest Hits Atari 2600 Emulation) edition", "Apple II Release", "Arcade", "Atari 2600 Release", "Atari 8 Bit Release", "Atari ST Release", "BBC Micro Release", "Commodore 64 Release", "ZX Spectrum Release"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic784068.jpg", "videogametheme": ["Cute Fantasy"], "usersrated": "22", "videogamedeveloper": ["Atari, Inc.", "Code Mystics"], "videogamegenre": ["Arcade", "Puzzle"], "videogameplatform": ["Amstrad CPC", "Android", "Apple II", "Arcade", "Atari 2600", "Atari 8-bit family", "Atari ST", "BBC Micro", "Commodore 64", "ZX Spectrum"], "average": "5.77273", "statistics": [], "videogamepublisher": ["Atari, Inc."], "videogamecompilation": ["Arcade's Greatest Hits: The Atari Collection 2", "Atari Anniversary Edition", "Atari Anthology", "Atari Flashback Classics: Volume 1", "Atari Vault", "Atari: 80 Classic Games in One"], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic784068_t.jpg", "description": "From Wikipedia<br/><br/>Crystal Castles is an arcade game released by Atari, Inc in 1983.

Almost without warning, the Fall of Man came to pass and Man ended his dominion of the Earth with a whimper. Continents were erased, new seas formed, and only a very unlucky few survived the apocalypse. The angle and orbit of the planet had changed, and the only habitable areas remaining on Earth are between the 30th and 45th parallel. As the Earth slowly dies, burning under a closer Sol, the remaining inhabitants struggle to survive.<br/><br/>70 years have passed since the Fall, and what was once the western seaboard of the United States is the last bastion of humanity on the planet.  New settlements have grown over the ashes of the old, the largest being the Free Republic of Phoenix. Phoenix has grown and prospered, its guarded, high walls protecting it from the hazards of the open wastes. Phoenix is the center of the world now, having formed political alliances with many of the remaining settlements, providing electricity and protection in the form of its Centurions in return for manpower, goods, and food.  Ruled by an elected dictator, its laws are strong and absconders are dealt with harshly, but life in the wastes is harsher. Providing tens of thousands a stable life, Phoenix truly is the last hope for civilization, but not everyone wants civilization.<br/><br/>The Anarchists, as the Phoenicians call them, are made up of freedom loving people that will bow to no man&rsquo;s law but their own. Cut off from the much-needed electricity and fresh water produced in Phoenix, they scavenge the lands as their ancestors did, killing anyone that they encounter to survive.  In a perpetual state of conflict with Phoenix and their merciless Centurion warriors, and led by their High Priest or Mor, they will stop at nothing until Phoenix falls and the Free Cities are allowed to be truly Free.<br/><br/>Your adventure begins with the high council of your small, Northwestern village calling you, one of its strongest, bravest citizens to the village hall.  The council tells its chosen ones that the city generator has begun to fail and that you must find and recover a suitable replacement within 30 days or your people will perish and your village with fall to the wastes. Not knowing where to begin and provisioned only with what your village could spare, you set off into the wastes.<br/><br/><br/>Beyond The Fall is a post-apocalyptic game of survival where players must make their way south to Phoenix before running out of food or being killed by Anarchists, starvation, or the wasteland itself.  Along your way you will come upon settlements where you may barter or desperate men who may try to kill you.  The wastes are an inhospitable place for the weak, and only your strength, courage, and your choices will carry you through safely.<br/>You may undertake missions which will reap glory and rewards, may perform acts of courage that will craft your story into legend, or you may take up the cause of the Anarchists who wish to defile and rape the lands for their own benefit.

An RPG, or role playing game, is a type of game where the players take command of simulated characters in a shared imaginative environment. There are many different kinds of RPGs; there are so many different games, that some consider classifying them all under the same title to be somewhat of a stretch.<br/><br/>In the imaginative world of Monster Trainer, there are a wide variety of mystical beasts, both wild and tamed. Someone has to tame the beasts, of course, which is where the players come in: each player has their own Moster Trainer to control. Players travel around and attempt to capture and train Monsters. When their beasts are ready, the players can seek other Trainers to challenge; each time you defeat the beasts of another Trainer, you can a higher ranking as a Monster Trainer. The goal of the game is to be the first player to gain the rank of Champion Trainer.<br/><br/>Resolutions in the game are made by rolling dice. With a very few exceptions, all rolls are made with one or more six-sided dice (these are the cube-shaped ones that come with most board games). When rolling the six-sided dice, you will most often be making a Normal Challenge. In a Normal Conflict, you roll the appropriate number of dice (indicated by a number followed by a letter 'd' such as '6d' for six dice), and count how many rolled 4 or more. You will oftentimes compare this roll with another roll, with the roll with more successes (rolls of 4 or more) being the 'winner'. The other rolls will be Special Rolls, which will have special rules unique to them, and may require specialty sized dice; note that if you don't have the special dice, you can use a number of playing cards equal to their number just as easily.<br/><br/>"}, "75820": {"rpgartist": ["(Uncredited)"], "rpgitemversion": ["PDF Version"], "poll": [], "name": "Rob Bot and his Robotic Buds", "rpgdesigner": ["Philip Reed"], "rpgproducer": ["Philip Reed"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic765408.jpg", "usersrated": "0", "average": "0", "statistics": [], "rpggenre": ["Action / Adventure", "Animation / Comics", "Science Fiction (Space Opera)"], "rpgpublisher": ["(Web published)", "Ronin Arts"], "rpg": ["Rob Bot and His Robotic Buds"], "rpgcategory": ["Core Rules (min needed to play)"], "rpgseries": ["24 Hour RPG 2004"], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic765408_t.jpg", "description": "From the Game's Introduction:<br/><br/>The intergalactic hero Rob Bot, along with his robotic buddies Zero Zero and Blinx Bot, has saved the universe countless times in the popular Rob Bot and His Robotic Buds animated series.

A glorious city, founded on the tripartite pillars of sorcery, science, and philosophical enlightenment. Unmatched in power, unrivaled in beauty, and unsurpassed in knowledge, it is the center of the ancient world's culture and politics, and it's dying. Within six months, a magical conflagration of unknown origin will consume the city, sinking the very earth on which it rests into the sea.<br/><br/>No external enemy could accomplish this atrocity, though there are many with the motive to try. No random natural disaster could sink the island nation, its sorcerous protections are too complete. Atlantis's doom came from within. It could have been an accident, a malfunction in the city's life support spells, or a sorcerer's duel that grew out of control. It could have been an act of malice, the handiwork of a psychopathic enchanter. It could have been civil war, the natural consequence of open conflict between thousands of magically active individuals. It's impossible to say. No records remain, and the disaster left no survivors. Only one thing is certain. The end was inevitable.<br/><br/>For all its knowledge and power, Atlantis carried the seeds of its own destruction. Native Atlanteans focused on scholarship and magical power, disdaining the simple physical labor necessary to sustain even the most wondrous civilization. To fill the need, Atlantis resorted to slavery, using their powerful weapons to intimidate their neighbors into paying human tribute.<br/><br/>Its once-proud government, the Council of Atlantis, has degenerated from a model democracy into a group of petty, squabbling oligarches, concerned only with their own power and privileges. In the city's final months, council sessions are dominated by personal vendettas, its members using the law as a weapon in their own petty feuds, rather than as a tool to improve the lives of Atlantis's citizens.<br/><br/>The city's scientific and magical research, once tempered with wisdom and kindness, loses all perspective and restraint. Scientists create new and destructive technologies with no regard for how they'll be used. Sorcerers conduct foul experiments on unwilling people, justifying their excesses in the name of knowledge. The explosion that destroyed the city was nothing. In the final months, weapons are created that can shatter continents and boil oceans.<br/><br/>All these problems and more are what doomed Atlantis. The actual disaster was one of a thousand possible mishaps that could have destroyed the city. Even if it could have been prevented, something else would have eventually come along.<br/><br/>The Last Days of Atlantis chronicles these dark times, taking characters through the events leading up to the end. Players take on the role of one of the city's inhabitants, experiencing their lives in the weeks and months leading up to their untimely deaths. Perhaps they are the arrogant sorcerers who ultimately destroy Atlantis. Perhaps they are some of the few remaining uncorrupted civil servants, struggling valiantly to prevent the imminent disaster. Perhaps they're slaves, wanting nothing more than to escape the wretched place before it slides into the sea. Decadent and magical, Atlantis inspires as many stories in death as it did in life.<br/><br/>"}, "75824": {"boardgamedesigner": ["David Dobson"], "poll": [], "name": "Galapagos", "playingtime": "60", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": ["Hand Management"], "yearpublished": "2010", "usersrated": "0", "maxplayers": "4", "boardgamefamily": ["Animals: Turtles"], "average": "0", "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["The Game Crafter, LLC", "Plankton Games"], "boardgameversion": ["The Game Crafter edition"], "maxplaytime": "60", "boardgamecategory": ["Card Game"], "age": "0", "minplaytime": "60", "description": "Galapagos is a card-based strategy game where you lead a species in a struggle to survive.

These maps, like their locations, couldn&rsquo;t be more different. Rainforest is all about fluctuating goods prices while Sahara is a mean, unforgiving map that adds a layer of strategy to Age of Steam and Steam games that&rsquo;s heavily focused on location.<br/><br/>Amazon Rainforest takes place deep in the Brazilian forests, where you&rsquo;re building railroads between the few small cities scattered about. Unlike most Steam/AoS maps, Amazon does not have towns...and there&rsquo;s no way to get them on the map. Fortunately, your income isn&rsquo;t tied to links. Unfortunately, it&rsquo;s tied to the &ldquo;wood market&rdquo; where each color cube represents a different kind of prized and scarce South American wood. The more wood that&rsquo;s delivered, the scarcer the supply, which drives up the price. The less wood on the board, the cheaper the wood. You&rsquo;ve got to find the rare stuff and deliver it before anyone else does. Due to the limited number of cities, the track network you build is critical. Amazon Rainforest is for 3-6 players.<br/><br/>Sahara Desert takes place on the northern portion of Africa. In possibly one of the harshest climates ever to build a railroad network, you won&rsquo;t survive without lots and lots of water. However, you can only get water from the oases throughout the desert, and once they dry up, they dry up for good. If you don&rsquo;t have access to water you can pay per delivery, or if you&rsquo;re really crafty, you&rsquo;ll choose the Water Import action and not worry about water for this turn. Regardless of how you do it, it&rsquo;s going to be tough, and there&rsquo;s going to be more moisture slowing coming down your face in the form of tears than anywhere else. Sahara Desert is for 3-5 players who won&rsquo;t acknowledge their limitations.<br/><br/>The 2010 Essen Aos/Steam map pack from Bezier Games features 7 new maps, including 6 mounted ones on 3 double size expansions.

One player begins as the Thing - all the other players start as human.<br/><br/>The game is primarily played out using six asymmetrical card decks - three decks for each side (each deck corresponds to a different section of the narrative). Managing your hand of cards, and when to use each deck, is key to winning the game.<br/><br/>The twelve members of the Outpost 31 team cards are positioned between the players, with each human player taking one character. The team then have to overcome various encounters, while trying to stay alive, in an effort to stop the Thing. Encounters are directly taken from film events, and are sorted into three separate acts - the second and third acts are shuffled, and then all three acts are placed together, forming one narrative (in this way, each game is a little different). Some example encounters: Autopsy of Norwegian-Thing, Battle in Dogtown, Explore Norwegian Base, Conduct Blood Test, and Investigate Crashed Saucer Site. In addition, the Outpost team must allocate men to tasks that may aid in their victory over the Thing. The truth being that the humans will not be able to achieve all that they want to do and will have to prioritise. All the while, the Thing player will do all in its power to thwart the human players, while attempting to construct its Blair-saucer in a secret ice cavern by cannibalising parts from the bulldozer, radio room, and helicopter.<br/><br/>During the game, at various stages, the Thing player has the opportunity to place infection or dummy infection cards under the human character cards. Later in the game, the Thing may even directly infect other players (unbeknownst to the remaining players), or give the impression to the others that it has! The humans must keep their wits about them if they are to fight and win against the Thing, or they may find themselves fighting each other....<br/><br/>Victory Conditions:<br/><br/>1. The Outpost #31 team win if they survive the final confrontation, having destroyed the camp and sabotaged the Thing's Blair-saucer - and have killed all the Things.<br/><br/>     If they are mistaken and some Things remain: the Things win.<br/>     If they killed a non-infected player: the Thing wins.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>2.

The game features &quot;Quick Hunt&quot;, which lets players jump right into the action by choosing equipment, a hunting tag and hunting the required animal. In &quot;Action Zone&quot;, you start off in a small portion of a map and a certain amount of a dangerous animal will appear. Once the animals are hunted by the player, a portal opens to the next round. &quot;Career Mode&quot;, allows players to create a profile and then customize their stats, age, and appearance. In all three modes there are penalties for non-game animals, which will result in failing. Terrain is another thing the player must pay attention to. Falling into deep streams or off of high ledges can result in an injury and failing the hunt. Aggressive animals such as bear, cape buffalo, and leopard will attack you, which too results in injury and failure. The player also has an energy limit. After a while of hunting, the player will become tired and need to slow down.

(SSI) in 1980. The game is based on the last battle of the battleship Bismarck, in which British Armed Forces pursue the German Bismarck in 1941. It is SSI's first game, and features turn-based gameplay and two-dimensional graphics.<br/><br/>The development staff consisted of two programmers, Joel Billings and John Lyons, who programmed the game in BASIC. Originally developed for the TRS-80, an Apple II version was also created two months into the process. After meeting with other wargame developers, Billings decided to publish the game as well. To help accomplish this, he hired Louis Saekow to create the box art.<br/><br/>Computer Bismarck is a turn-based computer wargame in which players control British forces against the battleship Bismarck and other German units. The German forces can be controlled by either a computer opponent (named &quot;Otto von Computer&quot;) or a second player. The game takes place on a map of the North Atlantic Ocean on which letters from the English alphabet represent military units and facilities (airfields and ports). Units have different capabilities, as well as statistics that determine their mobility, firepower, vulnerability and other gameplay factors. Turns take the form of phases, and players alternate inputting orders to maneuver their respective units. Phases can serve different functions, such as informing players of status changes, unit movement, and battles. Players earn points by destroying their opponent's units. After the Bismarck is sunk or a number of turns have occurred, the game ends. Depending on the number of points players have earned, either the British or German forces are declared the victor.<br/><br/>By John Lyon, Joel Billings &amp; Dave Cook<br/><br/>"}, "75861": {"rpgdesigner": ["C.

The game covers the division's part in the invasion and liberation of North Africa, the invasion into Sicily, the landing on Omaha Beach in Europe and moving east, eventually crossing the Siegfried Line into Germany.

While the messari targeted Meridian, Echo City was only marginally affected by the strike. While Meridian&rsquo;s destruction was swift and ultimately paved the way for its grand rebirth, Echo City has seen a steady decline over the last decade, as all major trade, business and enterprise has moved northeast across the Heart River and into the resurgent city of Nativity. Slowly, criminal groups have gained greater and greater footholds in Echo City, amassing power while such organizations as the UWC and Project Javelin turn a blind eye to the problems bubbling beneath the surface.

It was developed by Frontier Developments, also a developer of the similar theme park game RollerCoaster Tycoon 3. The game is available on the PlayStation 2, the PlayStation Portable, and Xbox.<br/><br/>Unlike some traditional management sim games that lock you out of the fun stuff, Thrillville allows you to create your own rides and ride them also. There is also an element of retail management, as you try to keep your prices in check with the expectations of your would-be customers.<br/><br/>Gameplay<br/>Basically, the concept of this game is to build your very own dream theme park that will satisfy people looking for a thrill. The idea is to keep customers happy by building amazing rollercoasters, carnival rides, and carnival games (such as bumper cars, arcade games, etc). In party play mode, you can play all the minigames available against the computer or friends. You also have to build facilities that would be available in amusement parks, such as bathrooms, food stalls, drink stalls and even some hat and balloon stalls. You may also talk and interact with your guests. Using a teen character you may also flirt with the opposite sex. If you have a child as an avatar, you may matchmake. You can play minigames to gain money, make loans, and hire staff to clean, entertain, and fix rides. Keeping your park happy will increase publicity, and money. There are missions availabale to do so that you may gain riches and other suprises.<br/><br/>Reception<br/>Thrillville was generally well-received, except by X-Play, which gave it 2 out of 5 stars, saying that it was &quot;as exciting as a tax audit,&quot; as well as citing a lack of customization and people to play with online.<br/><br/>Game Spot: 7.7/10 for Xbox, and 7.6 for PS2 <br/>IGN: 7.5/10 <br/>X-Play: 2/5 <br/>Game Informer: 7.75/10 <br/>Official PlayStation 2 Magazine-UK : 8/10<br/><br/>Sequel<br/>A sequel, entitled Thrillville: Off the Rails, was released on October 16, 2007 for the PlayStation Portable, Wii, PC, PlayStation 2, Xbox 360, and Nintendo DS.<br/><br/>Frontier Developments returned to create Off the Rails for all mentioned platforms, except for the Nintendo DS version, which was developed by DC Studios.

Infinitely slowly he raised his head and stretched his long neck, unfurled the wings, rose on his hind legs and stretched his spine causing the razor sharp barbs to vibrate. The long, spike-infested tail was swept forward and around his body, the tip resting just ahead of us; the utmost part of it twitching nervously, similar to a cat's tail. He leaned forward again, went down on his stomach and rested the head on the crossed forelegs, as if he had just changed his position while sleeping, in no way whatsoever alarmed by our presence. His body heaved in a deep inhalation, the jaws opened a couple of decimeters, the last thing we saw while living was how cascades of tiny, impossibly hot flames danced around the jaws and gigantic teeth of the Dragon.

A sequel, Killzone: Liberation was released on the PlayStation Portable and another followup, Killzone 2 was released for the PlayStation 3 on February 27, 2009. Killzone 3 was announced at E3 2010, and is scheduled to be released February 2011.<br/><br/>Gameplay<br/>The game has online capabilities and up to 16 players can participate in a game. However, there is no centralized online service but local servers, hence no worldwide competition.<br/><br/>The game features 8 maps which are based on maps from the Single Player Campaign. Battlefields features all weapons from the Single Player game, with the exception of the Laser Designator and the knife. Battlefields Offline features 1 player support with up to 15 bots, 6 gamemodes, and two teams (ISA and Helghast) available. The online portion is similar to the single player except there is no 2-player splitscreen.<br/><br/>Online play was well received by many. Shortly after the game was released, players found and began to exploit glitches in both the NA and EU versions of the game. The NA version of the game received two downloadable updates, the latest one patching the game to version 2.0. This eliminated many glitches and thus almost brought an end to the cheating.<br/><br/>Plot<br/>The game is set in an era of space colonization where the Helghast Empire has recovered from its defeat in the First Helghan War and launched a blitzkrieg against the outer Interplanetary Strategic Alliance (I.S.A.) colony planet Vekta. Vekta's orbital Strategic Defense (S.D.) platforms failed during the initial assault, allowing the Helghast to land swarms of soldiers onto the surface and making it all the more difficult for the outnumbered I.S.A. forces.<br/><br/>In the game, the Helghast are a faction of human descendants who colonized the planet Helghan many generations ago. The planet's harsh environment forced the Helghast to adapt and mutate so much that they can no longer be considered human. They are stronger, faster and more resilient than their human cousins, and possess a burning hatred for humanity. Except for a small number of half-breed Helghast and trained troopers, they require a gas mask and air processing tank that creates air similar to that found on the planet Helghan.<br/><br/>The player takes control of I.S.A. Captain Jan Templar, who is fighting off the Helghast invasion. Templar and his squad are called back to the base for reassignment, and are promptly sent to find the I.S.A. operative Gregor Hakha and the information in his possession. During the course of the game, the player also takes control of several other characters, such as Shadow Marshal Luger (a female special operations assassin), a heavy weapons specialist Staff Sergeant Rico Velasquez (a Helghast-hating soldier with an itchy trigger finger), and Colonel Hakha, a half-Helghast, half-Human spy.<br/><br/>As the game progresses the player discovers that General Stuart Adams, a high ranking ISA officer, is a traitor and a servant of Joseph Lente (the commanding General of The Third Helghast Special Forces Army) and was responsible for sabotaging the SD platforms, rendering them unable to defend against the Helghast. The EDF (Earth Defense Fleet) go to assist the Vektan Army, however Adams kills General Voughton and receives his security key, allowing him to reboot the platforms, and prepare an ambush for the EDF relief force.<br/><br/>Jan and the others confront Lente, only to find out that Hakha was a commander in chief for him. Lente says that Hakha's family was ashamed to even be related to him, except his brother who talked of his heroism. Because of this, Lente had Hakha's brother shot down. With anger in his eyes, Hakha shoots Lente dead.<br/><br/>The team fly to the central SD platform and confront Adams, who is wounded by Templar. The platform begins to break up and Adams is killed by falling debris while trying to escape. Finally, the team restore the SD platform, allowing the EDF fleet to fight off the Helghast.<br/><br/>"}, "75886": {"poll": [], "name": "Killzone: Liberation", "videogamemode": ["Network Multiplayer", "Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["AUS PSP Edition", "English/UK PSP Edition", "NA PSP Edition"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1131297.jpg", "videogameseries": ["Killzone"], "videogametheme": ["Aliens", "Science Fiction", "Space", "War - Future"], "videogamegenre": ["Shoot 'em Up"], "usersrated": "12", "videogamedeveloper": ["Guerrilla Games"], "videogamefranchise": ["Greatest Hits (Best Selling PlayStation Games, US)", "Platinum Range (Best Selling PlayStation Games, PAL)"], "videogameplatform": ["PSP"], "videogamehonor": ["2006 Game Critics Best Handheld Game of the Year Nominee"], "average": "7", "statistics": [], "videogamepublisher": ["Sony Computer Entertainment"], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1131297_t.jpg", "description": "From Wikipedia<br/><br/>Killzone: Liberation is a third-person action game for the PlayStation Portable, developed by Guerrilla Games, and is the sequel to the 2004 first-person shooter Killzone. Killzone: Liberation was released for on October 31, 2006 in the US and on November 3, 2006 in Europe. On March 5, 2009, it became available for download from the PlayStation Store. The game chronologically continues two months after where the first game ended. Killzone: Liberation should not be confused with Killzone 2 for the PlayStation 3, the next addition to the Killzone series. Killzone: Liberation is presented as a third-person shooter game, where its home console counterparts are presented as a first-person shooter. It is currently the only PSP installment in the series.<br/><br/>Gameplay<br/>This game features a top-down isometric view in contrast to the original Killzone game for the PS2, which was a first-person shooter. The resultant game can be seen as a mixture of a shooter and a dungeon crawler.<br/><br/>The player can only control Jan Templar, although he can board and control several vehicles: heavy machine gun turrets, a tank, a hovercraft and a jetpack. During some levels a 'buddy' can be ordered around (although some are unarmed). These 'buddies' are normally teammates (Rico and Luger) or people that have to be rescued (The three VIP's in the third mission, first chapter and Evelyn in the third mission, fourth chapter).<br/><br/>By collecting various pickups in the form of money cases, the player unlocks new weapons to use in the game. These weapons can be found in various weapons caches in certain levels. After enough money is amassed, the V2 upgraded weapons become available. The weapons in the caches are also converted into the V2 upgraded versions.The unlockable weapons are: The ISA Assault Rifle, Helghast Assault Rifle, a Helghast machine pistol, a Helghast sniper rifle, an ISA shotgun, a Helghast revolver, an ISA crossbow and a Helghast chaingun (The ISA assault rifle is the default weapon). After downloading chapter five updates for the ISA flamethrower and Helghast rocket launcher are available to unlock.<br/><br/>The player can also unlock upgrades to Templar's abilities by completing challenge games within certain limits (Such as shooting X number of targets without shooting the 'civilian' targets). These are ranked in bronze, silver and gold. Upgrades come in the form of carrying more items, hitting harder in close quarters combat, performing actions faster, unlimited ammunition or upgraded health.<br/><br/>Multiplayer<br/>Players can play via Ad-Hoc. Players can choose a team (between ISA and Helghast) and also choose a character in the multiplayer menu. There are a variety of game modes, including Deathmatch (where player kill one another regardless of team), Team Deathmatch(where teams kill one another) , Deathmatch Duel (where a slightly smaller portion of the map is cut off by barbed wire so players have a smaller area to manouevre in) , Capture the Flag (where teams try to get the enemy flag and bring it back to their flag) and Assault ( Where the Helghast team has to plant 3 charges of C4 around an ISA beacon and the ISA have to try and stop them). (Note: Deathmatch Duel is available after chapter five download). Infrastructure was only made available for download, and is not initially available for &quot;out of the box play.&quot; The game features headset compatibility for online play.<br/><br/>Downloadable upgrade<br/>The game was originally intended to have downloadable content from Day 1, but due to technical difficulties, the Downloads promised were initially un-delivered. On May 30th, 2007 the free downloadable upgrade was released. The upgrade included two additions:<br/><br/>Online multi-player support including two new multi-player maps and a new multi-player game mode. <br/>Chapter 5 of the single player campaign which concludes the game storyline. <br/>Also, the upgrade is delivered in two parts.

Because of this, the game has drawn comparisons with Bushido Blade, a fighting game known for featuring brief fights because of its realistic weapon-based combat.<br/><br/>The game features online versus and tournament multiplayer modes, as well as a number of single player minigames such as slicing up pig carcasses against a time limit and surviving waves of opponents on a single life bar.<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;Deadliest Warrior: The Game,&quot; available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "75907": {"videogame": ["Triple Pack: Xbox Live Arcade Compilation"], "poll": [], "name": "Limbo", "videogamemode": ["Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["iPhone/iPad edition", "Macintosh Downloadable edition", "PlayStation 3 PSN Downloadable edition", "PSN PlayStation 4 Downloadable edition", "Windows Downloadable edition", "XBLA Xbox One Downloadable edition", "Xbox 360 XBLA Downloadable edition"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic895936.jpg", "videogametheme": ["Morbid"], "videogamefranchise": ["Better Description Needed"], "usersrated": "343", "videogamedeveloper": ["PlayDead Studios"], "videogamegenre": ["Adventure", "Puzzle"], "videogameplatform": ["iPad", "Linux", "Macintosh", "PlayStation 3", "PlayStation 4", "Windows", "Xbox 360", "Xbox One"], "videogamehonor": ["2010 Game Critics Game of the Year Nominee", "2010 IGF Awards Excellence In Visual Art Winner", "2010 IGF Awards Technical Excellence Winner", "2010 IndieCade Best Audio Design of the Year Winner", "2010 Spike Best Independent Game of the Year Winner", "2011 British Academy Game Awards Best Art Direction of the Year Nominee", "2011 British Academy Game Awards Best Audio of the Year Nominee", "2011 British Academy Game Awards Best Gameplay of the Year Nominee", "2011 British Academy Game Awards Game of the Year Nominee", "2011 D.I.C.E.

A land reminiscent of Middle-earth has been ravaged by a mysterious, evil power. Crops, water, and the inhabitants themselves suffer from unexplainable illnesses and blights. A group of villagers ventured forth to seek the help of the reclusive wizard Astrix, but they have not been heard from in months. It is feared that few will survive the additional hardships of the coming winter, and so a second group is being dispatched. The four chosen are Bergon (a young carpenter), Praxix (a wizard), Esher (a healer), and Tag (a merchant). They leave their village behind to cross unknown lands with two goals: to discover the fate of the earlier party, and to plead Astrix for assistance.

It was developed by Kronos Digital Entertainment and published by Eidos Interactive. The story concerns three outlaws named Hana, Deke, and Glas who are trying to retrieve the missing daughter of a wealthy Chinese businessman. Essentially a cyberpunk adventure set in futuristic China, Fear Effect's storyline also incorporates elements of Chinese mythology...<br/><br/>Fear Effect features traditional survival horror gameplay with unshaded characters textured to resemble cel-shading. Rather than using pre-rendered 2D backgrounds, the environments are composed of streaming or looping full-motion video. As a consequence, the game is composed of four discs. There are also puzzles interspersed between action sequences, similar to other games of the survival horror genre.<br/><br/>The player controls one of three mercenaries (either Hana, Deke, or Glas) and pilots them through areas filled with human and non-human enemies. The game controls are similar to traditional survival horror tank controls, with an exception being that the characters can run and shoot simultaneously. When wielding two guns (one in each hand), they are also able to shoot multiple enemies at the same time. Another feature is the ability to duck and roll; whilst facing a number of the armed foes, the player can roll a short distance and avoid taking enemy fire.<br/><br/>The game's title refers to the player's life bar, a meter which resembles a pulsing EKG. When the player is damaged, the green line of the EKG will pulse faster and turn red. It is possible to 'regain' health by performing acts that will calm that character's heart rate. These include solving a puzzle or sneaking behind a guard to perform a stealth kill. Both will be rewarded with a health boost that brings the meter back to green.<br/><br/>"}, "75964": {"poll": [], "name": "Fear Effect 2: Retro Helix", "videogamemode": ["Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["European PlayStation edition", "North American PlayStation edition", "PSN Playstation 3 Downloadable edition"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic786629.jpg", "videogameseries": ["Fear Effect"], "videogametheme": ["Cyberpunk"], "usersrated": "4", "videogamedeveloper": ["Kronos Digital Entertainment"], "videogamegenre": ["Action Adventure"], "videogameplatform": ["PlayStation", "PlayStation 3", "PlayStation Vita", "PSP"], "average": "5.25", "statistics": [], "videogamepublisher": ["EIDOS Interactive", "Square Enix"], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic786629_t.jpg", "description": "From Wikipedia<br/><br/>Fear Effect 2: Retro Helix is a 2001 video game for the PlayStation. It was developed by Kronos Digital Entertainment and published by Eidos Interactive. Fear Effect 2 is a prequel chronicling the events that lead up to the original Fear Effect.<br/><br/>Retro Helix begins in Hong Kong in the year 2048. The player delves into the colorful histories of the original cast of three mercenaries - and newcomer Rain Qin - as well as the extraordinary circumstances that brought them together. In the wake of a degenerative global pandemic called EINDS (Environmentally Induced Nucleotides Degeneration Syndrome &ndash; pronounced &quot;ends&quot;), theft, murder, and terrorism have become big business.<br/><br/>Fear Effect: 2 Retro Helix features cel-shaded character models in pre-rendered pseudo-3D environments. Players take control of each of the four main characters at different times throughout the game, which enables multilateral perspective on the storyline.<br/><br/>Retro Helix mostly plays like survival horror games, relying on a third-person perspective. Similar to the initial entries in the Resident Evil series, the controls are mapped without regard to the character's current position or direction faced. Unlike the original Fear Effect, however, Retro Helix offers players the option of a more traditional control scheme. At the player's disposal is a small arsenal of weapons, including a variety of firearms including pistols, shotguns, and assault rifles, specialty equipment such as a hand-held EMPs and a taser, and one unique melee weapon for each character.<br/><br/>In spite of the heavy ordnance available, enemies are few and far between, with static as opposed to dynamic placement. The gameplay is intended to evoke tension and suspense, rather than relying on the nonstop action formula of standard shooters. This format has the consequence of making the gameplay more arguably less difficult, although it is offset by the relative ease at which characters can die from enemy attacks and a number of instant-death scenarios. The fear gauge present in the original game returns for Retro Helix, a variation on the health meter common to most action games.<br/><br/>"}, "75966": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic766625.jpg", "poll": [], "boardgamedesigner": ["Gil d'Orey"], "statistics": [], "yearpublished": "2010", "maxplayers": "4", "boardgameartist": ["Gil d'Orey", "Jo\u00e3o Menezes"], "boardgamepublisher": ["MESAboardgames"], "maxplaytime": "60", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic766625_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "60", "boardgamecategory": ["Adventure", "Civilization", "Educational", "Expansion for Base-game", "Nautical", "Travel"], "description": "Limited Edition - ESSEN 2010!<br/>Small Postcard expansion with wooden ship (the black ship) for Caravelas that was offered ONLY in ESSEN 2010!<br/><br/>Short description :<br/><br/>&quot;The Black ship is placed in the Port of Malaca, players can move the black ship by spending one Navigation Marker per space...<br/>In case of encounter with other ships the owner(s) role a die and suffer the consequences...&quot;<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": ["Limited Essen Edition Freebie"], "average": "6.17273", "name": "Caravelas: \"The Black Ship\"", "playingtime": "60", "boardgamemechanic": ["Card Drafting", "Hex-and-Counter", "Pick-up and Deliver", "Route/Network Building"], "age": "8", "boardgameexpansion": [], "usersrated": "33", "boardgamefamily": ["Caravelas", "Country: Portugal"]}, "75967": {"rpgdesigner": ["Johan Anglemark", "Anders Blixt", "Henrik Strandberg", "Marcus Thorell"], "rpgitemversion": ["Softcover version"], "poll": [], "name": "Monster och m\u00e4n i Ereb Altor", "rpgartist": ["Frank Frazetta"], "rpgproducer": ["Nils Gulliksson", "Olle Sahlin", "Stefan Thulin"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic804936.jpg", "usersrated": "2", "rpgsetting": ["Ereb Altor"], "average": "6", "statistics": [], "rpg": ["Drakar och Demoner (Expert, 4th & Chronopia 5th Editions)"], "rpgpublisher": ["Target Games"], "rpgcategory": ["Sourcebook (rules/options to enhance play)"], "rpggenre": ["Fantasy (High Fantasy)"], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic804936_t.jpg", "description": "From back of the book:<br/><br/>I Monster och M&auml;n kan du l&auml;sa om desse och m&aring;nga andre annorlunda &auml;ventyrare, monster, byggnader och f&ouml;rem&aring;l i Ereb.

But sometimes the referee can&rsquo;t run a game.  Typically when this happens, the playing group either cancels the session entirely, or ends up playing a board game.  But it doesn&rsquo;t have to happen this way.  The rules detailed in this document allow the players to run a session without a designated referee, and with no more than fifteen minutes of pre-game preparation.  It gets around the DM problem by separating the DM&rsquo;s work into six main tasks.<br/><br/>&quot;Essentially, the game is run via a set of random tables, with each player using die rolls and their own common sense to carry out their assigned task.  Each player is required to use a little discretion and a little impartiality, but only in one area of the game; and so they are still able to play and advance their character.  The Master is allowed to fudge with the results, modifying things as desired.  Masters are encouraged to make up different items not currently on the lists.&quot;<br/><br/>From the introduction:<br/>There are two major sections for this rulebook.  The first section covers group play; the second section covers solo play.

Madness. But a challenge, and like a foolish young upstart, I see the gauntlet at my feet and cannot help but take it up. Now, somewhat more the wiser for this work, I cannot help but cry: Woot! Ha-Ha! Did it! Have I learned anything? Hmmm.<br/><br/>Ok, so it is not very polished. So this forward is a bit unprofessional. I am very tired. But what the heck, you haven't had to do more than put some time and bandwidth into looking at this work, so you are probably somewhat forgiving. I hope.<br/><br/>My name is Evan, and I am trying to make a go of producing some materials for games. And here, in order that I show off some of the strange things I have going on in my head, is an entire game built within 24 hours. See <a target='_blank' href='http://www.24hourrpg.com' rel='nofollow'>www.24hourrpg.com</a> for info on this event and on why people like me are doing it. I hope you enjoy it.<br/><br/>When I began, I figured this was the perfect opportunity to try something experimental rather than classic. Experimental ideas do not get much of chance to be aired. The work needed to get them out there is usually too large to make them viable as a risk. There are long odds stacked against innovation.<br/><br/>First of all, I have always wanted to try to see what could be made of a game using the Seven Deadly Sins of Medieval Christian thought. Next, take a bit of inspiration from the White Wolf gaming system (in particular Wraith), and its fundamental simplicity of statistics. Take a helping of Nephilim concepts, and a dash of the GURPS points based character building. Add to the mix the concept of Enlightenment vs. Materialism and the Zen state. Toss in a gaming concept of my very own: the success of actions during a crisis are not governed by ability but are rather governed by motivation. Ability in turn governs results and the effectiveness of success. Then, turn on the mental blender.<br/><br/>So I decided to give a go to a few ideas that I am not sure will fly as full games concepts. I began by thinking of some of the more esoteric ideas I have come up with. Then I started mixing them up in my head.<br/><br/>I call this monstrosity Sin/Zen because of the primary driving forces of the system, and their philosophical origin. It is a system designed for games where abstracted motivational absolutes are the main thrust of game play. It is in no way focused upon material success, or even realism; but rather is designed to focus upon motivations and psychological flux of character development.<br/><br/>"}, "75568": {"poll": [], "name": "Sherlock Holmes and the Case of the Silver Earring", "videogamemode": ["Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["English/European Windows edition", "Mobile edition", "North American Windows (DreamCatcher) edition", "North American Windows (Ubisoft) edition"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1007540.jpg", "videogameseries": ["Adventures of Sherlock Holmes"], "videogametheme": ["Detective / Mystery", "Historical"], "videogamefranchise": ["Sherlock Holmes"], "videogamedeveloper": ["Frogwares", "Xendex Entertainment"], "videogamegenre": ["Adventure"], "videogameplatform": ["Other Mobile Devices", "Windows"], "usersrated": "7", "average": "7.21429", "statistics": [], "videogamepublisher": ["Digital Jesters", "DreamCatcher Interactive", "Ubisoft Entertainment S.A.

Since Noby Noby Boy's initial release, Takahashi himself has admitted that he is &quot;not completely satisfied with the game&quot;.<br/><br/>Gameplay<br/><br/>The player takes control of a worm-like quadrupedal character referred to as BOY. Using the controller, the left analog stick moves the front of Boy while the right stick controls the back. By moving both ends in opposite directions, the player can stretch Boy's abdomen to great lengths. The player may maneuver Boy around its environment, interacting with stationary objects like houses, or AI-controlled characters such as barnyard animals.<br/><br/>The player accumulates points by how much they stretch during gameplay. These points can be submitted online via a character called Sun to another character called GIRL. Points submitted online by players to Girl will be added cumulatively, causing Girl to stretch and unlock new levels. Beginning on Earth, Girl has stretched to the Moon, Mars, and Jupiter and will proceed to several other planets, each unlocking new playable environments for Boy to stretch in. The Noby Noby Boy team expected players to take between one to two weeks of cumulative play time to reach the Moon. The moon was reached on February 23, 2009, just four days after release.

Unlike most first person shooters, this gun for this game is mounted to the machine, requiring players to physically alter their position to shoot. Other notable characteristics of the game include:<br/>The Gun: The gun itself is not a light gun, but mounted on an oversized joystick. The featured sniper rifle in the game is based upon the HK MSG-90.<br/><br/>Gun Scope: The gun used in Silent Scope arcade machines is shaped as a sniper rifle, and its scope features a small LCD display to show a zoomed-in view of the current area.<br/><br/>Time Limit: Players are constantly fighting against the clock at the top of the game, time is increased after clearing an area of all enemies.<br/><br/>Life Recovery: To recover life lost in the game, players must look for beautiful women and train the scope on them.<br/><br/>Auto-reload: Players do not reload the gun, the magazine is reloaded automatically after every five shots.<br/><br/>Bosses: Bosses have a set amount of hit points (normally 5 or 10 unless they are in a vehicle) they can be killed with one shot if the player hits them in the head.<br/><br/>The game was successful enough to spawn sequels: Silent Scope II, Silent Scope 3, Silent Scope EX and a version for the Game Boy Advance. A port has also been announced for the iPhone OS.

It is the first DSiWare game to feature a level editor in which players can create custom-made levels and send them to players on other devices via a wireless Internet connection.<br/><br/>Mario vs. Donkey Kong: Minis March Again! features puzzle-solving gameplay, which was made popular in the previous two games in the series. Just as in the game Lemmings, Mario must lead his Mini-Mario toys to the end of the level. Like with Mario vs. Donkey Kong 2: March of the Minis, players do not control Mario but instead miniature wind-up versions of Mario, Princess Peach, Toad, and Donkey Kong&mdash;referred to as &quot;Minis&quot;&mdash;in order to rescue Pauline from the game's antagonist, Donkey Kong. In each level, players must get all their Minis to the end of the level at a designated exit while avoiding obstacles and enemies (mostly consisting of enemies from the other games in the Mario series).<br/><br/>One notable difference in this game and the predecessor is that all of the end of level bonuses are now required. In the previous game, extra points were earned by getting all Minis to the exit, getting them to the exit with no long time intervals between any two Minis, and getting them to the exit without stopping any of them. In Minis March Again, the door is boarded up and the player fails the level if any Minis don't make it to the exit within a few seconds of another Mini getting to the exit, and none of the minis may be stopped or turned directly by the player.

Then the Gods left Enshar to walk amongst the stars and they left the Darvinor, ranked highest amongst the Elven folk, as their custodians. But the Darvinor were hungry for knowledge that was kept from mortal races and they led the children of Enshar away from the enlightenment of the Gods and so brought down the Darktime upon them all.<br/><br/>For an age of unaccounted years, utter chaos engulfed the world and all that was learned was lost. Then hope was rekindled in the form of the legendary Books of Law, three great tomes that contained the lost beliefs and rituals of the twenty-seven religions that had existed before the Darktime. The scattered tribes of the Humans were united in the northern continent of Eldoria and a new enlightened era began, the Age of the Redemption.<br/><br/>Two thousand years have passed since the discovery of the Books of Law and the nations of Men now dominate Eldoria, from the frigid realm of Char-Endl, to the exotic desert lands of the Theocracy of Y'sira. They have unlocked the secrets of steel and stone but their ascendancy has been very different than our own world. For in Eldoria, Man has also learned the secrets of Magic, resulting in a reliance on arcane power that has retarded the emergence of science. Combined with the suspicion and secrecy that the abundance of religious institutions apply to any new discoveries, Man has remained locked in a quasi-medieval level of technology.<br/><br/>Yet Man is not alone in Eldoria. The Dwarven Stonekin once dwelled in mines beneath the great mountain ranges, but for many centuries they have been abandoning their old ways and coming to live amongst the cities of Men (though their elders still tell tales of ancient glory). And in the east, the Leezari Elves have recently emerged from a self-imposed isolation from before the Darktime, seeking allies to help them in their eternal war against the Goblinkynd of Ahr-Ganiz.<br/><br/>Civilisations have arisen, empires have come and gone but the temples of the Gods remain constant, involving everyone in their rivalries and machinations. Political intrigue is almost a sport amongst the clergy and a talented individual can keep their purse full by serving the many and varied clandestine causes of the twenty-seven priesthoods.<br/><br/>Yet far from the great cities, there are still places that remain untouched in the modern world, such as the great forests of Llanish Highlands, the impenetrable jungles of Po-Ka or the Outlands, where magic is weak and inconstant. Great fortunes lie in wait for those bold enough to journey there to uncover the relics and treasures of the past.<br/><br/>Eldoria is the new d20 campaign setting from Comstar Publishing; an immersive world of dangerous liaisons, mystery and expeditions down dungeons deep.

However, the core game mechanics remain constant, allowing players to combine ships from different products to create new scenarios and explore any number of &quot;what-if&quot; situations.<br/><br/>Although designed as a hex-n-counter board game, Grand Admiral can be easily adapted to tabletop play using any scale of naval miniatures.

Not content to be a B-movie actor, he fought his way to the top, started his own studio and became one of Tinseltown's most acclaimed and prolific directors! Well, at least that's how Uncle Buddy would have told it. Actually, he married wealthy former debutante Hildegarde Montague, whose trust fund enabled Buddy to open a studio. His movies earned a lot of money but very little critical regard... but he did manage to crank out more than 600 &quot;masterpieces&quot; before dying of a heart attack several years ago. Who can forget such classics as Attack of the Killer Rutabagas, It Came from the Neighbor's House, or Meltdown on Elm Street? Now dear Aunt Hildy has passed on as well, and the player's character learns the terms of their rather unusual will.<br/><br/>As the favorite among all of Buddy and Hildy's nephews and nieces, the player's character stands to inherit the entirety of the Burbank estate, including their palatial home Hildebud. But only if the player can find the ten treasures (props from Buddy's films) that crafty Aunt Hildegarde has hidden on the grounds, that is. Oh, and it all has to be done in the space of one night.<br/><br/>Hildebud is filled with props, posters, and other memorabilia from Buddy's numerous films: a model of Tokyo complete with Atomic Chihuahua, the Maltese Finch, and a statue of &quot;Buck Palace, the Fighting Mailman&quot; (star of such films as Postage Due and Special Delivery). Adding to the atmosphere are hidden passages, a convoluted hedge maze, and other bizarre features of the estate.

Hordes of nannies are blocking all exits from the Gardens, and the grass actively resists efforts to be walked upon. Worst of all, a gleam on the horizon soon heralds the unwelcome arrival of a Soviet nuclear missile. Time begins to slow as the missile approaches, and with some ingenuity the player's character finds an incongruous door hovering in mid-air. There's no telling where it may lead, but it can't possibly be worse than the alternative of being at ground zero of a nuclear detonation...<br/><br/>The doorway leads to a strange land, where impossible objects exist. Space and time don't seem to behave in the familiar ways here. Exploring this new environment, the player finds several other mysterious doors, each of which leads to another chapter in the history of nuclear weaponry. After visiting test sites (including ones in Siberia, Nevada, and the Eniwetok Atoll) and Nagasaki just before each device is detonated, the player has one scenario left to deal with. The final door leads to the New Mexico desert on July 16, 1945, mere minutes before the test-firing that will change the course of history. But something is wrong at the &quot;Trinity&quot; site, and without the player's intervention things will go horribly awry.<br/><br/>"}, "75640": {"rpgartist": ["Theodor Black", "Alan Pollack", "Cynthia Reep", "Lawrence Whalen, Jr."], "rpgitemversion": ["First printing", "PDF Version"], "poll": [], "name": "The Magic Dump", "rpgdesigner": ["Roland Janbergs"], "rpgproducer": ["Kle Hall", "David K.

It is the first game in the Mega Man Legends sub-series of Mega Man games from Capcom, and the first major 3D polygonal Mega Man title released in the franchise. It was released on the PlayStation in 1997 in Japan and in 1998 in North America. A Nintendo 64 port was released in 2000 with the same title, but it was renamed Mega Man 64 for the English release in 2001. Another port was released for Microsoft Windows in 2001, and PlayStation Portable in 2005, with the latter exclusively in Japan.<br/><br/>It stars a different spiritual incarnation of Mega Man named Mega Man Volnutt, the game's playable character. Mega Man Volnutt is a &quot;Digger&quot;, a person in charge of investigating ruins from a flooded Earth. During his journey with his friends, their ship crushes in Kattelox Island, where Mega Man decides to confront pirates who are attacking it to obtain the its hidden treasure. As an action roleplaying game, Mega Man Legends's gameplay is very different from the ones of the original series despite sharing a few elements.<br/><br/>The game was produced by Keiji Inafune who remarks that he and the Capcom staff enjoyed designing the game. Since its original release Mega Man Legends has received positive critical response due the series jump from 2D graphics to 3D. Ports for the Nintendo 64 and Windows received negative comments for lacking updates from the PlayStation version whose graphics were considered outdated by the time the ports were released.

Released in Japan in 1999 and in North America and Europe in 2000, the game is part of the Mega Man Legends (Rockman DASH) series and the prequel of the first Legends game. Rather than focusing on the &quot;good guy&quot; characters of Megaman Trigger and Roll Caskett, the game follows series anti-hero Tron Bonne, sister of the criminal Bonne family of air pirates. The Japanese counterpart included PocketStation support whereas the North American and European version did not.<br/><br/>Gameplay<br/><br/>Unlike other games in the Mega Man series, TMoTB bears three distinct play styles, each related to a specific mission. Players are tasked with completing (with gradual difficulty) &quot;moving-box&quot; puzzle stages (containers of various contents in Teche and Primiki Harbor), a Descent-like adventure stage, and several action stages similar to the remainder of the Mega Man Legends series (robbing a bank near Gold City and exploring the Nakkai Ruins themselves). Another gameplay aspect is a collection mission built into one of the action missions, located in Sart Farm, where you must gather pigs, cows and horses. Players can choose freely among the three stage types at any time, but each level (except for the Nakkai Ruins) may only be cleared once.<br/><br/>Instrumental in the game's story is the interaction between Tron and her army of forty loyal Servbots. Each Servbot is given a personality and a few other traits, and the player's investigation and interaction is rewarded with money for the loan, additional parts and weapons for the Gustaff, or other assistance. Servbots also play a role during the adventure and action stages (limited to seven, three or one, depending on the type, generally one leading the others, and called &quot;sniper&quot;), assisting Tron in her quest by ransacking houses or defeating minor threats as the situation and their individual skills warrant. A Servbot's skills may be increased by putting him through training exercises (attack and speed), going on missions (brains) or by disciplining him in the Torture Room (thus lowering the sloth level); in both cases, the effect of the action is determined by a minigame. Some Servbots express their special skill by minigames or by special items.<br/><br/>"}, "75667": {"poll": [], "name": "Mega Man Legends 2", "videogamemode": ["Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["EU PlayStation version", "JP PlayStation version", "JP PSP version", "JP Windows version", "US PlayStation version"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic862381.jpg", "videogameseries": ["Mega Man Legends"], "videogametheme": ["Science Fiction"], "videogamefranchise": ["Mega Man"], "videogamedeveloper": ["Capcom Co., Ltd."], "videogamegenre": ["Action RPG"], "videogameplatform": ["PlayStation", "PSP", "Windows"], "usersrated": "11", "average": "8.13636", "statistics": [], "videogamepublisher": ["Capcom Co., Ltd."], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic862381_t.jpg", "description": "From Wikipedia<br/><br/>Mega Man Legends 2, known in Japan as Rockman DASH 2 - Episode 2: Great Inheritance (\u30ed\u30c3\u30af\u30de\u30f3DASH 2 \u30a8\u30d4\u30bd\u30fc\u30c9\uff12 \u5927\u3044\u306a\u308b\u907a\u7523 Rokkuman Dasshu Ts\u016b Epis\u014ddo Ts\u016b Ooinaru Isan?), is an action role-playing game released by Capcom in 2000, acting as a sequel to Mega Man Legends. It was released for the PlayStation in April 2000 in Japan, October 2000 in North America and August 2001 in Europe. Unchanged Japanese ports of the game were also released for the PC in July 2001 and for the PlayStation Portable in September 2005. The game features Mega Man Volnutt's quest to find four keys hidden in the planet in order to aid in the search of the Mother Lode, a legendary treasure thought to be an infinite energy source.<br/><br/>A demo of the game was originally featured in the spin-off The Misadventures of Tron Bonne, with its purpose being to show an overview of the gameplay of the title despite having an independent story. Critical reception to Mega Man Legends 2 has overall been positive with video game publications praising how the graphics and the gameplay improved over the ones from its prequel. Additionally, the game's story was praised for how complex it is in comparison to the ones from the original series.<br/><br/>Gameplay<br/><br/>The gameplay from Mega Man Legends 2 is very similar to the one from its prequel and has a few changes. The player controls the protagonist Mega Man Volnutt in his explorations through ruins and fights against Reaverbots. The ruins, however, are from various islands in contrast to the prequel in which most ruins belonged to Kattelox Island. The player is able to travel to other islands with Roll's ship, the Flutter, although the he can only enter to certains islands by completing different missions. Unlike Mega Man Legends in which the player could enter to different ruins by having the approval of Kattelox's major, here the player must pass different tests in order to win Digger licenses from a specific level. The license allows Mega Man to enter into ruins which are forbidden to lower-class Diggers. Additionally, when winning a license, the Reaverbots' health is higher, but once they are destroyed, they drop more refractors' shards which are used in shops to buy items. Mega Man's interactions with other characters can also affect the character's state depending whether he is good with other people or makes them angry. Mega Man is also able to grab objects or people which help the player to complete missions. Mega Man can also suffer from special damage when fighting Reaverbots or touching fields that damage him such as lava. If the player equips Mega Man specific body part, he will become invulnerable to such states. Another addition is the underwater dungeon, in where the objects' weight is reduced and Mega Man can jump higher. The energy of the special weapons, which are developed by Roll using unusable items, are now shown in two energy bars, one green and one blue. The blue bar indicates how much energy the weapon has, while the green bar shows how much energy is consumed when the weapon is used.<br/><br/>"}, "75668": {"poll": [], "name": "Whist 22", "playingtime": "20", "minplayers": "3", "boardgamemechanic": ["Trick-taking"], "yearpublished": "0", "usersrated": "4", "maxplayers": "5", "boardgamefamily": ["Tarot Games", "Traditional Card Games"], "average": "7.625", "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["(Public Domain)"], "boardgameversion": ["Public Domain version"], "maxplaytime": "20", "boardgamecategory": ["Card Game"], "age": "0", "minplaytime": "20", "description": "This is a trick-taking playing card game played using 22 cards.<br/>The game is similar in mechanism to Oh Hell, but simpler to grasp because there is no suit.<br/>It is usually played using a tarot deck, keeping only the 21 trumps and the fool.<br/>If a tarot deck is not available, then it can be played using two suits (one suit for values 1 to 10, the other one for values 11 to 21) and the fool.<br/><br/>Summary of the rules:<br/><br/>If played in partnerships, partners sit across the table from each other.<br/><br/>Players begin the game with 14 points.

This is the contract. The dealer is the last to announce, but the sum of announced tricks must not equal the number of cards dealt to each player.<br/><br/>Let us follow the same example, where 5 cards were dealt to each player: player A announces 2 tricks, players B and C each announce 1 trick. Then the dealer cannot announce 2 tricks because the total would be 5 tricks and each player could fulfill his contract. The player to the left of the dealer starts. The winner of a trick is the one who will start the next trick. The owner of the fool must assign its value (0 or 22) when he plays it.<br/><br/>At the end of the round, each player counts the number of tricks he has won and compare it to the number of tricks he has announced.

There are two opposing players: Roman and Barbarian. The Roman player represents the high command of a centralized empire; the Barbarian player represents the various chaotic forces working to destroy that empire. The Roman objective is to reconsolidate the threatened empire and secure its frontier regions to prevent further barbarian invasion. The Barbarian objective is to grab as much Roman territory as possible.

Although there are only two races per pairing, players may travel to either of the other two pairings to help fight with their friends and allies. There are four types of RvR combat: Skirmishes (random world encounters), Battlefields (objective-driven battles in RvR-specific areas), Scenarios (instanced, point-based battles against the opposing faction), and Campaigns (invading enemy lands and capital cities). RvR contribution includes both Player vs. Player (PvP) combat and (to a lesser extent) Player vs. Environment (PvE) quests so that you can assist your realm in their victory, regardless of preferred play-style.<br/><br/>All activities in WAR contribute to the campaign, as it is the primary focus of the game. Each of the aforementioned activities generate Victory Points (VP) which measure a realm's progress in capturing a zone. When one realm reaches a designated amount of Victory Points in a particular zone, that zone falls under their control and the war pushes deeper into enemy territory. This back and forth struggle for zone control continues until one side holds two racial pairings, and the attacking side may sack, loot, and pillage the enemy's capital city. The capture of a capital city is the pinnacle objective of the campaign. Once a capital city is taken, the attackers are given a period time to loot the city. When this period expires, the defeated players receive increasing support from NPC guards until they are able to force the attackers out of their city and close the gates. At this point the campaign then begins anew, restarting the cycle.<br/><br/>"}, "75689": {"rpgdesigner": ["Jon Andersen", "Loren Dean", "Alex Flagg", "Ian Homeyard", "R. M.

The display is in three sections - an overhead map of Paris, a small 3D view from the car's point of view, and a scanner showing May Day's height.

Like most of Bullfrog's games, Theme Hospital is permeated by an eccentric sense of humour. The game is the thematic successor to Theme Park, a game also produced by Bullfrog.<br/><br/>The game is set in a hospital, and requires the player to build an environment which will attract patients with comical complaints, illnesses, emergencies, and diseases. The game has a somewhat dark sense of humour, which is similar to that of Theme Park in many ways. The player has no direct control over the patients that wander the hospital, although gameplay largely centres on influencing their actions in one way or another. The player does, however, have the ability to pick up any staff member in the building and move them to a different area (to speed up their movement from place to place) and to expel any patients from the hospital (if they are being a nuisance, causing rowdiness or about to die and affect the hospital's statistics). The player may also force the patient into taking a chance of possible cure at the risk of killing the patient (this is useful, for example, if a patient is about to die but has already completed enough diagnostics requirements to identify the kind of disease the patient is suffering from) and rearrange the queue of each of the rooms in the hospital (useful for moving dying patients to the front of the queue so they can receive treatment first).<br/><br/>Each level consists of an empty hospital to plan and design, with set goals in the fields of financial attainment, patients cured, percent of patients cured, and hospital value. Holding negative funds or allowing sufficient patients to die will bring about losing requirements. When the goals have been met the player has the option to move on to a new, more elaborate hospital with tougher winning conditions and more diseases present. The final level in the game, 'Battenburg' consists of an enormous, yet somewhat awkward, hospital with all the diseases and rooms in the game present, all disasters frequent and very high winning requirements.<br/><br/>"}, "75726": {"poll": [], "name": "NBA Live 95", "videogamemode": ["Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["NA DOS edition", "NA Genesis edition", "NA SNES edition"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1043163.jpg", "videogameseries": ["NBA Live"], "videogametheme": ["Sports - Basketball"], "videogamegenre": ["Sports"], "videogamedeveloper": ["Hitmen Productions"], "videogamefranchise": ["NBA"], "videogameplatform": ["DOS", "SEGA Genesis", "SNES"], "usersrated": "10", "average": "5.96", "statistics": [], "videogamepublisher": ["Electronic Arts Inc.

Three sets of ten rounds are played, afterwards, whoever has most money is the winner.<br/><br/>(User summary by HilkMAN)<br/><br/>"}, "75737": {"videogame": ["Final Fantasy XI", "Final Fantasy XI Online: Chains of Promathia", "Final Fantasy XI Online: Rise of the Zilart", "Final Fantasy XI Online: Treasures of Aht Urhgan"], "poll": [], "name": "Final Fantasy XI Online: Starter Pack", "videogamemode": ["Massively Multiplayer"], "videogameversion": ["English/UK Windows edition", "French Windows edition", "German Windows edition", "US Windows edition"], "average": "0", "videogameseries": ["Final Fantasy XI"], "videogametheme": ["Fantasy"], "videogamegenre": ["MMO"], "videogamedeveloper": ["Square Enix"], "videogamefranchise": ["Final Fantasy"], "videogameplatform": ["Windows"], "usersrated": "0", "statistics": [], "videogamepublisher": ["Square Enix"], "videogamecompilation": ["Final Fantasy XI", "Final Fantasy XI Online: Chains of Promathia", "Final Fantasy XI Online: Rise of the Zilart", "Final Fantasy XI Online: Treasures of Aht Urhgan"], "description": "[User Summary]<br/><br/>A compilation of the base &quot;Final Fantasy XI&quot; game along with the 3 expansions &quot;Rise of the Zilart&quot;, &quot;Chains of Promathia&quot; and &quot;Treasures of Aht Urhgan&quot;.<br/><br/>"}, "75738": {"videogame": ["Final Fantasy XI", "Final Fantasy XI Online: Chains of Promathia", "Final Fantasy XI Online: Rise of the Zilart", "Final Fantasy XI Online: Treasures of Aht Urhgan", "Final Fantasy XI Online: Wings of the Goddess"], "poll": [], "name": "Final Fantasy XI Online: Ultimate Collection", "videogamemode": ["Massively Multiplayer"], "videogameversion": ["US Windows edition", "US XBox 360 edition", "Worldwide Windows Downloadable edition"], "average": "0", "videogameseries": ["Final Fantasy XI"], "videogametheme": ["Fantasy"], "videogamegenre": ["MMO"], "videogamecharacter": ["Kobold"], "videogamedeveloper": ["Square Enix"], "videogamefranchise": ["Final Fantasy"], "videogameplatform": ["Windows", "Xbox 360"], "usersrated": "0", "statistics": [], "videogamecompilation": ["Final Fantasy XI", "Final Fantasy XI Online: Chains of Promathia", "Final Fantasy XI Online: Rise of the Zilart", "Final Fantasy XI Online: Treasures of Aht Urhgan", "Final Fantasy XI Online: Wings of the Goddess"], "videogamepublisher": ["Square Enix"], "vgcharacterversion": ["Kobold"], "description": "[User Summary]<br/><br/>A compilation of the &quot;Final Fantasy XI&quot; base game along with the 4 expansion packs &quot;Rise of the Zilart&quot;, &quot;Chains of Promathia&quot;, &quot;Treasures of Aht Urhgan&quot; and &quot;Wings of the Goddess&quot;, as well as a collection of add-on scenarios.<br/><br/>"}, "75739": {"videogame": ["The Gold Collection II (ZX Spectrum)"], "poll": [], "name": "Kung-Fu Master", "videogamemode": ["Hotseat", "Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["Amstrad Edition", "Apple II Edition", "Arcade Edition", "Atari 2600 Edition", "Atari 7800 Edition", "C64 Edition", "English/European NES edition", "North American Game Boy edition", "North American NES edition", "ZX Spectrum edition"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic784902.jpg", "videogametheme": ["Martial Arts"], "videogamefranchise": ["NES Black Box (1980s NES Games, US)"], "videogamedeveloper": ["Irem", "Nihon Bussan"], "videogamegenre": ["Beat 'em Up"], "videogameplatform": ["Amstrad CPC", "Apple II", "Arcade", "Atari 2600", "Atari 7800", "Commodore 64", "Game Boy", "NES", "ZX Spectrum"], "usersrated": "37", "average": "6.5473", "statistics": [], "videogamepublisher": ["Absolute Entertainment", "Activision", "Data East", "Irem", "Nihon Bussan", "Nintendo Co., Ltd.", "U.S. Gold Ltd"], "videogamecompilation": ["Gold Collection II (Amstrad CPC)", "Gold Collection II (Commodore 64)", "The Gold Collection II (ZX Spectrum)"], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic784902_t.jpg", "description": "From wikipedia:<br/><br/>Kung-Fu Master, known in Japan as Spartan X (\u30b9\u30d1\u30eb\u30bf\u30f3X?), is a 1984 beat 'em up arcade game developed and published in Japan by Irem.

It is the sequel to Anno 1602 and the predecessor to Anno 1701.<br/><br/>Anno 1503 begins with the player in control of a ship filled with men and material searching for an island to settle. After finding a suitable site city building begins. Resources begin as food and cloth, but progress into more complicated and different goods. Eventually, citizens become Aristocrats, and require at least ten different goods and numerous services, such as access to a large church or a bathhouse. The game is constructed around one human player and three computers. Like Anno 1602, the AI computers are progressive, meaning that they advance along with the human players. The computer players also have adjustable personalities, which the player customizes before the beginning of a game.

The celebration of &quot;Constitution Day&quot; in Ostnitz will include a speech by Litzenburg's American ambassador; there is a plot in motion, however, to assassinate the ambassador in an effort to provoke hostilities between the superpowers. Border Zone consists of three chapters, each of which places the player in the role of a different character. An American businessman, a KGB agent, and an American spy become entangled in the assassination plot and efforts to either stop it or ensure its success.<br/><br/>The tension is increased by the introduction of real-time events in the game.

Like most of Infocom's games, it was released for several platforms simultaneously thanks to the portable Z-machine.<br/><br/>The original release included versions for DOS, the Apple II, Atari ST, Atari 8-bit family and Commodore 64. Later, it was ported to the Amiga with the addition of sound effects, making it the first title with that feature. The effects would play at appropriate times in the game in an effort to intensify the horror atmosphere. This marked one of the few major additions to the Z-machine with the exception of graphics; traditionally, Infocom had eschewed such changes in favor of expanding the parser capacity and overall size of game files.<br/><br/>The game starts with the player trying to finish a term paper at G.U.E. Tech, a large MIT-like American university. The player has braved a snowstorm to travel to the school's computer lab to work on the report. The document is now mangled beyond repair, however; with the help of a hacker, the player finds that the file has been partially overwritten by the Department of Alchemy's files. Although the game begins as a quest to try to salvage the term paper, alarming events soon unfold, revealing a powerful evil within the school's depths.<br/><br/>What began as a mere snowstorm has strengthened into a full-force blizzard. The player must traverse the University grounds in an attempt to recover the term paper's data. Much of the campus is deserted and covered in snowdrifts, rendering walkways impassable. The only accessible avenues are steam tunnels and a small complex of buildings. In the course of unraveling the mystery, the player encounters demons, zombies and sinister references to a recent campus suicide. Failing to set things right in the hidden passages beneath the school will result in a literal fate worse than death.<br/><br/>"}, "75770": {"videogame": ["Classic Text Adventure Masterpieces of Infocom", "The Comedy Collection", "The Lost Treasures of Infocom II"], "poll": [], "name": "Nord and Bert Couldn't Make Head or Tail of It", "videogamemode": ["Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["US Amiga edition", "US Apple II edition", "US Atari ST edition", "US Commodore 64 edition", "US DOS edition", "US Macintosh edition"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic773795.jpg", "videogametheme": ["Comedy"], "usersrated": "5", "videogamedeveloper": ["Infocom"], "videogamegenre": ["Puzzle", "Text Adventure"], "videogameplatform": ["Amiga", "Apple II", "Atari ST", "Commodore 64", "DOS", "Macintosh"], "average": "7.6", "statistics": [], "videogamepublisher": ["Infocom"], "videogamecompilation": ["Classic Text Adventure Masterpieces of Infocom", "The Comedy Collection", "The Lost Treasures of Infocom II"], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic773795_t.jpg", "description": "From Wikipedia<br/><br/>Nord and Bert Couldn't Make Head or Tail of It is an interactive fiction computer game written by Jeff O'Neill and published by Infocom in 1987.

Nord and Bert was unique among Infocom games in that it was highly surrealistic, centering around word play and puns. It is Infocom's twenty-seventh game.<br/><br/>Nord and Bert defies easy description, and in fact almost seems to have been created in an effort to be as strange as possible. For example, the title and front box illustration (two farmers staring at an animal that consists of two cows' rear halves fused together) have nothing to do with the game. Rather, Nord and Bert revolves around several different kinds of wordplay, with a &quot;chapter&quot; of the game dedicated to each style. The first seven chapters can be played in any order, since each exists as an independent &quot;short story&quot; unrelated to the other chapters; to begin the eighth, however, the player must provide seven &quot;passwords&quot; provided by completing each of the other sections.<br/><br/>The only effort made to interlink the separate parts of the game is as follows: reality has somehow been altered around the town of Punster.

Plundered Hearts was Infocom's first (and only) game in the &quot;romance&quot; genre. It is Infocom's twenty-eighth game.<br/><br/>In a move that was formerly unusual for Infocom but increasingly common after its acquisition by Activision, Plundered Hearts casts the player in a well-defined role. The lead character is a young female in the late 17th century who has received a letter. Jean Lafond, the governor of the small West Indies island of St. Sinistra, says that the player's father has contracted a &quot;wasting tropical disease&quot;. Lafond suggests that his recovery would be greatly helped by the loving presence of his daughter, and sends his ship (the Lafond Deux) to transport her.<br/><br/>As the game begins, the ship is attacked by pirates and the player's character is kidnapped. Eventually the player's character finds that two men are striving for her affections: dashing pirate Nicholas Jamison, and the conniving Jean Lafond. As the intrigue plays out, the lady does not sit idly by and watch the men duel over her; she must help Jamison overcome the evil plans of Lafond so they have a chance to live happily ever after.<br/><br/>"}, "75772": {"videogame": ["Classic Text Adventure Masterpieces of Infocom", "The Lost Treasures of Infocom II", "The Mystery Collection"], "poll": [], "name": "Sherlock: The Riddle of the Crown Jewels", "videogamemode": ["Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["US Amiga edition", "US Apple II edition", "US Commodore 64 edition", "US DOS edition", "US Macintosh edition"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic773803.jpg", "videogametheme": ["Detective / Mystery"], "videogamegenre": ["Text Adventure"], "videogamedeveloper": ["Infocom"], "videogamefranchise": ["Sherlock Holmes"], "videogameplatform": ["Amiga", "Apple II", "Commodore 64", "DOS", "Macintosh"], "usersrated": "0", "average": "0", "statistics": [], "videogamepublisher": ["Infocom"], "videogamecompilation": ["Classic Text Adventure Masterpieces of Infocom", "The Lost Treasures of Infocom II", "The Mystery Collection"], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic773803_t.jpg", "description": "From Wikipedia<br/><br/>Sherlock: The Riddle of the Crown Jewels is an interactive fiction computer game designed by Bob Bates and published by Infocom in 1988. Like most titles Infocom produced, the use of ZIL made it possible to release the game simultaneously for many popular computer platforms, including the Apple II, IBM PC, Atari ST, and Commodore 64. Sherlock is based on the legendary fictional detective Sherlock Holmes, created by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle. It is Infocom's thirty-first game.<br/><br/>The year is 1887, and all of England is gearing up for the celebration of Queen Victoria's Golden Jubilee, marking her 50th year as monarch. London, naturally, is especially frenzied. Reading the paper one morning, Sherlock Holmes seizes upon one seemingly unimportant notice: the Tower of London has been closed for &quot;reasons of security.&quot; The great detective is unsurprised when, moments later, he is asked to investigate the theft of the Crown Jewels. The clues left behind, however, positively reek of a carefully-laid trap; Sherlock decides that he must step aside and allow Dr. Watson to pursue the thief instead. But if the Jewels are not replaced within 48 hours, the British government will be forced to admit that their most prized possessions were stolen and suffer worldwide humiliation.<br/><br/>The player fills the role of Watson, travelling around London in Hansom cabs while attempting to recover the Crown Jewels while encountering many characters from Doyle's stories such as Mrs. Hudson, Mycroft Holmes, and Wiggins of the Baker Street Irregulars. A series of riddles and clues lead Watson on a hunt for inscribed jewels hidden at several famous sites across the city, including Westminster Abbey, Madame Tussauds Wax Museum, London Bridge, and Big Ben. Eventually, the villain is revealed as Professor Moriarty, who captures both Watson and Holmes. With quick thinking and the help of some humble medical supplies, however, Watson manages to subdue Moriarty and return the Jewels to the Tower in time.<br/><br/>"}, "75774": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic766053.jpg", "poll": [], "boardgamedesigner": ["Henrik Berg", "\u00c5se Berg"], "statistics": [], "yearpublished": "2010", "maxplayers": "4", "boardgameartist": ["Alexandre Roche"], "boardgamepublisher": ["White Goblin Games"], "maxplaytime": "45", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic766053_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "45", "boardgamecategory": ["Expansion for Base-game", "Medieval"], "description": "Released in october 2010.<br/><br/>Official rules &mdash; The Judge:<br/>A player holding this card may, at any time during his turn, move one of his cubes on the board to the palace area AND take one of his cubes back into his own stock.
