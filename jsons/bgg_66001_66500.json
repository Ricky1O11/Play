Gabriel, Michael and Uriel formed a power block and refused to give up on the concept of determinism. Samael favored free will, and wanted a democratic decision made about it, but Phanuel refused them all point blank, saying that as the Face of God, He/She/It had to have the last say. Israfil tried to set Himself up as mediator (as usual), but was distracted as Raphael and Haniel almost came to blows over whether humanity should experience pain. Only Azrael, the Angel of Death, stayed out of it. As It watched the ensuing threats and complaints, It found Itself shaking Its head. With the entirety of creation at stake, a metaphysical argument could cause a fall from grace for eternity. It would be a miracle if they got it all started without killing themselves.<br/><br/>Looking at the universe we got, who said it was not created by a committee?<br/><br/>Archangels : In the Beginning is a Freeform LARP (Live Action Role Play) event game using A Token System, set at the dawn of time for sixteen parts of the mind of God.

An English edition was released in the fourth quarter of 2010. The designer of the game, Klaus Teuber, has stated that he completely reworked many of the original card game's mechanics to make it easier for newcomers to play the game.<br/><br/>Each player portrays a prince for Catan, developing their individual provinces and competing to build a more successful province than the other.  The basic mode of play is similar to the original Catan Card Game, where players expand their provinces by building settlements connected by roads.  Players may also build expansions in their settlements that aid them in various ways, or upgrade their settlements to cities to allow more expansions to be built.  They build these additions by using resources that they accumulate each turn, which are determined by the roll of a die.  Cards are drawn on each turn to replenish the players' hands.  The players may also use action cards that directly affect either their own province or their opponent's province.<br/><br/>The Rivals for Catan features a reduced pool of cards, without the more aggressive style of action cards found in the original Catan Card Game.  Therefore, all action cards will be able to be used from the beginning of the game unlike in the original card game.<br/><br/>Ways to Play:<br/>The Introductory Game focuses on the basics of the card game, featuring gameplay that is more appropriate for newcomers.  This game is played to 7 victory points and includes 36 Expansion Cards in four stacks.  This play style should take beginner players 25 to 30 minutes to play.<br/><br/>Three Theme Games add more rules, expansions, and aggressive cards.  These Theme Games may be played individually or combined to play a variant called &quot;The Duel of the Princes.&quot;  Each Theme Game adds 24 Expansion and Event Cards to the cards from the Introductory Game, which are placed in two stacks separately from the cards from the Introductory Game.  When playing a Theme Game, playtime should be around 45 to 60 minutes.<br/><br/>As with the original Catan Card Game, players can also play the Tournament Game, in which each player chooses specific cards to build their deck ahead of time from which they draw from during the game.<br/><br/>Theme:<br/>The theme of The Rivals for Catan is no longer restricted only to the feudal era of the Middle Ages like the original Catan Card Game.  The Introductory Game portrays the very early years of the world of Catan, while each Theme Game takes place in progressively later eras.  These eras are known as &quot;The Era of Gold,&quot; &quot;The Era of Turmoil,&quot; and &quot;The Era of Progress.&quot;<br/><br/>Belongs to the Catan Series.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": {"296647": "Bulgarian edition 2015"}, "average": "7.08166", "name": "The Rivals for Catan", "playingtime": "120", "boardgamemechanic": {"2041": "Card Drafting"}, "age": "10", "boardgameexpansion": {}, "usersrated": "3845", "boardgameaccessory": {"156679": "Die F\u00fcrsten von Catan: 6 Kartenhalter"}, "boardgamesubdomain": {"5497": "Strategy Games"}, "boardgamefamily": {"3": "Catan"}}, "66057": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic655585.jpg", "poll": {}, "boardgamedesigner": {"3": {"name": "(Uncredited)"}}, "statistics": {}, "yearpublished": "0", "maxplayers": "4", "boardgameartist": {"3": "(Uncredited)"}, "boardgamepublisher": {"3320": {"name": "(Unknown)"}}, "maxplaytime": "20", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic655585_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "20", "boardgamecategory": {"1031": {"name": "Racing"}}, "description": "Ialian cycling game from the 1950's.

Some tiles also have special traits which can affect their whole unit or their whole army.<br/><br/>Armies fight in three sectors - the battlefield. The goal is to eliminate at least half the value of your opponent's army.<br/><br/>Pocket Battles: Elves vs. Orcs is the second game in the series of &quot;Pocket Battles&quot;, after Pocket Battles: Celts vs. Romans.<br/><br/>The series is designed to have each army fully compatible with any other, so it will be possible, for example, to fight with orcs against Romans, or to have a mixed army of elves and Celts.<br/><br/>The basic rules of the game are fairly simple; two armies face each other in battle. The armies are split into three columns and two rows. Players must decide, at the start of the game, how many points they will give to their armies, determining how many points it will take to defeat the opponents army. (At least half of the points).<br/><br/>On your turn; you have to choose which faction of your army you will send off to battle! Attacks are made by using Order Tokens. If no Order Tokens are present on a unit, it costs just 1 token to issue orders to that unit. Issuing orders to the same unit in the same Battle Round would cost you the number of tokens present on the unit, plus 1. (So if there is one token on your unit, it would cost you two more tokens; if you had three, it would cost you four tokens, and so on).<br/><br/>After a round of battle, you may choose to redeploy you units. (Units may move from the back of the row to the front of the same row, from the back of a row to the back of another row, or from the front of a row to the front of another row). Redeployment will not cost you any Order tokens.<br/><br/>When one army has eliminated half of the other's original deployment value, that battle round concludes the game, and the player who has defeated the greatest total point-value of opposing units is the winner.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": {"245498": "English second edition"}, "maxplaytime": "20", "average": "6.67405", "name": "Pocket Battles: Elves vs. Orcs", "playingtime": "20", "boardgamemechanic": {"2072": "Dice Rolling"}, "age": "8", "usersrated": "736", "boardgamesubdomain": {"4664": "Wargames"}, "boardgamefamily": {"19299": "Fairies, Elves and Pixies"}}, "66082": {"rpgitemversion": {"170271": "booklet (POD)"}, "poll": {}, "name": "Straddle County", "rpgproducer": {"10543": "Brett M.

It is designed to allow the characters to alter events on a world shattering level. Incorporating elements of the Elemental Dimension of Magic, Inglemia goes back to the Prime Material roots of the eternal conflict between the Jeshatan and the magic hating Knah'tan.<br/><br/>From the introduction:<br/><br/>The Fate of Inglemia is not a module. It is a product designed to give the GM a primer to establish a set of parameters for an Epic campaign involving the City State of Inglemia and its encounter with their ancient cousins, the Jeshatan of the Elemental Dimension of Magic. This product incorporates elements from the products The Elemental Dimension of Magic EDM001 through EDM013. Thematically speaking, the game is designed for characters of around PL 13, allowing them to go up in level every two sessions well into the epic levels and beyond. While it is certainly possible to use this product for a low level game, the GM also has the tools to allow his players to be movers and shakers on a primal level.<br/><br/>While the core strategic campaign was originally designed to have the players be agents that defend Inglemia, they could just as easily be agents bent on its destruction. Inglemia certainly is not without plenty of enemies nor is it without flaw. While it is a fantastic place, there is still rot at the core and it is primed for change; whether good or ill is up to the players&hellip;and you.<br/><br/>"}, "66102": {"boardgamedesigner": {"34093": {"name": "Keith Warren"}}, "boardgamesubdomain": {"4664": "Wargames"}, "poll": {}, "name": "Marlborough s'en va-t-en guerre", "playingtime": "180", "minplayers": "2", "yearpublished": "2003", "usersrated": "4", "boardgamefamily": {"9793": "Age of Kings"}, "maxplayers": "0", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic766494_t.jpg", "average": "7.625", "statistics": {}, "boardgamepublisher": {"11369": {"name": "Real Time Wargames"}}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic766494.jpg", "maxplaytime": "180", "boardgamecategory": {"2726": {"name": "Age of Reason"}}, "age": "0", "minplaytime": "180", "description": "Miniatures rules for the early 18th century.

In every room, players will face choices, skill checks or battles, and maybe rewards (as xp, gold or loot cards)<br/><br/>There're 8 kind of skill checks, and each checks can slightly differ from the others of the same kind (number of players involved, special rule, etc.). Most of the skill checks use Destiny Tiles (which are 16 thick cards, which also represents monsters) and a special timer (with 3 difficulty levels)<br/><br/>     Balance Check: the player must put a Destiny Tile on the top of his head, walk/run around and sit down again without letting the tile fall.<br/>     Climbing Check: the player must put a Destiny Tile on the top of his head, stand up on his chair, then sit down again without letting the tile fall.<br/>     Dexterity Check: the player must build a house of cards using Destiny Tiles.<br/>     Speed Check: the player must put a Destiny Tile on the edge of the table, then slap it up the air and catch it before it falls back down.<br/>     Precision Check: a player stands 3 steps from the table, holding the game box, and the others must throw Destiny Tiles into the box from the other side of the table.<br/>     Intelligence Check: players play a memory game with the 16 Destiny Tiles<br/>     Coordination Check: players stands a step from the table, and must circle all the Destiny Tiles around the table, throwing them from one player to the next.<br/>     Stamina Check: the player must stand on one leg, with a Destiny Tile on his other knee and another one on both of his forefingers, without dropping down either one.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>The battles are also timed and are played with Letter Cards, that can be exchanged one by one between 2 players. They are used to spell special words (several different words for each character) as blows to the enemy. Every time a player plays cards to spell a word, he draw 3 new cards and keep on playing. At the end of the battle, if there're enough blows, the enemy is defeated. For instance, the sorceress can cast a spell by spelling &quot;wazaaa&quot; with any number of a's at the end, wounding the enemy for every extra a's. The barbarian can misspell a letter in each of his word. The bard and the ranger can make other players draw cards. And so on&hellip; For every 3 cards played with a punch symbol on it, a player takes one wound him/herself.<br/><br/>Using gold and/or xp, characters can level up (up to level 3) and gain access to more powerful attacks or skills. The party can rest up to 3 times a game to recover from one wound each. If a player dies, he shuffles his character sheet with the other available sheets and pick one : if it's the same, he  recovers all his health and keep all his loot, gold and xp; if it's another one, he dies, loses everything, and continues the game as a totally new character.<br/><br/>If the players defeat Zangdar the Sorcerer in the 14th room (4 tiles with different rules so every game doesn't end the same way), they win the game.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "3", "boardgameversion": {"61837": "French first edition"}, "name": "Le Donjon de Naheulbeuk", "playingtime": "60", "boardgamemechanic": {"2023": "Co-operative Play"}, "age": "10", "boardgameexpansion": {}, "usersrated": "184", "boardgamesubdomain": {"5498": "Party Games"}, "average": "6.77446"}, "66126": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2055686.jpg", "poll": {}, "boardgamedesigner": {"77": {"name": "Mike Fitzgerald"}}, "statistics": {}, "yearpublished": "2009", "maxplayers": "4", "boardgameartist": {"62316": "Joe Boginski"}, "boardgamepublisher": {"1001": {"name": "(Web published)"}}, "maxplaytime": "30", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2055686_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "30", "boardgamecategory": {"1002": {"name": "Card Game"}}, "description": "Alcatraz Island is home to one of the most formidable federal prisons ever conceived.

G/Sol agents are professionals, experts in their fields who undertake the highest priority assignments (such as hunting terrorists, pirates, cyber-hackers, and even rogue Battle Born troopers). Since most humans are tainted by the Pacification Virus, billions of citizens rely on G/Sol for protection. It is a heavy burden, but the skills and equipment available to G/Sol are superior to those of the Battle Born.<br/><br/>G/Sol&rsquo;s duties are many and varied. Agents collect military intelligence and serve as troops, judicial enforcers, and system governors. They are the only squads entrusted with the defense grids and matrix records on Terra. They also monitor worm hole traffic and oversee the transport of restricted purified substances for use in research.<br/><br/>In times of war, G/Sol handles POWs, and plans and implements psychological warfare operations. They control the Tetra-League's &quot;Bridging Unit,&quot; which operates and defends specialized worm-hole junctions used for rapid troop deployments. They also handle combat engineering and all large scale anti-armor and orbital defense platforms not otherwise assigned to the Fusiliers. For the most part, though, G/Sol are the cops.<br/><br/>The Guardians of Sol expansion for Era Ten introduces new investigative and combat skills, new power armor and weapons, new starship guidelines, and new combat and progression tables. The game also includes new Quick-and-Dirty systems and valuable tips for planning and running exciting police-style adventures, to make the referee&rsquo;s job easier and more enjoyable.<br/><br/>Guardians of Sol is a stand-alone game that includes all rules needed for play. It meshes seamlessly with the Battle Born RPG, the Era Ten RPG, and other sci-fi role-play products by Better Games, but is easily adaptable to any Sci-Fi role-playing game.<br/><br/>Guardians of Sol first appeared in print in Space Gamer/Fantasy Gamer Vol 2, Issue 5(the ISBN number refers to this printing).

The point, like all recreational activities, is to have fun. More specifically, the point of Hanamichi is to create stories addressing issues the players find interesting. These issues will probably deal with love, trust, honor, betrayal, sacrifice and passion; at least, those are the issues the game was designed with a view towards. The setting presents the players with certain elements and even pushes them to confront certain ideas, but the ultimate but the ultimate decisions (and, thus, outcomes) are in their hands. And because the emphasis is on stories, imagination is paramount.<br/><br/>Hanamichi has certain objectives to complete, and an ending, but the players should ideally have fun even if (perhaps especially if) their characters are killed. Imagine an informal basketball game among friends... &quot;Do you remember that awesome dunk I made?&quot; &quot;Well, I sunk that great three-pointer!&quot; Though the points may show that someone won and someone lost, it is still possible for everyone to have fun and create an experience they value. (It may be useful for the players to voice their priorities in this regard before playing; it will certainly be useful in diagnosing problems between players.)<br/><br/>Hanamichi is intended to be played in short sessions, what roleplayers might consider &quot;one-shot&quot; scenarios. An entire game should not take more than a few hours. (In theory, anyway...) It is intended to be played by not less than three and (probably) at most eight players. The more players, the longer play time. (The game will be a little smoother with an even number of players, but odd numbers are not impossible.) Each player will need paper and writing utensils, and play will also require at least two six-sided dice, which may be shared among players. Also, each player should write their name (as well as the names of their two characters, when they know them) on a slip of paper. These slips of paper will be put into a hat (or a bag, or just the middle of the table) to be chosen randomly. Finally, players will require &quot;tokens&quot; of two distinct types: Hanamichi and Mie tokens. These tokens have distinct uses in Hanamichi. Anything can be used as long as the two types of tokens can be distinguished, and there are at least twice as many Hanamichi tokens and three times as many Mie tokens as there are players. (Only a rough estimate.) Nickels and pennies may be used, or in a pinch, players can simply record them on their Geisha sheets and cross them off as they're used.<br/><br/>"}, "66151": {"boardgamedesigner": {"3": {"name": "(Uncredited)"}}, "poll": {}, "name": "Virtual Derby", "playingtime": "0", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": {"2014": "Betting/Wagering"}, "yearpublished": "2002", "usersrated": "0", "boardgamefamily": {"7523": "Animals: Horses"}, "maxplayers": "12", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic662551_t.jpg", "average": "0", "statistics": {}, "boardgamepublisher": {"11523": {"name": "Virtual Games Ltd."}}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic662551.jpg", "boardgameversion": {"119477": "First Edition"}, "maxplaytime": "0", "boardgamecategory": {"1072": {"name": "Electronic"}}, "age": "18", "minplaytime": "0", "description": "From the Box:<br/><br/>The Ultimate Interactive Theme Party Game!

These cards are drawn whenever a player begins a new row.<br/>The hand is over when one player&rsquo;s hand is depleted. The other players are penalized for cards remaining in their hands.

The game is ingeniously simple. A player has ten seconds to study a card that shows players past and present in action and is then asked a question about the card, chosen by the roll of a die. If the card is answered correctly the card is kept, if not it is returned to the box. The most cards held after ten minutes decides the winner.

New core classes like the ghostblade and the guttermage, and even a barrister NPC class for those PCs needing good legal representation.<br/><br/>&quot;This time out, I&rsquo;ve called upon a greater variety of writers as well. Sure, I tried to use the old favorites who designed the original Great City and Great City Adventure Arcs. Yet I was also fortunate enough to be able to incorporate a few other very talented writers as well. This, of course, is what happens in every great city: change and progress. I hope you find it as fantastic and enjoyable as I did to read their interpretations and fresh ideas on what might be going on in the Great City.&quot;<br/><br/>"}, "66429": {"rpgitemversion": {"19667": "PDF Version"}, "poll": {}, "name": "Archipelago (Second Edition)", "rpgproducer": {"6600": "Matthijs Holter"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic660467.jpg", "usersrated": "7", "average": "8.28571", "statistics": {}, "rpg": {"4467": "Archipelago"}, "rpgcategory": {"2083": "Core Rules (min needed to play)"}, "rpggenre": {"156": "Fantasy (Low Fantasy)"}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic660467_t.jpg", "description": "From the game's introduction:<br/><br/>Archipelago is a story/role-playing game where each player controls a major character.

I wanted a game that was about great conflicts, but at the same time treated its characters' stories with respect. I wanted not a steel framework, but a spider web of thin threads creating subtler stories.<br/><br/>This game works best if you play it slow. Sometimes, the best thing to do is wait a little and see how things unfold. Ged stayed with Ogion for years, learning about the old language, the names of flower petals and bugs.

Players draft new customers and try to serve them with food cards they draw at the beginning of each turn. This way they earn the money and the reputation each customer represents. However, before they have a chance to do so, cards with &quot;Unforeseen Events&quot; are played by every player, affecting the game in many different ways like altering the order in lines, adding more customers, decreasing the opponent's reputation etc. And of course, each player has to take into consideration that the customers are served on a first-come basis. If someone's order can't be fulfilled, everyone behind him will have to wait another turn...<br/><br/>The first player to reach a certain level of money and reputation is declared the winner.<br/><br/>The game is going to be published by the Greek company &quot;Kaissa Chess &amp; Games&quot; during 2011.

A fierce hand-to-hand fight ensued, with the fighters on both sides hiding behind the the statues on the bridge.  The battle took the toll of many dead and wounded on both sides.  The present game is based on this particular battle with all its snares and personal fights.&quot;<br/><br/>The rules are in Czech, English, German and French.  The board is a simple checkerboard-type surface on medium-weight cardboard.  The only other components are 28 small wooden blocks, 14 dyed red, 14 in their natural light brown coloring. There is a coin on the front of the box that is tossed at the start of the game to determine how many moves the Swedish player gets.<br/><br/>Each player places their 14 men on the first two rows of squares on each side of the board. The men can move one square in 12 possible directions.  You eliminate your opponent's men by landing on their square and can take another turn provided you can eliminate another man with that move.  All men can jump over each other.
