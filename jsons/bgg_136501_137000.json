To win the game, players need to manage their cards to arrange aircraft takeoffs and landings on the two airport runways and collect stars as fast as possible.  The first player to obtain 10 stars or points WINS!<br/><br/>Game Setup:<br/>-Each player takes two Aircraft of the same color.<br/>-Shuffle the Action Card deck and deal each player 5 cards.<br/>-The rest of the Action Cards are placed face-down in the section of the board marked &ldquo;Action Card (Draw)&rdquo;<br/>-Shuffle the Aircraft Cards with the Scenario Cards. Place the deck face-down in the section of the board marked &ldquo;Aircraft Card (Draw)&rdquo;.<br/><br/>Game Play:<br/>-The order of play is to be determined by the players.<br/>-At the start of each player&rsquo;s turn, the player should make sure that each of the three Aircraft Card spaces, both North and South, has an Aircraft Card as shown here. If any of these spaces are empty, the player should draw cards from the Aircraft Card (Draw) pile to fill them. After the player finishes his turn, the next player should again replace the Aircraft Card spaces from the Aircraft Card (Draw) pile if necessary.<br/>-If a Scenario Card is turned up before the game starts, no action is needed, and the drawn Scenario Card should be inserted back at the bottom of the Aircraft Card (Draw) pile. In subsequent turns, the instruction on the Scenario Card must be executed prior to any other action by any player.<br/>--A player can take a maximum of three actions on each turn; in other words, he or she can play a maximum of three Action Cards. All played Action Cards are discarded at the area marked &ldquo;Action Card (Discard)&rdquo;.<br/><br/>Action Descriptions:<br/>-Take off from the Runway, Play a &ldquo;Takeoff Permit&rdquo; Action Card, or &ldquo;Landing Permit&rdquo; Action Card.<br/>-Select a face-up Aircraft Card from the &ldquo;Aircraft Card space.<br/>-Place an Aircraft on the selected Aircraft Card and place the set at the first space of the Runway.<br/>-A player uses &ldquo;Arrow&rdquo; Action Cards to move the Aircraft on the runways by matching the number of stars on the Aircraft Card. For example:<br/>-1-Star Aircraft: Requires one &ldquo;1 Arrow&rdquo; Action Card to move the Aircraft one space forward.<br/>-2-Star Aircraft:Requires one &ldquo;2 Arrows&rdquo; Action Card OR two &ldquo;1 Arrow&rdquo; Action Cards to move the Aircraft one space forward <br/>-3-Star Aircraft: Requires one &ldquo;3 Arrows&rdquo; Action Card, OR one &ldquo;2 Arrows&rdquo; Action Card plus one &ldquo;1 Arrow&rdquo; Action Card, OR three &ldquo;1 Arrow&rdquo; Action Cards to move the Aircraft one space forward.<br/>-So, the higher the number of stars an Aircraft Card has, the more difficult it is to move because it requires more arrows on the Action Cards. Using more &ldquo;Arrow&rdquo; Action Cards than what is required is acceptable for moving the Aircraft, but the player will not receive the difference back. For example, a player can use a &ldquo;3 Arrows&rdquo; Action Card to move a 1-Star Aircraft one space. However, the other two arrows will be forfeited.<br/><br/>-When a player has moved the Aircraft to the third space on the South Runway AND then uses one or more &ldquo;Arrow&rdquo; Action Cards that allow the Aircraft to move one more space forward, the takeoff process is complete. The player may keep the Aircraft Card and get a score according to the number of stars shown on the card. The first player to obtain 10 stars wins.<br/><br/>-An Aircraft that has not completed the takeoff process in one turn will remain in its final position on the runway until the player&rsquo;s next turn. Aircraft idling on the runways are subject to other player&rsquo;s actions, including &ldquo;Diversions&rdquo; and instructions shown on drawn Scenario Cards.<br/><br/>Diversion:<br/>-When a player wants to take off, land or move an Aircraft on the runway but is obstructed by another player&rsquo;s Aircraft, he may use a &ldquo;Diversion&rdquo; Action Card to divert it.<br/>-When a player uses a &ldquo;Diversion&rdquo; Action Card to remove another player&rsquo;s Aircraft, the player being diverted can use an &ldquo;Emergency Takeoff / Landing&rdquo; Action Card to stop the diversion. Without the emergency card, the affected Aircraft Card will be removed tothe &ldquo;Diverted Flights&rdquo; area.<br/>-When 10 Aircraft Cards have been removed to &ldquo;Diverted Flights&rdquo;, the game ends in a draw.<br/><br/>Other Important Points :<br/>-A player cannot keep more than 10 Action Cards at any time; otherwise, he or she needs to discard the extra cards in the &ldquo;Action Card (Discard)&rdquo; area.<br/>-When no more Action Cards remain, shuffle the cards from the &ldquo;Action Card (Discard)&rdquo; area and place the shuffled deck face-down at the &ldquo;Action Card (Draw)&rdquo; area.<br/><br/>"}, "136504": {"poll": [], "name": "Wer wird Million\u00e4r? 2012 HD", "videogamemode": ["Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["Android edition"], "average": "0", "videogametheme": ["Movie, Book, TV show"], "usersrated": "0", "videogamedeveloper": ["Glu Mobile"], "videogamegenre": ["Trivia"], "videogameplatform": ["Android"], "statistics": [], "videogamepublisher": ["Glu Mobile"], "description": "User Summary<br/><br/>Implementation of the well known German game show &quot;Wer wird Million&auml;r?&quot; (Who wants to be a millionaire?).

The game is based closely on the mechanics and statistics of the Original, Basic and Advanced Dungeons and Dragons family of games (O, B and AD&amp;D). These games are widely available, understood and loved, and the author believes they present an excellent (if often unappreciated) format for adventure roleplaying in Middle Earth. B&amp;B can be thought of as a short set of conversion notes for Middle Earth campaigns using the spells, monsters, magic items and other materials available through previous Dungeons and Dragons games.<br/><br/>Nevertheless, B&amp;B differs in several important respects from published editions of D&amp;D: most noticeably, it lacks rigidly defined character classes, replacing them instead with the more flexible and setting-appropriate notions of &lsquo;roles&rsquo;, which are more flexible concepts that combine character race, homeland and occupation. Also, characters do not have alignments; instead &lsquo;traits&rsquo; provide the mechanism for describing a character&rsquo;s loves, hates and other passions. The list of spells available in the game and sorts of characters capable of learning them differ from official editions of D&amp;D. There are a number of smaller and greater changes in the rules governing attack, defense, spell casting, saving throws, healing and other detailed mechanical issues. Noteworthy influences include Pendragon, Prince Valiant, The Fantasy Trip, Tunnels and Trolls, and 3rd and 4th (and even 5th) edition D&amp;D. Nevertheless, most of these changes are transparent during play: the actual flow of action and most of the rolls made during a game closely resemble early editions of D&amp;D.<br/><br/>Two things about these rules may be controversial (at least, among those interested to read them!): Many gamers believe magic in Middle Earth should be subtle and mostly out of the hands of player characters. I believe the action and spirit of the books are actually captured quite well by the magic of D&amp;D, provided one judiciously prunes the spell lists to remove powers that are clearly out of step with the setting and re-organizes into groups of powers that resemble iconic character types in the stories. A more technical argument might be made with my choice to make B&amp;B compatible with Basic and Advanced D&amp;D rather than one of the more tightly engineered modern editions. This comes down to a question of taste: the author is old, mentally frayed and prone to nostalgia, and so pre-3rd edition forms of the game are a natural personal choice. These editions also have a more whimsical tone and flexible approach to rules. I believe both of these characteristics can help gaming groups explore their<br/>understanding of Tolkien&rsquo;s worlds through free-form roleplaying rather than a rigid set of mechanics. Note that in making this choice I&rsquo;ve forced on the readers the long-debated descending scale for armor class used in pre-3rd editions of D&amp;D. If this is simply too difficult or aesthetically distasteful for you to accept, I&rsquo;m giving you one last chance to set down this book or close your pdf reader and walk away.<br/><br/>The monsters, spells and magic items for Balrogs and Bagginses are directly from or closely patterned after previous editions of Basic and Advanced Dungeons and Dragons. This mechanical compatibility with previous editions means groups can freely import incorporate content from previous editions consistent with their own vision of the setting. Shambling mounds in the Old Forest? Lurker&rsquo;s Above in the Underdeeps? A deck of many things in Saruman&rsquo;s library? You won&rsquo;t find these things explicitly included in this volume, but if you wish to include them in your campaign, knock yourself out!<br/><br/>"}, "136510": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1534783.jpg", "poll": [], "boardgamedesigner": ["T.

But the Pioneers have no idea that the Indians aren't the biggest danger in this land. Disgusting creatures from ancient legends of the Redskins again roam the plains in search of victims, and the power of faith alone can't stop them. For this purpose, it takes fearless daredevils and mighty guns. What luck for the endangered settlers that the posse is sent by a U.S. Marshall in a secret mission to this spot in the middle of nowhere. But what about the mysterious &quot;Major&quot; and his gang? And why are the Indians preparing for war? Questions to which an answer must be found urgently, while the real threat lurks yet unnoticed under the dusty floor of the prairie ...<br/><br/>From the backcover (German original version):<br/>In den Weiten Pr&auml;rie Montanas siedeln nicht nur Indianer der Sioux-Nations, auch einige unerschrockene Siedler wagen sich gelegentlich in das Grenzland &ndash; wie etwa eine kleine religi&ouml;se Sekte, die hier abseits aller Versuchungen ihren Garten Eden errichten will.

Hierzu braucht es schon unerschrockene Haudegen und m&auml;chtige Bleispritzen. Was f&uuml;r ein Gl&uuml;ck also f&uuml;r die bedrohten Siedler, dass das Aufgebot von einem U.S. Marshall in geheimer Mission in dieses Fleckchen mitten im Nirgendwo geschickt wird. Doch was hat es mit dem geheimnisvollen &bdquo;Major&ldquo; und seiner Bande auf sich? Und wieso r&uuml;sten die Indianer zum Krieg?

Normally, each player &quot;invests&quot; two of these cards to begin the round, placing them face down in front of himself. Players use their own hidden information (the cards they've invested) and the other players' bids to make educated guesses about the true value of the market (i.e. the total quantities of each commodity present among all players' cards), while trying not to give too much away themselves.<br/><br/>One player kicks off the bidding, making a prediction about the minimum number of a given commodity present among all player's cards, for instance &quot;Five Wheat.&quot; The next player must then either increase the bid, or &quot;sell,&quot; thereby challenging the previous player's bid. When increasing the bid, however, players can choose between increasing the quantity (e.g. &quot;Seven Wheat&quot;) or adding a commodity to make a combo bid (e.g. &quot;Five Wheat and Gold,&quot; meaning that there are at least five of each). A player who is stuck, neither wanting to increase the bid nor challenge, has a third option available: investing an additional card (up to a maximum of 4) in order to change the bid to a new commodity (or combo) entirely, for instance, changing from &quot;Five Wheat and Gold&quot; to &quot;Six Oil.&quot; The catch is that this additional card increases the player's potential losses should they be the eventual loser of the round.<br/><br/>When a player sells, all cards are revealed, and the loser of the challenge loses all the cards he had invested: his initial two, plus any additional cards he invested in order to change the bid. A player without cards is eliminated, and the last player standing is the winner.<br/><br/>Cash or Cash plays well in groups from two to eight (though with the usual caveats about player elimination when playing with a large group, i.e. make sure there's something to do for those out early), and features two additional game modes and an optional &quot;doubling&quot; rule to accommodate different groups' preferences.<br/><br/>In Endurance mode, only one card is invested by each player to start, and the bids can only be raised in single steps, for a more tactical game. In Blitz mode, on the other hand, players may bid and challenge out of turn, and there is no cap on the number of cards a player can invest; challenging successfully out of turn allows players to recover a card lost in an earlier round.<br/><br/>With the doubling rule, the bidder who is being challenged may &quot;double&quot; in response to the following player calling &quot;sell.&quot; The challenger must then either withdraw her challenge and bid as usual, or else persist in the challenge, with the stakes now doubled (i.e. the loser will have to discard additional cards from their hand equal to the number lost normally).<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": ["English/French first edition"], "name": "Cash or Crash", "playingtime": "30", "boardgamemechanic": ["Auction/Bidding", "Commodity Speculation", "Hand Management", "Press Your Luck"], "average": "5.71429", "usersrated": "14", "age": "14", "boardgamepodcastepisode": ["The Party Gamecast Reviews - Cash or Crash"]}, "136529": {"statistics": [], "name": "Colora Go!", "playingtime": "0", "minplayers": "0", "yearpublished": "2013", "usersrated": "3", "maxplayers": "0", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2290144_t.jpg", "average": "6.23333", "boardgamepublisher": ["GoKids \u73a9\u6a02\u5c0f\u5b50", "Hobby World", "MJ Games"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2290144.jpg", "boardgameversion": ["Chinese first edition", "English/French first edition", "Russian first edition"], "maxplaytime": "0", "poll": [], "age": "5", "minplaytime": "0", "description": "A game of speed and observation for young players<br/>A mischievous fairy has stripped the Universe of its colors !<br/>Armed with paintbrushes, the players must restore the objects and animals to their natural colors.<br/><br/>"}, "136531": {"rpgartist": ["Art Fantasies", "Octavirate Entertainment", "Sade", "Sphere Productions"], "rpg": ["Myriad"], "statistics": [], "name": "Glimpse the Beyond", "rpgdesigner": ["Travis Legge"], "rpgproducer": ["Travis Legge"], "usersrated": "0", "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1534277.jpg", "rpgitemversion": ["PDF version"], "rpgsetting": ["Glimpse the Beyond"], "average": "0", "rpggenre": ["Fantasy (Modern Urban Fantasy)", "Horror (Supernatural)", "Occult (Magic)"], "rpgpublisher": ["Aegis Studios"], "rpgcategory": ["Alternate Rules (Variant Core Rules)", "Campaign Setting (game world)"], "poll": [], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1534277_t.jpg", "description": "From publisher blurb:<br/><br/>The world of Glimpse the Beyond is very much like the real world on the surface.

In turns, players attempt to play a card in a strict ascending order: you can only place a 2 on a 1, a 3 on a 2 etc. (card colors do not matter) with the exception of playing a 1 on a 7 (the highest card) on the discard pile.

But the total grows only when a player plays a card that is of a different color than the last card played. And when a Joker is played, the total goes back to zero again.

Hamstern (Hoarding, age 8+)<br/>A simplified Cheeky Monkey-like game with cards drawn from a deck instead of a bag (and cards in the discard deck are reused later) and two wild cards. On a turn, a player may draw cards until either (1) he chooses to stop or (2) he draws a number that he has lying in front of him from a previous draw this turn. In this latter case, he discards all new cards in front of him and the next player then takes his turn. In the former case, he keeps the cards (in the order they were collected.

If Eligiere were light, Bucoli are dark.<br/><br/>When choosing from the mortal world, Bucoli take the most cold, calculating, money-loving SOBs in the city. Lawyers, doctors, stockbrokers and those willing to do whatever it takes to get the job done are welcomed into the House.<br/><br/>Wielding the powerful Dark Gift of Spiritus, Bucoli are inducted into an undead fraternal organization where each member begins as a recruit and has his/her sponsor bring them to The Assembly. Upon going through the Rites, a member may be inducted, embracing their new life, Turned in a ceremony and blessed by the House priest. After this moment the new member must cut throats and backstab to get to the top as he's knocked to the bottom of the status-quo. Given his newfound powers, the Liberi must adhere to not only the Blood Laws, but the laws of his House in order to survive. Only those who prove themselves may learn the secrets of Sorcery and possess the tools to truly manipulate the masses. Through faith and fire a Bucoli is tested and through this faith they are made whole in front of the whole assembly. Do you have what it takes to step into the shoes of a Bucoli? Can you climb to the top and make a name for yourself? Find out how dark the world around you can be as you play a Bucoli.<br/><br/>"}, "136633": {"rpgdesigner": ["Mykal Lakim", "Raquel Looker"], "rpgitemversion": ["PDF Version 2.0"], "statistics": [], "name": "Lilliana Sourcebook", "rpgartist": ["Mykal Lakim"], "rpgproducer": ["Mykal Lakim", "Raquel Looker"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1536531.png", "usersrated": "0", "average": "0", "rpggenre": ["Fantasy (Modern Urban Fantasy)", "Horror (Supernatural)", "Modern"], "rpgpublisher": ["Dark Phoenix Publishing"], "rpg": ["Vampire: Undeath"], "rpgcategory": ["Sourcebook (rules/options to enhance play)"], "poll": [], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1536531_t.png", "description": "From publisher blurb:<br/><br/>Lilliana. Sexual hedonists, sex-pots, beautiful and seductive sirens, succubi, the list goes on and one to describe one of death&rsquo;s most beautifully created ladies. Most Lilliana have an ethical following that argues that pleasure is the only intrinsic good -that only things that are pleasurable are good. This ethical code is used as justification for their actions weighing things as what will bring them the most pleasure or pain. To put it plain, the Lilliana try to maximize their pleasure in all things to get the most out of it.<br/><br/>In living a hedonistic life, the Lilliana can expect to seek out pleasures in order to attain a state of tranquility and freedom from fear as well as an absence of pain though their knowledge of the workings of the world and our desires. The combination and fulfillment of these? Happiness and bliss. Lilliana teach their trinity of knowledge, friendship and living a life in pursuit of pleasure, however, there are limits that each Maker bestows upon their Liberi. By having too much sex, there is the natural fear that one could become dissatisfied with their partner, by overeating, one could lose a taste for their food. Heeding these warnings, the Lilliana teach that living a life in pursuit of pleasure is only good with a balance in it.<br/><br/>"}, "136634": {"poll": [], "name": "Alien Shooter 2: Reloaded", "videogamemode": ["Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["Windows Downloadable edition"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1575250.jpg", "videogameseries": ["Alien Shooter"], "videogametheme": ["Aliens"], "usersrated": "1", "videogamedeveloper": ["Sigma Team Inc."], "videogamegenre": ["Shooter"], "videogameplatform": ["Windows"], "average": "5", "statistics": [], "videogamepublisher": ["Sigma Team Inc."], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1575250_t.jpg", "description": "Alien Shooter 2 - Reloaded is a modified version of the Alien Shooter 2 game.

Size of the full version installation file was reduced to 300 Mb, compared to 1Gb of the original Alien Shooter 2. Large installation file prevented users with slow connection from buying and downloading the game.<br/>2. Player upgrade parameters simplified. Now you don't need to develop separate skills for each weapon type, so you'll be able to complete the game using all the weapon types featured in it.<br/>3. Two new missions added. Now the game features 17 full levels.<br/>4. New individual shooting mode added - Gun Stand. You will use powerful military equipment to eliminate advancing enemy troops. As the game goes on, you will upgrade your weapon in different ways, and the right choice will let you win the battle!<br/><br/>Source: The Publisher Website.<br/><br/>"}, "136635": {"rpgdesigner": ["Leon Chang", "Charlie McElvy"], "rpg": ["Mutants & Masterminds (3rd Edition)"], "poll": [], "name": "Samaritan", "rpgartist": ["Sean Izaakse"], "rpgproducer": ["Charlie McElvy"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1536532.png", "usersrated": "0", "rpgitemversion": ["PDF version"], "rpgsetting": ["WatchGuard"], "average": "0", "statistics": [], "rpggenre": ["Action / Adventure (Superheroes)"], "rpgpublisher": ["Xion Studios"], "rpgcategory": ["Sourcebook (rules/options to enhance play)"], "rpgseries": ["Super-Powered by M&M", "WatchGuard Solo"], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1536532_t.png", "description": "From publisher blurb:<br/><br/>Introducing the SAMARITAN!

The catch is that if an orb is not connected back to your power supply, via a chain of your own orbs, then it loses power and cannot be moved again until power is restored to it.<br/><br/>Orbs move by being swapped with one of your opponent's orbs or into an empty spot on the grid. You defeat your opponent by completely disconnecting their orbs from their power supply, or forcing them to disconnect their last connected orb.<br/><br/>The resulting &quot;push-pull&quot; dynamic, where you will sometimes be disconnecting your own pieces and sometimes be reconnecting your pieces, is visualized perfectly on the screen with animations and lightning effects. You can literally see the balance of power shifting back and forth.<br/><br/>Your challenge in this compelling puzzler is to find a solution to each level, collecting light bulbs in order to earn new power-ups along the way (these will also be available via In App Purchase).

The keyboard had soft tactile feedback and rhomboid-shaped function keys across the top. The 520ST was an all-in-one unit, similar to earlier home computers like the Commodore 64. By the time the 520ST reached the market, however, consumers demanded a keyboard with cursor keys and a numeric keypad. For this reason, the 520ST ended up significantly larger than previous popular all-in-one machines like the Commodore 64.<br/><br/>The 520ST used an external &quot;brick&quot; power supply, floppy disk, monitor and mouse. Even basic system setups thus suffered from cable spaghetti, a problem future versions would address to one degree or another. Early 520ST owners became accustomed to the &quot;Atari Twist&quot; and the &quot;Atari Drop&quot; service procedures[citation needed].

The machine was generally similar to the earlier 520ST, but moved the power supply and a double-sided floppy drive into the rear of the housing of the computer, as opposed to being external. This added to the size of the machine, but reduced cable clutter in the back. However, the joystick/mouse ports, formerly on the right side of the machine where the disk now sat, had to be moved to an awkward location in a cramped niche underneath the keyboard.<br/><br/>The 1040ST was the first personal computer shipped with a base RAM configuration of 1 MB. When the list price was reduced to $999 in the U.S. it appeared on the cover of BYTE in March 1986 as the first computer to break the $1000/megabyte price barrier. However, the ST remained generally the same internally over the majority of its several-year lifespan. The choice of model numbers was inherited from the model numbers of the XE series of the Atari 8-bit family of computers. A limited number of 1040STFs shipped with a single-sided floppy drive.<br/><br/>The same basic design was also used for a cut-down version, the 512 kB 520STFM, which replaced the earlier 520ST models in the market.

However, the most well-known version of the game is Super Star Trek, written in BASIC and published in David Ahl's BASIC Computer Games.  After the release of BASIC Computer Games, the game was widely copied to home computers in the late '70s.  The game has been moderately influential, inspiring amongst others Star Raiders and Star Fleet I: The War Begins.<br/><br/>The game consists of the player, in control of the starship Enterprise, hunting down Klingon ships randomly scattered throughout the galaxy.  All the Klingon ships must be eliminated by a certain stardate.  The Enterprise has Phasors and Photon Torpedos as weapons, as well as a number of other thematically appropriate capabilities to help achieve this end.  The galaxy is composed of an 8x8 grid of quadrants and in addition to Klingon ships contains stars and also friendly starbases, where the Enterprise can be repaired and refueled.  Each quadrant is composed of an 8x8 (in most but not all games) set of sectors, in which the Enterprise, Klingon ships, stars, and starbases are represented spatially in relation to each other.<br/><br/>"}, "136835": {"poll": [], "name": "Mary-Kate and Ashley: Winners Circle", "videogamemode": ["Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["North American Game Boy Color edition"], "average": "0", "videogametheme": ["Sports - Horse Riding"], "usersrated": "0", "videogamedeveloper": ["M4 Ltd"], "videogamegenre": ["Sports"], "videogameplatform": ["Game Boy Color"], "statistics": [], "videogamepublisher": ["Acclaim Entertainment Inc."], "description": "User Summary<br/><br/>A game with Mary-Kate and Ashley Olson riding horses, competing in tournaments and completing challenges.

The new redesigned version of the 2600, unofficially referred to as the 2600 Jr., featured a smaller cost-reduced form factor with a modernized Atari 7800-like appearance. The redesigned 2600 was advertised as a budget gaming system (under $50) that had the ability to run a large collection of classic games. With its introduction came a resurgence in software development both from Atari Corp. and from a few third parties (including Activision, Absolute Entertainment, Froggo, Epyx, and Exus). The Atari 2600 continued to sell in the USA and Europe until 1991, and in Asia until the early 1990s. Its final Atari-licensed release was KLAX in 1990.

This simple design gave smooth linear control and was highly reliable. The production controllers were quite different and a great disappointment to the electrical and software development teams. The design of the analog joystick, which used a weak rubber boot rather than springs to provide centering, proved to be ungainly and unreliable. They quickly became the Achilles' heel of the system because of their combination of an overly complex mechanical design with a very low-cost internal flex circuit system. Another major flaw of the controllers was that the design did not translate into a linear acceleration from the center through the arc of the stick travel. The controllers did, however, include a pause button, a unique feature at the time.

It was released on November 2013 in Japan and February 2014 in Europe and North America. The game is a direct sequel to Final Fantasy XIII-2, concludes the storyline of Final Fantasy XIII, and forms part of the Fabula Nova Crystallis subseries. Lightning Returns employs a highly revamped version of the gameplay system from the previous two games, with an action-oriented battle system, the ability to customize the player character's outfits, and a time limit the player must extend by completing story missions and sidequests.<br/><br/>The story takes place five hundred years after the previous game's ending. Lightning, the main protagonist of the first game and a key character in the second, awakes from a self-imposed hibernation thirteen days before the world's end, and is chosen by the deity Bhunivelze to save the people of the dying world, including former friends and allies who have developed heavy emotional burdens. As she travels, she learns the full truth behind both the world's fate and Bhunivelze's true agenda.<br/><br/>Development of the game started in May 2012, shortly after the release of XIII-2's final piece of DLC, and was unveiled at a special 25th Anniversary Event for the Final Fantasy series in September that year. Most of the previous games' key creative minds and developers returned, and it was developed by Square Enix's First Production Department, with developer tri-Ace helping with the graphics. The development team wanted the game to bring a conclusive end to the story of both Lightning and the XIII universe, and to address criticisms leveled against the last two games. The game has received mixed reviews in both Japan and Western territories: while the main praise went to the game's battle system, opinions were more mixed for the graphics, time limit and other aspects of gameplay, while the story and characters were criticized for being weak and poorly developed.<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;Lightning Returns: Final Fantasy XIII&quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "136849": {"poll": [], "name": "Vertigo", "videogamemode": ["Local Multiplayer", "Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["English/European Wii edition", "North American Wii edition"], "average": "0", "videogametheme": ["Science Fiction"], "usersrated": "0", "videogamedeveloper": ["Icon Games Entertainment"], "videogamegenre": ["Puzzle", "Racing"], "videogameplatform": ["Wii"], "statistics": [], "videogamepublisher": ["Playlogic Entertainment"], "description": "Back of the Box<br/><br/>Vertigo is a high-rolling, adrenalin-fuelled combination of puzzle solving, precision control and futuristic racing.<br/><br/>- 4 multiplayer modes: Time Trial, Xorb Ball, Death Match and Xorb bowling.<br/>- 48 challenging tracks across 9 different environments.<br/>- Wii Balance Board compatible with unique gaming mode.<br/><br/>"}, "136850": {"statistics": [], "name": "Nintendo 3DS XL", "videogamehardwarecategory": ["Controller"], "usersrated": "1", "average": "7", "videogamehwmfg": ["Nintendo Co., Ltd."], "poll": [], "videogamehwversion": ["European Nintendo 3DS XL", "Japanese Nintendo 3DS XL", "North American 3DS XL", "TO BE DELETED", "TO BE DELETED", "TO BE DELETED", "TO BE DELETED", "TO BE DELETED", "TO BE DELETED", "TO BE DELETED", "TO BE DELETED"], "videogamehardware": ["Nintendo 3DS"], "description": "As with the Nintendo DSi XL, the 3DS XL features larger screens and longer battery life than the original 3DS.

Competing machines such as the Apple II, Commodore VIC-20, the Commodore 64, the Atari 400, and the Atari 800 were designed around a combination of the much cheaper MOS 6502, itself essentially an enhanced clone of the Motorola 6800.<br/><br/>The CoCo lacked some of the graphics and sound capabilities of other home computers, but made up for it in computing power and ease of programming in BASIC.

The Austrian army is slightly weaker, but is aided by fearsome light infantry units and in later scenarios are led by such capable commanders as Daun and Loudon.<br/> As Prussia can you humble the Austrians and make your kingdom a first-class power? As Austria can you weather the Prussian storm and halt the first steps towards decline? The enemy approaches, the sound of cannon deafens, men shout commands, smoke fills the air. You must HOLD THE LINE!<br/><br/>For each scenario each player receives a number of command points to activate the units in his army for movement, close assault, and fire combat.  Each side also receives a random number of command points for the same, but never knowing how many creating a battle field chaos that makes the game highly replayable.

PS1's user base ranges from leading airlines, NASA research centers, universities, to pilots of all categories who use PS1 during their transition training to &quot;glass&quot; or, regularly, at home, as a refresher. Also, students who want to be prepared for airline interviews and sim checks, instructors who &quot;test-fly&quot; new scenarios on the PC before going into the full-flight sims, maintenance specialists, Human Factors labs, avionics designers, flight dispatchers, air traffic controllers and many other aviation professionals rank among PS1's user base since its introduction in 1997.<br/><br/>The PS1 concept resembles that of a full-flight simulator rather than that of a conventional &quot;one-topic-at-a-time&quot; CBT station. Whether you're practising IFR procedures using the FMC and EFIS tools, or playing &quot;what if&quot; with the hydraulics, electrics, pneumatics, etc., all system simulations are permanently interacting with each other and may develop into enormously complex situations.<br/><br/>- Complete Autopilot / Flight Director mode logic and accurate Thrust Management System.     <br/>- Simulation of the entire 744 FMC: HOLD, VNAV, FORECAST, OFFPATH DES, FIX INFO, All INIT/REF pages, LEGS, RTE DATA, WINDS, ROUTE 1 &amp; 2, DEP/ARR, PROGRESS, etc. All pages are fully functioning.  <br/>- IFR Training on &ldquo;glass&rdquo;. All EFIS symbols are being generated, e. g. Trend Vector, Energy Management Circles, Offset Route, Fix Info etc., incl. Failure Flags. <br/>- Highly accurate aerodynamics simulation. Exact 744 pitch/power/path and fuel flow ratios etc.<br/>- Precise and highly detailed Systems Simulations: Electrical, Hydraulics, Fire &amp; Ice Protection, Gear &amp; Flight Controls incl. alternate controls, Doors, EEC, IRS incl. alignment simulation and drift errors, Fuel System Management, Pneumatics, etc.<br/>- Random or user defined malfunction scenarios.<br/>- Fully functioning EICAS message logic with hundreds of alert, memo &amp; status messages.<br/>- Secondary EICAS: All Synoptics &amp; Displays.<br/>- Video recorder/player: Training videos may be created!

External traffic can be simulated to demonstrate the various aural and visual TCAS alerts and system logic.<br/>- GPWS (Ground Proximity Warning System).<br/>- The simulator can be switched to specific airline configurations.

Three years of research result in highly sophisticated flight equations based on true inertia system, true airflow calculations, detailed calculations of forces even down to tyre deformations, that warrant an astonishingly realistic behaviour of the airplane, both in ground and airborne handling. Revised atmosphere and grossly enhanced weather effects like wind turbulence, rain, snow as well as runway surface calculation allow realistic ground handling in steady or gusty crosswind, taking into account dry, wet, snowy or icy runways. Explore the edges of the airplane envelope ... Want to see, whether you can loop or roll your favourite airliner? Good luck! Stress calculations will give you an idea when your aircraft disintegrates in the air - however, aircraft will maintain flyable, but you will need to deal with asymmetric lift, asymmetric drag, flamed out engines and much more, if you overstress the airframe, as you may loose parts of your wings, slats, flaps, tailplane or cause engine failures. Touch down hard, and experience the skidding experience with a partly collapsed gear.<br/><br/>Aircraft Abstraction layer, short AAL, the technology behind the new flight model, makes flying easy, as airplanes are designed to be flown by average pilots, and teaches the right, real world handling techniques used by real world pilots. Be ahead of your airplane, that's the key to success in flying your aircraft - the inertia of the plane now forces you to think ahead of your airplane, just as real aircraft do.<br/><br/>And of course, who wants to fly the famous Dumbo will be able to do so, too.<br/><br/>AS2 features all systems, that the handling pilot will have to deal with, including fully featured Autopilot and Main Control Panel (MCP), Flight Management Computer (FMS), Thrust Computer, Ground Proximity Warning System (GPWS), Traffic and Collision Avoidance System (TCAS) and many more systems. The handling Pilot will be relieved from handling other systems by the virtual first officer, who therefore takes care your workload as flying pilot will not become critical - as in the real plane.<br/><br/>Aural Alarms (e.g. GPWS, TCAS, configuration alarms), voice communication with the first officer and improved sounds for touch down, stall warning and other aircraft related sounds have been implemented using real world sounds.<br/><br/>AS2 comes with a 300 pages manual in printed form (150 pages thereof being reproductions of Aerad Airport and ILS charts), teaching all relevant methods of handling an airplane, not only in windless situations, but crosswind, gusty winds, windshear and all levels of turbulences, that make an ILS approach in clouds really demanding. In addition three reproductions of Aerad enroute charts covering Europe and North Atlantic come with AS2, as well as laminated checklists for the MD-83, MD-88 and B744.<br/><br/>AS2 comes as a stand alone package with an easy installation under DOS and Win95/98/ME.<br/><br/>Source: The Publisher Website.<br/><br/>"}, "136918": {"videogame": ["AV8B Harrier Assault", "Fighter Wing"], "poll": [], "name": "Combat Aces", "videogamemode": ["Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["North American DOS/Windows edition"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1540918.jpg", "videogametheme": ["War - Modern"], "usersrated": "0", "videogamedeveloper": ["Gemsoft Corporation", "Simis Limited"], "videogamegenre": ["Flight Simulator", "Strategy"], "videogameplatform": ["DOS", "Windows"], "average": "0", "statistics": [], "videogamepublisher": ["Expert Software"], "videogamecompilation": ["AV8B Harrier Assault", "Fighter Wing"], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1540918_t.jpg", "description": "User Summary<br/><br/>A two game combat flight simulator compilation CD.<br/><br/>"}, "136919": {"videogame": ["1942, The Pacific Air War", "Falcon 3.0", "Fleet Defender", "Gunship 2000"], "poll": [], "name": "Conquer the Skies", "videogamemode": ["Network Multiplayer", "Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["North American DOS edition"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic963204.jpg", "videogametheme": ["War - Modern", "War - World War II"], "usersrated": "0", "videogamedeveloper": ["MicroProse", "Spectrum Holobyte"], "videogamegenre": ["Flight Simulator", "Real Time Strategy"], "videogameplatform": ["DOS"], "average": "0", "statistics": [], "videogamepublisher": ["MicroProse"], "videogamecompilation": ["1942, The Pacific Air War", "Falcon 3.0", "Fleet Defender", "Gunship 2000"], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic963204_t.jpg", "description": "User Summary<br/><br/>A compilation of four flight simulators.<br/><br/>"}, "136920": {"poll": [], "name": "Jet Stream", "videogamemode": ["Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["Japanese DOS edition", "Japanese PC-9801 edition"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1540855.jpg", "videogameseries": ["Jet Stream"], "videogametheme": ["Flight"], "usersrated": "0", "videogamedeveloper": ["Aqua System"], "videogamegenre": ["Flight Simulator"], "videogameplatform": ["DOS", "PC-9801"], "average": "0", "statistics": [], "videogamepublisher": ["Aqua System"], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1540855_t.jpg", "description": "User Summary<br/><br/>A Japanese civil flight simulator.

If their pawn is on a ascending slope space at the beginning of their turn, they roll only one die. They move their pawn according to the die roll. <br/>If it lands on a grey space, nothing happens. If it lands on a green space, an action card is drawn and the action performed (move pawn backwards/forwards a certain number of spaces, lose a turn etc.). <br/>If it lands on a yellow space, a question card is drawn and the active player has to answer a biathlon-related question. If they succeed, their pawn advances five spaces. If they fail, they go back five spaces.<br/>If the pawn lands on a blue space, they have to go back to start.<br/>If a player rolls the same number on both dice, they gain a fan token, which grants them extra movement in round three.<br/>Since the game is about biathlon, there is also a shooting exercise that takes place after rounds one and two: Players have to hit a target with a wooden marble, using a wooden catapult. Generally, each player has five shots per round to hit the five targets, but shooting cards may allow them to reload.

Worthington is also offering the Killiecrankie scenario free to download. The game closely aligns with the Hold the Line system, but includes rules for Highland charges, Scottish militia, and of course the feared Highland clan units.<br/><br/>James II lost his throne in 1689, but he and his supporters did not give the fight to reclaim his rights and titles. From 1689 to 1745 no less than four major Jacobite rebellions broke out in the Scottish highlands, often with limited aid from France and Spain. The battles were the last hurrah for a dying way of war. The Highlanders relied on assault tactics, in particular the feared Highland charge. The Loyalists, made up of British regulars and Scottish militia, used the linear tactics of the day, including volley fire, artillery barrages, and bayonets. For a time the Highlanders seemed to be tactically superior until the shattering defeat at Culloden, a battle that proved the ultimate superiority of musket and artillery fire over the claymore.<br/><br/>As the Jacobites can you reclaim the throne for the Stuart dynasty? As the Loyalists can you protect the Hanoverian succession and deal a final death blow to absolutism in Britain? Across the way the bagpipes can be heard.
