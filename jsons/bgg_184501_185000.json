Next the veteran Australian 7th Infantry Division, the heroes of Tobruk, plunged into the jungles and finally stopped the Japanese attacks. While Australian soldiers fought on despite rampant malaria, Japanese troops hauled artillery shells over the mountains by hand and resorted to eating Australian prisoners of war.

Characters are defined by a process that attempts to emphasize character development over statistics generation.  First, players define a cultural background which includes race.  Next, the player selects one or more quirks, which generally are handicaps.  Players determine past experience by spending a pool of points.  Then characters generate statistics, add possessions, and begin the game.  Attributes include Brawn, Dexterity, Agility, Perception, Spirit, and Reason.  Each Attribute is divided into six areas, or skills.  For example, Perception includes Reaction, Alertness, Missile Combat, Tracking, Searching, and Arcane Magic.<br/><br/>Action resolution is dependent upon the type of action being attempted--they are categorized as either Trivial, Minor, or Major.  Trivial or Minor actions are typically resolved narrative action and with playing cards, respectively.  In general, to resolve major actions a Talent Level is derived from Talent and Flairs (as applicable).  A Challenge Level is determined from the action description.  The Talent Level and the Challenge Level are added together and increased by one; a pool of D6 equal to this score is rolled and several of the lowest and highest are removed until one remains; the remaining die is the result.  Challenge Level removals come from the highest scores; Talent Level removals come from the lowest scores.  Rolls of 1-3 fail, while 4-6 succeed.  The mechanism for removing dice from the high and low ends means that middle results (basic failure or basic success) are far more likely than miserable failure or superior success.<br/><br/>For example, for an action with a Talent Level of 3 and a Challenge Level of 4, a player would roll 3+4+1 d6, then discard the 3 lowest results, then discard the 4 highest results, then take the remaining result and use it as the outcome.<br/><br/>Characters gain Experience Points and then spend them to increase Talents.  The book also contains a chapter on Actions, Equipment, Adventuring, Magic, Monsters, and Economy.

Attributes gain a numeric rating from a pool of 7 points.  Each number represents a d6, giving a player three dice pools in the various Attributes.  Each player will next generate three characters called Personas.  These Personas will all use (re-use) the same Attributes block.  The Personas should match the various roles the GM has allocated for the campaign--remember, the goal is to replicate a zombie movie plot and the GM will thus determine which people in the movie will be represented by the players' Personas.<br/><br/>The action resolution mechanic involves determining which Attribute will determine success in a given situation.  ZIP indicates reaction time, running, dodging, and fast acting.  WHOMP indicates combat ability and tasks that require only raw muscle.  GUTS is how likely you are to avoid freezing in fear, and how resistant you are to the zombie plague.  In combat, characters will use their WHOMP Attribute and roll a pool of dice equal to that attribute's rating.  Rolls of 5 and 6 indicate success--if the total of success rolls equals or exceeds the zombie's GUTS roll then the character has damaged the zombie.  Characters can disperse their WHOMP dice pool into multiple attacks.  Characters must state on every attack they are aiming for the head or they are assumed to be making a body shot, which is ineffective even if successful.<br/><br/>Characters who are wounded make a GUTS roll to determine if they can continue to the end of the scene (failure means they don't) when they make another GUTS roll to avoid a permanent loss of GUTS and possible undeath.  Zombies have the same Attributes as characters except CHUNKS replaces GUTS--functionally, they are about the same.<br/><br/>Weapons are of several types:  Sorta Wimpy, Medium, Large, and Wicked.

All rule design effort was put on allowing the player to adapt the game to any different model basing and scales.. However, we do recommend certain model sizes for units on the rules, but others could be used without compromising playability. Geometry dependence has been avoided as much as possible.<br/><br/>The number of miniatures that is necessary to represent a unit is subject to the sole discretion of the Army Collector, it is up to everyone to decide how many models will be enough to identify our troops. Even so, we suggest certain number in the rules, but just for guidance.<br/><br/>Tercios is a large scale wargame, since each unit in the game represents huge formations that often comprised more than a thousand men. This is why it is a game with more abstraction than others, because at this scale of war reenactment, individual soldier actions has no consecuences, it matters as a whole..<br/><br/>The gameplay is based upon orders execution, that are deployed at a planning phase. Command cards are used (there are 5 different cards), that are placed face down next to our units, and prepare our troops for different tasks: to run, to shoot, charge the enemy or resist stoically.<br/><br/>Units activation is alternated between players. The very command cards allow us to keep track of which units have been activated. The fact that the turns are not complete for a single player, but alternated between the two players, make the game a fluid dynamic experience. Once all the command cards have been executed, the turn will be finished and we will be ready to start a new one.<br/><br/>Cards also allow us to react, under certain circumstances, to enemy activity, what makes commands a complex tactical resource.. Deepening in the mastering of good decisions during the planning phase and managing the unexpected is a challenge for the player; reflective strategic fund is stimulated, what makes the experience very intuitive and agile..<br/><br/>Not knowing what cards your opponent has set and choosing the order of activation for your units, makes a very realistic simulation of the uncertainties of a real battle and delivers an increasing thrill, as the turns pass by..<br/><br/>As usual in wargames, actions are resolved by rolling dices. Tercios proposes a very simple system using six-sided dice; no need to do complex calculations, or having to learn a host of special rules. For a player with minimum experience (or without) it will be a matter of minutes to become familiar with the system.<br/><br/>"}, "184567": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2991485.jpg", "poll": {}, "boardgamedesigner": {"85522": {"name": "Matthew Morris"}}, "statistics": {}, "yearpublished": "2016", "maxplayers": "4", "boardgameartist": {"52104": "Andres Canals"}, "boardgamepublisher": {"30524": {"name": "Madbeard Games"}}, "maxplaytime": "100", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2991485_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "60", "boardgamecategory": {"1046": {"name": "Fighting"}}, "description": "Wasteland Justice is a tactical board game for 2-4 players.

All characters are assumed to have some degree of skill in freerunning.  The first half of the rules establish the setting.  All survivors have banded into Tribes that live in the upper floors of skyscrapers.  The more powerful the Tribe, the higher the floor they occupy.  Lower floors are penetrated by zombies, upper floors become progressively safer the higher they are.  Unfortunately for the survivors, all remaining supplies are found down at ground level, out in the urban sprawl.  This necessitates frequent excursions of freerunning to allow survival.  Most zobmies--most--are typical zombies.  Some are worse.  The goal of players is to keep their characters alive another day and hopefully gather some supplies in the process.<br/><br/>Characters have several Characteristics, including Grace, Virtues (Haste, Cunning, Passion), Tags (brief narrative descriptions), Glory, Doom, and Loot.  Characters begin with three points of Grace, variable points in Virtues (an array of 2, 1, 0), a couple tags, and zero points in Glory, Doom, and Loot.  No two characters can share the same distribution of Virtues.<br/><br/>Characters also belong to a Tribe (roughly analogous to an adventuring party in a traditional fantasy RPG).  Tribes have several stats, including Height, Status, and Population.  Height begins at one--not good, Status at zero, and Population at 50.<br/><br/>During the Day, the game proceeds as a narrative action largely among characters.  Characters assume the narrative event by having a character embody one of their virtues.  If more than one character wants the focus, a die mechanic selects a winner.  Upon completing the narrative and returning home, dice are used to determine Loot points which contribute to Tribal Status, Population Growth, and Height.<br/><br/>During the Night, the GM controls the game using Doom dice which lead to zombie activity.<br/><br/>"}, "184585": {"rpgitemversion": {"285721": "HTML Version"}, "poll": {}, "name": "Age of the Dead", "rpgproducer": {"3": "(Uncredited)"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2677505.jpg", "usersrated": "0", "average": "0", "statistics": {}, "rpg": {"28330": "Age of the Dead"}, "rpgcategory": {"2107": "Campaign Setting (game world)"}, "rpggenre": {"158": "Horror"}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2677505_t.jpg", "description": "User Summary:<br/><br/>Age of the Dead is a rules-light zombie-themed roleplaying game.

The game transpires in Mountain High which, super powers aside, is much like any high school in America.<br/><br/>Characters have four major categories of Traits:  Cliques, Comments, Angst, and Drama.  Cliques are just like typical high school cliques and will define the social crowd the player likes to hang out with.  Comments are narrative tags that help clarify the character's standing within the Clique, and one of the Comments will designate a &quot;Power&quot; which is the character's special ability or mutation.  Angst summarizes the character's dramatic issues at the moment--&quot;Acting on Angst in immature and petty ways is the central mechanic of the game.&quot;  Drama is a resource through which characters can maximize their success.<br/><br/>Example Cliques are given:  Jocks, Rebels, Princesses, Brains, and Basketcases.  Each will have positive and negative comments.  For example, Princesses may have these comments &quot;Popular&quot;, &quot;Natural Leader&quot;, &quot;Manipulative&quot;, and &quot;Emotionally Fragile.&quot;<br/><br/>Angst should be phrased in such a way as to introduce a problem or conflict which will provide the story seed for a game session.

The game does not include lengthy lists of powers--players should design their own using the three parameters provided in the rules--simplicity, impermanent, and not cosmic.<br/><br/>When conflict occurs, it can be built with narrative until a power is used.  Then a die roll will determine the outcome.  Drama points can be spent to enlarge the dice pool to provide better outcomes.

Each of these is defined with a narrative tag and at least one of them must express support or devotion to the status quo.  Punks also have three details (skills, quirks, personality, or whatever).  Each Punk must also identify one or more signature punk songs.  Each character should have about the same number of songs that aggregate to about the same play length, and no two characters should share a signature song.  All of these songs need to be placed on a single device that can randomly shuffle and play them continuously.  It is The Man's responsibility to make sure the punk music keeps playing in a random arrangement.<br/><br/>All Punk sessions begin with all the Punks in a bar.  Characters each get five Anarchy tokens; The Man gets ten Authority Tokens.  Narrative action then begins.  The Man will present a Threat and the Punks must respond.

If desired, a Punk may spend an Anarchy token to gain success.  When a Punk spends his or her last Anarchy token, however, they Fade Out.  Likewise, The Man may spend an Authority token to enforce failure.<br/><br/>As the Punk music soundtrack plays during a conflict, the character who is associated with the current song, as their signature song, gets to describe narrative success without spending an Anarchy token.<br/><br/>"}, "184596": {"poll": {}, "name": "Let's Race Home!", "playingtime": "0", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": {"2035": "Roll / Spin and Move"}, "yearpublished": "2013", "usersrated": "0", "maxplayers": "2", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2789809_t.jpg", "average": "0", "statistics": {}, "boardgamepublisher": {"30617": {"name": "Redan Publishing Ltd."}}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2789809.jpg", "boardgameversion": {"285733": "First edition"}, "maxplaytime": "0", "boardgamecategory": {"1089": {"name": "Animals"}}, "age": "0", "minplaytime": "0", "description": "Let's Race Home is a roll-and-move game with a Puppy in My Pocket theme.

This is not, however, a simple system.  Action resolution relies upon clearly defined mechanics which should support the interpretation of descriptions by group consensus.  Each action generally contrasts the character's &quot;Determining Focus&quot; against the situation's &quot;Choice Density&quot;, in other words--how important is the choice to the character, and how difficult is it to resolve?<br/><br/>The rules give a list of possible modifiers based on narrative elements impinging upon the situation.  These all add or subtract to a base number in increments of 5 (or 3, if a &quot;less gritty&quot; campaign is desired).  The composite score is then compared to a &quot;Success Table&quot; ranging from -12 to +22; the entry on the table determines the degree and type of failure or success.  Because this mechanism is complex and time-consuming, an &quot;evil short cut&quot; is provided that eliminates the group consensus in favor of GM fiat (even so, the short cut is not a necessarily simple process).<br/><br/>The remainder of the rules concern processes that allocate character attention and ability, methods for calculating strategic benefit, and gaining and spending resources (generally speaking, these are abstract concepts like Karma).  These aspects have, for a narrative game, an atypical focus on math and bookkeeping.  Character creation is considered in great detail.

In the Campaign Game, the intermittent battles utilize the core rules of the skirmish game.<br/><br/>Two types of Campaigns are detailed--Map Based or Narrative Based.  A Map Based campaign is executed on a hex map or even a real-world road map of the USA.  Campaign goals include controlling area or winning towns.  A special section of Overland Travel rules details how characters participate in Map Based campaigns.  In Narrative Based campaigns The Sheriff creates a branching narrative story in which characters participate.  Depending upon player choice, the campaign develops along narrative lines with each intermittent battle determining the future possibilities.  Narrative Based campaigns user few rules and generally are simpler to execute.<br/><br/>During a campaign game, characters suffer wounds and (hopefully) recover from them.  Thus, characters may enter the next battle with existing damage (or may not be able to participate at all).  Characters also advance by gaining Improvement Points and money--these are awarded to the Posse and then divided among the characters.  Improvement Points are spent to gain trait improvements; money is spent to gain better weapons, armor, and equipment.

Characteristics may be things like Demographics (name, gender, age, race), Traits (intelligence, dexterity), Backgrounds (where you've been, what you've done), or Abilities (things you've learned how to do).  Characteristics are not given numeric scores but whenever an action is attempted that requires resolution you will add up how many Traits can help you with the task and subtract out any Traits that would hinder you.  This will give you a raw score that can be compared against a target number established by the GM to determine whether or not the character can perform the task successfully.<br/><br/>Characters also begin with 13 Luck Points which are represented by some physical object, such as pebbles or beads.  An any action, a player may spend one or two Luck Points (discarding the objects) to gain adds to the action score.  When starting a new adventure, characters gain 2 Luck Points and also gain 2 Luck Points every hour of play.<br/><br/>However, after each adventure remaining Luck Points may be spent to buy additional Traits, Backgrounds, or Abilities.  It is permissible to gain the same Characteristic two or three times (assuming this would be logical), increasing performance.  Characteristics may not be lost unless the GM allows it through a narrative event.<br/><br/>Tasks will have a difficulty established by the GM, from 0 (everyday tasks) to 10 (slay a dragon, cure cancer).  Usually these will fall into the 0, 1, 2, 4, 7, 10 array.  Actions against another person will have a target difficulty established by their characteristics.

There is also an Appendix.  The game attempts to adapt the Dick Tracy comic strip to a roleplaying game.<br/><br/>Characters are defined by an initial Concept, upon which are added Attributes, Skills, Negative Traits, and Positive Traits.  The Concept is a narrative element.  Attributes are Mental (Intelligence, Perception, Willpower, Charm) or Physical (Strength, Health, Ability, Appearance).  Every character has every Attribute but their score (1-5) in each will vary.  Scores are generated randomly by using 3d6 on a table that yields an array of values.  Skills are learned abilities and also are ranked with score (1-5).  Skill points are purchased from a pool that is derived from Attributes and Age.<br/><br/>Characters also get 6 Base Option Points which may be spent to customize the character even further.  Characters must purchase any Positive Traits with these Option Points, but Negative Traits, when selected, give the character Option Points.  Once created, characters are equipped.<br/><br/>When characters attempt difficult tasks, the GM will assign a Target Number for the task (7, 9, 13, 16, 22).  The character then selects a relevant Attribute and any Skill that may help.  The Attribute is added to the Skill and 2d6 are added, yielding a result of 3 - 22.  If the result exceeds the Target Number the character is successful.  Opposed actions, such as combat, have a Target Number that is determined by the opponent's Attributes and Skills.<br/><br/>The remaining rules clarify a wide variety of situations and give much advice on how to run a campaign, an adventure, and an encounter.

Player&rsquo;s are free to consider any phase optional but phases go in order:<br/><br/>1. Playing a card: The player may play a card from their hand beneath any of the 6 Multiverse Orders not yet controlled, stacking the cards vertically in a column.<br/><br/>2. Activating a Special Ability: The player may now activate the Special Ability of any one card they have previously played to any Multiverse Order.<br/><br/>3. Drawing/Discarding a card: The player now draws back to a hand limit of 6 cards from either their Ship deck and/or from the Draw deck.<br/><br/>Control Phase:<br/>Once the die&rsquo;s value on a Multiverse Order card falls below zero, the die is removed and normal phases of a player&rsquo;s turn are halted.<br/><br/>The player who played a card to reach or pass the Threshold Value is now the Attacking Player. They add up all Attack Strengths of their cards in that Multiverse Order&rsquo;s column, including any Attack markers and any additional Ship bonuses. The Attacking Player then announces their total Attack Strength.<br/><br/>The opposing player, now the Defending Player, may:<br/><br/>A.

If any Daemon Prince cards are drawn, they are set aside and will be shuffled back into the deck after the player chooses the three they want (dealing out replacement cards to Society Row). The player also begins the game with 10 copper pieces (CP). These starting cards will not have their powers activated during the Game Setup.<br/><br/>Play:<br/>A game turn consists of three phases:<br/><br/>Phase 1A. The player may purchase 1 card from Society Row and place in the Royal Court OR they may skip this phase and go to Phase 1B.<br/><br/>If the player purchases a card, any cards to the left of the gap slide to the right and a new card is drawn and placed in Society Row.<br/><br/>Cards will be purchased during the game from this row in an auction format.<br/><br/>Phase 1B. If the player does not wish to purchase any cards, the rightmost, non-Daemon Prince card is discarded and all remaining cards slide to the right and a new card is drawn and placed in Society Row. The player then receives 1CP and an additional 1CP for each Tax Collector in the Royal Court.<br/><br/>Phase 2. The player may now use the combined strength of their Generals to combat one Daemon Prince. If the player has 3 or more Generals in the Royal Court representing each of the three clan icons, the player adds +2 to the total strength to the Generals. To defeat one Daemon Prince during this phase, the total of all Generals&rsquo; strengths must be equal to or greater than the Daemon Prince&rsquo;s strength (as shown by the black number). The player may additionally pay CP to add 1CP/1 Strength to this total. The defeated Daemon Prince is placed to the left of the draw deck, any cards to the left of the gap slide to the right and a new card is drawn and placed in Society Row. The player gains VP as listed on the Daemon Prince card.<br/><br/>Phase 3. If Daemon Princes remain in Society Row, the rightmost non-Daemon Prince card is removed from the Society Row and placed in the Court of the Daemon Princes. All remaining cards slide to the right and a new card is drawn and placed in Society Row.<br/><br/>Game End:<br/>The game will end after Phase 3 if either:<br/>4 Daemon Princes are in the Society Row or all 9 Daemon Princes have been drawn.<br/><br/>The player then adds up the total VP gained during the game and additionally gains 1VP for every 3CP they have left. Each card in the Daemon Prince pile subtracts its listed VP from the player&rsquo;s VP score.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "1", "boardgameversion": {"285821": "First edition"}, "average": "6.67273", "name": "The Court of Xiang Chi", "playingtime": "20", "boardgamemechanic": {"2080": "Area Control / Area Influence"}, "age": "10", "usersrated": "11", "boardgamefamily": {"19564": "Solitaire Print and Play Contest"}}, "184657": {"rpgitemversion": {"285824": "PDF Version 2.0"}, "poll": {}, "name": "Discernment", "rpgproducer": {"13405": "Michael S.

I'm selective and have chosen to focus on the police as the protagonists and thus the player characters.

If the GM feels the characters are not ready for this challenge, he may wish to vary the abilities of the monsters or reduce their Fatigue and Endurance Characteristics to balance the encounters. If more than six characters participate or their abilities are too strong, the GM should add an extra monster or two.<br/><br/>"}, "184706": {"rpgitemversion": {"285930": "DOC Version"}, "poll": {}, "name": "DragonQuest Game Master's Screen", "rpgproducer": {"85773": "Eric A.

Demon armies have marched through their horrid portals on a genocidal campaign. As if the blood-thirsty monsters were not enough, a plague swept over the lands and claimed nearly every human left standing. Fate gave us control over the mysterious magical forces fueling the demon troops; those of us left may yet survive. Our civilization is ruined, our leaders are dead, and our hope is a fleeting dream.<br/><br/>Humanity needs a catalyst to change their course in this war. Join the tattered remains of our species in this long-form role playing game. Weave a rich story between a game master and a group of survivors in this alternate-present reality. Embody compelling characters with Catalyst&rsquo;s classless character system. Engage in tense battles with our unique card-based combat. Attempt to save the world or just live to see the next day.<br/><br/>WHAT MAKES CATALYST DIFFERENT?<br/><br/>Setting: Catalyst's demon invasion is set in our world and during our time. You are not fighting on another planet; you are battling in your country. Instead of trekking through the Elf Forest, you are fleeing Denver through the Rocky Mountains looking for safe haven. Your group's favorite bar becomes the resistance's meeting point and the ornate church down the street is the headquarters of a demon-worshiping cult. The magic brought by the demons blends with the technology of modern humanity; survive in your city however you can.<br/><br/>Gameplay: Combat is card-based. Everyone in Catalyst simultaneously chooses a card representing their action, creating tension at every moment. Do you lash out with your knife and leave yourself open? Do you try to dodge, knowing the enemy is near-death, but a crossbow bolt from a single demon will end your life? Do you cast a powerful spell at a foe, betting on your quicker ally stunning them with deft crowbar hit? Revel in correctly reading the mind of your opponent or think up an impromptu backup plan when your friend unexpectedly runs away.<br/><br/>Characters: Be the character you want. Catalyst has no classes or professions. You decide who your character was before the demon invasion and what they become. Save the world as an autistic drug dealer with divination magic, a wannabe action hero who can throw foes with their mind, or a smooth talking frat bro able to cloak himself in darkness.

Each character is presented on a Player Card.  The players then equip their characters by spending money from a pool to purchase relatively mundane items from table lists, and spellcasters either draw or select spell cards.  Game Cards then are drawn randomly from the deck as needed for the rules.  Game Cards in turn drive the action, encounters, and so forth--effectively creating the adventure and campaign as it plays out.<br/><br/>The game is driven by cards, of which there are four types.  Player Cards show characters, Monster Cards have several types of opponent, Game Cards drive the travel of the party, and Weapon Cards consist of equipment characters can use.  Specific room contents are generated randomly when the room is entered, using a die roll to determine general room contents and then either consulting a table or drawing an appropriate card for specific contents.

Fire Team: Red Eclipse covers the Cold War Gone HOT in West Germany in the late 1980's and early 1990's. Fire Team: Red Eclipse is designed and developed by Steve Overton with Jon Southard, designer of the original Fire Team game, consulting and graphic design by Shayan Logan<br/><br/>Fire Team: Red Eclipse covers the US and Soviet forces fight on geomorphic maps that are represented at about 50-meter hexes and 2 - 5-minute turns.<br/><br/>Fire Team: Red Eclipse brings together mechanics to represent the OODA Loop, training and experience of military organizations, Command and Control of tactical combat units, random impulses based on the capabilities of your leaders on the map, intuitive game play based on the units responding to game play as soldiers do in actual situations, and the ability to create random events such as happen in small unit actions.<br/><br/>Couple the OODA Loop with the training and experience of each nations organizations in the series to create a unique blend of Command and Control with organizational traits. Tactical Event Cards add additional options for play, Command Points give you a varying number of orders per impulse - determined by the quality and condition of the leaders you currently have in play on the map. As the overall leader in the game, you can do whatever you want. You just won't be able to do it all at the same time. If one of your Command Point chits is drawn, you will have between 1 and three orders to issue. Those orders range from firing at the enemy to repairing support weapons and everything in between. That's all great but which orders do you give 'RIGHT NOW'? Each of us has a different idea about what's the most important thing to do at any given moment.<br/><br/>Leaders play the pivotal role in the game by creating orders, directing fire, providing a movement bonus, and assisting in rallying of broken/disrupted units. The state of your leaders on the map determines how many orders they can give each impulse during the turn. The organization of the nationality you have determines the number of orders you may get in an impulse. The player who can utilize his leaders to the greatest effect will usually be the winner. Usually, because nothing is ever 100% certain in Kontact Now.<br/><br/>Weaponry has not been left out of the game. All weapons of the era are in the game. All weapons systems in the series have been created using the same formulas. This allows each unit - weapons system - to be created with it's own unique values in relation to the other weapons of that same weapons class over the past 70+ years and into the future. Armor penetration values are constant throughout the series as are armor defensive values; for all vehicles and helicopters. Each weapons class has been exhaustively researched to give you the best unit values to work with. You don't have to worry about the weapons and the systems. All you have to worry about is using them in a winning combination.<br/><br/>Fire Team: Red Eclipse will include Off-Map Artillery, night rules, engineer obstacles (mines, wire, bunkers, trenches), multi-level buildings, rubble, fires, roadblocks, helicopter, Close Air Support (CAS), Antitank Guided Missiles, Surface to Air Missiles, Man Portable Air Defense systems, with both high and low unit counter density scenarios, exiting the map,  all of varying degrees of complexity. Special rules governing helicopter and column movement activation, as well as snipers, medics, wounded and vehicles with multiple weapons systems.<br/><br/>Asymmetrical Victory Conditions combined with the Tactical Event Cards and concealment counters, random CAS attack packages, random size artillery missions, and Opportunity Fire adds a heavy layer of Fog of War to the system.<br/><br/>Because of the random chit draw for each impulse during a turn, the series is extremely solitaire friendly.<br/><br/>KN very much adheres to the chaos gaming method. This is not an &quot;I take a turn/ You take a turn&quot; game. This is random events, varying length impulses per turn, surprises at every moment kind of a game with an intuitive set of rules. It is not so random that you have nothing to do but sit back and let the game play itself. The choices are there every impulse for the gamer to impact game play. Tactical Event Cards can be played at any time, no matter whose impulse it is.

We give players the opportunity to build up a Meter to make attacks stronger, Chain together incredible combos, and Blast opponents away with the BLAST Attack!<br/><br/>The Mayor of Angry Town has caused a massive amount of chaos and anarchy all thoughout the Lovely Town of Angry Town.  However, amidst all of the unrest comes opportunity.  The citizens are now free to realize their dreams, but they need to get some people out of the way, namely the Mayor.  To realize their ambitions they will need the Mayor out of the way, or on their side.  But the Mayor is a tough sell, and many seek an audience with him.  How will the citizenry overcome this obsticle?  The only way to know is to jump in and play!<br/><br/>Angry Town is a 2 Player game that is easy to learn and easy to play.  The game (or Match) is played in 4 Phases: the Attack Phase, Defend Phase, Draw Phase, and the End Phase.  One Player (or Fighter) is always on the Attack and one is always on the Defense and each Fighter will be switching between those Phases throughout the Match.  Fighters will draw 7 cards and use those cards for both attack and defense, and the only way to draw back up to 7 (or enter the Draw Phase) is to declare End Phase one after the other.<br/><br/>To begin a Match Players will choose one of 8 Fighters: a Ninja Howler Monkey, a Failed Martial Artist Bum, a Quack Doctor, an Angry Nerd, a Demented Girl Scout, a Baby Mob Boss, a Luchador Rabi, and a Nun, each with their own Ability that gives them a edge over their opponent.  As the game progresses Fighters will build up a Meter that can be used for a CCCCombo Breaker!!!, power up an attack, or fill it all the way up to FINISH the opponent with the BLAST Attack!<br/><br/>If you want to test out the game then come to our website and download our 2 Fighter Print N Play Demo, and see for yourself what makes Angry Town so livid.<br/><br/>There are 3 Modes of Play: &quot;Classic Mode&quot; (2 Player head-to-head), &quot;Tag Team Mode&quot; (2 Player head-to-head with 2 or 3 Fighters each), and &quot;Chaos Mode&quot; (a 3-8 Player Battle Royale!).<br/><br/>Come on in and play!

All of the calculations were correct. She'd sent objects back in time, that was for sure. Not smart phones or radios, of course, but spoons and knives, sure! She'd sent animals back in time, but why couldn't she send people? People didn't cause paradox events, so they should be able to be sent, but each time, the team just sat in the Wilson Transform Box and nothing happened. It just didn't make sense.<br/><br/>Then, one night in the lab, Wanda's daughter Erika began walking around in the lab. She was supposed to be doing her homework, of course, but that was boring, and she began wandering around the lab. Dr. Wilson had decided to try sending a spoon back in time to witness the signing of the Declaration of Independence, something that had worked before. She looked on with horror as she saw young Erika in the Wilson Transform Box. Dr. Wilson's fear was not because Erika would be hurt, but that  Erika would ruin the experiment. People couldn't be sent back! Nothing would happen!<br/><br/>To Wanda's amazement, she was wrong. Erika disappeared along with the spoon! Would Wanda 's daughter return in the 24 hours allotted? Wanda hoped so. 24 hours later, Erika and the spoon re-appeared in the Box. Erika described what she had seen. She'd seen Ben Franklin just like in school! She'd seen John Hancock sign the document! The details were too detailed, too amazing to be wrong!<br/><br/>Wanda finally figured it out. Adults, with their knowledge of modern events, would cause the same paradox events that would be caused by advanced technology, but kids would be unobtrusive enough to prevent the paradox. With the help of Wanda and scientists like her, historians began planning to getting information they needed with Kids in Time.<br/><br/>"}, "184774": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2689689.jpg", "is_expanded_by": {"201412": {"name": "Src:Card 3-4 Player Expansion"}}, "poll": {}, "boardgamedesigner": {"85819": {"name": "Sam Boychuk"}}, "statistics": {}, "yearpublished": "2015", "maxplayers": "2", "boardgameartist": {"85820": "Jacob Grossman"}, "boardgamepublisher": {"30636": {"name": "Src:Card Games"}}, "maxplaytime": "45", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2689689_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "15", "boardgamecategory": {"1002": {"name": "Card Game"}}, "description": "Src:Card is a standalone 1-2 player (2-4 with expansion) card game that challenges players to build their own super robot core while attacking their opponent by writing code. Make your robot core as formidable as possible while creating code to attack and anticipate changes to your opponent's network. Src:Card is made for anyone interested in programming who has a love of gaming.  Birthed from a love of German style boardgames, computer strategy games and too much time programming, Src:Card incorporates real coding concepts that are challenging for experts and easy to learn for beginners.<br/><br/>In Src:Card players have statement (method, bug and structure) cards and cybernetic core cards in their hand throughout the game.  At the beginning of a turn a player will draw a new card. A player has the opportunity to harden the core of his/her robot's cybernetic core by adding nodes and firewall components.  Each player must balance increased strength attributes against the vulnerabilities that new core cards present. Each player desires to harden his/her robot's core as much as possible while delaying the eight card &quot;boot-up&quot; threshold.<br/><br/>At the same time, players are creating code using actual programming items to defeat their opponent's super robot. The placement of different loops, varying conditional statements and a multitude of functions allows each player to create dynamic, ever changing instructions of attack against their opponent. All components can be nested and with the addition of expansion packs, new functions and additional players are added to the game.<br/><br/>When a player has passed the 8-card &quot;boot-up&quot; threshold, their robot is alive and is open to attack from its opponents. Should an opponent defeat your robot, they will be victorious. However should you do the same, you will neutralise the threat of that nation&rsquo;s super robot and claim victory for your realm!<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": {"286055": "First edition"}, "average": "6.02632", "name": "Src:Card", "playingtime": "45", "boardgamemechanic": {"2081": "Route/Network Building"}, "age": "10", "boardgameexpansion": {}, "usersrated": "19", "boardgamefamily": {"8374": "Crowdfunding: Kickstarter"}}, "184775": {"average": "5.5", "poll": {}, "name": "Karma Crystals: Elemental Battle", "playingtime": "20", "minplayers": "1", "boardgamemechanic": {"2072": "Dice Rolling"}, "yearpublished": "2015", "usersrated": "2", "maxplayers": "8", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2683082_t.png", "boardgameintegration": {"181151": "Karma Crystals: Block Master"}, "statistics": {}, "boardgamepublisher": {"30242": {"name": "3D6 Games"}}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2683082.png", "boardgameversion": {"286059": "First edition"}, "maxplaytime": "20", "boardgamecategory": {"1009": {"name": "Abstract Strategy"}}, "age": "12", "minplaytime": "10", "description": "Use The New Rock, Paper, Scissors Mechanic To Score!<br/><br/>You can travel down life through good deeds or bad deeds, but karma will follow you either way.

Born to a wealthy merchant family, she grew up with no desire unfulfilled. However, she did not inherit her family&rsquo;s lust for wealth. She had ambitions to be a scholar, a traveler, and an explorer of unknown places. Throughout her life she studied, remaining bookish and reclusive while her siblings engaged in the more typical mating rituals of the idle rich. When her parents left her a sizable inheritance she built a secluded manor, a sanctuary of intellect away from what she saw as the crass, banal world around her.<br/><br/>In her middle age she was known for hosting extravagant salon parties for the local nobles, scholars, and bardic colleges. Her gardens were considered the most extraordinary in the region. Her study of horticulture continued well into her later life, when she developed an interest in rare and hybrid species of plants. This interest eventually led Abelia to discover a most interesting legend about the rarest flower of all, the Stygian Rose.<br/><br/>Supposedly this midnight black rose grew in compact bushes along the banks of the river Styx, the physical boundary between the realm of the living and the underworld. As a learned woman, she regarded this legend as common superstition until she came across the writings of the great adventurer Leopold Malando. In his journals, Malando described a chthonic expedition wherein he not only found this plant, but used it to restore life to one of his dead colleagues. Unfortunately for Abelia, this discovery occurred just prior to the dementia that claimed her mind in the last years of her life.<br/><br/>She became obsessed with the prospect of finding the Stygian Rose and adding it to her world-renowned garden. She contracted a team of dwarven diggers to tunnel below her gardens and search for the river of the dead. In the end, she may have found it. 10 years ago Abelia Prem vanished without a trace, leaving her property abandoned. In the months prior to her disappearance, she suddenly released her servants from duty in a fit of dementia. Neither Abelia Prem, nor her team of dwarves were ever seen again.<br/><br/>"}, "184804": {"rpgitemversion": {"286110": "HTML Version"}, "statistics": {}, "name": "Wizards & Weapons", "rpgproducer": {"36143": "Tom Doolan"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2685975.jpg", "usersrated": "0", "average": "0", "rpggenre": {"961": "Fantasy"}, "rpg": {"28369": "Wizards & Weapons"}, "rpgcategory": {"2083": "Core Rules (min needed to play)"}, "poll": {}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2685975_t.jpg", "description": "User summary:<br/><br/>Characters have four attributes (Brawn, Balance, Brains, Body) that are generated randomly with d26.

As noted in the introductory material the card art often is taken from copyrighted sources or is fairly primitive.<br/><br/>Play is driven by the card pack and no GM is needed.  Each player selects a Hero and a Creature card to play.  The players select a single Quest card to share.  The remaining cards are shuffled into the pack and each player is dealt five cards.  Players equip their characters with Item and Enhancement cards from their hand and play World cards collectively to create the adventure map.  Play proceeds with the lead player acting as GM in narration of events.  In general, play follows the World Card directions to create the adventure which builds toward Quest completion.  Draws and counter-draws may occur on each players hand in a round.<br/><br/>Various rules cover combat, healing, question completion, and card stacking.  When characters advance in power (e.g., &quot;gain a level&quot;, so to speak) they do so by adding a Hero or Enhancement card to their existing build.

Most of the time you&rsquo;re diving into waters to recover something that belongs to someone else, because you were paid to retrieve it or because there&rsquo;s profit in recovering and selling it. But that water is never the beautiful, peaceful, shallow sea you see on holovids. It&rsquo;s too deep for casual salvagers to attempt, or in waters teeming with dangerous creatures, or located in areas frequented by violent insurgents or protected by Incorporate soldiers. Any way you look at it, it&rsquo;s not an easy job. So when a client shows up at your door with a fairly simple job, you jump on it.<br/><br/>The client in this case was a bottlenose dolphin who went by the name of Surfjumper. She was a courier and transporter, specializing in delivering small cargoes discreetly. Her latest job was hauling a cargo pod of scientific monitoring equipment and the resulting data from a small island about 700 kilometers north of Second Try.<br/><br/>The haul went without incident until approximately 62 kilometers south of Summer Island, a lesser white appeared at the extreme edge of her echolocation and assumed a hunting pattern. Surfjumper attempted to lose the white by using the terrain, but she couldn&rsquo;t maneuver quickly enough with the cargo pod. She dumped the cargo pod, noting the coordinates, and proceeded to evade the white. However, when she circled back, the white had returned to the area where she dumped the pod. It refused to leave the area, forcing her to abandon the cargo pod and seek help.<br/><br/>Being an independent courier, she had no resources to call on, so she came to your company to hire you to retrieve the cargo pod for her. She will pay the standard rate plus danger money, even if the white is no longer in the area. The water is just over 600 meters deep, which is not that bad. All you have to do is return the pod to her at Dock Berth 94 in Second Try as soon as possible.<br/><br/>Easy money, right?<br/><br/>"}, "184841": {"poll": {}, "name": "Sneeze: The Card Game", "playingtime": "30", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": {"2664": "Deck / Pool Building"}, "yearpublished": "2015", "usersrated": "0", "maxplayers": "6", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2696999_t.png", "average": "0", "statistics": {}, "boardgamepublisher": {"30625": {"name": "Fairway 3 Games, LLC"}}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2696999.png", "boardgameversion": {"286163": "First edition"}, "maxplaytime": "30", "boardgamecategory": {"1002": {"name": "Card Game"}}, "age": "12", "minplaytime": "15", "description": "Sneeze is all about staying as healthy as possible while making sure that you're not too healthy and that everyone else has more infections than you.

Dynamite multiplies the value of a cave, but three or more sticks blows the place up, costing you coins.<br/><br/>If someone has one hundred or more coins, the game ends and whoever has the most coins wins; if not, set up another round and go digging again.<br/><br/>"}, "184920": {"boardgamedesigner": {"85867": {"name": "Chana Bergman"}}, "poll": {}, "name": "Cubingos", "playingtime": "20", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": {"2060": "Pattern Recognition"}, "yearpublished": "2015", "usersrated": "9", "maxplayers": "4", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2764835_t.jpg", "average": "4.72222", "statistics": {}, "boardgamepublisher": {"22": {"name": "Piatnik"}}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2764835.jpg", "boardgameversion": {"286275": "Piatnik first edition"}, "maxplaytime": "20", "boardgamecategory": {"1041": {"name": "Children's Game"}}, "age": "5", "minplaytime": "15", "description": "Cubingos is played with large plastic cubes.

Although seemingly ponderous and fragile, and filled with inflammable hydrogen, in 1914 the airships built by Count Zeppelin for the fatherland were a much more viable platform to bomb the English than the rickety wood and canvas aeroplanes that struggled into the sky at the time. Able to fly for days and cover thousands of miles, they were a true &lsquo;airy navy&rsquo;. However, despite the conviction of its champion, the Leader of Airships Fgtkpt Peter Strasser, this Teutonic leviathan was not a war winning weapon, and failed to deliver the hoped-for victory.<br/><br/>Any reading of the campaign will show that their greatest challenge was not the British defences, but just finding their way over the British countryside. In the dark (all raids were at night), it all looks much the same, and there were no radio beams to guide them like in WWII. This is reflected in the game; above all it is a game of navigation.<br/><br/>The Zeppelin's movement is governed by a system that limits what you can do depending on how well you know your location. The latter you can improve by using landmarks, such as towns, rivers, railroads and coastlines. Alternatively, you can ignore these and rely on dead reckoning, but then you might end up totally lost in the middle of nowhere. And of course, there's weather (clouds, rain, mist) to frustrate you too. However, there's a chance of opportunistic targets when towns randomly fail to blackout.<br/><br/>However, it wasn&rsquo;t only the Germans who faced the problems of the night. British aviation struggled to develop the technology and practice to deal with night raiders. A warning system that could enable timely launch of aeroplane patrols was never really developed, and once in the air the airman was on his own not knowing where the raider might be, or even where he was. Of course searchlights were the essential item to make the air defence viable, but the wily Zeppelin commander did all he could to avoid them, including using cloud cover.<br/><br/>This is similarly modelled in the game. The British player makes a hidden set up for his airfields before the German player comes on. Once the raiders arrive, he can launch aeroplane patrols, but the number and location is restricted by how much activity the raiders do to reveal themselves. Once launched, the patrol remains in place until a searchlit Zeppelin is in spotting range, and then it can attempt to intercept and attack. In the early scenarios aeroplane attacks can be damaging and cause a Zeppelin to scuttle home with leaks, but after incendiary ammunition was developed in mid 1916 it became sudden death to the Zeppelin.<br/><br/>The British player also has anti-aircraft guns, which are distributed over the map and controlled largely by random rolls, except for the mobile guns which the British player can place at strategic locations and use to set up ambushes.<br/><br/>Combat is largely abstracted to die rolls, but the challenge is to bring the raider to bear. As the British, you plan your fighter patrols and move mobile AA guns to defend areas or set up ambush. But reveal a unit too soon and the German player will know its there and avoid it. As the German, use stealth to avoid combat. Hide in clouds; at all costs keep out of those searchlights. But in the end, you have to brave them if you want to bomb the good targets.<br/><br/>This game offers a definitive study of that unusual campaign, with a set of 20 scenarios (each being an actual historical raid), covering the entire 4 years of the campaign. The subject matter naturally lends itself well to solitaire play as well, and specific rules for this are included.<br/><br/>"}, "184934": {"boardgamedesigner": {"78476": {"name": "Yuichi Tagami"}}, "average": "7", "poll": {}, "name": "\u539f\u59cb\u4eba\u306e\u6669\u9910 (Supper of Primitive Man)", "playingtime": "60", "minplayers": "2", "yearpublished": "2015", "usersrated": "3", "boardgamefamily": {"22783": "Admin: Better Description Needed!"}, "maxplayers": "5", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2683418_t.jpg", "boardgameartist": {"78476": "Yuichi Tagami"}, "statistics": {}, "boardgamepublisher": {"28351": {"name": "Tagami Games"}}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2683418.jpg", "boardgameversion": {"286292": "Japanese first edition"}, "maxplaytime": "60", "boardgamecategory": {"1002": {"name": "Card Game"}}, "age": "8", "minplaytime": "30", "description": "\u539f\u59cb\u4eba\u306e\u6669\u9910 (Supper of Primitive Man) makes you the head of a primitive tribe, and by hunting and gathering you can nourish that tribe, increasing its numbers and moving toward victory.<br/><br/>"}, "184936": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2687452.jpg", "poll": {}, "boardgamedesigner": {"70619": {"name": "Paul Fish"}}, "statistics": {}, "yearpublished": "2015", "maxplayers": "2", "boardgameartist": {"3439": "Rick Barber"}, "boardgamepublisher": {"9512": {"name": "Legion Wargames LLC"}}, "maxplaytime": "120", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2687452_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "60", "boardgamecategory": {"1051": {"name": "Napoleonic"}}, "description": "Black Eagles Over Belgium: Blucher vs. Napoleon, 1815 is a hex-and-counter wargame covering the Belgium led battles taking place near Waterloo.

The object of the game is to collect the most Thwarbles&trade; by touching or landing on previously tossed pieces.<br/><br/>Pick off ThWack! - Players place nine Thwarbles onto the board with one in the center and eight along the edges on small ThWack! dots. The Thwacks! on the edge can be placed in a position where they extend partially over the edge to increase difficulty. Players toss their ThWack! attempting to land it on a Thwarble. If successful, the player removes that Thwarble from the board. Play continues until all pieces have been removed. The player with the most Thwarbles at the end wins.<br/><br/>ThWack! ThWarbles - Players pitch and stick their ThWarbles to the board attempting to hit target areas.<br/><br/>RatFink Fly Swat - Players toss ThWarbles to tag ten fly images on the board. Whichever player manages to cover the most flies with his or her ThWarble wins.<br/><br/>Rotation - Players lay out four to six ThWarbles in a clock-like pattern or &quot;rack&quot; around the edges of the board. Players then call which ThWarble they will hit. If they miss, it's the other player's turn. If they hit, they call another ThWarble, continuing until they miss. Winner completes the pattern first.<br/><br/>Chip Shot - One player begins by tossing a ThWarble onto the board, which represents a golf hole. The players attempt to tag that piece in the fewest number of shots. The player who takes the fewest number of throws or &quot;strokes&quot; to hit either 9 or 18 &quot;holes&quot;, wins.<br/><br/>Thwack 'Em - Four Thwarbles are placed on the board. Players pitch a thwarble trying to cover one on the board with his own thwarble. (If so he removes both thwarbles.) Player with the most thwarbles wins.<br/><br/>ThWack! ThWarbles 2 - Players determine how many rounds they will play, how many ThWarbles each player will toss out to start each round, and the distance that each player must toss from. Players see who can toss their Thwarbles closest to the edge without them falling off.

General Feldmarschall Erich von Manstein, commander of Army Group Don, requested reinforcements and was sent Paul Hausser in command of the SS Panzer Corps. One of the units of these reinforcements was the LSSAH, which was thrown into the line defending Kharkov. Attacking them were the hundreds of T-34s of the Southeast Front, composed of a number of Soviet armored army-sized formations, which continued to move west, slicing through the vast plains of the Ukraine, finally reaching a force that would stand and fight. The SS clashed with the Russians on the 8th of February, 1943. The 1st SS Panzer Grenadier Regiment, fighting alongside I/1st SS Panzer Regiment, halted the Soviet juggernaut at the village of Merefa. Still, the Soviets disregarded their heavy losses and pushed the SS back into Kharkov proper. Envisioning another Stalingrad-like encirclement and destruction, Hausser ignored Hitler&rsquo;s orders to hold the city at all costs and withdrew to the southwest while continuing to fight delaying actions. Hausser, having disobeyed Hitler, needed to take back Kharkov and with the support of von Manstein on 2 March the LSSAH was formed into three Kampfgruppen which would attack into and capture Kharkov.<br/><br/>During the year 1976 a ground-breaking tactical-level game called &ldquo;TOBRUKTM&rdquo; was released. The brainchild of designer Hal Hock, it quickly broke new ground. Years later it was the inspiration behind a new and much-expanded system. That all happened with the publication of ADVANCED TOBRUK in 2002.

Secretly, however, the garrison was slowly expanded to 176 men and six officers. The position was separated from Danzig by the harbour channel, and only a small pier connected them to the mainland. The Polish-held part of the Westerplatte was separated from the territory of Danzig by a brick wall. Fortifications built at Westerplatte were in fact not very impressive: there were no real bunkers or underground tunnels, there were only five small concrete outposts (guardhouses) hidden in the peninsula's forest; and a large barracks prepared for defense, supported by a network of field fortifications such as trenches and barricades. Cellars of outposts were fit to fire heavy-machine guns from within them. In case of war, the defenders were expected to withstand a sustained attack for 12 hours. Beginning on September 1, 1939, German naval forces and soldiers launched World War two with their attack on the Polish Military Transit Depot (Wojskowa Skladnica Tranzytowa, WST) on the peninsula of Westerplatte. Despite estimates of their ability to hold out, the Polish garrison held on for seven days in the face of a German onslaught that included Stuka dive bomber attacks. The defense of Westerplatte served as an inspiration for the Polish Army and people in the face of the debut of the Blitzkreig amidst German Case White. Their struggle is still regarded as a symbol of resistance to the Nazi invasion that plunged the world into war.<br/><br/>This is ATS WESTERPLATTE: FIRST SHOTS OF WORLD WAR II, an amazing assault that will live proudly in the martial history of Poland forever.

It is an extensively researched wargame inspired by the nearly life-long interest of the designer in the subject matter. Units are individual ships and also individual aircraft, although these are amalgamated into various counters by aircraft type. There is area movement for some portions of the map, and the areas of particular interest are modeled using 250-yard-wide hexes. The simulation is detailed but not overly complex and includes various subsystems to render results for air-to-air, air-to-ground/ship, anti-aircraft, and also anti-submarine operations, to engage any full-size and/or midget Japanese submarines brought into action.<br/><br/>The initial scenario may be played by two players, although it is designed to be a solitaire introduction to the system and also a way to let players experience and study this historic battle, to give insight into much of what happened and why. The likelihood is that you will achieve the historical result, a Japanese Tactical Victory. The standard scenario presents all of the forces available to both sides and allows the Japanese player to modify his or her deployment and attack plans up to and including the composition of the two attack waves. If you think you can plan a more successful attack than Minoru Genda did, you have here the tools to try. Conversely, the U.S. player has the opportunity to fight back to the best of his or her ability, and various optional rules - particularly variations in the initial Alert Level - give the U.S. player more assets with which to fight and more assets to save through evacuation.<br/><br/>There is also a scenario which has one or two American aircraft carriers in port and your initial thought is probably that this is a huge bonus toward Strategic Victory for the Japanese. However, the main Japanese player dilemma of this simulation is that the Japanese have a finite amount of aircraft and ordnance, and more targets are not necessarily a guarantee of victory. You will find that you need to target appropriately and generally roll for damage well in order to successfully hit everything you need to hit. The options allowing a third strike later in the day or the next day are a gamble - you can strike again, but at a fully alerted, albeit weakened, set of targets and you risk losing more aircraft, which equal Victory Points for the U.S.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "1", "boardgameversion": {"286374": "First Edition"}, "age": "0", "name": "Air Raid Pearl Harbor", "playingtime": "0", "boardgamemechanic": {"2072": "Dice Rolling"}, "average": "8", "usersrated": "2", "boardgamefamily": {"22184": "Admin: Unreleased Games"}}, "184990": {"rpg": {"2791": "Pathfinder System Compatible Product"}, "poll": {}, "name": "The Construct Companion", "rpgproducer": {"34290": "L.
