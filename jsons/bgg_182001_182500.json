The upper level is lightly armed with one harpoon and two catapults. The main feature of the Atlantean Merchant Barge is a very large cargo hold with a dual crane allowing for a quick unloading and loading of cargo.

Build it to save as many humans as you can and launch your spaceship to the nearest exoplanet before the supernova.<br/><br/>Constructing your ship is only half the game. For those that survive the solar event and launch their ships, they must face new challenges on the way to our new exoplanet home, Earth 667C. The Journey to the new planet has boosts and perils along the way, including black holes, quasars, enemy vessels, and asteroid fields. Your ship building skills and the luck of the dice combine to determine your crew and survivors' fates. Will you be the first to Earth 667C?<br/><br/>Earth 667C is a card and turn-based tabletop game for 2-6 players or teams. Perfect for ages 10 and up, the game is fun, encourages strategic thinking, and includes just enough chance and player relationship dynamics to create three game phases with unique challenges.<br/><br/>Phase 1: Ship Building<br/>Purchase Ship Components from Space Dock, and construct the fastest ship carrying the most people. Customize your ship by doubling your navigation for better travel. Double your engineering department for increased speed. Or, add more food and life support to increase your capacity to carry survivors. Pick your strategy for your ship and start building. Optional Ship Components are available for purchase. Components like weapon systems, shuttle bays, and radiation shield provide bonuses or protection during The Journey.<br/><br/>Phase 2: Launch Your Ship<br/>When the Solar Cycle hits 8, you can launch your fully constructed spaceship. Roll the dice and aim for 12 or higher to push your ship into position for The Journey. Get 12 or lower? Then you must wait, and hope that the solar clock does not tick down any further. You must launch your ship before the clock hits zero, and the sun goes supernova.<br/><br/>Phase 3: The Journey<br/>When the clock hits zero and sun engulfs the Earth, the real Journey begins. Play a single turn journey, or an eight turn journey. Roll the dice and discover what boosts and perils await you while traveling to humanity's new exoplanet home. Encounter new enemies that attack and slow your ship, or pass a strong hydrogen cloud that boosts your engines. Utilize your optional Ship Components to ward off enemies or discover wormholes to increase your speed. This phase will put your ship building skills to the test. The events during The Journey can slow the fastest ship, and propel others to victory.<br/><br/>Be the first ship with the most survivors to reach Earth 667C and ensure the survival of the human race on our new exoplanet home!<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": {"281945": "First edition"}, "age": "10", "name": "Earth 667C", "playingtime": "90", "boardgamemechanic": {"2041": "Card Drafting"}, "average": "4.70769", "usersrated": "13", "boardgamefamily": {"22184": "Admin: Unreleased Games"}}, "182296": {"rpg": {"356": "Generic / Universal"}, "poll": {}, "name": "Into the Darkness: Map 0", "rpgproducer": {"41223": "Kristian Richards"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2626691.png", "usersrated": "0", "rpgitemversion": {"281949": "PDF version"}, "average": "0", "statistics": {}, "rpggenre": {"961": "Fantasy"}, "rpgcategory": {"2086": "Accessory (dice, maps, screens, cards)"}, "rpgseries": {"28014": "Into the Darkness"}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2626691_t.png", "description": "From publisher blurb:<br/><br/>Into the Darkness: Map 0 is a (free) map-pack that features a small cave map which should be suitable for inclusion in most fantasy settings.<br/><br/>This product contains:<br/><br/>    A pdf booklet featuring a labelled version of the cave.<br/>    A miniatures scaled battlemap of the cave (split over 2 pages).<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>(Into the Darkness: Map 0 is a (free) map-pack that features a small cave map which should be suitable for inclusion in most fantasy settings.<br/><br/>This product contains:<br/><br/>    A pdf booklet featuring a labelled version of the cave.<br/>    A miniatures scaled battlemap of the cave (split over 2 pages).<br/>    An unlabelled jpg image (scaled at 100 pixels per grid square) - suitable for use with VTTs.An unlabelled jpg image (scaled at 100 pixels per grid square) - suitable for use with VTTs.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>"}, "182297": {"rpgitemversion": {"281961": "Softcover edition"}, "poll": {}, "name": "Once Upon A Time In Arabia", "rpgproducer": {"3": "(Uncredited)"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2626678.jpg", "usersrated": "0", "average": "0", "statistics": {}, "rpggenre": {"856": "Fantasy (Arabian Nights)"}, "rpg": {"4475": "Virtual Reality Adventure"}, "rpgcategory": {"2136": "Solitaire Adventure"}, "rpgseries": {"28016": "Critical IF"}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2626678_t.jpg", "description": "From publisher blurb:<br/><br/>Put yourself at the heart of the story&hellip;<br/><br/>Your life is in danger from a powerful enemy.

Reincarnate is a chance to roll the dice on your character&rsquo;s destiny, and the spell provides a real and tangible possibility of creating dramatic change for the creature brought back. Many players enjoy the high risk and high reward experience of reincarnate, and others appreciate the interesting roleplaying opportunities it provides. But the spell&rsquo;s a bit outdated, and it shows. For one, there are tons of exciting humanoid races in products released after the Pathfinder Roleplaying Game Core Rulebook that you can&rsquo;t become, because they were created after the table was made. Further, there&rsquo;s one little phrase that turns a reincarnate spell cast on anything besides a humanoid into a real pain:<br/><br/>For non-humanoid creatures, a similar table of creatures of the same type should be created.<br/><br/>If you&rsquo;ve ever had your game come to a grinding halt because your druid wanted to cast reincarnate on his animal companion, or you wish that there was a more convenient way to include all the fun new player character races in a single place, or you wish there was a teensy-weensy chance that a reincarnate could turn you into a medusa, this is the book for you. In addition to an updated set of tables for humanoid creatures, this book contains detailed nested tables for determining the new form of an animal companion, or a familiar, or a creature of any creature type. With no less than 50 tables containing creatures from Pathfinder Roleplaying Game: Advanced Race Guide and the Pathfinder Roleplaying Game Bestiaries 1 &ndash; 4, plus other sources, you have everything you need to make reincarnating any creature a fun and exciting experience. Plus, the book includes a set of optional rules for karmic reincarnation, which allows a character&rsquo;s actions in life to influence how they return.

The tile back depicts both versions green and red, the tile front only one. Players move the common playing piece around by rolling a die. When the child moves to a space where a tile is they first have to guess which picture is on the tiles front side. Two possibilities are pictured on the tile back. Upon a correct guess the player whose turn it is also has to tell the meaning of this traffic sign. If both are correct the player can keep the tile and roll again.

Players are dealt 6 cards. They keep one, placing face-down in front of them, and then pass two from their hand face-up to the player on their left. This is repeated, keeping one passing two, until they only have three cards left in their hand. During this last hand (you'll have three cards) you'll keep one and only pass one. Once finished players will keep both of these cards to finish their set of cards. All players reveal their hands and begin scoring. The highest scoring hand wins and receives bonus points. Play to a set score, usually 100 points.<br/><br/>Piat Gin is the next game in the series of &quot;alien card games&quot;, Konog being the first. Games designed around the premise of a fictional alien race and how they might go about making a game that reflects their culture, biology, ideologies and other aspects of the species. These games are imported and introduced to those of us living in the Core Systems by the explorers and pioneers returning from the frontiers.<br/><br/>The Camenni are a long-lived species, known for extreme patience and sudden bursts of well-coordinated action. Piat Gin is a simple past time, different from the more complex time-consuming games that the elders might take part in (games similar to Chess or Go in which single turns can take years or decades to accomplish). This is not a game that possesses lavish details or ornate components. Piat Gin is carried by Camenni adventurers due to its small size or used to teach children patience and to practice the observation of subtle interactions of others.<br/><br/>The card faces and their features are intentionally kept simple, possessing no complex Camenni script, only differing amounts of circles, triangles, or rhombus (3 suits, numbered 1-6). This is so the game can be taught to most any species that might be encountered (please note that this deck is not resistant to mucus, salivation, persperation, or extremely high body temperatures like standard &quot;outrider&quot; decks). Camenni will drag a game of Piat Gin on for hours and even days when playing with each other. Of course, we don't have that luxury and play a round in a few minutes.<br/><br/>"}, "182382": {"poll": {}, "name": "Die Hochzeits Prinzessin", "playingtime": "0", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": {"2072": "Dice Rolling"}, "yearpublished": "0", "usersrated": "0", "maxplayers": "4", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2633652_t.jpg", "average": "0", "statistics": {}, "boardgamepublisher": {"127": {"name": "Klee"}}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2633652.jpg", "boardgameversion": {"282134": "First edition"}, "maxplaytime": "0", "boardgamecategory": {"1041": {"name": "Children's Game"}}, "age": "5", "minplaytime": "0", "description": "Each Player gets a bride as a figure.

Your task is to use Intelligence cards to influence your country into taking wise decisions. The trouble is, enemy spies have infiltrated your country and are influencing it into taking less wise decisions! Develop your culture to make it easier to spot enemy spies, improve science to get access to more elaborate cards, further your military to increase the number of spies at your disposal, or invest in economy to pay for bonus actions, known as Secret Directives.<br/><br/>Aim: There are four different types of Intelligence cards which are used to make progress on  4 corresponding development tracks. The winner of the game is the first player to reach the end of any one of these tracks. As players progress up the tracks, which each have 10 spaces, they also unlock various benefits:<br/><br/>Economy: Increases income of coins. Coins are spent on bonus actions which happen at the end of a round.<br/>Military: Increases number of spies you have. More spies means more actions can be taken in each round.<br/>Science: Makes more cards available. There are three levels of cards, at the beginning of the game, players only have access to the most basic cards.<br/>Culture: Means capturing enemy spies is easier. At the end of a round, players who have developed culture can roll one to three dice to try to capture enemy spies.<br/><br/>In addition to trying to progress on development tracks, players need to build a deck of cards made up of Intelligence cards and Action cards. Cards can be added to their deck through research actions, which allow players to take cards from a shared supply. Most of the time, cards that are played return to that players deck by reshuffling their discard pile. However, playing Intelligence cards into another player&rsquo;s country removes that card from their deck more permanently, and can also slow their opponents progress on the  development tracks.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": {"282143": "First edition"}, "age": "12", "name": "Secret Directive", "playingtime": "60", "boardgamemechanic": {"2080": "Area Control / Area Influence"}, "average": "6.33333", "usersrated": "3", "boardgamefamily": {"8374": "Crowdfunding: Kickstarter"}}, "182389": {"boardgamedesigner": {"8933": {"name": "Richard Hutnik"}}, "poll": {}, "name": "Trollin': The Trick-Taking Cardgame", "playingtime": "0", "minplayers": "1", "boardgamemechanic": {"2009": "Trick-taking"}, "yearpublished": "2015", "usersrated": "0", "maxplayers": "6", "average": "0", "statistics": {}, "boardgamepublisher": {"1001": {"name": "(Web published)"}}, "boardgameversion": {"282145": "First edition"}, "maxplaytime": "0", "boardgamecategory": {"1002": {"name": "Card Game"}}, "age": "0", "minplaytime": "0", "description": "In Trollin', the object of the game is to try to take as many trick cards as possible, without taking the most cards of the poison suit.  If a player takes the most cards of the poison suit during a round/hand, they score no points for the round.<br/><br/>The game is playable with a reduced set of standard playing cards.  In the 2 player version (the game is playable for 1-6 players), players play with Ace, King, Queen, Jack, and 10 of all four suits.  The deck also uses 2 Jokers of different markings that are part of the Trump suit, which is Spades in the game, and are of greater value than the Ace, which is the highest in the trump (Cards go from high to low as Ace, King, Queen, Jack and 10).  Players are dealt 9 cards each and 4 cards are not used and are placed face down, and out of play, for the round.  As more players are added, more cards are added to the deck used.<br/><br/>The game also uses Hearts as the Poison suit.  During a round, a player who took the most Heart cards scores zero points, while their opponent scores 1 point for each trick they won.  In case of a tie for Hearts won in a trick, players score 1 point for each trick they won.<br/><br/>The game also features several optional rules, one of which is that a player can declare themselves Trollin' before the first trick is played.  If a player declares Trollin', they score as many points as the number of trick they won, and their opponent(s) score 0 for the round, IF they player managed to take all available Heart cards that could be won.  If the player declaring Trollin' fails to win all available Hearts, then they score zero points for a round and their opponent scores 1 point for each trick they won.<br/><br/>The game is played for a set number of rounds, or to a target score.  The name of the game comes from the inspiration of the game, that is Internet flame wars and people trolling in forums on the Internet.

The Turks were concerned about this possibility and they endeavored to remain neutral during the war. Unlike the First World War, the Turks could not hope to hold Istanbul in the event of a war, and any incursion by one side (Axis or Allied) would certainly invite an incursion by the other. The Turks were most concerned about Soviets, but if Hitler had conceived a notion of invading Turkey, the Germans' most daunting challenge would be the Allied response, not necessarily the Turkish Army.

Strategic options abound for both players; victory goes to the one best able to carry out the chosen strategy, while maintaining a reserve to contain sudden enemy action or exploit an opportunity. The map covers the eastern front from Leningrad to the Sea of Azov at 20 miles per hex. Turns cover one month each for most of the year, two months during winter. Most units are Soviet armies and German divisions, plus a few Axis satellite corps. The turn sequence is built around the random drawing of chits to determine which player moves. Each chit drawn allows a player to both move and attack, but with a twist. One side allows the player to move first, then attack, the other side flips the sequence. There are two twists to the mechanism. First, chits come in several varieties, with differing penalties or bonuses depending on the chit and the side chosen. Second, during certain turns, one player or the other gets bonuses, allowing selection of the first chit to open the action, and providing a different mix of chits reflecting the overall situation at that point in the war.

Well known for the weird magnetic energies of its core, which attract even non-ferrous metals, and which pulled many a would-be Crawljammer to his doom in the early days of space exploration. Saturn. Legendary home of fierce Ape-Men and even fiercer giant worms, which devolved from a great civilization that once worshipped the vast demon-god Tsathoggua before the first great reptiles appeared to dominate long aeons upon the Earth.<br/><br/>It is said that the collapse of that civilization caused the weird energies of Saturn&rsquo;s magnetic core. Many, but not all, of that demon-haunted culture&rsquo;s works were drawn into the planet&rsquo;s crust, there to be crushed and consumed. Even so, there is a flux to that strange magnetic attraction. Once in several thousand years, the magnetic forces wane for a period, and ships may safely approach or land upon Saturn.<br/><br/>The technomancer Satrampa, who has long made her cold dwelling upon the frozen ocean-moon Tethys, has predicted that such a time is near, and seeks adventurers willing to brave the ringed world&rsquo;s dangers. There they must locate the Vault of Zin the Meticulous. She will pay a man&rsquo;s weight in gold for the black onyx ring long-dead Zin once wore upon his right hand. Failing that, she will pay the same weight in silver for proof that the Idol of Tsathoggua which one strengthened the ancient sorcerer&rsquo;s spells is no more.<br/><br/>"}, "182420": {"rpg": {"13236": "AD&D First Edition (1e) Compatible Products"}, "statistics": {}, "name": "Wonder & Wickedness", "rpgproducer": {"59921": "Paolo Greco"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2941336.jpg", "usersrated": "2", "rpgitemversion": {"282192": "Softcover Version"}, "average": "8.5", "rpggenre": {"155": "Fantasy (High Fantasy)"}, "rpgcategory": {"2108": "Sourcebook (rules/options to enhance play)"}, "poll": {}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2941336_t.jpg", "description": "From the publisher's website:<br/><br/>A new magic system with level-less magic and rules to adapt it to your favourite fantasy RPG.<br/><br/>Support for magic duels! like in fiction!<br/><br/>Seven magic disciplines and a whole lot of new spells.

It takes hundreds of years to re-establish life as we know it on the inner worlds of our solar system. Imperial, Capitol, Bauhaus and Mishima now rule from their homes in the steaming jungles of Venus, the caverns of Mercury, the deserts of Mars and the many orbitals and asteroid homes of the solar system. Luna City is a vast neutral sprawl, many hundreds of years old, built up and over the first colony and mines.<br/><br/>A fateful exploratory mission to Pluto unleashes an ancient evil force &mdash; The Dark Symmetry &mdash; upon the thinking machines of man. As technology fails (and even fights back), mankind is beset with conspiracy and corporate intrigue from within. Dark things gather on the edges of the colonies and whilst corporate war consumes the greatest armies of man, the Dark Legion's citadels rise up throughout the worlds of the solar system and terrifying armies march out to consume all. They were defeated long ago, they will not be defeated this time...<br/><br/>As the Dark Symmetry's malign influence on humanity grows, the Brotherhood with their strange powers, arise to unite the corporate armies as one and fight back.<br/><br/>Mutant Chronicles: Techno Fantasy Roleplaying Game - 3rd Edition fills in the gaps in the original Mutant Chronicles storyline, expanding the backstory and plotting secret events that will carry your adventures through a thousand years of future history.

As fellow villains and loyal henchmen, it's up to you to orchestrate an escape!<br/><br/>This is a (mostly) cooperative board/card game for 1-4 players, in which you acquire super powers, battle heroes, and overcome obstacles to break the super-villain out of a maximum-security prison.  The game includes four (4) different prisons, with their own set-up rules, victory conditions, and defeat conditions.<br/><br/>In order to accomplish their goals, players draw a hand of 5 cards from the communal &quot;Villain&quot; deck.  These cards include Attack cards, Defense cards, and Power Surge cards.  Attack cards are played on heroes, guards, and obstacles in order to defeat them.  Defense cards are played to overcome certain obstacles, as well as protect players' hands from the hero &amp; guard abilities that otherwise make them discard cards and reduce players' effectiveness on their turns.  Power Surge cards are used to overcome certain obstacles, but more importantly are used to purchase super-powers.<br/><br/>Players can acquire different combinations of abilities, choosing from among 22 unique super powers.  These powers run the range of classic powers, including Super Strength, Time Control, Energy Blasts, and others.  Powers allow players to break or augment the normal rules of play, making their hand of cards go further and hit harder.<br/><br/>As the players defeat heroes and guards, they acquire victory points.  If the players succeed in defeating the scenario, the player with the most victory points gets bragging rights as the &quot;winner&quot;.  If the game wins, then all the players lose regardless of points, so teamwork is essential.<br/><br/>"}, "182430": {"boardgamedesigner": {"58071": {"name": "Brian Mayer"}}, "poll": {}, "name": "Quark", "playingtime": "30", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": {"2001": "Action Point Allowance System"}, "yearpublished": "0", "usersrated": "2", "maxplayers": "4", "average": "6.5", "statistics": {}, "boardgamepublisher": {"1001": {"name": "(Web published)"}}, "boardgameversion": {"282223": "First edition"}, "maxplaytime": "0", "boardgamecategory": {"1002": {"name": "Card Game"}}, "age": "10", "minplaytime": "30", "description": "Exert your influence and guide the swirling mass of the smallest bits of matter back together to form sub-atomic particles while racing to build the biggest atom.<br/><br/>Quark is a lighter weight card game.

And then, on one fateful day, he directed his army to attack the palace. The Emperor has chosen to make his final stand in his throne room, from whence he once ruled his empire with a firm hand. He expects to die there, and soon. But the light brother has learned of the dark brother's ill intent, and he has returned from his exile at this pivotal moment. Only, will he reach his father in time?<br/><br/>In this Adventure, three of the Players will be playing &ldquo;story characters.&rdquo; Each story character has a single rule that must be obeyed during character generation. One of the Players will be the Emperor. The only thing the Emperor must be is old enough to have two fully-grown sons. A second Player will be the Brother. The only thing the Brother must be is young enough to be the son of the Emperor. A third Player (if there is one) will be the Emperor's Advisor. The only thing the Advisor must be is allied with the Emperor. Other than that, the Players have full control over who these characters are, from name to abilities to chosen skills.<br/><br/>"}, "182456": {"rpgitemversion": {"282251": "PDF version"}, "statistics": {}, "name": "Infinite Gear 1", "rpgproducer": {"5349": "Robert Hemminger"}, "average": "0", "usersrated": "0", "rpgsetting": {"27205": "The Fringe"}, "rpg": {"9022": "Infinite Futures"}, "rpgcategory": {"2108": "Sourcebook (rules/options to enhance play)"}, "poll": {}, "rpggenre": {"183": "Science Fiction"}, "description": "From publisher blurb:<br/><br/>What Sci-Fi is complete without some cool gear to play with.

With only the vaguest understanding of where their adversaries lay, both high commands intended to march forward to the attack. The earlier-rising allied armies stole the initiative from the Austrians, and collided with their forward pickets before the sun had fully risen.<br/><br/>Thus began the Battle of Solferino, which would draw into the fray over 250,000 men - the largest general engagement in Europe since the Battle of Leipzig in 1813. Before the day was through, nearly 40,000 men would lay dead or wounded, and the Austrian armies would be decisively driven from the field. With the belligerent armies exhausted and alarmed by the potential expansion of the conflict, France and Austria quickly came to terms at Villafranca, ending the conflict known as the Second Italian War of Independence and placing Italy firmly on the road to unification.<br/><br/>All Are Brothers: Solferino, 1859 simulates the decisive battle of the Second Italian War of Independence at the Brigade-level, with some additional Regimental-size and smaller detachments included. National and corps-level leaders are represented, on a Rick Barber map at 500 meters per hex, with 1-hour turns. Four scenarios are included: three that separately cover the north, central, and southern sectors of the battle, as well as a combined full battle scenario. The northern sector scenario &ndash; &ldquo;San Martino&rdquo; &ndash; is the smallest in scope and serves as a nice introductory scenario to the battle and to the game&rsquo;s ruleset. The combined scenario is suitable for up to four players (France, Sardinia-Piedmont, Austrian 1st Army, and Austrian 2nd Army).<br/><br/>The battle itself was a grinding slugfest often described as a &quot;soldier's battle&quot; - a deliberate slight to the often uninspired leadership of the generals and a tribute to an allied victory gained only at the tip of the bayonet. Villagers in the surrounding region would do their best in the days after to treat the myriad wounded, and answer as to why Austrians, Hungarians, Czechs, Serbs, and Slovaks were treated as well as the Italians: &quot;Tutti fratelli&quot; (All are brothers). The battle pits two Austrian armies against the combined forces of France and Sardinia-Piedmont, and features the full panoply of colorful period units - Jagers and Grenzers, massed cavalry divisions of all types, Bersaglieri, French Imperial Guard, and the French African Zouaves and Turcos. Advances in infantry and artillery firepower would soon make the tactics of the time obsolete, and the carnage at Solferino reflected the start of this paradigm shift, soon to be highlighted bloodily by the Austro-Prussian and Franco-Prussian wars.<br/><br/>This treatment of Solferino features an adaptation of Hermann Luttmann&rsquo;s Blind Swords system (At Any Cost, Hammerin' Sickles, Stonewall's Sword) as the core ruleset. The system is heavy on unpredictability and fog of war due to the chit pull mechanic. The chit pull mechanic also very much aids in solitaire play, as does variable activation rules and reinforcement tables.

Players in the game act as the sponsor of a space salvage mission. The star in this solar system is close to going supernova, so time is limited.<br/><br/>Each player starts with a ship capable of harvesting resources from available planets in the solar system for profit. Each planet has a unique mixture and abundance of each of the possible resources: Noble Gas, Organics, Mineral Ore, and Research Samples.  Resources are claimed by rolling dice to see if a particular harvest was successful. The monetary value of each resource is set by a market, which shifts up and down as demand grows or shrinks for the resource.<br/><br/>As the game progresses, players will hire crew and buy modifications to enhance their ship and gain new abilities to help them reach this goal. Crew usually grants small buffs, and modifications often grant new abilities.  While a handful of weapons exist to punish a player who has put all his victory points in one basket, it is often not an efficient use of time or resources to pursue hostilities.<br/><br/>The game progresses through events called solar instabilities.  Each die roll has a chance to produce one or more of these events.  As more and more of these events occur, the player's home base, Stardock, slowly moves further and further away from the unstable star.  When the Stardock reaches the last planet in the system, it prepares to leave and does so immediately before the star explodes.<br/><br/>The game ends when either the star goes supernova (harming any players still left in the solar system) or every player safely leaves before that point.

Yet wizards in some settings can conduct rituals -- even powerful ones -- quickly, safely, and repeatedly. These magic-users wield a kind of innate magic known as sorcery.<br/><br/>GURPS Thaumatology: Sorcery treats magic as a power and builds spells as modified advantages. This gives you the flexibility to create and cast any spell you can imagine, along with the confidence that it will follow clear and consistent rules. And because sorcery is limited only by point cost, its strength scales directly with the campaign's power level.<br/><br/>This tome contains everything you need to start down the path to enlightenment:<br/><br/><br/>     Complete, simple rules for creating sorcerers: Just choose Sorcery and Talent levels, and then pick a few spells!<br/>     Nearly 50 ready-to-use spells -- inspired by GURPS Magic but built using advantages -- with guidelines for creating more.<br/>     Rules for improvising spells you don't know. Though powerful magic is hard to improvise, sometimes a cantrip is all you need.<br/>     A complete enchanting system, with rules for creating your own artifacts or buying them (with money, not points).<br/>     Plenty of GM and player advice, including &quot;Under the Hood&quot; boxes explaining important assumptions, complex builds, and more.<br/><br/><br/>GURPS Thaumatology: Sorcery puts you in complete control, giving you a potentially unlimited grimoire and as much power as you can afford.

While balancing the resources needed to advance your technology you also need to build a military. Military is built in the same way as civilian buildings. Players that have a weak military will be preyed upon by other players.

their existing collection of Super Dungeon models.  In Arena, two players each take control of a mighty warband consisting of one Hero, one mini-boss, two spawning points, and the spawning points&rsquo; associated monsters. These warbands then do battle against one another in a challenge known as a scenario. Each scenario has its own unique rules and victory conditions, which require a warband to use its abilities and strengths in new and clever ways.<br/><br/>Super Dungeon: Arena includes a beautifully illustrated rulebook, an intricately detailed double-sided game board, an Arena Champion model, and numerous cards, tokens and dice for players to battle it out head-to-head. As players construct their own warbands from any combination of Super Dungeon models or from a single warband box, Arena promises to be an exciting experience each time.<br/><br/>Super Dungeon introduced the world to the whimsy and charm of chibi-miniature board games inspired by classic video games, and it continues to be the leader in providing a fun and lighthearted family board game experience. Strongly supported with dozens of expansions which provide new Heroes, monsters, dungeon tiles, and gameplay options, Super Dungeon: Arena is sure to be fun, new edition for longtime fans and new fans of Super Dungeon!<br/><br/>CONTENTS<br/>1 Rulebook<br/>1 Arena Champion Model<br/>1 Double-sided Arena Game Board<br/>1 Sheet of Gameplay Tokens<br/>42 Treasure Cards<br/>52 Loot Cards<br/>3 Scenario Reference Cards<br/>2 Player Turn Reference Cards<br/>2 Backpack Cards<br/>7 Tile Effect Cards<br/>16 Dice: 2 Emerald, 6 Ruby, and 8 Sapphire<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": {"281543": "English first edition"}, "name": "Super Dungeon Explore: PvP Arena", "playingtime": "90", "boardgamemechanic": {"2001": "Action Point Allowance System"}, "average": "7.83333", "boardgameexpansion": {}, "usersrated": "18", "expands": {"92190": {"name": "Super Dungeon Explore"}}, "boardgamefamily": {"27826": "Super Dungeon Explore"}}, "182059": {"statistics": {}, "name": "The Regiment", "videogamemode": {"2310": "Network Multiplayer"}, "videogameversion": {"281545": "North American Windows edition"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2639065.jpg", "videogametheme": {"2508": "Military"}, "usersrated": "0", "average": "0", "videogamegenre": {"2160": "First Person Shooter"}, "videogameplatform": {"4977": "Windows"}, "poll": {}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2639065_t.jpg", "description": "Game Manual<br/><br/>Originally formed during World War II by David Stirling, the British Special Air Service [SAS] has consistently proved itself to be one of the best, most feared and respected Special Forces teams in the world.<br/><br/>The Regiment's Counter Revolutionary Warfare [CRW] team was formed in the 1970s following a terrorist attack at the 1972 Olympic Games in Munich.

Geoengineering, although dangerous and unproven, is now on the table. A world like this has no winners, but can you minimize the hardship your regions face?<br/><br/>In Geoengineering 101, you're one of two to four world leaders, and you have two parallel but sometimes competing goals: One is to minimize the hardship your regions endure from heat, drought, or flood.   The other is to fully decarbonize the world economy.  Only by eliminating all fossil fuel use can climate change be slowed and the game won. However, in the meantime, the air conditioners and pumps running on fossil fuels can shield you from the some of the impacts.<br/><br/>A world where climate change has gotten so bad that geoengineering is on the table is one without winners, only those that lose less.  There's only one way to &quot;win&quot; in Geoengineering 101: have the least amount of Hardship when all Carbon Tokens are finally removed.  There's plenty of ways to lose: having all regions destroyed by the climate going off the charts, or when all the players suffer a total of 100 Hardship - which in a typical game, is only 10-15 turns away.<br/><br/>In Geoengineering 101, you'll take turns with other players to carry out geoengineering programs or acts of deep green resistance.  There's a time delay to your actions, though: the program you initiate now doesn't come up until your next turn.  In between, other players' programs happen and if uncoordinated, can trigger side effects that cause hardship, randomize the sequence of future actions, or shift global rainfall patterns.<br/><br/>The game takes inspiration from real climate science and geoengineering ideas, as well as the political implications of different nations unilaterally or cooperatively meddling with the weather.

If the egg timer goes off during your turn, one of your golden egg cards turns rotten. The last player with at least one golden egg card wins the game.

Each player starts with three unique cards to play all the game. Each card is divided in two zones in its obverse and reverse, and each zone has one or several skills. Players play these skills to get matters to terraform planets, to recruit soldiers, to attack enemy planets, to improve their own planets, to use heroes and politics to manipulate their cards and opponents cards, to get resources, and more.<br/><br/>But players won't play only with their own cards. They can also use the opponent cards. Each time a card is played it changes its position, so possibilities are infinite. When a player uses his cards, he spins his card (from front to back) and when he uses the opponent cards, they flip the card (from up to down). In this way, new matters and skills are available to play more actions.<br/><br/>Get victory points controlling planets and use them to get more resource gems, soldiers or skills.

As if a dozen existing monsters were not enough, the alien venusi hails from a distant world of steaming acid jungles, where their psychic magic was the bane of the elven forerunner races that once sought shelter from the travails of other worlds.

Each player also starts with one extra tile, with a picture of their animal on it. The opposite side of all dreamscape tiles also has a picture of the animal. Each turn, a random card is drawn, telling players which tile they should flip. When a player flips a tile, it means their animal is traveling through a part of the dreamscape. Each player's goal is to guide their animal through the dreamscape by positioning him in a specified pattern (which is different each game).  After a card is drawn, a player takes their extra animal and slides him into the dreamscape, shifting one row or column of tiles until a new, different tile emerges from the opposite side.  The player will use this tile to shift another column or row on the next turn, and so on, until one player's dreamscape tiles match the goal.  The player then shouts their animal's name-- &quot;Dingo!&quot;, for example, to win the round.<br/><br/>Advanced rules add Hazard Tokens which increase the challenge substantially: to complete the required dream pattern, the player may not have his animal in any of the Hazard spaces marked on the dream card.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": {"281659": "English first edition"}, "average": "6.60171", "name": "Dingo's Dreams", "playingtime": "30", "boardgamemechanic": {"2011": "Modular Board"}, "age": "8", "usersrated": "438", "boardgamesubdomain": {"5499": "Family Games"}, "boardgamefamily": {"8374": "Crowdfunding: Kickstarter"}}, "182117": {"poll": {}, "name": "Picture Carousel", "playingtime": "15", "minplayers": "2", "yearpublished": "0", "usersrated": "1", "maxplayers": "6", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2623262_t.jpg", "average": "6", "statistics": {}, "boardgamepublisher": {"964": {"name": "Tactic"}}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2623262.jpg", "boardgameversion": {"281660": "English first edition"}, "maxplaytime": "15", "boardgamecategory": {"1041": {"name": "Children's Game"}}, "age": "5", "minplaytime": "15", "description": "I&acute;ts time to make the carousel spin!

There are 5 major ports: Douarnenez, Nantes, Saint-Malo, Lorient and Paimpol. Each player is native to one of the ports and their mission is to deliver all 4 commodities to the port that buys them. Each port accepts only one type of goods (for instance Nantes is the port for wine). But you cannot deliver to your own port, but to the free port of Paimpol instead (thus the Nantes player must take the wine to Paimpol). The movement of each ship is driven by the play of one card from your hand each round. There are 52 movement cards in four suits (sextant, telescope, knife and cosh) numbered 1 to 10 plus M, I, K (this is a customised poker-like deck). After playing a card you follow the instructions of how to move your ship. The goal is to deliver your cargo and bring your ship back to port.

With a second copy of the game, you can make a bigger deck to play with more players, but you start with seven cards instead of five.<br/><br/>In Kalypto, players try to eliminate each other using armies of shadows. In the box you get shadows with a strength from 1 to 10 (4 of each number), action cards like seize, extort, rise and devour (4 of each) and one very powerful candle card. To set up, shuffle the deck and deal out five cards to each player and place the deck in the center. Each player chooses at least one shadow and places it face down in front of him, this is the start of Their army. If you run out of cards in your army or hand, you lose the game. You are now ready to battle!<br/><br/>On your turn, you choose two actions to perform between four possibilities: you can draw a card from the deck and add it to your hand, you can summon a shadow from your hand that you add to your army, you can use a power card from your hand and place it in the discard pile or you can choose one of your shadows and an opponent shadow! Reveal both cards and the lowest number is sent in the discard pile. If they are the same, they are both discarded. Each action can only be done once per turn. When you've done two of these actions, your turn ends and the next player begins his turn. There are four action cards that are self explanatory: seize makes you steal one enemy shadow and add it to your army face up; Extort allows you to steal a random card from an enemy and add it to your hand; Rise allows you to draw two cards or make your opponent draw two cards (but be careful! If a player has more than seven cards in his hand, he loses!); And finally, devour allows you to choose 1 card from an enemy hand or army and discard it (which is called the pit). The candle card always matches the power of the shadow it fight, and if a player steal this card, he loses the game! If a player draws more cards than there is in the deck, he loses!
