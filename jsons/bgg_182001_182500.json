The upper level is lightly armed with one harpoon and two catapults.

In twenty solar cycles, the sun will explode and destroy everything in our solar system. Use the remaining resources of our planet to construct your ship in orbit. Build it fast. Build it strong. Build it to save as many humans as you can and launch your spaceship to the nearest exoplanet before the supernova.<br/><br/>Constructing your ship is only half the game. For those that survive the solar event and launch their ships, they must face new challenges on the way to our new exoplanet home, Earth 667C. The Journey to the new planet has boosts and perils along the way, including black holes, quasars, enemy vessels, and asteroid fields. Your ship building skills and the luck of the dice combine to determine your crew and survivors' fates. Will you be the first to Earth 667C?<br/><br/>Earth 667C is a card and turn-based tabletop game for 2-6 players or teams. Perfect for ages 10 and up, the game is fun, encourages strategic thinking, and includes just enough chance and player relationship dynamics to create three game phases with unique challenges.<br/><br/>Phase 1: Ship Building<br/>Purchase Ship Components from Space Dock, and construct the fastest ship carrying the most people. Customize your ship by doubling your navigation for better travel. Double your engineering department for increased speed. Or, add more food and life support to increase your capacity to carry survivors. Pick your strategy for your ship and start building. Optional Ship Components are available for purchase. Components like weapon systems, shuttle bays, and radiation shield provide bonuses or protection during The Journey.<br/><br/>Phase 2: Launch Your Ship<br/>When the Solar Cycle hits 8, you can launch your fully constructed spaceship. Roll the dice and aim for 12 or higher to push your ship into position for The Journey. Get 12 or lower? Then you must wait, and hope that the solar clock does not tick down any further. You must launch your ship before the clock hits zero, and the sun goes supernova.<br/><br/>Phase 3: The Journey<br/>When the clock hits zero and sun engulfs the Earth, the real Journey begins. Play a single turn journey, or an eight turn journey. Roll the dice and discover what boosts and perils await you while traveling to humanity's new exoplanet home. Encounter new enemies that attack and slow your ship, or pass a strong hydrogen cloud that boosts your engines. Utilize your optional Ship Components to ward off enemies or discover wormholes to increase your speed. This phase will put your ship building skills to the test. The events during The Journey can slow the fastest ship, and propel others to victory.<br/><br/>Be the first ship with the most survivors to reach Earth 667C and ensure the survival of the human race on our new exoplanet home!<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": ["First edition"], "age": "10", "name": "Earth 667C", "playingtime": "90", "boardgamemechanic": ["Card Drafting", "Dice Rolling"], "average": "4.70769", "usersrated": "13", "boardgamefamily": ["Admin: Unreleased Games", "Crowdfunding: Kickstarter"]}, "182296": {"rpgdesigner": ["Kristian Richards"], "rpg": ["Generic / Universal"], "poll": [], "name": "Into the Darkness: Map 0", "rpgartist": ["Kristian Richards"], "rpgproducer": ["Kristian Richards"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2626691.png", "usersrated": "0", "rpgitemversion": ["PDF version"], "average": "0", "statistics": [], "rpggenre": ["Fantasy"], "rpgpublisher": ["Crooked Staff Publishing"], "rpgcategory": ["Accessory (dice, maps, screens, cards)"], "rpgseries": ["Into the Darkness"], "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2626691_t.png", "description": "From publisher blurb:<br/><br/>Into the Darkness: Map 0 is a (free) map-pack that features a small cave map which should be suitable for inclusion in most fantasy settings.<br/><br/>This product contains:<br/><br/>    A pdf booklet featuring a labelled version of the cave.<br/>    A miniatures scaled battlemap of the cave (split over 2 pages).<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>(Into the Darkness: Map 0 is a (free) map-pack that features a small cave map which should be suitable for inclusion in most fantasy settings.<br/><br/>This product contains:<br/><br/>    A pdf booklet featuring a labelled version of the cave.<br/>    A miniatures scaled battlemap of the cave (split over 2 pages).<br/>    An unlabelled jpg image (scaled at 100 pixels per grid square) - suitable for use with VTTs.An unlabelled jpg image (scaled at 100 pixels per grid square) - suitable for use with VTTs.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>"}, "182297": {"rpgartist": ["Leo Hartas", "William Harvey", "Jon Hodgson"], "rpgitemversion": ["Softcover edition"], "poll": [], "name": "Once Upon A Time In Arabia", "rpgdesigner": ["Dave Morris"], "rpgproducer": ["(Uncredited)"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2626678.jpg", "usersrated": "0", "average": "0", "statistics": [], "rpggenre": ["Fantasy (Arabian Nights)"], "rpgpublisher": ["Fabled Lands Publishing"], "rpg": ["Virtual Reality Adventure"], "rpgcategory": ["Solitaire Adventure"], "rpgseries": ["Critical IF"], "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2626678_t.jpg", "description": "From publisher blurb:<br/><br/>Put yourself at the heart of the story&hellip;<br/><br/>Your life is in danger from a powerful enemy.

Reincarnate is a chance to roll the dice on your character&rsquo;s destiny, and the spell provides a real and tangible possibility of creating dramatic change for the creature brought back.

But the spell&rsquo;s a bit outdated, and it shows. For one, there are tons of exciting humanoid races in products released after the Pathfinder Roleplaying Game Core Rulebook that you can&rsquo;t become, because they were created after the table was made. Further, there&rsquo;s one little phrase that turns a reincarnate spell cast on anything besides a humanoid into a real pain:<br/><br/>For non-humanoid creatures, a similar table of creatures of the same type should be created.<br/><br/>If you&rsquo;ve ever had your game come to a grinding halt because your druid wanted to cast reincarnate on his animal companion, or you wish that there was a more convenient way to include all the fun new player character races in a single place, or you wish there was a teensy-weensy chance that a reincarnate could turn you into a medusa, this is the book for you. In addition to an updated set of tables for humanoid creatures, this book contains detailed nested tables for determining the new form of an animal companion, or a familiar, or a creature of any creature type. With no less than 50 tables containing creatures from Pathfinder Roleplaying Game: Advanced Race Guide and the Pathfinder Roleplaying Game Bestiaries 1 &ndash; 4, plus other sources, you have everything you need to make reincarnating any creature a fun and exciting experience. Plus, the book includes a set of optional rules for karmic reincarnation, which allows a character&rsquo;s actions in life to influence how they return.

Now, with the Enemies Without supplement for Dark Heresy Second Edition, you and your fellow Acolytes can take your places as members of the Ordo Xenos and stand against the heresy brought by these aliens from their strange stars.<br/><br/>With a new role, new home worlds, new backgrounds, and an armoury full of new weapons &ndash; both Imperial and xenos in origin &ndash; your Acolytes will be well-equipped to battle the countless threats that assault the borders of the Imperium. Your quest will not be easy. For every wicked xenos creature slain in glorious battle, three more slip past your defenses into the undefended regions of the Askellon sector.

From the rulebooks introductory text: With luck and skill the goal of this smart and at the same time educational game is to get the most traffic sign tiles. By playing the children learn to know the most important traffic signs!<br/><br/>The game has a wooden playing piece (child) moving around the gameboard. There is only one pawn for all of the players. Before the game begins all tiles are put face back on the game board. The game board then is covered by tiles with the exception of the middle spot which is the pawns starting point. The tiles depict traffic signs and come in pairs, e.g. one pair consisting of a tile for green traffic light and a tile for red light. The tile back depicts both versions green and red, the tile front only one. Players move the common playing piece around by rolling a die. When the child moves to a space where a tile is they first have to guess which picture is on the tiles front side. Two possibilities are pictured on the tile back. Upon a correct guess the player whose turn it is also has to tell the meaning of this traffic sign. If both are correct the player can keep the tile and roll again. If not correct it is the next players turn. The game ends when all tiles are taken. The player with the most tiles in his/her possession wins. <br/>The game also includes a sheet with all traffic signs in the game and what they mean.<br/><br/>"}, "182349": {"boardgamedesigner": ["Jim Burris"], "poll": [], "name": "China-Burma-India: The Lost Theater Part I \u2013 The Japanese Invade: December 1941 - May 1942", "playingtime": "360", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": ["Hex-and-Counter"], "yearpublished": "2015", "usersrated": "10", "boardgamefamily": ["Advanced Squad Leader"], "maxplayers": "2", "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2631605_t.jpg", "average": "8.1", "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["St. Louis ASL Club"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2631605.jpg", "boardgameversion": ["First edition"], "maxplaytime": "360", "boardgamecategory": ["Wargame", "World War II"], "age": "13", "minplaytime": "180", "description": "Defend Burma!<br/><br/>Can you help defend Burma from the onslaught of the Japanese conquerors?

Your task is to use Intelligence cards to influence your country into taking wise decisions. The trouble is, enemy spies have infiltrated your country and are influencing it into taking less wise decisions! Develop your culture to make it easier to spot enemy spies, improve science to get access to more elaborate cards, further your military to increase the number of spies at your disposal, or invest in economy to pay for bonus actions, known as Secret Directives.<br/><br/>Aim: There are four different types of Intelligence cards which are used to make progress on  4 corresponding development tracks. The winner of the game is the first player to reach the end of any one of these tracks. As players progress up the tracks, which each have 10 spaces, they also unlock various benefits:<br/><br/>Economy: Increases income of coins. Coins are spent on bonus actions which happen at the end of a round.<br/>Military: Increases number of spies you have. More spies means more actions can be taken in each round.<br/>Science: Makes more cards available. There are three levels of cards, at the beginning of the game, players only have access to the most basic cards.<br/>Culture: Means capturing enemy spies is easier. At the end of a round, players who have developed culture can roll one to three dice to try to capture enemy spies.<br/><br/>In addition to trying to progress on development tracks, players need to build a deck of cards made up of Intelligence cards and Action cards. Cards can be added to their deck through research actions, which allow players to take cards from a shared supply. Most of the time, cards that are played return to that players deck by reshuffling their discard pile. However, playing Intelligence cards into another player&rsquo;s country removes that card from their deck more permanently, and can also slow their opponents progress on the  development tracks.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": ["First edition"], "age": "12", "name": "Secret Directive", "playingtime": "60", "boardgamemechanic": ["Area Control / Area Influence", "Deck / Pool Building", "Worker Placement"], "average": "6.33333", "usersrated": "3", "boardgamefamily": ["Crowdfunding: Kickstarter"]}, "182389": {"boardgamedesigner": ["Richard Hutnik"], "poll": [], "name": "Trollin': The Trick-Taking Cardgame", "playingtime": "0", "minplayers": "1", "boardgamemechanic": ["Trick-taking"], "yearpublished": "2015", "usersrated": "0", "maxplayers": "6", "average": "0", "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["(Web published)"], "boardgameversion": ["First edition"], "maxplaytime": "0", "boardgamecategory": ["Card Game"], "age": "0", "minplaytime": "0", "description": "In Trollin', the object of the game is to try to take as many trick cards as possible, without taking the most cards of the poison suit.  If a player takes the most cards of the poison suit during a round/hand, they score no points for the round.<br/><br/>The game is playable with a reduced set of standard playing cards.  In the 2 player version (the game is playable for 1-6 players), players play with Ace, King, Queen, Jack, and 10 of all four suits.  The deck also uses 2 Jokers of different markings that are part of the Trump suit, which is Spades in the game, and are of greater value than the Ace, which is the highest in the trump (Cards go from high to low as Ace, King, Queen, Jack and 10).  Players are dealt 9 cards each and 4 cards are not used and are placed face down, and out of play, for the round.  As more players are added, more cards are added to the deck used.<br/><br/>The game also uses Hearts as the Poison suit.  During a round, a player who took the most Heart cards scores zero points, while their opponent scores 1 point for each trick they won.  In case of a tie for Hearts won in a trick, players score 1 point for each trick they won.<br/><br/>The game also features several optional rules, one of which is that a player can declare themselves Trollin' before the first trick is played.  If a player declares Trollin', they score as many points as the number of trick they won, and their opponent(s) score 0 for the round, IF they player managed to take all available Heart cards that could be won.  If the player declaring Trollin' fails to win all available Hearts, then they score zero points for a round and their opponent scores 1 point for each trick they won.<br/><br/>The game is played for a set number of rounds, or to a target score.

If the losing player has one or more points, he or she also has the option to avoid the humiliation at the cost of one point.<br/><br/>Finally, each player (except Player One) draws a new Character Card and a new Trait Card so they have five of each for the next round.

The historical course of events during World War II precluded any likelihood that the Germans would invade their erstwhile ally, it is conceivable that a different turn of events could have precipitated a German Blitzkrieg into Turkey. The Turks were concerned about this possibility and they endeavored to remain neutral during the war. Unlike the First World War, the Turks could not hope to hold Istanbul in the event of a war, and any incursion by one side (Axis or Allied) would certainly invite an incursion by the other. The Turks were most concerned about Soviets, but if Hitler had conceived a notion of invading Turkey, the Germans' most daunting challenge would be the Allied response, not necessarily the Turkish Army. The Turks had been underestimated during the previous world war, and so it&rsquo;s anyone&rsquo;s guess how well they could have faced up to the Wehrmacht and Luftwaffe.<br/><br/>Components: 22x34 inch map, 176 die-cut counters.<br/><br/>World at War #49, April 2016<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": ["1st edition World at War #49"], "age": "0", "name": "Operation Gertrud: The German invasion of Turkey", "playingtime": "6", "boardgamemechanic": ["Hex-and-Counter"], "average": "7.8", "usersrated": "10", "boardgamefamily": ["Country: Germany", "Country: Turkey", "Magazine: World at War"]}, "182404": {"image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3144141.jpg", "poll": [], "boardgamedesigner": ["Ty Bomba"], "statistics": [], "yearpublished": "2016", "maxplayers": "2", "boardgameartist": ["Nadir Elfarra", "Joe Youst"], "boardgamepublisher": ["Decision Games (I)"], "maxplaytime": "360", "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3144141_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "180", "boardgamecategory": ["Wargame", "World War II"], "description": "'Zhukov&rsquo;s War: The Decisive Middle Phase of the Eastern Front, July 1942 - July 1943 covers the pivotal middle period of the titanic struggle between Hitler's Germany and Stalin's USSR, from July 1942 - July 1943. Strategic options abound for both players; victory goes to the one best able to carry out the chosen strategy, while maintaining a reserve to contain sudden enemy action or exploit an opportunity. The map covers the eastern front from Leningrad to the Sea of Azov at 20 miles per hex. Turns cover one month each for most of the year, two months during winter. Most units are Soviet armies and German divisions, plus a few Axis satellite corps. The turn sequence is built around the random drawing of chits to determine which player moves. Each chit drawn allows a player to both move and attack, but with a twist. One side allows the player to move first, then attack, the other side flips the sequence. There are two twists to the mechanism. First, chits come in several varieties, with differing penalties or bonuses depending on the chit and the side chosen. Second, during certain turns, one player or the other gets bonuses, allowing selection of the first chit to open the action, and providing a different mix of chits reflecting the overall situation at that point in the war. Victory may occur at one of three times during the game; the end of the first German offensive, the end of the Soviet winter counteroffensive, and finally the end of the game, after the final German summer offensive.<br/><br/>Published in World at War magazine #50, Oct-Nov 2016.<br/><br/>Game Scale:<br/>Game Turn: 1 or 2 months<br/>Hex: 20 miles / 33 kilometers<br/>Units: Division to Army<br/><br/>Game Inventory:<br/>Two 22 x 34&quot; full color mapsheets<br/>Two dual-side printed countersheets (352 5/8&quot; counters)<br/>One 24-page Zhukov&rsquo;s War rulebook<br/><br/>Solitaire Playability: Medium<br/>Complexity Level: Medium<br/>Players: 2 or more<br/>Playing Time: 4-20<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": ["First edition"], "age": "0", "name": "Zhukov\u2019s War: The Decisive Middle Phase of the Eastern Front, July 1942 \u2013 July 1943", "playingtime": "360", "boardgamemechanic": ["Hex-and-Counter"], "average": "6.5625", "usersrated": "8", "boardgamefamily": ["Country: Russia", "Magazine: World at War"]}, "182405": {"image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3189982.jpg", "poll": [], "boardgamedesigner": ["Joseph Miranda"], "statistics": [], "yearpublished": "2016", "maxplayers": "2", "boardgameartist": ["Joe Youst"], "boardgamepublisher": ["Decision Games (I)"], "maxplaytime": "0", "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3189982_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "0", "boardgamecategory": ["Wargame", "World War II"], "description": "Pacific Battles: Malaya is a wargame series of several campaigns in the Pacific Theater of Operations in World War II.

Legendary home of fierce Ape-Men and even fiercer giant worms, which devolved from a great civilization that once worshipped the vast demon-god Tsathoggua before the first great reptiles appeared to dominate long aeons upon the Earth.<br/><br/>It is said that the collapse of that civilization caused the weird energies of Saturn&rsquo;s magnetic core. Many, but not all, of that demon-haunted culture&rsquo;s works were drawn into the planet&rsquo;s crust, there to be crushed and consumed. Even so, there is a flux to that strange magnetic attraction. Once in several thousand years, the magnetic forces wane for a period, and ships may safely approach or land upon Saturn.<br/><br/>The technomancer Satrampa, who has long made her cold dwelling upon the frozen ocean-moon Tethys, has predicted that such a time is near, and seeks adventurers willing to brave the ringed world&rsquo;s dangers. There they must locate the Vault of Zin the Meticulous. She will pay a man&rsquo;s weight in gold for the black onyx ring long-dead Zin once wore upon his right hand. Failing that, she will pay the same weight in silver for proof that the Idol of Tsathoggua which one strengthened the ancient sorcerer&rsquo;s spells is no more.<br/><br/>"}, "182420": {"rpgartist": ["Russ Nicholson"], "rpg": ["AD&D First Edition (1e) Compatible Products", "Basic D&D Compatible Product", "Original D&D Compatible Products"], "statistics": [], "name": "Wonder & Wickedness", "rpgdesigner": ["Brendan Strejcek"], "rpgproducer": ["Paolo Greco"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2941336.jpg", "usersrated": "2", "rpgitemversion": ["Softcover Version"], "average": "8.5", "rpggenre": ["Fantasy (High Fantasy)"], "rpgpublisher": ["Lost Pages"], "rpgcategory": ["Sourcebook (rules/options to enhance play)"], "poll": [], "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2941336_t.jpg", "description": "From the publisher's website:<br/><br/>A new magic system with level-less magic and rules to adapt it to your favourite fantasy RPG.<br/><br/>Support for magic duels! like in fiction!<br/><br/>Seven magic disciplines and a whole lot of new spells.

It takes hundreds of years to re-establish life as we know it on the inner worlds of our solar system. Imperial, Capitol, Bauhaus and Mishima now rule from their homes in the steaming jungles of Venus, the caverns of Mercury, the deserts of Mars and the many orbitals and asteroid homes of the solar system. Luna City is a vast neutral sprawl, many hundreds of years old, built up and over the first colony and mines.<br/><br/>A fateful exploratory mission to Pluto unleashes an ancient evil force &mdash; The Dark Symmetry &mdash; upon the thinking machines of man. As technology fails (and even fights back), mankind is beset with conspiracy and corporate intrigue from within. Dark things gather on the edges of the colonies and whilst corporate war consumes the greatest armies of man, the Dark Legion's citadels rise up throughout the worlds of the solar system and terrifying armies march out to consume all. They were defeated long ago, they will not be defeated this time...<br/><br/>As the Dark Symmetry's malign influence on humanity grows, the Brotherhood with their strange powers, arise to unite the corporate armies as one and fight back.<br/><br/>Mutant Chronicles: Techno Fantasy Roleplaying Game - 3rd Edition fills in the gaps in the original Mutant Chronicles storyline, expanding the backstory and plotting secret events that will carry your adventures through a thousand years of future history. Now you can play during the early days of the Dark Symmetry with investigations of foul cults and technology turning on mankind, through to the brutal Corporate Wars and then fight the Dark Legion as they pour forth from their citadels across the colonies.<br/><br/>For the third edition of the Mutant Chronicles roleplaying game, Jay Little, award-winning designer of Star Wars: Edge of the Empire, created a new d20 based cinematic game system to reflect the chaotic, harsh life of the universe.<br/><br/>"}, "182423": {"image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3033231.jpg", "poll": [], "boardgamedesigner": ["Whit Alexander", "Richard Tait"], "statistics": [], "yearpublished": "2013", "maxplayers": "8", "boardgameartist": ["Gary Baseman"], "boardgamepublisher": ["Cranium, Inc.", "Hasbro"], "maxplaytime": "120", "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3033231_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "30", "boardgamecategory": ["Party Game", "Puzzle", "Trivia", "Word Game"], "description": "Show off your talents and win the game of Cranium!

As fellow villains and loyal henchmen, it's up to you to orchestrate an escape!<br/><br/>This is a (mostly) cooperative board/card game for 1-4 players, in which you acquire super powers, battle heroes, and overcome obstacles to break the super-villain out of a maximum-security prison.  The game includes four (4) different prisons, with their own set-up rules, victory conditions, and defeat conditions.<br/><br/>In order to accomplish their goals, players draw a hand of 5 cards from the communal &quot;Villain&quot; deck.  These cards include Attack cards, Defense cards, and Power Surge cards.  Attack cards are played on heroes, guards, and obstacles in order to defeat them.  Defense cards are played to overcome certain obstacles, as well as protect players' hands from the hero &amp; guard abilities that otherwise make them discard cards and reduce players' effectiveness on their turns.  Power Surge cards are used to overcome certain obstacles, but more importantly are used to purchase super-powers.<br/><br/>Players can acquire different combinations of abilities, choosing from among 22 unique super powers.  These powers run the range of classic powers, including Super Strength, Time Control, Energy Blasts, and others.  Powers allow players to break or augment the normal rules of play, making their hand of cards go further and hit harder.<br/><br/>As the players defeat heroes and guards, they acquire victory points.  If the players succeed in defeating the scenario, the player with the most victory points gets bragging rights as the &quot;winner&quot;.  If the game wins, then all the players lose regardless of points, so teamwork is essential.<br/><br/>"}, "182430": {"boardgamedesigner": ["Brian Mayer"], "poll": [], "name": "Quark", "playingtime": "30", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": ["Action Point Allowance System", "Hand Management", "Set Collection"], "yearpublished": "0", "usersrated": "2", "maxplayers": "4", "average": "6.5", "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["(Web published)"], "boardgameversion": ["First edition"], "maxplaytime": "0", "boardgamecategory": ["Card Game", "Educational"], "age": "10", "minplaytime": "30", "description": "Exert your influence and guide the swirling mass of the smallest bits of matter back together to form sub-atomic particles while racing to build the biggest atom.<br/><br/>Quark is a lighter weight card game.

With only the vaguest understanding of where their adversaries lay, both high commands intended to march forward to the attack. The earlier-rising allied armies stole the initiative from the Austrians, and collided with their forward pickets before the sun had fully risen.<br/><br/>Thus began the Battle of Solferino, which would draw into the fray over 250,000 men - the largest general engagement in Europe since the Battle of Leipzig in 1813. Before the day was through, nearly 40,000 men would lay dead or wounded, and the Austrian armies would be decisively driven from the field. With the belligerent armies exhausted and alarmed by the potential expansion of the conflict, France and Austria quickly came to terms at Villafranca, ending the conflict known as the Second Italian War of Independence and placing Italy firmly on the road to unification.<br/><br/>All Are Brothers: Solferino, 1859 simulates the decisive battle of the Second Italian War of Independence at the Brigade-level, with some additional Regimental-size and smaller detachments included. National and corps-level leaders are represented, on a Rick Barber map at 500 meters per hex, with 1-hour turns. Four scenarios are included: three that separately cover the north, central, and southern sectors of the battle, as well as a combined full battle scenario. The northern sector scenario &ndash; &ldquo;San Martino&rdquo; &ndash; is the smallest in scope and serves as a nice introductory scenario to the battle and to the game&rsquo;s ruleset. The combined scenario is suitable for up to four players (France, Sardinia-Piedmont, Austrian 1st Army, and Austrian 2nd Army).<br/><br/>The battle itself was a grinding slugfest often described as a &quot;soldier's battle&quot; - a deliberate slight to the often uninspired leadership of the generals and a tribute to an allied victory gained only at the tip of the bayonet. Villagers in the surrounding region would do their best in the days after to treat the myriad wounded, and answer as to why Austrians, Hungarians, Czechs, Serbs, and Slovaks were treated as well as the Italians: &quot;Tutti fratelli&quot; (All are brothers). The battle pits two Austrian armies against the combined forces of France and Sardinia-Piedmont, and features the full panoply of colorful period units - Jagers and Grenzers, massed cavalry divisions of all types, Bersaglieri, French Imperial Guard, and the French African Zouaves and Turcos. Advances in infantry and artillery firepower would soon make the tactics of the time obsolete, and the carnage at Solferino reflected the start of this paradigm shift, soon to be highlighted bloodily by the Austro-Prussian and Franco-Prussian wars.<br/><br/>This treatment of Solferino features an adaptation of Hermann Luttmann&rsquo;s Blind Swords system (At Any Cost, Hammerin' Sickles, Stonewall's Sword) as the core ruleset. The system is heavy on unpredictability and fog of war due to the chit pull mechanic. The chit pull mechanic also very much aids in solitaire play, as does variable activation rules and reinforcement tables. A number of other features help make face-to-face play attractive, including the Strategic Initiative system, a number of scenario variants and optional rules, the optional Encounter Battle system (focusing on altering starting and reinforcement conditions to allow the course of the battle to develop differently than in the historical case), and the move-and-countermove event chit play. Nation-specific event chits also inject some period flavor.<br/><br/>"}, "182481": {"poll": [], "name": "Mit dem Auto aufs Land", "playingtime": "0", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": ["Point to Point Movement", "Roll / Spin and Move"], "yearpublished": "0", "usersrated": "0", "maxplayers": "5", "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2633455_t.jpg", "average": "0", "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["Vedes"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2633455.jpg", "boardgameversion": ["Vedes edition"], "maxplaytime": "0", "boardgamecategory": ["Racing", "Travel"], "age": "0", "minplaytime": "0", "description": "The players have to get from space 1 to space 120.

Whether crafted to maximize tranquil contemplation or to bring elegance to bloody executions, craftsmanship is devoted in equal measure to the appearance of an item as to its mechanical effects. Whether PCs are themselves native to Asian-inspired fantasy kingdoms or are outlanders venturing into strange and foreign kingdoms and empires in search of wealth and glory in a land far from that of their birth, they may wrest these treasures from the dusty tombs of exiles and emperors, uncover them in the kami-haunted spirit-forests that blanket the land, or wrest them from the hoards and hands of oni, bakemono, weretigers, nagas, and wingless sovereign dragons. This tome contains items perfect for followers of the paths of peace or the ways of war, from the teapot of serenity and feathered mat of paradise to the stalking serpent, typhoon fan, and beheading blade. There are items of great practical utility like the ink set of shifting, ki capstan, and samisen of the seven spheres, from the simple alchemical kokowai salve up to the divine artifacts known as the lucky mallets. Some items carry great power but potential danger, like the malicious skull and the circlet of the imperial dragon, while others bring great beauty alongside deadly efficiency, like the sovereign lungguang, kimono of the honored ancestors, rod of the monkey king, and the biting blade of ten thousand blossoms.

These items are perfect fodder for tomb robbers of every stripe, uncovering long-lost ruins once hidden by the sands or forbidden to outsiders, but now ready to join a daring rush into the dangerous marketplace of artifacts and antiquities. From glittering gold and lush lapis to alabaster, ivory, papyrus, and faience, the treasures of the pharaonic kingdom fire the imagination of treasure hunters the world over, who stand ready to defy mummy guardians, swarming scarabs, and eldritch curses that threaten doom upon any who would violate their sacred burial spaces. Their rest disturbed, tyrants and terrors that have long slumbered may rise to bring ruin upon lands that had forgotten them, but no warning or risk is too great when the plunder of dynasties awaits just behind the next dune. This tome contains treasures of great value to tomb robbers and guardians alike, like the map cartouche and tomb warden's stele, along with deadly weapons like the scarab scourge and dune trap javelin to protective gear like the dynast aegis and mail of the radiant pharaoh. These items are redolent with the mysteries and magic of the desert, like the oasis mirror and faience idols to the alabaster icons of Bast and the canopic chest of eternal repose!

While a handful of weapons exist to punish a player who has put all his victory points in one basket, it is often not an efficient use of time or resources to pursue hostilities.<br/><br/>The game progresses through events called solar instabilities.  Each die roll has a chance to produce one or more of these events.  As more and more of these events occur, the player's home base, Stardock, slowly moves further and further away from the unstable star.  When the Stardock reaches the last planet in the system, it prepares to leave and does so immediately before the star explodes.<br/><br/>The game ends when either the star goes supernova (harming any players still left in the solar system) or every player safely leaves before that point.  The winner is the player who has accumulated the most victory points through collecting money, crew, modifications, and research samples.<br/><br/>"}, "182011": {"boardgamedesigner": ["Timothy B.

Each player attempts to build the best civilization through careful resource management, discovering new technologies, electing the right leaders, building wonders and maintaining a strong military. Weakness in any area can be exploited by your opponents. The game takes place throughout the ages beginning in the age of antiquity and ending in the modern age.<br/><br/>One of the primary mechanisms in TTA is card drafting. Technologies, wonders, and leaders come into play and become easier to draft the longer they are in play. In order to use a technology you will need enough science to discover it, enough food to create a population to man it and enough resources (ore) to build the building to use it. While balancing the resources needed to advance your technology you also need to build a military. Military is built in the same way as civilian buildings.

Each player assume the role of a Germanic warlord leading his warriors into Roman provinces, which lie across the Rhine and Danube rivers. The Roman Empire is still too strong to be conquered, but its fields and cities provide loot for your warriors, and its armies give you an excellent opportunity to prove yourself as a worthy leader and, by doing so, to achieve eternal glory for yourself.

You and an opponent represent friendly, rival stable owners, who train and race horses for fun and profit. On this racing day you both have a lot of horses at the track, and you&rsquo;re focusing on bragging rights. Which one of you is the better judge of horseflesh&mdash;and which stable will win the most races and side bets? Playable in 30 minutes to an hour, Stabling Rivalry will provide the thundering excitement of the sport of kings&mdash;and the ultimate answer!<br/><br/>From his stable of horses, each player selects one for each race. During play, a player draws a card from a small display of action cards and then plays one from his hand. If it matches the color required on his horse&rsquo;s card for the current furlong, its normal value is used. (If not, it is played &quot;penalty-side&quot; up-- with a lesser value.)<br/><br/>The cards played each furlong are totaled throughout the race. If tied at the start of a furlong, initial post position breaks it. Class markers allow a player to re-draw a card-- to help himself or to hinder his opponent. Additionally, players can &quot;jockey for position&quot; and sometimes &quot;dump&quot; the face-up cards of the display; the leader and other player have separate criteria for this.<br/><br/>After both players have played a card for the current furlong, the top card of a special deck representing the other horses in the race is turned face-up. Some of these cards have various effects in addition to their numerical value, while others have two possible values and one of the players will have to choose which to play.<br/><br/>After all furlongs have been played in a race, the horse with the most total value wins. Class markers and then post position breaks ties between players.

These damaged, over-worked, and under-paid officers must keep paranormal activity in Detroit under wraps and out of sight. No mean feat in a city as old, large, and haunted as Detroit.<br/><br/>Corktown officers face constant threats from mundane crime, paranormal forces, as well as their inner demons and growing madness. Do they have what it takes? Can they stand against the growing threats, or will they be consumed, along with the city they guard?<br/><br/>The Thin Blue Line is a modern horror setting that requires the Savage Worlds Core Rulebook and the Savage Worlds Horror Companion for use.<br/><br/>This PDF uses layers for ease of printing.<br/><br/>Please note that this version of The Thin Blue Line - A Detroit Police Story omits detailed information on the setting's NPCs, paranormal creatures, adventures and an adventure generator, and cursed items.

Each port accepts only one type of goods (for instance Nantes is the port for wine). But you cannot deliver to your own port, but to the free port of Paimpol instead (thus the Nantes player must take the wine to Paimpol). The movement of each ship is driven by the play of one card from your hand each round. There are 52 movement cards in four suits (sextant, telescope, knife and cosh) numbered 1 to 10 plus M, I, K (this is a customised poker-like deck).

Reveal both cards and the lowest number is sent in the discard pile. If they are the same, they are both discarded. Each action can only be done once per turn.

If a player has more than seven cards in his hand, he loses!); And finally, devour allows you to choose 1 card from an enemy hand or army and discard it (which is called the pit).

Each Location has an Explore value (the number of cards you will get to pick from next turn when you explore), and one or more icons. The icons determine what happens to you on your turn. A camp icon means you get to rest, heal and change your equipment. An Event icon means you draw an Event card and follow the instructions (this will be a change in weather or a roadside encounter). A town icon means you generate a town (draw 3 cards) and choose one townsfolk to interact with from the town. A monster icon means you draw a card and battle the monster on it. If you win, you will earn treasure!<br/><br/>Complete three quests before you run out of Resolve or Health and you win. Run out of resolve, and you retire... run out of Health and you will meet an unfortunate end.<br/><br/>The game requires a minimum of 7 pages of cards to be printed and cut out.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "1", "boardgameversion": ["First edition"], "age": "12", "name": "Pocket Adventure", "playingtime": "45", "boardgamemechanic": ["Hand Management"], "average": "7", "usersrated": "3", "boardgamefamily": ["Solitaire Print and Play Contest"]}, "182251": {"rpgdesigner": ["Simon Berman", "Craig Campbell", "Matthew Goetz", "Daniel Marthaler", "Zachary C.

Assumptions cards have red backs, and simple text on the front. Some are ridiculous, some are serious.<br/>     Player A draws a black character card from the pile without looking, revealing it to everyone else. Closing your eyes works. Holding it to your forehead works. So does holding it out in front of you.<br/>     Everyone else plays a red assumption card from their hand about the revealed character by putting it face-down. Players draw a new assumption card from the red pile so everyone's hands contain 7 cards.<br/>     Player A, with the character card still a mystery, flips the played  assumptions cards one at a time, reading them aloud (and inherently drawing their own assumptions about the character they haven't seen yet). Then, FINNNALLLLY, they get to flip their character card. Lol.<br/>     Player A picks the assumption they think best fits the character. The person who played the chosen assumption is the winner, and keeps the character card, collecting it as a point earned.<br/>     That's it! Rotate Player A and repeat. The game ends when X points are reached, or Y time has passed (you make up these numbers), or everyone hates each other. Preferably, before this last one happens.
