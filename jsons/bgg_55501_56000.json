You either survived or didn&rsquo;t, but either way most of you probably didn&rsquo;t play past that single adventure. But did you ever wonder just what happened to Camp Trepidation after the initial zombie attack? Jerry, the original author, sure did. Fire in the Hole is his answer.<br/><br/>Fire in the Hole picks up with the US Army setting up perimeter around Camp Trepidation and sending in a recon team (that would be you) on foot to investigate. This time you&rsquo;ll have the resources of the US military (within reason) at your disposal, but don&rsquo;t count on it being a cakewalk. Something has gained a toehold in Camp Trepidation, and it has no intention of leaving.<br/><br/>In addition to the recon mission, Fire in the Hole features an adventure generator, mission profiles, and more! Use Fire in the Hole as a one-night military horror adventure, or just the beginning of a months-long military campaign against the evil that threatens to overwhelm the entire world. We give you the tools, you choose how they are used.<br/>    * 12 new fully-statted creatures.<br/>    * New weaponry and high-tech enhancements<br/>    * 11 page campaign kickoff adventure Fire in the Hole.<br/>    * A mission generator for keeping the action going.<br/>    * 20 mission seeds.<br/>    * Printer-friendly version also included.<br/><br/>Still not convinced? Read a review from RPG Resource.<br/><br/>Want to ratchet up the action yet another notch? Check out Flatlands: Fire for Effect, a set of tiles and tokens designed for use with Fire in the Hole. With Fire for Effect, you get a set of soldier tokens, all the creature tokens, and a set of tiles designed just for Fire in the Hole.<br/><br/>"}, "55503": {"rpgdesigner": ["Mike Bridges", "Creighton Broadhurst", "Victor Caminha", "Rick Miller"], "statistics": [], "name": "The Oerth Journal (Issue 18 - Jan 2006)", "rpgartist": ["Mike Bridges", "Rick Miller", "Jerry Minor"], "rpgproducer": ["Mike Bridges", "Nathan Irving", "Brian McRae", "Rick Miller", "Stylianos Scarlatos", "Samuel D.

Sims and first published in 1990. The game's tagline is Roleplaying in a dangerous future. The Battlelords of the Twenty-Third Century license was later sold by Optimus Design Systems (ODS) to SSDC, Inc. in September 1999.<br/><br/>Battlelords of the Twenty-Third Century is set in the year 2279. The territory of the Galactic Alliance, spanning several galaxies, is the primary setting for the game. The Galactic Alliance is made up of twelve races (including Humans), and is run behind the scenes by huge mega-corporations seeking to exploit the farthest reaches of space.<br/><br/>Player characters usually assume the role of Battlelords, mercenaries employed by the corporations to further their business by any means, legal or otherwise. They face various challenges, including rival mercenaries, Rebels, hostile alien lifeforms on unexplored worlds, and the alien race known as the Arachnids.&quot;<br/><br/>From the publisher &quot;Battlelords of the Twenty-Third Century is a deep space roleplaying system that focuses on the Alliance of 27 alien races who desperately seek to ward off the threat of internal destruction while simultaneously exploring the vast uncharted regions of space. For the Battlelord, loyalty is to the company, yet corporate devotion never exceeds allegiance to your friends. The mercenary team embodies everything that is valued in society: esprit de corps, honor, and valor. At least that is what the papers say! Your job is a simple one, do anything and everything to stay alive. The company gets all the press. You get to pick up a paycheck. No one cares about methods, but in the 23rd century, everybody needs a hero! It is a battlefield without boundaries, a cemetery without grounds. It is a land whose beauty is shrouded in mystery and danger. Space offers up its treasures only to those brave enough to challenge themselves.

Maybe it's time. The Risus Companion is 64 pages of concentrated Risus oddness, reflecting years of Internet feedback and even more years of my personal Risus campaigns. It's illustrated throughout with the same kind of high-quality illustrations you'll find in Risus itself. Just a few of its many features:<br/><br/>    Articles on the ins and outs of character design, including Anatomy of a Clich&eacute;, and sidebars exploring the &ldquo;core clich&eacute;s&rdquo; of adventure fiction.<br/>    The Megaversal Omnigroovy Background Machine, which will, in just a few die rolls, tell you why your Irish Shinto Minotaur Astronaut (4) decided to enlist in the Star Patrol.<br/>    An extensive section on squeezing the most juice from the simple Risus mechanics, including the secrets of the Unholy Trinity, the dangers of vending machines, and the many ways there are to carve up a conflict in Risus.<br/>    Many amusing Player/GM dialogues, taken directly from real life (as S. John Ross imagines it to be).<br/>    Expanded discussions on the minutest aspects of the game, from special equipment to the use of magic.<br/>    Evil GMing tips for Evil GMs. Plus, Evil GMing tips for Less Evil GMs to help them become more Evil.<br/>    Tools and techniques for Risus adventure design, including Rocky Roads, and the official Risus Adventure Matrix. Bonus toys include a random fantasy world generator - one every bit as detailed and comprehensive as you'd expect from Risus.<br/>    Fans of the Big List of RPG Plots will be pleased to discover one of its lost cousins, the Big List of Dirty Little Thrills, an adventure-design checklist that cuts to the heart of what's really satisfying in a game.<br/>    A collection of new Advanced Options, including Eye of the Tiger(rules for forcing montage sequences), Lucky Shots &amp; Questing Dice, and Strip Risus.<br/>    Mrs. Butterbread's secret banana-pumpkin bread recipe.<br/>    A lexicon of Risus terms to help you cut through the tangle of complicated rules and systems.<br/>    How to Draw Stick Figures, the Risus Way. 'Nuff said, True Believer!<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>If Risus confuses you, the Risus Companion will enhance that experience tenfold. If Risus amuses you, the Risus Companion will take more than ten times as many pages to do pretty much exactly the same thing. It's that cool. More important (much, much more important) when you buy the Risus Companion, you're also joining the International Order of Risus, the worldwide Risus fan-club/world-domination conspiracy of love.

Users are invited to convert and use the adventure with whatever rules systems they prefer. One of the problems with designing adventures for older editions of Dungeons and Dragons is that there is great variation in rule sets.

There have been a number of games that have utilized toys as playing pieces in the past.  Where SqueakQuest differs is that it toes a slightly darker, more serious line than those other games.  You&rsquo;re a grown-up who plays with toys; your toys should have more grown-up adventures.  Which is not to say that this is some dreary, &ldquo;mature&rdquo;, angst-ridden exercise in nihilism.  They&rsquo;re still toys after all and there&rsquo;s a great deal of humor to be found herein.  What&rsquo;s important is that despite the humor, it&rsquo;s all very deadly serious to your toy.<br/><br/>Remember playing with toys as a kid?  You may not have had the deepest plots or most intricate storylines, but whatever your toy did, it mattered.  Whether it was GI Joe wiping out Cobra or Barbie going out on a date, or pirate adventures with your rubber duckie, the point is that you were really identifying with the toy and the things it was doing.  Your imagination made the stories come to life and they were just as important as anything that you were doing on the playground.<br/><br/>We&rsquo;re going to try and use this game to recapture some of that &ldquo;play intensity&rdquo; and along the way, don&rsquo;t be surprised if some rather odd, but rewarding storytelling comes out of it.<br/><br/>"}, "55658": {"boardgamedesigner": ["John Lewis (I)", "Bill Rutherford"], "poll": [], "name": "Hit the Dirt: WWII scenarios for Crossfire", "playingtime": "0", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": ["Area-Impulse", "Dice Rolling"], "yearpublished": "1996", "boardgameexpansion": [], "usersrated": "5", "boardgamesubdomain": ["Wargames"], "maxplayers": "6", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic551784_t.jpg", "average": "7.3", "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["Quantum Printing"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic551784.jpg", "maxplaytime": "0", "boardgamecategory": ["Miniatures", "Wargame", "World War II"], "age": "0", "minplaytime": "0", "description": "21 scenarios (from 1941 to 1945) to use with the CROSSFIRE rules, or with any other set of rules  for WWII miniatures at squad level.<br/><br/>It includes also new special rules for night fighting, new terrain types, bogging down of vehicles, indirect fire on vehicles, direct fire mortars and the &quot;timing clock&quot; (a mechanic to vary the intensity and pace of a scenario).<br/><br/>"}, "55659": {"rpgdesigner": ["Jeff Barber", "Robert Vaughn"], "rpgitemversion": ["PDF Version", "Softcover Version"], "poll": [], "name": "Crown of Shadow", "rpgartist": ["Ed Bourelle", "Anthony Hightower", "Anneth Lagamo", "Brian Schomburg", "J.

(A player can never claim more cubes than the number of remaining rounds).<br/><br/>Players rotate their ship's wheels each round, then use the cubes available to them in that round to perform various actions: activating cards selected in that round or earlier rounds, buying city quarters and collecting the goods located there, moving that player's ship around Europe to deliver those goods, acquiring gold coins, taking special actions with card previously activated, and advancing on a turn order track.<br/><br/>Players score points by delivering goods, paying gold coins, using the powers on their cards, and building in Macao.

Set in a unique nightmarish world devoid of most natural resources, you control a settlement at the dawn of its existence. Fight monsters, craft weapons and gear, and develop your settlement to ensure your survival from generation to generation.<br/><br/>Campaign System<br/>Embark alone or with up to 3 friends (5 with game variant) on a 5-30-lantern-year campaign, with each year consisting of a cycle of hunt, showdown, and settlement phases. The settlement phase is an intricate civilization building game in which you spend very limited resources to build buildings, research new technologies, train your warriors, and set up your strategy for survival.  During the hunt, you'll encounter a series of stories in a &quot;choose your own adventure&quot; style journey through various events and encounters.  Finally, when you meet the monster you're pursuing, you'll engage it in an a massive arena-style battle where only one party is going to survive.  If your party lives, you'll be able to bring the spoils back home to use in expanding your settlement.<br/><br/>Monster AI System<br/>Each of the 7 monsters included are controlled by their own pair of decks that scale to 3 levels of difficulty (except for the final encounter, which has only 1 level and it's HARD!). Every encounter, even with the same monster, is highly variable and no two showdowns will resolve the same way. Players will have to plan their gear and keep their minds sharp to prevail.<br/><br/>Gear System<br/>In Kingdom Death: Monster, survivors will craft gear from resources earned from defeating monsters or found on their hunt. Each survivor has a 3x3 gear grid. Selection and arrangement of your gear cards is critical, as many provided bonuses and activate special rules when aligned correctly.<br/><br/>Story Event System<br/>40+ Story Events plus over 100 hunt encounters will shape and guide your campaign. Story Events detail important evolutions in your civilization, introduce new monsters, and provide rich detail for your campaign.  Some will trigger automatically as you progress through the campaign, but most will be entirely based on choices players make.<br/><br/>Story Events cover everything from setting up and fighting a monster to key events that happen within the overall story. Some are triggered directly from the timeline and others from choices you make in game.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "1", "boardgameversion": ["English first edition", "English second \"1.5\" edition"], "average": "8.90724", "name": "Kingdom Death: Monster", "playingtime": "180", "boardgamemechanic": ["Co-operative Play", "Dice Rolling", "Grid Movement", "Role Playing", "Storytelling"], "age": "17", "boardgameexpansion": ["157658", "217710", "164138", "226222", "164135", "219134", "164139", "226220", "226491", "216473", "217762", "219248", "219139", "135034", "135179", "226218", "219257", "217709", "135030", "216466", "215370", "182095", "135036", "219135", "195317", "216471", "217784", "219177", "217711", "187893", "135872", "219141", "135712", "135037", "136135", "135035", "135973", "136133", "136104", "136017", "226225", "216467", "216468", "216469", "219250", "164140", "226215", "226223", "216476", "219247", "136137", "164141", "135273", "135523", "219251", "164137", "164136", "219181", "226221", "226216", "172556"], "usersrated": "1998", "boardgamesubdomain": ["Thematic Games"], "boardgamefamily": ["Campaign Games", "Crowdfunding: Kickstarter", "Kingdom Death", "Solitaire Games"], "boardgamepodcastepisode": ["Cult of the New Board Game Podcast Episode 034 \u2013 New Releases, News, Kickstarters, Conventions", "Ep 23 Board Game Design With Steve Avery", "Episode 16 - Calvin Wong And Forbidden Stars Review", "Episode 20: TatterCon 2015!", "Episode 28 - Kingdom Death Monster Introduction", "Episode 58- Dead of Winter and Horror Board Games", "Episode 67- Kingdom Death: Monster and Women Representations in Games", "Episode 79- Junk Art and GenCon 2016, CONTEST!", "Episode 87- Haspelknecht", "HLG 14: Scythe &amp; Wesley Fechter", "Sweet Strats Episode 4: Chaos in the Old World"]}, "55691": {"rpgartist": ["Rob Prior"], "rpgitemversion": ["\"1st White Book\"", "\"Arlington Edition\""], "poll": [], "name": "Battlelords of the Twenty-Third Century (1st Edition)", "rpgdesigner": ["Larry Ray Sims"], "rpgproducer": ["(Uncredited)"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic551604.jpg", "usersrated": "1", "average": "5", "statistics": [], "rpg": ["Battlelords of the Twenty-Third Century (1st & 2nd Editions)"], "rpgpublisher": ["Optimus Design Systems"], "rpgcategory": ["Core Rules (min needed to play)"], "rpggenre": ["Corporations", "Science Fiction (Space Opera)"], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic551604_t.jpg", "description": "&quot; &quot;Battlelords of the Twenty-Third Century is a paper and pencil science fiction role-playing game designed by Lawrence R.

You earn a point by reaching certain numbers along tracks, such as at least 7 on the influence track or 8 on the majority track. You also may earn a point by beating your secretly assigned archenemy on three specified tracks.<br/><br/>The game lasts a number of rounds, with each round consisting of a directors' meeting, followed by 4-7 turns. At the meeting, the &quot;company chairman&quot; is replaced (the next token in line moves up) and the &quot;division heads&quot; are named (by seeing who has the majority in each column of placed cubes). Chairmen and heads get salary bonuses and a card detailing a single advantage for the cardholder.<br/><br/>The player who's the &quot;communications&quot; head then secretly looks at the Event cards and determines in which order they will be played (and so how many turns will be in the current round). Other heads' cards will let them pay less for stocks, for example, or place or remove bits.<br/><br/>After each event card is revealed, players select one action to perform, such as &quot;hiring and relocating employees&quot; (placing or moving cubes), resigning as a department head, using an advantage card, or bribing players for their advantage cards. These actions result in points on the scoring tracks and sometimes money (which is only used for bribery and buying blocks of stock). A bribed card has more power than an earned one, giving incentive to accept bribes (the card is less useful or even useless to the original owner, depending on the workers' happiness scale). In addition to bribery getting you a power you want, it also moves you up the corruption track. A player who rejects a bribe, however, loses one cube on the majority columns.<br/><br/>It's not a business simulation, and gameplay isn't as dastardly as the theme implies. The event cards provide most of the humor. (The card may read that you have failed to fix the breakroom game table, or vacations were canceled, so worker satisfaction goes down, which is what you want). The feel of rising through the ranks (getting more points) is there, and there are many things to attempt to excel in, by doing various business-related (at least in name) actions. Efficient manipulating of your opportunities will win you victory points and, if you gain four, the game.<br/><br/>Awards: <br/>Machtspiele (Power $truggle) is derived from &quot;Die Firma&quot;, which won a special prize in the 2009 Hippodice game design competition for best full-length game.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "3", "boardgameversion": ["eggertspiele English First Edition", "eggertspiele German first edition", "IELLO French edition", "Z-Man Games edition"], "name": "Power Struggle", "playingtime": "105", "boardgamemechanic": ["Area Control / Area Influence", "Variable Player Powers"], "age": "12", "usersrated": "2046", "boardgamesubdomain": ["Strategy Games"], "average": "7.04762", "boardgamepodcastepisode": ["Episode 002", "Episode 26: Star Wars Rebellion Review - Brawlers Maul", "OBG 101: The Decision Horizon"]}, "55698": {"rpgartist": ["John Bingham", "Joseph J.

Colorful lights and unusual sounds often emanated from his prominent castle in the center of the town of Waldmitte. Although Alastair was of wealthy means, he often strolled the streets of town, frequenting the local establishments. It was in this way that he met and fell in love with Alice Walmesley, who worked in her father&rsquo;s potion shop, The Blue Bottle.<br/><br/>After an appropriate time of courting, Alastair wished to ask for Alice&rsquo;s hand in marriage but felt he lacked the perfect engagement gift. He left on a quest for a Star Ruby, as it is a symbol of luck and also signifies the infinite heavens from which he felt Alice must have come. He wrote Alice often, telling of his adventures and ever-increasing wealth.<br/><br/>After two years, the letters stopped. Alice waited anxiously for word of her loved one for a year, but none came. Finally she gave up and accepted an offer of marriage from Erasmus Pember, the weapons shop owner.<br/><br/>Before these nuptials could occur, however, Alastair returned to Waldmitte. Upon learning of his bride-to-be&rsquo;s engagement, he flew into a rage, killed both Alice and Erasmus, gathered his riches, and fled from Waldmitte with the bodies. The townspeople gave up searching for the wizard long ago. Legend has it Alastair is hiding in the catacombs called &ldquo;Todesheim&rdquo; to the south of Waldmitte, bemoaning his loss and casting untoward spells on the bodies in an attempt to bring them back to life. Adventurous types sometimes come seeking the three, and more importantly Alastair&rsquo;s missing wealth, but none have succeeded.<br/><br/>"}, "55770": {"rpgdesigner": ["Chris Avellone", "Brian Curley", "John Desmarais", "Bruce Harlick", "Steven S.

The game covers the Nanboku-cho period of Japanese history and simulates one of the most dynamic and important periods in Japanese history.<br/><br/>From 1336-1392, all of Japan was aflame with war. After the fall of a corrupt and ineffective emperor, the two great courts of Japan dueled to determine the future ruler of the country. Warriors of Japan covers the vital period following the destruction of the Kamakura shogunate and the fight to find a successor.<br/><br/>Players of Warriors of God will find much familiar here, however, unlike the enormous time period covered in Warriors of God, Warriors of Japan covers only 4 years. Subtle changes in the system to cover this unique period have been exchanged in Warriors of Japan. For example, Leaders no longer die from old age but rather can switch sides unexpectedly during a combat. Subtle changes in the movement and combat rules will add to the strategy to a greater extent than in Warriors of God. A random game start generator will keep each game fresh and interesting. Warriors of Japan also brings us home to our wargaming roots.

The adventures are designed with novice players and dungeon masters (DMs) in mind; more experienced gamers may find the action too scripted, the dangers too forgiving, and the plot too linear for their tastes. In such a case, the DM is encouraged to expand, revise, and delete as necessary.<br/><br/>It is the author&rsquo;s intent that this module be easily integrated into an ongoing campaign. Background information, such as a history of the area and the names and personalities of non-player characters (NPCs), are provided for DMs that are relatively inexperienced or pressed for preparation time, but the best use of these scenarios involves the DM changing the names of locales and NPCs, then dropping the whole setting into an area of her campaign world; any frontier area near mountains with wooded foothills would be suitable.<br/><br/>Each of the five adventures was designed to be played within a six-to-eight-hour time frame. The town should be explored thoroughly enough to meet the major NPCs, and scenarios should be played in the order presented; these suggestions are made because the actions of the player characters (PCs) and events they witness will have an impact on the playability or believability of the later adventures.<br/><br/>"}, "55849": {"rpgartist": ["Abrar Ajmal", "Patrick Ballestros", "Nate Barnes", "Joel Biske", "Dan Bryce", "Steve Ellis (I)", "Daerick Gross", "Steve Hough", "Mark Jelfo", "Michel Koch", "Doug Kovacs", "Rob Lee", "Matt Morrow", "William O'Connor", "Ted Pendergraft", "jim pinto"], "rpg": ["Edge of Midnight"], "statistics": [], "name": "The Edge of Midnight", "rpgdesigner": ["Martin Hall", "Kevin Millard", "Ree Soesbee", "Rob Vaux"], "rpgproducer": ["Marshall Smith", "D.

What you are reading right now is the first in a series of modules that takes place in Karathfen, a small, backwater province of the declining Empire of Hothrondor. While later modules will reveal much more about the setting, The Stronghold of Arolon is suitably generic to fit into any campaign world with ease. This module is to serve as an introduction to new players and new characters alike and has been designed with the intent of being the party&rsquo;s first major excursion into the dangerous, yet profitable, world of adventuring.<br/><br/>A party of 4-6 first level PCs should be apt to handle The Stronghold with the amount of challenge that was intended. It is my hope that this adventure emulates classic designs while still applying modern, practical adventure design theory. Consequently the adventure is deadly indeed, ripe with opportunity for PC death. This should not be disheartening to the players, but should reaffirm just why not many folks take up the adventuring path. It would be a good idea to inform players before hand that they will be challenged, but a party that works together, play smart, and picks up the clues should have little trouble besting the adventure.<br/><br/>That said, feel free to scale the module as you wish. Too deadly? Remove some of the monsters. Too much treasure? Take some of it away. None of it is crucial for success, but is merely a reward for a game well played. I imagine I&rsquo;m preaching to the choir about this, but do what you need to do to make this adventure yours. An adventure with a touch of personal detail is an adventure well remembered!<br/><br/>While this was designed for use with Old D&amp;D (BECM or Rules Cyclopedia), I think you&rsquo;ll find that it can be easily translated to 1E/2E AD&amp;D and Hackmaster.<br/><br/>However you play, have fun!

Lost and forgotten beneath Ionia are the artefacts and treasures of the Olympian gods, harkening back to the Age of Heroes when Zeus, Ares and Athena walked the earth in disguise, when heroes like Achilles fought with magical invulnerability, when witches like Medea ruled secret enchanted islands.<br/>Today there are adventurers who seek out the magical artefacts of the gods. They search for secret ways into the Underworld, hunt for clues to the location of magical swords or helmets, and dig into tombs and under cities for hidden catacombs and labyrinths. Who would not be tempted by the famous Shield of Achilles? Or the Skin of the Nemean Lion? The Bow of Paris? The teeth of the Colchian Dragon? The Girdle of Hypolyte? The list is an endless one. Fantastic treasures, imbued with awesome powers await the brave and adventurous.<br/>Of course the search is never easy. Myths and Legends give clues to the artefacts&rsquo; whereabouts, and the universities scattered about Ionia provide wonderful opportunities for research and fact-finding, but the adventurers have rivals. Every Emperor since the magician-King Tiberius has coveted these amazing artefacts. Imperial agents are at work in Ionia, stealing important scrolls and breaking into long-dead tombs. In the hands of the Emperor these divine weapons and items would turn him into a living god, a divine monster with the powers of Zeus on earth. Imperial savagery and tyranny would bring out a hell on earth for every citizen.<br/>The meaning of this &ldquo;Campaign Guide&rdquo; - or call it a &ldquo;Sourcebook&rdquo; if you want to - is giving the players and the gamemaster alike, some information on adventuring in the environment of the Classical Civilizations. In this particular case we will take a &lsquo;closer look&rsquo; at Ionia. This geographically by mountain ranges devided land was the birthplace to a great nation; in fact one of the greatest and most civilized the world has ever known for it was indeed the cradle of human civilization. The greatness of the Empire was for a (big) part also the realisation of Ionia itself.

So much has happened since I've begn working on the &quot;Book of Beings&quot;.  That's such an understatement.  Where did it all begin?  The summer of 1981!  I was eleven, and discovered the joy of making my own monsters for a totally cool game called &quot;Dungeons and Dragons&quot;.  This book spans my whole life.<br/><br/>Somehow, as a weird little artist, I had always been interested in the alphabet.  I memorized it backwards.  I made up my own fonts (I still do!).  And when I first picked up the Monster Manual and saw what was basically an alphabet book of mostly-fictitious monsters, featuring the most amazing illustrations I'd ever see, I was hooked!  I'd turn to theX page and read about the Xorn over and over, thinking, &quot;This Gygax guy is just as messed up as I am!&quot;  I mean, finally, something that started with X other than Xylophone!  So my first monster was &quot;Xvex&quot;, an impossibly large, ridiculously powerful lizard thing.  And my &quot;Book of Beings&quot; was born.<br/><br/>Just about every creeping, crawling thing in this truly monstrous tome is based on an idea from the fiery, creative boom of my youth.  Sometimes my brother Steve, or a childhood friend would make one, too.  And while there's 109 original monsters in here, I've also got another 400 or so in my closet that you'd thank me for not choosing to share.  I even made monster stats for Superman and Voltron.

For example, Cao Cao starts the game at Chen Liu and owning that deed.<br/>             In addition, the colored set corresponding to the starting property of that pawn is also free to purchase for that pawn when landing on it. For example, Cao Cao can buy any blue property (including Chen Liu if he ever lost it, Shou Chun, or Xia Pi) for free when landing on it and no one owns it.<br/>        <br/>         No bonus for completing a colored set.<br/>             Unlike monopoly, you can start building &quot;houses&quot; (camps in this game) even w/o collecting a complete colored set.

Money paid for maintenance goes to the shrine space.<br/>        <br/>         Go to Jail space replaced by a Disaster Aid space. <br/>             Each player pays 10% rounded down to the nearest 100 taels of their current cash on hand to the shrine space.  <br/>             The player that pays the MOST money from this gets a free camp built on a property of their choice.<br/>        <br/>         Community Chest cards are called Secret Pouches (ala Zhuge Liang) and are generally somewhat more powerful than in Monopoly, though some are still weak as well.<br/>         Chance spaces replaced by a Tavern space where you can recruit officers to join you.  <br/>             Only 3 officers are displayed at a time and these 3 are replaced whether or not you recruit one after landing on a Tavern Space.<br/>             Each player can recruit a total of 3 officers, which each officer having a special passive ability specific to that officer.  For example, Diao Chan forces an opponent paying rent to you to pay an additional 1500.  Lu Bu allows you to not pay any rent for landing on a space, but after using him, you must put him back at the bottom of the officer draw deck.  <br/>             There are a total of 30 officers to choose from.<br/>        <br/>         After a player goes bankrupt, that player actually submits to the player that caused the bankruptcy.  <br/>             The bankrupt player is now considered a Subordinate while his master is considered the &quot;New Ruler&quot;.  <br/>             They share resources, officers, and properties. The New Ruler essentially gets to move two pawns per turn instead of one, with the Subordinate rolling his own moves but the results of the space the Subordinate's pawn landing on being resolved by the New Ruler.  <br/>             This keeps the subordinate tied to the game instead of being completely eliminated.  When the ruler wins, the subordinate gets second place.  <br/>             There can be multiple levels of subordinates as a result of cascading bankruptcies etc. <br/>        <br/>         The game is won when only one ruler is left and the rest are his subordinates.<br/>    <br/><br/><br/>Overall, a more complex game than monopoly, especially cause of the officer cards and the somewhat more powerful community chest.  Also, the free camps from the maintenance and disaster aid spaces promote hoarding of cash while developing only a few properties normally.  Easily expandable to 6, 7, or 8 players, really.

These companies may use all railway tracks in the Netherlands. Their only goal is to transport as many passengers as possible to their intended destinations. For these passengers the journey from Rotterdam to Amsterdam may well go via Eindhoven.<br/><br/>Sometimes there is a sudden change of direction when the train has picked up more passengers, and a majority of those want to go to another part of the country. At other times trains may well skip stations when no passengers need to be there. And when a train does call at a station the passengers enter quickly hoping that they will arrive at their destination today. Is your train the one to be in? How many times they must change trains in order to arrive at their destination? Or will they not make it at all, because of those annoying obstructions?<br/><br/>Introduction to the game<br/>In Koplopers en Dwarsliggers every player may construct up to three trains and each of those trains can transport up to 500 passengers. During the game you pick up passengers at stations and put their tokens at your train organizer card in the corresponding box. And then you try to transport your passengers to their destinations, after which you collect their tokens in your tray. Each turn you may spend five action points that you can use for constructing or scrapping trains, but you may also combine trains, split them up again, or reverse them. You can pick up passengers, transport them or have them change trains, and finally you can play obstruction cards or perform an emergency repair. The player who has brought the highest number of passengers to their destination wins the game.<br/><br/>Some interesting facts<br/><br/>        Koploper is a Dutch train type (see game box), but it also means &lsquo;front runner&rsquo;.

Core Rules are the centerpiece of a simple, adaptable game system designed for quick-moving, action-based role-playing sessions. POW! is simple enough for beginners, yet flexible and expandable enough to appeal to the most battle-hardened role-player.<br/><br/>POW! is intended for use with POW! Worldbooks, which provide an assortment of settings that can all be used with the same core ruleset. POW! is the skeleton, a framework giving shape and support while allowing many different skins (the Worldbooks) to be wrapped around the outside.<br/><br/>* POW! is Rules-Light. This means that the engine has very few dice mechanics, very few variables, and almost no specific rules for Dodging Arrows while Riding a Heavily Encumbered War Elk Through a Swamp at Midnight. POW! leaves out many of the crunchy bits in favor of more streamlined gameplay.<br/><br/>* POW! is Camera-friendly. Which isn't to say that it photographs well, but rather that the style of gameplay is camera-like. POW! games move along in frames, snapshots of action that give everyone a chance to act, much like scenes from a comic book, or photographs in a scrapbook.<br/><br/>* POW! is Action-centric.
