Your score consists of two types of points: honest points and points you have from cheater&rsquo;s alliances. Honest points are completely risk-free, but they&rsquo;re harder to accumulate. Cheater&rsquo;s alliance points are easy to accumulate, and accumulate faster when you have many players in your alliance. However, any member of an alliance can turn the other members of the alliance in and take the alliance's points, adding them to their honest score. So the question is, &ldquo;How far you trust a group of self-admitted cheaters?&rdquo;<br/><br/>Cheater&rsquo;s Game uses about five standard six-sided dice, two point trackers, a turn tracker, player score pawns, and several sets of cheater&rsquo;s alliance pawns.  The trackers and pawns you need to play are all available as a 284 KB PDF.<br/><br/>Cheater&rsquo;s Game has fairly simple rules, but complex psychosocial dynamics. You could play it with children as young as 6 or 7, and use it as a tool for teaching ethical and social lessons. Cheater&rsquo;s Game is appropriate for Ages 12 and up without adult supervision. A 4-player game takes about 45 minutes to play.<br/><br/>"}, "40114": {"boardgamedesigner": ["(Uncredited)"], "poll": [], "name": "Buck Fever", "playingtime": "0", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": ["Roll / Spin and Move"], "yearpublished": "1983", "usersrated": "1", "boardgamefamily": ["Animals: Deer", "Sports: Hunting"], "maxplayers": "4", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic416741_t.jpg", "average": "3", "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["L & D Robotoy Enterprises"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic416741.jpg", "boardgameversion": ["Robotoy First Edition"], "maxplaytime": "0", "boardgamecategory": ["Animals"], "age": "0", "minplaytime": "0", "description": "Roll a die and move your hunter on the game board.

This Player Represented Personality or PRP is required to act in accordance with a pre-determined character design, complete with special abilities, specific quirks, personal goals and a requirement for the gamer to take on all the characteristics they find attached to their particular miniature.<br/><br/>It is a light hearted approach to tabletop games with a strong emphasis on fun and story-telling. The Rugged Adventures player is encouraged not to win the game but play the story. Often players are required by the GM to act up their actions or give an 'in character' verbal account of themselves. We want our players to laugh, shout, speak in silly accents and generally come away from a game having enjoyed themselves whether they won or lost.<br/><br/>If I had to boil the design philosophy down to the essentials: Rugged Adventures is a game for those of us who love to build models, terrain and paint lots of figures-and still want to have a fast paced and fun game that doesn&rsquo;t bog down with complex detail.

The 1810 wedding celebration of Crown Prince Ludwig I and Princess Therese of Saxe-Hildburghausen swiftly became an annual tradition known as Oktoberfest. Each year the scope of the festival expanded, and by the late 1800s sponsored beer halls and competing breweries were in full operation.<br/><br/>Oktoberfest is a card-driven game loosely based on the folk festival which began as a public celebration of a royal wedding. Based during the festival in the late 1800s, players vie for control of each of six types of beer, even though many of those beer styles are barely available in Bavaria and completely unrelated to Oktoberfest. As patrons arrive at the festival, players bid to decide where they go and how much they drink. By placing cards in the various tents, players can purchase barrels of beer based on the type and number of patrons on the card. The player who gets rid of the most barrels of each gains points for that type of beer at the end of the game.<br/><br/>The problem? The game ends before all twelve tents can be completed, and only closed tents count for points. Whichever beer type is the last in the tent before it closes claims all points for that tent, and the players with the most barrels of each type acquire points.<br/><br/>But watch out for the evacuation card that comes out randomly and wipes out entire tents.

These updated scenarios have not previously seen print in ASL form, although two have been available for download from the MMP website. They range from the beginning of World War II in Poland through the Russian offensive in the Ukraine across the Dnieper River, following the Battle of Kursk in 1943.<br/><br/>Turning the Tide&rsquo;s scenarios feature the forces of Poland, Belgium, The Netherlands, Norway, France, Britain, Greece, Russia (and Russian partisans), and the United States all battling Germany. Scenarios take place in both night and day, winter and summer, and involve cavalry, motorcycles, air support, parachutes, and gliders as well as armor clashes and infantry battles. Most take place in the countryside, but there are actions in cities and towns as well as forests and mountains, and some involve seizing bridges over rivers and canals.<br/><br/>The majority of the scenarios can be played with just boards 1-5, and only two require a board that was not part of the original SL-GI system.

But the tough Polish Army is going to fight for its independence with every tool it possesses. You want tin can action? Here it is! Uses boards 46 and 11 and requires use of Axis Minor and Italian counters.<br/><br/>FE2 Dans La Bataille, Pour La Patrie: May 1940, the French have their one opportunity to crush the German assault. The successful attack through the Ardennes is moving to the sea, cutting the French in half. However, this gives the French a singular opportunity for counterattack. Can DeGaulle marshal his forces for an effective attack? Requires board 12 and 4 and the French and German counters.<br/><br/>FE3 The Border Forts: November 1940 was a very bad month for Mussolini. His attack in Greece was failing, his battle fleet was heavily damaged at Taranto and his airforce was taking a beating in England. Only in the far deserts of East Africa was he enjoying any victory. Uses boards 27 and 31 and requires Italian and British Counters.<br/><br/>FE4 Whirling Dervishes: February 1941 finds the newly formed Free French Army looking for a way to contribute to the Allied cause. Bold action is taken from the colony of Camaroon. Using odds and ends of vehicles they traverse the desert and surround an isolated Italian fort. The defenders hang on until the cavalry arrive in the form of an Auto Saharan Company.

Most of the crews succeeded, and the enraged Allied Powers soon stripped Germany of her remaining modern warships as well.<br/><br/>The mass sinking at Scapa Flow did clear up one diplomatic flashpoint: Some American naval staff officers feared they would be incorporated into the Royal Navy and used in an Anglo-American conflict. As punishment for the German act of defiance, the Allies seized all remaining German dreadnought battleships and modern cruisers, plus 400,000 tons of floating cranes and drydocks and other equipment and all submarines.

The cards are then moved and turned over in a generally specified manner and order, in alternating turns, which represents the development of the play. In addition, at certain points of action, cards are turned over from the remaining deck, which represent the element of chance and the unanticipated dynamics of the game.<br/><br/>The scrimmage play evolves around match-ups between offensive and defensive cards, with the values and modifiers determining the outcome. Multiple cards on each side plus drawn cards may be involved in one match-up.<br/><br/>At some point during one of its turns, the offensive player executes a play (e.g. hands off the ball, throws a pass). Cards from each hand that are directly involved in the play are then added along with drawn cards, and the offensive and defensive values are compared to determine the outcome.<br/><br/>The scrimmage plays can actually replicate the flow and dynamics of a real play.<br/><br/>The game does require a lot of addition, so being able to add quickly is also helpful.<br/><br/>Scrimmage plays - Version 2 (Simplified)<br/><br/>Each team has its own deck of cards (of course team playing cards would be ideal). A third deck is used as the neutral Draw Deck. For each play from scrimmage, each player selects four cards from his own deck. After each play, these four cards are placed in that player's used card pile, and can't be used again until the deck is exhausted. Thus the entire deck is used in 13 plays, then each player starts over with the whole deck.<br/><br/>For each play, each player places four cards from his deck face down representing players. The cards are all turned face up, and the offense chooses which card/player the play goes to based on the type of play he wants to run and the most advantageous matchup. Additional cards are then drawn from the Draw Deck and added to each player's side of the matchup. Cards involved in the play are then added along with drawn cards, and the offensive and defensive values are compared to determine the outcome. Fumbles, sacks, incomplete passes and interceptions can occur.<br/><br/>For complete instructions, play diagrams and change history, see Web Links.<br/><br/>"}, "40229": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic419542.jpg", "poll": [], "boardgamedesigner": ["Josep Gutierrez"], "statistics": [], "yearpublished": "0", "maxplayers": "2", "boardgameartist": ["Bi\u00e9"], "boardgamepublisher": ["(Unpublished)"], "maxplaytime": "10", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic419542_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "10", "boardgamecategory": ["Abstract Strategy", "Animals", "Card Game", "Exploration"], "description": "[EN] The ladybugs go hunting, and they want to hunt as many lice as possible.

After a terrible first winter in Russia, the German troops reorganized and readied themselves to launch the offensive to end the war. The soviets got ready first; they launched an attack to retake Kharkov that ended in disaster for the troops involved. After finishing this offensive the Axis forces - numbering many Hungarians, Romanians and Italians - launched, at the beginning of July 1942 the operation code named &quot;Case Blue&quot;. German advance seemed unstoppable, reaching the Caucasus and the banks of the river Volga. At the city of Stalingrad the German army would experience a real nightmare fighting through August to October in an attempt to conquer it. Control of the city meant that the Germans could cut the traffic along the Volga, while for the Soviets it became a symbol of resistance against the invaders. Both Stalin and Hitler sent more and more troops to the cauldron of that destroyed city, into the fiercest and bloodiest battle ever known in history. In the event, conquering the city was rather useless to the Germans since, beginning on the 19th of November, Operation Uranus was launched and Marshall Zhukov could trap the German 6th Army into the ruins just won. Successive soviet offensives destroyed the Italian, Romanian and Hungarian armies on the river Don, forcing the Germans to evacuate their conquests in the Caucasus and endangering even the survival of the whole German Army Group South. Only the timely intervention of Marshall Erich von Manstein allowed the Germans to stop the Soviet advance and stabilize the front, thus saving an already catastrophic situation.<br/><br/>The game is played at the operational level - with a zonal map at a 1:120000 scale. Designed for two players, one handles the Axis while the other commands the Soviets. The game has an estimated playing time of 3-4 hours and uses a double system of counters/map and cards in its mechanics. Players must use appropriately their troops and resources to obtain victory points either by destroying enemy forces or by occupying cities on the map. This is not a card driven game, cards are used for causing certain events, influence the outcome of battles and to place on map the necessary resources and reinforcements to fight on.<br/><br/>The game starts in summer, the Axis player has the initiative and will mercilessly and relentlessly pound the Soviets. The Soviet player will have to hope for the winter - a card to be played given certain conditions - to stop the Axis advance and defeat them.<br/><br/>As the other titles in the series, this game has very simple rules and has been designed to make games wholly interactive, creating a solid and enjoyable experience for those who simply cannot find the time and space to play a longer and more complex game.<br/><br/>The Axis player must face the historical disjunctive, should he concentrate on taking the Caucasus, Stalingrad or both? The Soviet player will have to be patient and force his enemy to overextend his resources, at the same time managing to accumulate forces for a lethal winter offensive.<br/><br/>Components:<br/>- 1 80 x 65 cm map of southern Russia, Ukraine and the Caucasus. <br/>- 2 d10 dice <br/>- 176 counters 5/8 counters (1 sheet)<br/>- 1 Campaign Commander Series Rules and Roads to Stalingrad Exclusive Rules and historical and design notes. <br/>- 70 cards (divided in two decks + aids + promotional)<br/><br/>The game will be published in Spanish version also.<br/><br/><br/>El juego se publicar&aacute; en versi&oacute;n espa&ntilde;ola para los clientes de habla hispana.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": ["Spanish First Edition"], "average": "7.74496", "name": "Campaign Commander Volume I: Roads to Stalingrad", "playingtime": "180", "boardgamemechanic": ["Area Movement", "Area-Impulse", "Dice Rolling", "Simultaneous Action Selection"], "age": "0", "usersrated": "119", "boardgamesubdomain": ["Wargames"], "boardgamefamily": ["Campaign Commander", "Country: Russia"]}, "40244": {"boardgamedesigner": ["Milton Bradley"], "statistics": [], "name": "The Checkered Game of Life", "playingtime": "0", "minplayers": "0", "boardgamemechanic": ["Roll / Spin and Move"], "yearpublished": "1860", "usersrated": "1", "boardgamefamily": ["Game of Life"], "maxplayers": "0", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic91264_t.jpg", "average": "6", "boardgamepublisher": ["D.

English and Spanish instructions are included.<br/><br/>Similar to the play in Rummy, players receive seven cards to begin and draw from the deck or discard pile to begin each turn. Player discards one card to signal the end of the turn. The object of the game is to collect groups of three houses of the same color or three houses at consecutive addresses on the same street. Players lay down collections to gain the 10 points on each of the cards. A player can match a fixer-upper house with a cash card for 25 points. There is an old fire station card and an old church card that can be played alone and worth 25 points each.<br/><br/>Like Mille Bornes, this game has a few roadblocks. A player can play a Haunted House card or a Termite card on an opponent. The opponent cannot lay down any point cards until the proper remedy card is played, which is a Medium or Exterminator. If the player has the Home Inspection Team card displayed, the player is exempt from Termite or Ghost troubles.<br/><br/>Hands end when a player runs out of cards. Don't get caught with a lot of points in your hand, as they are subtracted from the points you have collected on the table.

In this world, conflicts rage between cosmic powers who want the world for their own unfathomable purposes and the human agencies dedicated to stopping them.<br/><br/>The weird world of H.P. Lovecraft's Cthulhu Mythos has drawn in fans for more than eighty years, with its richly painted themes of suspense, adventure, and the eerie unknown. Call of Cthulhu: The Card Game is fully immersed in this world and what is more, places you, as a player, in control of some of the facets of that world.<br/><br/>A typical game of Call of Cthulhu plays very quickly between two players and it has a high-level of player interaction, analysis of open information, planning and strategy. There is a wide variety of possible combinations of factions (Syndicate with Agency, Cthulhu with Hastur, etc.) and each combination will necessitate a different, challenging approach, providing high levels of re-playability.<br/><br/>One of the major appeals of the Living Card Game&reg; format is that it gives you not only a solid game experience, full of strategy and excitement, but it also allows you to customize your gaming experience to your liking. As you customize your deck from the Call of Cthulhu: The Card Game card pool, you get to build a strategy around your personal play style.<br/><br/>This game was originally a CCG, having been transitioned to Fantasy Flight Games' new Living Card Game (LCG) format. Monthly Asylum Pack expansions to the card pool were eventually supplanted by larger quarterly(-ish) expansion boxes.<br/><br/>FFG ended development and organized play support for the game in 2015. &quot;That is not dead which can eternal lie, and with strange aeons, even death may die.&quot;<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": ["Chinese first edition", "English edition", "French edition", "Japanese edition", "Spanish edition"], "average": "6.97972", "name": "Call of Cthulhu: The Card Game", "playingtime": "30", "boardgamemechanic": ["Card Drafting", "Hand Management"], "age": "13", "boardgameexpansion": ["41393", "90337", "100244", "100243", "147711", "100245", "117813", "166895", "51314", "50748", "89190", "107732", "63912", "98366", "120177", "67001", "105132", "87867", "76621", "60232", "61882", "127667", "110251", "60231", "96939", "141165", "95568", "41457", "105133", "80322", "93257", "41452", "134945", "177859", "41392", "83266", "41460", "98590", "158803", "41451", "76638", "41458", "41459", "173892", "87776", "121672", "71034", "123647", "42597", "65234", "114983", "112772"], "usersrated": "2660", "boardgameaccessory": ["Call of Cthulhu: The Card Game \u2013 3rd Quarter Champion Playmat", "Call of Cthulhu: The Card Game \u2013 Acrylic Tokens \u2013 Wound", "Call of Cthulhu: The Card Game \u2013 Alternate Art Clover Club Torch Singer", "Call of Cthulhu: The Card Game \u2013 Alternate Art Cthulhu, Lord of R'lyeh", "Call of Cthulhu: The Card Game \u2013 Alternate Art Daybreak!", "Call of Cthulhu: The Card Game \u2013 Alternate Art Eldritch Nexus", "Call of Cthulhu: The Card Game \u2013 Alternate Art Glaaki", "Call of Cthulhu: The Card Game \u2013 Alternate Art Johnny Valone", "Call of Cthulhu: The Card Game \u2013 Alternate Art Laboratory Assistant", "Call of Cthulhu: The Card Game \u2013 Alternate Art Snow Graves", "Call of Cthulhu: The Card Game \u2013 Alternate Art Y'Golonac", "Call of Cthulhu: The Card Game \u2013 Bag of Cthulhu", "Call of Cthulhu: The Card Game \u2013 Domain Cards", "Call of Cthulhu: The Card Game \u2013 Season 1 Champion Playmat", "Call of Cthulhu: The Card Game \u2013 Season 2 Champion Playmat", "Call of Cthulhu: The Card Game \u2013 Season 3 Champion Playmat", "Call of Cthulhu: The Card Game \u2013 Summer Champion Playmat"], "boardgamesubdomain": ["Customizable Games", "Strategy Games"], "boardgamefamily": ["Call of Cthulhu: The Card Game (LCG)", "CCGs (Collectible Card Games)", "Cthulhu Mythos", "Living Card Game"], "boardgamepodcastepisode": ["39: Boardgame Cthulhu", "Carnagecast 54: Shuffle Up and Deal", "Episode Twenty One of The Gaming Gang", "Season 3, Episode 3", "Wooden Cubes &amp; Iron Soldiers: \u201cJust the Two of Us\u201d Episode 8"]}, "40271": {"boardgamedesigner": ["(Uncredited)"], "poll": [], "name": "Teta Fuhu", "playingtime": "5", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": ["Paper-and-Pencil"], "yearpublished": "0", "usersrated": "6", "boardgamesubdomain": ["Abstract Games"], "maxplayers": "4", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic424995_t.jpg", "average": "6.58333", "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["(Public Domain)"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic424995.jpg", "maxplaytime": "5", "boardgamecategory": ["Abstract Strategy", "Action / Dexterity"], "age": "0", "minplaytime": "5", "description": "Two or more players draw a small base of circles in their corner of a paper.

You are a young merchant trying to make your name in this legendary port of vibrant commerce. Trade in spices, silks, gems, iron, and grain can bring great wealth... if you can bend the market to your will. Buy goods as they enter the city docks and sell them to the tradesmen who need them. Increase your profits by buying shares of the shops that use the goods in which you trade. Gain gold and prestige by fulfilling the orders of the Guild Hall craftsmen.<br/><br/>But Venice is a city of fickle demands and mercurial politics. Spend your ducats wisely and look for help from powerful people such as the Guildmaster, the Harbormaster, the Tax Collector... or perhaps a Thief. Even the humble Gondolieri have powerful connections in Venice. In the end, the most important thing to remember is the simple rule of commerce... buy low and sell high!

The game ends when the boat cannot advance (eg. it has reached the last row).<br/><br/>The players score points in two different ways:<br/><br/>     At the end of each turn, the current column is scored; each tent in a row scores the row amount (die/row value = amount of points)<br/>     At the end of the game, each row is scored; the player with the majority of tents in each row scores points (lower die/row numbers score more points)<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>The player who has contributed the least amount of money to the Queen cannot win the game, even if they collected the most points.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": ["English, French and Spanish edition", "Nordic edition", "Schmidt Edition"], "average": "6.44852", "name": "Livingstone", "playingtime": "35", "boardgamemechanic": ["Area Control / Area Influence", "Dice Rolling"], "age": "8", "usersrated": "1249", "boardgamesubdomain": ["Family Games"], "boardgamefamily": ["Continent: Africa"]}, "40445": {"boardgamedesigner": ["Larry Levy"], "poll": [], "name": "Pursuit of Happiness", "playingtime": "45", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": ["Pattern Building", "Set Collection"], "yearpublished": "1995", "usersrated": "0", "maxplayers": "5", "boardgamefamily": ["Rummy Games", "Traditional Card Games"], "average": "0", "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["(Unknown)"], "boardgameversion": ["First edition"], "maxplaytime": "45", "boardgamecategory": ["Card Game"], "age": "0", "minplaytime": "45", "description": "A card game using standard cards that gives players a unique way of making melds.
