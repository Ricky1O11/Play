Sure, barbarians get rage powers and paladins can smite evil, and if you devote a bunch of feats to it you might get a couple of nifty tricks like two-weapon fighting or spring attacking, but at the end of the day most mundane characters spend their combat rounds doing full attack after full attack, and eventually that gets a little stale.<br/><br/>A Necromancer\u2019s Grimoire: The Book of Martial Action provided a potential solution to this state of affairs by providing such characters with numerous options for fun, dynamic, and exciting things to do in combat in the form of martial techniques, which allow such characters to make meaningful decisions and unleash fun and exciting (but still decidedly mundane) special attacks, maneuvers, and abilities in combat. The martial action point system gives players a great level of control over how they use their martial techniques, and with over 50 feats granting access to different martial action techniques, there were plenty to choose from.<br/><br/>Like all good things, however, people wanted more of martial action, and that&rsquo;s where A Necromancer&rsquo;s Grimoire: The Book of Martial Action II comes in. This book has everything you need to use the martial action system, even if you don&rsquo;t have the original, and once again provides over 50 new martial techniques, plus no less than 5 full character classes, each of which is associated with a specific style of martial action. Crush any opponent one-one-one with the Iron Ram style, or confuse and disorient him with the Graceful Swallow style. You can outmaneuver foes with Flowing River techniques, or if that&rsquo;s not your style, turn to the Infinite Shadow style to exploit your foe&rsquo;s weaknesses, or the well-rounded and inward-focused Golden Soul style. Whatever your fighting style, A Necromancer&rsquo;s Grimoire: The Book of Martial Action II is designed to be able to easily provide value to existing characters of any level, while at the same time rewarding those who devote themselves to martial action.<br/><br/>"}, "158003": {"boardgamedesigner": ["Bernard X.

You can use these powers for inspiration, or you can even create your character by rolling for powers at random. As the Awesome Powers library grows, so will the list of available powers.<br/><br/>Volume 4 of Awesome Powers deals with powers of a dealing with Force and Gravity. There are dozens of powers for the Force and Gravity Suites here. Awesome Powers Vol. 4 uses the concept of &quot;Facets&quot; which are foci within a Suite.  The Force Suite is contains a Hard Light and Kinetic Energy powers Facet, each which allow their users to manipulate force in different ways.  The Gravity Suite has High-G and Low-G facets.<br/><br/>A special feature of Volume 4 is the new Advantage: Membership.  This allows players and Narrators to create teams and organizations for their characters, each with their own perks and drawbacks. An organization can range in size from a small supers team patrolling the neighborhood to an entire nation's government. Membership allows Heroes (and Villains) to utilize the vehicles, bases, equipment, contacts, backup, and other resources of the organization.  But Membership in an organization has its perils.  Enemies seeking to destroy them, moles thwarting their plans from within, a powder keg that must be contained, an angry public that is suspicious, and many more.<br/><br/>You'll also find all new Limitations and Enhancements (like Target Exclusion and Side Effect), entirely new Disadvantages (like Non-Combatant), how to create your own Powers, and Random Character Creation!<br/><br/>Each of the powers presented here explains how to replicate the power described as closely as possible using the existing BASH! Ultimate Edition rules.  In this fourth volume of Awesome Powers, we present to your two themes, or Power Suites, each based on different tropes. The Force Power Suite allows you to create force fields and energy beams of &quot;Hard Light&quot; energy or to harness and redirect the power of Kinetic Energy.  The Gravity Suite allows you to manipulate the most fundamental energy that drives the universe itself.  Use it to crush your enemies, or simply leave them hanging in midair while you walk on walls or fly.

Any fan of fantasy who grew up in the 80s must certainly know about the Lone Wolf Lone Wolf gamebooks. They definitely helped shape my childhood. Lone Wolf is the longest running and most popular gamebook series ever made. Currently (2010), there is a Lone Wolf RPG being produced, but the roleplaying game and its system, much like the series and the world it's set in, has many shortcomings.<br/><br/>fromAnd the setting itself:<br/>&hellip;this adaptation of Magnamund has a number of important changes and improvements. A few new races have been added to the world for diversity, and the races that have been borrowed from Joe Dever's books are less rigid and polarized: some Dwarves are miners, true, but some are also scientists and wizards, and they don't all wear beards; some Giaks are powerful warriors, but many others are mathematicians, priests, diplomats, and thieves. Also, no race is inherently good or evil. Individual members of races perform good deeds and act evilly, while others remain neutral in most cases, and walk the fine line of ethics that makes them neither good nor bad. There are also new religions in the following pages, unlike the Lone Wolf novels, which feature one religion with two<br/>ideologically opposed gods.<br/><br/>Weapons, armor, magic and psionics have all been adapted to fit the Saga core rules, making combat much more realistic and deadly than in the Lone Wolf books. Professions are also less racially-restricted. Giaks traveling to Dessi can become magicians if they enroll and learn the proper skills, and lizardmen of the swamps who travel to Sommerlund can become Kai lords if they enlist at the Kai monastery.<br/><br/>Countries and regions have also been diversified and made more realistic. There is a huge variety of political structures, and not all of the nations and people of Magnamund are civilized. There are still indigenous &ldquo;primitive&rdquo; cultures characters can play as, ally with or against, visit, or ignore entirely. These peoples are brutally oppressed by the civilized nation states that want to conquer, destroy, convert, or enslave them, providing a wholly new socio-political element that the original Magnamund couldn't<br/>dream of.<br/><br/>"}, "158139": {"rpgartist": ["(Uncredited)"], "rpgitemversion": ["PDF version (Third Edition)"], "statistics": [], "name": "Braythmar: of Resistance to Empire in an Age of Bronze", "rpgdesigner": ["Rowan WalkingWolf"], "rpgproducer": ["Rowan WalkingWolf"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1993436.png", "usersrated": "0", "average": "0", "rpggenre": ["Fantasy (High Fantasy)"], "rpgpublisher": ["Yggdrasil Distro"], "rpg": ["Saga: A Rules-light Universal Roleplaying System"], "rpgcategory": ["Campaign Setting (game world)"], "poll": [], "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1993436_t.png", "description": "subtitle<br/>a Bronze Age High-Fantasy Campaign Setting for use with SAGA &amp; other roleplaying systems<br/><br/>fromWhy another high-fantasy campaign setting?:<br/>There are so many high-fantasy campaign settings and worlds to choose from when beginning a roleplaying campaign, it does seem a little excessive to write another. However, despite the universality of this genre, fantasy gaming and literature are overrun by awful stereotypes, idiotic conventions, and otherwise stupid trappings that ruin what should be an infinitely refreshing and renewable territory.<br/><br/>Everyone who has played a fantasy RPG or who has experienced some kind of fantasy media knows these trappings I'm talking about&hellip; Elves are all nimble archers who live in the woods; Orcs are all brutish, savage warriors with the intellect of a pea; Dwarves drink mead and beer by the gallon, have long beards, speak in ill-conceived Scottish accents, shoot blunderbusses, wield axes, and mine the depths of the planet; Trolls are stupid, axe-throwing beasts; Goblins are wicked, snickering, child-like tinkerers, who all love to build machines; Humans are the most widespread race, and they have such a diversity of skills and talents that they get no bonuses or penalties; fantasy worlds must contain Elves, Orcs, Dwarves, Trolls, Goblins, and Elves; all societies in fantasy worlds are perfect reflections of the European middle ages, and monarchy is a desirable and fun governmental system to live under...<br/><br/>These conventions go on and on, each stupider than the last. My purpose in writing another fantasy campaign setting is to completely abolish all of the these stereotypes and to create a believable, complex fantasy world.

Howard, creator of Conan the Barbarian, Kull the Conqueror, and numerous other memorable characters of the mythical Hyborian Age and the shrouded times of ancient past. Fans of Conan and other related stories will already be familiar with much of this material. Those who aren't Conan fans will find it all very new, so following below is a short and largely inadequate description of this campaign setting.<br/><br/>The Hyborian Age is a pseudo-historical low-fantasy world that partially resembles the ancient and pre-ancient history of our world. Many of the societies in Howard's mythos are based partly or entirely on civilizations and non-civilized societies that have existed in the past. These cultures range in flavor and technological level from pre-historic Paleolithic to the Middle Eastern, the Classical to the Medieval.<br/><br/>Humans are the only playable race in Hyboria, although there are many fantastic and real-world creatures to be found as well. There are no dwarves, elves, orcs, or halflings here. Magic is present, but it is radically different than in most fantasy settings. It is subtle, ritualistic, and infinitely more powerful than in D&amp;D and other common RPG systems. It fits perfectly with the magic system detailed in the Saga Core Rulebook.<br/><br/>Another distinguishing feature of Howard's world is its deadliness and brutality. Hyboria is a kill or be killed, conquer or submit kind of place. The average lifespan for most people is around 30 years; grey hair is considered a sign of great strength, resilience, and wisdom, as death comes early to most.<br/><br/>One final thing players should be aware of is the crossover between Howard's world and Lovecraft's Cthulhu mythos. The mythology of the Elder Gods and Great Old Ones occasionally made its way into Hyboria, and I wholeheartedly endorse this admixture. The demon-gods of the Cthulhu mythos compliment the demon-gods of Conan's world brilliantly, and campaigns in the Hyborian Age are sure to encounter some kind of insanity-inspiring, horrific being at some point. Players and Narrators should familiarize themselves with this mythology if they are not already versed in it.<br/><br/>"}, "158141": {"rpgdesigner": ["James Spahn"], "rpg": ["Labyrinth Lord"], "statistics": [], "name": "Berserker", "rpgartist": ["Wikimedia Commons"], "rpgproducer": ["James Spahn"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1993761.png", "usersrated": "0", "rpgitemversion": ["PDF version"], "average": "0", "rpggenre": ["Culture", "Fantasy (High Fantasy)"], "rpgpublisher": ["Barrel Rider Games"], "rpgcategory": ["Sourcebook (rules/options to enhance play)"], "poll": [], "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1993761_t.png", "description": "From publisher blurb:<br/><br/>From the fury of the Northmen release us, O Lord!<br/><br/>With the Berserker, a new 20-level player character class for Labyrinth Lord and other old-school fantasy role-playing games, you'll bring the fury of the north to your fantasy gaming table!

Arcane archers are masters of ranged combat, as they possess the ability to strike targets with unerring accuracy and can imbue their arrows with powerful spells. Arrows fired by arcane archers carry spells, fly at weird and uncanny angles to strike foes around corners, and can pass through solid objects to hit enemies. At the height of their power, arcane archers can fell even the most powerful foes with a single, deadly shot.<br/><br/>Prestige Class: Arcane Archer. <br/>Build Classes: Magus, Ranger, Wizard.<br/><br/>What is a Prestige Archetype?<br/><br/>A prestige archetype is a prestige class turned into a normal 20-level class, similar to an archetype or alternate class.<br/><br/>The goal when making these prestige archetypes has been to capture the flavor of the prestige class rather than to make an exact copy of how it would normally be. Attack bonuses, hit dice, class skills, spells, and class features have been unified and spread evenly over levels. This means that most prestige archetypes have their prestige abilities spread over the entire 20 level spread. Unlike how prestige classes normally work, these archetypes have a few complete class abilities rather than many abilities limited to a low level. In some cases, you get the choice of one of several class abilities rather than stymied versions of all the abilities.<br/><br/>A prestige archetype generally has elements of one or more regular character classes, to represent how prestige prerequisites were met and character development after the prestige class has ended. Sometimes there is more than one class that naturally leads itself to a particular prestige class, which can lead to several different prestige archetypes for different combinations. A few are not built on a regular class, instead expanding the idea behind the prestige class to a full 20 levels.<br/><br/>"}, "158143": {"rpgartist": ["(Uncredited)"], "rpgitemversion": ["PDF version"], "statistics": [], "name": "Arcanum of Steamworks & Magic Obscura", "rpgdesigner": ["Rowan WalkingWolf"], "rpgproducer": ["Rowan WalkingWolf"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1993452.png", "usersrated": "0", "average": "0", "rpggenre": ["Fantasy (High Fantasy)", "Steampunk"], "rpgpublisher": ["Yggdrasil Distro"], "rpg": ["Saga: A Rules-light Universal Roleplaying System"], "rpgcategory": ["Campaign Setting (game world)"], "poll": [], "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1993452_t.png", "description": "subtitle<br/>a dark urban, high-fantasy, steampunk Campaign Setting<br/><br/>fromInspirations for this Campaign Setting:<br/>The tome that you now in your hands, dearest reader, is an agglomeration of many other fine works. Indeed, this is a pastiche in the truest sense, a literary medley with ingredients gathered from far and wide. As the title suggests, Arcanum is a setting of dark urban intrigue, high-fantasy exploration and magic, as well as forray into the grease-smeared, gear- powered world of Steampunk. Let us explore the inspirations for each of these elements below.<br/><br/>The first and most obvious foundation for this setting is the PC game of the same name. Those who booted up their Babbage Engines and played Arcanum will most certainly recognize a great deal of material herein. However, the author has taken many artistic liberties, and much of the information below is new or altered. Therefore, those who have played Arcanum the game are highly encouraged to read Arcanum the campaign setting in order to familiarize themselves with the world presented herein.<br/><br/>One of the most delightful aspects of Steampunk, in this author's opinion, is the atmosphere of gloomy, repressive, urban nightmare. The original Arcanum failed to provide this. Another series of steampunk games&mdash;the Thief series&mdash;presented this element in masterfully crafted form. The Urban areas in this campaign setting are all highly reminiscent of &quot;The City&quot; of the Thief series. Further, all of the factions and organizations found within those games appear in this setting, including the Pagans, the Order of the Hammer (aka: the Hammerites), and The Keepers.<br/><br/>Another source of the Dark Urban flavor is the Neverwhere franchise by a Mr. Neil Gaiman. Players who have read the novel, the picture periodicals, or who have seen the original moving picture will recognize familiar territory here. That is to say, within the Great Cities of the world of Arcanum, one may delve down deep and discover entire subterranean cities and civilizations undreamed of above.<br/><br/>"}, "158144": {"rpgartist": ["(Uncredited)"], "rpgitemversion": ["PDF version"], "statistics": [], "name": "Neverwhere", "rpgdesigner": ["Rowan WalkingWolf"], "rpgproducer": ["Rowan WalkingWolf"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1993444.png", "usersrated": "0", "average": "0", "rpggenre": ["Fantasy (Modern Urban Fantasy)"], "rpgpublisher": ["Yggdrasil Distro"], "rpg": ["Saga: A Rules-light Universal Roleplaying System"], "rpgcategory": ["Campaign Setting (game world)"], "poll": [], "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1993444_t.png", "description": "subtitle<br/>A Dark Urban Campaign Setting<br/><br/>fromInspiration for this Campaign Setting:<br/>The Neverwhere campaign setting is inspired in its entirety by the novel Neverwhere. The novel, in turn, was written as a follow-up to the amazing though horribly filmed BBC series of the same name. Both the novel and the BBC series are the brainchildren of acclaimed English author Neil Gaiman. Reading the novel and/or watching the series is not necessary for Neverwhere players, as this campaign setting supplement includes all the information gleaned from those sources. However, to internalize and understand the atmosphere that this campaign setting strives for, familiarizing oneself with the source material can be most helpful.<br/><br/>Those who are already well-versed in the novel or series will recognize a great deal of information herein. The discerning reader will also note that much of the information within this supplement is either extrapolated from the source material or it is entirely original.

Journey to unknown spheres both real and imagined, because matter is merely atoms vibrating with frequency, and the difference between harmony and discord can be either an eyelash's breadth or a distant star.  Converse with strange aliens, fall in with dangerous cults, stand on impossible skyscrapers that preside over undiscovered landscapes.  The dangers are great, but the rewards are even greater.<br/><br/>In the darkness of ages past, our universe was visited by aliens strange and unknowable. They enslaved hundreds of people and they conquered thousands of worlds. For untold generations, the Myriad people served them, and worlds were stripped of all resources, and left barren and dead. And then, a century ago, the Syndics were gone. Did they retreat to another universe? Are they hiding on undiscovered worlds, in radio silence? Interplanetary factions spread their philosophy from place to place. The Solar Creed offers the people free energy . . . at the price of their freedom and liberty. The technologists of the Concord push forward with their new science, for better or for ill. What mysterious dangers lurk in the unknown voids of space?<br/><br/>A complete game in one volume, MYRIAD SONG is a science-fiction adventure where you will travel in the strange legacy of an alien empire. Discover primitive worlds with savage monsters . . . high-tech stations of amazing technology . . . derelict planets where people scrounge out a living among the ruins . . . and places far stranger. You will find lost treasures . . . and you will find horrors best forgotten. The risks are great, but the rewards are greater.<br/><br/>Built using the Cardinal rules engine (as seen in IRONCLAW, NOGGLE STONES, and USAGI YOJIMBO RPG), our game lets you build your character to be as straightforward or as complex as you like.  Play a no-nonsense adventurer ready for anything, or play a master specialist who has no equal in their field.  Play an ordinary human thrust into extra-ordinary circumstances, or play a fantastic alien or machine, made from unknown science and with powers and abilities far beyond our normal space.  Work with exotic alien materials to build savage and strange weapons, or use advanced technology to make cybernetic enhancements to make what you need, when you need it.  Bluff your way past the secret police, or rob some petty lord of their ill-gotten riches, or fly a spaceship to vistas beyond any known horizon.<br/><br/>Lavishly illustrated in full color from some of the top talents working in science fiction, our game brings the worlds of your vivid imagination to you, and lets you make your story.  Are you ready to heed the clarion call of the alien spheres, the music that is the MYRIAD SONG?<br/><br/>"}, "158158": {"rpgartist": ["(Uncredited)"], "rpg": ["The Chamber"], "statistics": [], "name": "The Chamber", "rpgdesigner": ["Scott A.

However, two new ships are made available whose weapon configurations are new to the series. Moreover, several changes were made on the weapons system. The chargeable E. Laser, the Reduce size shield, option types, are all items that have been removed in the transition from Gradius III: From Legend to Myth to this title. The player can select from four ships instead of a broad range of several weapon configurations like from Gradius III. Missile, Double, and Laser weapons can be additionally powered up one level, a feature from the MSX Gradius games (the powerup bar even resembles the one from the MSX games). These power-ups are permanent until the player is destroyed, even if he switches between the Double and Laser powerups. There are two new types of shield: 'Guard', which attaches to the top and bottom of the craft and renders the player immune to physical obstacle collisions; and 'Limit', which gives complete invulnerability and lasts for three seconds.<br/><br/>The difficulty level can also be adjusted from 'easiest' up to 'hardest', for a total of nine difficulty levels including the boss rush. On the easier difficulties, the more troublesome boss attacks are removed and the number of enemies on-screen is reduced.<br/><br/>At the near end of the eighth stage starting from the second loop of the game play, a Core Warship is added.<br/><br/>A player can rearrange the items in the power meter. This feature is only available in this edition in its series.<br/><br/>New ships<br/>Jade Knight: Eponymously, every weapon this ship has is tinted green, including the options. Its missile, the spread bomb, is a carry-over from Gradius II: Gofer's Ambition. This ship has two different kinds of lasers available: round and pulse. The round laser, the most unusual weapon presented in this game, fires concentric rings of laser origination. The pulse laser is a two or three pronged burst laser, similar to the twin laser in previous titles.<br/><br/>Falchion &beta;: This ship's weapons are variations on well known themes. The Falchion has a two way missile called a rolling missile, which tumbles to the ground where it splits and shoots both left and right. It also has a three-way limited range shot called Auto-Aiming, that fires a second shot within the angles of 0 to 180. Its laser weapon is the gravity bullet, which is a newcomer to the Gradius series but is present in several earlier Parodius titles. It is based on the Spread Gun that is yielded by Pentarou in Parodius Da! and every title afterward.<br/><br/>Also, it has been speculated that the ship is not new at all, but an upgrade of the Falchion from the 1987 Konami game of the same name.<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;Gradius Gaiden&quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "158210": {"rpgartist": ["Mikael Brodu", "Matt Zeilinger"], "rpg": ["Pathfinder System Compatible Product"], "statistics": [], "name": "Thunderscape Vistas 01: Academy of Mechamagic", "rpgdesigner": ["Shawn Carman", "Rob Dake"], "rpgproducer": ["Mikael Brodu", "Shawn Carman", "Rob Dake", "Robert Denton", "Connor Louisell", "Matthew Schenck", "Cheryl Toomey", "Evan Walters", "Rich Wulf"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2358257.jpg", "usersrated": "0", "rpgitemversion": ["PDF version"], "rpgsetting": ["Thunderscape: The World of Aden"], "average": "0", "rpggenre": ["Fantasy (High Fantasy)", "Steampunk"], "rpgpublisher": ["Kyoudai Games"], "rpgcategory": ["Sourcebook (rules/options to enhance play)"], "poll": [], "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2358257_t.jpg", "description": "From publisher blurb:<br/><br/>One of the most powerful forces in the world of Aden is mechamagic, the fusion of science and sorcery that has changed the face of the Known Lands, both before the Darkfall and in its wake.

For that, you can turn to a mythic heritage. This new aspect of mythic characters allows for further customization of your mythic character. A mythic character can choose a mythic heritage in addition to his or her mythic path, and doing so grants him access to a number of unique abilities that are designed to reflect the flavor of his heritage, while also being of value to characters of every mythic path.<br/><br/>This book introduces the pharaonic heritage in particular, which represents characters whose mythic power comes from sources such as the Nile (or similar mythic rivers in hostile wastes), the Old Kingdom, and the pharaohs. If you are the long-lost descendant of an ancient pharaoh, accidentally awakened a sleeping power deep within a forgotten pyramid, have been imbued with power by a pharaoh or one of the mysterious gods of the Old Kingdom, or even are a pharaoh yourself, this mythic heritage allows you to tap into the ineffable and ancient power of the god-kings of the desert. This book includes 18 new mythic abilities, all of which are part of the pharaonic mythic heritage. Call forth powerful sandstorms which harm your foes, but leave you untouched. Imprison your foes in miniature pyramids and erase their names from history forever. Adventure with confidence, knowing that if you are slain you will rise again as a mummy in short time to wreak vengeance on those who slew you. Call forth oases with merely a word.

Raicer had revived interest in gaming the Great War with a series of WWI campaign games for the late lamented Command magazine. GMT is proud to present a set of revised boxed editions of these classic &ldquo;players-games&rdquo;.<br/><br/>In August 1914, Imperial Germany gambled its future on a rapid conquest of France, designed to free up the German army within six weeks to face the Russian steamroller of France&rsquo;s Tsarist ally on the eastern front. Seven German armies deployed opposite five French armies, the army of &ldquo;plucky little Belgium&rdquo;, and the &ldquo;Old Contemptibles&rdquo; of the British Expeditionary Force in a series of battles that turned August and September 1914 into the bloodiest months of the entire war.<br/><br/>1914: Glory&rsquo;s End covers the first three months of the Great War on the western front, from the Guns of August to First Ypres. This oft-gamed campaign receives a unique treatment, emphasizing playability without compromising on historical feel. Units are mostly corps of four steps (two counters per unit), along with a few especially strong (or weak) brigades and divisions, along with counters for the feared German Krupp and Skoda guns. The corps level Order of Battle accurately reflects the operational doctrine of the campaign, while also limiting the number of counters on the map to an easy-to-manage level.<br/><br/>The game scale is 9.5 miles per hex and three days per turn. The campaign game runs a full 30 turns, but the new edition will include not only a previously published mini-scenario on the Battle of the Marne, but a short ten turn campaign scenario covering the decisive opening weeks of the war. In addition the campaign games can be played in historical or free set-up versions.<br/><br/>1914: Glory&rsquo;s End uses an Igo-Hugo system with two types of combat to demonstrate the tactical realities of the campaign: Prepared Combat and March Combat. Prepared Combat allows you to bring all your adjacent units to bear against a defending hex, but only with units that don&rsquo;t move. This gives the defender time to reinforce, retreat, or pre-empt your combat with his own attack. To avoid this, you can &ldquo;attack off the march&rdquo; during your movement, but March Combat may only be delivered by a single stack at a time, limiting the force you can bring to bear. Furthermore, March Combat cannot be used against entrenched enemy units.<br/><br/>The coming of trench warfare is reflected by a unique Entrenchment rule: starting on turn 10 players may entrench one or two hexes per turn, PLUS any hexes adjacent to enemy trenches. The result is that trenches appear first as a tactical consideration, but then turn into a strategic problem as they spread with ever-increasing rapidity along the front.<br/><br/>1914: Glory&rsquo;s End manages to cover all the important characteristics of the campaign (with rules for forts, cavalry, command and control breakdowns, supply, strategic rail movement, Allied sea movement, German forced marching, Plan XVII, Paris in Danger! and more) while remaining easy to play. The new GMT version will of course incorporate all errata from the original edition, but adds updated artwork, a corrected historical campaign Order of Battle, additional scenarios, and a tweaked set of rules.<br/><br/><br/>When Eagles Fight<br/><br/>Before the award-winning World War I designs Paths of Glory and The Great War In Europe, Deluxe Edition, designer Ted S. Raicer had revived interest in gaming the Great War with a series of WWI campaign games for the late lamented Command magazine. GMT is proud to present a set of revised boxed editions of these classic &ldquo;players-games&rdquo;.<br/><br/>Winner of the Charles S. Roberts award for best pre-WWII boardgame, When Eagles Fight covers the eastern front in World War I, the last war of Tsarist Russia, Habsburg Austria, and Imperial Germany. From 1914 to 1917 the armies of the Tsar battled from the Carpathians to the Baltic against the outnumbered but logistically superior German army and the badly-led multi-ethnic forces of Austria-Hungary (the Central Powers). Though repeatedly inflicting massive defeats on the Habsburg armies, the Russians were ultimately undone by the skill and firepower of the German army and the collapsing political structure of the Tsarist autocracy. By March 1917 the 300 year-old Romanov dynasty was no more, and the stage was set for the coming of Lenin and the Bolsheviks. But the empire of the Habsburgs was left mortally wounded, and the Kaiser&rsquo;s Germany would meet its own doom less than two years later on the battlefields of the western front.<br/><br/>When Eagles Fight recreates this titanic struggle from the initial clashes at Tannenberg and in Galicia to the revolution that brought down Tsar Nicholas II. The large-hex map covers the eastern front of the Great War from the northern tip of Romania to Petrograd, and from Berlin to Smolensk at a scale of 25 miles to the hex. Turns represent one or two months, and combat units range from division to (mostly) corps.<br/><br/>When Eagles Fight has a set of low-complexity rules, without sacrificing the historical elements of this unique theater of the Great War. The combat results table is bloody and attritional, but allows for breakthroughs with the right tactics or artillery support. The greater operational skills of the German army is shown in the use of the OberOst HQ, which allows additional attacks on a select part of the front. The Russian supreme headquarters, Stavka, in turn has the ability to concentrate their limited supplies to overcome logistical shortages. And the surprise tactics of the Brusilov Offensive can allow a late game victory over the Austrians.<br/><br/>Other rules cover the slow pace of Russian mobilization, Austrian Lock-Step Planning in the opening days of the war, German heavy artillery, fortifications, Russian Guards forces, Cavalry Retreats, and the effects of events on other fronts.<br/><br/>But the new edition of When Eagles Fight is more than just a reprint of the original version. The Random Events Table has been exchanged for a system of random events chits allowing for more events. The effects if the Germans do not launch a Verdun offensive in France-which sometimes threw off the balance of the original design- have been revised. Changes in the stacking rules after 1914 more accurately reflect the effect of trenches on the course of the campaigns. And the map now contains the rail lines removed by Command from the first edition. The game also includes a short alternative-history scenario in which the bulk of the German army goes east rather than west in August 1914.<br/><br/>These changes make this an improved edition of an already award-winning design. Tense, historical, and just plain fun, When Eagles Fight is a game that belongs in the collection of everyone with an interest in the Great War!<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": ["GMT edition"], "name": "1914: Glory's End / When Eagles Fight", "playingtime": "0", "boardgamemechanic": ["Dice Rolling", "Hex-and-Counter", "Simulation"], "age": "0", "usersrated": "97", "boardgamesubdomain": ["Wargames"], "average": "7.29742"}, "158238": {"rpgartist": ["Jacob Blackmon", "Brian Brinlee", "Gary Dupuis", "Forrest Imel", "Dyson Logos", "Matt Morrow"], "rpgitemversion": ["PDF version"], "statistics": [], "name": "The Monastery of Inexorable Truth", "rpgdesigner": ["Dave Przybyla"], "rpgproducer": ["Perry Fehr", "Mark Gedak"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1996154.jpg", "usersrated": "1", "average": "7", "rpggenre": ["Fantasy (High Fantasy)"], "rpgpublisher": ["Purple Duck Games"], "rpg": ["Swords & Wizardry"], "rpgcategory": ["Scenario / Adventure / Module"], "poll": [], "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1996154_t.jpg", "description": "From publisher blurb:<br/><br/>THE TRUTH CAN BE DEADLY<br/><br/>It is said that the truth will set you free... but is that, itself, the truth?

It is a fun card-driven character building game featuring a hilarious uncontrolled narrative that unfolds differently every time.<br/><br/>As an aspiring super villain, you are trying to make your mark in the world. In Villainy you are trying to be the first villain to complete three plans to beat Fantastiman, that pesky super-hero who watches over the city day and night. You must hire minions to aid you in your quest for world domination. You will have to do crimes and go to work as your alter ego to learn the skills necessary and gain the cards required to see your great plans through to their triumphant end.<br/><br/>Today is the day that Fantastiman will fall...<br/><br/><br/>Game Mechanics Description:<br/><br/>In Villainy, players gradually build a stronger team of villains. Each turn, players typically perform a single action which may include purchasing a new team member with money, increasing one of four team member's stats, earning money, and completing objectives.<br/><br/>Each team member has three primary stats: strength, charisma, and intelligence. In addition, they can each acquire 6 abilities such as a scientific knowledge or the possession of a weapon. Team members can also gain an additional special action and extra income by purchasing an alter ego card such as a software engineer.<br/><br/>Players draw an initial objective card that describes minimum statistics and abilities a team must have to complete that objective. Players then spend turns building their team to meet those requirements. There is a pool of characters a player can purchase with money. There is another pool of crimes and alter ego cards that a player can select and which will provide money or increase a team member's stats. These pools will cycle throughout the game and choosing which cards to select and which characters to purchase are important to building a strong team.<br/><br/>Once the requirements are met, they may spend a turn to complete the objective. The first two objectives are met simply by having a team with the right requirements. The third in addition to having these requirements includes a mechanic where the team fights against Fantastiman. During this third and last objective, players will draw random challenge cards that may decrease their team stats and abilities. If the team overcomes these challenges and still meets the minimum requirements, they can then complete the fight by rolling a high value with a dice.<br/><br/>The first player to complete all three objectives is the winner.<br/><br/>There are additional challenges or fights which occur both randomly and as a player's action throughout the game. Typically these fights award a bonus to one player without hurting another. It is these challenges and several special abilities that steal from other players that make up the majority of player to player direct conflict.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": ["English first edition"], "name": "Villainy", "playingtime": "90", "average": "6.18813", "boardgameexpansion": ["Mayfair Games' Limited Edition Promo Expansion Set #13", "Villainy: Turf War"], "usersrated": "80", "age": "12", "boardgamepodcastepisode": ["Ameritrashed: Episode #10", "Episode 55: All I Want For Christmas Is Glue (fixed)", "Episode 81-- Gen Con 2014 Top 11 to Try and Top 11 to Buy with special gues W.

It's not about winning and losing - it's about the drama, tragedy, and comedy that goes on in your colony.To keep things interesting, the game creates events like pirate raids, trader arrivals, and storms. But these events aren't random. RimWorld uses an AI Storyteller (modeled after the AI Director from Left 4 Dead) who analyzes your situation and decides which event she thinks will make the best story. There are several storytellers to choose from:<br/><br/>Cassandra Classic aims to create a rising curve of tension over the course of the game. Early on, the most dangerous thing she'll do is send a psychotic squirrel after you. Later on, bands of scavengers will arrive. In the late game, look forward to combined-arms attacks from mercenaries mixed with lightning storms and crop blights. If you want a traditional tension and difficulty curve, go with Cassandra.<br/>    Phoebe Friendly is for the player who just wants to build and watch a colony grow. She'll occasionally create minor disasters, but nothing that would threaten the existence of the colony. If you want a more relaxing game about growth and success, choose Phoebe.<br/>    Randy Random follows no rules. He may give you some amazing stroke of luck, like a trader selling an advanced weapon for a low price or a group of helpful immigrants, followed by a near-unbeatable pirate attack combined with an electrical fire. If you think losing is fun, you might want to try Randy.<br/>There might be other storytellers in the future.<br/><br/>The designers put special effort into tactics and psychology.<br/>Tactics:<br/>RimWorld uses an engine that was originally developed to power a tactical sim similar to Jagged Alliance 2. This means it has a lot of features designed to make small-team firefights interesting. For example:<br/><br/>There's a cover system that models low cover and leaning around corners.<br/>    There's a really nuanced algorithm for determining and reporting hit chances based on distance, skill, weapon, lighting, angle, and cover.<br/>    Weapons have some pretty deep stats.<br/>    <br/>Psychology<br/>People in RimWorld constantly observe their situation and surroundings in order to decide how to feel at any given moment. They respond to hunger and fatigue, witnessing death, being wounded, being left in darkness, getting packed into cramped environments, and many other situations. You can inspect a character's psychology at any time to see what they're feeling and why.<br/><br/>Source: The Game Website.<br/><br/>User addition: The game has been funded with Kickstarter.

The Water God was angry so he sent his waves. He demanded blood, the water of man as tribute or he would spread even more death upon the people of the islands.<br/><br/>What they could not possibly know is the Water God was slain by another god who wanted the blood being sacrificed to the Water God. This Blood God had been gathering the yearly blood sacrifices and preparing for his physical entrance into the world. Now is the year of his arrival. When the sacrifice is made this time, the Blood God will form itself from blood using the images of the Water God to maintain its charade (You can see the image of this god on the bottom of the pool and its face on the statues). The Blood God vows it will feed all the time, rather than just once a year.<br/><br/>The Player Characters can get involved by trying to stop the gruesome sacrifice (people are immersed and drowned in the pool alive), or by witnessing the murder of one of the people in town by the Blood God, who literally drains the blood of the victim through its tentacles, leaving a desiccated husk behind.

The scale is the regiment, a good compromise between the brigade level (with no formations) and the detailed battalions. The scale is 250 m/hex and a turn is 30 minutes.<br/><br/>Vitoria, fought on June 21, 1813, was one of the most decisive battles of the Peninsular War. It was the last major battle between the allied British, Portuguese and Spanish forces and the French armies, and opened the way for the invasion of France. It opposed 60,000 French soldiers commanded by King Joseph to 80,000 allies superbly trained and equipped attacking on three sides. Looking like a one-sided battle, things are far from obvious for the Allies and many what-ifs make the situation very interesting.<br/><br/>Oca&ntilde;a, fought on 19 November 1809 was a major Spanish defeat that ended any chance of success in the Spanish Junta&rsquo;s autumn campaign of 1809. The largest Spanish army under general Areizaga, more than 55,000 men, moved toward Madrid but allowed Marshal Soult and King Joseph to concentrate around 30,000 men. A brutal clash occurred at Oca&ntilde;a, and a French cavalry movement on the flank rolled the Spanish line.<br/><br/>Salamanca, fought on 22 July 1812, was a turning point in 1812.  The battle saw the Anglo-Portuguese army under the Duke of Wellington defeat Marshal Marmont's French forces among the hills around Arapiles, south of Salamanca. Both armies, 50,000 men each, have been marching and countermarching for days trying to outflank each other. Wellington eventually caught the French in an over-extended position and struck at the center. A very well balanced battle, where a better concentration gave the advantage to Wellington.<br/><br/>Sorauren is the last battle of the counteroffensive by Soult&rsquo;s reorganized army of Spain in July 1813. It was part of a series of engagements in late July 1813 called the Battle of the Pyrenees in which a combined British and Portuguese force under Sir Arthur Wellesley held off Marshal Soult's French forces attempting to relieve Pamplona. Attacking a thin red line in a very good defensive position, the French were eventually pushed back, but the battle could have turned very differently.<br/><br/>(source: Legion Games website)<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": ["First edition"], "age": "0", "name": "Quatre Batailles en Espagne", "playingtime": "0", "boardgamemechanic": ["Hex-and-Counter"], "average": "7.58824", "usersrated": "17", "boardgamefamily": ["Vive l'Empereur !"]}, "158493": {"rpgdesigner": ["Daniel Lenne\u00e9r"], "rpgitemversion": ["First Printing"], "statistics": [], "name": "R\u00f6jarens lag", "rpgartist": ["Tobias S\u00f6lvefjord", "Lukas Thelin"], "rpgproducer": ["Daniel Lenne\u00e9r"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2004930.jpg", "usersrated": "0", "average": "0", "rpggenre": ["Comedy / Satire", "Modern (Urban)"], "rpgpublisher": ["Svenilgames"], "rpg": ["Svenil Rollspelet"], "rpgcategory": ["Sourcebook (rules/options to enhance play)"], "poll": [], "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2004930_t.jpg", "description": "user summary<br/><br/>Source book for those who dwell on the darker side of the sprawling universe of Svenil.<br/>This book polarize characters into baddies as well as describes several antagonists and organizations.<br/><br/>"}, "158494": {"rpgdesigner": ["Daniel Lenne\u00e9r"], "rpgitemversion": ["First Printing"], "statistics": [], "name": "Vardagshj\u00e4ltens Manual", "rpgartist": ["Lukas Thelin"], "rpgproducer": ["Daniel Lenne\u00e9r"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2004936.jpg", "usersrated": "0", "average": "0", "rpggenre": ["Comedy / Satire", "Modern (Urban)"], "rpgpublisher": ["Svenilgames"], "rpg": ["Svenil Rollspelet"], "rpgcategory": ["Sourcebook (rules/options to enhance play)"], "poll": [], "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2004936_t.jpg", "description": "user summary<br/><br/>This sourcebook covers deeper aspects of the hero role in Svenil.<br/>It describes several aspects a character can focus on to further define his or her role as a protagonist.<br/><br/>It also includes several new characters, locations, organizations and rules for new weapons and gear.<br/><br/>"}, "158495": {"boardgamedesigner": ["kidd hsu"], "average": "6.70135", "poll": [], "name": "Da Yu: The Flood Conqueror", "playingtime": "30", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": ["Action / Movement Programming", "Action Point Allowance System", "Hand Management"], "yearpublished": "2014", "usersrated": "37", "maxplayers": "4", "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2017700_t.jpg", "boardgameartist": ["Tu Peishu"], "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["TwoPlus Games"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2017700.jpg", "boardgameversion": ["Chinese first edition"], "maxplaytime": "30", "boardgamecategory": ["Ancient", "Card Game"], "age": "10", "minplaytime": "30", "description": "Da Yu: The Flood Conqueror is a light strategy game in which players become ancient Chinese story characters who help Da Yu save the world from the flood.

It has fighters, cruisers, dreadnoughts, space stations and more.<br/><br/>Play is for 1 or 2 players.<br/><br/>It's easy to learn (maybe 15 minutes), setup takes about 5 minutes and play lasts less than an hour.<br/><br/>Features 216 double-sided tokens, representing a dozen different types of spaceships from small to huge!<br/><br/>You also get to fly round planets in proper orbits and everything.<br/><br/>The game mechanic is really simple, although it does follow proper space physics, its not complicated or hard - in fact it is very simple - very like the old dot-and-dash style games you might have played already.<br/><br/>Spaceships have a vector. They will fly on that vector forever. Applying thrust changes the vector.<br/><br/>The combat process is in the same vein as games like Ogre, Battle of the Bulge, and any Avalon Hill type hex-and-counter wargame.<br/><br/>Each unit has an attack range and strength.  No dice involved.  The defending unit loses a number of components based on the attack strength. Shields help defeat attacks.  Defender chooses what gets damaged and this is not revealed.<br/><br/>"}, "158499": {"boardgamedesigner": ["Kai Haferkamp"], "poll": [], "boardgamehonor": ["2013 Deutscher Lernspielpreis Nominee"], "name": "Die monsterstarke Musikschule", "playingtime": "25", "minplayers": "1", "yearpublished": "2013", "usersrated": "6", "boardgamefamily": ["Admin: Better Description Needed!", "Monsters", "Music Making & Makers", "Ravensburger Tiptoi"], "maxplayers": "4", "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2014259_t.jpg", "average": "5", "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["Ravensburger Spieleverlag GmbH"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2014259.jpg", "boardgameversion": ["Dutch edition", "French edition", "German edition"], "maxplaytime": "25", "boardgamecategory": ["Children's Game", "Educational", "Electronic"], "age": "4", "minplaytime": "25", "description": "IMPORTANT:<br/>To play this game you'll need the Ravensburger tiptoi-pencil - which is sold separately!<br/><br/>All monsters will participate in the major music competition of the country.
