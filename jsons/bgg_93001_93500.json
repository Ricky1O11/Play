Easy to understand Dueling rules are included on the backside of 3 the Attribute Cards and on both sides of the Reference card.<br/><br/>The Demo Deck contains the following 3 unique cards and 27 reprints from other sets:<br/><br/><br/>     Unique Body Attribute Card (strength 8)with instructions on reverse<br/>     Unique Mind Attribute Card (strength 8) with instructions on reverse<br/>     Unique Attribute X card (strength 4) with instructions on reverse<br/>     Standard double-sided reference card<br/>     26 Action Cards reprinted from 24 different decks, games and expansions.<br/><br/><br/>A Herocard Duel is the main conflict resolution mechanic of any Herocard game.<br/><br/>The players have 3 cards in place as reference, Body, Mind and Attribute X. Each card lists the amount of that attribute that is allowed to be played during a given turn. Each character within the various Herocard games contains a unique combination of attributes.<br/><br/>The attacking player lays a basic attack up to the ammount allowed by the corresponding attribute (most basic attacks use points in Body). The defending player may then play a basic defense card.<br/><br/>The attacking player may continue taking turns adding modifiers to that attack which the defending player may opt to modify his block to defend against.<br/><br/>If the total amount of the attack is greater than the total amount of the block, then the attack goes through. If the block is greater it is not successful.<br/><br/>The attacker's turn is now over and he may not recover any spent points until the beginning of his next turn.<br/><br/>The following turn begins with the next player clearing no more than 3 cards (always chosen from the top of the played stacks) and regaining those attribute points to spend. If the defender played more than 3 cards, he will have to leave one of the cards  uncleared and will not regain the full points in whatever attribute the card was left in.<br/><br/>In a Herocard game such as Orcwars or Rise of the Shogun, a player may move his pieces on the board which dictate who is eligible to be attacked. The purpose of the demo deck however is to familiarize the player with the deck dueling mechanics and has no board game associated with it. Player two is free to attack the other player or save points to counter the next attack. Either way, the duel is over at the first strike.<br/><br/>Action cards from the demo deck can be used in conjunction with any other action cards to create customized decks to expand any of the HeroCard titles. Each of the four characters from Tablestar's current Herocard games comes with a unique set of action cards thematically oriented to that game. The demo deck makes customized characters easy without disrupting currently existing decks.<br/><br/>"}, "93004": {"statistics": {}, "name": "RPG Review (Issue 3 - Mar 2009)", "rpgproducer": {"40016": "Lev Lafayette"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1354689.png", "usersrated": "1", "average": "9", "rpgissue": {"7805": "RPG Review"}, "rpgissuearticle": {"32352": "Administrivia and Editorial"}, "rpg": {"191": "Advanced Dungeons & Dragons (1st Edition)"}, "rpgissueversion": {"85705": "PDF Version"}, "poll": {}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1354689_t.png", "description": "From the cover<br/><br/>Mouse Guard...Easter Special GURPS Bunnies &amp; Burrows...Summerland...Fire &amp; Sword...Gulliver's Trading Company...Houses of the Blooded...Steve Long Interview...Paranoia Melbaplex...Palladium Revised...QADS...Classic D&amp;D Scenarios for Middle Earth...Sex in Blue Planet...Watchmen Review...Lord Orcus Listens!...A Crossword...Industry News<br/><br/>"}, "93005": {"statistics": {}, "name": "RPG Review (Issue 2 - Dec 2008)", "rpgproducer": {"40016": "Lev Lafayette"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1354688.png", "usersrated": "1", "average": "8", "rpgissue": {"7805": "RPG Review"}, "rpgissuearticle": {"32332": "Administrivia, Editorial and Letters"}, "rpg": {"1040": "Dragon Warriors (Revised Edition)"}, "rpgissueversion": {"85706": "PDF Version"}, "poll": {}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1354688_t.png", "description": "From the cover<br/><br/>Pathfinder Beta...Fantasy Australia...James Flowers Interview...Rolemaster - MERP and LoTR...A Walk In The Shire (WH FRPG)...White Hand Rising...Rolemaster PBeMs...Grey Ranks...Dragon Warriors Review, Disease and PBeM...Hellboy II Review...Mapping System...Virtual Combat System...Sacred Time Control...Lord Orcus Listens!...Industry News<br/><br/>"}, "93006": {"average": "5.75", "poll": {}, "name": "Resan genom Sagoland", "playingtime": "30", "minplayers": "1", "boardgamemechanic": {"2072": "Dice Rolling"}, "yearpublished": "0", "usersrated": "2", "maxplayers": "4", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1198848_t.jpg", "boardgameartist": {"57116": "Einar Norelius"}, "statistics": {}, "boardgamepublisher": {"10769": {"name": "Sago-Konst"}}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1198848.jpg", "boardgameversion": {"85707": "First edition"}, "maxplaytime": "30", "boardgamecategory": {"1041": {"name": "Children's Game"}}, "age": "1", "minplaytime": "30", "description": "This is a roll-and-move game which included pawns and a spinner for movement however in the rules it says that you easily exchange the spinner for a die.<br/><br/>The board is in a fold-out-format and has 113 spaces, some with events connected to them.

Some of the doors you know. They lead to the rooms of your friends, domains like your own which have been sculpted by their personalities, revealing secrets you wish you never knew.<br/><br/>Meeting in the waiting room is much less embarrassing. But even that grows old. Listening to the same stories over and over again, reading the same magazines, watching the same shows on a television that only seems to receive reruns from twenty years ago. The magazines are equally old, and never hint at current events. A new face would be a blessing.<br/><br/>Which is why you prowl the halls, looking for a way out of Limbo . . . a door your Mentor has forgotten to lock, or a passage leading to one of those Outer Planes you&rsquo;ve heard so much about. Paradise sounds like a nice place to visit, if for no other reason than to break up the monotony.<br/><br/>It was in the halls that you first saw the pimply youth. He wore a black t-shirt with the words, Horror Haven written on it in blood red. His face and torso were marred by gaping wounds, but the young man didn&rsquo;t seem bothered by his disfigurement.<br/><br/>You guided him to the waiting room, where your so called soul-mates sat on overstuffed chairs. You never could believe this sorry crew was cosmically linked to you. By the time you reached the waiting room, Paulie had grown faintly translucent. His ectoplasm trailed after him like a wake of smoke.<br/><br/>Paulie turned out to be a typical teenager, obsessed with horror movies and gory special effects. It was all he could talk about. The others gathered around him, as curious to meet a newcomer as you were. They bombarded him with questions about sports and world events. Your soul-mates always did have trouble letting go of their earthly obsessions.<br/><br/>A tunnel of light opened beneath Paulie, sucking him into its maw. The last shreds of his ectoplasmic body ripped from him, and you saw the spark of his lifeforce spinning into the vortex, dwindling on its way back to Earth.<br/><br/>What new form of flesh would Paulie find himself plunged into? Would he be a bathing beauty reclining in the sun of some Hawaiian beach? Or would he be a crab scuttling across the sand? Having met him, the latter seemed most likely. You shuddered, knowing your fate was just as repulsive. You needed more Karma to escape this cycle of rebirth, and that meant setting things right on earth.<br/><br/>A boy killed by a character from a movie. Surely an evil, supernatural force was loose in the world. It presented you a definite opportunity to gain some Karma, and thereby avoid Paulie&rsquo;s fate.<br/><br/>The tunnel of light remained open, beckoning. A hint, perhaps, from your reclusive Mentor?

In March 1994 Marquee Press published Cemetery Plots, the first and only supplement for Lost Souls.<br/><br/>After Marquee Press closed its doors, I revised the rules by incorporating Cemetery Plots into the main rulebook, eliminating inconsistencies between the two, and cleaning up some of the typos. I made this edition available online briefly in 1999. The rules presented here were updated again in 2007 and include many new enhancements and clarifications, especially involving character creation and setting up a campaign.<br/><br/>The rules for playing a mortal medium, last seen in the 1992 edition, have now been split into their own supplement called The Mortal Coil.<br/><br/>"}, "93031": {"statistics": {}, "name": "Dark Souls", "videogamemode": {"2313": "Cooperative"}, "videogameversion": {"85741": "English/European PlayStation 3 edition"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2221151.jpg", "videogameseries": {"18058": "Dark Souls"}, "videogametheme": {"2148": "Fantasy"}, "videogamefranchise": {"6404": "Greatest Hits (Best Selling PlayStation Games, US)"}, "videogamecharacter": {"25717": "Artorias The Abysswalker"}, "usersrated": "216", "average": "8.28958", "videogamegenre": {"2339": "Action RPG"}, "videogameplatform": {"4435": "PlayStation 3"}, "videogamehonor": {"31920": "2011 Game Critics Best Role Playing Game of the Year Nominee"}, "poll": {}, "vgcharacterversion": {"250033": "Artorias The Abysswalker"}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2221151_t.jpg", "description": "Dark Souls (\u30c0\u30fc\u30af\u30bd\u30a6\u30eb D\u0101ku Souru) is a video game being co-developed by From Software and Namco Bandai Games.

Por las tardes, me hac&iacute;a de un rollo de papel regalo y lo manejaba como mi florete, luchando contra Cahusac el guardia del cardenal, ante una audiencia invisible. Luego, ya m&aacute;s grande, hac&iacute;a a mis amigos actuar las partes de los caballeros de la corte. Como los otros ni&ntilde;os no ten&iacute;an idea de qu&eacute; era un caballero de la corte, yo comenc&eacute; a cambiar mis escenarios y nos hallamos luego haci&eacute;ndola de esp&iacute;as, detectives, ladrones, asesinos, astronautas, caballeros y mil cosas m&aacute;s. &iquest;A alguno de ustedes les suena esto familiar? M&aacute;s tarde, a los diecis&eacute;is, me top&eacute; con el cuerpo de mitos y fantas&iacute;as con el poder m&aacute;s grande de identificaci&oacute;n con los personajes que he conocido: el anime. Ya de ni&ntilde;a hab&iacute;a jugado a ser Elisa y torturado a la pobre Candy (todas las ni&ntilde;as quer&iacute;an ser Candy y ninguna me disputaba a Elisa; el acuerdo t&aacute;cito era que Elisa perd&iacute;a siempre al final, pero c&oacute;mo me divert&iacute;a haciendo sufrir a Candy en el &iacute;nterin), a ser Remi y actuar de cirquero con Coraz&oacute;n Alegre y el resto de la troupe, a Sandy Bell y a Gigi, a Mazinger Z... &iquest;Les suena m&aacute;s familiar esto? &iquest;Y qu&eacute; tal jugar a Caballeros del Zodiaco, Dragon Ball, Ranma 1/2, Sailor Moon y Marmalade Boy?<br/><br/>&ldquo;Yo quiero ser Vegeta&rdquo; &ldquo;&iexcl;Ah, no! Vegeta voy a ser yo!&rdquo; &ldquo;&iexcl;No! &iexcl;Buaaa!&rdquo;<br/><br/>&iquest;Demasiado infantil? &iquest;Nunca se han preguntado si existe alg&uacute;n tipo de juego m&aacute;s estructurado que el: &ldquo;Yo quiero ser...&rdquo;, un juego con reglas definidas que nos permita crear el tipo de historias sofisticadas que no nos avergonzar&iacute;a representar y s&iacute;, en cambio, nos llenar&iacute;a de gozo creativo?<br/><br/>&iquest;Han o&iacute;do hablar, ustedes, del juego de rol?<br/><br/>A los diecis&eacute;is, tambi&eacute;n, conoc&iacute; los juegos de rol. &Eacute;ramos magos y mat&aacute;bamos dragones. M&aacute;s tarde descubr&iacute; que ese escenario era uno de tantos y que pod&iacute;amos quitarlo y cambiarlo por otro y segu&iacute;amos teniendo un juego de rol. Pero lo que no encontraba eran manuales con reglas sencillas, de &eacute;sas que se aprenden en unos dos d&iacute;as. No, los juegos de rol, nacidos de los juegos de estrategia, son manuales de cientos de p&aacute;ginas dirigidos a aficionados devotos y expertos. Yo conozco al dedillo unos dos o tres sistemas y podr&iacute;a jugar algunos m&aacute;s si releyera los manuales, pero despu&eacute;s de a&ntilde;os de jugar rol.<br/><br/>&iquest;Y qu&eacute; ocurre con los miles de aficionados a las historias anime que asisten a las convenciones disfrazados de sus personajes favoritos e imaginan sus propias historias en la seguridad de su habitaci&oacute;n? &iquest;No puede haber un juego de rol para ellos?<br/><br/>Claro, est&aacute;n los juegos de rol basados en una sola historia de anime, como Bubblegum Crisis, pero... y si quisiera jugar a Sailor Moon? Est&aacute; bien, tambi&eacute;n est&aacute; el juego de rol de Sailor Moon. Pero, &iquest;y si quisiera a&ntilde;adirle un poco de Guerreras M&aacute;gicas (Rayearth), de Fatal Fury y una pizca de Metal Fighter Miku? Y si adem&aacute;s nunca he jugado rol y quiero un sistema de reglas sencillo que me ayude a imaginar con un soporte sistem&aacute;tico, pero no que dicho sistema se convierta en un fin en s&iacute; mismo? &iquest;Y si luego me canso de anime y s&oacute;lo quiero jugar a hacer una historia propia? &iquest;Eh? &iquest;Hay algo as&iacute;&iacute;&iacute;...?<br/><br/>No hab&iacute;a.<br/><br/>As&iacute; que decidimos hacer LABERINTO.<br/><br/>Google translation<br/>From Introduction:<br/><br/>When I was little and my favorite novel was The Three Musketeers , I always wanted to put me in the novel and making me the best friend of D'Artagnan, but constantly wondering how to make to fit into the story: I would disguise their child YME squire or page? In the evenings, I had a roll of gift paper and ran as my foil, fighting Cahusac cardinal's guard, to an invisible audience. Then, as larger did my friends act out the parts of the knights of the court. Like the other children had no idea what it was a gentleman of the court, I started to change my settings and we are then flown spies, detectives, thieves, murderers, astronauts, knights and a thousand other things. Do any of you does this sound familiar? Later, at sixteen, I came across the body of myths and fantasies with the greatest power of identification with the characters I've known: the anime. As a child he had played at being Elisa and tortured the poor Candy (all the girls wanted to be Candy and any disputed me to Elisa, the tacit agreement that Elisa was always lost in the end, but what I enjoyed doing suffer in the meantime Candy ) to be Remi and circus act with a cheerful heart and the rest of the troupe, and Gigi Sandy Bell, Mazinger Z. .. Does that sound more familiar? How about playing Saint Seiya, Dragon Ball, Ranma 1 / 2, Sailor Moon, Marmalade Boy?<br/><br/>&quot;I want to be Vegeta&quot; &quot;Ah, no! Vegeta will be me! &quot;&quot; No! BUAA! &quot;<br/><br/>Too childish? Ever have wondered if there is any game more structured than &quot;I want to be ...&quot;, a game with rules defined to allow us to create the kind of sophisticated stories that do not represent us and yes shame, however, fill us with joy creative?<br/><br/>Have you heard of, you, the role play?<br/><br/>At sixteen, also met RPGs. There were magicians and killing dragons. I later discovered that this scenario was one of many and that we could remove it and replace it and still had a role playing game. But what was not were manual with simple rules, the kind you learn in about two days. No, RPGs, born of the strategy games are hundreds of pages of manuals aimed at devoted fans and experts. I know by heart two or three systems and could play some more if you re-read the manuals, but after years of playing role.<br/><br/>What about the thousands of stories anime fans who attend conventions dressed as their favorite characters and imagine their own stories in the safety of your room? Can there be a role play for them?<br/><br/>Sure, RPGs are based on a single history of anime, and Bubblegum Crisis, but ... and if he wanted to play Sailor Moon? Okay, there's the RPG Sailor Moon. But what if you wanted to add a little Magic Knight Rayearth (Rayearth), Fatal Fury and a dash of Metal Fighter Miku? And if you've never played role and want a simple rule system that helps me to imagine a systematic support, but that system does not become an end in itself? So what if they get tired of anime and I just want to play to make their own history? Huh? Is there anything AsIII ...?<br/><br/>There was.<br/><br/>So we decided to MAZE.<br/><br/>"}, "93034": {"rpgitemversion": {"85757": "Softcover version"}, "poll": {}, "name": "EW-System Deluxe", "rpgproducer": {"45279": "France-Anne Ruolz"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic920582.jpg", "usersrated": "0", "average": "0", "statistics": {}, "rpg": {"9676": "EW-System"}, "rpgcategory": {"2083": "Core Rules (min needed to play)"}, "rpggenre": {"173": "Generic / Universal"}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic920582_t.jpg", "description": "<br/>User summary<br/><br/>EW-System Deluxe is the full-color core rulebook for the EW-System.<br/><br/>It contains rules for:<br/><br/>     Character creation<br/>     Task resolution<br/>     Combat<br/>     Character advancement<br/>     Equipment<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>"}, "93035": {"statistics": {}, "name": "Ken Uston BLACKJACK/POKER", "videogamemode": {"2422": "Local Multiplayer"}, "videogameversion": {"85758": "US ColecoVision edition"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic924433.jpg", "videogametheme": {"2404": "Card / Casino Games"}, "usersrated": "0", "average": "0", "videogamegenre": {"2402": "Classic Games"}, "videogameplatform": {"4419": "ColecoVision"}, "poll": {}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic924433_t.jpg", "description": "From the instruction booklet:<br/><br/>Ken Uston &quot;Mr. Blackjack&quot; gave up his position as Senior Vice President of the Pacific Stock Exchange and went off to beat the casinos of the world.

He was a toymaker by trade, and although he was a well liked and friendly man he never did get married nor have any children. Which is a shame because Geppeto was a man who loved children.<br/><br/>Despite the fact that he was one of the greatest toymakers within a hundred miles he was always poor, this is because he often gave away he toys for free to homeless children. When he did make people pay it was only enough to got more materials and food. Time passed and as those children grew up Geppeto grew older, eventually he grew too old to work. That was alright because the grateful people who he gave toys to when they were little gave him everything he needed, so that he could live out his old age in a manner that was much more comfortable than most of the rest of his life. His wits started to slip like old people's wits tend to do, and one day he went through the town proclaiming that one of his toys had come to life, he named him Pinocchio.<br/><br/>The towns people smiled at the old man and let him live on in his delusion. He had been alone for so long, it seemed nice that he was finally happy.<br/><br/>Weeks passed and more of his creations came alive, and children started to vanish. It was just the homeless kids at first but then others who were late for dinner...never came at all. A couple of the new comers to the city instantly blamed Geppeto, but most of the town still remembered his kindness towards them when they were children and the newcomers were ignored.<br/><br/>Time kept passing and children kept disappearing, again the newcomers spoke and this time people started to listen. A mob formed, they stormed to Geppeto's house both praying he was innocent but afraid of what they would find. What they did find was a scene of horror beyond compare.<br/><br/>They found the missing children.<br/><br/>Some of them had screws put into all their joints with rope attached so they were like a horrible puppet. Some of the children had their skin flayed off then painted over, some now had marbles for eyes, and almost none of them had tongues.<br/><br/>Geppeto couldn't handle the crying.<br/><br/>As for Geppeto there was no trace of him anywhere. The children that could be saved were, and the rest were given mercy. As for Geppeto he was no where to be found.<br/><br/>Over the next few years children from that particular town and many others would mysteriously vanish never to be seen again.

They make use of strategically deployed armies and barricades, occupy neutral cities to control their resources, and fight their way across the battlefield to capture their opponent's capital.<br/><br/>Fyrdwisa is a turn-based strategy game in which players spend action points and reveal resource cards to perform actions. Depending on the neutral cities they control, players receive between 1 and 6 action points each turn. Players may save action points from turn to turn (up to 12 points) to perform special actions or execute sudden military maneuvers. Depending on the number of players, there are up to 4 neutral cities for players to attack. Each city's resource is revealed when it is first occupied. The game includes cards for 10 possible city resources (which are assigned randomly) so each game plays out differently. When attacked, neutral cities may &quot;bribe&quot; players into retreating by providing them with a single-use special resource card.<br/><br/>Fyrdwisa is played on a cloth game board printed with a hexagonal battlefield. Each hexagon is divided into six triangles, in which players place small glass game pieces. Action point counters are printed in the corners of the game board, to assist in tracking available points each turn. City resources are printed on heavy stock paper cards.<br/><br/>"}, "93061": {"statistics": {}, "name": "Subtrade: Return to Irata", "videogamemode": {"2409": "Hotseat"}, "videogameversion": {"85801": "Amiga Version"}, "average": "6", "videogametheme": {"2403": "Board Game"}, "usersrated": "1", "videogamegenre": {"2458": "Management"}, "videogameplatform": {"4415": "Amiga"}, "poll": {}, "description": "Like M.U.L.E., the game is about four colonists (players) building up an economy on the planet Irata (Atari spelled backwards).

In contrast to M.U.L.E., the setting is transferred to a sub-oceanic world. The most notable change in game play is the addition of a fifth choice of how to outfit the labour element.

Due to the rising demand of players for a port of M.U.L.E. to newer systems and Electronic Art's refusal to develop it, several companies decided to develop unlicensed M.U.L.E. clones on their own.

Instead of the narrator adjusting the roll for the difficulty, the difficulty is front loaded.

It was also released for the Neo-Geo and Neo Geo CD systems, as well as SNK Arcade Classics Vol. 1 for the PS2 and PSP. Extremely difficult, its gameplay was heavily inspired by R-Type and its system of pod attached to the player's ship. Its first level remained memorable for its homage to the futuristic Neo-Tokyo depicted in the anime Akira.<br/><br/>Taking place many years in the future, mankind has developed the technology for space colonization. However, a mysterious computer virus infects the primary computer running man's first space station, causing it not only to affect its automated defenses, but to convince other humans to side with it. The computer attacks Earth so often that Earth's only hope is put into advanced spaceships wielding great firepower.<br/><br/>The game uses only two buttons. The player maneuvers the cyber jet with the joystick. If the player has the drone it will rotate in the same direction of the cyber jet. Press the A button to fire bullets. If you have the drone it will fire in the direction it is pointing. Provided you have the drone, hold the A button to power up the gauge and let go to launch the drone in the direction it is pointing. The higher the power in the gauge the bigger the damage the drone can cause. Press the B button to toggle the stoptrack position of the drone, so it will stay on that point by the cyber jet, but the cannon on the drone can still rotate.<br/><br/>To obtain the drone, collect a power up. If the power up is blue, the attacks are electrical-based. If the power up is red, the attacks are fire-based. Different power ups grant different weapons to add to the cyber jet's attacks. The Laser is effective for shooting through enemies, the Missiles are suitable for spreadfire attacks and the Horizontal bombs are good for attacks either side. The weapons can be powered up to three levels on the cyber jet. Speed power ups can also be added to increase the cyber jet's speed. The cyber jet is destroyed by crashing into enemy ships or hazards or by being shot. The drone can block most bullets, but not lasers or large shots.<br/><br/>The game has five stages. In each stage, the player has battle through swarms of enemy war machines and planes. In some stages mid-bosses can be battled. If the player makes it far enough and the cyber jet is destroyed, the game can resume to a checkpoint, but cyber jet will lose all its power ups. When the player gets to the end of the stage, the player will have to battle a robotic boss, aiming fire on its weak point to destroy it.<br/><br/>"}, "93148": {"statistics": {}, "name": "Demonsblood (Issue 7 - Mar 1980)", "rpgproducer": {"26361": "Brian Dolton"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic925763.jpg", "usersrated": "0", "average": "0", "rpgissue": {"2470": "Demonsblood"}, "rpg": {"191": "Advanced Dungeons & Dragons (1st Edition)"}, "rpgissueversion": {"85996": "First Printing"}, "poll": {}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic925763_t.jpg", "description": "User Summary:<br/><br/>Cover Art by Simon Washbourne.<br/><br/>Demonsblood was published as a combination of contributor &quot;minizines&quot; and regular articles.

Players must set the power, angle, and spin to connect with various enemies found throughout the levels. Once only one enemy remains, that enemy will transform into the hole. The different abilities that Kirby can obtain from many of the enemies make up a large part of the game, often being required for completion of a hole. These abilities include Kirby turning into a tornado (that can be steered), a sparkly ball (that can destroy certain obstacles), and a UFO (which allows Kirby to float and move at will for a short time). Other abilities include Kirby being able to slow down / float with a parasol, as well as stop completely as a stone.<br/><br/>The game has eight single player courses, with eight holes on each. There is a high score board for each level, with medals to be won on each of them. The player can unlock extra features (such as alternative versions of the courses) by winning the medals. There are Bronze, Silver, and Gold medals to be won, which are awarded to Kirby at the end of the course. There are also four two-player courses (again with eight holes).<br/>Kirby loses one of his health points (shown as tomatoes) every time he makes a shot, and gains one every time he hits an enemy or lands in a hole. In the two-player mode, two health points are awarded for landing in the hole first, and two health points can also be lost if one player's Kirby is &quot;attacked&quot; by the other player's by using an ability (such as the tornado or the stone). In the single-player mode, Kirby loses one life when all his health points are gone or fall off the stage ; when Kirby runs out of lives, the game will end. Afterwards, the player can either continue from the beginning of the course or exit it. In the two-player mode, the loss of all health points causes that player to miss a turn, as their Kirby falls asleep.<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;Kirby's dream course&quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "93158": {"rpgitemversion": {"86028": "PDF Version"}, "poll": {}, "name": "Dungeon Tiles: Rooms & Corridors Set #2", "rpgproducer": {"44884": "Chris Kentlea"}, "average": "0", "usersrated": "0", "statistics": {}, "rpg": {"356": "Generic / Universal"}, "rpgcategory": {"2086": "Accessory (dice, maps, screens, cards)"}, "rpgseries": {"18421": "Dungeon Tiles (by Unnead Games)"}, "rpggenre": {"961": "Fantasy"}, "description": "User Summary<br/><br/>The second dungeon tiles set includes several room &amp; corridor tiles along with an underground river collection.<br/><br/>"}, "93159": {"statistics": {}, "name": "Reggie Jackson Baseball", "videogamemode": {"2422": "Local Multiplayer"}, "videogameversion": {"86032": "Europe Sega Master System edition"}, "average": "0", "videogametheme": {"2360": "Sports - Baseball"}, "usersrated": "0", "videogamegenre": {"2157": "Sports"}, "videogameplatform": {"4438": "SEGA Master System"}, "poll": {}, "description": "User Summary<br/><br/>A Major League Baseball game for the Sega Master System.

To play this game you need to get hold of a few friends, a couple of six-sided dice and an attitude. Finally you need to get a survival instinct. You won't be playing for long without one. Then again, ZAIBATSU is less of a game and more of a training manual for the urban nightmare that is near-future Tokyo.<br/><br/>Take Gibson's &quot;Neuromancer&quot; and related short stories; the visual kick of &quot;Bladerunner&quot;, &quot;Black Rain&quot; and &quot;Akira&quot;; take the format and tangled firefights of Bullfrog's &quot;Syndicate&quot; game and splintered shards of Medieval Japan. The result is ZAIBATSU; roleplaying Japanese cyberpunk. Mean and moody manga. ZAIBATSU isn't watered down cyberpunk, near future elements from the best sources are here: replicants, lasers and cyborgs. All set in Gibson's futureworld: Tokyo gone global. Tokyo. The world's capital, largest, most high-tech, most happening city on Earth. Japanese culture is prevalent in many nations, just as American was in the 20th century. And the players are at the heart of this vast superpower. This is unique to ZAIBATSU, as is the world's retrogenics technology. Forget cybernetics in the traditional roleplaying game sense; with tech out of date as soon as it leaves the production line, no sucker is going to trade meat for metal if his new arm, say, will be redundant in two months. Now, updating the meat, that's something else... By the time we build a &quot;stronger, faster&quot; cybernetic arm or leg to replace the real limb, we will undoubtedly be able to regenerate a limb with clone technology. It's not too far away. The next step is to augment the DNA to grow a stronger limb, and after that use DNA viruses to alter existing limbs. Etc, etc.<br/><br/>Most of the rules in ZAIBATSU have been left to a minimum. Some may find this disturbing or annoying, but previous experience with other games has shown a distinct lack of atmosphere in supposedly fast combats. Keep combat fluid and verbal, fast and confusing. These are fast, and should be played that way. When you encounter something not in the rules - make it up! After all, that's just what I did in designing the game. The character design rules in particular are brief and to the point. Again this is for speed of play. It is not difficult for the player (or indeed the referee) to memorize the characters' skills since each has only six, with only one value (you've either got it or you haven't).<br/><br/>"}, "93163": {"statistics": {}, "name": "Winfall", "playingtime": "60", "minplayers": "1", "yearpublished": "2009", "usersrated": "1", "maxplayers": "6", "average": "6", "boardgamepublisher": {"4": {"name": "(Self-Published)"}}, "boardgameversion": {"86037": "First Edition"}, "maxplaytime": "60", "poll": {}, "age": "8", "minplaytime": "60", "description": "WINFALL is for anyone who has ever dreamed about what they would do if they won the lottery.

The player, impersonating a &quot;flashlight and harpoon gun&quot; equipped archaeologist had to ascend a series of rocky platforms in a Lost World scenario to reach a Phoenix bird, the object of his quest.  Along the way he had to avoid ferocious man-sized dinosaurs and belligerent red-haired cavemen against whom he had no direct means of offense.  The only ways to defeat the opponents were either temporary (dazing them with the flashlight) or indirect (waiting for them to be suspended on a harpoon rope to make them fall down), and element which added a certain amount of trickiness to the game, unusual for its time.  Bonus to collect along the way included fallen phoenix feathers and phoenix eggs, which granted the player invulnerability from the prehistoric denizens for a short period of time.<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;Roc 'N Rope&quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "93181": {"statistics": {}, "name": "Gun Metal", "videogamemode": {"2149": "Single-Player"}, "videogameversion": {"86082": "German Windows edition"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2555298.jpg", "videogametheme": {"2264": "Science Fiction"}, "usersrated": "1", "average": "6", "videogamegenre": {"2160": "First Person Shooter"}, "videogameplatform": {"4977": "Windows"}, "poll": {}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2555298_t.jpg", "description": "Gun Metal is a 3-D shooting game, released in 2002, for the Xbox and PC by the now defunct Rage Software Limited.

Unlike most medieval/fantasy beat 'em ups it featured an isometric viewing angle, some platforming (usually involving players stacking rocks or crates to climb on and jump to treasure chests), unusually large stylised sprites, and variable blood/gore settings.<br/><br/>In this game, up to four players can choose four characters in four different occupations: a knight, a brawler, an archer and a wizard. Collecting treasure gave the characters experience points, and levelling up shortened the time it took a character to charge his/her super attack (by holding the attack button).<br/><br/>In addition to treasure, items included food (which restored health) elemental upgrades to weapons (which made them stronger against specific opponents) various single-use thrown weapons (and a five-shot crossbow), shields that would automatically block enemy attacks for a short time, and refills for a player's &quot;magic&quot; (basically a desperation move). Often, instead of items or treasure, a chest/barrel/etc. would contain a trap like &quot;freezing smoke&quot;, poison gas, lightning, or even traps that temporarily transformed the player into small animals who could move but not attack.<br/><br/>The enemies in the game were fairly standard for fantasy arcade games, including orcs, slimes, lizardmen, werewolves, carnivorous plants, harpies, and others. Bosses included demons, giant snakes, spider-women, and more. The game also featured numerous branching paths that presented different rooms, secret areas, and even different bosses, and had to be played through multiple times to see all of the rooms available.<br/><br/>"}, "93199": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic934199.jpg", "poll": {}, "boardgamedesigner": {"45341": {"name": "Corinna Harder"}}, "statistics": {}, "yearpublished": "2010", "maxplayers": "14", "boardgameartist": {"12116": "Bernhard Skopnik"}, "boardgamepublisher": {"5640": {"name": "Kikigagne?"}}, "maxplaytime": "20", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic934199_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "20", "boardgamecategory": {"1002": {"name": "Card Game"}}, "description": "How could that have happened?

The player is a Ranger, one of a group of non-military volunteers who are given small ships, free rein and the task of helping to battle, understand and ultimately defeat the menace.<br/><br/>Gameplay<br/>The game is dynamic and open-ended in a fashion that has been compared to Elite and Star Control 2.[2] Trade prices on planets follow supply and demand, the wars are ongoing non-scripted conflicts, computer-controlled ships have individual capabilities, goals and relations, etc. There are even several ways to complete the storyline. The games have turn-based space travel and combat, optional shoot 'em up sequences and occasional bits of text adventure.<br/><br/>Background<br/>Long ago now wise and peaceful Gaal race was very aggressive and was creating a huge number of colonies. Due to large space distances it created hyperjumper which could make holes in the galaxy. Soon one of the colonies met with Klissan fleet. Although Gaal colony ships tried to communicate with Klissan ships they failed to do that and were destroyed. Soon Makhpella, the mothership of all Klissans and Klissan fleet invaded all outer Gaal colonies. Gaal colony fleet was completely helpless and in order to save original Gaal territories and Gaal motherland itself from invasion they decided not to jump back and make Makhpella trace the route there but to blow up the remaining other colonies using the hyperjumper.<br/><br/>Not very long ago everything was started by Peleng captain called Rachekhan who was one of commanders of Peleng fleet. He was thrown out of the fleet and became a pirate. Since he had an access to secret documents and weaponry he stole a hyperjumper. While travelling with it he met Makhpella. It considered Rachekhan's pirate fleet as an enemy and started chasing it. During the chase Rachekhan and Klissan fleets went through interstellar coalition sectors so Makhpella spotted IC sectors and now knew its location and identified all IC races as foes. So the war started.<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;Space Rangers (video game)&quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "93222": {"boardgamedesigner": {"33303": {"name": "Benjamin D.

They may also switch the stones in their hands with other players throughout the game.  When someone drops her last stone into Pandora's Box, the box is opened, its contents revealed and taken by the player who opened it, and each player scores points for white stones in hand and loses a point for black stones in hand.<br/><br/>Though it sounds incredibly simple, the game is fast, deep, thrilling, and offers tremendous psychological fun and unexpected results.

It was one of the first ultra-violent video games and a frequent target of parental criticism of the arcade game industry. The object is to arrest and kill drug offenders, confiscate their money and drugs, and defeat &quot;Mr. Big&quot;. It was ported, not long after, to the NES and several home computer systems in 1990. In 2005, it was also updated into a brand new game for the Xbox and PS2.<br/><br/>Released in 1988, it was the first game in the newly restarted Williams Electronics coin op division, and features their notable use of digitized graphics (later made famous in games such as Mortal Kombat). In fact, the quality of the graphics in terms of number of colors would not be surpassed until the game Mortal Kombat II (released in 1993). The game features what in arcade terminology is termed a medium resolution monitor - higher resolution than televisions and normal arcade monitors, although often in a smaller physical size. NARC was also the very first arcade game to utilize the TI TMS34010, which is a 32-bit processor.

A planned Nintendo GameCube version was later canceled. Although the update was slated to be a straight remake of the story from the arcade game, the version that was eventually released featured a totally new story. Several well-known stars are involved with the voice acting in NARC, including Michael Madsen, Bill Bellamy, and Ron Perlman. The game's soundtrack features artists such as Curtis Mayfield, Cypress Hill, Grandmaster Flash, Lynyrd Skynyrd, and indie artists such as Point Game and Camden. The update casts the player as narcotics officer Jack Forzenski and DEA agent Marcus Hill, former partners reunited who are instructed to investigate a new drug on the streets called Liquid Soul.<br/><br/>One of the most controversial aspects of the game is that after arresting dealers and confiscating their stock, the player can either take the confiscated items to the evidence room, or keep them for future use. This confers benefits such as improved weapons accuracy. Dealing drugs for financial benefit is also possible. The integration of drug use by the protagonist is in complete contrast to the anti-drug message of the original arcade game.

A Summoner is both mage and general, and must combine their wizardly might with clever tactics to defeat the enemy Summoner on the opposite side of the battle.<br/><br/>The Summoner Wars Master Set contains six new and different complete factions from which to choose:<br/><br/>&bull; Play as the Shadow Elves and conceal your plans in swirling darkness!<br/>&bull; Choose the Benders and confound your foe, turning his own troops against him!<br/>&bull; Command the Vargath, mountainous goatfolk who call lightning from the heavens!<br/>&bull; Select the nefarious Sand Goblins and delight in malicious trickery!<br/>&bull; Muster the Deep Dwarves and control the forces of Geomancy!<br/>&bull; Lead the ferocious Swamp Orcs to war and hack upon your foes as they are snared in your vines!<br/><br/>Strategy shapes the composition of each deck of cards and how they are used. Tactics determine the effectiveness of those cards in battle. Call walls of stone to protect you in combat and serve as magic portals for you to summon your warriors. Call your forces forth and send them in a surging wave against your enemy. Cast spells that bolster your forces and cut down those who would oppose you.<br/><br/>Victory can come only from the death of your opponent's Summoner...<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": {"238591": "Brazilian Portuguese edition"}, "maxplaytime": "30", "average": "7.61252", "name": "Summoner Wars: Master Set", "playingtime": "30", "boardgamemechanic": {"2072": "Dice Rolling"}, "age": "9", "boardgameexpansion": {}, "usersrated": "8833", "boardgameaccessory": {"152861": "Summoner Wars: Fan Art Summoners"}, "boardgamesubdomain": {"4667": "Customizable Games"}, "boardgamefamily": {"7687": "Summoner Wars"}}, "93261": {"average": "0", "poll": {}, "name": "Your World: 5 Games About You and Your World", "playingtime": "15", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": {"2035": "Roll / Spin and Move"}, "yearpublished": "2004", "usersrated": "0", "maxplayers": "2", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic933719_t.jpg", "boardgameartist": {"45285": "Kevin Rechin"}, "statistics": {}, "boardgamepublisher": {"2257": {"name": "innovative KIDS"}}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic933719.jpg", "boardgameversion": {"86287": "First edition"}, "maxplaytime": "15", "boardgamecategory": {"1041": {"name": "Children's Game"}}, "age": "0", "minplaytime": "15", "description": "Your World is a five-game compendium designed to help a child explore different aspects of their world.

The player pilots a small spaceship instead of a simple dot and the enemies come in the form of various aliens.<br/><br/>The overall gameplay is identical to that of Qix. However, the main enemy is no longer a collection of lines - instead it varies between levels, and is always accompanied by smaller enemies. When the player's spaceship succeeds in claiming a section of the level, the side where the main enemy is taken as &quot;the outside&quot;. Any smaller enemies ending up on &quot;the inside&quot; are killed, resulting in point bonuses. In order to complete a level, the player must claim at least 80% of a level's area. Previously, the limits were 75% in Qix and 70% in Super Qix. Each level in Volfied has a unique background and enemies. As the player claims areas of the level the cleared area graphic is replaced with the graphic of the next level. Grey boxes also appear on the field - these give the player a random power-up when collected. Power ups can grant the player speed or even weapons. There is a special completion bonus on certain levels, often attained by shooting the main enemy.<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;Volfied&quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "93346": {"rpg": {"2791": "Pathfinder System Compatible Product"}, "poll": {}, "name": "Spring Cleaning Sale", "rpgproducer": {"45444": "Benjamin Gerber"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1571837.png", "usersrated": "0", "rpgitemversion": {"86492": "PDF Version"}, "rpgsetting": {"9716": "The World of Aruneus"}, "average": "0", "statistics": {}, "rpggenre": {"961": "Fantasy"}, "rpgcategory": {"2108": "Sourcebook (rules/options to enhance play)"}, "rpgseries": {"9717": "Troll in the Corner's Magical Emporium"}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1571837_t.png", "description": "From the book:<br/>Hello folks, it's that time again!

I wanted a short adventure that allowed players to test their characters and flex their dungeon delving skills. It had been a long time since we&rsquo;d gone through an old fashion dungeon crawl. Another purpose of this adventure was to provide the players with a few more coins to upgrade their equipment, but much of the treasure, as the GM will discover, is not the loose coins the players will find. Lastly, the players could chose to clear out and repair the workshop to use as a base of operations. We know how players like to have their own clubhouse.<br/><br/>There are skill challenges included. If you are a GM who loathes skill checks, ignore them. Black them out if they offend.

The unit includes Sergeant John Merrill, machinegunner Jim Walsh, sniper Sonny Armstrong, grenade launcher operator Carl Dillan and combat engineer Bill Kirby. In some missions they can count only on themselves, while in the others they act together with regular US and South-Vietnamese troops.<br/><br/>The North Vietnam campaign tells the story of two Soviet military consultants and two soldiers of the North Vietnam Army who are the only survivors of an ambush prepared by the US troops. The task of getting back to the North Vietnam territory is a difficult one, they have no means of radio communication, no wheeled vehicles, and it&rsquo;s too far to make it there on foot.

Its name is directly derived from the dice mechanic it uses to resolve actions. Multi10 uses d10-based dice pools, rolling a number of dice equal to your attribute and multiplying the highest-scoring die by your skill rating to generate an action score. Most similar systems simply add the attribute and the skill rating together to calculate the size of the dice pool, but the multiplication twist makes skills quite important and prevents players from simply focusing on attributes to get large dice pools. A system of specialties that allows for high character customization further builds on this simple premise. Combat is fast, mostly realistic and deadly. The ability to perform quick or slow-but-precise attacks and spread actions over multiple phases adds a tactical element to battles without resorting to long and cumbersome lists of special actions and manoeuvres.<br/><br/>"}, "93388": {"rpg": {"9723": "Multi10"}, "statistics": {}, "name": "Multi10 Character Record Sheet", "rpgproducer": {"41934": "George Chatzipetros"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic934850.jpg", "usersrated": "1", "rpgitemversion": {"86581": "PDF Version"}, "average": "7.5", "rpggenre": {"940": "Action / Adventure"}, "rpgcategory": {"2086": "Accessory (dice, maps, screens, cards)"}, "poll": {}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic934850_t.jpg", "description": "User Summary<br/>This is a blank character sheet made for the Multi10 system.<br/><br/>"}, "93389": {"poll": {}, "name": "Linkology: Animals", "playingtime": "15", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": {"2040": "Hand Management"}, "yearpublished": "0", "usersrated": "3", "boardgamefamily": {"9724": "Linkology"}, "maxplayers": "6", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic924341_t.jpg", "average": "6.66667", "statistics": {}, "boardgamepublisher": {"4304": {"name": "Albi"}}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic924341.jpg", "boardgameversion": {"86583": "Czech edition"}, "maxplaytime": "15", "boardgamecategory": {"1089": {"name": "Animals"}}, "age": "8", "minplaytime": "15", "description": "The Linkology game is a fast and fun card game that links science concepts together in a way that reinforces vocabulary and classification skills.

A coalition of five allied races: Maloqs, Pelengs, Humans, Faeyans and Gaalians stakes on space rangers called up to root out dominators.<br/><br/>The player becomes a ranger, selects a race, and gets a space ship and necessary equipment. Since that moment he finds himself in a real world of rangers which does not exist in any other computer game where he can engage in all possible types of activities: fight in the space or the hyperspace, buy and sell goods, accomplish government tasks, liberate planets from dominators in 3D battles and, of course, play text quests each of them being a separate game.<br/><br/>It is impossible to foresee the development of events.

Two Earth Defense Commanders, Lori Bergin and Barry Mayers, were returning from a research and destroy mission regarding the latest Barrax technologies on planet Urania, when suddenly a Barrax cruiser materialized behind them, brought their ship in and took the commanders hostage on planet Terrainia.

The player's fighters carry unlimited projectile weaponry and a finite number of Nova Smart Bombs.<br/><br/>Notable features of the game are relatively big sprites (with Predator-esque cloaking effects applied to a few) and numerous weapon upgrades (supposedly 25 in total).

It was a launch title for both the Neo-Geo MVS (arcade) and AES (home) systems, and was one of the pack-in games for the Neo-Geo AES. Like many earlier SNK games, it is well-known for its challenging difficulty.<br/><br/>It was re-released through the Virtual Console download service in Europe and Australia on October 26, 2007, and in North America on October 29, 2007. Most recently it was included in SNK Arcade Classics Vol. 1, released for the Wii, PlayStation 2 and PlayStation Portable in North America on May 1, 2008.<br/><br/>The player controls the wizard Elta, the last magician lord, on his quest to save his homeland from the evil wizard Gal Agiese. The evil wizard is seeking the god of destruction Az Atorse whom he plans to resurrect this using eight tomes of mystical power. As Elta, the player must battle through eight levels to find each of the tomes before he can reach Gal's fortress, and seal away the evil deity once again.<br/><br/>Elta has to jump, shoot and climb his way to the end of each level where he must beat a servant of Gal, along with one of Gal's sinister boss creations, in order to progress through the game. To complete the game Elta must reach the final stage and defeat Az Atorse himself. The gameplay is typical to a standard action-platformer fitted for arcade machines and thus very challenging. If the player takes too long to complete a stage, then they will be harassed by an invincible monster. Aside from the fantasy themes there's an added twist of transformations that make the wizard more powerful and grants him new attacks. When he has not been transformed, Elta's primary form of attack is a weak but fast-moving energy projectile that he can shoot in four directions; left, right, up and (while jumping) down.<br/><br/>These are the forms that Elta can assume by picking up combinations of colored orbs found throughout the stages:<br/><br/>Dragon Warrior: In this form Elta attacks by breathing fire; a continuous short-range attack that can also be aimed diagonally unlike his standard attack.<br/>Waterman: The Waterman-form attacks with water grenades - blue bubbles of water that explode into water pillars upon touching the ground. The attack can hit several times for additional damage but only covers a small area.<br/>Poseidon: A more powerful version of the Waterman, Poseidon shoots wide waves of water that travels along the ground for several hits. It does severe damage and causes enemies to freeze and shatter on impact. While very powerful, this form moves very slowly.<br/>Shinobi: The Shinobi-form gains increased agility and attacks with powerful magical archs of fire which are wide but slow-moving.<br/>Samurai: While limited in range, the Samurai-form is the only form that can attack through barriers, such as walls, shields or even multiple enemies, using a boomerang-like energy attack that does heavy damage.<br/>Raijin: The Raijin-form gives Elta's jumping ability a big boost as well as a unique attack that creates a continuous electrical field around his body.<br/><br/>"}, "93459": {"statistics": {}, "name": "Mechanized Attack", "videogamemode": {"2313": "Cooperative"}, "videogameversion": {"86724": "Arcade Edition"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1557709.png", "videogametheme": {"2318": "War - Future"}, "usersrated": "1", "average": "4", "videogamegenre": {"2314": "Arcade"}, "videogameplatform": {"4781": "Arcade"}, "poll": {}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1557709_t.png", "description": "User Summary<br/><br/>A lightgun shooter where you shoot enemies using uzis and grenades.

It was released in Japan in 1995 and was followed by a sequel, Mega Man 2: The Power Fighters, the following year. Both games were ported to home consoles in North America in 2004 as part of the Mega Man Anniversary Collection for PlayStation 2, Nintendo GameCube and Xbox and in Japan during the same year as part of two game compilation titled Rockman: Power Battle Fighters (\u30ed\u30c3\u30af\u30de\u30f3 \u30d1\u30ef\u30fc\u30d0\u30c8\u30eb\u30d5\u30a1\u30a4\u30bf\u30fc\u30ba?), also for the PlayStation 2.

Two players can play the game together as different characters, teaming up to defeat the bosses.<br/><br/>The game plays much like the main Mega Man games - the player uses one button to jump, and one to fire the character's arm-mounted energy gun. Holding the fire button charges the gun in order to release a stronger blast. Holding down while pressing the jump button makes the character do a dash, the appearance of which varies between characters.<br/><br/>After choosing a character, the player chooses between three &quot;stories&quot;, with each one having different Robot Masters from various games. The &quot;stories&quot; are Mega Man 1-2, 3-6 and Mega Man 7. Upon choosing a &quot;story&quot;, the game quickly pans through the various levels, letting the player choose one roulette-style.<br/><br/>A level is largely different from the mainstream Mega Man games; instead of going through an entire stage and fighting the Robot Master as a boss at the end, the player faces the Robot Master immediately. Killing a Robot Master earns the player their weapon, which can be switched to by pressing a button. Like in most Mega Man games, each Robot Master is weak to another one's weapon, so the player can fight through them in a &quot;rock-paper-scissors&quot; kind of way.<br/><br/>"}, "93462": {"videogame": {"80455": "Mega Man Anniversary Collection"}, "statistics": {}, "name": "Mega Man 2: The Power Fighters", "videogamemode": {"2313": "Cooperative"}, "videogameversion": {"86732": "JP Arcade Edition"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1557712.png", "videogameseries": {"4778": "Mega Man"}, "videogametheme": {"2264": "Science Fiction"}, "usersrated": "1", "average": "3", "videogamegenre": {"2314": "Arcade"}, "videogameplatform": {"4781": "Arcade"}, "poll": {}, "videogamecompilation": {"80455": "Mega Man Anniversary Collection"}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1557712_t.png", "description": "Mega Man 2: The Power Fighters, known in Japan as Rockman 2: The Power Fighters\u200b (\u30ed\u30c3\u30af\u30de\u30f32\u30fb\u30b6\u30fb\u30d1\u30ef\u30fc\u30d5\u30a1\u30a4\u30bf\u30fc\u30ba), is an arcade video game, released in Japan in 1996 as a fighting game in the Mega Man series of games. It is the direct sequel to Mega Man: The Power Battle released the previous year. Both games were ported to home consoles in North America in 2004 as part of the Mega Man Anniversary Collection for PlayStation 2, Xbox, and GameCube and in Japan during the same year as part of two game compilation titled Rockman: Power Battle Fighters (\u30ed\u30c3\u30af\u30de\u30f3 \u30d1\u30ef\u30fc\u30d0\u30c8\u30eb\u30d5\u30a1\u30a4\u30bf\u30fc\u30ba), also for the PlayStation 2.

However, in The Power Fighters, the epilogues are more detailed and have more to do with past and future Mega Man games, providing vague explanations regarding characters and canon, most notably the Evil Energy incident from Mega Man 8 and how Dr. Wily created Zero from the Mega Man X series.<br/><br/>The gameplay is roughly the same as in Mega Man: The Power Battle, as it keeps the controls, stages and weapon-copying. There are however several new additions. The playable characters are Mega Man, Proto Man, Bass and Duo, with Duo being a new addition to the cast. The four characters feature different attributes and abilities. When playing 2-Player, only one of the players can get the Robot Master's weapon.<br/><br/>As in The Power Battle there are three &quot;stories&quot; to choose from after; finding Dr. Wily, saving Roll, and recovering the stolen parts. All stories have different Robot Masters to fight, and halfway through it the player is given a different power-up. Unlike the previous game, The Power Fighters lets the player choose freely between Robot Master stages, and is given some hints on what the Robot Masters weaknesses are. Each of the characters can perform a special attack, which is executed by releasing a full buster charge while holding the joystick up. Megaman's special move, the &quot;Mega Upper,&quot; is simply a jumping uppercut (like the Shoryuken); Protoman's special move, the &quot;Proto Strike,&quot; allows him to shoot a massive, short-ranged burst of energy; Bass' special move, the &quot;Crescent Kick,&quot; (Which is like the Flash Kick, Another Street Fighter ability), lets him perform a somersaulting kick; Duo's special move, the &quot;Giant Knuckle,&quot; is a standing uppercut that flings the enemy upwards (if the attack button is pressed again after the uppercut, Duo will jump up and slam the enemy down to the ground).<br/><br/>As the player damages the Robot Masters, various energy pellets pop out from them. Some of these are just for points, but others will restore health, weapon energy, or both. When the robot master is defeated, a multitude of these pellets are released, as well as a capsule containing the boss's special weapon. During a two-player game, only the player who picks up the capsule will get the special weapon (similar to those seen in Mega Man 8). One of the items that can appear during battle will summon a robot helper. Mega Man summons Rush, who will do a dash attack towards the enemy when Mega Man fires a charged shot, and can be bounced from using the Rush Coil. Bass summons Treble, who will fire plasma shots each time Bass fires his buster, and perform a dash attack similar to Rush's when Bass fires a charged shot. Protoman and Duo both summon Beat, who will give them an energy shield that makes them completely invincible for a short time. These summoning abilities will last until their energy runs out, and they cannot be cancelled. While a helper or their effect is active, special weapons cannot be used. Lastly, each Robot Master now has an Overdrive mode; after a Robot Master loses half or more of their health, the screen will go dark, they will flash, and their attack patterns will change. Some Robot Masters will gain new moves, some will gain new weapons, and others will simply become much harder to hit.<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;Mega Man 2: The Power Fighters&quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "93463": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic924772.jpg", "poll": {}, "boardgamedesigner": {"12322": {"name": "Alex Weldon"}}, "statistics": {}, "yearpublished": "2010", "maxplayers": "4", "boardgameartist": {"12322": "Alex Weldon"}, "boardgamepublisher": {"15009": {"name": "MJ Games"}}, "maxplaytime": "30", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic924772_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "30", "boardgamecategory": {"1089": {"name": "Animals"}}, "description": "In Picnic Blitz, you want to bring ants to the picnic and eat enough food to claim your place on top of the anthill.<br/><br/>The game is played on a small game board, with each player taking six colored ant tokens and four Queen tokens being placed to the side.

The winner of the game is the first to reach 50 points.<br/><br/>"}, "93495": {"statistics": {}, "name": "Drag\u00e3o Brasil  (Issue 44 - Nov 1998)", "rpgproducer": {"44272": "Roberto Avelino"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic925178.jpg", "usersrated": "0", "average": "0", "rpgissue": {"1356": "Drag\u00e3o Brasil"}, "rpg": {"721": "3D&T"}, "rpgissueversion": {"86805": "Drag\u00e3o Brasil  (Issue 44)"}, "poll": {}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic925178_t.jpg", "description": "Table of Contents<br/><br/>    2 - Bard's News<br/>    8 - Vampire 3th edition all about the new version<br/>    11 - Reader's Scroll<br/>    16 - ABC of RPG tips to play well in Mage<br/>    20 - Green Hell: the Mission the Werewolves of Amazonia<br/>    26 - Holy Avenger first part, for AD&amp;D and GURPS<br/>    46 - Master's Tips creating lost worlds<br/>    50 - Troubleshooters gods for your clerics<br/>    53 - Quotation Magic<br/>    61 - Comics Calling of Nature<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>"}, "93496": {"statistics": {}, "name": "Drag\u00e3o Brasil  (Issue 43 - Oct 1998)", "rpgproducer": {"44272": "Roberto Avelino"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic925197.jpg", "usersrated": "0", "average": "0", "rpgissue": {"1356": "Drag\u00e3o Brasil"}, "rpg": {"721": "3D&T"}, "rpgissueversion": {"86809": "Drag\u00e3o Brasil  (Issue 43)"}, "poll": {}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic925197_t.jpg", "description": "Table of Contents<br/><br/>    2 - Bard's News<br/>    8 - Anjos new RPG for Arkanun line<br/>    9 - Reader's Scroll<br/>    14 - ABC of RPG tips of combat for Battletech<br/>    20 - 3D&amp;T new rules of skills<br/>    26 - United by Evil villains for GURPS and AD&amp;D<br/>    36 - San Michael's Cathedral scenario for Arkanun<br/>    40 - Masks of Wax adventure for Vampire<br/>    46 - Master's Tips problematic players<br/>    50 - Troubleshooters creation of a background<br/>    53 - Quotation Magic<br/>    61 - Comics Heroes Journey<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>"}, "93497": {"rpgitemversion": {"86810": "Hardcover"}, "rpgseries": {"9713": "Warcraft: The Roleplaying Game"}, "name": "Lands of Conflict", "rpgproducer": {"13957": "Andrew Bates"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1070590.jpg", "usersrated": "1", "rpgsetting": {"914": "Warcraft"}, "average": "7", "statistics": {}, "rpg": {"524": "d20 System / OGL Product (D&D 3.5 Compatible)"}, "poll": {}, "rpgcategory": {"2107": "Campaign Setting (game world)"}, "rpggenre": {"155": "Fantasy (High Fantasy)"}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1070590_t.jpg", "description": "From the back of the book:<br/><br/>Return to the East!<br/>Undead march uncontested across the plains of Lordaeron and Alliance remnants struggle for survival in this campaign setting sourcebook for the Dungeons &amp; Dragons&reg; Warcraft&reg; the Roleplaying Game, which translates the hugely successful Warcraft&reg; computer game series into an exciting pen-and-paper roleplaying game world based on the popular revised d20 System rules!<br/><br/>Requires the use of the Dungeons &amp; Dragons Player's Handbook, Edition 3.5, published by Wizards of the Coast&reg;.
