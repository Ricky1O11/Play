Easy to understand Dueling rules are included on the backside of 3 the Attribute Cards and on both sides of the Reference card.<br/><br/>The Demo Deck contains the following 3 unique cards and 27 reprints from other sets:<br/><br/><br/>     Unique Body Attribute Card (strength 8)with instructions on reverse<br/>     Unique Mind Attribute Card (strength 8) with instructions on reverse<br/>     Unique Attribute X card (strength 4) with instructions on reverse<br/>     Standard double-sided reference card<br/>     26 Action Cards reprinted from 24 different decks, games and expansions.<br/><br/><br/>A Herocard Duel is the main conflict resolution mechanic of any Herocard game.<br/><br/>The players have 3 cards in place as reference, Body, Mind and Attribute X. Each card lists the amount of that attribute that is allowed to be played during a given turn. Each character within the various Herocard games contains a unique combination of attributes.<br/><br/>The attacking player lays a basic attack up to the ammount allowed by the corresponding attribute (most basic attacks use points in Body). The defending player may then play a basic defense card.<br/><br/>The attacking player may continue taking turns adding modifiers to that attack which the defending player may opt to modify his block to defend against.<br/><br/>If the total amount of the attack is greater than the total amount of the block, then the attack goes through. If the block is greater it is not successful.<br/><br/>The attacker's turn is now over and he may not recover any spent points until the beginning of his next turn.<br/><br/>The following turn begins with the next player clearing no more than 3 cards (always chosen from the top of the played stacks) and regaining those attribute points to spend. If the defender played more than 3 cards, he will have to leave one of the cards  uncleared and will not regain the full points in whatever attribute the card was left in.<br/><br/>In a Herocard game such as Orcwars or Rise of the Shogun, a player may move his pieces on the board which dictate who is eligible to be attacked. The purpose of the demo deck however is to familiarize the player with the deck dueling mechanics and has no board game associated with it. Player two is free to attack the other player or save points to counter the next attack. Either way, the duel is over at the first strike.<br/><br/>Action cards from the demo deck can be used in conjunction with any other action cards to create customized decks to expand any of the HeroCard titles. Each of the four characters from Tablestar's current Herocard games comes with a unique set of action cards thematically oriented to that game. The demo deck makes customized characters easy without disrupting currently existing decks.<br/><br/>"}, "93004": {"rpgdesigner": ["Nathanael Phillip Cole", "Michael Cole", "Brendan Evans", "Schmidt Jensen", "Lev Lafayette", "Wu Mingshi", "Andrew Moshos", "Greg Saunders", "Steven Saunders", "B.

His face and torso were marred by gaping wounds, but the young man didn&rsquo;t seem bothered by his disfigurement.<br/><br/>You guided him to the waiting room, where your so called soul-mates sat on overstuffed chairs. You never could believe this sorry crew was cosmically linked to you. By the time you reached the waiting room, Paulie had grown faintly translucent. His ectoplasm trailed after him like a wake of smoke.<br/><br/>Paulie turned out to be a typical teenager, obsessed with horror movies and gory special effects. It was all he could talk about. The others gathered around him, as curious to meet a newcomer as you were. They bombarded him with questions about sports and world events. Your soul-mates always did have trouble letting go of their earthly obsessions.<br/><br/>A tunnel of light opened beneath Paulie, sucking him into its maw. The last shreds of his ectoplasmic body ripped from him, and you saw the spark of his lifeforce spinning into the vortex, dwindling on its way back to Earth.<br/><br/>What new form of flesh would Paulie find himself plunged into? Would he be a bathing beauty reclining in the sun of some Hawaiian beach? Or would he be a crab scuttling across the sand? Having met him, the latter seemed most likely. You shuddered, knowing your fate was just as repulsive. You needed more Karma to escape this cycle of rebirth, and that meant setting things right on earth.<br/><br/>A boy killed by a character from a movie. Surely an evil, supernatural force was loose in the world. It presented you a definite opportunity to gain some Karma, and thereby avoid Paulie&rsquo;s fate.<br/><br/>The tunnel of light remained open, beckoning. A hint, perhaps, from your reclusive Mentor? To find out, all you had to do was make a ghostly vow and step into the tunnel.<br/><br/>"}, "93019": {"rpgartist": ["(Uncredited)"], "rpgitemversion": ["PDF version"], "poll": [], "name": "On the Trail of Jack the Ripper", "rpgdesigner": ["Joe Williams", "Kathleen Williams"], "rpgproducer": ["Joe Williams", "Kathleen Williams"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic920509.jpg", "usersrated": "0", "average": "0", "statistics": [], "rpg": ["Lost Souls"], "rpgpublisher": ["(Web published)"], "rpgcategory": ["Scenario / Adventure / Module"], "rpggenre": ["Occult"], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic920509_t.jpg", "description": "From Introduction:<br/><br/>The player characters are relaxing in Limbo when their Mentor enters the waiting room.

The first edition was inexpensively printed with spiral binding and a black and white cover.  Good reviews and brisk sales made an update obligatory. The second edition was published in December 1992 by Sage Lore, but after a little while was subsequently sold by Marquee Press. In March 1994 Marquee Press published Cemetery Plots, the first and only supplement for Lost Souls.<br/><br/>After Marquee Press closed its doors, I revised the rules by incorporating Cemetery Plots into the main rulebook, eliminating inconsistencies between the two, and cleaning up some of the typos. I made this edition available online briefly in 1999. The rules presented here were updated again in 2007 and include many new enhancements and clarifications, especially involving character creation and setting up a campaign.<br/><br/>The rules for playing a mortal medium, last seen in the 1992 edition, have now been split into their own supplement called The Mortal Coil.<br/><br/>"}, "93031": {"average": "8.34548", "videogamebg": ["Dark Souls: The Board Game"], "name": "Dark Souls", "videogamemode": ["Cooperative", "Network Multiplayer", "Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["English/European PlayStation 3 edition", "English/European PlayStation 3 Limited Edition", "English/European Xbox 360 edition", "European Windows edition", "North American PlayStation 3 (Limited Edition) edition", "North American PlayStation 3 edition", "North American Xbox 360 (Limited Edition) edition", "North American Xbox 360 edition", "Windows Downloadable edition"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2221151.jpg", "videogameseries": ["Dark Souls"], "videogametheme": ["Fantasy"], "videogamefranchise": ["Greatest Hits (Best Selling PlayStation Games, US)", "Souls"], "videogamecharacter": ["Artorias The Abysswalker", "Black Dragon Kalameet", "Black Iron Tarkus", "Crossbreed Priscilla", "Dark Sun Gwyndolin", "Gaping Dragon", "Gargoyle", "Gravelord Nito", "Great Grey Wolf Sif", "Gwyn, Lord of Cinder", "Gwynevere, Princess of Sunlight", "Hydra", "Lautrec the Embraced", "Oscar the Fateless", "Seath the Scaleless", "Shiva of the East", "Solaire of Astora"], "usersrated": "210", "videogamedeveloper": ["From Software"], "videogamegenre": ["Action RPG"], "videogameplatform": ["PlayStation 3", "Windows", "Xbox 360"], "videogamehonor": ["2011 Game Critics Best Role Playing Game of the Year Nominee", "2011 Spike Best RPG of the Year Nominee", "2012 British Academy Game Awards Best Multiplayer Game of the Year Nominee", "2012 British Academy Game Awards Best Strategy Game of the Year Nominee", "2012 D.I.C.E.

In the evenings, I had a roll of gift paper and ran as my foil, fighting Cahusac cardinal's guard, to an invisible audience. Then, as larger did my friends act out the parts of the knights of the court. Like the other children had no idea what it was a gentleman of the court, I started to change my settings and we are then flown spies, detectives, thieves, murderers, astronauts, knights and a thousand other things. Do any of you does this sound familiar? Later, at sixteen, I came across the body of myths and fantasies with the greatest power of identification with the characters I've known: the anime. As a child he had played at being Elisa and tortured the poor Candy (all the girls wanted to be Candy and any disputed me to Elisa, the tacit agreement that Elisa was always lost in the end, but what I enjoyed doing suffer in the meantime Candy ) to be Remi and circus act with a cheerful heart and the rest of the troupe, and Gigi Sandy Bell, Mazinger Z. .. Does that sound more familiar? How about playing Saint Seiya, Dragon Ball, Ranma 1 / 2, Sailor Moon, Marmalade Boy?<br/><br/>&quot;I want to be Vegeta&quot; &quot;Ah, no! Vegeta will be me! &quot;&quot; No! BUAA! &quot;<br/><br/>Too childish? Ever have wondered if there is any game more structured than &quot;I want to be ...&quot;, a game with rules defined to allow us to create the kind of sophisticated stories that do not represent us and yes shame, however, fill us with joy creative?<br/><br/>Have you heard of, you, the role play?<br/><br/>At sixteen, also met RPGs. There were magicians and killing dragons. I later discovered that this scenario was one of many and that we could remove it and replace it and still had a role playing game. But what was not were manual with simple rules, the kind you learn in about two days. No, RPGs, born of the strategy games are hundreds of pages of manuals aimed at devoted fans and experts. I know by heart two or three systems and could play some more if you re-read the manuals, but after years of playing role.<br/><br/>What about the thousands of stories anime fans who attend conventions dressed as their favorite characters and imagine their own stories in the safety of your room? Can there be a role play for them?<br/><br/>Sure, RPGs are based on a single history of anime, and Bubblegum Crisis, but ... and if he wanted to play Sailor Moon? Okay, there's the RPG Sailor Moon. But what if you wanted to add a little Magic Knight Rayearth (Rayearth), Fatal Fury and a dash of Metal Fighter Miku? And if you've never played role and want a simple rule system that helps me to imagine a systematic support, but that system does not become an end in itself? So what if they get tired of anime and I just want to play to make their own history? Huh?

He was a toymaker by trade, and although he was a well liked and friendly man he never did get married nor have any children. Which is a shame because Geppeto was a man who loved children.<br/><br/>Despite the fact that he was one of the greatest toymakers within a hundred miles he was always poor, this is because he often gave away he toys for free to homeless children. When he did make people pay it was only enough to got more materials and food. Time passed and as those children grew up Geppeto grew older, eventually he grew too old to work. That was alright because the grateful people who he gave toys to when they were little gave him everything he needed, so that he could live out his old age in a manner that was much more comfortable than most of the rest of his life. His wits started to slip like old people's wits tend to do, and one day he went through the town proclaiming that one of his toys had come to life, he named him Pinocchio.<br/><br/>The towns people smiled at the old man and let him live on in his delusion. He had been alone for so long, it seemed nice that he was finally happy.<br/><br/>Weeks passed and more of his creations came alive, and children started to vanish. It was just the homeless kids at first but then others who were late for dinner...never came at all. A couple of the new comers to the city instantly blamed Geppeto, but most of the town still remembered his kindness towards them when they were children and the newcomers were ignored.<br/><br/>Time kept passing and children kept disappearing, again the newcomers spoke and this time people started to listen. A mob formed, they stormed to Geppeto's house both praying he was innocent but afraid of what they would find. What they did find was a scene of horror beyond compare.<br/><br/>They found the missing children.<br/><br/>Some of them had screws put into all their joints with rope attached so they were like a horrible puppet. Some of the children had their skin flayed off then painted over, some now had marbles for eyes, and almost none of them had tongues.<br/><br/>Geppeto couldn't handle the crying.<br/><br/>As for Geppeto there was no trace of him anywhere. The children that could be saved were, and the rest were given mercy. As for Geppeto he was no where to be found.<br/><br/>Over the next few years children from that particular town and many others would mysteriously vanish never to be seen again.

Examples of action cards are &quot;Work out new corner kick - score 2 more goals&quot; and &quot;Recent Cup commitments in Europe weaken team - lose 1 goal in this match&quot;.  The result of the match is thus determined with players scoring two points for a win, one for a draw and nothing for a loss.<br/><br/>A player's team's progress is tracked by use of two tokens - a small pawn on a score track to show the current points total and a footballer figure on a calendar track to mark the number of fixtures played.  At the end of the season, the player whose team has accumulated the most points wins the league championship, and of course the trophy!<br/><br/>"}, "93055": {"rpgartist": ["Khairul Hisham", "Dave Martin", "J.

The table even went away entirely in Khaotic and Crimes People Play. For ART 2.0, I wanted to return to the action results. I also wanted a system worthy of the &quot;no calculator required&quot; logo that was on the cover of the first edition of Legendary Lives.<br/><br/>To accomplish this, I've gotten rid of the roll required, column shifts, and couting columns. Instead of the narrator adjusting the roll for the difficulty, the difficulty is front loaded.

It was also released for the Neo-Geo and Neo Geo CD systems, as well as SNK Arcade Classics Vol. 1 for the PS2 and PSP. Extremely difficult, its gameplay was heavily inspired by R-Type and its system of pod attached to the player's ship. Its first level remained memorable for its homage to the futuristic Neo-Tokyo depicted in the anime Akira.<br/><br/>Taking place many years in the future, mankind has developed the technology for space colonization. However, a mysterious computer virus infects the primary computer running man's first space station, causing it not only to affect its automated defenses, but to convince other humans to side with it. The computer attacks Earth so often that Earth's only hope is put into advanced spaceships wielding great firepower.<br/><br/>The game uses only two buttons. The player maneuvers the cyber jet with the joystick. If the player has the drone it will rotate in the same direction of the cyber jet. Press the A button to fire bullets. If you have the drone it will fire in the direction it is pointing. Provided you have the drone, hold the A button to power up the gauge and let go to launch the drone in the direction it is pointing. The higher the power in the gauge the bigger the damage the drone can cause. Press the B button to toggle the stoptrack position of the drone, so it will stay on that point by the cyber jet, but the cannon on the drone can still rotate.<br/><br/>To obtain the drone, collect a power up. If the power up is blue, the attacks are electrical-based. If the power up is red, the attacks are fire-based. Different power ups grant different weapons to add to the cyber jet's attacks. The Laser is effective for shooting through enemies, the Missiles are suitable for spreadfire attacks and the Horizontal bombs are good for attacks either side. The weapons can be powered up to three levels on the cyber jet. Speed power ups can also be added to increase the cyber jet's speed. The cyber jet is destroyed by crashing into enemy ships or hazards or by being shot. The drone can block most bullets, but not lasers or large shots.<br/><br/>The game has five stages. In each stage, the player has battle through swarms of enemy war machines and planes. In some stages mid-bosses can be battled. If the player makes it far enough and the cyber jet is destroyed, the game can resume to a checkpoint, but cyber jet will lose all its power ups. When the player gets to the end of the stage, the player will have to battle a robotic boss, aiming fire on its weak point to destroy it.<br/><br/>"}, "93148": {"rpgdesigner": ["Steve Barber", "Simon Billeness", "Paul Blackwell", "Dave Davies", "Brian Dolton", "David Flin", "Steve Hawes", "Andy Ravenscroft", "Kevin Reader", "David Row"], "statistics": [], "name": "Demonsblood (Issue 7 - Mar 1980)", "rpgartist": ["Paul Blackwell", "Dave Davies", "Brian Dolton", "Quentin Manley", "Simon Washbourne"], "rpgproducer": ["Brian Dolton"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic925763.jpg", "usersrated": "0", "average": "0", "rpgissue": ["Demonsblood"], "rpg": ["Advanced Dungeons & Dragons (1st Edition)", "RuneQuest (1st & 2nd Editions)", "Superhero 2044", "Traveller (Classic)"], "rpgpublisher": ["(Self-Published)"], "rpgissueversion": ["First Printing"], "poll": [], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic925763_t.jpg", "description": "User Summary:<br/><br/>Cover Art by Simon Washbourne.<br/><br/>Demonsblood was published as a combination of contributor &quot;minizines&quot; and regular articles.

It was first released in Japan on September 21, 1994, in North America on February 1, 1995, and in Europe on August 24, 1996. It is one of four Kirby video games released for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System. It was re-released to the Wii's Virtual Console in Japan, Europe and North America in 2007.<br/><br/>Gameplay<br/><br/>Dream Course is a golf video game which is viewed from an isometric perspective. Instead of a ball, the player tries to hit Kirby around the course and into the hole at the end. Players must set the power, angle, and spin to connect with various enemies found throughout the levels. Once only one enemy remains, that enemy will transform into the hole. The different abilities that Kirby can obtain from many of the enemies make up a large part of the game, often being required for completion of a hole. These abilities include Kirby turning into a tornado (that can be steered), a sparkly ball (that can destroy certain obstacles), and a UFO (which allows Kirby to float and move at will for a short time). Other abilities include Kirby being able to slow down / float with a parasol, as well as stop completely as a stone.<br/><br/>The game has eight single player courses, with eight holes on each. There is a high score board for each level, with medals to be won on each of them. The player can unlock extra features (such as alternative versions of the courses) by winning the medals. There are Bronze, Silver, and Gold medals to be won, which are awarded to Kirby at the end of the course. There are also four two-player courses (again with eight holes).<br/>Kirby loses one of his health points (shown as tomatoes) every time he makes a shot, and gains one every time he hits an enemy or lands in a hole. In the two-player mode, two health points are awarded for landing in the hole first, and two health points can also be lost if one player's Kirby is &quot;attacked&quot; by the other player's by using an ability (such as the tornado or the stone). In the single-player mode, Kirby loses one life when all his health points are gone or fall off the stage ; when Kirby runs out of lives, the game will end. Afterwards, the player can either continue from the beginning of the course or exit it. In the two-player mode, the loss of all health points causes that player to miss a turn, as their Kirby falls asleep.<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;Kirby's dream course&quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "93158": {"rpgdesigner": ["Chris Kentlea"], "rpg": ["Generic / Universal"], "poll": [], "name": "Dungeon Tiles: Rooms & Corridors Set #2", "rpgartist": ["Chris Kentlea"], "rpgproducer": ["Chris Kentlea"], "average": "0", "usersrated": "0", "rpgitemversion": ["PDF Version"], "statistics": [], "rpggenre": ["Fantasy"], "rpgpublisher": ["Ennead Games"], "rpgcategory": ["Accessory (dice, maps, screens, cards)"], "rpgseries": ["Dungeon Tiles (by Unnead Games)"], "description": "User Summary<br/><br/>The second dungeon tiles set includes several room &amp; corridor tiles along with an underground river collection.<br/><br/>"}, "93159": {"poll": [], "name": "Reggie Jackson Baseball", "videogamemode": ["Local Multiplayer", "Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["Europe Sega Master System edition", "South America Sega Master System edition", "US Sega Master System edition"], "average": "0", "videogametheme": ["Sports - Baseball"], "usersrated": "0", "videogamedeveloper": ["SEGA Corporation"], "videogamegenre": ["Sports"], "videogameplatform": ["SEGA Master System"], "statistics": [], "videogamepublisher": ["SEGA Corporation", "Tectoy"], "description": "User Summary<br/><br/>A Major League Baseball game for the Sega Master System.

To play this game you need to get hold of a few friends, a couple of six-sided dice and an attitude. Finally you need to get a survival instinct. You won't be playing for long without one. Then again, ZAIBATSU is less of a game and more of a training manual for the urban nightmare that is near-future Tokyo.<br/><br/>Take Gibson's &quot;Neuromancer&quot; and related short stories; the visual kick of &quot;Bladerunner&quot;, &quot;Black Rain&quot; and &quot;Akira&quot;; take the format and tangled firefights of Bullfrog's &quot;Syndicate&quot; game and splintered shards of Medieval Japan. The result is ZAIBATSU; roleplaying Japanese cyberpunk. Mean and moody manga. ZAIBATSU isn't watered down cyberpunk, near future elements from the best sources are here: replicants, lasers and cyborgs. All set in Gibson's futureworld: Tokyo gone global. Tokyo. The world's capital, largest, most high-tech, most happening city on Earth. Japanese culture is prevalent in many nations, just as American was in the 20th century. And the players are at the heart of this vast superpower. This is unique to ZAIBATSU, as is the world's retrogenics technology. Forget cybernetics in the traditional roleplaying game sense; with tech out of date as soon as it leaves the production line, no sucker is going to trade meat for metal if his new arm, say, will be redundant in two months. Now, updating the meat, that's something else... By the time we build a &quot;stronger, faster&quot; cybernetic arm or leg to replace the real limb, we will undoubtedly be able to regenerate a limb with clone technology. It's not too far away. The next step is to augment the DNA to grow a stronger limb, and after that use DNA viruses to alter existing limbs. Etc, etc.<br/><br/>Most of the rules in ZAIBATSU have been left to a minimum. Some may find this disturbing or annoying, but previous experience with other games has shown a distinct lack of atmosphere in supposedly fast combats. Keep combat fluid and verbal, fast and confusing. These are fast, and should be played that way. When you encounter something not in the rules - make it up! After all, that's just what I did in designing the game. The character design rules in particular are brief and to the point. Again this is for speed of play. It is not difficult for the player (or indeed the referee) to memorize the characters' skills since each has only six, with only one value (you've either got it or you haven't).<br/><br/>"}, "93163": {"statistics": [], "name": "Winfall", "playingtime": "60", "minplayers": "1", "yearpublished": "2009", "usersrated": "1", "maxplayers": "6", "average": "6", "boardgamepublisher": ["(Self-Published)"], "boardgameversion": ["First Edition"], "maxplaytime": "60", "poll": [], "age": "8", "minplaytime": "60", "description": "WINFALL is for anyone who has ever dreamed about what they would do if they won the lottery.

Unlike most medieval/fantasy beat 'em ups it featured an isometric viewing angle, some platforming (usually involving players stacking rocks or crates to climb on and jump to treasure chests), unusually large stylised sprites, and variable blood/gore settings.<br/><br/>In this game, up to four players can choose four characters in four different occupations: a knight, a brawler, an archer and a wizard. Collecting treasure gave the characters experience points, and levelling up shortened the time it took a character to charge his/her super attack (by holding the attack button).<br/><br/>In addition to treasure, items included food (which restored health) elemental upgrades to weapons (which made them stronger against specific opponents) various single-use thrown weapons (and a five-shot crossbow), shields that would automatically block enemy attacks for a short time, and refills for a player's &quot;magic&quot; (basically a desperation move). Often, instead of items or treasure, a chest/barrel/etc. would contain a trap like &quot;freezing smoke&quot;, poison gas, lightning, or even traps that temporarily transformed the player into small animals who could move but not attack.<br/><br/>The enemies in the game were fairly standard for fantasy arcade games, including orcs, slimes, lizardmen, werewolves, carnivorous plants, harpies, and others. Bosses included demons, giant snakes, spider-women, and more.

Soon Makhpella, the mothership of all Klissans and Klissan fleet invaded all outer Gaal colonies. Gaal colony fleet was completely helpless and in order to save original Gaal territories and Gaal motherland itself from invasion they decided not to jump back and make Makhpella trace the route there but to blow up the remaining other colonies using the hyperjumper.<br/><br/>Not very long ago everything was started by Peleng captain called Rachekhan who was one of commanders of Peleng fleet. He was thrown out of the fleet and became a pirate. Since he had an access to secret documents and weaponry he stole a hyperjumper. While travelling with it he met Makhpella. It considered Rachekhan's pirate fleet as an enemy and started chasing it. During the chase Rachekhan and Klissan fleets went through interstellar coalition sectors so Makhpella spotted IC sectors and now knew its location and identified all IC races as foes.

It was one of the first ultra-violent video games and a frequent target of parental criticism of the arcade game industry. The object is to arrest and kill drug offenders, confiscate their money and drugs, and defeat &quot;Mr. Big&quot;. It was ported, not long after, to the NES and several home computer systems in 1990. In 2005, it was also updated into a brand new game for the Xbox and PS2.<br/><br/>Released in 1988, it was the first game in the newly restarted Williams Electronics coin op division, and features their notable use of digitized graphics (later made famous in games such as Mortal Kombat). In fact, the quality of the graphics in terms of number of colors would not be surpassed until the game Mortal Kombat II (released in 1993). The game features what in arcade terminology is termed a medium resolution monitor - higher resolution than televisions and normal arcade monitors, although often in a smaller physical size. NARC was also the very first arcade game to utilize the TI TMS34010, which is a 32-bit processor. The game was also notable for the numerous voice samples used during and between levels.<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;NARC (video game)&quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "93231": {"poll": [], "name": "NARC (2005)", "videogamemode": ["Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["US PlayStation 2 edition", "US Xbox edition"], "average": "0", "videogameseries": ["NARC"], "videogametheme": ["Crime"], "usersrated": "0", "videogamedeveloper": ["Point of View"], "videogamegenre": ["Run-and-gun", "Shooter"], "videogameplatform": ["PlayStation 2", "Xbox"], "statistics": [], "videogamepublisher": ["Midway Games Inc."], "description": "The 2005 home console update of the 1988 arcade hit of the same title was also developed and published by Midway Games for the Xbox and PS2. A planned Nintendo GameCube version was later canceled. Although the update was slated to be a straight remake of the story from the arcade game, the version that was eventually released featured a totally new story. Several well-known stars are involved with the voice acting in NARC, including Michael Madsen, Bill Bellamy, and Ron Perlman. The game's soundtrack features artists such as Curtis Mayfield, Cypress Hill, Grandmaster Flash, Lynyrd Skynyrd, and indie artists such as Point Game and Camden. The update casts the player as narcotics officer Jack Forzenski and DEA agent Marcus Hill, former partners reunited who are instructed to investigate a new drug on the streets called Liquid Soul.<br/><br/>One of the most controversial aspects of the game is that after arresting dealers and confiscating their stock, the player can either take the confiscated items to the evidence room, or keep them for future use.

The player pilots a small spaceship instead of a simple dot and the enemies come in the form of various aliens.<br/><br/>The overall gameplay is identical to that of Qix. However, the main enemy is no longer a collection of lines - instead it varies between levels, and is always accompanied by smaller enemies. When the player's spaceship succeeds in claiming a section of the level, the side where the main enemy is taken as &quot;the outside&quot;. Any smaller enemies ending up on &quot;the inside&quot; are killed, resulting in point bonuses. In order to complete a level, the player must claim at least 80% of a level's area. Previously, the limits were 75% in Qix and 70% in Super Qix. Each level in Volfied has a unique background and enemies. As the player claims areas of the level the cleared area graphic is replaced with the graphic of the next level. Grey boxes also appear on the field - these give the player a random power-up when collected. Power ups can grant the player speed or even weapons.

We know how players like to have their own clubhouse.<br/><br/>There are skill challenges included. If you are a GM who loathes skill checks, ignore them. Black them out if they offend. The skill rolls are denoted by difficulty level (DL) with a target number.<br/><br/>Lastly, the obligatory statement, the GM should alter any part of the adventure to suit his needs.

Its name is directly derived from the dice mechanic it uses to resolve actions. Multi10 uses d10-based dice pools, rolling a number of dice equal to your attribute and multiplying the highest-scoring die by your skill rating to generate an action score. Most similar systems simply add the attribute and the skill rating together to calculate the size of the dice pool, but the multiplication twist makes skills quite important and prevents players from simply focusing on attributes to get large dice pools. A system of specialties that allows for high character customization further builds on this simple premise. Combat is fast, mostly realistic and deadly. The ability to perform quick or slow-but-precise attacks and spread actions over multiple phases adds a tactical element to battles without resorting to long and cumbersome lists of special actions and manoeuvres.<br/><br/>"}, "93388": {"rpgdesigner": ["George Chatzipetros"], "rpg": ["Multi10"], "statistics": [], "name": "Multi10 Character Record Sheet", "rpgartist": ["George Chatzipetros"], "rpgproducer": ["George Chatzipetros"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic934850.jpg", "usersrated": "1", "rpgitemversion": ["PDF Version"], "average": "7.5", "rpggenre": ["Action / Adventure"], "rpgpublisher": ["(Self-Published)"], "rpgcategory": ["Accessory (dice, maps, screens, cards)"], "poll": [], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic934850_t.jpg", "description": "User Summary<br/>This is a blank character sheet made for the Multi10 system.<br/><br/>"}, "93389": {"poll": [], "name": "Linkology: Animals", "playingtime": "15", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": ["Hand Management"], "yearpublished": "0", "usersrated": "3", "boardgamefamily": ["Linkology"], "maxplayers": "6", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic924341_t.jpg", "average": "6.66667", "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["Albi", "Learning Resources"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic924341.jpg", "boardgameversion": ["Czech edition", "English edition"], "maxplaytime": "15", "boardgamecategory": ["Animals", "Card Game", "Children's Game", "Educational", "Word Game"], "age": "8", "minplaytime": "15", "description": "The Linkology game is a fast and fun card game that links science concepts together in a way that reinforces vocabulary and classification skills.

It was a launch title for both the Neo-Geo MVS (arcade) and AES (home) systems, and was one of the pack-in games for the Neo-Geo AES. Like many earlier SNK games, it is well-known for its challenging difficulty.<br/><br/>It was re-released through the Virtual Console download service in Europe and Australia on October 26, 2007, and in North America on October 29, 2007. Most recently it was included in SNK Arcade Classics Vol. 1, released for the Wii, PlayStation 2 and PlayStation Portable in North America on May 1, 2008.<br/><br/>The player controls the wizard Elta, the last magician lord, on his quest to save his homeland from the evil wizard Gal Agiese. The evil wizard is seeking the god of destruction Az Atorse whom he plans to resurrect this using eight tomes of mystical power. As Elta, the player must battle through eight levels to find each of the tomes before he can reach Gal's fortress, and seal away the evil deity once again.<br/><br/>Elta has to jump, shoot and climb his way to the end of each level where he must beat a servant of Gal, along with one of Gal's sinister boss creations, in order to progress through the game. To complete the game Elta must reach the final stage and defeat Az Atorse himself. The gameplay is typical to a standard action-platformer fitted for arcade machines and thus very challenging. If the player takes too long to complete a stage, then they will be harassed by an invincible monster. Aside from the fantasy themes there's an added twist of transformations that make the wizard more powerful and grants him new attacks. When he has not been transformed, Elta's primary form of attack is a weak but fast-moving energy projectile that he can shoot in four directions; left, right, up and (while jumping) down.<br/><br/>These are the forms that Elta can assume by picking up combinations of colored orbs found throughout the stages:<br/><br/>Dragon Warrior: In this form Elta attacks by breathing fire; a continuous short-range attack that can also be aimed diagonally unlike his standard attack.<br/>Waterman: The Waterman-form attacks with water grenades - blue bubbles of water that explode into water pillars upon touching the ground. The attack can hit several times for additional damage but only covers a small area.<br/>Poseidon: A more powerful version of the Waterman, Poseidon shoots wide waves of water that travels along the ground for several hits. It does severe damage and causes enemies to freeze and shatter on impact. While very powerful, this form moves very slowly.<br/>Shinobi: The Shinobi-form gains increased agility and attacks with powerful magical archs of fire which are wide but slow-moving.<br/>Samurai: While limited in range, the Samurai-form is the only form that can attack through barriers, such as walls, shields or even multiple enemies, using a boomerang-like energy attack that does heavy damage.<br/>Raijin: The Raijin-form gives Elta's jumping ability a big boost as well as a unique attack that creates a continuous electrical field around his body.<br/><br/>"}, "93459": {"poll": [], "name": "Mechanized Attack", "videogamemode": ["Cooperative", "Local Multiplayer", "Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["Arcade Edition", "NES Edition"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1557709.png", "videogametheme": ["War - Future"], "usersrated": "1", "videogamedeveloper": ["SNK Corporation"], "videogamegenre": ["Arcade", "Light Gun Shooter"], "videogameplatform": ["Arcade", "NES"], "average": "4", "statistics": [], "videogamepublisher": ["SNK Corporation"], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1557709_t.png", "description": "User Summary<br/><br/>A lightgun shooter where you shoot enemies using uzis and grenades.

It was released in Japan in 1995 and was followed by a sequel, Mega Man 2: The Power Fighters, the following year. Both games were ported to home consoles in North America in 2004 as part of the Mega Man Anniversary Collection for PlayStation 2, Nintendo GameCube and Xbox and in Japan during the same year as part of two game compilation titled Rockman: Power Battle Fighters (\u30ed\u30c3\u30af\u30de\u30f3 \u30d1\u30ef\u30fc\u30d0\u30c8\u30eb\u30d5\u30a1\u30a4\u30bf\u30fc\u30ba?), also for the PlayStation 2.

Two players can play the game together as different characters, teaming up to defeat the bosses.<br/><br/>The game plays much like the main Mega Man games - the player uses one button to jump, and one to fire the character's arm-mounted energy gun. Holding the fire button charges the gun in order to release a stronger blast. Holding down while pressing the jump button makes the character do a dash, the appearance of which varies between characters.<br/><br/>After choosing a character, the player chooses between three &quot;stories&quot;, with each one having different Robot Masters from various games. The &quot;stories&quot; are Mega Man 1-2, 3-6 and Mega Man 7. Upon choosing a &quot;story&quot;, the game quickly pans through the various levels, letting the player choose one roulette-style.<br/><br/>A level is largely different from the mainstream Mega Man games; instead of going through an entire stage and fighting the Robot Master as a boss at the end, the player faces the Robot Master immediately. Killing a Robot Master earns the player their weapon, which can be switched to by pressing a button. Like in most Mega Man games, each Robot Master is weak to another one's weapon, so the player can fight through them in a &quot;rock-paper-scissors&quot; kind of way.<br/><br/>"}, "93462": {"videogame": ["Mega Man Anniversary Collection", "Rockman Power Battle Fighters"], "poll": [], "name": "Mega Man 2: The Power Fighters", "videogamemode": ["Cooperative", "Local Multiplayer", "Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["JP Arcade Edition"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1557712.png", "videogameseries": ["Mega Man"], "videogametheme": ["Science Fiction"], "usersrated": "1", "videogamedeveloper": ["Capcom Co., Ltd."], "videogamegenre": ["Arcade", "Fighting"], "videogameplatform": ["Arcade"], "average": "3", "statistics": [], "videogamepublisher": ["Capcom Co., Ltd."], "videogamecompilation": ["Mega Man Anniversary Collection", "Rockman Power Battle Fighters"], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1557712_t.png", "description": "Mega Man 2: The Power Fighters, known in Japan as Rockman 2: The Power Fighters\u200b (\u30ed\u30c3\u30af\u30de\u30f32\u30fb\u30b6\u30fb\u30d1\u30ef\u30fc\u30d5\u30a1\u30a4\u30bf\u30fc\u30ba), is an arcade video game, released in Japan in 1996 as a fighting game in the Mega Man series of games. It is the direct sequel to Mega Man: The Power Battle released the previous year. Both games were ported to home consoles in North America in 2004 as part of the Mega Man Anniversary Collection for PlayStation 2, Xbox, and GameCube and in Japan during the same year as part of two game compilation titled Rockman: Power Battle Fighters (\u30ed\u30c3\u30af\u30de\u30f3 \u30d1\u30ef\u30fc\u30d0\u30c8\u30eb\u30d5\u30a1\u30a4\u30bf\u30fc\u30ba), also for the PlayStation 2.

However, in The Power Fighters, the epilogues are more detailed and have more to do with past and future Mega Man games, providing vague explanations regarding characters and canon, most notably the Evil Energy incident from Mega Man 8 and how Dr. Wily created Zero from the Mega Man X series.<br/><br/>The gameplay is roughly the same as in Mega Man: The Power Battle, as it keeps the controls, stages and weapon-copying. There are however several new additions. The playable characters are Mega Man, Proto Man, Bass and Duo, with Duo being a new addition to the cast. The four characters feature different attributes and abilities. When playing 2-Player, only one of the players can get the Robot Master's weapon.<br/><br/>As in The Power Battle there are three &quot;stories&quot; to choose from after; finding Dr. Wily, saving Roll, and recovering the stolen parts. All stories have different Robot Masters to fight, and halfway through it the player is given a different power-up. Unlike the previous game, The Power Fighters lets the player choose freely between Robot Master stages, and is given some hints on what the Robot Masters weaknesses are. Each of the characters can perform a special attack, which is executed by releasing a full buster charge while holding the joystick up. Megaman's special move, the &quot;Mega Upper,&quot; is simply a jumping uppercut (like the Shoryuken); Protoman's special move, the &quot;Proto Strike,&quot; allows him to shoot a massive, short-ranged burst of energy; Bass' special move, the &quot;Crescent Kick,&quot; (Which is like the Flash Kick, Another Street Fighter ability), lets him perform a somersaulting kick; Duo's special move, the &quot;Giant Knuckle,&quot; is a standing uppercut that flings the enemy upwards (if the attack button is pressed again after the uppercut, Duo will jump up and slam the enemy down to the ground).<br/><br/>As the player damages the Robot Masters, various energy pellets pop out from them. Some of these are just for points, but others will restore health, weapon energy, or both. When the robot master is defeated, a multitude of these pellets are released, as well as a capsule containing the boss's special weapon. During a two-player game, only the player who picks up the capsule will get the special weapon (similar to those seen in Mega Man 8). One of the items that can appear during battle will summon a robot helper. Mega Man summons Rush, who will do a dash attack towards the enemy when Mega Man fires a charged shot, and can be bounced from using the Rush Coil. Bass summons Treble, who will fire plasma shots each time Bass fires his buster, and perform a dash attack similar to Rush's when Bass fires a charged shot. Protoman and Duo both summon Beat, who will give them an energy shield that makes them completely invincible for a short time. These summoning abilities will last until their energy runs out, and they cannot be cancelled. While a helper or their effect is active, special weapons cannot be used. Lastly, each Robot Master now has an Overdrive mode; after a Robot Master loses half or more of their health, the screen will go dark, they will flash, and their attack patterns will change. Some Robot Masters will gain new moves, some will gain new weapons, and others will simply become much harder to hit.<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;Mega Man 2: The Power Fighters&quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "93463": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic924772.jpg", "poll": [], "boardgamedesigner": ["Alex Weldon"], "statistics": [], "yearpublished": "2010", "maxplayers": "4", "boardgameartist": ["Alex Weldon"], "boardgamepublisher": ["MJ Games"], "maxplaytime": "30", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic924772_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "30", "boardgamecategory": ["Animals", "Dice"], "description": "In Picnic Blitz, you want to bring ants to the picnic and eat enough food to claim your place on top of the anthill.<br/><br/>The game is played on a small game board, with each player taking six colored ant tokens and four Queen tokens being placed to the side.

Once you have moved the Flag onto your opponent&rsquo;s goal line, you&rsquo;re the winner.<br/><br/>"}, "93494": {"boardgamedesigner": ["(Uncredited)"], "poll": [], "name": "Knuff", "playingtime": "0", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": ["Roll / Spin and Move"], "yearpublished": "0", "usersrated": "1", "maxplayers": "2", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1012733_t.jpg", "average": "1", "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["Alga"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1012733.jpg", "boardgameversion": ["Alga edition"], "maxplaytime": "0", "boardgamecategory": ["Abstract Strategy"], "age": "7", "minplaytime": "0", "description": "This is supposedly a traditional Swedish game, although no information is given about its age or origin.<br/><br/>The two players begin with six pawns each arranged around a grid of squares.
