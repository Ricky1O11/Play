The ideal number of players is four, but it can be adapted for three or five by removing one or two of the number 2 cards for a total of 51=3*17 or 50=5*10 cards.<br/><br/>The game is a fixed collection of several short games and the winner is the player with the lowest total score. There are slight variants of the exact composition of included games and the scoring, however all but one are always trick-taking games while the last one is a variant of the game Fan Tan. All games start by dealing the entire deck so that each player receives the same number of cards. Common for all the trick-taking games is the requirement to follow suit if possible. The player of the highest card (ace being the highest) in that suit takes the trick and starts the next one. If a player lacks cards in the suit on the table he plays any one card of his own choice.<br/><br/>Most Jazz variants consist of a selection of four to six of the following trick-taking games plus the final game of Fan Tan. The provided suggested penalty points provide for a balanced four-person game.<br/><br/>1. &quot;Spades&quot; or &quot;Clubs&quot; <br/>A trick-taking game where the aim is to avoid taking cards of the specified suit.

(2p each)<br/><br/>4a. &quot;Jacks&quot;<br/>4b. &quot;Queens&quot; <br/>Depending on the variant, one should avoid taking either jacks or queens. (5p each) Some variants play both the Jacks and the Queens games one after the other, others play only one of them.<br/><br/>5. &quot;King of Hearts and the Final Trick&quot;<br/>Avoid taking the very last trick as well as the king of hearts card. Some variants also give penalty points for the fifth trick. (10p each, sometimes with an extra penalty for taking the king of hearts as part of the final trick.)<br/><br/>6. &quot;Solitaire&quot;, &quot;Seven&quot;, &quot;Fan Tan&quot;<br/>The final game is Fan Tan or a version thereof. One common rule specifies that the player having the 7 of diamonds always goes first by playing this card while another variant is started by normal clock-wise order and with any number seven card. The starting player is often allowed/required to play an additional card if possible. In each suit the 7 is played first followed by the 8 on one side and as the third card the 6 on the other side of the 7. As soon as these three cards have been played the ascending (9-K) and descending (5-A) runs of the suit are played independently of one another on top of the 8 and 6 cards. A player has to play one and only one card on his turn if possible. The game ends when a player runs out of cards.

The game is about an old tradition in this city: On christmas eve big fires are lit on two hilltops in the city. Torchbearers light their torch on one of the fires and spread out in the darkness to make a torch chain across the city.<br/><br/>The game contains a gameboard, playing cards (people: the torch expert and torch novices, several kinds of wood needed for the torch fire = a tree and a wood base, then the wood that is to be stacked), action cards for the players to select their appropriate actions, 5 playing pieces, a torch point marker, one d6 die for dice duels and one die for the actions (one action, two actions, rainy day, unhappy face = sick torchbearers). Then there is the fire itself considering of a stack, a base and 14 wood pieces (actually from plastic).<br/><br/>Gameplay: Each player gets a pawn, action cards, and 3 people cards and 3 wood cards. The game has two phases: first the fire is prepared: Torch bearers have to be found, the wood has to be gathered. Then the wood is stacked. When 14 stacks have been reached (the point marker or one of the player pawns reaches past 14 wood on the game board) the fire is ready to be lit. There is a final dice throw, and then the winner is the one having advanced the furthest up the game board, meaning the one who stacked the most wood.<br/><br/>For the first phase a fire master is chosen - the first one rolling a 6 with the d6-die. Then each player chooses an action - gathering wood or getting torch bearers. The action die thrown by the fire master determines if an action is successful (no rainy day, no sick persons are rolled) and if successful if a single or double action is possible. If more than two players want the same action they roll the d6 to determine who can have a go.<br/><br/>The fire master title changes clockwise to the next player each time a turn is finished.<br/><br/>In the second phase the players - who have to have at least 3 torch bearer cards, one of them being an expert, first plant the tree, then the wood base, then wood stacks. For this they need to have the appropriate type and amount of wood cards. More than two people wanting to do the same roll it out with a d6. The action die determines if an action is successful (no rain), if torch bearer cards must be given up (sick persons) or an action can even be done twice. For a successful action the player pawn is moved one space up on the game board, for a double action two spaces. The point marker moves up one space up too (but only one even when two actions are made). Once the full stack of 14 is reached, either by a player pawn or indicated by the point marker, the game enters its last phase. To maximize their score each player can roll the d6. The player furthest behind has as many die rolls as are players present (e.g. player in 4th place can roll 4 times). If he/she rolls a 6 he/she can move up 4 spaces, player in 3rd place can roll 3 times and move up 3 spaces when rolling a 6 in these 3 rolls). Then the game ends and the player who is up the furthest is the winner.<br/><br/>Apart from the cards the game contains a 3D-woodstack to visualize the fires progress.<br/><br/>"}, "157768": {"rpgartist": ["Samuel Araya", "Chris Bivins", "Mike Chaney", "Vince Locke", "Mauro Mussi", "Borja Puig Linares", "Alida Saxon", "Andrew Trabbold", "Cathy Wilkins"], "rpg": ["Demon: The Descent"], "statistics": [], "name": "Demon: the Descent Condition Cards", "rpgdesigner": ["David Brookshaw", "N.

Bellum se ipsum alet is a tactical game but unlike many others in the genre, the resources are not unlimited. The players must continuously feed their armies by storming and occupying cities but the cities will continuously fight to free themselves and for each new occupant, there will be less to plunder. Add to this a battle system where the players need to balance between wasting soldiers to win the battle and saving them for the next battle. Each player must thus find a way to make best use of the scarce and diminishing resources at hand to be able to deliver the final blow at the right place at the right time.<br/><br/>Game mechanisms include:<br/><br/>1. Tile laying: You gain influence by simply passing through areas and leaving your influence tiles behind you. However, you must defend your influence not only against your opponents but also against the cities, that eventually will revolt and reclaim the influence. <br/>2. Resource economy: Your army is no better than your economy, its strength is linked to supply from cities and if you lose the cities, you will eventually (but not immediately) lose your army and the war. <br/>3. Hidden bidding: The battle system is a kind of \\&quot;hidden bidding\\&quot;, which does not reward the player with the strongest army but rather the player who throws in just about more soldiers into the battle. The more you spend, the more you lose, and like Pyrrhus, you may find that your victories are so expensive that they will cause you to lose. <br/>4. Changing game board: The more the cities are conquered, the more they are devastated and the less they will contribute to your army. Your army must claim the victory before there is nothing left to feed it with.<br/><br/>Bellum se ipsum alet is the second game in the Nova Suecia series.<br/><br/>"}, "157784": {"rpgdesigner": ["(Uncredited)"], "rpgitemversion": ["PDF version"], "poll": [], "name": "Shadowrun Missions: New York City Character Creation and Transfer Guide", "rpgartist": ["Andy Coen", "John Gravato"], "rpgproducer": ["John Dunn"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2000656.jpg", "usersrated": "0", "rpgsetting": ["The Sixth World"], "average": "0", "statistics": [], "rpggenre": ["Fantasy (Modern Urban Fantasy)", "Science Fiction (Cyberpunk)"], "rpgpublisher": ["Catalyst Game Labs"], "rpg": ["Shadowrun (4th & Twentieth Anniversary Editions)"], "rpgcategory": ["Sourcebook (rules/options to enhance play)"], "rpgseries": ["Denver Story Arc", "New York Story Arc", "Shadowrun Missions"], "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2000656_t.jpg", "description": "User summary:<br/>Booklet detailing how to create characters for Shadowrun Missions series 3 (New York), how to transfer characters Shadowrun Missions seris 2 (Denver), Character Creation FAQ and a Character Tranfer form.<br/><br/>"}, "157785": {"boardgamedesigner": ["(Uncredited)"], "average": "5.5", "poll": [], "name": "Tsoro Yematatu", "playingtime": "5", "minplayers": "2", "yearpublished": "0", "usersrated": "1", "maxplayers": "2", "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2516669_t.jpg", "boardgameartist": ["(Uncredited)"], "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["Mitra"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2516669.jpg", "boardgameversion": ["Mitra MDF edition"], "maxplaytime": "5", "boardgamecategory": ["Abstract Strategy", "Ancient", "Educational"], "age": "6", "minplaytime": "5", "description": "Tsoro Yematatu is a two-player abstract strategy game from Zimbabwe.

The player who placed the final disease earns a special action. The player with the most diseases scores the population number.

Colonies and wonders provide resources and victory points. Advisors provide rerolls. New tiles provide benefits immediately, so you can roll new dice at once.<br/><br/>At the end of each round, War and Famine drawn at the start of the round is checked for each player, giving you victory points if you match or beat the values. Books are accumulated and scored. Player order is checked, with high military strength going first in the next round. At the end of the game, whoever has the most victory points wins.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "1", "boardgameversion": ["English first edition", "German first edition", "Multilingual first edition"], "average": "6.94419", "name": "Nations: The Dice Game", "playingtime": "40", "boardgamemechanic": ["Dice Rolling"], "age": "14", "boardgameexpansion": ["Nations: The Dice Game \u2013 Unrest"], "usersrated": "2675", "boardgamesubdomain": ["Family Games", "Strategy Games"], "boardgamefamily": ["Nations", "Solitaire Games"], "boardgamepodcastepisode": ["1P 058 - Nations", "1P 085 - Nations The Dice Game", "21 Game Salute - Episode 17", "clp033 \u2013 cubelove podcast \u2013 Nations Dynasties", "Ep 016 \u2013 BGG Con 2015 Recap Extravaganza!!", "Ep. 7 Game Stores", "Episode 11: Isaac Childres interview - Gloomhaven, Nations the Dice Game, Castles of Burgundy", "Episode 33 - Belfort", "Essen 2014 - Nations: The Dice Game", "I've Been Diced! episode 71: Mutants, game studies, and 2015 in review", "MOBG 35, What happens at Runemeet doesn't really need to stay at Runemeet 2015", "Planeta de Juegos 17 - Especial Stefan Feld", "Planeta de Juegos 29 - Lo que nos espera en Essen 2014", "Podcast #092 - Todo muy bonito", "The Game Pit: Episode 31 - Essen 2014 Treasure Hunt Special (part 1)", "The Game Pit: Episode 65 - Short Games with Mark Johnson", "Top 10 Favorite Board Games of All Time"]}, "157810": {"rpgartist": ["(Uncredited)"], "rpgitemversion": ["German pdf"], "poll": [], "name": "Operation Roter Scimitar", "rpgdesigner": ["Daniel Schuler"], "rpgproducer": ["(Uncredited)"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1987963.jpg", "usersrated": "0", "average": "0", "statistics": [], "rpg": ["NOVA (German Sci-Fi RPG)"], "rpgpublisher": ["Prometheus Games"], "rpgcategory": ["Scenario / Adventure / Module"], "rpggenre": ["Science Fiction"], "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1987963_t.jpg", "description": "<br/>User description<br/><br/>This is an addtional scenario to follow the events of Testflug: Operation Roter Blitz.<br/><br/>"}, "157811": {"rpgartist": ["(Uncredited)"], "rpgitemversion": ["German pdf"], "poll": [], "name": "Operation Rote Allianz", "rpgdesigner": ["Daniel Schuler"], "rpgproducer": ["(Uncredited)"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1987964.jpg", "usersrated": "0", "average": "0", "statistics": [], "rpg": ["NOVA (German Sci-Fi RPG)"], "rpgpublisher": ["Prometheus Games"], "rpgcategory": ["Scenario / Adventure / Module"], "rpggenre": ["Science Fiction"], "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1987964_t.jpg", "description": "<br/>User description<br/><br/>This is an addtional scenario to follow the events of Testflug: Operation Roter Blitz.<br/><br/>"}, "157812": {"rpgartist": ["(Uncredited)"], "rpgitemversion": ["German pdf"], "poll": [], "name": "Operation Roter Sichelmond", "rpgdesigner": ["Daniel Schuler"], "rpgproducer": ["(Uncredited)"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1987965.jpg", "usersrated": "0", "average": "0", "statistics": [], "rpg": ["NOVA (German Sci-Fi RPG)"], "rpgpublisher": ["Prometheus Games"], "rpgcategory": ["Scenario / Adventure / Module"], "rpggenre": ["Science Fiction"], "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1987965_t.jpg", "description": "<br/>User description<br/><br/>This is an addtional scenario to follow the events of Testflug: Operation Roter Blitz.<br/><br/>"}, "157813": {"image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1987598.jpg", "poll": [], "boardgamedesigner": ["Thomas Wong"], "statistics": [], "yearpublished": "2013", "maxplayers": "6", "boardgameartist": ["Sepfry Ng"], "boardgamepublisher": ["People on Board"], "maxplaytime": "30", "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1987598_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "30", "boardgamecategory": ["Card Game"], "description": "Lantau Fun is based on the tourist attractions of Lantau Island in Hong Kong and gives players a sense of its geography and tourist attractions.<br/><br/>In the game, players are tourists who travel around the island and use the action and function cards in hand to collect &quot;Lantau Fun&quot; cards.

An end goal of $25 is the normal amount for a 4 player, 30 minute game.<br/><br/>You save money as a thrifty shopper by rolling the six (6) dice provided. Each side of each die has either a monetary amount ($1, $2, $3, $5 &amp; $10) or a special character ($, a circular arrow, X or Gift Card) on it. Earning money is as simple as rolling the dice and matching like amounts. After any roll, you must add at least one die to the scoring pool (these are the dice you are attempting to match like amounts with). You may stop rolling to score the amount of money shown on the dice once you have at least four (4) like amounts in your scoring pool. You may continue to roll the remaining dice, if you choose. You may also attempt to roll for the straight. A straight is one of each of the five different dollar amounts on the dice. If a player manages to roll a straight without using any &ldquo;Wild&rdquo; faces, that player may then choose to score $7.00.

While playing Drinking Viking you will learn that the art is not to win but to manage not to lose!<br/><br/>What&rsquo;s in the box?<br/><br/>Drinking Viking party game contains 19 types of cards with unique illustrations shuffled in set of 42 cards, rulebook, 3 wooden dice and original cotton pouch.  To play, all you need are your friends, a viking heart and gaming spirit. It is that simple. The game can be played virtually anywhere. No board, no figures, no long setup. YOU are the figures and YOU are the board!<br/><br/>Game mechanics<br/><br/>Every card represents one mini game with unique rules. Players draw cards one by one to know what kind of game they are going to play and what challenge lies ahead. Some minigames are based on words, memory or creativity, others on luck, courage and quick reactions<br/>You will play minigames like  Egg,-chicken-dragon-Viking, Loki, 2-5-7, Mad king, Thor&rsquo;s hammer, Odin, Hunt , Drinking Viking and many more.<br/><br/>Game goal<br/><br/>Goal of this game is the game itself. Players try not to loose in various minigames to escape punishment. Each mini game is competitive and has unique winning goal. The goal of mini-games could be for example:  beating others in rock-paper-scissors to become a Viking,  hitting the table with your hand to &lsquo;stun&rsquo; other players, following the rules made by crazy king or not being the last to row a viking ship.<br/><br/>Rules of each mini-game determine losers. As Drinking Viking is a party game and vikings celebrate the BIG VICTORY, losers normally consume a beverage. But you can play Stripping Viking as well as you can play it just by collecting black points which is another funny way to play.<br/><br/>The game ends when all cards are played. Then the winner or winners are determined depending on a game type. Winner is a player who has lowest score or the player who has the most pieces of clothing or the player who drank less than others. It is very simple to recognize winners and losers.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "4", "boardgameversion": ["First edition"], "age": "15", "name": "Drinking Viking", "playingtime": "120", "boardgamemechanic": ["Action / Movement Programming", "Memory", "Press Your Luck", "Rock-Paper-Scissors"], "average": "4", "usersrated": "2", "boardgamefamily": ["Crowdfunding: Indiegogo", "Vikings"]}, "157897": {"boardgamedesigner": ["Erik von Rossing"], "average": "0", "poll": [], "name": "Morocco Ablaze: A Solitaire Game of Revolts and Uprisings in French North Africa", "playingtime": "30", "minplayers": "1", "boardgamemechanic": ["Campaign / Battle Card Driven", "Card Drafting", "Dice Rolling", "Point to Point Movement"], "yearpublished": "2014", "usersrated": "0", "maxplayers": "1", "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1996375_t.png", "boardgameartist": ["Erik von Rossing"], "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["(Self-Published)", "(Web published)", "Berserker Games"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1996375.png", "boardgameversion": ["First edition"], "maxplaytime": "30", "boardgamecategory": ["Post-Napoleonic", "Print & Play", "Wargame"], "age": "8", "minplaytime": "30", "description": "BACKGROUND: MOROCCO ABLAZE is semi-historical simulation of the French Colonial Conquest of Northern Africa from 1870-1930.

This is not an official name for the edition of the game, but it is something the fans use.<br/><br/>Since the terms of the OGL forbid me from using the official name of the game or the name of the SRD, this supplement (and the modified version of the game arrived at when using this supplement with the original version of the SRD) is instead called &ldquo;3.Y&rdquo; as a pun on the &ldquo;3.x&rdquo; label.<br/><br/>from And What Is So Different About It?:<br/>Playing the game using this supplement is around 95% similar to playing using just the SRD on which it was based. This is to be expected, since the amount of material in this supplement is tiny compared to the amount in the whole SRD. However, the 5% that this supplement changes is the crucial part.

The arrival of scientists from Earth disturbs its fragile balance. The power gained by controlling magic changes the scientists &ndash; they become possessed by the lust for making this world better. They become gods, who are willing to sacrifice any life, except for their own, of course, to accomplish their &ndash; great, according to them &ndash; ideas.<br/><br/>Players impersonate the scientists struggling for the domination over The Coast of Sails and also for staying on Midgaard, because soon after them another person arrives to this world: Vuko Drakkainen, highly trained agent, whose task is to find the members of scientific expedition and send them back to Earth &mdash; or as a last resort make them vanish. Will the players, as powerful gods, allow him to do it?<br/><br/>From the first turn, the players are tossed in the middle of war. They will feel the adrenaline, fear, pain and the heat of a battle. They will smell blood and sweat, hear the clash of arms and the moaning of wounded and dying.<br/><br/>The Lord of the Ice Garden takes place on The Coast of Sails, which is divided into several regions. The main goal is fighting for the domination over those regions. A region is dominated by the player with the most influence in it. Dominating the region allows players to collect its resources (M-factor, gold, population), also to win victory points in specific turns, and to accomplish their own goals. Each player has unique winning conditions and special units.<br/><br/><br/>    Olaf Fjollsfinn &ndash; uses Ice Drakkars to seduce/kidnap six dwellers of The Coast of Sails to the Ice Garden.<br/><br/><br/><br/>    Passionaria Callo &ndash; sends nightmares on the controlled regions and tries to isolate them. She needs to isolate two of them.<br/><br/><br/><br/>    Pier van Dyken &ndash; greedy collector of M-factor. When he dominates a region with  a magical reserve, he may move it towards his headquarters, The Thorn. He needs to absorb four magical reserves.<br/><br/><br/><br/>    Ulrike Freihoff &ndash; spreads her religion. When she dominates a region where she also has a special unit called The Enlightened One, she may build a Red Tower there. Six of those grant her victory.<br/><br/><br/>There is also Vuko, who came to evacuate the scientists and clean up their mess. Each turn he goes to the region, where the player with least reputation/morality (it decreases each time the player uses magic) has the most influence. Such a visit is nothing nice &ndash; Vuko kills one special unit of that player in this region and lowers his/her influence there.<br/><br/>The game may end in one of the three ways:<br/><br/>    Meeting the player's unique victory condition &ndash; the game ends and that player is the winner,<br/>    After specified number of turns game ends and the player with most victory points is the winner,<br/>    The Dead Snow token reaches the end of its track &ndash; each use of magic shakes the balance of Midgaard. If the players exceed the limit of changes that world and its gods can accept, the game ends and the winner is the player with the highest reputation.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>INITIATIVE PHASE:<br/>During the initiative phase players decide how many action tokens they will have for the current turn and also determine the player order during the Planning Phase. Moreover, they can initiate scoring of the regions by moving their initiative tokens. In the advanced mode they also determine the order of action fields resolution.<br/><br/>PLANNING PHASE:<br/>Players, one by one in the order determined in the Initiative Phase, place their action tokens on selected action fields.<br/><br/>ACTION PHASE:<br/>Players perform actions in the action fields, in the order determined by the placement of tokens.<br/>&bull; Viper's Nest &ndash; player receives one token of any resource. They can also exchange resources.<br/>&bull; Influence &ndash; player may sacrifice up to two population tokens to place as many influence tokens on the region(s) where they already have at least one influence<br/>&bull; Move &ndash; player may sacrifice up to two gold tokens to make as many moves of their influence tokens and/or special units to the neighboring region(s)<br/>&bull; Voracious Mountain &ndash; player may sacrifice population to move any number of their influence tokens and/or special units from one region to any other region<br/>&bull; Raven's Shadow &ndash; player may raise his/her reputation or use a magic token to get rid of the disadvantageous token of contact with Vuko.<br/>&bull; Magic &ndash; allows the player to do any of the three actions: translocate the M-factor, summon special units of the given level, add a new ability to the special unit. Each of those actions results in moving the Dead Snow token up on its track and decreasing the player's reputation.<br/>&bull; Activation (automatic field) &ndash; after resolving the actions players may activate the abilities of their special units. The order of activation of given abilities is strictly determined. After the activation the situation on the board may change drastically.<br/>&bull; Vuko Drakkainen (automatic field) &ndash; each turn Vuko must go to another region. Its figure is placed in the region, where the most immoral player has the most influence. That player receives a conact token decreasing his/her influence, and also loses one special unit in this region (provided he/she had any). In the advanced mode players will be able to equip Vuko with more abilities, that will activate in specific moments of the game.<br/><br/>DOMINATION PHASE:<br/>Players collect victory points and resources from the regions, and accomplish their unique goals.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "1", "boardgameversion": ["English second edition", "German second edition", "Multilingual first edition", "Polish second edition"], "average": "7.7782", "name": "The Lord of the Ice Garden", "playingtime": "90", "boardgamemechanic": ["Action / Movement Programming", "Action Point Allowance System", "Area Control / Area Influence", "Variable Phase Order", "Variable Player Powers", "Worker Placement"], "age": "14", "boardgameexpansion": ["The Lord of the Ice Garden: Vuko Tiles Promo"], "usersrated": "528", "boardgameaccessory": ["The Lord of the Ice Garden: Castle", "The Lord of the Ice Garden: Magical Reserve 3D Markers", "The Lord of the Ice Garden: Nightmare 3D Markers", "The Lord of the Ice Garden: Red Towers", "The Lord of the Ice Garden: Vuko 3D Markers"], "boardgamesubdomain": ["Strategy Games"], "boardgamefamily": ["Crowdfunding: Kickstarter", "Crowdfunding: Spieleschmiede", "Crowdfunding: Wspieram"], "boardgamepodcastepisode": ["The Game Pit: Episode 32 - Essen 2014 Treasure Hunt Special (part 2)", "TRCP Launch Episode 2", "TRCP Sunday Fund Day Episode 1"]}, "157919": {"rpgartist": ["Zoltan Boros", "Steffen Brand", "Tristan Denecke", "Eva D\u00fcnzinger", "Michael Jaecks", "Janina Robben", "Nadine Sch\u00e4kel", "Patrick Soeder", "G\u00e1bor Szikszai", "Fabrice Weiss"], "rpgitemversion": ["Hardcover Version"], "poll": [], "name": "Firuns Fl\u00fcstern", "rpgdesigner": ["Jens Ullrich"], "rpgproducer": ["Ralf Berszuck", "Eevie Demirtel", "Marie M\u00f6nkemeyer", "Daniel Simon Richter", "Alex Spohr"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1995629.jpg", "usersrated": "1", "rpgsetting": ["Aventurien"], "average": "3", "statistics": [], "rpggenre": ["Fantasy (High Fantasy)"], "rpgpublisher": ["Ulisses Spiele"], "rpg": ["Das Schwarze Auge (DSA) (4th Edition)"], "rpgcategory": ["Scenario / Adventure / Module"], "rpgseries": ["Ausbau Abenteuer", "Splitterd\u00e4mmerung"], "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1995629_t.jpg", "description": "from the back of the book (Google translate)<br/><br/>A whisper, not much more than a breath of wind, blowing over the far north Aventuria.

At first the monsters will be more random mutation than representative of a stable gene pool (players will draw most of the cards for each hand from the common deck), but by the time players reach the Teratozoic Era, their monsters will be built entirely from the best traits they've been able to retain each generation.<br/><br/>The dominant species in this new era (the final winner of the game) will be the one with the most robust gene pool&mdash;the player who can create the biggest, most impressive monsters at the end of the Teratozoic Era.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": ["First edition", "Preview edition"], "average": "5.58758", "name": "Teratozoic", "playingtime": "60", "boardgamemechanic": ["Deck / Pool Building", "Pattern Building"], "age": "13", "usersrated": "33", "boardgamefamily": ["Crowdfunding: Kickstarter"], "boardgamepodcastepisode": ["CnC Plays - Teratozoic", "Episode 4 - Teratozoic", "Episode Four: How to Teach A Deckbuilder"]}, "157943": {"image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1993437.jpg", "poll": [], "boardgamedesigner": ["Ailea Sneller"], "statistics": [], "yearpublished": "2014", "maxplayers": "30", "age": "17", "boardgamepublisher": ["(Unpublished)"], "boardgameintegration": ["Cards Against Humanity", "Cards Against Humanity"], "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1993437_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "30", "boardgamecategory": ["Card Game", "Humor", "Mature / Adult", "Party Game", "Print & Play"], "description": "A card game that makes a mockery of one of civilization&rsquo;s most sacred institutions.<br/><br/>CAD (noun)/ 'kad/: A witty charmer who behaves dishonorably and irresponsibly in matters of love.<br/><br/>In the spring of 2013, I was put in charge of games for my dear friend Nicky&rsquo;s bachelorette party. Since I had no experience planning wedding party games, I went online to look for ideas, and found plenty of them that were extremely lame. I knew Nicky deserved better. I was playing a lot of Cards Against Humanity at the time, so was inspired to create a card game that honors the glorious institution that is matrimony, while also preparing my friend for the all frightening realities and ceremonial absurdity of humanity&rsquo;s most fraught life-long commitment. The game I made for Nicky on my laptop and home printer was as hilarious, embarrassing, depraved, and satisfying as marriage itself. So I decided I should share it with everyone.<br/><br/>The game is simple to play: one person reads a question or fill-in-the-blank card aloud to a group of friends. Each player then gives an answer card that they think best responds. The reader picks the response they like best.

A remixed version of the game called World War Zero was later released for the PlayStation 2 and Microsoft Windows. Set in an alternate history in which World War I never ended, the game takes place in 1964, the 50th year of the war, and focuses on an Allied soldier's mission to stop the Russo-Mongolian Empire from developing nuclear weapons and his later efforts to end the war.<br/><br/>Iron Storm displays a mix between World War I siege tactics, such as trench warfare and the use of mustard gas, and some World War II-style weapons such as machine guns, mortars, tanks, and rocket launchers of that era, as well as more contemporary technology such as helicopters, wireless communication, spy satellites, anti-personnel mines, and unmanned turrets.<br/><br/>The player character cannot take much damage before dying, and there are many enemies equipped with powerful weapons such as sniper rifles or anti-tank rifles. Several in-game glitches and vague mission objectives could often force players to replay one level multiple times before finally succeeding. Enemies also behave erratically, as seen when several attempt to walk through walls, or when the player shoots a particular enemy multiple times and yet the enemy remains unscathed.<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;Iron Storm (video game)&quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "157961": {"poll": [], "name": "Crayon Chronicles", "videogamemode": ["Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["Downloadable Windows Edition"], "average": "7", "videogametheme": ["Cute Fantasy"], "usersrated": "1", "videogamedeveloper": ["Outer Grid Games"], "videogamegenre": ["RPG"], "videogameplatform": ["Windows"], "statistics": [], "videogamepublisher": ["Outer Grid Games"], "description": "Crayon Chronicles offers a relatively short (2-4 hours per play-through) but action-packed RPG experience that randomly generates the level layouts each time you play.<br/><br/>You are encouraged to play through the game more than once thanks to the random nature of the environment layouts, but also because we keep track of the interesting facts about each play-through (in our newfangled &quot;Heroic Hallitorium&quot;) so you can compare your adventures to each other as well as to the adventures of your friends.<br/><br/>Crayon Chronicles offers:<br/><br/>50+ enemy creatures<br/>    200+ items and gear to find<br/>    13 different environments to explore<br/>    Saving and continuing (if you stay alive)<br/><br/>Your character will be able to carry:<br/><br/>A helmet<br/>    Armor<br/>    A main weapon<br/>    An off-hand weapon (unused when you have a two-handed weapon equipped)<br/>    A ranged weapon (recharges shots as you use melee attacks)<br/>    A skill power (recharges as you defeat enemies)<br/>    4 consumable item slots<br/><br/>The helmet, armor, main weapon, and off-hand weapon will all visually update on your character's avatar in-game.<br/><br/>Source: The Developer Website.<br/><br/>"}, "157962": {"poll": [], "name": "Flatspace", "videogamemode": ["Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["PC Windows Downloadable Edition", "PC Windows Edition"], "average": "0", "videogametheme": ["Space"], "usersrated": "0", "videogamedeveloper": ["Cornutopia Software"], "videogamegenre": ["4x Strategy", "Management", "RPG"], "videogameplatform": ["Windows"], "statistics": [], "videogamepublisher": ["Cornutopia Software"], "description": "Flatspace is an indie game for Microsoft Windows released in 2003, in which the player assumes the role of a spaceship captain.

The armed forces of the former governments joined to serve as police and security forces of the new world government.

Many civilizations were already on the brink of collapse, and had already left their deteriorating home worlds behind in search of resources, peace, and solidarity.<br/><br/>As new civilizations arrived in the TAU CETI system, they settled among the planets, terraforming them into more hospitable worlds. With this mass migration a new alliance was quickly formed, known as the TAU CETI Authority, which encouraged diplomacy among the different cultures and emerged as the new economic power.<br/><br/>Trade began, with each civilization utilizing their strengths and comparative advantages to maximize productivity. Heralded among the civilizations, a sense of friendship, economic prosperity and peace enriched the star system.<br/><br/>But all is not well.

According to Ng&ocirc; Qu&yacute; S\u01a1n, the oldest western source on the game, it was once played by boys too. The game is valuable for promoting calculating abilities. It is said that the Vietnamese mathematician M\u1ea1c Hi\u1ec3n T&iacute;ch discovered s\u1ed1 \u1ea9n (negative numbers; literally: &quot;hidden / secret number&quot;) in 1086 by playing &Ocirc; \u0102n Quan.<br/><br/>The game was first described in a western language (French) by Ng&ocirc; Qu&yacute; S\u01a1n in 1944. It seems to be identical to &Ocirc; L&agrave;ng described by Lynn Rohrbough in 1955. A Vietnamese mancala game was also mentioned in Viltis (&quot;Hope&quot;) in 1984 (January-February issue), a magazine of folklore and folk dance published in Denver, USA.<br/><br/>There is a Vietnamese mancala board in the Mus&eacute;e du Quai Branly (Paris, France) called pan u ao, which comes from the Muong people in Hoa Binh in northern Vietnam and was collected in 1938. Perhaps it was used for &Ocirc; \u0102n Quan. The game itself seems to be related to mancala games found in Yunnan, China, such as Laomuzhu and Ceelkoqyuqkoqiji.<br/><br/>&Ocirc; \u0102n Quan is a traditional Vietnamese children's board game.<br/><br/>The board is an oval with five squares per side and, in addition, a bigger one at each end. The small squares are called &quot;citizen squares&quot; (&ocirc; d&acirc;n), &quot;ricefields&quot; (ru\u1ed9ng) or &quot;fishponds&quot; (ao ci) and the big ones &quot;mandarin squares&quot; (&ocirc; quan). The board is drawn on the ground.<br/><br/>Each player or team controls five farmer squares, while the mandarin squares are neutral. Each player puts five pebbles (fruit seeds or other small objects) in each square he owns and a big stone, the &quot;mandarin&quot; (quan), on the mandarin square. The pebbles are known as d&acirc;n (&quot;people&quot;, &quot;citizen&quot;).<br/><br/>On his turn a player picks up the contents of one of his ricefields and distributes the pebbles, one by one, in either direction on the following squares (including both mandarin squares). This is called r\u1ea3i (&quot;to scatter&quot;).<br/><br/>When all pieces are distributed, the player repeats by taking up the pieces of the following square and distributing them.<br/><br/>When the next square to be distributed is empty, the player wins all the pieces in the square after that.<br/><br/>The game ends when the two mandarin squares are empty, which is called &quot;fall of the mandarins&quot; (h\u1ebft quan). The winner is the player who has more points. Pebbles count 1 point, mandarins 10 points.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": ["Public Domain edition"], "age": "5", "name": "\u00d4 \u0102n Quan", "playingtime": "10", "boardgamemechanic": ["Pick-up and Deliver"], "average": "7", "usersrated": "1", "boardgamefamily": ["Mancala"]}, "157508": {"boardgamedesigner": ["(Uncredited)"], "average": "5", "poll": [], "name": "F\u00e4delspiel: Im Zoo", "playingtime": "0", "minplayers": "2", "yearpublished": "2013", "usersrated": "1", "maxplayers": "4", "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2285033_t.jpg", "boardgameartist": ["(Uncredited)"], "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["HABA - Habermaa\u00df GmbH"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2285033.jpg", "boardgameversion": ["Multilingual first edition"], "maxplaytime": "0", "boardgamecategory": ["Animals", "Children's Game"], "age": "2", "minplaytime": "0", "description": "Who will be the first to get their 2 threaded animal beads to Zookeeper George first?

Each card has its own effect that depends on the level of the pyramid where the card is played. These effects may give more resources, more cards, or victory points. The player who has the most power points at the end of the game becomes the ruler of entire Laar and the winner!<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "1", "boardgameversion": ["Chinese first edition", "Czech first edition", "English first edition", "English Limited edition", "English second edition", "French first edition", "German first edition", "Italian first edition", "Polish first edition", "Russian first edition", "Spanish First Edition"], "average": "7.03618", "name": "Viceroy", "playingtime": "60", "boardgamemechanic": ["Card Drafting", "Hand Management", "Memory", "Set Collection", "Tile Placement"], "age": "12", "boardgameexpansion": ["Viceroy Promo Cards", "Viceroy: Balance of power Promo Card"], "usersrated": "3313", "boardgameaccessory": ["Viceroy: Gems", "Viceroy: Playmat"], "boardgamesubdomain": ["Strategy Games"], "boardgamefamily": ["Berserk", "Crowdfunding: Giochistarter", "Crowdfunding: Kickstarter", "Crowdfunding: Wspieram"], "boardgamepodcastepisode": ["BGA Ep 81 - If You Like 7 Wonders, Try...", "Episode 107-- Gen Con 2015 Wrap up and La Granja Review", "Episode 17:  Mysterium Review - Christmas Song - Giveaway - Christmas Wishes", "Episode 19 - Going Once\u2026Going Twice\u2026", "Episode 33 : Gencon 2016 Recap + Interview with Ryan Bruns (Mayday Games)", "Episode 37 - Dead of Winter Halloween Spooktacular", "Episode 53- Elysium and GenCon 2015 Preview", "Episode 55- Viceroy and On-Line Gaming (CONTEST WINNER!)", "Gaming Rules! \u2013 Podcast 18", "MN 0071 Viceroy", "MOBG 24 Best of 2014 (21-01-15)", "MOBG 38 When Joel meet Lewis", "Perfect Information Podcast Episode 18 - You're the Best Around!", "Vox Republica 103: Spooky Gaming", "Vox Republica 107: Getting Tricky With Trickerion", "What Did You Play This Week Podcast Thing Week 39!!!

On the surface, it looks much like the world you and I live in. Just beneath that surface, in the shadows, rages an ancient conflict between supernatural factions who all seek dominion over the Earth and control over the souls of humanity.<br/><br/>A new type of creature has been born from the escalated conflicts of the war. Angels caught in the midst of a fall and enslaved through blasphemous rituals are being recruited by a faction of desperate Arcanists. These enslaved angels are called the chabash.<br/><br/>Falling Stars acts as a primer on the chabash, giving rules for their creation both within the context of the game world and as player characters or NPCs. The faction responsible for the chabash is also explored, allowing players to oppose these power-hungry Arcanists, or perhaps to assume the roles of members of the conspiracy.<br/><br/>Falling Stars also includes a few adventure seeds that deal directly with the discovery of the chabash. Within these seeds are story ideas for integrating this new celestial race into your Contagion Second Edition campaign whether as antagonists, McGuffins or as player characters.<br/><br/>In addition to those suggestions, Falling Stars contains several transmedia resources that Gamemasters can use to enhance their stories where the chabash are concerned, including handouts and reference art for players, audio recordings that may be played in game to enrich your experience, and a video prelude for one adventure seed in which a group of loosely acquainted characters are led to a free chabash and entreated to discover its origins.<br/><br/>Falling Stars includes:<br/><br/>     Detailed background on the Fraternitas Alaraia, an order of Arcanists with a diabolical plan<br/>     A new playable race: the chabash<br/>     A new Spell: Bind the Falling Star, which allows the creation of a chabash<br/>     Four adventure seeds for stories dealing with the chabash<br/>     Seven pregenerated characters for use as player characters or NPCs<br/>     Twelve sample pages from the journal of Lyndon Ivory, which may be used to enhance your game as player handouts, sample scrolls, or character journal pages.

This supplement was written with a couple of ideas in mind. The first was to allow for enough information to create a fantasy adventure where alien spaceships crash landed in the world of pixies and unicorns. This place would still seem like a dungeon environment to the adventurers, where robots are golems and lasers are magical crossbows. The second was to take the fantasy role-playing game rules we love and have adventures in a dystopian future where major skyscrapers fill the cities, elves ride motorcycles, and dwarves carry plasma rifles . Instead of roaming dark dungeon hallways, adventurers traverse large buildings of corporate villains in search of money and technology.

Every so often the wizards of Ebon Tower came up with dastardly plans to conquer the world. However, none of them proved effective. Perhaps this was because too much time was spent arguing about who used the last of the dragons blood and forgot to order any more.<br/><br/>The most powerful wizard in the Ebon Tower is known as the Archmage and rules the other wizards through fear and intimidation. The Archmage's power is amplified greatly by a mystical crown. Whenever an Archmage dies, whoever first bonds with the Archmage's crown becomes the new Archmage.<br/><br/>The current Archmage is Cleon, who is the fourth Archmage to have ruled Ebon Tower.

In addition to the Archm age, Ebon Tower is home to four wizards, one apprentice and a &quot;man&quot; that the Archmage created from spare parts.

This is because you design the very track you're racing on, while you're racing on it. How it comes together is up to those playing, and manipulating the track to your advantage or against your opponent's advantage plays a large factor in determining the victor. You can even design your own short-cut.<br/><br/>Coupled with this unique game mechanic, players during the race also gain items, such as the Booster, which lets you jet ahead of the competition; The Dodge Ball, which whacks your friends and slows them down; The Squirrel, which creates a roadblock forcing players to change course; Or the Bomb which decimates the track and all on it. Some items are left right on the track to benefit or to hinder your friends, and other items can even be used to defend yourself, making each game unique and strategic.<br/><br/>Changes from Mad Rush Rally (Source: Sean McDonald on Krashin' Karts)<br/><br/>Krash Karts resolves some strategic issues players had with the game where lagging behind intentionally during the race was one of the better strategies. This has been fixed by giving the last player better chances to get better items, but have less control over how the track lays out. Further, the Track has been reduced to 3 lanes, rather then the 4 of Mad Rush Rally, but players are allowed to occupy the same space now. The track has also now been laid out in a staggered pattern ala Formula D, rather than a grid, and also now accompanies a max of 6 players, rather then 4.

The system features encounters little known yet strategically fraught. These are fights that, had they concluded differently, might well have transformed a campaign, a reputation, or both.

The next installment in the series will be Wilderness, in quadri-game form but which will come together in one big campaign game.<br/><br/>Scale: Combat units are Infantry, Cavalry, and Artillery. Each Infantry and Cavalry unit represents 3 or more companies of a given regiment. Each Artillery unit represents an Artillery Section of 1 or two guns. Leader units represent individual commanders.

This scenario forms part of the tradition that both Evangelion and RahXephon established in retelling their entire story in a single movie, consisting of the most important scenes edited together. Like those movies, the pace in this scenario will be frantic and the players will be scrambling to keep up with the events. However, this is intentional and both those movies help establish how this scenario is likely to feel in play. Embrace the madness.<br/><br/>This scenario revolves around the three main Acts of what I envisaged to be the three stages of the longer campaign.

In the modern age, we live in a safe and secure world created from compliance with established social norms. Survival horror asks the question: what happens when those social norms collapse? &hellip; Survival horror uses the imminent threat to put everything we value in jeopardy. This includes the society in which the survivors live, their sanity, their morality, their relationships and everything they value or love.<br/><br/>The survival horror aspects of this scenario are further emphasised by having a cast of teenagers. Teenagers are more volatile than adults and have less established patterns of behaviour. Yet, for them, relationships are the most important aspect of their lives. &hellip; In this scenario, these elements create additional drama and tension as they seem more willing to victimise, isolate and die for each other. These factors culminate in Act Three where the PCs, in the face of utter annihilation, are forced to decide who and what is important enough to them to risk their own survival for, and who and what they must let go even if they desperately don&rsquo;t [want] to do so.<br/><br/>"}, "157631": {"rpgartist": ["(Uncredited)"], "rpgitemversion": ["PDF version"], "rpgseries": ["Kapcon Scenario Design Contest"], "name": "The 18:25 to New London", "rpgdesigner": ["Sophie Melchior"], "rpgproducer": ["(Uncredited)"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1984606.png", "usersrated": "0", "average": "0", "statistics": [], "rpg": ["Angel Role-playing Game"], "rpgpublisher": ["(Web published)"], "poll": [], "rpgcategory": ["Scenario / Adventure / Module"], "rpggenre": ["Horror (Supernatural)", "Modern (Near Future)", "Occult", "Science Fiction (Post Apocalypse)"], "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1984606_t.png", "description": "from the introduction:<br/>The 18:25 to New London is set on a luxury train travelling from Glasgow to New London.

First came Paths of Glory by Ted Raicer, which simulates the entire war in Europe and the Middle East.  It was followed by Pursuit of Glory, designed by Brad and Brian Stock, which focuses on the war in the Near East.  Illusions of Glory takes this game system to a new and exciting level by applying its focus to the Eastern Front.<br/><br/>The Allied Powers bring massive forces to bear against Germany, Austria-Hungary, Bulgaria, and Turkey while trying to prevent a game-changing revolution in Russia.  The Central Powers must defeat Russia, hold off Italy, and win the upper hand in the Balkans or face demoralization and rebellion at home.  Players test their generalship and strategic abilities as Illusions of Glory lets you recreate the dramatic events of World War I&rsquo;s Eastern Front.<br/><br/>Your hand of strategy cards present you with a rich array of strategic and operational choices.  You must decide whether to use each card for its historic event, unit movement, combat, or troop replacements. You must commit your forces to a variety of objectives: winning the dynamic war of maneuver between German-led and Russian armies; seizing the Balkans and its vital objectives; or prevailing in the conflict between Austria-Hungary and Italy.<br/><br/>Illusions of Glory offers complete campaigns and shorter playing scenarios.<br/><br/>GAME SCENARIOS:<br/>    Campaign Game<br/>    Mobilization<br/>    Limited War<br/>    Total War<br/>    Italian Front Mini Game<br/><br/>GAME SCALE:<br/>    Historical Duration:  1914 to 1918<br/>    Units:  Corps and Divisions<br/>    Time:  Three months per turn<br/>    Map:  Point to Point<br/>    Players: 2-4<br/><br/>"}, "157654": {"boardgamedesigner": ["Patrick Perrin"], "average": "0", "poll": [], "name": "My Tailor is Rich!: Le jeu de l\u2019anglais", "playingtime": "40", "minplayers": "2", "yearpublished": "2013", "usersrated": "0", "maxplayers": "8", "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1985363_t.jpg", "boardgameartist": ["Val\u00e9rie Hanol"], "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["Assimil"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1985363.jpg", "boardgameversion": ["English/French edition"], "maxplaytime": "40", "boardgamecategory": ["Educational", "Trivia"], "age": "10", "minplaytime": "40", "description": "The English game for the whole family from 10 years-old children.<br/>Language, pop-culture, royals, challenges of all kinds: from the United Kingdom to USA, Canada, Australia, English is available in 1600 questions and challenges fun, strange or useful.<br/><br/>This is a trivia game.
