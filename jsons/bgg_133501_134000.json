The goal of the game is to defeat all enemy units.<br/><br/>"}, "133537": {"poll": [], "name": "1984: Animal Farm \u2013 Spiel 2012 promo cards", "playingtime": "0", "minplayers": "0", "yearpublished": "2012", "boardgameexpansion": [], "usersrated": "7", "boardgamefamily": ["BoardGameGeek Promo Offerings", "Promotional Cards"], "maxplayers": "0", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1471640_t.jpg", "average": "5.57143", "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["Ku\u017ania Gier"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1471640.jpg", "boardgameversion": ["First edition"], "maxplaytime": "0", "boardgamecategory": ["Expansion for Base-game"], "age": "0", "minplaytime": "0", "description": "A set of 5 exclusive promo action cards for Essen 2012 - added to each copy bought as a preorder or at booth 4-121 during the fair.

On one hand, players share some business with their neighbors; on the other hand &ndash; they are divided by the will to win.

At the same time, it forces the players to form temporary alliances with their enemies and keep an eye on their friends.

Re-live epic battles with your family and friends. Manage your crew to carry out manoeuvres with your ship, attack the other players&rsquo; ships and co-operate with players in your faction to achieve victory.<br/><br/>1.1. Characteristics:<br/>The players play 1 on 1, or combine into 2 factions of 1 vs 1, 2 vs 2 or 3 vs 3. The game takes about 45 minutes and is for players over 8 years old.<br/><br/>1.2. Prologue:<br/>The game combines simple mechanics, the placement of crew, to choose different manoeuvres. Take advantage of the possibilities offered by the terrain and your boat to sink the enemy.<br/><br/>2.0. Objective of the game:<br/><br/>2.1. Arena mode<br/><br/>The first group to sink the enemy ships is the winner. You don&rsquo;t use the score card for this mode, as the sinking of all the enemy&rsquo;s ships implies that the enemy player has been eliminated.<br/><br/>(Games of 2 vs 2) The first side to lose a ship receives 2 order cards. There is no effect for ships sunk after that.<br/><br/>(Games of 3 vs 3) The first side to lost 2 ships receives 2 order cards between the players of that side. In other words the first team to be reduced to just 1 ship will receive 2 order cards. There is no effect when other teams are reduced to 1 ship later.<br/><br/>2.2. War mode<br/><br/>The first side to get 5 victory points is the winner. Sinking an enemy ship earns you 1 victory point. This is shown by advancing your score token on the score card by 1 position.<br/><br/>When a ship is sunk, it is returned to the beginning map card and flipped over to show that it will miss the next turn. When the ship is restored after being sunk, it is fully restored (crew, repairs and breakdowns) and you can choose any one of the available spaces on the beginning card to place it in.<br/><br/>A player who sinks a ship receives an order card.<br/><br/>3.0. Contents:<br/><br/>15 map cards<br/>30 order cards<br/>3 blue control cards<br/>3 red control cards<br/>1 scorecard<br/>18 red cubes<br/>18 yellow cube<br/>36 white cubes<br/>6 ship pieces<br/>2 score tokens<br/><br/>3.1. Map cards:<br/><br/>The map cards are divided into 4 boxes, which each count as one space for movement. Only 1 ship can occupy a box.<br/><br/>Islands: These are impassable, so ships can not move over them, and they block line-of-sight for firing.<br/><br/>Running water: When a ship enters this box, it automatically receives +1 movement which must be used to move to a neighbouring box. If that neighbouring box also has running water, the ship gains another +1 movement, and so on.<br/><br/>3.2. Control cards<br/><br/>There are 3 kinds of ship in Red Code: Submarine; Destroyer; Aircraft carrier. These have some similar manoeuvres, but also some manoeuvres which are unique to that kind.<br/><br/>On the control card, yellow cubes (repairs) and red cubes (breakdowns) are used to show the state of the ship. Once both of these characteristics have been reduced to 0, the ship is sunk. During the game, any damage taken by the ship reduces the amount of repairs. When the number of repairs hits 0, remove a breakdown token and put 3 repair tokens back on the control card (1 breakdown = 3 repairs). You are not allowed to exceed the amount of breakdown and repair spaces available on the control card.<br/><br/>Another area of the control card shows what your crew (white cubes) are doing, and this is used to manage the different manoeuvres. At the start, all ships have 6 crew, placed on the crew area on the control card. The control cards each have 4 common manoeuvre boxes and 4 unique manoeuvre boxes.<br/><br/>Crew: These are used to pay the cost of your ship&rsquo;s manoeuvres. You use up your crew during the battle, but also recover crew each turn during the battle. [Representing the energy of your crew, rather than individual crew members] The crew are the engine of this game, and so good management of your crew is what makes your ship more lethal.<br/><br/>Manoeuvres: You must choose appropriate attack or defence actions at particular points to manage your ship effectively. Manoeuvres with a crew member already on the square can not be used during that turn.<br/><br/>&bull;    Movement: Move one square. Can not be responded to.<br/>    &bull;    Repair: Regain 1 repair cube.<br/>    &bull;    Torpedo: Does 1 repair damage, at a maximum distance of 2 spaces.<br/>    &bull;    Orders: Draw one order card. Can not be responded to.<br/>    &bull;    Immersion: Move two squares. Can not be responded to.<br/>    &bull;    Countermeasure: Does 1 repair damage, at a maximum of 2 spaces, and you regain 1 repair cube.<br/>    &bull;    Heavy torpedo: Does 2 repair damage, at a maximum distance of 3 spaces.<br/>    &bull;    Floating mine: Does 2 repair damage plus 1 crew damage, at a maximum distance of 1 space.<br/>    &bull;    Missile: Does 1 repair damage, at a maximum distance of 2 spaces. Can not be responded to.<br/>    &bull;    Depth charge: Does 2 repair damage, at a maximum distance of 1 space.<br/>    &bull;    Shield: Cancels the current manoeuvre, at a maximum distance of 3 spaces.<br/>    &bull;    Assault: Does 1 repair damage, at a maximum distance of 1 space.<br/>    &bull;    Air support: Does 1 repair damage, at a maximum distance of 3 spaces.<br/>    &bull;    Radio support: Regain 1 repair cube at a maximum distance of 2 spaces. Can not be responded to.<br/>    &bull;    Medical equipment: Regain 1 breakdown cube, at a maximum distance of 2 spaces.<br/>    &bull;    Radar: Does 1 repair damage plus 1 crew damage at a maximum distances of 3 spaces. Can not be responded to.<br/><br/>Available manoeuvres: Manoeuvres that do not have any crew on their squares are available to be used. The players can only use these manoeuvres on their turn and can only use the manoeuvres on their ship, except for the response manoeuvres. Manoeuvres that can be used as responses are marked in yellow on the control card and can be used both on your turn and the other players&rsquo; turns. Note that the manoeuvre selected must be available to use - it must not have any crew on it. And responses can only be made when the player whose turn it is has executed a manoeuvre that allows responses.<br/><br/>For example: The counter measure manoeuvre has a distance of two, and can repair 1 damage and do 1 damage.<br/><br/>Visual field: This shows what your ship can see and where it can carry out actions. It includes the boxes in a straight line horizontally, vertically and diagonally from your ship and depends on the distance that the specific manoeuvre you want to use has. For example: If an manoeuvre has no distance, you can only carry it out on yourself, but if a manoeuvre has a distance of 2, then it can be used on any ship that distance or less (horizontally, vertically or diagonally only) including your own ship. [In the example picture, the red destroyer can target the blue submarine but can not target the blue destroyer.]<br/><br/>Note that the enemy ships have the same effect as islands in blocking your line of sight.<br/><br/>3.3. Order cards.<br/><br/>These provide certain advantages in the game, providing bonuses, hurting the enemy or modifying the characteristics of the ship (movement, repairs, manoeuvres, etc.). Only 1 order card can be used per turn, but the effects can be used on any target on the table, regardless of distance or objects blocking line of sight. In other words, order cards are not affected by the visual field. In addition, order cards will always be executed and offer no chance for the enemy to respond. Each player may not have more than 3 order cards in their hand at any time.<br/><br/>&bull;    Ambush: The target ship loses 2 repair.<br/>    &bull;    Deserter: The target ship loses 1 crew from the reserve. This crew member can be recovered in the crew recovery phase.<br/>    &bull;    Boatswain: The target ship recovers 2 crew.<br/>    &bull;    Atomic bomb: 2 repair damage to all ships in a 2 by 2 square (4 spaces in total).<br/>    &bull;    Evasion: The target ship gains +3 movement.<br/>    &bull;    Captain: 1 repair damage to the target ship, and then you draw 1 order card.<br/>    &bull;    Mechanic: The target ship gains 2 repair.<br/>    &bull;    Intercept: 1 repair damage to the target ship, and can not carry out any manoeuvres until their next turn. This means that the target ship will not be able to respond to any manoeuvres until its next turn.<br/>    &bull;    Kamikaze: 1 breakdown damage to the target ship (remember, 1 breakdown equals 3 repairs).<br/><br/>4.0. Beginning of the game<br/><br/>4.1. Preparation of the table:<br/><br/>Shuffle the map cards and place face up a 3 by 4 formation (see example picture). The 3 cards left over are not used in the game.<br/><br/>4.2. Preparation of the ships:<br/><br/>The players are divided 1 vs 1, 2 vs 2 or 3 vs 3, depending on the number of players. Next, each player selects a ship from the 3 available, and also takes the corresponding control card. Each player fills up that control card with the red and yellow cubes (repairs and breakdowns) indicated on the control card, plus 6 crew members.<br/><br/>The two teams have a starting card in opposite corners of the board, and the team members put their ships into one of the 4 squares in their starting card.<br/><br/>4.3. Start the game.<br/><br/>Shuffle the order cards and deal out one initial order card to each player. Place the remaining deck of order cards in a pile face-down next to the board.<br/><br/>5.0. Turn phases<br/><br/>5.1. Recover crew<br/><br/>At the start of your turn, you always replace 2 crew into your reserve, either from the manoeuvre spaces or from the pile of withdrawn crew (see the radar and floating mine manoeuvres and the deserter order card).<br/><br/>You choose where to recover the crew from depending on what manoeuvres are needed for your next turn.<br/><br/>5.2. Management of manoeuvres<br/><br/>You use the manoeuvres available to your ship to try to sink the enemy. The manoeuvres cost crew to carry out the action (according to the number of boxes for that manoeuvre), but also depend on the line of vision of the ship. The target must be within the action&rsquo;s range and on a straight line either vertically, horizontally or diagonally.<br/><br/>5.3. Possible responses:<br/><br/>Responses are manoeuvres but can be used in your turn or the turn of another player. For example: Immersion can not be used as a response, but torpedo can be used as a response. The last manoeuvre declared is the first to be carried out. For example, if a player launches an action in front of an enemy and they launch a response which the initial player then responds too, then the response of the first player is completed, then the response of the opponent, and finally the initial manoeuvre. If in the middle of this chain of events a ship is sunk, further manoeuvres in the chain targeting that ship will be wasted but the manoeuvres will still be treated as spent, which means that the crew spent on the manoeuvres will remain spent and the manoeuvres will be unavailable.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": ["First edition"], "average": "5.44262", "name": "Red Code", "playingtime": "45", "boardgamemechanic": ["Action Point Allowance System", "Campaign / Battle Card Driven", "Hand Management", "Modular Board", "Simulation", "Worker Placement"], "age": "8", "usersrated": "65", "boardgamefamily": ["Admin: Better Description Needed!", "Crowdfunding: Verkami"], "boardgamepodcastepisode": ["DdJ 016.

You could take the characters in this game and use it to play mercenaries in the Cluster, but that is not the intent of the game.<br/><br/>The League of Sastras, Vantors, Humans, and Tagris - or SaVaHuTa - is a military-trading alliance, not a nation. Its members are worlds, not people. Members can leave the alliance at any time, and sometimes do, though this is not at all frequent, as there are enormous infrastructure costs attendant on such a move. Alien worlds can possibly be members, but the group or GM must decide how common this practice is.<br/><br/><br/>Navy<br/><br/>The SavaHuTa Navy is responsible for offensive actions in space between systems. The Navy operate Jump Ships, which cross the gulfs of space between systems via Jump routes, naturally occurring wormholes between the suns of the Cluster. Due to the impossibility of synchronizing Jumps made with different ships, Navy ships must be self-contained to a remarkable degree.Larger ships are always one of three types - Ship plus Rider ships, non-Jump capable smaller ships carried through jump by the main ship; Carriers, with their attendant fighters and attack craft; and massive Jump Tugs capable of carrying several large craft, particularly non-jump PDS ships, through Jump.<br/><br/><br/>Marines<br/><br/>The SaVaHuTa Marines ride on all Navy ships. They are responsible for security, boarding other ships, and landing parties. They are also operated as elite landing shock troops in larger numbers. Marines consider themselves at least the equal and probably the superior of any Army or PDG soldier, fostering their self-image as elites, and most of the populace thinks of them the same way.<br/><br/><br/>Army<br/><br/>The SaVaHuTa Army is responsible for long-term taking and holding of ground. They work on planets of vastly different physical properties, their job to take and hold land, and deny it to the enemy. The Army is also responsible for defense in the atmosphere and the oceans of the various worlds.<br/><br/><br/>Planetary Defense Space<br/><br/>The PDS is comprised of the various State Space Navies of the member worlds. PDS ships do not have to be Jump capable, though some are - generally those of Colonizers whose colonies are in other systems. The main function of the PDS is to protect their home system, and possibly that of their colonies, from aggression. Since PDS ships are not required to Jump, with it&rsquo;s consequent loss of synchronicity, more emphasis is placed on Fleet maneuvers and specialization than in the Navy. You find a much larger variation of ship type and quality among the PDS forces than in the Navy.<br/><br/><br/>Planetary Defense Ground<br/><br/>The PDG is comprised of the various State Armies of the member worlds. They are generally used on their own homeworlds and colonies, though they are sometimes committed to extra-system duties. PDG forces vary in quality and type much more than the SaVaHuTa Army, and are usually deployed in larger formations. The PDGs include forces responsible for air and sea-based operations, like the SaVaHuTa Army.<br/><br/>"}, "133568": {"rpgdesigner": ["Amanda Hamon", "David N.

The universe is set in a &quot;steampunk&quot; world (science fiction in a society similar to Europe of the nineteenth century).<br/><br/>The world is composed of island cities, connected by huge bridges. Apart from these connections and the air (airships and some prototype aircraft for the more adventurous), it is impossible to travel from one city to another, because the rest of the world is covered by an ocean made of a corrosive substance that eats everything except stone and metal, Ecryme.<br/><br/>The society resembles that of Europe at the beginning of the industrial revolution: the means of production are owned by large corporations, companies, and governments (each city is independent) are a mixture of monarchies and democracies. The proletariat has revolutionary restless impulses, and political aspects occupy a significant place in the game. Technology, strictly controlled by the Lodges, is more or less that of the 19th Century, is similar to the novels of Jules Verne.<br/><br/>Additionally, the Ecryme is not just a simple corrosive substance, but seems to have more or less magical properties. And then some people in this world (C&eacute;phales) have strange powers...<br/><br/>The game system is relatively simple. The players distribute points in his six attributes (perception, creation, spirit, liveliness, education, skill) which derived their powers. According to this profile, the player then chooses to increase certain skill sets.<br/><br/>Actions are resolved by introducing a number of D6 (if the action is more difficult, you throw more dice) under the competence score used. The rules are relatively brief, promoting the game at the expense of simulation.<br/><br/>The universe Ecryme is also part of two novels that Mathieu Gaborit published: The Banks of Antipolie (1997, 214 p., ISBN 2-911618-20-3) and Revolutsyia (1997, p 212 .

At the start of play, you receive a number of Province cards at random, then mark your initial positions with town pieces. Shuffle these Province cards with a set of five Initial cards to form your starting deck, then draw a hand of five cards. The game includes 27 Improvement cards, 16 of which are drawn and placed on display; these cards will be drafted during the game.<br/><br/>Mythotopia has nine variable victory point (VP) cards, four of which are drawn at random for a game; place these cards on display with three fixed VP cards, then place a number of VP counters on each card. The fixed VP cards give points for building cities, roads and castles, while the variable ones may change the board situation by adding dragons, runestones and citadels. Alternatively they may grant VPs for controlling a certain number of sea areas, for successfully attacking other players, and for building cities/roads. As these VP cards vary from game to game, they alter the balance between developmental and aggressive play.<br/><br/>On your turn, perform two actions, then refill your hand to five cards. Nine actions are possible, such as buying armies or ships (after starting with six armies and two ships), placing these armies or ships, drafting Improvement cards (for a cost of one gold), placing cards in reserve (to use them on a future turn), permanently removing cards from your deck, using a card for its specific action, and invading a neighboring province. To invade, you must play the Province card from which you attack as well as military cards and food; invading must be the first of your two actions, so if you're placing armies to prepare for an attack, opponents have the chance to prepare defenses.<br/><br/>Three resources are used in Mythotopia: food to feed invading armies, stone to build cities, roads and castles, and gold to buy armies, ships and Improvement cards. Most provinces contain one resource type, and gaining that province gives you that resource. You can turn towns into cities, which increases the number of cards you can keep in your reserve. You can connect provinces with roads, which allows you to substitute one card for another on the same network in addition to moving armies freely between those provinces. Castles increase the defensive value of a province.<br/><br/>All of these constructions (cities, roads, castles) give you victory points, as does taking control of a province. Additional points are available via the VP cards, with you taking VP counters when you meet the condition on a card. For example, building a road gives you two VPs, but if the &quot;Roadside Inns&quot; VP card is in play, then you can expend an extra gold to gain an additional VP. You can lose VPs if you lose control of a province, but you never lose VP counters. The game ends after four of the seven VP cards have been emptied, and the player with the most VPs wins.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": ["English limited edition", "Multilingual first edition"], "name": "Mythotopia", "playingtime": "120", "boardgamemechanic": ["Area Control / Area Influence", "Deck / Pool Building", "Hand Management"], "age": "13", "usersrated": "1240", "boardgamesubdomain": ["Strategy Games"], "average": "6.97036", "boardgamepodcastepisode": ["Cantrip 5: Martin Wallace at Essen Spiel 2014", "Episode 14 - Brass and Martin Wallace", "Episode 2 - Leveling the Playing Feld", "Episode 45 -- All The Pretty Shiny Things", "Episode 95- RobbCon 2017", "Essen 2014 - Martin Wallace", "Planeta de Juegos 29 - Lo que nos espera en Essen 2014", "Podcast #080 - Five in Your Face", "The Game Pit: Episode 38 - The Big Essen 2014 Review"]}, "133633": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1741237.jpg", "poll": [], "boardgamedesigner": ["Michael R.

The Rebel Alliance and their allies have spent time adapting their equipment to Hoth's harsh environment, and these preparations pay off in times of need. While the light side controls more of the planet than its foes, their new Hoth objectives grant them protection from dark side assaults, advantages in edge battles, and other benefits.<br/><br/>Of course, there's a lot more to this first Force Pack than ice and snow!

If the winning configuration hasn't been achieved yet, then the second phase begins, in which pieces can be moved to an adjacent point in any direction.<br/><br/>Capturing: a piece can only be captured if it is on a corner of a triangle and is the only piece an opponent has on that triangle or pair thereof. This means that only one piece can be captured at a time; if a move causes you to corner two of an opponent's pieces nothing happens. A captured piece is replaced with a red one.<br/><br/>Red pieces: once placed, they cannot be moved around, but must remain next to at least one black or white piece.

After playing through the scenarios for the six major characters, Allen's scenario is unlocked. His story reveals the events that lead to KOS-MOS' going out of control. Professor and Assistant Scott cornered Allen and after dubbing him Assistant #2, convinced him to help them install a remote control device on KOS-MOS (who has been named Assistant #3).

This allows two players to compete with each other in eight mini-games.<br/><br/>There are two new arenas to choose from: Grand Tournament, where the player earns extra points for fulfilling specific tasks, and Ultimate Tournament, where the player is given a time limit to finish off the opponents; both arenas can be played by two players. In single player mode, the player can use the new 'Tag Team' system; a player can choose two characters and 'tag' his/her partner anytime and when a tag is made, every time the active character makes a kill, his/her partner will get healed.<br/><br/>When playing in the Unification Mode, Matsunaga Hisahide may be encountered the same way Musashi can be encountered.<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;Sengoku Basara 2&quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "133680": {"poll": [], "name": "Sengoku Basara X", "videogamemode": ["Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["Japanese Arcade edition", "Japanese PlayStation 2 edition"], "average": "0", "videogameseries": ["Sengoku Basara"], "videogametheme": ["Yakuza / Samurai"], "usersrated": "0", "videogamedeveloper": ["Arc System Works Co., Ltd."], "videogamegenre": ["Fighting"], "videogameplatform": ["Arcade", "PlayStation 2"], "statistics": [], "videogamepublisher": ["Capcom Co., Ltd."], "description": "A 2D fighting game by Arc System Works, creators of the Guilty Gear series, made in 2008 for the arcades and ported for the PS2 later the same year.<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;Sengoku Basara&quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "133681": {"poll": [], "name": "Sengoku Basara: Battle Heroes", "videogamemode": ["Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["Japanese PSP edition", "PSP PSN edition"], "average": "0", "videogameseries": ["Sengoku Basara"], "videogametheme": ["Yakuza / Samurai"], "usersrated": "0", "videogamedeveloper": ["Access Games"], "videogamegenre": ["Beat 'em Up"], "videogameplatform": ["PSP"], "statistics": [], "videogamepublisher": ["Capcom Co., Ltd."], "description": "A 2009 PSP-exclusive title.<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;Sengoku Basara&quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "133682": {"poll": [], "name": "Sengoku Basara: Chronicle Heroes", "videogamemode": ["Network Multiplayer", "Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["Japanese PSP edition", "PSP PSN edition"], "average": "0", "videogameseries": ["Sengoku Basara"], "videogametheme": ["Yakuza / Samurai"], "usersrated": "0", "videogamedeveloper": ["Capcom Co., Ltd."], "videogamegenre": ["Action"], "videogameplatform": ["PSP"], "statistics": [], "videogamepublisher": ["Capcom Co., Ltd."], "description": "User Summary<br/><br/>A sequel to the PSP game &quot;Sengoku Basara: Battle Heroes&quot;.

However, this does consumes some of the machine's energy. The machine's energy can be replenished by entering pit areas that can be found on the race course.<br/>In addition to the boost system, the machines can trigger side attacks, similar to F-Zero GX on the Nintendo Gamecube. This allows the player to attack and do damage to other machines, without damaging their own machine.<br/><br/>The game features 34 playable characters, 8 of them are available in Story mode, including newcomer Rick Wheeler (Ryu Suzaku in the Japanese version), the evil Black Shadow, and series hero Captain Falcon.

Boostfire enables the player to both attack enemy players and accelerate slightly faster.<br/><br/>The game contains a a built-in track editor, without the need for an expansion or add-on.

The three seasons were directed by Hattori Kazuyasu and Yoshiaki Kobayashi, and were named Space Sheriff Gavan (\u5b87\u5b99\u5211\u4e8b\u30ae\u30e3\u30d0\u30f3 Uch\u016b Keiji Gyaban, 1982-83), Space Sheriff Sharivan (\u5b87\u5b99\u5211\u4e8b\u30b7\u30e3\u30ea\u30d0\u30f3 Uch\u016b Keiji Shariban, 1983-84) and Space Sheriff Shaider (\u5b87\u5b99\u5211\u4e8b\u30b7\u30e3\u30a4\u30c0\u30fc Uch\u016b Keiji Shaid\u0101, 1984-85). This series helped the Metal Heroes genre to grow popular in Japan in the '80s. The Space Sheriff trilogy was quickly exported in European countries, such as France since 1982 (the series was renamed X-OR), Asia (including Indonesia, Malaysia and most notably Philippines) and Latin America (Brazil). The game was simultaneously released on May 25, 2006 in Japan, Hong Kong and Taiwan. Weekly Famitsu rated it 21/40.<br/><br/>Kenji Ohba and Hiroshi Watari reprised their roles as Gavan and Sharivan, respectively.

The rulesystem is designed for 28mm miniatures but can also be used with 15mm models. Two Hour Wargames's popular Reaction System allows for cross-game compatibility and recreates a sense of chaos and uncertainty in the bleak future; player will never know how each encounter will end as characters act like real humans would in a tense situation, as opposed to how you would like them to act! Each model has only a few stats to keep track of. A typical scenario might see a small band of Stars (the player's models) and Grunts (their fellow survivors) search a town for supplies like food, gas, or ammunition; What they encounter on the streets and in each building is determined randomly and ranges from friendly survivors willling to trade or join the team to hostile Gangers or a horde of hungry Zombies. Where ATZ:FFO really shines though, is the comprehensive campaign system, allowing for character development similar to a role-playing game.

In November 2012, Frontier Developments announced that the game was now named &quot;Elite: Dangerous&quot; [from Elite 4], and would be funded via Kickstarter.<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;Elite: Dangerous,&quot; available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "133761": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1485450.jpg", "poll": [], "boardgamedesigner": ["Carlos Moreno Serrano"], "statistics": [], "yearpublished": "2012", "maxplayers": "5", "boardgameartist": ["Gary Simpson"], "boardgamepublisher": ["HomoLudicus"], "maxplaytime": "40", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1485450_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "40", "boardgamecategory": ["Expansion for Base-game"], "description": "Small expansion released at Essen 2012.<br/><br/>Can be played in two different ways:<br/>- Gives the players a one-shot effect.<br/>- Permanent powers.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "3", "boardgameversion": ["First edition"], "age": "10", "name": "Kalua: God Expansion", "playingtime": "40", "average": "5.2", "boardgameexpansion": [], "usersrated": "5", "boardgamefamily": ["BoardGameGeek Promo Offerings"]}, "133762": {"rpgdesigner": ["James Desborough", "Louis Porter, Jr."], "rpg": ["Pathfinder System Compatible Product"], "poll": [], "name": "The Well of Dead Flesh", "rpgartist": ["Louis Porter, Jr. Design Studio", "Ean Moody", "Yamand\u00fa Daniel Orce", "Carlos Herrera Portilla"], "rpgproducer": ["Louis Porter, Jr. Design Studio"], "usersrated": "0", "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1474872.png", "rpgitemversion": ["PDF version"], "rpgsetting": ["Obsidian Apocalypse"], "average": "0", "statistics": [], "rpggenre": ["Fantasy (High Fantasy)", "Horror (Supernatural)"], "rpgpublisher": ["Louis Porter Jr. Design, Inc."], "rpgcategory": ["Campaign Setting (game world)", "Scenario / Adventure / Module", "Sourcebook (rules/options to enhance play)"], "rpgseries": ["Obsidian Eclipse"], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1474872_t.png", "description": "From publisher blurb:<br/><br/>Obsidian Eclipse is the first of a series of adventure and resource books for the Obsidian Twilight game setting, which is written for the Pathfinder RPG.

The underworld became synonymous with fear, and only with the aid of a powerful, benevolent magician could people rise up against her murderous control.

Bill and Ted can travel to the next timeframe by collecting 16 musical notes, or a phonebook page.<br/>There are different structures in the game that can be entered to collect notes, keys, or other important items that are needed. If the player is touched by an enemy, the character is respawned at the entrypoint of the last building or back at the phonebooth.<br/>One interesting gameplay feature is being able to use different items and instruments to ward off enemies. The player starts with the guitar, and if they collect and switch to a different instrument, the game's music changes to reflect the instrument that is being played.<br/>Another interesting part of the game is the interplay between eras - for instance, when in old Egypt, the player is warned that one of the items they see (the staff) has a false version and a real version. After the player travels to ancient Egypt and finds the staff, then gives it to its owner in old Egypt, they cannot travel to the next destination until they plant the warning. This avoids a time paradox.<br/>Players can save their progress by a unique 16-character password, which represents every part of the game's state.

Straight from the tabloid headlines, these unsolved mysteries, urban legends, and other phenomena are here to be finally solved or debunked by your Investigators.<br/><br/>Assembling your own teams of Paranormal Investigators (or PI's, for short), players must rely on the diverse backgrounds of their PI&rsquo;s to solve a host of strange Case Files. Once solved, these cases can be saved for the end of the game or used to solve larger cases and gain strategic advantages over your opponent.<br/><br/>Players begin the game with only a couple of Investigators and a handful of Paranormal Aid cards. Each PI has their own unique background in various paranormal fields. Certain PI's also have a &quot;Debunk&quot; background, which allows players to attempt to solve a case by debunking it. Paranormal Aids can be used to add a background to a PI or increase it. Players also have the option of using these aids (as well as any solved cases they have) to enlist additional PI's or perform other actions, such as allowing PI's to add their backgrounds through partnering.<br/><br/>Players take turns revealing cases on a Case Files card layout and attempting to solve them. These cases cover many paranormal backgrounds (cryptozoology, unexplained phenomenon, supernatural, extraterrestrial, demonic, and cursed) with five levels for each one. Each level needs the equal and matching background to solve it (for example, a Level 5 Supernatural Case File needs a combined Supernatural background of 5 to solve it). Each level on a Case File also equals the number of points it is worth at the end of the game.<br/><br/>At first, players will only be able to solve a limited number of these cases. But, as they enlist more PI's and use their aids/solved cases, players will slowly be able to solve larger ones. While the larger cases are worth the most towards victory, they also have powerful secondary abilities (like abducting an opponent's PI or stealing one of their solved cases). Players must weigh their options when doing this since cases that have their secondary abilities used are discarded and can't be added to a player's end game total.<br/><br/>The player that does the best job of building their team of Paranormal Investigators and managing the most strategic use of their Paranormal Aids and solved Case Files will end the game with the largest number of combined Case File points and be declared the winner.<br/><br/>"}, "133785": {"poll": [], "name": "Project Torque", "videogamemode": ["Massively Multiplayer"], "videogameversion": ["Windows Downloadable edition"], "average": "0", "videogametheme": ["Driving"], "usersrated": "0", "videogamedeveloper": ["Invictus Games Ltd."], "videogamegenre": ["Racing"], "videogameplatform": ["Windows"], "statistics": [], "videogamepublisher": ["Aeria Games"], "description": "User Summary<br/><br/>Project Torque is a free to play, massively multiplayer online racing game; it is the North American version of the Japanese Level-R.

The Modern Architecture Game, designed by Amsterdam-based NEXTarchitects, lets players test their architectural knowledge, competing for the right to wear Le Corbusier&rsquo;s iconic round-rimmed glasses.<br/><br/>Containing almost a 1000 questions, the Modern Architecture Game provides the base for an evening full of insights in the world's most famous architects, buildings and trends of the Western architecture, all through the roll of a dice. The goal is simple: To reach the heart of the board before anyone else. This is done by moving your way through questions of six different categories: Visuals, Architect, Project, Style, Influence and Quote.<br/><br/>The Modern Architecture Game is the second edition of the architecture game. The first edition was launched on 30 August 1999. It was the first project collaboration involving the four partners at NEXT architects and was distributed in the private environment of Delft University of Technology.<br/><br/>Ten years later, we've produced a revised version of the game, analytically unravelled and improved. This edition is an international version, in the sense that it is produced in English, but also that the questions range right across the breadth of modern world history.<br/><br/>This means that many of the questions about the Netherlands that were abundant in the first version have been dropped, unless they were significant in relation to world-wide developments. By introducing these changes, we have endeavoured to make the game suitable for an extremely broad and international group of architecture enthusiasts.<br/><br/>Test your knowledge of the greatest architects, their famous buildings and legendary quotes.<br/><br/>"}, "133791": {"poll": [], "name": "DCS: P-51D Mustang", "videogamemode": ["Cooperative", "Network Multiplayer", "Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["Windows Downloadable edition"], "average": "8", "videogameseries": ["Digital Combat Simulator"], "videogametheme": ["Flight", "Military", "War - World War II"], "usersrated": "1", "videogameexpansion": ["DCS World"], "videogamedeveloper": ["Eagle Dynamics"], "videogamegenre": ["Flight Simulator"], "videogameplatform": ["Windows"], "statistics": [], "videogamepublisher": ["The Fighter Collection"], "description": "The DCS: P-51D Mustang offers both highly-detailed simulation and easy-to-play &quot;game&quot; mode options for both hardcore and casual gamers.

If destiny is pre-determined, inevitable and unchangeable, is there any hope for we mortals to set our own paths? What of those that seem to be damned by fate, always at the mercy of a higher power? Is there any hope for us at all?<br/><br/>It is rumored that some mortals can choose their own fate by selecting the correct paths as they walk through life. Others think that all of life&rsquo;s events are predestined. There are rumors of those who understand fate&rsquo;s cruel whims and can free themselves and no longer be slaves to that harsh mistress. I can tell you those rumors are true&hellip;<br/><br/>I have lived through perils that would kill even the most steeled warriors. I have slain many a fool that thought to prey upon me. I have danced with fate itself, and taken the lead. What was once my misery is now my salvation, and your damnation. I am an accursed, a doomgiver -- I am a Malefactor. <br/><br/>CLASS DESCRIPTION<br/>Some children begin life cruelly afflicted. Soon after birth, they and their families are beset by random misfortune, injury, and loss. Frequently they are abandoned by their communities for being born under an inauspicious sign, or sacrificed to allay curses seemingly brought down by dark Gods. In reality, the birth of these unfortunates was attended by intangible chaos-spirits known as Yla (EE-la). While the Yla are not inherently evil, they are prone to destruction, and ignorant of the pain and misfortune that they cause those whom they bond with. Sages do not know what causes the Yla to seek out an individual, but as of yet, no known spell or prayer can separate them from their chosen. Many afflicted by these spirits live lives of sorrowful destitution, sometimes taking their own lives in misery.<br/><br/>A choice few however, realize that while their affliction cannot be suppressed, it can be commanded. Whether through study or epiphany, these few learn to channel and command the devious spirits that surround them, turning their hardship into a powerful weapon. These few are known collectively as the Malefactori.<br/><br/>In order to preserve their own lives, they willingly bring misfortune and woe to those around them. They are dangerous to their allies and even more so to their adversaries. A Malefactor that has mastered the ability to transfer his own ill fate to others is truly a dangerous opponent...<br/><br/>This sourcebook comes complete with a killer new class and abilities, archetypes, feats, favored class options and the complete stats for the iconic succubus spawned tiefling on the cover -- Talitha Shadowtongue.<br/><br/>"}, "133805": {"rpgdesigner": ["Rick Cox", "Richard A.

Its contents are compatible with any games that use the OGL system and can be inserted into them in whole or in part.<br/><br/>On this Mars, elegant city-states rise along the banks of world-spanning canals, luxurious airships ply the thin atmosphere, feisty princesses and feckless nobles are menaced by killers of the drear dried-up sea-beds, and skilled swordsmen defend dynasties that have ruled for aeons. Despite both wondrous technology and mysterious mental abilities developed beyond the comprehension of Earthlings, however, the most farsighted of the Martians know that the history of their world is drawing toward its end, and that its life-giving atmosphere and waterways are already sustained only by vast efforts of engineering.<br/><br/>Shadows of a Dying World presents the unique wonders and dangers posed by the weirdly sentient denizens of Burroughs&rsquo; Mars. Creatures covered in Shadows of a Dying World include the Apt, Banth, Calot, Corphal, Great White Ape, Green Martian, Kaldane, Rykor, Plant Man, Silian, Sith, Thoat, Ulsio, and Zitidar.<br/><br/>Other features of this book include guidelines for using Burroughs&rsquo; creatures in both Mars and non-Mars campaign settings, Martian random encounter tables, new Feats, the Class Defense Bonus combat option, and original illustrations by artists Brendan Cass, Sharon Daugherty, William Hazzard II, Amanda Kahl and Geoff Weber.

These factions must work together to overcome the Emperor, but only one will eventually rule the future country. Otherwise, Flaut III suppresses the revolution and retains control...<br/><br/>In Dark Empire: Revolution, each faction consists of a total of 13 cards: three cards with a value of 4-6 and two cards with values 7-8. There are ten additional cards which can be added to the strength of any faction card already in play. The table represents Vindoban, the capital of R`yan, where the emperor deploys his army on one side and the insurgent people gather on the other.<br/><br/>The game is played over a series of turns (&quot;weeks&quot;). After four weeks, a month is completed with an intermediate scoring, and after three months a final scoring ends the game.<br/><br/>Each player starts with a hand of seven cards, one random &ldquo;secret goal&rdquo; faction that the player attempts to guide to victory, and a set of &quot;temporary support&quot; cards. With these cards you secretly &ldquo;bid&rdquo; on the faction you believe will win the next month&rsquo;s scoring by having accumulated the most points.<br/><br/>Gameplay: players simultaneously place one card each in the centre of the table, either towards the revolutionary forces, or as a traitor on the emperor's side adding this value to an &ldquo;Emperor card&rdquo; already placed in that location. This happens three times, but you are only allowed to place one of your three cards as a traitor. The week is then resolved and the player who provided the most support for the strongest faction puts aside one of his cards for this faction to be scored; in addition, this player is immediately awarded 2 extra points. The player who played the highest single card for this faction (not necessarily the same player!) is awarded 1 point. But beware - when the emperor (his card plus all traitors) gained more points than each single faction, the Emperor card is placed to the scoring! The table is cleared and the next week begins. After four weeks, a month is over and an intermediate scoring takes place. If you are correct with your prediction of this month&rsquo;s winner you gain another 6 points.<br/><br/>After three months the final scoring occurs, determining the winner: the &ldquo;secret goals&rdquo; are revealed and the collected points of each player are added to the cards scored for their faction during the course of the game. The faction with the highest score wins the revolution - and the game. But: if the emperor can put down the rebellion - then the faction with the lowest score wins the game. Or, if the winning faction is too far ahead, it is immediately overthrown by all the others and the faction with the second highest score wins the game.<br/><br/>The game is set in the world of the award winning German steampunk graphic novel Steam Noir (&ldquo;Best German Comic Book 2012&rdquo;).

Those recruit cards are included for free in every copy of our Treasure Chest and will be available for purchase through the BGG store.<br/><br/>You find yourself in a dystopian cityscape with a few workers at your disposal to make your mark on the world. Like most people in dystopian fiction, your workers are oblivious to their situation. This world is all they've ever known, and you may use them at your whim.<br/><br/>The world as we know it has ended, and in its place the city of Euphoria has risen. Believing that a new world order is needed to prevent another apocalypse, the Euphorian elite erect high walls around their golden city and promote intellectual equality above all else. Gone are personal freedoms; gone is knowledge of the past. All that matters is the future.<br/><br/>The Euphorians aren&rsquo;t alone. Outside the city are those who experienced the apocalypse firsthand&mdash;they have the memories and scars to prove it. These Wastelanders have cobbled together a society of historians and farmers among the forgotten scrap yards of the past.<br/><br/>There is more to the world than the surface of the earth. Deep underground lies the hidden city of Subterra, occupied by miners, mechanics, and revolutionaries. By keeping their workers in the dark, they&rsquo;ve patched together a network of pipes and sewers, of steam and gears, of hidden passages and secret stairways.<br/><br/>In Euphoria: Build a Better Dystopia, you lead a team of workers (dice) and recruits (cards) to claim ownership of the dystopian world. You will generate commodities, dig tunnels to infiltrate opposing areas, construct markets, collect artifacts, strengthen allegiances, and fulfill secret agendas.<br/><br/>Euphoria is a worker-placement game in which dice are your workers. The number on each die represents a worker's knowledge&mdash;that is, his level of awareness that he's in a dystopia. Worker knowledge enables various bonuses and impacts player interaction. If the collective knowledge of all of your available workers gets too high, one of them might desert you. You also have two elite recruit cards at your disposal; one has pledged allegiance to you, but the other needs some convincing. You can reveal and use the reticent recruit by reaching certain milestones in the game... or by letting other players unwittingly reach those milestones for you.<br/><br/>Your path to victory is paved with the sweat of your workers, the strength of your allegiances, and the tunnels you dig to infiltrate other areas of the world, but the destination is a land grab in the form of area control. You accomplish this by constructing markets that impose harsh restrictions of personal freedoms upon other players, changing the face of the game and opening new paths to victory. You can also focus on gathering artifacts from the old world, objects of leisure that are extremely rare in this utilitarian society. The dystopian elite covet these artifacts&mdash;especially matching pairs&mdash;and are willing to give you tracts of land in exchange for them.<br/><br/>Four distinct societies, each of them waiting for you to rewrite history.

Giant guns protrude from its sides, and lightning leaps from the bores, straddling your aircraft. Wings deftly maneuvers the BE2, and sweeps up and over the top of the Airship but not before a third bolt of lightning tears through the fabric wing. The BE2 tumbles in a flat spin onto the top of the Airship and crumples onto the cold metal of a steel deck for this is no ordinary Airship. There is no time to wait, you and Wings quickly extricate yourselves from the wreckage of your BE2. As the Mystery Airship suddenly turns, the deck tilts and the BE2 slides away threatening to carry you both over the side and into oblivion. Scrambling out of the way, you and Wings cling to the rungs of a nearby ladder as the BE2 slips off and falls away into the darkness. All you can hear now is the wind and the roar of the Airship's engines. There is nothing left to do but climb the ladder, which leads, where? A circular hatch lies before you, Wings turns the latch and opens the hatch, you both climb in and shut it behind you.<br/><br/>This is the Wings Keeton Role Playing Game of High Adventure in the Roaring 20s' As a Hero or Sidekick you defeat dastardly villains, rescue damsels, and  nothing is too fantastic!

The Year is 1924. Assume normal Earth history for anything, unless I specify otherwise. Anyway, the year is 1924. Eight months ago Wells University got a grant from the Society for the Advancement of Mankind (SAM) to put together a certain Antarctic expedition. The professor at Wells University that got this grant was Professor Starkmore, a professor of Geology. This is a risky venture for this day in age when radio communication is new and not very reliable. You see, apparently back in 1922 SAM funded another Antarctic expedition through Boston University, known as the Fielding Expedition. This expedition consisted of 22 men who set out in order to research the geology of the Ross Mountains in central Antarctica, exploring their natural structure and accessing if they have any valuable minerals. For two months everything went well, the Fielding Expedition set out on the ice and arrived at their destination.

The dogs had gone mad in the night. John, who should have been keeping watch was not there. Oh god, why did this have to happen? They found it in the rock. Yes... Look, I haven't much time.

It was released on February 9, 2011 in Europe and April 19, 2011 in North America.<br/><br/>It is a contemporary take on the classic falling block-style puzzle game made famous by such classics as Tetris and Columns. In Mad Blocker Alpha, players can move the blocks horizontally but not vertically and instead must rack up large combinations of blocks, to trigger chains and unlock power ups.<br/><br/>The game's story revolves around a race of creatures called Fluzzle's, who hail from a fictional place called Machu Popyu. Evil creatures called Mokes have infected the world and have turned it into an industrial wasteland. A mysterious stranger entices the Fluzzles to leave Machu Popyu and use their magical, shape morphing to resurrect the long dormant, Great Buhmba, and rejuvenate the lands, thus defating the Mokes. The game features hand drawn cutscenes that guide the player through the game.<br/><br/>Mad Blocker Alpha is a distinct variation on the classic matching genre. In the game you have to match 4 or more of the same coloured blocks together to pop them. Players are encouraged to stack large numbers of blocks, methodically with the intention of triggering large chains. When chains occur a roulette style device at the side of the screen spins and determines whether or not players should be entitled to a power up. The power ups in the game are both negative and positive. The positive blocks include the mad block, which destroys every block that is the same colour as the block it falls upon. The concrete block which destroys everything in a row vertically. The bomb block which explodes in a cross shape and destroys blocks in its path. The negative blocks include the bad blocks, sick green moke blocks that turn an entire row of the players screen to desaturons (or dead blocks) which can only be destroyed with chains.<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;Mad Blocker Alpha&quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "133891": {"poll": [], "name": "Ninjamurai", "videogamemode": ["Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["PlayStation 3/PSP PSN edition"], "average": "0", "videogametheme": ["Ninjas"], "usersrated": "0", "videogamedeveloper": ["Open Emotion Studios Ltd."], "videogamegenre": ["Action", "Platform"], "videogameplatform": ["PlayStation 3", "PSP"], "statistics": [], "videogamepublisher": ["Open Emotion Studios Ltd."], "description": "User Summary<br/><br/>In Ninjamurai, you guide the titular character through multiple enemy filled levels.

'Dang' is a push your luck game played over 10 rounds. At the start of each round, a card is drawn at random, showing a value of between 9 &amp; 22. On a player's turn, they roll 4 dice, trying to maximise the sum of the white pips before the sum of the black pips exceeds the number on the card. Dice with white pips can be rerolled but those with black must be kept. After each throw, the player chooses to either continue rolling or bank their total, so ending their turn. But if the sum of the black pips exceeds the number on the card, they have bust and score nothing for this round. It's a game that can be taught in minutes and takes no more than 30 minutes to play.<br/><br/>But what Dang It Dice also allow you to do is play existing games with them, so creating an interesting slant on the original. For example we've played Yahtzee with them, changing the rules so that dice with black faces count for 2 of that number. Similarly you could play Snakes and Ladders with a single Dang It, moving backwards if the black face falls uppermost. We've also found that they encourage players to invent their own games with them. Thus Dang It Dice are more than just the 15 dice - they are [to coin a well used cliche] a toolkit for your imagination.<br/><br/>"}, "133925": {"poll": [], "name": "Pirateers", "videogamemode": ["Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["Web Browser edition"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1491707.png", "videogameseries": ["Pirateers"], "videogametheme": ["Ocean / Sea", "Pirates"], "usersrated": "0", "videogamedeveloper": ["Labu Games"], "videogamegenre": ["Action", "Shooter"], "videogameplatform": ["Web Browser"], "average": "0", "statistics": [], "videogamepublisher": ["(Web published)"], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1491707_t.png", "description": "User Summary<br/><br/>A nautical themed shooter with lots of upgrades and missions.

The game is being released as part of the 10th anniversary of the Heisei run Kamen Rider Series by Toei, TV Asahi, Ishimori Productions, and Bandai and features heavy tie-ins with the television series Kamen Rider Decade, whose protagonists use cards similar to those used in the game. It is played in a similar fashion to Sega's Mushiking and Dinosaur King games, and uses special Data Cardass cards released by Bandai. The game's card input resembles and functions similarly to the Decadriver in Decade. As the series progresses, the game controls change to suit the new Kamen Rider.

With the current broadcast of Kamen Rider Wizard, Wizard Rings are available to use.<br/><br/>At the start of the game, the player forms his team by scanning two Hero Cards, the first being his main hero and the second being his support, performing extra attacks or shielding the main Rider from attacks as determined by their Guard trait. Alternately, the player can choose to play as Kamen Rider Decade in the form of one of the nine Heisei Kamen Riders by pressing the Belt Button in lieu of scanning a main Hero Card, then scanning a card representing the hero whose form he wishes Decade to use. Compatibility between the two heroes is also an important factor, as more compatible Riders gain bonuses. Before each round, the player performs a Belt Lamp Roulette, which gives further bonuses. During the Slot Phase, the player team and opposing team use a roulette slot system to determine their attacks, which are divided by type (for example, punches, kicks, and weapon attacks) and power. Whichever team has the highest combined value attacks first; in the event of a tie, a Rider Rush occurs, in which both sides must press the buttons rapidly, with the winner automatically performing a Fierce Attack. The Fierce Attack is the Rider's strongest attack on the roulette slot; if one team performs a strong enough attack, it can stun the opponent temporarily, making them lose their turn (assuming they haven't gone already). If either team gets two of the same type of attack icon (for instance, two kicks), the Riders will perform an extra-powerful Double Attack.<br/><br/>The second round and all subsequent rounds allow the use of Special Cards, as well as Memory Change, an ability unique to Kamen Rider Double that lets him change between his many forms. Only one Special Card and one Memory Change can be used per battle (though using one does not preclude the other). As the battle continues, each team builds up Ride Power, shown on the bottom of the screen as a meter. When the meter is 70% full, the team leader can perform his Finishing Move; at 100%, a Double Rider Finisher can be performed. Usually this takes the form of the secondary Rider attacking their opponent to allow the leader to perform his Finishing Move, though some teams of Riders instead perform a Double Rider Kick. During each Finishing Move's animation, the player is prompted to press the belt button at certain moments to increase the damage dealt; if a player is on the receiving end of a CPU opponent's Finishing Move, these prompts will instead reduce damage taken. Sometimes, thanks to proper support from the secondary Rider, a team may receive Rider Guts when knocked out, restoring some health and allowing them to continue fighting. Play proceeds until one team is defeated; if a battle continues for four or five rounds without a clear winner, the game may declare a Final Round, introducing a Sudden Death element by reducing both teams to 1 Hit Point but filling their Rider Power to 100%, meaning the first team to land a successful attack wins.<br/><br/>Some Riders receive unique bonuses when first used. For example, Decade Complete Form has Complete Scan, wherein the player is prompted to scan as many Hero Cards as possible within ten seconds, receiving a bonus based on how many unique cards were inputted. If the player uses Memory Change to transform into Double CycloneJoker Xtreme, he receives an Xtreme Chance, a roulette bonus similar to the Belt Lamp Roulette with four separate bonuses determined by which Gaia Memories are placed into the Prism Bicker.<br/><br/>In Single Player, a player who performs well may receive a special EX Stage in which he faces a much stronger team. A player who performs exceptionally well may receive a Hyper EX Stage where he faces an incredibly strong team, made up of characters who are not available to players in the current upgrade (but will be included in the next expansion). Unlike normal play, if the player loses during an EX or Hyper EX Stage, there is no option to continue.<br/><br/>As of the change to the Kamen Rider Wizard-based interface, the game system has undergone several changes. First, the rock-paper-scissors aspect has been removed, and Riders are now categorized into types, the current ones being Fire, Water, Wind, Earth, Space, and Multi, with Thunder and Mecha to be included in the next phase of cards. It also introduced IC Cards, which allow players to have a game save, and progress through various battle stages. With the IC Cards came a leveling system, wherein winning battles with a rider from the with a specific type will level up that type. The levels not only affect the stats of the riders, but also determine their special attacks, as now Hero Cards have different special attacks depending on what level their type is. Additionally, Special Cards have have been removed from the game system, their purpose now being relegated to Battle Supporters who can be gained by winning battles against opponents who have them in the IC Card stages.<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;Kamen Rider Battle: Ganbaride&quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "133927": {"poll": [], "name": "Super Sentai Battle: Dice-O", "videogamemode": ["Local Multiplayer", "Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["JP Arcade edition"], "average": "0", "videogametheme": ["Superhero"], "usersrated": "0", "videogamedeveloper": ["Bandai"], "videogamegenre": ["Action", "Fighting"], "videogameplatform": ["Arcade"], "statistics": [], "videogamepublisher": ["Bandai"], "description": "Super Sentai Battle: Dice-O (\u30b9\u30fc\u30d1\u30fc\u6226\u968a\u30d0\u30c8\u30eb \u30c0\u30a4\u30b9\u30aa\u30fc S\u016bp\u0101 Sentai Batoru: Daisu\u014d) is a combination arcade game and collectible card game featuring the characters of the Super Sentai Series.

Armies consist of units that range from a wide range of factions, including circus performers, fairies and the undead.<br/><br/>The game begins with an always changing battlefield and a win/lose condition being selected, such as last one standing or capture the flag. Players then take their fully customized armies and deploy their units one at a time, alternating players between each unit to ensure both offensive and defensive lineups. When the deploy is completed, players alternate activating each of their units, moving and attacking, to try to reach the win condition.<br/><br/>Each unit has their own critical stats, such as Attack value, Defensive value, movement value, attack grids and inherent powers. To stop overpowered armies, associated costs are also attached to each unit to put a cap on army limits. Strategy doesn't lie in the most powerful units, it lies in picking the right units for your army and how to position them best counter your opponent's strategies.<br/><br/>Ultimately, he idea behind Rumble Tactics is a tactics strategy game that is affordable, portable, and customizable.<br/><br/>AFFORDABILITY: the game in its core is and will always be free to play by making it &quot;print and play&quot;. If fancier cards and tokens are requested, for example, DIY solutions are available.<br/><br/>PORTABLE: The Unit Tokens are 1&quot; in size and a standard battlefield is no larger than a piece of 8.5 x 11 paper. With the addition of a handful of Unit Cards and d6, you've got a game that you can take anywhere and play at even the smallest of restaurant tables.<br/><br/>CUSTOMIZABLE: Through both the BGG site and Rumble Tactics site, all of the rules, cards, and tokens will be available in many graphic formats so players can create their own units. Want an army full of cows that shoot lasers? Why not. As long as you and your friends/opponents agree on the units, the possibilities are endless.  There's even a handy spreadsheet to input values (attack, defense, etc.) that will calculate the COST of each unit, making it as fair as possible.<br/><br/>Come join the fun and fill the ranks of Rumble Tactics!<br/><br/>"}, "133949": {"rpgdesigner": ["Epidiah Ravachol"], "rpgitemversion": ["PDF Version"], "statistics": [], "name": "Spaceknights", "rpgartist": ["Epidiah Ravachol"], "rpgproducer": ["Epidiah Ravachol"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2324734.png", "usersrated": "0", "average": "0", "rpggenre": ["Science Fiction"], "rpgpublisher": ["Dig a Thousand Holes Publishing"], "rpg": ["Spaceknights"], "rpgcategory": ["Core Rules (min needed to play)"], "poll": [], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2324734_t.png", "description": "User summary:<br/><br/>An interplanetary game of chivalry for 6 players.

The armies marched off to war in appearance and manner akin to distant cousins of the Napoleonic Period, with many units dressed in colorful uniforms and trained to fight in dense formations. Commanders of the day stressed the operational art of war. Battles were fought on the grand scale of million-man armies where it was thought that tactical issues were of minimal importance since it was rationalized that tactical success or failure would be negated by bypass and maneuver at the operational level.<br/><br/>Four years later, with over 10 million dead and Europe in complete ruin, over a thousand miles of trenches had been dug and poison gas, light machine guns, tanks, aircraft, and modern artillery, had all came into existence. This &quot;First World War&quot; had become the genesis of modern warfare, seeing innovative developments in weaponry and tactics as both sides raced to develop tools and techniques in the quest to break the deadlock that dominated the war's main arena: the Western Front. However, one of the most important innovations born out of this conflict was not a specific piece of weaponry, it was a change in the tactical mindset of commanders: the introduction of small unit tactics, or squad level warfare. Ironically, it was the evolution at the tactical level that finally brought about a strategic result to the conflict.<br/><br/>Squad Battles: First World War allows you to experience the technical and tactical advancements of that conflict, and the terrible battles that were carried out.

A ruler can also be useful if you want. You are not the coach, but a spectator which attends the game and watches its development and the stats accumulating in a very realistic manner.<br/>There is a BASIC GAME, very simple and fast to play, and an ADVANCED GAME, which allows you to choose the statistical detail you desire, by giving you the possibility to keep track of minutes played by each player, blocks, steals, disqualifications, team possessions and the chance to use special playoffs rules. You should have more time to play if you desire more detail, but after learning the very simple mechanism, you will be able to play an entire game in about 30 minutes while keeping every kind of individual stats. Regular Season Basketball is ideal to replay a whole season, since actual games played by each player are also recreated by consulting the &ldquo;Rest Chart&rdquo; at the beginning of the game. So, no boring dice rolls before the game just to determine which player will play, no setup time involved; players will populate the scoresheet as soon as they are called in action by the chart. Also do not ask about how to resolve the opening tip-off. This is a segment by segment game, not a possessions game.<br/><br/>Every single game is played through several segments, each one representing three minutes of real play. In each segment, both teams roll two dice once to determine scores and stats; after four segments a quarter of 12 minutes will be over. To complete an NBA game, 16 dice rolls are required by each team. For an NCAA game the time scale is different with each die roll representing four minutes and 10 total rolls necessary to complete a game. When a tie game occurs, an overtime is played by rolling the dice once more for each team, this being the only case in which a segment represents five minutes instead of three.<br/><br/>You will never lose the feeling of the game because alternating the dice rolls between the two teams you have the score for each three minutes of play, catching the drama of a close game, realizing &quot;garbage time&quot; situations, big come-backs and the influence of the home court advantage very strong specially in the final minutes of a game.<br/><br/>"}, "133970": {"rpgartist": ["Kayla Mayer"], "rpgitemversion": ["PDF Version", "Softcover Version"], "statistics": [], "name": "The Tulip Academy's Society for Dangerous Gentlemen", "rpgdesigner": ["Nick Smith (I)"], "rpgproducer": ["(Uncredited)"], "rpg": ["The Tulip Academy's Society for Dangerous Gentlemen"], "usersrated": "0", "rpggenre": ["Action / Adventure", "Animation / Comics (Anime / Manga)", "Childhood", "Weird / Surreal"], "rpgpublisher": ["Atarashi Games", "Cel*Style"], "rpgcategory": ["Core Rules (min needed to play)"], "poll": [], "average": "0", "description": "From the introduction:<br/>The Tulip Academy&rsquo;s Society for Dangerous Gentlemen is a role-playing game for 3-6 people.

As with most old games the exact rules passed on over time are not exactly clear. Variants described here are usually taken from Internet or book sources mentioned or as found, played and explained by word of mouth on mediaeval LARP conventions. The game is assumed to be derived from or match the family of Alquerque.<br/><br/>Mentioned web sites or references claim Qero to be an ancient mediaeval game of unknown source. Thus on the one hand unfortunately no game author can be listed and on the other hand it should not have any legal restrictions, trademarks, patents, or utility patterns in place. The game is in the public domain.<br/><br/>Mostly Qero is played without any specific line patterns shown on board (in contrast to Alquerque). If a line pattern is shown on the board players may agree on performing moves on each direction of lines shown by the pattern only. Thus moves are allowed along the lines only. Otherwise rules might allow horizontal and vertical moves only. By agreement diagonal moves in any direction could be performed as well. Although the later seems to be quite uncommon.<br/><br/>Variant 1: Started on an empty board the players set up all their pieces first. Players' pieces are facing up their own symbol or color. The pieces are placed onto the remaining free positions of the board in alternating game play. Thus if no player achieved a winning situation during this board set up phase then the first player ends up with 13 gaming pieces set and the second player set 12 gaming pieces of own color.<br/><br/>Up to that point it is a typical 5-in-a-row variant like tic-tac-toe, Renju, Pente, or Go-Moku without any kind of capturing. After this set up phase game play changes although the goal is still to build a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row of five of your pieces. After set up phase take a piece of your color off the chosen edge position and place it back on the board shifting the other pieces filling up the newly formed gap (from the end of an incomplete row or column of your choice). Like in Quixo... Probably just gut feeling: There seem to be less draw situations in direct comparison to Quixo (assumed experienced players really try to achieve winning the game).<br/><br/>In this Qero variant the amount of pieces on board controlled by the player is fixed after the initial set up phase. So you could simply use some two sided game pieces (Othello/Reversi) or even simple pawns (e.g. 13 white plus 12 black pawns w/ white starting the game) and start playing on any 5 times 5 board as well.<br/><br/>Variant 2: Started on an empty board the players set up all their pieces first. Players' pieces are facing up their own symbol or color. The pieces are placed onto the remaining free positions of the board in alternating game play. Each player sets up 12 pieces of own color if no player achieved a winning situation during this board set up phase. One board position remains empty.<br/><br/>Up to that point it is a typical 5-in-a-row variant, too. There is no kind of capturing opponent's gaming pieces. After this set up phase game play changes although the goal is still to build a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row of five of your own pieces. The game continues and a player's turn consists in chosing any type of gaming piece may it be own or opponent's from the edge positioned in direct straight line towards the board position left empty. From the chosen board position push all pieces in between in straight line so the chosen position is the new empty position.<br/><br/>Variant 3: At start of game on all but one board position a die is placed with none symbol facing or a symbol indicating a neutral field not owned by any player. The dice has to show various faces (one with a number or symbol for the first player, another for the second player and finally one for indicating neutral positions). Compared to previous variants there is no set up phase.<br/><br/>A player's turn consists in selecting a die showing an empty or own symbol from the edge. If this die is showing an empty face it turns to show the face with the player's symbol now. The selected die has to be positioned in direct straight line towards the board position left empty. Otherwise it can not be selected. From the chosen board position push all pieces in between in straight line so the chosen position is the new empty position. Again the goal is still to build a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row of five of your own pieces.<br/><br/>Obviously a fourth variant could be introduced similiar to the one before allowing to chose any (not just own or empty) die from the edge instead.<br/><br/>Variant 2 is most-likely targeted and described in German in &quot;Allerley Spielerey - Spielen wie im Mittelalter&quot;, Gisela Muhr and Eleonore Sieck, ISBN 978-3-939722-38-0, p.118, 2011, published by Regionalia. The book includes only an abstract description how the authors interprete to push a chosen stone from the edge (is it allowed to use own color only or could the opponent's color be chosen as well?) to the empty position exactly.<br/><br/>"}, "133979": {"rpgdesigner": ["Kirin Robinson", "Jack W.
