Someone who fulfills one of their absurd requests can force the creature to use its divinatory powers on their behalf, receiving an answer direct from the cosmos.

She has discovered a new breed of extremely unstable, highly volatile microorganisms, BIOTIX&trade; (patent pending and pronounced &lsquo;biotics&rsquo;) that can uneasily coexist within a small system. Now she needs supporting data. But science can be a brutally competitive field.  What began as an innocent pursuit of discovery has quickly devolved into self-centered posturing and ruthless backstabbing among her lab personnel, all vying to have their name attached to the research paper, thereby rocketing them you into scientific superstardom.<br/><br/>Your mission, carefully grow the largest culture of BIOTIX you can in your petri dish &ndash; and sabotage the work of others by pushing their microbe populations above their limit, causing them to explode and bio-react in all sorts of fun ways.  Game play is simple: on your turn, draw two BIOTIX from the specimen bag and place them, one at a time, either into your own dish for points or into an opponent&rsquo;s dish to try and force a bio-reaction to destroy their work.<br/><br/>Each of the five BIOTIX species has a different trigger number and a unique bio-reaction when they &lsquo;go off&rsquo;. It may force you to trash the microbes, force microbes from your dish into the petri dishes of others, steal microbes or wipe out a species across the whole table. The BIOTIX are in a constant state of flux throughout the game, as is your score, because at the end of the day you gain points for the BIOTIX remaining in your dish, with the most volatile BIOTIX being worth the most points.<br/><br/>The best score over 3 days of research determines the winner!

The more faces they roll, the better they fight the fire. Players can choose to cut firebreaks, which protect tiles from embers blown by wind gusts, or push their luck to reduce flames and possibly even generate reward tokens. If players bust and fail to match at least three of the six symbols on the tile, the fire grows. Another option is to maneuver vehicles &mdash; air tanker, helicopter, and brush rig &mdash; to save the forest.<br/><br/>Flame tokens are added at the end of each player's turn by the draw of a fire card, which can bring about light or strong wind gusts, increase the strength of the flames on certain tiles, and start fires. Too many flame tokens will cause a tile to scorch and be lost. Losing a terrain tile could also affect the game play. Some tiles are tied to crewmembers' special abilities, while others help the firefighters, and still others cause the fire to spread in unique ways. If eight tiles scorch or the fire camp scorches, the game is over and the forest is lost &mdash; but if the intrepid crew can extinguish the fire, the team wins together.<br/><br/>The press-your-luck mechanism with ratcheting rewards creates tension, and the variety of ways to fight the fire makes for interesting choices. The modular tile layout and fire cards bring high replayability to the game, and the acrylic flame tokens provide an enticing table presence.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "1", "boardgameversion": ["English first edition"], "name": "Hotshots", "playingtime": "60", "boardgamemechanic": ["Modular Board", "Press Your Luck"], "average": "6", "boardgameexpansion": ["218051"], "usersrated": "1", "age": "10", "boardgamepodcastepisode": ["WTG7 - What The Geek?!

There also are six D6, marked with the starting letters of the six brands. The board is divided radially into 16 spaces, each with the call letters and city of a major radio station.<br/><br/>The first game is a simple roll-and-move affair. Each player gets a small metal radio horn or &quot;loud speaker&quot;. All the dice are thrown at once, and each player moves ahead as often as his or her starting letter shows up. First player to complete the circuit wins.<br/><br/>The rules booklet also suggests a second game called Toon-In Radio Golf. This requires an actual radio set as well as a copy of the game for each player. Players have to use their radios to try to tune in each of the game's stations in turn, waiting until an announcement of the call letters to verify that he has it right. The first person to successfully tune in all of the stations wins.<br/><br/>The game includes the call letters, city, wavelength and power of each signal. (Even the biggest stations used only 1,000 watts!)

Most players will step into the shoes of LAPD homicide detectives, hungry for glory and willing to do whatever it takes to successfully close a case, even if that means intimidating suspects, concealing evidence, and hiring snitches to rat on their fellow detectives. One player, however, will take on the role of The Chisel, whose only goal is to stall and misdirect the detectives at every turn using bluffing, manipulation, and (often) outright lies.<br/><br/>Detective: CoA uses the innovative ARC (Adaptive Response Card) System to create the feel of interrogating a suspect. Suspects do not simply give paragraph-book responses; instead The Chisel carefully chooses how they will answer. When Billy O'Shea insists that the victim was a regular at Topsy's Nightclub, is he telling the truth or is The Chisel subtly leading the detectives toward a dead end that will cost them precious time? Detectives can challenge responses that they think are lies but at great risk: If they're wrong, The Chisel will acquire leverage over them, making the case that much harder to solve.<br/><br/>Detective: CoA includes separate, detailed casebooks for both the detectives and The Chisel. Each crime is a carefully constructed puzzle that can unfold in a variety of ways depending on how the detectives choose to pursue their investigations. As the detectives turn the city upside down, uncovering fresh evidence and &quot;hot&quot; leads, hidden suspects may be revealed and new lines of questioning will open up, creating a rich, story-driven experience.<br/><br/>Inspired by classic film noir like The Big Sleep, the works of James Ellroy (L.A. Confidential), and the video game L.A. Noire from Rockstar Games, Detective: City of Angels is a murder-mystery game unlike any other. Will one detective rise above the rest and close the case on L.A.'s latest high profile murder? Or will The Chisel sow enough doubt and confusion to prevent the detectives from solving the crime?<br/><br/>"}, "218075": {"rpgartist": ["(Uncredited)"], "rpgitemversion": ["PDF version"], "poll": [], "name": "The Guns of ak-Guurien", "rpgdesigner": ["Michael Brown (I)"], "rpgproducer": ["Michael Brown (I)"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3342138.jpg", "usersrated": "0", "average": "0", "statistics": [], "rpg": ["Cepheus Engine System", "Traveller (Mongoose)"], "rpgpublisher": ["(Web published)"], "rpgcategory": ["Scenario / Adventure / Module"], "rpggenre": ["Science Fiction"], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3342138_t.jpg", "description": "From publisher blurb:<br/><br/>The heroes find unexpected danger when they&rsquo;re hired to survey ancient ruins in a war zone.<br/><br/>The Guns of ak-Guurien is a one-page, no-frills adventure for tabletop RPG science fiction games using a 2D6 mechanic (including The Original 2D6 Science Fiction Game), starring characters of varied career backgrounds.<br/><br/>"}, "218076": {"rpgartist": ["(Uncredited)"], "rpgitemversion": ["PDF version"], "poll": [], "name": "The Instruments of Darkness", "rpgdesigner": ["Michael Brown (I)"], "rpgproducer": ["Michael Brown (I)"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3342135.jpg", "usersrated": "0", "average": "0", "statistics": [], "rpg": ["Cepheus Engine System", "Traveller (Mongoose)"], "rpgpublisher": ["(Web published)"], "rpgcategory": ["Scenario / Adventure / Module"], "rpggenre": ["Science Fiction"], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3342135_t.jpg", "description": "From publisher blurb:<br/><br/>A request to evict squatters from a celebrity&rsquo;s land brings to light horrific events from 15 years prior.

Throughout the story the protagonist must overcome obstacles to finally be together with their one true love and live happily ever after.<br/><br/>Examples of the romance plot include Cyrano de Bergerac, Pride and Prejudice, The Time Traveler&rsquo;s Wife, Tristan and Isolde, and Wuthering Heights.<br/><br/>Story Design: The Romance covers all of the elements you need to prepare in order to tell a love story. It's based on concepts explored in Story Structure for Writers and Roleplayers, also published by Dancing Light Press.

The material in this book is set in Sindal Subsector of the Third Imperium universe, but can be easily transplanted to other regions or any game setting that follows the general standards and assumptions of the Third Imperium.<br/><br/>The Torpol Cluster is the name given to three worlds in Tlaiowaha subsector which all lie within jump-1 of one another. Three worlds is a small cluster, but these three are important as they provide a link between the Wildeman Cluster and the Sindalian Main (by way of Marduk), which permits jump-2 traffic to transit from Imperial space to the territory of the Florian League.<br/><br/>Traffic bound for the Aslan Hierate also comes through these systems as an alternative to the Wildeman Cluster/Borderland Cluster transit.<br/><br/>The cluster sees a fair amount of internal trade, with ships plying between ports in the same system or jumping within the cluster. Through trade is extensive, with Torpol acting as a stopover and liberty port for many ships that come through. The cluster might thus offer rich pickings for pirates, though the presence of an Imperial trade route makes this a potentially hazardous undertaking.<br/><br/>"}, "218144": {"rpgdesigner": ["Martin Dougherty"], "rpgitemversion": ["PDF version"], "statistics": [], "name": "Pirates of Drinax: The Theev Cluster", "rpgartist": ["Amy Perret", "Sandrine Thirache"], "rpgproducer": ["William J.

The game is introduced by means of a mysterious letter which informs the reader that they must lead a team of courageous people to fight back against the malevolent forces that threaten to overtake Barchester. The game can be played with basic rules or with a host of tactical rules as player&rsquo;s become used to the flow of the game. A player can play a solitaire game where they control the Protagonists with the aim of banishing the Monsters to claim victory (the Monster being played by A.I. mechanics in the game). Alternatively a 2 player game can be played where one side takes control of the Protagonists and the other side the Monsters. Both sides choose a starting team of 15 from their decks; each card has 4 attribute statistics. Each turn take place at a different location, which may allow counters to be played or benefits to accrue. The Protagonist cards can be equipped with Boon cards that can be found at the various locations. The turn has 4 phases: organise, initiate, engage and resolve. The Protagonist and Monster players take alternate turns to hold the location and decide the type of encounter, which is kept secret from their opponent. The responding player must try and guess what strategy is being used and play their hand accordingly. The controlling player can see the card images but not the statistics, so uses their knowledge to try and play the best cards to win the encounter. The cards are then revealed and the statistics compared. An encounter table is consulted to determine the outcomes. The Monster cards can also be played as a stand-alone trump-style game, &ldquo;Monsters &amp; Miscreants.&rdquo;<br/><br/>"}, "218168": {"rpgartist": ["(Uncredited)"], "rpgitemversion": ["DOCX Version"], "poll": [], "name": "Assault on Mistamere", "rpgdesigner": ["Adrien Provis"], "rpgproducer": ["Adrien Provis"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3348593.jpg", "usersrated": "0", "average": "0", "statistics": [], "rpg": ["Basic D&D Compatible Product"], "rpgpublisher": ["(Web published)"], "rpgcategory": ["Scenario / Adventure / Module"], "rpggenre": ["Fantasy (High Fantasy)"], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3348593_t.jpg", "description": "Hunting Down Bargle the Infamous<br/><br/>From the introduction:<br/><br/>This module was written...as the continuation for the introductory adventure presented in Dungeons & Dragons Set 1: Basic Rules.<br/><br/>For characters levels 1-3.<br/><br/>"}, "218169": {"rpgartist": ["(Uncredited)"], "rpg": ["Pathfinder System Compatible Product"], "statistics": [], "name": "The Veiled Society (Pathfinder)", "rpgdesigner": ["Joaqu\u00edn Menchaca"], "rpgproducer": ["Joaqu\u00edn Menchaca"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3348606.jpg", "usersrated": "0", "rpgitemversion": ["PDF Version"], "average": "0", "rpggenre": ["Fantasy (High Fantasy)"], "rpgpublisher": ["(Web published)"], "rpgcategory": ["Scenario / Adventure / Module"], "poll": [], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3348606_t.jpg", "description": "User summary:<br/><br/>This document provides a conversion of B6: The Veiled Society to Pathfinder Roleplaying Game.

There were two reasons for the Government to do this: one was to collect battle data through the experimental battles, and the other was as an easy way to dispose such troublesome people.<br/><br/>Dokugasu Zangousen is a three-dimensional chess-like board game. In a 7x7 square grid board, you may make a hump (place a cube) or dig an entrenchment (remove a cube) to avoid lines of fire or to hinder enemy's movement. But entrenchment is vulnerable to poison gas which tends to go downward into holes.<br/><br/>Players initially have two soldiers each. At the beginning of each round, players place two action cards face-down in front of them. Then first player takes all actions they have placed.<br/><br/>During your turn, you may do two of the following  actions as you have programmed:<br/>1) Move: Move one of your soldiers one square orthogonally, or advance the soldier two squares forward.<br/><br/>2) Turn: Turn the direction of one of your soldiers.<br/><br/>3) Construct: Place a cube on a square adjacent to one of your soldiers. Or remove a cube from in front of the soldier.<br/><br/>4) Fire: Fire a gun from one of your soldiers orthogonally to kill an enemy or destroy a cube. Or throw a bag of poison gas to kill soldiers within an affected area, which is determined by wind direction.<br/><br/>5) Dig: Dig an entrenchment at the exact square of one of your soldiers.<br/><br/>6) Item: One of your soldier wears or takes off a gas mask. While wearing the mask, the soldier gains protection from poison but is unable to advance two squares, construct, or move cubes. Or one of your soldier takes a drug for two extra actions.<br/><br/>7) Camp: Retrieve one or all action cards you have played so far.<br/><br/>You score one point when you kill one of your enemies, or when you move one of your soldier outside the board across the opponent's border.

Man-Eating House is a trick taking game for 3-4 players with a theme of haunted house.<br/><br/>This game uses a deck of 44 cards, which consists of three suits (Green, Yellow, Red), and 14 ranks (1-14), plus Green 0 (Dog) and Red 15 (Old Man). Cards ranked 1-3 (with a child figure on the card), ranked 12-14 (ghost figure on the card), Dog, and Old Man are honor cards. You score points by taking these cards.<br/><br/>Each round, players play a card under trick-taking rules (must follow suit, no trumps). Basically, the player who played the highest rank, regardless of which suit, wins the trick. But there are several exceptions.

Since most people who use it are able to buy the mineral when its available this could be the work of some twisted mage or druid. Who is stealing the chrysarium? Why do they need so much when only fairly small amounts are required to power the Builder devices we've seen? Why would they steal unrefined chrysarium - it would be better to wait until it was usable, right?

The first deck is the Objectives deck. These cards are places and events that the players must collect before they accumulate in the &ldquo;War Weariness&rdquo; pool. Objectives are guarded by a number of NVA cards as designated by the NVA score on the Objective card. Each Objective card also has a Value. This is the number of points the players receive when they take the objective. NVA cards are the second deck and represent the North Vietnam Army. These cards come in different strengths and have varying abilities. The last deck is the Free World deck. These cards are dealt to the players face down and represent the resources they have to take objectives and affect the War Weariness pool. Players may not share or expose their hands to other players during the course of the game.<br/><br/>Setup<br/><br/>Shuffle each deck separately and then deal out a number of Free World cards face down to each player as determined by figure 1 (Number of players). Play starts with the player to the left of the dealer and moves clockwise around the table.<br/><br/>Sequence of play<br/><br/>When a players turn starts they draw one Free World card. If the player has less than their starting hand in Free World cards they draw up to their starting card total instead. Once the player has drawn their cards, the top Objectives card is turned over and placed in the middle of the playing field. This is mandatory and will always happen each players turn. This is the War Weariness pool. The player now has the option of attempting to take the objective (see combat) or take an additional Free World card and pass his turn to the player to his left. If you do nothing in your turn you can always draw one Free World card and this can bring your total cards above your starting hand size. There is no upper limit on the number of cards you can have in your hand.<br/><br/>Combat<br/><br/>When a player decides they are going to take an objective they deal out a number of NVA cards equal to the NVA score on the Objective card face down. Starting with the attacking player, each player &ldquo;bids&rdquo; the cards they will use in the attack by placing them face down in front of themselves. Once all players have bid their cards, the player cards are revealed and then the first NVA card in line is revealed. Add up the strength value of all exposed NVA cards each reveal phase and compare it to the total of the Free World card strength. If the NVA total is double the total strength of all the exposed Free World bid cards, the objective is overrun and lost (See losing combat). If the total is not double the attackers strength and there are more NVA cards to be revealed, the players go around again bidding more cards for the next reveal phase. This continues until all NVA cards involved in the battle are face up. If the attacking players have a higher total Strength than the strength total of all NVA cards in play then they win the objective and it is placed to the side. If there are four or more players, the attacking player now draws a number of Free World cards equal to the NVA value on the Objective that was just secured and can now give them to the other players as reinforcements. The player may only keep one card for himself and he may not look at any of the cards being distributed. This may take the player over his starting hand limit. He may then attempt to take another objective or end his turn. If an attack is declared and the players feel they can&rsquo;t take the objective they can call off the attack but the player that called the attack must discard his entire hand and his turn ends. The objective is treated as if the players lost combat.<br/><br/>Losing combat<br/><br/>Should the players be defeated by the NVA, the objective is placed back in the War Weariness pool and a token is placed on the card. Objectives that have tokens on them add one to the NVA value for each token on the card. This is cumulative with any other effect in the game<br/><br/>War weariness<br/><br/>As the game progresses, cards will begin to build up in the War Weariness pool. The more cards in the War Weariness pool the more difficult it will be to take objectives. Starting with the third card in the War Weariness pool, add one to the NVA score for every Objective card. Once you have six cards in the War Weariness pool you add one more and finally when there is nine cards in the War Weariness pool you add one more for a total of +3 to the NVA score on all Objective cards. If a duplicate Objective card is added to the War Weariness pool it is shuffled back in to the deck and a token is added to the original card in the War Weariness pool instead.<br/><br/>Ending the game<br/><br/>If there are 10 cards in the War Weariness pool at the end of any players turn the game wins. The players win if they accumulate a total of ten points per player, 15 in a single player game. (IE a 4 player game needs to get 40 points in Objectives). The player that initiates the attack keeps the points of the objective if the players win the objective. The player with the most points when the players win is deemed the winner of the game. Note that if the game wins, no one wins.<br/><br/>"}, "218281": {"boardgamedesigner": ["Charles Vasey"], "poll": [], "name": "B1704", "playingtime": "120", "minplayers": "1", "yearpublished": "2016", "usersrated": "0", "maxplayers": "2", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3534387_t.jpg", "average": "0", "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["(Self-Published)"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3534387.jpg", "boardgameversion": ["First edition"], "maxplaytime": "120", "boardgamecategory": ["Age of Reason", "Wargame"], "age": "0", "minplaytime": "60", "description": "Using the same chassis as W1815 this game covers the battle of Blenheim 1704.<br/><br/>The game seeks to demonstrate the importance to the Franco-Bavarians of holding the line of villages so as to outflank Allied attacks between them.

A beautiful yet alien world. Until six hundred years ago it was the home of an unimaginably advanced alien species, poised in splendid isolation on the brink of transcendence, refusing even to communicate with the lesser intelligences which had colonised its planetary twin. That&rsquo;d be us&mdash;homo variens, the diverse and curious descendants of the colonists from Old Earth. Even our probes and telescopes were deflected, leaving us with tantalising glimpses of wonders beyond our ability to understand.<br/><br/>Then, six hundred years ago, the alien civilisation fell. Almost overnight: the lights on the surface of the planet Blue went out, the aliens&rsquo; structures seemed to dissolve, and the barrier which had protected them from prying eyes for millennia collapsed. But where had they all gone? Amid magnificent ruins we found devolved life forms, as confused and as uncomprehending as we.<br/><br/>None of us ever knew what had been lost. Until now. Now the Blues are back&mdash;and no one knows if even the Commonality can resist them. Let&rsquo;s hope they want to be friends&hellip;<br/><br/>There&rsquo;s been a murder on the fallen world of Blue, a planet of ragtag survivors and curious human colonists researching the remains of a near-transcendent alien civilisation. But the culprit is stranger than anyone had imagined; and, as factions manoeuvre for influence and control, a mystery is uncovered which threatens to change the Commonality forever!<br/><br/>BLUE includes:<br/><br/>    Two whole alien worlds: maps, ecosystems, exointelligences, cultures, and more;<br/>    A multi-session adventure of intrigue, conspiracy, and mystery spanning an entire star system;<br/>    Secrets of the Commonality and the Mindjammer setting!<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>"}, "218498": {"boardgamedesigner": ["Alessio Cavatore"], "poll": [], "name": "Jim Henson's Labyrinth: The Board Game \u2013 Goblins!", "playingtime": "0", "minplayers": "1", "boardgamemechanic": ["Co-operative Play", "Roll / Spin and Move", "Time Track"], "yearpublished": "2017", "boardgameexpansion": [], "usersrated": "0", "maxplayers": "5", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3387071_t.jpg", "average": "0", "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["River Horse Ltd."], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3387071.jpg", "boardgameversion": ["Goblins!"], "maxplaytime": "0", "boardgamecategory": ["Adventure", "Movies / TV / Radio theme"], "age": "6", "minplaytime": "0", "description": "Goblins! is an expansion for Jim Henson's Labyrinth: The Board Game.<br/><br/>When you open the box you will find five beautifully sculpted miniatures and 5 cards that can be added into the deck to change the Labyrinth game.<br/><br/>From here on in you will have two choices, either you can forge on as before using the new models to replace the standees that come with the Labyrinth game, making your Labyrinth experience more immersive but not changing any rules.
