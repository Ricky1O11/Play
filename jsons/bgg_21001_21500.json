In the box there are the numbered tiles.<br/><br/>Start the DVD an choose from the menu which variant you want to play.<br/>In the classic mode, the screen shows the startposition. Or you can choose a variant where only the numbers 1 to 9 are placed once.<br/>When it's your turn, push 'enter' on the remote control, place a tile, and push 'menu'. The other players can comment your placement. If the active player placed a tile on the wrong place, he/she gets penalty time. The turn is moved to the next player.<br/><br/>When a puzzle is solved (or cannot be solved any futher) choose &ccedil;up' from the menu. All the players can see what their time is. The fastest player wins the game.<br/><br/>The other side of the tiles can be used to play with different colors instead of numbers. There are also chips included. When the timer reaches 30 minutes, it starts over from zero. To remind the players that half a hour is passed they can use the chips.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "1", "boardgameversion": {"38915": "First Edition"}, "name": "DVD Sudoku", "playingtime": "45", "boardgamemechanic": {"2048": "Pattern Building"}, "average": "3.25", "usersrated": "12", "boardgamesubdomain": {"4666": "Abstract Games"}, "boardgamefamily": {"7348": "DVD Board Games"}}, "21025": {"boardgamedesigner": {"1126": {"name": "Christian Freeling"}}, "poll": {}, "name": "Hexade", "playingtime": "20", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": {"2048": "Pattern Building"}, "yearpublished": "1992", "usersrated": "7", "boardgamesubdomain": {"4666": "Abstract Games"}, "maxplayers": "2", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic163095_t.jpg", "average": "6.82857", "statistics": {}, "boardgamepublisher": {"1001": {"name": "(Web published)"}}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic163095.jpg", "boardgameversion": {"26695": "Print and Play edition"}, "maxplaytime": "20", "boardgamecategory": {"1009": {"name": "Abstract Strategy"}}, "age": "0", "minplaytime": "20", "description": "This game is played with the same set of Havannah (another game by Christian Freeling): an hexagonal board (size 8) and two sets of stones.<br/><br/>Players take turns placing a stone of their color on the board.<br/>Goal of the game is forming &quot;a perfect six&quot;, which means creating:<br/><br/>     six stones in a straight row, or <br/>     six stones in a compact triangle, or <br/>     six stones in a small hexagon.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Captures are possible: you can capture two adjacent opponent's stones sandwiching them between two of your stones.<br/><br/>Online Play<br/><br/><br/>     Gamerz (turn-based, play by email or play by web)<br/><br/><br/>"}, "21026": {"boardgamedesigner": {"3814": {"name": "Martin Radtke"}}, "poll": {}, "name": "Pindoo", "playingtime": "45", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": {"2035": "Roll / Spin and Move"}, "yearpublished": "2003", "usersrated": "2", "boardgamesubdomain": {"4666": "Abstract Games"}, "maxplayers": "6", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic103532_t.jpg", "average": "6.5", "statistics": {}, "boardgamepublisher": {"4826": {"name": "Giseh Verlag"}}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic103532.jpg", "maxplaytime": "45", "boardgamecategory": {"1009": {"name": "Abstract Strategy"}}, "age": "10", "minplaytime": "45", "description": "An abstract strategy board game for 2 to 6 players.<br/>Taking turns and using dice, players must move their Pindoos (pieces) to the opposite side of the board before the opponent(s).<br/><br/>"}, "21027": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic143957.jpg", "poll": {}, "boardgamedesigner": {"3": {"name": "(Uncredited)"}}, "statistics": {}, "yearpublished": "1978", "maxplayers": "4", "age": "6", "boardgamepublisher": {"20": {"name": "Milton Bradley"}}, "maxplaytime": "30", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic143957_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "30", "boardgamecategory": {"1041": {"name": "Children's Game"}}, "description": "Thirteen cards are placed on designated areas on the game board&rsquo;s track.

The player may spin up:<br/>- 2,3,4 or 5: the spider moves that number of spaces up the board; <br/>- &quot;switch spiders&quot;: the player may change places with another spider higher up on the board; or<br/>- &quot;turn the tap&quot;: the player turns the tap at the top of the spiderweb, releasing one of the blue balls.<br/><br/>The objective of the game is to move your spider up the spiderweb to the top. During the game, the tap may be turned, the ball released has a fairly good chance of hitting some of the spider playing pieces and knocking them off the spiderweb.

Players can take a train to Dunwich (a new board that is placed on the end of the Arkham board), which adds 9 new locations and 2 new outer worlds to the game. Players reduced to 0 stamina or sanity have the option of drawing from the Injury or Madness deck, acquiring permanent handicaps, rather than losing half their items and clue tokens.

There two very different dynamics at work in the game. Since you cannot land on a square of another player's color, part of the game focuses on blocking opposition pieces and avoiding being blocked. However the game features a &quot;connection change&quot; move which involves pre-planning so that you can move one of your pieces several squares across to another square already of your color. Potentially this could be right across the board, which is a 9 by 9 grid.<br/><br/>Each time a piece moves the square it lands on becomes its own color, and the number of colored squares it has in one of the nine 3x3 borderlands on the game board determines the power of movement the piece has.<br/><br/>If the connection change involves changing a square of opposition color then your piece leaves the game, but this can also be to your advantage since the game ends shortly after the first person playing is in a position where they cannot move any pieces. So players strive to get ahead on squares and then cause any early end to the game ... or wait so that they can make a dramatic connection change on the last turn that follows the first person being unable to move.<br/><br/>Azacru is one of the games featured in the Pacru Series 302 game box of 2005 (the games all use the same board, pieces/chevrons and markers).

The floor levels have channels cut in them that makes the movement and removal of the support posts a challenge.  Players may manipulate the tower as necessary to remove the pillar, but all pillars removed on a turn that are not the spun color must be replaced before removing the objective support post.  Play continues until the tower falls; the player causing this to occur receives no points for the round whilst all other players receive points based on the color and number of supports taken on their turns.<br/><br/>Players play a number of rounds equal to the number of players playing.

Spielertage, Essen 1983 - Das Rasante Kunstflugspiel - Mit do-it-yourself Spielregeln&quot; (*) to give it it's full title.<br/><br/>This must be the most unremarkable game to have ever been presented on any of the Essen game fairs if it wasn't for a very small detail: it was the first promotional give-away game on the Essen fair ever. Maybe I'm selling it short. It was possibly also an entry in a whole new genre: make-it-up-yourself-gaming.<br/><br/>J&uuml;rgen Hagedorn from Hexagames was simply handing out  20x35cm sheet of paper, with a hand-drawn game board on it. Stuck to a corner was a small bag with 4 wooden cylinders and a dice. The drawing was very suggestive, but had no rules. Brilliant!<br/><br/>Whilst freebies continued to be used by various companies in an effort to get noticed, they often took the shape of fashionable and pointless pins that people could stick on their clothes, or, after a more inspired moment by Jumbo, were god's gift to gamers on Essen: jumbo-sized carrier bags - with appropriate logo off course.<br/><br/>For all the concentrated creative energy on show, it's amazing that it didn't seem to dawn on anyone what the potential of promo-games were when it came to getting people to your stand. It took until 1995 before the next noteworthy Essen promo-expansion appeared: Goldsieber's 13th constellation for &quot;Sternenhimmel&quot; (although this was not free). Kosmos followed in 1998 with a &quot;robber-gang-figure&quot; for &quot;Die Siedler von Catan&quot;, probably embarrassed by the success of the game and in a genuine effort to thank the fans. But it wasn't until Hans im Gl&uuml;ck released a player's expansion for its &quot;El Grande&quot; that the promo floodgates truly opened. Hans im Gl&uuml;ck is possibly still the worst offender with an endless flood of yearly &quot;Carcassonne&quot; add-ons. But where Hans led, many followed, and any visitor to the Essen Fair these days will find roaming bands of keen players trying to snaffle up all the special Essen promos on offer. It is rumored that not all of these end up on eBay. I won't join the debate weather this is racketeering or entrepreneurial. I do however applaud the recent initiatives from certain game companies to claw some of those eBay profits back, by no longer offering these promos for free, but asking a small donation for charity instead. Everyone a winner.<br/><br/>The game itself, off course, hardly got noticed and was easily forgotten. What do you expect from a sheet with a large plane and a game-of-goose type track of fluffy clouds that have different shapes but lack any explanation?<br/><br/>Nevertheless, now the &quot;Essen Freebie Game (Expansion)&quot; has became a bit of an institution, it might be time to pay tribute to the very first one: Hexagames, we salute you with a BGG entry for what must have been a great laugh.<br/><br/>(*) If you are left wondering:  &quot;Hexagames - Specially made for the first Essen Game Fair 1983 - The Speedy Stunt Plane Game - With Do-it-Yourself Rules&quot;<br/><br/>"}, "21144": {"boardgamedesigner": {"2315": {"name": "Delmer Esau"}}, "poll": {}, "name": "Wetwar", "playingtime": "60", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": {"2072": "Dice Rolling"}, "yearpublished": "2004", "usersrated": "3", "boardgamefamily": {"5611": "Cyberpunk"}, "maxplayers": "4", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic105315_t.jpg", "average": "7", "statistics": {}, "boardgamepublisher": {"1491": {"name": "Black Powder Games (BG Company)"}}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic105315.jpg", "maxplaytime": "60", "boardgamecategory": {"1022": {"name": "Adventure"}}, "age": "12", "minplaytime": "60", "description": "From Black Powder's Website:<br/>The Species Conflict<br/><br/>The year is 2038.<br/><br/>Man has grasped deep into the ocean, the wild lands, and into the orbital space, colonizing and tearing resources for the peoples use in a darkening future.<br/><br/>The future at a glance seems hard, for the birth of Risen animal species to intelligence and form like the human kind.

Nevertheless, this war was vital to the final Allied victory in the Pacific, and even more so to the impact this war would have on the post-war world. Many &ldquo;what-ifs&rdquo; could have dramatically changed the world. What if China had surrendered in 1937 and over a million Japanese soldiers would be free to overrun India. There would be no Flying Tigers or Doolittle's Raid, or even Pearl Harbor. If Japan could have mobilized Chinese manpower, the world as we know it might not exist.<br/><br/>War of the Suns (WotS) was first designed by Leonard To, a Hong Kong native, more than 20 years ago. It won the championship of the First Wargame Design Competition in Hong Kong in 1984. The game has since been updated in the early 90's, and extensively again during the last 3 years. Offering exclusive research based on recently opened Chinese archives, as well as many Japanese and English sources, has made War of the Suns one of the most painstakingly researched and accurate games of its type ever made.<br/><br/>The title of the &mdash; &quot;War of the Suns&quot;, refers to the flags of Kuomintang China and Imperial Japan. The game itself covers the period from July 1937 to August 1945. The roughly 1:3,000,000 map covers most of China proper, Burma, Assam area of India, and parts of Thailand and Indochina.<br/><br/>There is a campaign game as well as 5 separate scenarios, and the game can be played as a 1-4 players' game-with players taking the roles of Japanese, KMT, CCP, and British Commonwealth. In the game, politics will play as vital a role in how the game progresses as the units presented on the map.<br/><br/>Other key game concepts include: <br/><br/>    The HQ activation system - Players move units under the activated HQ. The number of activated HQs is affected by command points, the quality of HQ selected, and whether China is cut off from foreign routes. Randomness and quality of the HQ affects who moves what first.<br/>    The KMT replacement system - KMT units are divided into 3 levels: The elite units with imported weapons; the standard units equipped with what Chinese herself produced; and the local units which simply bought whatever they could find locally.<br/>    The Political Affiliation system - Each warlord and minor country has its own home territory. They may be affiliated with different players at different levels under different conditions. Friend may become foe with a random or historical triggering event.<br/>    The Guerilla System - From the setting up of guerrilla bases to a unique combat system, Guerrilla actions from CCP, KMT, and even British player can be as active as the front line.<br/>    Optional Rules - The game does not shy away from controversial subjects such as wartime atrocity, opium production, and Japanese collaborators. It also includes an &quot;alternate history&quot; section that probes into many &quot;what if?&quot; situations, e.g. what if Stilwell has not been recalled, but instead was capable of commanding all the Chinese forces?<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>War of the Suns Scale:<br/><br/>    Game Turn: 3 months<br/>    Counters: Army [marked as Corps on counters]/Division for the Chinese; Division/Brigade for the Japanese and British [/Western Allies]<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Game Details:<br/><br/>    Players: 1-4<br/>    Scenarios: 5<br/>    Complexity: Medium to Hard<br/>    Playing Time: 5 to 34 hours<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>War of the Sun Components:<br/><br/>    3 22&quot;x32&quot; mapsheets<br/>    1 8-1/2&quot;x11&quot; map overlay<br/>    10 countersheets (176 counters on each countersheet)<br/>    36 page rulebook<br/>    56 page playbook<br/>    8 player aid cards<br/>    4 six-sided dice<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>International Game Series game from Multi-Man Publishing.<br/><br/>The war in China-India-Burma theatre is always looked at as through a veil; perceived as a backwater front of the far larger conflict that was World War Two.

Another player could take this &quot;4 + 3&quot; before next turn by playing a &quot;7&quot;, or another player could attempt to build a higher number equation by placing another card on the &quot;4 + 3&quot; stack.  However, a player cannot build unless he or she has a card to pick up the stack.<br/><br/>A player that cannot match, combine, or build must place one card on the table.  The player making the last play takes any cards left on the table.  A player gets 3 points for having the most cards, 2 points for a Lucky 2, 2 points for a Lucky 10, and 1 point for a Lucky 1.  The player or team that is the first to get 25 points wins the game.<br/><br/>"}, "21154": {"boardgamedesigner": {"3": {"name": "(Uncredited)"}}, "poll": {}, "name": "Man at War: The Game of Crisis and Conflict", "playingtime": "0", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": {"2046": "Area Movement"}, "yearpublished": "0", "usersrated": "2", "maxplayers": "5", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic104318_t.jpg", "average": "4", "statistics": {}, "boardgamepublisher": {"4862": {"name": "Warbelle Development Corporation"}}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic104318.jpg", "boardgameversion": {"117565": "First Edition"}, "maxplaytime": "0", "boardgamecategory": {"1027": {"name": "Trivia"}}, "age": "12", "minplaytime": "0", "description": "Man at War is a trivia game where players (or teams) move their pieces through 5 layers of the Pentagon.<br/><br/>Each trivia card has 5 categories of questions:<br/><br/>1.

In this version, the pawns move forward diagonally and capture forward vertically and forward horizontally, but they can never move more than one square at a time and thus there is no &quot;en passant&quot; capture technique in this game.  Castling does not exist in Forchess.  It is suggested that kings should be captured like other pieces, although opponents should still say &quot;check&quot; when putting a king in jeopardy.  Furthermore, a player cannot place a teammate in check.  If a player cannot move any of his pieces, he must remove one piece from the board per turn until he can move a piece.  If a player captures a king, he may then use all of the removed player's pieces!<br/><br/>"}, "21157": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic993178.png", "poll": {}, "boardgamedesigner": {"3": {"name": "(Uncredited)"}}, "statistics": {}, "yearpublished": "2003", "maxplayers": "4", "boardgameartist": {"3": "(Uncredited)"}, "boardgamepublisher": {"4348": {"name": "Faith Kidz"}}, "maxplaytime": "10", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic993178_t.png", "minplaytime": "10", "boardgamecategory": {"1002": {"name": "Card Game"}}, "description": "(From the back of the box)<br/><br/>Bible Rummy<br/>Jumbo Card Game<br/><br/>Now families with young children can enjoy this popular game with a spiritual bonus.<br/><br/>     12 beautifully illustrated stories from the Bible<br/>     Jumbo-size cards are easy for little hands to hold and organize<br/>     No reading required<br/>     Set contains<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>48 brightly colored story cards.<br/>   1 instruction card with Bible story references<br/>   1 Faith Parenting card<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": {"256086": "First Edition"}, "age": "7", "name": "Bible Rummy", "playingtime": "10", "boardgamemechanic": {"2004": "Set Collection"}, "average": "1", "usersrated": "1", "boardgamefamily": {"2250": "Rummy Games"}}, "21158": {"boardgamedesigner": {"3": {"name": "(Uncredited)"}}, "poll": {}, "name": "Snakes Alive!", "playingtime": "30", "minplayers": "3", "boardgamemechanic": {"2014": "Betting/Wagering"}, "yearpublished": "1966", "usersrated": "4", "boardgamefamily": {"7509": "Animals: Snakes"}, "maxplayers": "4", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic105204_t.jpg", "average": "5.875", "statistics": {}, "boardgamepublisher": {"153": {"name": "Ideal"}}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic105204.jpg", "boardgameversion": {"110265": "Ideal Edition 1966"}, "maxplaytime": "30", "boardgamecategory": {"1032": {"name": "Action / Dexterity"}}, "age": "0", "minplaytime": "30", "description": "This game is best played in a largish area with the competitors sitting in a circle on the floor.

Each card represents the side view of an aircraft completing a maneuver - climbing, diving, looping or some other similar action.<br/><br/>The start card shows an aircraft taking off and to this players add further cards in a sequence with the smoke trails on the cards indicating where two cards can be connected together.  The card also indicates the difficulty of the stunt - and the points gained if the maneuver is successfully completed.<br/><br/>Then idea of the game is to attempt to add cards allowing the aircraft to gain and lose altitude undertaking a variety of tricks on the way.  Whether the trick is achieved or not is determined by a die roll (throwing higher than a given number shown on some of the cards). Points are earned for a successfully completed maneuver. If you fail any part of the sequence then you score nothing.<br/><br/>The game ends when the aircraft is brought in to land, through the laying of the appropriate card, at a level at the same altitude from which it took off.  The winner is the player who scored the most points during the flight.<br/><br/>The game has three variants OVER THE CLOUDS (3-5 players)  DARE-DEVILS (2-4 players) and SKY-RIDER (3-6 players)which, though broadly similar, do make the game suitable for differing numbers of players.<br/><br/>"}, "21195": {"boardgamedesigner": {"3": {"name": "(Uncredited)"}}, "poll": {}, "name": "Kong: Skull Island Game", "playingtime": "30", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": {"2035": "Roll / Spin and Move"}, "yearpublished": "2005", "usersrated": "17", "boardgamefamily": {"5607": "3D Games"}, "maxplayers": "4", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic106499_t.jpg", "average": "1.7", "statistics": {}, "boardgamepublisher": {"115": {"name": "Pressman Toy Corp."}}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic106499.jpg", "boardgameversion": {"42053": "First edition"}, "maxplaytime": "30", "boardgamecategory": {"1022": {"name": "Adventure"}}, "age": "7", "minplaytime": "30", "description": "Features two game boards!

All have gathered in front of a nearby cave entrance with the intention of collecting as many treasures as possible.<br/><br/>However, deep inside this cave, the Red Hot Silly Dragon is lying comfortably on his mountain of gold, and he is not ready to share his colossal wealth.

Who will manage to bring back the most treasures?<br/><br/>The basic principle of this small risk taking game is extremely simple. During each round of play, all players simultaneously choose an adventurer, from the four of their respective team, which they wish to send into the cave to recover treasures.<br/><br/>This choice will be done according to a &quot;crystal ball&quot; prediction, which is never highly reliable.<br/><br/>So players must bear in mind the power and the range of the flame of the dragon, and the &quot;fire resistance&quot; of each adventurer (from very weak for Spark, to very high for Ice Breaker). Also because the cave is narrow the placement of the adventurers in the cave is very limited.<br/><br/>An ascending order of fire resistances will be carried out. In fact, the more resistant an adventurer is, the slower he runs. In other words, the more you take a risk, the higher your choice of placement will be, but the more likely it is your adventurer will get scorched.<br/><br/>Lastly, to protect your valorous adventurers from the small sudden changes of mood of the dragon (anger, fury...) as well as the various tricks of your adversaries, who will surely never miss an opportunity to prevent you from recovering treasures, you will have at your disposal a complete set of magic items tailor-made for this kind of &quot;sport&quot; so it's up to you to use them wisely.<br/><br/>The winner will obviously be the player who has piled up the most treasures at the end of the game.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": {"24496": "Multi Language edition"}, "age": "10", "name": "Red Hot Silly Dragon", "playingtime": "30", "boardgamemechanic": {"2041": "Card Drafting"}, "average": "5.71837", "usersrated": "98", "boardgamefamily": {"7005": "Animals: Dragons"}}, "21220": {"boardgamedesigner": {"3": {"name": "(Uncredited)"}}, "poll": {}, "name": "Powerball", "playingtime": "10", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": {"2035": "Roll / Spin and Move"}, "yearpublished": "2000", "usersrated": "1", "maxplayers": "6", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic105149_t.jpg", "average": "6", "statistics": {}, "boardgamepublisher": {"4887": {"name": "Adis Spiele"}}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic105149.jpg", "boardgameversion": {"237995": "First edition"}, "maxplaytime": "10", "boardgamecategory": {"1032": {"name": "Action / Dexterity"}}, "age": "6", "minplaytime": "10", "description": "Powerball Das Spiel is played within a wooden frame that is assembled in two halves.

Children move like a rook in chess, while nuns move like a queen. A child that lands on a space occupied by another child starts a fight and takes a coin from him. Other children can break up a fight by landing on that same space, or tattle by landing on a nun's space. If a nun moves onto the fight space, the attacker is sent back to the entrance for detention. Finishing thirty of the minute-long turns marks the end of the game, or it ends immediately when one player's boy and girl figures meet on the same space while out of sight of the nuns.

Relive how kings managed to secure their power and gain the respect of their tribes. The construction of temples and canals, agricultural development and military victories can all spread your fame and secure your rule. Make constant decisions on how best to govern your land: rely on the rule of law and the gentle persuading powers of the Ishtar priestesses and strife for a blossoming agricultural system, or turn to the fanaticism of the Marduk priests and the battle strength of their troops. However you choose to exert your rule - you can only win the game if your rule is so successful that your fame, in the eyes of your subjects, has acquired a god-like status, making you the undisputed ruler of Mesopotamia.&quot;<br/><br/>This is the first game from Hilmar M&ouml;hlmann and has undergone several years of development. Its final version was made available to the gaming community through his website and ebay. Having acquired a copy it is obvious that this is a labor of love. The design of board and cards is beautiful - the rules are well tested, clearly presented and relatively short for such a ambitious game. Ongoing support for players is in place through website updates and direct communication. And having just acquired my copy, I wonder if the price asked actually covers the materials provided. An impressive entry for this budding designer and a one to seek out for players who enjoy games like &quot;Settlers of Catan&quot; but yearn for something a bit meatier and with a stronger theme. With an Arthurian themed game in the pipeline, this one-man act might be an interesting one to follow.<br/><br/>The aim of the game is to have the most military units and construction works of your color on the board. This can be done over 2 to 5 rounds. Resources can be acquired through natural growth, trade and military conquests. Trade takes place along caravan routes. Players can trade freely with their trading partner, pay toll to players whose territory is crossed en-route, or exchange resources against a set course with the bank. These resources can then be used to generate new buildings or units. Each turn a player can use an influence card, adding flavor and variety without unbalancing strategic play. A nice twist is that players who allow toll-free trading between other players if the caravan route passes their territory see a generous windfall from the opening of this trade route in the next round, when some resources are added to the storage in that province. Each year round ends with construction and military campaigns. Conflicts are settled by dice rolls which are modified by markers on the board.<br/><br/>This game appeared in 2 versions:<br/><br/>The self-published &quot;2D&quot; version (quality is at the very high end of desktop publishing).<br/>Some assembly is required, mainly joining the 8 pages that from the superbly produced full colour game board. In total you get 39 multicolour A4 sheets, including several photo-quality prints, six pages of clear and well presented rules, and lots of event cards, markers and game aids.<br/><br/>The wooden case with the handmade &quot;3D&quot; version of the game board is fit for a king, and for those with a rather large game budget.<br/><br/>"}, "21269": {"boardgamedesigner": {"8469": {"name": "Spud Alford"}}, "poll": {}, "name": "Finger Football", "playingtime": "0", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": {"2072": "Dice Rolling"}, "yearpublished": "2005", "usersrated": "37", "boardgamefamily": {"5552": "Finger Flicking Games"}, "maxplayers": "2", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic106206_t.jpg", "average": "6.68919", "statistics": {}, "boardgamepublisher": {"4903": {"name": "Zelosport"}}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic106206.jpg", "boardgameversion": {"110673": "First Edition"}, "maxplaytime": "0", "boardgamecategory": {"1032": {"name": "Action / Dexterity"}}, "age": "0", "minplaytime": "0", "description": "From the Publisher:<br/><br/>Zelosport Finger Football was created around the age-old concept of flicking a folded piece of paper across a tabletop until any portion of the triangle-shaped football hangs over the table's edge for a touchdown.

Contact colin@allusedgames.demon.co.uk for details.<br/><br/><br/>On the 6th March, 1944, the last great ground campaign of the Pacific theater began. The Japanese launched a two pronged thrust against the allied held towns of Kohima and Imphal. Both towns were allied forward supply dumps and the Japanese were intent upon capturing their contents.<br/>The offensive came as a great surprise, as allied Intelligence had suggested an attack on this scale was beyond Japanese capabilities.<br/><br/>Historically, both locations were surrounded, but Imphal was reinforced and supplied by air. Neither town fell and they were both relieved by allied troops advancing from the railhead at Dimapur, further South West. At the time of writing, this is the only simulation I know of that covers the entire campaign at an operational scale.<br/><br/>A game turn commences with the British and Japanese players checking supply. The British player has Supply Dumps, each with its own number of supply points recorded on a track on the map. Units trace supply to these dumps and the points thereby consumed are subtracted from the track record. The Japanese are automatically in supply for the first two game turns. From turns three to eight, however, they must trace supply in a similar manner to the British, except that supply points are held by their HQ units rather than in supply dumps. These, being mobile, are more flexible.<br/><br/>The Japanese continue to trace supply after turn eight in the same manner, but supply points become rather scarce. Units without supply have both movement and combat factors halved and cannot attack. The exceptions are the three Japanese allied units of the Indian National Army, who are eliminated after two turns without supply. The supply rules for this game are its most complex procedure, but are easily manageable for an experienced player. Japanese movement and combat follow. Movement uses standard wargame practice, though a lot of the terrain on the map is tough going.<br/><br/>Combat also holds no real surprises, being based on odds adjusted by terrain. Combat results are exchanges, retreats and eliminations. On the first turn, the Japanese get a second movement phase after combat, simulating the initial advantage of surprise.<br/><br/>British movement and combat follow, after which any British reinforcements are added to the pool of such units held off map. The British player then gets to transfer supply points between dumps or transport points from an inexhaustible supply dump off map to those on.<br/>The catch is that these same rail and air resources are also required to transport reinforcements on to the map. These, of course, are no good without supply, and vice versa.<br/><br/>Finally, Japanese reinforcements are added to the map and the game turn is over.<br/><br/>Little exists in the manner of Special rules. Engineers assist units in assaults across rivers, but not, strangely, against fortified lines. Artillery have a two hex range and British armored cavalry can retreat before combat in certain circumstances. Victory is determined by the number of towns and cities held by the Japanese player at games end and each players unit losses.<br/><br/>Despite being published back in 1975, March on India 1944 remains a good game whose rules are remarkably playable. Not suitable for beginners, but eminently playable solo, its subject has been sadly overlooked by game designers ever since. In my opinion, on the strength of this previous worthy offering, the subject deserves a more up to date treatment to test the mettle of the current crop of designers.

The values of these tokens diminish when multiple tokens are present within a single city, requiring players to move quickly to capture the higher valued tokens.<br/><br/>These tokens can be collected by the players by placing their Passengers (3 per player), which can be achieved at the end of a turn in which a player lays trains to enter the city in question. Once a passenger is in play a player can forfeit their regular turn to move a passenger. Moving along a player's own train network comes at no cost and allows a player to take the top merchandise token from each city that is passed through. A passenger can also move along sections of track featuring other players trains but a passenger card must be paid each time this occurs to do so.<br/><br/>The player who completes the most destination tickets receives a 10 point bonus (instead of the base game's longest route bonus).<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": {"25625": "English first edition"}, "average": "7.41602", "name": "Ticket to Ride: M\u00e4rklin", "playingtime": "60", "boardgamemechanic": {"2041": "Card Drafting"}, "age": "8", "boardgameexpansion": {}, "usersrated": "7815", "boardgameaccessory": {"139598": "Premium Wooden Train Token Set"}, "boardgamesubdomain": {"5499": "Family Games"}, "boardgamefamily": {"24217": "Cities: Bremerhaven"}}, "21349": {"boardgamedesigner": {"6454": {"name": "Torben Mogensen"}}, "poll": {}, "name": "Dominox", "playingtime": "30", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": {"2043": "Area Enclosure"}, "yearpublished": "2001", "usersrated": "3", "boardgamesubdomain": {"4666": "Abstract Games"}, "maxplayers": "2", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic175763_t.jpg", "average": "3.83333", "statistics": {}, "boardgamepublisher": {"1001": {"name": "(Web published)"}}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic175763.jpg", "boardgamefamily": {"97": "Dominoes"}, "maxplaytime": "30", "boardgamecategory": {"1009": {"name": "Abstract Strategy"}}, "age": "6", "minplaytime": "30", "description": "An entry in the 2001 About.com 8x8 Game Design Competition.<br/><br/>Dominox is played on a standard Chess/Checkers board using a standard set of Domino tiles.

Combat is similar to the Avalon Hill sea games, using six-sided dice. Rolls of 1-4 are no effect, 5 is a disable (ship returns to port), 6 is a hit causing a subsequent die roll for amount of damage.<br/><br/>The game is superior to the Avalon Hill sea games in some regards. Highlights include larger fleets (CL-class ships for all nations are represented in addition to the other ship classes in the AH games), more sea zones, and the blind movement resulting in often surprising battle lineups in particular sea zones.

Three odd little creatures and their frog-friends are playing, and whatever their game is it's good! There's a duck made of paper, a bug trapped in a rock, and a toad spitting sparks from its tongue.<br/><br/>They're all squealing and jumping, leap-frogging and bumping, and racing the pond; oh what fun! Such tumbling and flapping and sparking and quacking; how you'd love to join the confusion. Then they all see you watching and ask you to play, and assure you it's not an intrusion.<br/><br/>Sizzletoad! is the game for two to four players (ages 5 and up) that combines rock-paper-scissors and tic-tac-toe with an exciting leap-frog race around the pond! There's a nice bluffing element as well (especially in the 2-player version).<br/><br/>Players duel with each other in rock-paper-scissors style using their 12-card hands of Fossilticks, Paperducks, and Sizzletoads to decide which player will be able to put cards on the lily pad pond, make a tic-tac-toe, and score the most victory points.<br/><br/>During the race around the pond the excitement builds as the players speed closer and closer to the flower at the finish-line! Care for a game of Sizzletoad! anyone?<br/><br/>This is a great game for parents to play with their kids when they're looking for a bit more variation and strategy than say, &quot;Candy Land&quot; or the like.<br/><br/>Here's a quick &quot;How to Play&quot; summary for the two-player game:<br/><br/>In a two player game, of Sizzletoad! the players shuffle and split the deck (which is filled with an equal number of Sizzletoads, Fossilticks, and Paperducks.)<br/><br/>Each round a single card is compared between the players and the winner of the duel puts either of those two cards onto the lily-pad tic-tac-toe grid of the board.  The other card goes into that player's discard pile.<br/><br/>When one of the players places a matching &quot;3-in-a-row&quot; card on the tic-tac-toe grid, the other player counts the cards in his/her own discard pile, scores one point for each card and moves his/her game piece around the board by that many pips, then hands his/her cards over to the maker of the tic-tac-toe.<br/><br/>The maker of the tic-tac-toe then puts those cards into his/her own discard pile and adds them all up, scoring one point for each card and also moving his/her game piece around the board by that many pips.<br/><br/>All of the cards are then shuffled, re-dealt, and the players have another duel. The players continue dueling and adding cards to the board and their own discard piles and moving their game pieces around the numbered pips on the board.<br/><br/>The winner is the player who makes it all the way around the board onto or past the flowered lily-pad before the other player.<br/><br/>With easy game play, this solid game is a fine addition to any &quot;children's'&quot; game library.<br/><br/>Remember:  Sizzletoad-beats-Paperduck-which-beats-Fossiltick-which-beats-Sizzletoad!<br/><br/>Sizzletoad! by Mindspan Labs (previously WizerGames) is Made in the USA<br/><br/>Mindspan Labs Digital has released a 1 and 2 player app version of Sizzletoad! that is now available in the Apple app store.<br/><br/>"}, "21382": {"boardgamedesigner": {"235": {"name": "Aaron Weissblum"}}, "average": "5.65556", "poll": {}, "name": "In10sity", "playingtime": "30", "minplayers": "2", "yearpublished": "2005", "usersrated": "54", "maxplayers": "6", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic195966_t.jpg", "boardgameartist": {"15099": "Damon S.

Games archaeologists and historians disagree hotly about just about every aspect of this game: board size, number and distribution of playing pieces, use of a king piece, age, priority, etc, etc; the list goes on. However, there is evidence that the game existed, both in literature and in archaeological finds. All this disagreement suggests that, as the game traveled out to the far flung regions of empire, it was altered and developed by gamers and gamblers.<br/><br/>The basic Latrunculi consists of 1, 2, or 3 ranks of opposing pieces (the number differs), on a board divided into squares of a single color; the board itself could be 8x8, 10x10, 12x8, or variations thereof.  The move of the pieces is a matter for discussion: the rook's move, queen's move, king's move from chess, or one square orthogonally have all been suggested.  Capture is made when a piece has opposing pieces on either side of it. The winner is the player who captures all his opponent's pieces, although variations have been suggested, such as getting two pieces to the opponent's back rail.<br/><br/>As noted above, many variations exist, including a version recently discovered in Colchester (the Roman capital of England, Camulodonum), which includes a 'king' or 'standard' piece. Games of the Hnefatafl family are probably further developments of Latrunculorum. BGG members will no doubt have disagreements, opinions, and variations to add to this 'base-line' summary.<br/><br/>Moshe Callen is credited as a designer on this game for his work in researching, developing, and formalizing the rules of the game based on historical data for the nestorgames version of this game.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": {"160180": "Forster British Edition"}, "average": "6.3", "name": "Petteia", "playingtime": "20", "boardgamemechanic": {"2689": "Action / Movement Programming"}, "age": "5", "usersrated": "35", "boardgamesubdomain": {"4666": "Abstract Games"}, "boardgamefamily": {"4055": "Petteia"}}, "21489": {"boardgamedesigner": {"6491": {"name": "Fred Starkweather"}}, "poll": {}, "name": "Zapt", "playingtime": "0", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": {"2072": "Dice Rolling"}, "yearpublished": "2005", "usersrated": "0", "boardgamesubdomain": {"4666": "Abstract Games"}, "maxplayers": "8", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic298729_t.jpg", "average": "0", "statistics": {}, "boardgamepublisher": {"4962": {"name": "Brainy Products"}}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic298729.jpg", "maxplaytime": "0", "boardgamecategory": {"1009": {"name": "Abstract Strategy"}}, "age": "8", "minplaytime": "0", "description": "In Zapt, players roll three dice and can choose a numbered space to place a chip.
