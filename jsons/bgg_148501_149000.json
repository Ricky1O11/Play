They have taken what many GMs consider to be the bane of their existence&mdash;an entire party of evil player characters&mdash;and turned it into a critically acclaimed and highly popular series of adventures. What you have before you is a product designed to get you into the game quickly by providing eight pregenerated characters designed specifically to be run in an Evil Adventure Path. Each character is built using a 25 point buy, as recommended by the writers of the AP. There are four human PCs. Their stat blocks are accompanied by detailed backgrounds and reasons enough for these dark souls to go forth and wreak havoc through the land, including the details of how they came to be incarcerated in the Prison of the Branded, where the adventure begins.<br/><br/>The iconic consist of four human characters and four unique races from the NeoExodus: A House Divided campaign setting such as:<br/><br/>     Cavian: Creatures of myth, whispered in legend, lost in the mists of history &ndash; and now returned for reasons unknown to any but themselves. Such are the cavians, a race of humanoid rodents noted for their incredible psionic abilities.<br/>     Kalisan: Calibans are pale-white humanoid creatures native to the north of Exodus. Over time, many calibans have migrated to other parts and are now found in almost every parts of Exodus. Calibans have a well-deserved reputation for cannibalism and savagery. Kalisans are the most civilized of their race and are indistinguishable physically from their feral caliban cousins, although calibans can distinguish one another. Calibans tend to be much more feral and are less suited to be player characters. However the Kalisans are well-adapted.<br/>     P&rsquo;Tan: In ancient times, the First Ones enslaved all of Exodus; their plans were served well by countless thousands of unwilling servants. Once their slaves rose up and overthrew them, however, the First Ones were cast into the depths - bereft not only of their power, but also of the vast majority of the very slaves who brought them low.<br/>     Sasori: Resources wax and wane, weapons and spells become obsolete, the master craftsman of one era is displaced by the industry of the next, and even land becomes worthless with the shifting ages. But information, say the sasori, is the one commodity that is always in demand. These scorpion-like creatures are brokers of information, by turns the greatest secret-keepers and the supreme spies of Exodus. Sasori are also known for their willingness - and ability - to kill to protect their secrets.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>These iconic consist of:<br/><br/>     Anxelica Luris, Female human inquisitor<br/>     Arok Headtaker, Male kalisan magus<br/>     Cormac Blackwood, Male human antipaladin<br/>     Ghostwhisker, Male cavian alchemist (mindchemist)<br/>     Glimmershade, Female sasori rogue<br/>     Kalina Rhys, Female human cleric of Asmodeus<br/>     Rajas the Defiler, Male p&rsquo;tan barbarian<br/>     Zachris Swayne, Male human sorcerer<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>"}, "148502": {"rpgdesigner": ["James Spahn"], "rpg": ["Labyrinth Lord"], "statistics": [], "name": "Acrobat", "rpgartist": ["Wikimedia Commons"], "rpgproducer": ["James Spahn"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1789519.png", "usersrated": "0", "rpgitemversion": ["PDF version"], "average": "0", "rpggenre": ["Fantasy (High Fantasy)"], "rpgpublisher": ["Barrel Rider Games"], "rpgcategory": ["Sourcebook (rules/options to enhance play)"], "poll": [], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1789519_t.png", "description": "From publisher blurb:<br/><br/>Flying Through the Air with Death Defying Leaps!<br/><br/>With the Acrobat, a new 14-level player character class for Labyrinth Lord (and other old-school fantasy role-playing games) you'll be able to accomplish feats of agility and daring with the greatest of ease!

Will your rule be strong enough to survive? Feed your citizens, protect them from invaders, and secure their places in the afterlife!<br/><br/>IUNU is a card game for 2 to 4 players lasting about 30 minutes, with the game lasting eight rounds (with 2 or 4 players) and nine rounds (with 3 players). To set up, divide the cards into two decks &mdash; citizens cards and afterlife cards &mdash; shuffling each and placing them face down as draw decks. One player, selected to be the starting player, takes the starting player card with the (1) icon oriented up, rolls the three four-sided dice, and sets them in front of all the players along with the Bread and Deben counters. The starting player then deals an initial hand of cards &mdash; 2 players: 6 cards, 3 or 4 players: 5 cards &mdash; to each player, as well as 9 Debens worth of tokens.<br/><br/>Each round of game play has two phases:<br/><br/>&bull; Dynasty Phase: In turn, beginning with the starting player, each player plays one, or a set of, citizen cards of the same type in front of them to their &quot;Dynasty&quot;. For each additional card played beyond the first, the player must pay 1 Deben per card [Exception: The Scribe]. The player may then use the special ability of that card type as applicable. Note: You only use the Special Ability once when laying down sets of cards within a turn, i.e., even if you play a set of three Priest cards together in one turn, you only look at the afterlife deck once. Citizen cards have three numbered icons on their lefthand side:<br/><br/>1. Victory points (VP) that this card will score at the end of the game.<br/><br/>2. If a player has a clear majority of a type of citizen card (ties do not count) at game end, they gain this additional number of VP. This number may be further multiplied by an afterlife card. This number is also the total number of cards of that type in the deck.<br/>    <br/>3. Bread: A player gains additional VP if the Baker feeds that citizen with bread (see: The Baker).<br/><br/>&bull; Discard Phase: After each player has played one or a set of cards, all players must discard down to one card in their hand. The citizen discard and draw decks are then shuffled together and players draw back to their initial hand size. The starting player passes the starting player card to the next player to the left and it is rotated clockwise to the next round number. Lastly, the new starting player again rolls the three four-sided dice and the next round begins.<br/><br/>After the required number of rounds &mdash; or if a player cannot draw the required number of cards back from the draw deck at the end of any round &mdash; the game ends. Count victory points to determine the winner.<br/><br/>&bull; Total the number of victory points listed on each citizen card<br/>&bull; Add victory points for a majority of each citizen card type (no points awarded for ties). This value may be multiplied by an Afterlife Card.

Each player starts the game in Age 1 and adds the progress card of this age to his deck.<br/><br/>Each round consists of a card phase, lasting 4-5 tricks among all the players, followed by an individual management phase. During the card phase, players try to (1) gather resources (which are on the cards) to pay for the needs of their civilization and to construct buildings, (2) avoid diasters, and (3) collect discoveries. However, the value of a player's cards are affected by which Age he occupies. In Ages 1 and 2, for example, his cards have no color, so they automatically lose to cards of players in Age 3 and above as those folks have discovered the awesome power of hue. What's more, in the primitive Age 1, you can't see the cards before you play them. That's how primitive you are! In Ages 5 and 6, a player can start using trump to beat out those in lower ages.<br/><br/>The advantages in the card phase are balanced by the needs of your population, which is much greater in later ages. In each trick, each player collects one played card based on the value of their card played, and players then use the resources on these cards (food, tools and science) to satisfy the needs of their population, erect buildings (which supply additional resources), gain advantages (which can protect you from disasters or earn you victory points), or advance to the next Age of S-Evolution. Players score points each round depending on how well they meet the needs of their population, suffering penalties if they fail to do so.<br/><br/>At the end of the sixth round, players score points for their sets of discoveries, and the player with the highest score wins!<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": ["Multilingual first edition"], "name": "S-Evolution", "playingtime": "45", "boardgamemechanic": ["Trick-taking", "Worker Placement"], "average": "5.44768", "usersrated": "151", "age": "10", "boardgamepodcastepisode": ["Garrett's Games 406: S-Evolution and Florenza The Card Game"]}, "148519": {"rpgdesigner": ["(Uncredited)"], "rpgitemversion": ["Cards"], "poll": [], "name": "Spell Decks Songs of the Wild", "rpgartist": ["(Uncredited)"], "rpgproducer": ["(Uncredited)"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1790747.jpg", "usersrated": "0", "average": "0", "statistics": [], "rpg": ["d20 System / OGL Product (D&D 3.0 Compatible)"], "rpgpublisher": ["Paradigm Concepts, Inc."], "rpgcategory": ["Accessory (dice, maps, screens, cards)"], "rpggenre": ["Fantasy"], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1790747_t.jpg", "description": "From the publisher:<br/><br/>Tired of flipping through large books every time you want to cast a spell?

There are some eccentrics among the customers, so players have to carefully balance upgrading their restaurant furniture and food skills with feeding the passing customers.<br/><br/>The goal of the game is to collect the most love points by the end of the game. In order to gain love points you will need to have your customers eat as much of your food as possible. And to do that you need to improve your food preparation skills and get good furniture for your restaurant.<br/><br/>Players start the game with one food stand (which lets you prepare one food card) and five food cards. Five food cards are placed face-up in a row in the middle of the table, and six character cards are also placed face-up.<br/><br/>As the first action in the game, each player chooses two of their food cards in secret. These are then revealed to show which food preparation skills they start with.<br/><br/>Taking turns round the table. players may take two actions of the four available. They may take the same action twice. The options are:<br/><br/><br/>     Take a food card - take one of five face-up food cards on the table, or the face-down card from the top of the deck.<br/>     Prepare food - Take one food card from your hand and place it on an empty food stand. You must have the skill required to play the food card.<br/>     Buy furniture - discard any two food cards to buy the furniture you want. This could be more food stands, or wallpaper/floor tiles that may give you bonus points at the end of the game.<br/>     Raise your skill level - Play a food card in front of you to raise your skill level.<br/><br/><br/>When you prepare food, you need to check whether the hunger level of any of the face-up character cards has been satisfied by the food you have prepared. If it has, you take the character card and place it face-down in front of you. This is where most of your love points will come from.<br/><br/>At the end of your turn, replace any food or character cards that were taken from the table, shuffling the food discard pile if necessary. If you now hold more than three food cards, discard down to three.<br/><br/>The game ends when the deck of food cards has been depleted twice in a 3-player game or three times in a 4-player game. Play continues until each player has had the same number of turns. Love points are awarded for the character cards you have collected, from drink cards that you may have played during food preparation, and bonuses from the wallpaper/floor tile furniture cards.

The scale of the game is one unit for 100 to 500 soldiers or one or two guns. One game turn represents a duration of 20 to 30 minutes. A corps represents either a vanguard or a rearguard, or the main body called battle.<br/><br/>The combats allow to simulate charges &laquo; in wall &raquo;, the merciless shocks between pikemen, the artillery fire and highlight, by a support system, the combination of iron -shock- and fire -shooting. The optional rules- caracoles, orders, lost children, looting- add even more realism to the era's battles. The rules and the five battles offered are based on a thorough bibliography and researches made into books written by (non???) contemporary authors, specifically Fran&ccedil;ois de la Noue for the Protestants and Blaise de Montluc for the Catholics, and also on precise topographical plans of each battlefield that is still accessible, except for Saint-Denis... Are you ready to put on the Prince of Cond&eacute;'s, the admiral of Coligny's, the constable of Montmorency's, Anne de Joyeuse's or Henri of Navarre's armours and to fight your enemies &laquo; By Shot, Shock and Faith &raquo; ?

It started as me gazing at a cover for a Raymond Feist novel and ended up being about 70 pages worth of material. I ran a few sessions of the campaign, and then put it aside. Since then I&rsquo;ve probably shamelessly stolen names and concepts from my own work a dozen times, but as I was perusing my hard drive for something to work on I thought about it again.<br/><br/>Since the &ldquo;book&rdquo; was pretty much written in its entirety to begin with, and I already had a cover (not my art) and a page background design (my own work), and I already had a character sheet (again my work) I decided to go ahead and lay it out, and add a bookmark to it. It probably took me four months to write, and it took me 3 days to lay out in my spare time. I hope you enjoy. And if anybody wants to take on the monumental task of writing up statistics for this for another game system, I&rsquo;ll post any conversions that cross my desk. This is my official version, unless I create a specific spin-off. So I really don&rsquo;t mind if someone else thinks the ideas warrant conversion to their own favorite system.<br/><br/>From Introduction:<br/><br/>Notes about this Edition:<br/>This document was first drafted for my own campaign circa 2005. As it was designed for Savage Worlds Revised, the Explorer Edition weapon statistics are absent. You will have to convert them using the formulas that should be easy to find in other products produced by Pinnacle. Likewise, you may need to reference other products to obtain the full list of racial templates, as they are not included in the Explorer&rsquo;s Edition.<br/><br/>Genre:<br/>Realmstorm is a Swashbuckling Pulp Science Fantasy campaign. There are elements of hyper-science, esoteric supernatural arts, weirdness, the unknown, etc. all wrapped up in a world of Renaissance or Napoleonic sensibilities with a bit of High Adventure thrown in.<br/><br/>"}, "148559": {"rpgartist": ["(Uncredited)"], "rpgitemversion": ["PDF version"], "poll": [], "name": "Mystara Adversary Compendium I", "rpgdesigner": ["Byron D.

It still took me more than four months to write most of the statistics and descriptions in the volume, and then I took a few breaks. I detoured into horror and concentrated on something else for a while. Well, today marks the release of this long-awaited document.<br/><br/>As it is never a good idea to sit on a book that&rsquo;s almost done for too long, I finished everything but the appendix of &ldquo;human and demi-human adversaries&rdquo; I began working on after I released Eternal Shadows. I still intend to finish that, but obviously it&rsquo;s not important enough to hold back 70 pages of creatures designed to push your low to mid level PCs to the limits.<br/><br/>The only note I have about this volume is that it is designed to The Known World, and thus the Defense statistics are in line with the Official House Rule in that setting. If you intend to use these creatures in Dragon Age or other game, subtract 1 Defense from human sized creatures, and 2 from cat sized or smaller ones.<br/><br/>"}, "148560": {"rpgartist": ["(Uncredited)"], "rpgitemversion": ["PDF version"], "poll": [], "name": "Home Sweet Home", "rpgdesigner": ["Byron D.

Each hero also has one or more character reference cards, which show the special abilities for the characters based on the die rolls. Different versions of these cards will be available in booster packs, allowing for more customization of your team. Players use these dice to collect energy, recruit new heroes, and battle head-to-head. In addition, each player brings two basic action cards to the game, which are placed in the center of the table; both players can purchase these cards. A player wins once the opposing player has been reduced to zero life.<br/><br/>The Marvel Dice Masters: Avengers vs. X-Men starter set comes with 44 custom dice, 38 cards, two dice bags, and a core rulebook.

You will also roll the Draidis Dice (2 dice) once per turn which shows you what Cylon threats will have to be resolved in this area of space before you can continue. The Cylons are also attempting to move down their track and perform Traitorous Acts to prevent the Humans from reaching the home of the lost 13th Tribe, Kobol. As each side completes their Track, an event is triggered. If the Cylons complete 3 events before the humans do, you lose.

In addition to providing corresponding resources, city tiles give their owners action tokens that can be used at any point of the game.<br/>     Red tiles are temples and altars that give players victory points. They are of different values (from 1 to 3 points) and require different combination of resources.<br/><br/><br/>A player's turn consists of three phases. First, the player must add a new tile from the stack to the common market. Then, he has the option of playing one of his tokens; these tokens are able to buy opponents' resources, pillage enemy tiles, transfer resources between tiles, and convert resources to victory points. Finally, the player must add a tile from the market to his domain. The game ends after all red tiles are added to the players' domains. Each player calculates victory points from his temples and tokens, and the player with the most points wins.<br/><br/>"}, "148640": {"rpgartist": ["Kanani Cowell", "Kamea Cowell", "Charlie O'Brien", "Mark Thornton"], "rpgitemversion": ["PDF version"], "statistics": [], "name": "Deathbed", "rpgdesigner": ["Mark Thornton"], "rpgproducer": ["Mark Thornton"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1791903.jpg", "usersrated": "0", "average": "0", "rpggenre": ["Fantasy (High Fantasy)"], "rpgpublisher": ["Khaghbboommm Press"], "rpg": ["Tunnels & Trolls (7th - 7.5 Editions)"], "rpgcategory": ["Solitaire Adventure"], "poll": [], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1791903_t.jpg", "description": "From publisher blurb:<br/><br/>This one is quite different...starting with a bump in the night and then things only go downhill from there!

In some eternal universe it just is. Jaconia is a big round piece of free land in the middle of a long dead, dark civilization's ruins. Jaconia is surrounded by Borvaria, kingdom of death, miljons of square kilometers of ancient ruined city. Nobody knows what lies behind Borvaria, some religions say there is nothing at all. Borvaria is dead land. Eternal dark force and nameless creatures make it a dark hell. Praedors are adventurers who earn their living by robbing and pillaging the ruins of Borvaria and Warth.<br/><br/>'Praedor is a fantasy roleplaying game based on the world of Petri Hiltunens graphic novels with the same name. It tells about Jaconia, fragment of a world, left in the middle of the ruins of a super-culture, devastated by an ancient curse. It tells about praedors, talented and courageous adventurers, who make trips to the ruins of Borvaria in hope of treasures. They are the heroes and villains of legends, envied and hated upstarts. Among them, high and low are equal, because monsters and demons don't care about family trees.<br/><br/>Jaconia is also a lot more, nothing prevents you from playing crooked nobles, acid-burned alchemists, thiefs of big cities, clergy men, cultists et cetera. Almost 100 pages of World book is a great source for anyone interested in Jaconia. The whole book is awesomely illustrated by Petri Hiltunen himself and includes 15 comic pages describing different parts of Jaconia.<br/><br/>Game rules and text parts are made by Ville Vuorela, who's earlier creations are Miekkamies, Taiga and Mobsters and many projects using RPGs in higher education. Rules are easy to learn, but very detailed if needed. Values are easy to change to be compatible with other RPG systems or to take in use in another environment or game world.<br/><br/>"}, "148644": {"rpgartist": ["Daniel J\u00f6demann", "Gero Pappe"], "rpgitemversion": ["German pdf"], "rpgseries": ["Lovecraft Country Collection"], "name": "Das Grauen von den Sternen", "rpgdesigner": ["Mark Morrison", "Lynn Willis"], "rpgproducer": ["Christian Hanisch", "Frank Heller"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1791290.jpg", "usersrated": "0", "rpgsetting": ["Cthulhu Classic (1920s & 1930s)"], "average": "0", "statistics": [], "rpg": ["Call of Cthulhu (2nd - 6th Edition)"], "rpgpublisher": ["Pegasus Spiele"], "poll": [], "rpgcategory": ["Scenario / Adventure / Module"], "rpggenre": ["Horror (Cthulhu Mythos)"], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1791290_t.jpg", "description": "<br/>User description<br/><br/>This adventure was originally scheduled to be releases as part of the adventure compilation Lovecraft Country Collection 2: Grauen in Arkham for Call of Cthulhu but did not make it into the publication.<br/>German publisher Pegasus decided to publish the adventure for free on their webpage.<br/><br/>"}, "148645": {"rpgartist": ["Jari Tuovinen"], "rpgitemversion": ["Finnish version"], "statistics": [], "name": "Parhaaseen Katseluaikaan", "rpgdesigner": ["Matt Wilson"], "rpgproducer": ["Eero Tuovinen", "Markku Tuovinen"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1792089.jpg", "usersrated": "0", "average": "0", "rpggenre": ["Generic / Universal", "Modern"], "rpgpublisher": ["Arkenstone Publishing"], "rpg": ["Primetime Adventures (1st, 2nd and 3rd Editions)"], "rpgcategory": ["Core Rules (min needed to play)"], "poll": [], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1792089_t.jpg", "description": "user summary:<br/>Finnish translation of Primetime Adventures (1st edition) by Eero and Markku Tuovinen and extra illustrations by Jari Tuovinen, published by Arkenstone publishing.

You have three abilities, Speed, Combat, and Defense, and at the start of each turn you must assign one of three dice (a d4, a d6, and a d8) to each of them. While the game involves a good deal of luck and dice-rolling, judicious dice allocation is the key to success.

If your token lands on one or more meadow tiles, you place the tile face-up next to the meadow (if it is a water lily), place it face-up in front of you (dandelion) or place it face-up in front of you and get to look at two of the face-down meadow tiles and place them in a spot of your choice in the meadow (honey flower). If your token lands on another player's token, you have to give him/her one of the tiles you've collected.<br/>When a player turns over the fourth water lily, he/she finishes the turn, and then the game ends. The player with the most flower tiles wins the game.<br/><br/>"}, "148744": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1798117.jpg", "boardgameimplementation": ["Times Square"], "poll": [], "boardgamedesigner": ["Matthew Tidbury"], "statistics": [], "yearpublished": "2013", "maxplayers": "6", "boardgameartist": ["Alonso Jacobo", "Matthew Tidbury", "Rory Walker"], "boardgamepublisher": ["ThinkNoodle Games"], "boardgameintegration": ["Times Square", "Times Square"], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1798117_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "30", "boardgamecategory": ["Dice", "Educational", "Math", "Puzzle", "Zombies"], "description": "City of Zombies is a co-operative, dice-based intense team survival game.

We recommend 8.<br/>-Choose which coloured side of the cards you will play for your game.<br/>-Shuffle the deck of cards and place down in the centre of the table.<br/><br/>Playing the game:<br/>-One player is nominated from each team to be the describing player for the first round, the remaining players on the team are the guessing players.<br/>-Once you have selected your describing and guessing players a member of either team can activate the timer.<br/>-Once the timer is activated the timer ticks for an undisclosed amount of time.During this time the describing player of Team One collects a card from the top of the card pile. Each card features 10 items of phrases. The describing player selects any one of the ten and describes their selection to the guessing members on their team. The description can only be made by voice , no gestures are allowed. The describing player must not use any part of the word or phrase to help their description. The guessing players do their best to answer as quickly as possible.<br/>- On correctly guessing the item or phrase the card is passed to Team Two's describing player who then selects a different item or phrase from the same list of ten. They then proceed to describe the selected item to their guessing players. Again, on a correct guess the card is passed back to Team One's Describing player, who picks a new item or phrase. This process continues with both teams attempting to describe and guess correctly as quickly as possible so they may return the card to the opposing team.<br/>-During this time the timer continues to tick until eventually a buzzer sounds marking the end of the round.

Unnecessary delays in handing over the card or taking the card are not allowed.

Quite popular on Polish market due to much lower price.<br/><br/>Scriba is an extended version of Scriba Travel, because it provides two variants of gameplay. The first variant is exactly the same, but the second is quite insane.<br/><br/>The first variant is similar to Scrabble (but there are some differences). Players use their 6/7/8 (this is up to the players) drawn letter-tiles to form words on the gameboard. Each word laid out earns points based on the commonality of the letters used, with certain board spaces giving bonuses. But a word can only be played if it uses at least one already-played tile or adds to an already-played word. The differences between Scriba (1st variant) and Scrabble are:<br/>- If you play all but one letter from your rack you get 20 points bonus.<br/>- You can stack the letters on top of the already played (like in Upwords), but only two levels of letters are allowed<br/>- There are negative bonuses on the board.<br/>- The player that ends the game receive 50 points bonus (because he played all his letters, we don't mind if he had one or two).<br/>- If a player passes, he receives minus 5 points.<br/>- The are tiles with no letter but with a black spot. This can be placed anywhere adjacent to already played tiles and is usually used to prevent from extending a particular word.<br/>- The are tiles with a curved arrow (wich looks like 'enter key') which allows to play a word half vertically and half horizontally.<br/><br/>The second variant uses every rule from first variant with some additional rules:<br/>- The players use chips in four colors to place all the bonuses on the board wherever they want.<br/>- Whenever a player uses the bonus, he takes the chip from the board and places it in front of him. Every chip is worth 1 point during the final scoring.<br/>- The start player does not have to place his first word in the middle of the board.<br/>- After every move the player roll a d6 and draws that number of letter-tiles.<br/>- There are 12 big yellow chips which at the start of the game are distributed to the players in equal shares. Every chip is worth 10 points at the end of the game. Whenever a player plays exactly four letter-tiles from is rack, he can take one big chip from a chosen opponent.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": ["First edition"], "name": "Scriba", "playingtime": "90", "boardgamemechanic": ["Dice Rolling", "Hand Management", "Tile Placement"], "average": "5.2381", "usersrated": "21", "age": "10"}, "148920": {"rpgdesigner": ["Leonard Balsera", "Robert Donoghue", "Brian Engard", "Brett Fitzpatrick", "Fred Hicks", "Jeremy Keller", "Ryan Macklin", "Mike Olson", "Clark Valentine", "Amanda Valentine"], "rpgitemversion": ["PDF version"], "poll": [], "name": "Cyber-Fate", "rpgartist": ["Brett Fitzpatrick"], "rpgproducer": ["Brett Fitzpatrick"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1796432.jpg", "usersrated": "0", "average": "0", "statistics": [], "rpg": ["Fate Core"], "rpgpublisher": ["Starbright Illustrations"], "rpgcategory": ["Campaign Setting (game world)", "Core Rules (min needed to play)"], "rpggenre": ["Science Fiction (Cyberpunk)"], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1796432_t.jpg", "description": "From publisher blurb:<br/><br/>A cyberpunk setting for FATE, with the core FATE rules baked in.

That's actually one hundred games, not the ninety-nine promised in the title, (I guess the number ninety-nine just sounded catchier to the marketing department). There's a single menu screen from which the player chooses the game type and the game level. On this screen there are two additonal windows, one displays the objectives and the game controls while the second window displays a screen shot.<br/><br/>There is no high score table for any of these games, no pause, no save game facility and no automatic progression from one 'game' to the next, nor is there any in-game help text. It is also noticeable that the games re-use the same graphics, for example the tanks in the first two games fire the same missiles that are used in both JP-Flight and Up Shooter, the player's ship in Asteroid Hunter is one of the enemy ships in JP-Flight and so-on.<br/>The games you get in this product are:<br/><br/>    Tank Battle:<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>This game consists of ten levels each lasting twenty or thirty minutes, though the objectives change in each level they're all basically the same - defeat the enemy tanks and survive until the time runs out. <br/><br/>    Tank Duel:<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>This game is very similar to Tank Battle and uses the same controls. Here the player's team must destroy the enemy team over a series of ten or fifteen minute rounds. The game consists of locating a tank in the game area and destroy it. It will be replaced and the process continues until the round countdown timer expires at which point the timer is reset and the the next round starts immediately, the process continues until the final round is over.<br/><br/>    JP-Flight Space Shooter<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>This game is a keyboard controlled Space Invader style game where enemies advance down the screen in ranks and the player must eliminate them. All the games are the same but with minor variations, game two introduces bonuses (which may or may not help), in level three the enemy has an asteroid field to protect them and so on.<br/><br/>The player has five lives and ten thousand health points. Health points are lost when the player takes a hit or collides with an enemy but points can be scored by destroying enemy craft. The longer each game progresses the harder it becomes to destroy an enemy ship, what was once destroyed by a single hit may take two, three or more hits to destroy. <br/>In the end the player just cannot shoot fast enough so either they lose all remaining lives/health to an indestructable screen ful of ships or one of the ships lands.<br/><br/>    Asteroid Hunter<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>This game is a variation on Asteroids. There are ten game variations in which the sole objective is to destroy asteroids, when all asteroids are destroyed another set appears. Some games give the player has wingmen who assist in the destruction and there may be bonus items to be collected that increase or decrease the player's health points and can provide short periods of invulnerability. The arrow keys are used to steer the ship and the mouse is used to aim and fire. The game continues until the player runs out of lives and health points.<br/><br/>    Planet Defender<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>This game to is a variation on Asteroid Hunter, however here the player must protect a planet from the onslaught of rocks. The game uses the same controls and bonuses as Asteroid Hunter so game play is very similar. Later levels introduce multiple planets, space stations and enemy spacecraft. The player starts with five lives and ten thousand health points which are decreased when the spaceship hits an asteroid and the planet starts with thirty thousand health points which are eroded as it is struck by rocks. The game ends when the planet is destroyed or the player runs out of health points and lives.<br/><br/>    Up-Shooter<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>This game is a Galaxian style game. Enemies swoop across and down the screen and the player must eliminate them. Gameplay continues until the player runs out of lives and health while the longer the game goes on the enemies become harder to destroy.<br/><br/>    Robot Arena<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Here the player controls a robot, a kind of tracked vehicle, and drives it around a maze. The player starts unarmed and must collect lasers, cannon, etc by finding them in the maze. There are ten levels, one of which is a five minute survival game where the player's bot is unarmed, the remainder ar all twenty or thirty miutes long and have the same &quot;destroy opposing robots to score points&quot; objective. As with other games in this compilation the arrow keys steer the robot and the mouse aims the weapon. <br/><br/>    Space Race<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Here the player has to race around a track that consists of a tunnel made from hoops suspended in space. The mouse steers the craft while the forward/backward arrow keys control the speed.<br/><br/>    Cannon Shoot<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>In the early levels tanks pass from left to right and the player must destroy a fixed number within the time period of the game, for example the objective in game one is to destroy 300 tanks in 20 minutes to win while not allowing more that 150 tanks to sneak by. Games 5-10 take the action into space with enemy ships and asteroids to shoot at. Some enemy tanks/spacecraft/rocks will attack the player but most will not. The game is over if the player loses all five lives or if too of the designated enemy escape.<br/><br/>    Interceptor<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>A never ending line of enemy craft fly across the top of the screen dropping bombs, bricks and so on. The player's craft shoots both forward and sideways simultaneously and the objective is to to achieve a high score by destroying as many craft and bombs as possible. Later levels give the player buildings to defend, move the action into space, or limit the players ammunition, requiring that the player visits the bottom right corner to reload.<br/><br/><br/>"}, "148927": {"rpgartist": ["Dimitri Bielak", "James D.

It is a hard science fiction game with a simple and internally consistent set of core rules and game mechanics. Although it is supported by a detailed background these rules can be quickly adapted to any SF universe you could want to devise (or borrow).<br/><br/>This game&rsquo;s focus is on the extraordinary Heroes that the players create. You will quickly discover that the characters this system encourages are larger than life and almost cinematic in quality. Hey, if you want to play a down-on-his-luck, droid service engineer that&rsquo;s up to you. Personally I&rsquo;d prefer to play a High-G World, former Corporate Marine on the run from the Southern Cross Organisation, who&rsquo;s battling to prevent Ancient Technology from falling into the hands of rogue AI Terminators. Or perhaps a gorgeous Belter Star-pilot trying to break the bank at an Orbital Casino while her crew ambush an alien courier. Or even a veteran Farsider Trader leading his men into the desperate pursuit of Rim Pirates who have his patron&rsquo;s daughter in their evil clutches.<br/><br/>This game is much more Flash Gordon than Star Trek.
