Stalin gave the order to finish up with finland in order to concentrate on Operation Bagration that had just begun. Subsequently, Soviet forces had to first batter the fortified VKT-line then quickly break through toward the north.<br/>At the beginnig, with the help of the 30th Guards Army, the soviet advance was slow but steady until they formed a salient near Ihantala. Attrition was great in both camps, but tha arrival of the Finnish armoured division coupled with a particularly effective artillery fire changed the stuation and the following counter-attack led to the pushing back of the Soviets.<br/>Finally, the Finnish forces succeeded with their last reserves and the German aviation to stabilize the lines. Stalin canceled the offensive and negotiated with the Finish authorities to obtain yhe reversal of thid former ally against the Germans. Finland was saved but at what cost!<br/><br/>Turda 1944:<br/><br/>Continuing their rapid advance across the country of their new ally, Romania, the Soviets were engaged by the Hungarain 2nd army in Transylvania before arriving in the local capital Cluj. Confronted by the enemy avant-guard, the Hungarians went so far as to launch an offensive along the Mures. After a brief phase of surprise, the Stavka reacted by ordering the Soviets units present as well as the Romanian 4th army, in the process of reorganizing, to reach Turda and its pass. Attacks in several sectors along the Mures ensued that the Hungarian forces as well as the German reinforcements had a difficult time repelling.<br/>Evan the 23rd Panzer Division struggled to contain the repeated assaults by the Soviet and Romanian forces. Fortunately for the Axis, the allied losses were such that the Stavka decided mid-October to circumvent Turda by the east.<br/>As the Soviet, will you be able to break through the front in a decisive way and as a member of the Axis, will you succeed in containing the red waves?<br/><br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": {"289505": "First edition"}, "maxplaytime": "0", "average": "7.80769", "name": "Orages \u00e0 l'Est", "playingtime": "0", "boardgamemechanic": {"2026": "Hex-and-Counter"}, "age": "12", "usersrated": "13", "boardgamefamily": {"17599": "VaeVictis WWII Operational series"}}, "187004": {"poll": {}, "name": "Hamsterspiel", "playingtime": "0", "minplayers": "0", "boardgamemechanic": {"2035": "Roll / Spin and Move"}, "yearpublished": "1930", "usersrated": "1", "maxplayers": "0", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2728209_t.jpg", "average": "7", "statistics": {}, "boardgamepublisher": {"3392": {"name": "Hausser"}}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2728209.jpg", "boardgameversion": {"289507": "First edition"}, "maxplaytime": "0", "boardgamecategory": {"1041": {"name": "Children's Game"}}, "age": "0", "minplaytime": "0", "description": "Simply vintage roll &amp; move board game for children.

No one man was given supreme command of all French forces in Spain, and French operations &ndash; though frequently successful on a local level, were marred by a lack of cooperation. This was made yet worse by Napoleon's own attempts to run the war by remote control from Paris, sending written orders that were out of date even before they were dispatched.<br/><br/>Though often defeated, and similarly bereft of central control for the early years of the war, the Spanish leaders kept on putting fresh armies into the field, while the civilian populace refused to surrender and fought a bloody guerrilla war against the invaders. This tied down a large part of the French forces, limiting the numbers available to pursue further conquests. As a result, once their initial occupying army had been driven out in 1808, the French were never able to conquer Portugal, which was defended by its own reorganized forces and by a growing British contingent. The British were led by Arthur Wellesley, a man of outstanding ability who would subsequently get the better of Napoleon himself at Waterloo. Although initially the French had the upper hand, the reorganization of the Portuguese army by Beresford and the construction of the Lines of Torres Vedras secured Portugal from French conquest. Thereafter, Portugal would become the base for the Anglo-Portuguese army that would eventually join with the Spanish to evict the French from the Peninsula.<br/><br/>Bonaparte's Peninsular War will take you through battles and campaigns focused in and around Portugal, but also branch out into Spain for some of the early war actions of 1809.

When several Chinese monks were beaten, this faction paid thugs to fan anti-Japanese activities in the Chinese sector of Shanghai. Seizing the &ldquo;opportunity,&rdquo; a small force of naval infantry invaded Chapei, the all-Chinese northern section of the city of Shanghai. But the Japanese had not counted on the quick reaction and effective fighting of the Nationalist Chinese forces from nearby Nanjing. The initial Japanese thrust was thrown back quickly. It took repeated reinforcements over the next five weeks for the Japanese to push the Chinese out of the city and away from the Huangpo and Yangtze Rivers. Shanghai would become a major springboard for further Japanese advances, but the battle had taken its toll. This game covers those five weeks of fighting.<br/><br/>Shanghai Incident uses the Fire &amp; Movement system designed around the realities of mechanized warfare, giving motorized and/or specially-trained units clear advantages. Players can augment units at the instant of combat with support fire, provided by weapons ranging from mortars through cannon and light ground attack aircraft to heavy bombers. A seemingly predictable assault can be overturned at the last minute by heavy defending fires, while even small units may develop tremendous offensive punch with the assistance of a heavy bombardment. Winning the battle is a matter of maneuver, firepower and asset management.<br/><br/>The Japanese military has greater overall skill and firepower, although the Chinese have two German-trained divisions. Both players have manpower limitations that are eased only when the Japanese player calls a pause to his offensive. Both sides therefore have to weigh time and space against numbers.

Nathaniel Banks led a small army up Louisiana's Red River. His objective, in conjunction with an overland campaign through Arkansas, was the Confederate Trans-Mississippi capital at Shreveport. Poor coordination of the two columns enabled the Confederates to concentrate their slender resources against each in turn. Banks was first, and in early April his spearhead was hit near the crossroads of Mansfield. Historically, the Union forces, strung out on the march, were routed piecemeal, but the battle could have gone the other way.<br/><br/>Mansfield uses the simplified QuickPlay version of the Musket &amp; Saber system of warfare during the muzzle-loading era. Combat is based on unit quality rather than raw numbers, and rewards use of historical tactics. All units are susceptible to rout when weakened, so players must maintain reserves. Leaders enhance unit capabilities. Winning the battle depends on deployment, thoughtful maneuver to concentrate at the key points, the proper coordination of arms, careful use of leaders and special units, and an understanding of the strengths and weaknesses of each army.<br/><br/>Scale:<br/><br/>     Level: Brigade<br/>     Hex: 440 yards<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": {"289546": "English first edition"}, "age": "0", "name": "Mansfield Crisis in the Pine Barrens 8 April 1864", "playingtime": "90", "boardgamemechanic": {"2026": "Hex-and-Counter"}, "average": "5.78571", "usersrated": "7", "boardgamefamily": {"19329": "Decision Games Mini Series"}}, "187031": {"rpg": {"25418": "5e Game System Product (D&D 5th Edition Compatible)"}, "statistics": {}, "name": "Dungeons of Ice", "rpgproducer": {"80119": "Doug Schultz"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2736920.png", "usersrated": "1", "rpgitemversion": {"289547": "PDF version"}, "average": "8", "rpggenre": {"155": "Fantasy (High Fantasy)"}, "rpgcategory": {"2084": "Scenario / Adventure / Module"}, "poll": {}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2736920_t.png", "description": "From publisher blurb:<br/><br/>At the top of a frigid mountain pass lays a ruined castle.

The other player controls the Germans and tries to prevent it, or failing that, to grab a source of supply in one of the surrounding Allied colonies. The Germans historically eked out a win by grabbing a supply source in the British colony of Northern Rhodesia even though they had been chased out of their home colony.<br/><br/>Lettow-Vorbeck uses the Hand of Destiny series rules. Each player has a unique set of campaign cards generating movement, combat bonuses, historical events, and reinforcements. Playing the right card at the right time lets one side concentrate the forces needed to win that great victory against all odds, or perhaps go down to inglorious defeat.

Each player starts with two randomly-drawn tiles in hand, with each double-sided tile depicting 1-3 types of landscape out of the four types present in the world.<br/><br/>When play begins, each player simultaneously starts laying tiles into the frame; each tile must be adjacent to two sides to be placed, so initially tiles can be placed only in the corners of the frames, with players building inward from there. Players can place tiles anywhere that they can legally be placed (two sides are adjacent to the frame or previously placed tiles and all landscapes match across tile borders.<br/><br/>Instead of placing a tile, a player can place it in their personal discard area, which can hold at most ten tiles. When a player has both hands free, they can draw two new tiles from the bag; alternatively, any player with a free hand can pick up any tile in any discard area and place it in the world.<br/><br/>At any point during the game, a player can claim one of four gods and that god's followers. Each god is associated with a particular type of landscape, e.g., the merfolk god. Once a player has followers, they can place a prophet on a tile they just placed to claim that section of landscape. Players can place any number of prophets in a landscape as long as they're placing each prophet on a tile they just added to the world.<br/><br/>At any point in the game, if a player thinks that a section of the board cannot be filled with a tile &mdash; e.g., a space that's surrounded by four types of landscapes &mdash; that player can place a round city marker in that space, and then claim that city with a prophet. If a matching tile is found later, a player can &quot;smash&quot; and collect that city, replacing it with the tile.<br/><br/>Once the world is filled or players agree that no more tiles can be placed, the game ends. Each player scores five points for each city occupied or smashed. Each landscape with one or more prophets is worth a number of points to the player(s) with the most prophets in it equal to the number of tiles in that landscape minus the number of prophets in it. The landscape with the largest mass rewards its god with a large bonus, with the second and third largest masses rewarding their gods with smaller bonuses; similarly, the landscape that appears in the most distinct groups rewards its god with a large bonus, with the second and third largest groups again rewarding their gods with smaller bonuses.<br/><br/>Whichever god has scored the most points wins!<br/><br/>"}, "187105": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2728435.jpg", "is_expanded_by": {"187106": {"name": "The Maze: Teleportals"}}, "poll": {}, "boardgamedesigner": {"86556": {"name": "Nick Coyour"}}, "statistics": {}, "yearpublished": "2015", "maxplayers": "4", "boardgamepublisher": {"30878": {"name": "Xion Productions"}}, "maxplaytime": "15", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2728435_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "15", "boardgamecategory": {"1002": {"name": "Card Game"}}, "description": "In the distant future, the biggest entertainment event on the planet is The Maze.

Anyone except the person who caused the cave-in will drop the last mineral they have mined on effected tile and they also have two moves to escape to safety (open tile), if they failed to move to safety with in two moves than they would die and they could re-spawn from any tile they like.

An Advanced Playbooks is essentially a second playbook you apply on top of your basic playbook to create a more complicated character. Unlike a basic playbook, you cannot play as these playbooks by themselves. Unlike a Compendium Class, you can start the game as one of these playbooks, and you don't need to level up to gain one, you just need to meet the requirements.<br/><br/>It's time to get spooky. Did you have a bad run-in with some Vampires? Well, now your Dungeon World character can become afflicted with Vampirism as a result, with all the power and fear of sunlight that brings you! Werewolves and werebears and wererabbit bites can come with similar consequences. Even death's embrace won't stop your hero if you still have unfinished business, not when you can become The Wraith.<br/><br/>This set of playbooks brings the power of becoming something else to your game. Your players can become a Vampire, a Werewolf, or even a Wraith, and even start the game already afflicted as such, if they want. These playbooks consume some of what you once were, replacing some of their Moves with new ones that give them just the right set of monstrous powers.<br/><br/>    The Vampire is a cunning and deadly hunter, with a variety of customization available to them. All vampires require Blood to power their supernatural strength, but what they do with it can vary greatly. The Vampire can excel as a fighter, a sneak, or a charmer, and you can focus on your vampiric power as much or as little as you'd like.<br/>    The Werewolf is a powerful, transforming beast. The playbook isn't necessarily a wolf - it will do just as well to portray the plight of Dr. Jekyll or The Incredible Hulk, or you can be any other kind of were-creature, like a Werebear or a Werebat. But no matter what you are, this playbook is all about reckless and uncontrollable power, and your curse will leave devastation in your wake.<br/>    The Wraith has unfinished business. This playbook is the easiest of these Advanced Playbooks to enter - all you need to do is die with unfinished business you refuse to leave unfinished. This playbook sees you become a ghost - you become incorporeal, you can fly, and you gain telekinetic powers. None of your gear works anymore, but it isn't like you need it.

One tricky aspect, though, is that the sums of the chips are taken mod 10, so if you sandwich one or more chips with a 5 and 6, then your total is actually 1 (1 = 11 mod 10), so you couldn't flip the sandwiched chips unless they summed to 10 (since 10 mod 10 = 0).<br/><br/>If you can't flip a chip, you must pass.

POWER KILL only comes into play at the beginning and ending of each Regular Game Session (RGS).<br/><br/>POWER KILL works hand-in-hand with your favorite NRG. Whether you play Vampire: The Masquerade or Advanced Dungeons &amp; Dragons, POWER KILL is there for you to use, seamlessly integrated with your usual play.<br/><br/>The intent of POWER KILL is to add an additional level of Fun And Excitement (FAE) to your NRG sessions. You'll play your NRG as always, but the addition of POWER KILL mini-sessions at the beginning and ending of your normal session will add a lot to your gaming experience.

Certainly, they want your business &ndash; repeatedly, even. It&rsquo;s not like anyone will just up and stab you for wandering through the gate or off the boat. On the contrary, you are far more valuable alive, at least so long as you have gold to spend and favors to trade...<br/><br/>That&rsquo;s really what makes Eastport so dangerous. Once it gets enough hands on you, some part of you will always belong to it. You&rsquo;ll never want for a good party, though.&quot;<br/><br/>~ Michael Longteller, Bard and Courier of Galea<br/><br/>Eastport is an excellent example of the kinds of city-states one finds throughout the Wildlands. Fierce independence collides raucously with corrupt capitalism to create a melting pot of intrigue, opportunity, and adventure.<br/><br/>Located along what is commonly referred to as the Western Coastal Road (which runs from Sunset to the northwest to Lanthor in the far south), Eastport is part of the infamous Three Port Region long fought over by the Malakar Dominion, the fae of Landra&rsquo;Feya, Grayson&rsquo;s Grey Rangers, and the independent factions of the area.<br/><br/>A backer-created &quot;kingdom,&quot; Eastport is the creative contribution of David Vibbert, who rather brilliantly conceived a kind of high-fantasy version of New Orleans. Sean had an immense amount of fun expanding this concept into the complete city-state product you now have here, which includes: <br/><br/>    A complex tapestry of culture and society within a city run by trade and corruption.<br/>    A concise, yet rich history of Five Families and their dramatic influence on the past, present, and future of this vital seaport.<br/>    Numerous factions, and all the story arcs that might evolve from their interactions.<br/>    A complete Denizens section, featuring write ups of key figures and the unique kinds of threats one might face in the city streets, or perhaps out on the seas.<br/>    A useful sidebar on the matter of formalized duels within an urban setting.<br/>    A brief description of Illiana's Point, a lighthouse-based village created by fellow backer Anders A. Olsen.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Eastport will be useful to anyone running fantasy games where a seedy, complex river-and-sea port comes into play.<br/><br/>"}, "187158": {"rpgitemversion": {"289771": "PDF version"}, "poll": {}, "name": "Magic & Cosmology Volume I: Light and Life", "rpgproducer": {"81594": "Gayle Reick"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2728590.jpg", "usersrated": "0", "rpgsetting": {"2118": "Shaintar"}, "average": "0", "statistics": {}, "rpggenre": {"155": "Fantasy (High Fantasy)"}, "rpg": {"286": "Savage Worlds"}, "rpgcategory": {"2108": "Sourcebook (rules/options to enhance play)"}, "rpgseries": {"28756": "Shaintar Guidebook"}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2728590_t.jpg", "description": "From publisher blurb:<br/><br/>Every story has a beginning.<br/><br/>The beginning of the story of Shaintar is an epic all its own...<br/><br/>&quot;As vast and imposing as the Kal-A-Nar Empire is to the people of Shaintar, it is but a speck in the eye of the giant that was the Empire of the Starfather.

It makes your sin no worse as I conceive, to do it &agrave; la mode and stylishly.&rdquo; <br/>Anthony Hope, The Prisoner of Zenda<br/><br/>Heroic deeds of derring-do are often done without armor in fantasy and fiction. Yet role-playing is often tied to its wargame roots, making warriors lumbering mountains of steel. Taking inspiration from fighting legends around the world, Unarmored and Dangerous introduces styles of martial arts made for the unarmored or lightly armored warrior; mystic ascetics, canny fencers, daredevils of luck and charm, and scarred warriors simply to tough to die. Finally, it develops magic used as a defense for true high-fantasy. The focus is on unarmored defense using weapons. Unarmed combat is covered for styles that use it.<br/><br/>This is presented in over 30 easy-to-use archetypes for most classes as well as five full classes, the boxer, fencer, lin kuei, mystic dancer, and swordmage.<br/><br/>Unarmored and Dangerous allows a campaign where every character of every class is a martial artist, each different in style and execution. It is not a list of esoteric moves for monks, rather it is a robust set of rules for making tough heroes without cramping their style with armor, while not outshining those who chose to encase themselves in steel.<br/><br/>"}, "187172": {"rpgitemversion": {"289789": "PDF Version"}, "statistics": {}, "name": "Intrigue sur 10 sc\u00e9narios: le Safran d'Or", "rpgproducer": {"86570": "Hugo Garcia-Cotte"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2729445.jpg", "usersrated": "0", "average": "0", "rpggenre": {"961": "Fantasy"}, "rpg": {"28757": "Prima"}, "rpgcategory": {"2084": "Scenario / Adventure / Module"}, "poll": {}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2729445_t.jpg", "description": "De l'introduction:<br/><br/>Cette campagne contient tous les types de sc&eacute;narios typiques de Prima.<br/><br/>Le Meneur de Jeu doit se sentir totalement libre d'interpr&eacute;ter Prima comme il le souhaite, ces sc&eacute;narios ne<br/>servent qu'&agrave; aider un Meneur de Jeu d&eacute;butant peinant &agrave; cr&eacute;er de nouveaux sc&eacute;narios.<br/><br/>Prima est l&eacute;g&egrave;rement diff&eacute;rent des autres jeux car les joueurs ont en leur possession de tr&egrave;s nombreux moyens<br/>d'arriver &agrave; leur fins.<br/><br/>Il est donc tr&egrave;s difficile de pr&eacute;voir lin&eacute;airement ce qu'ils vont faire.<br/><br/>"}, "187173": {"rpg": {"4630": "ICONS"}, "poll": {}, "name": "Hauptman Klaue", "rpgproducer": {"24742": "Jacob Blackmon"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2728575.jpg", "usersrated": "0", "rpgitemversion": {"289790": "PDF version"}, "average": "0", "statistics": {}, "rpggenre": {"171": "Action / Adventure (Superheroes)"}, "rpgcategory": {"2108": "Sourcebook (rules/options to enhance play)"}, "rpgseries": {"28088": "Jacob E.

While game-rule information and special powers are clearly delinated, the monster&rsquo;s history, true nature and motivations aren&rsquo;t. Instead, reports from the field, written by adventurers who&rsquo;ve survived an encounter with the beast give first-hand, though often fragmentary and sometimes contradictory, information. The rationale is that even if your players have read the statblocks for the new creatures in this sourcebook, they still don&rsquo;t<br/>know everything about the monster. The game master is free to improvise, expand and extrapolate as desired to build a unique encounter around one of these powerful and intriguing new beasts.<br/><br/>The Nemesis Bestiary series takes an interesting piece of stock art and builds a new creature around the art, rather than commissioning art after the text is written. The first volume of the Nemesis Bestiary quickly assembled a roster of unique new fantasy monsters, which Volumes Two and Three expanded upon. This printed volume collects all the fascinating creatures found within these three volumes and more, building an entire ecosystem of dangerous beasts and extra-planar horrors.<br/><br/>These monsters are intended for use in any generic fantasy campaign played using either the Pathfinder Roleplaying Game or your favorite iteration of the D20 system, and most of the creatures can easily be imported to any of Otherverse Game&rsquo;s campaign settings. These reatures might be the horrors of the Tatakama or Black Else in Black Tokyo or highly specialized alien predators or techno-magical wonders in Heavy Future, Psi-Watch or Otherverse America.<br/><br/>"}, "187194": {"rpg": {"25418": "5e Game System Product (D&D 5th Edition Compatible)"}, "statistics": {}, "name": "The Marksman", "rpgitemversion": {"289834": "PDF version"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2729310.jpg", "usersrated": "0", "rpgsetting": {"3934": "Feudal Lords"}, "rpgproducer": {"24480": "Joshua Raynack"}, "rpggenre": {"155": "Fantasy (High Fantasy)"}, "average": "0", "rpgcategory": {"2108": "Sourcebook (rules/options to enhance play)"}, "poll": {}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2729310_t.jpg", "description": "From publisher blurb:<br/><br/>This product provides Players and Game Masters with the following for thrilling play:<br/><br/>    Marksman, a ranger archetype for 5th Edition.<br/>    Firearm Expert feat.<br/>    New 5th Edition nonplayer characters: Arbalester, Arbalester Captain, Groom, and Widowmaker. <br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Although designed for the Feudal Lords Campaign Setting, this product easily adapts into your favorite campaign.<br/><br/>"}, "187195": {"rpgitemversion": {"289835": "PDF version"}, "rpgseries": {"24624": "Universal Adventures"}, "name": "Universal Adventures Encounter Pack: Ghastly Encounters", "rpgproducer": {"58723": "Walter J.

The operation, however, hung on a slender thread: the lone supply line for the breakout ran through Avranches.

Four panzer divisions were gathered near the ancient village of Mortain, intending to take the town and the nearby Hill 317 before driving west. In their way stood the US 30th Infantry Division.

It can also be of use in pulp, superheroes (lots of objects that can be thrown around for supers fights), or even post-apocalyptic survival games (The location is not ruined, but a scouring over an abandoned gas station is definitely within the genre).<br/><br/>One idea for the map is to use it with Cabin in the Wilderness. Last Chance is the last gas station before the group gets to the cabin. The locals tell a tale of constant murders near the cabin after a couple that lived in the cabin died under mysterious circumstances, but by their rough country manner, the group may suspect them of possibly being the perpetrators. An interesting twist might be to have these characters come in guns blazing and help them fight the monster after being suspicious of them earlier.<br/><br/>Adventure hook for use with this map:<br/><br/>Last Stop: Being the only gas station in fifty miles has its advantages when the local police look the other way on your activities. The gas station full service fuel attendant pretends to be friendly and points customers inside the gas station. While they are inside he fuels up their vehicle, smiles and waves as they pay. Meanwhile, he slashes a tire or causes other damage to their car to get it to malfunction and be unable to pull out of the gas station. After the customers leave the general store, they find their vehicles unable to move, forcing them to pay extra for garage repair fees and in the worst cases, they have to stay in the local motel while their car is fixed in the garage.<br/><br/>The Player Characters can get involved as a group of detectives sent by a higher governmental police agency (Such as county, state police, or even F.B.I.) assigned to investigate a rash of murders in the local motel. They could also be private detectives hired to investigate the murder of a particular victim.

Each Attribute has two numeric ratings - a Maximum Percentage Value (does not change during play) and a Current Percentage Value (changes during play).  These values range from 0 to 99%; new characters generally start with 1% in all categories though some may vary.  Characters also have addition data points, including: Real Age, Human Age, Age, Sex, Height &amp; Weight, Total Body Fat%, Total Fat Weight, Movement % Bonus, and Weight Encumbrance % (some are derived, some are generated).  Characters gain Achievements during play (about 2000 Achievements per typical adventure), and every 1,000 Achievements yields a single Level.  Levels can be assigned to any Attribute, each Level raising an Attribute's Maximum Percentage Value by 1%.  The rules suggest characters play through Levels 1-1000 (thus, through 1,000,000 Achievements).<br/><br/>Characters also learn new Skills called Capabilities.  These are vaguely defined and (apparently) keep secret by the Game Master.<br/><br/>Combat is equally cumbersome and involves numerous lengthy calculations to determine initiative and hits.  For example, weapons have four qualities:  length, bluntness, damage force, and penetration.  These combine in various ways under various special circumstances to influence hit chance and damage potential.  Melee attacks use a different resolution mechanism than ranged attacks.  Characters will typically start with 3-25 Damage Status Points (Hit Points).  As simple weapon hits may do upwards of 500 Damage Points on critical strikes it is obvious that characters probably will not survive through 1,000,000 Achievements.<br/><br/>"}, "187253": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2320036.jpg", "poll": {}, "boardgamedesigner": {"122": {"name": "Andrew Looney"}}, "statistics": {}, "boardgamecompilation": {"169840": "Fruitcake Fun Pack"}, "yearpublished": "2014", "maxplayers": "6", "boardgamepublisher": {"76": {"name": "Looney Labs"}}, "maxplaytime": "60", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2320036_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "30", "boardgamecategory": {"1002": {"name": "Card Game"}}, "description": "This was part of the Fruitcake Fun Pack, the Looney Labs Holiday Gift for 2014.

Each game uses the same set of rules, with vastly different parameters, start points, characters, and finales. Players take on the roles of directors outside the action and characters inside the action, using the ebb and flow of four different scene-framing styles (vignettes, interrogations, interludes, and ensembles) to tell meaningful stories about characters in crisis.<br/>Each game in the Protocol series is zero-prep for 3 or more players. The game length is exponentially long, so games with more players take more time to complete. The Protocol Series requires a deck of poker cards as well as tokens to track drama points.<br/><br/>"}, "187265": {"rpg": {"9041": "Mutants & Masterminds (3rd Edition)"}, "poll": {}, "name": "Blackheart", "rpgproducer": {"26597": "Eloy Lasanta"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2730639.jpg", "usersrated": "0", "rpgitemversion": {"289943": "PDF version"}, "average": "0", "statistics": {}, "rpggenre": {"171": "Action / Adventure (Superheroes)"}, "rpgcategory": {"2108": "Sourcebook (rules/options to enhance play)"}, "rpgseries": {"3516": "The Algernon Files"}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2730639_t.jpg", "description": "From publisher blurb:<br/><br/>Not all heroes play nice.

The setting is infused with Manga elements.  Players may choose to play multiple characters.  The game uses D6 and D12 and a stripped pack of playing cards.  One player is called the Dealer (Game Master), who deals cards, rolls (randomizes) scenes, and breaks ties.  Otherwise, the game is a shared narrative.<br/><br/>Characters have a gender and a concept, as well as Virtues (Attributes) including:  Honor, Cunning, Discernment, Passion, Style, Beauty, and Prowess.  Virtues can be randomized or purchase from a point pool, as desired.  Characters also have three Specialties (Skills) which are player-defined, and three Secrets.  During play whenever two dice are rolled and match (e.g., a 1 and a 1, or a 6 and a 6) one or two cards are laid and the cards determine the generic sort of action which next occurs (e.g., &quot;Going Steady:  Elevate a friend to an SO, or an SO to a True Love&quot;).<br/><br/>For any non-trivial action, dice are rolled and compared to an appropriate Virtue.  &quot;Rolling under&quot; the Virtue indicates success.  Modifiers apply upon the Dealer's determination.

Use teamwork, strategy, and a wee bit of luck to win the day.<br/><br/>The game has plenty of in-jokes and references for Dresden fans (like the unreliable range of the Blue Beetle), but it&rsquo;s accessible to people who haven&rsquo;t read the books.<br/><br/>This is a tightly tuned, strategic, cooperative game that feels intense, vital, and a little bit risky (thanks to dice and other factors) throughout play. At 30 minutes per session, gameplay is fast-paced and down to the wire.  In this game, players take on the role of Harry Dresden and his allies, investigating cases and taking on foes from the books. To accomplish this, you'll share a common pool of action points (called Fate points), and each player must choose between taking an action or generating Fate points each turn. Solve more cases than there are foes left standing to win!<br/><br/>In short, each player plays a character from the novels (one of them is always Harry), taking on a shuffled scenario deck based on one of the books in the series. Using a combination of cards, dice, and teamwork, players attack foes, investigate cases, take advantages, and overcome obstacles to make sure they have the best possible odds for a win in the final showdown at the end of the book! Like any good cooperative game, it's hard to win (no fun if there's no challenge!), but always rewarding to play, and scales smoothly from one to five players.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "1", "boardgameversion": {"289952": "English first edition"}, "average": "7.34894", "name": "The Dresden Files Cooperative Card Game", "playingtime": "30", "boardgamemechanic": {"2001": "Action Point Allowance System"}, "age": "13", "boardgameexpansion": {}, "usersrated": "567", "boardgamefamily": {"8374": "Crowdfunding: Kickstarter"}}, "187274": {"statistics": {}, "name": "Pyramid (Volume 3, Issue 84 - Oct 2015)", "rpgproducer": {"13024": "Justin De Witt"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2737505.jpg", "usersrated": "0", "average": "0", "rpgissue": {"2109": "Pyramid"}, "rpgissuearticle": {"164573": "About GURPS"}, "rpg": {"332": "GURPS (4th Edition)"}, "rpgissueversion": {"289953": "PDF Version"}, "poll": {}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2737505_t.jpg", "description": "Bring a Whole New Perspective to Your GURPS Game!<br/><br/>Sometimes the most amazing thing you can do with your gaming is to look at things from a new angle, shake things up, and challenge your perspectives.

Unfortunately you can't just grab them for yourself as everyone in the neighborhood wants to claim those adorable kitties. Outwit your fellow feline fiends as you lure cats onto your property, move cats into your house, and steal cats from your neighbors. All's fair in love and cat-collecting!<br/><br/>In the game, each player chooses a Property board, which contains three zones: the Yard, the Porch, and the House. At the end of the game, cats in the House are worth 5 points each, cats on the Porch are worth 3 points each, and cats in your Yard are worth 0 points. However, having cats in your Yard does have advantages for special scoring conditions, such as having the most cats of a single color or the most cats overall. All 40 cat miniatures are placed in the center of the table, and represent the Neighborhood. Each player is dealt 2 or 3 cards, depending on the number of players in the game.<br/><br/>On each player's turn, they perform two Actions: moving a cat, playing a card, or discarding cards. Cats can be moved 1 space for 1 Action, by picking up the cat and putting it in the next zone of the property. For example, a cat can be moved from the Neighborhood to the Yard for 1 Action, or from the Yard to the Porch or from the Porch to the Yard (and vice versa). Playing cards may allow a player to move multiple cats at once, to move cats multiple spaces, to steal cats from opponents, or to make opponents give up cats. A player may also choose to discard 1, 2, or 3 cards as an Action. Once both Actions have been taken, the player draws back up to a full hand, and play passes to the person to the left. If an Instant card (red border) is drawn, it is played immediately and affects the entire group. The player then draws a replacement card for the Instant card until a full hand is achieved.<br/><br/>The final round is triggered when a player draws the last card from the draw pile. From that point every player, including the player who drew the last card, has one final turn to maximize their score. Then, the cats are counted and a winner is lauded for their purr-procurement proficiency.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "3", "boardgameversion": {"289976": "English first edition"}, "average": "6.36259", "name": "Here, Kitty, Kitty!", "playingtime": "30", "age": "10", "boardgameexpansion": {}, "usersrated": "278", "boardgamefamily": {"22783": "Admin: Better Description Needed!"}}, "187290": {"rpgitemversion": {"289977": "PDF Version"}, "statistics": {}, "name": "Shay\u014d: Kit d'initiation", "rpgproducer": {"17104": "Florrent"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2835161.jpg", "usersrated": "0", "average": "0", "rpggenre": {"940": "Action / Adventure"}, "rpg": {"28780": "Shay\u014d"}, "rpgcategory": {"2622": "Quick Start / Fast Play Rules"}, "poll": {}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2835161_t.jpg", "description": "Publisher's blurb:<br/><br/>Devastated a long time ago by the Tenbatsu [divine wrath], ruthless samurai, wandering techs looking for relics of the ancient world, blind priestesses or mad exorcists, messengers traveling across the wastelands, the characters swore allegiance to the neo-shogunate, the only power now able to protect the land from the fearsome oni and mutants.<br/><br/>Will you save the empire from the ghosts of the past?<br/><br/>"}, "187291": {"rpgitemversion": {"289980": "DOC Version"}, "poll": {}, "name": "Player's Guide (1st Edition)", "rpgproducer": {"86621": "Alan Conroy"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2731932.jpg", "usersrated": "0", "average": "0", "statistics": {}, "rpg": {"28779": "Quasar"}, "rpgcategory": {"2083": "Core Rules (min needed to play)"}, "rpggenre": {"183": "Science Fiction"}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2731932_t.jpg", "description": "From the preface:<br/><br/>Quasar is a Science Fiction role-playing game.

The play takes place via the imagination, where the GM is responsible for setting up the atmosphere and resolving issues that come up during play.  Typically, a gaming session (or a series of sessions) are run by the GM under the guidance of a scenario.  The scenario is basically a story, of which only parts are made known to the players.  Additional information usually becomes available during the course of play.  The GM uses the scenario to set up the atmosphere, provide an adventuring hook, and determine what the characters see during play.  An adventuring hook is simply the means by which the characters are drawn into the scenario.  It could be as simple as someone hiring them for something, or as subtle as something happening around them, wherever they are.  The scenario defines locations, objects in those locations, creatures that occupy or pass through those locations, and NPC (non-player characters) which the players interact with.  It is the GM's job to adjust the reactions of the various creatures and NPCs depending upon the actions (or lack thereof) of the characters.<br/><br/>User summary:<br/><br/>The DOC, RTF, and HTML versions have identical content and vary only in minor formatting issues and file format.

After your home is destroyed, fairies help you build a new house. But since they will live there too, they walk around the new rooms having a good look.<br/><br/>Players take turns collecting room tiles and spells from the board and then follow a solitaire process of building and scoring. The tiles show four portals, but 0-4 exit arrows which allow the fairies to walk only one way. Players can only build off arrows, so building is always with a mind to the next walk to score points as well as keeping it legal.<br/><br/>Fairies will not walk through unfinished rooms, and rooms don't become available until the build time is spent. All the tiles have a build cost, and players add to this cost how many steps to the nearest bedroom, and how many rooms built this turn to get the final cost. This is marked on the room with tokens.<br/><br/>Then build time is taken off each room according to which season you chose on the board. If you picked Spring, you get only 1 new tile but take 3 off each build time; Summer and Autumn get you 2 tiles and 2 off build times; Winter gives you 3 tiles but only 1 off build times.

These characters are then sent on heists to try and overcome defense cards in front of objectives, using their different sets of skills to bypass guards, traps and walls to get to the filthy lucre that they're after.

Some monsters don't just prey on society from without, but have burrowed and wormed their way into the very heart of the civilized world, and twist and corrupt the very laws that are supposed to protect the innocent, using them to oppress and exploit them, instead. These evils are no less a threat than the ones that most adventurers face, but many PCs are ill-equipped to deal with them. This is a job for rebels.<br/><br/>This book presents five new rebellious archetypes for five different classes. Included are the freemage, an arcanist archetype for those who believe that magic should not serve the caster, but rather be allowed to act freely and anarchically, and who can gamble their magical power when casting spells, or turn their enemies' magic against them, the order of the broken tower, a cavalier order devoted to protecting the common folk against oppressive tyrants, who specializes in guerilla tactics and serves as an inspiration for rebellions, the green wilds rebel, a druid archetype for those who believe that nature should rise up and throw off the yoke of civilization, which can turn plants and animals against mankind, and is resistant to the lures of civilization, the revolutionary bloodline, for sorcerers born from revolution, which has a mix of powers allowing them to inspire others, and cause great damage with fires, and finally the martyrbond revolutionary, a spiritualist archetype for spiritualists whose phantoms were martyred in life, and who fight alongside their phantom to continue that rebellion.<br/><br/>Whether you're about to embark on a politically-themed campaign (such as the official Paizo adventure path focusing on revolution), or you just want a selection of exciting new abilities for passionate and freedom-loving PCs, this book has lots of tantalizing options to offer. Even GMs can get in on the fun, as several of the archetypes here are perfect for rebellious villains as well, and can make for exciting and memorable encounters.<br/><br/>"}, "187391": {"boardgamedesigner": {"278": {"name": "Terry Goodchild"}}, "poll": {}, "name": "Masters of the Tourist Trophy", "playingtime": "60", "minplayers": "1", "boardgamemechanic": {"2072": "Dice Rolling"}, "yearpublished": "2002", "usersrated": "0", "boardgamefamily": {"20717": "Sports: Motorcycle Racing"}, "maxplayers": "0", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2755181_t.jpg", "average": "0", "statistics": {}, "boardgamepublisher": {"1259": {"name": "Lambourne Games"}}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2755181.jpg", "boardgameversion": {"290270": "Owzat Games edition"}, "maxplaytime": "60", "boardgamecategory": {"1031": {"name": "Racing"}}, "age": "0", "minplaytime": "30", "description": "Masters of the Tourist Trophy is a motorcycle racing sports replay game simulating the Isle of Man Tourist Trophy. The Isle of Man TT has, for many years, been regarded as the most prestigious and oldest motorcycle race in the world... and also the most dangerous motorcycle road-race in the world!<br/><br/>Summary<br/><br/>The game is typical of Lambourne's sports replay simulations in that it takes place on tables and charts (no board or counters) with minimal player decisions required.<br/><br/>The simulation has been developed to capture the confused progress of the Isle of Man mountain bike races. With drivers setting off at different times, the system is able to record both the positions on the course from a spectator viewpoint as well as keep track of the actual driver times for determining a race winner. As in the actual Tourist Trophy, crashes and mishaps are common and not all riders can be expected to finish.<br/><br/>The game includes race control sheets for six different classes of race, from the ultra-lightweight 125cc bikes to the Formula One 1200cc monsters. The famous TT sidecars are also represented in a class of their own.<br/><br/>The drivers represented and rated are drawn from the &quot;all-time greats&quot; from over 100 years of Tourist Trophy events.<br/><br/>Brief outline of the Game System<br/><br/>The race is set up on a Race Control Sheet that lists Driver Name, Driver Rating and Start Time. For each stage of the race every driver rolls two pairs of dice (red and green) to advance their progress.<br/><br/>The difference between the green &quot;+&quot; and red &quot;-&quot; dice, when added to the driver performance rating, determine whether the driver performance improves or degrades on each stage of the lap. Comparison of the driver performance ratings will reveal the order of the drivers on the circuit as they pass each checkpoint on the circuit.<br/><br/>Rolling doubles on either pair of dice may improve or degrade the driver performance rating, but rolling double &quot;6&quot; requires a further roll on Rider Mistakes or Mechanical Trouble charts. Such problems usually result in a performance loss, but can also cause retirement through a crash or serious mechanical failure. Game charts will determine the precise location of each such accident on the circuit.<br/><br/>Drivers must also elect to Pit Stop at least once during the race. This can be dome at a time decided by the player and requires a die roll and chart reference to determine the effect the pit stop has on race time.<br/><br/>At the end of the lap the cumulative performance for each of the four lap stages can be cross-referenced against the game charts to determine the lap time and average speed for each driver on the circuit.<br/><br/>"}, "187392": {"rpg": {"356": "Generic / Universal"}, "poll": {}, "name": "The Tar Pits", "rpgproducer": {"72892": "J.

Finally, the umbral dragon graces these pages with its sleek shimmer-gloom, breathing darkness and devouring light. As if a dozen existing monsters were not enough, the mysterious shadowpeople exist forever on the edge of sight, their motives as much an enigma as their true face and form.

You will narrate a story of individuals facing their own obstacles and fears, and, together, you will find that the strength and support of your friends can help you overcome anything.<br/><br/>"}, "187461": {"rpgitemversion": {"290405": "PDF version"}, "statistics": {}, "name": "Dig Deep and Prosper (Mithril Mining Disaster)", "rpgproducer": {"65419": "Mark Thornton"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2735624.jpg", "usersrated": "0", "average": "0", "rpggenre": {"155": "Fantasy (High Fantasy)"}, "rpg": {"2313": "Tunnels & Trolls (7th - 7.5 Editions)"}, "rpgcategory": {"2136": "Solitaire Adventure"}, "poll": {}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2735624_t.jpg", "description": "From publisher blurb:<br/><br/>Dwarves were born to dig and that is why you have been sent from your home to a mithril mine outside a small town where disaster has struck.
