The choice is yours in this clever card game, featuring beautiful art by American painter Kwanchai Moriya.<br/><br/>Each round begins with the players drafting a hand of five or six character cards. On your turn, you must play a card either in front of you (your hometown) or in the middle of the table (the capital). When you play a card into the capital, you benefit from the card's special ability. Each character belongs to one of four professions, and their special abilities are:<br/><br/><br/>    Merchant: Take 1 gold coin. Gold coins can be used at the end of a round to increase your own limit for one of the four professions.<br/>    Agent: Draw a secret modifier card and add it (face down) to one of the four professions in the capital. This will affect the limit of the chosen profession at round's end.<br/>    Scholar: Draw a card from the deck into your hand.<br/>    Cleric: Move the lowest valued card of any profession from the capital into your hometown<br/><br/><br/>At the end of a round, for each profession, you are not allowed to have a higher total value in your hometown than the current total value in the capital. If you break the limit for one of the professions, you lose all cards of that profession from your hometown. At the end of the third round, all characters remaining in a player's hometown are worth points.<br/><br/>This means that for every card there's a dilemma of whether to add it to your hometown for possible points, or to the capital which not only gives you the benefit from a special ability, but also increases the potential points for all players.

The southern kingdoms stood to benefit the most from this invention but the northern kingdoms believed that the energy web could disrupt the structure of the world. In the end, they settled the issue in a terrible war that lasted eight years and the southern kingdoms won. It took a decade to realize how the energy web was sapping the power of the earth&rsquo;s magnetic fields. It took longer to realize how grave it would be. When the sun god opened up with all his wrath, the world was unprotected. Without warning, everything changed in a moment.<br/><br/>The night swallowed the sun. The ground shook.

The players may decide to work in teams and/or individually--the game is completed when the given quest(s) are all accomplished<br/><br/>~~~~~~~~~<br/><br/>GAMEPLAY<br/>Objective - The objective of Deck Quest is to accomplish the quest(s) created by the Game Master.<br/><br/>Steps - Deck Quest can be summed up as follows:   <br/>1. The Game Master crafts a quest(s) for the players to complete. The guide booklet provides advice on how to create such quests.  <br/>2. Players create their very own, customizeable characters by drawing cards from the Role Deck.<br/>3. Players adventure through different Locations and encounter various Adversaries on their way to complete the Game Master's quest(s).<br/>4. As players face different situations throughout the game, they must come up with ways to deal with each one until they accomplish their given quest(s).<br/><br/>Game Master - The Game Master's job is to weave together a fantasy setting for the players to explore:<br/>- Craft an engaging quest(s) for the game (e.g. Hunting down a powerful adversary, finding a unique item, etc).<br/>- Decide players' fates using character stats and die rolls (die roll guidelines are detailed in the guidebook).<br/>- Tell a story as players advance towards their quest goal.<br/><br/><br/>Players - In order to complete the Game Master's quest(s), players utilize their imaginations to overcome any obstacles in their paths:<br/>- Create their own unique character through drawing Role Cards.<br/>- Work together to accomplish the Game Master's quest(s).<br/>- Respond to situations and obstacles by coming up with creative solutions.<br/><br/>~~~~~~~~~<br/><br/>SOME ADVICE<br/>1 - Deck Quest is supposed to be flexible. Very flexible. There aren't any specific rules that would fail the game if bent. Essentially, players shouldn't feel like they need to limit themselves when they play. If you're faced with a tricky situation in the game, we encourage you to come up with the funniest, the cleverest, the absolutely stupidest way to get out of it.<br/>2 - The Game Master needs to be good. A good Game Master = a great play session. So, if you're ever the GM, keep this in mind: be funny, be [relatively] lax, and be creative. Be more creative than the players (I know, that's hard).

The old city walls have just been torn down, finally freeing the city's growth outward towards the old villages that surround it. Based on the plans by Cerd&agrave;, the construction of Barcelona's famous Eixample (Catalan for &quot;expansion&quot;) has begun. It is a period of great prosperity when the burgeoning upper middle class families found their fortunes and used their wealth to demonstrate their power by constructing unique buildings and supporting initiatives for the city's inhabitants. However, not everything is so pleasant in the city. Its prosperity is drawing more and more people to work in the big city, and revolutionary movements are taking hold among the city's unemployed workers.<br/><br/>Barcelona: The Rose of Fire is a board game for 2-4 players in which the players compete for social prestige and personal wealth while trying to avoid the revolution that is spreading through the city.<br/><br/>In more detail, the players take turns using cards to build their influence by constructing buildings (tiles) in the new city, outside the old medieval walls. The better and more spectacular the construction, the more notoriety they gain. But at the same time, this construction boon brings many workers who are living in much cheaper venues. Building high-class buildings, while rewarding in terms of prestige, may generate unrest amongst the popular classes. In order to avoid strikes and riots, players have to make sure that they construct buildings for the popular classes as well.<br/><br/>During the construction phase, players place workers in the Raval zone depending on the sort of buildings they construct. At the end of each era, all those workers are placed into a bag, alongside peacekeeping soldiers. Depending on the level of unrest, a number of these figures are drawn from the bag and the player with more figures drawn from their color suffers a strike.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": ["English/Spanish first edition", "Spanish-only first edition"], "average": "6.76937", "name": "Barcelona: The Rose of Fire", "playingtime": "90", "boardgamemechanic": ["Area Control / Area Influence", "Tile Placement"], "age": "10", "usersrated": "126", "boardgamefamily": ["Catalonia", "Cities: Barcelona (Spain)"], "boardgamepodcastepisode": ["#45: Six-Player Six Pack; Las Vegas on tap; Barcelona; Mystic Vale; Betrayal at the Brewery on the Hill", "19.

Faced with the threat of a Persian invasion, the players must cooperate to defend their civilization. However, the competition for wealth and resources is fierce, as simulated by an inventive action mechanism, and just like the Ancient Greeks, the players are likely to turn their weapons against each other instead.<br/><br/>The different player actions add talents from the stock to the hand and turn those talents into citizens on the board, engaging in peaceful trading or aggressive warfare. Once a player run out of stock, the player with the most citizens left on the board wins.<br/><br/>The game board consists of tiles representing city-states, colonies and diplomatic positions. The player markers represent either talents or citizens and control of the board is determined by area majority.<br/><br/>The players take turns to select actions from a common mancala style action board. They pick up the action markers in one action space and drop them one by one in the spaces of the actions they wish to take, paying a cost equal to the number of action markers already in there.<br/><br/>The actions can broadly be divided into four groups:<br/><br/>1) Acquire talents, either directly through taxes and levies or indirectly through import of resources that can later be exchanged for talents.<br/>2) Invest talents in buildings, providing action benefits, or diplomacy, providing war benefits.<br/>3) Turn talents into citizens, either to consolidate existing city-states or to expand to new city-states.<br/>4) Use citizens to attack other players or defend against the Persians.<br/><br/>The more citizens a player gets to the board, the more talents he or she may generate but the greater the risk if the Persians invade.<br/><br/>The unique action mechanism allows the player to optimize action combinations while at the same time blocking other players' actions by making them more expensive. This opens up several strategic paths, spanning from slow engine building to sudden seizures of area majorities.

The Chinese legendarium ranges from minor menaces like the mischievous xiao flying monkeys alongside apocalyptic aberrations like the horrific hundun, and it also features an array of misshapen composite creatures like the patchwork yaoguai and the terrifying jinmeju tree bearing a fruit of horrible heads. As if a dozen existing monsters were not enough, the brand-new nian is a powerful predator that haunts and hunts at the turn of the year, only to be driven back each Chinese New Year with fireworks and festivals. In addition to the featured creatures, we bring you an array of amazing artifacts and fantastic feats gifted from the imperial dragons of the Orient, each one suitable for mythic and non-mythic heroes alike!<br/><br/>"}, "205113": {"rpgartist": ["Leonardo da Vinci"], "rpgitemversion": ["PDF version"], "poll": [], "name": "Character Design: Lover, Player, Sidekick", "rpgdesigner": ["Berin Kinsman"], "rpggenre": ["Generic / Universal"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3114794.jpg", "usersrated": "0", "rpgproducer": ["Berin Kinsman"], "statistics": [], "rpg": ["Generic / Universal"], "rpgpublisher": ["Dancing Lights Press"], "average": "0", "rpgcategory": ["Non-Game Book (but RPG Related)"], "rpgseries": ["Building Characters"], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3114794_t.jpg", "description": "From publisher blurb:<br/><br/>A RESOURCE FOR BETTER ROLEPLAYING<br/>There are scores of sourcebooks providing classes, templates, and models for characters based on the categories of powers and abilities they possess.

Each location builds on a fantastic theme, such as a mysterious ancient structure under the ice, a cursed castle of a mad king, a fallen celestial fortress, and a dwarven mine that cracked into the tomb of a dead god. Each location includes artwork by Brian Patterson of D20Monkey. Sometimes this artwork takes the form of maps. Sometimes it's an overlook of a specific location.<br/><br/>These sites and structures aren&rsquo;t full adventures.

You may build a level of the wonder or a building by paying its resource cost from your supply; your workers mark individual buildings as you build them, unlocking abilities. Finally, you may sell pairs of matching goods to the supply in exchange for coins. Coins can be used as a wild resource, but they also appear in the cost of some wonders. Resources sold or used to build are returned to the supply bag.<br/><br/>In games of four or more players, players may also trade. Trading occurs off-turn, that is, it can involve anyone except the active player. You may negotiate and trade freely with other players, but you must stop negotiating once you receive the supply bag and become the active player.

Gedrick Averness fell just before the Emperor&rsquo;s army arrived to finish off the undead horde and save the town Gedrick had given his life protecting.

Acquiring trade goods is very quick and simple. Players<br/>draft cards from a deck of goods and add them to their hands. The first player draws cards equal to twice the number of players (for example, 6 cards for a 3 player game) chooses one and passes the rest to the next player. The rest of the players do the same, except for the last. The last player, chooses 2 cards then passes the rest to the previous player. This happens until the first player takes the last remaining card. (example: Nick, John and Mary have 6 cards to draft. Nick goes first chooses 1, then passes 5 cards to John. John also chooses 1, then passes 4 cards to Mary. Mary chooses 2 then passes 2 cards to John. John chooses 1 then passes the last card to Nick.)<br/><br/>During the 2nd phase, players deploy their trade goods gathered from the 1st phase on planets of their choice.

The game's innovative mechanisms combine dice-driven combat with faction-driven hand management. Straightforward rules make the game easy to learn, but also enable deep strategic thinking and clever deck-building. Players can create decks that include characters from every faction and any era, as long as heroes and villains are on opposite sides of the fight. For example, Padm&eacute; Amidala might fight alongside Rey and Finn, taking on Jabba the Hutt, Kylo Ren, and Jango Fett.<br/><br/>Each round, you use your characters' abilities, an assortment of dice, and a carefully constructed thirty-card deck filled with events, upgrades, and supports. You and your opponent alternate actions: activating your dice, playing cards from your hand, attacking your foes, and claiming the battlefield. You need to prove your skills and defeat your opponent's characters to claim your destiny!<br/><br/>At launch in November 2016, Star Wars: Destiny consists of two starter sets &mdash; Rey and Kylo Ren, each with nine dice and 24 cards &mdash; and the Awakenings booster packs, each containing one die and five cards.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": ["Awakenings Booster Pack - English first edition", "Caja de inicio: Kylo Ren - Spanish First Edition", "Caja de inicio: Rey - Spanish First Edition", "Despertares: sobres de ampliaci\u00f3n - Spanish First Edition", "Erwachen Booster-Pack Heidelberger German Edition", "French first edition", "Hungarian Awakenings Booster", "Hungarian Kylo Ren Starter", "Hungarian Rey Starter", "Kylo Ren Starter Set - English first edition", "Kylo Ren Starter-Set Heidelberger German Edition", "Polish first edition", "Polish first edition", "Polish first edition", "Rey Starter Set - English first edition", "Rey Starter-Set  Heidelberger German Edition", "Star Wars: Destiny - Awakenings Booster Pack (Italian edition)", "Star Wars: Destiny \u2010 Kylo Ren Starter Set (Italian edition)", "Star Wars: Destiny \u2010 Rey Starter Set (Italian edition)"], "average": "8.15702", "name": "Star Wars: Destiny", "playingtime": "30", "boardgamemechanic": ["Dice Rolling", "Hand Management", "Variable Player Powers"], "age": "10", "boardgameexpansion": ["218553", "218547", "218550", "218017"], "usersrated": "1768", "boardgamesubdomain": ["Customizable Games"], "boardgamefamily": ["CCGs (Collectible Card Games)", "CDGs (Collectible Dice Games)", "Star Wars", "Star Wars: Destiny"], "boardgamepodcastepisode": ["Episode 89- Great Western Trail and 2017 Predictions/Resolutions", "Episode 90- The Oracle of Delphi and Wisdom Check 4 (with Stephen Buonocore, plus CONTEST)", "Episode 91- The Manhattan Project: Energy Empire", "Episode 95- RobbCon 2017", "Gen Con 2016 Finale", "MN 0140 Hot Games and News from BGG.Con 2016", "RDTN Episode 108: Star Wars Destiny, Paris Connection in the 4th Anniversary Show", "Star Wars Destiny CCG Review", "Strange Assembly 205 - 2016 Wrap-Up", "Strange Assembly 208 - Reformation", "The Good The Board and The Man Who Loves Most of It: Episode 94 \u201cJonathan\u2019s Top 10 of 2016\u2033"]}, "205360": {"rpgdesigner": ["J.

The game system is similar to the game system used in Stringbag, which appeared in Panzer Digest #13.  Players take the role of one (or a group) of torpedo bombers and fly through flak to deliver torpedoes against enemy warships.<br/><br/>Includes eight-page illustrated rule booklet, two identical Reference Cards, and one counter sheet with individually rated warplanes. (Counters must be cut apart prior to play.)  Optional rules are provided as well. There are five historical scenarios that come with the game:  Taranto 1940 (involving British Fairey Swordfish planes), Bismarck 1941 (Swordfish), Pearl Harbor 1941 (with Japanese B5N Kates), Force Z 1941 (Japanese G3M Nells and G4M Bettys), and Midway 1942 (American Devastators).<br/><br/>This is a small solitaire game, that plays quickly, so it is ideal for short play sessions, overnight business trips, or tray table action while flying. All you need to do is supply a regular deck of cards, a six-sided die, the supplied plane counters and Reference Cards, and an imagination, and you are in business. Like other Minden designs, Torpedo Raiders delivers high playability and historicity for you to enjoy.<br/><br/>World War II torpedo bombing attacks create an exciting narrative for a wargame. The theater of your imagination--along with the straightforward mechanics of this game system--will bring these raids to life on your tabletop.<br/><br/>"}, "205375": {"rpgdesigner": ["Rapha\u00ebl Bombayl", "Philippe Tessier"], "rpgitemversion": ["Hardcover Version"], "statistics": [], "name": "Game Master Screen  (Polaris)", "rpgartist": ["Simon Labrousse"], "rpgproducer": ["David Burckle", "Laura Hoffmann"], "rpg": ["Polaris (French RPG, 3rd Edition)"], "usersrated": "0", "rpggenre": ["Action / Adventure (Nautical)", "Modern (Near Future)"], "rpgpublisher": ["Black Book Editions"], "rpgcategory": ["Accessory (dice, maps, screens, cards)"], "poll": [], "average": "0", "description": "For the Polaris RPG.

Like most RPGs, Title Goes Here has layers, the top being the players gathered together to play the game, and lower in the layer of the roles, in this case scholars who have, likewise, gathered to delve into a great work.<br/><br/>Unlike many RPGs, however, Title Goes Here adds a few more levels beneath the world of these scholars. The next lowest level is that of the great work, usually a book, but it could be an epic poem, a movie, or a shadow puppet play. Here the story of this work is taken and retold, from different perspective, different decodings, and different meanings. At this level each player has a character from the work, championed by a scholar played by that same player. The lowest level, is that of truths, fundamental ideas which are represented by the arguments of the scholar, the actions of the character, and by the decisions of the player. Indeed, this truth brings the layers full circle, acting as player commentary on the game in progress.<br/><br/>Each player has a character sheet, which when correctly folded can reveal one of three faces to the other players. You show which layer you are currently working in, by the face of your sheet. If your introspects face you, then you are in the layer of the scholars, commenting on the fictional work. If your inspects face you, then you are in the layer of the characters, acting within your own version of the story. If your aspects face you, then you are in the layer of truths and players, speaking about the game itself and what you wish to accomplish.<br/><br/>In each layer it is important to keep within your role, but there are ways during the game that you can change which layer you are using and there are ways for other players to shift your layer as well. This happens when your sheet rotates to show the correct face.<br/><br/>"}, "205398": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3119514.jpg", "boardgameimplementation": ["Citadels", "Citadels:  The Dark City"], "poll": [], "boardgamedesigner": ["Bruno Faidutti"], "statistics": [], "yearpublished": "2016", "maxplayers": "8", "boardgameartist": ["Andrew Bosley", "Simon Eckert"], "boardgamepublisher": ["999 Games", "Asmodee", "Edge Entertainment", "Hans im Gl\u00fcck Verlags-GmbH", "Windrider Games"], "maxplaytime": "60", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3119514_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "30", "boardgamecategory": ["Bluffing", "Card Game", "City Building", "Fantasy", "Medieval"], "description": "In Citadels, players take on new roles each round to represent characters they hire in order to help them acquire gold and erect buildings. The game ends at the close of a round in which a player erects their eighth building. Players then tally their points, and the player with the highest score wins.<br/><br/>Players start the game with a number of building cards in their hand; buildings come in five colors, with the purple buildings typically having a special ability and the other colored buildings providing a benefit when you play particular characters. At the start of each round, the player who was king the previous round discards one of the eight character cards at random, chooses one, then passes the cards to the next player, etc. until each player has secretly chosen a character. Each character has a special ability, and the usefulness of any character depends upon your situation, and that of your opponents. The characters then carry out their actions in numerical order: the assassin eliminating another character for the round, the thief stealing all gold from another character, the wizard swapping building cards with another player, the warlord optionally destroys a building in play, and so on.<br/><br/>On a turn, a player earns two or more gold (or draws two building cards then discards one), then optionally constructs one building (or up to three if playing the architect this round). Buildings cost gold equal to the number of symbols on them, and each building is worth a certain number of points. In addition to points from buildings, at the end of the game a player scores bonus points for having eight buildings or buildings of all five colors.<br/><br/>The 2016 edition of Citadels includes twenty-seven characters &mdash; eight from the original Citadels, ten from the Dark City expansion, and nine new ones &mdash; along with thirty unique building districts, and the rulebook includes six preset lists of characters and districts beyond the starter list, each crafted to encourage a different style and intensity of gameplay.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": ["Dutch first edition", "English edition 2016", "French first edition", "German first edition", "Italian first edition", "Spanish first edition"], "name": "Citadels (2016 edition)", "playingtime": "60", "boardgamemechanic": ["Card Drafting", "Set Collection", "Variable Phase Order", "Variable Player Powers"], "age": "10", "usersrated": "506", "average": "7.72215", "boardgamepodcastepisode": ["Episode 192"]}, "205399": {"rpgartist": ["(Uncredited)"], "rpgitemversion": ["PDF Version"], "poll": [], "name": "Tragedy", "rpgdesigner": ["Shreyas Sampat", "Eva Schiffer"], "rpgproducer": ["Aaron Pavao", "Eva Schiffer"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3120141.jpg", "usersrated": "0", "average": "0", "statistics": [], "rpggenre": ["Social (Relationships / Romance)"], "rpgpublisher": ["(Web published)"], "rpg": ["Tragedy"], "rpgcategory": ["Core Rules (min needed to play)"], "rpgseries": ["Reverse Engineering RPG Challenge"], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3120141_t.jpg", "description": "From the introduction:<br/><br/>In order to play Tragedy you will need access to a printer, scrap paper, pencils, scissors, tape, and a deck of standard playing cards.

On a turn, you get to take only two actions, one for you and one for the spouse, from all the possibilities you'll find on a farm: collecting resources; building meadows; and so on. You might think about having kids in order to get more work accomplished, but first you need to expand your house. And what are you going to feed all the little rugrats?<br/><br/>Agricola is a turn-based game. There are 14 game rounds occurring in 6 stages, with a Harvest at the end of each stage (after Rounds 4, 7, 9, 11, 13, and 14).<br/>Each player starts with two meeples that can each take an action per round. There are multiple options, and while the game progresses, you'll have more: each round a (fixed) additional option becomes available.

The Gooseberry does not know which of the sixteen subjects is the secret and the other players do not know who is the Gooseberry.  The goal of the Gooseberry is to remain hidden and figure out the secret subject while all the other players are trying to keep the secret hidden and find the Gooseberry.<br/><br/>A code card is dealt to each player, with one player receiving the Gooseberry card that has no code. Players use the code to identify the correct subject word. Everyone prepares in their mind a ONE WORD clue related to the secret subject.  The challenge is to choose a clue that shows other players that you know the secret subject but is not so obvious that it reveals the secret to the Gooseberry.  When all players have prepared their clue and are ready, each player, in clockwise order and without hesitation, says out loud the clue they have prepared.<br/><br/>Players may now discuss, question and accuse each other.  When ready everyone votes on who they think is the Gooseberry. The Gooseberry wins if either they are not correctly identified or if they can guess the correct subject word.<br/><br/>The rules are currently only available in English.

Although the classic Rider Waite deck is a great pick, you may find it helpful to find a deck that is thematically close to the type of story you want to tell.<br/><br/>"}, "205463": {"rpgartist": ["(Uncredited)"], "rpgitemversion": ["Stage 1 RTF Version", "Stage 2 RTF Version", "Stage 3 PDF Version"], "rpgseries": ["#Threeforged RPG Design Challenge 2015"], "name": "Friends of the Venom Spider", "rpgdesigner": ["Sangjun Park", "Remko van der Pluijm", "Werner Waage"], "rpgproducer": ["Remko van der Pluijm"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3120218.jpg", "usersrated": "0", "average": "0", "statistics": [], "rpg": ["Friends of the Venom Spider"], "rpgpublisher": ["(Web published)"], "poll": [], "rpgcategory": ["Core Rules (min needed to play)"], "rpggenre": ["Social (Relationships / Romance)"], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3120218_t.jpg", "description": "From the introduction:<br/><br/>A short role playing game where you try to figure out who your friends really are, or how to best end them.<br/>...<br/>This game can be interpreted so that everything related to insects is a metaphor, personally I view it as little people in a schoolyard where some are strong bullies, and some are smart but weak and has to act accordingly.

You win by building up your hero, scouting gang dens to find the baddies who wronged you, then taking bloody revenge through action-packed fight sequences made up of dice based puzzles.<br/><br/>Vengeance alternates between montage turns and fight turns.  In montage turns, players heal and upgrade their heroes through new abilities and items. They also go out scouting gang dens to find the bosses who wronged them and take revenge on them in the fight turn.<br/><br/>The fight turn is the heart of the game. Players pick one of the scouted gang dens containing a boss who has wronged them and burst into the gang den to exact bloody revenge. Players gain VPs for killing the boss, clearing the den from all the minions or, for maximum points, both. Players have three turns to do this and get out of the den in one piece.<br/><br/>Fights are basically dice-based puzzles. In each round of the fight, players roll a set of dice and decide the order in which they play the rolled results. Upgrade skills and items allow players to swap die-results for others or string together a number of results to perform enemy-slapping combos. Upgrades thus work towards mitigating the luck of the die-roll, giving players more control over their Fight actions.<br/><br/>Players score points by killing bosses who wronged them, i.e., matching the figure on their vengeance card with one of the face down Boss cards attached to each den and/or by clearing all minions of a gang which matches the color of a vengeance card they have in play.<br/><br/>At the end of the game players also score bonus victory points through three mission cards in play.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "1", "boardgameversion": ["English first edition"], "average": "8.59259", "name": "Vengeance", "playingtime": "120", "boardgamemechanic": ["Area Movement", "Card Drafting", "Dice Rolling", "Modular Board", "Set Collection", "Storytelling", "Variable Player Powers"], "age": "14", "usersrated": "27", "boardgamefamily": ["Admin: Unreleased Games", "Crowdfunding: Kickstarter"], "boardgamepodcastepisode": ["Cult of the New Board Game Podcast Episode 028 \u2013 10 Games for Essen", "Episode #31 \u2013 Vengeance"]}, "205478": {"boardgamedesigner": ["\u00d3scar Ar\u00e9valo"], "average": "6.74595", "poll": [], "name": "Covenant", "playingtime": "45", "minplayers": "3", "boardgamemechanic": ["Hand Management", "Memory"], "yearpublished": "2016", "usersrated": "37", "maxplayers": "5", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3210583_t.jpg", "boardgameartist": ["V\u00edctor P\u00e9rez Corbella"], "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["Gen-X Games"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3210583.jpg", "boardgameversion": ["English/Spanish first edition"], "maxplaytime": "45", "boardgamecategory": ["Murder/Mystery"], "age": "10", "minplaytime": "20", "description": "Description from the designer:<br/><br/>A covenant with Death is not always a good deal.

As with the later Tobi-Sugoroku (and Mawari-Sugoroku), the original designers' and illustrators' names are lost to history.<br/><br/>Joudo-Sugoroku is themed on the Buddhist tradition of re-incarnation. Joudo means 'The Pure Land', that is the celestial realm or pure abode of a Buddha.  The players are human souls, wandering through the many Hells, gradually gaining enlightenment through training and meditation, to finally ascend to the Pure Land.<br/><br/>Game-play is based upon the text in the squares on the scroll. The players roll dice (labelled in Chinese text for the numbers 1 to 6) and move as instructed, so a player does not move from one square to an adjacent one, but instead jumps across the network. (Sugoroku means literally 'double-six').<br/><br/>An edition has been produced by \u671b\u6708\u54f2\u53f2 (Satoshi Mochizuki) for Plenluno (\u30d7\u30ec\u30f3\u30eb\u30fc\u30ce) and uses the classic artwork and language of the &quot;Sugoroku Ruiju&quot; game held in the collection of the National Museum of Japan in Tokyo, but also updated into modern language. The game is produced as a large sheet poster, with additional playing pieces, and is available at Spiel 2016.<br/><br/>The game is played by 1 to 8 players, aged from 5+ years and takes around 20 minutes to finish.

Tobi means 'Jumping', and as in Joudo-Sugoroku, players move differently across the board using dice rolls and following the instructions on the squares. As with other classical Japanese games, the original designers' and illustrators are not known.<br/><br/>However, later Tobi-Sugoroku do not keep the Buddhist theme, and instead reflect various popular subjects (New Year, ghosts and monsters, warriors and heroes, morality). This allowed the publishers to produce beautifully illustrated prints in the Edo period, and 19C and 20C magazines to have Sugoroku games as cheap pull-outs.<br/><br/>The main difference between Tobi-Sugoroku and Mawari-Sugoroku is that in the former, movement is across the network of squares, whereas in the latter, movement is along a controlled path (similar to Game of Goose). Any Sugoroku game with pictures is known as E-Sugoroku (E- means 'picture').<br/><br/>"}}
