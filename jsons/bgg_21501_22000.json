The game also features a novel movement system using a series of terrain dice.<br/><br/>Runebound is playable solo and is expandable by many adventure packs that alter the final challenge (replacing the Dragonlord for example). Runebound 2nd Edition also has a series of big box expansions that provide a new map or central map overlay to alter the game in some way.<br/><br/>Runebound 2nd Edition is different from 1st Edition in that the original game featured a d20 and this was replaced by 2 10-sided dice, which helped to better balance the luck factor.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "1", "boardgameversion": ["Dutch edition", "English edition", "French edition", "German edition", "Greek edition", "Hungarian Edition", "Italian edition", "Japanese edition", "Polish edition", "Russian edition"], "average": "6.90278", "name": "Runebound (Second Edition)", "playingtime": "240", "boardgamemechanic": ["Area Movement", "Card Drafting", "Dice Rolling", "Role Playing"], "age": "12", "boardgameexpansion": ["Descent / Runebound / Runewars Figure: Jonas the Kind", "Descent / Runebound / Runewars Figure: Nara The Fang", "Descent / Runebound / Runewars Figure: Tobin Farslayer", "Descent / Runebound / Runewars Figure: Truthseer Kel", "Runebound Essential Collection", "Runebound: Artifacts and Allies", "Runebound: Avatars of Kelnov", "Runebound: Battlemage Character Deck", "Runebound: Beasts and Bandits", "Runebound: Blade Dancer Character Deck", "Runebound: Champions of Kellos", "Runebound: Crown of the Elder Kings", "Runebound: Cult of the Rune", "Runebound: Drakes and Dragonspawn", "Runebound: Midnight", "Runebound: Mists of Zanaga", "Runebound: Relics of Legend", "Runebound: Rituals and Runes", "Runebound: Runemaster Character Deck", "Runebound: Sands of Al-Kalim", "Runebound: Shadow Walker Character Deck", "Runebound: Shadows of Margath (Second Edition)", "Runebound: Spiritbound Character Deck", "Runebound: The Cataclysm", "Runebound: The Dark Forest", "Runebound: The Frozen Wastes", "Runebound: The Island of Dread", "Runebound: The Scepter of Kyros", "Runebound: The Seven Scions", "Runebound: The Terrors of the Tomb", "Runebound: Traps and Terrors", "Runebound: Walkers of the Wild", "Runebound: Weapons of Legend", "Runebound: Wildlander Character Deck"], "usersrated": "7090", "boardgamesubdomain": ["Thematic Games"], "boardgamefamily": ["The Realms of Terrinoth", "Runebound", "Solitaire Games"], "boardgamepodcastepisode": ["AP Podcast \u2013 Episodio 3: Especial Terrinoth", "Cantrip 5: Martin Wallace at Essen Spiel 2014", "I've Been Diced! episode 47: Ignoble successes and serious SF games", "MOBG Podcast 37: 500 Games of Summer.", "The Messy Game Room Episode 4"]}, "21524": {"boardgamedesigner": ["Manuel Garcia"], "poll": [], "name": "Teleporters", "playingtime": "45", "minplayers": "1", "boardgamemechanic": ["Point to Point Movement"], "yearpublished": "2005", "usersrated": "1", "boardgamesubdomain": ["Abstract Games"], "maxplayers": "2", "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic126228_t.jpg", "average": "2", "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["Kadon Enterprises"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic126228.jpg", "boardgameversion": ["First edition"], "maxplaytime": "45", "boardgamecategory": ["Abstract Strategy"], "age": "8", "minplaytime": "45", "description": "From GAMES Magazine review:<br/><br/>On your turn, move two poles and two ports.

A port forms a teleport by landing on a square with another of its color, with each right angle in opposite corners of the square.

It was inspired by the immune system's ability to surround pathogens.<br/><br/>Two players, Black and White, take turns to either place or move one of their pieces adjacent to another of their pieces, on an 8x8 board. In order to make a move, the players' formations of pieces must have an open space adjacent to them. The game ends when one player can no longer make a move.<br/><br/><br/>Definitions<br/><br/>In these rules, &quot;adjacent&quot; always means &quot;orthogonally adjacent&quot;. A body is an adjacent set of pieces of the same colour. A foreign body is an opponent's body. A body has freedom if at least one of its pieces is adjacent to an empty square.<br/><br/><br/>Play<br/><br/>At the start of the game, Black pieces are placed on b6, b7, c7, f2, g2 and g3, and White pieces are placed on b3, b2, c2, f7, g7 and g6.<br/><br/>Black plays first, then turns alternate. On their turn, a player must first move one of their bodies and then add a piece to the board adjacent to one of their bodies.<br/><br/>The movement of a body involves taking a piece from the body and moving it to a different square adjacent to the body (including squares adjacent to the piece itself). A body cannot move unless it has freedom.<br/><br/>A body's move may land on a foreign body piece, thus removing it from the board, if that foreign body has no freedom.<br/><br/>A player wins if their opponent cannot add a piece next turn. This will occur if the opponent has either no remaining pieces on the board or no remaining bodies with freedom.<br/><br/><br/>Notes<br/><br/>The movement rules result in a pseudopod-like movement which may split a body into two smaller bodies (meiosis). Conversely, movement may result in two or more bodies coalescing.<br/><br/>Players should strive to surround foreign bodies and eat them away while giving their own bodies as much freedom as possible.

When you put a piece on the board, it must point upward.

The game ends when all pieces have been played. After this, all the stacks are scored. Stacks have a value equal to the point value of the pieces in the stack, multiplied by the number of pieces in the stack. Points are tallied separately by color. A piece that is 'engulfed' is scored by the color that&rsquo;s engulfing it, not by the 'owner' of the engulfed piece.

In this case, the player does NOT place one of their large tokens in advance of the move, but simply places their small token on top of the other small token already in place.

These typically are resolved by rolling a die and moving along a predetermined track until the active player completes the task, fails by landing on the wrong space in the races, or can't land on the required spot(s) before the cattle escapes out of the arena in the roping events.<br/> The overall winner of the game will be the one with the most money at the end of it. Exactly when that is has to be decided by the players themselves, as events can be repeated as long as players are willing to enter them, and bet on them.<br/><br/>Since all the tasks get resolved by die rolling alone, winning cowboys will have been riding little more than their luck, making the Rodeo setting nothing more than a novel theme for a dice betting game, rather than simulating the adrenaline-rush of a genuine wild west gathering,  where skillful cowboys strut their stuff.<br/><br/>On the upside, with detailed playing pieces and 6 different (and all short) events, your average dice betting game suddenly has become very atmospheric, reasonably varied, and does move on at a brisk pace. And even better, as players can keep betting during the races as long as they can find another player who takes them up on the counter-bet, bet money can move even faster than the bulls, triggering personal rivalry around the table that will make even the wildest rodeo-ride look tame in comparison.<br/><br/>This light-hearted simulation is aimed less at gamers and more at the family market, and the detail and simplicity of the rules will mean that it is probably most enjoyed by those with younger children to entertain.

Each tile shows a picture with a type of animal, either pigs, hens, sheep, or cows. Players get 2 track tiles each, which are placed (one each turn) on the grid to create connections (roads) between the animals. When a player places a track tile so that it connects 2 animal tiles of the same type, then those animal tiles are removed from the board and placed on that player's scoring stack. Empty spaces are filled with animal tiles from the draw stack, each player also draws a new track tile at the end of the turn and play continues until all animal tiles are collected or all track tiles are played. Track tiles may be placed on top of each other, and matching sets of animals may only be collected if the connection is made by establishing a new(!) route between them.<br/><br/>Each animal tile has one to three animals on it, and each player's end score is equivalent to the total amount of animals on the gained tiles. The one who collected most animals is the winner.<br/><br/>What appears to be a very simple tile-laying games with an appealing farmyard animal theme is quietly hiding a rather clever maze game that challenges children on multiple fronts. There are only four different track tiles in the game, yet there are so many ways to place these that a bewildering amount of new routes have to be considered. Visualizing the one that would connect two identical animal types, let alone spotting the most profitable one can be a challenge even for adults.<br/><br/>But kids love tiles, and kids love puzzles, and the rules are so intuitive that they easily get engrossed in an entertaining game. The best children games do far more than simple entertaining, and by having to match identical animals, create new routes between them, and consider the relative value of two matched tiles (2 hens and 3 hens is better than 1 sheep and 2 sheep) half an hour of fun is well spent indeed. There are 68 animals on offer, so even determining the final scores can be a quick math lesson.<br/><br/>The suggested age range is from 7 upwards, but it is such a good bridging game that it would suit even slightly younger children. For kids at the younger end of the spectrum, it might be simpler to settle for &quot;whoever has the highest animal stack wins&quot;, but even then there is enough left to make this a game worth considering.<br/><br/>Also known as &quot;Dierensporen&quot; in Dutch and &quot;Pistes d'Animaux&quot; in French.<br/><br/>"}, "21582": {"boardgamedesigner": ["(Uncredited)"], "poll": [], "name": "Rock 'N' Jockey", "playingtime": "5", "minplayers": "2", "yearpublished": "1971", "usersrated": "0", "boardgamefamily": ["Sports: Horse Racing"], "maxplayers": "4", "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic52068_t.jpg", "average": "0", "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["Aurora", "Ideal"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic52068.jpg", "boardgameversion": ["Aurora British Edition", "Aurora Edition 1972", "Ideal Edition"], "maxplaytime": "5", "boardgamecategory": ["Action / Dexterity", "Children's Game"], "age": "4", "minplaytime": "5", "description": "A game of skill and accuracy.

Each player is a champion of their star-faring race, trying to find pieces of the Ancient Robot, a powerful and dangerous artifact of a lost civilization.  The pieces of the Ancient Robot are scattered throughout the galaxy, and the players move from system to system to find them by choosing which page to turn to.  In their quest, they will encounter all sorts of harrowing adventures, battling or befriending strange monsters, collecting strange new items to improve their abilities, and may even run across each other....<br/><br/>The premise, as described by the books:<br/><br/>A million years before mankind invented fire or the Cybrtrons first oiled their gears, the Ancient Ones ruled the universe. For reasons lost in the mysteries of time, the Ancient Ones channeled all of their galaxy-spanning efforts into the building of one huge robot. There were twenty star systems in the realm of the Ancient Ones, and each one of the twenty was given the task of building one part of the massive robot.<br/><br/>The project was soon completed, the twenty parts constructed. The Ancient Ones had to bring the twenty parts to one central location and assemble the robot. But something went wrong -- perhaps a war between the systems, perhaps attack by some alien race. The Ancient Ones vanished. All that remained were the scattered parts of their robot.<br/><br/>One million years later, two parts of the Ancient Robot were recovered in different areas of the Milky Way galaxy. A team of humans discovered one part of the Ancient Robot in the year 2289 A.D., while exploring the planet Pluto. The Robot provided mankind with the secret of interstellar travel and a star chart marked with the location of the other nineteen parts.<br/><br/>At the same time, a civilization of robots also discovered a part of the Ancient Robot. Called Cybrtrons, they had overthrown their soft-skinned creators centuries before. They are now determined to rule the galaxy! The Ancient Robot part also gave the Cybrtrons the secret of interstellar travel and a star chart revealing the location of the other nineteen parts.<br/><br/>Both civilizations immediately decide to go in search of the Ancient Robot. Records of the Ancient Ones reveal that the Ancient Robot has the capability to design and build technological devices that will advance mankind a thousand years. The Ancient Robot is also capable of destroying anything in its path! With this device, the Cybrtrons know they can conquer the galaxy!<br/><br/>Both civilizations are sending their best pilots into space to search for the Ancient Robot. The Cybrtrons and the humans have become aware of each other. The search for the Ancient Robot has turned into a deadly race.<br/><br/>YOU are the leader of one of the two groups assigned to find the Ancient Robot!<br/><br/>Part of the series of 1 on 1 Adventure Gamebooks.<br/><br/>"}, "21629": {"boardgamedesigner": ["(Uncredited)"], "poll": [], "name": "Tickityboo", "playingtime": "15", "minplayers": "1", "boardgamemechanic": ["Tile Placement"], "yearpublished": "2003", "usersrated": "0", "maxplayers": "9", "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic210334_t.jpg", "average": "0", "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["Netherware Ltd"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic210334.jpg", "maxplaytime": "15", "boardgamecategory": ["Math", "Puzzle"], "age": "0", "minplaytime": "15", "description": "Tickityboo(tm)  is a game similar to Stubborn(tm), but with hexagonal tiles, and more of them.

The cups are then switched around--from 4 to 8 switches per round depending on what the players agree on beforehand--and the first player to Scoop's left tries to guess which cup a particular flavor (it's a little unclear from the rules, but apparently Scoop selects the flavor to be guessed) is under.

Players have the option of passing if they don't want to risk losing a &quot;scoop.&quot;  At the end of the round (after either a player has guessed correctly or all players have passed or guessed incorrectly).  All of the cups are lifted and any lost &quot;scoops&quot; are returned to their respective stacks.  The game continues until all of the &quot;scoops&quot; have been won.

So we have decided to satisfy that desire with our first C3i-DiF Squadron aircraft pack. This pack consists of 64 fighter aircraft cards, printed in the eight-per-sheet (cut 'em out yourself) style of C3i-DiF module inserts that you've enjoyed over the years. Most of the aircraft cards are NEW aircraft types, although we have included a few reprints (with corrected ratings) of aircraft that have appeared previously in one or more of the DiF Series games.<br/><br/>Included are such important aircraft as the British Typhoon and Tempest, the German Bf-109G-6/R6 and Fw-190F and the American P-63A Kingcobra (which was used extensively in combat by the Soviet air force). The pack also contains a number of more obscure but interesting aircraft, like the Rumanian IAR 80, the German TA-152H and the Polish PzL 24, the only fighter in the Greek inventory at the time of the Italian invasion in 1941. Speaking of the Italians, there are a number of Mussolini's fighters in the pack as well, including the Cr42 Falco, the M.C. 202 Folgore and the G.50bis Freccia. All of these planes are done in the upgraded graphic style of Corsairs and Hellcats, courtesy of Dave Lawrence, Martin Scott and Rodger MacGowan.<br/><br/>The package is wrapped in a ziplock format with an 11&quot; x 17&quot; (folded) cover/rulesbook. The front cover is graced with Rodger MacGowan's gorgeous DiF Series style artwork, while the inside will contain the rules necessary to use the aircraft in DiF dogfights. Some of the rules will be reprints from Zero! and Corsairs and Hellcats for the benefit of those players who only own the European Theatre DiF series volumes (Rise of the Luftwaffe and Eighth Air Force). There will also be a few new rules. For example, ace researcher Chris Janiec has come up with a way of modeling aircraft carrying a single, large caliber cannon, such as the P-39.<br/><br/>If this first C3i-DiF Squadron Pack proves to be popular, we're planning a series of these expansion packs. This is your chance to expand your Down in Flames series air force and add new aircraft cards at a very low price.

Players select the number of beads to offer in a series of three exchanges, after each of which the condition and effect cards are evaluated, distributing additional beads depending on who offered the most or the fewest of each color. At the end of the round shrunken head tokens are awarded depending on whose set of remaining beads best matches the current arrangement of goal cards.<br/><br/>After each round the goal cards, condition cards and effect cards are replaced. To win players must think ahead to understand whether an offer will likely give them more beads or less, depending on the cards in effect for the round. If players tie for a particular condition, the tied players are cancelled out, leaving the next player to follow the specified effect. This gives the game a rock-scissors-paper like feel where winning the round often depends on guessing how many beads the other players will offer.<br/><br/>High quality components consist of pleasing plastic beads, iconic card art, and shrunken head tokens that are both charming and macabre. Players must use tactical logic and guesswork to get an edge in this puzzling auction style game.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": ["2F '2nd Game of the afternoon 2005' Edition", "Dutch edition", "Rio Grande Edition"], "average": "5.84259", "name": "Fiji", "playingtime": "30", "boardgamemechanic": ["Auction/Bidding", "Set Collection"], "age": "10", "usersrated": "840", "boardgamesubdomain": ["Family Games"], "boardgamefamily": ["Admin: Better Description Needed!", "Tropical theme"]}, "21705": {"boardgamedesigner": ["(Uncredited)"], "poll": [], "name": "Scene It?

The game was developed in Denmark the 90's by 3 friends with a common passion for the WWI &quot;Knights of the Air&quot;.<br/><br/>The game features true 3-D action with accurate models of all the greatest planes of this era: SPADs, Sopwiths, Fokkers, Pfalz&acute;es, Nieuports, Hannovers, Rumplers, Albatrosses, Bristols, Gothas, Zeppelins, S.Es...<br/><br/>The game represents individual plane movement and individual pilots. <br/>Each plane is represented by a 1/350 scale model with at 360 deg. nose mount that allows the model to be positioned in all directions. The nose mount is then itself mounted on a four foot long pole made of carbon fibre. The plan can then be moved up and down the pole, thus denoting actual height - No altitude markers here. The pole is sharpened and set directly into the foam gameboards. See pictures.<br/><br/>Each plane also has a &quot;Cockpit&quot; sheet to which the Pilot sheet is attached and where the data (and possible special rules)on each plane type is represented. On the cockpit sheet also contains a speed indicator telling the current speed of the plane, and indicating the amount of energy the plane currently posses. This energy level tells how tigth the plane can turn and its ability to climb or dive. Going fast equals the ability to zoom high up, but turns are wide. Going slow allows for tighter turning but severely limits your ability to get out of trouble by zoom climbing and thus limits the tactical options. In this game speed is life.<br/><br/>Piloting skill can make planes turn tigther than their speed normally allows for, but this drains speed and at higher speeds also stresses the airframe, thus creating a risk of breaking of important bits such as the wings.<br/><br/>The &quot;Cockpit&quot; sheet is also where you record damage to the plane: Structural damage, damage to maneuverability, armament, engine and so on.<br/><br/>Each pilot has a set of 3 basic skills: Awareness (situational awareness), Piloting (ability to make tight turns, avoid or recover from spins and stalls)  and Gunnery (hitting your target). A pilots skills are decided by rolling 2d6+6. Pilots also has 2 attributes: Fortitude (hit points and ability to figth when wounded) and Luck (Denotes number of dice re-rolls and Used to check for collisions) found by rolling 3d6. With experience pilots gain better skills as well as possible &quot;Ace abilities&quot; such as Divine luck, Deflection shooting, Aerobatics and so on.<br/><br/>Skill and attribute checks are done with a d20 against a basic target number (for example Skill or Attribute level) modified by conditions (for example deflection angle or target speed). The difference between the target number needed and a the number rolled on a successful check denotes the success level which is then carried on as a modifier to the damage roll.<br/><br/>The full rules including, missions and Cockpit panels and more can be downloaded for free here:http://icog.dk/ICOG/Download.html<br/><br/>1/350 scale planes can be acquired as 3D prints(or hand build in styrene as you see on many of the pictures). A large selection of planes is available for the game.

The snakes' frenzy bring them to run between the trees and players must me able to &quot;pilot&quot; them to the apples, avoiding mushrooms, trees and the other snakes. The game is card driven (the cards are describe the possible movements).&quot;<br/><br/>SnakeLake is a cross between the old computer game Snake and the board game Robo Rally, but is much simpler and faster than RR. You have a simple board with a grid and place some apple trees around, then each player chooses a starting point.<br/><br/>Each player uses cards to program their next three moves in secret on their own chart, with the 2nd and 3rd move sliding down each turn when the 1st card is used and a new card going in the 3rd slot. The cards simply show forward, left, right (twice each) and one stop card. They also tell you to draw an Event card, which add some randomness.<br/><br/>If your snake runs into a tree, or off the board when incomplete, or into another snake's body, you start over again somewhere else, reprogramming your next three snake moves. If you hit another snake's head, they go off and you score a point for each segment of their body. If you get your whole snake on the board and then get your head off the board, you score points for the length of your snake.<br/><br/>But the big points come from eating apples which fall from the apple trees. These have 8-12 points on them, and your snake runs over them to eat them and reveal the points scored. Likewise, there are some mushrooms which deduct points if eaten. The apples and mushrooms are placed when an Event card indicates. The other events include removing an apple, sending an opponent's snake to sleep (miss a turn), and make your snake's body longer or shorter.<br/><br/>Snake Lake is a light, fast, fun game and will suit children more than adult's. The best strategy seems to be eat an apple then get knocked off the board to start somewhere else, near more apples. Getting your whole snake on and off is hard work, and scores few points in comparison.<br/><br/>The components are nicely made, good shiny cards that should wear well. The rules need a little proof-reading but were clear enough.

The board shows a map of all the cities, with roads leading from each one to some of its neighbors. There are various colored regions around the board, most with two or three cities, and a large region with all the Bavarian cities in the center.<br/><br/>Players build postal routes from city to city to city so that each city is adjacent to the next city on the route and there is a road connecting these two cities.  Each route must consist of at least three cities.  Players may only build one route at a time.  Routes are represented by melded city cards arranged in the order of the route.<br/><br/>Players start with a supply of 20 post offices in their color, a carriage house card and a player aid card.  The board is populated with bonus tiles, carriage cards and city cards.  On a turn a player will draw a card from a display of six, face up, city cards (or the top of the face down deck) and meld one card, either starting a new route or adding to the current one.  If after adding to the route, the length of the route is at least three cities, the player may declare it finished and score it.  The player may, depending on the length of the route and which cities are in the route, place post offices in the cities, collect bonus tiles, and acquire a higher value carriage.  Optionally, the player may receive support from one postal official in the form of: drawing a second card, melding a second card, refreshing the six city card display, or acquiring a higher value carriage than the route length when finishing a route.  Once a route is scored the city cards of that route are discarded, and the player begins a new route on his next turn.<br/><br/>When a player exhausts his supply of post offices or acquires a value 7 carriage the end of the game is triggered.  Play continues until the player who is last in turn order finishes his turn, and the game ends.  Players score points for their highest valued carriage and bonus tiles, and lose points for unplaced post offices.  The player with the most points wins.<br/><br/>The fact that you *must* add at least one city to your route each turn or lose the whole route gives the game an enjoyable planning element.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": ["Albi Czech edition with SdJ and Hra roku", "Dutch edition", "French Edition", "German edition", "German SdJ edition", "MINDOK Czech edition with SdJ", "Nordic first edition", "Nordic second edition", "Polish edition", "Rio Grande First Edition", "Rio Grande Second edition with SdJ", "Russian first edition"], "average": "7.12996", "name": "Thurn and Taxis", "videogamebg": ["Thurn and Taxis"], "playingtime": "60", "boardgamemechanic": ["Card Drafting", "Hand Management", "Route/Network Building", "Set Collection"], "age": "13", "boardgameexpansion": ["Thurn and Taxis: All Roads Lead to Rome", "Thurn and Taxis: Power and Glory", "Thurn und Taxis: Der Kurier der F\u00fcrstin"], "usersrated": "15091", "boardgamesubdomain": ["Family Games", "Strategy Games"], "boardgamefamily": ["Country: Germany", "Thurn and Taxis"], "boardgamepodcastepisode": ["BGTG 64 - Oct 23, 2006 - SR &amp; Feedback show (Thurn und Taxis, Gene Pool, Wallamoppi)", "BGWS 019 \u2013 Thurn and Taxis", "Durchgespielt \u2013 Spiel des Jahres 2006: Thurn und Taxis", "EP15\uff1a\u684c\u90ae", "Flash Point - Episode 045", "German Gaming News #6", "Podcast #015", "The Spiel #12 - Going Postal", "The Spiel #68 - That's A Wrap - 2008 Holiday Gift Guide"]}, "21791": {"image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic200801.jpg", "poll": [], "boardgamedesigner": ["Leo Colovini"], "statistics": [], "yearpublished": "2006", "maxplayers": "4", "boardgameartist": ["Franz Vohwinkel"], "boardgamepublisher": ["999 Games", "Hans im Gl\u00fcck Verlags-GmbH", "Rio Grande Games"], "maxplaytime": "45", "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic200801_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "45", "boardgamecategory": ["City Building", "Medieval"], "description": "In Masons, players represent architects, who together establish cities on the landscape of the game board.

The game is played on a 36 by 36 grid with the Earth at the center.  Players get fuel cards numbered 1 through 10 to control their movement.  Each turn, you play one fuel card to move your ship that number of squares either horizontally or vertically, but not both.<br/>There are also two fuel ships.  Every player on his turn rolls a die and moves one of the fuel ships.  If you land next to a fuel ship, you can retrieve any one used fuel card.  When you are out of fuel, you can only move one square per turn. You also retrieve any 3 used fuel cards on every planet you land on.<br/>Each planet has a series of 10 to 12 dots that describe its entry/exit orbit.  To leave Earth, you have to follow the 12 orbit dots before you enter the vertical and horizontal grid of open space.  Likewise, when you want to land on a planet, you have to start on the outermost orbit dot and follow the orbit down to the planet's surface.

The drivers must have their own 1/64th scale race cars. These are available at most department stores in the toy section or at your local racing collectible stores. Some spaces on the race track allow you lane changes or prompt you to draw cards which could be good or bad. Pit road is outlined in yellow, so you know where the speed limit begins. Strategies include pit stops in which you choose gas only, one side or both sides tire changes. Avoiding trouble and making moves which can put you in front of the competition are important strategies as well. To win you must be the first driver to cross the start/finish line after completing all of the laps and pit stops. Table Top Racing is no fantasy as you race face to face with your family and friends. Everyone can race at Dicecar. You don&rsquo;t need to be a race fan to enjoy the game. Racing knowledge can help but it is not necessary. Experience counts, so race a few times as you develop your strategy. Dicecar includes qualifying, drafting, unscheduled pit stops for tire or engine trouble. Crashes can happen and the yellow flag will bring out the pace car for a caution. Have fun racing and building your 1/64th scale racing world. Different tracks are available as well as accessories like the high banks and soft walls.

The players who helped with a building get crystals and dragon favors, which can be traded in for crystals at certain times.<br/><br/>The player who first manages to add the required number of markers by paying crystals to the Obelisk wins the game.

Singles, doubles, triples, foul balls, and home runs are determined where the ball goes over the wall.  The &quot;runners&quot; stay in their team dugouts until it is time to position them on the field.<br/><br/>Each &quot;batter&quot; gets only one pitch. A missed pitch counts as one out.  Each team gets three outs and then players change positions.  Players play nine innings and whomever has the most runs wins.<br/><br/>There are a few other simple rules.

It was depicted as leisure activity for the characters in the television show. Later on, rules and decks of pyramid playing cards were made available commercially to fans of the show. Both are currently out of print.<br/>The game uses a 55 count deck of hexagonal cards separated into three kinds of suits and three ranks as well as a 'capstone' card which is used as a wild card. The game is played very similarly to poker. Players are dealt hands and place bets based on how strong their hand is. There is a discard between bets and players reveal their hands to determine the winner of that round.<br/><br/>Winning hands are determined by a number of factors including suit, rank and matching sets. There are approximately fourteen different hand combinations possible in the game. There is no 'end' to the game, players merely quit at their leisure.<br/><br/>The deck consists of 55 hexagonal cards, which is divided into 3 suits: purple, green and orange. Purple ranks highest and orange ranks lowers. The deck also contains a Capstone (*).<br/><br/>Each suit contains:<br/>- 3 First level cards<br/>- 6 Second level cards<br/>- 9 Third level cards<br/><br/>How To Play<br/>Each player is dealt 6 cards. If a player feels a better hand is possible, he may discard up to 4 cards and receive replacements from the dealer. This may only be done once per hand, much the same as &quot;Draw Poker&quot;. Players then construct their best possible pyramid and compare to the other player hands to determine the winner.<br/>Ranks of Hands<br/>A pyramid is made up of at least three cards.<br/><br/>1. First level pyramid consist of 2 third level, and 1 second level card.<br/><br/>2. Second level pyramid consist of 3 third level, and 2 second level card.<br/><br/>3. Third level pyramid consist of 3 third level, 2 second level cards, and 1 first level card.<br/><br/>4. Any of the above may be considered &quot;perfect&quot; when all of the cards used are of the same color. (&quot;Perfect&quot; pyramids rank higher than non-perfect pyramids.)<br/><br/>5. If two or more perfect pyramids are the same level, then the highest suit would win. (NOTE: Only perfect pyramids can be ranked by suit; non-perfect pyramids are considered to have no suit.)<br/><br/>6. If two or more pyramids are still equal, then the persons play another hand to decide the winner.<br/><br/><br/>    ) The Capstone can be used in place of the first level card in a Perfect third level pyramid. This is the highest of ALL PYRAMIDS!<br/><br/><br/><br/>        ) The Capstone may also be used as a wild card to replace any card in any pyramid.<br/>    <br/><br/><br/>"}, "21978": {"boardgamedesigner": ["Carherine Day", "Caroline Harris"], "poll": [], "name": "Prompt", "playingtime": "30", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": ["Memory", "Set Collection"], "yearpublished": "1998", "usersrated": "3", "maxplayers": "6", "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic113257_t.jpg", "average": "3.66667", "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["Prompt Corner"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic113257.jpg", "maxplaytime": "30", "boardgamecategory": ["Card Game", "Memory", "Trivia"], "age": "0", "minplaytime": "30", "description": "Taken from the back of the box:<br/><br/>&quot;Played with gloriously illustrated Character and Prompt cards and a variety of quotations from Shakespeare.&quot;<br/><br/>This is a light game of memory and card collection requiring a familiarity with Shakespeare's plays.
