Monster Lands) is a competitive game that combines resource management, worker placement, and fun combat. Each player controls a clan and has to manage to be the best at the end of the game. Killing or capturing monsters, conquering terrains, accomplishing missions, or saving the city are the ways to win glory and money, and this is the key to be the best clan!<br/><br/>Each clan begins with one leader and one mercenary that gives a number of dice of one of three types: action (red dice), persuasion (yellow dice), and magic (black dice). On your turn, you can use these dice to get more mercenaries (which give you immediately more dice); get gold, traps, shields, potions, objects to equip your mercenaries; or send any of your mercenaries on a mission or in a terrain to try to kill or capture the monster. When all players have placed their dice, the combat phase begins&hellip;<br/><br/>Each terrain has four tracks, and each track has a limitation of the number and type of dice you can put in there. You have to place all dice in a track in one action (you can't place more dice later), and add more if you want traps or shields to protect you against the monsters or the other players! Traps and shields are the key to controlling the luck of combat, but watch your back as the other players can also use traps against you!<br/><br/>First the monster attacks; to do this, roll the number of dice that their card indicates, plus one die if the monster is in its habitat. Each hit can be avoided by a shield or a discarded potion. If a mercenary gets more than one hit, they die and the monster attacks the next player. If not, the player rolls the placed dice plus the bonus dice of activated traps and tries to get the capture or killing value, depending of what he wants. If the monster is not captured or killed, the next player adds the result of the previously rolled dice to their result &mdash; but before doing so, they have to survive the monster's attack!<br/><br/>Beware! If a monster is attacked and is not captured or killed at the end of the combat phase, the monster enters the city, then things get complicated&hellip;<br/><br/>If no monsters are on a terrain but players are on it, the players fight to conquer the terrain the same way that they fight monsters, but with no attacks on them. Each terrain gives glory and special actions that you can take in the placement phase. When no more mercenaries can fight against monsters or conquer a terrain, each player removes all dice, and a new phase begins. You are angry because you were in a track and won nothing? Don&rsquo;t worry! While your mercenary was returning home, they found a treasure...or something; sometimes it can even be better to return home with empty hands!<br/><br/>Finally, you have to pay your mercenaries as they don't work for free, and they charge more as your clan collects more glory points.  At the end of the seventh turn, the player with the most glory wins.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": ["English first edition"], "age": "10", "name": "M-Lands", "playingtime": "120", "boardgamemechanic": ["Dice Rolling", "Worker Placement"], "average": "0", "usersrated": "0", "boardgamefamily": ["Admin: Unreleased Games"]}, "209002": {"poll": [], "name": "Diaries of a Spaceport Janitor", "videogamemode": ["Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["Windows Downloadable edition"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3430361.jpg", "videogametheme": ["Science Fiction"], "usersrated": "1", "videogamedeveloper": ["Sundae Month"], "videogamegenre": ["Adventure"], "videogameplatform": ["Windows"], "videogamehonor": ["2016 IndieCade Best Story/World Design of the Year Winner", "2017 IGF Awards (Nuovo) Best Innovation of the Year Nominee", "2017 IGF Awards Best Student Game Nominee", "2017 IGF Awards Excellence In Audio Honorable Mention", "2017 SXSW Gamer's Voice: Best Indie Game of the Year (Single player) Nominee"], "average": "5", "statistics": [], "videogamepublisher": ["tinyBuildGAMES"], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3430361_t.jpg", "description": "Diaries of a Spaceport Janitor is an anti-adventure game about picking up trash in an alien bazaar.

The Medieval game introduces many new game concepts to the Commands &amp; Colors system, which add historical depth and flavor. Some of the new concepts are:<br/><br/><br/>     Superior armor and status when battling<br/><br/><br/><br/>     Cavalry units increase to 4 blocks<br/><br/><br/><br/>     Heavy infantry battle dice are reduced from 5 dice down to 4<br/><br/><br/><br/>     Light Bow Cavalry units can employ the Parthian Shot when they evade<br/><br/><br/>Still, some Commands &amp; Colors game mechanics remain familiar to players of other games in the system, like the deck of Medieval Command cards that drive movement while creating a &ldquo;fog of war,&rdquo; and the battle dice that will resolve combat quickly and efficiently. The stylized battlefield scenario maps emphasize the important terrain features and highlight the historical deployment of forces in scale with the game system. The scale of the game is flexible, and varies from battle to battle. For some scenarios, a unit may represent a Chiliarchy of soldiers, while in other scenarios a unit may represent just a few brave warriors. The battlefield tactics, however, that you will need to execute to gain victory conform remarkably well to the strengths and limitations of the various medieval unit types, their weapons, the terrain, and history.<br/><br/>Although the Byzantine army fought on other frontiers, against a multitude of opponents, Visigoths, Vandals, Ostrogoths, Franks, Alemanni, those conflicts are beyond the scope and space of this one package. Additional expansion modules that address those battles will be forthcoming.<br/><br/>I truly believe, that the Commands &amp; Colors: Medieval game will provide even the most veteran Commands &amp; Colors players many new challenges and experiences.<br/><br/>"}, "209005": {"rpgartist": ["(Uncredited)"], "rpgitemversion": ["RTF Version"], "poll": [], "name": "Dragon Kill", "rpgdesigner": ["Gill Abbott", "Michael Abbott", "Nick Abbott"], "rpgproducer": ["David Sarkies"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3180973.jpg", "usersrated": "0", "rpgsetting": ["Spelljammer"], "average": "0", "statistics": [], "rpg": ["AD&D Second Edition (2e) Compatible Products"], "rpgpublisher": ["(Web published)"], "rpgcategory": ["Scenario / Adventure / Module"], "rpggenre": ["Fantasy (High Fantasy)"], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3180973_t.jpg", "description": "Some men are not meant to be trusted<br/><br/>From the introduction:<br/><br/>The player's ship is traveling through Wildspace when it suddenly slows down to tactical speed.

Five of these boards are just different finishes for various stages. Another board (&quot;parcour montagne&quot;) can be either the end of a stage or a stage in itself, while the bigger board &quot;(&quot;parcours plaine&quot;) is the one used in mosts races.<br/><br/>A maximum of six players manages a team of two riders each.<br/><br/>The riders are seventies' Cofalus (5cms, smaller than the ones featured in later games like l'Echapp&eacute;e Infernale or Les G&eacute;ants de la Route), and two extra riders are provided for the yellow and green jerseys. <br/>The riders are a bit oversized for the board (which is nevertheless quite big), and there is also a trailing car (voiture balai).<br/><br/>Most of the time you throw two dice and move your two riders. You decide which rider you move with each dice, considering that you are not allowed to move to a field occupied by another rider, and that there are certain fields that give you advantages or disadvantages.<br/><br/>An interesting/unusual rule, though, is the one for the trailing car. It starts its movement when the first rider reachs km. 47, and stops at km 100 of flat stages. If there are two or three players in the game, the trailing car moves 5 fields forward in each movement. For 4 or 5 players it just moves 4 field. With 6 players, it just moves 3 fields. All the riders caught up by the car are out of the race, though they may take part in subsequent stages.<br/><br/>For mountain stages, movement rules change. Before a climb, riders have tos stop compulsorily in the &quot;Plateforme&quot; field before the climb (in which there can be no more than three riders at a time). Then, during climbs, to progress to the next field riders must throw exactly the number inscribed in that field. If the field ahead is blocked by another rider, you must throw the number corresponding to the first free field, to which you will move. As a result, riders tend to form pelotons in the climbs, and these pelotons disband quickly in the descents.<br/><br/>By the way, there is no trailing car in mountain stages.<br/><br/>Another unusual feature of this game are the different stage finishes. Riders have to arrive to the neutral zone (last field) and then they move onto that particular stage finishing board. What is most unusual is that every finish has different rules.

It is a clever middle point between a simulation replay game and a board game. You can play it by yourself, with a lot of tables, individual characteristics for each rider and a some of dice-throwing and table checking like a replay game, but you still have a board and riders, and the game can be played by several players.<br/><br/>There are (or maybe I should say &quot;there wiill be&quot;) six versions of the game, corresponding to six historical periods  (one for each post WWII decade: mine is the 1966-1975 edition). There are ten teams for each historical period, plus a bonus &quot;world championship&quot; special set.<br/><br/>There are ten team (of three riders which you can chose among four fdifferent ones). That makes thirty riders, and they all take part in the race, regardless of whether there are enough players. In the (most probable) case of having less than ten players, there are rules to manage the virtual players, to take decisions for them as whern to attack and when to follow other riders, etc...<br/><br/>You can play the game by yourself against nine virtual teams, in which case the game is almost a replay game (thouigh you still take your decisions for one of the teams). I wonder which would be the better balance between the number of human players and the number of virtual teams for the game playability.<br/><br/>An individual race or stage consists of six game turns. The winner is not the first to reach a certain point in the board, but the one to ride further in these six turns.<br/><br/>Before the race you set up six tiles in a special window in the board , which will define the race profile. (In the case of the picture below, a mountain stage, though one starting with a &quot;pav&eacute;s&quot; zone). You can design your own race profile, but you can also use one of the many included in the game rules. You can chose between Milano-San Remo,  Gand-Velvegem, Fl&egrave;che Wallonne, Gold Race, Paris-Tours, Ronde van Vlaanderen, Paris-Roubaix, Liege-Bastogne-Liege, Paris-Bruxelles, Giro di Lombard&iacute;a, a World Championship, a Time Trial World Championship, as well as 10-stage long Giro d'Italia and Tour de France.<br/><br/>"}, "209022": {"poll": [], "name": "Queen of Thieves", "videogamemode": ["Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["Linux Downloadable edition", "Macintosh Downloadable edition", "Windows Downloadable edition"], "average": "0", "videogametheme": ["Fantasy"], "usersrated": "0", "videogamedeveloper": ["Winter Wolves"], "videogamegenre": ["Dating Sim", "RPG"], "videogameplatform": ["Linux", "Macintosh", "Windows"], "statistics": [], "videogamepublisher": ["Winter Wolves"], "description": "For a long time, the three sisters Joanne, Kira and Thalia were on their own, living their separate lives.

A powerful game engine simulates each pitch of the game based on customized player ratings and over 100 years of historical data, assuring you the maximum realism possible!<br/><br/>Baseball Mogul is designed to help you manage your team over many simulated years. Manage your team one day at a time, or let the computer simulate weeks or months at a stretch so you can play for virtual years or decades. As your players age, their abilities mature and decline realistically. Don't forget to build your team for the long term, rather than spending all your money on free agents this season.<br/><br/>Watch your team rise and fall in the standings, watch your bank statement, and read the news stories to stay on top of what's happening with all the ball clubs in both leagues. If you pick the right players, manage your finances well, and stick to a winning strategy, your team may win the Championship, and you too may become a Baseball Mogul!<br/><br/>Source: The Developer Website.<br/><br/>"}, "209039": {"poll": [], "name": "Inland Water Transport", "playingtime": "0", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": ["Pick-up and Deliver", "Roll / Spin and Move"], "yearpublished": "1950", "usersrated": "0", "maxplayers": "6", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3183095_t.jpg", "average": "0", "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["(Unknown)"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3183095.jpg", "boardgameversion": ["First Edition"], "maxplaytime": "0", "boardgamecategory": ["Transportation"], "age": "0", "minplaytime": "0", "description": "Inland Water Transport was produced around 1950* as a promotional piece for the transportation companies Macneill &amp; Barry Ltd and their subsidiary Kilburn &amp; Co Private Ltd.

Of course, in the case of playing solo, the player takes all four teams. This lets clear that, although this not just a roll-and-move game and there are a fair number of decisions to be taken at each turn, there is not a complex strategy involved in the game.<br/><br/>The game does not include rules for different types of roads or riders. It represents a race on a flat circuit.<br/><br/>The game uses special dice (drilled one by one by Jos Noben himself). The red dots represent half a point. the values on the dice are 3, 3, 2 1/2, 2 1 1/2, and 1. There are two different 3's (painted/unpainted) because there is a rule  about throwing the same number with both dice, and it just applies to either two painted threes aor two unpainted threes , but not to one of each.<br/><br/>The riders are placed on the white lines and on the black dots of the board. The half-point is a diagonal move (line to dot, or dot to line) while the full point is either a front or diagonal move.<br/><br/>Another original rule is the turn order. It is not determined by the first rider on the race  nor by tghe order of the players round the board (which are the two usual options in cycling games), but by a colour table on the board upon whic a white counter is placed to remind where we are in the turn. The turn itself is divided in eight parts. <br/>The two leading riders of each teams are moved in the first half of the turn and two trailing riders of the teams are moved in the second half of the turn, but in a different order. The order of the following turns is also different.<br/><br/>At the end of each turn, when the sixteen priders have moved, there is a phase called &quot;Boosting&quot; in which some riders benefit from an extra advance. Riders who are on a black dot just (diagonally) behind another rider (who is on a white line) move one dot ahead. Should the rider, by this movement, find himself again diagonally behind another rider, he continues advancing.<br/><br/>After the &quot;Boosting&quot; phase  there is still another phase called &quot;Peloton&quot; where certain groups of riders, depending on their position, may advance even further.  This rule may look counter-intuitive at first sight (why certain groups of riders and not others?) but it fulfills well its role of regrouping the pack.<br/><br/>The winner of the game is the player who's riders arrive first at the finish.<br/><br/>"}, "209087": {"rpgartist": ["(Uncredited)"], "rpgitemversion": ["ASCII Version", "DOC Version", "RTF Version"], "poll": [], "name": "Stonelife", "rpgdesigner": ["Alan D.

Needless to say, if the knowledge or magic items are found and brought back to civilization, it could change the course of history. Lemurian magic and technology is still more advanced than anything else the world has ever known. A few adventurers armed with this power can end wars, curse diseases or doom their own civilization. Not only are the Ruins a perfect locale for a fantasy campaign, the implications of its rediscovery can also affect the world.

You need to look around and be attentive not to become next victim.<br/><br/>Every level of Citadel is based on famous thriller scenarios. To win the game, you usually need to reach the exit. However, it is not an easy task. If a prisoner doesn&rsquo;t tackle the obstacle, he/she is returned to the previous level<br/><br/>Depending on the achievements, a player gets access to different masks that open new opportunities. By completing the most complicated achievements, a player can enter one of the confronting order: Legalists, Servants of Ancients, or Guardians of Memory.<br/><br/>The game doesn&rsquo;t have a text chat, but it is offered to use a voice 3D chat instead. Then closer players are, then better they hear each other. It is also planned to add the support of popular virtual reality helmets (i.e. Oculus).<br/><br/>All these will allow players to get a new experience of team-play in virtual reality.<br/><br/>Source: The Game Website.<br/><br/>"}, "209109": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3203171.jpg", "poll": [], "boardgamedesigner": ["Jens Reher", "Dirk Reher", "Angelo Riganis"], "statistics": [], "yearpublished": "2017", "maxplayers": "5", "boardgameartist": ["Jens Reher"], "boardgamepublisher": ["Steamdeer"], "maxplaytime": "20", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3203171_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "5", "boardgamecategory": ["Bluffing", "Fantasy", "Humor", "Trivia"], "description": "Wizards and Unicorns is a fast-paced card game about battling unicorns, wizards, unicornwizards, elves, and pegasus set in the city of Unicornopia.

The earliest of the four battles collected herein saw two of William's sons duking it out. The other three battles are all drawn from the reign of Stephen of Blois, the Conqueror's grandson, and the long period of instability and intermittent civil war that has come to be called The Anarchy. During the twelfth century, armies tended to avoid giving battle to one another, and when it did come to blows, neither side exhibited much endurance; there's none of that &quot;they fought from sunrise to sunset&quot; stuff here. Nor was anyone involved particularly renown for any special military genius. As a result, the battles here are short, small, and uncomplicated affairs, ideal both for solitaire study, and for a quick game with a friend. That's not to say the battles are lacking in flavor, however, as each brings something unique to your table.<br/><br/>The Battle of Tinchebray (1106) gives each player Wings composed of both cavalry and foot soldiers, and arrayed in echelons. S &amp; S vets know that horse and non-horse units don't support the other's attacks, which makes things tricky. The battle turns on the timely (or not) arrival of a hidden English Wing.<br/><br/>The Battle of the Standard (1138) is a matter of English quality versus Scots quantity. The English have a good defensive position, and are mostly arrayed into a single Wing (with all the pluses and minuses that come with it). Successive waves of Scots will usually be forced to attack the English piecemeal. The English have the advantage in the early game, but the longer the game runs, the more Scottish numerical superiority will rule the day. To recreate the spectacularly lopsided victory that the English enjoyed historically, the English player will have to seal the deal in the early going.<br/><br/>The Battle of Lincoln (1141) might be described as a game of &quot;press your luck&quot; for poor King Stephen. He has some good units, but as soon as one Wing defects, the others might follow, turning an even contest into a slaughter. His Angevin opponent must make good use of not only his horse, but also his Welsh infantry, which is fearsome but brittle.<br/><br/>The Battle of Wilton (1143) commences at dusk, and ends at nightfall. This means the battle has a time pressure element, quite unusual for the S&amp;S system. Neither player knows exactly when the battle is going to end. Will the Blesevins break through the Angevin line, or will Stephen's retreat be covered by his gallant rearguard?<br/><br/>The SHIELDS &amp; SWORDS II series builds on, and improves, the Shields &amp; Swords series of games (We Happy Few, Stamford Bridge, A Hill Near Hastings, and Our Royal Bones), with a greater variety of unit types, revised suppression rules, and a new D8-based CRT. S&amp;S II revolves around the activation of Wings using double-sided Command Markers, with a flexible scale and simple, easy-to-teach rules.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": ["First edition"], "age": "0", "name": "House of Normandy", "playingtime": "90", "boardgamemechanic": ["Dice Rolling", "Hex-and-Counter"], "average": "7.22222", "usersrated": "9", "boardgamefamily": ["Shields & Swords II"]}, "209114": {"boardgamedesigner": ["John Gorkowski"], "poll": [], "name": "Rising Sun over China", "playingtime": "480", "minplayers": "1", "boardgamemechanic": ["Hex-and-Counter"], "yearpublished": "2016", "usersrated": "6", "maxplayers": "2", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3184612_t.jpg", "average": "7.16667", "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["Compass Games"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3184612.jpg", "boardgameversion": ["Rising Sun over China"], "maxplaytime": "480", "boardgamecategory": ["Wargame", "World War II"], "age": "12", "minplaytime": "120", "description": "Rising Sun over China( RSOC) simulates the Japanese invasion of China prior to World War II (1937-1941) on a table top map scaled at 50 miles per hex with division-level playing pieces and monthly game turns.

The subtitle Tapout refers to a fighter tapping his hand indicating that he has submitted to a submission hold. A tapout, along with a knockout, judge's decision, and referee stoppage, is one of the ways of ending a UFC bout.<br/><br/>The game features many of UFC's top stars including Matt Hughes, Chuck Liddell, Mark Coleman, Frank Shamrock, and Tito Ortiz. Competitions can take place in several modes such as exhibition, tournament, arcade, and championship mode. Several fighters throughout the game are unlockable such as two female competitors and celebrity Ice-T.<br/><br/>UFC: Tapout received generally lukewarm reviews from critics.

There are 34 Stress Cards, of five types: Romance, Bucks, Shelter, Nine to Five, and Why Me? There are 38 Relief cards, each of which stops a specific type of stress. There are 5 Quick Fix cards, one for each kind of stress, that both provide relief and prevent that player from receiving any more stress of that kind for the rest of the round. Finally, there are 2 Reversal cards, which of course allow a player to dump his current stress on another player.<br/><br/>Players receive 5 cards each to start, and each turn draw one card and either play or discard one card. They may play their cards on any player including themselves. An I Survived New York card opens a player to receiving stress, one card at a time. A Relief card &quot;closes&quot; a stress pile, at which point that player then adds up his accumulated stress cards and notes the total on a scorepad. All the cards in the closed pile go into the discard pile, and that player is now free of additional stress until someone opens a new stress pile with an ILNY card.<br/><br/>As soon as one player has reached 4,000 stress points and closed his current pile, the round ends, and all cards are returned and reshuffled. When a player accumulates more than 12,000 stress points, he burns out totally and must move to Cleveland.

The premise of the game is that there are three space marines who have fought as part of an interstellar war. One of them, Casey, has been brought back to life by his partners after a space accident and he is now a brain grafted in a life-support system. In order to save themselves, the three characters and the player solve all sorts of puzzles.<br/><br/>Plot<br/>The game follows a trio of space marines who fought in an interstellar war: Casey O'Bannon (the player character), Ariel Matheson (Tia Carrere) and Zack Smith (Christian Bocher). On a routine patrol, their ship is attacked by enemy fighters, and Casey is critically injured by a hunk of space debris. Casey's body is irreparably damaged, and by the time he wakes up from his comatose state, the war has ended, Ariel and Zack have embarked on a new career scavenging equipment from ships wrecked in the war, and he is now only a brain grafted in a life support system on their spaceship, the Artemis. So that Casey can take part in their ventures, Ariel and Zack have put him in control of a small flying probe. During a salvage mission, the trio crash into and are stranded on a derelict alien spacecraft, which is on a collision course with the star. It is up to Casey to help his partners and explore the mystery of the Daedalus spaceship.<br/><br/>During the exploration of the alien ship, Ari and Zack enter a Central Hub containing six doors in the shape of hexagons. They explore areas of the ship behind each door but do not find any navigational controls. However, Casey figures out how to manipulate a device in the room, activating an elevator which takes Ari, Zack and Casey up and out of the Central Hub.<br/><br/>The alien ship approaches the Sun and temperature inside starts to rapidly increase. The elevator brings Ari, Zack and Casey into a control room where the device (which the orbs were inserted into) vanishes, revealing a fish-shaped shell. Ari and Zack notice a live alien and Casey goes over to communicate with it.<br/><br/>Depending on the player's actions, the game proceeds to one of three endings:<br/><br/>The alien ship reaches the Sun and the Artemis burns and explodes in the heat.<br/>    The alien doesn't respond to Casey and Zack shoots it with his laser gun. The alien knocks Zack aside and attacks Ari. Ari kills the alien and the shell hatches into the Queen alien. Ari kills it and Casey changes the course of the ship, steering it away from the Sun. Ari assumes that Zack is dead and cries over his body, telling Casey that he was wrong about there being no such thing as a hopeless situation.<br/>    The alien responds to Casey and as the alien ship reaches the star, a force field appears around the Artemis and protects it from the intense heat. The fish-shaped shell turns out to be an egg, which hatches into a giant red alien Queen. The live alien, Ari, Zack and Casey bow to it. In a voice over, Ari explains that the force field created by the creatures which called themselves &quot;Seddy&quot; protected them and the ship from the intense heat. The Krin either fled or were destroyed and the new Queen possessed &quot;race memory&quot; and being able to speak and know; she helped Casey&rsquo;s translation abilities, answered many of Ari&rsquo;s and Zack&rsquo;s questions and repaired the Artemis. Zack receives a transmission from the Daedalus, wishing them a safe voyage. Zack tells Casey that he was right about there being &quot;no such thing as a hopeless situation&quot; and tries to convince Ari to join him on the mattress in the station room. Ari says nothing, and Zack murmurs, &quot;Or not,&quot; as the Artemis speeds off into outer space.<br/><br/>Gameplay<br/>Casey can interact with the world through a small remote controlled flying probe, which is launched from the ship shortly after the start of the game. In this new form, Casey possesses limited ability to interact with his environment, his only way to communicate being through a yes/no interface and by emitting light pulses.<br/><br/>In order to save themselves, the trio must explore the huge alien ship and solve a large number of mind puzzles, such as connecting colored laser-beams with mirrors, unlock a door with rotating shapes, playing an advanced form of connect-the-dots with a computer interface, and one combat sequence, battling aliens called Krin. The puzzles are mixed with acting sequences from Carrere and Bocher, whose interaction with the player creates some light-hearted comedy. Numerous alternate scenes and clips were filmed and edited into game play. The alternate scenes appear depending on the player&rsquo;s choice of game play.<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;[en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Daedalus_Encounter The Daedalus Encounter]&quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "209232": {"poll": [], "name": "Critical Path", "videogamemode": ["Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["Macintosh release", "Windows release"], "average": "0", "videogametheme": ["Post-Apocalyptic"], "usersrated": "0", "videogamedeveloper": ["Mechadeus"], "videogamegenre": ["Interactive Movie"], "videogameplatform": ["Macintosh", "Windows"], "statistics": [], "videogamepublisher": ["Media Vision Technology"], "description": "Critical Path is a post-apocalyptic interactive movie adventure video game developed by Mechadeus (now Mondo Media) and published by Media Vision Technology. Critical Path featured real time video which made it appear to be graphically superior to most games of its time. In actuality, the entire game was an interactive movie, where most choices would simply cause the game to progress or end.<br/><br/>Plot<br/>A terrorist biological warfare doomsday event has played out, killing off 90% of the world's population. Many of the survivors are sick or eventually become insane. A group of surviving soldiers attempt to care for survivors and maintain order on their military base. Over time, the situation gradually becomes so dire that the commander orders all sick transported 70 miles (110 km) away to an abandoned village, and orders his troops to open fire on anything within a 30-mile (48 km) radius.<br/><br/>Kat (Eileen Weisinger), a helicopter pilot, returns from a reconnaissance mission to find her military base destroyed. Nighthorse (Stuart W. Yee) suggests that it was done by a nuclear weapon launched by a Soviet &quot;boomer&quot;. Weeks later, Grier (Al Qualls) makes contact with an island 300 miles (480 km) away, which reported to be clear of the sick and capable of receiving refugees. Nighthorse, Grier, Kat and the player, an unnamed soldier, set off in two AH-64 Apache attack helicopters.<br/><br/>En route, the helicopter carrying Grier and the player develops mechanical problems and require a replacement part had by the pair on the other helicopter. The player's helicopter is forced to set down on an island, landing on the rooftop of a factory compound. As Nighthorse and Kat circle, they are fired upon and shot down by a surface-to-air missile. Nighthorse is fatally wounded and orders Kat to deliver the part to the other team.<br/><br/>Kat makes her way to the compound entrance where she makes radio contact with the player, who is in a factory control room. The player relays his situation to Kat: Grier was dead while he was wounded and immobile. The pair had been caught in a booby trap when trying to enter the control room. The player can observe Kat's actions through a series of security cameras as well as Kat's camera headset. However, the headset is quickly damaged, and Kat can no longer receive audio signals from the player. Relying instead on sending simple instructions to Kat through a signaling keypad, the player must guide Kat through the factory to his position. Kat reveals that she has only nine bullets for her Uzi.<br/><br/>The player assists Kat as she makes her way through the factory by activating or deactivating machinery, relaying directional commands and setting off booby traps. The function of the various machinery and booby traps is hinted at in the deranged ramblings contained in a black notebook the player finds on the control room desk. As time passes, the identity of the facility's operator, General Minh (Min Yee) is revealed to the player, as is its function. At first blush, it appears as though Kat is making her way through a steel mill which manufactures large metal crosses. However, Kat eventually discovers a cross partially filled with a white powder she identifies as illicit drugs. She also discovers a torture chamber and meets a prisoner (Brian Bernasconi) who attempts to kill her for her gun. The player saves Kat by electrocuting the inmate who is sitting on an electric chair, and she moves on.<br/><br/>As Kat approaches the rooftop, she is confronted by Minh, carrying an M60 machine gun. The player successfully distracts Minh, while Kat shoots him and makes her way to the player. As the helicopter lifts off, Minh stands up and begins firing on the two as they hover. Kat aims a TV-guided missile at Minh and fires, and the helicopter veers away. Minh is killed in a flaming explosion and Kat, in her chopper, proclaims that she has ten lives and flies off victoriously into the sunset heading back to her military base and then home.<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;[en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Critical_Path_%28video_game%29 Critical Path (video game)]&quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "209233": {"poll": [], "name": "Warhammer Quest: Silver Tower \u2013 Arcane Heroes", "playingtime": "120", "minplayers": "1", "boardgamemechanic": ["Dice Rolling", "Modular Board", "Role Playing", "Variable Player Powers"], "yearpublished": "2016", "boardgameexpansion": [], "usersrated": "10", "maxplayers": "4", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3234085_t.jpg", "average": "6.75", "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["Games Workshop Ltd."], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3234085.jpg", "boardgameversion": ["First edition"], "maxplaytime": "120", "boardgamecategory": ["Expansion for Base-game", "Exploration", "Fantasy", "Fighting", "Miniatures"], "age": "14", "minplaytime": "60", "description": "This box set contains five plastic Citadel miniatures, providing a collection of new heroes with an emphasis on wielding arcane powers.<br/><br/><br/>     Chaos Sorceror Lord<br/>     Skink Starpriest<br/>     Dark Elf Sorceress<br/>     Skaven Grey Seer<br/>     Stormcast Knight Heraldor<br/><br/><br/>"}, "209234": {"rpgartist": ["(Uncredited)"], "rpg": ["GruntBuggler!"], "statistics": [], "name": "GruntBuggler!", "rpgdesigner": ["Mark Kibbe"], "rpgproducer": ["Mark Kibbe"], "average": "0", "usersrated": "0", "rpgitemversion": ["Standard Edition"], "rpgissuearticle": ["Capsule Reviews"], "rpggenre": ["Fantasy"], "rpgpublisher": ["Basement Games Unlimited, LLC"], "rpgcategory": ["Core Rules (min needed to play)"], "poll": [], "description": "From the introduction:<br/><br/>Realistic combat mechanics!

It is a generic ruleset for use with published low magic worlds or a world of your own creation. With some tweaking, LFG could handle most fantasy settings, but the system assumes low fantasy.<br/><br/>LFG is rules light, with a heavy emphasis on GM rulings. It's a hybrid of old school and modern game design, based on the 1d20 Open Game Licence.<br/><br/>Combat is designed to be fast and engaging, with minimal waiting between turns. Creativity is encouraged via martial exploits and magic.  Battle is genuinely dangerous and every skirmish takes a toll. The threat of serious injury or death is never far away.<br/><br/>LFG worlds tend to mimic our own classical or medieval periods. Humans are the default player race. Magic and fantastic monsters exist, but are very rare.<br/><br/>Magic is not only rare, it is dark and inherently dangerous. Sorcery is a power not meant for mortals, and adventurers engage with it at their peril.<br/><br/>LFG is about exploring the unknown; delving into the lost places of the world to unearth new mysteries. Player characters are not epic heroes charged with saving the world; they are bold adventurers seeking riches and glory.<br/><br/>LFG is made for short, episodic adventures in an open world. Mechanics and random tables support GM improvisation, empowering the referee to handle any situation or side trek.<br/><br/>"}, "209253": {"boardgamedesigner": ["Troy Shull"], "average": "0", "poll": [], "name": "SECAN: The Number Puzzle Game", "playingtime": "15", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": ["Tile Placement"], "yearpublished": "2016", "usersrated": "0", "maxplayers": "6", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3196345_t.jpg", "boardgameartist": ["Troy Shull"], "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["Bear in Mind Company"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3196345.jpg", "boardgameversion": ["first edition"], "maxplaytime": "0", "boardgamecategory": ["Math", "Number", "Puzzle"], "age": "10", "minplaytime": "15", "description": "SECAN is an innovative number puzzle game designed to challenge your mental arithmetic and combinatorical skills.

This game consists of two separate decks of cards: one of 28 Pitching cards and the other of 30 Hitting/Fielding cards. Also included are a small glossy baseball diamond and scoring box, erasable crayons for marking the score and wooden discs for baserunners.<br/><br/>To play, the Pitching cards are shuffled and placed face down between the players. The Hitting/Fielding cards are shuffled, and each player is dealt a hand of five. The batting player must discard and replace any Pickoff card, while the fielding player must discard and replace any Error card.<br/><br/>For each turn, the fielding player turns over the top Pitching card, which shows either a Ball, a green Fastball, blue Curve, yellow Changeup or a red Slider. The Batting player draws a card from Hitting/Fielding deck and then must try to play a card that matches the color of the pitch. Each of these cards has a number from 1 to 4. The fielding player then draws a card from the Hitting/Fielding deck and tries to match the color of the hitting card. A color match with a number equal to or higher than the batting card is an out; if the fielding card is lower, the difference is the number of bases hit/advanced. A card that doesn't match in color counts as a zero.<br/><br/>The batting player may use an Error card to automatically advance the batter and all runners by one base. The fielding player may use a Pick Off card to remove a runner on base. A fielding card 2 higher than the batting card is a double play if a runner is on first; 3 higher allows a double play of any two runners.<br/><br/>"}, "209312": {"rpgdesigner": ["Alex Riggs"], "rpg": ["Pathfinder System Compatible Product"], "poll": [], "name": "Horror Feats A-B", "rpgartist": ["Tanya Sangsnit"], "rpgproducer": ["Jason Nelson"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3186739.jpg", "usersrated": "1", "rpgitemversion": ["PDF version"], "average": "6", "statistics": [], "rpggenre": ["Fantasy (High Fantasy)", "Horror (Supernatural)"], "rpgpublisher": ["Legendary Games"], "rpgcategory": ["Sourcebook (rules/options to enhance play)"], "rpgseries": ["Horror Plug-Ins", "Mythic Minis"], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3186739_t.jpg", "description": "From publisher blurb:<br/><br/>Horror Feats A-B is the latest Mythic Mini devoted to exploring the terrible tricks that desperate heroes and vile villains alike might unleash in a horror-themed campaign using the new Pathfinder Roleplaying Game Horror Adventures rulebook.

Calling themselves reapers, these necromancers found ways to coax scraps of soul back together, to give lost souls a new lease on life, and to grant these aggregate beings a means of interacting with the world once more. Necromancy, and the rest of magic, has since moved on from what is now considered a product of the formative, dark age of magic, but certain circles still remember its power, and with every advance the rest of the world makes, the reaper gains a new tool.<br/><br/>We've all been there. You play a rogue for a few sessions, then the rogue gets boring, and you want to try a new character, but the narrative demands that you remain what you are and now you've gone and made friction in the game group. For all those suffering altaholics out there, Interjection Games is proud to present the reaper, a blank slate base class with versatility at its core. By herself, a reaper is more-or-less a commoner, but she slowly nurtures a group of soulsown, each of which allows her to act like a totally different class when the two of them are bound together. Trying another character is just a binary swap away!<br/><br/>Note: The combination of tricks from a wide variety of base classes makes classes on the lower end of the power spectrum, such as rogue, monk (sans archetypes), and fighter more-or-less totally obsolete with a reaper in play. This does not make the reaper itself overpowered&minus; the class is still strictly less powerful than any full caster on the books and fits somewhere around the power level of a well-built bard&minus; but rather highlights some of the issues inherent in the original source material when it was penned a decade-and-a-half ago. Still, the reaper has an enormous footprint and the average power level of games using it will probably increase now that the various low-tier &quot;trap&quot; classes have been ousted.<br/><br/>Product Features<br/><br/>    The reaper base class<br/>    Well over 10,000 words of talents in four subtypes: arcane, divine, martial, and primal<br/>    No feats and no archetypes - the reaper's very design has it vacuum up character concepts from all extant crunch canon; it really doesn't need them!<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>"}, "209341": {"rpgdesigner": ["Jacob Blackmon"], "rpg": ["Mutants & Masterminds (3rd Edition)"], "poll": [], "name": "Sacred Lands", "rpgartist": ["Jacob Blackmon"], "rpgproducer": ["Jacob Blackmon"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3186859.jpg", "usersrated": "0", "rpgitemversion": ["PDF version"], "average": "0", "statistics": [], "rpggenre": ["Action / Adventure (Superheroes)"], "rpgpublisher": ["Rogue Genius Games"], "rpgcategory": ["Sourcebook (rules/options to enhance play)"], "rpgseries": ["Super Powered Legends", "Super-Powered by M&M"], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3186859_t.jpg", "description": "From publisher blurb:<br/><br/>I Am Jungle King, and This is MY Domain.<br/><br/>The Sacred Lands are a realm of prehistoric adventure, closely tied to Earth.<br/><br/>Behold the unique, human and non-human denizens:<br/><br/>    Alraune: These floral humanoids evolved from carnivorous plants.<br/>    Humans: Numerous human tribes descending from humans who accidentally stumbled into the prehistoric dimension.<br/>    Saurians: The greatest threat to the human inhabitants of the Sacred Lands are the Saurians; a race of evolved dinosaurs.<br/>    Zebrar: This race of equine humanoid evolved from African zebras.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Then there are a few notable individuals as well:<br/><br/>    Stenops (PL 11): a saurian scientist, who believes that by merging saurians and humans, he will create a new race of super-beings that will dominate the Sacred Lands.<br/>    Jungle King (PL 8): Protector of the Sacred Lands.

Win the game by collecting endorsements, popularity, and media points. Attack your opponents with attack ads and scandals. Manage your campaign funds and win the Presidency!<br/><br/>In Election Frenzy, there are 3 rounds, and each round is split into two phases.<br/><br/>In Phase 1, the Campaign phase, players try to build the strongest hand possible, by collecting cards in the Popularity, Endorsements, and Media categories (suits); similar to poker, Uno, and Sushi-Go.<br/><br/>In Phase 2, the Attack phase, players use attacking cards to either burn or steal desired cards from their opponents; similar to Go Fish, and Bang!<br/><br/>The winner of each suit receives 2 electoral points, while the runner up receives 1. (Example: 1st place in Popularity = 2 pts. 2nd place in Endorsements = 1 pt. 3rd place in Media = 0 pts. TOTAL = 3 pts)<br/><br/>After 3 rounds, the player with the most electoral points is the President!<br/><br/>There are some really fun nuances to the game. Each character has strengths and weaknesses, based on the real life politicians who are being parodied. For example, Hillary has a bonus each round for the Endorsements, while Donald has a bonus each round for Media.<br/><br/>Each character also starts the game with a fixed amount of money. Money is needed to launch attacks. There is also money scattered throughout the deck, so even if you spend all of your cash, there is still a chance to replenish your funds by drawing the right cards.<br/><br/>"}, "209354": {"rpgartist": ["Fl\u00e8che bleue", "Bobcar", "\u00c9douard Manet", "Maximilien", "La Moiti\u00e9"], "statistics": [], "name": "RDA'Zine (Issue 02 - Sep 2016)", "rpgdesigner": ["G\u00e9raud \"Myvyrrian\" G", "Kadnax", "James Manez", "Maximilien", "Outsider", "Pelon"], "rpgproducer": ["Pelon"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3188227.jpg", "usersrated": "0", "average": "0", "rpgissue": ["RDA'Zine"], "rpgissuearticle": ["Edito", "Festin de p\u00e8lerins", "Interview de Coralie David et J\u00e9r\u00f4me \u00ab Brand \u00bb Larr\u00e9", "La Guerre du Croissant", "Les beaux l\u00e0 !", "Les nouvelles du forum", "RuneQuest, le survivant", "Spyashchaya Krasavitsa", "Traumagie", "Traum\u00e9di\u00e9val", "Twilight at Noon !"], "rpg": ["R\u00eave de Dragon (1st & 2nd Editions)", "Star Marx", "Trauma"], "rpgpublisher": ["(Self-Published)"], "rpgissueversion": ["PDF Version"], "poll": [], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3188227_t.jpg", "description": "User Summary<br/><br/>Issue 02<br/><br/>- Contemporary: Nuclear apocalypse.<br/>- Interview with Coralie David and J&eacute;r&ocirc;me &laquo; Brand &raquo; Larr&eacute;.<br/>- Trauma in a medieval setting.<br/>- Scenarios Star Marx, R&ecirc;ve de Dragon, Trauma, Trauma medieval.<br/>- RuneQuest, the survivor.<br/><br/>"}, "209355": {"rpgdesigner": ["Matthew Carlson"], "rpgitemversion": ["ASCII Version"], "poll": [], "name": "Garak's End", "rpgartist": ["Matthew Carlson"], "rpgproducer": ["Matthew Carlson"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3187639.jpg", "usersrated": "0", "average": "0", "statistics": [], "rpg": ["AD&D Second Edition (2e) Compatible Products"], "rpgpublisher": ["(Web published)"], "rpgcategory": ["Scenario / Adventure / Module"], "rpggenre": ["Fantasy (High Fantasy)"], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3187639_t.jpg", "description": "From the introduction:<br/><br/>The [player characters] are traveling along a lonely road not too far from civilization.

The baseball stadium, scoreboards and the dice need to be assembled after separating the pieces.<br/><br/>Players draft their teams from the pool of 9 red and 9 blue players. The red players are long ball hitters and use the red die; the blue players hit more ground balls and use the blue die.<br/><br/>For each at-bat, the batting player rolls the appropriate die, which produces ball, strike, foul, fly ball or ground ball. When the ball is hit, players take one of the fly ball or ground ball cards and follow the results, which range from home runs to double plays.

The goal each day is to collect enough cards within your ranch in an attempt to reach the total value needed for that day, without going over. This seems simple enough, but other players will attempt to sabotage your ranch, using animals, babies, sunlight and darkness to scare, chase, overpopulate, and even eat things within your ranch.<br/><br/>Setup:<br/>Deal a Player Starting Card, face-up, to each player. Set the matching player score markers on the Start/Finish space of the game board. Shuffle the 60- card play deck and place it face down on the game board in the space labeled &ldquo;Draw.&rdquo; Randomly determine the first starting player, who will also deal. The starting player changes each day, rotating clockwise.<br/><br/>Play:<br/>At the beginning of each day, roll the 10-sided die and set it in in a position where all can see. Add 10 to this die roll. This is the target value your ranch needs to obtain for the day. For example: If a 7 is rolled, the target value for the day is 17.<br/><br/>The starting player deals 1 card face-up into each player&rsquo;s ranch and 2 cards face-down to each player&rsquo;s hand. A player&rsquo;s hand is always hidden from other players.<br/><br/>Ranch:<br/>The initial face-up card dealt to each player is set directly to the right of the Player Starting Cards. This signifies the beginning of each player&rsquo;s ranch. The card directly to the right of the Player Starting Cards is always protected. This means that it cannot be removed by effects of other players but may be removed by a player&rsquo;s own effect. Any card played on a person&rsquo;s ranch is placed to the right of all the cards currently in that player&rsquo;s ranch. Whenever cards are removed, the remaining cards slide left to fill in any gaps.<br/><br/>Actions:<br/>When it is your turn, you can perform 1 of the following 4 actions:<br/>1. Play a card of any color into your own ranch. This card is placed to the right of all the cards currently in your ranch. If the card has an effect, the current player may resolve the effect but is not required to do so.<br/>2. Play a card into an opponent&rsquo;s ranch that matches the color of that player&rsquo;s starting card or the color of a card already in that player&rsquo;s ranch. This card is placed to the right of all the cards currently in that player&rsquo;s ranch. If the card has an effect, the current player may resolve the effect but is not required to do so.<br/>3. Destroy your own protected card. This can only be done if you have more than 1 Playing Card in your ranch. When the protected card is destroyed, the remaining cards slide left while the new leftmost ranch card next to your Player Starting Card becomes the new protected card.<br/>4. Discard a card. This allows you to draw a new card and also speeds up the current day.<br/><br/>At the end of your turn, you draw back up to two cards.<br/><br/>Special Rules:<br/>If a player plays a card in their own ranch that matches a color already in their ranch, they may choose to destroy their own leftmost (protected) card as part of the play.<br/><br/>Some card effects remove other cards from a ranch. When these effects resolve, the player playing the card chooses the target. The target can be a card in ANY player&rsquo;s ranch, not just the ranch of the player where the card was played. The target card may not be a protected card or the card immediately to the left of a special Moon card. Important: The player playing the card is not required to resolve any card effect and may choose to ignore that effect.<br/><br/>The following keywords all remove cards into the discard pile:<br/>&bull; Scare<br/>&bull; Chase<br/>&bull; Destroy<br/>&bull; Eat<br/>&bull; Stalk<br/>&bull; Stomp<br/><br/>Ending a Day:<br/>As cards are removed or discarded, they are collected in a discard pile in the center of the game board. When the number of cards in the discard pile equals twice the number of players in the game, the day ends. For example: In a 3-player game, the day ends when the 6th card is placed in the discard pile.<br/><br/>Scoring:<br/>When the day is over, the player with the highest ranch value, without going over the target value for the day, scores 1 point for each player they beat. In addition, each other player also scores 1 point for each player that they beat, so position at the end of each day is important. Players that exceed the target total when the day ends score no points.<br/><br/>Winning the Game:<br/>A standard game is played up to 15 points. When a player exceeds 15 points at the end of a day, the game is over, and the highest total (or tie for highest) is the winner. In the case of a tie, the players may share the victory or may play an additional day as a tiebreaker.<br/><br/>2-Player Rules:<br/>When playing with 2 players, it is recommended to not end a day until 6 cards have been removed or discarded instead of 4.<br/><br/>"}, "209411": {"boardgamedesigner": ["Joel Pellegrino Hotham"], "average": "7", "poll": [], "name": "Venecitas", "playingtime": "45", "minplayers": "1", "boardgamemechanic": ["Dice Rolling", "Set Collection", "Simultaneous Action Selection"], "yearpublished": "2016", "usersrated": "6", "maxplayers": "4", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3199883_t.jpg", "boardgameartist": ["Joel Pellegrino Hotham", "Silvina Fontenla"], "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["JuegosdeMesa.com.ar"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3199883.jpg", "boardgameversion": ["First edition"], "maxplaytime": "45", "boardgamecategory": ["Collectible Components", "Dice"], "age": "10", "minplaytime": "30", "description": "A strategy game to turn you into a Venetian artist.<br/><br/>A game which using a die with colors, they will be getting venecitas to be accumulating and redeem points.

Feeding from prey isn&rsquo;t just sucking on a juice box; it&rsquo;s going to a fine restaurant.<br/>You will go to any length to feed. The craving to do so is ever-present. Even when you swallow your fill of blood, the devil whispers in your ear, tempting you to drink more. Go hungry and the beast takes over. The beast is the relentless beating in your lifeless heart; it craves excess, cruelty, and destruction. When the beast wins, you lose your free will and devolve into a mindless monster. Your humanity &ndash; your connection to what it means to be human &ndash; is the only thing that holds the beast at bay, and it is a flickering flame in the windswept darkness. Between feast and famine, restraint and recklessness, a predator&rsquo;s unlife offers more than an eternal, blood-junkie existence. Immortality is the reward that awaits a predator who can balance on the knife edge.<br/>Predators are the apex: the union of man&rsquo;s scheming ingenuity and beast&rsquo;s instinctive ferocity. Though man and lesser creatures are sheep to the wolf, the wolf is among a pack of wolves. And in this pack, the most cunning and ruthless is the alpha. All predators envy that power and prestige. They nip at each other nightly, fighting over the scraps. Each hopes to one night rule the pack. Thus, from the greatest predator to the least, all are embroiled in a ceaseless conflict of intrigue and bloodshed.<br/>This is what it means to be a predator.

Charlie Kibler&rsquo;s groundbreaking design covered the battle for Stalingrad around the &ldquo;Krasny Barrikady&rdquo; (or Red Barricades) ordnance factory on two historically accurate maps. Red Barricades offered a new ASL experience, introducing the concept of Campaign Games (CGs), multi-scenario battles spread over several days, alongside traditional scenarios depicting discrete historical actions. Three CGs and seven standalone scenarios covered the epic struggle for the heart of Stalin&rsquo;s city. The CGs presented a special challenge, as players not only directed their forces in action, but also built and customized their orders of battle, agonizing over how best to spend their precious resources to achieve overall victory in a grueling campaign. Charlie now brings us RED OCTOBER. This follow-on HASL adds two new maps, expanding the playing area covered in Red Barricades to include the &ldquo;Krasny Oktyabr&rdquo; (or Red October) factory complex. RED OCTOBER features three CGs and seven scenarios. Honed under the playtest guidance of Gary Fortenberry, Red October has now been submitted to MMP.<br/><br/>The two modules are combined into one package: Red Factories. The source files for Red Barricades are no longer available, so Charlie will take this opportunity to paint all four maps in a consistent style to assure they match. This also allows us to update the original Red Barricades material, taking into account accumulated clarifications and errata. Over the years a great deal of follow-on material has been released for Red Barricades, including a fourth campaign game. We are consolidating this material to create an expanded version of Red Barricades as part of the new release.<br/><br/>"}, "209458": {"rpgartist": ["(Uncredited)"], "rpgitemversion": ["ASCII Version"], "rpgseries": ["King's Assassin"], "name": "Jester", "rpgdesigner": ["Kristian \"SSM\" Lund"], "rpgproducer": ["Kristian \"SSM\" Lund"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3189112.jpg", "usersrated": "0", "average": "0", "statistics": [], "rpg": ["AD&D First Edition (1e) Compatible Products"], "rpgpublisher": ["(Web published)"], "poll": [], "rpgcategory": ["Scenario / Adventure / Module"], "rpggenre": ["Fantasy (High Fantasy)"], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3189112_t.jpg", "description": "From the introduction:<br/><br/>The [player characters] are invited to a two day feast at the king's castle.

Discovering that ragtag teams of utterly horrible musicians have been sneaking in and using the theatre for practice sessions, he decides to put every last remaining bit of his fortune into organising a tournament and invites these completely untalented teams to participate. They would be challenged to perform various musical scores in an extremely short amount of time. This is deliberate just so the true talents will be quickly picked out from the rest. The winning group shall hence be personally groomed by the Grand Dean himself into a world class orchestra team, where they would properly represent the currently dysfunct Theatre and make it famous again!<br/><br/>You are ringleaders of your own groups of musicians, and this is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to become famous. Starting from a skeleton crew of horrendous talents, you will grow in strength and ultimately evolve into a mighty orchestra fit for any world stage.<br/><br/>Cantabile Blitz is played in Stages, which are then broken down into Performances. Every player starts off with the same set of basic dice, each die representing a musician of one type of instrument. At the end of every performance, the Grand Dean will reward better performing groups with more cash, which in turn allows them to recruit better and more musicians into their team. This is represented by more types of dice, eventually reaching a fully fleshed out orchestra. There are no turns in this game, and the actual musical performances are in real time. As soon as a musical score even remotely resembles its original tune by any of the groups' plays, the group can quickly submit their recording to the Grand Dean. However, the group that submits the score and ends that performance does not necessarily always win that round. They do have bonus points for doing so, but other bands might have raked up more points by completing more segments in the music sheet!<br/><br/>"}, "209484": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3192746.jpg", "poll": [], "boardgamedesigner": ["Keith Matejka"], "statistics": [], "yearpublished": "2016", "maxplayers": "4", "boardgameartist": ["John Ariosa", "Luis Francisco"], "boardgamepublisher": ["Thunderworks Games"], "maxplaytime": "90", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3192746_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "60", "boardgamecategory": ["Expansion for Base-game"], "description": "One punchboard that includes:<br/><br/><br/>     Double-sided (Male/Female) Frogkin Race Character Sheet <br/>     10 Gold Coins <br/>     6 Additional Charisma Tokens<br/><br/><br/>", "minplayers": "1", "boardgameversion": ["English first edition"], "name": "Roll Player: Frogkin Promo Punchboard", "playingtime": "90", "boardgamemechanic": ["Dice Rolling", "Set Collection"], "average": "7.74545", "boardgameexpansion": [], "usersrated": "33", "age": "10"}, "209485": {"rpgartist": ["(Uncredited)"], "rpgitemversion": ["DOC Version"], "poll": [], "name": "Legends and Lore: The Philippines", "rpgdesigner": ["Dion Fernandez"], "rpgproducer": ["Donn King"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3192033.jpg", "usersrated": "0", "average": "0", "statistics": [], "rpg": ["AD&D Second Edition (2e) Compatible Products"], "rpgpublisher": ["(Web published)"], "rpgcategory": ["Sourcebook (rules/options to enhance play)"], "rpggenre": ["Fantasy (High Fantasy)"], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3192033_t.jpg", "description": "From the introduction:<br/><br/>This is a non-canon addendum to Legends & Lore, featuring new deities taken from Philippine folklore.<br/><br/>Situated in the South China Sea between China, Indochina and the islands of Indonesia, the cluster of islands known as the Philippines have always been a virtual crossroads of cultures.
