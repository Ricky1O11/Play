The game involves selection, bowling, batting, and active fielding, allowing for short over fast action games through to the complex realms of strategy found in test play. Although, like with cricket itself, the basics are simple and easily learnt, it will inevitably take a lifetime to master.<br/><br/>No prior knowledge of cricket is needed to play the game which is suitable for the whole family and up to 22 players. In essence the side that scores the most &quot;runs&quot; wins, though selecting the right players, the order they play, and where they are positioned all affect the outcome of the game. The basics of Wicked Wickets are really quite simple; the bowler throws the ball, in this case the red ball shaped die, and the batsman &quot;hits&quot; it by throwing the buff bat-shaped die. Adding the scores together shows how far the ball goes using the long flight measure. If the batsman's score is higher than the bowlers, the ball &quot;flies&quot; in the air; if the bowler's score is higher than the batsman's, then it is struck along the ground. The yellow counter and dice are used to show which direction the ball goes. The short pace measure is simply used to measure the distance players move and the green die is mostly used for fielding. The game cards give the individual abilities of the players affecting how and where they are used. However, as with most games there is often more to it than first meets the eye. --From the publisher<br/><br/>Official website: <a target='_blank' href='http://www.boadiceasbackyard.com/' rel='nofollow'>http://www.boadiceasbackyard.com/</a><br/><br/>"}, "87097": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic885182.jpg", "poll": [], "boardgamedesigner": ["Tom Morin", "Carl Nogueira"], "statistics": [], "yearpublished": "2010", "maxplayers": "0", "boardgameartist": ["Nicol\u00e1s Eskubi"], "boardgamepublisher": ["Multi-Man Publishing"], "maxplaytime": "0", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic885182_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "0", "boardgamecategory": ["Expansion for Base-game", "Wargame", "World War II"], "description": "&quot;Out of the Bunker&quot; is a package of 14 ASL scenarios from the ASL Fanzine &quot;Dispatches from the Bunker&quot;.<br/><br/>The scenarios include some of MMP's favorites:<br/><br/>     Riding the Coattails, Poland 1939<br/>     Point 247, France 1940<br/>     Brasche Encounter, France 1940<br/>     Headhunting for Bloody Huns, Crete 1941<br/>     Clearing Kamienka, Russia 1941<br/>     First Clash in Tunisia, Tunisia 1942<br/>     Crisis at Kasserine, Tunisia 1943<br/>     Unhappy Trails, Bougainville 1943<br/>     First Crack at Hellzapoppin' Ridge, Bougainville 1943<br/>     The Men From Zadig, France 1944<br/>     Avril Action, France 1944<br/>     Block at Ville-Sur-Illon, France 1944<br/>     A Hotly Contested Crossroads, Germany 1945<br/>     Pursuing Kobayashi, The Philippines 1945<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": ["First Edition"], "average": "7.70833", "name": "Out of the Bunker #1", "playingtime": "0", "boardgamemechanic": ["Hex-and-Counter"], "age": "0", "boardgameexpansion": [], "usersrated": "24", "boardgamefamily": ["Advanced Squad Leader"]}, "87098": {"poll": [], "name": "Wit", "playingtime": "0", "boardgamecompilation": ["Wit / Farkel Double Game Pack"], "minplayers": "0", "yearpublished": "0", "usersrated": "0", "maxplayers": "0", "average": "0", "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["AMJI Games"], "boardgameversion": ["First edition"], "maxplaytime": "0", "boardgamecategory": ["Card Game", "Word Game"], "age": "0", "minplaytime": "0", "description": "Paraphrased from the game's instruction sheet:<br/><br/>A word game for two to four players, utilizing a deck of 54 cards with individual letters on them (2 of each constanant other than Z (of which there is one) and 3 of A,E,I,O and U.

Since the late fifties we have come to know about them (all the different thems). At first we were castigated, called nuts, the men in white coats came like seagulls on a sandwich. But slowly and surely we made connections, found out there were others who had seen what we had seen. Most of us came from the espionage scene, it was our business to go poking around where no one was meant to be. But we made other allies too, occultists, mad, er fringe scientists, ecologists, hustlers and funk cosmonauts.<br/><br/>We knew the world was in trouble. We knew no one else was going to do anything.

Incorporating elements of the Elemental Dimension of Magic, Inglemia goes back to the Prime Material roots of the eternal conflict between the Jeshatan and the magic hating Knah'tan.<br/><br/>Includes: 144 Spells, 9 Monsters, 12 Exotic Materials, 28 Unique Magic Items, 7 Gods, 19 Unique Feats, 20 Noble Houses, 10 Secret Societies, 7 Gods, 12 Unique Kingdoms, Self Replicating Runes, Mirror Tubes, and 5 Strategic Session Summaries!<br/><br/>From Introduction:<br/><br/>The Fate of Inglemia is not a module. It is a product designed to give the GM a primer to establish a set of parameters for an Epic campaign involving the City State of Inglemia and its encounter with their ancient cousins, the Jeshatan of the Elemental Dimension of Magic. This product incorporates elements from the products The Elemental Dimension of Magic.<br/><br/>Thematically speaking, the game is designed for characters of around 15th level, allowing them to go up in level every two sessions well into the epic levels and beyond. While it is certainly possible to use this product for a low level game, the GM also has the tools to allow his players to be movers and shakers on a primal level.<br/><br/>While the core strategic campaign was originally designed to have the players be agents that defend Inglemia, they could just as easily be agents bent on its destruction. Inglemia certainly is not without plenty of enemies nor is it without flaw.

The 100-card deck contains fifty creatures with different characteristics that determine how the creature interacts with the orbs (throw accuracy, catching ability, and throwing range), how fast a creature can move, and how effective it is in battle. Many creatures also have unique magic abilities that can be used to manipulate gameplay.<br/><br/>When players summon creatures, corresponding creature tokens (miniature cards that stand erect in cardstands) enter the 20x20 square gameboard, known as the Arena, where the orb and portal tokens await the contestants. In a four-player game, players may compete in teams of two. Goals are scored by creatures that maneuver an orb token onto a portal token by picking up, carrying, handing off, and throwing the orb with their creature tokens. Additionally, players can score goals (known as Skins) by successfully destroying opponents' creatures in combat. Combat results are determined by dice rolls as are the success of throws and catches of the orb between creatures. A number of Alter Reality cards allow players to change the values of individual rolls which make the outcome of every roll something that can quickly be challenged.<br/><br/>Enchantment cards can be played on creatures to grant them enhanced stats or new abilities as well as make them hardier in combat. Event cards, such a Lightning Storms or Fumbles can change the flow the game in seconds forcing players to constantly rethink their strategies for scoring or engaging in combat.<br/><br/>The game ends when a player or team reaches three goals, one of which must be a non-skins goal. No lead is safe and no two matches are ever the same making each game a unique and often humorous experience.

In HopperDame with promotion rule you win by capturing all the opponent's pieces. Pieces move forwards and sideways, orthogonally or diagonally, by shifting to an adjacent square, or by jumping over an adjacent friendly piece (also termed 'hopper'). Jumps must only occur over a piece of the same colour. It's not allowable to step or jump backwards. The exception to this is the &quot;king&quot;, which can jump over any piece, and step in all directions.<br/><br/>To promote to king one must conquer the &quot;castles&quot;, that is, the corner squares behind the enemy position, by holding both these positions with a piece, so called &quot;double-promotion&quot;. If a piece steps or jumps into the enemy corner then it is promoted to king only if the other enemy corner is already occupied by a friendly piece. Also, a piece which steps into the corner square may later be promoted if the other corner has subsequently become occupied by a friendly piece. The promotion is then done by dropping the piece on the same square. But this costs a move.<br/><br/>HopperDame employs the rule of exchange-capture: the counter jumps over a friendly counter. If the square where it lands is occupied by an enemy counter, then this is captured. It is only when leaping that the counter can make captures. A leaping counter may continue to leap over friendly counters until there are no more to leap over or the player decides to stop. It's not allowable to jump back to the square you just came from.<br/><br/>Note that capture is only made when jumping. Thus, a single piece cannot make a capture by itself. The exception to this is the king, which has an additional capture method: it can capture an adjacent enemy piece directly, like a king in chess.<br/><br/>"}, "87173": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic900914.jpg", "poll": [], "boardgamedesigner": ["Charlie Bink", "Sean Brown"], "statistics": [], "yearpublished": "2011", "maxplayers": "6", "boardgameartist": ["Paul Niemeyer", "David Oram"], "boardgamepublisher": ["Eagle-Gryphon Games"], "maxplaytime": "120", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic900914_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "120", "boardgamecategory": ["Expansion for Base-game", "Science Fiction", "Trains", "Transportation"], "description": "Take your Age of Steam experience to the next dimension!

Every world has its own definition and manifestation. Indeed, more often than not a resident god controls the threads of the arcane and radiates them through the fabric of the time. Yet, magic seems to transcend these origins. When gods die, their magic often lingers. Magic manifests in more than a dozen forms, but, in the end, it is still magic.<br/><br/>It is easy to point out fire as an element. We see it about us every day, just as we see water, or the blowing wind and most certainly earth. Magic warps and twists and follows the commands of those who call upon it.<br/>Yet, at the same time, it works upon the world. Magic seems to know what it is doing, yet has no direct mind of its own. It transcends definition and limitation. Attempts to bottle it and place boundaries upon it, saying &quot;Here then lie the boundaries of what is the Arcane,&quot; fail time and again. Indeed, with magic, more often than not, the only consistent rule is that whatever rules you establish will eventually be broken.<br/><br/>This is the manifestation of magic. It breaks rules. It binds logic and forces it through a tiny mesh of human understanding. It pretends to follow pattern and format, but in the end those who use it end up dust and it continues flowing. Gods die; mortals fade; entire races become extinct and, yet, the magic remains. This, then, is how one defines an element. Magic is a fundamental building block of the universe, as basic a part of existence as anything else.<br/><br/>What is it? Ultimately, magic is whatever you want it to be, literally. On the sunken world of Deris\u2010bar, magic only works in proper conjunction with the stars. On the world of Lykra\u2010han, magic works only by patient blood sacrifice of a willing subject. In the world of the Throne of the Emerald Dawn, magic flows as freely as air, and all wield it to one degree or another. Each realm has separate rules that govern its magic, generally regulated through the will of powerful minds manifested as gods. And yet leave them, and quite often their rules cease to apply. Paradoxically, despite having different rules governing its nature from realm to realm, magic often produces identical effects in each, such as fireballs and lightning bolts.<br/><br/>"}, "87193": {"poll": [], "name": "Wenchkins", "playingtime": "60", "minplayers": "1", "boardgamemechanic": ["Area Movement", "Dice Rolling", "Hex-and-Counter"], "yearpublished": "2007", "usersrated": "0", "maxplayers": "2", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic853170_t.jpg", "average": "0", "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["(Unknown)"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic853170.jpg", "boardgameversion": ["First edition"], "maxplaytime": "60", "boardgamecategory": ["Fantasy", "Fighting", "Print & Play"], "age": "14", "minplaytime": "60", "description": "One or two player square and counter wargame by Sir Basil about a battle between Amazonian-like warrior women called Wenchkins.

It takes place in Wterdeep, also known as the City of Splendors, which lies on the continent of Faer&ucirc;n in the Forgotten Relams Campaign Setting. Famed for the legendary dungeon called Undermountain that lies beneath its streets, Waterdeep draws adventurers from all over Faer&ucirc;n. Dug by the shield dwarves of Clan Melairkyn and their successors, Undermountain consists of nine major levels and fourteen sublevels. Halaster, the Mad Mage (detailed on page 180 of the Forgotten Realms Campaign Setting and updated on page 294 of the Epic Level Handbook), rules this sprawling complex. However, many powerful creatures have carved out personal demesnes within the sprawling caverns and chambers of Halaster&rsquo;s Halls, and the Mad Mage of Undermountain has largely ignored their presence.<br/><br/>A confused tangle of sublevels between levels 4 and 6 of the main dungeon has come to be known as the Dark Levels of Undermountain. Since many of these sublevels are accessible only via portals, few have been explored by outsiders. Several of the Dark Levels, all ruled by undead creatures, are collectively known as dooms.<br/><br/>One of these sublevels, known as Vanrakdoom, is controlled by the Church of Shar. Penetration of this area is a mission appropriate for a group of four 17th-level nonevil characters.

This version of Demogorgon&rsquo;s aspect is different from that presented in the Miniatures Handbook, since it focuses on a different side of the Prince of Demons. Several of the demon lords could have aspects that are different than the ones you see here, because an aspect is one facet of a demon lord rather than a lesser version of the whole package. If you don&rsquo;t like the aspect presented here for your demon lord of choice, choose a different &quot;view&quot; of the demon lord and make your own. For example, Juiblex has a few combat tricks, plus a few spell-like and ooze-related powers. If you want a more oozy aspect of Juiblex, take away the grappling and constriction powers and give it the create slime and summon ooze abilities.

Such changes include the following.<br/><br/>&gt; The number of 5-foot squares corresponding to a creature&rsquo;s<br/>speed,<br/>&gt; A separate attack entry for any monster that has only<br/>one attack form, or whose full attack is identical to its<br/>normal attack,<br/>&gt; Changing &quot;Face/Reach&quot; to &quot;Space/Reach&quot; in cases<br/>where the corresponding numbers remain the same,<br/>&gt; Changing a spell&rsquo;s casting time from &quot;1 action&quot; to &quot;1<br/>standard action,&quot;<br/>&gt; Changing a magic item&rsquo;s &quot;Market Price&quot; to &quot;Price,&quot; and<br/>so forth. Changes such as these are left in the reader&rsquo;s<br/>hands. All other pertinent adjustments, however, are<br/>given here.<br/><br/>Also included with this document is a map that was dropped from the book for space reasons. With this bonus map and the changes indicated here, your Ghostwalk campaign can be better than ever before.

Thompson promised to contribute a $10,000 donation to the charity of choice of Paul Eibeler (then-chairman of Take-Two Interactive, one of the game companies most heavily criticized by Thompson) if such a game were released. However, he has since claimed that the proposal was only a joke, and currently, no charity has been designated by Eibeler.

In the shadow of an old palm tree four bold nomad sons are planning a dare-devil adventure. What is their plan? Will they really try to cross the desert by the infamous west route? Don't they know the treacherous quicksand and all those other dangers which lie in wait for them? Have no fear! With cautiousness, good companionship and some luck this route is passable. Each caravan still has one place open - dare this adventure and join them!<br/><br/>The rules:<br/>Each player has three pawns with which to reach the large oasis in the middle of the board. Pawns are moved by throwing the die. A pawn can get stuck in quicksand, and then has to be rescued by another pawn of the same player. (Optional: or by rolling a six.) A rescued pawn is carried on the back of the other to the next oasis, where the pawn which was stuck has to rest till another pawn ends its turn there, or a six is rolled by the player.<br/><br/>When a pawn ends its move on a field where another pawn already is, it can climb on the others back, and be carried/ported by it. This is possible with both your own or other players pawns. (Multiply carrying is allowed.) However: a carried pawn should hop off  before reaching the next oasis, as once the porter reaches it, it will drop off all carried pawns in the oasis! And likewise with resting pawns from being stuck in the quicksand: formerly carried pawns will have to rest till another pawn ends its turn there, or a six is rolled by the corresponding player.<br/><br/>When a pawn ends it turn on a place from which a short track continues (shown by a road sign), this may be taken on the next turn. Any carried pawns are carried along.<br/>To reach the end oasis, a pawn has to reach it, either by throwing the required number exactly or higher.<br/><br/>Winner of this adventurous journey is the player who has crossed the desert with his or her three pawns first.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": ["First edition", "Second edition"], "age": "5", "name": "Huckepack durch die W\u00fcste", "playingtime": "45", "boardgamemechanic": ["Roll / Spin and Move"], "average": "0", "usersrated": "0", "boardgamefamily": ["Desert Theme", "Game of Goose"]}, "87423": {"rpgartist": ["(Uncredited)"], "rpgitemversion": ["PDF version"], "poll": [], "name": "Collapse Field Simulation Manual", "rpgdesigner": ["Christopher Brandon"], "rpgproducer": ["(Uncredited)"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic851444.jpg", "usersrated": "1", "average": "5", "statistics": [], "rpg": ["COLLAPSE"], "rpgpublisher": ["(Self-Published)"], "rpgcategory": ["Core Rules (min needed to play)"], "rpggenre": ["Science Fiction (Post Apocalypse)"], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic851444_t.jpg", "description": "<br/>User Summary<br/><br/>The Field Simulation Manual is a free player's guide for the Collapse RPG.<br/><br/>It includes:<br/><br/><br/>     Dice mechanics<br/>     Character creation rules<br/>     Combat rules<br/>     Survival rules<br/>     Argentina background information<br/><br/><br/>"}, "87424": {"rpgdesigner": ["Ricardo Bare", "Sheldon Lee Wen", "Monte Lee Wen"], "rpg": ["Lycadican"], "statistics": [], "name": "Realm Masters Guide", "rpgartist": ["Sheldon Lee Wen"], "rpgproducer": ["(Uncredited)"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic851445.jpg", "usersrated": "1", "rpgitemversion": ["PDF version"], "average": "4", "rpggenre": ["Fantasy"], "rpgpublisher": ["(Self-Published)"], "rpgcategory": ["Core Rules (min needed to play)"], "poll": [], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic851445_t.jpg", "description": "<br/>User summary<br/><br/>The Lycadican Realm Masters Guide contains game master information and advice, and also the combat rules.<br/><br/>It includes:<br/><br/>     Character awards<br/>     World building<br/>     Running a campaign<br/>     Combat rules<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>"}, "87425": {"rpgdesigner": ["Antoine Prevost", "The PaladiN", "Sheldon Lee Wen"], "rpg": ["Lycadican"], "statistics": [], "name": "Codex Lycadican Canonici", "rpgartist": ["Sheldon Lee Wen"], "rpgproducer": ["(Uncredited)"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic851446.jpg", "usersrated": "1", "rpgitemversion": ["PDF version"], "average": "4", "rpggenre": ["Fantasy"], "rpgpublisher": ["(Self-Published)"], "rpgcategory": ["Sourcebook (rules/options to enhance play)"], "poll": [], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic851446_t.jpg", "description": "<br/>User summary<br/><br/>The Codex Lycadican Canonici contains the Lycadican magic rules.<br/><br/>"}, "87426": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic853203.jpg", "poll": [], "boardgamedesigner": ["Marc Varoujan"], "statistics": [], "yearpublished": "2010", "maxplayers": "6", "boardgameartist": ["Mehdi Boucher", "Manuel Lef\u00e8bvre", "J\u00e9r\u00f4me Lereculey", "Robin Sarian", "Serge Vartan"], "boardgamepublisher": ["Ludikif", "Millenium", "Terra Mutandis"], "maxplaytime": "90", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic853203_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "90", "boardgamecategory": ["Fighting", "Medieval", "Negotiation"], "description": "&quot;Roue Breizh / The Lords of Broc&eacute;liande&quot; is strategy game set during the Dark Ages in the Celtic land of Brittany (the north-west corner of France). In the Breton language &quot;Roue Breizh&quot; means &quot;King of Brittany&quot; (Roue is pronounced &quot;Rou&eacute;&quot;, the old pronunciation of the French word Roi or King). The game comes with an educational booklet setting out the history of what was, to the medieval mind, a mystical land associated with the knights of the Round Table and the legendary forest of Broc&eacute;liande.<br/><br/>In this game, players play the feudal lords of Brittany who have survived the fall of Rome (or have fled from their original homeland: Britain) and now face barbarian invasions from the sea and the encroachments of the Frankish kingdom from the east. The Breton lords gradually settle and connect up their different domains, establishing towns and defending themselves against the terrible Vikings and Northmen. The aim of the game is to found ever larger baronies, counties and duchies, whether on one's own, or in combination with the domains of an ally. At the end of the game, one of these lords will be crowned King of Brittany: the &quot;Roue Breizh&quot;!<br/><br/>Mechanisms: Kingdoms are made and unmade, alliances are formed at will. There's no elimination of players. Instead, players are given the chance to form alliances, and may freely give and receive lands as they make or break alliances at the end of each turn. During a turn, members of the same alliance are not allowed to attack each other. Being a member of a strong alliance will allow each player in the alliance to have a better dice-roll in times of conflict. Some players are also members of the Council of Broc&eacute;liande, which gives its members more power, but also - inevitably - the obligation to redistribute resources and to promote the development of other players instead! Gaming enthusiasts will certainly enjoy the fact that &quot;Roue Breizh&quot; gives a decisive advantage to team-play, through the principle of rotating &quot;coalitions&quot;. Between each round of play, the formation and re-formation of teams gives rise to complex interactions between the players as they negotiate the terms of their alliance.<br/><br/>(This is an amended version of the summary published on the Tric Trac website, in French).<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": ["First Edition"], "age": "8", "name": "Roue Breizh", "playingtime": "90", "boardgamemechanic": ["Partnerships"], "average": "4.85714", "usersrated": "7", "boardgamefamily": ["Country: France"]}, "87427": {"rpgdesigner": ["Mike Brunton", "Graeme Morris"], "rpgitemversion": ["First Printing", "PDF \"American\" Edition"], "rpgseries": ["ST - Stoke-on-Trent"], "name": "Up the Garden Path", "rpgartist": ["Mike Brunton", "John Martindale", "Graeme Morris"], "rpgproducer": ["(Uncredited)"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2773820.jpg", "usersrated": "0", "average": "0", "statistics": [], "rpg": ["Basic Dungeons & Dragons"], "rpgpublisher": ["(Web published)", "TSR"], "poll": [], "rpgcategory": ["Scenario / Adventure / Module"], "rpggenre": ["Fantasy (High Fantasy)"], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2773820_t.jpg", "description": "Special Game Adventure for the 1986 National Garden Festival.<br/><br/>For 5-8 Characters, Levels 4-7.<br/><br/>From the back cover:<br/><br/>The day has been long and hard and, as night falls, you gratefully surrender to the soft, silent blackness of well-earned sleep.<br/><br/>Then the dream comes.<br/><br/>You are seated on a throne in a cavern where the sun has never shone: where no voice has ever spoken.
