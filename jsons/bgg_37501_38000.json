This first word must cover the centre square. Play continues, with each player forming words that intersect crossword-style with existing words on their own diagram.

No doubt he had plans of recreating the Glory of his illustrious namesake Uncle. What actually happened was a campaign that saw the Prussians invading France and the Imperial army capitulating at Sedan. Louis Napoleon abdicated and the French carried in the war under the auspices of the Third Republic.<br/><br/>As a wargames period, the FPW remains largely unexplored. There seems to be a general myth that the uniforms are boring, the battles one-sided and that information is just too hard to get to those of whose language skills do not include French and German. As it happens, nothing could be further than the truth than these stereotypes. The French can have a large variety of brightly dressed and colourful units, ranging from the Imperial Guard to the Zouaves and the North African Turcos. You can even field the French Foreign Legion! The Prussians number a significant contingent of allied German troops who all add their own colour and variety to the army, especially the large contingent of Bavarians. Infantry battalions still fought carrying their colours into action and the deployed armies make a brave show on the wargames table. The Prussians may have their superb artillery arm, but the French Infantry were armed with the Chassepot rifle. Tactics were in state of flux as armies were coming to terms with the change from Napoleonic tactics to ones more suited to the greater range and lethality of rifles and artillery. No greater example of this can be seen than the presence of Cavalry units whose purpose was still to charge the enemy with cold steel as their fathers and grandfathers had done.<br/><br/>If you've not considered 1870 before then it is well worth a second look!<br/><br/>Although the war involved unprecedented numbers of soldiers, there was a great deal of variety in the size of the battles. the French army that fought at Wagram was ten times the size of that which fought at Vimiero. It is a lot to ask of any single;e set of rules to cope with such diversity.<br/><br/>Polemos FPW is therefore produced as two sets of rules in one book. The first set, Commandant de Battaile will allow the wargamer to fight battles with armies of up to corps size. The second set, Kommandant der Armee will allow the wargamer to refight the BIG battles of the period.<br/><br/>The same wargames figures may be used in both sets of rules, as the basing system is universal - only the nominal scale will differ.<br/><br/>Polemos FPW aimed at enabling the wargamer to fight large scale actions; actual battles, rather than small scale skirmishes. Systems for firing, melee and morale are straightforward and easy to learn, but allow your troops to emulate the tactics used by their historical counterparts.<br/><br/><u>Basing and Representation</u>:<br/>The basic unit of manoeuvre in Polemos FPW is the Base - a group of wargames figures mounted permanently on a single base of a given size. The actual position and number of the figures on the base is not important, nor is it important that the base sizes given below are adhered to. So long as both armies use the same basing system, the rules should not be affected.<br/><br/><u>In Commandant de Battaile</u>:<br/>A 60mm x 30mm base of infantry represents an infantry battalion - about 500-1000 men. <br/>A 60mm x 30mm base of cavalry represents a regiment or three to four squadrons. <br/>A 30mm x 30mm artillery or mitrailleuse base represents two batteries each of 6 guns.<br/>A 30mm x 30mm Officer base is use for Generals, Corps and Divisional commanders<br/><br/><u>In Kommandant der Armee</u>:<br/>60mm square bases are used. These can be formed by using two CDB bases, butted up one behind the other or a single larger base which allows a more creative and dioramic approach.<br/>A 60mm square base of infantry represents a brigade or division of 1500 to 3000 men.<br/><br/>A 60mm square base of cavalry represents a brigade or division of 750 to 1500 men.<br/><br/>A 30mm x 30mm artillery base represents 18 to 36 guns,<br/><br/>All distances in Polemos games are expressed in Base Widths (BW) and Base Depths (BD) in order to allow the use of differing base sizes. A BD is half a BW.<br/>This system means that any size can be used for bases, so no rebasing is required so long as both sides are consistent. We believe that a 60mm x 30mm base gives the best results in terms of both practical use and visual impact.

It combines strong elements of Poker with trick-taking games, and adds scoring reminiscent of Bridge.<br/><br/>Like bridge, score is kept on a pad split down the centre both across and down; points &quot;above the line&quot; count for the final total, whereas points &quot;below the line&quot; are intermediate. The game is also played until a rubber, or best of three games, is completed.<br/><br/>A hand of Poke is played in two phases; in the first phase, players draw cards to better their Poker hand, and in the second phase the players proceed to take &quot;tricks&quot; with their hand. Points from the first phase go above the line; points from the second go below the line, with some exceptions. Once a player has twenty points below the line (which may take more than one deal), the game is over, bonus points are added, and the points above the line are tallied to determine the winner of that particular game.<br/><br/>Play is as follows:<br/>    * The dealer passes out five cards to himself and his opponent.<br/>    * The opponent may elect to stand pat, or not take any more cards. They may also discard from one to three of the cards in their hand and draw replacements. This doubles their hand; during the trick-taking phase, their opponent will now receive two points per trick won instead of one. After doubling, they may elect to stand pat, or discard from one to three cards again and draw replacements. This is a redouble, and their opponent will now receive four points per trick. They must stand pat at this point.<br/>    * The dealer acts similarly, except for the fact that they get one &quot;free&quot; discard-and-redraw; they may also double and redouble afterwards, for a total of three possible discards-and-redraws.<br/><br/>This ends the first phase. Next comes the trick-taking phase.<br/><br/>* The non-dealer leads by playing one or more cards from their hand. If more than one card is played, they must be of the same rank; in other words, only singles, pairs, three-of-a-kinds, and four-of-a-kinds are allowed as a single play. Their opponent must beat the cards on the table. If it is a singleton, a card of higher rank will suffice; if it is a pair or greater, the opponent must play the same number of cards, and can only beat if their own cards are all the same rank and of higher value. If they do not have a pair or higher, they can simply toss off other cards, which will not beat what is on the table. If the cards played have the same value, the leader wins them.<br/>    * Note that suit is irrelevant at this stage; there are no trumps, and one does not have to follow suit to beat.<br/>    * Players keep their own cards, turning them face-up if they won the trick or face-down if they did not.<br/>    * The winner of the last trick leads for the next one, following the rules above.<br/><br/>After all five cards have been played in tricks, points below the line are determined. Each player gets one point below the line for every trick they take if their opponent did not double or redouble; they get two points for every trick if their opponent doubled but did not redouble, and four points for every trick if their opponent redoubled.<br/><br/>If a player took all five cards in tricks, they have performed a sweep, and receive a bonus of 250 points above the line.<br/><br/>Next, both player's hands are considered as Poker hands. The player with the highest Poker hand received points above the line as follows:<br/><br/>* Pair: 50 points<br/>    * Two Pair: 100 points<br/>    * Three of a Kind: 200 points<br/>    * Straight: 300 points<br/>    * Flush: 400 points<br/>    * Full House: 500 points<br/>    * Four of a Kind: 600 points<br/>    * Straight Flush: 750 points<br/>    * Royal Flush: 1000 points<br/><br/>Deal then passes, and a new hand is dealt. However, if either player reached 20 points below the line, that game is over, unless there is a tie in the number of points below the line, in which case a tiebreaker hand is played. Once a clear winner has been determined, that player gets a bonus of 100 points above the line, and all points below the line are canceled.<br/><br/>When a player has won their second game, they receive the 100 point bonus mentioned above, plus 750 points above the line if their opponent did not win a game in the rubber, or 500 points above the line if their opponent won one. At this stage, the points above the line are tallied, and the person with the most points above the line wins the game.<br/><br/>"}, "37686": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic360074.jpg", "poll": {}, "boardgamedesigner": {"8103": {"name": "Christian Lemay"}}, "statistics": {}, "yearpublished": "2008", "maxplayers": "20", "boardgameartist": {"30392": "Heiko Eller"}, "boardgamepublisher": {"157": {"name": "Asmodee"}}, "maxplaytime": "15", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic360074_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "15", "boardgamecategory": {"1045": {"name": "Memory"}}, "description": "In O&ugrave; &eacute;tiez-vous?

The winner is the player with the most points.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Game Summary<br/>The board is a hex grid, with city spaces along most of the edges. The center hex is a vein of yellow gems: place all 9 in a stack there. The rest of the gems go in their individual market areas (priced 1-9 based on supply).Each round (3 in game), add 5 contracts (showing gem combinations; score big VP if completing them; lose some VP if cannot) to the display. Then auction (using VP) turn order chips 1-4. Players then each get the same set of tiles (hexes with various numbers of track exits, prospecting tiles, veins, option tiles, etc.) plus a dynamite hex based on their turn order chip. Take turns taking contracts until everyone passes.<br/><br/>Then, on your turn, play 1-4 of your 12 actions. These allow you to place tracks (expanding previous tunnels; you can also cover track tiles with tiles having more exits), stations, or veins (which you supply with gems of your choice). Gems (6 types, 9 tokens each) each have their own market where they are stored and which set their max sell price. The last action is prospecting, where you create a path from one of your stations to another, passing through as many veins as possible: take one gem from each vein.<br/><br/>After everyone's 12 actions are used, any exposed dynamite tracks explode and take the adjacent tracks as well (all these are placed in the Buy Pool, which can be accessed by turning in Option tiles)! You score for stations in cities based on the number of empty hexes. Then, for each gem type, players bid (Dutch auction style, bidding for the lowest price they'll accept) and may sell their gems for VP at their bid price.<br/><br/>At game end (after 3 rounds), players sell off all their remaining gems (with lowest VP selling next gem), there's another city scoring, and players lose VP for incomplete orders.

The USN had always been on a heightened alert when traversing the Straits, especially when they knew the Iranians had at least 70 anti-ship missiles within range. Not to mention their capability of launching ASMs from aircraft platforms. Not to mention, their Chinese FACs with ASMs. The threat had always been real. The USN continued to have confidence, perhaps wrongly, that their superiority in higher technology could and would keep their ships out of harm&rsquo;s way.Iran had decided to attack using &ldquo;swarm&rdquo; tactics. The USN had itself used such tactics in their own wargames with devastating results. It was found out that using swarm tactics greatly increased the likelihood of Iranian success, even when only Fast Attack Craft were used. That was then. Now, apply the same tactics with ASMs and the scenario was even more horrific. The USN would not make a preemptive strike, that would be political suicide on the world stage.

Eric Martin<br/><br/>The Palio di Siena (known in Italy as Il Palio) is a crazy horse race that takes place twice a year in Siena on July 2 and August 16.<br/><br/>Ten of the 17 Contrade (or city wards) are represented in the race: the seven that were left out of the previous race and a randomly chosen three from the remaining ten Contrade. Each Contrade has particular colors and coats of arms, and the horse and rider are dressed to embody their Contrade. Riders can use their whips on other horses and riders as well as on their own mount, and the winner is the first horse to cross the finish line with its head ornaments in place &ndash; whether or not the rider is still on the horse.<br/><br/>New Italian game designer Massimo Pesce, together with the help of Scribabs&rsquo; Paolo Vallerga as art director, has produced a nice and simple game about this race. The players control the seventeen Contrade involved in the two races, with ten Contrade taking part in the first race (Palio di Provenzano) and a different set of ten in the second one (Palio dell&rsquo;Assunta). This set-up means that one or more players might hold Contrade involved with only one race.<br/><br/>Each Contrade is assigned a horse (&quot;la tratta&quot;) that can be either a good one (&quot;bono,&quot; with a movement die of 3, 4, 4, 5, 5, 6) or a not-so-good one (&quot;brenna,&quot; with movement of 3, 3, 4, 4, 5, 6). Since the race lasts for three laps, that small difference can add up over time. In addition to the decorative jockey, players receive nine cards that can be used during the race to create small advantages or slow down opponents.<br/><br/>As for the race itself, like the real Palio, the beginning is somewhat chaotic as horses and riders jockey for position. During the movement phase, if a horse can&rsquo;t move its entire distance, it risks falling or perhaps just throwing the rider, which doesn&rsquo;t prevent a horse from winning. The game is all about playing the right cards at the right moment and getting the right rolls.<br/><br/>Palio is simple and quick, the materials are good, and the graphics is great !<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": {"171592": "Second edition"}, "average": "6.23913", "name": "Palio", "playingtime": "30", "boardgamemechanic": {"2035": "Roll / Spin and Move"}, "age": "8", "boardgameexpansion": {}, "usersrated": "23", "boardgamefamily": {"19348": "Cities: Siena / Sienna (Italy)"}}, "37773": {"boardgamedesigner": {"3": {"name": "(Uncredited)"}}, "poll": {}, "name": "Das Spiel des Lebens Kartenspiel", "playingtime": "20", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": {"2040": "Hand Management"}, "yearpublished": "2007", "usersrated": "4", "maxplayers": "4", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic511367_t.jpg", "average": "4.875", "statistics": {}, "boardgamepublisher": {"4653": {"name": "Parker Spiele"}}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic511367.jpg", "boardgameversion": {"224175": "German edition 2007"}, "maxplaytime": "20", "boardgamecategory": {"1002": {"name": "Card Game"}}, "age": "8", "minplaytime": "20", "description": "The highs and lows of an entire life in just 20 minutes: great advancement or even the total bankruptcy.

In an all-out attempt to defeat Russia and end World War Two, the Germans managed to see the spires of the Kremlin as their high water mark for both this battle and for the war. Over two million men fought in this desperate battle that would decide the war and the future of mankind.<br/><br/>Masahiro Yamazaki, the designer of the MMP games Red Star Rising and Stalingrad Pocket has designed his greatest game on this great conflict- Last Stand; The Battle for Moscow 1941-1942. Using all the tricks in his designer&rsquo;s bag, Mas has made this titanic struggle playable but without sacrificing a great sense of history. Offering 3 scenarios to show different aspects of the campaign, and a unique way of showing the plight of the Soviet morale as a nation faces possible complete military defeat, all in a manageable size, Last Stand is a game that has no competitor.<br/><br/>As seen in Mas&rsquo; other games, Last Stand features an interesting sequence of play:<br/><br/><br/>    A.) German Player Turn<br/>        ) Supply Phase<br/>            a.) Weather<br/>            b.) Reinforcement/Supply Placement<br/>            c.) Receive Air Points<br/>            d.)

As the game begins, neither player knows what they must accomplish to win the game. As the game progresses and the Germans advance towards Moscow, the Germans will find out what it takes to win. Soviet Morale will continue to fall until the Soviets can strike back - and when they do, the damage is healed twofold - but defeat can happen at any moment.<br/><br/>Last Stand features three scenarios of different lengths to give players options depending on how much time they have to play.<br/><br/>Scenario One - the Soviet Counterblow<br/>This scenario covers only the great Soviet Counterattack that pushed the Germans to the brink of defeat in the late Winter 1942. Playing time is about 3-4 hours.<br/><br/>Scenario Two - The Germans Attack<br/>This scenario covers the German attack to defeat the Soviets before winter comes. Playing time is about 5-6 hours.<br/><br/>Scenario Three - the Campaign Game<br/>This scenario covers the entire offensive and the Soviet counterattack.

This is a re-release of Formula D\u00e9 with several changes from the original format. Whilst old tracks can be used with the updated Formula D rules, the new game features boards that have an F1 track and a Street Track on the other side. These street tracks each have a novel inclusion or two to add greater theme -<br/><br/>The game mechanisms are a simple race, get to the finish line first!  However, players have to use a significant amount of planning, and rely on quite a bit of luck.  Each player manages when to shift gears, with each gear providing a different speed.  (For example, 4th gear is a die that rolls random numbers from 7 to 12 for spaces moved.)  Each turn, players may move up one gear, stay in that gear, or move down gears.  This forces players to match possible rolls with the optimum distance for that turn, and hopefully plan ahead.  However, speed is not the only issue!  Corners have a &quot;stop&quot; rule that requires players to stop once, twice, or three times on that corner in consecutive turns or face a penalty.  This creates an effective speed limit to the corners. <br/> Of course, things do not always go as planned!  Players take penalties if they miss their roll, bump into another car, are blocked by other cars, have to brake heavily, or have to downshift several gears.  These are taken off of a car&rsquo;s attributes (Tire health, Brake wear, Transmission Gears, Body, engine, and Suspension).  Losing the maximum in any of these categories will result in elimination, or a severe setback for that car.  This requires that players manage their car&rsquo;s health, plan for their best path, and have good luck on their rolls.  This high amount of luck gives the game its family appeal, and lets weaker players have a chance at winning once in a while.<br/><br/>However, the fun does not end with a single race!  The rules include the ability to customize your cars, use a pre-generated character, add Slipstreaming (Drafting) rules and road debris, and change tire types to modify your distance rolls.  There are also variations for a single lap race, or multiple laps with pit stops to repair some of your damage points.  In addition, numerous expansion tracks can be purchased to vary the demands on each driver and car.  Each track may also have weather effects (rain) that change car handling and die rolls due to skidding on wet track.  This opens up the game for rally rules giving championship points over a number of races.<br/><br/>Formula D adds a few items that are not in the original Formula De:  There is the added excitement of illegal racing in the streets of big cities - anything goes!  This adds custom cars, nitro acceleration, drifting in the curves, dirty tricks, gun battles, and trash on the road to add more variation.  A basic change is the use of a &quot;Dashboard&quot; with movable pegs to manage your car&rsquo;s attributes instead of the paper forms from Formula De.  There are also two sets of pre-painted cars; a Formula 1 set and the Street Race set of stock cars.  The street cars come with &quot;Character&quot; profiles to give a bit of role-playing to the game.

To do that, they invest their money in mines, mining rights and the latest technologies. The player who has the most valuable park at the end of the game is the Lord of Diamonds!<br/><br/>The goal of the game is to build a magnificent park with many (different) attractions. The game ends, when the first player completes his or her park. Then victory points are scored based on the contents of the parks, technology advancements and achievements gained during the game. The player with the most victory points wins the game.<br/><br/>Diamonds Club is played in turns until the end condition is met by the first player. Each turn is divided into different phases. In the first phase players take turns placing coins on a central board to gain several benefits: mines, ships and prospector rights to gain gemstones, technology advancements or wildlife park attractions for the own park.<br/>To gain the benefit of a square you have to place one coin plus the sum of all vertical and horizontal placed coins. So as the players take turns, the available benefits grow more and more expensive.<br/>Once every player has passed, the players may change a combination of ship, prospector rights and mine into as many gemstones as the lowest value on all of the counters depicts.<br/>In the final phase the players can buy new attractions for their park using the earned gemstones.<br/><br/>As mentioned above, there are several achievements, for example to be the first player having 5 equal attractions, or a special combination of attractions. Those score later extra points for the player who won this. Also, there are several technologies, which could raise the value of woods in the park, increase the gemstone income of the player or increases the number of coins available each round for the player.

The structure of the game turns is simple, with each player turn divided into a Command Communications Phase and a Maneuver Phase. All the activities of each formation are completed before those of another are begun. Attacks proceed with a preliminary barrage, fire attack by maneuver companies, and then close action with tanks or assault troops. All activities involve comparisons of involved units' capabilities.

Players play a gang of hardened fighters, pitting themselves against others in the wastelands of the future.<br/><br/>The Tome of Tridlins is a supplement for the game Nuclear Renaissance that really completes the game. The core game rules can be downloaded for free from the Ramshackle website or a printed version can be had from the web store. The Tome of Tridlins adds much more detailed gang design rules, along with a full campaign system and more background.<br/><br/>The main aspects of playing Nuclear Renaissance that sets it apart from other games are that it is great for multiple players and that the gang creation rules are really versatile.<br/><br/>The multi player aspect of the game makes it great for gaming groups. Three player games are easily handled, while even five or six players can get through a game in three hours or so. The rules are really designed so that any sized gaming group can have fun together without feeling that the person to go last is at a disadvantage, or that one player has to get left out. The game is biased towards playing campaigns, where players develop their gangs. The new book, the Tome of Tridlins, gives full rules for playing campaigns. This means that players can always get a game in a campaign even if only three people show up for a gaming night! What this comes down to is that gaming groups can easily fit the game around the players that show up and the boards that are available, rather than the other way around.<br/><br/>The gang creation rules were made with the idea of letting players play any type of gang that fits their fancy. Players can choose to play biker gangs, zombie hordes, all animal beast packs (monsters included), bands of mutants, robot death squads and even military conclaves. Players can even mix them all up, to have robot driven battle trucks packed full of mutants, zombies and wild animals with a mighty hero in charge! Vehicles are fully integrated into the game play and there are comprehensive but simple rules for designing ones that suit your gang. Within the gang design rules, players are set very few limitations. There are hundreds of options for making really unique forces. This complexity is condensed down onto simple gang rosters that can easily hold all the information you need to play with, without having masses of notes, counters, cards and other paraphernalia.<br/><br/>The problem with having very open gang design is keeping the game balanced. After six years of testing, the final result balances player gangs in a number of ways. The first is a points system, where each player is given a set amount to spend building their gangs. In campaigns the players are awarded more points as they play more games but the campaign system keeps players who miss gaming nights in the loop. Its easy to catch up, even if you lose! The second way to balance the game is that more power leads to less versatility. Power hungry &quot;one man armies&quot; don't get many tactical options and are often left waiting while the other players take their turns with larger gangs. The game works with players alternately activating characters, so gangs with the average ten or so members keep playing throughout a turn.<br/><br/>The game is aimed at players who want a new gaming system, nothing too complex to learn but with a lot of options. The game features solid mechanics and balance, which means that its robust enough to play well, but loose enough to let players use their imaginations. Power gamers can indulge their lust for super armoured laser cannon wielding death knights mounted on super bikes but will find that the other players in their gaming group will have the flexibility to constantly undermine their power gaming tactics. On the other hand, players who want to concentrate more on the theme of their gang will find that its easy to build forces that are powerful but have plenty of room for idiosyncrasies and whimsey!<br/><br/>Ramshackle Games already produces hundred of miniatures to play Nuclear Renaissance with. Players will find that most of the options in the books are covered in one form or another, so its easy to get a really thematic gang together right from the get-go.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": {"327412": "First edition"}, "name": "Nuclear Renaissance", "playingtime": "60", "boardgamemechanic": {"2072": "Dice Rolling"}, "age": "0", "boardgameexpansion": {}, "usersrated": "3", "boardgamesubdomain": {"4664": "Wargames"}, "average": "6.83333"}, "37933": {"boardgamedesigner": {"3": {"name": "(Uncredited)"}}, "poll": {}, "name": "Cranium Humdinger", "playingtime": "5", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": {"2023": "Co-operative Play"}, "yearpublished": "2007", "usersrated": "10", "maxplayers": "0", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic552359_t.jpg", "average": "4.5", "statistics": {}, "boardgamepublisher": {"224": {"name": "Cranium, Inc."}}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic552359.jpg", "boardgameversion": {"253221": "First edition"}, "maxplaytime": "5", "boardgamecategory": {"1054": {"name": "Music"}}, "age": "0", "minplaytime": "5", "description": "A fast paced cooperative play game where you have to name the tune.

These expansions are:<br/><br/>Luxury Containers &mdash; In addition to the other containers, players add 12, 16, or 20 gold luxury containers to the supply. As a pre-turn action, a player can convert two containers in his factory or harbor to a gold container, pricing it as he wishes. Luxury containers are worth twice the number of luxury containers that a player collects, so one luxury container is worth 2, two containers are worth 8 (4 each), three are worth 18 (6 each), and so on.<br/><br/>Factory and Warehouse Restrictions &mdash; These two expansions work similarly, consisting of sets of cards that are stacked in a particular order. As you build more factories (or warehouses), a new restriction card takes effect, limiting the prices at which you can offer containers. In effect, these cards mimic economies of scale, allowing players to drop prices as they invest more in infrastructure.<br/><br/>Financiers &mdash; Players can now loan money directly to others, allowing them to earn the interest previously paid to the bank. A player who is looking for financing doesn't have to accept a loan offered by another player, but if she doesn't, then she must pass on borrowing money at all that turn. Competing Financiers may sweeten the deal by offering bigger loans for the same interest payment. Someone who defaults on a loan from another player will typically lose a container, factory, or warehouse to the lender to repay the debt.<br/><br/>Monopoly &mdash; A single player can now have more than one factory of the same color, potentially monopolizing production of a container type.<br/><br/>Designer Kevin Nesbitt says, &quot;A lot of the concepts that I'm introducing were discussed with Thomas and Benno back when the base game was in the development stage (I did most of the development on the base game, as well).

Toss the battle dice top smash the sinister Skugs. Your powers increase as you defeat them. Then fight the fiendish robot mutant General Ivar! But watch out! He'll stop at nothing to destroy you!<br/><br/>Only the bravest VR Troupers can defeat Grimlord's evil army and win the game. Will it be you?&quot;<br/><br/>Unlike most other games, the three VR warriors in the game are shared by the players.  Each turn, the active player throws a die to decide which (red, yellow or green) trooper he controls this time, and then battle a Skug on their way to the penultimate battle, General Ivar.<br/><br/>Battles are done by tossing dice into a battle arena.  Someone plays the Skug and tosses one die, hoping for a hit (50% chance), and then the active player tosses a die to get a hit as well.  Play continues with 2 more dice on each side , one at a time. The dexterity comes in that you can try to hit your opponent's 'hit' die or your own 'miss' die to switch the result.  Ties go to the active player.<br/><br/>There is some skill in tossing the dice to change results, but because you cannot control which VR warrior you will assumer on your turn, the game comes down mainly to luck.  Winning battlers earns you a power chip (with a VR glasses wearing dog on it), which will allow you a reroll in the final battle (which is a toss of 4 dice at once, so dexterity plays no role here), while losing a battle loses you the same number of accumulated power chips.<br/><br/>There's no doubt this is a kid's game for fans of the TV show.

A roll of one or two results in an easy question, three or four a medium question, and five or six a hard question.

These tribe-stones have two sides: one side with a tribe-symbol, and one without. All stones start the game with the tribe-symbol face-up, but every time that a stone is jumped over, it flips over, either hiding the tribe-symbol, or revealing it again. A stone that jumps over another stone always ends its move with the tribe-symbol revealed.<br/><br/>To win the game, a player must get at least 7 own stones into a single grouping. This can be anywhere on the board, with the catch that only stones that show the own tribe-symbol count, and all of them must touch.<br/><br/>Movement rules are simple. A stone either moves to a free hexagon immediately next to the field it occupies, ending its movement with the same side face-up. Or it hops over a neighbouring stone, regardless of who it belongs to, flipping every stone it jumps over, and ending its movement with its own tribe-symbol face-up. Like Halma, hopping is only possible if the field directly behind the jumped stone is unoccupied, and you are allowed to keep hopping over other stones if the board allows it, as long as you never pass the same hexagon twice. You are not forced to jump over a piece if you don't want to, and you can stop jumping at any point that suits you.<br/><br/>The board is made out of felt, the tribe-stones come in 2 colours and are made out of wood.<br/><br/>ADDITIONAL INFO:<br/><br/>     language skill needed: language neutral.
