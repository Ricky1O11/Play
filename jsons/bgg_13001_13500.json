Pompeii, sitting at the foot of Vesuvius, is at the high point in its development. People come to the city from far and wide to try to make their luck in the city. So far nobody has dreamed of the danger that will bury all of their dreams under mountains of ash just ten years later. Who will survive the eruption of Vesuvius unscathed?<br/><br/>The simple rules make it easy to get started with The Downfall of Pompeii, a game in which a lot of tactical know-how is required &ndash; along with a little luck &ndash; in order to bring your pieces out of the city at the right time.<br/><br/>The game falls into two halves: before and after the eruption of Vesuvius. Before the eruption, players play cards to place their pieces in buildings. After the first eruption, they can also place as many relatives as the number of pieces already in the building they placed their piece in. When Omen cards are drawn, the player can take any opponent's piece and throw it into the erupting volcano. In this manner, players try to get as many pieces onto the board as close to the exits from the city as possible.<br/><br/>After the second eruption, the game changes. Now each player places a lava tile, which kills any pieces on that square and may block exits from the city. Then they move two pieces toward the exits, moving them a number of squares equal to the pieces on the square from which they started. The player who gets the most pieces out of the city wins.<br/><br/>&bull;&bull;&bull;<br/><br/>The 2013 second edition of The Downfall of Pompeii includes three dual vent tiles and a new &quot;Dual Vent&quot; variant.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": {"24525": "English first edition"}, "average": "7.13572", "name": "The Downfall of Pompeii", "playingtime": "45", "boardgamemechanic": {"2676": "Grid Movement"}, "age": "10", "boardgameexpansion": {}, "usersrated": "6091", "boardgamesubdomain": {"5499": "Family Games"}, "boardgamefamily": {"5606": "Ancient Rome"}}, "13005": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic52250.jpg", "poll": {}, "boardgamedesigner": {"7": {"name": "Wolfgang Kramer"}}, "statistics": {}, "yearpublished": "2004", "maxplayers": "8", "boardgameartist": {"11901": "Oliver Freudenreich"}, "boardgamepublisher": {"8": {"name": "AMIGO Spiel + Freizeit GmbH"}}, "maxplaytime": "30", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic52250_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "30", "boardgamecategory": {"1089": {"name": "Animals"}}, "boardgamehonor": {"21036": "2005 Spiel der Spiele Hit f\u00fcr Familien Recommended"}, "description": "From the publisher, AMIGO Spiel + Freizeit GmbH:<br/><br/>This is a boardgame version of the card game 6 nimmt! (more precisely, the version sold as 6 Nimmt!).<br/><br/>To kick off the celebrations for the 10 year anniversary of the release of his 6 Nimmt! game, Wolfgang Kramer presents Tanz der Hornochsen, a crazy board game. It uses the base concept of the card game, but expands it and enriches it in many ways. So Tanz der Hornochsen is a completely separate gaming experience, one that pleases through both the clever game system as well as the wonderful illustrations by Oliver Freudenreich.<br/><br/>Two to eight players try to place their cows (cardboard markers with number values) onto the meadow spaces such that they don't land on a bullhead space. The winner, at the end of the game, is the player who is the furthest away from becoming a bullhead. Tanz der Hornochsen lets even players who have no prior experience with the card game quickly get started with the bovine silliness. The bullheads await the dance!<br/><br/>Play Summary<br/>Each round players will select a tile to play and place it face down in front of them. When everyone is ready, the tiles are revealed.<br/><br/>Tiles are placed on the board in order, lowest to highest. Which row a tile is placed in is determined according to the following rules:<br/>1. Increasing number value. The number on the tile to be placed must be higher than the number on the tile that is currently the last tile in that row.<br/>2. Smallest difference. The tile must always be placed at the end of the row where there will be the smallest difference between it and the tile currently at that row. All four active rows must be examined to determine which has the smallest difference.<br/>3. Lowest number. If the played tile's number is lower than that of the end tile on all four rows, it must be placed at the end of the row with the highest number.<br/><br/>When a player places a tile on a cowpie, he scores that many points and moves his pawn that many spaces around the scoring track. If the Happy Cows are active, he gets to move his pawn back (away from the Dung Heap) that many spaces instead of forward (towards the Dung Heap).<br/><br/>When a player places a tile on the Bullhead at the end of a row, that row is completed and the player must execute the following actions in order:<br/>1. Score penalty points as shown on the Bullhead space by moving his pawn around the score track.<br/>2. Move the just-played tile to the first space on the next unoccupied row.<br/>3. Remove the remaining tiles from the completed row. Choose one or two to keep  (behind his player screen). Place the remaining tiles back in the box or off to the side. They will not be used for the remainder of the game.<br/><br/>Enhancements over 6 Nimmt!<br/>Tanz der Hornochsen includes many enhancements over the card game versions of 6 Nimmt!, including: Double Play spaces requiring players to play 2 tiles in a round, Happy Cow spaces that reverse scores while active, the two Bull's Eye spots on the scoring track that give the player closest to the Dung Heap an advantage for a round, and the ability of players to  purchase new tiles each round prior to choosing a tile to play. All these enhancements increase the play dynamic considerably.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": {"24000": "Amigo edition"}, "average": "6.5401", "name": "Tanz der Hornochsen!", "playingtime": "30", "boardgamemechanic": {"2020": "Simultaneous Action Selection"}, "age": "8", "usersrated": "641", "boardgamesubdomain": {"5499": "Family Games"}, "boardgamefamily": {"5012": "6 nimmt!"}}, "13006": {"boardgamedesigner": {"63": {"name": "Tim Taylor"}}, "poll": {}, "name": "Swords & Dragons", "playingtime": "10", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": {"2014": "Betting/Wagering"}, "yearpublished": "2000", "usersrated": "7", "maxplayers": "10", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic53115_t.jpg", "average": "6.14286", "statistics": {}, "boardgamepublisher": {"2925": {"name": "Emperors Choice Games"}}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic53115.jpg", "boardgameversion": {"278840": "First edition"}, "maxplaytime": "10", "boardgamecategory": {"1023": {"name": "Bluffing"}}, "age": "8", "minplaytime": "10", "description": "This game is based on the Arduin Role-Playing system by Dave Hargrave. It's described as a game like Poker with unusual twists.<br/><br/>There are the same numerical cards, 2-10, Jack (Knight), Queen, King and Ace. And like in some Poker varients the Ace may be played as high or low. Whereas a standard Poker deck has four suites, Swords &amp; Dragons has eight. And there is a similarity in which one hand will defeat another.<br/><br/>The game play appears to be a mix of Hold 'Em, Stud Poker and Go Fish. Cards can be asked for and received by another player if one hasn't hidden them in their Trove. The Trove allows a player to hold up to four cards without worry of them being asked for in Go Fish style. Essentially players can use the cards in their hand and the one &quot;Up&quot; card, that being the last card discarded, as their current hand. The &quot;Up&quot; card may also be taken by a player on their turn and the discard becomes the new &quot;Up&quot; card.<br/><br/>A round ends when all but one player folds - due to not calling a raise, or the deck runs out of cards.. or, all players call the raise. Then a showdown occurs and it's winner take all.<br/><br/>The components are a bit flimsy.

When a player encloses all six sides of a Tangle Tile with his particular color playing pieces, he has captured that tile and scores points.<br/>2. Tangle playing pieces-values:<br/><br/>    Only the final piece that completes the surrounding of the Tangle Tile counts toward point value and only if all six sides of the Tangle Tile are surrounded by the same color.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>3. Each playing piece has its own point value.<br/>Note: There are six shapes from small to large point values are: 1, 2, 3, 4, 4, and 5 points.<br/>4. Tangle Tile values:<br/>The Tangle Tiles on the board also have point values, which are added to the value of the final playing piece that completes the surrounding of a Tangle Tile. These values are as follows:<br/><br/>    Plain Tile &ndash; 1 point.<br/>    Circular Design Tile &ndash; 2 points<br/>    Triangular Design Tile &ndash; 2 points plus double the value of the completing Tangle playing piece.<br/>    Square Design Tile &ndash; 4 points plus double the value of the completing Tangle playing piece.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>The Play:<br/>1. Each player&rsquo;s first turn must start with one side of his playing piece touching one of the six sides of the Center Star Tangle Tile.<br/>2. Players alternate turns.<br/>3. All pieces in play must be continuously connected (regardless of color) even when blocking.<br/>4. If a player places a playing piece on the board which does not complete a Tangle Tile his turn ends.<br/>5. A player is entitled to an immediate extra turn for every Tangle Tile he completely surrounds in his own color.<br/>6. Total points are kept on the scoring rim as each Tangle Tile is surrounded.<br/><br/>Conclusion Of Game:<br/>Play is ended when one player has used all his playing pieces or when one player has reached the total of 50 points.<br/><br/>Winner:<br/>The player with the highest total of points when the game ends.<br/><br/>Play For Partners:<br/>Partners sit facing each other.

The first game in this new series is Alexander the Great, a game that covers the career of the fabled King of Macedon, from his ascension to the throne until his army has &quot;Hellenized&quot; half the known world.<br/><br/>Alexander uses an interesting new system that gives the players a feel for the era and the problems of campaigning therein. For one, there are no turns. Play keeps going until the Macedonian Player wins or Alexander dies. And winning, for the Macedonian Player, is no mean feat. Yes, his armies are mighty, but Alexander is a game in which the player must not just win battles, but also overcome the logistics of campaigning &hellip; building armies, getting them to where they're needed, understanding battle fatigue and weariness, dealing with personalities, and adapting to the society you are trying to seize.<br/><br/>The player's goals, as Alexander, are multiple and difficult. To win, he must maintain his hegemony of Greece, become Great King and establish his Deity. The latter two require him to achieve eight separate, often difficult objectives, including controlling key provinces, building Alexandria, gaining control of the Royal Family, and invoking proskynesis (homage by prostration). A clever Persian player has many ways to stop the Macedonian from earning these, and the money and manpower to help him. Given Alexander's &quot;greatness,&quot; play testers found the game to be remarkably balanced.<br/><br/>Alexander uses cards, but it is not a game &quot;driven&quot; by cards - this is not a Paths of Glory system game. Rather, it uses them to provide the players with the historical opportunities and outside events that shaped Alexander's campaigns. The cards cover such events as Alexander's drinking problems, the shadowy figure of Bagoas, the friendly presence of Black Cleitus, and possibilities of assassination, mass marriages, Spartan revolts &hellip; even a Honeymoon for the weary Macedonians!<br/><br/>Combat uses a fun, two-tiered battle resolution system that accounts for many more factors than just numbers, and often leaves armies- even winning armies- in far worse shape than you may want.<br/><br/>The Conquerors: Alexander the Great is a game rich in historical detail, a game that places major burdens on the players to achieve victory, and a game that's great fun!

The rules stress that is based on the first major land battle of the Hundred Years' War, the 1345 Battle of Cr&eacute;cy, but only if you ignore factors as terrain, the tactics of the time, the fact that the French had twice as many troops, the decisive deployment of the longbow by the Welsh and English archers, and that there was only one Black Prince (on the English side). And that it actually took place in 1346, on August 26.<br/><br/>So, stripped of any historical constraints, both Field Commanders now oversee 2 identical armies, consisting of 4 different soldier classes, each with different movement options, but also, like chess, of equal capturing strength. Besides armies on the board, both players always have 3 special cards which are the main engine behind the thrust of the game.<br/><br/>Whether an attack is successful or not doesn't depend on the attacking piece, but if the attack card, that gets played with each attack, can be stopped by a suitable counter card held by the defender. Since players always have a hand-size of three cards, the battles are not decided by clever maneuvering and the interaction of different pawn abilities, but simply by the luck of the draw. Nothing will save you if you have the wrong cards.<br/><br/>Combining a chess-like game with card play was a nice idea, but unfortunately the way it was implemented simply reduced the board game element to a mere sideshow, and put luck firmly at the center of each victory.<br/><br/>Publication history: one of Johann R&uuml;ttinger's earliest games, and when it appeared by Noris Spiele in 1983 it even became his second nomination for Spiel des Jahres in two years, after &quot;Vokabo&quot; made the shortlist in 1982.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": {"133445": "First edition"}, "name": "Der Schwarze Prinz", "playingtime": "40", "boardgamemechanic": {"2040": "Hand Management"}, "average": "3.8", "usersrated": "5", "boardgamesubdomain": {"4666": "Abstract Games"}, "age": "8"}, "13237": {"boardgamedesigner": {"4128": {"name": "Teeuwynn Woodruff"}}, "poll": {}, "name": "Star Sisterz", "playingtime": "0", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": {"2014": "Betting/Wagering"}, "yearpublished": "2004", "usersrated": "3", "maxplayers": "3", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic186591_t.jpg", "average": "5", "statistics": {}, "boardgamepublisher": {"13": {"name": "Wizards of the Coast"}}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic186591.jpg", "boardgameversion": {"195999": "First edition"}, "maxplaytime": "0", "boardgamecategory": {"1044": {"name": "Collectible Components"}}, "age": "0", "minplaytime": "0", "description": "Star Sisterz is a Collectible charm game, you and your friends do fun dares, silly challenges, and activities to earn unique collectible charms.<br/><br/>Do A Dare Earn A Charm<br/><br/>"}, "13238": {"boardgamedesigner": {"4129": {"name": "Giovanni Ingellis"}}, "poll": {}, "name": "AAARGH!!", "playingtime": "30", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": {"2026": "Hex-and-Counter"}, "yearpublished": "1982", "usersrated": "3", "maxplayers": "7", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic53697_t.jpg", "average": "6.33333", "statistics": {}, "boardgamepublisher": {"2981": {"name": "Scienza & Vita"}}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic53697.jpg", "maxplaytime": "30", "boardgamecategory": {"1046": {"name": "Fighting"}}, "age": "10", "minplaytime": "30", "description": "Aliens vs. humans in a classical inside-ship fight.

Fourteen of them were shot down as they pressed their attack, yet not a single pilot veered away. While Japanese fighters slaughtered the low-flying torpedo planes, American dive bombers passed overhead and began their screaming dives onto the Japanese carriers, sinking three of them and dooming the Japanese Empire. The sacrifice had not been in vain.<br/><br/>Both Japan and the United States had sought a final, decisive battle for control of the Pacific Ocean. When the Japanese unleashed their MI Sakusen plan to capture Midway Island in June 1942, the U.S. Navy was more than happy to meet them.<br/><br/>Midway covers the turning point of the Pacific War, with 11 separate scenarios, or game situations. These include the Battle of Midway in June 1942, the Wake Island relief operation of December 1941, the retaliatory raid on Wake Island in February-March 1942 and Pearl Harbor. There are options to allow the Japanese to bring in the forces historically allotted to the Aleutian Islands campaign instead of Midway, and the American battleship force that was not risked there but was available.<br/><br/>There are 210 &quot;long&quot; playing pieces, depicting the major fleet units of both sides: battleships, aircraft carriers, cruisers and fleet destroyers. There are also 280 square playing pieces, half the size of the ship pieces, mostly depicting aircraft but also smaller warships and markers.<br/><br/>The United States has her entire early-war Pacific Fleet, from the dreadnoughts of Battleship Row to the aircraft carriers that saved the world from fascist-imperialist domination. Aircraft like the F4F Wildcat and B17 Flying Fortress are present, as well as the Devastator.<br/><br/>The Japanese have their own battle line, headed by the incredible super-battleship Yamato. There's also the First Carrier Fleet of six modern first-line flattops, sporting the awesome Zero fighter and the famous Val and Kate bombers.<br/><br/>The operational map depicts the seas around Hawai'i and Midway Island.The tactical map is a generic blue field of hexagons, used to resolve surface combat. There, ships maneuver and fight using their gunnery and torpedo factors. Each player rolls a number of dice according to the ship's capabilities, hitting on a result of 6. Gunnery and torpedo damage tables give the results: ships can suffer damage to engines, hull or armament.<br/><br/>Air attacks are resolved in similar fashion. The combat systems yield results rapidly but in a historically accurate fashion, giving a good balance of fun and insight.<br/><br/>The third game in the Second World War at Sea series of naval campaign games by Avalanche Press.<br/>Midway covers the Battle of Midway, the Raid on Pearl Harbor, the Invasion and potential relief of Wake Island and other early war situations in the central Pacific. The map includes Wake, Midway and the Hawaiian islands. The game includes 1/2-inch counters for aircraft, 1-inch counters for ships, a strategic map, a tactical map, rules and charts.<br/><br/>Original production in 2002, re-printed in 2007 and again in 2014.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": {"24358": "First Edition"}, "average": "7.1101", "name": "Second World War at Sea: Midway", "playingtime": "240", "boardgamemechanic": {"2072": "Dice Rolling"}, "age": "12", "boardgameexpansion": {}, "usersrated": "104", "boardgameaccessory": {"146080": "Second World War at Sea: Transports"}, "boardgamesubdomain": {"4664": "Wargames"}, "boardgamefamily": {"45": "Second World War at Sea"}}, "13255": {"boardgamedesigner": {"4139": {"name": "George Vernon"}}, "poll": {}, "name": "Crop Circles", "playingtime": "0", "minplayers": "2", "yearpublished": "0", "usersrated": "1", "boardgamefamily": {"5607": "3D Games"}, "maxplayers": "6", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1581847_t.jpg", "average": "1", "statistics": {}, "boardgamepublisher": {"2987": {"name": "Mystic Merlin"}}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1581847.jpg", "maxplaytime": "0", "boardgamecategory": {"1050": {"name": "Ancient"}}, "age": "0", "minplaytime": "0", "description": "This may be the strangest game you have ever seen!

If you own the original 1995 edition of Three Days of Gettysburg, or if you have the upgrade kit, you can continue playing those versions with no problems; those versions still stand the test of time quite well. In this Special 2004 Edition of Three Days of Gettysburg, we've done our best to improve and enhance the components and rules to this already classic game.<br/><br/>Specifically:<br/><br/><br/>    The six countersheets contain all of the original and replacement counters from the first two versions of the game, as well as some new counters and units with modified unit strengths and morale levels based on recent research. Rodger MacGowan and Mark Simonitch have revised and upgraded the original counter graphics, and these counters are printed on the higher-quality stock you've come to expect from us in recent years.<br/><br/><br/><br/>    Mark Simonitch has completely reworked the three game maps. He's used the original work and maps from Rick Barber and Joe Youst's first two versions as a base, and come up with another of his clean and elegant looks that makes these maps both nice to look at and easy to play on.<br/><br/><br/><br/>    The GBACW 4.4 rules that appeared in Gringo! were a major step up for the series in terms of both rules streamlining and presentation. We have further edited those rules and released version 4.5 for this new edition of Three Days of Gettysburg.<br/><br/><br/><br/>    Mark has streamlined and done new layouts on the game charts to give players the best mix yet of readability and utility in the least possible table space. We've also included some neat charts created by Mike Lemick that allow you to easily keep track of the status of each side's command and routed unit status..<br/><br/><br/><br/>    As you'll note from the graphic above, Rodger has created a whole new game box for this new edition of the game. We think it's some of his best work ever, and hope you agree. The game box is the crowning piece of what is, for a Reprint Edition, about as close to a brand new game, component-wise, as we could get (which is why there is no Update Kit for this version - it would essentially be a whole new game). <br/><br/><br/>So, if your original copy is showing some wear and tear, or if you want an edition of this classic game in which the updated graphics and systems outshine the original (and that is saying a lot), or you simply missed purchasing the first edition of this best-selling game, then this Special 2004 Edition is for you! Enjoy!<br/><br/>Game Features<br/><br/>     A revised Command System, using Maximum Effectiveness to portray the strengths and vicissitudes of battlefield command.<br/>     Seven scenarios, from microcosm 1-mappers to the full 3-day battle.<br/>     Brigadiers rated with Action Profiles so that, when on their own, you may never know exactly what they'll do! Will an aggressive Dick Garnett recklessly charge everyone in sight, seeking to regain lost honor? Will a cautious Stannard sit and watch? Or will an unreliable Iverson hit the bottle instead of the front line?<br/>     Artillery Barrage, simplified Ammo rules, special rules for green units, and an optional Fatigue Rule that really places an emphasis on careful unit usage.<br/>     A remarkably simple Shock Table that features Continuous Attack: you can roll up the enemy's flank in one massive charge. <br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Components:<br/><br/>    six full-color countersheets.<br/>    Three 22x34&quot; full-color mapsheets<br/>    One 11&quot; X 17&quot; Player Aid Card<br/>    System Rulesbook<br/>    Scenario Booklet<br/>    4 Setup cards<br/>    One 10-sided die<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Designer: Richard H.

The game spawned the &quot;Great Battles of the American Civil War&quot; series and is a direct descendant of the old SPI favorite, Terrible Swift Sword.<br/><br/>Components include three newly revised and beautiful maps by Mark Simonitch and Joe Youst (building on older work by Rick Barber and Joe Youst), 1680 counters including units and markers, some new charts, and ver. 4.5 of the GBACW rules.<br/><br/>This edition attempts to bring a simplification to the complicated LOS procedures of the previous editions.  The counters have also been cleaned up and overall this edition has quite a bit of visual appeal.  This game is very complex but is a great simulation of ACW tactics.  However, the game also works with a slimmed down version of the GBACW system rules called &quot;Simple Great Battles of the ACW,&quot; the release of which coincided with the publishing of the game.

For Kemal's T&uuml;rks, their own &quot;great idea&quot; was the forging of a new, compact T&uuml;rkish Republic united not by the outdated creed of Islam but by a new T&uuml;rkish nationalism, modernized and empowered by Western culture and commerce.<br/><br/>These two visions of national rebirth fought bitterly over the plains, deserts, and mountains of Anatolia for three long years. Western Anatolia was ethnically mixed, and neither side had an exclusive claim. The great prize was Smyrna, taken by Greece in 1919: a city which was home to more Greeks than Athens itself. The war had profound implications for the entire region. Greek victory would cement Greece as a regional power, and act as a beacon of hope to Orthodox Russians seeking to topple Lenin's Communists in the ongoing Russian Civil War. T&uuml;rkish defeat would mean the collapse of Kemal's vision of a secular, democratic T&uuml;rkey and would block the spread of Western values in the Near East, leaving T&uuml;rkey battered and backward, and the rest of the Moslem world feeling victimized and enraged.<br/><br/>As it happened, T&uuml;rkey won and Greece lost. Kemal's vision prevailed; T&uuml;rkey emerged victorious, united and profoundly westernized. Women gave up the veil and went to school. The Roman alphabet replaced the Arabic, and Islam was evicted from politics. For the Greeks, the end came in September of 1922 when the T&uuml;rks captured Smyrna and burned the city to the ground. A million and a half Greeks fled or were expelled, and nearly 2,900 years of Hellenic civilization in Asia came to an abrupt and humiliating end. Greece, overwhelmed by refugees, collapsed into a series of coups and revolutions punctuated by all sorts of autocracy and spectacular misrule, from which, arguably, it has only recently recovered.<br/><br/>Whose &quot;great idea&quot; will shape the modern Near East? Now you can make the decision by playing Byzantium Reborn!<br/><br/>Byzantium Reborn is a simulation game on the Greek-T&uuml;rkish War of 1920-22. The game is for two players, one representing the Kingdom of Greece and its allies (the Greek player), and the other the insurgent nationalist forces of Mustapha Kemal who opposed the Greek invasion (the T&uuml;rkish player). The 11 x 17&quot; map of Anatolia (Asia Minor) depicts the areas where the war took place. The scale is about 40 miles to the inch. The 280 counters represent the military formations including Turks, Greeks, French, Italians and many others.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": {"217042": "Fiery Dragon Second edition in small box"}, "average": "6.85897", "name": "Byzantium Reborn", "playingtime": "240", "boardgamemechanic": {"2046": "Area Movement"}, "age": "12", "usersrated": "39", "boardgamesubdomain": {"4664": "Wargames"}, "boardgamefamily": {"21990": "Byzantium"}}, "13291": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic73710.jpg", "boardgameimplementation": {"205398": "Citadels (2016 edition)"}, "poll": {}, "boardgamedesigner": {"125": {"name": "Bruno Faidutti"}}, "statistics": {}, "yearpublished": "2004", "maxplayers": "8", "boardgameartist": {"12519": "Cyrille Daujean"}, "boardgamepublisher": {"267": {"name": "999 Games"}}, "maxplaytime": "60", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic73710_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "60", "boardgamecategory": {"1023": {"name": "Bluffing"}}, "description": "An expansion for the German edition of the game.

With more men and material landing each day, the growing power of the American and British forces should have resulted in a drive inland -- but three weeks after the landings, the shallow beachhead had only expanded slightly. There was growing concern that the bloody fighting of the First World War might be repeated.<br/><br/>British forces should have captured the city of Caen, just 15 kilometers from Gold Beach, on the first or second day of the invasion. British Field Marshal Bernard Montgomery, commanding 21st Army Group, faced great pressure to secure the city and tie down German mobile forces while the Americans captured the port of Cherbourg. But a direct attack on the city itself failed at the cost of many Canadian and British lives.<br/><br/>Next the British attacked west of Caen, where a successful advance might outflank the city and force a German retreat: Operation EPSOM, an attempt to gain by maneuver what could not be taken by assault. British divisions, fresh to war but having trained for years, faced the feared SS troopers of four panzer divisions. Both would soon learn the harsh realities of war in the hedgerows and fields of Normandy.<br/><br/>Although Montgomery in the end did not force the Germans to abandon Caen itself, he did draw the German armor onto the British Army, who both tied it up and ground it down. The whole purpose of sending I and II SS Panzer Corps to Normandy was to drive the Allies into the sea. Steady British efforts forced the commitment of the armored formations as they arrived on the field and so depleted them that no coordinated German offensive was ever launched.<br/><br/>Beyond Normandy is a Panzer Grenadier game covering the British operations from the end of June to the middle of July and the German reactions to them. Three maps (two 22&quot; x 34&quot; and one 22&quot; x 17&quot;) depict the actual battlefield at 200 meters a hex and include individual bridges, villages, tracks, roads, hedgerows and church steeples.<br/><br/>The 583 playing pieces represent leaders, infantry and tank platoons and artillery batteries. They include the weapons employed by British infantry and armored brigades and German SS and Wehrmacht panzer and infantry divisions. New British tank types include the Churchill, Cromwell and Firefly tanks, the flame-throwing Crocodile, and the bomb-throwing AVRE. The Germans bring tough SS grenadiers, Panther tanks and more.<br/><br/>The game includes 39 scenarios and 5 &quot;super&quot; scenarios (combining two or more of the scenarios into a large-scale operational scenario).<br/><br/>This game is part of the Panzer Grenadier series<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": {"218211": "First Edition"}, "average": "6.7817", "name": "Panzer Grenadier: Beyond Normandy", "playingtime": "180", "boardgamemechanic": {"2072": "Dice Rolling"}, "age": "12", "boardgameexpansion": {}, "usersrated": "112", "boardgamesubdomain": {"4664": "Wargames"}, "boardgamefamily": {"123": "Panzer Grenadier"}}, "13315": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1616838.jpg", "poll": {}, "boardgamedesigner": {"153": {"name": "Richard Halliwell"}}, "statistics": {}, "yearpublished": "1990", "maxplayers": "4", "boardgameartist": {"16414": "Chris Baker"}, "boardgamepublisher": {"26": {"name": "Games Workshop Ltd."}}, "maxplaytime": "45", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1616838_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "45", "boardgamecategory": {"1042": {"name": "Expansion for Base-game"}}, "description": "Every hundred years, the Dark Angels, the Warriors From The Sky, come to the world of the Plains People.

The game uses a single deck, and follows the basic mechanics of most trick taking games: the starting player leads a suit, and then the other players are forced to follow unless they have none of that suit left, in which case they are allowed to either toss a useless card of another suit, or to play a trump.<br/><br/>The object of Whist is to acquire tricks in excess of 6, each 1 of which scores 1 point. In this basic form the game usually goes to 5, though 7 and 9 point variations were also common. The trumps in standard Whist were determined by facing the last card to be dealt.<br/><br/>In addition, like most card games, there are a large variety of variants. A common one involves pre-determing the trump suit, and running them in order from hand to hand. (For instance: Hearts first, then Diamonds, Spades, and finally Clubs, and then start over again)<br/><br/>Another, less popular and luck oriented variant involves giving a 4 point bonus to a partnership if it held the 'Honours' run of A - K - Q - J in the suit that was trump for that hand or 2 points if it had 3 of the 4. As this is based on the cards as dealt it is a very luck based option, and as such has fallen out of common use though it was once considered a standard way to play the game.<br/><br/>Other variants include bidding (quite common, and turn the game into something closely resembling Spades) and two player adaptations.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": {"149717": "ASS Ariston Edition"}, "average": "6.41121", "name": "Whist", "playingtime": "60", "boardgamemechanic": {"2019": "Partnerships"}, "age": "12", "usersrated": "322", "boardgamesubdomain": {"4666": "Abstract Games"}, "boardgamefamily": {"24434": "Card Games: Outplay Games"}}, "13338": {"boardgamedesigner": {"3": {"name": "(Uncredited)"}}, "poll": {}, "name": "A Play On Words", "playingtime": "30", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": {"2072": "Dice Rolling"}, "yearpublished": "2006", "usersrated": "0", "maxplayers": "2", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic54059_t.jpg", "average": "0", "statistics": {}, "boardgamepublisher": {"299": {"name": "Universal Games"}}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic54059.jpg", "boardgameversion": {"126069": "First Edition"}, "maxplaytime": "30", "boardgamecategory": {"1025": {"name": "Word Game"}}, "age": "0", "minplaytime": "30", "description": "You have three minutes to unscramble the letters to form a word.

The suits have no significance other than when playing the five special cards. The person playing the King terminates the sequence and may restart it with a card of their choice.

This team has been given the task of managing the planet Clarion for the next 50 years. Note that a Clarion year is much shorter than our own.<br/><br/>A brief history of Clarion (from the game manual)<br/><br/>The plant Clarion is much like the Earth in size, climate, and geography. However, the land area is smaller than the Earth&rsquo;s. The living things on the planet are similar to plants and animals on Earth with one exception &ndash; there is no native animal like man.<br/>      About 10 years ago the Council of Civilized Planets transported 100,000 colonists to Clarion from the planet Rasmuss. These colonists are similar to people, but are smaller. They have shorter life spans than people and look a little different, too. You could call them &ldquo;humanoids.&rdquo; Their food is similar to ours.<br/>      The natural state of Clarion is like Earth&rsquo;s before man began to change it. Some of the land is flat and has a mild climate that is good for farming. There are some deserts of purple sand. They are fiery hot during the day and cold at night. There are other regions of bare rock that separate the fertile areas. All the land is on one continent. The rest of the planet is a blue-green ocean much less salty than Earth&rsquo;s.<br/>      There seems to be only one major threat to life on Clarion &ndash; the disease Holobinkitis. It attacks both plants and animals, Clarionmen included. No one knows the cause of the disease or a cure for it. It is almost always fatal if you catch it.<br/>      Clarion has one large and unusual mineral deposit. The mineral is Walterite ore. In fact, Clarion is the only known planet with such large deposits. Several scientists say that the metal obtained from the ore is superior to iron or steel for most uses. However, Walterite is usually found under a thick layer of hard rock. Thus, it is often difficult to mine.<br/>      In comparison to Earth, Clarion has a low standard of living. The Clarionmen don&rsquo;t produce all the things need and want. As a result, they are thrifty. They don&rsquo;t like to spend money unless it&rsquo;s absolutely necessary. Then they want to get a &ldquo;good deal: for every bit of money they spend.<br/>      They have some of the same problems the Pilgrims had when they first settled in North America. Food sometimes becomes scarce, and it is expensive to import food from other planets. One of the big problems with raising crops is that the insects on Clarion really like to eat them. Therefore, a large part of every crop is lost to insects.<br/>      Most of the Clarionmen say they will stay on in spite of the hardships. They believe Clarion has a bright future once things get going. The Clarionmen usually give three reasons for leaving their home planet of Rasmuss:<br/>      1: It was getting too crowded there.<br/>      2. There was a promise of a better life on Clarion.<br/>      3, Clarion is a beautiful place to live.<br/>Most Clarionmen have a strong appreciation for beauty, and they enjoy nature. They look forward to more leisure time outdoors.<br/><br/>End quote from game manual<br/><br/>As manager of Clarion, the players will keep track of four variables: population, income, food, and environment. They are given a budget of 10 bux (a Clarion buc is equivalent to about one million U.S. dollars) to fund planetary project for the next five years. Each budget will determine which projects Clarion will fund for the following five years. In the course of the complete game ten 5-year budgets will be prepared.<br/><br/>On turn one Clarion&rsquo;s population index is at 100, each unit representing 1000 Clarion citizens. The income index and the food index also start at 100. When the population index equals income index, citizens have enough money to buy basic necessities. If income exceeds population, Clarion citizen&rsquo;s standard of living will have improved. When the population index equals the food index there is enough food to provide each citizen with a well-balanced but simple diet. If food index falls below the population index, citizens are going hungry, perhaps even starving.<br/><br/>When humans first landed on Clarion, the environment index was 100. The air was pure, the oceans and river clean, the land beautiful. In the first years of colonizing Clarion, the environment index has decreased to 90. The population would like the environment restored so that environment index is at least as high as the population index. However, they would also like the income and food indices to increase relative to the population index as well.<br/><br/>For each budget, players have 10 bux to spend on projects. There are five different groups of projects that may be funded: red, blue, orange, yellow, and green. Each group (or color) contains three projects, only one of which may be funded. Each funded project may be funded for 2, 4, or 6 bux. Of course any group with no funded projects costs no bux.<br/><br/>Red (Agricultural Improvement projects)<br/>1) Clear more land and prepare it for raising crops.<br/>2) Import chemical fertilizers and pesticides.<br/>3) Buy machinery to plant, cultivate, and harvest crops.<br/><br/>Blue (Scientific Research projects)<br/>1) Conduct research to develop new varieties of corn, wheat, and rice with higher yields per acre.<br/>2) Conduct research to identify the cause and cure of Holobinkitis.<br/>3) Conduct research to find better ways to mine and use Walterite.<br/><br/>Orange (Industrial Expansion projects)<br/>1) Build more Walterite mines and purification plants.<br/>2) Build more highways and railroads to connect towns.<br/>3) Construct new electric power plants.<br/><br/>Orange (Public Education projects)<br/>1) Build more schools for all age groups and for general, professional, and technical education,<br/>2) Pay people to go to graduate schools of civil engineering, biochemistry, medicine, and agriculture.<br/>3) Finance the Einstein Plan: a) send a few of the most capable individuals to Earth for advanced study, and b) connect more Clarion homes to the educational television network.<br/><br/>Green (Industrial &amp; Residential Pollution Control projects)<br/>1) Construct more and improved treatment plants for city and factory waste.<br/>2) Finance the Wright Plan: a) buy areas of land around lakes and oceans to be used for recreation, b) build mile-high apartment buildings surrounded by 100 acre parks in the center of cities.<br/>3) Equip more chimneys of homes, industries, and other buildings with antismoke equipment.<br/><br/>The mechanics of playing this game:<br/>A major part of this game is the 50 8&frac12; x 11&rdquo; cards. These cards have a variety of small holes punched in them similar to early IBM punch cards. Each of the 15 possible projects has 3 cards: a 2 bux, a 4 bux, and a 6 bux card. And in case no project for a given color is funded, there is also a zero bux card for each of the five colors. To make their budget, the players select one card of each of five colors not to exceed their 10 bux limit. When the players have chosen their five cards, the five cards are stacked together revealing one (and only one) hole that is open in all of them.<br/><br/>The game also includes a data book. This book contains data pages for Population Change, Income Change, Food Change, and Environment Change for the different rounds of the game. For the first round of the game, the players turn to the &ldquo;Rounds 1 &amp; 2&rdquo; pages, where they are presented with four different population change pages.<br/><br/>It is almost quaint to realize that this game was made in the days before Dungeons &amp; Dragons and the ready availability of four sided dice. The data book carefully explains how to flip a coin twice to generate a random number from 1 to 4.<br/><br/>The players then lay their group of five project cards on the randomly selected data sheet to determine how much that particular datum has changed. This process is followed for population, income, food, and environment changes. The final results are written down, and play advances to the next round.<br/><br/>To play round 2, players select another set of projects and proceed as they did in round 1, possible selecting different projects.<br/><br/>As play progresses through rounds 3 - 10, the appropriate pages of the data book are used. Blank graphs are provided to help players visualize the results of their chosen projects.<br/><br/>The game is completed at the end of 10 rounds. The players are then asked if they think the citizens of Clarion would be pleased with the state of their planet at the end? Did their team mange Clarion well? Could the same results have been achieved with less money?<br/><br/>After playing the game, the management team should decide how well it did. If they play the game again, they can try to do better. They can decide what is better. Comparing the results with those of another team, who did the better job. Here are some things to think about in deciding a winner or which job of Planet Management was best:<br/>1) Were the same results obtained by spending less money?<br/>2) Which set of final index values would you prefer to live with?<br/>3) Do food and income indices compare favorably with the population index?<br/>4) If things continued to change in the same way for another fifty years, would Clarion be a good place to live?<br/><br/>"}, "13400": {"boardgamedesigner": {"4189": {"name": "Great Circle Entertainment LTD"}}, "poll": {}, "name": "TOPONA  The Original People Of North America", "playingtime": "0", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": {"2023": "Co-operative Play"}, "yearpublished": "1996", "usersrated": "2", "maxplayers": "6", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic62346_t.jpg", "average": "5", "statistics": {}, "boardgamepublisher": {"565": {"name": "Northern Games Co.

Their world is ruled by the Prince, the most powerful and influential of the city's Kindred. The Prince's word is inviolate and his actions unquestionable. However, the Prince is dead and his legacy is but ashes. The mantle of leadership must fall upon another Kindred resident of the city &iuml;&iquest;&frac12; one of the Primogen, the ruling council that normally supports and advises the Prince in his decisions and judgments. The competition will be fierce, and only the most cunning and resourceful Kindred will prevail. Deals will be struck, alliances will be forged, and agreements will be broken. Do you have what it takes to become the new Prince of the City?<br/><br/>The aim of the game is simple: Score more Prestige than any other player so that you may be declared the new Prince. You gain Prestige by controlling areas of the board that are defined as realms of mortal Influence. Each category is further divided into zones, and some zones are more prestigious than others. Gain even more Prestige by resolving Events that affect the Kindred world, or by implementing various Strategies that give you a unique edge over your opponents. Most troublesome, Prestige can be lost as well as gained - if you are outmaneuvered, you may find yourself becoming Notorious. In the process of building your Prestige, you may acquire Resources or directly Challenge your opponents to hinder them or send them to torpor. You must also keep track of your Blood, which is used up as game turns go by and which you spend to activate Discipline powers. Influence, Resources, Strategy and Blood are the currencies of Kindred unlife, and thus they are all bargaining chips for you to use on the way to ultimate victory.<br/><br/>Prince of the City is designed for three to five players, each of whom represents a different clan from Vampire: The Requiem. Of moderate complexity, the game calls for strategy, tactics, diplomacy and guile to succeed. A number of optional and advanced rules provide even more strategy and replay value for more experienced players.<br/><br/>Created in the model of the finest European boardgames, the Prince of the City box contains everything you need to play the game, including a full-color board of artwork depicting the city, a rulebook describing how to play, one deck of playing cards (Events, Resources and Strategy), five 10-sided dice, five miniatures and a number of counters and tokens.&quot;<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": {"114618": "First Edition"}, "average": "6.39194", "name": "Vampire: Prince of the City", "playingtime": "180", "boardgamemechanic": {"2019": "Partnerships"}, "age": "12", "usersrated": "577", "boardgamesubdomain": {"5497": "Strategy Games"}, "boardgamefamily": {"7757": "From RPG books to board games"}}, "13457": {"boardgamedesigner": {"3": {"name": "(Uncredited)"}}, "poll": {}, "name": "The Great American Flag Game", "playingtime": "20", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": {"2035": "Roll / Spin and Move"}, "yearpublished": "1940", "usersrated": "0", "maxplayers": "4", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic163354_t.jpg", "average": "0", "statistics": {}, "boardgamepublisher": {"28": {"name": "Parker Brothers"}}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic163354.jpg", "boardgameversion": {"199717": "Parker Brothers 1943"}, "maxplaytime": "20", "boardgamecategory": {"1094": {"name": "Educational"}}, "age": "8", "minplaytime": "20", "description": "This educational game was released in 1940, and re-released in 1943 with slightly altered rules.

So BRIO gave Alga the task to invent and publish a new letter-tile-laying game with the name Alfapet, while firstly  Spear's (one edition of Scrabble) and later their new owner Mattel (all subsequent editions in Swedish) started publishing Scrabble in Sweden under its original name.

The boards look a bit different; in Alfapet, there are for instance squares that decrease the number of points you get for a word, and there are +4 and *4 squares. With special arrow tiles it is possible to make a turn in the middle of a word. With a stop tile, you are allowed to lay a word directly after another without actually using the letters from the original word. It is also legal to lay a word in parallel adjacent to an existing word, as long as all the words thus created the other way are legal.<br/><br/>To celebrate Alga's 90th anniversary a special limited edition was released called Alfapet Limited Edition.

You fill the bottle with water and add aquarium gravel, salvage items (anchor, cannon, pistol, sextant, and lantern), and the diving bell.

A player starts his turn by drawing a Mail Card and playing as many cities in sequence as possible. He then draws cards to refill his hand and may play new cards drawn if they continue his city sequence. When he can no longer play red cards he draws 1 card from the blue deck and follows its instructions.
