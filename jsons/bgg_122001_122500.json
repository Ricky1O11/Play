It was released in Japan on April 25, 2003. Despite that its last showing at Electronic Entertainment Expo (E3) was in English, Nintendo cancelled the North American localization of GiFTPiA. In English, the game would most likely be better understood as called &quot;Giftopia&quot; to represent the two words, gift and utopia.<br/><br/>GiFTPiA follows the protagonist Pockle, a resident of Nanashi Island, who, on the day of his coming of age ceremony, oversleeps and misses the whole thing. The mayor of the island, Mayer, is so incensed that he orders Pokkle's arrest and a fine of five million &quot;Mane&quot; (the game's currency) to recoup the costs of the event. Thus, it is up to Pockle to work off his huge debt. At the game's start, Pockle must cope with heavy restrictions: an early curfew, a ball &amp; chain, having his face pixelated and a robot police chief named Mappo. Throughout his adventure, Pockle is assisted by his dog Tao and his girlfriend Kyappa. There is also a large cast of supporting characters that live on Nanashi Island and interact with Pockle, including a bartender that goes by Peevee and a radio DJ called DEEJ. Pockle eventually encounters an old man who will give him some mushroom soup and teach him about other paths to adulthood via helping others.<br/><br/>GiFTPiA is similar to Nintendo's Animal Crossing in that both games place an emphasis on interacting with other characters. In order to meet the game's five million Mane requirement, the player must initially take menial jobs such as fishing, collecting fruit, or repairing signs. After meeting the old man, the player must travel the island, collecting its residents' wishes, and fulfill them. However, the player has numerous restrictions that are lifted as the game progresses. For instance, if the player stays out after curfew, ghosts will chase Pockle to his house. If he does not make it back, he will be put to sleep, making him vulnerable to theft. The player is also responsible for making Pockle eat, as he will otherwise starve to death.<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;GiFTPiA&quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "122044": {"statistics": {}, "name": "Snowpack Park", "videogamemode": {"2422": "Local Multiplayer"}, "videogameversion": {"158538": "WiiWare edition"}, "average": "0", "videogametheme": {"2471": "Animals"}, "usersrated": "0", "videogamegenre": {"2156": "Simulation"}, "videogameplatform": {"4441": "Wii"}, "poll": {}, "description": "Snowpack Park is a WiiWare game starring your own Mii character and a whole colony of lovable penguins.

Each piece is 4.75 inches long, yet every piece is unique in shape because it is split with a mallet and wedge in Maine USA rather than being sawed perfectly the same, by the zillions, in China.<br/>It is the unique shape created by this lovingly hand crafted production, and the random tapers and twists of each piece, that makes Tumblewood both beautiful to look at and hold, and more challenging to play. Each game requires a new approach, based on the pieces you have chosen to play. Stacking can go up high, or outward with counter balances and cantilevered sticks. The game can be played solo or with up to 8 or more players. It can be a co-operative game, where all try to work together to build a structure, or a competitive game, where each player tries to place a piece in such a way that it stays on the stack but make the next play more difficult. Tumblewood, in a hand made wooden box is a game that you will want to leave out to be seen and played by anyone who comes to visit. In fact, a pencil is included so that players can sign and date one of the pieces after playing. This creates a living game that becomes a record of gatherings and good fun.<br/><br/>Tumblewood Rules:<br/><br/>     Place two relatively matched pieces parallel on top of the Tumblewood box, then begin to build up.<br/>     Every piece above the foundation must touch at least two other pieces.<br/>     There is no wrong way to play.

It is set on a dying world, orbiting a morose, purple sun - a sentient star watching life fade away. The Eternal Empire has banished the shadow of death and outlived most other life on this world; the price they have paid for eternity is their flesh. After an epoch of stagnation, the birth of the prophetess Mantra heralds a threat to this Eternal Order. Driven by her creativity the Young Realms are formed; born out of the clash of arms. They seek to restore humanity to its former creativity, even at the price of regaining their mortality.<br/><br/>The game can be played in two ways. The battle engine can be used for individual contests between two players, using armies selected with the games points system (for balanced battles). These battles are fought on a grid, using counters for pieces and are resolved using D6. The game uses a system of statistics which represent the abilities of each regiment.<br/>In addition to these random battles, there is the opportunity to play the full Shadowstone Saga campaign, which is more like an RPG - only one where you run an empire, as opposed to a single character! This is played on a larger 'overview' map of your Empire, and will utilise the battle engine when armies clash.<br/><br/>The goal of the game is to overcome your opponent. In addition to straight out brawls, there are objective-based missions, headhunting missions, breakout missions, and even missions where the intention is to intentionally lose a battle without your opponent suspecting your motives (the campaign map creates all manner of intrigues!).<br/><br/>--------<br/><br/>&quot;Having fulfilled their destiny, the Phoenix Knights were granted independence, and left to safeguard the empire in their own manner. Phoenix stones were built in their honour; huge monoliths that dominated the landscape like mountains, forever breathing clouds of bone-white smoke (which could be cloying to those who lived near them) to purify the air.<br/>  Decades came and went, then centuries, then a millennium, and then millennia. The other civilizations surrounding the Eternal Empire, rivals and allies, old friends and ancient grudges, slowly started to die out. And as for the wildlife of the world, that too started to dry up and die, and the world became more and more inhospitable, as the balance of life and death was grossly upset. <br/>  Although they were free from mortality, the bodies of the eternal folk were still subject to rot. At first no one really noticed, then the younger ones grew into wrinkled bodies quite soon, and then skin started to peel, everyone had a smaller appetite, flowers blossomed later in the year and perished earlier &ndash; but no one talked about it, for it was happening to everyone. After a huge span of time (beyond the count of calendars, for these eternal folk started to lose track of the passing of years) they had lost their flesh, leaving nothing but their skeletons and their sentience. <br/>   A child had not been birthed since the slaying of the last Shadow Knight an aeon ago, and not a single law had changed for an epoch, and so the order of the Eternal Empire persisted, still ruled by the benevolent High-King Druidainh. The art and culture of the Eternal empire had not progressed, and the lives of its people were a constant repetitious cycle, devoid of any excitement. The bards played the same old songs, which had long since fallen out of relevance, being endlessly repeated until every word became a clich&eacute;. The word humanity was losing its meaning, there was no nature to oppose itself too but for the long-living fungal blooms in their benign forests, the gnarled trees, and the older scaled-species who spent most of their time in dozing slumbers.<br/>   Obscure wars broke out between barbarians and the borderguards, but these were easily quelled, and so governance of the empire required less and less innovation until it was merely a matter of course. The peasants tilled farms of dust, the merchants bartered between themselves, as if they were playing a pointless game. The beast-tamers snoozed beside their wyverns, the spell-callers animated their artificial creations (the dragon-like Draemh) and rode their backs over still nights, lost in their own dull thoughts. The royal philosophers had found all of the answers to life and sat idle, the astronomers stared up at the same old stars, now convinced that they never moved but sat perfectly still like the monks in their mountain retreats...&quot;<br/><br/>"}, "122136": {"boardgamedesigner": {"7305": {"name": "Irene Wolf"}}, "poll": {}, "name": "Meid\u00e4n oma nukkumatti", "playingtime": "15", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": {"2023": "Co-operative Play"}, "yearpublished": "2006", "usersrated": "3", "boardgamefamily": {"18199": "Unser Sandm\u00e4nnchen"}, "maxplayers": "4", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1262582_t.jpg", "average": "2.66667", "statistics": {}, "boardgamepublisher": {"8591": {"name": "CN Publishing"}}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1262582.jpg", "boardgameversion": {"159036": "First edition"}, "maxplaytime": "15", "boardgamecategory": {"1041": {"name": "Children's Game"}}, "age": "3", "minplaytime": "15", "description": "In this game players roll special die and according to the result put either a star card or a piece of sandman on the board.

Some characters (Goku, Gohan, Vegeta, Trunks, etc.) have brief power-ups into their Super Saiyan forms. Characters have &quot;super moves&quot;, throws, juggles, dashes, etc. that can trace their roots back to these earlier 1990s games.<br/><br/>There are a variety of modes for gameplay:<br/><br/>Original mode is a basic arcade mode, in which the player can use either a normal, or custom character to fight their way through 7 opponents (receiving a Dragonball for each victory) and gain experience on the way.The 6th opponent will be Freiza and The 7th opponent will always be Cell.<br/><br/>Z Survivor is a &quot;survival&quot; mode in which the player fights various opponents for as long as their health remains above zero. Battles all take place in the world tournament ring (with the same background music each time), and last a single round. If the player wins the round, they play a &quot;roulette&quot;-style game in which their selection endows them with items such as additional experience, extra health, Dragon Balls, etc. If using a custom character, the player will gain experience.<br/><br/>Training mode can help a player perfect their skills against a computer opponent of their customization (non-moving, responsive, etc.). Battles take place within Vegeta's training room.<br/><br/>Versus mode is a standard two-player versus mode. Players may use either the default characters or their own custom versions from either memory card slot.<br/><br/>In Shenron Summon mode, upon collecting seven Dragon Balls with a custom character, the player may enter this mode to summon Shenron. The player may then wish for various items, such as additional attacks, unlockable characters, etc. After making a wish, the Dragon Balls disappear and must be recollected in another game mode.<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;Super Dragon Ball Z&quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "122176": {"statistics": {}, "name": "Super Robot Wars Alpha", "videogamemode": {"2149": "Single-Player"}, "videogameversion": {"159253": "Japanese PlayStation edition"}, "average": "9", "videogameseries": {"17830": "Super Robot Wars Alpha"}, "videogametheme": {"2318": "War - Future"}, "videogamefranchise": {"5285": "Super Robot Wars"}, "videogamegenre": {"2155": "RPG"}, "videogameplatform": {"4433": "PlayStation"}, "usersrated": "2", "poll": {}, "description": "Super Robot Wars Alpha (\u30b9\u30fc\u30d1\u30fc\u30ed\u30dc\u30c3\u30c8\u5927\u6226&alpha; S\u016bp\u0101 Robotto Taisen Arufa?), is part of the Super Robot Wars franchise, and was published for the PlayStation by Banpresto in 2000. Super Robot Wars Alpha is the initial game of the Alpha series, which spans the PlayStation and the PlayStation 2 platforms.  Chronologically, Super Robot Wars Alpha is directly followed by Super Robot Wars Alpha Gaiden. The series continues on the PlayStation 2 with the 2nd Super Robot Wars Alpha and concludes with the Super Robot Wars Alpha 3. Super Robot Wars Alpha is the first Super Robot Wars to feature fully animated attacks. Super Robot Wars Alpha introduces the &quot;Skill Point&quot; (localized as &quot;Battle Mastery&quot;) system, where decisions made in and out of battle can affect the game's difficulty and the player's chances of receiving and unlocking more powerful units and items.<br/><br/>In the year 179 of the New Western Calendar, the One Year War breaks out between the Earth Federation and the Principality of Zeon, but is halted when an object crashes to Earth, landing on South Atalia Island. An investigative team from the Extra-Over Technological Investigative Institute discovers the object is an alien battleship with highly-advanced technology. Despite the warnings of Dr. Bian Zoldark, the Federation hides the evidence of intelligent, extraterrestrial life, and uses the time to increase their military power. Bian founds the Divine Crusaders to utilize the Extra-Over Technology found on the ship to devise weapons capable of protecting the Earth from alien forces, should the planet become embroiled in a conflict.<br/><br/>During this time, economic troubles caused by the Federation's buildup sees the rise of many anti-Federation movements, such as the Neo-Zeon, who had retreated to the asteroid Axis. In response, the Federation establishes special forces units, such as the Titans and OZ. Other forces, such as the Demon Empire (from Brave Raideen) and Dr. Hell also threaten the Earth, but are pushed back by the teams of Mazinger Z, Getter Robo, and Raideen.<br/><br/>In the year 186, the Excelion battleship (from Gunbuster) battle a force of STMCs (Space Terrible Monster Crowd) when they are suddenly attacked by another alien fleet, known as the Aerogaters...<br/><br/>From this point on, the player can select from either a super robot or a real robot storyline, putting the player in command of the Grungust Type-2 or the Huckebein MK II, respectively.<br/><br/>Super Robot Wars Alpha allows the player to create their own character, giving them a name and birthdate, and selecting from 8 characters: four male and four female, The player then chooses another template and name for the character's significant other, as well as one of four personalities: &quot;cool and nihilistic&quot;, &quot;shy&quot;, &quot;weird&quot; or &quot;hot-blooded&quot;, to apply a voice during combat. In the Super Robot Taisen: Original Generation series, these templates for the protagonist and his or her significant other becomes the basis for the following characters:<br/><br/>Kusuha Mizuha&mdash;considered the canonical pilot of the Grungust Type-2 and RyuKoOh. Adopts the &quot;shy&quot; female archetype in Original Generation.<br/>    Brooklyn Luckfield&mdash;considered the canonical pilot of the Huckebein MK II and KoRyuOh. The &quot;hot-blooded&quot; male archetype in Original Generation.<br/>    Ryoto Hikawa&mdash;considered the canonical pilot of the Huckebein MK III.

Super Robot Wars Alpha Gaiden, or simply, Alpha Gaiden, includes several rare series choices, such as After War Gundam X, Turn-A Gundam and Xabungle, all of which debut in the game.<br/><br/>Shortly after the events of Alpha, the Earth Federation has covered up many of the events in the climatic battle with the antagonist Aerogaters, but the gravity shock wave from the detonation of the Excelion (from Gunbuster) in the Battle of the Solar System's Absolute Defense is rapidly approaching the Earth, and threatens to wipe out the space colonies and the planet. The Earth's only hope is the Aegis System, which could shield the Earth Sphere from the shock wave.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, the heroes are sent to an alternate future, where the Earth has been ravaged by the wave. Faced with a new threat in the form of the Ancestors, the heroes must find a way to return to their time and prevent this alternate, dystopic future from happening.<br/><br/>Super Robot Wars Alpha Gaiden also includes the final appearance of the Mas\u014d Kishin &quot;Banpresto Originals&quot; in the Alpha series, and the last appearance of the characters, besides Masaki Andoh and the Cybuster, Shu Shirakawa and the Granzon, and Lune Zoldark and the Valsione. Although many fans suspect this is due to a copyright backlash with Winkysoft, it is stated in an interview with the creator of Super Robot Wars he merely wants to give more plot attention towards the other original characters, considering the previous titles have dealt with the Mas\u014d Kishin plots rather extensively. Additionally, the game features the first appearance of Sanger Zonvolt, who later becomes one of the selectable protagonists of the 2nd Super Robot Wars Alpha.<br/><br/>Gameplay wise, Alpha Gaiden is the first Super Robot Wars game where all the weapons of a unit are upgraded simultaneously, this would later go on to be used in almost every game made after Alpha Gaiden, save for the Original Generation games. Alpha Gaiden also introduces the Support ability for Attack and Defense, allowing units situated beside one another to attack after each other, or take an oncoming attacking. This ability would also go on to be used in almost every subsequent game.

The 3rd Super Robot Wars Alpha, or simply, Alpha 3, contains one of the largest casts to ever be placed together within a Super Robot Wars game. Series debuting in this game are Mobile Suit Gundam SEED, The King of Braves GaoGaiGar Final, Cyber Troopers Virtual-On Marz and Cyber Troopers Virtual-On Oratorio Tangram.<br/><br/>Alpha 3 continues to use the Squad System from 2nd Super Robot Wars Alpha, where a maximum of four units can be assigned to a squad that counts as a single unit. Since all playable mecha are of different sizes, a size limit is placed, thus the player must consider building an effective squad. The system has received several improvements, including:<br/><br/>The ability to auto-generate squads based on &quot;balance&quot; (generally grouping units together by series), &quot;power&quot; (a strong squad leader combined with strong supporting allies), or &quot;speed&quot; (based on movement rate; units with the same rate are grouped together). This can be useful for the novice player or one who does not wish to go to the extra effort of building squads by oneself.<br/>    Access to the item, upgrade and pilot menus from the squad-setup menu.<br/>    The option to change each squad members' reactions when targeted by an enemy ALL attack (a choice between &quot;dodge&quot; or &quot;defend&quot;)<br/>    Squad attack animation is slightly improved; the entire squad is now shown onscreen, instead of the one attacking.<br/><br/>Alpha 3 also contains the following:<br/>    Over 60 stages, as well as bonus &quot;EX&quot; scenarios, side stories to the main game.<br/>    Kazuma Kaneko, known primarily as the artist of Atlus' Shin Megami Tensei series, participates as a mechanical designer for the game. Among his designs is the Werkbau, one of the protagonist machines.<br/>    Three possible endings: the &quot;normal&quot; and &quot;good&quot; endings, with the addition of a few bonuses in the &quot;good&quot; ending, and the &quot;Ideon&quot; ending, based on the apocalyptic conclusion to the anime of the same name.<br/>    Ichirou Mizuki, who is involved in many openings and endings in a number of titles (including the Mazinger and Getter series), makes his seiyu debut in the role of the game's main antagonist.<br/><br/>The game's plot is told over the course of the 3 previous Alpha titles, but Alpha 3 focuses primarily on the events of the following series: Mobile Suit Gundam SEED, Dancouga &ndash; Super Beast Machine God, Macross 7, Steel Jeeg, The End of Evangelion, Gunbuster, The King of Braves GaoGaiGar, Ch\u014ddenji Robo Combattler V, Ch\u014ddenji Machine Voltes V, T\u014dsh\u014d Daimos, and Ideon. However there is an overarching plot that is told over the backdrop of the various series. The game starts at the end of the &quot;War of Seals&quot; (see 2nd Super Robot Wars Alpha) with the crew of the Ra Calium coming upon a massive ring like structure in the Asteroid Field. This Crossgate (as it is later called) causes the Excelion (which blew up at the end of the first Alpha game to take out the STMC) and its crew to reappear even though two years have passed since the end of the first Alpha. The game then gives a summary of all the events of the previous 3 games and depending on which character the player chose at the start of the game will then start the story from there. As the story progresses the Alpha numbers find themselves fighting against the Akashic Record itself to stop the complete destruction of the galaxy which is known as &quot;Apocalypsis&quot;.<br/><br/>When starting a new game, players are offered a choice between one of four original characters, each having their own distinct personality and robot (although information, such as birthdate, are customizable). Each character's story is also different; as a result, the player's choice will determine which characters from licenced series will appear first.<br/><br/>The Super Robot Types<br/><br/>Touma Kanou (VA: Yasuyuki Kase): Hot-blooded, dramatic and loud, Touma is a delivery boy who finds himself as the pilot of a prototype super robot named Raioh and later DaiRaiOh. Starting the game with Touma will have characters from GaoGaiGar appearing to aid him in the first stages.<br/><br/>Kusuha Mizuha (VA: Mikako Takahashi): This is Kusuha's third appearance in the Alpha series, and is the only returning selectable character from Super Robot Wars Alpha and the 2nd Super Robot Wars Alpha, thus is often considered the protagonist of the series. Kusuha begins with the GouRyu-Kai, where the Mazinkaiser and Shin Getter Robo teams make an early appearance in the first stages.<br/><br/>Brooklyn Luckfield (VA: Tomokazu Sugita): Also known as &quot;Bullet&quot;, this is his third appearance in the Alpha series, and is only playable if Kusuha is selected as the protagonist. He begins using the RaiKou-Kai Kushua later pilots &quot;Shin RyuKoOh&quot; and Bullet pilots &quot;Shin KoRyuOh&quot;.<br/><br/>The Real Robot Types<br/><br/>Cobray Gordon (VA: Y\u016bki Tai): A mysterious young man who first appears in a machine that turns out to be Balmarian in origin. He loses his memory when something absorbs his unit and mutates it into the powerful, enigmatic Werkbau which later upgraded into the chaotic Dis Astranagant. Cobray's route is often considered the more interesting of the new characters, as his true identity offers a real surprise and treat to longtime Super Robot Wars players. Cobray's route offers characters from the Universal Century Gundam series at the very start.<br/><br/>Arado Balanga (VA: Kaichi Kazuya) &amp; Seolla Schweizer (VA: Yumi Kakuzu): This is Arado and Seolla's second appearance in the Alpha series, having first appeared in the 2nd Super Robot Wars Alpha. They are only playable if Cobray is selected as the protagonist, and both pilot the Wild Wurger and Wild Falken units, respectively.<br/><br/>Selena Recital (VA: Y\u016bko Sat\u014d): Speaking in a combination of Japanese and Spanish, this mysterious and deadly secret agent's true intentions are always in question. Players are expected to switch sides more often than any other character when using Selena. Her mecha, the AS Soleares and later the AS Alegrias, has the best speed of the four protagonists, in terms of performance and motif, as well as having the greatest variety of attacks, which bestow negative status on enemy units. Selena's route offers characters from Gundam SEED and Gundam Wing Endless Waltz in the earliest stages.<br/><br/>Ibis Douglas (VA: Akeno Watanabe), Tsugumi Takakura (VA: Tomoko Hasekawa) &amp; Sleigh Presty (VA: Miki Nagasawa): This is Ibis, Tsugumi and Sleigh's second appearance in the Alpha series, having first appeared in the 2nd Super Robot Wars Alpha. They are only playable if Selena is selected as the protagonist. Ibis and Tsugumi return in the Altairion and Sleigh in the Vegalion.<br/><br/>Appearing in all four of the originals' stories is the SRX Team, composed of Ryusei Date, Raidiese F. Branstein, Aya Kobayashi, Mai Kobayashi and Viletta Vadim. With the exception of Viletta, all were absent in the 2nd Super Robot Wars Alpha. Initially, Ryusei sorties in the R-Blade Custom, while Viletta returns to the R-Gun Powered, after piloting the Huckebein MK III L. Later on, the SRX team receives the SRX altered, which Ryusei names Banpreios.<br/><br/>Sanger Zonvolt, having first appeared in Super Robot Wars Alpha Gaiden, makes his third appearance in the Alpha series, piloting the Dygenguard, while R&auml;tsel Feinschmecker makes his second appearance, piloting the Huckebein MK III R Trombe and later, the &quot;Ausenseiter&quot;. Both characters appear in all four of the originals' stories.<br/><br/>Noteworthy:<br/>    The inclusion of Virtual On marks the first time a video game character/franchise not owned by Banpresto, Bandai or Sunrise has been included in a Super Robot Wars game (Virtual On is produced by Sega).<br/>    This is one of the few Super Robot Wars games where a character makes a reference to another Super Robot Wars title in another universe or continuity. During the finale of End of Evangelion, Kaworu Nagisa makes comments that imply he came from, or alternately is aware of, the events of Super Robot Wars MX, which also featured End of Evangelion.<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;Super Robot Wars Alpha 3&quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "122180": {"statistics": {}, "name": "Super Robot Wars MX", "videogamemode": {"2149": "Single-Player"}, "videogameversion": {"159258": "Japanese PlayStation 2 edition"}, "average": "7", "videogametheme": {"2318": "War - Future"}, "videogamefranchise": {"5285": "Super Robot Wars"}, "videogamegenre": {"2155": "RPG"}, "videogameplatform": {"4434": "PlayStation 2"}, "usersrated": "1", "poll": {}, "description": "Super Robot Wars MX (\u30b9\u30fc\u30d1\u30fc\u30ed\u30dc\u30c3\u30c8\u5927\u6226MX S\u016bp\u0101 Robotto Taisen Emu Ekkusu) is a video game for the PlayStation 2 that was later ported to the PlayStation Portable with minor gameplay tweaks and titled Super Robot Wars MX Portable.<br/><br/>MX is also one of the few games in the franchise where the player does not have a choice of which &quot;Banpresto Original&quot; protagonist they can play. In this game, both original characters, Hugo Medio and Aqua Centolm, share the same machine, though there is still a choice of which two mechs to use: the super robot Garmraid or the real robot Cerberus.<br/><br/>Another notable change in MX is the Mobile Suit Gundam series do not partake in any of the major events of the game. Other than G Gundam, which loosely links their endings (from which the MX storyline is set after the endings, according to the events of Super Robot Wars Impact) and plots to the &quot;Banpresto Original&quot; storyline, the other Gundam productions almost solely exist in purpose to support the other non-Gundam titles of MX. It departs from other Super Robot Wars productions where conflicts between various Gundam factions must be taken as part of the overarching storyline. The only other game where a Gundam entry does not take a main role is Super Robot Wars W for the Nintendo DS and Super Robot Wars NEO from Wii.<br/><br/>Because of the series included in MX, it is often theorized the game was intended to be a direct sequel to Super Robot Wars Impact, since it includes several of the same series from that game, most notably Machine Robo. At the same time, both games feature the &quot;Free Route&quot; system: instead of following a completely linear progression, the player is able to choose what order to play certain scenarios in, potentially affecting the storyline or giving the opportunity to receive hidden units or characters. Additionally, MX and Impact use the same in-game font, and much of MX's soundtrack is remixed or rearranged from Impact's (a remixed version of the Impact theme is played in the final stages of the game, further supporting the theory). Some sprites and cut-ins from Impact are reused in MX; the most noticeable is arguably the God Gundam's sprite and the &quot;God Finger&quot; attack cut-in.<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;Super Robot Wars MX&quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "122181": {"statistics": {}, "name": "Super Trucks Racing", "videogamemode": {"2422": "Local Multiplayer"}, "videogameversion": {"159261": "English/European PlayStation 2 edition"}, "average": "6", "videogametheme": {"2456": "Driving"}, "usersrated": "1", "videogamegenre": {"2154": "Racing"}, "videogameplatform": {"4434": "PlayStation 2"}, "poll": {}, "description": "Super Trucks Racing (known in Europe as Super Trucks) is a truck racing video game for the PlayStation 2. All drivers and sponsor information are based on 2002 season of the Super Trucks racing series.<br/><br/>According to the European box art, the game compares itself to TOCA on steroids. However, the North American box art is considered to be a simplified version of the box art seen in Europe. All visual effects and reviews are absent in the North American release and the ESRB rating is shown instead of the ELSPA rating. The theme song used at the opening title is titled &quot;Bug&quot; and is sung in a heavy metal-style by the band called Feeder. Most of the other songs in the game are considered to be techno music done to the tune of the souped up engines at more than 122.0 miles per hour (196.3 km/h). This makes the trucks slightly faster than their real-life counterparts who are restricted to a maximum speed limit of 100.0 miles per hour (160.9 km/h) for safety reasons.<br/><br/>While the player doesn't have to worry about refueling his or her truck with gasoline, the player must maintain the temperature of his or her brakes by cooling them with water. An option in the menu can be toggled so this task can either be done manually or automatically by the game. Since there isn't an unlimited amount of water to cool the brakes, even automatic brake cooling doesn't automatically guarantee that the brake temperatures will remain cool in the longer races or practice sessions.<br/><br/>These specialized trucks are eighteen wheelers that are modified for racing on road courses; a large majority of these courses are located in Europe (including the Circuit Paul Armagnac in Nogaro, France). Formula One-like physics and turning dominate the tracks. Darlington Raceway (referred to in-game as Darlington Autodrome for no apparent reason) is considered to be one of the few North American courses in the game. However, it uses right as well as left turns like a road course instead of the standard oval used for NASCAR Sprint Cup Series racing. All the real-world drivers that are in the game are European in origin. Although pit road can be seen while driving through the start/finish line, the entrance to pit road is blocked and pit stops are not permitted in any mode of the game.<br/><br/>Possible modes:<br/><br/>Championship --    The player must guide his or her chosen driver to progressively harder championships. Five major championships with different rules are used. Harder championships are unlocked with championship victories in the easier tournaments.<br/><br/>Single Race -- This mode consists of racing against either a friend or the computer for bragging rights on a course. Tracks for racing in the single race mode must be unlocked by winning its respective race on the championship mode. Otherwise, the player is stuck with three race tracks.<br/><br/>Arcade Mode --  The arcade mode comes with special arcade timing similar to old-school racing games like Pole Position.<br/><br/>Time Trial Mode -- Time in this mode is recorded for up to 100 hours (roughly equivalent to either 99 hours, 59 minutes, 999 milliseconds or 4.2 days) and an unlimited number of laps.<br/><br/>Elimination Mode -- Ten drivers must race against each other until there is only one driver remaining.

It was released on June 30, 2005 in Japan and on February 24, 2006 in Europe. It was also re-released as a Konami Best Hit in Japan on January 26, 2006. The game has not been released in North America.<br/><br/>The game's Japanese title OZ, literally means Over Zenith as shown in the opening sequence of the Japanese version. Its literal definition of &quot;Surpassing the Peak&quot; also explain why the words Over Zenith appears when the &quot;Tension gauge&quot; is maxed out. On the other hand, OZ is also used to refer to the group comprising the three greatest &quot;Katenas&quot; (term is used in all versions of the game).<br/><br/>The story sets off with Cain having visions of unexplainable things. Cain, Leon and Almira fight monsters yet it is unclear of what really is happening.  Fiel (&quot;Feel&quot; in the Japanese version), a boy who lost his parents at an early age, grew up with his younger sister Dorothy together with their cat Toto, dwelling in a world of humans, gods and spiritual creatures called the Katenas. Trying to bring down mankind, the gods have drained the planet of 'Etheria' (its energy source) and taken control of the Katenas.  Later on, a group of Katenas and monsters attacks the village Fiel is living in and kidnaps Dorothy by monsters called &quot;Volo&quot;. Fiel then must save her with the help of two other Katenas, Almira and Leon. Thus, entering the threats present within the grasp of the gods.<br/><br/>In The Sword of Etheria the player controls Fiel as the protagonist where he will be partnered by Almira and Leon, who are both AI-controlled characters but each given their own individual HP gauge. The Sword of Etheria offers a new distinct battle system to the Beat 'em up genre; the player has to perform launch attacks on enemies in order to perform multi-hit aerial combos while the enemy is in thin-air as if juggling them in the air. These combos could be utilized with the aid of Almira and Leon for additional hits.<br/><br/>A 'Tension gauge' is shown in right part of the screen which will be indicating the player's performance with combos. It increases by chaining aerial combos and decreases if a large delay gap is present in-between attacks. In addition to this, a 'Deathblow' could be performed altogether by the party as a final blow to multiple enemies when a 'hint' displays on the screen; as a result, the accumulated points decreases. As the game progresses, the Tension gauge levels up and will be longer, thus given the ability to use more powerful Deathblows. If the gauge reaches Level 3, maxing out the gauge will display &quot;Over Zenith&quot; the strongest Deathblow that could be performed.<br/><br/>The Sword of Etheria focuses deeply in its battle system and storyline which is divided by Chapters and presents anime looking characters. Stages vary from typical forest fields, villages to different kinds of dungeons.<br/><br/>A special/alternate version of Chapter 9 is playable when certain requirements are met. In that chapter, the storyline will be somewhat different and the three main characters will portray some of the The Wonderful Wizard of Oz characters; Fiel as Tin Man, Almira as Scarecrow and Leon as Lion. There is also an additional unlockable story which can be played with Fiel's sister, Dorothy, as the main character.<br/><br/>The game also included a feature of changing the characters' costumes which could be bought in-game.

The first player uses as many or as few cards as needed, (the only rule is each card can only be used once per turn) to create an equation that equals 1. The next player uses the same cards to create an equation for 2 and play continues as high as cards or ability allows. The player that finds the highest consecutive operation wins!<br/><br/>Publisher Blurb:<br/><br/>Albert&rsquo;s Insomnia is a mental math game using math operations, which can be differentiated for all grades, inclusive of K-5, 6-8 and even high school level students (when factorials and exponents are incorporated into the game).  Because Albert&rsquo;s Insomnia is easily differentiated, it provides the teacher or parent with flexibility to adjust the game to each student&rsquo;s level.  A teacher can easily raise or lower the ability level of the game by choosing different numbers with which the student(s) can work.  It allows for individual use, small group and whole class learning experiences.  The game can teach students in small groups and as a whole class to work collaboratively and cooperatively, encouraging team work within the classroom.<br/><br/>Because Albert&rsquo;s Insomnia is a mental math game, it gives students the opportunity to think and solve equations in order to achieve success in the game.  Albert&rsquo;s Insomnia is not a game where students methodically repeat drills in order to learn their math facts.  Students naturally acquire this ability through the different processes needed in order to complete the solutions.  Students are able to first visualize the numerical operation by the number on the face of the card, then by referring to the different operation signs (add, subtract, multiply, divide).  The game can also allow for tactile bodily/kinesthetic engagement as students move the cards or touch the cards while working through their solutions.  Students inherently begin to acquire the knowledge of multiplication and division through their repetitive use of the numbers to consecutively count the sheep in the game.  When students achieve a solution, they reinforce their newly acquired skills and the other students participating in the game also hear the repetition of the mathematical equation, which provides reinforcement of the necessary math skills needed for students to be successful in math.<br/><br/>Albert&rsquo;s Insomnia appeals to students because it is purposely sized to fit in small hands.  It does not have the look or feel of flashcards, allowing students to feel like they are always playing a game instead of doing school or homework.  But because they are instantly and continuously engaged, they are learning while having fun.  The developers purposely designed the game so students never feel as though they are going through math drills, and as students achieve their goals to win the game, the teacher or parent wins because the students have learned and practiced their math facts and order of operations while playing the game.  Even reluctant math students get hooked on Albert&rsquo;s Insomnia because each hand begins very easily, and players are fully involved in &ldquo;playing a game&rdquo; before the more challenging aspects of math kick in.

This is the first Marl Kingdom game for the PlayStation 2. Unlike the previous games in the series, this game was only released once, although a special limited edition version of the game was released concurrently. Instead of the 2D graphics of the other Marl games, Tenshi no Present uses 3D backgrounds. However, the character sprites themselves are kept 2D, much like many other Nippon Ichi games released afterwards.<br/><br/>Tenshi no Present, unlike the earlier games in the series, consists of six separate chapters, each of which features different characters from the Marl Kingdom series.

In each chapter, the player guides different characters through their adventure, engaging in several battles along the way.<br/><br/>The battle system is completely different from earlier Marl games. The player's party consists of up to 12 characters divided into rows of 4. The player can only have direct control of the row leaders. The other characters in each row, called &quot;partners,&quot; cannot normally be controlled and attack randomly. The only characters that can be controlled even when they are not in the front row are puppets, and they can only be controlled by Cornet, Cello, Kururu or Cherie.  The party consists of humans, puppet users, puppets and monsters. Each character, when acting as a partner, will raise or lower the statistics of the row leader. Depending on party organization, special attacks can be unlocked for the row leader.  Instead of paying for spells like in Little Princess, the characters use SP for spell casting.<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;Tenshi no Present - Marl \u014ckoku Monogatari&quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "122224": {"statistics": {}, "name": "Time Traveler (DVD)", "videogamemode": {"2149": "Single-Player"}, "videogameversion": {"159411": "North American DVD edition"}, "average": "0", "videogametheme": {"2267": "Western"}, "usersrated": "0", "videogamegenre": {"2402": "Classic Games"}, "videogameplatform": {"4434": "PlayStation 2"}, "poll": {}, "description": "Time Traveler or Hologram Time Traveler was a stereographic laserdisc FMV arcade game released in 1991 by Sega and designed by Dragon's Lair creator Rick Dyer. It is called the &quot;World's First Holographic Video Game&quot; because it uses a special arcade cabinet that projects the game's characters. The holographic effect is an optical illusion using a huge curved mirror and a CRT television set.<br/><br/>In 2001, a non-stereographic version was published by Digital Leisure in PC CD-ROM and standard DVD formats. Both versions suffer greatly from missing the mirror equipment the game is designed to be played with. These home versions try to simulate the mirror reflection of the original arcade cabinet through a pair of 3D glasses but it's nowhere near the same effect as the original arcade. Compounded with a lack of proper controls and FMV's decline from popularity many years before, the game loses most of its appeal with today's modern gamer.<br/><br/>As with other Digital Leisure DVD releases, the game's box advertises being &quot;Playstation 2 [or Xbox] Compatible&quot; on the cover to attract console owners. Bonus features include interviews with creator Rick Dyer about the making of Time Traveler, as well as some of the actors in the game. It also shows behind the scenes footage from some of the scenes without the special effects.<br/><br/>The DVD version lacks the mirror equipment used by the arcade version to achieve its volumetric display. Instead, it includes a pair of stereostopic 3D glasses as well as an alternate game video that adds a whirlpool-like moving background to provide an illusory stereoscopic effect.<br/><br/>To simulate the actual props that were part of the arcade machine, the DVD version of Time Traveler has pre-rendered geometrical shapes inserted to the video. It also incorporates a grid-like background which was not present in the original.<br/>    The arcade version has separate buttons for action and time reversal commands, whereas the DVD uses the same button for both.<br/>    In the DVD version, time reversal cubes are free. In the arcade version the player has to insert more coins.<br/>    The DVD version uses a default of 5 starting lives, whereas in the arcade version the number depended on internal settings of the arcade system.<br/>    The arcade version uses an LCD alphanumeric display to show game information like score, lives left, etc. The DVD version doesn't keep track of score, but does so for lives and time reversal cubes and shows the player's remaining lives in a still frame between levels.<br/>    Since DVD remotes are not designed for the fast input video games require, the game's responsiveness wildly varies depending on the DVD hardware used to play it.<br/>    The DVD version superimposes symbols which represent the action read by the remote and signals the player when to enter the next move. The real arcade game does not do this.<br/>    The time frame for player response in the DVD version of the game is often out of sync with sequences of the video game. The original game footage gives visual cues that prompt the player's next move. The lack of sync allows insufficient time for the player to respond; the fault occurs just before the cues appear on the screen. By that time, it is too late for the player to successfully complete the move. The original arcade game does not suffer from this issue.<br/>    The arcade applies sound beeps of different tones if a right or wrong action is selected, a standard feature in most laserdisc games. The DVD version does not.<br/>    Vulcor's &quot;Hellgate&quot; mini game plays considerably more frequently in the DVD port. In the arcade version this video sequence does not appear during the beginning levels and it doesn't play as often meaning a player could complete consecutive levels without watching this sequence. In the DVD version, Vulcor's game of chance shows up early on and plays almost every time a player finishes a level.<br/>    The DVD version has a programming bug that allows the player to skip directly to higher levels.<br/>    The arcade version has two easter eggs: Pressing both game buttons while pressing down on the joystick with a credit on the machine shows Rick Dyer dancing around with his son on his back. Doing the same procedure while pressing up on the joystick shows the game's development team.<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;Time Traveler (video game)&quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "122225": {"statistics": {}, "name": "Tiny Toon Adventures: Defenders of the Universe", "videogamemode": {"2149": "Single-Player"}, "videogameversion": {"159416": "North American PlayStation 2 edition"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2480576.png", "videogametheme": {"2319": "Cartoon"}, "videogamegenre": {"2164": "Platform"}, "average": "0", "videogamefranchise": {"16620": "(Unreleased Games - Cancelled)"}, "videogameplatform": {"4434": "PlayStation 2"}, "usersrated": "0", "poll": {}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2480576_t.png", "description": "<br/><br/><br/>    <br/>        <br/>UNRELEASED GAME - CANCELLED<br/><br/>    <br/>    <br/>        <br/>This game was cancelled in development. Please only submit images if you own a copy or have legal access to this item.<br/><br/>    <br/><br/><br/>Tiny Toon Adventures: Defenders of the Universe is the name of an unreleased Tiny Toon Adventures video game initially scheduled for release in 2001. Development is believed to have ceased in 2002, and the game to have been canceled, although its publisher denied this for years. Developed by a Japanese video game studio, Treasure, it was originally slated for the PlayStation 2.<br/><br/>On a planet made almost entirely out of gold located in the Jewel system, live the Bullions. They have lived there peacefully for many years, until their home was attacked by the Drizzletroopers. Two of them manage to escape, Zig and Zag, to the planet earth. The Leader of the Drizzletroopers learns of this and has someone go after the two. As morning comes by, Buster Bunny and the gang attend school. However, a strange robot, disguised as Bugs Bunny, appears in their class rather than their teacher.<br/><br/>When his disguise is blown, the group chase after the fleeing robot. After stopping the robot from getting away, he makes an attempt to kill everyone, but ultimately fails, leaving a hole in the ground. There, zig and zag appear out of the hole, startling the group. The strange creatures explains their situation and the group agrees to help them.<br/><br/>However, Shirley appears telling the group a great danger will fall upon the earth if they help them. Despite her warning, the group decides to help the creatures out. They all enter the hole into the ground, leading them into yet another new adventure...<br/><br/>Exact reasons for the game's cancellation remain unknown, but are generally believed to be unrelated to the state of the product itself. Publisher Conspiracy Entertainment was in dire financial shape at the time and several other projects of theirs quietly disappeared during this same time. They cited unspecified &quot;business complications&quot; for the extended hold up. Their previous partnership with Treasure, Tiny Toons: Scary Dreams was manufactured in 2002, but its existence could not be confirmed until it appeared on eBay in 2005. Defenders of the Universe was evaluated by the ESRB, which some take as evidence that the game was in a near-final state.<br/><br/>The game's original official website, <a target='_blank' href='http://www.dotu.net' rel='nofollow'>www.dotu.net</a>, no longer exists. Tetsuhiko Kikuchi (aka Han), the director of the game, has hinted on his homepage (Japanese) that the game &quot;will forever go unreleased.&quot;<br/><br/>On February 25, 2009, an image of a prototype of the game was released by a member of the internet forum, Lost Levels.

The players journey together along the road, but vie for valor and the recognition of their peers.<br/><br/>Journey's End uses a system of skills collected from different decks, each represented by the back of a card.  Meanwhile, the card fronts represent locations along the road traveled, detailing the Quests, Places, and Events the adventurers encounter.  Only a portion of these cards are used each game, providing Journey's End with a multitude of game scenarios.<br/><br/>The game hinges on how players allocate their skills during each round of play.  Chief among them are several types of bidding wars, where the adventurer who shows the most skill can complete a Quest or take advantage of an Event.  Players who feel like they're falling behind can gain new skills or compete over the game's namesake, the Journey's End card.  Ultimately, the adventurer with the most Valor at the end of the game can claim victory.<br/><br/>Journey's End provides the genesis of play popular in a deck-builder, but dispenses with the solitary nature of these games.  With healthy doses of resource management, bidding, and planning, players can enjoy a quick game with all the complexities of larger and longer games.<br/><br/>"}, "122227": {"statistics": {}, "name": "Moxie 2", "videogamemode": {"2149": "Single-Player"}, "videogameversion": {"159436": "iPad edition"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1262684.png", "videogametheme": {"2564": "Words"}, "usersrated": "0", "average": "0", "videogamegenre": {"2165": "Puzzle"}, "videogameplatform": {"6826": "iPad"}, "poll": {}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1262684_t.png", "description": "&quot;First of all, it's a word game that's DIFFERENT from anything else you'll find on the iPhone App Store, and that's by design.

This is speed role-playing and provides a low-prep complete pulp adventure that can be finished in a single session. The basic set up is this: a group of explorers in the late 19th or early 20th century have found an ancient pyramid and opened it to plunder it of its treasure &amp; secrets. As players, you mainly take on the role of the explorers as they make their way to the Pharaoh&rsquo;s Chamber where the greatest finds are kept, but you also take turns at playing the pyramid. This is a GM-less game, so it&rsquo;s up to the players to determine what happens as they explore.<br/><br/>To play, everyone will need a Play Sheet and a pencil; as a group, you will need a very large pool of six-sided dice to draw from throughout the game. It helps if you have at least two different colours of dice; yellow can serve for exploring and Egyptology rolls, white dice can be used for everything else. You&rsquo;ll also need some sort of marker to represent the Curse of the Pharaoh (a hat is a good choice, especially a homemade, silly or ostentatious one), a pool of counters for Hits and Dashes and a copy of the game sheet with the results of various die rolls on it.<br/><br/>"}, "122263": {"statistics": {}, "name": "Tokyo Xtreme Racer Zero", "videogamemode": {"2422": "Local Multiplayer"}, "videogameversion": {"159495": "English/European PlayStation 2 edition"}, "average": "0", "videogameseries": {"17843": "Tokyo Xtreme Racer"}, "videogametheme": {"2456": "Driving"}, "usersrated": "0", "videogamegenre": {"2154": "Racing"}, "videogameplatform": {"4434": "PlayStation 2"}, "poll": {}, "description": "Tokyo Xtreme Racer Zero is an 'interquel' between Tokyo Xtreme Racer 2 and Tokyo Xtreme Racer: Drift, and has enhanced sound and graphics.

However, have no fear, many of the creatures within are easily adaptable to a multiple of genres and settings, and many include notes describing how to do just that.<br/><br/>Here Be Dragons includes:       <br/>- Over 40 fantastical and mundane animals, beasts, and monsters.        <br/>- A brief history of the medieval bestiary, complete with titles and authors        <br/>- A description of the medieval view of the world        <br/>- An extensive list of animal folklore, including common myths about both domestic and wild animals        <br/>- Several unique creatures, including Grendel, the Lambton Worm, the Shaggy Beast, and more!<br/><br/>If you're running a fantasy campaign, or just want a new look at old monsters, Here Be Dragons is the book for you!<br/><br/>"}, "122281": {"boardgamedesigner": {"3": {"name": "(Uncredited)"}}, "poll": {}, "name": "Rummy", "playingtime": "60", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": {"2014": "Betting/Wagering"}, "yearpublished": "1979", "usersrated": "2", "boardgamefamily": {"2250": "Rummy Games"}, "maxplayers": "8", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1265703_t.jpg", "average": "6", "statistics": {}, "boardgamepublisher": {"1964": {"name": "Stancraft Products"}}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1265703.jpg", "boardgameversion": {"159519": "First edition"}, "maxplaytime": "60", "boardgamecategory": {"1002": {"name": "Card Game"}}, "age": "0", "minplaytime": "60", "description": "This game is not like the normal Rummy family of card games.

Play proceeds in a sequencing style with each player in turn playing a card from low to high in suit. When players cannot follow suit because of the missing cards from the dummy hand, a new suit is played. When a player runs out of cards he wins the chips in the Kitty section of the layout.

Each mushroom card has two values: one for selling and one for cooking. Selling two or more like mushrooms grants foraging sticks that expand your options in the forest (that is, the running tableau of eight face-up cards on the table), enabling offensive or defensive plays that change with every game played. Cooking sets of three or more like mushrooms &ndash; sizzling in butter or cider if the set is large enough &ndash; earns points toward winning the game. With poisonous mushrooms wielding their wrath and a hand-size limit to manage, card selection is a tricky proposition at every turn.<br/><br/>Following each turn, one card from the forest moves into a decay pile that is available for only a short time.

Tribal warriors enter combat in powered armor, relying on skill and bravery to win glory. BioDerm Hordes have started to invade tribal space. Though the tribes boast of being the finest warriors humanity has ever produced, they face a genetically modified race that has literally bred itself for battle. The stakes are epic, and the Wilderzone is aflame with a new kind of war.<br/><br/>The player controls J.Ransom, a recently-recruited newblood. After a training segment, the story follows J. Ransom through missions to fight off the BioDerm horde and keep control of tribal space.<br/><br/>Tribes Aerial Assault is a first-person shooter game with an emphasis on mobility. While still employing the classic &quot;kill the bad guys&quot; routine, there are many game types in the single-player campaign and multi-player. These include capture the flag (CTF), capture and hold, hunter, team deathmatch, and deathmatch. Campaign usually consists of some mixture of these game types.<br/><br/>In all games but hunters and deathmatch, there are team and player points. Depending on the game style, team and player points can reflect two completely different things. Player points are usually earned through an individual player's accomplishments that help the team as a whole. Player points are earned by setting and deploying equipment, repairing friendly assets, destroying enemy assets, defending friendly assets, and completing objectives of the game.<br/><br/>Modes of Gameplay:<br/>    Capture The Flag: Both teams have a flag, and the objective is to capture the other teams flag. The &quot;runner&quot; is unencumbered by the flag, that is; he/she can still use weapons and grenades freely and without debilitation. After either team has captured the flag 8 times, or the time limit runs out, the game is over and the team with the most points wins.    In CTF, team points reflect how many times a team has captured, or attempted to capture the flag. Trying to capture the flag, but dying before reaching the base, gives the player's team one point. Successfully getting the enemy flag to one's own base rewards the player team a hundred points.<br/>    Capture and hold: This is an asset-guarding game. Usually there are four buildings or bases scattered over the whole map. Inside each of these is a switch. The objective is to touch the switch in any building and try to prevent the enemy team from doing the same for as long as possible. For every second that a base is held, that team gets one point. When the time runs out, the team with the most team points wins.<br/>    Hunter: A survival-based game. The objective is to kill as many people as possible and collect the flags that they drop, and then try to bring those flags back to a central &quot;nexus&quot; for points. There are no teams in Hunter, so everyone is an enemy. If someone drops more than five flags, everyone in the game is alerted as to who has the flags and who dropped them.<br/>    Team Deathmatch: Two teams duke it out until time runs out. 1 kill = 1 point. The team with the most points when time runs out wins.<br/>    Deathmatch: No teams, few rules, kill or be killed. The person with the most points at time-out wins.<br/><br/>Like most first-person shooters, TAA has a Heads Up Display (HUD). The HUD consists of a crosshair, health, energy reserve, grenades and grenade type, pack type, armor heat, lock-on detection, and vehicle condition. The HUD also has target identification, that is, a red arrow over the target is an enemy, a green arrow is a friend. A somewhat unique feature of TAA is the jetpack feature. The jetpack runs on armor energy and allows players to fly for short to medium distances.<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;Tribes: Aerial Assault&quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>This game's internet connection ability probably no longer works.<br/><br/>"}, "122321": {"statistics": {}, "name": "Twinkle Star Sprites: La Petite Princesse", "videogamemode": {"2422": "Local Multiplayer"}, "videogameversion": {"159605": "Japanese PlayStation 2 edition"}, "average": "7.5", "videogametheme": {"2278": "Anime"}, "usersrated": "1", "videogamegenre": {"2505": "Shoot 'em Up"}, "videogameplatform": {"4434": "PlayStation 2"}, "poll": {}, "description": "At E3 2005, an SNK-published sequel titled Twinkle Star Sprites - La Petite Princesse (\u30c6\u30a3\u30f3\u30af\u30eb\u30b9\u30bf\u30fc\u30b9\u30d7\u30e9\u30a4\u30c4 \uff5eLa Petite Princesse\uff5e) was shown at the SNK Booth.

The Master of the Oboro school of shinobi sends his best students to investigate the horrible tales coming from the suburban areas. They return with news of a powerful dark force that has established a base within Neo City.<br/><br/>The Master knows that only a warrior trained in the arts of ninjutsu can stand against this menace. One by one his greatest pupils enter Neo City to locate and destroy the source of the evil. Ninja Valley has lost contact with each of them. All are believed to be captured.<br/><br/>It is now up to Joe Musashi, the Red Shinobi, to carry through this dire mission. As the oldest and strongest of his ninja disciples, Musashi must use his special skills in the art of ninjutsu to free his fellow shinobi. With their combined strength, they can destroy the City of Fear.<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;The G.G.

The year is 1935 and the main characters are some of the lesser movers and shakers trying to get by: talent agents, screen-writers, club owners, musical directors and studio muscle. Never anyone who appears on the silver screen though, as that would attract too much attention, because really the characters are exiles from a land of enchanted beings. Call them elves, fairies, spirits or whatever you like, it doesn&rsquo;t matter anymore, because they gave up that heritage. In a world of childlike simplicity, they allowed dark &amp; complex emotions to enter their hearts; when faced with the prospect of being purged of this state and returned to innocence, they just couldn&rsquo;t let go of what they&rsquo;d become, despite the great pain it caused them. The only other choice open to them was to forswear their true nature and leave the Shining Realm forever, to live out the remainder of their existence as a mortal.<br/><br/>Los Angeles is a city of secret exiles, a home to the few dozen who have known a better world where everything that was dreamed became possible. These outcasts are addicts, enslaved by their own need to feel something terrible and painful; even the remorse that wracks them over leaving their home feeds their need for suffering. It&rsquo;s a vicious circle they can never break out of, except... there is a pale imitation of glamour in this city, like the echo of a song heard through a separating wall. It can never be what they had in the Shining Realm, but maybe one day, if it is nurtured carefully, it can lead them home.<br/><br/>From publisher blurb:<br/><br/>This is the same game as the Game Chef Edition, but with over double the word count, it has more room for examples of what to do and how to play.

You probably won&rsquo;t though and so, as an overprivileged parasite born into a society that has supported others like you for generations, you turn to meaningless distractions to fill your days. Hanging over all though is the family Curse: the origins of the Curse (Kerrack! Boom!) are lost to legend, but its power is manifest everywhere. Nobles within the House are doomed to unhappiness, losing the things they love and being swallowed up by the things they loathe. Serfs who become involved with nobles die in tragic circumstances. Even in death, many of the family line cannot escape, being doomed to become some form of unnatural, undead creature until they have severed the bonds tying them to this world. The only way to escape this dread destiny is to surrender all your rights as a member of the Line of Wretchwick and depart the House forever, but to do so you will need to find enough inner strength to believe that you can make a life for yourself outside the House.<br/><br/>"}, "122415": {"rpg": {"524": "d20 System / OGL Product (D&D 3.5 Compatible)"}, "statistics": {}, "name": "Monsters of the True World: Maztica and Lopango", "rpgproducer": {"59243": "Jon \"Seethyr\" Hild"}, "usersrated": "0", "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1265730.jpg", "rpgitemversion": {"159793": "PDF Version"}, "rpgsetting": {"196": "Forgotten Realms"}, "average": "0", "rpggenre": {"155": "Fantasy (High Fantasy)"}, "rpgcategory": {"2108": "Sourcebook (rules/options to enhance play)"}, "poll": {}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1265730_t.jpg", "description": "From the Intro:<br/><br/>&ldquo;Zaltec looked upon the corpse of his murdered mother and saw a land ripe for the taking.

The candidates definitely do&hellip; and so they start with a war chest of funds ranging from $4 million to $10 million. Once used, the funds are gone till the next round of seven regions. So candidates must choose where to use how much carefully. They can also choose to stay out of the race in a region and instead use the funds to Dig for Dirt on the competition.<br/><br/>Each of the regions have their preferences for what kind of candidates they like, so if your attributes match that of a region, your funds go further, and vice versa. But once the campaign funds are spent the outcome is not guaranteed for the leader in spending. That&rsquo;s when the Media Frenzy begins! Candidates can now play to the Media and either bring-out Support or Protest Rallies, they can use the dirt they collected and expose Scandals about the competition. Each media event can make your spending go further or not so much.<br/><br/>Candidates must be careful not to indulge the media too much, because if more than one person is spending at the same level, the fickle crowd tunes them out, and the highest unique spender win the delegates.<br/><br/>We hope you have the support of your base, you have the fortitude to let a few protests roll off your back, and you don&rsquo;t have too many scandals in your past.

For both series, the games are the fourth installments made for the Game Boy Advance. The story of the games center on a plot to wreak havoc on the universe by the main antagonists Doctor Neo Cortex and Ripto, who have recently joined forces. The protagonists of the story, Crash Bandicoot and Spyro the Dragon, must team up and defeat Doctor Cortex and Ripto along with their genetically modified minions.<br/><br/>Crash Bandicoot Purple: Ripto's Rampage and Spyro Orange: The Cortex Conspiracy are single-player side-scrolling adventure games in which the player controls Crash Bandicoot and Spyro the Dragon in the respective games.[3] While the games feature platforming elements that allow Crash and Spyro to navigate different areas, the main focus is on a series of minigames that make up the core of the gameplay. The minigames involve distinctively different gameplay elements, such as destroying enemies in a Breakout-inspired challenge or racing through an area with a jet pack, tank or inner tube. The games make use of the Game Link Cable, allowing players to compete in multiplayer versions of several of the minigames found in the games. Much of these minigames only require one copy of either of the games for as many as four players in the network. Players can earn trading cards by performing specific tasks; these cards can be traded between Game Boy Advance systems to players who do not physically own a copy of the games.

This is designed to be played as a quick pick-up or filler game, not an on-going campaign or series of linked sessions (though you could do that if you like). The rules are very simple and easy to learn, the game itself being playable in a couple of hours, depending on the size of your group. Each game begins with the Heroes being taken to task for their failure to successfully complete a quest; the players then pass the buck for that failure around the table by creating incidents where one Hero was responsible for the outcome of that scene, for good or bad. This continues until any Hero has run out of excuses to use, at which point one player is named as the scapegoat for their misadventures and one other is the champion who gets to pronounce their punishment. In order to play, you will need copies of the character sheets to be found at the end of this book, pencils &amp; erasers for making notes, a set of poker chips, beads or other tokens to use as action chips and lots of dice, ranging from six- to twelve-sided.<br/><br/>In When Bad Things Happen to Good Magicians, or WBT for short, one player takes on the role of game moderator, known generically as the GM but specifically in this game also known as the Magistrate. It is the GM&rsquo;s job to be familiar with the rules and apply them appropriately within the game; they also get to start the game off with an opening scene and prod the other players into action by adding detail to what occurs. In addition to the GM, there must be four or more other players, each of whom plays a Hero; unlike other games, Heroes in WBT have completely pre-generated statistics and abilities, so all you do is add a name and a description of them. There are eight Heroes to choose from in this rulebook, each of whom should be regarded as being a bit of a failure, since true heroes are in short supply at this time.<br/><br/>"}, "122494": {"statistics": {}, "name": "SEGA Golf Club", "videogamemode": {"2422": "Local Multiplayer"}, "videogameversion": {"159960": "Japanese PlayStation 3 edition"}, "average": "0", "videogametheme": {"2366": "Sports - Golf"}, "usersrated": "0", "videogamegenre": {"2157": "Sports"}, "videogameplatform": {"4435": "PlayStation 3"}, "poll": {}, "description": "Miyasato Miyoshi Kyoudai Naizou: Sega Golf Club (\u5bae\u91cc\u4e09\u5144\u5f1f\u5185\u8535 SEGA GOLFCLUB?)
