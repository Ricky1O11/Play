It features a huge walled city that is ruled by the eponymous (lawful evil) Overlord and the surrounding environs that are full of adventure possibilities.  What was so striking at the time that it was first released was the incredible level of detail that the product contains.  Hundreds of streets are mapped, named, and populated with shops, temples, inns, taverns, brothels, houses, barracks, and the like.  Hundreds of NPCs are listed along with their stats and rumors they knew (for starting adventures).  The history and political system of the City State is described along with relevant laws the PC's must abide by while inside the city.  It includes dungeon levels beneath the City State and detailed information for nearby adventure / dungeon sites: the dwarven fortress &quot;Thunderhold&quot; and the &quot;Sunstone Caverns&quot;.<br/><br/>The City State was designed for Dungeons & Dragons (Original Edition) but was not officially licensed for D&amp;D until 1978.  The license ended in 1983.  It was printed many times over the life of Judges Guild and changed in size and configuration in subsequent editions.<br/><br/>FIRST EDITION<br/>The first edition was spread out across several different publications / releases throughout 1976:<br/><br/>     City State Map: A 34&quot; x 44&quot; map of the City State<br/>     Guidelines Booklet I: A 16-page booklet with charts, rules and background data for the City State such as NPCs, crimes and trials, etc.<br/>     City State Player's Map: A 17&quot; x 22&quot; map of the City State (originally printed on four 8.5&quot; x 11&quot; sheets) that was blank inside for players to fill in details as they explored the city<br/>     Dungeon Level Maps I 1-5: Five dungeon levels beneath the City State<br/>     Guide to the City State: A 56-page booklet detailing hundreds of shopkeepers and other NPC's, background information, special buildings, and additional rules for running campaigns in the City State <br/>     Thunderhold &amp; Sunstone Caverns Maps: 11&quot; x 17&quot; map with the dwarven fortress on one side and the caverns on the other<br/>     Guidelines Booklet J: A 12-page booklet with additional charts, rules and background data for Thunderhold and Sunstone Caverns<br/>     Dungeon Level Maps J: Four dungeon levels beneath Thunderhold<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>In 1977 the above items were bundled together into one package with a cover sheet entitled City State of the Invincible Overlord.<br/><br/>REVISED EDITION<br/>In 1978, Judges Guild compiled and edited all of the information from the various booklets into one 80-page book and released it as a &quot;Revised Edition&quot;.  Included in this release were two 22.5&quot; x 28.5&quot; maps of the City State (judge, player), an 11&quot; x 17&quot; judge's map of Thunderhold/Sunstone Caverns, and an 8.5&quot; x 11&quot; player's map of Thunderhold/Sunstone Caverns.  This configuration was reprinted, potentially with minor edits, in 1979 and 1980.<br/><br/><br/>     In 1981 the Thunderhold/Sunstone Cavern maps were incorporated into main book, which grew to 96 pages to incorporate a new layout and illustrations.<br/>     In 1983 the cover was changed to remove the &quot;Approved for use with Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; claim.<br/>     In 1999 the product was reprinted, identical to the 1981/1983 printings, but with a blue cover and updated &quot;Booty List&quot; (product listing) in the back.<br/><br/><br/>The setting was revised in 1987 by Mayfair Games as part of their Role Aids line (City-State of the Invincible Overlord (Mayfair)).  It was further revised and updated to d20 rules by Necromancer Games in 2004.<br/><br/>"}, "49217": {"rpgartist": ["Jeff Easley", "Dave LaForce"], "rpgitemversion": ["FR3: Die W\u00fcstenreiche", "Soft Cover", "WotC PDF version"], "rpgseries": ["FR - Forgotten Realms"], "name": "Empires of the Sands", "rpgdesigner": ["Scott Haring"], "rpgproducer": ["Karen S.

Not for dinner, mind you, but to sell to markets for a grand haul. In order to make the most for your efforts, you want to concentrate on those crabs grouped together in large sets. Otherwise you're piddling away time spent chasing individual crabs, which is hardly worth the bother. The fishermen who nets the most valuable haul wins the game.<br/><br/>Set-up in Kraby differs depending on the number of players, with 80 or 120 tiles in play, the game board being 9x9 or 11x11, and the number of colored crab figures being 10, 12 or 15. Each player starts by secretly drawing six crab tiles (which come in four colors with two players and five colors otherwise) and placing them behind their screen. On a turn, a player chooses one tile and enters it from any side of the game board, sliding it in the row or column until it hits the island at the center of the board or another tile in play. (A move that would slide a tile off the board or create an impossible-to-fill space is illegal.) The player then draws a new tile and places it behind his screen.<br/><br/>A player then has the option of placing one of the colored crab figures in his ship's hold. Each ship has three holds, with a scoring multiplier of x1, x2 or x3. A player can claim a color only once and cannot place it on the same multipler as another player. In a four-player game, a player can claim only two figures.)<br/><br/>The game ends once the final tile has been placed and the game board filled. Each group of crabs in the same color, with orthogonally adjacent crabs belonging to the same group, is worth -1 to 5 points depending on its size. Once the value of a color is determined, each player scoring this color multiplies this value &ndash; which might be negative &ndash; by the multipliers showing on his ship's hold.

Xtreme Takeover is a two-player game in which each player starts with an identical team of one general, three officers and five guards in his own compound. On a turn, a player moves one or more of his figures based on the roll of the die, splitting up the movement points as desired; alternatively, a player can select an officer or general before rolling, thereby allowing him to move that figure (and no others) twice or three times the number rolled.<br/><br/>If a player&rsquo;s figure lands adjacent to an opponent&rsquo;s, the players each roll a die to see which figure is sent to the sidelines, with officers receiving a +2 battle bonus and generals receiving +3. By reaching promotion zones on the board, you can upgrade figures by one rank, making them more powerful in battle.<br/><br/>Permanent and temporary safety zones provide some cover as you move figures around the board.

Many of the children were twisted and deformed. Mutants. Out of this situation, the paranoid and hateful rose to power by using force and lies to terrify the confused. As the years passed on, those mutants who did not die in their youth were growing to maturity. The Second Republic, the subtly cruel post-Plague government in what was once the United States of America, publicly divided the mutants into two groups: the Acceptables, those with only minor deformities; and the Mutazoids, creatures of barely human appearance. There is also a third group whose existence is officially denied by the Second Republic, sometimes called Supers, who resemble normal humans but have extraordinary powers.<br/><br/>The Acceptables are the majority of the population and they must be controlled. The Mutazoids are wild beasts to be herded or eliminated. To some people the argument seems reasonable. These mutants are infected with the Plague; they should be quarantined!
