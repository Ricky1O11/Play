Hundreds of NPCs are listed along with their stats and rumors they knew (for starting adventures).  The history and political system of the City State is described along with relevant laws the PC's must abide by while inside the city.  It includes dungeon levels beneath the City State and detailed information for nearby adventure / dungeon sites: the dwarven fortress &quot;Thunderhold&quot; and the &quot;Sunstone Caverns&quot;.<br/><br/>The City State was designed for Dungeons & Dragons (Original Edition) but was not officially licensed for D&amp;D until 1978.  The license ended in 1983.  It was printed many times over the life of Judges Guild and changed in size and configuration in subsequent editions.<br/><br/>FIRST EDITION<br/>The first edition was spread out across several different publications / releases throughout 1976:<br/><br/>     City State Map: A 34&quot; x 44&quot; map of the City State<br/>     Guidelines Booklet I: A 16-page booklet with charts, rules and background data for the City State such as NPCs, crimes and trials, etc.<br/>     City State Player's Map: A 17&quot; x 22&quot; map of the City State (originally printed on four 8.5&quot; x 11&quot; sheets) that was blank inside for players to fill in details as they explored the city<br/>     Dungeon Level Maps I 1-5: Five dungeon levels beneath the City State<br/>     Guide to the City State: A 56-page booklet detailing hundreds of shopkeepers and other NPC's, background information, special buildings, and additional rules for running campaigns in the City State <br/>     Thunderhold &amp; Sunstone Caverns Maps: 11&quot; x 17&quot; map with the dwarven fortress on one side and the caverns on the other<br/>     Guidelines Booklet J: A 12-page booklet with additional charts, rules and background data for Thunderhold and Sunstone Caverns<br/>     Dungeon Level Maps J: Four dungeon levels beneath Thunderhold<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>In 1977 the above items were bundled together into one package with a cover sheet entitled City State of the Invincible Overlord.<br/><br/>REVISED EDITION<br/>In 1978, Judges Guild compiled and edited all of the information from the various booklets into one 80-page book and released it as a &quot;Revised Edition&quot;.  Included in this release were two 22.5&quot; x 28.5&quot; maps of the City State (judge, player), an 11&quot; x 17&quot; judge's map of Thunderhold/Sunstone Caverns, and an 8.5&quot; x 11&quot; player's map of Thunderhold/Sunstone Caverns.  This configuration was reprinted, potentially with minor edits, in 1979 and 1980.<br/><br/><br/>     In 1981 the Thunderhold/Sunstone Cavern maps were incorporated into main book, which grew to 96 pages to incorporate a new layout and illustrations.<br/>     In 1983 the cover was changed to remove the &quot;Approved for use with Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; claim.<br/>     In 1999 the product was reprinted, identical to the 1981/1983 printings, but with a blue cover and updated &quot;Booty List&quot; (product listing) in the back.<br/><br/><br/>The setting was revised in 1987 by Mayfair Games as part of their Role Aids line (City-State of the Invincible Overlord (Mayfair)).  It was further revised and updated to d20 rules by Necromancer Games in 2004.<br/><br/>"}, "49217": {"rpgitemversion": {"19698": "FR3: Die W\u00fcstenreiche"}, "rpgseries": {"1118": "FR - Forgotten Realms"}, "name": "Empires of the Sands", "rpgproducer": {"16236": "Karen S.

Not for dinner, mind you, but to sell to markets for a grand haul. In order to make the most for your efforts, you want to concentrate on those crabs grouped together in large sets. Otherwise you're piddling away time spent chasing individual crabs, which is hardly worth the bother. The fishermen who nets the most valuable haul wins the game.<br/><br/>Set-up in Kraby differs depending on the number of players, with 80 or 120 tiles in play, the game board being 9x9 or 11x11, and the number of colored crab figures being 10, 12 or 15. Each player starts by secretly drawing six crab tiles (which come in four colors with two players and five colors otherwise) and placing them behind their screen. On a turn, a player chooses one tile and enters it from any side of the game board, sliding it in the row or column until it hits the island at the center of the board or another tile in play. (A move that would slide a tile off the board or create an impossible-to-fill space is illegal.) The player then draws a new tile and places it behind his screen.<br/><br/>A player then has the option of placing one of the colored crab figures in his ship's hold. Each ship has three holds, with a scoring multiplier of x1, x2 or x3. A player can claim a color only once and cannot place it on the same multipler as another player. In a four-player game, a player can claim only two figures.)<br/><br/>The game ends once the final tile has been placed and the game board filled. Each group of crabs in the same color, with orthogonally adjacent crabs belonging to the same group, is worth -1 to 5 points depending on its size. Once the value of a color is determined, each player scoring this color multiplies this value &ndash; which might be negative &ndash; by the multipliers showing on his ship's hold. The player with the highest score wins.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": {"143220": "Granna / Red Glove edition"}, "average": "6.1909", "name": "Kraby", "playingtime": "30", "boardgamemechanic": {"2043": "Area Enclosure"}, "age": "7", "usersrated": "178", "boardgamesubdomain": {"4666": "Abstract Games"}, "boardgamefamily": {"17635": "Animals: Crabs"}}, "49262": {"rpgitemversion": {"5030": "Saddle Stapled (modules/pamphlets)"}, "poll": {}, "name": "Chilling Tales", "rpgproducer": {"16299": "Peggy Cooper"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic518471.jpg", "usersrated": "8", "rpgsetting": {"534": "Ravenloft"}, "average": "6.1875", "statistics": {}, "rpg": {"244": "Advanced Dungeons & Dragons (2nd Edition)"}, "rpgcategory": {"2084": "Scenario / Adventure / Module"}, "rpggenre": {"1013": "Fantasy (Sword & Sorcery)"}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic518471_t.jpg", "description": "From the Back of the Book:<br/><br/>Seven GRIPPING SETTINGS....<br/><br/><br/>     Haunted graveyards, manors, and tombs, a bardic library with an unexpected room, ancient catacombs, and an entire town turned to dark terror.<br/><br/><br/>Seven TERRIFYING CHARACTERS....<br/><br/><br/>     Deadly and unexpected foes: a vampire who walks in the sun and laughs at clerics, a mummy whose touch turn living flesh water, and a fearsome host of others: a darkling, a vassalich, a ghost, fiends, golems, a graveyard elemental, and a mad scientist.<br/><br/><br/>Seven NIGHTMARISH ADVENTURES....<br/><br/><br/>     Doctor Rudolph van Richten, author of the learned Van Richten's Guides, summons player characters from levels 3 to 9 to wipe out the evils that haunt Ravenloft.<br/><br/><br/>Thrill your players with these seven<br/><br/>Chilling Tales<br/><br/>"}, "49263": {"rpgitemversion": {"5031": "Saddle Stapled (modules/pamphlets)"}, "rpgseries": {"16856": "Terra Nova Field Guides"}, "name": "Field Guide North 1", "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic641298.jpg", "usersrated": "3", "rpgsetting": {"6133": "Terra Nova"}, "average": "7", "statistics": {}, "rpg": {"1179": "Heavy Gear (1st & 2nd Editions)"}, "poll": {}, "rpgcategory": {"2086": "Accessory (dice, maps, screens, cards)"}, "rpggenre": {"3712": "Mecha"}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic641298_t.jpg", "description": "The Terra Nova Field Guides series showcases the most common pieces of equipment used by the armies of the 62nd century.

Add to this mixture Captain Carnage and Ms. Missile (a pair of well-meaning but inept super heroes), a band of ruthless but fashionable space pirates, and one of the sorriest excuses for a Jihad ever, and blend thoroughly.<br/><br/>This Tales From The Floating Vagabond Supplement includes:<br/><br/>    The star-spanning adventure Bar Wars.<br/>    Super Hero Rules, so players can have powers far beyond those of mortal men.<br/>    Cybernetics Rules, so players can replace their favorite body parts.<br/>    Bar-room Brawl Rules, so players can beat up each other.<br/>    A big, two sided, full-color map with The Floating Vagabond on one side and the Crane's Nest on the other.<br/>    A bunch of full color, stand-up figures to use with the brawling rules and to scatter across your bedroom floor.<br/>    More rules!<br/>    And... in a few special copies... a free, assembly required, W.A.R.P. Random Dimensional Portal Generator (while supplies last).<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>"}, "49399": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic851825.jpg", "is_expanded_by": {"187859": {"name": "Battleground Fantasy Warfare: Undead Army Reinforcements"}}, "poll": {}, "boardgamedesigner": {"4113": {"name": "Robert Dougherty"}}, "statistics": {}, "yearpublished": "2005", "maxplayers": "2", "boardgameartist": {"12177": "Richard Kitner, Jr."}, "boardgamepublisher": {"2913": {"name": "Your Move Games"}}, "boardgameintegration": {"18985": "Battleground"}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic851825_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "60", "boardgamecategory": {"1002": {"name": "Card Game"}}, "description": "Not playable on their own as you need two starter decks to play the game.<br/><br/>Battleground Fantasy Warfare is a point-based tabletop tactical wargame in which units are represented by cards.<br/><br/>As a dark necromancer you control a horrifying undead army.

The roads south to the Lands of Intrigue are long and dusty indeed, but they are roads to greatness and glory for merchants, adventurers, and scholars all. Folk with mettle enough to brave these lands will be challenged and astounded by forms of power, magic, and culture that are found nowhere else in Faer&ucirc;n.<br/><br/>Developed from out-of-print material originally found in FR3 Empires of the Sands, this expansion provides more than 150 pages of new information. What's inside:<br/><br/>Book One: Tethyr (96 pages) presents the many facets of Tethyr, from its origin as an elven homeland through its rise and fall as a human nation and up to its recent restoration from anarchy. While this growing realm is now the safest of the Lands of Intrigue, it was once a seat of the malevolent Empire of Shoon - whose influence still haunts the golden plains in the form of roving monsters, wandering ghosts, and the terrors of times past.<br/><br/>Book Two: Amn (64 pages) collates all that is Amn - or, as some call it, the Coinland. Money is this country's lifeblood, whether gleaned from the trade along the Sword Coast or the far-off colonies of New Amn. However, a dark dawn has risen on those whose eyes see no further than their ledgers and coin stacks...<br/><br/>Book Three: Erlkazar &amp; Folk of Intrigue (32 pages) reveals the formerly undocumented domain of Erlkazar, east of Tethyr - an area ready to be fleshed out by DMs to suit their individual campaigns. Book Three also holds the secrets of the hidden powers of the South, such as the Cowled Wizards, the Knights of the Shield, the Shadow Thieves, and the undead sorcerers of the Twisted Rune.<br/><br/>Two poster maps detail the Lands of Intrigue, the Pirate Isles of the Nelanther, and the center of the long-dead Shoon Empire, the monster-riddled ruins of Shoonach.<br/><br/>More than a dozen additional maps depict all the cities of Amn and Tethyr, as well as the distant Maztican colonies.<br/><br/>"}, "49446": {"rpgitemversion": {"5182": "Soft Cover"}, "rpgseries": {"2322": "Undermountain"}, "name": "Skullport", "rpgproducer": {"13892": "Dee Barnett"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1847370.jpg", "usersrated": "10", "rpgsetting": {"196": "Forgotten Realms"}, "average": "6.45", "rpgissuearticle": {"45545": "TSR Preview"}, "rpg": {"244": "Advanced Dungeons & Dragons (2nd Edition)"}, "poll": {}, "statistics": {}, "rpgcategory": {"2107": "Campaign Setting (game world)"}, "rpggenre": {"155": "Fantasy (High Fantasy)"}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1847370_t.jpg", "description": "From the Back of the Book:<br/><br/>Skullport, the Port of Shadow, is perhaps the best kept secret in all the Sword Coast North.

Under a moldering tangle of catwalks threaded between the stalactites and stalagmites of the cavern city, illithids, drow, beholders, and others plot and trade with emissaries from the surface. Monsters prowl the dark recesses and alleyways, gangs of zombies shamble about performing menial labor, and anything and everything can be bought and sold: lethal poisons, foul tomes of forbidden magic, and slaves.<br/><br/>The only law is meted out by the enigmatic Skulls of Skullport, mysterious floating humanoid skulls whose capricious judgments and madness-induced destructiveness are the stuff of grisly travelers' tales.

On a turn, a player moves one or more of his figures based on the roll of the die, splitting up the movement points as desired; alternatively, a player can select an officer or general before rolling, thereby allowing him to move that figure (and no others) twice or three times the number rolled.<br/><br/>If a player&rsquo;s figure lands adjacent to an opponent&rsquo;s, the players each roll a die to see which figure is sent to the sidelines, with officers receiving a +2 battle bonus and generals receiving +3. By reaching promotion zones on the board, you can upgrade figures by one rank, making them more powerful in battle.<br/><br/>Permanent and temporary safety zones provide some cover as you move figures around the board.

The adults of the world have been undone by the aliens&rsquo; seduction, and the future of humanity is now a slowly dwindling population of child survivors.<br/><br/>But there is still hope for humanity&rsquo;s future. A small group of survivors, led by a still-waking adult, have managed to reverse engineer the alien remotes, and have used this technology to make a new generation of weapons that can be used to strike at humanity&rsquo;s enemies in their world of dreams. This weapon is called an Alien Numina Inversion Machine &mdash; or ANIMa &mdash; and it allows a teenaged pilot to enter the dream world and form a mechanized battle-suit out of the spirits of her friends, lovers, and enemies. With this weapon, she can fight the aliens on their own terms, striking at the very heart of their occupation. Now, after seven years of despair, this brave group of soldiers are striking the first blows of a war that will determine the fate of the earth, humanity, earth, and their own hearts.<br/><br/>Bliss Stage is a role-playing game for 2-7 players ages 16 and up. It is focused on the story of a group of teenage resistance fighters battling an alien occupation that they cannot comprehend armed only with the power of their own hearts. It is a love story, a war story, a coming-of-age story, and an action story all rolled into one.<br/><br/>This story takes 4-8 sessions of play (about 16-35 hours) to finish. The game is highly customized, though, and thus is different every time you replay it.<br/><br/>"}, "49489": {"statistics": {}, "name": "Dragon (Issue 308 - Jun 2003)", "rpgproducer": {"17905": "Johnny L.

Many of the children were twisted and deformed. Mutants. Out of this situation, the paranoid and hateful rose to power by using force and lies to terrify the confused. As the years passed on, those mutants who did not die in their youth were growing to maturity. The Second Republic, the subtly cruel post-Plague government in what was once the United States of America, publicly divided the mutants into two groups: the Acceptables, those with only minor deformities; and the Mutazoids, creatures of barely human appearance. There is also a third group whose existence is officially denied by the Second Republic, sometimes called Supers, who resemble normal humans but have extraordinary powers.<br/><br/>The Acceptables are the majority of the population and they must be controlled. The Mutazoids are wild beasts to be herded or eliminated. To some people the argument seems reasonable. These mutants are infected with the Plague; they should be quarantined!
