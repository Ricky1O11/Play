Generally taken in place of a feat or spell known, masterpieces serve two useful functions for bard players. First, they give bards some flavor that makes them different than just &ldquo;banjoplaying sorcerers with a lot of skill points,&rdquo; and second, they increase a bard&rsquo;s overall flexibility. GMs can gain similar benefits from adding masterpieces to a campaign or creating brand new masterpieces. Perhaps only the Choirsters of the Church of the Celestial Music have access to The Lullaby of Ember the Ancient, or the minotaur-dancers of Tarse are famed for their defensive cape dance the GM creates as a cultural option.<br/><br/>Of course, the ability to use a new option either for increased flexibility or as a backgroundappropriate flavor element is limited by how many examples of that option exist. Since Ultimate Magic had to cover all the spellcasting classes, it had only limited space to explore the idea of bardic masterpieces.

In many ways the hellion is a more martial version of the witch, sharing the witch&rsquo;s power to draw on hexes and spells but with significantly more options (and inclination) to damage foes directly. What hellions give up in terms of more powerful hexes and spells they make up in greater skill in combat and special powers that have more stopping power than most witch abilities.<br/><br/>Hellions are often feared and hated by those who see them as universally evil and vicious. In all fairness, the powers of hellions do lend themselves to causing pain and misery, and many are just as cruel and spiteful as common wisdom suggests. But there is nothing in a hellion&rsquo;s powers that intrinsically requires them to be malevolent or vile. A few strive to use their powers only to punish the wicked, while a much smaller fraction actively wish to avoid causing injury, but are burdened with the powers to do so as a result of deals made during a troubled youth.<br/><br/>Though good and noble hellions are rare (and even the most saintly tend to appear brutal and sadistic to a casual observer when accessing his powers for the defense of others), a few do exist. Many are driven by a desire to atone for deeds done when the hellion was younger, and more prone to lash out without considering the consequences or morality of his actions. Of course such hellions are often met with suspicion and bias, and more than one has become so angry at this injustice as to eventually slide back into a life of debauchery and violence.<br/><br/>Role: The role of a hellion is to deal damage to foes and reduce their effectiveness through the use of hexes and afflictions, but exactly how this is accomplished depends heavily on what options the hellion chooses. A hellion of a patron of bloodshed, who takes a scimitar as a bonded item, and chooses the metal fetish talent, is likely to serve as a secondary melee combatant supporting a more heavily armored front-line weapon wielder. A hellion of a patron of curses, who takes a wand as a bonded object, and takes the master of damnations talent, is more likely to avoid the front line and work to curse foes with spells to make them easier for his allies to defeat.<br/><br/>"}, "139287": {"rpgartist": ["Storn Cook", "Skortched Urf' Studios"], "rpg": ["Pathfinder System Compatible Product"], "poll": [], "name": "The Riven Mage", "rpgdesigner": ["Owen K.C.

Known by various cultures as jinx, marvels, will-work, and invocations, most riven mages from more advanced cultures call their mystic powers &quot;rivenspells,&quot; meaning these powers use the same energies as spells but all the unnecessary trappings haven been removed. Rather than &quot;cast spells,&quot; riven mages talk of &quot;riving energies,&quot; as they see the act of creating a riven spell (&quot;to rive&quot; such an effect) the equivalent of tearing a magic effect loose from the background of reality. While rivenspells are significantly more limited in their breadth and flexibility than spells, at the same time they are freed of many of the limitations of spells. A riven mage never worries herself about having a component pouch, what armor she is wearing, or exactly what noises and movements she must make to call on her magic powers. While other spellcasters often claim riven mages are &quot;primitive,&quot; riven mages see themselves as the purest of magic-users, able to call upon their effects easily, quickly, and even under significantly adverse conditions.<br/><br/>Riven mages are proud of their powers, and like to show off what they can do. For goodaligned riven mages this often means using their powers to aid the downtrodden or defend their homelands. Neutral riven mages are more likely to seek compensation for their talents, acting as mercenaries or occasionally, entertainers. Evil riven mages are always planning to build a power base from which to gain wealth and comfort, but begin such efforts by acting as enforcers for groups who do not normally attract the full-time services of traditional spellcasters (such as gangs, brigand bands, slavers, assassins, and thieves guilds).<br/><br/>While riven mages are well known and understood in their native lands, they are also independent and often wander far from their homes. It's not unusual to find riven mages thousands of miles from their homes, making it easy to introduce a few wandering riven mages into a campaign (as travelers from a distant land where their powers are commonplace).<br/><br/>"}, "139288": {"rpgdesigner": ["Grant Gould"], "rpgitemversion": ["First Edition, PDF", "Softcover Version"], "poll": [], "name": "Blade Raiders", "rpgartist": ["Grant Gould"], "rpgproducer": ["Grant Gould"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1708877.jpg", "usersrated": "2", "average": "6", "statistics": [], "rpg": ["Blade Raiders"], "rpgpublisher": ["(Self-Published)"], "rpgcategory": ["Core Rules (min needed to play)"], "rpggenre": ["Fantasy"], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1708877_t.jpg", "description": "from the introduction<br/><br/>Welcome to Blade Raiders, a fantasy world of epic adventure, mystic locales, heroes, villains, magic, monsters, and endless possibilities.<br/><br/>This game is designed to be fast-moving and easy to learn, created for roleplayers of all ages and experience levels.<br/><br/>"}, "139289": {"rpgartist": ["Chester Ocampo", "Shaman's Stockart"], "rpg": ["Pathfinder System Compatible Product"], "poll": [], "name": "More Horrifically Overpowered Feats", "rpgdesigner": ["Owen K.C.

Either we want to release more Horrifically Overpowered feats, or we don't&mdash;hiding behind a Fool's Day would show a lack of conviction on our part. And, it turns out, we do want to release more. But if we're going to do that, and we're not going to claim it's a joke, some defense of the idea is in order.<br/><br/>Horrifically Overpowered feats, as the name might suggest, are not balanced. They are, in fact, imbalanced in three ways. First, each one represents an uptick in power larger than a typical feat (and in most cases, larger than the most powerful feats). Second, each one has the potential for being combined with class features, spells, tactics, and other feats to create an even-stronger effect than normal, causing them to skew how big a boost in power depending on the circumstances. Third, conceptually many of them bend the logic of the core rules, allowing warriors to cast spells, spellcasters to become weaponmasters, and well-designed characters to be much, much more effective than characters that have not been optimized.<br/><br/>Given the long list of sins placed at Horrifically Overpowered Feat's, er, feet, it may sound as if these rules are unusable. That's not strictly speaking true. Each feat is designed to give all the rules needed to use it in a campaign, and to be consistent and logical within the frame of reference of being Horrifically Overpowered. It's just that the feats themselves are intentionally too much to reasonably be added to a typical game.<br/><br/>So, why produce more of them?<br/><br/>The fact of the matter is that no two gaming groups are the same, and no two campaigns have exactly the same needs. After The Genius Guide to Horrifically Overpowered Feats came out, numerous customers gushed about the ways they had found to use these feats in their games. These ranged from only giving them to monsters, to using them to allow 3-man adventuring parties to survive encounters designed for 4 heroes, and even as special temporary divine blessings or for powers of artifacts. We didn't want to tell our customers they were doing it wrong, and since there seems to be a real enjoyment of such things, we began work on the second volume in what is scheduled to eventually be a 32-part line.<br/><br/>(Okay, probably not. But if the sales are good enough...)<br/><br/>However, we aren't kidding when we say these things do not meet the normal rules of good feat design. Such feats can badly unbalance a game, and shouldn't be used by anyone, at any time, without a really good reason. GMs who feel they know what they are doing are, of course, welcomed to find interesting ways to add horrifically overpowered feats to a game (we made some suggestions in The Genius Guide to Horrifically Overpowered Feats).<br/><br/>But we warned you.<br/><br/>"}, "139290": {"rpgartist": ["Lin Bo", "Clint Cearley", "V.

Sometimes the acquisition of the item marked the hero as special from the beginning, or is the catalyst for the heroes early adventures. Often, special magic items are given to heroes by the gods (Perseus famously receives gifts ranging from Hades&rsquo; helm of invisibility to Hermes&rsquo; winged sandals), or other supernatural forces (many swords of Norse mythology, including Dainsleif, Hqfud, Ridill, and Tyrfing, are forged by the dwarves, who also make magic items for the Norse gods).<br/><br/>While such items are clearly the progenitors of the magic items found in modern fantasy RPGs, there&rsquo;s often a serious disconnect between how the two kinds of items work. Mythological items are often an important and defining feature of the heroes who carry them, and accompany those heroes throughout a large chunk of their adventures. To help provide an option to fill those roles, we released The Relics of the Godlings to present a new magic item type, the godling relic, and numerous rules for adding them to a campaign.<br/><br/>While that product added eight godling relics, each with powers at levels 1-20, it also included two templates a GM could use to create relic staves and relic weapons quickly and easily.

It is more than spells that draw on the chaotic element of the alignments that define the morals of creatures throughout the multiverse, it also is a way to dip into the pure stuff of madness and creation. Chaos magic requires its practitioners to embrace a lack of control, and accept that what they want isn't always going to be what they get. In return, they can create effects far beyond their normal level of power&hellip; though that isn't always a good thing.<br/><br/>Chaos magic is often considered evil by society, and while this isn't true, it&rsquo;s an understandable position. Those who draw on chaos magic are often power-mad and, only slightly less often, just plain insane&mdash;and thus are high-profile troublemakers. And even among those who embrace chaos magic for scholarly pursuits, or as the only means to oppose powerful enemies, or because they have no choice, the unpredictable nature of chaos magic often causes them to do as much collateral damage as real, lasting good. No one wants a chaos mage living in the center of town, and while the power she represents isn't malevolent, it&rsquo;s certainly antithetical to the goals of any organized society.<br/><br/>Even so, rare examples of chaos magic as an heroic power source do exist&mdash;mostly in lands suffering under crushing tyranny and merciless laws that protect only the rich and powerful. In such kingdoms, anything that disrupts the status quo may be embraced as a form of heroic independence and liberty. Such praise is generally short lived however&mdash;once the tyrant is overturned, the confusion and random mishaps caused by chaos magic is as mistrusted by the new regime (however evenhanded it may be) as it once was by the original oppressors.<br/><br/>Despite its questionable reputation, the power of pure anarchy is often sought after by those who simply desire power, and sometimes thrust on those who would prefer a more orderly kind of magic.

Elsewhere in the setting, Solarman is punching out the villainous Dr. Thunder right now. But this is not a game about them. This is about the guys in the background, who have to deal with the everyday shit that most superheroes don't worry about. Sure, you have some superpowers, but you still gotta pay the rent, right?<br/><br/>So you did what any schmuck would do: you got a job. Specifically, all the player characters are employees of Teapot Dome Superpowered Repossession Services.

Each player assumes the role of a ruler of a space-faring civilisation. Rulers are tasked with spreading the influence of their civilisation throughout the universe. This requires the control of space sectors, and the discovery of unknown worlds (planets), with the aim of colonising them and harvesting their resources.<br/><br/>Planets come in a variety of types. Some, due to their harsh environments, support only limited populations. Others, such as lush, earth-like terran worlds, can support vast populations and have abundant resources. The greater the population that a colonised world supports, the more precious resources (and victory points) it will yield for the ruler that controls it.<br/><br/>Gathered resources pay for establishing colonies, and for technological research, such as hyper - drive engines and weapons for spacecraft, and improved planetary infrastructure. Each technology developed will yield particular advantages for a civilisation, in addition to providing victory points for winning the game. Resources may be spent to hire mercenary fighters, serving your battle for control of space sectors.<br/><br/>Some worlds also yield rare alien artefacts, which confer victory points for the player that finds them.<br/><br/>Ultimately, the ruler who controls the most developed worlds, controls the greatest number of space sectors, researches the most technologies, and discovers the most valuable artefacts will be victorious!<br/><br/>"}, "139368": {"poll": [], "name": "Crysis 3", "videogamemode": ["AI Only", "Network Multiplayer", "Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["German PlayStation 3 (Hunter Edition) edition", "German Windows (Hunter Edition) edition", "German Xbox 360 (Hunter Edition) edition", "North American PlayStation 3 edition", "North American Windows Edition", "North American Xbox 360 Edition"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2577127.jpg", "videogameseries": ["Crysis"], "videogametheme": ["Aliens", "War - Future"], "usersrated": "16", "videogamedeveloper": ["Crytek", "Crytek UK"], "videogamegenre": ["First Person Shooter"], "videogameplatform": ["PlayStation 3", "Windows", "Xbox 360"], "videogamehonor": ["2012 Game Critics Best Action Game of the Year Nominee"], "average": "6.5125", "statistics": [], "videogamepublisher": ["Electronic Arts Inc.

So I did as any half-mad game designing genius would do &mdash;I made my own version.<br/><br/>Characters.

The root concept of the game&rsquo;s setting embraces the post-apocalyptic vibe of D&amp;D. In this version, the world setting assumptions you have for D&amp;D were true millennia ago. Technology and civilizations have risen, fallen, and vanished into dust since then. Multiple extinction-level events have transformed the world.  Still, in some ancient corners only loosely connected to reality, or some areas sealed off somehow during all these ages, the old energies and creatures survive somehow.<br/><br/>In these ancient areas, there are highly endangered species that thrived way back when. (Elves, dwarves, halflings, etc. have been gone for thousands of years.)  There are different kinds of magic than humanity uses now. Different enchantments on objects drive scholars to distraction trying to tease out their secrets.  Also, some of the brave new corners of the world are extraordinarily dangerous, and require exploration.<br/><br/>The gods have abandoned this world, it has grown cold and dead-ish, magic was rebuilt to work in the new situation several thousand years ago and is now ancient in its own tradition. Into this chilly, abandoned world we see brave warriors mustering up the pluck to go into dangerous places after the lure of wonder and wealth.<br/><br/>"}, "139405": {"boardgamedesigner": ["Tomas Flod\u00e9n"], "average": "5", "poll": [], "name": "Nyans", "playingtime": "60", "minplayers": "4", "boardgamemechanic": ["Acting", "Paper-and-Pencil", "Partnerships"], "yearpublished": "2010", "usersrated": "1", "maxplayers": "16", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1590383_t.jpg", "boardgameartist": ["Kisse Lind\u00e9n"], "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["K\u00e4rnan"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1590383.jpg", "boardgameversion": ["Swedish first edition"], "maxplaytime": "60", "boardgamecategory": ["Party Game"], "age": "7", "minplaytime": "60", "description": "Nyans is a game where people are playing in teams.

This is a simple set of rules similar to older versions of the world&rsquo;s most popular fantasy roleplaying game. The game is designed to be easy to learn and fast to use during play. There are many such games available. Beyond the Wall is different for two reasons:<br/><br/>1) Flavor - Beyond the Wall can model most kinds of fantasy stories, but is particularly well-suited for a certain kind of fantasy literature best exemplified by Ursula K. LeGuin&rsquo;s first three Earthsea novels and Lloyd Alexander&rsquo;s Chronicles of Prydain. These are mostly stories of low fantasy about young heroes finding their way in dangerous situations.<br/><br/>2) Out-of-the Box Play - While the core rules of Beyond the Wall are similar to those of the numerous other games based on the world&rsquo;s most popular fantasy roleplaying game, it does<br/>offer something that the others do not: tools to play the game almost immediately and with little prep. Using special Character Playbooks and Scenario Packs, a group of players with a single gamemaster should be able to play the game with absolutely zero prep in about three to five hours, from making characters to tasting a glorious success or a bitter defeat.<br/><br/>The game still works perfectly well for traditional playstyles, but we made it as a vehicle for quick, on-the-fly play, as we often found ourselves wanting to be able to sit down and play a roleplaying game without all the fuss that is normally involved.<br/><br/>"}, "139473": {"rpgartist": ["(Uncredited)"], "rpg": ["Beyond the Wall and Other Adventures"], "statistics": [], "name": "Beyond the Walls and Other Adventures Nobility Playtest package", "rpgdesigner": ["Peter S.

X-Plane contains subsonic and supersonic flight dynamics, allowing users to predict the flight characteristics of the slowest aircraft or the fastest. X-Plane also includes more than 30 aircraft in the default installation, spanning the aviation industry and its history. Aircraft included range from the Bell 206 JetRanger and Cessna 172 to the Space Shuttle and the B-2 Bomber. Additionally, more than 1,400 additional aircraft models can be downloaded from the Internet (X-Plane.org, the X-Plane.com Links page, and Google are good places to start looking), many of which are completely free. If those aren&rsquo;t enough, users can design their own airplanes and test-fly them!<br/><br/>The full X-Plane scenery package covers the Earth in stunning resolution from 74&deg; north to 60&deg; south latitude. On Earth, users can land at any of over 33,000 airports or test their mettle on aircraft carriers, oil rigs, frigates (which pitch and roll with the waves), or helipads atop buildings. They can also realistically model the flight of remote-controlled model aircraft, perform an air-launch in an X-15 or Space Ship One from the mother ship, fly re-entries into Earth&rsquo;s atmosphere in the Space Shuttle, fly with friends over the Internet or a LAN, drop water on forest fires, or shoot approaches to aircraft carriers at night in stormy weather and rough water conditions in a damaged F-4. The situations that can be simulated are unbelievably diverse!<br/><br/>Weather in X-Plane is variable from clear skies and high visibility to thunderstorms with controllable wind, wind shear, turbulence, and micro bursts. Rain, snow, and clouds are available for an instrument flying challenge, and thermals are available for the gliders. Actual weather conditions can be downloaded from the Internet, allowing users to fly in the weather that really exists at their current location!<br/><br/>X-Plane has detailed failure modeling, with multitudes of systems that can either be failed manually at an instructor&rsquo;s command, or randomly when users least expect it! Users can fail instruments, engines, flight controls, control cables, antennae, landing gear, or any of dozens of other systems at any moment. They can also have a friend or flight instructor (locally or via the Internet, working from an Instructor&rsquo;s Operating Station) fail components on the aircraft without the pilot&rsquo;s knowledge. The instructor can alter the time of day, weather conditions, and failure status of hundreds of aircraft systems and components. Additionally, the instructor can relocate the aircraft to a location of his or her choice at any time.<br/><br/>Aircraft models are also extremely flexible, allowing users to easily create paint jobs, sounds, and instrument panels to modify any airplane you choose. Custom airplane or helicopter designs can even be created and flown using X-Plane and the included Plane Maker software.<br/><br/>X-Plane&rsquo;s accuracy (in flight model), scope (in aircraft and terrain coverage), versatility (in aircraft type and weather conditions), add-on programs (in aircraft and scenery editors), customizability, downloadable aircraft, and downloadable scenery make it the ultimate flight simulation experience for Macintosh, Windows, and Linux platforms.<br/><br/>Source: The Publisher Website.<br/><br/>"}, "139010": {"boardgamedesigner": ["Bernhard Weber"], "poll": [], "name": "Pi mal Daumen", "playingtime": "20", "minplayers": "3", "yearpublished": "2012", "usersrated": "2", "maxplayers": "8", "average": "5", "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["(Unknown)"], "boardgameversion": ["First edition"], "maxplaytime": "20", "boardgamecategory": ["Educational", "Party Game", "Trivia"], "age": "10", "minplaytime": "20", "description": "Educational card game issued by the German Goverment for political education (Bundeszentrale politische Bildung):<br/>A card is drawn an read.

You don't have to have that character card in front of you to take this action, but if someone else says that they're that character and reveals the card to prove it, that player takes the action instead while you lose one coin to the tribunal.<br/><br/>2) Swap cards or not: Take another player's character card along with yours, place them under the table, shuffle them around a bit, then give one card back to the other player while keeping one for yourself. You (presumably) know whether you changed characters and can have some idea of who you are now, but that other player might be in the dark.<br/><br/>3) Secretly look at your character: Look at your character card to make sure of who you are.<br/><br/>Play continues until one player obtains 13 coins and wins!<br/><br/>Mascarade includes more character cards than the number of players, so not all characters will be used in each game.

Like swords and sorcery type adventures? Then check out my latest, The Skyward Citadel, written for the Barbarians of Lemuria RPG system and hosted by the ever-awesome Venomous Pao, on his blog Strange Stones.<br/><br/>Here's the premise: a floating castle has appeared in the skies above the wicked city of Unselmo. At night, winged shapes dart down to snatch up captives and hold them for ransom. Even the siege machines of Unselmo's ruler, the Great Tyrant, can't lob missiles high enough to reach this citadel in the clouds.<br/><br/>Enter the heroes. Can they find a way up to the sky-fortress, and once there, overcome its diabolical master, the arch-sorcerer Giacinto? And what terrible secret is he hiding beneath his gold-stitched robes?<br/><br/>This adventure has a bit of everything, from beast men mounted on giant bats to demons with Italian names. Though written for BoL, it would fit in perfect with other S&amp;S systems like Crypts and Things, Jaws of the Six Serpents, and On Mighty Thews.<br/><br/>So what are you waiting for?

Yet even as the Inner Sphere adjusts to a new sense of normalcy, questions remain about whether the Blakist threat is gone for good or merely hibernating. Once a disorganized collective of hobbyists and academics backed by the idle wealthy, Interstellar Expeditions has emerged from the fires of war to take up the mission once claimed by ComStar's Explorer Corps: to search for the elusive hiding places where humanity's enemies might have gone. From the dead worlds within the borders of the Inner Sphere itself, to the distant, uncharted reaches of the Deep Periphery, IE relentlessly searches for the answers to mysteries dating back to mankind's first ventures into deep space, while simultaneously watching for any sign of the zealots who so recently waged the most horrendous interstellar war in modern history. Interstellar Expeditions: Interstellar Players 3 describes the organization and efforts of Interstellar Expeditions as it continues to search within (and beyond) human-occupied space in the BattleTech universe. First introduced in Interstellar Players, IE's operations have now gone truly universal, seeking answers and treasures not only from the lost and forgotten worlds of humanity's distant past, but also the distant colonies and civilizations that have risen-and even fallen-beyond the boundaries of the Inner Sphere. Gamemasters and players can decide which of these groups and discoveries may actually bear fruit, and which are the misdirections left behind by the surviving leaders of the Blakist war machine. Whether from this sourcebook or the gamemaster's own imagination, these discoveries can become the ultimate villain, ally, or unique new setting for any type of BattleTech campaign!<br/><br/>"}, "139102": {"rpgartist": ["Tony Guaraldi-Brown", "Ben Overmyer"], "rpgitemversion": ["PDF version"], "poll": [], "name": "Camp Wicakini 3: Wanagi Mato Lives!

Using a single die 3 characteristics are rolled and recorded to represent your abilities.  To begin playing the three dice are rolled and each die is referenced against a three column table to determine a location, a monster and a reward.<br/><br/>If a monster exists a die is rolled to determine combat results.  If you win the encounter or the room is empty you total the room dice and record the total as your Experience Reward.

It&rsquo;s unusual in that the players do not compete against each other, but compete against the game. This is a fairly new style of game called a co-op game or cooperative game. Players take on roles of the crew of Serenity and play through a series of Events. Using their Fightin&rsquo;, Flyin&rsquo;, and Thinkin&rsquo; skills they attempt to successfully complete these Events to earn Credits and Honor. If the players run out of Credits or Honor before the end of the game, they all lose and the game wins! If the players manage to complete the predetermined amount of Events without running out of Credits or Honor, they win the game, and live to fly another day!<br/><br/>Components:<br/><br/>Double sized Character Cards &ndash; Contains the Character&rsquo;s Skill numbers and special abilities<br/><br/>Event Cards &ndash; These are the Events the players must overcome to win the game.<br/><br/>Serenity Cards &ndash; These are dual use cards. The main use is to help the players overcome Events. It&rsquo;s secondary use is to determine random numbers.<br/><br/>Alliance Cards &ndash; These are penalty cards that are drawn if the players do not do well at certain Events. Draw too many of these and the players lose the game even if they still have Credits and Honor.<br/><br/>Gorramit Cards &ndash; These cards modify the Events, generally making them harder.<br/>A Set of Rules &ndash; The rules to the game.<br/>Honor Tokens &ndash; These are used to track the player&rsquo;s Honor.<br/>Credit Tokens &ndash; These are used to track the player&rsquo;s Credits.<br/><br/>The Character Cards each represent one of the main Characters in Firefly. In addition to having their skills values listed, Each Character has special abilities, which cost a variable amount of Credits or Honor. On a players turn he can choose to spend Credits or Honor on one of these abilities, but it brings them closer to losing, so they need to think about whether they really need to or not.<br/><br/>A typical turn of the game consists of the active player turning over the top Event card. Each Event card has three challenges, one Fightin&rsquo;, one Flyin&rsquo;, and one Thinkin&rsquo;. Each of these has a number, which the players must equal or exceed  to be successful in the challenge. Characters gain skill two different ways, they may play Serenity cards to gain skill, and, after playing their Serenity cards, they add a random number to determine their final skill. This is added to the Character&rsquo;s base skill number listed on their Character cards. Depending on how many challenges they successfully complete they either gain or lose Credits and/or Honor. The more successful the more they gain.<br/><br/>Once the event is resolved, the next player starts a new turn, and turns over the next Event card. The game is over once all the Event cards have been drawn and resolved.<br/>    <br/>The Firefly TV show is about surviving with honor. Mal and his crew are continually trying to scrounge up enough credits to keep flying, while maintaining their own personal sense of honor. The game reflects this grand theme with the victory conditions, survive the Event deck without running out of Honor or Credits.  Each Event in the deck is tied to an episode in the show, and is easily recognizable by fans of the show. The Skills needed for each Event are tied to action of the episode featured on the card. A sub theme of the show is escaping notice of the Alliance, and again, with the inclusion of the Alliance deck, Firefly: Out to the Black delivers. The Alliance deck is an ever-present threat looming over the players as they desperately seek to finish the Events in the game.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "3", "boardgameversion": ["English first edition"], "average": "5.74185", "name": "Firefly: Out to the Black", "playingtime": "45", "boardgamemechanic": ["Co-operative Play"], "age": "14", "boardgameexpansion": ["158617", "158618"], "usersrated": "254", "boardgamefamily": ["TV Series: Firefly"], "boardgamepodcastepisode": ["I've Been Diced!

Not all meerkats fight fair, though, and players can employ a number of dirty tricks in order to get one up on his rivals.<br/><br/>At the start of the game, each player is dealt 15 cards in five piles, one card in the first pile, two in the second, and so on. Turn the top card of each pile face up, then place the rest of the deck face down in the middle of the playing area. Someone flips over the topmost card of the deck to create the discard pile, then the chaos begins. Every meerkat clan card features a fighting score. You may place any of your face-up cards on the discard pile so long as its fighting score is one below or one above the number of the topmost card on the discard pile. Once you play a card, you can turn over the topmost card of the pile from which it came. In addition, you can always have five individual piles, so if one pile empties, move any face-up card from an existing pile to create a new one.<br/><br/>Event cards can be played at any time. Slam them down next to the discard pile and shout the name of the card. Play stops so that the event instructions can be carried out, after which a new round begins.<br/><br/>The objective is to get rid of all your cards. This alone, however, is not enough to claim victory as many potential clan leaders have come undone at the last moment. As soon as a player is rid of his last card, any player may slam his palm down on the discard pile to claim the victory.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": ["English first edition"], "age": "3", "name": "Meerkat Slammers", "playingtime": "5", "boardgamemechanic": ["Action / Movement Programming"], "average": "7", "usersrated": "2", "boardgamefamily": ["Crowdfunding: Kickstarter"]}, "139160": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1586687.jpg", "poll": [], "boardgamedesigner": ["Stefan Feld"], "statistics": [], "yearpublished": "2013", "maxplayers": "4", "boardgameartist": ["Julien Delval", "Harald Lieske"], "boardgamepublisher": ["(Self-Published)", "(Web published)"], "maxplaytime": "90", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1586687_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "90", "boardgamecategory": ["Dice", "Expansion for Base-game", "Medieval", "Territory Building"], "description": "Player Board created by Stefan Feld exclusively for the regional qualifying round of the German board game championship 2013.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": ["First edition", "Print-and-play edition"], "average": "7.81746", "name": "The Castles of Burgundy: 3rd Expansion \u2013 German Board Game Championship Board 2013", "playingtime": "90", "boardgamemechanic": ["Dice Rolling", "Tile Placement"], "age": "12", "boardgameexpansion": [], "usersrated": "126", "boardgamefamily": ["Alea Big Box", "Country: France"]}, "139161": {"poll": [], "boardgamehonor": ["2013/Spring Parents' Choice Gold Award Winner"], "name": "Hello Sunshine!", "playingtime": "5", "minplayers": "2", "yearpublished": "2013", "usersrated": "5", "maxplayers": "0", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2047400_t.jpg", "average": "6.1", "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["ThinkFun"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2047400.jpg", "boardgameversion": ["First edition"], "maxplaytime": "5", "boardgamecategory": ["Children's Game"], "age": "1", "minplaytime": "5", "description": "Hello Sunshine! is a charmingly simple game that will have you and your child laughing and playing together!

This is your last stop before undertaking a dig in the nearby Great Ruins. Why not enjoy some of the fine services offered in this enclosed town? There are brothels, bars, massage parlors, shops, a casino and even a gladiatorial arena, all here for your delight. After all, this may be your last night in this twisted world, why not make it one to remember? Pitford is like a great immobile tank, stuck on the battle scarred, hostile plains in the shadow of the Great Ruins. This scrap metal enclosure is more than a home base for excavators; it is a dynamic adventure site, where opportunity, riches, espionage, crime, and debauchery await. Herein, game sessions are as challenging and deadly as anything found outside of its junk and concrete shell. The fortress-town stands as a frontier bastion for a hard pressed humanity, providing a retreat from the harsh sand storms and flesh eating mutated beasts of the wilds. With one road leading in at the south and another at the north, it is stopping place for travelers, outlaws, savages, scavs, runaways and most of all, excavators. For over eighty years this fort has served as a base camp for dig teams who loot the boundless ruinscape beyond, where the lucky make it back alive with artifacts of enormous wealth and power. This book is both a game master reference resource, as well as a guide for players whose characters are visiting the bustling, old west style boom town. Included are 56 shops and businesses, 33 streets and alleys, access points to the topside roof, and stairwells to the notorious basement level. In addition, fortress defenses, gatehouses, and town watch details are included, along with a robust section on the municipal jail with encounters for those incarcerated within. Also included are series of adventure hooks, appendices, map collections, the governing Association of Business Owners and the Freehold Scouts. Situated in the north east corner of the Crossroads Region, Pitford figures heavily in upcoming adventures published for The Mutant Epoch role-playing game. While having this book isn't necessary, it would enhance game play and provide details on resources adventurers need to recover, resupply, and recruit new excavators.<br/><br/>"}, "139191": {"rpgdesigner": ["Graeme Hallett", "William McAusland", "Danny Seedhouse", "Otto Toms", "Alexander Waby"], "rpgitemversion": ["PDF version", "Softcover Version"], "poll": [], "name": "Excavator Monthly Compendium", "rpgartist": ["William McAusland", "Otto Toms", "Alexander Waby"], "rpgproducer": ["William McAusland"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2508206.jpg", "usersrated": "1", "average": "8", "statistics": [], "rpg": ["The Mutant Epoch"], "rpgpublisher": ["Outland Arts"], "rpgcategory": ["Sourcebook (rules/options to enhance play)"], "rpggenre": ["Science Fiction (Post Apocalypse)"], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2508206_t.jpg", "description": "Publisher Blurb:<br/><br/>Now you can get all six copies of Excavator Monthly Magazine in one book!

To do that you must collect the most Treasure tokens. Each player owns 11 cards, 4 Master Thieves, 6 Gambits and 1 Black Market card (score card which gives you points depending on the treasure you have collected).<br/><br/>Each player chooses 1 Master Thief and 3 Gambits to begin the game and places the chosen cards face down on the table in an accessible (by all the players) area. All these cards form a mini deck of 16 cards. You never shuffle the deck. Now you cut the deck 3 times (one time each player) and the last player takes the deck, deals the cards on the table (4 rows x 4 cards each row, from the top left to the bottom right) and plays first. In each round, the player can do one of the following actions:Reveal a hidden card or to Exchange one of the cards in his/her hand, with a hidden card on the table. In that case the player who chooses the 2nd action, must place his new card faced up but note that this action costs you -1 Victory Point at the end of the game.<br/><br/>The Gambit cards have 2 different colored dice from the four colors you will find in the game (red, blue, green, yellow). When a Gambit card is revealed and in the same column (vertically) there is another Gambit, a Dispute takes place between the two. The players who own these Gambits, roll the corresponding dice and the one with the most hits takes a Treasure token. The Treasure tokens are faced down aside and when a dispute is commencing, you take one such token in random and place it on the Gambit cards, revealing the Treasure (the cards have been designed specifically for this purpose). In case of a tied dispute, the Treasure is lost (the King's guardians snatch it as your thieves flea to take cover). In case the 2 Gambits belong to the same thieves group, no dispute takes place as they work together to get the treasure. The player who owns them, takes a Treasure token immediately!<br/><br/>Each colored die represents a basic element: blue for Aqua, red for Ignis, green for Terra, yellow for Aura. The Master Thieve cards have those elements. The Master Thieves give additional skills to the Gambits when a Dispute takes place. For example when you roll a Red and a Green die for your Gambit and there is a faced up Master Thief on the table (your or your rivals') which represents Terra (green die), you add +1 Hit to the final result! Yet nothing is over. The Black Market cards have 4 different combinations of the Treasures, different for each player which grant him Victory Points, depending on the combination. But don't be so sure you can win the game since the Master Thieves can steal the Treasures from each other with a very tricky mechanic you will discover in the game. Beware.. If your Master Thief loses his Treasures, then you must place him sideways to deactivate his ability to steal, so you must place a new Master Thief to get revenge! Prepare yourself for the faster course of your life as no one knows of his victory, until the last card on the table is revealed!<br/><br/>A race begins...<br/><br/> A Thieves' Race!<br/><br/>"}, "139200": {"videogame": ["Fix-It Felix Jr."], "poll": [], "name": "Wreck-It Ralph", "videogamemode": ["Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["Android edition", "iPhone/iPad edition"], "average": "0", "videogametheme": ["Aliens", "Cartoon", "Cute Fantasy", "Driving", "Movie, Book, TV show"], "videogamefranchise": ["Wreck-It Ralph"], "videogamecharacter": ["Wreck-It Ralph"], "videogamedeveloper": ["Disney Mobile", "Sarbakan"], "videogamegenre": ["Platform", "Racing", "Shooter"], "videogameplatform": ["Android", "iPad", "iPhone"], "usersrated": "0", "statistics": [], "videogamecompilation": ["Fix-It Felix Jr."], "videogamepublisher": ["Disney Mobile"], "vgcharacterversion": ["Wreck-It Ralph"], "description": "User Summary<br/><br/>Wreck-It Ralph is a compilation of five games for mobile devices released in 2012 as part of Disney's promotion of a film of the same name which ostensibly takes place inside several arcade games.<br/><br/>In the film, the games are linked by Game Central Station.

As LEGO released more and varied figures of fantasy or sci-fi races (orcs and dwarves for example), I incorporated them into these creations.<br/><br/>As a gamer at heart though, the one thing that I needed for these creations was back story. So, creation, by creation, built as a love letter to fantasy RPGs, movies, books, and anime, constricted by the choice of available LEGO pieces, a back story, a world that would become Full Contact Magic was built.<br/><br/>Arcanomancy was a direct need to address the magical vehicles, while Ethermancy was created new for the setting.

Digital Image Design was in process of developing the game when the company was bought by Rage Software. The game is the successor to Total Air War.<br/><br/>The back story of the game posits Russia quickly invading the eastern countries of Europe. Iceland is the next one on the list, however NATO has basically abandoned the country in an attempt to protect the Western countries of Europe. The &quot;ICEFOR&quot; is outnumbered, but is able to deploy a small number of the new Typhoon aircraft. It's up to you to turn the tide of the war.<br/><br/>The game features a very extensive virtual battleground on and over Iceland, one of the most advanced of its time. A dynamic camera enables you to watch the war in realtime - be it a Saab JAS 39 Gripen dogfighting with Sukhoi Su-27, a Boeing AH-64 Apache attacking tanks, or a Panavia Tornado going on bombing runs. As the war unfolds, news reports will be delivered via an electronic newspaper.<br/><br/>One of the most interesting aspects of Eurofighter Typhoon is that it allows you to take over the destiny of six pilots. Pilots are assigned different missions depending on their abilities. Mission types include bombing, interception and Wild Weasel (anti surface to air missile operations) - several of these missions may even be going on at the same time. You are able to switch at any time between your pilots, taking charge of the most critical and dangerous tasks and leaving the others to the AI. As the war goes on, each pilot can suffer a variety of fates - including injury, being lost behind enemy lines (after an unlucky ejection and waiting for the rescue helicopters), or getting taken prisoner (and perhaps even being interrogated by the Russians).<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;Eurofighter Typhoon (video game)&quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "139224": {"videogame": ["Eurofighter Typhoon"], "poll": [], "name": "Eurofighter Typhoon: Operation Icebreaker", "videogamemode": ["Network Multiplayer", "Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["European English Windows edition"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1591703.jpg", "videogametheme": ["War - Modern"], "usersrated": "0", "videogameexpansion": ["Eurofighter Typhoon"], "videogamedeveloper": ["Digital Image Design Ltd."], "videogamegenre": ["Action Adventure", "Flight Simulator"], "videogameplatform": ["Windows"], "average": "0", "statistics": [], "videogamepublisher": ["Rage Software"], "videogamecompilation": ["Eurofighter Typhoon"], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1591703_t.jpg", "description": "User Summary<br/><br/>Operation Icebreaker is an expansion for Eurofighter Typhoon that includes 15 new missions and a 120 page soft-copy strategy guide.
