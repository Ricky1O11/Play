Yard Sale - The active player places 1 card from their hand face up in the center of the table then draws a card from the top of the draw deck and places the card face up beside the first card. They may choose to take 1 of these cards and play it into their set or they may trade the cards to others for information about their hand.<br/>4. Draw -  draw to 5 cards.<br/><br/>Sets consist of 5 different coloured bulbs even though there are 6 total colours which means there is always one colour someone is not looking for.

But this strength comes at a cost. If you want to play as the Giant, be sure you know all the ins and outs of both their strengths AND their weaknesses.

On 21st July 1944 the Americans would return to retake the island and drive the Japanese invaders off; a day that is still celebrated as 'Liberation Day'.<br/><br/>There were many reasons why the Americans decided to invade Guam not least of which was the fact that the station of the trans-Pacific cable and the naval radio station at Agana made it a focal point of the communication network in the Pacific. It also had the best anchorage in the Marianas, 2 airstrips and, of course, it was an American Protectorate.<br/><br/>The only beaches suitable for an invasion are located on the south-western side of the island. The Japanese knew this as well and had prepared accordingly. Another thing unique to the planning was that the 2 landing beaches chosen would be 7 miles apart. It was unprecedented for two landing forces to land with such a wide separation.<br/><br/>Guam &ndash; Return to Glory will be the second game to utilize the Company Scale System (CSS) by Adam Starkweather and will come on 4 maps.<br/><br/>The game will come with 6 scenarios and 1 campaign game:<br/><br/>W-Day &ndash; Fortune favors the bold &ndash; This is the first day of the Invasion on the northern beaches. 3rd Marine Division must land against Japanese defenders dug-in on a ridge overlooking the beaches.

Single map and 8 turns long.<br/><br/>W-DAY - This is the first day of the Invasion on the both beaches. The 1st Provisional Marine Brigade must land and fight their way north, whilst the 3rd Marines fight their way south and the two forces try to join up the two beachheads near Orote Peninsular. Two maps and 8 turns long.<br/><br/>Orote Peninsular &ndash; The first 8 days of the fighting saw the Americans expand their beachheads and join up so as to cut off the Orote peninsular with it's important airfield. Once it was cut off, the Americans, then, had to force their way into the heaviest defended area on Guam not knowing that the Japanese were preparing a Sake fueled Banzai charge. Two maps and 72 turns long.<br/><br/>Into the Jungle - This scenario covers 3rd Marine Division's drive north of the beachheads to take the town of Agana and the airfield at Tiyan. One map and 27 turns long.<br/><br/>Santa Rosa - This scenario covers 77th Infantry Division's attack to isolate the area around Mount Santa Rosa . One map and 27 turns long.<br/><br/>The Battle for Guam &ndash; The full historical campaign from 21st July- 10th August (188 Turns).

The former Sith, Maul, has sent a Clawdite Shapeshifter to pursue the artifact, and any face in the crowd might hide the Shapeshifter's true identity.<br/><br/>Altogether, Heart of the Empire expands your campaign and skirmish games with three heroes and thirteen other figures, including the massive AT-DP, baton-wielding Riot Troopers, and twin-gunned Sentry Droids. Coruscant comes to life with dozens of new map tiles and more than 130 cards.

The setting is our world in the not-too-distant future. There are 12 distinct apocalyptic Scenarios presented here, each with unique challenges and opportunities. Character development is not really about leveling up stats, but rather the characters themselves change as they grow, getting better at some things while getting rusty in others. They struggle for survival and sanity as friends and loved ones die all around them. Individual prowess is never as important as the support of your Team, your Faction, and your Settlement. Ultimately, the game is about overcoming those things that have divided humanity for so long, and coming together to build a better world out of the rubble of the old.<br/><br/>The only die you need to play Apocalyptia is a d6. The game is designed to be a military-style simulation with the intention of balancing system crunchiness with fast-paced play. The book is written with a lot of system abbreviations to pack as much game content into this small package as possible. For best results, the Game Narrator should be experienced with common roleplaying game concepts and become comfortable with the rules since the majority of the work of running the game is placed on the Narrator.

Instead, several cultures and mythologies have all been brought together to exist side by side in the same setting. The core setting book includes three cultures and mythologies which form the Known World. Pridith is based on Celtic culture and mythology, Illosia is based on Greek, and Niserri is based on Egyptian.<br/><br/>The core setting book is broken into five sections. The first section provides additional information for character creation, including Edges, Hindrances, gear, Powers, and setting rules. The next three sections deal with each of the three cultures that make up the Known World, including background information and information on the gods and goddesses that form the pantheons of each culture. The final section is a bestiary with stats and descriptions of over 90 creatures, animals, and npcs pulled from all three core cultures and mythologies.<br/><br/>This is the revised version of the Mythic setting book.<br/><br/>In addition to some cleaning up of the text and adding in a couple new pieces of art, some of the changes made to the new version of Mythic include:<br/><br/>Two new locations<br/><br/>    Syrna; an Illosian city that has prospered thanks to it&rsquo;s mighty army<br/>    Loch Bannagh; a lake on the island of Pridith that is home to a large number of evil Sidhe, and one of the biggest and meanest lock monsters ever to have existed.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Three new monsters<br/><br/>    Daughters of Arachne; horrible spider/human hybrids descended from a princess who was cursed by the goddess Athena.<br/>    Dullahan; evil Sidhe horsemen who carry their own severed heads and a whip made of human spines.<br/>    Winged Serpents; giant vipers with feathery wings that are so violent they&rsquo;ll even turn on each other and fight to the death<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Duties of the Priesthood<br/>Before, each deity had a list of duties that gave examples of certain jobs and modes of behaviour possessed by worshippers.

In the revised boo, priests and priestesses must follow the Duties of the Priesthood associated with their particular deity.

Players take on the roles of China, the United States, Malaysia, the Philippines, and Vietnam.  They simulate current political tensions through card play and structured negotiation keyed to real world events in an effort to &quot;move the needle&quot; to their side.  Unfortunately, the cards with the greatest chance of moving that needle, such as Chinese Coast Guard and U.S. Freedom of Navigation Exercise, are also most likely to trigger armed conflict.  If and when that happens, play transitions to traditional hex-and-counter format on a map scaled at 45 nautical miles (nmi) per hex and turns of 3-7 hours.<br/><br/>SCS is derived from Breaking the Chains (BtC), but is definitely a different game.  How do the two differ?  SCS begins with political turns that can lead to victory without armed conflict.  For armed conflict, SCS focuses more closely on the South China Sea (45 nmi per hex) rather than the larger southeast Asian region of BtC (70 nmi per hex) and uses smaller units such as air squadrons, ship pairs, and land battalions.  Therefore, the SCS map shows more detail, but less territory.  SCS employs streamlined versions of BtC's turn structure and strike mechanisms that expedite play by dispensing with numerous cycles and strike paths.  SCS nodded to ergonomics by putting all scores on one side of each counter &ndash; less flipping.  Most important, SCS allows naval units to move more than one hex in a single turn, but includes a mechanism, based on stealth, that enables the other side to &quot;check&quot; multi-hex moves to create a more dynamic, variable, and volatile environment.  This last adjustment allows quick moves at a distance, but prevents close-in ships from &quot;jumping&quot; through the beaten zone of modern anti-ship cruise missiles (ASCM), 290 nmi in some cases.  And, every turn has the option for a negotiations phase with some structure to enhance political play if desired.<br/><br/>"}, "226998": {"poll": [], "name": "Mystic Midway: Phantom Express", "videogamemode": ["Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["North American Windows edition"], "average": "0", "videogametheme": ["Cartoon"], "usersrated": "0", "videogamedeveloper": ["Mass Media Inc.
