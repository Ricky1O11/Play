That is a delusion. All I can do is provide you with cardboard pieces and a paper map, and instructions on what to do with them, and maybe some words of historical commentary. Can you feel the confusion and chaos, the reports, false and true, that filled British Headquarters when the counterattack hit ? Can you think what it was like to see the ranks of feldgrau figures appear two hundred yards away, peering through the fogged eyepiece of a gas mask into the back sight of a Lee-Enfield rifle ? I cannot tell you what was in the minds and souls of men who fought the battle. I'm no artist. I design wargames&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Through the mud and the blood to the green fields beyond.&quot; This quote, attributed to Brigadier General Hugh Elles, who led the Tank Corps into action at Cambrai, succinctly states the British objective-to penetrate the German trenches and break into their rear areas. The idea of a breakthrough to the green fields beyond had dominated Allied thinking since 1915. Cambrai was to be as close as they were to come before the final breakthrough of 1918.<br/><br/>To the Green Fields Beyond is an operational level simulation of the Battle of Cambrai which lasted from 20 November to 7 December, 1917. There are two players, one commanding the British and the other the German forces. The game consists of three scenarios and a campaign game. The players should start with a scenario- the British Breakthrough is best- before attempting the full 17 turns of the campaign game. Players should note that each game turn in To the Green Fields Beyond requires many decisions, and will probably take between 30 and 75 minutes to play.<br/><br/>To the Green Fields Beyond is uncommon amongst games in that both players get the opportunity to take the offensive. The campaign game provides opportunities for both sides to attack. The British Breakthrough and Battle for Bourlon scenarios have the British attacking, while the German Counterattack scenario obviously has them as defenders, although they can still often mount attacks as well.<br/><br/>Each hex on the mapsheet represents 1250 yards from side to side.

The rest of the Map Cards - and the map - come into play randomly, but at the players' pace.<br/><br/>The remaining cards are for the 27 Powers - countries from the strong but troubled Holy Roman Empire, England and France, through the various Islamic powers, down to such minor, but important, countries such as The Kingdom of Jerusalem, Livonia and Trebizond. Even such mysterious and far away areas as Polovtsy and The Cumans come into play. - and the various &quot;events&quot; the players use to forward their schemes.<br/><br/>Each Player represents an ever-changing conglomerate of these Powers, using his wiles, and the cards, to further his control over areas of Europe to win the game. There are Spies, Assassins, accusations of Heresy, Jihads, even the use of the various Knights of Christ.<br/><br/>And then there are the Popes. Each player, randomly, can become Pope (they're named and historical). As Pope he can arrange alliances, excommunicate players, and call for Crusades (a great way to make money).<br/><br/>But hovering like a very, very black cloud over all of this are The Mongols.

From the publisher's web page:<br/><br/>Vanished Planet is a cooperative board game. That means that all players work together to play the game, and either win as a group or lose as a group. It can be played with as many as six players or as few as one.<br/><br/>Playing the game requires complex strategies involving ship movement, resource management, and technology building, all while trying to delay the creature's progress towards destroying the players' home worlds.<br/><br/>The difficulty level is scalable, making it enjoyable for everyone from the beginner to the expert. Vanished Planet can be made easy enough for parents to play with their children or difficult enough to challenge the most masochistic hardcore gamers.<br/><br/>Vanished Planet takes place in a richly detailed game world.<br/><br/>The past one hundred years had been marked by an unprecedented peace. Humans from the Earth, newcomers to the Galactic Sextant, surprised the Elder Races with their grasp of foreign technologies and their dedication to freedom and peace. With Earth's help, a massive communications and trade network was established. Treaties were negotiated. Disputes were settled and wars became less frequent. The Peoples of the Sextant welcomed the children of Earth and looked toward a brighter future.<br/><br/>Then, without warning, Earth vanished.<br/><br/>In its place appeared a writhing mass of darkness. It was impenetrable. It was unassailable. It was without reason. It drank energy like water and consumed all matter it touched. After devouring Earth's solar system, the Creature began stretching massive tentacles across space with terrifying speed, reaching straight toward the homeworlds of the Six Peoples.<br/><br/>With Earth gone, the communications network all but broke down. Each of the Peoples accused the others of betraying Earth and setting loose the Creature, for each had lost many of their top men and women with the planet when it disappeared. And with them vanished all hope of stopping the dark Creature. In their despair, colonies revolted, workers ran from their jobs and soldiers abandoned their posts in an attempt to flee the approaching darkness.<br/><br/>It was days before any news came to them. Even the hub satellites that formed the backbone of the network spun silently in empty space. News came in the unexpected form of a single ship; one of the few to survive the cataclysm and return to tell what they had seen. Unlike the other ships, they brought not rumor, but six of those thought lost in the vanishing and their tale was devoid of the speculations the other ships had brought.<br/><br/>The ship, Hope, raced from home world to home world bringing what truth they knew of Earth's disappearance to their peoples, narrowly avoiding the wars that were preparing to burst forth over the galaxy even as the Creature began groping insatiable tentacles toward them over the vastness of space. <br/> Then the messages came. As one, the hub satellites flickered into life; suddenly and strangely, for the words were not sent by the peoples to one another, but to all six peoples from the the vanished planet Earth!<br/><br/>Bizarre blueprints for wondrous new technologies were transmitted and strange instructions were given, both for the banishment of the Creature and the formation of a new system for Earth to use when it returned. Time was of the essence. Earth could do nothing and the Creature would soon devour the other worlds if they did not hurry...<br/><br/>Expanded by:<br/><br/>    Vanished Planet: Racial Advantage Expansion<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>", "minplayers": "1", "boardgameversion": {"29772": "First Edition"}, "average": "5.87221", "name": "Vanished Planet", "playingtime": "60", "boardgamemechanic": {"2023": "Co-operative Play"}, "age": "8", "boardgameexpansion": {}, "usersrated": "467", "boardgamesubdomain": {"5497": "Strategy Games"}, "boardgamefamily": {"22783": "Admin: Better Description Needed!"}}, "7241": {"boardgamedesigner": {"3": {"name": "(Uncredited)"}}, "poll": {}, "name": "Fight for the Sky", "playingtime": "180", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": {"2026": "Hex-and-Counter"}, "yearpublished": "1982", "usersrated": "47", "boardgamesubdomain": {"4664": "Wargames"}, "maxplayers": "2", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic506018_t.jpg", "average": "6.07447", "statistics": {}, "boardgamepublisher": {"1028": {"name": "Attactix Adventure Games"}}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic506018.jpg", "boardgameversion": {"59284": "Attactix First Edition"}, "maxplaytime": "180", "boardgamecategory": {"2650": {"name": "Aviation / Flight"}}, "age": "12", "minplaytime": "180", "description": "The Battle of Britain was perhaps Great Britain's finest hour.<br/><br/>&quot;Never in the field of human conflict<br/>was so much owed by so many to so few.&quot;  - Winston Churchill<br/><br/>[From the back cover or from flyer...]<br/><br/>FIGHT FOR THE SKY is a Battle of Britain game that covers the epic struggle over South East England from August 11th to 18th, 1940, the period during which the Luftwaffe concentrated on knocking out the RAF and its bases.<br/><br/>The counter mix contains eight aircraft types including the famous Spitfires and Hurricanes together with Me109s, Me110s, He111s, Ju88s, Do17s and the dreaded Stukas.

In a sense, it was something more akin to a social experiment and performance art in game form. On the bottom side of its box, the game description reads: &ldquo;Experience the ghetto. Live on Welfare. Try to buy a place in a white suburb. Your challenge: To keep the land-hungry majority type from winning the game cheaply and quickly.... If Black players turn the tide against white advantages, a kind of irrepressible excitement takes over the board.&rdquo;<br/><br/>Players were divided into Whites and Blacks and had to make economic progress while competing with each other. Based on &quot;Monopoly&quot;, the idea was to demonstrate how the odds were stacked against black people in society by having different rules for each race in the game. The difference between this and all the other roll-and-move go-around-the board-buying-property games is that before the game, each player assumes the role of either a Black or White person.<br/><br/>Whites start out as the majority with $1,000,000.00 to spend and are able to buy property anywhere. Blacks start out as the minority with only $10,000.00 to spend; are unable to buy certain properties; have to draw from a separate Chance deck; are banned from purchasing property in the 'Surburban Zone'; and collect less money for completing a lap around the gameboard. Blacks are limited to certain areas of the board until they had accumulated at least $100,000.00. Players are encouraged to change the rules when anyone lands on the People's Park space.<br/><br/>Needless to say, it turned out to be one of the most controversial board games of all time and even merited an article in Time magazine: &quot;The game, produced by Psychology Today Games (an off shoot of the magazine) now on sale ($5.95) at major department stores, was developed at the University of California at Davis by Psychology Department Chairman Robert Sommer. It was conceived as a painless way for middle-class whites to experience &mdash; and understand &mdash; the frustrations of blacks. In Sommer&rsquo;s version, however, the black player could not win; as a simulation of frustration, the game was too successful. Then David Popoff, a Psychology Today editor, redesigned the game, taking suggestions from militant black members of 'US' in San Diego. The new rules give black players an opportunity to use &mdash; and even to beat &mdash; the System.&quot;<br/><br/>Although turning &quot;Monopoly&quot; into an attempt to draw people&rsquo;s attention to social issues seems a little bit of a long shot, it&rsquo;s worth noting that the original version of 'Monopoly' itself, called &lsquo;The Landlord&rsquo;s Game&lsquo;, was designed to demonstrate how the current economic system led to inequality and bankruptcy.<br/><br/>Psychology Today&rsquo;s board game division seems to have been short-lived but other titles included 'The Cities Game' involving &lsquo;urban tension, corruption and the undercurrents of city politics'; and 'Woman and Man' where &lsquo;Each woman must accumulate enough Status Quo points (100) to prove her equality to Men. Each man must collect enough Status Quo points (100) to prove once and for all a Woman&rsquo;s place is beneath his.&rsquo;<br/><br/>"}, "7246": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic30074.jpg", "poll": {}, "boardgamedesigner": {"3": {"name": "(Uncredited)"}}, "statistics": {}, "yearpublished": "1984", "maxplayers": "4", "boardgameartist": {"3": "(Uncredited)"}, "boardgamepublisher": {"117": {"name": "International Games"}}, "maxplaytime": "20", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic30074_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "20", "boardgamecategory": {"1002": {"name": "Card Game"}}, "description": "From the makers of Uno<br/><br/>Object of Game: To avoid the Gremlins!

Each player in turn bids one of the suits for trump, or can bid the value 6 game where the declarer(bid winner) can attempt to take no tricks and the other two must try to force him to do so, or the 7 game where there is no trump suit. The highest bid becomes the declarer, takes the two cards from the &quot;talon&quot; and discards two, and then must take 6 suits to succeed in the game he bid for or a higher one.  The opposing players have the option to play in which they must get two tricks to succeed.  If only one player is opposing, he may request the aid of the other non-declaring player in an attempt to make the declarer fail in his bid, but takes all the bonuses or penalties for doing so.  Non bid hands means a double scoring round in the next hand, and &quot;kontra&quot; may be offered to double the stakes of a hand a player is confident in making the declarer fail (and can be &quot;rekontra&quot; and &quot;sukontra&quot; or doubled and doubled again and again!).<br/><br/>The players start out with a set number of points (usually 100 each) and the game goes until the total of all three players equals zero.

The combat units involved represent the average organizations of the U.S., Germany, and the U.S.S.R. The playing area represents typical European buildings and streets. All names on the maps are in German, but represent typical small town architecture and street plans left over from the Middle Ages . . . Proceed with caution: the town is unfriendly, the enemy is experienced and your men aren't expendable. You have your mission and your organization. As soon as you read the rules and set-up, it will be H-HOUR.&quot;<br/><br/>From designer's William A. Comito's comments in the rulebook: &quot;A game is one man's view of a particular subject, and is only as good as the author's research and experience. I designed this game from the viewpoint of a professional soldier who has spent 6+ years in the infantry, including two combat tours, and who has been an instructor in small unit tactics and map reading. My training has been in all aspects of infantry combat, and my research has included not only books but interviews with combat infantry veterans of WWII . . . The game is, honestly, an attempt to combine a miniatures game and a boardgame together. Most of the rules are written from a boardgame viewpoint, but can be readily applied to miniatures.&quot;<br/><br/>"}, "7042": {"boardgamedesigner": {"2497": {"name": "Rich Slabbekoorn"}}, "poll": {}, "name": "Hyper Battle", "playingtime": "60", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": {"2026": "Hex-and-Counter"}, "yearpublished": "1981", "usersrated": "1", "boardgamesubdomain": {"4664": "Wargames"}, "maxplayers": "3", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic69082_t.jpg", "average": "2", "statistics": {}, "boardgamepublisher": {"1635": {"name": "Future and Fantasy Games"}}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic69082.jpg", "maxplaytime": "60", "boardgamecategory": {"1016": {"name": "Science Fiction"}}, "age": "12", "minplaytime": "60", "description": "2091 - On the fiftieth anniversary of the official establishment of the colony, New Terra declares itself independent of Earth's rule.

Bands of stouthearted Extras are led by Main Characters -- from the streets of London to the hills of South Africa and from the glorious charges of the Crimea to the maelstrom of the American Civil War. The rules are written with the works of Victorian science fiction authors in mind, such as Wells, Verne, and Haggard. In addition to standard colonial era actions, special rules are included for adding various science fiction elements to the plot, including, but not limited to, steam conveyances, fabulous inventions, glorious weapons, and strange creatures from the depths of the jungle or the core of the Earth.<br/><br/>In G.A.S.L.I.G.H.T., units generally consist of ten figures led by one or more Main Characters. A player normally controls one or two units. A player may also control one or two vehicles and their crews. G.A.S.L.I.G.H.T. includes rules for creating Main Characters with somewhat more detail than the Extras. The games then are a combination of unit actions and individual heroism in the tradition of adventure novels and swashbuckling films.<br/><br/>Command and control is accomplished through a card-based turn system. Movement is based on moving individual figures. Firing is done by figure as well, but the firing procedure is very quick. Morale is accomplished through a unique, stateless system that treats loss of cohesion in an novel way.<br/><br/>Detailed charts are provided for creating personal weapons, heavy weapons, vehicles, and fantastic creatures. The concept used in G.A.S.L.I.G.H.T. is that of imperfect mechanization -- machines don't always work as intended. This often adds a bit of excitement and humor to the games.<br/><br/>The authors of G.A.S.L.I.G.H.T. made the specific design choice not to build their own world for these rules. Instead the rules allow for the generation of vehicles, weapons, and creatures that allow groups of players to tailor the rules to their perception of Victorian science fiction. As a result, the rules are flexible.<br/><br/>The system now includes The G.A.S.L.I.G.H.T. Compendium which includes most of the expansion books.

The players move around the colorful board, landing on opportunities to earn income, spend money on non-deductible expenses and to purchase a variety of tax shelters.

Finally, an exposure to the horrors and humor of audit lurks with every roll of the dice.

NATO was surprised then, when two Soviet motorized rifle divisions entered the Fulda Gap supported by attack helicopters, aiming to seize a NATO nuclear site at Giessen, the Wiesbaden Airfield, and the critical Rhein-Main Airbase... A mobile, confusing engagement ensured, independent of the major battles along the rest of the front.<br/><br/><br/><br/>    The Battle for Fulda Scenario: At the outbreak of the next war, few areas were harder hit than the Fulda Gap. Here an entire Soviet Army and various support units, including an airborne regiment, were committed on the first day... Those [NATO support units] that survived were ordered to &quot;contain all enemy breakouts&quot; until the arrival of the 5th Panzer Division.<br/><br/><br/><br/>    Fifth Corps Scenario: Following the initial attack by 8th Guards Army, the Soviets sought to seal the fate of NATO in the Fulda/Frankfurt area by committing the 1st Guards Tank Army to the action...

Frequently, forces will clash in surface battles, and players track damage, hit by hit, reducing ship capabilities and inflicting casualties.<br/><br/>SOPAC includes 20 scenarios -- 10 Battle and 10 Operational -- allowing players to explore the early days of combat and try some what-if situations that history never explored.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": {"40394": "First edition"}, "average": "7.15505", "name": "Second World War at Sea: SOPAC", "playingtime": "240", "boardgamemechanic": {"2026": "Hex-and-Counter"}, "age": "12", "boardgameexpansion": {}, "usersrated": "109", "boardgamesubdomain": {"4664": "Wargames"}, "boardgamefamily": {"45": "Second World War at Sea"}}, "7115": {"boardgamedesigner": {"3": {"name": "(Uncredited)"}}, "poll": {}, "name": "Trade Wars: The Game of Global Commerce", "playingtime": "60", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": {"2013": "Commodity Speculation"}, "yearpublished": "1991", "usersrated": "1", "maxplayers": "4", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic766777_t.jpg", "average": "5", "statistics": {}, "boardgamepublisher": {"1657": {"name": "Naiad Corporation"}}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic766777.jpg", "boardgameversion": {"72444": "First Edition"}, "maxplaytime": "60", "boardgamecategory": {"1021": {"name": "Economic"}}, "age": "15", "minplaytime": "60", "description": "The Cold War is over!

The rules also cover blanketing effects by windward yachts toward leeward yachts, tacking, and jibing.<br/><br/>The course is somewhat fixed in that the wind direction is always the same (southeast) and there are three course markers designated on the map. However, there are four different courses that may be run: counterclockwise around the triangular course described by the three markers, clockwise around the triangular course, around course marker 2 and back, or around course marker 3 and back.

As portions of the race are completed, the map cards from that segment are returned to the draw pile to be reused later in the game.<br/><br/>There are no spaces on the board. The direction and strength of the wind are indicated by lines on the plastic map cards. The distance a ship moves is determined by the wind strength and the ship's bearing in relation to the wind direction.<br/><br/>The ships have clear plastic bases with a numbered wheel mounted in the center. The ships' bases have lines molded into them that are aligned with the lines on the map cards to establish the bearing of a ship. As the ship is moved across the map, the wheel in the center turns, and each number on the wheel indicates one unit of movement.  On a map card with strong wind indicated a ship bearing on a beat, broad reach or downwind moves 4 units or one complete revolution of the wheel.  A beam reach bearing generates 6 units of movement.  On a map card with light wind indicated, the movements are half.<br/><br/>A plastic &quot;windshadow&quot; card is used to determine when an opposing boat is in &quot;disturbed air&quot; - this differs based on whether the boats are on the downwind or windward (upwind) leg.

Each time you pitch or bat you choose a baseball strategy.  Make your decision just as in real baseball -- depending on what kind of hit you want to get, how many outs there are, and if there are runners on the base.  Then compare your choice with your opponent's and find out what happens.  You could strike out, get a walk, or a hit.  If it's a hit -- you watch the videotape to see the outcome!<br/><br/>And VCR Baseball is actually two strategy games in one.  The advanced game adds more baseball depth.  Your team players have their own batting and pitching abilities, so you can bring in a right-handed pinch hitter to try for a crucial hit off a lefty pitcher.  Or relieve a tiring pitcher.

The game combines a mechanic usually reserved for smaller games -- a chit pull combat system -- with two gorgeous maps, 900 counters, and a 36-page rulebook that should have &quot;Don't Panic!&quot; inscribed on its cover (the designer was content to place the warning on the first page of rules instead).<br/><br/>As you read the rules, you get the feeling that the designer wants to bring back the best parts of the &quot;good old days&quot; of wargaming -- that newfound excitement and thrill you once had that gradually wore off as you slogged through the complexity of the latest SPI monster. The rulebook is written almost in prose, gently explaining each rule and including historical footnotes when appropriate. Though long, it is well-organized and easily cross-referenced.<br/><br/>The graphics are detailed but subtle, aiding play without distracting the player (in contrast with maps from games like The Gamers' &quot;Thunder at the Crossroads&quot;, where the vibrant color can make you cross-eyed). Hues of gray and green predominate. A fair amount of information is packed on each counter. Player aids are plentiful.<br/><br/>The game itself focuses on post-invasion Normandy, where the Germans are trying to delay and attrite the Allies prior to their inevitable breakout. As much of the victory depends on the Allies' ability to maintain momentum throughout the campaign as it does capturing key victory point hexes -- any signs of trench warfare or, worse, seesaw battling over villages is severely penalized.<br/><br/>In yet another attempt to limit intelligence, the combat system includes a combat effectiveness 'chit pull' system that disguises actual unit combat strength up to the last moment.
