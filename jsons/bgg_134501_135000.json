You must not only destroy the targets but you must also balance the delicate political repercussions of your attacks. If you strike too hard, your air offensive might be put on hold, strike to light, and you&rsquo;ll be blamed for losing the war.<br/><br/>Welcome to the Vietnam Air War!<br/><br/>Each of the campaigns can be played with either an Air Force or Navy squadron. The targets assigned to each service are different and change the complexion of the campaigns. Each campaign can be played with three different durations of: Skirmish, Conflict, or War.<br/><br/>Each mission takes roughly 30 minutes to set-up, plan, and resolve.<br/><br/>Each of your pilots has their own skills. Selecting the right pilots and weapons for a mission is vital to its success. As you fly missions, your pilots will gain experience and fatigue. With experience, their skills improve, but as their fatigue increases, their skills decrease and they might not be able to fly for several missions.<br/><br/>For those of you familiar with our modern era Hornet Leader series of games, you might be wondering what&rsquo;s different about Phantom Leader&hellip;<br/><br/>The freedom of being able to select the best mission based on military objectives is something that is commonplace for today&rsquo;s military. Back in Vietnam, the military was responsible for carrying out their orders, while at the same time being extremely limited in the weapons and tactics they were allowed to use to complete those orders. In many cases, the specific weapons, approach paths, and bombing altitudes were generated target-by-target at the White House. The mission specifics were then sent down the chain of command to the individual pilots flying the mission. As you can imagine, this was not the best way to run an air campaign.<br/><br/>Every target has a Political value. If you destroy it, you move the Political counter to the right a number of spaces equal to its value. As the counter gets moved to the right, your future target choices are reduced to those that are less politically sensitive. Which target you choose not to attack is also important. You get to move the Political counter to the left a number of spaces equal its Political value.<br/><br/>This means that while you might like to flatten a big enemy target and rack up the victory points, it might be better for you to choose a pointless target and move the Political counter in your favor instead.<br/><br/>Another difference is in combat power. For the last couple decades, the US Air Force and Navy have enjoyed air superiority due to training and technology. Such was not the case in the skies over Vietnam. The enemy had different, but just as capable, equipment. They also had the training and will to use it to its utmost.<br/><br/>They soon became aware of the limitations placed on the US forces by the politicians, and used those limitations to their advantage.<br/><br/>For example, at times, US pilots were not permitted to fire on enemy aircraft until they were visually identified. This negated any range advantage conveyed by the radar-homing AIM-7 Sparrow missiles. It was also a common limitation that enemy aircraft could only be attacked in the air. US pilots were not allowed to attack enemy airbases. US aircraft were also limited to flying predictable flight paths, at set times. This made setting up ambushes much easier for the enemy.<br/><br/>So, while you might be a Hornet Leader ace, Vietnam is a whole different ballgame!<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "1", "boardgameversion": ["English edition 2013"], "average": "8.08232", "name": "Phantom Leader Deluxe", "playingtime": "30", "age": "12", "usersrated": "246", "boardgamesubdomain": ["Wargames"], "boardgamefamily": ["Leader Series", "Solitaire Games", "Solitaire Wargames"], "boardgamepodcastepisode": ["OBG 113: Hey New Guy", "TGG Episode 53: Romance of the Nine Empires, Dawn of the Zeds 2nd Edition, Phantom Leader Deluxe, Phil Lawrence of the Long Beach Comic and Horror Con, and More!"]}, "134521": {"boardgamedesigner": ["(Uncredited)"], "poll": [], "name": "D\u00e9couvrir le Bas-Rhin", "playingtime": "0", "minplayers": "2", "yearpublished": "2002", "usersrated": "0", "maxplayers": "6", "boardgamefamily": ["Country: France", "Decouvrir"], "average": "0", "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["Ludix"], "boardgameversion": ["Ludix First Edition 2002"], "maxplaytime": "0", "boardgamecategory": ["Card Game", "Travel", "Trivia"], "age": "10", "minplaytime": "0", "description": "There is a Bas-Rhin in the game board what is a department  of France.<br/><br/>Each player chooses a circuit (Architecture-Culture-History, Economics, Gourmet or Nature) and places his token on one of the places.

They were mountainous, etched with deep valleys, and covered with lush foliage. Greysolt surveyed the chain as best he could with his spyglass, taking the longest time upon the southernmost island, covered in a hazy steam of warm clouds. The crew of The Dromedary remained silent as the Captain surveyed what no other voyagers had ever seen.

It was first announced on March 9, 2009, and was released on June 1, 2009 in North America and on November 27, 2009 in the PAL regions. The developers took inspiration from multiple sources, including the video games Wendy: Every Witch Way and The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past. In it, players control Alta, a girl who has to reach a fishman by flipping between areas until she can reach him. Since its release, Mighty Flip Champs! has received all-around positive reception. It holds an aggregate score of 83/100 and 83.50% from Metacritic and Game Rankings respectively, while also being called one of the best video games for the DSiWare service. It is the first game in the Mighty series, and is followed by Mighty Milky Way and Mighty Switch Force.<br/>The game has been ported to PlayStation 3 and PlayStation Portable via the PlayStation Network as a PlayStation Mini under the title Mighty Flip Champs! DX. It was released in North America on July 12, 2011.<br/><br/>Mighty Flip Champs! is a puzzle/platform game hybrid, requiring players to explore stages that vary from having two areas to up to eight areas. The objective is to get the player-character, Alta, through the stage and to find the Fishman. Later in the game, levels will add characters that Alta must find before she may exit the stage. Alta has only two abilities: movement and flipping. Movement requires use of the Nintendo DS' directional pad, allowing Alta to move only left or right. The player controls Alta on the top screen, with another area being shown on the bottom screen with a mirror image of Alta shown. Players are able to flip to a different screen by pushing a button. When these screens are flipped, the area on the bottom screen will appear on the top screen; depending on the number of areas, the top area will be moved to the bottom area, or a new area will be revealed. If Alta does not have any footing to land on, she will fall, though uninjured. If there is an obstacle in the way while flipping, she will lose and the level will end. Some special stages exist where Alta cannot flip the screen, and is at the whim of a clock which flips the screen every so often. Once a stage is completed, the players are shown their time and an accompanying rank, the highest being an &quot;S&quot;.<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;Mighty Flip Champs!&quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "134593": {"poll": [], "name": "Mighty Milky Way", "videogamemode": ["Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["Nintendo DSiWare Downloadable edition"], "average": "0", "videogameseries": ["Mighty"], "videogametheme": ["Aliens"], "usersrated": "0", "videogamedeveloper": ["WayForward Technologies"], "videogamegenre": ["Puzzle"], "videogameplatform": ["Nintendo DS"], "statistics": [], "videogamepublisher": ["WayForward Technologies"], "description": "Mighty Milky Way is an action puzzle video game for the Nintendo DSi.

The scenarios included are Lee at Gettysburg, Senlac: Hastings 1066, and The Emperor Strikes Back: Waterloo. The scenarios all use a common rule set but are meant to build on each other. Each scenario adds rules from the previous scenario (Gettysburg is the simplest scenario and The Emperor Strikes Back: Waterloo is the most complicated.)<br/><br/>The turns in each scenario are played in the following sequence:<br/>Gettysburg: Player A = Confederate, Player B = Union<br/>Senlac: Player A = Saxon, Player B = Norman<br/>Waterloo: Player A = British, Player B = French<br/>1. Reinforcements for both players<br/>2. Player A Movement<br/>3. Player B Defensive Fire/Combat<br/>4. Player A Offensive Fire/Combat<br/>5. Player B Movement<br/>6. Player A Defensive Fire/Combat<br/>7. Player B Offensive Fire/Combat<br/>8. Victory Check<br/><br/>Victory in each scenario is determined by a set number of unit losses. For example, in the Gettysburg scenario, the first player to eliminate five of his/her opponent's pieces is the winner. The victory rules for the other games are slightly more complicated but are still based on number of unit losses.<br/><br/>The rules for each scenario are under two pages.

Scientists still can't explain what happens when people dream, why we have them or why people see them. There's also pretty convincing evidence that mammals and birds also dream. The shaman, medicine men and wise sages of various cultures around the world believe that dreaming is a trance-like state of being, during which a person feels both connected and at one with the universe. They believe, that in this particular state it is possible to discover secrets from beyond: How the universe works or see fragments of the past or future. Normally after waking, the average person can't remember what they dreamed about or merely have a vague recollection of a surreal scene or a few cloudy snippets of what happened.<br/>The main character in Dream Sleuth, Catherine, always had normal dreams. That is until one day that she saw one that was remarkably real. A dream that featured a little girl that went missing and the police couldn't find. The dream was so clear that she decided to start her one investigation to find the missing girl. She interviews people that knew the missing girl and sifts through facts and rumors, but she finds the most important clues and information in her dreams.<br/><br/>Dream Sleuth is the first game in NevoSoft's new Book of Mystery series - great narratives that combine adventure  stories with hidden object levels and mini-games.<br/><br/>We don't recommend playing this game at night.

It was first released in arcades on November 25, 1998. It has several home console versions, including Neo Geo AES and Neo Geo CD versions, a Dreamcast port, and a Neo Geo Pocket Color conversion entitled The Last Blade - Beyond the Destiny, released in Japan on March 13, 2000. The Neo Geo CD version includes an extra quiz mode, voiced cutscenes, and a gallery section from both titles. Most of these features and the Neo Geo additions were combined for the Dreamcast port titled Last Blade 2: Heart of the Samurai released in 2001. Film of the game was also released on January 1, 1999. It follows Hibiki's reluctant journey as a warrior. Neo Geo CD and Dreamcast had their Exclusive Characters named Musashi Akatsuki.<br/><br/>Long before humanity existed, in a far off time of myth, death was an unknown, equally distant concept, but when death first came to the world, the &quot;Messenger from Afar&quot; was born. With time, the Sealing Rite was held in order to seal Death behind Hell's Gate. At that time, two worlds, one near and one far, were born. Thus the history of life and death began. Half a year has passed since Suzaku's madness, and the underworld is still linked by a great portal. Kagami's great sin is still heard as if ringing from the heavens. Our world has been called upon. Legends of long ago told of the sealing of the boundary between the two worlds. The Sealing Rite would be necessary to hold back the spirits of that far away world<br/><br/>The setting is set one year after the events of the first game. Gameplay elements remain the same as the first title with some minor adjustments. One more mode called &quot;EX&quot; was added to play, which is a combination of &quot;Speed&quot; and &quot;Power&quot;. The grim mood of the series was stressed more than its predecessor through various ways: both introductions to the game hint to the end of an age, characters are colored to be slightly darker, and the game's cutscenes are made lengthier to emphasize the importance of the plot. Three new characters were introduced: Hibiki Takane - daughter of a famed sword smith, she is searching for the silver-haired man that requested the last blade her father made. Setsuna - a being believed to be the &quot;Messenger from Afar&quot;, he requested a blade to be forged from Hibiki's father. Kojiroh Sanada - Shinsengumi captain of Unit Zero; investigating the Hell's Portal. While the sequel's graphics are well-rendered and the musical score is just as good as -if not better than- the first game, fans are split on the game's newer character imbalance. Characters are no longer equal, set with a greater difference of strengths and weaknesses than before. Some of the previous titles' characters were weakened greatly, requiring much more skill to master (ie: Yuki, Kagami, Kaede) and others can overpower the rest unfairly through pure button-mashing (ie: Mukuro, Setsuna, Okina). The &quot;EX&quot; mode has its share of detractors as well, most panning it as being too rule-breaking or a shallow addition to an already complex game. Regardless of its criticisms, it's still regarded as one of the finest games to have ever graced the Neo Geo in both story scenario and graphics.<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;The Last Blade 2&quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "134731": {"rpgdesigner": ["Ryan Nock"], "rpg": ["Pathfinder System Compatible Product"], "poll": [], "name": "The Dying Skyseer (Pathfinder)", "rpgartist": ["Brian Patterson", "Claudio Pozas", "Dede Putra", "Jonathan Roberts", "ShenFei"], "rpgproducer": ["Thurston Hillman", "Eric Life-Putnam", "Russell Morrissey"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1497829.png", "usersrated": "0", "rpgitemversion": ["PDF version"], "average": "0", "statistics": [], "rpggenre": ["Fantasy", "Steampunk"], "rpgpublisher": ["EN Publishing"], "rpgcategory": ["Scenario / Adventure / Module"], "rpgseries": ["Zeitgeist: The Gears of Revolution"], "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1497829_t.png", "description": "From publisher blurb:<br/><br/>Welcome to the second adventure in the ZEITGEIST adventure path!<br/><br/>This is the PATHFINDER RPG version of this adventure.<br/><br/>Summer smog conceals the skies over Flint, and the skyseers, once able to foretell the future in the wheeling heavens, are blind and discredited.<br/><br/>Unnatural tremors shake the city.

The starting configuration for four players is as follows: each player selects one board corner and places his nine mole tiles in the square at that corner and the eight squares on the board sides closer to that corner, four tiles on each side of the corner tile. For two players: opposite corners are occupied. For three players: three corners are occupied.<br/><br/>During a player's turn a tile must be moved. The possible moves are:<br/><br/>a) any tile can be moved in all directions (diagonal or orthogonal) to an adjacent empty space but not to a square with a mole cave symbol or with a 'busy' tile on it.<br/><br/>b) Push: a tile is moved onto an occupied square, pushing the original tile in the direction of movement as well as all tiles that were continuously connected to the original tile in the line of movement. If a tile is pushed into a mole cave, it stays there until it is pushed out. It cannot move out on its own. Exception: pushing is not possible if it results in a tile going off the board or else a 'busy' tile would be moved.<br/><br/>When a tile lands in a tunnel entrance, the player must dig immediately, i.e., the token must be placed to any other free tunnel entrance. If a tile is passively pushed to a tunnel entrance, nothing happens during this turn; but if the tile still stands on a tunnel entrance or was pushed on it and it is the player's turn, this must dig immediately.<br/><br/>A player who has occupied all four squares orthogonally adjacent to a mole cave must place a 'busy' tile there; this tile can no longer  be moved, but the four mole tiles are operational beginning the next turn.

His totem is the heavy hitter of the pair and, some would argue, the thing in charge. The Hungering Darkness not only can do damage but he can infect models with the Brilliance which it then uses to control and manipulate them. The Hungering Darkness has a parasitic relationship with the rest of its crew using them to keep itself fed with Brilliance.<br/><br/>Lynch is not the offensive powerhouse that his totem is, but he does bring several options to the table:<br/><br/>Ace in the Hole<br/>Lynch plays with two Red Jokers, because he's that kind of honest. The &quot;normal&quot; one, and just for him, as in, the Lynch model, the Ace of Masks counts as a red joker, i.e. 14 in duels and Severe damage. Nice, eh? Better really if you have it in your hand, because you're more likely to flip it for one your minions.<br/><br/>The Source<br/>A very straightforward spell, if you're on Brilliance (as most of his crew should be) then you get a small movement buff. Due to the small range of this aura, the models need to be beginning their activation close to Lynch, making this a good Turn 1 spell to help you get out of the gate that much faster, especially when combined with Mr. Graves and the push from Bar's Closed.<br/><br/>Dead Man's Hand<br/>This is Lynch's signature spell and probably where most of his action points are going to be spent. The spell allows you to draw three cards, adding them to your hand, and depending on the even/odd value of the card flipped, your opponent will either get to draw a card or be forced to discard one. This spell is especially useful for helping to stack your hand (as you will gain all three cards except for aces and eights) before going into a big push with the Hungering Darkness. Due to the random nature of the spell's effect on your opponent's hand, it is not a reliable way to drain their hand of cards, and will generally provide them with the ability to card cycle more than anything else.<br/><br/>Holdout Pistol<br/>Lynch has a reasonably decent Cb with his pistol, along with a middle of the road damage range and gunfighter, as you would expect with a pistol. The pistol does have a very interesting trigger, Malifaux Roulette, where rather than flipping damage as per usual, you instead randomly select a card from your opponent's hand. Based on the suit of this card, one of several effects is applied to the target model: This trigger is rather situational, but can see use if the target has high armor or your damage flip has several negative twists where the normal shot is unlikely to be of any serious utility. Most of the effects are debuffs (Paralyze, Poison, lowered stats) so if intending to use the trigger, try to pick a target that has yet to activate, where you'll get the most use out of the effect. Additionally, this trigger allows you to see a card in your opponent's hand, knowledge with is never bad. (Of note, if the card chosen is a Black Joker, your opponent gets to chose an effect to apply to Lynch instead!) His other pistol trigger, Pip the Ace, allows you to discard cards from your hand to receive additional positive twists to damage. This lets you discard low value cards from your hand to easily ramp up the pistol damage.<br/><br/>Slave To Darkness<br/>One of his signature abilities, this allows Lynch to place (not summon) the Hungering Darkness on the table whenever a model with Brilliance dies for the low price of two cards of the same value. The Hungering Darkness enters play with wounds equal to half the value of the cards, rounded up. Maximizing the amount of wounds that the Hungering Darkness comes in on is not necessarily a high priority, as it is a Spirit and has multiple ways to heal itself. Although this ability is not restricted and can be used when you kill one of your opponent's models, it will give them an entire activation to deal with the totem, as it does not immediately activate like the Dreamer or LCB. One common way to use this ability is to run a Depleted into a mass of your opponent's models. If it dies to a melee attack, it explodes, causing damage, spreading brilliance, and bringing in the Hungering Darkness.<br/><br/>The Illuminated are those who have been exposed to The Darkness' Brilliance for too long and it builds up inside them to turn them into tough, form shifting brawlers. It serves the role as a damage dealer and brilliance spreader when used with his preferred Master, Jakob.<br/><br/>"}, "134797": {"poll": [], "name": "The Coach's Box", "playingtime": "30", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": ["Grid Movement", "Simulation"], "yearpublished": "2010", "usersrated": "0", "boardgamefamily": ["Sports: Australian Football"], "maxplayers": "4", "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2281903_t.jpg", "average": "0", "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["(Self-Published)", "You do the Maths"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2281903.jpg", "boardgameversion": ["First edition"], "maxplaytime": "30", "boardgamecategory": ["Sports"], "age": "10", "minplaytime": "30", "description": "A game to simulate Australian Football...<br/><br/>Two coaches, or teams of coaches, place their teams on the field.

They're insignificant, unless within LOS of the hungering darkness.<br/><br/>The Depleted are the empty living shells of people who have been using Brilliance for too long, as such they are not combat monsters. They have a below average Cb value with a lower-end damage spread. These low stats can be slightly deceiving however, because the Depleted get a positive flip to damage against models with Brilliance and any model they wound receives one burning token, upping their damage potential a decent amount. This has some possible synergies with Iggy, the only other Neverborn minion who currently uses burning tokens and a Ht 1 Woe who can be taken in a Ten Thunders crew with Lynch.<br/><br/>Reduced to Cinders is a defense trigger with great offensive potential. When killed in melee with this trigger up, the Depleted explodes like a mini-Papa Loco, giving all models within 2&quot; 2 Dg and Brilliance. One important thing to note about this is that the depleted are Hard to Kill - This means you know when they're on one wound, and when they will be killed, so you will know exactly when to cheat in a crow (Preferably a low one), to trigger this.<br/><br/>The Depleted form the throw away tarpits and objective grabbers of Lynch's crew.<br/><br/>They can be startlingly fast once buffed up, capable of pushing 5&quot; towards a model with brilliance, then double walking another 10&quot; (or 12&quot; with The Source up), for a grand total of 15&quot;-17&quot; of movement in a turn, which ignores severe terrain. Although they are Insignificant on their own, this goes away when they have LoS to the Hungering Darkness. When given Reactivate by the Hungering Darkness, these guys can (1) interact with objectives up to 20&quot;-22&quot; away in a single turn, and the loss of such a cheap minion can be an acceptable trade for those final victory points. The push action also allows them to easily escape combat, making them very hard to lock in place.<br/><br/>Reduced to Cinders is an extremely useful way to get the Hungering Darkness into position. The Depleted gets thrown up into the enemy lines and dies, exploding for damage and handing out Brilliance.

They are particularly suitable to be added to the Dark Debts crew.<br/><br/>From the Malifaux Tactica Wiki page:<br/>The Beckoner is the Rotten Belle of Lynch's crew, and is just as essential to him as the Belles are to Seamus. They also hold the dubious honor of being the first ladies of the night in the game that are not zombies.<br/><br/>Beckoners are control pieces and function to pull enemy models into your crew and spread the Brilliance characteristic at range. They have a gun, Honeyed Words, with a moderate range that attacks Wp instead of Df and ignores cover. Models damaged by this attack receive the Brilliance characteristic. Their gun also has a highly useful trigger, First Taste's Free. This trigger reduces a target's Wp or Df by 1 and is cumulative. Additionally, the debuff does not end during the Closing Phase, but rather last's until the Beckoner's next activation. This trigger makes them an attractive (pun intended) option for Zoriada or Pandora crews, both of which are heavily dependent on Wp effects. One strategy would be to have the Beckoner activate early in one turn, apply the debuffs, and then activate late the next turn; giving the maximum length of time for the debuffs to be in effect. In addition to the gun they have a melee attack with their nails, which has a low damage spread but automatically provides poison.<br/><br/>Come Hither<br/>This is the bread and butter spell of the Beckoner and the reason for taking them in a Lynch crew. This spell works in a very similar way to Lure, pushing the target toward the Beckoner and then moving her toward it. The twist is that if the target has Brilliance than they push their charge rather than their walk, and the Beckoner has a trigger where if the two models end within melee range of each other, the spell target gains Brilliance. This spell works for your crew on several levels, pulling enemy models away from the safety of their crews or away from objectives, providing Brilliance at range, and if they end the move in melee range of a Beckoner, locking that enemy down with a model that they cannot hit due to Irresistible and Don't Bite the Hand.<br/><br/>Sales Pitch<br/>This spell removes AP from a target's next activation, 1 per mask in the Ca value. This can be used to neuter an opponent's heavy hitter for one turn, but be aware that the spell only effects general AP and targets can still use AP generated by Melee Expert, Casting Expert, etc.<br/><br/>The Party Never Ends<br/>The reason other than Come Hither that the Beckoner gets taken in Lynch crews--all models within 6&quot; of the Beckoner do not lose the Brilliance characteristic at the end of the turn.<br/><br/>The Beckoner's optimal turn occurs when they begin within 12&quot; of a target. The first AP is used to fire their Honeyed Words attack at a target model, wounding it and giving it Brilliance. They then use the (0) action Know My Client to buff their stats versus models with the Brilliance characteristic. Finally they cast Come Hither on the original target (relatively easy with a Ca of 8), pushing that target its charge towards the Beckoner and the rest of your crew.<br/><br/>"}, "134801": {"poll": [], "name": "Malifaux: Mr Graves", "playingtime": "0", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": ["Campaign / Battle Card Driven"], "yearpublished": "0", "boardgameexpansion": ["Malifaux"], "usersrated": "3", "maxplayers": "0", "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1501434_t.jpg", "average": "6.66667", "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["Wyrd Miniatures"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1501434.jpg", "boardgameversion": ["First edition"], "maxplaytime": "0", "boardgamecategory": ["Expansion for Base-game", "Fantasy", "Horror", "Miniatures", "Wargame"], "age": "12", "minplaytime": "0", "description": "Mr. Graves is an expansion unit for Malifaux.

You start by choosing one of 17 different characters, e.g. Necromancer, Demonologist, Dwarf Queen, Troll King or maybe a High Priestess of Ba'al. The different character classes vary wildly in what special abilities they have and what parts of the world they should focus on conquering. E.g. the Demonologist needs sacrifices that you gain from towns and villages, but the Druid want special herbs that are found in forests. But of course gold is always good to have, so all classes can make use of a gold or silver mine, but only the Enchanter can make a Gold Golem out of it.<br/><br/>The Witch can use fungus to summon a Catoblepas whose gaze can annihilate an entire row of enemies per turn. The Demonologist can summon powerful demon lords, but only if he is reckless because the likelihood of a demon lord attacking his summoner is quite high. Careful Demonologists make use of the lesser summoning that are also powerful when compared to mortal men. The Warlock can summon an immortal Phoenix. The Phoenix explodes when it dies and then swiftly reforms in the home citadel of its owner. In short the main thing about this game is the amount of features and special abilities that can be used.<br/><br/>Someone described the game as a strategy roguelike and I think that is a quite good description. It plays fast and you can die quickly if you are unlucky. Worlds are randomly generated, so no two games are the same. It is also an unfair game, random events can wreak havoc upon the world and game changing monsters or locations can be encountered.<br/><br/>"}, "134824": {"image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1443960.jpg", "poll": [], "boardgamedesigner": ["Susan McKinley Ross"], "statistics": [], "boardgamecompilation": ["Qwirkle", "Qwirkle: Erweiterung 1"], "yearpublished": "2012", "maxplayers": "4", "age": "6", "boardgamepublisher": ["MindWare", "Schmidt Spiele"], "maxplaytime": "45", "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1443960_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "45", "boardgamecategory": ["Abstract Strategy"], "description": "Qwirkle Big Box includes both the Qwirkle base game and two expansions: Qwirkle Select and Qwirkle Connect.

Using a normal deck of playing cards (and a 12-sided dice if you prefer to roll dice instead of flip cards), with a few simple charts that also follow the same mechanic, you can play out a myriad of matches where wrestler's do all the moves you see on TV.<br/> With MDG, you can play solo - booking matches, running segments and interviews, &amp; playing out the matches with run-ins from other wrestlers (or not) - all of which go into making a wrestling show.  The only difference? You won't know how this script is going to play out. Those matches and segments will affect the company you are trying to run, growing it into a global phenomen or watching it crumble before your eyes.<br/> Of course, you can also play in a group adding one, very important element - each person takes the role (or several roles) of a wrestler. Narrate a segment or cut a promo on your opponent and it will impact the mechanics of the game and your wrestler&rsquo;s options in the ring. And once the bell rings, not only does the mechanics allow you to choose what moves your wrestler does, but it gives you a beginning set of tactics drawn from the real-life wrestling world, tactics to attempt (each with their own advantages and disadvantages). As for those not directly involved in the match, they'll be the crowd and impact the match in a very real way.<br/> This FULL RULEBOOK adds several different match-types (cage, extreme, tag, triangle, battle royal). In addition, the advanced rules continue adding depth by introducing aspects to the game mechanic that turn up the realism such as: Counter ability, Weight &amp; Height, Manager's impact, Intimidation,  Stamina (fatigue, injury, tag team fatigue, wearing an opponent down, wrestling with injuries), blood, referees that impact the match, wrestler's individual advantages &amp; disadvantages, how to make a wrestler and let him grow into an Icon of the wrestling world as well as a world for that wrestler to exist - including 21 original, fully illustrated wrestlers existing within a backdrop as wide-open as your imagination.

Teseo departed to end this foul doing. In Creta met Arianna, Minosse' daughter, that fell in love with him and reveled him the greatest labyrinth secret: the strength of the Minotaur came from 4 magic Talismans created by Minosse, infusing the creature's soul in them. The only way to kill the Minotaur was to divide the Talisman. Teseo did it, after avoiding the maze traps, than fought the man-bull, killing it after a fierce battle. <br/>Hundreds of years later, a greedy hand was going to get the last of the four mighty artifacts, not caring about the warning Teseo carved on the maze wall &ldquo;Never gather what has been divided&rdquo;. A tremor shook the walls and with a loud roar the central labyrinth section collapsed, filling the air with a cloud of hundreds years old dust. A scary and inhuman scream echoed through the stone corridors and while the dust fell down, a huge shape with pointed horns and a large, sharp axe in hand slowly appeared.<br/><br/>Minosse is a labyrinth game in which four player compete to collect talismans and to get out before the Minotaur catches them.<br/><br/>The board is created by randomly placing tiles in a 8&times;8 square, with the four goal squares in the center, and with adventurers' starting tiles in the four corners.<br/><br/>The game is divided into 3 phases:<br/><br/>     In the first phases the adventurers run toward the center of the labyrinth to get the first talisman. First one to arrive chooses first. To do this, each player gets 3 action points that can be used to rotate tiles, creating a free path to the center, to move from one tile to the next one (as long as you have a connected hallway. Note: these AP (action points) can rotate any tile, so you can use them to slow opponents, disrupting their path. With he first talisman, you also earn a God favor. Talisman power recharges with time, after you use it; God favor is a one shoot power to help you win.<br/>     The second phase starts after everyone gets one talisman. Adventurers must collect the other 3 talismans to complete the ancient artifact. The rules are the same as the first phase, 3 AP for rotating tiles, moving, and activating Talismans where needed.<br/>     When the first adventurer collects the fourth talisman phase 3 begins. The labyrinth center crumbles, and the exit appears. The exit is guarded by the Minotaur, who'll try to catch everyone that got all the four talismans. After each adventurer's turn, the Minotaur moves. Each player secretly lays down a card with a direction and they reveal them all together. The Minotaur moves according to cards. If the Minotaur hits an adventurer with 4 talismans, he badly slows him down. The winner is first adventurer to reach the exit carrying four talismans.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>"}, "134845": {"boardgamedesigner": ["Ugo Ciaccio"], "poll": [], "name": "Best Seller: Il Gioco dell'editore", "playingtime": "20", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": ["Hand Management", "Set Collection", "Trading"], "yearpublished": "2012", "usersrated": "0", "maxplayers": "4", "average": "0", "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["Homo Scrivens"], "boardgameversion": ["First edition"], "maxplaytime": "20", "boardgamecategory": ["Card Game"], "age": "6", "minplaytime": "20", "description": "Card game in which each player is a publisher trying to be the first to publish a best-seller.

At the start of your turn, draw a card. If at any time you run out of cards, replenish your hand by drawing five more cards from the deck.<br/><br/>On your turn you may place one herd animal face up in front of you, either a zebra or an antelope.

Lions, elephants and giraffes are your action cards.<br/><br/>To play a lion, place it face up in front of you. When you have played a second lion, you now have Matching Lions. Your matching lions can be used to chase away two animals from one other player&rsquo;s herds. They can chase away 2 zebras, 2 antelopes, or 1 zebra and 1 antelope. The animals all go into the discard pile. You may use your matching lions on the turn you play the 2nd lion, or you may wait and use them on another turn, after playing your action card for your turn. If you gather several pairs of matching lions in front of you, you may use them all on one turn to chase away other players&rsquo; herd animals if you choose.<br/><br/>When you play an elephant, everyone, including you, must pick up their lions and put them back in their hand. The elephant then goes to the discard pile.<br/><br/>When you play a giraffe, you may choose any other player and view all the cards in their hand. The giraffe then goes to the discard pile.<br/><br/>Other animals:<br/><br/>The hippopotamus is a defense card. Play the hippopotamus to block a pair of lions from chasing away any of your herd animals. The hippopotamus and the pair of lions all go to the discard pile.<br/><br/>The hyena is automatically played when it is drawn. All herd animals migrate left, meaning your herds go to the player to your left, that person&rsquo;s herds go to the player to their left, and so on until every herd has migrated. The hyena goes to the discard pile, and you get to draw again and start your turn.

Its square, wood pieces are either red or black (with their designations painted on in gold paint) and placed on red squares only.  Players' halves of the board are separated by a &quot;chinese wall&quot; that marks the boundary of their home court vs. their enemy court.  Each player has the following pieces: 1 Emperor, 1 Empress, 3 Princes, 5 Guards, and 5 Archers.  To begin a game, the pieces are arranged as follows: the red square in the player's lower left corner has a pagoda and gets the Empress, the red square in the lower right corner has a crown and gets the Emperor, between them (in the row nearest the player) are the 3 Princes, on the next row's red squares are placed the 5 Guards, and on the third row's red squares are placed the 5 Archers.<br/><br/>Players then roll dice every turn to determine how many moves each may make, depending on the difference between the numbers they have rolled.  Moves may be made with any combination of the player's pieces, for example: one piece moving three times in a row, or three pieces each moving once.  The pieces are moved only on red squares, with each type of piece having its own type of moving privilege.  Movements must be from one red square to the next unoccupied red square; if the next square is occupied by an enemy piece but the one after is not, the enemy piece must be jumped and removed from the board, and points are scored depending on the point value for that type of piece.<br/><br/>Archers may only move towards enemy court until they reach the enemy's home row and are then turned over to become Princes. Guards, while in home court, may only move towards enemy court, but having crossed the Chinese Wall can then move in either direction.  When a Guard reaches the enemy's home row it becomes a Prince.  Emperor, Empress, and Princes may move in either direction from the start.<br/><br/>The winning player removes both his enemy's Emperor and Empress by jumping.  Point totals have accrued throughout the game, and the instructions are not clear as to what this has to do with the ending outcome, though the text on the cover of the game box indicates these scoring rules may be optional.

You can choose any brick except the green one, which is the pukemaster. Now you pick a challenge with your opponents that the looser shall do. You roll the dice to figure out who starts. <br/>The game mecanic is dice rolling. The teams throw the dice in turns and move the brick until the number is stated on the cube. Every field you land on from now has a picture that refers to the challenge card. The challenge card states what must happen when a person lands on a field. This could be &quot;Give a Pitch&quot; which means that one team should sing 10 seconds of a song, then point at another team that has to continue the singing in 10 seconds. If they can, your team have to drink two sips, if they cannot then they have to drink three sips. <br/>The reason that you cannot pick the pukemaster is that when you land on his field, then you have to down your drinks and become the pukemaster that takes sips when everyone else does.

Eight levels of difficulty make the games challenging and fun for both seven-year-olds and expert linguists alike.<br/><br/>If that is not enough, Jabbergrammar gives you the tools to create even more sentences of varying complexity, absurdity, or silliness. Jabbergrammar can be described as an editor, utility, builder program--but it is more. It is a language language. It lets you add, change, or delete words in the data files, creating entirely new and extraordinary vocabulary lists; it lets you put the vocabulary into whatever sentence pattern or syntax you wish. You can create sense or nonsense; you can use your newly-created sentences to play Alphagrammar or Cryptogrammar; you can generate entirely new words (preantiwordishness? unrutabagalihood?).<br/><br/>Free Verse lets you see your creations, gives hints about the kinds of sentences generated for each skill level, manufactures party games by telling players what to do, and so on forever (almost).<br/><br/>When you play Jabbertalky, you can always have the last word.<br/><br/><br/>     Two different word games<br/>     Create your own vocabulary and syntax<br/>     For ages 7 through adult<br/>     Complexity: simple to extremely difficult<br/>     Playing time: 30 Minutes to hours of fun<br/>     For one to four players (more on a disk)<br/><br/><br/>"}, "134971": {"poll": [], "name": "Liquid Measure 3", "videogamemode": ["Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["Web Browser edition"], "average": "6.5", "videogametheme": ["Physics", "Puzzle"], "usersrated": "1", "videogamedeveloper": ["(Self-Developed Video Game)"], "videogamegenre": ["Puzzle", "Simulation", "Strategy"], "videogameplatform": ["Web Browser"], "statistics": [], "videogamepublisher": ["(Web published)"], "description": "User Summary<br/><br/>Water is contained in storage tanks.
