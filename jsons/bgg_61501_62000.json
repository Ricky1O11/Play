Hunted by the creatures of darkness, we had no culture, and only the most primitive of tools. We were brought out of Africa, our homeland, into strange places, where we evolved to fit the land. Our terror, the Vampires, fed on us, as did the Lycanthropes and the other Creatures of Night. They hunted herds of us as wild animals, and they exacted their price in blood.<br/><br/>Enoch, as we call him, changed everything. He is called many things: Thoth, Quetzalcouatl, Enoch, Viracocha, Prometheus; but always the story is the same. The God(s) sent him to teach us the things we needed to know to push back the hated Creatures of Darkness. For a long time, the battle between Light and Darkness was a seesaw conflict, but eventually the Light triumphed through the Nullity, which made all the supernatural ineffective, including our own magic.<br/><br/>People's belief in Science was what powered the Nullity, and with that power slowly fading, the Nullity covered less and less. The supernatural creatures began spreading out of the isolated backwaters they had been penned in for so long, although scientists dismissed these sightings as hallucinations and fabrications.<br/><br/>Thus, we, the forces of Light, the heirs of Enoch, again have both the need and the means to pick up the challenge thrown by the Dark. Unless we hold the forces of Darkness at bay, civilization will crumble again, and the Darkness will cover all.<br/><br/>Blood Games II is set in the real world, anywhere from the Renaissance to today.<br/><br/>In Blood Games II, the players play the role of individuals from different walks of life who have joined forces to fight the Creatures of the Night. These individuals may be one of two types:<br/><br/>Path Characters are subtly enhanced normal humans who have been chosen to serve as champions by various parties. Some have the ability to cast powerful magics or miracles. Some are imbued with uncanny luck. Many are strongly religious in character, while others are not.<br/><br/>Non-Path Characters are normal people who use their various skills in any way they can. Virtually all of these people have been hurt by the Creatures of Night in one way or another and have determined to resist them. Most have odd little quirks which develop from facing the horrors of the supernatural, but they have no control over these quirks.<br/><br/>There are others, as well. Half Angels are born with powers, but they themselves choose whether to use them for the Light or the Dark. Immortals can never die unless, just maybe, they complete what they are supposed to do, and they can rest.<br/><br/>Religion is vital to the game. Many of the paths are religious in nature, and the reality of some greater being or beings helping humanity is a central fact. Blood Games is not, however, tied to any one religion.<br/><br/>Blood Games II is about courage, self sacrifice, and desperate heroism with no hope of reward.<br/><br/>Blood Games II uses the StarCluster System, with the new StarPool d20 dice pool task resolution system.<br/><br/>"}, "61537": {"boardgamedesigner": ["Christoph Puhl", "Arno Steinwender"], "poll": [], "name": "Deutschland-Wissen", "playingtime": "0", "minplayers": "2", "yearpublished": "2009", "usersrated": "0", "boardgamefamily": ["Country: Germany"], "maxplayers": "4", "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1010855_t.png", "average": "0", "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["Noris Spiele"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1010855.png", "boardgameversion": ["Noris Spiele Edition 2009"], "maxplaytime": "0", "boardgamecategory": ["Educational", "Trivia"], "age": "12", "minplaytime": "0", "description": "The players have to mark locations on a map of Germany.

The idea was to create a set of skirmish rules that were quick to play, fun, colourful and different to other rule sets. We wanted to play games featuring mythical warriors such as Robin Hood, Achilles and King Arthur, and historical legends like Alexander of Macedon, Frederick Barbarossa and William the Conqueror.<br/><br/>The focus of development was therefore to create rules that favoured the heroes and legends of past centuries at the expense of the common soldier. Death or Glory (DoG) does this, and makes such heroes and legends quite literally deadly on the tabletop. BUT, and this is a big but, they are not unbeatable. If you charge King Arthur into a unit of enemy warriors on his own, with no support or strategy and it&rsquo;s going to hurt - or could even be fatal! But use him as he should be, a legendary fighter, and he will carve his away around a battlefield - just as he does in the movies.<br/><br/>The idea is to use DoG to re-enact scenes from a movie, book or graphic novel, or make up your own encounters using lots of models. Whether you have Leonidas cutting a path through Persian Immortals to save an injured companion, or Jason trying to fight his way through skeletons to the safety of his ship, DoG is perfect for recreating such encounters.<br/><br/>This rulebook loosely covers the Dark Ages, as the statistic cards that are provided are for fairly generic European warriors with chain armour and large shields. There are also two specific lists with statistic cards for Norse and Saxon warriors. Additional supplements and/or downloads will be made available from the Downloads section of this web site.<br/><br/>The DoG rules have now been fully playtested and are being designed, ready for printing. We anticipate that shops will have stock of the rule book in late 2009. DoG will be a full colour, perfect bound 96-page book.<br/><br/>"}, "61613": {"image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic605366.jpg", "poll": [], "boardgamedesigner": ["Manfred Reindl"], "statistics": [], "yearpublished": "2009", "maxplayers": "4", "boardgameartist": ["Mirko Suzuki"], "boardgamepublisher": ["KOSMOS"], "maxplaytime": "15", "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic605366_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "15", "boardgamecategory": ["Action / Dexterity", "Children's Game", "Memory", "Novel-based"], "description": "There are task cards which show four of the five pictures in the game.

Our enemy is a race of demons from beyond the dimensional barrier that surrounds Earth. They seek to warp the world, to taint it with their magic, and through that taint, control it.<br/><br/>We are the Thaumaturgia, their greatest foe. The founder of our Order knew of the danger these demons posed to our world, for they were already here, working their evil and slowly taking over our world. He gathered around him powerful mages and created the Kandris Seal, an artifact that forced the demons back into their own dimension and keeps them out to this day.<br/><br/>The war has expanded beyond us now, with new powers entering the arena. Paranormals are being recruited or created by the demons and their followers, and it is starting to tip the balance in their favor. We must do as they have and start looking beyond our numbers to find allies. If we cannot tell them the truth about the war, then the least we can do is point them in the right direction.<br/><br/>The Kandris Seal is a modern d20 compatible campaign sourcebook and can be used as an independent campaign setting, or incorporated into an existing campaign world. It contains everything GMs and players need to adventure in the world of The Kandris Seal.<br/><br/><br/>     Full write ups of the Keepers of the Broken Circle, the demons trying to conquer Earth's dimension, and the power they wield, known as Chaos.<br/>     The history of the Thaumaturgia and information on how to create your own members of the Order.<br/>     How to create characters touched by the Chaos Taint.<br/>     New spells and magic items.<br/>     Over 50 character write ups.<br/>     Information on how to adapt The Kandris Seal to your campaign.<br/>     Four adventures and ten adventure seeds.<br/><br/><br/>"}, "61694": {"rpgdesigner": ["Lars Braune", "Frank M\u00fcller", "Erik Winter"], "rpgitemversion": ["Softcover version"], "poll": [], "name": "Chronosaurus", "rpgartist": ["D.

There&rsquo;s also that new-fangled<br/>D20 version with classes, hit points, and<br/>levels. Steve Jackson Games&reg; even makes<br/>GURPS&reg; Deadlands, for perhaps the most<br/>realistic version of the three!<br/><br/>But now Pinnacle has this new &quot;Fast!<br/>Furious! Fun!&quot; set of rules called Savage<br/>Worlds, and some of you have a hankerin&rsquo; to<br/>try it out on the Weird West. It&rsquo;s only natural<br/>that you do, since Savage Worlds is based off<br/>the Deadlands miniatures game, The Great<br/>Rail Wars.<br/><br/>We&rsquo;ve always been pretty proud of that<br/>game-it&rsquo;s won every major award out there<br/>and still has a huge following despite our not<br/>being able to support it the way we originally<br/>set out to.<br/><br/>Now we&rsquo;ve come full circle, and a lot of<br/>folks want to play both Deadlands and The<br/>Great Rail Wars with Savage Worlds, which has<br/>some nifty new tweaks from the experience<br/>of five years and thousands of players.

They both want to launch a new product into the market, for which they need the same intermediate product. Step by step you conceptualize this intermediate product by collecting the right cards and placing them on the board. Be careful though, because every player is approached by different manufacturers and will do everything to get control over the intermediate product, which appears on the board.<br/><br/>Explanation<br/><br/>Conceptualize This! is a card game in which every player gets a unique target. During the game you try to collect cards which &quot;connect&quot; to each other in a dominos like way. The set of cards you collect results in a concept of the intermediate product, build up out of different components that need each other to function. The board supports the concept of tile (card) placement in such a way that the connections between the cards are made visible. The game is won by the player who completes his / her concept of the intermediate product on the board.<br/><br/>Background<br/><br/>The development on this board game started as an element of a Bachelor thesis. For the research in this thesis the board game was meant to educate people on how to model UML activity diagrams (a diagram in which the necessities and results of a series of actions are modelled) in a fast and easy way. During the creation of the board game the accent moved to a system diagram (a diagram in which the necessities and results of a series of components are modelled) which gave more freedom in the creation of cards. Because the concepts used in both modelling languages are the same, people should still be able to create an activity diagram after playing the game.<br/><br/>At first the game seemed to have a very high luck rate, but closer to completion the game turned out to be tactical as well. Due to this development a few extra rules were included which made the game even more tactical and increased the replay value.<br/><br/>The research on the Bachelor thesis for which this board game is created is still in progress. The board game itself however is completed and only needs to be stylised. If a publisher can be found the game will be published in the future. Currently both Dutch and English versions can be previewed by publishers.<br/><br/>"}, "61715": {"boardgamedesigner": ["M\u00e4ndu Stauffer"], "poll": [], "name": "Die verflixte 8", "playingtime": "0", "minplayers": "2", "yearpublished": "1988", "boardgameexpansion": ["Carambole"], "usersrated": "0", "maxplayers": "4", "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1185675_t.jpg", "average": "0", "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["Carambole"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1185675.jpg", "maxplaytime": "0", "boardgamecategory": ["Action / Dexterity", "Expansion for Base-game"], "age": "8", "minplaytime": "0", "description": "Expansion f&uuml;r Carambole.

There were plans to invade Siberia in concert with the climax of the Wehrmacht's Operation Typhoon.  In it's most ambitious form, it proposed a land invasion of India by the Imperial Japanese Army, with great assistence from Subhas Chandra Bose and the Indian National Army.  Meanwhile German forces would seize Egypt and the Caucusus but not stop until panzers could parade in front of the Taj Mahal!  In the end, Yamamoto and the Imperial Japanese Navy won the internal power struggle - the American Pacific fleet and Allied colonies in Asia became the target of the Rising Sun and Operation Orient became just a footnote in history books.  But what if Yamamoto didn't have his way?  One can only imagine the frightful threat of a truly coordinated Axis effort.

The response was overwhelming -- game fans wanted to see how these new, experimental rules worked.<br/><br/>Because you demanded it!<br/><br/>So Monte took a break from his fiction work to compile this book, a collection of the house rules he currently uses in his own games. These include a spell progression system that ranks spells from levels 1 to 20, new rules for healing and curative magic, magical disciplines for spellcasters that always give them an active power and a way to contribute, and much more.<br/><br/>This book also includes a new base class, the runeblade, for players wanting a character that combines magic and martial skill without the use of spells. New rules for wizards, clerics, druids, paladins, and rangers are provided, offering each class magical disciplines like Godhammer, Eldritch Bolt, and Nature's Senses. And, of course, the book also offers dozens of new spells, feats, and magic items.<br/><br/>Inherent within all the rule changes in this book is the idea that characters should be able to keep adventuring longer than the rules currently allow. Disciplines, more ample healing, and the other experiments in this supplement help bring down the barriers -- like casters running out of spells and characters running low on hit points -- that traditionally make parties stop to rest before they really want to.<br/><br/>Start your own experiment now!<br/><br/>"}, "61784": {"rpgdesigner": ["Darrin Drader"], "rpgitemversion": ["PDF Version", "Softcover Version"], "statistics": [], "name": "Reign of Discordia", "rpgartist": ["Empty Room Studios", "Robert P.

Quick to take advantage of their weakened position, French forces moved in by sea, seeking to regain a foothold in North America. Their forces were more disciplined, more determined, and better equipped than the forces of the Mexican Army, and soon France was calling Texas a French Territory. The United States of America, while wary of their new neighbors, had no cause for war, and left the Republic to their own devices. No Texan was comfortable living under French Rule, however, and the native tribes were divided, some siding with the French and others preferring the devil they knew to this new invader.<br/><br/>Texans began to fight back. Not all at once, but slowly and surely, the movement began.

Colonies and space stations dot the Solar System and the first steps to other stars are about to be taken. You play an Immortal, either part of the public face of the Council of Immortals or hidden amongst the masses. Either way, you work to guide humanity and stop the insidious influence of the Dark Summoners. Dark Summoners are people who can summon entities from the Rift and use them to control mortals like puppets.<br/><br/>Immortals have been around since the dawn of man. In ancient times they were the heroes of myth. However, during Roman times a Council was formed and Immortals decided to let normal mortals define the shape of the world to come. Immortals retreated from sight.<br/><br/>The plan worked well for 2000 years. In secret Immortals worked to limit the damage done by the Dark Summoners. However, the numbers of Dark Summoners grew until the conflict engulfed the world in war in the late 19th century. Secrecy was no longer possible and after the victory of the Immortals and their mortal allies, the Council of Immortals decided to take on a guiding role in the world. It was a Golden Time of art and science and it took humanity into space.<br/><br/>The game uses a fairly simple set of rules and you&rsquo;ll need up to 5d6 for each player and the GM.<br/><br/>INTRODUCTION<br/>In case you had already guessed &lsquo;Immortalis&rsquo; is the latin word for immortal and that is what the player characters are.<br/><br/>First of all you should probably be an experienced GM or player. I will not be explaining about what roleplaying is, define many common roleplaying terms or include a lot of the other things you find written at the start of many rpgs. Consequently, you should probably already know that stuff and have done it all before.<br/><br/>These rules may be copied or printed freely, so long as I&rsquo;m given credit. However, they may not be sold or used for profit by anyone but me.<br/><br/>WHAT DO YOU NEED?<br/>You&rsquo;ll need up to 5d6 for the GM and each player. I&rsquo;ve also included a character sheet at the end.<br/><br/>THE SETTING<br/>This game is set in an alternate version of the current day. There are colonies on several moons and planets in the Solar System and fusion-powered ships ply the space lanes between. Some believe that the first step between the stars has been taken.

To develop your civilization, you must distribute, collect and share resources with other players. But if the players overexploit the resources and develop too quickly, they impoverish the land, the water will rise and the play area will get smaller. Additionally you can take the competing populations and force them to work as slaves, but you must also work to keep your population from turning into fanatics or becoming enslaved. The players earn points for both how developed their civilization is and how sustainable it is.<br/><br/>"}, "61997": {"rpgdesigner": ["D. Acre", "W. G. Armintrout", "Nick Atlas", "James L.

Given the hatred it inspires, what sort of person chooses this dark path? Who among us chooses to be an outcast, a pariah, even a target of the inquisition? With its dabblings in blood and corrupted flesh, graveyards and abattoirs, unclean spirits and immoral scoundrels, what is the appeal of this dark art?<br/><br/>Secret College of Necromancy, second in Green Ronin's Arcana series, answers all these questions and more.
