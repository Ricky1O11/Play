From this deck of cards each player draws cards and collects resources. Units (peasants and squires) can then be played from the hand. The peasants can be upgraded (rotated) to buildings, and squires can become various military units. The military units can be sent to the frontlines to gain victory points (VPs), or they can attack opposing towns. When the last card is removed from the deck, the game ends and VPs are counted.<br/><br/>Tactical options include choosing units to play, waiting for the perfect timing to play them, optimizing the actions, and playing the right events. At first glance, it may seem too simple, but new depths can certainly be discovered.<br/><br/>Brawling Barons can be played in 10-20 minutes by two experienced players. Three-player games take about 30 minutes.

The game mixes some &quot;original&quot; Morphology rules like &quot;Everybody Play&quot; and &quot;Pick 5&quot; with some new adaptations, including &quot;Morph&quot; (where the Morphologist becomes a piece in the game) and &quot;Ribbit, Ribbit&quot; (where the Morphologist can make noises to help his/her teammates guess the right word).<br/><br/>....<br/><br/>In Morphology Junior, players form into up to 4 teams.  Each team gets a delightful plastic team frog marker to mark their place along the lilypad themed game board.<br/><br/>After deciding if the players will use the easy or hard sides of the clue cards (or perhaps kids use easy and adults use hard?) the first team to play chooses their first Morphologist who will create the word on the card from a collection of bits including colored cubes, a black string, glass baubles, wooden planks and little wooden 'people'.<br/><br/>In basic play, the Morphologist is a puppeteer and cannot spell out words or symbols, make any sounds other than a small amount of grunting and encouraging for guess feedback, and cannot interact directly with the pieces.  The rulebook gives the example of 'toothbrush' and how the Morphologist can't pretend to brush their own teeth but they can brush the teeth of the little wooden figure.<br/><br/>Some of the lily pad spaces can change this though.  Everyone Plays allows both teams to guess what the current Morphologist is building.  Interception allows an opposing team to guess if the current team doesn't guess correctly by the time the timer runs down. Morph! allows the Morphologist to be a piece as well, so go ahead and brush YOUR teeth!  Pick 5 forces the Morphologist to choose just 5 props to use after looking at the word. Pick 5 + 1 however allows the opposing teams to choose the 5 props and the Morphologist gets to add just one more prop after reading the word.  And finally there is Ribbit! Ribbit! where the Morphologist can make noises!<br/><br/>Correct guesses allow a team to move their frog to the next lily pad.

Huzzah!<br/><br/>2nd Edition was wonderful and unique. Not only did it maintain most of the game's 1st Edition mechanics, but it created more options for the player and delivered to the Game Master a horde of awesome product. Game Masters had at their fingertips the most distinct and downright awesome campaign worlds ever designed - worlds teeming with dungeons, dragons and epic struggles of man. To boot, TSR published a decade's worth of material, so we all had uncountable sources of inspiration and adventure. In the end, 2nd Edition proved to be an exceptional arena for adventure and story-telling. A lot of material still lingers in bookshelves and closets. A lot of memories still linger, as well.<br/><br/>It was a great time for gaming.<br/><br/><br/>Myth &amp; Magic - 2E Revived!<br/><br/>Enter Myth &amp; Magic, a fantasy tabletop roleplaying game that brings back 2E and it brings it back better than ever. Myth &amp; Magic retains so much of what made 2E so damn great and at the same time cleans up and modernizes a few of the mechanics.<br/><br/>Why the update? Well, for starters, we want to make the experience a bit smoother and aligned with today's gaming expectations. No clunkiness or downright strangeness. But, even more importantly, we want to attract gamers that never played 2E, gamers that started with 3E or later, a segment that comprises the lion's share of today's gaming market. We want to create a thriving player base.<br/><br/>I honestly can't express how much we love 2E and the memories we have playing it. That love is evident in the quality of the Myth &amp; Magic experience. We want to share that experience with all gamers, from the old guard to the new school alike.<br/><br/>What is the Player's Guide?<br/><br/>This is a whopper of a book, with every rule and suggestion to create and play a heroic Myth &amp; Magic character.<br/><br/>     Races and Classes: Players choose from the legacy races (dwarf, elf, gnome, half-elf, halfling and human), and the half-orc, which has been updated as a core player race. The Player's Guide includes all the legacy classes as well: bard, cleric, druid, fighter, paladin, thief and wizard. We also brought forth the barbarian and monk as core classes, creating them in the spirit of 2E.<br/>     Proficiencies: Characters still choose weapon proficiencies to wield specific weapons, but players may now use weapon proficiency slots to specialize in a fighting style or combat maneuver. You can really individualize your character on the battlefield with your weapon proficiencies.<br/>     Noncombat System: The skill system is wide open. The attribute check really rules the day here, allowing characters to roll attribute checks when they wish to perform noncombat tasks. There is no preset list of skills. The entire noncombat system uses the BASE20 system, a streamlined mechanic that makes running and playing the game incredibly easy.<br/>     Nonweapon Proficiencies? Yes, we brought the entire nonweapon proficiency system forward. It works hand-in-hand with the open skill system. Nonweapon proficiencies represent specialized training. They provide a bonus to the attribute check to use the proficiency and also include a method for auto-successes. While anyone can attempt an attribute check to perform something under the purview of a nonweapon proficiency, a trained character has a markedly greater chance for success (even auto success).<br/>     Class Talents: This is a novel approach to individualizing members of the same class. In a way similar to kits, Myth &amp; Magic allows each player to create the type of class he or she wants to play. Class talents are chosen at character creation and at every 3rd level thereafter. They may seem, at first glance, similar to feats of 3.x, but there are huge differences between feats and class talents that become evident with play.<br/>     And More: Every piece of adventuring gear you would expect is included. Many of the spells you enjoyed in 2E appear in the book alongside brand new ones. There are rules for exploration and travel, as well as advice for alignments and hirelings. There's a whole bunch of game here!<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>"}, "129041": {"rpg": {"2791": "Pathfinder System Compatible Product"}, "statistics": {}, "name": "Earthdawn Game Master's Guide (Pathfinder Edition)", "rpgitemversion": {"175529": "PDF Version"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1946338.jpg", "usersrated": "0", "rpgsetting": {"976": "Barsaive"}, "rpgproducer": {"48031": "James Sutton"}, "rpggenre": {"155": "Fantasy (High Fantasy)"}, "average": "0", "rpgcategory": {"2130": "Alternate Rules (Variant Core Rules)"}, "poll": {}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1946338_t.jpg", "description": "A Land of Wondrous Beauty and Unspeakable Evil...<br/><br/>...When the Wizards proclaimed that the Scourge had ended, Jaro, I, and three others broke open the seals on the doors and walked outside.

The game board shows fourteen locations arranged so that each location touches a few others; each location has space for a suspect and crime tile. Shuffle the suspect tiles (12, plus two &quot;no suspect&quot;) and the crime tiles (10, plus four &quot;no crime&quot;), then place one face up in each location. Each suspect, crime and location is included in a deck of evidence cards, and nine evidence cards are revealed.<br/><br/>On a turn, a player either places an investigator, chooses an evidence card, or attempts to solve her case. When you place an investigator in a location, the player to your right looks at his case cards, then places a disc on this space for each case card he holds that matches the suspect, crime or location in this space. Additionally, he places a cube on this space for each suspect, crime or location that's adjacent to this space.<br/><br/>When you choose an evidence card, the player to your right places a disc on the matching tile if the card matches one of the case cards he holds, places a cube on the matching tile if this tile is adjacent to a tile matching one of the case cards he holds, or places nothing if you've made a wild-eyed guess and the tile isn't adjacent to anything.<br/><br/>To attempt to solve the case, you place a black token on your guesses.

The Lincoln Highway Road Trip comes with game pieces of a vintage gas pump, antique autos, compass, tourist cabin, postcard and suitcase as well as 200 trivia cards and fortune cards.<br/><br/>The game board reflects the regional part of the highway -- known as Route 30 -- in the six-county area from North Huntingdon at the Allegheny and Westmoreland County border to beyond Gettysburg. A grant from the Sprout Fund in Pittsburgh enabled the organization to develop the game and distribute it to upper elementary and middle schools along the region's 200-mile corridor. It was created by Alex Grab of Ligoni<br/><br/>Using pewter-like game pieces (vintage gas tank, suitcase, compass, tourist cabin, postcard and antique auto), players move along the highway beginning in Irwin. The goal is to be the first to travel the historic route through Westmoreland, Somerset, Bedford, Fulton, Franklin and Adams counties to Abbottstown in eastern Pa.<br/><br/>One of the 200 question cards reads: &ldquo;A volunteer highway crew is picking up debris along the side of the road near Buckstown. How long does it take for a Styrofoam cup to decompose?&rdquo; A. 20 years; B. 90 years; C. 150 years; or D. 400 years?&rdquo; The correct answer is 400 years.<br/><br/>Another is: &ldquo;The Mountain Playhouse and Green Gables Restaurant originally started as a sandwich stand.

Each member of the squad has a number of action points to spend on movement and combat. The player may freely alternate between characters and sequence moves and attacks in any order. Teammates are equipped with weapons and armor, gain experience and level up, and come in a wide range of classes determined by a combination of two talents. For example, the &quot;Stalker&quot; class is a combination of the &quot;Scout&quot; and &quot;Survivor&quot; talents, whereas the &quot;Devastator&quot; class is a combination of the &quot;Combat&quot; and &quot;Vengenace&quot; talents. A character's class determines roughly half of their skill tree, with the other half being standard across all classes. One skill point is awarded per level, with 10 being the level cap. This means that a complete &quot;build&quot; results from nine skill point allocations, making long-term planning an accessible but fairly deep part of the game right from the start.

It was first described in Lifeline, a newsletter dedicated to Conway's Life, in 1971.<br/><br/>In the Immigration game, players setup the game by taking turns and placing 5 pieces each of their color on a 25x25 rectangular grid.  Each position in the 25x25 grid can be either alive or dead, the living positions (or &ldquo;cells&rdquo;) are those that have a counter placed in them. Once setup is complete, the pieces are not moved and board positions evolve without player intervention according to the rules  of Conway&rsquo;s Game of Life, as listed below:<br/><br/>At each turn (or &ldquo;generation&rdquo;) the state of a cell is determined by the following rules:<br/><br/>1.     If a live cell has less than two neighbors in the eight neighboring cells, it dies in the next generation (&ldquo;loneliness&rdquo;)<br/><br/>2.     If a live cell has at two or three neighbors in the eight neighboring cells, it stays alive in the next generation.<br/><br/>3.     If a live cell has more than three neighbors in the eight neighboring cells, it dies in the next generation (&ldquo;overcrowding&rdquo;).<br/><br/>4.     If a dead cell has exactly three neighbors in the eight neighboring cells, it becomes alive in the next generation (&ldquo;reproduction&rdquo;).<br/><br/>New living cells, which come into being by having exactly 3 neighbors, take on the color of the majority of those three neighbors.  Note that all cells in the 25 x 25 board have 8 neighbors each as the board is considered to wrap around the edges to each opposite side.<br/><br/>After the 10th generation, the player with the most living cells is allowed to place a counter thus adding an additional live cell of his or her color, followed by a turn by the other player.  If both players have the same amount of live cells, generations continue to develop until one player has a majority, at which time the generations stop so players can place their new live cells and the process begins again.<br/><br/>Play continues this way until one of the players has no live cells left and the winning player is the only one with live cells on the board.<br/><br/>"}, "129089": {"rpgitemversion": {"175618": "PDF Version"}, "poll": {}, "name": "The Dream Merchants", "rpgproducer": {"38577": "Chris Bennett"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2288518.png", "usersrated": "0", "average": "0", "rpggenre": {"458": "Modern (Near Future)"}, "statistics": {}, "rpg": {"19272": "The Dream Merchants"}, "rpgcategory": {"2083": "Core Rules (min needed to play)"}, "rpgseries": {"20338": "Game Chef 2007: FunGameCorp"}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2288518_t.png", "description": "from 1km1kt<br/><br/>The Pitch: In the future&hellip;memory is currency.

Just dial a year and take off in time. You're looking for a bodacious bunch of historical heavyweights to bring back to San Dimas High. This is an excellent arcade / action adventure, but only the coolest of dudes will be triumphant!<br/><br/>Can you find the answer for Socrates the philos-o-fizer, take notes for Beethoven, fiddle with Nero and chill out with Joan of Arc (she's one hot chick, but it's &quot;Miss of Arc&quot; to you)? No way?! Yes, way! Genghis Khan likes Twinkies and Marie Antoinette is into cake, but how do you get Freud to leave his mother and get Mikey (Michaelangelo) off the ceiling? Don't forget that short, dead dude Napoleon, and there's Abe Lincoln and Billy the Kid. Plus, Uncle Al (relativ-ity) wanders randomly - hey, he's Einstein, whatcha gonna do!<br/><br/>The animation and graphics are incredible. There's stuff digitized right outta the movie and some really neat sounds. Whoa! There's even four levels of difficulty to make this totally not easy.<br/><br/>So be excellent to yourself and buy this computer game. Party on, dudes!<br/><br/>[Signatures]<br/><br/>Bill S.

This isn't as easy as it sounds, though, as they have to calculate the exact total for their purchase, and if they make a mistake, another hamster will be happy.<br/><br/>Aim of the game and how it is played: The aim of the game is to collect item cards with as many nuts printed on them as possible. Each item card also has a price printed on it. There is always one item card fewer at the center of the table than there are players. The players have to use some of their bank notes to exactly reach the price of one of the items in the middle of the table (e.g. if there is an item that costs 837 and another that costs 1200, they can choose the 800 and the 37 banknote, or the 800 and 400). Some items are worth more nuts than others. All players do the calculating simultaneously. If a player thinks they have put together a correct set of banknotes, they put the banknotes face down in front of him/herself and puts his/her hamster on the item card to reserve it. Once all the items have been reserved, the hamsters proceed to the checkout: all players check if the cards are correct (i.e. make up the exact price of the item). If they are, the player earns that item. If they aren't, this hamster doesn't get any card this round. The player who hasn't managed to reserve an item (there is always one item fewer than there are players) gets lucky if another player has miscalculated: he/she gets the item that player has reserved.<br/><br/>The game ends when there are no item cards left.

It covers the exploits of the German 11th Panzer Division in Russia from 1941 to 1944. The rules are very simple (no combat charts are needed) with very few exceptions to remember and yet the game is meant to be all encompassing and will include infantry, tanks, and artillery.<br/><br/>Based on years of research, the game system uses a unique suppression mechanic. There are no longer two unique states for a unit, but varying degrees of suppression. This allows suppression to accumulate from multiple fire sources and means that the unit will not take a morale check until it is asked to do something. You will never know for sure how your units will respond until they are needed.<br/><br/>Although casualties can be caused by artillery and heavy weapons (which makes them prime battlefield targets), squads will never cause significant casualties shooting at range at dug in, first line troops. Their goal is to fire and maneuver. Sections of the enemy force must be pinned down and eliminated from up close. The system itself forces this realistic play. In a similar fashion, the system rewards you for spreading your troops out and other realistic game play.<br/><br/>Another unique feature of the game is its use of Proficiency and Casualty ratings to differentiate squads in areas besides just morale.<br/><br/>Ghost Panzer is a STAND ALONE GAME, but is also the second in a series.<br/><br/>Band of Brothers: Screaming Eagles was the first in the series and followed the U.S. 101st Airborne Division.<br/><br/>Other games under research are &quot;The Old Breed&quot; (the US 1st Marine Division) and a module that follows Commonwealth forces.<br/><br/>Other Key Links:<br/><br/>Designing a Division<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": {"175682": "First edition"}, "maxplaytime": "90", "average": "8.19138", "name": "Band of Brothers:  Ghost Panzer", "playingtime": "90", "boardgamemechanic": {"2072": "Dice Rolling"}, "age": "8", "boardgameexpansion": {}, "usersrated": "242", "boardgamesubdomain": {"4664": "Wargames"}, "boardgamefamily": {"22797": "Band of Brothers"}}, "129123": {"statistics": {}, "name": "Don't Go Alone", "videogamemode": {"2149": "Single-Player"}, "videogameversion": {"175683": "North American DOS edition"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1391501.png", "videogametheme": {"2265": "Horror"}, "usersrated": "0", "average": "0", "videogamegenre": {"2155": "RPG"}, "videogameplatform": {"4714": "DOS"}, "poll": {}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1391501_t.png", "description": "Back of Box<br/><br/>Want To Go Some Place Really Scary?<br/><br/>As a child, you pedaled your bike past its seemingly endless gates -- eyes closed, riding like the wind.

Shatner. It was designed using the Build engine.<br/>The premise details an ex-cop who is hired to be a hitman whose mission is to exterminate drug dealers who peddle &quot;tek&quot;. The two most distinguishable features are the hub-based level system (all the levels are interconnected by a subway station), and the fact that all of the non-player characters (NPCs) in the game (enemies, policemen, civilians) are shootable. When the player draws his gun, policemen shout: &quot;Freeze! Drop your gun!&quot; before they start shooting at the player. When a policeman or enemy is killed, their ammo can be picked up. When the player aims at a civilian, he/she ducks and screams: &quot;Please, don't shoot!&quot; When any NPC is shot, a blood spot appears on the wall behind it. If an NPC is shot with one of the stronger weapons in the game, they will explode into gory bits.<br/>The games narrative took place using cutscenes at the beginning and end of each level, featuring Shatner himself (in character as Walter Bascom) as the narrator. Cutscenes varied depending on the player's performance during missions: if the player didn't shoot any innocent NPCs, managed to take out the TekLord in the mission, and didn't raise any tension (i.e. walking with his gun drawn), Shatner would deliver praise. On the other hand, shooting NPCs or aborting the mission caused him to threaten to have you put back into cryo-storage.<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;Tekwar (game)&quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "129170": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1389486.png", "poll": {}, "boardgamedesigner": {"62905": {"name": "Ulf M\u00fcller"}}, "statistics": {}, "yearpublished": "2007", "maxplayers": "0", "boardgameartist": {"58773": "Petra Graef"}, "boardgamepublisher": {"5844": {"name": "Tessloff"}}, "maxplaytime": "25", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1389486_t.png", "minplaytime": "25", "boardgamecategory": {"1094": {"name": "Educational"}}, "description": "Objective: gain most question cards finding correct answers<br/>- acting by turns -<br/>draw a card and give the correct answer;<br/>if you are right keep card as bonus point<br/><br/>64 question and answer cards, informative and curious about geography, politics, celebrities, recreational activities and history of Berlin, state of Germany.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "1", "boardgameversion": {"175782": "First edition"}, "age": "8", "name": "Deutschland-Quiz: Berlin", "playingtime": "25", "boardgamemechanic": {"2041": "Card Drafting"}, "average": "0", "usersrated": "0", "boardgamefamily": {"18214": "Cities: Berlin (Germany)"}}, "129171": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1389495.png", "poll": {}, "boardgamedesigner": {"62878": {"name": "Claudia Biermann"}}, "statistics": {}, "yearpublished": "2007", "maxplayers": "0", "boardgameartist": {"58773": "Petra Graef"}, "boardgamepublisher": {"5844": {"name": "Tessloff"}}, "maxplaytime": "25", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1389495_t.png", "minplaytime": "25", "boardgamecategory": {"1094": {"name": "Educational"}}, "description": "Objective: gain most question cards finding correct answers<br/>- acting by turns -<br/>draw a card and give the correct answer;<br/>if you are right keep card as bonus point<br/><br/>64 question and answer cards, informative and curious about geography, politics, celebrities, recreational activities and history of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, state of Germany.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "1", "boardgameversion": {"175783": "First edition"}, "age": "8", "name": "Deutschland-Quiz: Mecklenburg-Vorpommern", "playingtime": "25", "boardgamemechanic": {"2041": "Card Drafting"}, "average": "0", "usersrated": "0", "boardgamefamily": {"10643": "Country: Germany"}}, "129172": {"statistics": {}, "name": "Warriors of Legend", "videogamemode": {"2149": "Single-Player"}, "videogameversion": {"175784": "North American DOS edition"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1397457.png", "videogametheme": {"2148": "Fantasy"}, "usersrated": "0", "average": "0", "videogamegenre": {"2155": "RPG"}, "videogameplatform": {"4714": "DOS"}, "poll": {}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1397457_t.png", "description": "Back of Box<br/><br/>Hear Ye, Hear Ye!<br/><br/>King Osric the Great, in his divine wisdom, has sent forth this decree to the people of Lemuria.

It was written that whoever possessed the orb would have magical powers greater than any other sorcerer.<br/><br/>Using his new powers, Zyll took revenge against the land.

The game has two distinct roles: the role of the Guardian who builds a dungeon and the role of the Hero who builds a party of adventurers to loot the dungeon built by the Guardian.<br/><br/>At the start of the game the Guardian secretly designs a dungeon using a set of 16 room cards. Additional room cards are set aside and drawn from as the game progresses. There are 4 basic room types: Traps, Brutes, Evil and Magic. Brute and Evil rooms are more common and Magic and Trap rooms less common. Each room in the game is unique and has specific ways in which it can assist in the dungeon defense. For example, some rooms, like the RUST BEAST, destroy items, others, like the PRISON CELL, give the HERO player an addition adventurer if the room is captured by the HERO. In addition, there are empty rooms that when coupled with other rooms create a modifier to the chance of that room being overtaken. The Treasure Vault is the most valuable of those rooms and the goal is to keep the adventurers from finding and capturing it. Once the Guardian places entrances outside the dungeon, the game begins.<br/><br/>Within a round, players spend tokens to take actions in an alternating sequence. The game combines elements of chance with your ability to read your opponent's strategy. The Guardian and Hero do not HAVE to take an action and can pass and wait to see what the other is doing, however, each round the Guardian has last option which means he or she can act last forcing the hero to either act, or end their turn and turn over all but 1 of their action tokens. In addition, the Hero has first option, meaning if both players wish to act first in a round, the Hero gets to go first.<br/><br/>Each player has action tokens to spend on a variety of actions. Players use tokens to make plays during a round. After all players have spent their tokens, a new round begins with a new set of tokens.<br/><br/>The Heroes use tokens to prepare adventurers, and move them through the dungeon. Actions include: scouting a room (a less lethal option but slower and thus can waste precious time), venturing a room (a potentially lethal action where the hero charges adventurers into a room), play a card (spell, item or adventurer), draw a card, retreat, or pass. Heroes earn points by defeating rooms. The Guardian uses action tokens to build more rooms into the dungeon, alter room locations in the dungeon, create dungeon effects to slow down the Hero's progress, or draw cards from the dungeon deck. Each card drawn brings the game closer to the end, because when the dungeon deck is emptied the game ends. The Guardian earns points by capturing adventurers and their gear, and by keeping his dungeon rooms from being captured. The game ends either when the Guardian has drawn all the dungeon cards or when the Hero captures the Treasure Vault.<br/><br/>A major component of the game is how the Hero moves through the dungeon and captures rooms. The Hero must enter from one of the 2 entrances, and then must always move to rooms that are adjacent (not DIAGONAL) to the entrance, or adjacent to any cleared room connected to the entrance by other cleared rooms. To clear a room the Hero uses action tokens to form a party. Selecting between 1 and 4 of his adventurers with skills suited for the room at hand. The Hero can save time by charging into an unknown room or use action tokens to scout the room and then pick the best party for the job. The advantage of charging is that it saves time and throws off the Guardian, however, it can mean certain death. Scouting is safer, but eats precious time. The Hero is trying to put the best adventurers in the rooms most suited to their skills&mdash;while the Guardian tries to ambush and surprise the Hero with rooms that challenge the adventurers. This is where spells (for the Hero) and Dungeon Effects (for the Guardian) help tip the scales of a close combat. The 4 basic Adventurers WARRIOR, ROGUE, WIZARD, and CLERIC each have a room they are best at defeating. However, they are also capable and somewhat skilled in other rooms. In addition they each have a power which gives them strategic advantages, for example the warrior is better at venturing, the rogue at scouting, the wizard can cast spells without eating action points, and the cleric can save party members by sacrificing himself. Using their skills and talents at the right time in a well balanced group can mean the difference between a wipe-out and a victory. Of course, the Guardian can see the party composition and their equipment, but the Hero cannot see what is in the rooms. So the Guardian is constantly shifting and bolstering his rooms to create the most havoc for the party at hand.<br/><br/>Equipment also scores points for the Guardian if captured, but is important to boost the adventurers skills vs. various rooms. It also takes time (action tokens) to equip. The advantage of the bonus vs. the consumption of time becomes a key strategic choice.<br/><br/>In a multi-player game there are multiple Heroes who each take a turn in sequence against the Guardian. Each Hero builds a party of adventurers and equips them separately. In the end if the Heroes have more combined points they win as a team against the Guardian. The game currently can play 1 to 3 Heroes vs. 1 Guardian.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": {"175906": "English first edition"}, "age": "9", "name": "HERO versus GUARDIAN: A Game of Dungeon Craft", "playingtime": "60", "boardgamemechanic": {"2001": "Action Point Allowance System"}, "average": "6.01552", "usersrated": "58", "boardgamefamily": {"8374": "Crowdfunding: Kickstarter"}}, "129225": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1975913.jpg", "poll": {}, "boardgamedesigner": {"51428": {"name": "\u0141ukasz Wo\u017aniak"}}, "statistics": {}, "yearpublished": "2014", "maxplayers": "4", "boardgameartist": {"48242": "Urszula Michalska"}, "boardgamepublisher": {"7382": {"name": "Leonardo Games"}}, "maxplaytime": "45", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1975913_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "45", "boardgamecategory": {"1050": {"name": "Ancient"}}, "description": "The Jerusalem wall has been destroyed. People are filled with great shame and in trouble. Without the wall, Israelites and the Temple are not safe.

Now it happened in the month of Chislev, in the twentieth year, as I was in Susa the capital, that Hanani, one of my brothers, came with certain men from Judah. And I asked them concerning the Jews who escaped, who had survived the exile, and concerning Jerusalem.&quot;<br/><br/>And they said to me, &quot;The remnant there in the province who had survived the exile is in great trouble and shame.

The game is based on a unique, worker-placement mechanism:<br/><br/><br/>    Players will place their workers on ever-changing labor cards.<br/>    When a player activates his worker, he may activate other labor cards in the same row of cards that have already been activated.

The monster was quickly destroyed but the strain of the transformation was so great that when Imogen returned to his normal state, his mind snapped.<br/><br/>He forgot his friendship to the townspeople and used his power to destroy their crops, burn their houses and fill the sky with black clouds so that the town was in permanent night. After a few weeks of this, a spokesman set forth to seek the advice of the greatest and wisest wizard in the land.<br/><br/>When the Great Wizard had heard the story he said, &quot;This insanity will pass, but until that time he must be imprisoned. I shall design a cave to hold him and your craftsmen will construct it in the mountain that overlooks the town.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;How will we know when to release him?&quot; asked the spokesman.<br/><br/>&quot;He will free himself when the time is right. I shall provide the spell for his release and split it in twain four times. The sixteen pieces will then be placed within the cavern and the route to each guarded by a test of stamina and intelligence. Only when he is fully recovered will he be able to retrieve the entire spell and set himself free&quot;.<br/><br/>And so the cavern was constructed, and with the Great Wizard's help, Imogen was secured within the first section, ready to begin his quest for freedom.<br/><br/>User Summary<br/><br/>Imogen is an innovative platform puzzle game written by Michael St Aubyn and released by Micro Power for the BBC Micro. It was later re-released by Superior Software for both the BBC Micro and Acorn Electron on their Play It Again Sam 5 compilation.<br/><br/>The user plays the wizard Imogen, who has the ability to transform into a cat or a monkey (and one other animal in one particular level). While in wizard form, Imogen can use items which have been picked up in order to solve various puzzles. In cat form he can jump higher and across wider gaps than in the other forms. In monkey form he can climb ropes.<br/><br/>The game is a 2D platformer played out over 16 levels, each with witty names, which also often provide a clue to the solution of the level. For example Level H, &quot;Hamster-Jam&quot; involves planting a tulip bulb in fertiliser made from a squashed hamster in order to allow Imogen, in monkey form, to climb to a previously out-of-reach platform! The starting level is random but they are always played in the same order (wrapping round from Level P to Level A). The aim of each level is to navigate the environment, using the abilities of each of Imogen's different forms and various items around each level to reach a piece of the release spell. Using the spell transports him to the next level.<br/><br/>There are no lives, however Imogen can only transform 150 times. So solving the puzzles efficiently is essential. If Imogen runs out of transformations, then the player will find that they are stuck and cannot progress. If all 16 levels are completed using less than 150 transformations, then the conclusion to the story is scrolled on-screen.<br/><br/>A PC remake, with the blessing of St Aubyn, was released in 2003 by ovine by design.<br/><br/>"}, "129229": {"boardgamedesigner": {"4311": {"name": "B\u00e4rbel Schmidts"}}, "poll": {}, "name": "Die drei ??? und das leere Grab", "playingtime": "20", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": {"2041": "Card Drafting"}, "yearpublished": "0", "usersrated": "0", "boardgamefamily": {"9042": "The Three Investigators"}, "maxplayers": "4", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1391763_t.png", "average": "0", "statistics": {}, "boardgamepublisher": {"127": {"name": "Klee"}}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1391763.png", "boardgameversion": {"175959": "First edition"}, "maxplaytime": "20", "boardgamecategory": {"1041": {"name": "Children's Game"}}, "age": "8", "minplaytime": "20", "description": "Objective: Gain most victory points gaining sets (3 matching cards) and making corroct guess es about (3) hidden cards <br/> - acting by turns -<br/>Out of each three category groups (person, place, tool) a card is placed upon the table, uncovered.

Many of these characters are also in use on the ShadowTK role-playing mailing list. With this in mind, when using these characters as NPCs in your own campaign, be as true as possible to their original intent. In other words, be nice.<br/><br/>These characters are intended to be very high powered players in the Sixth World. The increased Attributes x1.5 Optional Rule was used in a number of cases, and one character even has Delta-grade cyberware. There are also some &quot;new&quot; spells and a new house rule regarding how contacts get gear and information. This optional rules and spells will all be explained at the end of the chapter. In addition, all bonuses have all ready been added to statistics and skills, unless otherwise noted. If you still can&rsquo;t find something, contact the individual who created the character via e-mail.<br/><br/>And again, a special thanks to all those who contributed to this catalogue. I wouldn&rsquo;t have been able to do it without you (obviously). Some of you people are very sick... ;-) I may have changed something about your character, but I tried to keep with the original spirit of the character. And in some case, I exaggerated the personality traits to try and make the character more interesting and different. Not to mention in almost every case I made the character stronger.

The pioneers chose George Donner as their leader, and in an effort to shave 350 miles off the trip they took an alternate route through Utah known as Hastings Cutoff. This turned out to be a mistake, and subsequently the wagon train became trapped by early winter snow blocking the Fr&eacute;mont Pass in the Sierra Nevada Mountains.  The pioneers made camp to wait out the winter at Truckee Lake and Alder Creek.  Starvation, illness and even cannibalism took their toll, and out of the 87 original members of the Donner Party only 48 made it out alive.<br/><br/>Players each control a family of pioneers with the goal of reaching California.  The game starts in November of 1846 with food supplies dwindling and more winter storms on the horizon.  Each player receives a cabin and six pioneer dice that represent your pioneers' conditions: Healthy, Lean, Starving, Sick (Dying) or Dead.  Each round starts with an event after which players take turns placing their pioneers on action spaces until the Starvation Phase when they need to feed their families with food tokens and heat their cabins with wood tokens.<br/><br/>Player interaction is maximized by the Beg action which takes food or wood from another player and the Desperation action which is how to draw and play Desperation cards that are either beneficial for the player or punish opponents.  Some card effects and actions to gain food earn player cannibalism tokens, which penalize a player's score at the end of the game. Periodically during the game a Rescue event occurs and players must choose whether to gamble some of their pioneers on a risky rescue attempt over Fr&eacute;mont Pass or wait until the thirteenth turn of the game when all pioneers left in their cabins are automatically scored.<br/><br/>The object of the game is to deliver as many of your six pioneers as you can to Sutter's Fort alive and minimize your cannibalism token penalty.<br/>  <br/>  &quot;The needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few or one.&quot; -Spock, The Wrath of Kahn.<br/><br/>&quot;It's fun to get together and have something good to eat at least once a day.&quot; -Julia Child<br/><br/>"}, "129307": {"boardgamedesigner": {"337": {"name": "Joseph Miranda"}}, "poll": {}, "name": "Congo Merc: The Congo, 1964", "playingtime": "30", "minplayers": "1", "boardgamemechanic": {"2078": "Point to Point Movement"}, "yearpublished": "2012", "usersrated": "78", "boardgamefamily": {"39552": "Decision Games Commando Series"}, "maxplayers": "1", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1393190_t.jpg", "average": "6.30513", "statistics": {}, "boardgamepublisher": {"102": {"name": "Decision Games (I)"}}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1393190.jpg", "boardgameversion": {"176173": "First Edition"}, "maxplaytime": "30", "boardgamecategory": {"1019": {"name": "Wargame"}}, "age": "12", "minplaytime": "30", "description": "From DecisionGames.com:<br/>The Congo, 1964<br/><br/>During the 1960s the newly independent Congo was the scene of constant warfare.

When your creature attacks an opponent (and is not blocked by another creature) it breaks one of his shields, and the shield card goes to the owner's hand.

The same cards, representing creatures and spells, can produce mana if placed in the Mana Zone instead of the Battle Zone. This removes what many see as a major flaw of Magic: the Gathering - &quot;mana flood&quot; and &quot;mana screw&quot;.<br/>2. There are no instant spells or activated abilities. Therefore, there are far fewer surprises for players from their opponents and also fewer tactical decisions during play.

Hopefully you purchased enough new wall segments to repair your castle and expand into new areas on the map. If you can't repair at least one of your castles your reign has ended and your enemy has claimed victory. After a tough round of battle deploy new units on the board and prepare for the next round of battle to begin.<br/><br/>Some struggles will end in a kingdom falling to an enemy while others will result in one king expanding the kingdom and taking over so much territory that victory is claimed. So many strategy combinations can be put together for victory. Eight unique kingdom specialists (occupations) can be hired to change your kingdom's strategy. These range from markets that yield extra gold to workshops that convert troops into massive land roving siege weapons. What will be your strategy, quick expansion or maybe an arsenal of cannons?<br/><br/>"}, "129341": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1697031.jpg", "poll": {}, "boardgamedesigner": {"63081": {"name": "Bryan Collars"}}, "statistics": {}, "yearpublished": "2013", "maxplayers": "2", "boardgameartist": {"71": "Rodger B.

The theme of this Battle Pack shifts to actions in France, Belgium and Norway from late April to June 1940, looking at critical moments in this brief span where the forces of both sides tested each other sorely. To reflect this, the scenario special rules are designed to make the Allied Minor hand exhibit flexibility (which was demonstrated whenever higher echelon interference was reduced). CC&ndash;Fall of the West features twelve new scenarios printed on cardstock as well as ten new maps.<br/><br/>Special experimental AFV Rules are featured in four of the scenarios where tanks are facing infantry in settings that reveal how the doctrines, armaments and countermeasures were still early in development. While unfettered races by companies of tanks across the countryside remain a landmark image of the blitzkrieg, we found many instances of a more tentative level of engagement, suitable for our attempt at capturing an unusual element in the CC scope &ndash; TANKS!<br/> The new maps depict specific locations in France, Belgium and Norway, which have been located and specifically verified (from the sky, maps and in texts).

They will be given a chance to admire the wonders of the underground, like halls full of stalactites. To make it all possible they must take the right supplies with them, like ropes, oxygen and batteries.<br/><br/>Each turn players have five action points to use for moving, discovering new cave tiles, exploring them, and packing their backpacks when they go back to the starting base. They need ropes for descents, oxygen to explore underwater parts, and a camera to photograph underground wonders. Planning what to take with them is one of the most important things in the game. Each turn that their pawn is not in the starting base, players must use (i.e., throw out) one basic supply from their backpack; these costs, along with the expenditure of other supplies during exploration, forces them to return to the starting base a few times during the game. To keep them from having to carry everything, though, players can raise a camp somewhere in the tunnels where they can store some of the equipment.<br/><br/>The cave differs every game, so players have to be prepared for everything or they will lose time. Players earn points for exploring different tiles: underwater, wondrous, descents, and so on &ndash; but to win they'll need to acquire bonus prizes for exploring the most tiles of each type.

We hope you enjoy Harpoon II and that you too will find yourself spending many hours commanding contemporary naval and air forces.<br/><br/>Modern naval warfare is often described as &quot;hours of boredom, interrupted by moments of stark terror.&quot; Use those &quot;hours of boredom&quot; to improve the flow of information or &quot;intelligence&quot; required to make your &quot;Commander&rsquo;s estimate of the situation.&quot; Doing this will better prepare you for when those &quot;moments of stark terror&quot; arrive. And trust us, those moments are going to arrive!<br/><br/>View yourself as a naval officer assuming a new command. Become familiar with your forces. Know your capabilities. Equally important is becoming familiar with the capabilities of the enemy. Harpoon II provides an extensive platform database containing detailed information about the capabilities of every platform (surface vessel, submarine, or aircraft) used in the game.<br/><br/>In Harpoon II, as in real life, it is often true that victory goes to the commander that &quot;gets there first with the most.&quot; A successful commander has to also know how and when to use &quot;the most.&quot; Before using your firepower, it is wise that you have the best information about your situation and the situation(s) surrounding you. Those familiar with current events know this may mean the difference between destroying a threatening enemy contact or shooting down an unarmed civilian airliner.<br/><br/>This is more than just a game. It is a simulation that accurately represents the capabilities and limitations of modern naval and air forces. A painstakingly detailed labor of love went into providing Harpoon II with the most accurate data that can be obtained from open or unclassified sources. You will not find another entertainment product on the market that has the amount of data contained in the Harpoon II database.<br/><br/>The dedicated efforts of many people went into making this product the most accurate and exciting simulation you can run without security clearance.

End Phase<br/><br/>END OF GAME<br/><br/>At this point, players should check to see if the Scenario&rsquo;s Victory Conditions have been satisfied by either player, if the Time or Turn Limit has expired or if the roll for Variable game length should be made. If the game has ended, then Victory Points should be calculated for both sides, depending on the Scenario played, and the winner should be determined.<br/><br/>The winner of a game of FI:P is normally decided by comparing Victory Point Totals after the final Turn has been played, unless a Scenario is being played that gives alternative Victory Conditions.<br/><br/>MULTI-PLAYER GAMES<br/><br/>Although it is preferable for everyone to have their own deck of Game Cards, it is possible share a deck. Each player will need to draw from a shared deck and discard to a shared Discard Pile.<br/><br/>Important Note: If a deck is used by more than one player, where possible, allies, rather than opponents, should use a shared deck.<br/><br/>You may not play cards on your allies&rsquo; models unless the card text specifically allows you to. In games with more than two players per side you may ONLY play cards to benefit models you control or to hinder enemy models.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": {"176363": "Studio Sparta first edition"}, "average": "6.5", "name": "Firestorm Invasion: Planetfall", "playingtime": "90", "boardgamemechanic": {"2080": "Area Control / Area Influence"}, "age": "14", "usersrated": "6", "boardgamefamily": {"19340": "Firestorm Galaxy"}}, "129379": {"boardgamedesigner": {"278": {"name": "Terry Goodchild"}}, "poll": {}, "name": "Premiership Football", "playingtime": "0", "minplayers": "1", "boardgamemechanic": {"2072": "Dice Rolling"}, "yearpublished": "0", "usersrated": "2", "boardgamefamily": {"5551": "Sports: Football / Soccer"}, "maxplayers": "2", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2844906_t.jpg", "average": "5.75", "statistics": {}, "boardgamepublisher": {"4902": {"name": "Owzat Games"}}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2844906.jpg", "boardgameversion": {"176364": "First edition"}, "maxplaytime": "0", "boardgamecategory": {"1038": {"name": "Sports"}}, "age": "0", "minplaytime": "0", "description": "A soccer replay/simulation/management game in which dice rolls and charts are used to simulate the management and gameplay results of soccer teams.<br/><br/>Paraphrased from the Owzat site:<br/><br/>Team Squad Ratings, attack and defence are used separately, reflecting the squad strengths of the teams. These are constructed on a goals scored and conceded basis using the final league table to ensure an accurate statistical base. Individual team ratings are used for Injuries and Suspensions, for Injuries reflecting the effect of an injury to a key player of players on the Squad strength of the team, thus ensuring that the teams with smaller and less flexible squads will suffer more severely from injury absentees, for Suspensions penalising those teams that have proved over the season that they are rarely able to field a full strength side because of this reason (e.g. Arsenal, Leeds). Cash is allocated to each club, allowing the rich to enter the transfer market more freely than their less wealthy rivals, provided the right player comes along of course. Transfers in and out, injuries and suspensions are dealt with in a fairly abstract way, as is necessary in a game that is about teams and not individuals. Opportunities will arise to strengthen the Attack/ Defensive Squad Values, players may have to be sold which have the reverse affect, all without names but all having an immediate effect on team strengths and performances.<br/><br/>A day's fixtures, whether it be just a couple of mid-week matches or a full Saturday/Sunday programme, are valued as a complete package before any match is resolved. This involves checking for Injuries and Suspensions on a team-by-team basis and then assessing which Goal Card to use for each time by deducting one team's Defence Squad value from the opponent's Attack Squad value and rounding the result down to a figure divisible by ten. When all matches have been valued, a roll of two pairs of coloured dice per match will produce a half time score line, a second roll for each will give the full time result. Book keeping consists of marking up the result on the Results Matrix and up dating both the Cumulative Points and Goals For and Against Charts.<br/><br/>"}, "129380": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1400711.jpg", "poll": {}, "boardgamedesigner": {"51428": {"name": "\u0141ukasz Wo\u017aniak"}}, "statistics": {}, "yearpublished": "2012", "maxplayers": "5", "boardgameartist": {"38447": "Jarek Noco\u0144"}, "boardgamepublisher": {"7466": {"name": "REBEL.pl"}}, "maxplaytime": "60", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1400711_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "45", "boardgamecategory": {"2726": {"name": "Age of Reason"}}, "description": "The East India Company grows quickly through the delivery of exotic goods from New World and Far East &ndash; but to operate on such a large scale, the company needs money, so the first world stock market is opened in Amsterdam. Rich citizens see the opportunity to acquire even more riches, so they invest in the stock market, while also wanting to take part in even more opportunities to make profit. Thus, much wanted exotic goods can be bought and sold, too, and with no secure routes a player can make even better profits by trading them.<br/><br/>In Mercurius players take on the role of rich citizens in Holland in the 17th century. They invest their money in stocks of different branches of the East India Company or try to earn much more profit through risky trade in exotic goods. Players have their own information about activities in the far lands and about events which can influence prices at the market, but each of them sees only part of the picture, so they have to look at what other players are doing and which prices are influenced by them.<br/><br/>Players have starting cash at the beginning of the game, along with five &quot;changing prices&quot; cards and four cards which allow them to take special actions during play. The game board shows prices for stocks of six branches of the East India Company and for six goods those branches trade. On a turn, a player can make up to three purchases or sales of stocks or goods as he wishes. He then plays one &quot;changing prices&quot; card from his hand. Each card changes the price of one stock and one good. Each card changes the prices three times, once on the turn it's played and on two consecutive turns. The tricky part is that cards move the value of goods twice as much as the value of stocks, so players can earn more by trading goods &ndash; but doing so is far more risky.<br/><br/>Who will become the richest citizen of Holland and win the game?<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "3", "boardgameversion": {"176365": "English/Polish first edition"}, "average": "6.32436", "name": "Mercurius", "playingtime": "60", "boardgamemechanic": {"2013": "Commodity Speculation"}, "age": "10", "usersrated": "275", "boardgamesubdomain": {"5497": "Strategy Games"}, "boardgamefamily": {"18643": "Cities: Amsterdam"}}, "129381": {"boardgamedesigner": {"49782": {"name": "Jarno Siekkinen"}}, "average": "5.57955", "poll": {}, "name": "Wild Patterns", "playingtime": "30", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": {"2048": "Pattern Building"}, "yearpublished": "2012", "usersrated": "22", "maxplayers": "6", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1404397_t.jpg", "boardgameartist": {"68116": "Katri Vainiom\u00e4ki"}, "statistics": {}, "boardgamepublisher": {"21967": {"name": "Roll D6 Games"}}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1404397.jpg", "boardgameversion": {"176366": "Finnish first edition"}, "maxplaytime": "30", "boardgamecategory": {"1009": {"name": "Abstract Strategy"}}, "age": "8", "minplaytime": "30", "description": "Wild Patterns  - A game of fast perception<br/><br/>Wild Patterns  is a family board game offering a mixture of fast perception, problem solving, and tactics.<br/><br/>The aim is to find patterns shown on your cards from the different colored wooden tiles constantly moving around the game board.

Thus it is no wonder to see ships like this one dominating the local waters. Among the  many advantages of these ship type are that it can be sailed with a small crew and that, without a keel, it has a low draft.<br/><br/>This particular ship in addition was built with a double hull and its interior is separated into several compartments. These two design features make the ship extraordinary hard to sink. The ships draft is extraordinary low even fully loaded allowing it to sail not only on the open sea but up rivers as well. Another feature gained by the low berth is that the ship can anchor in water too shallow for other ships of its size.<br/><br/>And although it could be sailed with as few as a handful of crewmen it can carry a considerably larger number of men. Considering all this, it comes as no big surprise that this junk is under the command of a less than reputable captain and carries contraband or pirates more often than merchants and trade goods.<br/><br/>"}, "129386": {"boardgamedesigner": {"63076": {"name": "Lutz W\u00f6ckener"}}, "poll": {}, "name": "Das gro\u00dfe Fu\u00dfball-Quiz", "playingtime": "0", "minplayers": "1", "yearpublished": "2011", "usersrated": "0", "boardgamefamily": {"5551": "Sports: Football / Soccer"}, "maxplayers": "0", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1400674_t.png", "average": "0", "statistics": {}, "boardgamepublisher": {"12134": {"name": "Carlsen Verlag GmbH"}}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1400674.png", "boardgameversion": {"176391": "Carlsen Edition 2011"}, "maxplaytime": "0", "boardgamecategory": {"1038": {"name": "Sports"}}, "age": "8", "minplaytime": "0", "description": "Over 1,000 tricky questions and answers about the German Bundesliga and the 2nd Bundesliga.<br/><br/>The game can be played with questioning and answering by points or by time.

Now there are forces that want to snatch the kings fire from oblivion, and they need mortal helpers ...<br/><br/>The adventure begins in a guesthouse in the northern Artross Mountains, where a hiking trail used by the dwarves leads along.

She demands the kings fire as a bride price from her fianc&eacute;, who is anything but a heroic adventurer and who needs all his courage and of course experienced helpers to rise to this challenge of fate.<br/><br/>The verses provide an indication that the artifact is hidden in an mine abandoned since a tragic accident. After a trip through the lands of the albian dwarves and beyond, in the abandoned mine the companions have to deal with the spirits of the injured miners, with the natural magic of the mountain, but also with dark shadow dwarves until they finally hold the kings fire in their hands. But the story is not finished yet, because on the way back, the adventurers get into a parade of the Orcs of the Misty Mountains, and have to find out that not only the mysterious leader of the Orcs, but also a demigod, and a shadow of the night are interested in the Melzindar.<br/><br/>This booklet provides a role-playing adventure for player characters of intermediate levels that makes familiar with the lifestyle of the dwarves of Alba and calls for combative and role-playing skills equally.<br/><br/>"}, "129413": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1399400.jpg", "poll": {}, "statistics": {}, "yearpublished": "2012", "maxplayers": "4", "boardgameartist": {"49931": "Stu Barnes"}, "boardgamepublisher": {"2973": {"name": "Edge Entertainment"}}, "maxplaytime": "60", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1399400_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "60", "boardgamecategory": {"1002": {"name": "Card Game"}}, "description": "Released at GenCon 2012, The Battle of Lake-town is second print-on-demand encounter deck (so, not a full expansion like the monthly decks).<br/><br/>Description from Fantasy Flight:<br/>&quot;Believed to be nothing but a legend by the younger generation of men who live in Lake-town, Smaug the Dragon descends from the Lonely Mountain unlooked for in the dead of night.

Following the rules, each player creates a fictional character &ndash; a person accused (justly or not) of a crime against the empire and on the run with her lover. The game starts when the protagonists find themselves passing through Bertinoro, a settlement on the hills of Romagna by the Via Aemilia and close to the Ravenna port.<br/><br/>Unfortunately for them, in that torrid summer, Bacchus and his followers came down to this village surrounded by vineyards. Attracted by the excesses brought forth by intoxication, other gods manifest themselves; cruel Pluto, severe Minerva and the sensuous Venus will play with the destiny of mortals with all the thoughtlessness only gods can have. The player's objective is to reunite with her beloved and run away. Each player in turn draws a hand of cards and, based on the results of the draw, describes a scene from the story for her protagonists. Elements of the scene vary according to which god was more present in the draw. For instance, a scene dominated by Pluto will feature a violent crime in which the protagonist ends up somehow involved. Benevolent Venus reunites lovers. Bacchus brings thrill and excitement, and so on.

If he scores any points, according to a list of scoring combinations (e.g. three &quot;D&quot;s score 500 points), he may then set aside these and roll again, getting the chance to accumulate more points. Alternatively, he can stop rolling and keep his accumulated score. If he rolls a no-scoring throw, then he  scores zero for that turn, even if he had set aside scoring dice from previous rolls. His points are then recorded, and play passes on to the next player.

To set up the game, players choose a mastermind villain (Magneto, Loki, Dr. Doom, etc.), stack that particular villain's attack cards underneath it, then modify the villain deck as needed based on that villain's particular scheme. Players then choose a number of hero decks &ndash; Spider-Man, Hulk, Cyclops, Wolverine, etc. &ndash; and shuffle them together; since players use only a handful of hero decks out of the fifteen included, the hero deck can vary widely in terms of what's available.<br/><br/>Over the course of the game, players will recruit powerful hero cards to add to their deck in order to build a stronger and more resourceful deck. Players need to build both their recruitment powers (to enlist more heroes) and their fighting ability (to combat the villains who keep popping up to cause trouble). Players recruit heroes from an array of five cards, with empty slots refilled as needed. At the start of a player's turn, he reveals a villain and adds it to the row of villains. This row has a limited number of spaces, and if it fills up, the earliest villain to arrive escapes, possibly punishing the heroes in some way. Some villains also take an action when showing up for the first time, such as kidnapping an innocent bystander. The villain deck also contains &quot;master strike&quot; cards, and whenever one of these shows up, the mastermind villain (controlled by the game) takes a bonus action.<br/><br/>As players fight and defeat villains, they collect those cards, which will be worth points at game's end. Players can also fight the mastermind; if a player has enough fighting power, he claims one of the attack cards beneath the mastermind, which has a particular effect on the game. If all of these cards are claimed, the game ends and players tally their points to see who wins. If the mastermind completes his scheme, however &ndash; having a certain number of villains escape, for example, or imposing a certain number of wounds on the heroes &ndash; then the players all lose.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "1", "boardgameversion": {"176625": "English first edition"}, "maxplaytime": "45", "average": "7.6319", "name": "Legendary: A Marvel Deck Building Game", "playingtime": "45", "boardgamemechanic": {"2023": "Co-operative Play"}, "age": "14", "boardgameexpansion": {}, "usersrated": "13168", "boardgameaccessory": {"157107": "Legendary: A Marvel Deck Building Game \u2013 Playmat"}, "boardgamesubdomain": {"5496": "Thematic Games"}, "boardgamefamily": {"5338": "Comics: Marvel Universe"}}, "129438": {"poll": {}, "name": "The Old Woman Who Lived in a Shoe", "playingtime": "0", "minplayers": "2", "yearpublished": "1980", "usersrated": "0", "maxplayers": "4", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1396945_t.jpg", "average": "0", "statistics": {}, "boardgamepublisher": {"1962": {"name": "Orchard Toys"}}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1396945.jpg", "boardgameversion": {"176631": "Orchard Toys First Edition"}, "maxplaytime": "0", "boardgamecategory": {"1002": {"name": "Card Game"}}, "age": "3", "minplaytime": "0", "description": "Childrens card game based on the nursery rhyme.<br/><br/>Object is to collect 10 cards comprising of The Old Woman and her nine children.<br/><br/>To play, spread all the cards face downwards on the floor or table.

Their task is simple: to hang clothes on the balconies.  But, the air and shaky hands might cause some of the clothespins, pinza de ropa in Spanish, to fall, or mysteriously end up on a higher floor of the building!<br/><br/>The players alternate turns during which they try to have as many clothespins as possible on their floor.  Each player's floor is designated by a secret objective card (marked with a star).<br/><br/>During their turn players choose a floor on the board, roll the dice, and then may play cards to affect the outcome of the dice.  Each number on the dice different from the player's floor means that a clothespin must go to another floor.  A special objective card indicates which floor is best for that player's clothespins.  The winner of the game is the one that gathers the most points, based on the special objective card and a player's played cards during the duration of the game.<br/><br/>The print &amp; play version which will be available through this site and the publisher's page is the family version of the game.  A future version of Pinza de Ropa will include a new advanced version, with more cards, strategies, and surprises that will make the game even better!<br/><br/>The only thing not provided in the print'n play version of the game are the 5 dice.

All players start with their player card next to a timestream, and during the game they try to avoid being in the same timestream with another players.<br/><br/>Sometimes, a player must calculate a temporal distortion, and all players that are on the same timestream as another must lose an amount of this distortion by counting on their vortex resonator. The winner is the last race standing, after everyone else's race has reached its critical point.  There is no player elimination.  Players will continue to play until the end of the game and take their vengeance on the opponents that took them out.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": {"176679": "Print & Play Edition"}, "age": "10", "name": "Timestreams", "playingtime": "45", "boardgamemechanic": {"2046": "Area Movement"}, "average": "6.68", "usersrated": "10", "boardgamefamily": {"8374": "Crowdfunding: Kickstarter"}}, "129455": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1398716.png", "poll": {}, "boardgamedesigner": {"256": {"name": "Heinz Meister"}}, "statistics": {}, "yearpublished": "2008", "maxplayers": "4", "boardgameartist": {"29009": "Bluguy"}, "boardgamepublisher": {"127": {"name": "Klee"}}, "maxplaytime": "20", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1398716_t.png", "minplaytime": "20", "boardgamecategory": {"1009": {"name": "Abstract Strategy"}}, "description": "Objective: find out which 4 animals/persons (out of 12) are potential subject of a crime<br/> - acting simultaneously -<br/>offender = game master (changes per round) takes 4 (out of 12) hidden cards;<br/>active player rolls the die &amp; turns as many of (correspondent) detective cards; game master responds with correct answer;<br/>e.g.: player rolls a '5' &amp; draws 5 detective cards - if 2 of them are matching result becomes '2' (similar to Mastermind).<br/>After 8 turns players must judge; each matching 'hit' let players move up their scoring position, a mismatch moves the black offender's one; new round...<br/>at the end: top position wins; <br/>if black offender's position is top - all lost.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": {"177223": "German First Edition"}, "age": "7", "name": "Die drei ???

As the Union player, you must regroup from the initial shock of the blow, hold onto the Chancellor House, and counter-attack against Lee&rsquo;s outnumbered forces.<br/><br/>Following the debacle at Fredericksburg in December of 1862, President Lincoln replaced Burnside as commander of the Army of the Potomac with Maj. Gen. Joseph Hooker. Hooker came up with one of the most audacious flanking maneuvers of the war. Leaving two corps at Fredericksburg to pin Lee, he would march the rest of his army north and west, cross the Rapidan River, and place himself at Chancellorsville. The move, if successful, would place the Army of Northern Virginia between two Union armies, ready to be crushed as if in a vise. The opening move worked, but then Hooker sat still as if waiting (or daring) for Lee to attack him. Lee did indeed attack. But the move was so unconventional as to catch Hooker completely by surprise. Lee divided his forces in the face of the enemy&mdash;a textbook no-no&mdash;not once, but twice! First, he left a group at Fredericksburg to delay any Union crossing in that area. Then, with his remaining forces, he left only two divisions in front of Hooker, while the remainder of his army under Jackson (28,000 strong) marched around the Union right and attacked them in the rear at sunset on May 2, 1863.<br/><br/>CBM is an old-fashioned beer and pretzels game that is not burdened with cumbersome command &amp; control or supply rules.<br/><br/>Paul Koenig's Bloody Civil War Series is based upon the intermediate system of Avalon Hill's Gettysburg 1977.<br/><br/>"}, "129462": {"poll": {}, "name": "Scribbo", "playingtime": "20", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": {"2048": "Pattern Building"}, "yearpublished": "2011", "usersrated": "2", "maxplayers": "4", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1399171_t.jpg", "average": "6.5", "statistics": {}, "boardgamepublisher": {"59": {"name": "Winning Moves Games (USA)"}}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1399171.jpg", "boardgameversion": {"176720": "First edition"}, "maxplaytime": "20", "boardgamecategory": {"1094": {"name": "Educational"}}, "age": "10", "minplaytime": "20", "description": "From the box<br/><br/>Scribbo It's Bingo With Words<br/>It's as easy as Bingo.

There are 10 of each colour, numbered 1 to 10. Plus there are 4 multiplication cards, 4 subtraction cards and 4 dividing cards. The latter three groups are called #Sign' cards.<br/><br/>The rules suggest you may play lots of traditional games with the cards (but I doubt it). The publisher does include the rules to three different games;<br/><br/>Fives<br/>Players must build up a row of five cards that total a number multiplied by five. The normal cards must be of of the same colour but not the sign cards. You do not have to use a sign card if you don't want to. You add and discard cards from your hand as in Rummy games. The first player to reveal a correct hand of five cards, wins that round. The score is one point for each five generated by the total i.e. 20 would score 4, 45 would score 9, and so on. The rules helpfully suggest that the maximum number that could be achieved with five cards is 2,560, and that total would generate 512 points.<br/><br/>Auction Maths<br/>This is a trick taking game and the only game where the colours are ranked; Black, Blue, Green, Red. Black is the lowest ranked colour and Red is the highest.The game is for four players, playing as partners. Both partnerships bid to claim a number of trick (5 being the minimum, 13 the most). Your partner can overcall your bid if he wants to. The player with the winning bid can choose a colour to be the 'Double' suit. This means that every card in that colour counts as if it was doubled (A 4 card would be an 8 card, a x4 card would be a x8 card, and so on). One thing to note, players do not have to follow suit. Any card can be played to any trick. When the calling side wins a trick, it only scores if the four cards played (and in the order the cards were laid) total 25 or more. If not, the trick is laid to one side and doesn't count. You score for each trick made plus a bonus for making your game. The opposition score for every trick by which you fail to make your contract.<br/><br/>Number Building<br/>Players agree before the start of a hand, the total that five cards laid out must achieve. The rules suggest a number under 50 is the wisest choice. Once agreed (before you see your cards), all players will work towards that total. Every player gets 6 cards and must lay a normal number card in front of themselves in the first round. In subsequent rounds a player may draw a card of the deck or a card of the discard pile or can lay a card next to his cards on the table. Once a player has met the total successfully, the hand ends and scoring is based on the small number in the corners of the cards. If you make the total with 5 cards of the same colour, an extra 150 is scored. This bonus reduces if two colours were involved.
