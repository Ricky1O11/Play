The front and back cover are printed sheets glued to the box.<br/><br/>The box includes:<br/><br/>- 34-page spiral-bound rulebook<br/>- 20-page adventure &quot;Autumn Harvest&quot;<br/>- a reference cardstock sheet<br/>- a full-color map of the game world<br/>- 2 character sheets<br/>- a &quot;Read this first&quot; sheet<br/>- a hand-knitted woolen dice bag with 2d10.<br/><br/><br/>From the back of the book<br/><br/>Welcome to Unlond!<br/><br/>It is a time of danger and intrigue in a land of power and magic. Let this be your guide to the secrets within.<br/><br/>Ages ago, war engulfed the world of Unlond in an epic conflict. For long years an alliance of humans, elves and dwarves fought against the evil forces of the Dark Prince Tidur. Finally, the Dark Prince was struck down on the field of battle and his forces withdrew to their homelands. Now, centuries later, the embers of that war still burn in the hearts of many. Peace has never been more than just a stalemate between the forces of evil and the alliance that opposes them.<br/><br/>Ill omens abound now. A plague swept through the northern lands last winter, weakening the nations of the alliance. Strange creatures have been sighted and sages fear that war will return to Unlond. Now is the time for heros, for new legends and new stories of valor and diplomacy to be made. Now is the time for you to experience the power and magic of Enchanted Worlds<br/><br/>In this game of fantasy roleplaying you and your friends take on the roles of heros fighting against the forces of evil and treachery. Each player has a character, your hero that you roleplay. One person must take on the role of the gamemaster, who is responsible for creating the storyline, describing the setting of the adventure to the players and interpreting the rules.<br/><br/>The rules are easy to learn and quick to use. Each player spends points to raise the character's Attributes, eight scores that represent the character's innate abilities. Players then pick Skills for their characters. There are dozens of Skills to choose from. Any combination is possible, from a sneaky fighter to a sword-wielding wizard to an expert hunter or anything else you can imagine. Each character is as unique as each player.<br/><br/>Inside this box you'll find the complete rules for playing Enchanted Worlds games, a sample character sheet that can be photocopied for player use, a reference card with all the most commonly used charts and tables and a full color 11&quot; x 17&quot; map of Unlond.The game also includes two eight sided dice (all the dice needed for playing the game) with a special dice bag and Autumn Harvest the first adventure for the Seasons of Change storyline. The adventure has four sample characters, so you can play now without needing to make new characters.<br/><br/>Perhaps most importantly, the Enchanted Worlds Starter Kit is part of the New Worlds Game System. After you learn the rules of Enchanted Worlds, you'll be able to pick up either Distant Worlds (our science fiction setting), Fantastic Worlds (science-fantasy) or any other setting when they become available and begin to play immediately!<br/><br/>"}, "58567": {"rpgitemversion": {"101058": "2nd printing"}, "poll": {}, "name": "Von eigenen Gnaden", "rpgproducer": {"24190": "Florian Don-Schauen"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic577344.jpg", "usersrated": "5", "rpgsetting": {"2005": "Aventurien"}, "average": "7.4", "statistics": {}, "rpggenre": {"961": "Fantasy"}, "rpg": {"608": "Das Schwarze Auge (DSA) (4th Edition)"}, "rpgcategory": {"2084": "Scenario / Adventure / Module"}, "rpgseries": {"3527": "Ausbau Abenteuer"}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic577344_t.jpg", "description": "(user summary)<br/>This campaign installs the PCs as warrior kings in a war zone of the empire Mittelreich called Wildermark.<br/>They have to stabilize the reagion by diplomacy with the neighboring warrior kings, ruling their region with justice (or a strong fist), fulfilling some quests and of course by warfare.<br/>This campaign is highly unusual for the Das Schwarze Auge roleplaying game as it pitches the player in positions of power.<br/><br/>"}, "58568": {"rpgitemversion": {"13778": "Box set"}, "statistics": {}, "name": "NeverWorld", "rpgproducer": {"28662": "Erin Laughlin"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic575830.jpg", "usersrated": "1", "average": "5", "rpgissuearticle": {"75494": "Anmeldelser"}, "rpggenre": {"961": "Fantasy"}, "rpg": {"3689": "NeverWorld"}, "rpgcategory": {"2083": "Core Rules (min needed to play)"}, "poll": {}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic575830_t.jpg", "description": "<br/>From the back of the book<br/><br/>One of the FEW Books of True Fantasy you'll ever need.<br/><br/>We, you and I, live in a sliver of time somwhere in the Third Age.

Aboard the great space arc Utopia they thought to travel to a distant galaxy where they might make a better life for themselves, away from the pollution, tyranny and death that had overrun Earth.<br/><br/>But these bold colonists were to fall foul to an enemy within, betrayed by their greatest technological achievement - the android. These soulless humanoids, convinced of their superiority over man, plotted while their creators slept in cryogenic hibernation. When the time was right, they turned off the hibernation safety protocols, killing all those who slept.<br/><br/>Or so they thought.<br/><br/>The androids then spread into the galaxy themselves, abandoning the Utopia to an icy voyage through time and space.<br/><br/>But one human survived. Now the Utopia&rsquo;s sentient computer, Main Frame, and the robots programmed for menial labour have the mammoth task of protecting the last human from all the hazards of deep space. And from the androids, who are intent on finishing the job they had started.<br/><br/>And who is this last survivor of the human race? A child. An infant girl.

The planes are a far grander stage for adventure than the mundane wilderness and dungeons of the world.

Beginning with the elemental planes of Earth, Air, Fire and Water, travel outwards through the transitive Ethereal, Shadow and the Dream planes to the wild planes of Positive and Negative energy. Beyond them, the wide gulf of the Astral plane and the vast Outer Planes.<br/><br/>Presented within are ten entirely new outer planes, along with suggestions for how to arrange and integrate them into your campaign cosmology including the dark realm known as M&acirc;l, where ancient horrors are awakening and the Questing Grounds, the realm of living stories. Including rules for each of these planes, according to a set of magical traits, along with the secrets of the art of Planecrafting, characters can shape their own home plane or wreak havoc by changing the laws of reality.<br/><br/>Travellers do not walk the planes alone, however, there are all sorts of fellow travellers out there, including reality-spanning organisations with their own agendas and conspiracies. Along with advice and new magic for travelling the planes, the wise traveller will consider using one of the Nexus planes; pocket worlds that share boarders with a multitude of other planes.<br/><br/>This tome tackles the mind-boggling complexity of the planes and travel throughout them head on and makes it as simple as fighting off kobolds.&quot;<br/><br/>"}, "58609": {"rpgitemversion": {"13858": "Hardcover Version"}, "poll": {}, "name": "Book of Hell", "rpgproducer": {"13103": "Ian Barstow"}, "average": "7", "usersrated": "1", "statistics": {}, "rpg": {"524": "d20 System / OGL Product (D&D 3.5 Compatible)"}, "rpgcategory": {"2107": "Campaign Setting (game world)"}, "rpgseries": {"1857": "Classic Play"}, "rpggenre": {"155": "Fantasy (High Fantasy)"}, "description": "From the introduction:<br/><br/>&quot;Delve into the fiery pits of Hell and confront an array of demons and devils in this infernal tome.

No other creature is quite so present, so dominant, in our stories. Almost every culture has its own tales of the serpents. Our fantasy reflects this, and dragons have been one of the defining elements of the fantasy genre for decades, and their pedigree in adventure gaming is obvious. There is good reason for this pre-eminence &ndash; no other creature has the power or the terrifying majesty of the dragons, no other creature has the curious alchemy of horror and glory that makes dragons so wonderful. On leathern wings, they soar across the skies of our imagined worlds. Their fire threatens the world, but also illuminates it.<br/><br/>The Desolation of the Dragon describes the region around a lair, and explores the effects dragons have on their environment. Watchers on the Mountain provides a system for tracking the progress of an adventuring party and the responses of the dragon and its servants. Servants of the Dragon has details on the various kinds of warriors and pawns used by dragons to defend their lairs and affect the mortal world.<br/><br/>Dragon Lairs has all the detail needed to design a dragon&rsquo;s lair, from a dank cave filled with rotting remains of previous adventurers to an ancient ruined city despoiled by the beast. When a party finally encounters the dragon, Flattery and Riddles lets them have a few last moments before the dragon employs its Tactics and Warfare to wipe them out.<br/><br/>If by some miracle the party survive, they can delve into the fabled Hoards of the dragons, or even into the carcass of their foe with reference to Anatomy of the Dragon.<br/><br/>Age Advancement presents a variant method for creating dragons especially skilled in warfare, or magic, or some other field of expertise. A selection of new Feats (with especially emphasis on the feared breath weapon) follows. The rules in those two chapters are then used as the basis of a system of Dragon Design.<br/><br/>The nightmarish fruits of that system are presented in New Dragons, ranging from the parasitical Sin Dragons to the noble Heraldic Dragon and chaotic Planar Dragons.<br/><br/>Dragon Magic has new spells and items for dragons (and their enemies). Lifecycle and the Heritage of Dragons delves into the physiology and history of the draconic species. Hatching and Raising Dragons examines the egg. Campaigning contains advice on using dragons in a game, as symbols, enemies, allies, mounts or even characters. Finally, a Mortal Miscellany deals with the response of the lesser races to the dragons.&quot;<br/><br/>"}, "58612": {"rpgitemversion": {"13819": "Hard Cover"}, "poll": {}, "name": "Book of Encounters & Lairs", "rpgproducer": {"13103": "Ian Barstow"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic811891.jpg", "usersrated": "2", "average": "7", "rpggenre": {"155": "Fantasy (High Fantasy)"}, "statistics": {}, "rpg": {"524": "d20 System / OGL Product (D&D 3.5 Compatible)"}, "rpgcategory": {"2108": "Sourcebook (rules/options to enhance play)"}, "rpgseries": {"1857": "Classic Play"}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic811891_t.jpg", "description": "From the introduction:<br/><br/>&quot;The third in the &lsquo;Classic Play&rsquo; series from Mongoose Publishing, The Book of Encounters &amp; Lairs covers a field of central importance to any d20 game in unprecedented depth and detail.

The characters are going to wander out of the safe places of the world and go looking for trouble. They will pack up their things, kiss their loved ones goodbye and head into the &lsquo;great unknown&rsquo;.<br/><br/>For the prepared Games Master, this is not a problem. There are hundreds of creatures and thousands of situations that can be encountered while travelling. If the Games Master has planned ahead of time, setting up what befalls the party is as easy as getting out the dice.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, this level of preparation is almost impossible to achieve on a constant basis. Players, being players, have a distressing tendency to step outside the boundaries of any given plot line. That is where The Book of Encounters &amp; Lairs comes in. Within these pages, Games Masters will find encounter tables, pre-made scenarios for a variety of monsters and pages of advice for Games Masters looking to make their campaign&rsquo;s encounters more enjoyable, more believable and more exciting.<br/><br/>Featuring pre-written scenarios that focus on a variety of monsters, some common and others remarkably under-utilised, that show them in two different lights, both as an encounter and at home in their lairs. These encounters can be placed in any appropriate setting and show the creature out of its typical habitat or roaming through a suitable type of terrain. Meanwhile, their lairs, though not always ones commonly associated with the creature in question, provide all the elements for adventure in and around it.<br/><br/>Encounter charts, broken up by terrain types and Challenge Ratings, allow a Games Master to select an interesting and challenging encounter for any level of play. Each table entry provides, a basic idea of how to scale creatures or Non-Player Characters to an appropriate difficulty, taking the guesswork out of figuring out how many orcs, and at what level of experience, constitute a suitable challenge for their band of adventurers.<br/><br/>With a Help for Games Masters section specifically dealing with how to run better encounters, design logical - though not stereotypical - lairs and plan out the ecology of different areas in a campaign world, linking seemingly unrelated scenarios into a coherent campaign plot line.<br/><br/>With The Book of Encounters &amp; Lairs at his side a Games Master could run an entire campaign and never need another source of scenarios!&quot;<br/><br/>"}, "58613": {"rpgitemversion": {"13820": "Hardcover Version"}, "poll": {}, "name": "Book of Adventuring", "rpgproducer": {"13103": "Ian Barstow"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic718752.jpg", "usersrated": "1", "average": "6", "rpggenre": {"155": "Fantasy (High Fantasy)"}, "statistics": {}, "rpg": {"524": "d20 System / OGL Product (D&D 3.5 Compatible)"}, "rpgcategory": {"2108": "Sourcebook (rules/options to enhance play)"}, "rpgseries": {"1857": "Classic Play"}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic718752_t.jpg", "description": "From the introduction:<br/><br/>&quot;The fourth in the &lsquo;Classic Play&rsquo; series from Mongoose Publishing, The Book of Adventuring covers a topic of focal importance to any d20 game in unprecedented depth and detail.

These vehicles of the Imperial Army and Marines provided security and reassurance as humanity expanded to bring life to the stars and defended them when those stars instead returned death. The Third Imperiumdid not win all of its wars, but it did grow to become the largest interstellar society ever known, through the ingenuity of its explorers and builders, and the courage of its soldiers.<br/>Ad then, tragically, the people of the Imperium turned these most powerful weapons onto each other destroying all that they had together built over a millennium of progress. When the irresistible force of Imperial attack met the immovable object of Imperial defense, the shock rocked the galaxy, and all that this great society had once been, all that it still had promised, all was gone.<br/>Except for one last spark of hope.<br/><br/>The Regency<br/><br/>All was gone of the Imperium except for one isolated outpost, a frontier backwater called &quot;the Marches,&quot; barely one-tenth the size of the Imperium. Facing their destruction, these people resolved to carry on the promise of the dead Imperium and preserve its heritage for the future.<br/>Here, in the new Regency, Imperial armed forces did not fight each other, because humanity, finally aware of its fragility, faced the darkness around it with unity, and the might of the former Imperial armed forces rallied to the banner of the Regency.

The game is a mix of co-operative and individual play, as typically the players can only advance on the board by sharing their income. Likewise, the draconian measures of the Tyrant usually affect all the players and not just the intended victim. The idea is to expose the Tyrant and fill everyone's resources, and the winner is the player who accomplishes the second goal after the first one has already been accomplished.<br/><br/>The three types of resource are: Food &amp; Water, Money &amp; Wealth, Education &amp; Rights.<br/><br/>The insect realms are:<br/><br/>1.

You start as the ruler of a single kingdom, but over the course of the game kingdoms can change hands, and you may find yourself wearing several crowns - or no crown at all. Your ultimate goal is to gain Glory by enriching the kingdoms you have had the opportunity to rule; when you develop a kingdom&rsquo;s institutions or increase the size of its domain by conquering new lands, you gain Glory. Accumulate enough Glory and you get to claim an Achievement, which grants all your kingdoms a special bonus or capability. When all Achievements have been claimed, the game ends and the player with the most Glory wins.<br/><br/>Blood of Kings is a unique blend of warfare, civilization building, and political maneuvering. Each turn you choose the course of action for each of your kingdoms. Will you attempt to expand militarily, or focus on developing institutions to make your kingdoms stronger, more productive, and more culturally advanced? At some point you will have to divert attention and resources away from these projects to root out enemies at court, for your rule is never truly secure - other players are your constant rivals, quietly positioning themselves to claim rights to your throne or thrust your kingdoms into violent rebellion. If you aren&rsquo;t careful, you can find your crown stripped away and given to another, forcing you into exile to brood and plot your eventual return to power.<br/><br/>Blood of Kings is card-driven, but not in the traditional manner. Each kingdom has its own hand of Kingdom cards, each of which denotes a type of action (development, raising troops, taxation, etc.), and each turn its ruler chooses one card to play from those still in hand. It is through these actions that players gain Glory and win the game. However, each player also has a hand of Dynasty cards, which he can use each turn to hinder other kingdoms, improve his political hold on his own kingdoms, or prepare to take political control of rival kingdoms.

But everyone knows that chance plays quite important role in real combats. Up till now every fusillade destroyed one battle unit (one prism), an attacking bomber squadron destroyed one battle unit of the attacked ship (one prism) and so on. Now combat rules has changed by Point Luck Card.<br/><br/>Rules:<br/><br/>A) How many dices are rolled?<br/><br/>Attacker rolls as many dices as many Battle units he use for attack. For example a fully equipped (3 prisms) battleship can use up to 3 dices. But if it have moved in the turn, you need to reduce number of dices according to number of moves.<br/><br/>If more bomber squadron attack a ship, you can use as many dices as you have squadrons (cylinders).<br/><br/>You never roll more than three dices.

So if you have (as a deffendor) one attacked Battle unit, you use first row and so on.<br/><br/>B2)Columns<br/>B2a) First row<br/><br/>To which column has a deffender to put his BU? It&acute;s only his decision.<br/><br/>Expamle: In case of one BU form columns 1-4 and 3-6 two groups. If deffendor puts his BU to number 2, his BU will be destroyed if attacker will roll 1,2,3 or 4. From previous text implies that more BU attacker has, more attamptions has to roll.<br/><br/>B2b) Second row<br/>In the second row are fields splitted to half, so columns 1-3 and 4-6 forms units. Because deffendor has two BU, he can choose whether to split them or put both BU to one section. In first case he will for sure loose at least one BU. (And of course attacker can roll the dice according to number of his attacking BU.)<br/><br/>B2c) Third row<br/>When has a deffendor three or more BU, he can place them in the third row.

What was once a world held in an uneasy detente by the threat of annihilation, has now become a world at war. Nations seek to expand their power and influence, attempting to gain dominance over their neighbors, militarily, socially, or economically.<br/><br/>Europe has coalesced into a super-state. The European Federation incorporates all of Western Europe and is now the world&rsquo;s richest and most powerful nation, exerting influence across the globe. It is not, however, without its problems, notably frictions between its member-states, and civil war in one - the United Kingdom - regarding continued membership of the alliance.<br/><br/>The United States has remained strong, but it also has its difficulties. After decades of aggressive actions against worldwide threats driven by the so-called Bush Doctrine, it is diplomatically and politically isolated. It has also come under the dominance of corporate interests who have little interest in the wider world. This introspection has caused America to underestimate the political complexity of the situation in Europe and elsewhere. Myopic vision has led to a series of overreactions and poor decisions, which have triggered a major confrontation with the Europeans called the Armageddon War. Playing Europe and America off against each other in this conflict is the Tiger Combine, an association of nine Southeast Asian nations. The Combine is the world&rsquo;s second most powerful economic force and home to the latest military invention, the WarMek. These walking tanks have revolutionized warfare, allowing the combatants to wage a very mobile and technological war, usually with the aid of Combine pilots and technicians. To the Tigers, war is business, and business is good.<br/><br/>Around the three great powers circle a host of lesser players. Russia is a staunch ally of the USA but has refused to be drawn into the Armageddon War, instead providing its ally with logistical and technical support. The Nordic League is an economic alliance of three Scandinavian states that is Europe&rsquo;s largest neutral power. It serves as an intermediary between the US and EF. Israel is an outcast nation, ignored even by America. After launching a nuclear holocaust against its neighbors, its lands are now little more than an island in the midst of a radioactive wasteland. India is the world's most populous nation and an economic powerhouse, but is driven by domestic problems and concerns of a Combine invasion. China has fragmented into a collection of warring states that jockey for position and serve as proxy battlegrounds for their Asian neighbors. Japan has recovered from decades of economic and social collapse to regain its role as a major commercial power, though national and corporate identities are virtually indistinguishable. Pro-Europe South Africa heads an alliance of southern African states against its pro-American rivals in Nigeria. Hostile to the USA after years of American intervention in its internal affairs, the drug lords of Columbia have thrown their lot in with Europe. Columbia serves as a major way station for attacks against the US and its Mexican puppet though the shattered remains of Central America. Above all political considerations are the corporations, massive trans-national entities willing to support and protect those who can afford their fees.&quot;<br/><br/>"}, "58753": {"rpgitemversion": {"13918": "Softcover Version"}, "statistics": {}, "name": "Behind Enemy Lines: Kazakhstan", "rpgproducer": {"18688": "Alexander Fennell"}, "average": "0", "usersrated": "0", "rpgsetting": {"3714": "Armageddon: 2089"}, "rpg": {"3709": "Armageddon: 2089 - Total War"}, "rpgcategory": {"2084": "Scenario / Adventure / Module"}, "poll": {}, "rpggenre": {"183": "Science Fiction"}, "description": "From the back of the book:<br/><br/>&quot;Abandoned without support, allies become enemies and enemies battlefield allies.

Or by sequestering a power with the mind-affecting descriptor, the character might gain a limited form of power resistance.<br/><br/>With over 50 brand new feats, High Psionics: Sequestral Feats grants psionic characters a variety of useful options in character development and has something for virtually any psionic character - including special feats designed for the Marksman and Society Mind classes presented in Untapped Potential: New Horizons in Psionics!<br/><br/>This 12 page PDF is written by Andreas R&ouml;nnqvist and Jeremy Smith.<br/><br/>With cover art by John Milner, interior art by Michael Hammes and V.

Verwandeln Sie sich in eine Naga, einen Hybrid aus Schlange und Elf, w&auml;hrend die Langsamkeit des Seelengiftes die Herzen Ihrer Ziele zerfrisst.<br/>- Die Rune der Verschlingerin und die Blutlockerrune sind nur eine Auswahl aus dem breiten Arsenal dunkelelfischer Waffenmeister.<br/>- Beschw&ouml;ren Sie die alles verzehrende Glutsonne von Xirr oder schaffen Sie einen Verr&auml;ter mit den M&auml;chten des Abyss.

Tragische Geister der Sehnsucht wie Druxith Tr&auml;nenzunge, erhabene Ewige Legenden wie Murn Abban der &bdquo;Menschenj&auml;ger&ldquo;, ber&uuml;chtigte Sklavenj&auml;ger wie Damarrh Thong Daigun &bdquo;die F&auml;nge der Schmerzen&ldquo; und die scheinbar gefallene Assassinenmeisterin Arachristrar Darramistyl.<br/>- Die Seuchen Xirrs wie das H&ouml;hlenfieber, das seine Opfer in Kreaturen der H&ouml;hlenwelt verwandelt, ein ganzes Arsenal an Giften und Drogen, von Neidmilch &uuml;ber Schwarzkernkirschen bis zum Zungenl&auml;hmer, sowie alchemistische Gebr&auml;ue wie das Blut der Dunklen Mutter und der Sechste Sinn Trank, erg&auml;nzen die R&uuml;stkammer der zahlreichen neuen magischen Gegenst&auml;nde, Artefakte und Relikte Xirrs.<br/>- Dem Spielleiter werden umfassende Informationen und Hilfen f&uuml;r die Leitung der intrigenreichsten Moraikampagne geboten.<br/>- Zahlreiche Abenteuerideen rund um den Machtkampf des Landes im W&uuml;rgegriff des Aschennebels: Plant Dravanna Karakas hinter undurchsichtigen Glasmauern wirklich den Aufstieg der Morai, oder wird die Verr&auml;terk&ouml;nigin beide L&auml;nder der Bruderv&ouml;lker ins Verderben st&uuml;rzen? L&uuml;ften Sie das Geheimnis um den Urdrachen Malgamra, trotzen Sie dem Wahnsinn in der ewigen Schw&auml;rze des Nachtbrunnens, oder stellen Sie sich den auferstandenen Schrecken der Tiefe, den Ghazargol-H&ouml;hlenteufeln.<br/>- Stich des Giftstachels beschreibt Xirrs Kreaturen, wie den Schwarzen Riesenskorpion, die gewaltige Xendeirox-Echse, die gef&uuml;rchtete Six Ator Sonnenspinne, und den legend&auml;ren unterirdischen Kraken. Aber auch neue Verb&uuml;ndete, wie die Wolfsratte, die Stein fressenden Irnapikith-K&auml;fer, und den auf Saugn&auml;pfen an H&ouml;hlendecken entlanglaufenden, sechsbeinigen Monkuth.<br/>- Fleisch der Schwachen bietet nicht nur eine &Uuml;bersicht &uuml;ber den Wert der wichtigsten G&uuml;ter, sondern auch eine breite Auswahl faszinierender neuer Ausr&uuml;stung wie dem Kuss der Nachtorchidee, der Rauchschnappermaske, oder der abgerichteten Riesenfledermaus.

Income generated by these enables them to raise armies and to bribe nobles, bishops and ship captains to change allegiance. Players then use secret planning and simultaneous deployment to gain control of the six areas in England and Wales and, hopefully, enough votes in parliament to crown their royal heir as king.<br/><br/>From the back of the box:<br/><br/>        Journey back to England, 1450, just prior to the outbreak of the bitter civil war between the Royal Houses of Lancaster and York. Henry VI, a Lancastrian, was proving to be a weak ruler, so the wealthy and ambitious Richard, Duke of York, looked to put things right. The powerful noble families had to choose sides and over the next 40 years, kings, royal heirs, and great nobles were to die, in what was to become known as the Wars of the Roses. Players take on the role of Lancastrians and Yorkists, who must gather support from the major towns and powerful noble families and attempt to control the royal castles throughout the country. Ports, the shipping trade, and financial aid from the Church and France are also needed. As their faction grows in strength, players vie for the King&rsquo;s favor and look to earn the prestigious titles of Captain of Calais, Archbishop of Canterbury, Warden of the Cinque Ports, Lord High Admiral and Constable of the Tower of London. Money means power, because loyalty can be bought, so players should be prepared for the inevitable treachery as nobles change allegiance at crucial times, affecting the balance of power. When Parliament is called, each region in England will support one or other of the two Royal Houses and the crown will go to the one with the greater power base. Nobles loyal to this House will be rewarded by a grateful King. Eventually, only one Royal House will boast the King, but the player who has gathered the most money and prestige will win, regardless of his allegiance.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": {"43961": "Dutch edition"}, "average": "7.35019", "name": "Wars of the Roses: Lancaster vs. York", "playingtime": "180", "boardgamemechanic": {"2689": "Action / Movement Programming"}, "age": "13", "usersrated": "1338", "boardgamesubdomain": {"5497": "Strategy Games"}, "boardgamefamily": {"14759": "Country: England"}}, "58937": {"rpgitemversion": {"14058": "Softcover Version"}, "rpgseries": {"1859": "Ultimate Series (Mongoose)"}, "name": "Ultimate Character Record Sheet", "rpgproducer": {"3": "(Uncredited)"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic620435.jpg", "usersrated": "1", "average": "6", "rpgissuearticle": {"77766": "D20 Product Reviews"}, "rpg": {"524": "d20 System / OGL Product (D&D 3.5 Compatible)"}, "poll": {}, "statistics": {}, "rpgcategory": {"2108": "Sourcebook (rules/options to enhance play)"}, "rpggenre": {"155": "Fantasy (High Fantasy)"}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic620435_t.jpg", "description": "From the back of the book:<br/><br/>&quot;The Ultimate Character Record Sheet is a must for Games Masters and Players wishing to lift their characters from the page and bring them to life.

The villagers of Belleron, overjoyed at their liberation, swore an oath to watch over these graves and let none disturb them.<br/><br/>Each year the people of Belleron have renewed this promise to keep the graves safe from robbers.
