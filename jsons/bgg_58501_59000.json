But the rift brought with it something else - a strange quantum energy which has granted certain select individuals exotic powers, abilities never seen before in the history of humanity.<br/><br/>The Shi and the Quay do not face a united human race. Centuries of exploration and expansion, of disaster and disagreement, of misunderstanding, greed and acrimony have split humanity into three distinct camps, each already at the others&rsquo; throats when the rift changed the face of the Solar System forever.<br/><br/>Five factions now war for control of the Solar System. The Earthers, ruled by giant corporations; the Gongen, descendants of those who fled the radiation-scarred wastes of Asia for the red sands of Mars; the Mavericks, pirates and rogues of the Outer Rim; the Shi, imperialistic and domineering; and the Quay, tribal, brutal and proud.<br/><br/>This universe of conflict and power was introduced in the WARS Trading Card Game from Decipher. Now, you can step inside of it, becoming a character enveloped in the aggressive conflict.<br/><br/>From the sun-scarred plains of Mercury to the frigid vacuum of the Outer Rim, battles rage across the Solar System, some fought in the open with ships and soldiers, some fought in secret with spies and assassins.

Though the WARS Rulebook contains everything a Games Master or a player absolutely needs to play a WARS Roleplaying Game campaign, Battlefront takes things a few giant leaps further.<br/><br/>Within the pages of this book, meant for Games Masters and players alike, readers will find a wealth of information to deepen and enrich their WARS campaigns.<br/><br/>Battlefront contains an in-depth look at each of the factions, detailing the Earthers, Gongen, Mavericks, Quay and Shi as never before, including background and cultural information on each, as well as tips and strategies for creating a mixed-faction group of Player Characters.<br/><br/>Those looking for more options and alternatives for characters will find a treasure of new prestige classes and kizen abilities to give Player Characters an extra edge or give Non-Player Characters a few hidden and unpleasant surprises to spring on the Player Characters themselves.<br/><br/>The WARS Roleplaying Game is not bound to a single planet or moon - rather, the plotlines and Player Characters tend to range throughout the Solar System. Battlefront offers an enormous section on the Solar System itself, detailing the background and physical aspects of each of the planets, as well as major moons, asteroids and even space stations. From the surface temperature of Mercury to the necessary escape velocity of Charon, from the penal colonies of Io to the boomtowns and brush wars of Titan, this exhaustively researched section of Battlefront holds all the answers. The section on travel in the Solar System brings it all together, giving Games Masters rules and guidelines for determining how long a trip from Earth to Europa will take, or how much time is required for a transmission from Gongen to reach Ceres.<br/><br/>Packed with even more information, Battlefront is an invaluable addition to any WARS Roleplaying Game campaign.&quot;<br/><br/>"}, "58545": {"rpgdesigner": ["Tim Bancroft", "Ian Barstow", "Vincent Darlage", "Greg Lynch", "Nick Robinson", "James Robinson", "Erik K.

Let this be your guide to the secrets within.<br/><br/>Ages ago, war engulfed the world of Unlond in an epic conflict. For long years an alliance of humans, elves and dwarves fought against the evil forces of the Dark Prince Tidur. Finally, the Dark Prince was struck down on the field of battle and his forces withdrew to their homelands. Now, centuries later, the embers of that war still burn in the hearts of many. Peace has never been more than just a stalemate between the forces of evil and the alliance that opposes them.<br/><br/>Ill omens abound now. A plague swept through the northern lands last winter, weakening the nations of the alliance. Strange creatures have been sighted and sages fear that war will return to Unlond. Now is the time for heros, for new legends and new stories of valor and diplomacy to be made. Now is the time for you to experience the power and magic of Enchanted Worlds<br/><br/>In this game of fantasy roleplaying you and your friends take on the roles of heros fighting against the forces of evil and treachery. Each player has a character, your hero that you roleplay. One person must take on the role of the gamemaster, who is responsible for creating the storyline, describing the setting of the adventure to the players and interpreting the rules.<br/><br/>The rules are easy to learn and quick to use. Each player spends points to raise the character's Attributes, eight scores that represent the character's innate abilities. Players then pick Skills for their characters. There are dozens of Skills to choose from. Any combination is possible, from a sneaky fighter to a sword-wielding wizard to an expert hunter or anything else you can imagine. Each character is as unique as each player.<br/><br/>Inside this box you'll find the complete rules for playing Enchanted Worlds games, a sample character sheet that can be photocopied for player use, a reference card with all the most commonly used charts and tables and a full color 11&quot; x 17&quot; map of Unlond.The game also includes two eight sided dice (all the dice needed for playing the game) with a special dice bag and Autumn Harvest the first adventure for the Seasons of Change storyline. The adventure has four sample characters, so you can play now without needing to make new characters.<br/><br/>Perhaps most importantly, the Enchanted Worlds Starter Kit is part of the New Worlds Game System. After you learn the rules of Enchanted Worlds, you'll be able to pick up either Distant Worlds (our science fiction setting), Fantastic Worlds (science-fantasy) or any other setting when they become available and begin to play immediately!<br/><br/>"}, "58567": {"rpgartist": ["Ralf Berszuck", "Zoltan Boros", "Caryad", "Arndt Drechsler", "Ina Irrgang", "Alexander Jung", "Susi Michels", "Swen Papenbrock", "Sabine Weiss", "Eva Zimmermann"], "rpgitemversion": ["2nd printing", "3rd printing", "hardcover", "PDF Version"], "poll": [], "name": "Von eigenen Gnaden", "rpgdesigner": ["Jens Fichtner", "Marcus Friedrich", "Martin John", "Uli Lindner", "Michael Masberg", "Anton Weste"], "rpgproducer": ["Florian Don-Schauen", "Uli Lindner", "Thomas R\u00f6mer", "Anton Weste"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic577344.jpg", "usersrated": "5", "rpgsetting": ["Aventurien"], "average": "7.4", "statistics": [], "rpggenre": ["Fantasy", "Politics / Government"], "rpgpublisher": ["Ulisses Spiele"], "rpg": ["Das Schwarze Auge (DSA) (4th Edition)"], "rpgcategory": ["Scenario / Adventure / Module"], "rpgseries": ["Ausbau Abenteuer", "Wildermark-Kampagne"], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic577344_t.jpg", "description": "(user summary)<br/>This campaign installs the PCs as warrior kings in a war zone of the empire Mittelreich called Wildermark.<br/>They have to stabilize the reagion by diplomacy with the neighboring warrior kings, ruling their region with justice (or a strong fist), fulfilling some quests and of course by warfare.<br/>This campaign is highly unusual for the Das Schwarze Auge roleplaying game as it pitches the player in positions of power.<br/><br/>"}, "58568": {"rpgartist": ["Randy Asplund-Faith", "Chuck Bordell", "Catherine Burnett", "Ron Chironna", "Gary Kwapisz", "Christian Martinez", "John Mundt"], "rpgitemversion": ["Box set", "Box Set (w/Insta-Play Kit and Errata)"], "statistics": [], "name": "NeverWorld", "rpgdesigner": ["Troy Delzer", "Richard E.

The guidelines and suggestions within this book have been designed to allow players to move from the thought &rsquo;lets role play in this setting...&rsquo; to actually<br/>playing within a matter of minutes. The character design system is quick and intuitive, allowing you to play any kind of character you desire, and the dice mechanics are easy to learn, and very simple to use.<br/>Vignette is also universal.

It is a basic system around which you may create your own settings and stories.

The planes are a far grander stage for adventure than the mundane wilderness and dungeons of the world.

Beginning with the elemental planes of Earth, Air, Fire and Water, travel outwards through the transitive Ethereal, Shadow and the Dream planes to the wild planes of Positive and Negative energy. Beyond them, the wide gulf of the Astral plane and the vast Outer Planes.<br/><br/>Presented within are ten entirely new outer planes, along with suggestions for how to arrange and integrate them into your campaign cosmology including the dark realm known as M&acirc;l, where ancient horrors are awakening and the Questing Grounds, the realm of living stories. Including rules for each of these planes, according to a set of magical traits, along with the secrets of the art of Planecrafting, characters can shape their own home plane or wreak havoc by changing the laws of reality.<br/><br/>Travellers do not walk the planes alone, however, there are all sorts of fellow travellers out there, including reality-spanning organisations with their own agendas and conspiracies. Along with advice and new magic for travelling the planes, the wise traveller will consider using one of the Nexus planes; pocket worlds that share boarders with a multitude of other planes.<br/><br/>This tome tackles the mind-boggling complexity of the planes and travel throughout them head on and makes it as simple as fighting off kobolds.&quot;<br/><br/>"}, "58609": {"rpgdesigner": ["Adrian Bott", "Richard Ford"], "rpgitemversion": ["Hardcover Version", "PDF Version"], "poll": [], "name": "Book of Hell", "rpgartist": ["Tim Brady", "Jim Brady", "Vincent Hie", "Ricardo Jaime", "Danilo Moretti", "R.

No other creature is quite so present, so dominant, in our stories. Almost every culture has its own tales of the serpents. Our fantasy reflects this, and dragons have been one of the defining elements of the fantasy genre for decades, and their pedigree in adventure gaming is obvious. There is good reason for this pre-eminence &ndash; no other creature has the power or the terrifying majesty of the dragons, no other creature has the curious alchemy of horror and glory that makes dragons so wonderful. On leathern wings, they soar across the skies of our imagined worlds. Their fire threatens the world, but also illuminates it.<br/><br/>The Desolation of the Dragon describes the region around a lair, and explores the effects dragons have on their environment. Watchers on the Mountain provides a system for tracking the progress of an adventuring party and the responses of the dragon and its servants. Servants of the Dragon has details on the various kinds of warriors and pawns used by dragons to defend their lairs and affect the mortal world.<br/><br/>Dragon Lairs has all the detail needed to design a dragon&rsquo;s lair, from a dank cave filled with rotting remains of previous adventurers to an ancient ruined city despoiled by the beast. When a party finally encounters the dragon, Flattery and Riddles lets them have a few last moments before the dragon employs its Tactics and Warfare to wipe them out.<br/><br/>If by some miracle the party survive, they can delve into the fabled Hoards of the dragons, or even into the carcass of their foe with reference to Anatomy of the Dragon.<br/><br/>Age Advancement presents a variant method for creating dragons especially skilled in warfare, or magic, or some other field of expertise. A selection of new Feats (with especially emphasis on the feared breath weapon) follows. The rules in those two chapters are then used as the basis of a system of Dragon Design.<br/><br/>The nightmarish fruits of that system are presented in New Dragons, ranging from the parasitical Sin Dragons to the noble Heraldic Dragon and chaotic Planar Dragons.<br/><br/>Dragon Magic has new spells and items for dragons (and their enemies). Lifecycle and the Heritage of Dragons delves into the physiology and history of the draconic species. Hatching and Raising Dragons examines the egg. Campaigning contains advice on using dragons in a game, as symbols, enemies, allies, mounts or even characters. Finally, a Mortal Miscellany deals with the response of the lesser races to the dragons.&quot;<br/><br/>"}, "58612": {"rpgartist": ["Shane Coppage", "Carlos Henry", "Ralph Horsley", "Danilo Moretti", "Tony Parker", "Philip Renne", "Stephen Shepherd", "Patricio Soler", "Alejandro Villen"], "rpgitemversion": ["Hard Cover", "PDF Version"], "poll": [], "name": "Book of Encounters & Lairs", "rpgdesigner": ["August Hahn", "Gareth Hanrahan"], "rpgproducer": ["Ian Barstow", "Ian Belcher", "Alexander Fennell", "Gareth Hanrahan", "Richard Neale"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic811891.jpg", "usersrated": "2", "average": "7", "rpggenre": ["Fantasy (High Fantasy)"], "statistics": [], "rpg": ["d20 System / OGL Product (D&D 3.5 Compatible)"], "rpgpublisher": ["Mongoose Publishing"], "rpgcategory": ["Sourcebook (rules/options to enhance play)"], "rpgseries": ["Classic Play"], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic811891_t.jpg", "description": "From the introduction:<br/><br/>&quot;The third in the &lsquo;Classic Play&rsquo; series from Mongoose Publishing, The Book of Encounters &amp; Lairs covers a field of central importance to any d20 game in unprecedented depth and detail.

The characters are going to wander out of the safe places of the world and go looking for trouble. They will pack up their things, kiss their loved ones goodbye and head into the &lsquo;great unknown&rsquo;.<br/><br/>For the prepared Games Master, this is not a problem. There are hundreds of creatures and thousands of situations that can be encountered while travelling. If the Games Master has planned ahead of time, setting up what befalls the party is as easy as getting out the dice.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, this level of preparation is almost impossible to achieve on a constant basis. Players, being players, have a distressing tendency to step outside the boundaries of any given plot line. That is where The Book of Encounters &amp; Lairs comes in. Within these pages, Games Masters will find encounter tables, pre-made scenarios for a variety of monsters and pages of advice for Games Masters looking to make their campaign&rsquo;s encounters more enjoyable, more believable and more exciting.<br/><br/>Featuring pre-written scenarios that focus on a variety of monsters, some common and others remarkably under-utilised, that show them in two different lights, both as an encounter and at home in their lairs. These encounters can be placed in any appropriate setting and show the creature out of its typical habitat or roaming through a suitable type of terrain. Meanwhile, their lairs, though not always ones commonly associated with the creature in question, provide all the elements for adventure in and around it.<br/><br/>Encounter charts, broken up by terrain types and Challenge Ratings, allow a Games Master to select an interesting and challenging encounter for any level of play. Each table entry provides, a basic idea of how to scale creatures or Non-Player Characters to an appropriate difficulty, taking the guesswork out of figuring out how many orcs, and at what level of experience, constitute a suitable challenge for their band of adventurers.<br/><br/>With a Help for Games Masters section specifically dealing with how to run better encounters, design logical - though not stereotypical - lairs and plan out the ecology of different areas in a campaign world, linking seemingly unrelated scenarios into a coherent campaign plot line.<br/><br/>With The Book of Encounters &amp; Lairs at his side a Games Master could run an entire campaign and never need another source of scenarios!&quot;<br/><br/>"}, "58613": {"rpgartist": ["Reynaldo Batista", "Brent Chumley", "Moyses Damasceno", "David Esbri", "Carlos Henry", "Ralph Horsley", "Danilo Moretti", "Tony Parker", "Patricio Soler", "Alejandro Villen"], "rpgitemversion": ["Hardcover Version", "PDF Version"], "poll": [], "name": "Book of Adventuring", "rpgdesigner": ["Adrian Bott", "Alejandro Melchor"], "rpgproducer": ["Ian Barstow", "Alexander Fennell", "Alejandro Melchor", "Richard Neale"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic718752.jpg", "usersrated": "1", "average": "6", "rpggenre": ["Fantasy (High Fantasy)"], "statistics": [], "rpg": ["d20 System / OGL Product (D&D 3.5 Compatible)"], "rpgpublisher": ["Mongoose Publishing"], "rpgcategory": ["Sourcebook (rules/options to enhance play)"], "rpgseries": ["Classic Play"], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic718752_t.jpg", "description": "From the introduction:<br/><br/>&quot;The fourth in the &lsquo;Classic Play&rsquo; series from Mongoose Publishing, The Book of Adventuring covers a topic of focal importance to any d20 game in unprecedented depth and detail.

Anything you desire is available in this city of over a million people.

Welcome to Rome.<br/><br/>Cthulhu Invictus is a new setting for Chaosium's Call of Cthulhu RPG.

The Third Imperiumdid not win all of its wars, but it did grow to become the largest interstellar society ever known, through the ingenuity of its explorers and builders, and the courage of its soldiers.<br/>Ad then, tragically, the people of the Imperium turned these most powerful weapons onto each other destroying all that they had together built over a millennium of progress.

The game takes place in a fantasy world of insects that is secretly ruled by the evil Tyrant and his sidekick Niljake (Slimy). In the beginning, the insect realms have different amounts of resources; some are poor while some have plenty. The poorest player, being the most desperate and thus also bravest, starts. The game is a mix of co-operative and individual play, as typically the players can only advance on the board by sharing their income.

You start as the ruler of a single kingdom, but over the course of the game kingdoms can change hands, and you may find yourself wearing several crowns - or no crown at all. Your ultimate goal is to gain Glory by enriching the kingdoms you have had the opportunity to rule; when you develop a kingdom&rsquo;s institutions or increase the size of its domain by conquering new lands, you gain Glory. Accumulate enough Glory and you get to claim an Achievement, which grants all your kingdoms a special bonus or capability. When all Achievements have been claimed, the game ends and the player with the most Glory wins.<br/><br/>Blood of Kings is a unique blend of warfare, civilization building, and political maneuvering. Each turn you choose the course of action for each of your kingdoms. Will you attempt to expand militarily, or focus on developing institutions to make your kingdoms stronger, more productive, and more culturally advanced? At some point you will have to divert attention and resources away from these projects to root out enemies at court, for your rule is never truly secure - other players are your constant rivals, quietly positioning themselves to claim rights to your throne or thrust your kingdoms into violent rebellion. If you aren&rsquo;t careful, you can find your crown stripped away and given to another, forcing you into exile to brood and plot your eventual return to power.<br/><br/>Blood of Kings is card-driven, but not in the traditional manner. Each kingdom has its own hand of Kingdom cards, each of which denotes a type of action (development, raising troops, taxation, etc.), and each turn its ruler chooses one card to play from those still in hand. It is through these actions that players gain Glory and win the game. However, each player also has a hand of Dynasty cards, which he can use each turn to hinder other kingdoms, improve his political hold on his own kingdoms, or prepare to take political control of rival kingdoms. Therefore, each player must work not only to expand and improve his kingdoms, but to defend his kingdoms against political rivals while positioning himself to take over as many kingdoms as possible.<br/><br/>The game is of the free D.I.Y. variety - you will have to print your own components. Playing time is scalable. Since the game ends when all available Achievements have been claimed, you can set up a short game by using only a few Achievements, or create a truly epic game by making all of the Achievements available.<br/><br/>"}, "58706": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic576315.jpg", "poll": [], "boardgamedesigner": ["(Uncredited)"], "statistics": [], "yearpublished": "2009", "maxplayers": "4", "boardgameartist": ["(Uncredited)"], "boardgamepublisher": ["Alex Toys"], "maxplaytime": "15", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic576315_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "15", "boardgamecategory": ["Children's Game"], "description": "A children's game.

But everyone knows that chance plays quite important role in real combats. Up till now every fusillade destroyed one battle unit (one prism), an attacking bomber squadron destroyed one battle unit of the attacked ship (one prism) and so on. Now combat rules has changed by Point Luck Card.<br/><br/>Rules:<br/><br/>A) How many dices are rolled?<br/><br/>Attacker rolls as many dices as many Battle units he use for attack. For example a fully equipped (3 prisms) battleship can use up to 3 dices. But if it have moved in the turn, you need to reduce number of dices according to number of moves.<br/><br/>If more bomber squadron attack a ship, you can use as many dices as you have squadrons (cylinders).<br/><br/>You never roll more than three dices. The fourth, fifth etc. attack is always succesfull.<br/><br/>You can, of course, use only one dice and roll it more times up to number set above.<br/><br/>You can stop your attack at any moment and use your actions to move out.<br/><br/>B)Where put deffender his Battle units<br/><br/>B1) Rows<br/>According to number of Battle units uses deffender the first, second or third row of Point Luck Card.<br/><br/>The first row has a symbol of one Battle unit, second row has a symbol (prism) of two and third row of three (or more) battle units. So if you have (as a deffendor) one attacked Battle unit, you use first row and so on.<br/><br/>B2)Columns<br/>B2a) First row<br/><br/>To which column has a deffender to put his BU? It&acute;s only his decision.<br/><br/>Expamle: In case of one BU form columns 1-4 and 3-6 two groups. If deffendor puts his BU to number 2, his BU will be destroyed if attacker will roll 1,2,3 or 4. From previous text implies that more BU attacker has, more attamptions has to roll.<br/><br/>B2b) Second row<br/>In the second row are fields splitted to half, so columns 1-3 and 4-6 forms units. Because deffendor has two BU, he can choose whether to split them or put both BU to one section. In first case he will for sure loose at least one BU. (And of course attacker can roll the dice according to number of his attacking BU.)<br/><br/>B2c) Third row<br/>When has a deffendor three or more BU, he can place them in the third row. Here fields 1-2, 3-4 and 5-6 forms units.<br/>When is the Point Luck Card used?<br/><br/>C) Point Luck Card is used all the time when:<br/><br/><br/>     battleship fires<br/>     bombers attack<br/>     fighters attack bombers (even in case when it is turn of player whose bombers try to flight through place where enemy&acute;s fighters are.<br/>     whne fighter shoots on un-armed fighter <br/><br/><br/>D) And when NOT to use the Point Luck Card?<br/><br/>Point Luck Card is not used in case of:<br/><br/><br/>     battalions combat<br/>     armed fighters combat <br/><br/><br/>"}, "58745": {"boardgamedesigner": ["Liam Bryan", "Marcella Florence", "Erskin Meldrew"], "poll": [], "name": "Invaders of Mars", "playingtime": "0", "minplayers": "2", "yearpublished": "2001", "usersrated": "3", "boardgamesubdomain": ["Abstract Games"], "maxplayers": "4", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic582613_t.jpg", "boardgameversion": ["Print and Play edition"], "average": "6.58333", "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["(Web published)"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic582613.jpg", "boardgamefamily": ["Aliens", "Looney Pyramids", "Mars"], "maxplaytime": "0", "boardgamecategory": ["Abstract Strategy", "Science Fiction"], "age": "10", "minplaytime": "0", "description": "Invaders of Mars is a board game for two or more players using Icehouse pieces set in the genre of the B-rated sci-fi thriller movie.

Whether working for a nation state, a coporation or as part of a mercenary company, foot soldiers in 2089 define versatility, choosing their careers in different fields of warfare, with covert operations and military intelligence as much a part as special forces and demolitions training.<br/><br/>The Soldier's companion opens the way to playing campaigns focusing on the subtler aspects of war, far from the deafening roar of WarMek weapons. The first chapter offers an insight into the meaning of being a soldier in a world where wars are fought between metal titans; who the soldiers are and what they do to stay alive. The Advanced Operative presents prestige classes for soldier and officer characters, broadening their fields of expertise while specialising their talents in a certain area of personal combat and general warfare. new feats follow, with options for honing an operative's skills. Cover missions explores the shady world of espionage and inflitration, while Unconventional Warfare provides a look at the dirty side of war: black ops and irregular warfare.

What was once a world held in an uneasy detente by the threat of annihilation, has now become a world at war. Nations seek to expand their power and influence, attempting to gain dominance over their neighbors, militarily, socially, or economically.<br/><br/>Europe has coalesced into a super-state. The European Federation incorporates all of Western Europe and is now the world&rsquo;s richest and most powerful nation, exerting influence across the globe. It is not, however, without its problems, notably frictions between its member-states, and civil war in one - the United Kingdom - regarding continued membership of the alliance.<br/><br/>The United States has remained strong, but it also has its difficulties. After decades of aggressive actions against worldwide threats driven by the so-called Bush Doctrine, it is diplomatically and politically isolated. It has also come under the dominance of corporate interests who have little interest in the wider world. This introspection has caused America to underestimate the political complexity of the situation in Europe and elsewhere. Myopic vision has led to a series of overreactions and poor decisions, which have triggered a major confrontation with the Europeans called the Armageddon War. Playing Europe and America off against each other in this conflict is the Tiger Combine, an association of nine Southeast Asian nations. The Combine is the world&rsquo;s second most powerful economic force and home to the latest military invention, the WarMek. These walking tanks have revolutionized warfare, allowing the combatants to wage a very mobile and technological war, usually with the aid of Combine pilots and technicians. To the Tigers, war is business, and business is good.<br/><br/>Around the three great powers circle a host of lesser players. Russia is a staunch ally of the USA but has refused to be drawn into the Armageddon War, instead providing its ally with logistical and technical support. The Nordic League is an economic alliance of three Scandinavian states that is Europe&rsquo;s largest neutral power. It serves as an intermediary between the US and EF. Israel is an outcast nation, ignored even by America. After launching a nuclear holocaust against its neighbors, its lands are now little more than an island in the midst of a radioactive wasteland. India is the world's most populous nation and an economic powerhouse, but is driven by domestic problems and concerns of a Combine invasion. China has fragmented into a collection of warring states that jockey for position and serve as proxy battlegrounds for their Asian neighbors. Japan has recovered from decades of economic and social collapse to regain its role as a major commercial power, though national and corporate identities are virtually indistinguishable. Pro-Europe South Africa heads an alliance of southern African states against its pro-American rivals in Nigeria. Hostile to the USA after years of American intervention in its internal affairs, the drug lords of Columbia have thrown their lot in with Europe. Columbia serves as a major way station for attacks against the US and its Mexican puppet though the shattered remains of Central America. Above all political considerations are the corporations, massive trans-national entities willing to support and protect those who can afford their fees.&quot;<br/><br/>"}, "58753": {"rpgartist": ["Stephen Cook"], "rpgitemversion": ["Softcover Version"], "statistics": [], "name": "Behind Enemy Lines: Kazakhstan", "rpgdesigner": ["August Hahn"], "rpgproducer": ["Alexander Fennell"], "average": "0", "usersrated": "0", "rpgsetting": ["Armageddon: 2089"], "rpg": ["Armageddon: 2089 - Total War"], "rpgpublisher": ["Mongoose Publishing"], "rpgcategory": ["Scenario / Adventure / Module", "Sourcebook (rules/options to enhance play)"], "poll": [], "rpggenre": ["Science Fiction", "War"], "description": "From the back of the book:<br/><br/>&quot;Abandoned without support, allies become enemies and enemies battlefield allies.

Das vierte Arcane Codex L&auml;nderquellenbuch: Xirr Nagesh, Das Land der Dunkelelfen, beschreibt das Reich der dunklen Mutterg&ouml;ttin.<br/>Auf 368 Seiten findet sich alles, was Sie und ihre Schatten auf dem Flug &uuml;ber brennende Magmafelder ben&ouml;tigen:<br/>- Mit der Landkarte Xirr Nageshs, der Karte des Unterweltreiches Xirr Nator und den Stadtkarten behalten Sie auch bei Erdbeben und Sporenwolken die Orientierung.<br/>- Durchschauen Sie das Intrigennetz &uuml;ber Dynastien der Machtgier, lauschen Sie der Doktrin der Sechs H&auml;nde Anaranths, der Propheten der Schl&auml;chterin &ndash; bis zum opferreichen Ringen der Abbankrieger gegen die H&ouml;hlenteufel der Ghazargol in der Finsternis der endlosen Unterwelt. Wird der aus dem Mutterleib geschnittene, ungewollte Sohn von Licht und Schatten das Land im Inferno seines Schmerzes verbrennen lassen? Oder kann die Wucht der Schuld von Generationen, manifestiert als Bedrohung aus dem Blutmeer, mit Fleisch und Stahl &uuml;berwunden werden?<br/>- Der geisterhafte Gaak Zuul Wald, das Gl&auml;serne Meer, das Sonnenlose Tal und die Verlockungen des Palastes der Verr&auml;ter lassen den bitteren Geschmack von Schwefel und Asche vergessen.<br/>- Das Land Xirr Nagesh wird in allen Themenbereichen wie Mode, Freizeit und Vergn&uuml;gen, Architektur, Politik, Recht, Rohstoffversorgung, seiner sozialen Ordnung und seiner bizarren Kunst beschrieben.<br/>- Die Traditionen der fanatischen Schattenkrieger sind gepr&auml;gt von tiefer Religiosit&auml;t, dem Hunger nach Leben und dem Zwang, sich st&auml;ndig beweisen zu m&uuml;ssen: Der Todeskalender verlangt f&uuml;r jeden geborenen Schattenelf das Blutopfer eines Feindes. Das Recht ein Kind zu zeugen muss sich in der Arena des Zenir Thar verdient werden. Allein die &bdquo;Maske des Narren&ldquo; sch&uuml;tzt vor dem Zorn der Hexenmutter als Schild gegen Unterdr&uuml;ckung und verlorene Stimme freier Gedanken im tosenden Raunen dogmatischer Litaneien.<br/>- Die Herrschaftsgebiete der adligen H&auml;user Xirrs und die Flammenfestung der abtr&uuml;nnigen Sorloth-Hexer bestechen mit magischer Exotik: Testen Sie Ihren Instinkt in den Todeslabyrinthen der Nachtgeister, entdecken Sie als Sp&auml;her der Augen der Tiefe kristallene H&ouml;hlen, die die Kl&auml;nge des ganzen Landes einfangen, oder erweitern Sie das Jagdrevier der Hexenm&uuml;tter um einen neuen St&uuml;tzpunkt.<br/>- Reisen Sie auf den fliegenden Yachten der Sorceryn-Hexer zur heiligen Stadt Gael Naroth in den Lavaebenen von Carnex, wo die Geisterheere verstorbener Elfen bis in alle Ewigkeit um die Gunst ihrer verfeindeten G&ouml;tter ringen.<br/>- Mit den neuen Fertigkeiten meistern Sie die Worte des Zorns, die die Mutterg&ouml;ttin ihrem untreuen G&ouml;ttergatten bei der Spaltung des Landes entgegenschleuderte, oder lernen Sie den t&ouml;dlichen Einsatz der Besarxar-Klingenr&uuml;stung.<br/>- Neue Vorz&uuml;ge und Schw&auml;chen: Gleich ob Sie als Adrathar die Garde Ihres Hauses f&uuml;hren oder als Jianri no Anakaxarr, als Meister des Mordens, die n&auml;chste Assassinengeneration ausbilden, mit den mystischen Blutlinien der H&auml;user in Ihren Adern wandern Sie &uuml;ber gl&uuml;hende Obsidianw&uuml;sten und stemmen sich gegen den Flammensturm der zornigen Seelen der Unterwelt, der Sishkari.<br/>- Als Draxxari walzen Sie mit Ihrer Kriegsechse wie ein Sturm aus Klauen, F&auml;ngen und Tod alle Feinde nieder.<br/>- Der Stolz der Heiligen Krieger Anaranths erlaubt Ihnen nicht, dass die unw&uuml;rdigen Klingen der Feinde Ihr Blut schmecken, w&auml;hrend Sie im Rausch des Blutmeeres dunkelrote Font&auml;nen in den Aschenhimmel &uuml;ber Xirr peitschen lassen.<br/>- Elegant und fragil tanzt der Xithajian &ndash; der T&ouml;dliche Schmetterling &ndash; mit seinen F&auml;chern zwischen brennenden Himmelsrosen, um selbst die M&auml;chtigsten im Bann des Schattens &uuml;ber der Magmasee die Leidenschaft einer verlorenen wahren Liebe sp&uuml;ren zu lassen.<br/>- Mit H&ouml;llenknall und Qualenbringer halten die Sklavenj&auml;ger das Pack in Schach, bevor sie es verstrickt in ihre Peitsche in die Klinge springen lassen. Jedoch nicht, ohne vorher den Willen mit einer Schandnarbe zu brechen.<br/>- Entflohene Sklaven, asketische Moraikrieger &ndash; die Sch&uuml;ler der Kettenpeitsche haben die eiserne Umarmung 1000 st&auml;hlerner Kobras gemeistert, ihre Fesseln am schw&auml;chsten Glied gebrochen und beherrschen nun die mystische Kraft der Henkerkette.<br/>- Sp&uuml;ren Sie als Skorpionkrieger herannahende Gefahren durch die Vibrationen der Erde, verwandeln Sie sich in einen Hybrid aus Skorpion und Elf, bevor Sie beim Tanz der Skorpione den gef&uuml;rchteten Blutbahntreffer anbringen.<br/>- Als Assassine der Kelasith sprechen Sie mit der Zunge der Schattennatter, sto&szlig;en schneller zu als die Obsidiankobra und paralysieren den Gegner mit den schwarzen Augen der Nachtviper. Verwandeln Sie sich in eine Naga, einen Hybrid aus Schlange und Elf, w&auml;hrend die Langsamkeit des Seelengiftes die Herzen Ihrer Ziele zerfrisst.<br/>- Die Rune der Verschlingerin und die Blutlockerrune sind nur eine Auswahl aus dem breiten Arsenal dunkelelfischer Waffenmeister.<br/>- Beschw&ouml;ren Sie die alles verzehrende Glutsonne von Xirr oder schaffen Sie einen Verr&auml;ter mit den M&auml;chten des Abyss. Der nekromantische Totenbaum ist Ihr Aug und Ohr.<br/>- Lesen Sie aus der Ged&auml;rmekarte den grausigen Pfad, der Ihre Seele aus der Dunkelheit f&uuml;hrt &ndash; oder tiefer in sie hinein&hellip;<br/>- St&uuml;rmerschwert, Schlangenklinge, Sporengranate und viele andere warten auf die Hand eines ge&uuml;bten Schattenkriegers. Bek&auml;mpfen Sie die Schrecken der Magmasee mit Doppelklingenbeil, Lebensl&ouml;scherschwert, Skorpionschere und vielem mehr.<br/>- Das verfluchte Abyssinium-Metall entfesselt nicht nur das Potential des Tr&auml;gers, sondern auch d&auml;monische Mutationen, w&auml;hrend glitzerndes Xaraxit die arkanen M&auml;chte st&auml;rkt und die k&ouml;rperlichen schw&auml;cht. Das fantastische Xiridium erweicht in K&auml;lte und wird in gro&szlig;er Hitze umso h&auml;rter.<br/>- Xen Karn Sing, Sporenklinge und Lebendige Seidenr&uuml;stung geh&ouml;ren zu den zahlreichen Sch&auml;tzen, die Helden aus den Klauen der Azen Porzellankrieger oder dem tiefen Scho&szlig; der Xaras-Minen entrei&szlig;en k&ouml;nnen.<br/>- Um an die Sch&auml;tze paranoider Hexenm&uuml;tter und verbrannter St&auml;dte zu gelangen, m&uuml;ssen Sie das gro&szlig;e Rennen Anashaz quer durch das t&ouml;dlichste Land Kreijors gewinnen, oder dem Giftbankett Mox Fertinax im Mykonidenwald eine neue biologische Waffe entwinden.<br/>- Starten Sie das Abenteuer sofort mit einem der spielbaren Archetypen wie dem Echsenritter, der Inquisitorin Anaranths, der freiheitsliebenden Korsarin oder dem Skorpionkrieger.<br/>- Die Arme der G&ouml;ttin sind ehrgeizige Hexenm&uuml;tter wie die &bdquo;Traumf&auml;ngerin&ldquo; Lorikrielle Ben Ator, und die rachs&uuml;chtige, von ihrer allm&auml;chtigen Mutter gedem&uuml;tigte Arrakna Tyrannor. Tragische Geister der Sehnsucht wie Druxith Tr&auml;nenzunge, erhabene Ewige Legenden wie Murn Abban der &bdquo;Menschenj&auml;ger&ldquo;, ber&uuml;chtigte Sklavenj&auml;ger wie Damarrh Thong Daigun &bdquo;die F&auml;nge der Schmerzen&ldquo; und die scheinbar gefallene Assassinenmeisterin Arachristrar Darramistyl.<br/>- Die Seuchen Xirrs wie das H&ouml;hlenfieber, das seine Opfer in Kreaturen der H&ouml;hlenwelt verwandelt, ein ganzes Arsenal an Giften und Drogen, von Neidmilch &uuml;ber Schwarzkernkirschen bis zum Zungenl&auml;hmer, sowie alchemistische Gebr&auml;ue wie das Blut der Dunklen Mutter und der Sechste Sinn Trank, erg&auml;nzen die R&uuml;stkammer der zahlreichen neuen magischen Gegenst&auml;nde, Artefakte und Relikte Xirrs.<br/>- Dem Spielleiter werden umfassende Informationen und Hilfen f&uuml;r die Leitung der intrigenreichsten Moraikampagne geboten.<br/>- Zahlreiche Abenteuerideen rund um den Machtkampf des Landes im W&uuml;rgegriff des Aschennebels: Plant Dravanna Karakas hinter undurchsichtigen Glasmauern wirklich den Aufstieg der Morai, oder wird die Verr&auml;terk&ouml;nigin beide L&auml;nder der Bruderv&ouml;lker ins Verderben st&uuml;rzen? L&uuml;ften Sie das Geheimnis um den Urdrachen Malgamra, trotzen Sie dem Wahnsinn in der ewigen Schw&auml;rze des Nachtbrunnens, oder stellen Sie sich den auferstandenen Schrecken der Tiefe, den Ghazargol-H&ouml;hlenteufeln.<br/>- Stich des Giftstachels beschreibt Xirrs Kreaturen, wie den Schwarzen Riesenskorpion, die gewaltige Xendeirox-Echse, die gef&uuml;rchtete Six Ator Sonnenspinne, und den legend&auml;ren unterirdischen Kraken. Aber auch neue Verb&uuml;ndete, wie die Wolfsratte, die Stein fressenden Irnapikith-K&auml;fer, und den auf Saugn&auml;pfen an H&ouml;hlendecken entlanglaufenden, sechsbeinigen Monkuth.<br/>- Fleisch der Schwachen bietet nicht nur eine &Uuml;bersicht &uuml;ber den Wert der wichtigsten G&uuml;ter, sondern auch eine breite Auswahl faszinierender neuer Ausr&uuml;stung wie dem Kuss der Nachtorchidee, der Rauchschnappermaske, oder der abgerichteten Riesenfledermaus.

Income generated by these enables them to raise armies and to bribe nobles, bishops and ship captains to change allegiance. Players then use secret planning and simultaneous deployment to gain control of the six areas in England and Wales and, hopefully, enough votes in parliament to crown their royal heir as king.<br/><br/>From the back of the box:<br/><br/>        Journey back to England, 1450, just prior to the outbreak of the bitter civil war between the Royal Houses of Lancaster and York. Henry VI, a Lancastrian, was proving to be a weak ruler, so the wealthy and ambitious Richard, Duke of York, looked to put things right. The powerful noble families had to choose sides and over the next 40 years, kings, royal heirs, and great nobles were to die, in what was to become known as the Wars of the Roses. Players take on the role of Lancastrians and Yorkists, who must gather support from the major towns and powerful noble families and attempt to control the royal castles throughout the country. Ports, the shipping trade, and financial aid from the Church and France are also needed. As their faction grows in strength, players vie for the King&rsquo;s favor and look to earn the prestigious titles of Captain of Calais, Archbishop of Canterbury, Warden of the Cinque Ports, Lord High Admiral and Constable of the Tower of London. Money means power, because loyalty can be bought, so players should be prepared for the inevitable treachery as nobles change allegiance at crucial times, affecting the balance of power. When Parliament is called, each region in England will support one or other of the two Royal Houses and the crown will go to the one with the greater power base. Nobles loyal to this House will be rewarded by a grateful King. Eventually, only one Royal House will boast the King, but the player who has gathered the most money and prestige will win, regardless of his allegiance.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": ["Dutch edition", "English First Edition"], "average": "7.34801", "name": "Wars of the Roses: Lancaster vs. York", "playingtime": "180", "boardgamemechanic": ["Action / Movement Programming", "Area Control / Area Influence", "Area Movement", "Card Drafting", "Partnerships", "Secret Unit Deployment", "Simultaneous Action Selection"], "age": "13", "usersrated": "1326", "boardgamesubdomain": ["Strategy Games"], "boardgamefamily": ["Country: England", "Wars of the Roses"], "boardgamepodcastepisode": ["Heavy Cardboard Episode 21 \u2013 Indonesia"]}, "58937": {"rpgartist": ["(Uncredited)"], "rpgitemversion": ["Softcover Version"], "rpgseries": ["Ultimate Series (Mongoose)"], "name": "Ultimate Character Record Sheet", "rpgdesigner": ["Richard Neale"], "rpgproducer": ["(Uncredited)"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic620435.jpg", "usersrated": "1", "average": "6", "rpgissuearticle": ["D20 Product Reviews"], "rpg": ["d20 System / OGL Product (D&D 3.5 Compatible)"], "rpgpublisher": ["Mongoose Publishing"], "poll": [], "statistics": [], "rpgcategory": ["Sourcebook (rules/options to enhance play)"], "rpggenre": ["Fantasy (High Fantasy)"], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic620435_t.jpg", "description": "From the back of the book:<br/><br/>&quot;The Ultimate Character Record Sheet is a must for Games Masters and Players wishing to lift their characters from the page and bring them to life.

Hit the town and find a Sugar Daddy (you'll never look at a cleric the same way again!) or a non-human lover, or become an expert in Esoteric Erotica.<br/><br/>This book has Everything, but EVERYTHING you need to become the raunchiest temptress in town. Everything in the Quintessential Temptress has a functional use in any fantasy-based d20 game. All you have to do now is convince your Games Master that the Avatar of Love really is a cool prestige class and that what the party needs in town is some action a bit faster than another bottle of wine at the local tavern. Just remember, this book is really VERY naughty. It does exactly what it says on the tin.&quot;<br/><br/>"}, "58961": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1077806.jpg", "poll": [], "boardgamedesigner": ["Nate French", "Eric M.
