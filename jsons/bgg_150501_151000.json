In its place is the &quot;action scene&quot; system, which covers far more than just a slugfest or a laser-filled shootout. Violence is de-emphasized and players are rewarded for making indirect attacks of a less overt nature (&quot;I shoot the tree branch, so that it falls on top of the enemy!&quot;). Characters can be given Setback Tokens, representing anything from physical damage to confusion and everything in between.<br/><br/>Series Creation: The GM and the players work together to construct the series via the series creation system, which includes character creation. Speaking of which, creating characters has never been this easy in previous versions of the game, as the bookkeeping is now very minimal indeed.<br/><br/>Sample Series: The book includes eight series seeds and one more detailed sample series.<br/><br/>26-Page Action Scene Example: This ultra-detailed example of an action scene answers any question you care to ask.<br/><br/>Preface by Flint Dille: The legendary cartoon writer offers up an insightful preface that discusses the way cartoons were created in the 1980s.<br/><br/>"}, "150562": {"rpgdesigner": ["Kevin Crawford"], "rpgitemversion": ["PDF version", "Softcover Version"], "statistics": [], "name": "Relics of the Lost", "rpgartist": ["Pawel Dobosz", "Du\u0161an Kosti\u0107", "Maciej Zagorski"], "rpgproducer": ["Kevin Crawford"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1831229.jpg", "usersrated": "2", "average": "9", "rpggenre": ["Science Fiction (Space Opera)"], "rpgpublisher": ["Sine Nomine Publishing"], "rpg": ["Stars Without Number"], "rpgcategory": ["Sourcebook (rules/options to enhance play)"], "poll": [], "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1831229_t.jpg", "description": "From publisher blurb:<br/><br/><br/>The Treasures of a Dead Age Await<br/><br/>In Relics of the Lost you will find a trove of ancient technology and precious artifacts long since lost to a lesser era.

The bunkers and minefields were backed up by some of Germany&rsquo;s best troops.

This is followed with a breakout of the beachhead and a drive across France, culminating with a deep penetration into Germany itself. As the German player, you must choose a wise defensive alignment of your forces, including hidden units, and hope that you are strong enough at the point of the actual landing to defeat the Allied invasion.

Warp reality by wishing really hard in service to the prank of the moment.

This edition doesn&rsquo;t include character creation rules; however, pregenerated PCs are provided with this download. Let folks pick their characters, or just deal them out at random.<br/>     For face to face play, everyone will also need a pencil with a good eraser to record values that change during play. For online play, the relevant sections of your character sheets are form-fillable.<br/>     You&rsquo;ll also need a handful of six-sided dice (around 5&ndash;7). For online play, the forum or chat program you&rsquo;re using may have a dice-roller utility, otherwise just let the GM handle the dice rolls.<br/>     Print and cut out a copy of the [Quickstart Costume Deck]. For online play, physical Costume cards may be useful for ease of reference. The GM should always have a copy in order to keep track of the Costumes.<br/>     Finally, you&rsquo;ll need tokens to represent Magic points (about ten per player). You can use glass beads, poker chips, or even small candies, like gourmet jelly beans. We recommend using Magic tokens &ndash; edible or otherwise &ndash; even if you&rsquo;re playing online since we find that the tactile element of handling (or eating) them adds to the experience.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>"}, "150642": {"rpgdesigner": ["Dylan Cobb", "Rebecca Mooney", "Jye Nicolson"], "rpg": ["Costume Fairy Adventures"], "poll": [], "name": "Demo Playset: The Big Pie Caper", "rpgartist": ["Esme Baran", "Miranda Harrell", "Saana Lappalainen", "Louise Leung", "Louise Kay Uy"], "rpgproducer": ["Cassandra McKown", "Scott Vandervalk"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1832698.png", "usersrated": "1", "rpgitemversion": ["PDF Version 1.0"], "average": "6", "statistics": [], "rpggenre": ["Comedy / Satire", "Fantasy", "Kid-Friendly"], "rpgpublisher": ["Penguin King Games"], "rpgcategory": ["Scenario / Adventure / Module"], "rpgseries": ["Costume Fairy Adventures Quickstart Edition"], "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1832698_t.png", "description": "From Introduction:<br/><br/>In order to play Costume Fairy Adventures Quickstart Edition, you will also need:<br/><br/>     The Core Rules Booklet.<br/>     The pregenerated PC playbooks.<br/>     The print-and-play Quickstart Costume Deck.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Become the life of the village party in The Big Pie Caper!

Consequently some players who start as Heroes may choose to play as if they were already Agents right away, others will be Heroes to the end, and some may hedge their bets and try to play both sides.<br/><br/>There are eight locations on the board that serve as potential centers of the Conspiracy.  The main goal of the Heroes is to identify which location it is, and then successfully infiltrate it enough to get the information they need to expose the Conspiracy.  The way to figure out which is the correct one is to infiltrate three other locations known as the Halls of Power.  If successful, each one will eliminate half of the possible locations and all three together will pinpoint it.  The twelfth location makes all of the other infiltrations easier.<br/><br/>On their turn, players will typically do three things.  They will move to a location, play a card on that location if they wish, and then they can either use that location's power (to do things like draw or trade cards) or they can try to infiltrate it.  The purpose for playing cards is to make a location easier (or harder) to infiltrate.  The cards range from -5 to +5 and each location starts with one random card on it.  If a player chooses to try and infiltrate a location, they shuffle the cards on top and then reveal all of them.  If the sum of the cards is equal to or greater than a certain changing difficulty number, they succeed.  Otherwise they fail and may face a penalty.<br/><br/>Successfully infiltrating one of the Halls of Power lets the person doing the infiltration discover one of the leaders of the Conspiracy which in turn narrows down the possible locations of the Conspiracy.  However only the infiltrating player gets to see the card and they may or may not tell the truth about what they saw.  Once the Heroes have an idea of which location is the center of the Conspiracy, they will try to infiltrate it.  If successful, they may take a card from their hand and place it underneath that location.<br/><br/>The game typically ends when the Protagonist feels the Heroes have played enough cards under the proper location and calls an end to the game.  At that time the cards under the Halls of Power are revealed and the true center of the Conspiracy is determined.  Then the cards under there (if any) are added up and if the total does indeed meet or beat a certain difficulty (called the Exposure Level), the Heroes win.  Otherwise the Agents win.  The Agents also win if the deck runs out of cards or if the Protagonist is killed in a failed infiltration.  The Heroes can alternately win if the Exposure Level ever drops to 0.<br/><br/>"}, "150655": {"rpgdesigner": ["Rafael Chandler"], "rpgitemversion": ["Lulu Hardcover Version", "Lulu Softcover Version", "PDF Version"], "statistics": [], "name": "Pandemonio Director Guide", "rpgartist": ["Gennifer Bone", "Ni\u00f1o Harn Cajayon", "Joseph J.

This time there was no regular army. Armed with scythes and hunting weapons, Poles joined armed groups called parties to stand up to an unequal battle with the large Russian army. You yourself could stand at the head of one of these parties.<br/><br/>1863 is an unusually dynamic card game designed for 2-4 players, in which our task is to put you in the role of an insurgent party. The party, which may include Scythemen, Shooters or elite troops of the Zouaves of Death, will engage the Muscovites in the historic battles of the January Uprising. We must take care that we have the right amount of ammunition, and make sure that none of our fellow players gain too many glory points. They decide which player wins the whole game.<br/><br/>One begins the game having five Command Cards and Ammunition Chips. Each round starts by drawing commanders and issuing a battlefield with the Muscovite&rsquo;s card hidden beneath it. In each turn, players replenish their number of chips and cards. After this, the most important part of the game begins. It consists of adding the next military units and actions to battles or to other players, in order to break with military force all the units of the battlefield, along with the Muscovite card hidden beneath it. The battles are resolved when everyone has agreed not to add more cards. If players manage to surpass the total military forces of the battlefield and Muscovite, the skirmish has been won, and the players each receive glory points according to the size of their military contribution to it. So it pays to have the largest share in each battle. The game usually lasts until 6 skirmishes have been won. The glory points are then added up, and the winner of the game emerges.<br/><br/><br/>Zima roku 1863. Zniewolona Polska, pod zaborami trzech pot\u0119g tamtego okresu - Austrii, Prus i Rosji.

Additionally, every Attack presents an opportunity for all players to Assist with the devious deed at hand, or Avoid taking damage should events go awry. The catch? Every action can be played only once. You can block any one Attack and take no damage, but that leaves you vulnerable for any other actions that occur that round.

Since the partition, four major wars and numerous smaller conflicts have been waged over much of the same ground. In 1947, 1965, 1971, and 1999 India and Pakistan fought in the mountains of Kashmir and on the plains of the Punjab region to the south.  Today, both sides are armed with thousands of armored vehicles, hundreds of advanced aircraft, and dozens of nuclear weapons.  With tensions high and both sides heavily armed, another conflict may be just a matter of time.<br/><br/>Next War: India-Pakistan, the next volume in GMT's series of Next War games and a follow-on to\u202f Next War: Korea, allows players to fight a near future war between India and Pakistan.<br/><br/>Due to the nature of a potential conflict, only a portion of the Indo-Pakistani border is featured so that the fighting centers around what it always has: the fate of the Indian state of Jammu &amp; Kashmir. Special rules govern such things as the expanded role bridges play in the region play as well as the fact that both sides in the conflict are nuclear-armed nations. The People's Republic of China and the United States can make an appearance, but they might withdraw in the event of a nuclear exchange. The question is: will this war settle once and for all who will control northwest India?<br/><br/>Note: the Next War series is not an introductory wargame. Rather, we have intended herein to create a system (and a series) that will allow detailed study of modern warfare in various venues as well as engaging gameplay. That said, the Standard Game rules encompass a fairly straightforward rule set that will, we think, be considered &quot;easy to learn&quot; by experienced wargamers. So, players who choose to play Standard Game scenarios can have a relatively quick game when that's what suits them. The real flavor of a war in the theatre, however, comes through in the Advanced Game, where you get much more control over airpower and can more clearly see each side's strengths and weaknesses. For players who want a &quot;mini-monster game&quot; experience, playing the Advanced Game Campaign Scenarios with some or all of the optional rules will definitely &quot;deliver.&quot;<br/><br/>Ownership of\u202fNext War: Korea\u202fwill NOT be required to play.<br/><br/><br/>Units<br/><br/><br/>Ground units in Next War: India-Pakistan represent the brigades, support units, and divisions of the armies of the India, Pakistan, China, and the United States. All ground units are rated for their attack and defense strengths, movement capabilities, and unit efficiency.<br/><br/>Air units represent fighter, bomber, and attack squadrons of the major combatants and are rated for All-Weather Capabilities as well as their range, average pilot skill, and their abilities in Air-to-Air Combat, Close Air Support, and Strike missions.<br/><br/><br/>Maps and Terrain<br/><br/>The game's map represents the area in and around the Punjab district of Pakistan and the Indian state of Jammu &amp; Kashmir at a scale of roughly 7.5 miles per hex. The map stretches from edge of The Great Indian Desert to just inside the Himalayas and encompasses portions of both sides of the border.<br/><br/><br/>Game System<br/><br/>A game turn is generally composed of:<br/><br/><br/>     Weather Determination. Bad weather can severely hamper air operations and can significantly slow ground operations. <br/>     Initiative Determination and Air/Naval Phase, wherein Air Superiority levels and air availability are determined. <br/>     Special Operations Phases\u202fin the Advanced Game allowing players to utilize their special operators in various recon and raid missions behind enemy lines. <br/>     Strike Phases\u202fin the Advanced Game allowing players to launch air strikes, cruise missiles, artillery and tactical nuclear weapon strikes. <br/>     One or more\u202fMovement and Combat Phases\u202fthat allow both sides to move, react, and fight, with an advantage to the Initiative player on non-Contested turns <br/>     Arrival of Reinforcements and Replacements <br/>     Victory Determination <br/><br/><br/><br/>Combat<br/><br/>Combat\u202fresolution examines not only unit strengths but also unit efficiency (representing training, doctrine, and morale), as well as the terrain where the combat takes place. The CRT tends to be very bloody in nature, reflecting what we believe will be a degree of attritional warfare early due to the lethality of modern weapons. As in many games, casualties represent not only actual combat losses but also losses of unit cohesion brought about by the rapid pace with which modern armies are able to engage and exploit on the battlefield.<br/><br/><br/>Nukes<br/><br/>In this installment, players will have the option, depending on game situation and a die roll to secure release authorization for and use tactical nuclear weapons in the playing area. Use of such weapons, however, could cause your international allies to leave the theater, so be careful!<br/><br/><br/>Scenarios<br/><br/>There are several Standard Game scenarios. Some are small and focus on limited objectives while others are variations of a campaign game encompassing the entire map.<br/><br/>In a break from the standard set in Next War: Korea(and its follow-on Next War: Taiwan), the scenarios in Next War: India-Pakistan posit specific at-start situations and objectives (or victory conditions).  In some scenarios Pakistan is the aggressor while in others the Indian side is on the attack, in all cases there are varying levels of Chinese and United States intervention.<br/><br/>The International Posture Matrix\u202f&agrave; la\u202fFlashpoint: Golan\u202fis still present to allow players to experiment with a variety of intervention options for the US and PRC.<br/><br/>In \u202fNext War: India-Pakistan, Jammu &amp; Kashmir is once again aflame. Can you, as the Islamic Republic of Pakistan's commander, conquer Kashmir and hold it against the enemy? Can you, as the Republic of India's commander, attack and defeat the enemy without the conflict going nuclear? And what will happen in the international community while all this is going on?

If your robot becomes immobile, you lose and the match is over!<br/><br/>The combat arena is a hex style attack grid.<br/><br/>As you move your robot around the arena you will try to make contact with your opponent which will cause either LIGHT, MEDIUM, OR HEAVY damage.  The damage to your opponent&rsquo;s robot will depend on the level of your weapon or the level of the robot!  Also, when you make contact you can cause different issues with the robots such as; power failure, loss of control, loss of maneuverability, electronic failure, motor failure, battery failure, etc...   These different issues will cause robot part to breakdown.  When a breakdown occurs, you can repair the part or replace it with another part.  Each part has a life span and can only be repaired once, the second time the part breaks down it&rsquo;s destroyed!<br/><br/>Robot Combat is a turn-based system with rounds and phases. In between matches you will be able to sell or buy new or used parts for your robot to help fix or repair the broken parts before the next match; if you can't fix your robot before the next match, you will have to sit out of the competition until your robot is fully functional.<br/><br/>Winning each match earns you a trophy and money or parts, if you can upgrade your robot to the highest level and win the most matches; you will earn glory and prestige to become the Robot Combat Champion!<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": ["First edition"], "age": "12", "name": "Robot Combat", "playingtime": "60", "boardgamemechanic": ["Action / Movement Programming", "Grid Movement", "Hand Management", "Hex-and-Counter"], "average": "0", "usersrated": "0", "boardgamefamily": ["Robots"]}, "150768": {"rpgdesigner": ["Alex Schr\u00f6der"], "rpg": ["Labyrinth Lord"], "statistics": [], "name": "Hellebarden & Helme", "rpgartist": ["Alex Schr\u00f6der"], "rpgproducer": ["Claudia Frei", "Alex Schr\u00f6der"], "average": "0", "usersrated": "0", "rpgitemversion": ["PDF Version"], "rpggenre": ["Fantasy"], "rpgpublisher": ["(Self-Published)"], "rpgcategory": ["Alternate Rules (Variant Core Rules)"], "poll": [], "description": "User Summary:<br/><br/>The German translation of Halberds &amp; Helmets is a set of variant Basic D&amp;D rules covering levels 1 to 5, based on Open Gaming Content from Labyrinth Lord.<br/><br/>"}, "150769": {"rpgartist": ["David Daniel"], "rpgitemversion": ["PDF Version"], "statistics": [], "name": "Fast Courier", "rpgdesigner": ["Michael Taylor (I)"], "rpgproducer": ["Martin Dougherty"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1860562.jpg", "usersrated": "0", "rpgsetting": ["The Third Imperium"], "average": "0", "rpggenre": ["Science Fiction", "Science Fiction (Space Opera)"], "rpgpublisher": ["Mongoose Publishing"], "rpg": ["Traveller (Mongoose)"], "rpgcategory": ["Sourcebook (rules/options to enhance play)"], "poll": [], "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1860562_t.jpg", "description": "User Summary:<br/><br/>Adventure seeds for this particular type of ship for Mongoose Traveller.<br/><br/>"}, "150770": {"rpgartist": ["(Uncredited)"], "rpgitemversion": ["PDF Version"], "statistics": [], "name": "Guide to Classic Traveller", "rpgdesigner": ["Marc W.

Millennia ago, during a period of reduced magical activity, there was a nuclear power station at this location. When magical influences began to spread once more, the nuclear core became unstable, and began to develop a form of malevolent sentience. The ancients placed the core in a shaft three miles deep, the last 500 feet of which were filled with heavy water. This shaft, and its attendant control center, were given the codename &ldquo;Silent Nightfall&rdquo;.<br/><br/>In the ages since, much of the complex has collapsed or ceased to function, but the main shaft still remains, going three miles deep into the ground. The rooms that remain have undergone great changes, having been used for many different purposes and by many different creatures over the centuries. As a result, the original purpose of the shaft, rooms, and corridors has become obscured.<br/><br/>One of those who used the area was the wizard Mortmallion the Pale, who stole the Whispering Stone from Elfland. He hid himself and the stone in the Silent Nightfall complex, but the weird energies coming up from below changed him. Mortmallion can still be found, deep below, as the shaft crawler. Over time, the Whispering Stone became confused with the area where it is now found, and some texts refer to it as &ldquo;Silent Nightfall&rdquo; without making it clear why the stone has this name.<br/><br/>Currently, they are used as the nesting ground of owl-like humanoids that call themselves the grallistrix. Incubating their eggs in the Silent Nightfall complex has changed them, and they have become dangerous nocturnal predators in the region. The grallistrix hunt in triads, and locate prey by an extraordinary sense of hearing. As a result, communities nearby observe unexpected quiet at night &ndash; there are no late night gatherings. Inns and taverns close their doors with the fall of night.<br/><br/>Finally, the nuclear core itself has gained sentience and a malevolent, demonic intelligence. Imprisoned at the bottom of the shaft, it knows no other name than Silent Nightfall. So long as the demon remains bound, it is no great threat to the PCs or their world. In fact, they may be able to deal with it in order to gain magical aid.<br/><br/>In this way, the term &ldquo;Silent Nightfall&rdquo; has come to mean the following within the context of this location &ndash; the remains of the nuclear complex, the practice of avoiding loud noises after dark, the Whispering Stone, and the great demon imprisoned at the bottom of the shaft. This gives the judge many ways to lead the PCs into this material. It also allows the judge to make finding information difficult, as the many uses of &ldquo;Silent Nightfall&rdquo; spill into each other.<br/><br/>A challenging Dungeon Crawl Classics Adventure for 2nd level (or above).<br/><br/>"}, "150783": {"image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2056454.jpg", "poll": [], "boardgamedesigner": ["Dennis Hoyle"], "statistics": [], "yearpublished": "2013", "maxplayers": "7", "boardgameartist": ["Jonathan Logan Clark", "Dennis Hoyle"], "boardgamepublisher": ["(Web published)", "Bellwether Games"], "maxplaytime": "30", "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2056454_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "20", "boardgamecategory": ["Card Game", "Deduction", "Medical", "Print & Play"], "description": "In Antidote, you are a laboratory scientist working for a giant chemical research conglomerate. When a deadly toxin suddenly infects you and everyone in your lab, you must work quickly to share your research and discover the Antidote before it's too late.<br/><br/>In the game, players take turns deciding what action all other players take: either discard from their hand or trade research with other players. Eventually all your cards will run-out and you will be left with just one that you must &quot;drink&quot; and hope it's the Antidote. If this card is the true Antidote, you're cured and live to play again!

Whether it is making trades for valuable information or simultaneously declassifying your research, all players are constantly engaged. This makes the game experience more fulfilling and eliminates long-periods of &quot;down-time&quot; between turns.<br/>     Player-controlled game length: Players have sole control over the pace of the game.

The root cause of nearly all deaths is easily avoidable.

First is the arctic froghemoth (CR 8), the product of a frozen world, its tentacles end in barbed harpoons, and its icy breath slows those affected by it. Next is the volcanic froghemoth (CR 16), which prefers a warmer clime, and can spit globules of burning pitch that remain on the battlefield and serve as a dangerous obstacle, and which possesses a dangerous fire aura that helps protect it from its crippling weakness to cold. Finally, the deep froghemoth (CR 19) may well be the last remnant of an ancient space-faring race of proto-froghemoths who populated the stars.

The minotaurs in this tome are designed to take minotaurs from being an uninspiring low-level bruiser to a memorable encounter unto themselves. First, the two-headed minotaur (CR 7) is a feral and wild beast with a fractured mind, whose savage offensive power is only somewhat mitigated by its mental fragility. The bronze minotaur (CR 10) sounds like a construct (and looks like one too) but isn&rsquo;t. This terrible guardian of tombs and other such places is an expert at crafting traps, and the sound of its approaching footsteps is so terrible that it drives fear into the heart of seasoned adventurers. Finally, the maze master minotaur (CR 15) is a minotaur of a more magical bent, who can drag foes into a mystical maze of its own creation, where they face deadly threats and, if slain, grant the maze master minotaur the ability to create a simulacrum of the victim to serve him.<br/><br/>"}, "150844": {"rpgdesigner": ["Matthew J.

All these games as well as some unrelated and more recent games are denoted by the word &quot;karuta&quot; from Portuguese &quot;carta&quot;. Due to the age of this loanword, it can be written in a bewildering number of ways. About equally frequent are \u304b\u308b\u305f in hiragana as other old loans that have been naturalised and \u30ab\u30eb\u30bf in katakana, like modern loanwords. Archaic and more rarely seen are &quot;sound-ateji forms&quot; like \u6b4c\u7559\u591a, \u52a0\u7559\u591a or \u5609\u7559\u592a using kanji for their sound value without reference to their meanings. The kanji \u9aa8\u724c might be read karuta, but primarily represents koppai \u3053\u3063\u3071\u3044, meaning a particular type of cards, or &quot;bone mahjong tiles&quot; (from Chinese g\u01d4 p&aacute;i meaning &quot;bone tile&quot;, referring to dominoes). Besides this, the term fuda \u3075\u3060 might be used for at least some forms of playing cards. This may also be written with the kanji \u672d with the primary meaning &quot;paper money&quot;, and in this sense read satsu \u3055\u3064.<br/><br/>The term &quot;Tensh\u014d karuta&quot; is a later term later applied to distinguish the oldest form (which in origin actually predates the Tensh\u014d period) from later developments.<br/><br/>The 48-card deck is divided into the four suits of pau \u3071\u3046 &ndash; from paus &quot;clubs&quot;, isu \u3044\u3059 &ndash; from espadas &quot;swords&quot; (shortened), koppu \u3053\u3063\u3077 &ndash; from copas &quot;cups&quot; and \u014dru \u304a\u3046\u308b &ndash; from ouros &quot;coins&quot; (literally the plural of &quot;gold&quot;). Each suit consists of 12 cards: rei \u308c\u3044 &ndash; from rei &quot;king&quot;, kaba \u304b\u3070 &ndash; from cavaleiro &quot;knight&quot; or cavalo &quot;horse&quot; (shortened), s\u014dta \u305d\u3046\u305f &ndash; from sota &quot;servant&quot; literally &quot;lower [rank]&quot; and number cards from ace to nine. As in the Portuguese precursor, the ace cards depicts a dragon holding the suit symbol. In the &quot;short&quot; suits of cups and coins the number cards rank in reverse from ace (high) to nine (low), while the &quot;long&quot; suits of clubs and swords are ranked normally. This feature is not only shared with older European cards, but at least for coins goes all the way back to the earliest Chinese playing cards.<br/><br/>Later some of the Portuguese-derived names are replaced by indigenous ones. Pau becomes hau \u306f\u3046, &quot;flower&quot;, and the clubs are shown sprouting flowers; while kaba becomes uma \u3046\u307e &quot;horse&quot;.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "0", "boardgameversion": ["Miike Museum card and Kobe City Museum woodblocks"], "age": "0", "name": "Tensh\u014d karuta", "playingtime": "0", "average": "5", "usersrated": "1", "boardgamefamily": ["Country: Japan", "Traditional Card Games"]}, "150915": {"image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2774395.jpg", "poll": [], "boardgamedesigner": ["Samuel Bailey", "Richard Launius"], "statistics": [], "yearpublished": "2013", "maxplayers": "5", "boardgameartist": ["Jason Juta"], "boardgamepublisher": ["Edge Entertainment", "Fantasy Flight Games", "Galakta", "Heidelberger Spieleverlag"], "maxplaytime": "120", "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2774395_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "120", "boardgamecategory": ["Expansion for Base-game", "Exploration", "Horror"], "description": "From Fantasy Flight Games:<br/><br/>It has been two months now since your good friend Dr. Crawford Tillinghast berated you angrily, called you a fool, and ejected you from his home and laboratory in a fit of fanatical rage.

Players control powerful heroes from the very beginning, with no leveling system, so you always have all your options available to you.<br/><br/>The mechanics are tight and to the point, allowing a player character or monster to easily fit on a sticky note. Once you get playing you&rsquo;ll have the core system mastered in short order, allowing players to create new character in minutes and GMs to draft new challenges on the fly.<br/><br/>The core of Pulp!'s fast game-play is a single six sided die (better known as a d6). When you want to do something that is more than mundane you roll a d6, then add an Ability Modifier and one Trait or Asset. Compare that number to a Difficulty set by the Game Master or an opposed roll.<br/><br/>To help create big action on the fly, the d6 also helps produce special circumstances related to your action. Roll a 6 on the die and Achieve Outstanding Success, performing so well you gain an additional benefit greater than what you hoped to achieve. Roll a 1 on the die and you&rsquo;ve cause a Complication. These add new elements to the scene that make things more difficult, but usually only fr a short time.<br/><br/>That means on every 1 out of 3 rolls, something interesting is sure to happen.

Like its award-winning predecessors Lords of War: Orcs versus Dwarves and Lords of War: Elves versus Lizardmen, the game sees fantasy races engage in dynamic tactical card battles, with the armies in this set having more heavy defense and the series&rsquo; first moving units.<br/><br/>During Lords of War battles, players use hands of six cards (called units) drawn from their army deck of 36 cards. A player turn starts with one card placed onto a gridded board. With the exception of ranged and spear units, cards must be placed adjacent to an enemy unit. An elimination phase follows in which you check for the elimination of opposing cards and the one you just placed. Cards have unique formations of attack arrows on their edges and corners signifying which adjacent cards they attack once played and the damage they will do. Each card also has a defense value which when exceeded by opposing cards sees that card defeated. Once combat has been resolved, the player can then either draw a new card from his army deck or retrieve a unit from the board that has not engaged in combat during that turn.<br/><br/>Play continues until one player has eliminated twenty units or four commanders.<br/><br/>The game is playable out of the box and contains two complete armies: the Templars and the Undead. These factions are differentiated by their unique cards and strategies; the Templar faction is based around a heavily armoured infantry and mobile palisades. The Undead army contains a stark range of defensive and offensive units, including zombies which roam across the battlefield.<br/><br/>Templars versus Undead is compatible with both Elves versus Lizardmen and Orcs versus Dwarves, meaning that all the Lords of War armies can be used to battle one another. The armies can also be blended together, using a strict ranking system, to create mercenary decks for tournament play.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": ["English first edition", "German First edition", "Polish first edition"], "maxplaytime": "30", "average": "7.00241", "name": "Lords of War: Templars versus Undead", "playingtime": "30", "boardgamemechanic": ["Campaign / Battle Card Driven"], "age": "12", "boardgameexpansion": ["Lords of War: Elves versus Lizardmen 2 \u2013 The Magic and Monsters Expansion", "Lords of War: Orcs versus Dwarves 2 \u2013 The Magic and Monsters Expansion", "Lords of War: Templars versus Undead \u2013 Return Fire booster pack", "Lords of War: Templars versus Undead \u2013 Reversal of Fortunes Booster Pack", "Lords of War: Weather and Terrain Expansion Pack"], "usersrated": "135", "boardgamefamily": ["Crowdfunding: Kickstarter", "Lords of War"], "boardgamepodcastepisode": ["Episode 19 - Christmas films &amp; Lords of War", "Episode 38 - There Came a Dragon Lord", "The Boardgame Interview Room: Lords of War with Martin Vaux", "The Boardgame Review Room: Lords of War"]}, "150997": {"image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2037826.jpg", "poll": [], "boardgamedesigner": ["Jason C.

Forming an adventuring posse, the Heroes venture down into the dark mines, overrun with all manner of ancient demons and foul creatures from another world.

As players find fantastic gear and artifacts to equip their heroes, they also gain experience from their adventures. This experience is used to level up, guiding the hero's path through an expansive, class-specific upgrade tree of new skills and abilities, allowing each player to develop their hero to fit their own play style.<br/><br/>In Swamps of Death, players will encounter portals to the otherworld Jargono, a humid swampland inhabited by sentient reptiles, vicious dinosaurs and a tribe of humanoids, cut off

Whoever collects the most valuable artifacts in her tomb wins.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": ["English first edition", "German first edition", "Spanish First Edition"], "maxplaytime": "45", "average": "7.16966", "name": "Valley of the Kings", "playingtime": "45", "boardgamemechanic": ["Deck / Pool Building", "Hand Management", "Set Collection"], "age": "14", "usersrated": "2527", "boardgamesubdomain": ["Strategy Games"], "boardgamefamily": ["AEG: Pocket Game", "Country: Egypt"], "boardgamepodcastepisode": ["Alderac Entertainment Group", "Big Fun in a Little Box with Shawn: Pixel Tactics &amp; Valley of the Kings", "Episode 12 - Dealing With Acquisition Disorder on a Budget", "Episode 30 - When All You Need is a Deck of Cards", "Episode 32 -- Gum-sized Games and Ancient Tombs", "Episode 48 The Geeks Get Lost In The Valley Of The Kings", "Episode 76-- Spiel des Jahres chat and What we have been playing With guests Joel Eddy and Paul Owen", "Episode 77 Origins preview, Buonocore drops by, and Xmen chat (spoilers)", "HLG 2: Hamburgers en Pizza", "MN 0149 Small Deck Builders: Valley of the Kings, Dale of Merchants, Xenon Profiteer", "MOBG 24 Best of 2014 (21-01-15)", "MOBG Podcast 37: 500 Games of Summer.", "Podcast #18: The Turbocast", "Strange Assembly 138 - Remember Me", "Strange Assembly 159 - Double Back", "Strange Assembly 184 - In With The Old, In With The New", "Strange Assembly 202 - Underrated Games", "The Game Pit: Episode 28 - Picking Over the bones"]}}
