This year, you are those heroes.<br/><br/>The purpose of this adventure is to journey to the Tower of Forbidden Gods and offer appropriate sacrifice to each god, for which the party will receive divine magics appropriate to their class.<br/><br/>"}, "150521": {"rpg": {"356": "Generic / Universal"}, "poll": {}, "name": "The Sunken Temple", "rpgproducer": {"68905": "Simon Forster"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3445660.jpg", "usersrated": "0", "rpgitemversion": {"224791": "PDF Version"}, "average": "0", "statistics": {}, "rpggenre": {"961": "Fantasy"}, "rpgcategory": {"2084": "Scenario / Adventure / Module"}, "rpgseries": {"40386": "One Page Dungeon Contest 2012"}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3445660_t.jpg", "description": "PDF Description:<br/><br/>Originally a temple dedicated to a forgotten god, the temple partially sunk into the marshy ground, so that only the entrance and roof remains above the ground.

Remember how these wondrously cheesy shows drw us in and spoke to us on a personal level, all the while trying to sell us action figures?<br/><br/><br/>We remember it too!<br/><br/>Cartoon Action Hour: Season 3 is the third edition of the game that was nominated for  &quot;Best RPG&quot; at the 2004 Origins Awards. The game faithfully and meticulously emulates the action-adventure cartoons of the 1980s, using &quot;cartoon logic&quot; as the basis for every aspect of the system. This is not just a universal game that just happens to be adorned with genre-appropriate art. Every single design decision was made with the purpose of bringing to life the retro-toons of yesteryear, right at your gaming table.<br/><br/>Everything you need to play Cartoon Action Hour is included in this full-color rulebook. Some of the features include:<br/><br/>Sleek and Exciting Game System: You roll a d12 and add one or two ratings to it. That's the core of the system, making it extremely easy to jump right into the animated fray. Every nuance of the system (transformation, vehicles, playsets, etc.) utilize the same game mechanics as a whole.<br/><br/>Action Scenes: In Cartoon Action Hour, there is no &quot;combat system&quot;. In its place is the &quot;action scene&quot; system, which covers far more than just a slugfest or a laser-filled shootout. Violence is de-emphasized and players are rewarded for making indirect attacks of a less overt nature (&quot;I shoot the tree branch, so that it falls on top of the enemy!&quot;). Characters can be given Setback Tokens, representing anything from physical damage to confusion and everything in between.<br/><br/>Series Creation: The GM and the players work together to construct the series via the series creation system, which includes character creation. Speaking of which, creating characters has never been this easy in previous versions of the game, as the bookkeeping is now very minimal indeed.<br/><br/>Sample Series: The book includes eight series seeds and one more detailed sample series.<br/><br/>26-Page Action Scene Example: This ultra-detailed example of an action scene answers any question you care to ask.<br/><br/>Preface by Flint Dille: The legendary cartoon writer offers up an insightful preface that discusses the way cartoons were created in the 1980s.<br/><br/>"}, "150562": {"rpgitemversion": {"224863": "PDF version"}, "statistics": {}, "name": "Relics of the Lost", "rpgproducer": {"43181": "Kevin Crawford"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1831229.jpg", "usersrated": "2", "average": "9", "rpggenre": {"162": "Science Fiction (Space Opera)"}, "rpg": {"8524": "Stars Without Number"}, "rpgcategory": {"2108": "Sourcebook (rules/options to enhance play)"}, "poll": {}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1831229_t.jpg", "description": "From publisher blurb:<br/><br/><br/>The Treasures of a Dead Age Await<br/><br/>In Relics of the Lost you will find a trove of ancient technology and precious artifacts long since lost to a lesser era.

The bunkers and minefields were backed up by some of Germany&rsquo;s best troops. Allied forces had been gathering in England and the Mediterranean for more than two years, preparing to assault Hitler&rsquo;s Fortress Europe.<br/><br/>On D-Day, 6 June 1944, they attacked on what Rommel called &ldquo;the longest day.&rdquo; Success of the invasion was far from guaranteed, but the Allied victory on the beaches signaled the beginning of the end for the Germans in Western Europe.<br/><br/>Paul Koenig's Fortress Europe recreates the war in Western Europe from the D-day invasion to VE-Day, what General Eisenhower dubbed &ldquo;the mighty endeavor.&rdquo; As the Allied player, you must choose a landing site and then get ashore with a successful landing. This is followed with a breakout of the beachhead and a drive across France, culminating with a deep penetration into Germany itself. As the German player, you must choose a wise defensive alignment of your forces, including hidden units, and hope that you are strong enough at the point of the actual landing to defeat the Allied invasion. If you fail at the water's edge, you must conduct an orderly withdrawal across France, constantly delaying the Allies, until you are strong enough to launch a winter counter-attack (historically, the Battle of the Bulge).<br/><br/>What's In The Box?:<br/><br/>&bull;  One 40-page Rulebook<br/>&bull;  One 26&quot; x 38&quot; paper game map<br/>&bull;  Three sheets of double-sided, laser-cut game pieces<br/>&bull;  Four Player Aid cards<br/>&bull;  One six-sided 12mm die<br/>&bull;  One white, 9&quot; x 11 7/8&quot; Deluxe cardboard VPG game box<br/>&bull;  One beautiful box cover sleeve<br/>&bull;  One &quot;Wipes-A-Lot&quot; napkin<br/>&bull;  One charcoal dessicant packet<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "1", "boardgameversion": {"225045": "Paul Koenig's Fortress Europe"}, "average": "6.1", "name": "Paul Koenig's Fortress Europe", "playingtime": "300", "boardgamemechanic": {"2072": "Dice Rolling"}, "age": "13", "usersrated": "15", "boardgamefamily": {"5666": "Solitaire Games"}}, "150629": {"rpgitemversion": {"225046": "PocketMod PDF Version"}, "poll": {}, "name": "Alpha Unix", "rpgproducer": {"3": "(Uncredited)"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1835428.png", "usersrated": "0", "average": "0", "rpggenre": {"164": "Science Fiction (Cyberpunk)"}, "statistics": {}, "rpg": {"23905": "Alpha Unix"}, "rpgcategory": {"2083": "Core Rules (min needed to play)"}, "rpgseries": {"23865": "Harder than Granite 24-hour RPG"}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1835428_t.png", "description": "From the text:<br/><br/>WELCOME TO THE MACHINE<br/><br/>It is the future, but how long it has been since humanity fell no one knows.

Warp reality by wishing really hard in service to the prank of the moment.

This edition doesn&rsquo;t include character creation rules; however, pregenerated PCs are provided with this download. Let folks pick their characters, or just deal them out at random.<br/>     For face to face play, everyone will also need a pencil with a good eraser to record values that change during play. For online play, the relevant sections of your character sheets are form-fillable.<br/>     You&rsquo;ll also need a handful of six-sided dice (around 5&ndash;7). For online play, the forum or chat program you&rsquo;re using may have a dice-roller utility, otherwise just let the GM handle the dice rolls.<br/>     Print and cut out a copy of the [Quickstart Costume Deck]. For online play, physical Costume cards may be useful for ease of reference. The GM should always have a copy in order to keep track of the Costumes.<br/>     Finally, you&rsquo;ll need tokens to represent Magic points (about ten per player). You can use glass beads, poker chips, or even small candies, like gourmet jelly beans.

One player (by random draw) is assigned as the Protagonist and is the leader of a group of Heroes trying to expose the Conspiracy.  Another player will secretly start the game as an Agent, posing as a Hero.  Agents win when the Heroes lose.  All other players begin with a Resolve score between 1 and 9.  They start out on the Hero's side, but if and when one of the nine &quot;Conspiracy Expands&quot; cards is revealed in the game, they will switch to an undercover Agent if their Resolve is equal to or lower than the number of Conspiracy Expands cards revealed thus far.  Consequently some players who start as Heroes may choose to play as if they were already Agents right away, others will be Heroes to the end, and some may hedge their bets and try to play both sides.<br/><br/>There are eight locations on the board that serve as potential centers of the Conspiracy.  The main goal of the Heroes is to identify which location it is, and then successfully infiltrate it enough to get the information they need to expose the Conspiracy.  The way to figure out which is the correct one is to infiltrate three other locations known as the Halls of Power.  If successful, each one will eliminate half of the possible locations and all three together will pinpoint it.  The twelfth location makes all of the other infiltrations easier.<br/><br/>On their turn, players will typically do three things.  They will move to a location, play a card on that location if they wish, and then they can either use that location's power (to do things like draw or trade cards) or they can try to infiltrate it.  The purpose for playing cards is to make a location easier (or harder) to infiltrate.  The cards range from -5 to +5 and each location starts with one random card on it.  If a player chooses to try and infiltrate a location, they shuffle the cards on top and then reveal all of them.  If the sum of the cards is equal to or greater than a certain changing difficulty number, they succeed.  Otherwise they fail and may face a penalty.<br/><br/>Successfully infiltrating one of the Halls of Power lets the person doing the infiltration discover one of the leaders of the Conspiracy which in turn narrows down the possible locations of the Conspiracy.  However only the infiltrating player gets to see the card and they may or may not tell the truth about what they saw.  Once the Heroes have an idea of which location is the center of the Conspiracy, they will try to infiltrate it.  If successful, they may take a card from their hand and place it underneath that location.<br/><br/>The game typically ends when the Protagonist feels the Heroes have played enough cards under the proper location and calls an end to the game.  At that time the cards under the Halls of Power are revealed and the true center of the Conspiracy is determined.  Then the cards under there (if any) are added up and if the total does indeed meet or beat a certain difficulty (called the Exposure Level), the Heroes win.  Otherwise the Agents win.  The Agents also win if the deck runs out of cards or if the Protagonist is killed in a failed infiltration.  The Heroes can alternately win if the Exposure Level ever drops to 0.<br/><br/>"}, "150655": {"rpgitemversion": {"225434": "Lulu Hardcover Version"}, "statistics": {}, "name": "Pandemonio Director Guide", "rpgproducer": {"14467": "Clint Krause"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1834195.png", "usersrated": "3", "average": "8", "rpggenre": {"441": "Horror (Supernatural)"}, "rpg": {"23909": "Pandemonio"}, "rpgcategory": {"2083": "Core Rules (min needed to play)"}, "poll": {}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1834195_t.png", "description": "publisher blurb<br/><br/>THE LAST WAR HAS BEGUN<br/><br/>Demons feed on innocent souls while angels obliterate cities.

The Dispatcher, for example, can spend dice to fly others around the board, while the Medic is particularly adept at treating disease. Players can roll their dice as often as they like, but the more times they re-roll for the perfect turn, the more likely the next epidemic will occur.<br/><br/>At the end of each turn, new &quot;infection dice&quot; are rolled to determine the type and location of newly infected populations. If any region on the board is infected with more than three dice of a given color, an outbreak occurs, spreading disease into an adjacent region. If too many outbreaks take place, too many people get infected, or the rate of infection gets too high, all the players lose.

The winter of 1863. Poland was captive, partitioned by three powers of that era &ndash; Austria, Prussia and Russia. Under the occupation of this last country, the embers of yet another revolt appeared and tore these lands for the next two years. Once again, the rebellious hearts of Poles were itching for a fight. This time there was no regular army. Armed with scythes and hunting weapons, Poles joined armed groups called parties to stand up to an unequal battle with the large Russian army. You yourself could stand at the head of one of these parties.<br/><br/>1863 is an unusually dynamic card game designed for 2-4 players, in which our task is to put you in the role of an insurgent party. The party, which may include Scythemen, Shooters or elite troops of the Zouaves of Death, will engage the Muscovites in the historic battles of the January Uprising. We must take care that we have the right amount of ammunition, and make sure that none of our fellow players gain too many glory points. They decide which player wins the whole game.<br/><br/>One begins the game having five Command Cards and Ammunition Chips. Each round starts by drawing commanders and issuing a battlefield with the Muscovite&rsquo;s card hidden beneath it. In each turn, players replenish their number of chips and cards. After this, the most important part of the game begins. It consists of adding the next military units and actions to battles or to other players, in order to break with military force all the units of the battlefield, along with the Muscovite card hidden beneath it. The battles are resolved when everyone has agreed not to add more cards. If players manage to surpass the total military forces of the battlefield and Muscovite, the skirmish has been won, and the players each receive glory points according to the size of their military contribution to it. So it pays to have the largest share in each battle. The game usually lasts until 6 skirmishes have been won. The glory points are then added up, and the winner of the game emerges.<br/><br/><br/>Zima roku 1863. Zniewolona Polska, pod zaborami trzech pot\u0119g tamtego okresu - Austrii, Prus i Rosji.

The rules system hearkens back to the early days of role playing, when the game was about exploring, quests, mysteries, treasures, and heroic deeds, not about facilitating character concepts. &lsquo;Portal to Adventure&rsquo; is a minimal-rule system that provides the Games Master a framework and tool kit with which to build their campaign.  &lsquo;Portal&rsquo; is intentionally constructed with limited details, much like the classic games.<br/><br/>The rule set includes four Races and seven Character Classes, including several warrior-classes, spellcasting Mages, and Priests.  Character classes can come from any race, and the choice of race has both benefits and drawbacks.

Depending on how spread out you'd like the setting to be, the scale could range from half a mile per small hex to three miles per small hex.<br/><br/>Each of the 14 hexes in this map has a short description that accompanies it. These descriptions are devoid of place names, as this helps when placing the map into a larger pre-existing setting.

Additionally, every Attack presents an opportunity for all players to Assist with the devious deed at hand, or Avoid taking damage should events go awry. The catch? Every action can be played only once. You can block any one Attack and take no damage, but that leaves you vulnerable for any other actions that occur that round.

Since the partition, four major wars and numerous smaller conflicts have been waged over much of the same ground. In 1947, 1965, 1971, and 1999 India and Pakistan fought in the mountains of Kashmir and on the plains of the Punjab region to the south.  Today, both sides are armed with thousands of armored vehicles, hundreds of advanced aircraft, and dozens of nuclear weapons.  With tensions high and both sides heavily armed, another conflict may be just a matter of time.<br/><br/>Next War: India-Pakistan, the next volume in GMT's series of Next War games and a follow-on to\u202f Next War: Korea, allows players to fight a near future war between India and Pakistan.<br/><br/>Due to the nature of a potential conflict, only a portion of the Indo-Pakistani border is featured so that the fighting centers around what it always has: the fate of the Indian state of Jammu &amp; Kashmir. Special rules govern such things as the expanded role bridges play in the region play as well as the fact that both sides in the conflict are nuclear-armed nations. The People's Republic of China and the United States can make an appearance, but they might withdraw in the event of a nuclear exchange. The question is: will this war settle once and for all who will control northwest India?<br/><br/>Note: the Next War series is not an introductory wargame. Rather, we have intended herein to create a system (and a series) that will allow detailed study of modern warfare in various venues as well as engaging gameplay. That said, the Standard Game rules encompass a fairly straightforward rule set that will, we think, be considered &quot;easy to learn&quot; by experienced wargamers. So, players who choose to play Standard Game scenarios can have a relatively quick game when that's what suits them. The real flavor of a war in the theatre, however, comes through in the Advanced Game, where you get much more control over airpower and can more clearly see each side's strengths and weaknesses. For players who want a &quot;mini-monster game&quot; experience, playing the Advanced Game Campaign Scenarios with some or all of the optional rules will definitely &quot;deliver.&quot;<br/><br/>Ownership of\u202fNext War: Korea\u202fwill NOT be required to play.<br/><br/><br/>Units<br/><br/><br/>Ground units in Next War: India-Pakistan represent the brigades, support units, and divisions of the armies of the India, Pakistan, China, and the United States. All ground units are rated for their attack and defense strengths, movement capabilities, and unit efficiency.<br/><br/>Air units represent fighter, bomber, and attack squadrons of the major combatants and are rated for All-Weather Capabilities as well as their range, average pilot skill, and their abilities in Air-to-Air Combat, Close Air Support, and Strike missions.<br/><br/><br/>Maps and Terrain<br/><br/>The game's map represents the area in and around the Punjab district of Pakistan and the Indian state of Jammu &amp; Kashmir at a scale of roughly 7.5 miles per hex. The map stretches from edge of The Great Indian Desert to just inside the Himalayas and encompasses portions of both sides of the border.<br/><br/><br/>Game System<br/><br/>A game turn is generally composed of:<br/><br/><br/>     Weather Determination.

You start with a basic level 1 combat robot and your goal is to improve upon your robot design by upgrading to the strongest level 3 robot and winning the championship. You can do this by winning auctions for new or used robot parts or winning a robot combat match! <br/>You are given a chassis type, an initial drive train, armor, a weapon systems, a motor system, and 12 voltage batteries for each system; everything! During phases of the game you can either bid on new types of Robot Parts for a better deal OR bid on used parts directly from players.<br/><br/>You begin with a small amount of funds to help you upgrade your robot. When you are ready and your robot is fully functional, you can place your robot on the competition circuit and fight against other robots for prizes or money! In the end there can only be one combat champion robot!<br/><br/>During combat you will use movement cards to control your robot's drive system within the combat arena to help maneuver your robot into the best fighting position with your weapon. Watch out though, as you move or get knocked around the arena, the combat arena has offensive and defensive weapon systems of its own such as; spikes, ramps, saws, lifters, hammers, etc... these systems try to destroy or inhibit your robot! If your robot becomes immobile, you lose and the match is over!<br/><br/>The combat arena is a hex style attack grid.<br/><br/>As you move your robot around the arena you will try to make contact with your opponent which will cause either LIGHT, MEDIUM, OR HEAVY damage.  The damage to your opponent&rsquo;s robot will depend on the level of your weapon or the level of the robot!  Also, when you make contact you can cause different issues with the robots such as; power failure, loss of control, loss of maneuverability, electronic failure, motor failure, battery failure, etc...   These different issues will cause robot part to breakdown.  When a breakdown occurs, you can repair the part or replace it with another part.  Each part has a life span and can only be repaired once, the second time the part breaks down it&rsquo;s destroyed!<br/><br/>Robot Combat is a turn-based system with rounds and phases. In between matches you will be able to sell or buy new or used parts for your robot to help fix or repair the broken parts before the next match; if you can't fix your robot before the next match, you will have to sit out of the competition until your robot is fully functional.<br/><br/>Winning each match earns you a trophy and money or parts, if you can upgrade your robot to the highest level and win the most matches; you will earn glory and prestige to become the Robot Combat Champion!<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": {"225353": "First edition"}, "age": "12", "name": "Robot Combat", "playingtime": "60", "boardgamemechanic": {"2689": "Action / Movement Programming"}, "average": "0", "usersrated": "0", "boardgamefamily": {"22232": "Robots"}}, "150768": {"rpgitemversion": {"352077": "Halberds & Helmets PDF Version"}, "statistics": {}, "name": "Halberds & Helmets", "rpgproducer": {"71887": "Claudia Frei"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3506087.jpg", "usersrated": "0", "average": "0", "rpggenre": {"961": "Fantasy"}, "rpg": {"1652": "Labyrinth Lord"}, "rpgcategory": {"2130": "Alternate Rules (Variant Core Rules)"}, "poll": {}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3506087_t.jpg", "description": "User Summary:<br/><br/>The German translation of Halberds &amp;

Millennia ago, during a period of reduced magical activity, there was a nuclear power station at this location. When magical influences began to spread once more, the nuclear core became unstable, and began to develop a form of malevolent sentience. The ancients placed the core in a shaft three miles deep, the last 500 feet of which were filled with heavy water. This shaft, and its attendant control center, were given the codename &ldquo;Silent Nightfall&rdquo;.<br/><br/>In the ages since, much of the complex has collapsed or ceased to function, but the main shaft still remains, going three miles deep into the ground. The rooms that remain have undergone great changes, having been used for many different purposes and by many different creatures over the centuries. As a result, the original purpose of the shaft, rooms, and corridors has become obscured.<br/><br/>One of those who used the area was the wizard Mortmallion the Pale, who stole the Whispering Stone from Elfland. He hid himself and the stone in the Silent Nightfall complex, but the weird energies coming up from below changed him. Mortmallion can still be found, deep below, as the shaft crawler. Over time, the Whispering Stone became confused with the area where it is now found, and some texts refer to it as &ldquo;Silent Nightfall&rdquo; without making it clear why the stone has this name.<br/><br/>Currently, they are used as the nesting ground of owl-like humanoids that call themselves the grallistrix. Incubating their eggs in the Silent Nightfall complex has changed them, and they have become dangerous nocturnal predators in the region. The grallistrix hunt in triads, and locate prey by an extraordinary sense of hearing. As a result, communities nearby observe unexpected quiet at night &ndash; there are no late night gatherings. Inns and taverns close their doors with the fall of night.<br/><br/>Finally, the nuclear core itself has gained sentience and a malevolent, demonic intelligence. Imprisoned at the bottom of the shaft, it knows no other name than Silent Nightfall. So long as the demon remains bound, it is no great threat to the PCs or their world. In fact, they may be able to deal with it in order to gain magical aid.<br/><br/>In this way, the term &ldquo;Silent Nightfall&rdquo; has come to mean the following within the context of this location &ndash; the remains of the nuclear complex, the practice of avoiding loud noises after dark, the Whispering Stone, and the great demon imprisoned at the bottom of the shaft. This gives the judge many ways to lead the PCs into this material. It also allows the judge to make finding information difficult, as the many uses of &ldquo;Silent Nightfall&rdquo; spill into each other.<br/><br/>A challenging Dungeon Crawl Classics Adventure for 2nd level (or above).<br/><br/>"}, "150783": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2056454.jpg", "is_expanded_by": {"218495": {"name": "Antidote: Lab Alliance"}}, "poll": {}, "boardgamedesigner": {"49313": {"name": "Dennis Hoyle"}}, "statistics": {}, "yearpublished": "2013", "maxplayers": "7", "boardgameartist": {"76321": "Jonathan Logan Clark"}, "boardgamepublisher": {"1001": {"name": "(Web published)"}}, "maxplaytime": "30", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2056454_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "20", "boardgamecategory": {"1002": {"name": "Card Game"}}, "description": "In Antidote, you are a laboratory scientist working for a giant chemical research conglomerate.

They then score points based on the unused cards that remain in their hand, and how well those cards' scoring criteria are reflected in the final city plan.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": {"225469": "First Edition"}, "age": "12", "name": "Monster City Planners", "playingtime": "20", "boardgamemechanic": {"2041": "Card Drafting"}, "average": "6.36731", "usersrated": "52", "boardgamefamily": {"5615": "Monsters"}}, "150829": {"statistics": {}, "name": "The Price Is Right: Decades", "videogamemode": {"2422": "Local Multiplayer"}, "videogameversion": {"227171": "North American Wii edition"}, "average": "0", "videogametheme": {"2428": "Minigame Compilation"}, "videogamegenre": {"2169": "Trivia"}, "videogamefranchise": {"17090": "The Price Is Right"}, "videogameplatform": {"4441": "Wii"}, "usersrated": "0", "poll": {}, "description": "From the back of the box:<br/><br/>You're the next contestant!<br/><br/>40+ pricing games from four decades of The Price Is Right.<br/>Play using your Xbox 360 avatar.<br/>Play with up to 4 players.<br/>Bonus video from the game show.<br/><br/>"}, "150830": {"rpgitemversion": {"249330": "Hardcover Version"}, "statistics": {}, "name": "The Bleeding Hollow", "rpgproducer": {"51956": "Brian Berg"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1836573.jpg", "usersrated": "1", "average": "9", "rpggenre": {"961": "Fantasy"}, "rpg": {"2791": "Pathfinder System Compatible Product"}, "rpgcategory": {"2084": "Scenario / Adventure / Module"}, "poll": {}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1836573_t.jpg", "description": "from the cover<br/><br/>A sandbox-style adventure of survival, suspense and horror for 4 to 6 players of 5th level.<br/><br/>"}, "150831": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1886246.jpg", "poll": {}, "boardgamedesigner": {"71882": {"name": "Javier Garcia de Gabiola"}}, "statistics": {}, "yearpublished": "2013", "maxplayers": "2", "boardgameartist": {"11863": "Tim Allen"}, "boardgamepublisher": {"8007": {"name": "Victory Point Games"}}, "maxplaytime": "120", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1886246_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "120", "boardgamecategory": {"1021": {"name": "Economic"}}, "description": "Cuba: The Splendid Little War, from designer Javier Garcia de Gabiola, is a two-player simulation of the third War of Cuban Independence, which lasted from 1895 to 1898.

Originally published by Pacesetter in 1984, TIMEMASTER was an innovative RPG for its time (pun intended), presenting one of the earliest percentile &ldquo;chart-based&rdquo; game systems and a heavily supported and playable game of time travel; a feat few have been able to repeat. TIMEMASTER never suffered from the commonly perceived problems of time travel games, as it set out a very playable premise based on a number of &ldquo;laws&rdquo; of time travel, and infinite universes. A referee can run highly accurate historical games if desired, or fudge the details since it is in the distant past of the setting or even in an alternate timeline.<br/><br/>The current time in the game is in the 72nd Century, leaving a wide swath of time between (our) today and the future for the referee to design. History in your campaign could have taken various paths over such a vast time period. For example, characters could go back to the beginnings of interstellar travel, or the post-apocalyptic period following the blights and radioactive fallout of the third world war, if you envision your milieu following that timeline. The possibilities are quite literally endless.<br/><br/>Join the ranks of the Time Corps, and you can be the Master of Time!<br/><br/>"}, "150834": {"boardgamedesigner": {"73079": {"name": "Shaun Graham"}}, "average": "0", "poll": {}, "name": "Pocket Paddles", "playingtime": "15", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": {"2012": "Auction/Bidding"}, "yearpublished": "2013", "usersrated": "0", "maxplayers": "2", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1844794_t.jpg", "boardgameartist": {"71766": "Scott Huntington"}, "statistics": {}, "boardgamepublisher": {"1001": {"name": "(Web published)"}}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1844794.jpg", "boardgameversion": {"225478": "First edition"}, "maxplaytime": "15", "boardgamecategory": {"1008": {"name": "Nautical"}}, "age": "8", "minplaytime": "15", "description": "Pocket Paddles is a free print and play game for two players that fits in your wallet.

Finally, the deep froghemoth (CR 19) may well be the last remnant of an ancient space-faring race of proto-froghemoths who populated the stars.

The minotaurs in this tome are designed to take minotaurs from being an uninspiring low-level bruiser to a memorable encounter unto themselves.

This terrible guardian of tombs and other such places is an expert at crafting traps, and the sound of its approaching footsteps is so terrible that it drives fear into the heart of seasoned adventurers. Finally, the maze master minotaur (CR 15) is a minotaur of a more magical bent, who can drag foes into a mystical maze of its own creation, where they face deadly threats and, if slain, grant the maze master minotaur the ability to create a simulacrum of the victim to serve him.<br/><br/>"}, "150844": {"rpg": {"2791": "Pathfinder System Compatible Product"}, "statistics": {}, "name": "Broken Earth Player's Guide (Pathfinder)", "rpgproducer": {"69744": "Craig Hargraves"}, "usersrated": "0", "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1837256.jpg", "rpgitemversion": {"225508": "PDF version"}, "rpgsetting": {"24495": "Broken Earth"}, "average": "0", "rpggenre": {"441": "Horror (Supernatural)"}, "rpgcategory": {"2107": "Campaign Setting (game world)"}, "poll": {}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1837256_t.jpg", "description": "From publisher blurb:<br/><br/>Bombs fell.

All these games as well as some unrelated and more recent games are denoted by the word &quot;karuta&quot; from Portuguese &quot;carta&quot;. Due to the age of this loanword, it can be written in a bewildering number of ways. About equally frequent are \u304b\u308b\u305f in hiragana as other old loans that have been naturalised and \u30ab\u30eb\u30bf in katakana, like modern loanwords. Archaic and more rarely seen are &quot;sound-ateji forms&quot; like \u6b4c\u7559\u591a, \u52a0\u7559\u591a or \u5609\u7559\u592a using kanji for their sound value without reference to their meanings. The kanji \u9aa8\u724c might be read karuta, but primarily represents koppai \u3053\u3063\u3071\u3044, meaning a particular type of cards, or &quot;bone mahjong tiles&quot; (from Chinese g\u01d4 p&aacute;i meaning &quot;bone tile&quot;, referring to dominoes). Besides this, the term fuda \u3075\u3060 might be used for at least some forms of playing cards. This may also be written with the kanji \u672d with the primary meaning &quot;paper money&quot;, and in this sense read satsu \u3055\u3064.<br/><br/>The term &quot;Tensh\u014d karuta&quot; is a later term later applied to distinguish the oldest form (which in origin actually predates the Tensh\u014d period) from later developments.<br/><br/>The 48-card deck is divided into the four suits of pau \u3071\u3046 &ndash; from paus &quot;clubs&quot;, isu \u3044\u3059 &ndash; from espadas &quot;swords&quot; (shortened), koppu \u3053\u3063\u3077 &ndash; from copas &quot;cups&quot; and \u014dru \u304a\u3046\u308b &ndash; from ouros &quot;coins&quot; (literally the plural of &quot;gold&quot;). Each suit consists of 12 cards: rei \u308c\u3044 &ndash; from rei &quot;king&quot;, kaba \u304b\u3070 &ndash; from cavaleiro &quot;knight&quot; or cavalo &quot;horse&quot; (shortened), s\u014dta \u305d\u3046\u305f &ndash; from sota &quot;servant&quot; literally &quot;lower [rank]&quot; and number cards from ace to nine. As in the Portuguese precursor, the ace cards depicts a dragon holding the suit symbol. In the &quot;short&quot; suits of cups and coins the number cards rank in reverse from ace (high) to nine (low), while the &quot;long&quot; suits of clubs and swords are ranked normally. This feature is not only shared with older European cards, but at least for coins goes all the way back to the earliest Chinese playing cards.<br/><br/>Later some of the Portuguese-derived names are replaced by indigenous ones. Pau becomes hau \u306f\u3046, &quot;flower&quot;, and the clubs are shown sprouting flowers; while kaba becomes uma \u3046\u307e &quot;horse&quot;.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "0", "boardgameversion": {"225628": "Miike Museum card and Kobe City Museum woodblocks"}, "age": "0", "name": "Tensh\u014d karuta", "playingtime": "0", "average": "5", "usersrated": "1", "boardgamefamily": {"10634": "Country: Japan"}}, "150915": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2774395.jpg", "poll": {}, "boardgamedesigner": {"71982": {"name": "Samuel Bailey"}}, "statistics": {}, "yearpublished": "2013", "maxplayers": "5", "boardgameartist": {"14590": "Jason Juta"}, "boardgamepublisher": {"2973": {"name": "Edge Entertainment"}}, "maxplaytime": "120", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2774395_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "120", "boardgamecategory": {"1042": {"name": "Expansion for Base-game"}}, "description": "From Fantasy Flight Games:<br/><br/>It has been two months now since your good friend Dr. Crawford Tillinghast berated you angrily, called you a fool, and ejected you from his home and laboratory in a fit of fanatical rage.

These brilliant tacticians have decided to play a game of &quot;Hold Your Breath&quot; to see who is the toughest pirate because, you know, what else are you gonna do in the middle of the ocean facing certain death?<br/><br/>The game is played in two rounds. In the first round, each player may dive deeper, providing they have the &quot;Swim&quot; and &quot;Air&quot; cards to do so. Players press their luck each turn since it is the pirate who dives the deepest in round one AND resurfaces in round two who is the winner. What about the losers? Who cares, they are losers. But if you really want to know, well, they dove down and ran out of oxygen before they could resurface, so now they are just &quot;resting&quot; underwater until the next game, okay? But we digress...<br/><br/>Players can play &quot;Panic&quot;, &quot;Shark&quot;, and other nasty cards on the other players, slowing their progress. In the second round each player struggles to reach the surface before he runs out of air and therefore decides to take a rest. Most of the pirates may not make it back to the surface, but the one who makes it back alive AND dove the deepest is the winner. Be careful, though, because if you dove the deepest in the first round, you will surely have the toughest time getting back to the surface since A) you swam the deepest and B) no one else wants to see you make it back alive.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": {"225659": "English first edition"}, "average": "5.60263", "name": "Hold Your Breath!", "playingtime": "20", "boardgamemechanic": {"2040": "Hand Management"}, "age": "6", "boardgameexpansion": {}, "usersrated": "133", "boardgamefamily": {"8374": "Crowdfunding: Kickstarter"}}, "150926": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1840147.jpg", "boardgameimplementation": {"37380": "Roll Through the Ages: The Bronze Age"}, "is_expanded_by": {"150927": {"name": "Roll Through the Ages: The Iron Age \u2013 The Mediterranean Expansion"}}, "poll": {}, "boardgamedesigner": {"150": {"name": "Thomas Lehmann"}}, "statistics": {}, "boardgamecompilation": {"167828": "Roll Through the Ages: The Iron Age with Mediterranean Expansion"}, "yearpublished": "2014", "maxplayers": "4", "boardgamepublisher": {"597": {"name": "Eagle-Gryphon Games"}}, "maxplaytime": "60", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1840147_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "40", "boardgamecategory": {"1050": {"name": "Ancient"}}, "description": "Roll Through the Ages: The Iron Age, a sequel to the highly-awarded Roll Through the Ages: The Bronze Age, lets you build an Iron Age civilization in under an hour!

Once you get playing you&rsquo;ll have the core system mastered in short order, allowing players to create new character in minutes and GMs to draft new challenges on the fly.<br/><br/>The core of Pulp!'s fast game-play is a single six sided die (better known as a d6). When you want to do something that is more than mundane you roll a d6, then add an Ability Modifier and one Trait or Asset. Compare that number to a Difficulty set by the Game Master or an opposed roll.<br/><br/>To help create big action on the fly, the d6 also helps produce special circumstances related to your action. Roll a 6 on the die and Achieve Outstanding Success, performing so well you gain an additional benefit greater than what you hoped to achieve. Roll a 1 on the die and you&rsquo;ve cause a Complication. These add new elements to the scene that make things more difficult, but usually only fr a short time.<br/><br/>That means on every 1 out of 3 rolls, something interesting is sure to happen.

Like its award-winning predecessors Lords of War: Orcs versus Dwarves and Lords of War: Elves versus Lizardmen, the game sees fantasy races engage in dynamic tactical card battles, with the armies in this set having more heavy defense and the series&rsquo; first moving units.<br/><br/>During Lords of War battles, players use hands of six cards (called units) drawn from their army deck of 36 cards. A player turn starts with one card placed onto a gridded board. With the exception of ranged and spear units, cards must be placed adjacent to an enemy unit. An elimination phase follows in which you check for the elimination of opposing cards and the one you just placed. Cards have unique formations of attack arrows on their edges and corners signifying which adjacent cards they attack once played and the damage they will do. Each card also has a defense value which when exceeded by opposing cards sees that card defeated. Once combat has been resolved, the player can then either draw a new card from his army deck or retrieve a unit from the board that has not engaged in combat during that turn.<br/><br/>Play continues until one player has eliminated twenty units or four commanders.<br/><br/>The game is playable out of the box and contains two complete armies: the Templars and the Undead. These factions are differentiated by their unique cards and strategies; the Templar faction is based around a heavily armoured infantry and mobile palisades. The Undead army contains a stark range of defensive and offensive units, including zombies which roam across the battlefield.<br/><br/>Templars versus Undead is compatible with both Elves versus Lizardmen and Orcs versus Dwarves, meaning that all the Lords of War armies can be used to battle one another. The armies can also be blended together, using a strict ranking system, to create mercenary decks for tournament play.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": {"225752": "English first edition"}, "maxplaytime": "30", "average": "6.96661", "name": "Lords of War: Templars versus Undead", "playingtime": "30", "boardgamemechanic": {"2018": "Campaign / Battle Card Driven"}, "age": "12", "boardgameexpansion": {}, "usersrated": "140", "boardgamefamily": {"8374": "Crowdfunding: Kickstarter"}}, "150997": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2037826.jpg", "is_expanded_by": {"206376": {"name": "Shadows of Brimstone: Allies of the Old West Ally Expansion"}}, "poll": {}, "boardgamedesigner": {"8693": {"name": "Jason C.

Players create characters, taking on the role of a classic Western Hero Archetype, such as the Law Man, Gunslinger, or Saloon Girl. Forming an adventuring posse, the Heroes venture down into the dark mines, overrun with all manner of ancient demons and foul creatures from another world. With tactical gameplay, lots of dice, and a robust card-driven exploration system, no two games are ever the same as the heroes explore the mines finding new enemies to fight, new loot to collect, and new dangers to overcome. Players can even find portals to other worlds, stepping through to continue their adventures on the other side!<br/><br/>An exciting campaign system allows the players to visit local frontier towns between adventures, spending their hard-earned loot and building their characters from game to game! As players find fantastic gear and artifacts to equip their heroes, they also gain experience from their adventures. This experience is used to level up, guiding the hero's path through an expansive, class-specific upgrade tree of new skills and abilities, allowing each player to develop their hero to fit their own play style.<br/><br/>In Swamps of Death, players will encounter portals to the otherworld Jargono, a humid swampland inhabited by sentient reptiles, vicious dinosaurs and a tribe of humanoids, cut off from return to their homeworld untold years after their own portal closed.<br/><br/>So load up yer' six shooter, throw on yer' hat and poncho, and gather the posse as the darkness is coming, and all hell's about to break loose...in the Shadows of Brimstone!<br/><br/>Can be used together with Shadows of Brimstone: City of the Ancients to raise the maximum players to 6.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "1", "boardgameversion": {"225753": "English first edition"}, "maxplaytime": "60", "average": "8.09439", "name": "Shadows of Brimstone: Swamps of Death", "playingtime": "60", "boardgamemechanic": {"2023": "Co-operative Play"}, "age": "12", "boardgameexpansion": {}, "usersrated": "1504", "boardgameaccessory": {"216039": "Shadows of Brimstone: Deluxe Dark Stone Set"}, "boardgamesubdomain": {"5496": "Thematic Games"}, "boardgamefamily": {"24281": "Campaign Games"}}, "150998": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1847470.jpg", "poll": {}, "boardgamedesigner": {"1639": {"name": "Alessio Cavatore"}}, "statistics": {}, "yearpublished": "2014", "maxplayers": "4", "boardgameartist": {"67763": "Pete Borlace"}, "boardgamepublisher": {"8805": {"name": "River Horse Ltd."}}, "maxplaytime": "30", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1847470_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "30", "boardgamecategory": {"1002": {"name": "Card Game"}}, "description": "It's a four-player trick-tacking card game for the entire family.

In the advanced rules, there is a following suit rule and the two cards play a much heavier effect on play, identifying one team as good and one as evil, thus associating that team with the two 'evil' suits and vice versa.<br/><br/>The players take tricks, winning them by playing a higher card of the led suit or by playing the highest trump (i.e. a major arcana). At the end of the game the cards taken by winning the tricks are added up (face cards, aces and some major arcana are worth more points).<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": {"225754": "Kickstarter edition"}, "age": "10", "name": "The Tarot of Loka", "playingtime": "30", "boardgamemechanic": {"2009": "Trick-taking"}, "average": "7", "usersrated": "9", "boardgamefamily": {"8374": "Crowdfunding: Kickstarter"}}, "150999": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1848490.jpg", "poll": {}, "boardgamedesigner": {"2447": {"name": "Tom Cleaver"}}, "statistics": {}, "yearpublished": "2014", "maxplayers": "4", "boardgameartist": {"48465": "Banu Andaru"}, "boardgamepublisher": {"396": {"name": "Alderac Entertainment Group (AEG)"}}, "boardgameintegration": {"175223": "Valley of the Kings: Afterlife"}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1848490_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "45", "boardgamecategory": {"1050": {"name": "Ancient"}}, "boardgamehonor": {"26778": "2014 Golden Geek Best Card Game Nominee"}, "description": "When you die, you can take it with you!<br/><br/>Take on the role of Egyptian nobles at the time of the pharaohs, preparing for death and burial in the Valley of the Kings.
