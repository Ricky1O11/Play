It allows for the play of larger naval battles with a small number of players who will each control one or more squadrons of ships.  The game is typically played with miniatures on a hex grid.<br/><br/>The game system uses an action deck to determine which ships can activate and what actions they can perform.  The action cards have limitations based on a ship's fleet, sail state, wind orientation, crew quality, and damage level.  The more favorable the condition and status of a ship, the more cards it will activate on.<br/><br/>One card is flipped each turn and ships that meet the requirements of the card may perform actions as indicated in the instructions.  The actions allowed vary by card, but include moving one hex, sideslipping one hex, turning in a hex, and reloading cannons.  Once fired, cannons require two actions to reload.<br/><br/>After all actions from the flip of a card are completed, all ships with loaded cannons may fire simultaneously.  As a ship takes damage, its status reduces from undamaged to disabled to crippled.  As the status changes, the ship will have less chances to activate.<br/><br/>Additional rules cover critical hits, grappling, fires, forts, anchoring, and fire ships.<br/><br/>"}, "188503": {"rpgdesigner": ["Chris Conn", "Manuel Joaquin"], "rpgitemversion": ["PDF version"], "poll": [], "name": "5E Race: Arboreans", "rpgartist": ["Slava Gerj", "Shutterstock.com"], "rpgproducer": ["Chris Conn", "Manuel Joaquin"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2763643.jpg", "usersrated": "0", "average": "0", "statistics": [], "rpg": ["5e Game System Product (D&D 5th Edition Compatible)"], "rpgpublisher": ["Dragon Sun Game Company"], "rpgcategory": ["Sourcebook (rules/options to enhance play)"], "rpggenre": ["Fantasy (High Fantasy)"], "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2763643_t.jpg", "description": "From publisher blurb:<br/><br/>Benevolent Gods of the Forest <br/><br/>Arboreans are a race of immortal, sentient plants that can seed human-shaped Sprouts with their memories to act as their avatars in the world.<br/>With duties ranging from collecting information as simple tourists to dire missions to protect their forest homes, the Sprouts adventure forth before returning to their home to upload their memories &amp; consider remerging with the Tree.<br/>At once newborn yet ancient, motheringly gentle yet indomitably strong, innocent yet possessed of godlike wisdom, Arboreans are creatures of intriguing self contradiction.<br/><br/>The Arboreans are a new race for your fifth edition character, including:<br/><br/>    A completely detailed race of plant-people with a new twist<br/>    7 new feats anyone can use<br/>    &amp; 3 subraces: the proud Oukken, the rosey Romarins, &amp; the wild Vigne Arboreans<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>"}, "188504": {"rpgartist": ["Bob Greyvenstein", "Michael Jaecks", "Chris McFann", "Andrea Saavedra", "Tanya Sangsnit"], "rpg": ["Pathfinder System Compatible Product"], "poll": [], "name": "Norse", "rpgdesigner": ["Jason Nelson", "Alistair Rigg", "Mike Welham"], "rpgproducer": ["Rick Hershey", "Jason Nelson", "Alistair Rigg"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2763644.jpg", "usersrated": "0", "rpgitemversion": ["PDF version"], "average": "0", "statistics": [], "rpggenre": ["Fantasy (High Fantasy)", "Mythology / Folklore"], "rpgpublisher": ["Legendary Games"], "rpgcategory": ["Sourcebook (rules/options to enhance play)"], "rpgseries": ["Mythic Monsters", "Mythic Plug-Ins"], "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2763644_t.jpg", "description": "From publisher blurb:<br/><br/>Even the Vikings Fear Them! <br/><br/>Mythic Monsters: Norse brings you a dozen and one mythological monsters from the frozen shores of Scandinavia! Norse myths and legends are some of the foundational stories of the fantasy RPG tradition, going back to Tolkien and beforehand. The dwarves, elves, giants, and trolls of Norse myth and legend are at the heart of our myths and monsters, but they are just the beginning of an epic legendarium of creatures. From the scions of glorious Valhalla to the miserable pits of Hel, the blazing furnace of Muspelheim to the mountain realms of the Jotuns, the Nine Worlds are a place rife with adventure and danger always ready to menace the mortals of Midgard! From CR 5 to 30, we bring you an assortment of amazing adversaries for your heroes, starting with a swarm of linnorms, the serpentine primeval dragons that lurk in the wildest reaches of the lands where civilization is but a rumor. From the magma-mouthed crag linnorm to the bitter brumal bite of the ice linnorm, from the boreal forest fastnesses where the taiga linnorm lurks to the deep, dark waters where fjord linnorms prowl, these dragons leave dread in their wake, though perhaps none more so than the corpse-tearing cairn linnorm and the terrifying two-headed tarn linnorm. Fey spirits are likewise common in Nordic tales, with fossegrim waterfall spirits beguiling with their magical music and golden glamour to shadowy svartalfar inveigling mortals with their dark beauty while the hidden huldra simply seek to blend in with mortal society in hopes of finding a mate. The spirits of Asgard itself are represented as well, from the fallen einherji warriors to the valkyries that choose the slain and the wise and mysterious norns that judge them all. As if a dozen existing monsters were not enough, the fearsome Fenris wolf joins his brother Jormungandr the Midgard Serpent (from Mythic Monsters: Colossal) as a CR 30 menace whose hunger is endless and whose jaws span wide to devour the sun along with all life and hope. This book also contains mythic templates to bring the Nordic tropes of the Jotun thane, runecaster, and tricksome traveler to your creatures, along with additional rules for integrating mythic linnorms into your campaign!<br/><br/>"}, "188505": {"rpgdesigner": ["Duncan Conner", "Robbie Temple"], "rpg": ["d20 System / OGL Product (D&D 3.5 Compatible)"], "statistics": [], "name": "The Fires of Skinspeake", "rpgartist": ["Richard Simpson"], "rpgproducer": ["Duncan Conner"], "average": "0", "usersrated": "0", "rpgitemversion": ["PDF Version", "Softcover Version"], "rpggenre": ["Fantasy"], "rpgpublisher": ["X'I Publications"], "rpgcategory": ["Scenario / Adventure / Module"], "poll": [], "description": "From drivethrurpg:<br/><br/>The Fires of Skinspeake is the first offering from brand-new Scottish RPG Publishers, X'I Publications.

On a turn, you do the following:<br/><br/><br/>         Draw: Draw the top card from the deck and add it to your hand.<br/>         Play: Choose one of the two cards in hand to play and place it face up in front of you.<br/>         Effect: Carry out the played card's effect, after which the card is considered as discarded.<br/>         End: Throughout gameplay you're trying to eliminate other players or uncover the location of the &quot;Lost Legacy&quot; card; this card might also be in the &quot;Ruins&quot;, a location that holds one card at the start of the game and possibly acquires more cards during play. When someone discovers the Lost Legacy, the game ends, everyone tallies the value of the cards they've played and the card left in hand, and whoever has the highest total wins.<br/>    <br/><br/><br/>By combining different Lost Legacy sets (while keeping only a single Lost Legacy card in play), up to six players can compete at the same time.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": ["First edition"], "maxplaytime": "10", "name": "Lost Legacy: Orb of Prophecy", "playingtime": "10", "boardgamemechanic": ["Hand Management", "Memory", "Player Elimination"], "age": "14", "usersrated": "9", "average": "7.15889"}, "188562": {"rpgdesigner": ["Amber K.

To eliminate your opponents' warriors, you must force them into a challenge - where their strength and agility will be tested to the limit in battlegrounds from the heights of Mount Olympus to the very depths of Hades.

Each family has four grades from weak to strong. The player starts with four pieces at the lowest grade. When moving a piece, the player needs to answer a trivia question. If successful, wisdom points are added to their score. Wisdom points allow pieces to be upgraded to a higher grade.<br/><br/>When two pieces meet on the board, a challenge occurs with both players being asked the same set of questions simultaneously. The first person to answer correctly gets a point and the aim is to pull out a three point lead over the opponent to win the challenge. The loser of a challenge loses a grade. If the piece is already at the lowest grade, it is eliminated.<br/><br/>The aim of the game is to eliminate all the pieces of the opposing players.<br/><br/>"}, "188620": {"rpgdesigner": ["James Carter", "Robert Conway", "S.

United Earth is stretched thin and has lost significant diplomatic and economic control over the 89 years since the first colony was established. Thanks to recent technological advances, a new planet, Albion, has suddenly become accessible through the construction of a series of space bridges. With this new access, United Earth has issued the Albion Initiative, which rewards the first pioneer that can successfully reach Albion by purchasing, constructing, and traversing four space bridges from their home planet. Once a player reaches Albion, they win the game.<br/><br/>In order to earn sufficient in-game capital to purchase the necessary bridges, players control a spaceship that they will use to accumulate wealth and to strike fear into the hearts of their fellow gamers. Players can complete a series of missions, buy and sell commodities on the intergalactic commodities market, and engage other players in combat in order to pilfer their stores.<br/><br/>Each turn taken consists of three parts: Tile Placement, Movement &amp; Transactions, and Refueling.<br/><br/>Tile Placement: At the beginning of each turn, players must draw one Navigation Tile and place it in a space that connects it to that player&rsquo;s game piece via the lanes on existent pieces. Through the placement of the Navigation tiles, the game board takes shape as game play progresses. Also, this means that no two play-throughs will utilize the same game board.<br/><br/>Movement: After the tile is placed, players can then move their ship onto spaces that are connected to their game piece. In Bridges to Albion, players can only move as many spaces as they have fuel to reach. Each fuel cell displayed on their Ship&rsquo;s Console can be used to move one space. Each ship comes equipped with room for three fuel cells (an amount that can be upgraded eventually).<br/><br/>Missions:<br/>Each player starts the game with three mission cards. These missions can be completed at the player&rsquo;s discretion. Once a mission is completed and the corresponding reward is received, a player can choose to draw another mission card. A maximum of three mission cards per player is allowed. Mission rewards increase with each mission completed, so completing more missions is more lucrative. However, when a player is prepared to traverse their Bridges, any incomplete missions will incur a 500c fine for each Mission Card that the player retains. Mission Cards may not be sold, but players are allowed to conduct one-for-one trades between themselves throughout the game.<br/><br/>Combat:<br/>Any time during the game that two ships attempt to inhabit the same space on the board, a combat event is initiated. In a<br/>combat event, each player rolls one die. The player with the highest die roll wins, and the loser then must pay the winner the amount indicated on the pricing list. Ties are awarded to the non-attacking player. Battle losses are based on the number of missions the losing player has competed, and the more missions a player completes, the more they stand to lose in a fight.<br/>Each ship&rsquo;s weapons systems can be upgraded, allowing the player to roll more than one die in a combat event. The first<br/>weapons upgrade allows the player to roll two dice, and the second upgrade allows them to roll three. The sum of all<br/>applicable dice rolled is compared to the foe&rsquo;s total sum.<br/>It is possible for players to negotiate prior to a combat event being initiated in order to avoid the potential damage.<br/><br/>Transactions: Once a player arrives to a planet, they are free to conduct any business that they so choose. The Intergalactic<br/>Commodities Market provides an opportunity to buy commodities on one planet and then sell those same commodities on<br/>another planet for a profit.

These games will include all new graphics, corrected errata, and consolidated rules.<br/><br/>Volume I features four of the most famous and significant battles from the First English Civil War (1642-1646) which saw  Royalist ('Cavalier') supporters of King Charles I against the Parliamentarian ('Roundhead') supporters of the Long Parliament.<br/><br/>Edgehill (1642): Charles marched on London intending to force a decisive battle with the main Parliamentarian army under the Earl of Essex.. They met  at Edgehill in the  first pitched battle of the war. Both armies were inexperienced and ill  disciplined, and many fled or simply set about looting the enemy baggage train. As a result the battle was inconclusive and the war would continue for another four years.<br/><br/>First Newbury (1643): Almost exactly a year later and we see Charles again facing the Earl of Essex. The Royalists had enjoyed a series of successes which had left the Parliamentarians in disarray. As Charles besieged the town of Gloucester, the Parliamentarians mustered a force under Essex and through surprise succeeded in breaking the siege. They then fell back towards London. The Royalist rallied and, overtaking the Parliamentarians, blocked the path to London at Newbury. A surprise dawn attack saw the battle initially going in Essex's favour. Royalist counter-attacks were bloody and Essex was at risk of being encircled but fought back and pushed forward again - only to be slowed by Royalist cavalry. The Parliamentarian force was split in two but the Royalists attempt to drive through and encircle the wings was unsuccessful. With night falling and both sides exhausted the battle drew to a close. Next day, short of ammunition, the Royalists were obliged to allow Essex to continue his march to London.<br/><br/>Marston Moor (1644): This was to be the largest battle of the Civil Wars and saw the Royalists under Prince Rupert and the Marquis of Newcastle facing a combined English Parliamentarian /Scottish Covenantor force under the Lord Fairfax,  the Earl of Manchester and the Earl of Leven. Rupert marched to break the siege of the Earl of Newcaste at York. The armies met outside York on Marston Moor but Rupert, who had sought battle, hesitated from attacking due to being outnumbered. Towards evening the Parliamentarian and and Covenantors took the initiative and launched a surprise attack. After two hours of fighting Cromwell routed the Royalist cavalry following which the Royalist infantry were annihilated.<br/><br/>Naseby (1645): Though the war would continue for another 18 months, Naseby was the decisive battle of the First English Civil War, seeing Charles' main army, led by the King and Prince Rupert, destroyed by the Parliamentarian New Model Army under Fairfax and Cromwell. The Royalists held a strong position on a ridge between two villages but left it when they saw Parliamentarian cavalry withdrawing. Having redeployed the Royalists attacked and the two centres were soon locked in melee. On the Parliamentarian left the two cavalry wings engaged. The Parliamentarian cavalry broke and the Royalists pursued. After an initial face off on the Parliamenraian right, the cavalry wings engaged and the Royalists were routed by Cromwell. Unlike the Royalists on the other wing, only part of Cromwell's horse went in pursuit, with the rest attacking the Royalist centre - at the same time as a smaller attack on the other flank. The King sought to assist his beleaguered centre by personally leading his lifeguard to the rescue but was restrained . Rupert eventually rallied the horse  attacking the Parliamentarian baggage and returned to the field - but too late.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": ["First edition"], "age": "0", "name": "Battles of the English Civil Wars 1642 - 1651 Volume I", "playingtime": "0", "boardgamemechanic": ["Chit-Pull System", "Hex-and-Counter"], "average": "0", "usersrated": "0", "boardgamefamily": ["Admin: Unreleased Games", "English Civil War"]}, "188693": {"poll": [], "name": "Get Home Safe", "playingtime": "20", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": ["Roll / Spin and Move"], "yearpublished": "2013", "usersrated": "0", "maxplayers": "5", "average": "0", "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["Maxim"], "boardgameversion": ["Maxim English/Polish edition"], "maxplaytime": "20", "boardgamecategory": ["Puzzle"], "age": "5", "minplaytime": "10", "description": "Once you have completed the puzzle, take turns to spin the arrow and move your character accordingly.

Once your truck comes to rest on the city board, you  spend action points to drive around the board, collecting rubble from destroyed buildings for materials you will subsequently use to construct your own buildings.<br/><br/>Gameplay and strategy in Rubble Rousers is driven by hands of contract cards which can be played as either demolition contracts or construction contracts.

If your card is played as a construction contract, you earn VP by building a structure that contains the materials listed on the card. Be careful, however, because if you are unable to complete your contracts within two rounds of play, you will lose VP instead!<br/><br/>Special bonus action cards can be activated to allow you to re-roll unsatisfactory rolls, perform rule-bending actions, dump unwanted contracts and more.

That's 536 years, which is a LOT of history! Our system uses 10 year turns for a total of 54 turns. During these turns, the Romans (and Parthians/Sassanids) will create their empire, try to maintain it, and then finally defend it against many incursions.<br/><br/>The game covers not just the Roman Empire, but the Parthian/Sassanid (Persian) Empire as well, and even one you've probably not heard of: the Kushan Empire. The map covers from Ireland (Hibernia) to India and from Tingis (Morocco) to the lands of the Huns (Kazakhstan) on the 37&quot; by 18.5&quot; vinyl-covered map.<br/><br/>Units are included for all the peoples of Europe and Asia that were involved in the conflicts: the Celts (over 30 tribes), the Germans (tribes, migratory tribes, and Germanic Kingdoms), and over 35 other native peoples. Not only are the Huns included, but the less well-known Hunae (Hephthalites) that moved against the Sassanid Empire are as well. Two complete Roman armies are included on the four 88-counter sheets: the legions and the reformed Roman Army of the later Empire. There's even a counter for the &quot;Walls of Constantinople&quot; and counters for the numerous Civil Wars that Rome had. Leadership was important, and the best of the Roman Emperors are included, as well as the best of the Parthian and Sassanid &quot;King of Kings.&quot;<br/> Production is key to success, and the primary economic centers of Europe, Africa, and Asia are shown on the map. Gaining control of these is key to replacing your losses. The Parthians even get a boost for the profits from the Silk Road.<br/> Game Rules will be posted on-line and you can take a look at them before buying!<br/> &quot;Dulce et decorum est pro patria mori.&quot; -Horace<br/><br/>"}, "188748": {"image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2783160.jpg", "poll": [], "boardgamedesigner": ["Jeremy Laurie"], "statistics": [], "yearpublished": "2015", "maxplayers": "4", "boardgameartist": ["Jeremy Laurie"], "boardgamepublisher": ["(Web published)"], "maxplaytime": "60", "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2783160_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "30", "boardgamecategory": ["Expansion for Base-game", "Fan Expansion", "Print & Play"], "description": "This map is an unofficial fan made expansion.

Arctic Disaster, by designer Mark Stille, simulates the journey of PQ-17 as it transits Arctic waters en route to northern Russia. The 33 merchant ships of the convoy were provided a large escort of anti-submarine ships to ward off U-boat attack, a close covering force of four heavy cruisers and three destroyers, and a distant covering force of battleships HMS Duke of York and USS Washington, carrier HMS Victorious, and another two cruisers and 14 destroyers.<br/><br/>Nevertheless, in spite of this protection, only nine ships reached Russia. Arctic Disaster challenges the Allied player to use his assets wisely to run the convoy through and exact painful losses on the Germans. The Germans have assembled a large force of U-boats, torpedo-carrying aircraft and a heavy task force including battleship Tirpitz and heavy cruisers Admiral Scheer, Lutzow, and Hipper to crush the convoy.<br/><br/>Arctic Disaster features individual counters for every ship and submarine, while the Luftwaffe is represented by 9-12 aircraft groups. The game system is built around the uncertainty of task force activation, replicating the weak command and control evident on both sides. Surface to air combat, surface combat, and anti-submarine combat is modeled with a clean system steering the players clear of an elaborate combat resolution process that permits quick play and multiple game iterations. Detection is also handled in a manner so as not to overwhelm other game functions. Special rules include convoy scatter and the reluctance of both sides to commit heavy ships in the area of play.<br/><br/>"}, "188783": {"boardgamedesigner": ["Jason Juneau"], "average": "0", "poll": [], "name": "Apocalypse in the East: The Rise of the First Caliphate 646-656 A.D.", "playingtime": "300", "minplayers": "2", "yearpublished": "2016", "usersrated": "0", "maxplayers": "2", "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2803530_t.png", "boardgameartist": ["Mark Mahaffey"], "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["Against the Odds", "LPS, Inc."], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2803530.png", "boardgameversion": ["First edition"], "maxplaytime": "300", "boardgamecategory": ["Medieval", "Wargame"], "age": "0", "minplaytime": "180", "description": "The accession of the Caliph Uthm&atilde;n b.

The original plans were uninspiring and his generals feared an attritional stalemate. Over the winter the Germans keep taking the measure of their opponents and hit upon a plan was that inspired, risky, and utterly decisive. Ironic of Hitler to assume his remarkable success was simply the new template for all future campaigns. His eyes turned east....<br/><br/>But why, exactly, did France fall? This ATO Annual edition features four top designers all tasked with re-examining the 1940 campaign and answering that very question. They&rsquo;ve each settled on a single overriding theme to focus on. Yes, here is an issue not just featuring a game or two, but four complete simulations that provide hours and hours of challenging play and comparison. Don&rsquo;t miss it!<br/><br/>Steven Cunliffe with Strange Victory - A solitaire design, this game illustrates how the smaller but nimbler Germans got &quot;inside&quot; the Allied decision cycle to constantly impose small delays and major &quot;rethinks&quot; producing a catastrophic failure on the Allied side - though the better the Germans do may well panic their own High Command into halting them.<br/><br/>Michael Rinella with Springtime for Hitler - Explores the angle that the Germans at this time were quite simply indeed &quot;supermen&quot; at the top of their game. Possessing the best tactical airforce, the best plans and doctrine, and well motivated by National-Socialist ideology, they were unstoppable. Or were they?<br/><br/>John Prados with The Seeds of Disaster - Examines how pre-war plans and on-going intelligence and counter-intelligence efforts, deceit and deception, and foolishly projecting one's own motives on the enemy were THE key factors in explaining what happened in 1940.<br/><br/>Roger Nord with We Were Betrayed! - The most unusual of the four games, the two players are Britain and France respectively, nominally allies, against an automata German player governed by the game system. Did the French do themselves in by folding up early on? Or were they also done in by their British allies choosing to bug out early without informing their &quot;hosts&quot; and refusing any extra help, instead husbanding their resources for defense of Great Britain? Both players may cooperate to win, but absolutely must position themselves to secure their national interests if France does fall.<br/><br/>Four Roads to Paris offers four complete simulations that will provide hours of challenging play and comparison. And as always, the Annual features an &quot;extra-size&quot; magazine, with an in-depth look at the history behind the games, plus other articles.

If the player can successfully complete their quest without dying, the hero is triumphant and they can test their skill in another quest or try to improve upon their completion time.<br/><br/>"}, "188800": {"rpgdesigner": ["Bjorn Beckert", "Dominic Hladek", "Martin John", "Tobias Junge", "Stefan K\u00fcppers", "Uli Lindner", "Dennis Maciuszek"], "rpgitemversion": ["German Hardcover Version", "German PDF Version"], "statistics": [], "name": "Der Merkur", "rpgartist": ["Steffen Brand", "Markus Holzum", "Eric Lofgren", "Rich Longmore", "Christian Schob"], "rpgproducer": ["Ralf Berszuck", "Kathrin Dodenhoeft", "Patric G\u00f6tz", "Nicole Heinrichs", "Stefan K\u00fcppers", "Uli Lindner"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3364836.jpg", "usersrated": "0", "rpgsetting": ["The Ether (Space: 1889)"], "average": "0", "rpggenre": ["Action / Adventure (Pulp)", "History (Alternative)", "History (Victorian Era)", "Steampunk"], "rpgpublisher": ["Uhrwerk Verlag"], "rpg": ["Space: 1889 (Ubiquity edition)"], "rpgcategory": ["Campaign Setting (game world)"], "poll": [], "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3364836_t.jpg", "description": "[User summary:]<br/>Sourcebook for the planet Mercury in the world of Space:1889, containing a description of all parts of the planet (Hot Side, Dark Side, Twilight Zone) as well as an adventure about a circumnavigation of the World River.<br/><br/>This book is part of the Ubiquity version of Space:1889.<br/><br/>"}, "188801": {"rpgartist": ["Aaron Acevedo", "Bruno Balixa", "Colin Boyer", "Donald Crank", "Matthew Cutter", "Dennis Darmody", "James Denton", "Sebastien Eccose", "Irina Kovalova", "Chris Malidore", "Will Nunes", "Claudio Pozas", "Aaron J.

These IS forces defeated the Tripoli-based Muslim brotherhood forces and the Tobruk-based Nationalist government.<br/><br/>Now having control of most of Libya and Tunis, the new rogue state launched terror attacks against touristic resorts in Southern Greece, Italy and Spain. This, coupled with the arrival of huge masses of migrants fleeing from the war, threatened with destabilizing the southern shores of the European Union, which were already suffering the effects of a systemic, decade-long economic crisis. The IS got hold of oil and gas producing areas in Libya, thus financing their activities in Iraq and Syria, the Sahel, Sub Saharan Africa and elsewhere, with the aim of expanding militarily towards Sudan, Algeria, Chad and Mali. In a desperate attempt to stabilize the North African region, a coalition formed by the EU, the US, Egypt and the surviving anti-Islamist forces in Tunis and Libya launch a stabilization campaign spearheaded by elite special operation forces.<br/><br/>Libya War explores the first few weeks of that hypothetical pacification campaign scenario.

Its main rules are mostly the same as in any other Tarock game, but there are a few rules that make it distinct: buying a card (see below) and rules for the Fool, which works like the French Tarot Excuse rather than its usual Tarock function of the highest trump.<br/><br/>All but 3 cards are dealt out, these last three forming a talon. Then, the players have a single round of bidding to determine who will be the declarer in this round. The declarer always plays against the other two players, who form a temporary partnership. The possible bids are to take the talon and buy a card (exchange a card from the declarer's hand for any other card he calls for), take the talon without buying a card, or not take the talon at all. There is also an ultimate bid where the declarer binds himself to take all tricks.<br/><br/>After a card has been bought and an exchange with the talon has been made by the declarer (if any of these were a part of the highest bid), eldest leads a card to first trick. As usual in Tarock, players are obliged to follow suit and trump if they cannot. To win a normal bid, a player must take at least half of the card-points - an expection is the bid where all tricks have to be taken.<br/><br/>After a deal has been scored (loser(s) paying an amount of points based on the bid and the number of card-points taken by the declarer to the winner(s)), the declarer becomes the dealer for the next round.

All of the entries are available here: #Threeforged RPG Design Challenge Winners and Everything<br/>Entry #153; Stage One: Vivian Abraham; Stage Two: Joe Wasson; Stage Three: Ella McConnell<br/><br/>    <br/><br/><br/>From the Introduction:<br/><br/>You are all students at a school for witches and wizards.  First and second period is Double Potions.  Will you get into trouble in class?  Will you be sent to the nurse&rsquo;s office?  Or will you work together to successfully create a magical potion?<br/><br/>Potions are not to be taken lightly. They are among the most powerful magic that exists. You may think that it&rsquo;s fun to create a little fart juice for your fourth period magical animal taming or a sneaking syrup to get past the hall monitor but potions have been the cause of almost every major incident in wizarding history.<br/><br/>Brewing potions is dangerous business. When the magical essence of something as small as a cucumber seed is release in the wrong way it can have disastrous consequences, so I expect you all to behave and focus.<br/><br/>Double Potions is a game for 2 to 6 players. You will need a handful of six-sided dice, a bunch (about 10) of tokens in each of four colors and an opaque bag. You will also need your wits as Double Potions is a game as much about improv as it is about rolling dice. Oh, and it&rsquo;s also about potions, but only mildly so.<br/><br/>"}, "188879": {"rpgartist": ["Jason Engle"], "rpg": ["Generic / Universal"], "poll": [], "name": "Pathfinder Map Pack: Forest Dangers", "rpgdesigner": ["Stephen Radney-MacFarland"], "rpgproducer": ["(Uncredited)"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2774892.jpg", "usersrated": "2", "rpgitemversion": ["PDF Version"], "average": "5", "statistics": [], "rpggenre": ["Fantasy"], "rpgpublisher": ["Paizo Publishing"], "rpgcategory": ["Accessory (dice, maps, screens, cards)"], "rpgseries": ["Pathfinder Map Pack"], "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2774892_t.jpg", "description": "Publisher Blurb:<br/><br/>Anything can hide among the trees and along the paths that wind through the woods, but who ever said every trail was safe?

Theirs was an oral tradition, and much was not written down until far after. This feeds our view of the Isles being a place fogged in myth and legend. They fought against the Romans, terrifying even the most trained of Legions, traded with the ancient Greeks, built castles on the barest of ocean rocks, and more.<br/><br/>The Ultimate Celts Guide is a sourcebook for Savage Worlds that seeks to convey a handful of polished gems made from the myth and history of the Celts, ensuring you can utilize these people and their legends in your games.

The Road to Ruin is set in the aftermath of a zombie infection outbreak that has left the city overrun by hordes of unstoppable zombies.<br/><br/>Each player controls a survivor of the outbreak. On their turn, the players move their survivor around hidden locations, revealing each location and the level of zombie threat at that location.  Each of the locations is unique, and they may grant the survivor more items or weapons, allow the survivor to scavenge the location for equipment, or might be hazards that block the survivors path.  Each of the survivors has a special ability, such as an affinity with a specific type of weapons (melee or ranged), general combat proficiency, extra health, or move versatile movement.<br/><br/>The survivors fight the zombies as they explore each location.  In combat, the players roll two six-dice and then use their survivor's weapons and items to attempt to beat the zombie's threat level (which is between 7 and 11).  Equipped weapons allow the player to reroll, melee weapons give one reroll and ranged weapons give two rerolls but require matching ammunition.  If the survivor fails to fight of the zombie, they are wounded.  Each survivor can take on a few wounds before they eliminated.  However, survivors can use medical items to remove wounds, and can even discard items in combat to gain more rerolls in a last ditch effort to stay alive.<br/><br/>The goal of the game is to recover multiple supply items and to bring these back to the safe house location before the survivors fall to the zombies.  The Road to Ruin comes with four scenarios.  The basic scenario 'Supply Run' mentioned above lays out the game's 25 locations in a 5x5 grid and tasks the survivors with recovering six supply items.  Other scenarios use different layouts to create varied challenges, including one where the survivors must use a radio at a specific location to call for rescue and then reach the airport location to win.  Each of the scenarios also has an easy variation, which usually requires fewer items to be recovered.<br/><br/>"}, "188952": {"boardgamedesigner": ["\u6709\u6cc9\u8aa0\u6d69 (Shigehiro Ariizumi)"], "average": "5.90217", "poll": [], "name": "Maigo-Neko", "playingtime": "30", "minplayers": "3", "boardgamemechanic": ["Modular Board", "Point to Point Movement"], "yearpublished": "2015", "usersrated": "23", "maxplayers": "4", "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2775522_t.jpg", "boardgameartist": ["\u30ca\u30ab\u30bf\u30e8\u30a6\u30b3 (Youko Nakata)"], "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["\u3070\u306d\u30b2\u30fc\u90e8(\u4eee) (Spring Games Club.temp)"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2775522.jpg", "boardgameversion": ["Japanese first edition", "Japanese second edition", "Multilingual first edition"], "maxplaytime": "0", "boardgamecategory": ["Animals", "Deduction", "Exploration"], "age": "10", "minplaytime": "30", "description": "Pre-Order:Japon Brand <br/><a target='_blank' href='http://japonbrand.myshopify.com/collections/product2016' rel='nofollow'>http://japonbrand.myshopify.com/collections/product2016</a><br/><br/>\u307e\u3044\u3054\u306d\u3053 (Maigoneko) means &quot;stray cats&quot; in English, and in the game, you are a lost cat wondering around town.

It combines true elements of D&amp;D table top roleplaying using ver3.5 Dungeons and Dragons rules with a versatility of a card game dungeon crawl. If you&rsquo;ve ever played the original computer version of Dungeon Hack and loved the endless possibilities, then this is the game for you. It allows for solo or CO-OP play within a randomly generated multi-level dungeon. Just like in the computer game, you explore a never ending dungeon with monsters, treasure, traps, and glory! It&rsquo;s you against the dungeon and everyone is out to get you! Dungeon Hack uses actual monsters, traps, treasures and equipment directly from the Dungeon and Dragons universe. Story lines and game play is taken from actual D&amp;D modules! If you&rsquo;ve wanted to play D&amp;D but couldn&rsquo;t find the group, well look no further&hellip; Dungeon Hack is here! You create actual characters with abilities that you will use during your adventure. All the while you earn experience and fortunes to help level up and grow your character to much stronger and higher levels.<br/><br/>Dungeon Hack: Dungeon Adventure is a solo D&amp;D game on a micro level using 4&rdquo;x4&rdquo; tile cards representing dungeon rooms, corridor rooms, corridors and junctions while colored cubes represent your characters and the ever increasing monsters. A multitude of cards depict and define the monsters, treasures, encounters, and obstacles you will face within the dungeon.<br/><br/>Most D&amp;D rules apply, with many of the mundane and complicated rules left out to create a smoother and more stream lined game play.<br/><br/>The goal is to descend each level facing new encounters that will bring you face to face with puzzles, doors, traps, monsters and treasures at every turn. Before every two levels you will have a QUEST card that depicts special requests for the town asking for specific items you can find during your adventures through the levels of the dungeon. If you find or collect all of the items on the QUEST card you receive the stated reward from the town.<br/><br/>Each level of the dungeon you descend will end up providing your character with a level of experience; if you survive to the lowest level of the dungeon, you will have reached the level of hero to be able to challenge the Big Boss!<br/><br/>As you descend deeper into the dungeon you will encounter stronger and more dangerous monsters. When you reach the lowest level you will finally come face to face with the Big Boss of the dungeon which could be a dragon, a demon, etc&hellip; basically the challenge of your life!<br/><br/>Survive the dungeon, make it out alive, and you will become the dungeon master! You&rsquo;re victory score will be based on the level you reach &ldquo;experience points&rdquo;, the gold pieces you&rsquo;ve earned &ldquo;total gp&rdquo;, the treasure you&rsquo;ve accumulated &ldquo;gp value&rdquo;, and the monsters you&rsquo;ve killed &ldquo;total monsters destroyed&rdquo;!<br/><br/>"}, "188957": {"poll": [], "name": "Journey on the Amazon Game", "playingtime": "30", "minplayers": "2", "yearpublished": "0", "usersrated": "1", "maxplayers": "6", "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2944543_t.jpg", "average": "3.5", "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["(Unknown)", "Aristoplay"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2944543.jpg", "boardgameversion": ["First edition"], "maxplaytime": "0", "boardgamecategory": ["Children's Game", "Racing"], "age": "4", "minplaytime": "30", "description": "How wonderful it will be to take a journey down the Amazon with your friends Bromley (parrot fish) and Coltica (parrot).

These evils are no less a threat than the ones that most adventurers face, but many PCs are ill-equipped to deal with them. This is a job for rebels.<br/><br/>This book presents five new rebellious archetypes for five different classes. Included are the revolution&rsquo;s fury, a barbarian archetype whose righteous rage serves as a beacon to her allies, rallying them behind her cause, the wild blaster, a kineticist archetype capable of great surges of energy, but who lacks staying power, forcing them to use hit-and-run guerilla tactics, the keeper of the revolution, an occultist archetype that specializes in concealing people and things, and who can gather information through psychic contacts, the prophet of the revolution, an oracle archetype cursed with an aura in which blood flows more freely, and who experiences visions that can empower herself and her allies against tyranny, and the guerilla skirmisher, a rogue archetype that focuses on hit-and-run tactics and is even more slippery and evasive than other rogues.<br/><br/>Whether you're about to embark on a politically-themed campaign (such as the official Paizo adventure path focusing on revolution), or you just want a selection of exciting new abilities for passionate and freedom-loving PCs, this book has lots of tantalizing options to offer.

Characters have Attributes (Strength, Vitality, Nimbleness, Perception, Bearing, Intellect, and Magic) which have numeric values that are either randomly generated by 2D6 or assigned from a standard matrix (10, 9, 7, 7, 5, and 4).  Characters also have several Secondary Attributes which are derived values.  Characters next select a Heritage (Muggle, Muggle-born, Half-Muggle, Pureblood, or Non-magical Wizard/Squib), join a Wizard House, and select Skills.  Skills are placed in Skill Groups and Skills also allow for Specialization (sub-categories within a Skill).  Character creation completes with the assignment of Traits (either Edges or Flaws - or both).  Magical characters will also select Abilities, roughly analogous to spell abilities.<br/><br/>Action resolution pits 2D6 plus modifiers against a Target Number.  Routine tasks have a Target Number of 5; Impossible tasks have a Target Number of 25.  Modifiers are either situational or based on innate Skill or Ability.  Combat functions similarly but uses a wide variety of special maneuvers and situations.<br/><br/>"}, "188999": {"boardgamedesigner": ["Josiah Hurst"], "poll": [], "name": "The Game of Full Barn", "playingtime": "30", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": ["Set Collection"], "yearpublished": "0", "usersrated": "0", "maxplayers": "4", "average": "0", "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["(Unknown)"], "boardgameversion": ["First edition"], "maxplaytime": "30", "boardgamecategory": ["Card Game"], "age": "5", "minplaytime": "15", "description": "The game comes with 12 different cards, four of each kind.
