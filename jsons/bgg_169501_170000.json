Next to this card, place that Issue&rsquo;s Episode Card, and the corresponding Episode Objective Cards (stacked face-down and in sequence).<br/><br/>3. Each Player selects (7) super heroes or super villains and places them face-down on the playing area before them. These characters should have power icons and keywords on them that match as many power icons and keywords listed on the Episode Objective Cards.<br/><br/>Shuffle each of these characters&rsquo; (5) Action Cards in with the (25) core cards in your League Deck.<br/><br/>4.

Draw (7) cards each to form your starting Hands.<br/><br/>______________________________________________________________________________________<br/><br/>GAME TURN PHASES<br/><br/>Each game turn in XO! is divided into five phases:<br/><br/>1. Status Check Phase<br/>2. Card Discard/Draw Phase<br/>3. Attack Phase<br/>4. Feat/Thwart Phase<br/>5. Turn Resolution Phase<br/><br/>______<br/><br/>1. STATUS CHECK Phase<br/><br/>(This phase is skipped during the first turn)<br/><br/>Remove Status cards tagged to any Characters or Objects in play who were &lt;Blinded&gt;, &lt;Short-Circuited&gt;, &lt;Staggered&gt;, &lt;Stunned&gt;, or &lt;Winded&gt;.<br/><br/>Characters or Objects in play who are tagged with the &lt;Damaged&gt;, &lt;Injured&gt;, &lt;Incapacitated&gt;, &lt;Prone&gt;, &lt;Sabotaged&gt;, or &lt;Trapped&gt; Status Cards retain their Status cards until other cards are played that instruct players to remove them.<br/><br/>2. CARD DISCARD / DRAW Phase<br/><br/>On the First Turn, both players draw (7) cards to form their Hands.<br/><br/>At the start of every turn thereafter, players may each discard up to (2) cards from their Hands, and then draw back up to (7) cards.<br/><br/>3. ATTACK Phase<br/><br/>During this phase, the Active Player may attack with as many characters as he wishes (as long as those characters are able to do so, and have the requisite Energy Cards to use cards from the Active Player&rsquo;s Hand).<br/><br/>NOTE: Card play may change the order of some attacks, regardless of who the Active Player is at the time.<br/><br/>- Combat Rounds<br/><br/>Each Combat Round is divided into three segments: Hit Determination segment, Damage Effect Determination segment, and Counterattack segment.<br/><br/>Each attack is resolved in whatever order the Active Player desires. The Responding Player may play applicable defenses and modifier cards to counter the attacks.<br/><br/>The Active Player indicates which character in play is attacking, and who the defending enemy character or target will be.<br/><br/>Hit Determination Segment<br/><br/>During this phase segment, you determine if an attack hits or misses.<br/><br/>The Attacking Character (Attacker) rolls the number of dice indicated by the value on his or her card&rsquo;s Attack Icon. The Defending Character (Defender) rolls the number of dice indicated by the value on his or her card&rsquo;s Defense Icon.<br/>The Attacker&rsquo;s attack roll result (plus any applicable modifiers) becomes his/her Attack Combat Value (ACV). The Defender&rsquo;s attack roll result (plus any applicable modifiers) becomes his/her Defense Combat Value (DCV).<br/>Compare the DCV to the ACV:<br/>If the DCV equals or exceeds the ACV, the attack fails, and the Defender takes no damage, and suffers no attack effects. The Attack Phase immediately ends.<br/><br/>If the ACV exceeds the DCV, the attack hits, and the Defender takes damage. Proceed to the Damage Effect Determination segment.<br/><br/>Damage Effect Determination Segment<br/><br/>During this phase segment, you determine how much damage the Defender sustains, and what effect, if any, the attack has on the Defender&rsquo;s Readiness Status.<br/><br/>The difference between the Attacker&rsquo;s ACV and the Defender&rsquo;s DCV is the amount of damage the Defender sustains. This Damage Value (plus any Attack Effect Damage) is compared to the Defender&rsquo;s Health Value which is listed within his/her card&rsquo;s Health Icon:<br/><br/>If the amount of damage sustained is less than the Defender&rsquo;s Health Value, the character remains in play. If the attack has a listed effect, that attack effect is now applied (see Attack Effects).<br/>If the amount of damage sustained is equal to the Defender&rsquo;s Health Value, the character remains in play but is tagged with the &lt;Stunned&gt; Status card.<br/>If the amount of damage sustained by the Defender is greater than his/her Health Value, the Defender is &lt;KOd&gt; and placed on top of the League Deck discard pile.<br/><br/>- Attack Effects<br/><br/>Different attacks have different effects. For &lt;Blinded&gt;, &lt;Burned&gt;, &lt;Frozen&gt;, &lt;Horrified&gt;, &lt;Knocked Back&gt;, &lt;Staggered&gt;, or &lt;Stunned&gt; attack effects, tag the Defender&rsquo;s card with the appropriate Status card.<br/><br/>Tagging a card means to attach a Status Card to it.<br/><br/>Follow the instructions on attached Status Cards to determine their impact on characters and objects for the rest of the turn.<br/><br/>- Moffed Attacks and Defenses<br/><br/>If a Defender or Attacker rolls (1) or more dice, and all of the roll results equal (0), that defense or attack is considered to have &ldquo;monumentally failed&rdquo; (moffed).<br/><br/>When the Defender&rsquo;s DCV is moffed, s/he sustains (+1) Die of Damage during the Damage Effect Determination segment.<br/><br/>When the Attacker&rsquo;s ACV is moffed, the Defender has the opportunity to immediately counterattack.<br/><br/>Counterattack Segment<br/><br/>A Defender may only counterattack if s/he has the Counterattack ability, or if the Attacker moffed his/her ACV.<br/><br/>To resolve the Counterattack, follow the standard combat resolution steps listed above. The Counterattack&rsquo;s Damage Type is determined by the Defender&rsquo;s Superpower Icon (listed on the Character card&rsquo;s upper-left corner).<br/><br/>Once all of the Active Player&rsquo;s attacks have been resolved, his Attacks Phase ends.<br/><br/>- AOE Damage Effects<br/><br/>Some attacks indicate they are AOE Attacks. This means they are Area of Affect attacks which affect both the defending target of the attack and any characters adjacent to the Defender.<br/><br/>5. FEATS COMPLETION Phase<br/><br/>During this phase, the Active Player assigns a ready character in play with the requisite Power icon (or Keyword) to attempt a feat that will complete his league&rsquo;s current Episode Objective.<br/><br/>- Resolving Feat Attempt<br/><br/>The Active Player rolls as many dice as s/he can to attempt the feat (based on the numbers indicated on the acting character&rsquo;s card, as well as on any applicable cards from the Active Player&rsquo;s Hand):<br/><br/>If the Feat Attempt roll result (plus any modifiers) equals or exceeds the Feat Completion Value (FCV) indicated within the Completion diamond, the feat is successfully completed.<br/>Otherwise, the feat attempt fails, and the phase ends.<br/>Should the Active Player&rsquo;s feat attempt succeed, the Responding Player may assign a ready character in play to attempt to thwart the feat.<br/><br/>To do this, the Responding Player&rsquo;s character must have the requisite Power icon or Keyword to attempt the thwart:<br/><br/>If the Thwart Attempt roll result (plus any modifiers) equals or exceeds the Thwart Completion Value (TCV) indicated within the Completion diamond, the feat is successfully completed.<br/>In this case, the Responding Player gains a 2-point bonus on his or her next turn, when attempting to complete his or her League&rsquo;s Episode Objective.<br/>If the thwart attempt fails, the Active Player &ldquo;wins&rdquo; the Episode Objective Card. The card is removed from the Story Line, and placed in the Active Player&rsquo;s Victory Area.<br/>SCORING<br/><br/>Once all seven Episode Objective Cards have been completed, the player with four or more of them wins the game.<br/><br/>6. TURN RESOLUTION Phase<br/><br/>Once the Active Player has finished attacking and attempting a feat, his turn is over. If all seven Objective Cards are completed, the game ends, and you proceed to Scoring.<br/><br/>Otherwise, the next player becomes the Active Player, and the game proceeds.<br/> ______________________________________________________________________________________<br/><br/>COMBAT DICE<br/><br/>Each player gets (7) six-sided dice to use during the game.

The first line, after making initial penetration would then fan left and right, widening the breach. The succeeding lines would drive straight ahead, deepening the plunge. A reserve would then arrive, to stem the sure gray counterattack.<br/><br/>Mule Shoe Salient is a regimental-level simulation of the Federal assault on May 12, 1864 at The Bloody Angle, which was the culmination of the Battle of Spotsylvania.<br/><br/>Each unit represents several companies of 120 men/strength point, or artillery sections representing 2 guns. Players alternate moving units and firing. The Federal player wins if their units occupy three or more victory hexes, while the Confederate player wins if no victory hexes are occupied by Federal troops. Any other result is a draw.<br/><br/>11x17 map, 140 die-cut counters, 12 page rulebook.<br/><br/>(source: One Small Step website and user's description)<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "1", "boardgameversion": {"260760": "First edition"}, "average": "6", "name": "The Mule Shoe Salient", "playingtime": "120", "boardgamemechanic": {"2026": "Hex-and-Counter"}, "age": "12", "usersrated": "1", "boardgamefamily": {"35988": "Magazine: CounterFact"}}, "169999": {"boardgamedesigner": {"156": {"name": "Charles Vasey"}}, "average": "8", "poll": {}, "name": "The 2015 Election", "playingtime": "90", "minplayers": "2", "yearpublished": "2015", "usersrated": "1", "boardgamefamily": {"34116": "Political: Elections"}, "maxplayers": "2", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2502024_t.jpg", "boardgameartist": {"3888": "Mike Siggins"}, "statistics": {}, "boardgamepublisher": {"4": {"name": "(Self-Published)"}}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2502024.jpg", "boardgameversion": {"260762": "First edition"}, "maxplaytime": "90", "boardgamecategory": {"1001": {"name": "Political"}}, "age": "12", "minplaytime": "90", "description": "A light political game involving vote placement and based on &quot;The 2010 Election&quot; but aiming to cover the May 2015 election.

leadership?<br/><br/>Time to kick tradition in the butt.<br/><br/>Using mechanics similar to Heist, this game turns fairy tales on their ear, as not-so-helpless princesses tell the story of how they escaped the clutches of the villain-of-the-week, all whilst avoiding the irritating and domineering hero.<br/><br/>"}, "169593": {"rpg": {"356": "Generic / Universal"}, "poll": {}, "name": "Beaches &

Five Armies is a game of risk, deduction, and luck for 2&ndash;4 players based on the original Love Letter game by Seiji Kanai. The deck consists of 17 cards, with the Arkenstone being valued #8, Bilbo Baggins #7, and so on down to The One Ring at #0.<br/><br/>In each round, each player starts with only one card in hand; one card is removed from play. On a turn, you draw one card, and play one card, using the power on that card to expose others and (possibly) knock them out of the round. If you're the final player active in the round or the player with the highest card when the deck runs out, then you score a point. In LL: The Hobbit, The One Ring does nothing during play, but it counts as a #7 when the game ends, possibly leading to a tie should someone else hold Bilbo.<br/><br/>In addition to the one extra card, LL: The Hobbit differs from the original game in that the Baron (#3) is represented by two separate cards: Tauriel and Legolas. When you use an elf's power to compare cards, Tauriel knocks out the player with the higher valued card while Legolas targets the lower valued card. (This change isn't in the German edition, where Legolas and Tauriel have the same text.)<br/><br/>Whoever first wins 4-7 rounds, with the number dependent on the number of players, wins the game!<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": {"260175": "English first edition"}, "name": "Love Letter: The Hobbit \u2013 The Battle of the Five Armies", "playingtime": "30", "boardgamemechanic": {"2040": "Hand Management"}, "average": "7.21771", "usersrated": "1082", "boardgamefamily": {"25594": "AEG: 5 Minute Fun"}}, "169612": {"rpgitemversion": {"260176": "PDF version"}, "poll": {}, "name": "Infected Zombie", "rpgproducer": {"21063": "Steven Trustrum"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2734743.jpg", "usersrated": "0", "average": "0", "statistics": {}, "rpggenre": {"28957": "Horror (Zombies)"}, "rpg": {"286": "Savage Worlds"}, "rpgcategory": {"2108": "Sourcebook (rules/options to enhance play)"}, "rpgseries": {"23681": "Monster Brief"}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2734743_t.jpg", "description": "From publisher blurb:<br/><br/>Bring the Infected Zombie Hordes to Your Savage Worlds Game<br/><br/>Is your Savage Worlds game missing the infected zombie hordes you've always dreamed of?<br/><br/>This release of Monster Brief provides game stats on the Infected Zombie, a creature returned from the dead to eat brains and spread its infection to the living.<br/><br/>Includes the infected zombie template so you can transform any creature into an infected member of the undead, along with example infected zombie civilian, rat swarm, and wolf/ dog stat blocks.

After choosing a Leader and Moral Cause that give special abilities to your kingdom, each player works through four seasons each year: planning, deployment, battle, and recovery. During planning season, you collect tax revenues, recruit troops, and identify battle targets. During deployment season, you muster Warbands, travel the environment, and scout the terrain. During battle season, you engage opponents in battle and resolve individual skirmishes. During recovery season, you pay maintenance, retreat units and reinforce adjacent territories.<br/><br/>Actions in each phase affect the outcome of the next phase. For example, by travelling the Environment and scouting the Terrain during deployment season; you will alter the engagements in battle season. The battle system requires each player to select up to 3 Warband Unit cards, from their hand, that face-off with competing kingdoms. After a simultaneous reveal, cards are resolved one-versus-one with additional Supply, Tactics, or Training cards from the Warband, and purchased during planning season, that are used to modify the encounter. Winning cards remain at the settlement. Losing cards are returned to the Kingdom Reserve and must be re-purchased to re-enter the game.

Secrets are hidden everywhere, and you never know what you might find on the next screen. Those who take the time to explore instead of merely rushing to the next objective will certainly be rewarded.<br/><br/>Battles are turn based, but play out quickly.

Enemies will do the same to you, making them even more dangerous in numbers. Your HP will drain quickly, so be sure to use abilities and items to your advantage.

The fledgling warrior will journey across entire continents, slowly unraveling the mysteries of the world around him and encountering countless new people and places.<br/><br/>While some retro games focus on parody and humor, Another Star lets its plot play out on its own weight to evoke the atmosphere of storytelling in an age when storage space was tight even for simple text and every word had to count.<br/><br/>Tachi's adventure is presented using a high-quality CRT shader to emulate the feel of the old 8-bit consoles that inspired its look. Don't like the effect? System too slow to handle it?

Only a few rules changes were included to continue following the track of the D6 system evolution.<br/><br/>Please note that very, very few actual changes are included in this rulebook. There are mostly &ldquo;optional&rdquo; rules additions.

And that's a perfectly valid approach! But I think it also makes for a spread of RPGs today that are all just a bit too similiar. I wanted to make an RPG that was a game designer's game first. That's why this is a game that has a lot more gameplay than fluff.<br/><br/>For fans of RPGs, many elements might individually come as a shock--there's no NPCs, no shops, and just one town in the whole game. You gain levels in a way such that you're never forced to grind, and the battles themselves are made to go quickly and succinctly (this game doesn't waste your time). The decisions you make over the course of the game have little effect on the story, but have ramifications for your characters' abilities and what dungeons you play. The puzzles are based on spatial manipulation, and require logical thinking beyond memorization or basic lock-and-key archetypes. While I still clung onto some of the superficial bits of old RPGs that I loved like combat menus and inventories, I also worked at every turn to personalize those things or optimize them to make something that's both classic and new. In playing, all of these &quot;weird&quot; pieces fit together very well.<br/><br/>But morseo, this is a game for those who &quot;aren't really into RPGS (anymore).&quot; This is a pervasive sentiment, and one which I share (!!!) My goal at the outset was to make an adventure that I'd want to play--one that was fast and fun, with a good story but also good gameplay.

Each round each player takes a System card from the deck which defines its position in the galaxy: depending on it he can commerce or make deals with other players, attack or be attacked. Once per round each player may jump to a new System and this may have various advantages: fleeing from a powerful enemy, pursuing a weak enemy and also, each time a player reaches a new system he may draw a card from the game deck.

The ashes from the first great war still darken the snow. The capitalistic city-state known simply as &ldquo;The Factory&rdquo;, which fueled the war with heavily armored mechs, has closed its doors, drawing the attention of several nearby countries.<br/><br/>Scythe is an engine-building game set in an alternate-history 1920s period. It is a time of farming and war, broken hearts and rusted gears, innovation and valor. In Scythe, each player represents a character from one of five factions of Eastern Europe who are attempting to earn their fortune and claim their faction's stake in the land around the mysterious Factory. Players conquer territory, enlist new recruits, reap resources, gain villagers, build structures, and activate monstrous mechs.<br/><br/>Each player begins the game with different resources (power, coins, combat acumen, and popularity), a different starting location, and a hidden goal. Starting positions are specially calibrated to contribute to each faction&rsquo;s uniqueness and the asymmetrical nature of the game (each faction always starts in the same place).<br/><br/>Scythe gives players almost complete control over their fate. Other than each player&rsquo;s individual hidden objective card, the only elements of luck or variability are &ldquo;encounter&rdquo; cards that players will draw as they interact with the citizens of newly explored lands. Each encounter card provides the player with several options, allowing them to mitigate the luck of the draw through their selection. Combat is also driven by choices, not luck or randomness.<br/><br/>Scythe uses a streamlined action-selection mechanism (no rounds or phases) to keep gameplay moving at a brisk pace and reduce downtime between turns. While there is plenty of direct conflict for players who seek it, there is no player elimination.<br/><br/>Every part of Scythe has an aspect of engine-building to it. Players can upgrade actions to become more efficient, build structures that improve their position on the map, enlist new recruits to enhance character abilities, activate mechs to deter opponents from invading, and expand their borders to reap greater types and quantities of resources. These engine-building aspects create a sense of momentum and progress throughout the game. The order in which players improve their engine adds to the unique feel of each game, even when playing one faction multiple times.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "1", "boardgameversion": {"334214": "Chinese first edition"}, "average": "8.31618", "name": "Scythe", "playingtime": "115", "boardgamemechanic": {"2080": "Area Control / Area Influence"}, "age": "14", "boardgameexpansion": {}, "usersrated": "18194", "boardgameaccessory": {"206690": "Scythe: Action Tokens"}, "boardgamesubdomain": {"5497": "Strategy Games"}, "boardgamefamily": {"26464": "Alternate History"}}, "169787": {"statistics": {}, "name": "Galaxy Trucker", "videogamemode": {"2621": "AI Only"}, "videogameversion": {"262484": "Android edition"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2329584.png", "videogametheme": {"2658": "Aliens"}, "usersrated": "35", "average": "8.00429", "videogamegenre": {"2165": "Puzzle"}, "videogameplatform": {"6063": "Android"}, "videogamehonor": {"26795": "2014 Golden Geek Best Indie Video Game Nominee"}, "poll": {}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2329584_t.png", "description": "iTunes Description<br/><br/>The award-winning adaptation of Vlaada Chv&aacute;til&rsquo;s award-winning board game.

Your sniper only has 6 shots so make them count, after that you will be shot every time you move in the open or side to side without sight restrictions.<br/><br/>You will lay out a 3x3 grid of Beach Terrain card to create the beach assault and as you progress up the beach you will create a new beach assault 3 more times until you get to the pillbox.<br/><br/>Here is the link to the WIP thread!<br/><a target='_blank' href='http://boardgamegeek.com/thread/1275178/wip-attack-omaha-beach-18-card-microgame-contest-e' rel='nofollow'>http://boardgamegeek.com/thread/1275178/wip-attack-omaha-bea...</a><br/><br/>Here is the link to the 18 Card Microgame contest thread!<br/><a target='_blank' href='http://boardgamegeek.com/geeklist/178832/item/3575479#item3575479' rel='nofollow'>http://boardgamegeek.com/geeklist/178832/item/3575479#item35...</a><br/><br/>", "minplayers": "1", "boardgameversion": {"260475": "First edition"}, "age": "13", "name": "Attack on Omaha Beach", "playingtime": "15", "boardgamemechanic": {"2676": "Grid Movement"}, "average": "5", "usersrated": "2", "boardgamefamily": {"19564": "Solitaire Print and Play Contest"}}, "169799": {"statistics": {}, "name": "Rage Runner", "videogamemode": {"2149": "Single-Player"}, "videogameversion": {"260478": "Macintosh Downloadable edition"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2367333.jpg", "videogametheme": {"2331": "Space"}, "usersrated": "1", "average": "5.5", "videogamegenre": {"2154": "Racing"}, "videogameplatform": {"4729": "Macintosh"}, "poll": {}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2367333_t.jpg", "description": "Description<br/><br/>This fast, fun and challenging sci-fi game is truly like no other 3D racer, it will make you cry JUST ONE MORE TRY!<br/><br/>Race through beautiful procedurally generated 3D space-scapes or a set of 13 hand-crafted challenges that will put your skills to the test.<br/><br/>Features<br/><br/><br/>     57 Steam Achievements<br/>     19 Steam Leaderboards<br/>     Level of the Day<br/>     Unlockable Ships<br/>     13 handcrafted levels<br/>     100,000,000 Procedurally Generated Levels<br/>     Tight Controls<br/>     Kid Mode (Joyride)<br/>     Level Editor<br/>     Great Soundtrack<br/><br/><br/>Source: The Developer Website.<br/><br/>"}, "169800": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2324403.jpg", "boardgameimplementation": {"191182": "Vud\u00f9: Double Trouble"}, "poll": {}, "boardgamedesigner": {"73483": {"name": "Francesco Giovo"}}, "statistics": {}, "yearpublished": "2015", "maxplayers": "8", "boardgameartist": {"34069": "Guido Favaro"}, "boardgamepublisher": {"12031": {"name": "Black Monk"}}, "maxplaytime": "30", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2324403_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "30", "boardgamecategory": {"1042": {"name": "Expansion for Base-game"}}, "description": "Banzai!

Beneath it all, the dungeons are the crushed remains of heaven itself. This is Uresia, the acclaimed, eccentric, and basically good-natured fantasy world by S. John Ross.<br/><br/>A world explored at several zoom-levels, from the broad sweep of kingdoms to a detailed fantasy city to the day-to-day of a remote rural village to the individual troubles and triumphs of specific characters across the grave.<br/><br/>Familiar enough to provide firm footing for traditional-fantasy fans (it's a world of warriors, wizards, thieves and vagabonds), but with a warmth &amp; personality entirely its own, with unexpected details around every corner (it's a world where Slimes and haunted snowmen are valid PCs, the &quot;common tongue&quot; is dangerous in the wrong company, and your campaign is just as likely to visit a sporting arena as the nearby trap-laden ruin).<br/><br/>Designed from the core as a game world. Every detail chosen to inspire characters and adventures.<br/><br/>Uresia comes from the author of such timeless classics as a cartoon in Dragon Magazine that one time, and a pretty good recipe for General Tso's Chicken. It's a wholly-revised-and-expanded edition, perfect for newcomers and satisfying to long-time fans. Uresia is fully illustrated, indexed, mapped, has clicky-things for the screen readers and removable layers for the home-printers. Every copy is made of 100% post-consumer recycled genre love and nitrate-free pixels.

Within the constraints of the campaign environment, you create a character concept for a fantasy story and actually play the character. It is much like improvisational theater--you have a framework created by the props and supporting characters and must develop your part as you progress through the storyline. Your character's attitudes, ambitions, and history are yours to define.<br/><br/>The basics of tabletop roleplaying are still prevalent, but SOLAR is primarily a &quot;do-it&quot; game. Instead of imagining yourself fending off a group of orcs with your trusty sword and then rolling some dice to see what happens, you would actually fend off a group of &quot;orcs&quot; (actually players like yourself, who are taking their turn being monsters) with your trusty foam-rubber sword. The results are based upon both your skill and your character's skill with that sword, instead of the luck of a dice roll.<br/><br/>If the adventurous life is your calling, you may play the part of a cunning rogue, a daredevil swashbuckler, or even an honorbound knight. Those proficient in magic are highly useful as well--much fame and fortune can be found for a skilled healer or an elemental adept. Your days can be spent fulfilling contracts, swapping stories in the tavern, or vanquishing the foul creatures that plague these frontier lands. If the epic life is not your style, then you can play the part of a town artisan. You can make your money selling your wares--and information--for the right price.<br/><br/>"}, "169843": {"rpg": {"25465": "Grognards & Goblins: A Fantasy Roleplaying Game of the Napoleonic Wars"}, "statistics": {}, "name": "Grognards & Goblins: A Fantasy Roleplaying Game of the Napoleonic Wars", "rpgproducer": {"3": "(Uncredited)"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2325148.jpg", "usersrated": "0", "rpgitemversion": {"260543": "PDF"}, "average": "0", "rpggenre": {"961": "Fantasy"}, "rpgcategory": {"2083": "Core Rules (min needed to play)"}, "poll": {}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2325148_t.jpg", "description": "Publisher's Blurb<br/><br/>Grognards &amp; Goblins is a game which encourages fantastic adventure in the age of Napoleon.

There are dragons and demons and the occasional Dark Lord, but in everyday life there are basically people. In this world magic isn&rsquo;t just something wizards toss around when they&rsquo;re feeling less subtle and more quick to anger; it&rsquo;s a commodity, an important part of the economy. The sale of magical items, ranging from simple agricultural charms to world-shaking artifacts, is an everyday occurrence. There are magic peddlers who wander from village to village in worrisome carts, but every town of any size has at least one magic item shop.<br/><br/>To adventurers a magic shop is a place of routine, a place to trade in treasure and stock up on healing potions. However, there are those to whom a magic shop is a workplace, where every ring of the bell above the door brings a customer looking to buy some trinket or other. This game is about these retail workers. Society tends to look right through them, and they don&rsquo;t have an easy life. This has a lot to do with the history of Pastoria and the nature of the magic trade. The region where Pastoria now stands was home to countless battles fought with ludicrously powerful magic. There are pockets of magical distortions and potentially dangerous artifacts all over the place. Magic items are plentiful, though it takes a certain amount of filtering to find the useful ones. Pastoria also has many more outworlders&mdash;visitors from other dimensions&mdash;than more distant lands. Society often shuns such people (and other things), but due to the dangers of working in close proximity to a high concentration of magical items, item store owners can&rsquo;t afford to be too picky about who they hire. Thus, the magic retail trade is something of a haven for those who for whatever reason don&rsquo;t quite fit into normal society.<br/><br/>Based on the random insanity of Maid: The Role-Playing Game, Retail Magic is an RPG about retail employees in the magic item trade. It blends satire of retail work with ludicrous anime comedy action. Roll the dice, and find out that your half-centaur half-pixie paladin started working at a magic shop because of unrequited love, and that when stressed out she tries to hide in a box. Roll for random events, and see a stray cat come to the store, or a ninja attack, or an invasion of angels!<br/><br/>The Golden Friday Edition is a special discount pre-release version of Retail Magic. It includes the full rules needed to play, including employee, boss, and store generation, six random event tables, and two introductory scenarios. Oh, and a spell components table just for the hell of it.<br/><br/>To play you will need a few friends (sorry, we can&rsquo;t do much about that for you), pencil, paper, some six-sided dice, and the energy to keep up with the random insanity the game will provide.<br/><br/>"}, "169846": {"poll": {}, "name": "Nation Builder", "playingtime": "120", "minplayers": "1", "boardgamemechanic": {"2664": "Deck / Pool Building"}, "yearpublished": "2001", "usersrated": "1", "maxplayers": "4", "boardgamefamily": {"22184": "Admin: Unreleased Games"}, "average": "8", "statistics": {}, "boardgamepublisher": {"29165": {"name": "Zen River Games and Software"}}, "boardgameversion": {"260546": "Second edition"}, "maxplaytime": "120", "boardgamecategory": {"1002": {"name": "Card Game"}}, "age": "12", "minplaytime": "120", "description": "Nation Builder is a game that puts players in the position of administering a small nation that is struggling to survive in the shadow of the world's super powers.

The theme and mechanics are based upon the re-discovered Selden Map which depicts trading routes in China and had been lost for nearly 300 years. In Fujian Trader, players assume the role of Ming-era merchant families following trading routes in the East China Sea. Victory-points are gained by trading (or raiding) the goods of iron, silk, and rice for silver and influence. To win, players must accrue the most victory-points in order to successfully endure the Manchu invasion and subsequent Ming Empire collapse at the end of the game.<br/><br/>The game board is divided up into six different regions separated into six different colors. Each region has several ports. Players start out with a number of ports (dependent on the number of players) and may receive goods based off of which ports they control.

Players may purchase additional ports with money gained from trading or incite rebellions in already controlled ports to wrestle them from an opponent.<br/><br/>The game ends after the Manchu first invade the Ming Empire. The invasion starts once the last of three Manchu Move cards is drawn from the Event deck. Players then have a three rounds to trade goods and two rounds to store silver, thus accruing victory-points.

For that, you can turn to a mythic heritage. This new aspect of mythic characters allows for further customization of your mythic character. A mythic character can choose a mythic heritage in addition to his or her mythic path, and doing so grants him access to a number of unique abilities that are designed to reflect the flavor of his heritage, while also being of value to characters of every mythic path.<br/><br/>This installment explores the fire heritage, and characters that are in some way intrinsically connected to fire. They might be related through blood to a fiery creature, such as an elemental, or might be the child of a powerful spellcaster who is devoted to fire. They might have otherwise gained their mythic power from fire, having it bestowed upon them by a fire giant queen, or by purifying themselves in supernatural or magical fire. However they came about, those touched by mythic fire have dominion over flame and are able to imbue weapons with fire and enhance fire spells.<br/><br/>"}, "169868": {"rpgitemversion": {"260573": "Nephilim (French RPG, Troisi\u00e8me \u00c9dition)"}, "statistics": {}, "name": "Livre du Meneur de Jeu", "rpgproducer": {"14544": "S\u00e9bastien C\u00e9lerin"}, "rpg": {"2528": "Nephilim: R\u00e9v\u00e9lation"}, "usersrated": "0", "rpggenre": {"550": "Modern"}, "rpgcategory": {"2083": "Core Rules (min needed to play)"}, "poll": {}, "average": "0", "description": "user summary<br/><br/>The core book of the (French) third edition of Nephilim. <br/>Nephilim: R\u00e9v\u00e9lation<br/><br/>"}, "169869": {"statistics": {}, "name": "Nekketsu Kakut\u014d Densetsu", "videogamemode": {"2313": "Cooperative"}, "videogameversion": {"260575": "Japanese Family Computer"}, "average": "0", "videogameseries": {"11485": "Kunio Kun"}, "videogametheme": {"2493": "Martial Arts"}, "usersrated": "0", "videogamegenre": {"2159": "Fighting"}, "videogameplatform": {"4430": "NES"}, "poll": {}, "description": "Nekketsu Kakut\u014d Densetsu (\u71b1\u8840\u683c\u95d8\u4f1d\u8aac lit. &quot;Hot Blooded Fighting Legend&quot;) is a 1992 tournament-style fighting game developed and published by Techn\u014ds Japan exclusively in Japan for the Family Computer on December 23, 1992.

Music was changing for the better, movies were getting wider, and TV was getting riskier. We always had to look up the phone number to the neighbourhood pizza joint in something called a &ldquo;phone book&rdquo;, but we had our friends&rsquo; phone numbers memorized. We were less than ten years away from a technological revolution that would make our world seem quaint, and we were none the wiser. High School was all we knew.<br/><br/>This suburban high school class has had its share of memories -- victorious, hysterical, wistful, and tragic. Now, it&rsquo;s time to come together to celebrate after 20 years of being apart. Some people want to live it up with their best friends and reconnect with old ones. Some want to take advantage of having a target-rich environment to sell cars, homes, software, and ideas. Others, however, are looking for closure, rekindling old feelings, and good old-fashioned retribution. This reunion seems like the best place to make it happen.&quot;<br/><br/>"}, "169918": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2763045.jpg", "poll": {}, "boardgamedesigner": {"79505": {"name": "Conrad Hamel"}}, "statistics": {}, "yearpublished": "2016", "maxplayers": "6", "boardgameartist": {"17414": "Christian Opperer"}, "boardgamepublisher": {"550": {"name": "Spieltrieb"}}, "maxplaytime": "60", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2763045_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "45", "boardgamecategory": {"1009": {"name": "Abstract Strategy"}}, "description": "Magia Cum Laude is about a magical test.<br/><br/>The apprentices of the Academy of Babas came together to fulfill their master exam.

However, in response to requests from play-testers, they have been extended to cover everything between the biblical era and the late medieval period.<br/><br/>They have been designed so that they can be used for anything from solo play with 100 or so miniatures through to huge games with 3000 plus miniatures and up to 5 players a side. A square grid has been used to promote speed of play. This also enables figures which have been based on different frontages for use with a variety of rule systems to be used together on the same battlefield.<br/><br/>Absolutely no dice are used in To the Strongest! Instead, an innovative (and entertaining) mechanism uses playing cards to activate units, which can each potentially move or fight multiple times during the same turn. Shooting and melees are resolved quickly and decisively, amidst a flurry of playing cards....<br/><br/>Despite their relative simplicity, the author believes that these rules capture the essential flavour of an ancient or medieval battle, and that the more seasoned gamer will find more than enough command decisions to entertain and challenge him.

The winner is the first person to line up at least three pieces of the same color in a row. If both players place all of their pieces without getting three in a row, the second player wins.<br/><br/>For rule set #2 (2-4 players), players take turns drawing random pieces from a bag and placing them on the board. If a player manages to surround any number of pieces in a line (horizontal, vertical, or diagonal) with two cookies of the same color (one on either end), the player captures all of the surrounded pieces. The captured pieces are worth points at the end of the game. Bonus points are obtained by capturing sets of certain color combinations. When all pieces have been played, the person with the most points wins.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": {"260730": "Japanese first edition"}, "age": "0", "name": "Ou-sama no Macaron", "playingtime": "30", "boardgamemechanic": {"2004": "Set Collection"}, "average": "5.625", "usersrated": "4", "boardgamefamily": {"5841": "Food / Cooking"}}, "169974": {"statistics": {}, "name": "Space Hulk - Sword of Halcyon Campaign", "videogamemode": {"2422": "Local Multiplayer"}, "videogameversion": {"260731": "Windows Downloadable Edition"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2625003.jpg", "videogameseries": {"27617": "Space Hulk"}, "videogametheme": {"2658": "Aliens"}, "videogamefranchise": {"5716": "Warhammer 40,000"}, "videogameexpansion": {"134978": "Space Hulk (2013)"}, "average": "7", "videogamegenre": {"2147": "Action"}, "videogameplatform": {"4977": "Windows"}, "usersrated": "1", "poll": {}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2625003_t.jpg", "description": "User Summary<br/><br/>The Sword of Halycon is a space marine vessel that is left in orbit around the planet Falkhan ready to commence it's journey back to it's homeworld.

With thirteen computer stations, this bridge can fit a large group of Player Characters and their allied starship crew.<br/><br/>Starship Bridge is intended for far future science fiction games.<br/><br/>Adventure hook for use with this map:<br/><br/>Impulsive Act: The captain of the starship approaches the vessel of a species known for warlike behavior slowly while hailing them to profess they are friendly and not hostile. As the large starship nears the alien vessel, it swings into action and rams the starship. Breeching tubes rip through the hull as alien marines fight their way to the lifts. The alien marines pour out of the lifts and try to take over the bridge. It&rsquo;s up to the Player Characters to prevent the aliens from taking over the ship, first by fighting them off of the bridge, and then using the lifts to get to lower levels and drive them back to their ship.<br/><br/>"}, "169978": {"rpgitemversion": {"260735": "PDF version"}, "poll": {}, "name": "Countryside Bus Stop", "rpgproducer": {"60450": "Christian Hollnbuchner"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2328292.jpg", "usersrated": "0", "average": "0", "rpggenre": {"550": "Modern"}, "statistics": {}, "rpg": {"356": "Generic / Universal"}, "rpgcategory": {"2086": "Accessory (dice, maps, screens, cards)"}, "rpgseries": {"18350": "Battlemaps (by Christian Hollnbuchner)"}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2328292_t.jpg", "description": "From publisher blurb:<br/><br/>This full color battlemap is the 230th of a series featuring various terrains.
