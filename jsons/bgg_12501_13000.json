Lastly, it was to also take absolute control away from the player and provide uncertainty, have the men not always perform as well as desired.<br/><br/>Reprinted as Baptism of Fire II<br/><br/>"}, "12586": {"boardgamedesigner": ["Helmut Kimpel"], "poll": [], "name": "Constellation", "playingtime": "60", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": ["Pattern Building", "Point to Point Movement"], "yearpublished": "1995", "usersrated": "3", "boardgamesubdomain": ["Abstract Games"], "maxplayers": "2", "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic112501_t.jpg", "average": "5.66667", "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["Helmut Kimpel Games", "Tomorrow's Games by Rollis"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic112501.jpg", "boardgameversion": ["First Edition", "Tomorrow's Games Edition"], "maxplaytime": "60", "boardgamecategory": ["Abstract Strategy", "Space Exploration"], "age": "8", "minplaytime": "60", "description": "Each player has 10 pieces:  the 9 planets and the Sun.

The pawn is placed on the corner starting space of the matching color, and the number tokens are placed on their corresponding spaces near the player&rsquo;s start space. Six yellow tokens&mdash;numbered 1 to 6&mdash;are shuffled and placed face-down on the black circles in the middle of the board. All but the middle one are then covered with caps.<br/><br/> Object:  Players try to collect the numbered tokens of their own color and to assemble them into the highest possible number (i.e., 4321). As the first token is collected, it the must be placed on the ones column, the second on the tens, the third on the hundreds, and the last on the thousands column.<br/><br/> Play:  Chose a start player and play clockwise. The active player takes one cap of his choice and places it over the one yellow token that lies free (for the first player, this will be the one in the middle of the board). The number token just freed is turned face up (if not already face-up). The number on it determines how many spaces the player moves his pawn. If he lands on a yellow space, he repeats the procedure (i.e., transfer a cap, reveal a number, move pawn). If he does not land on a yellow space, his turn ends and it is the next player's turn.<br/><br/>Obviously, a player who remembers which number is under which cap may plan his moves accordingly. He cannot, however, use the same movement number in two successive moves because the cap must always be placed on the free token. If a player lands on a yellow space three times in succession, he reshuffles the yellow tokens, places them face down, and covers them as was done at the start of the game.<br/><br/> Winning:  The first player to complete a 4-digit number wins and ends the game. If additional rounds are played, a running tally should be kept of each player&rsquo;s numbers, which are totaled at the end of the game.

There are two kinds of UWO; The Gnorfs and the Pnorfs. Both of them are able to morf. But that is something that will be explained later on. The Gnorfs think that the Pnorfs are a group of ugly creatures and that feeling is completely mutual. All the more reason for them to start a war!<br/><br/>beginning of the game<br/>UWO is a cardgame and a boardgame at the same time. Both players have six energy cards. The playing field is formed by the energy cards of both players. One player places them horizontally, directly in front of him. The other player does this at the side vertically, just like on the photo. The playing field is between these energy cards. <br/>Both players place their ten 'regular' UWO's of their own color in front of them in two rows of five each. The players shuffle their pack of cards and place them both upside down in front of them.<br/><br/>energy<br/>Just like life on our planet, life on Znorf is expensive too. Everything you do will cost you &quot;Energy&quot;. you have to pay it for morfing, walking or fighting. Strong UWO's use much energy. If both players used all of their six energy, then a round is over. Everyone gets back his energy. But beware! If you're out of energy and your opponent isn't yet, he will play several turns at once! And for your opponent, weak (and cheap) UWO's come in handy now. They can do a lot of damage to you!<br/><br/>many different UWO's<br/>There are no less than eight different UWO's in the game. Some are riding Knorfs (strange animails). They can trample everyone. Others are cowards, hiding in bunkers, etc.<br/>UWO's carry many different weapons. Lasers, dynamite, granades, bazooka's, etc. The bazooka UWO for instance, is one of the coolest of the gang and he himself thinks so too. He is extremely powerful. He can even blow up tanks! Unfortunately, such a bazooka is a great danger to our tiny UWO. Each time he has shot someone, he will be knocked out until the end of your next turn!<br/>UWO's are specialists. Every UWO has protection against a specific other UWO. For instance, a UWO in a tank has protection against one who fights with his bare hands.<br/><br/>dynamite UWO<br/>Well, let's just say there's only one of it on each side. One who can be quite important to both players...<br/><br/>morfing<br/>UWO's can morf in exchange for one energy point: UWO cards may be placed on UWO's that are already in the game. This way, a regular UWO can be morfed into anything you want to, just like that! This can be very useful. Imagine a laser UWO threatening you. Your opponent announces that it's going to attack!! Don't panic, his UWO can never hit you when you are hiding in a bunker! So, when you have this card, just morf your furry alien into one and shoot back...and hope your opponent doesn't morf his UWO into a grenade UWO...<br/><br/>the pack of cards<br/>At the end of each turn each player may refill his/her cards to 3. But beware, players can run out of cards. The game still goes on untill all UWO's of one player in the battlefield are destroyed. It is very easy for an opponent to adapt his army to yours, when you are not able to morf anymore! Imagine your opponent creating a small army of laser UWO's to attack your last bazooka UWO! They have protection against this weapon. You may panic now, cause your lost.<br/>In the pack of cards, there are also nine &quot;miss cards.&quot; When you play this card, the shot will automatically be declared &quot;missed&quot; and of course you will have the chance to shoot back with this UWO.

In the beginning of the game, the land lies undeveloped, a series of blank hexes representing mountains, forests, and grasslands.  Players win by building and using prestige properties that allow them to place their family's coat-of-arms onto the board -- first to place all their coats of arms wins.<br/><br/>To use these buildings, though, requires the player have the correct raw materials.  Swords and cloth, for example, or coins and paper.   Each one of these materials needs even more basic materials, such as iron ore, coal, and so on backward toward the most basic elements such as food, wood, and stone.<br/><br/>To cull these materials from the land, one builds buildings -- a Stonecutter's Hut, Smelter, Coin Manufactury, and so on.  Once on the board, buildings can be used by any player, not just the one who built them.<br/><br/>A player doesn't collect these resources for safekeeping as in The Settlers of Catan or Keythedral.  Instead, resources claimed via buildings must be used up either in the player's current turn or his next one.  If he doesn't, the resources spoil and are removed from the board.<br/><br/>Essentially, the challenge of the game is one of planning logistical supply chains which will allow one to process these resources most efficiently to build the prestige properties the fastest.  Since it's a perfect information game, one can also see what one's opponents are scheming, and place workers to interrupt their supply chains, possibly causing their resources to spoil and making the player start from zero again.<br/><br/>Neuland's most interesting innovation is perhaps its Time Track Mechanism, in which players who take less actions in a turn will have turns more frequently, and can forward-plan in order to take a long turn of nearly twenty actions instead of the ordinary maximum of ten.<br/><br/>Neuland was originally published by Eggert-Spiele in 2004, and republished by Z-man in 2006 with some significant rules changes.  A majority of BGG users seem to strongly prefer the original Eggert-Spiele rules.

But some say that one's reward in the afterlife is based on the misery endured in life. If so, there may yet be hope&mdash;if not in this world, then in the peace that lies beyond.<br/><br/>In the Gloom card game, you assume control of the fate of an eccentric family of misfits and misanthropes. The goal of the game is sad, but simple: you want your characters to suffer the greatest tragedies possible before passing on to the well-deserved respite of death. You'll play horrible mishaps like Pursued by Poodles or Mocked by Midgets on your own characters to lower their Self-Worth scores, while trying to cheer your opponents' characters with marriages and other happy occasions that pile on positive points. The player with the lowest total Family Value wins.<br/><br/>Printed on transparent plastic cards, Gloom features an innovative design by noted RPG author Keith Baker. Multiple modifier cards can be played on top of the same character card; since the cards are transparent, elements from previously played modifier cards either show through or are obscured by those played above them. You'll immediately and easily know the worth of every character, no matter how many modifiers they have. You've got to see (through) this game to believe it!<br/><br/>Each of the three expansions for Gloom adds one more player, thus with all three expansions, this should be playable with seven players.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": ["English first edition", "English second edition", "English second printing", "English third printing", "French first edition", "Italian first edition", "Spanish first edition"], "maxplaytime": "60", "average": "6.37947", "name": "Gloom", "playingtime": "60", "boardgamemechanic": ["Hand Management", "Storytelling", "Take That"], "age": "13", "boardgameexpansion": ["Gloom: Bookmark of Death", "Gloom: TableTop Promo Expansion", "Gloom: The Looking Glass Promo Card", "Gloom: Unfortunate Expeditions", "Gloom: Unhappy Homes", "Gloom: Unquiet Dead", "Gloom: Unwelcome Guests", "Munchkin Duck of Gloom"], "usersrated": "9454", "boardgamesubdomain": ["Thematic Games"], "boardgamefamily": ["Gloom"], "boardgamepodcastepisode": ["Allt p\u00e5 ett kort #14 \u2013 Gloom", "DJ43: Gloom (2004) Keith Baker", "Ep 2 - Recommended Games for Playing with Your Family", "Episode 24 - A Gloomy Halloween", "Gloom", "I've Been Diced! episode 60: Making history with Microscope, and games that tell stories", "PAX East 2011 Special", "RJ51: Jocs de taula i pol\u00edtica amb Jason Matthews", "Show #13.5 Session Report: Gloom", "Show #13: ACW Ironclad Minis and Gloom", "The Game Pit Podcast - Episode 59: Top Ten 3 Player Games", "The Game Pit: Episode 30 - Picking Over the Bones", "The Game Pit: Episode 40 - Council Chamber Mega Review of 2014 with Top 5s", "The One About Gaming After Dark"]}, "12693": {"boardgamedesigner": ["(Uncredited)"], "poll": [], "name": "Richard Petty Racing Trivia Game", "playingtime": "30", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": ["Dice Rolling"], "yearpublished": "1998", "usersrated": "3", "boardgamefamily": ["Sports Trivia", "Sports: Auto Racing"], "maxplayers": "4", "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic52491_t.jpg", "average": "4.26667", "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["Cardinal"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic52491.jpg", "maxplaytime": "30", "boardgamecategory": ["Racing", "Sports", "Trivia"], "age": "0", "minplaytime": "30", "description": "Like trivial pursuit but all about stock car racing and Richard Petty, Great game for that racing fan or for the Richard Petty collector. 1,000 questions.

Command of small fleets of ships is very easy in this game, as weapon effectiveness is determined by a single value and weapon damage is a single value (heavy, medium, light, etc).<br/><br/>Ship damage are represented by a damage area with 4 damage levels - two 'lights', a 'heavy', and a 'critical' damage level.  When a weapon damages a ship, a d10 is rolled and the weapon's size is compared against the size of the target ship on a chart to see the resulting damage level (with a chance of 'none' being one of the levels).  If the given damage level is already called for, the next level up is used.  The net effect is as mirrored by hypothetical naval combat - ships take very few hits to be 'mission killed'.<br/><br/>Detection is handled within the rules in a very basic way, although special note should be made of the submarine rules.  They make use of 'range bands' around a target ship.  Submarines are not placed on the 'board' unless detected, making their approach and attack on these 'range band' diagrams, essentially their exact position unknown to BOTH players - neatly avoiding the need for a third player as referee almost always required in other games of the type.<br/><br/>The production values of the game are fairly high - no counters or maps are included, but, given the nature of most modern naval games to use miniatures or simply graph paper, that's certainly forgivable.

In the 27th Century the Solar Federation was formed. Man now looked to the stars to expand further. The Federation's nearest neighbor, Proxima Centauri, some four and a quarter light years away, was explored and found to contain three habitable planets - Titan, Poseidon and Vidor.

One of the prime design goals of AoF was to find a level of detail that was fun and easy, but still captured the flavor of skirmish gaming. If rifle magazine capacities, tanks&rsquo; power-to-weight ratios, or the quantity of high explosive in particular shells are the type of factors you really want in a game, you should probably not be looking at this book. The basic assumption of AoF is that leadership, training, organization and motivation are more important than minor technological advantages in deciding who wins.

The game does not include Asia. It is strictly a series of naval and island hopping maneuvering and battles fought in the Pacific.

The boats and planes are so expensive that no one can really afford to wage much sea war after the first turn or two in A&amp;A. Enter Conquest of the Pacific. Both sides face daunting tasks. Japan has a huge fleet, but has a lot of islands it needs to conquer to win, and ends up being so far away from its supply lines that it usually can't defend everything while still being able to challenge the growing American fleet. America starts the war far from a state of readiness, but its huge economic advantage helps make up for it. The front is close to the US, so supply lines are short, but the Japanese fleet is usually much larger if it can consolidate. This makes for some interesting cat and mouse maneuvering and epic sea battles.<br/><br/>Planes take a large role in Conquest of the Pacific as they are able to:<br/><br/>1. land and take off from islands without it costing a movement point because the island and the sea zone(s) surrounding/adjacent to the island are considered the same zone.<br/><br/>2. project their defensive power one sea zone away from their island base zone during the opponent's combat phase.<br/><br/>3. defensively scramble to attack anything entering their zones of projected power during the opponent's turn on the combat movement and non-combat movement phases.<br/><br/>4. escort other units to protect them from defensive scramblers.<br/><br/>Battleships and Destroyers may bombard every round during an invasion, or once per turn without a land invasion.

For now, suffice it to say that cards placed next to each other are potentially worth points if the icons on their adjacent sides match up in either shape, number or color. Sometimes a player will want to aim for matches worth maximum points. Other times he may want to form &quot;connections&quot; worth no points at all, in hopes of stopping his opponent from scoring.

World War II in the East can be played with Axis and Allies figures and rules, but is meant to be played as a stand-alone game with over 900 counters. However, the rules and the hex sizes still allow Axis and Allies fans to get the most accurate World War II wargame they can find while still using the popular rules and pieces, if they wish.<br/><br/>In fact, World War II in the East can be used effectively to bring Axis and Allies fans into the wargaming hobby as the game combines some of the features of Axis and Allies and conventional counter wargames to produce a new style of game that is simple yet complex, fun yet challenging.<br/><br/>With World War II in the East, you fight major carrier engagements, have air battles over Guadalcanal, conduct landing operations on the many island chains of the Pacific, outflank and surround forces in Burma, as Japan transport resources from Southeast Asia and the East Indies, and manage the industrial output of your nation.<br/><br/>World War II in the East includes over 900 counters depicting the armed forces of the major belligerents as well as informational counters needed to play the game. Along with the major nations, you can find in the counter mix Australian, New Zealander, Indian, and East African units, as well as the well-known American fighter squadron that fought with China against the Japanese.<br/><br/>The beautifully hand-drawn map is made up of 12-pieces, totalling a size of 47 by 36 inches. The map has all of the charts and boxes needed for game play and has a scale of approximately 300km per hex. The hexes are large enough to hold Axis and Allies pieces, but it is ideally played with the counters that are sized to decrease mess and accidents during play.<br/><br/>The game is best played with the grand campaign which runs from December 1941 until the end of 1945, in monthly and bi-weekly turns. Scenarios allowing you to play shorter scenarios will be posted on the publisher's website as they become available.<br/><br/>World War II in the East&rsquo;s complexity is what sets it apart. It sets it apart from the other Axis and Allies games as the complexity is far greater and the history more accurate. It also sets it apart from the conventional counter wargames as it&rsquo;s complexity is slightly more simple, yet still depicts the war accurately while being fun and challenging. This is not a simple game, but its complexity allows both experienced and beginner wargamers to understand the rules and enjoy the game.<br/><br/>World War II in the East can be combined with World War II in the West to play the entire global war, both games combining to use over 2,500 counters and 25 square feet of maps!<br/><br/>"}, "12936": {"boardgamedesigner": ["Adam Godfroy"], "poll": [], "name": "Mentalis", "playingtime": "0", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": ["Hand Management", "Memory", "Tile Placement"], "yearpublished": "1977", "usersrated": "27", "boardgamesubdomain": ["Abstract Games"], "maxplayers": "0", "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic86322_t.jpg", "average": "7.57407", "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["Mentalis Limited"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic86322.jpg", "boardgameversion": ["English first edition", "Mentalis Ltd.

Greatly outnumbered, the Greeks delayed the enemy in one of the most famous last stands of history. Led by the Spartan King, Leonidas, a small force of 300 Spartans and 11,000 other allied Greeks blocked the only road through which the mighty army of the Persian King, Xerxes, could pass on its ongoing invasion of Greece. The massive Persian army, numbering well over 150,000 men succeeded in defeating the Greeks but sustained heavy losses, disproportionate to those of the Greeks. A local resident named Ephialtes betrayed the Greeks, revealing a mountain path that led behind the Greek lines. Dismissing the rest of the army, King Leonidas stayed behind with 300 Spartans and 700 Thespian volunteers to delay the advance of the Persian army as long as it could.<br/><br/>In the Battle of Thermopylae 2nd Edition board game is a 2 player board game where the two players must bid to see which player will control the smaller Greek forces.

The board is composed of 8 rooms that can be moved and rotated by the players. Each turn, a player is able to spend actions to move around the dungeon, pick up and use items, battle with the opponents team, or turn and move the rooms of the dungeon.<br/><br/>The goal is to reach 5 victory points.  Points are collected by moving adventurers out of the dungeon or by killing an opponent's adventurer. Objects are disseminated across the whole dungeon and will bring the adventurers well-needed powers.<br/><br/>Each player has the same characters, each with different powers. Some run fast, some fight or disarm traps. The cleric heals, magician burns everything in sight, and the goblin is so weak that the simple fact of getting him out will bring you two victory points.<br/><br/>Combat and actions are managed via cards. To move, fight, heal, or turn a room, you must manage action points obtained by playing cards. Those cards are not drawn but selected from a set of cards by both players. Both players have access to the same panel of cards at the beginning of the game, so the game is really about managing the resources and adapting to the changing environment.<br/><br/>Dungeon Twister is the original game in the Dungeon Twister series<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": ["Asmodee English Edition First Printing", "Asmodee English Edition Second Printing", "French version", "German Edition", "Italian Edition", "Spanish Edition"], "average": "6.85241", "name": "Dungeon Twister", "videogamebg": ["Dungeon Twister"], "playingtime": "60", "boardgamemechanic": ["Action Point Allowance System", "Grid Movement", "Hand Management", "Modular Board", "Secret Unit Deployment", "Tile Placement", "Variable Player Powers"], "age": "11", "boardgameexpansion": ["Dungeon Twister:  Room P3", "Dungeon Twister: 3/4 Players Expansion", "Dungeon Twister: \u00c0 Feu et \u00c0 Sang", "Dungeon Twister: Beggar", "Dungeon Twister: Bonus Objects", "Dungeon Twister: Cr\u00e9atures Sylvestres", "Dungeon Twister: Disciple", "Dungeon Twister: Dwarf Elf Slayer", "Dungeon Twister: Father Christmas", "Dungeon Twister: Fire and Water", "Dungeon Twister: Forces of Darkness", "Dungeon Twister: Forest Elf", "Dungeon Twister: Master of Time", "Dungeon Twister: Mercenaries", "Dungeon Twister: Minotaur", "Dungeon Twister: Neutral Characters", "Dungeon Twister: Ogre", "Dungeon Twister: Paladins & Dragons", "Dungeon Twister: Purple Dragon", "Dungeon Twister: Room P1", "Dungeon Twister: Room P2", "Dungeon Twister: Terres de Glace", "Dungeon Twister: The Elusive One", "Dungeon Twister: The Merciless One", "Dungeon Twister: Traps", "Dungeon Twister: Zephyr, the Cheater"], "usersrated": "5216", "boardgameaccessory": ["Dungeon Twister Base Set Miniatures", "Dungeon Twister Fire & Water Miniatures", "Dungeon Twister Forces of Darkness Miniatures", "Dungeon Twister Mercenaires Miniatures", "Dungeon Twister Paladins and Dragons Miniatures", "Dungeon Twister Zombies Set", "Dungeon Twister: Base Set Arabian Stand-Ups", "Dungeon Twister: Base Set Gender-Reversed Stand-Ups"], "boardgamesubdomain": ["Strategy Games"], "boardgamefamily": ["Dungeon Twister"], "boardgamepodcastepisode": ["Episodio 11 \u2013 Especial verano 2013: Juegos no jugados"]}, "12996": {"image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1015313.jpg", "poll": [], "boardgamedesigner": ["Theo Coster", "Ora Coster", "Theora Design"], "statistics": [], "yearpublished": "1972", "maxplayers": "4", "boardgameartist": ["Christl Burggraf", "Beni Design", "Horst Laupheimer", "Ulrike Schneiders"], "boardgamepublisher": ["Bookmark Verlag", "Ravensburger Spieleverlag GmbH", "Toys Pure"], "maxplaytime": "20", "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1015313_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "20", "boardgamecategory": ["Children's Game", "Dice", "Educational"], "description": "Quips is a game where you roll the dice and try to fill the holes in your game board with cylinders of different colours.<br/>There are two dice, one giving the colour and one giving the amount of cylinders you can take.<br/>Each player has a different game board with the same amount of holes but which require different numbers of each colour.<br/><br/>text on box<br/><br/>An exciting game of counting and matching colours.<br/><br/>This is a colour matching game with a difference!

The suit proposed by the winner of the auction is the &quot;trump&quot; for the round: once played, the tiles with this suit on will receive a bonus in points. <br/>The game is played in 3 rounds: any player receive a random set of tiles per round.
