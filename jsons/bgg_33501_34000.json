By the series&rsquo; completion, its ten maps, scaled at 10 miles per hex, will cover the area east to west from Moscow to Warsaw and north to south from southern Finland to Grozny.<br/><br/>The first three modules&mdash;entitled MOSCOW, STALINGRAD, and LENINGRAD respectively, all contain a variety of scenarios beginning in late 1941, with the fourth module, BARBAROSSA, adding the final maps and beginning the war from the jump-off date of June 22, 1941. Module #5 completes the series with a set of campaign and optional rules.<br/><br/>RUSSIA has several highly specific design goals, all of which will be kept firmly in mind as the modules in the series are under development.<br/><br/>1. The emphasis on the entire series will be on playability&mdash;and we mean that. To this end, we will always be willing, during development, to chop out detail that impedes the speed of play&mdash;and we are focusing on the major defining elements of each campaign rather than the tiny details. In addition, the game will do everything possible not only to eliminate large stacks, but to provide hexes large enough to provide for comfortable counter placement.<br/><br/>2. Play will alternate quickly between the two sides. Not only will interactivity occur while each player is conducting his moves, this is not a game in which one player moves all his units and then the other player does. Instead, play will switch constantly from one player to the other, and the game system is being designed from the ground up to eliminate downtime.<br/><br/>3. The complexity rating of the modules will never rise above a rating of 5, and even with the campaign module will not rise above 6. This is a promise. These ratings assume that EFS and OCS have complexity ratings of 8 (as a point of comparison).<br/><br/>4. The game will make it impossible, at the strategic level, for the Soviet player to simply run away from the German army. Drawing from the research in David Glantz&rsquo;s series of studies of the war, the RUSSIA series forces the Soviet player to think in terms of frequent&mdash;even continual&mdash;attacks, beginning very early after the initial attack. The Soviet player can ignore this requirement, but if he does his &ldquo;War Experience&rdquo; (as the system is known) will never increase, and he cannot win the game. The Soviet player must learn that victory in battle means something much different for him than it does for the German, and the that he must be aggressive in attack from the earliest days of the war.<br/><br/>5. The system will provide a variety of ways for each player to win, but also a number of ways for players to lose. Juggling one against the other will provide a constant challenge.<br/><br/>The first module of RUSSIA will ship in May of 2009, with each additional module appearing at roughly one-year intervals. We plan to unveil the campaign module at Monstercon in 2013.<br/><br/>"}, "33534": {"boardgamedesigner": ["BoardGameDesign.com", "A.

One side brings you to the word list, the other to the definition list.  Each word and definition are numbered so you can match them up easily.<br/><br/>As in the traditional game, players take turn finding an obscure word and announcing it to the group.  Everyone writes down a definition for the word, while the player in charge writes down the official definition.  The player in charge of the word then shuffles the definitions, reads them through once, then reads them again.  Players voting for the correct definition get 2 points, while players whose word was selected as correct by someone else get 1 point for each selection.<br/><br/>The word list is a very interesting selection of some of the more obscure words in the Oxford English Dictionary.  In the parlor game, a player has to thumb through a dictionary looking for an obscure word.  In this book, you won't recognize at least 98% of the words!  The title of the game is one such word, meaning an awkward, callow youth.  (Did you get that right?)  Some of the lovelier sounding words chosen include quemeful, poculary, bewscher, dedolence, cawquaw, wicopy, timwhisky, etc.  And did you know there's a word that has the definition, &quot;Excessive use of the letter R&quot;?<br/><br/>"}, "33578": {"boardgamedesigner": ["(Uncredited)"], "poll": [], "name": "Eendenjacht", "playingtime": "1", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": ["Acting"], "yearpublished": "2007", "usersrated": "1", "maxplayers": "4", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1350944_t.png", "average": "4", "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["Maple Toys"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1350944.png", "maxplaytime": "1", "boardgamecategory": ["Action / Dexterity", "Electronic"], "age": "0", "minplaytime": "1", "description": "From the back of the box<br/><br/><br/>     The aim of the game is to shoot down the ducks of your colour.<br/>     Put balls into your handset according to the colour of your choice.<br/>     Press the house in the center of the turntable to start the game<br/>     Shoot to knock down the ducks of your colour as they swirl around.

One then incorporates the drop-mechanism of Shogi into the game, with all the restrictions of that game. This makes the games quite different.<br/><br/>Drop Xiangqi is a pure abstract game, basically a variant of Xiangqi played with the same equipment as the standard game and easily different enough to be considered a different game. Basically the pieces in Xiangqi just have the name of the piece written on it in Chinese. So there's a definitely up and down to the piece's orientation.<br/><br/>Ownership of pieces is then marked by whoever has the writing &quot;right-side up&quot; from his point of view. In lieu of moving a piece on the board, a captured piece may be placed on the board instead with the restriction that the piece must have a legal move from its position when placed and that no two pawns owned by the same player can be on the same file.<br/><br/>How this differs from the parent game:<br/>Both are of the chess family of games an they share the game goal. Like the original, it's a pure abstract where the object is to capture the opponent's jade general. The key difference is that the complexity of the board situation does not get reduced during play. All pieces are always in play throughout the game, and so one will never have an end-game with only a few pieces involved. Exchanges don't remove pieces but rather potentially hand of vital material to one's opponent to use against you. Thus, what will be a good move in xiangqi can often be disastrous in drop-xiangqi and vice-versa. (The inspiration here is drawn from shogi.)<br/><br/>Capture the leader abstracts typically reduce to a simple end-game with the exception of shogi family of games. This game offers a complex end-game in a situation so that aplayer can't simply force exchanges to make a simple tactical game.<br/><br/>"}, "33633": {"boardgamedesigner": ["(Uncredited)"], "poll": [], "name": "The Little Engine That Could", "playingtime": "20", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": ["Pattern Recognition"], "yearpublished": "2005", "usersrated": "2", "maxplayers": "4", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic315594_t.jpg", "average": "4", "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["MasterPieces", "Penguin"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic315594.jpg", "boardgameversion": ["First edition"], "maxplaytime": "20", "boardgamecategory": ["Educational", "Novel-based", "Trains"], "age": "0", "minplaytime": "20", "description": "This game recreates the story of &quot;The Little Engine That Could.&quot;  Each player is a toy trying to get over the mountain and into the city.

Each team gets a farm animal paddle -- this paddle is passed from player to player within the team, and only the player holding the paddle at any given time may answer questions (though the whole team may influence those answers).<br/><br/>During play, teams take turns answering question cards in six categories: F.Y.I., In the Moos, You Herd It Here, Ouch, Seeing is Believing, and Heads Up.  Cards have a base point value of either 10 or 20 points, and all the 10-point cards are played before the 20-point cards.  All of the category cards feature a question about farm safety, and some also include bonus questions which can be answered for additional points if the first question is answered correctly.  Some cards require the players to look at large 11x14 photos showing farm activities and equipment.  Wild cards with general, non-farm-themed trivia may optionally be mixed in, and Daily Double cards may be added to force players to wager points on certain questions instead of using their face values.<br/><br/>The game leader decides the exact mix and number of cards, so the game can be weighted to favor particular topics and length of play can be shortened or lengthened as necessary.  Regardless of which cards are used during play, the game must be set up so that all teams get to answer the same number of questions, and the team with the most points at the end wins.<br/><br/>"}, "33645": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic282486.jpg", "poll": [], "boardgamedesigner": ["(Uncredited)"], "statistics": [], "yearpublished": "2007", "maxplayers": "4", "boardgameartist": ["Annette Tison"], "boardgamepublisher": ["K\u00e4rnan"], "maxplaytime": "20", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic282486_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "20", "boardgamecategory": ["Children's Game", "Comic Book / Strip", "Dice", "Environmental", "Novel-based", "Racing"], "description": "The Barbapapa-family are on a picnic and they come across different places where Barbapapa and Barbamama needs to transform themselves so the children can pass.

Items come in 6 colors with value from 1-5. A player's turn is a three-step affair:<br/>1) Throw a die and move your pawn forward (clockwise in a circle). When you throw 1, the reaper also moves forward.<br/>2) Do the action indicated by the space where your pawn landed. Most of the spaces are malls where you collect additional items but some spaces, like robber and recycling, take cards away. <br/>3) Gift an item to another player. You can gift only an item that matches the color of an item that an opponent already has and is of higher value.<br/><br/>The game ends when the reaper makes a full circle of eight steps. All players total the value of their cards and the player with the smallest total wins the game. That is, contrary to what the title claims, the winner is the player who has the least stuff in the end.<br/><br/>The emphasis of the game is obviously on fun. It is a family/party game which mocks the madness that takes hold of the &ldquo;civilized&rdquo; world just before any big gift-giving holiday. The items are titled such as &quot;all types of USB cables&quot; and &quot;precious jewels for pets&quot;.

This showdown determined that the Nationalist forces of Jiang Jieshi (Chiang Kai-Shek) would be driven from the mainland into exile on Taiwan. It was the culmination of 20 years of on-again-off-again civil war between the Nationalists and the Communists.<br/><br/>In 1946, the eight-year-long truce between Nationalists and Communists that had held together during the War of Resistance against Japan finally broke down. Both sides raced to seize cities and rail lines in China formerly held by the Japanese. By November, 1948, the Nationalists had suffered severe reverses in Manchuria and the north. The Communist leadership decided the time had come to move into central China, so they targeted the area around the strategically crucial city of Xuzhou, about halfway between Beijing (Peking) and Nanjing (Nanking). The result was an enormous battle of annihilation that involved over half a million fighters on each side. The Communists also mobilized as many as five million peasants to help move supplies.<br/><br/>This is very much an Against The Odds! situation: The Nationalists are well-armed with air support, artillery, road mobility, and tanks. And yet it is the Nationalists who are going up &quot;against the odds&quot;! Despite their material superiority, most Nationalist units have morale so low that &quot;defectors&quot; from their army are the main source of replacements for the Communists! The Communists are light, lean, and very well-motivated. The battle develops asymmetrically between the powerful but ponderous Nationalists and the mobile Communists.<br/><br/>Designed by Earl Dixon, Red Dragon, Blue Dragon: The Huaihai 1948-49 features a map drawn to 20 kilometers per hex, with one week turns. There are over 150 unit counters and markers. Units are mostly Nationalist &quot;Corps&quot; and Communist &quot;Columns&quot; of about 20,000-30,000 soldiers. There are also artillery regiments and tank battalions: the Communists have a few; the Nationalists have a lot more. Both sides are subdivided (as they were historically) into &quot;sub-commands.&quot; The rules cover unique aspects of this struggle: Nationalist Defections, Communist Guerrillas, the Propaganda Offensive, Communist &quot;Short Attacks&quot;, Communist Re-Education, Red Militia, Nationalist Final Defense Positions, and more. Players may discern the early origins of the ferocious Red Chinese attack against UN forces in Korea a mere two years after this battle, as well as elements of guerrilla warfare that later became familiar in Vietnam.<br/><br/>Virtually unknown in the West, this battle is quite familiar to mainland Chinese and to those on Taiwan as well. It's a fair description to call it the &quot;Gettysburg&quot; of the Chinese Civil War.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "1", "boardgameversion": ["ATO first edition", "Chinese First Edition"], "average": "7.46154", "name": "Red Dragon, Blue Dragon: The Huaihai, 1948-49", "playingtime": "0", "boardgamemechanic": ["Chit-Pull System", "Hex-and-Counter"], "age": "0", "usersrated": "13", "boardgamesubdomain": ["Wargames"], "boardgamefamily": ["Chinese Civil War", "Country: China"]}, "33665": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic589526.jpg", "poll": [], "boardgamedesigner": ["Ed Beach", "Mike Belles"], "statistics": [], "yearpublished": "2010", "maxplayers": "2", "boardgameartist": ["Nicol\u00e1s Eskubi", "Charles Kibler", "Mort K\u00fcnstler"], "boardgamepublisher": ["Multi-Man Publishing"], "maxplaytime": "180", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic589526_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "180", "boardgamecategory": ["American Civil War", "Wargame"], "boardgamehonor": ["2009 Charles S.

The variance of spelling simply reflects the non-standardization of Old Irish [Gaelic] pronunciation and therefore spelling. When pronouncing these names, one should realize that a e or i which occurs in combination with another vowel is generally not pronounced separately but indicates only that the adjacent consonant is slender, which is to say palatalized. The h is used as a mark of lenition (a kind of consonant mutation that appears in many languages) or aspiration and hence th becomes roughly pronounced like the same letters in English &quot;think&quot; and the ch as in Scottish &quot;loch&quot;. Just to add to the confusion of names, the name in modern Irish Gaelic means Chess.<br/><br/>Some scholars say the name referred not to any tafl game but in fact to a form of Latrunculorum. Others say that the name was used for the diceless form of Tawl-Bwrdd, a Welsh game believed by some to have included dice.<br/><br/>If this name does refer to a separate game, it would be a game played on 9x9 not 7x7 grid.

Namely, if the king is by the center square so that an opposing piece cannot be placed on that side of the king, the the king can be captured by being surrounded on only three sides rather than four and similarly, if the king is beside a defender, the attacker can do same thing, i.e., simply place pieces on three sides in order to capture the king. The site does mention that only the king can either land on or pass through the center square but not that attackers move first. There is also a stub article <a target='_blank' href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fitchneal' rel='nofollow'>http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fitchneal</a> on wikipedia which concurs on the initial placement of pieces.

It notes however that the game is properly called merely Gwyddbwyll, the longer name meaning merely &quot;Celtic Gwyddbwyll&quot;.

These rare tulips have always been quite expensive, even to this day.

During this time, the bubonic plague was killing off 1 out of every 7 people per year, so the common man saw little reason not to invest foolishly with a chance of making a substantial profit. These conditions created a situation where the prices of tulips skyrocketed by the day, until the prices hit a point that could not be sustained. The wily investors knew when to sell off, so those who profited most are those who sold just as the market started to turn sour.<br/><br/>You are playing one of those wily investors.

From that small beginning, the Empire ruthlessly expanded, enslaving or exiling all races that were a threat to their dominion. Recently, the Empire has suffered revolts from conquered races, and on the barren galactic rim, the exiled races gather their forces to strike at the weakened Empire. As the Empire's might and influence wane, a new era is dawning. Which new race will ascend to power?<br/><br/>Omega Centauri is a game of galactic empire building for 2 to 4 players. The play map is made up of sector tiles, and at the beginning of the game the majority of the map is Empire-controlled resource sectors. A variety of map layouts are included and the size of the map depends on the number of players. During each round of play, you have the opportunity to perform three of five possible actions:<br/><br/><br/>     Assemble (place your fleets into sectors with shipyards)<br/>     Build (build monuments, construct shipyards, and erect planetary defenses)<br/>     Move (move fleets into a sector or out of a sector)<br/>     Politics (gain resources or increase your fleet capacity)<br/>     Research (select an available technology)<br/><br/><br/>In the base game, players take turns each round selecting and executing one action at a time until each player has taken three actions, then a new round begins. The base game offers a compelling mix of strategic planning and tactical play, as players must balance their long term goals for development and for technology acquisition with the need to take advantage of the opportunities that arise during action selection.  The base game provides a streamlined 4x experience that can be completed in about an hour.<br/><br/>The advanced game differs from the base game in several important respects. First, the advanced game introduces improved technologies, racial powers, and other elements to provide a more complex and flavorful gaming experience. It also requires players to select all three of their actions (and the order that they will be performed in) at the start of every round. Thus, to succeed, you must carefully plan your turn, anticipate your opponents' actions, and more successfully execute your overall strategy. Reserve Fleet Actions are added, giving an important boost and a use for spare fleets, through these (and spending valuable resources) players can take an extra action. Finally, through the Politics Action, the full game allows players to select goals that award victory points at the end of the game based upon how well the player has carried out a specific agenda. The full game provides an epic 4x experience in around two hours with variable powers, advanced technologies, and numerous paths to victory.<br/><br/>Throughout the game, you will be compelled to make important decisions regarding how to advance your civilization: Will you focus on obtaining technological or cultural superiority, or will you build an invincible armada to crush those who stand in your way?

In keeping with the pace of the sport of hockey this game uses double-sided Fast Action Cards (FAC) to move the game right along.<br/><br/>From the first face off players will perform on the ice like no other simulation out there.  Skater&rsquo;s cards are broken down with four separate offensive columns based on whether your team is at even strength, in the power play, shorthanded or the column for rebounds and great feed passes.  These cards don&rsquo;t just tell you whether a player takes a shot but the quality of the shot as well.  Some guys will be shooting at the twine with quality shots most of the time while others will just be putting the puck towards the net.  The slick-passing skaters are not left out here as a good play maker on the ice can set up much higher shooting opportunities.   Players are also rated on the frequency of giving away the puck.  In ITC a bone-headed pass that loses the puck isn&rsquo;t just a turnover it can be a chance for a breakaway for the opposition.<br/><br/>Defense is covered equally in depth with four separate defensive ratings to set players apart.  The ability to takeaway the puck, block shots, check players off the puck and a general defensive ability all can force the action of the offense.  You will be able to &ldquo;see&rdquo; a great defensive play stop a would be shot.  Blocking a shot or forcing a shot wide with a defensive stop can be a goal saver.  Controlling loose pucks can be a real game turner in ITC with this ability captured in the ratings as well.<br/><br/>No hockey game would be complete without the ability to capture the penalty aspect.  In ITC the players are not just rated for penalty frequency but the type as well.  Whether it be a minor, major or misconduct you will know when it happens.  If a fight breaks out you will watch the two combatants head to the box.  When a minor is called you will get an actual penalty name (elbowing, holding, etc) for added flavor.<br/><br/>The goalies are created with the ability to stop shots in the six different shooting categories.  You will be crushed to watch a weak slapshot trickle through for a goal but be ecstatic watching your goalie thwart an excellent scoring opportunity.  In ITC the  ability of the goalie to control the action after a shot is also taken into consideration.  You will see your goalie simply give up a rebound shot, hold the puck or be able to pass it off to a teammate.<br/><br/>If strategy is your game ITC delivers with a simple and unobtrusive way to handle your coaching choices.  If you push more forecheckers up the ice for better scoring chances you are leaving yourself open on the back end.  It is your choice how to play it.<br/><br/>"}, "33824": {"boardgamedesigner": ["Frank Chadwick"], "poll": [], "name": "Command Decision: Stars and Stripes Forever", "playingtime": "240", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": ["Dice Rolling", "Simulation"], "yearpublished": "2007", "boardgameexpansion": [], "usersrated": "3", "boardgamesubdomain": ["Wargames"], "maxplayers": "2", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic285776_t.jpg", "average": "7.46667", "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["Test of Battle Games"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic285776.jpg", "maxplaytime": "240", "boardgamecategory": ["Book", "Expansion for Base-game", "Miniatures", "Wargame", "World War II"], "age": "0", "minplaytime": "240", "description": "An army book for Command Decision: Test of Battle.

It would be a dangerous and unprecedented project &ndash; never before had oil drilling taken place so far from land. But the size of the deposits, and the vast demand from an oil-dependent and increasingly weak U.S. economy, made the hidden riches irresistible. The United States government, brushing aside international objections that the drilling would take place in neutral waters, staked its claim and sent out a task force of tankers loaded with the equipment to build an oil rig the size of a city.<br/><br/>They found a city already there.<br/><br/>Divers and probes reported a sprawling, domed metropolis on the ocean floor, directly above the oil deposits. Glittering palaces of gold and streets of seashells filled with men and women who breathed variously air and water, and wore rich, colourful robes. Carefully tended farms of kelp and other sea life stretching for miles. Either these people &ndash; quickly dubbed &ldquo;Atlanteans&rdquo; by a not-very-imaginative world press, despite the location of their city &ndash; were oblivious to the oil deposits just below them, or they were already tapping into them.<br/><br/>Attempts to communicate with the Atlanteans failed &ndash; they spoke a language unknown on any continent. Linguists and anthropologists chafed to study them, but the United States government had other priorities. Learning their language would take years and would only be a prelude to negotiations that might take even longer and still go nowhere.<br/><br/>Drilling was to begin immediately in the kelp farms outside the city dome. Negotiations and studies could take place once the oil was secured. Naval forces arrived on the scene to herd the surprised farmers behind the walls of their city while underwater engineers began construction of the foundation for the rig. The communications of the Atlanteans, increasingly insistent, could not be translated, and so were ignored.<br/><br/>Eventually, the Atlanteans attacked. Riding giant seahorses and wielding strange weapons, supported by schools of sharks, dolphins, and other sea life, the Atlanteans drove the divers off their lands in brief, bloody raids.<br/><br/>The President wasted no time. An act of aggression had been committed against American citizens in American-held waters. It was war. A nuclear submarine would breach the walls of the city and frogmen would secure drilling positions. Forces marshaled &ndash; and struck.<br/><br/>This game simulates the battle between the United States navy and the forces of the so-called city of Atlantis. The navy has the advantages of overwhelming firepower and ranged weapons, Atlantis of speed and the ability to use the environment. The navy player&rsquo;s objective is to break through the walls of Atlantis and occupy the city, a military victory that would allow drilling to commence. The Atlantis player&rsquo;s objective is to destroy the nuclear submarine, repelling the navy&rsquo;s first attack and granting them time to summon an army of sea creatures too vast even for the modern military power of the United States to overcome.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": ["First edition"], "name": "Siege of Atlantis", "playingtime": "60", "boardgamemechanic": ["Hex-and-Counter"], "average": "6", "usersrated": "1", "boardgamesubdomain": ["Wargames"], "boardgamefamily": ["Atlantis"]}, "33850": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic320951.jpg", "poll": [], "boardgamedesigner": ["Paul Rohrbaugh"], "statistics": [], "yearpublished": "2008", "maxplayers": "2", "boardgameartist": ["Craig Grando"], "boardgamepublisher": ["Against the Odds", "LPS, Inc."], "maxplaytime": "120", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic320951_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "120", "boardgamecategory": ["Wargame", "World War II"], "description": "(from ATO website)<br/><br/>Operation Cartwheel was a miniaturized version of Allied Grand Strategy in the Pacific&mdash;a multi-pronged advance aimed to make it difficult for the Japanese to focus their responses... a jumping from air base to potential-next-airbase. (MacArthur called it, &ldquo;Advancing the bomber line.&rdquo;) And, most of all, the novel concept that not every Japanese stronghold needed to be attacked at all.<br/><br/>Some 13 different invasions or operations were included, with flexibility for adjusting both timing and target as the situation demanded. In fact, the original goal of Cartwheel (called &ldquo;Elkton&rdquo; when first proposed) was the capture of Rabaul. After much discussion in the highest levels (including the Combined Chiefs of Staff, Roosevelt, and Churchill), and overruling MacCarther&rsquo;s own objections, Cartwheel&rsquo;s final objectives shifted to the Admiralty Islands, bypassing Rabaul and setting the stage for the invasion of the Philippines.<br/><br/>Operation Cartwheel eventually included the Battle of the Bismarck Sea, the death of Yamamoto, Bougainville, multiple parachute drops, a Japanese counter-invasion, and the leap-frogging strategy up New Guinea. It involved the top commanders on both sides, sometimes working in close harmony and sometimes at ends. (The Japanese army and navy had conflicting concepts of how to defend the area and each pursued their own ideas!)<br/><br/>With 284 5/8&quot; counters and a 22 x 34 inch map (each hex representing about 100 miles) Operation Cartwheel integrates separate ground, naval, and air games.

In addition to resource and strategic management, you also manage the details of your units&rsquo; Formations, Fatigue, Damage Levels, Rank, Ammunition, etc. The combat dynamics revolve around a richly detailed and heavily researched simulation of the four primary weapon systems of ancient warfare: Light Infantry, Heavy Infantry, Light Cavalry and Heavy Cavalry. Learning how to use each unit to maximum effectiveness is paramount to achieving victory. Additionally, unique fantasy units, including flying units, as well as a variety of spells from Enchantments, Curses, and Area of Effect are included. The game comes with highly detailed Record Sheets customized to each Prince&rsquo;s units in order to track the various in-game details.<br/><br/>Though random events add flavor to the game, luck has been minimized to emphasize strategy and tactics. Battles do not hinge on the outcome of a die roll, but rather reward planning and superior positioning. A modular game board provides new terrain configurations every time you play, and terrain plays a key element in how you develop your strategy and tactics as terrain effects are customized for each unit. Each Prince has their own unique and highly detailed handbook describing each of their unit types in great detail, and each unit is further broken down into easy-to-reference sections within the handbooks. Unlike many games where you wait for another player to complete their turn before taking your own, this game is designed to keep everyone equally involved during all aspects of play, including the Movement and Attack phases. Though not recommended for the casual gamer, Prince of Chaos: Battle for Tae Orn provides a robust challenge for anyone who desires to plumb the depths and details of ancient fantasy warfare.<br/><br/>"}, "33858": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic289008.jpg", "poll": [], "boardgamedesigner": ["Ed Teixeira"], "statistics": [], "yearpublished": "2008", "maxplayers": "0", "boardgamepublisher": ["Two Hour Wargames (THW Game Design)"], "maxplaytime": "120", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic289008_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "120", "boardgamecategory": ["Dice", "Expansion for Base-game", "Miniatures", "Print & Play", "Science Fiction", "Wargame"], "description": "Under A Hishen Sky will work well using only the 5150 rules but if you also have Infestation, our first scenario book, then you can use those mechanics as well.

In addition, each player chooses one of five alignments (moderate or conservative Republican, Independent, moderate or liberal Democrat), and secretly chooses up to 6 of the 15 available issues. The 30 issue tiles are shuffled and 3 placed randomly on each side of the board (region): North, East, South and West. The track around the board has a variety of plus or minus spaces, but six out of 10 spaces on each side are blank and trigger auctions.<br/><br/>The player landing on the space can put any unclaimed state in his current region up for auction. Bids are secret and paid in Political Capital (PC), the game&rsquo;s currency, and players pay their bids whether they win or lose the auction! After their bids are revealed, they are modified by regional issue matches (1/3 = 5 PC; 2/3 = 10 PC; 3/3 = 20 PC) and any card bonuses. Finally, all players roll dice that depend on their affiliations and the state&rsquo;s preference. (A pink state gives 3 extra D6 to a moderate democrat, 2D6 to a liberal democrat, 1D6 to an Independent, and nothing to Republicans.) The highest total then wins the auction.<br/><br/>While issues help in some states, taking fewer stands allows a player to collect more PC for each circuit of the board. As soon as a Republican and Democratic candidate reach 5 states with 50+ electoral votes, they win the party nomination, and other players in the party either drop out or become independents. Three scenarios are available: full campaign to electoral vote majority; most electoral votes after one time through the Momentum card deck; or a short game won by the first player to win at least one state in every region with at least 50 electoral votes.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": ["First Edition"], "age": "0", "name": "Landslide!", "playingtime": "60", "boardgamemechanic": ["Auction/Bidding", "Roll / Spin and Move", "Voting"], "average": "5", "usersrated": "5", "boardgamefamily": ["Political: Elections"]}, "33896": {"boardgamedesigner": ["(Uncredited)"], "poll": [], "name": "The Flight To Paris", "playingtime": "0", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": ["Roll / Spin and Move"], "yearpublished": "1927", "usersrated": "1", "boardgamefamily": ["Celebrities: Charles Lindbergh", "Cities: Paris (France)"], "maxplayers": "2", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1953458_t.jpg", "average": "7", "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["Milton Bradley"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1953458.jpg", "boardgameversion": ["First edition"], "maxplaytime": "0", "boardgamecategory": ["Aviation / Flight", "Transportation"], "age": "0", "minplaytime": "0", "description": "Published right after Charles Lindbergh's flight, the object is to get your &quot;AEROPLANE&quot; from New York to Paris.<br/>Game #4010<br/><br/>"}, "33897": {"boardgamedesigner": ["Michael Schoessow"], "poll": [], "name": "Pond", "playingtime": "30", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": ["Trick-taking"], "yearpublished": "2002", "usersrated": "1", "maxplayers": "4", "boardgamefamily": ["Traditional Card Games"], "average": "8", "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["(Web published)"], "maxplaytime": "30", "boardgamecategory": ["Card Game"], "age": "0", "minplaytime": "30", "description": "This is a two player trick taking game by Michael Schoessow (who also designed the award-winning piecepack/Ice House game Alien City) that can also be played with four players by adding an additional deck of cards and playing in partners.<br/><br/>First each player draws for a poison suit, cards are dealt and then each player secretly selects their profit ranks.

Whenever a match day is reached, matches will be played. The teams consist of player cards that every manager will put into formation before the games. Based on these formations, dice will then decide the outcome. As the season goes by, players can be sold and bought, contracts can be extended, injuries and suspensions may appear, players may go on international duties, and you may have to fight against bankruptcy, or end up swimming in money. But remember, money is far from everything - winning will always be about football.<br/><br/>The game contains a hundred unique player cards of different nationalities, strengths and positions. Furthermore there are international cup cards, and action/strategy cards that can be used to influence matches.<br/><br/>The game can be played by 2 to 4 people, but was mainly designed for 4 players.

It was, and was perhaps too simple. With only air and surface elements represented, it was a clean and fast game of modern naval combat, but not the full story.
