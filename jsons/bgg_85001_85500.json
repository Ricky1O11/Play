No lucky dice here, as they are used as tokens in this game. The special thing about the game is, that in order to move the dice forward, they are tilted over their edges. There are two game variants: In the first variant, a player&rsquo;s dice must reach the opposite end of the board first. If two dice of the opposing players are colliding, the dice showing the lower number has to be removed from the board. The second game variant resembles Halma but is more demanding. Players can hop their dice over any other dice in a straight line attempting to get as many of their own dice as possible to the opposite baseline of the board. The game ends if one player manages to completely occupy the other player&rsquo;s baseline. However, the player who first manages to do so, needn&rsquo;t be the winner of the game! The winner is determined by adding up each player&rsquo;s eye number of dice already on the opposite baseline. Though players will need to make some minor tactical considerations during play, CUBLINO is definitely a great fun to play game. It is a family game for adults and children of 5 years and older.

The Battle of Tours is a fast-playing, fun game of low complexity. To that end, much detail has been either omitted or factored into the overall mechanics. We have tried to provide as much period flavor and historical accuracy as we can, within that focus. The game should take about two hours to play to conclusion, about 50% more the first time.<br/><br/>Now, Turning Point Simulations gives you the chance to determine the future of France and Western Europe, with a tactical system which highlights the different strengths and weaknesses of both sides. For the Muslims, you&rsquo;ll find them lightly armored, cavalry heavy, and prone to piecemeal attacking by tribes. The Frankish army is a century before Charlemagne, caught in transition from Roman heavy infantry tactics and the birth of armored knights. It is mobility versus defense, Moorish spears versus Frankish long swords. And you make the decisions.<br/><br/>The Battle of Tours includes 100 counters that capture the widely varying weapons systems at this battle. You&rsquo;ll find both light and heavy infantry, light and heavy cavalry, and (a few) mounted archers. But beyond unit types, you&rsquo;ll command troops who actually fight &quot;differently&quot; from each other. Muslim units are activated by &quot;tribes,&quot; as a collection of varied unit types that all happen to move together. Frankish units activate by type&mdash;all the heavy infantry, all the light infantry, all the cavalry. The difference means the two armies &quot;feel&quot; different to command. Players designate basic &quot;orders&quot; by selecting counters, then find out who obeys. The chaos and lack of real control conveys an historic chaos that really captures the flavor of this battle, where failure can mean slaughter, but victory can mean losing control, as troops turn from soldiers to looters.  You can be up one turn and down the next. Hang on for the ride.<br/><br/>Part of the TPS &quot;Decisive Battles&quot; series<br/>That means straightforward rules, key insights into the history behind the game, and designs aimed at one-session conclusions and high replay value. With shifting Initiative and uncertain activations, no two Tours games will play the same.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": {"69624": "English first edition"}, "age": "0", "name": "The Battle of Tours, 732 A.D.", "playingtime": "120", "boardgamemechanic": {"2057": "Chit-Pull System"}, "average": "6.56429", "usersrated": "28", "boardgamefamily": {"4576": "Men of Iron Series"}}, "85077": {"boardgamedesigner": {"68628": {"name": "W.

It involved thousands of ships, stretched over hundreds of miles of ocean, and involved hundreds of convoy battles and single-ship encounters. During the struggle advantage switched back and forth between the U-boats and Allies as new weapons, tactics, and countermeasures were developed and implemented.<br/><br/>U-Boat Leader takes the Leader series to new depths, letting players control a group of U-boats on missions in the Atlantic. The core system of the game will be familiar to players of other Leader games, allowing them to quickly get into the game.<br/><br/>A major portion of the game is determining where to send your submarines. Do you concentrate your submarines in one or two areas to form wolfpacks or spread them out in the shipping lanes to increase the chances of finding contacts, or do you send them on special missions (such as mine-laying)? You can also spend Special Operations Points to support your submarines by adding search planes to help find enemy ships or by sending supply ships and subs (Milk Cows) to extend the endurance of the submarines. During longer campaigns you need to manage the U-boat patrol rotation to keep subs on station.<br/><br/>When a patrolling U-boat comes into contact with an enemy force it can call other boats in the same patrol zone to form a wolfpack or attack alone. The action then shifts to the tactical display where the U-boats try to close with and attack merchants while avoiding the escorting warships. When an attack starts you will have an idea of the number and general type of ships in the group, but you have to close with the ships to actually identify the ships.<br/><br/>U-Boat Leader includes the following type of U-boats: <br/>Type IIB/C coastal submarines <br/>Type VII A/B/C Atlantic submarines<br/>Type IX A/B/C long-range submarines<br/>Type XXI Elektro-boat<br/><br/>U-Boat Leader includes four campaigns covering different stages of the Battle of the Atlantic:<br/><br/>The Battle Begins: covering operations at the start of World War II to about mid-1940.<br/><br/>The Happy Time: covering the period from mid-1940 to mid-1941 when the U-boats and wolfpacks dominated the seas.<br/><br/>Operation Drumbeat: covering operations off the American coast and in the Caribbean in early 1942.<br/><br/>The Hunted: covering the time period when the tide starts to turn against the U-boats.<br/><br/>-Dan Verssen Games<br/><br/>Other Leader series games by Dan Verssen<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "1", "boardgameversion": {"69698": "First edition"}, "average": "6.93013", "name": "U-Boat Leader", "playingtime": "90", "boardgamemechanic": {"2041": "Card Drafting"}, "age": "12", "usersrated": "226", "boardgameaccessory": {"204654": "U-Boat Leader and GATO Leader: Ship Miniatures & Battle Board!"}, "boardgamesubdomain": {"4664": "Wargames"}, "boardgamefamily": {"3268": "Leader Series"}}, "85109": {"statistics": {}, "name": "Games International (Issue 5 \u2013 May 1989)", "rpgproducer": {"14039": "Paul Mason"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic825959.jpg", "usersrated": "1", "average": "10", "rpgissue": {"6981": "Games International"}, "rpgissuearticle": {"17856": "Cyberpunk Special Feature"}, "rpg": {"244": "Advanced Dungeons & Dragons (2nd Edition)"}, "rpgissueversion": {"69699": "Issue 5"}, "poll": {}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic825959_t.jpg", "description": "Issue 5 of Games International<br/><br/><br/>Contents<br/><br/>Cover &ndash; First Past the Post<br/><br/>Up Front &ndash; Editorial<br/>Review Section<br/><br/>General Games Reviews;<br/><br/>    First Past the Post<br/>    Circus Imperium<br/>    Deal Me In<br/>    Pole Position<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Britannia &ndash; the ABC guide to major invasion (see Web Links below)<br/>R.I.P. &ndash; into the fast lane with Niki Lauder's Formel Eins<br/>Strategy Seminar &ndash; opening moves in Die Macher (see Web Links below)<br/>Owzat! &ndash; Wicketz creator Alf Compton interviewed<br/>Palace of Varieties &ndash; variants for popular games<br/>Viva Las Vegas &ndash; Total Confusion and GAMA fair photo report<br/>The Twilight Zone &ndash; sports games fanzines<br/>Consumer Guide &ndash; quick summary for eager punters<br/>Desert Island Games &ndash; with castaway Philip Murphy<br/>Sniper &ndash; Gaming gossip from around the world<br/>News<br/><br/>Wargame Reviews;<br/><br/>    Sniper!

In the fall of 1942, the very experienced German army was pushing further into the Soviet Union despite the serious setback inflicted on it by the Soviet winter offensive in December 1941. The Germans were now fighting a rebuilding Soviet army composed of raw recruits and some veteran units that had survived, and learned from, the battlefield disasters suffered by the Russians in 1941.<br/><br/>The German Sixth Army approached the outskirts of Stalingrad in September 1942 a little over two months into its summer offensive. Although his bombers had destroyed the city's industrial and transportation capacity in August, Hitler ordered the capture of Stalin's city. In Objective: Stalingrad, the German player starts with only sixteen regiments to accomplish this mission. The means to German victory is in the ground-attack Stukas and independent battalions of artillery, combat engineers, anti-aircraft (flak), and assault guns (StuGs) that can be attached to the regiments to devise the best tactical mix of forces to conquer Stalin's city.<br/><br/>While the German regiments were steadily reduced in strength and exhausted to impotence, dozens of untested, conscript Soviet rifle regiments and brigades were obliterated in the house-to-house fighting. Cards will provide crucial influential factors such as snipers, leader initiative, mine dogs, armored trains, and river flotilla warships.<br/><br/>In Objective: Stalingrad the German player commands up to twenty regiments of infantry, including panzer grenadier infantry, along with numerous independent units. There are four scenarios representing each of the major attacks launched by the Germans between 13 September and 11 November. There is also a multi-player campaign game. The smaller scenarios are designed to be played in three to four hours. (For a different approach, see Stalingrad: Verdun on the Volga. In VoV the German player can refight the four major historical attacks using up to nine primary maneuver units &ndash; divisions &ndash; at an operational level. The same scenario at that level can be finished in one to two hours.)<br/><br/>Objective: Stalingrad is about tactical choices for both the German and Soviet players. If you never had time to play Dana Lombardy's tactical company-level &quot;monster&quot; game Streets of Stalingrad, OS enables you to refight one of the most important battles of World War II in far less time.<br/><br/>"}, "85132": {"boardgamedesigner": {"7310": {"name": "Michael Renegar"}}, "average": "0", "poll": {}, "name": "Modern Havok", "playingtime": "120", "minplayers": "1", "boardgamemechanic": {"2072": "Dice Rolling"}, "yearpublished": "2010", "usersrated": "0", "maxplayers": "5", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic912051_t.png", "boardgameartist": {"17720": "Edward Wedig"}, "statistics": {}, "boardgamepublisher": {"4": {"name": "(Self-Published)"}}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic912051.png", "boardgameversion": {"69757": "Moden Havok"}, "maxplaytime": "120", "boardgamecategory": {"1047": {"name": "Miniatures"}}, "age": "10", "minplaytime": "120", "description": "&quot;Well, Punk?

Designed to go along with the accompanying 28mm Fantasy Ranges the game features players maneuvering large blocks of miniature soldiers around the battlefield in search of victory.<br/><br/>Kings of War is a new concept for mass battle miniature wargaming &mdash; a game that is both easy to learn and fast to play! With few and simple rules, there is little to get in the way of the fun and slaughter. Kings of War is a challenging game of strategy, where you can pit your wits against your opponent without devoting half of your brain power to remember a plethora of convoluted rules.<br/><br/>And that&rsquo;s not all, the innovative turn structure allows you to play Kings of War using a time-keeping tool (like a stopwatch or a chess clock) to time your moves. As the seconds tick away, the pressure and excitement this adds makes 'Kings of War' unlike any other large-scale wargame you&rsquo;ve ever played before.<br/><br/>Units are given simple ratings such as 'Melee Attack', 'Defense' and 'Nerve' and then augmented with special abilities that characterize the different fantasy races that inhabit the world.

Abbreviated rules are downloadable from Mantic's website, and extracts (about 70%) from the full army lists for all factions are also available for download, called &quot;starter lists&quot;.

Kirby is able to walk, swim, and fly throughout a variety of levels, using several allies and enemy powers in order to reach the goal at the end of each level. However, a variety of obstacles lie in his path. These obstacles range from pits to enemies. If Kirby touches an enemy or is hit by an enemy's attack, Kirby will lose one bar of health (out of six total health points).<br/><br/>Kirby's basic abilities include running, jumping, flight, swimming, and inhaling. Flight involves inhaling air (UP button), followed with the press of the jump button which will make Kirby fly. By continuously pushing the jump button, Kirby can reach any height (unless something prevents him from reaching that height). At any time when Kirby has inhaled air, he can exhale by either landing on the ground or you can also release it yourself. When the air is released, Kirby will exhale a puff of air, which can be used to damage enemies or destroy blocks.<br/><br/>Inhaling objects, enemies, and food is the trademark ability of Kirby's. To inhale anything, the player must hold down the B button. Kirby can then indefinitely inhale, and if an enemy, object, or food is in range, Kirby will eat it. When food is inhaled, it is automatically swallowed and will heal Kirby if he has any damage. When Kirby inhales an enemy or object, it remains in his mouth. At this point, Kirby can shoot them out as a star (causing damage to anything in its path), or simply swallow them. When certain enemies are swallowed, Kirby will gain their ability, such as ice breath or the ability to turn into stone.<br/><br/>Kirby's Dream Land 2 introduces three new allies to aide him in his adventure: Rick the Hamster, who allows Kirby to ride on his back, runs faster, and doesn't slip on ice; Coo the Owl, who can carry Kirby and fly through harsh winds and allows Kirby to inhale while flying; and Kine the Ocean Sunfish, who can carry Kirby in his mouth and swim through waters with ease even against currents (although he performs poorly on land), and with whom Kirby can inhale underwater. Whenever Kirby is aided by an animal friend, his current power is altered. For example, if Kirby has the Spark ability, riding on Rick will change it to the Beam attack from Kirby's Adventure.<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;Kirby's Dream Land 2,&quot; available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "85221": {"statistics": {}, "name": "Dream Chronicles: The Book of Air", "videogamemode": {"2149": "Single-Player"}, "videogameversion": {"69934": "Macintosh Downloadable edition"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1285244.jpg", "videogameseries": {"7993": "Dream Chronicles: Lyra's Destiny"}, "videogametheme": {"2148": "Fantasy"}, "videogamegenre": {"2152": "Adventure"}, "average": "7", "videogamefranchise": {"7992": "Dream Chronicles"}, "videogameplatform": {"4729": "Macintosh"}, "usersrated": "2", "poll": {}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1285244_t.jpg", "description": "User Summary<br/><br/>Dream Chronicles: The Book of Air is the fourth book in the Dream Chronicles franchise and the start of the Lyra&rsquo;s Destiny trilogy.

Compared to other sci-fi settings, the native technology has developed along unpredictable lines. The neat delineations of D20 Future's Progress Levels don't apply to America, circa 2107 CE. Humanity is a new galactic power, and shelters under the protective arm of our Stonecutter allies. Humanity has faster than light travel, and intra-system travel is an unremarkable part of 22nd Century life, but the expected side technology of mechanical teleportation has never materialized.<br/><br/>The battlefield is dominated by agile and man-sized suits of powered armor, full conversion cyborgs are a distinct minority, and Otherverse America's soldiers wield a devastating array of energy weapons and rail guns. Older weapons aren't forgotten; insurgents and impoverished militaries across the world still carry the dependable and all but idiot proof AK-47, and the Colt 1911 will soon reach its second century of military service. Lifer pilots in heavily modified Gulfstreams slip past the Choicer radar net, while forest-living Lifer zealots called &quot;Untainted&quot; hunt and kill with bow and arrow, and switch to carbon fiber knives for close in work. Choicer combat volunteers carry a laser pistol in one hand and an obsidian athame in the other.<br/><br/>Civilian technology is similarly schizophrenic. Dreamscape gives users access to the worldwide Mesh while they sleep and dream, while commercial genetic engineering gives ordinary men and women abilities that would be considered superhuman in earlier eras. Hovercraft propelled by machinetelekinesis share the roadways with sixty year old ground cars and bicycles. Privacy is a long forgotten myth, with only the comparatively low tech Lifer Enclaves offering any relief from the omnipresent security culture.<br/><br/>Computer technology is more advanced than in many sci-fi settings, and while AI is common, fully sentient androids are virtually non existent. Robotics remains limited to industrial fabrication and semi-autonomous military drones. &quot;Dumb AI&quot; designed for expertise in a single field are omnipresent, and are included as a standard feature in most commercial electronics. Your entertainment console or palmtop computer can quickly learn your preferences, your clothes can adjust color and style to suit your mood, and your vehicle can easily drive itself while you nap. More advanced AI have become humanity's advisors: the Covenant has created an entire pantheon of altruistic AI gods and goddesses, while the mysterious Nuremberg Consciousness manipulates the Lifer nation from the shadows.<br/><br/>The Otherverse Armory is a compilation of the military and civilian technology that has appeared in several Otherverse America sourcebooks.

A ported version for the handheld Sega Game Gear was released a year later.<br/><br/>The eponymous protagonist of the story is &quot;Greendog&quot;, the player character, a laid back, cool surfer and skater with a mop of bleached blonde hair. He has surfed most of the biggest waves around, including off the coast of Australia, California and in the Mediterranean, and is always in search of the biggest waves which will give him the biggest thrill and he cares for little else in life. He has numerous contraptions and toys, such as a gyrocopter, inline skates, a skateboard and an antique frisbee which could be very dangerous in the wrong hands. He doesn't say much except &quot;dude&quot; and &quot;cool&quot;.<br/><br/>One day, while surfing in the Caribbean Sea off the coast of the Grenada islands, Greendog is knocked off his surf board by the biggest freak wave he has ever seen, and falls unconscious in the sea. When he wakes on the beach, he is apparently in another version of our world, or at least some form of very vivid dreamworld, and a mysterious and apparently magical golden pendant is tied around his neck and he is unable to remove it. A beautiful, buxom blonde woman in a red bikini appears and explains to Greendog that the pendant is of Aztec origin and carries a terrible curse; it dooms the wearer to be attacked by animals and wild primeval creatures and, worst of all, will prohibit surfing.<br/><br/>The only way that Greendog can lift the curse is to travel to a lost Aztec civilization and track down six pieces of a sacred Aztec treasure which were scattered across the Caribbean Islands, so that the pieces can be put back together, and ultimately so that Greendog can remove both the curse and the pendant. However, nobody knows exactly where the pieces of the treasure are.<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;Greendog&quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "85239": {"poll": {}, "name": "Quardiddl Cards", "playingtime": "15", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": {"2003": "Rock-Paper-Scissors"}, "yearpublished": "2006", "usersrated": "0", "boardgamefamily": {"6040": "CCGs (Collectible Card Games)"}, "maxplayers": "0", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1194481_t.jpg", "average": "0", "statistics": {}, "boardgamepublisher": {"10062": {"name": "Depesche"}}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1194481.jpg", "boardgameversion": {"69979": "Depesche edition"}, "maxplaytime": "15", "boardgamecategory": {"1002": {"name": "Card Game"}}, "age": "4", "minplaytime": "15", "description": "A collectible card game based on cartoon character Diddl and his friends.

But lately reports of sightings of Nessie have been increasing.<br/><br/>&quot;Such reports naturally have drawn such reporters as the attractive Belinda Viewing from New York, the half-Belgian Claude McMirror, the clever Filosa Sharp, as well as her Londoner competitor Jack Nesstee, and even Nils the Blitzen from Denmark to the Loch.  Equipped with the most modern equipment and techniques, these daring reporters have traveled to Scotland, in order to capture the elusive Nessie on film for their newspapers.<br/><br/>&quot;But the 5 will experience some surprises . . .&quot;<br/><br/>In Loch Ness, players compete to get pictures of Nessie.  In turn order, players place or move their photographers on the board as they try to anticipate the movement of the Loch Ness monster.  The movement of the monster is determined randomly by drawing move cards from the first three players, each card having a number from 1 to 5.  The cards are not revealed until after the photographers have been placed.  When they are revealed, the monster moves the total number of spaces and players score points based on the value of their photographers placed in the area where Nessie emerged.  In addition, the players whose photographers were directly in front of Nessie select photo cards that will award points at the end of the game, especially if sets are created.<br/><br/>Beginning in the second round, players will select an action space each round that gives them a unique power to use for for the round.  Placement also gets more challenging from the second round onward as a player is required to move a photographer, perhaps opening up spots for opponents.  Each round, some of the players do have a limited knowledge of how Nessie will move each round.  When a player draws a movement card before positioning his photographers, he is allowed to look at it, giving him one-third of the movement for that round.  However, movement varies tremendously and only three players draw movement cards each round.<br/><br/>The game ends after the round in which a mini Nessie figure reaches space 65 on the score track.  This figure moves the same number of spaces as the main Nessie figure in the game board each round.  The player with the most points, scored during the game and from the photo cards at the end, wins the game.  The rules include two optional variants that can be added individually or together with the base game.<br/><br/>Not to be confused with the 2010 Walter Obert game with the same theme, Loch Ness.<br/><br/>"}, "85244": {"rpg": {"7999": "Hibernia"}, "statistics": {}, "name": "Hibernia", "rpgproducer": {"36626": "Philippe Tromeur"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2375291.png", "usersrated": "0", "rpgitemversion": {"69989": "PDF Version (copine)"}, "average": "0", "rpggenre": {"159": "Fantasy (Arthurian)"}, "rpgcategory": {"2083": "Core Rules (min needed to play)"}, "poll": {}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2375291_t.png", "description": "From the Game's Introduction:<br/><br/>Artus de Bretagne (Uther Pendragon) a dirig&eacute; avec succ&egrave;s l'invasion d'Hibernia (Irlande) par des myriades de l&eacute;gionnaires de toutes les provinces du Empire Romain, &agrave; l'aide du s&eacute;nateur Myrdhin et du g&eacute;n&eacute;ral Galaad.<br/><br/>Une r&eacute;bellion irlandaise s'est organis&eacute;e autour du chr&eacute;tien breton Maewyn Succat, qui sera connu sous le nom de Saint Padraig...<br/><br/><br/>User Translation from French:<br/><br/>Arthur of Britain (Uther Pendragon) has successfully led the invasion of Hibernia (Ireland) by a myriad of legionnaires of all the provinces of the Roman Empire, with the help of Senator Myrddin and General Galahad.<br/><br/>An Irish rebellion has been organised around the Christian Briton, Maewyn Succat, who will be known by the name Saint Padraig...<br/><br/>"}, "85245": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic953205.jpg", "poll": {}, "boardgamedesigner": {"3612": {"name": "Thomas Daum"}}, "statistics": {}, "yearpublished": "2010", "maxplayers": "4", "boardgameartist": {"7387": "Rolf Vogt"}, "boardgamepublisher": {"265": {"name": "Drei Magier Spiele"}}, "maxplaytime": "25", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic953205_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "20", "boardgamecategory": {"1032": {"name": "Action / Dexterity"}}, "boardgamehonor": {"12739": "2011 Kinderspielexperten \"5-to-9-year-olds\" Nominee"}, "description": "Kaboom!

These cards are aranged in a square. Then, four cards from the code deck are drawn. Each of these cards show a single shape. The players must now find the card that has the same shape as the first card, the same colour as the second card, the same fill as the third card and the same size as the fourth card. If a player thinks he has found the right card, he puts his finger down on the matching target card. If his guess is correct, he gains a number of the code cards as a reward. If his guess is wrong, he loses a card he has gained before.<br/><br/>Halfway through the game, things will get a bit more complex. The target cards are flipped over, and now show shapes in secondary colours. From now on, in order to determine the colour for the target card, the players must mix the colour of the shape on the code card with the background colour of the code card.<br/><br/>The game ends when there are too few code cards left to create a new assignment.

On your turn, take 3 actions. Options include placing a worker, moving a worker up a level, or building = adding a tile to the construction (which must touch the tile on which one of that player's workers is standing); score points = 1 per girder touching a girder already built, +1 if worker on tile, doubled if the new tile is now the highest built. There are penalties if you drop tiles or worker tokens, but otherwise you generally alternate taking turns adding tiles to the building.<br/><br/>The rivets are placed in an hole in the center of the tile and can be fitted to other tiles already in play. There are some (few) construction rules and the building will grow turn after turn. Where add tiles is an important decision but you also need a certain amount of precision and dexterity doing that because if you cause the fall of a worker (yours of opponent) you will loose points. Actually an important part of the game is placing your workers in a way that make much more difficult to opponents to add tiles.<br/><br/>The game ends prematurely if someone collapses the building; they lose, and whoever is furthest on the score track (after deducting points for tiles remaining in hand) wins the game.

Tension mounts as the product delivery cards are uncovered and it turns out that there will be enough product cards only for the lucky few standing closest to the door of a store. Since everyone wants to be first, the queue starts to push up against the door. To get ahead, the people in the queue use a range of queuing cards, such as &quot;Mother carrying small child&quot;, &quot;This is not your place, sir&quot;, or &quot;Under-the-counter goods&quot;. But they have to watch out for &quot;Closed for stocktaking&quot;, &quot;Delivery error&quot;, and for the black pawns &ndash; the speculators &ndash; standing in the queue. Only those players who make the best use of the queuing cards in their hand will come home with full shopping bags.<br/><br/>On the product cards are photos of sixty original objects from the Communist era. The merchandise includes Relaks shoes, Przemys\u0142awka eau de cologne, and Popularna tea, as well as other commodities that were once in scarce supply. The neighborhood also has an outdoor market but the prices there are steep &ndash; unless, of course, you manage to strike a deal with the market trader. In this realistic game you really have to be savvy to get the goods.<br/><br/>Are you brave enough to confront the everyday life of the 1980s?<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": {"341390": "Czech first edition"}, "average": "6.80821", "name": "Kolejka", "playingtime": "60", "boardgamemechanic": {"2040": "Hand Management"}, "age": "12", "boardgameexpansion": {}, "usersrated": "2059", "boardgamesubdomain": {"5499": "Family Games"}, "boardgamefamily": {"10317": "Country: Poland"}}, "85326": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic832813.jpg", "poll": {}, "boardgamedesigner": {"34887": {"name": "Karol Madaj"}}, "statistics": {}, "yearpublished": "2009", "maxplayers": "5", "boardgameartist": {"40870": "Tomasz Ginter"}, "boardgamepublisher": {"11530": {"name": "Instytut Pami\u0119ci Narodowej (IPN)"}}, "maxplaytime": "15", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic832813_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "15", "boardgamecategory": {"1094": {"name": "Educational"}}, "description": "Pami\u0119\u0107 `39 (Memory &rsquo;39)<br/><br/>Get to know the history of Poland&rsquo;s 1939 war of defense!<br/><br/>Everyone is familiar with memory games. With their simple rules and the excitement of rivalry, memory games appeal to both children and adults, and older players do not necessarily have an advantage over younger ones. Ever since they first appeared in the 1950s, games that involve looking for pairs of identical objects have enjoyed unflagging popularity and thousands of versions have been produced. While Memory &rsquo;39 continues this long tradition, it also introduces a certain element of novelty.<br/>Designed by the Institute of National Remembrance, this game not only improves the players&rsquo; power of concentration but also helps them to memorize the events of 1939 that are so important for Polish national identity. Memory &rsquo;39 makes use of archival photographs illustrating Poland&rsquo;s 1939 war of defense. A historical commentary on each photograph is provided in the enclosed brochure. Together with the commentary, the photographs tell a short history of the September campaign. To make the distant events more vivid, the black-and-white photographs have been tinted with great attention to historical detail.<br/><br/>The box contains:<br/>&ndash; 48 game cards with archival photographs<br/>&ndash; a brochure with historical commentaries on the photographs<br/><br/>(From back cover)<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": {"70142": "First edition"}, "age": "8", "name": "Pamie\u0107 `39", "playingtime": "15", "boardgamemechanic": {"2047": "Memory"}, "average": "4.63636", "usersrated": "11", "boardgamefamily": {"10317": "Country: Poland"}}, "85327": {"statistics": {}, "name": "WWE WrestleMania XIX", "videogamemode": {"2422": "Local Multiplayer"}, "videogameversion": {"70143": "US GameCube Edition"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1260066.jpg", "videogametheme": {"2375": "Sports - Wrestling"}, "videogamefranchise": {"4843": "WWE Wrestling"}, "usersrated": "1", "average": "7", "videogamegenre": {"2147": "Action"}, "videogameplatform": {"4425": "GameCube"}, "videogamehonor": {"30929": "2003 Spike Best Fighting Game of the Year Nominee"}, "poll": {}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1260066_t.jpg", "description": "Back of Case<br/><br/>Where Superstars become Legends<br/><br/><br/>    Realistic superstar attributes<br/>    New story mode with 25 missions<br/>    Sabotage Vince's Empire outside the ring <br/>    Robust gameplay with strong and weak grapples<br/><br/><br/>"}, "85328": {"rpgitemversion": {"70144": "First Printing"}, "poll": {}, "name": "Dungeon Floor Plans 4", "rpgproducer": {"3": "(Uncredited)"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic828021.jpg", "usersrated": "1", "average": "6", "statistics": {}, "rpggenre": {"961": "Fantasy"}, "rpg": {"356": "Generic / Universal"}, "rpgcategory": {"2086": "Accessory (dice, maps, screens, cards)"}, "rpgseries": {"18560": "Dungeon Floor Plans (Series 1)"}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic828021_t.jpg", "description": "From the back of the box:<br/><br/>Dungeon Floor Plans 4 are an extension of the Dungeon Floor Plans role-playing game aid for use with 25mm miniature figures, and provide flooring, walls, features and accessories for adventures set in Caverns &amp; Mines.<br/><br/>Contents<br/>12 coloured [sic] sheets of card as follows:<br/><br/>    Five sheets representing rocky Cavern Flooring<br/>    Three sheets representing Tunnel and Cavern Walls<br/>    Two sheets of Junction, Openings, and Corners<br/>    One sheet representing natural Cavern Features<br/>    One sheet of Mine Rails, Junctions and accessories<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>"}, "85329": {"statistics": {}, "name": "Bass Class", "videogamemode": {"2149": "Single-Player"}, "videogameversion": {"70145": "US DOS 5 1/4\" floppy disk"}, "average": "0", "videogametheme": {"2364": "Fishing"}, "usersrated": "0", "videogamegenre": {"2156": "Simulation"}, "videogameplatform": {"4714": "DOS"}, "poll": {}, "description": "User Summary<br/><br/>from the title screen:<br/>Bass Class<br/>The basics of bass fishing, by Dick Olsen<br/> If you enjoy bass class, please register your copy by sending $15 (US) to the author: <br/>Richard Olsen<br/>68 Hartwell ave<br/>Littleton, MA 01460 <br/><br/>This is not a major firm production, but a small endeavour by some people knowledgable about bass fishing and computer coding.<br/><br/>It's a bass fishing simulation with six different locations, 6 different rods and 2300 different lure combinations.

Players do have the option to switch the HUD (Heads-Up-Display) between Russian and the game language.<br/><br/>"}, "85343": {"rpgitemversion": {"70169": "1\u00aa Edition"}, "statistics": {}, "name": "En Alas del Peligro", "rpgproducer": {"41625": "Jordi Carbonell"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic827892.jpg", "usersrated": "0", "average": "0", "rpggenre": {"940": "Action / Adventure"}, "rpg": {"7971": "T\u00fa Eres Quien Defiende a los Animales"}, "rpgcategory": {"2136": "Solitaire Adventure"}, "poll": {}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic827892_t.jpg", "description": "From the Back of the Book:<br/><br/>Defiende a los animales y lucha contra la extinci&oacute;n del tigre de Bengala.<br/><br/>Durante muchos a&ntilde;os la caza indiscriminada del tigre de Bengala ha diezmado la poblaci&oacute;n de forma alarmante.<br/><br/>T&uacute; perteneces a una organizaci&oacute;n que se dedica a proteger a las especies en peligro de extinci&oacute;n.

It is an expanded version of sishi fen ('40 points') using two or more decks, and is related to zhao pengyou ('looking for friends').

Tractor is widely popular in China, especially in Shanghai and south of the Yellow River where it has practically displaced the older single deck game.<br/><br/>The scores of the teams are expressed as card ranks. At the start of the game, each partnership has the lowest possible score, which is two. By winning games, a partnership can increase its score to a higher rank: three, four, five and so on. Above ten come jack, queen, king and ace. The objective is to achieve a score higher than ace - the partnership that achieves this wins the game.<br/><br/>In each hand, one team forms the declarers, sometimes known in Chinese as dang1 zhuang1 (\u5f53\u5e84), and the other team forms the opponents. In the first hand, either team can be the declarers, depending on who makes trumps. In subsequent hands, the team that won the previous hand is the declarers, and the other team is the opponents.<br/><br/>One member of the declarers' team is the starter, who has the advantage of taking the last cards in the deal, discarding some cards, and leading the first trick. While the declarers try to increase their score, the opponents' objective is to take at least 80 card points, in which case they become the declarers for the next deal.<br/><br/>Source: edited from Pagat, <a target='_blank' href='http://www.pagat.com/kt5/tractor.html' rel='nofollow'>http://www.pagat.com/kt5/tractor.html</a><br/><br/>"}, "85378": {"statistics": {}, "name": "Asgard (Issue 4 - Nov 2001)", "rpgproducer": {"23889": "Russell Morrissey"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic828315.jpg", "usersrated": "0", "average": "0", "rpgissue": {"7994": "Asgard"}, "rpgissuearticle": {"18228": "Jack-O-Lantern"}, "rpg": {"524": "d20 System / OGL Product (D&D 3.5 Compatible)"}, "rpgissueversion": {"70262": "PDF Version"}, "poll": {}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic828315_t.jpg", "description": "Issue 4 of Asgard Magazine<br/><br/>Cover Art by J Ryan Machan<br/><br/>"}, "85380": {"statistics": {}, "name": "Hamlet", "videogamemode": {"2149": "Single-Player"}, "videogameversion": {"289528": "Android Edition"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic907793.png", "videogametheme": {"2284": "Medieval"}, "usersrated": "1", "average": "4", "videogamegenre": {"2152": "Adventure"}, "videogameplatform": {"6063": "Android"}, "poll": {}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic907793_t.png", "description": "User Summary<br/><br/>Hamlet is an indie production point-and-click adventure game developed by mif2000.

Place the chosen card under the holes in your playfield. You can see all the words from the playingcard in the holes now.<br/>If you choose a blue playingcard for example, you both choose a blue wordcard. You recognize your own wordcards by the white or black triangle in the corner of the card. Player 1 chooses a card from the stack with white triangles, and player 2 from the stack with the black triangles. This is your secret word your opponent has to search for. Put the wordcard against the sloping side of the playingfield, so your opponent can't see it.<br/><br/>The first player to guess the word from the other player wins. On your turn, you ask your opponent a question which he can answer with yes or no. For example: Does your word start with a &quot;B&quot;? If your opponent answers no, you can put a chip on every word on your playing card that does not start with a &quot;B&quot;. This goes on until only one word remains.

It is also the first Atari System I arcade game to include digitized speech, including voice clips of Harrison Ford as Indiana Jones and Amrish Puri as Mola Ram, as well as John Williams' music from the film.<br/><br/>Ports<br/><br/>The arcade game was later ported by U.S. Gold to the Amstrad CPC, Commodore 64, MSX and ZX Spectrum (developed by Paragon Programming) in 1987. During the same year, Mindscape ported it to the Atari ST and the Commodore 64 (different compared to U.S. Gold's version). In 1989, Mindscape ported it to the Commodore Amiga and personal computers that use MS-DOS. The most well-known home console port is the one for the Nintendo Entertainment System. The NES version was ported by Tengen in December 1988.<br/><br/>The Nintendo Entertainment System<br/><br/>Nintendo of America sought to capitalize on both the success of its Nintendo Entertainment System and the Indiana Jones  franchise by porting the game to its popular console. The resulting product differed from the arcade version in several aspects, but kept the same underlying premise and style. The plot of the NES version follows the storyline of the original movie.<br/><br/>By December 1988, there were two versions of the game available, distributed by Tengen and Mindscape, although the software itself was identical. After a lawsuit, Tengen's unlicensed version was pulled from the shelves and Mindscape's became the standard. Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom gives the player control of Indiana Jones as he makes his way through the temple in a series of 12 levels or &quot;waves.&quot; In the final wave, the player must defeat the villain of the film, Mola Ram, on a rope bridge that recreates the final scene in the movie. Reception of the game was generally negative.<br/><br/>Differences in the Console Version<br/><br/>There are several differences between the arcade game and its console adaptation. In the original arcade version, the Sankara Stones were not all found in one location at the end of a wave. Instead, Jones had to travel through a temple  every two rounds. In addition, the entire style of play is different and bestows upon the player more weapons and items for Jones to collect from the slave children he frees. Jones was also unable to jump in previous incarnations of the game.<br/><br/>The original arcade version was the first Atari System 1 game to talk to the players using speech capability, a feature lacking in the console version due to the limitations of the hardware. The arcade game, like the console adaptation, obtained its theme music (as well as sound effects that were absent on the NES version) from the film itself.<br/><br/>Skyler Miller, a reviewer at Allgame  who compared the console adaptation to the original game, admitted that the graphics are &quot;recognizable,&quot; but claims that the version is &quot;missing the much of the original's detail and character.&quot; Miller's final judgment is to call it &quot;a passable effort&quot; and to compare unfavourably to the arcade version.<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom (Nintendo Entertainment System)&quot; and &quot;Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom (arcade game)&quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "85459": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic930689.jpg", "poll": {}, "boardgamedesigner": {"9580": {"name": "John Clowdus"}}, "statistics": {}, "yearpublished": "2010", "maxplayers": "4", "boardgamepublisher": {"7629": {"name": "Small Box Games"}}, "maxplaytime": "30", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic930689_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "30", "boardgamecategory": {"1002": {"name": "Card Game"}}, "description": "This small bonus expansion for Irondale was distributed with some of the early preorders.

The world rejoices as the tyrant mage\u02bcs empire comes crumbling down, ending two centuries of brutal tyranny and war. But fate has only begun to weave the twisted skein of Hazergal\u02bcs destiny, and as the light and warmth of life slip away, the former archmage finds himself on the bleak, demon-haunted planes of the Abyss, his soul condemned for all eternity.<br/><br/>Now merely a shadow of his former self, Hazergal is seemingly bereft of the awesome power he commanded in life. Alone, defenseless, and beset by the fell inhabitants of the Abyss, Hazergal faces countless eons of torment and humiliation, his eternal reward for a lifetime of wickedness. But Hazergal soon realizes that he is different from the other Abyssal petitioners. Memories of his former life remain, and in the deepest recesses of Hazergal\u02bcs soul a terrible power grows: a power that will propel him along a course no mortal has ever undertaken, leading to the pinnacle of fiendish might.<br/><br/>But such power is a bright beacon of opportunity to the terrible Abyssal rulers, and Hazergal soon finds himself embroiled in the lethal politics of the chaotic plane. Forced to emulate the demonic inhabitants of the Abyss in both body and mind, Hazergal must navigate a treacherous landscape of chaos and evil aided only by unlikely allies and his own formidable intellect. And although destruction and damnation awaits him at every turn, the faint specter of ultimate power beckons Hazergal on, as he makes the arduous climb from dretch to demon lord.<br/><br/>"}, "85496": {"statistics": {}, "name": "Quest for the Holy Joystick", "videogamemode": {"2149": "Single-Player"}, "videogameversion": {"70477": "UK ZX Spectrum edition"}, "average": "0", "videogametheme": {"2509": "Comedy"}, "usersrated": "0", "videogamegenre": {"2168": "Text Adventure"}, "videogameplatform": {"4950": "ZX Spectrum"}, "poll": {}, "description": "User summary:<br/><br/>This humorous adventure game satirizes the British adventure game scene of the early to mid 80's.
