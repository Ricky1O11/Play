Out of the 49 games submitted, Wings of Lightning won 8th place overall.  It also won the Best Paragraph Game and Best Large Game categories and was first runner-up for Best Sci Fi/Fantasy Game.<br/><br/>Unlike most gamebooks, Wings of Lightning eschews dice in favor of a system based on poker cards.  The combat system seeks to emulate such video games as God of War, Dante's Inferno, or Shadow of the Colossus. The game takes additional inspiration from the Legend of Zelda game series.<br/><br/>In Wings of Lightning, you play as Skoros, a soldier of Daleko desperate to defend his city from a massive siege by Ahdeen, the demi-god of deceit and his armies.  Molina, he demi-goddess of lightning, in love with you and desperate to keep you alive, grants a portion of her divine power to you, hopefully making you strong enough to defeat Ahdeen's armies and free your people.<br/><br/>In combat, you divide a deck of poker cards into 2 smaller decks, one containing all the face cards, the other containing all the number cards.  You use the face cards on your turn and the number cards for the enemy turn.<br/><br/>On your turn, guess the color (red or black) of the top card of the face card deck and reveal it.  If you guessed the color correctly, add the card to your strike pile.  If you were incorrect, add the card to your maneuver pile.  Continue this process until you decide to stop or until you have cards in your maneuver pile equal to your Speed.<br/><br/>The number of cards in your strike pile then determines which combo abilities you can activate, as well as the amount of damage you deal to your enemies.  Your maneuver cards are saved and used during the enemy turn to cancel their hits.  But be careful!  If you gain maneuver cards equal to your Speed, you take an automatic hit from the fastest enemy.<br/><br/>The number cards are used during the enemy turn.  For each enemy, draw a card.  If the number on that card is equal to or less than that enemy's Aim, you take damage from that enemy.  You can prevent this damage if you have a maneuver card of the same suit.<br/><br/>The contest version is a 78-page gamebook with a very linear storyline.

Then another hand of cards is played, and the winner chooses a card to be the result of that match, and so on, until all the matches have been played.<br/><br/>The points in Part 1 are added to the points in Part 2 and the winner is the one with the most points.<br/><br/>"}, "130524": {"boardgamedesigner": ["(Uncredited)"], "average": "0", "poll": [], "name": "Memory Challenge: New York Edition", "playingtime": "60", "minplayers": "1", "boardgamemechanic": ["Memory", "Variable Player Powers"], "yearpublished": "2012", "usersrated": "0", "maxplayers": "0", "boardgamefamily": ["Cities: New York (New York, USA)", "Country: USA", "Memory Challenge"], "boardgameartist": ["(Uncredited)"], "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["USAopoly"], "boardgameversion": ["First Edition"], "maxplaytime": "60", "boardgamecategory": ["Card Game", "Educational", "Memory", "Travel"], "age": "8", "minplaytime": "60", "description": "Publisher Blurb:<br/><br/>Now you can experience the world&rsquo;s most popular matching game with all the sites and sounds of the Big Apple.

Each turn, a wave of saucers attacks, and the players must band together to defend against them. To fail is to lose one of the inner planets&mdash;Mercury, Venus, Earth, or Mars&mdash;to the invaders. Lose them all, and humankind faces extinction.<br/><br/>Fortunately, your crew cards provide special abilities that can be used in a pinch to help hold off overwhelming attacks. Also, the game is self-leveling, so that 2 players face a lesser threat than 3 players or 4 do. Each game lasts 30 to 60 minutes.<br/><br/>Game Play: (1) Each player is dealt one random Captain card, Navigator card, and Engineer card. These cards each have a special ability usable once per game to help against overwhelming odds. (2) Half the play deck is dealt to the players as defense cards; the other half becomes a draw pile of offense cards for the Saucer People. (3) Each round, three Saucer People cards are turned up to attack. (The actual attack value is calculated differently for 2, 3, or 4 players.) (4) In defense, the players each lay one card from their hand and add them. (5) If the total defense equals or exceeds the attack, the Saucer People are defeated at the asteroid belt. (6) If not, the Saucer People cards now attack individual worlds--indicated by the card suits. And each player's card defends the world of its suit. (7) If the total value of Saucer People cards at a world exceed the total value of defender cards at the world, the world falls to the invaders.<br/><br/>Victory Conditions: Game play continues until the deck is depleted, then victory conditions are calculated, ranging from Total Human Victory, to one or more worlds lost, to Total Human Extinction.<br/><br/>Expansion: There's now an official booster pack for the game. The Invasion of the Saucer People! Booster Pack adds new options to your defense of the inner planets. Included in this pack are full crews for both Luna and Ceres, in addition to Dr. Sato from the Pluto research station, a Captain from Hollywood, a young psychic Captain, a Robot Sidekick, and the ever-popular Space Monkey.

While the Mormon Church uses the more frequently travelled ones for road tolls, there are plenty of valleys and gorges unfit for human life. They contain such hazards as sudden drops, sharp and unsteady rocks, and constantly brutal temperatures. Water is also scarce. Even if explorers can see a body of water, there is no guarantee that the infuriatingly rough terrain will allow them access to it.<br/><br/>Anyone who has spent time in the Weird West knows of another class of dangers. The dark corners of Deseret hold nosferatu, wall crawlers, and the dread of the salt flats- the horrendous and insidiously intelligent rattlers.<br/><br/>Deep in the canyonlands, a few miles outside of the new settlement of Moab, there is a maze of gorges that has not felt the influence of the Reckoning. In fact, it has not seen many huge changes since the Mesozoic Era. Within wait many otherwise long extinct creatures, named only a couple of decades ago by British paleontologist Sir Richard Owen. This wilderness region holds the last of the creatures known as dinosaurs!<br/><br/>Dinosaurs were devoured everywhere else by the rattlers in Earth&rsquo;s past, but the creatures within this hidden wilderness have survived because almost the entire region is made of virtually impenetrable rock. Sure, there is soil and plant life, but rock remains underneath.<br/><br/>Recently, a Mormon professor named Uriah Vernon has returned from the canyonlands, making preposterous claims that ultimately cost him his chair at the newly created Brigham Young University. He says he has seen dinosaurs living in the gorges near Moab. The rough conditions of the Utah wilderness and an untimely rattler ambush ultimately killed off the rest of his expedition party, so no one lives who can verify his claim. Vernon has returned with no records of his expedition either and this coupled with his vehement claims have been enough to destroy his reputation as an honest scientist.<br/><br/>Vernon is now in Salt Lake City trying to gather another expedition, in order to bring live dinosaurs back to civilization and silence his critics.

Bartleby knew the recipe called for milk, but there were no sources of milk in Scatterpoint. Th en one day he saw a litter of those feral cats that seemed to be everywhere.

For example,Fasts has three cards - Lent, Advent, Fridays; but Prayer has five cards - Adoration, Thanksgiving, Confession, Petition and Intercession. There are 10 sets in all and List cards are provided to help players know how many cards are needed.<br/><br/>The procedure for collecting the cards is traditional. In your turn, you may ask any player for any card from a set that you already have at least one card from that set. You go on until you are unsuccesful, then the turn passes to the left. There are minor extra rules relating to courtesy and mistakes. Full sets are laid out on the table and are now 'Safe'. It says that once all sets have been collected, each player scores for each set in front of them, 1 point for every card in your collection (which means the larger sets are more difficult to collect but will score more points.)<br/><br/>The presentation is very unusual. There is no doubt that this is a properly published game, not an amateur production. Yet the cards have very basic illustrations and all text is as if it had been handwritten. I suppose they wanted to give the impression that it was illustrated at Sunday School (which might actually be true).<br/><br/>THE CHURCH GAME<br/>RULES<br/>1. The cards are divided into sets numbered 1 to 10. Each set consists of a LIST card (no picture) and PICTURE cards, whose names appear all together on the LIST card.<br/>2. Different Sets contain different numbers of cards. The Winner of the game is the person who has collected the greatest number of cards (not sets) after an agreed number of hands.<br/>3. Players cut for deal, the person cutting a card bearing the highest number is the dealer but should two cut the same highest number they cut again until one is<br/>higher than the other. Thereafter the deal passes to the original dealers left.<br/>4. The cards are dealt out singly beginning at the dealer's left. This may result in one or more players having an extra card to begin with but this is immaterial.<br/>5. The game begins with the dealer asking any player for ANY card by name belonging to a set of which he already has one or more cards. E.g. having in his hand the List Card &quot;Greater Sacraments&rdquo; he might ask someone for &ldquo;Baptism&quot;; or having Maniple he might ask for Vestments (the List Card); or Alb (which belongs to the same set).<br/>6. Before every request the player making it must say &ldquo;Please&rdquo; and after a successful one he must say &ldquo;Thank You&rdquo;. If he forgets to do either his turn is immediately forfeit; if the latter he must also return the last card so obtained.<br/>7. After a successful request a player may make a further one and continue until either he is unsuccessful or forgets to say &ldquo;Please&quot; or &ldquo;Thank You&quot;. In this case the turn passes to the player on his left and so on round the group.<br/>8. As soon as a player has a complete set he lays them on the table in front of him and they are thenceforth<br/>&quot;Safe&quot; (i.e. none can take them from him).<br/>9. A player must not (with the single exception of Rule 10 below) ask for a card belonging to a set of which he has not at least one card already. Should he accidentally do so (i.e. by imagining that an Amice is a Greater Sacrament and asking for the latter on the strength of possessing the former) he must return the card and forfeit his turn.<br/>10. If a player whose turn it is to ask finds himself without a single card in his hand he may ask for ANY card still in play (i.e. he is exempt from Rule 9). But as soon as he is successful and has a card in his hand Rule 9<br/>applies again.<br/>11. When every card is &quot;safe&quot; the hand ends and players count the cards to their credit and score appropriately. The deal then passes as explained in Rule 3.<br/>NOTE: When players are new to the game it is a help to familiarize them with the sets by giving them a list of the sets&rsquo; names and the numbers on them. These should be withdrawn as players&rsquo; become more familiar with them.<br/><br/>"}, "130562": {"poll": [], "name": "Die lustige Autofahrt", "playingtime": "20", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": ["Roll / Spin and Move"], "yearpublished": "0", "usersrated": "0", "maxplayers": "6", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1926997_t.jpg", "average": "0", "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["L\u00f6ffler & Co, Saalfeld"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1926997.jpg", "boardgameversion": ["First edition"], "maxplaytime": "20", "boardgamecategory": ["Children's Game", "Dice", "Racing"], "age": "6", "minplaytime": "20", "description": "Objective: be the first reaching target space (76)<br/> - moving by turns -<br/>each player rolls the die and moves forward according number; follow instructings ending on a red marked (image) space.<br/>Remarks:<br/>should be published during 1930's<br/>very cute ceramic meeples<br/><br/>"}, "130565": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1417332.jpg", "poll": [], "boardgamedesigner": ["Stephen Avery"], "statistics": [], "yearpublished": "0", "maxplayers": "4", "boardgameartist": ["Stephen Avery"], "boardgamepublisher": ["(Unpublished)"], "maxplaytime": "30", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1417332_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "30", "boardgamecategory": ["Action / Dexterity", "American West"], "description": "You 'n yer gang high-tailed it back to yer hideout cause the posse was a comin'.

Swords of Cydoria is set on the fantasy world of Uruta. Whether Uruta is our own Earth in the far future, a mirror of Earth in a parallel universe, or a strangely-familiar alien world on the far side of the galaxy is unclear. Uruta is a savage barbaric world of flashing swords, mutant beasts, daring heroes, diabolical cults, ancient ruins, mysterious forces, and powerful artifacts. Against this backdrop of swords and sorcery is told a story of contact with alien worlds, the introduction of science-fiction technology, and the struggle for freedom against oppression.<br/><br/>Swords of Cydoria  offers many opportunities for intrigue and adventure. Using the rules presented for this setting, players may create brooding barbarians, dashing adventurers, desperate freedom fighters, cunning aero-ship pilots, and much more.<br/><br/>Setting<br/><br/>Swords of Cydoria  takes place on the continent of Markania on the mysterious world known as Uruta.<br/><br/>The continent of Markania is a land of extremes, with frigid tundra covering the northern third, poisonous jungles and swamps blanketing the southern third. The middle is characterized by regions of exploding volcanoes, baking deserts, vast plains, inland gulfs, towering peaks, floating mountains, and dense forests. The deserts are home to ravenous sand squid and giant wasps. Dragonflies the size of horses dart over the dark jungles of deadly plants and poisonous miasma. Massive four-armed mutant apes occupy cliff-side caves overlooking a fetid swamp. Monstrous saurians haunt the ancient ruins of lost cities deep in the vinechoked forests.<br/><br/>Civilization is centered in the city-states of Cydoria, most of which are ruled by the Vrildarian Empire. The Empire conquered the city-states twelve years ago using advanced technology supplied by the Rhakadian League, aliens from the planet Malus.<br/><br/>During the War of Unification, the Empire was opposed by the Coalition of Timan, an alliance equipped with advanced technology of their own supplied by the Phanosian Alliance, enemies of the Rhakadians. The Coalition was eventually abandoned by their Phanosian allies and ultimately lost the war. Afterwards, the cities of the Coalition were occupied and its population enslaved. Many Coalition prisoners were shipped to prison camps in the deserts of Arus.<br/><br/>Life for the civilized people of Cydoria is roughly equivalent to that of ancient Rome or China, with areas of relative technical sophistication in cities such as Norukar. Barbarians, of course, live a much more primitive existence. People wield swords and wear armor of leather and steel. They tame strange animals as mounts and food. In recent years, contact with aliens has introduced sorcerous wonders such as electric lights and motors, broadcast power, energy weapons, and motorized vehicles.<br/><br/>The Vrildarian Empire maintains power over the empire through its monopoly on access to alien technology. Such wonders are available only to a select few members of the nobility and the punishment for unauthorized use of technology is severe. The sentence for carrying or using a laser pistol, for example, is the amputation of a hand. Despite this, smugglers from other worlds are able to slip past the Rhakadian orbital blockade and gain entry through the Oudh, the magical force field that protects Uruta from alien invasion, to sell their wares on the black market.<br/><br/>The invention of the aero-ship, flying vehicles powered by propeller-driven engines, has opened up the Markanian interior for colonization and settlement. Cydorian pioneers and refugees from the War of Unification have streamed west to establish a new life on the frontier.<br/><br/>Into this land stride mighty adventurers, be they resolute soldiers of the Demetrian resistance, cunning members of the crew of the Tonbo, crafty artifact hunters exploring an ancient ruin, mystical warriors of the Adhara, deadly assassins of the Katari, devious rogues of the Hidden Hand, notorious sky-pirates of the Dazumi, or simple townsfolk on the Markanian frontier. They fight for freedom, riches, and fame against the tyranny of those who would oppress them.<br/><br/>"}, "130577": {"poll": [], "name": "You Can't Fire the Customer", "playingtime": "0", "minplayers": "2", "yearpublished": "1998", "usersrated": "0", "maxplayers": "5", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2077656_t.jpg", "average": "0", "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["Franklin Learning Systems"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2077656.jpg", "boardgameversion": ["First Edition"], "maxplaytime": "0", "boardgamecategory": ["Educational"], "age": "8", "minplaytime": "0", "description": "Customer Service has become a major element in the strategic plans of all successful companies today.

You may even encounter hostile or friendly aliens. The player with the highest total score at the end of the game claims the planet and victory!<br/>SETUP: Separate all Base Station cards from deck. One per player. This is your starting point. Set aside any unused Base Station cards and out of play in a Discard Pile. Shuffle the deck and deal five cards to each player. Place the rest of the deck face down. This is the Draw Pile. Each player will need a total playing space of approximately 14&rdquo; across and 16&rdquo; down to create a grid of 5 cards across and 4 cards down. Place your Base Station at the top center.<br/>STARTING THE GAME: The player who had their birthday most recently goes first, then play continues around clockwise.<br/>FIRST ROUND: During your turn, draw a card from the Draw Pile.<br/>Lay any card in your hand with a Level of 1, or an Alien Visit, next to or above your Base Station.If you cannot play a card, place one face up in the discard pile. This ends of your turn. Cards can only be played side to side, or top to bottom, but not<br/>diagonally. Play continues until each player has placed a card next to their Base. This completes the first round.<br/>SECOND ROUND and BEYOND: On the second round, each player has the option of playing any card in their hand with a Level of 2<br/>or less, Alien Visit, Alien Attack or Meteor Strike. Third round can play Level 3 or less. Fourth round Level 4 or less. Fifth round Level 5 or less. Each rounds afterwards you can play any card, but you cannot repeat identical cards you have already<br/>placed in your colony, unless detroyed by meteor.<br/>OPTIONS OF PLAY:<br/>&bull;Lay down a Defense Laser/Force Field card to your colony to protect it and any card next to it from Meteor Strikes and/or Alien Attacks.<br/>&bull;Lay down an Alien Attack card on an unoccupied space in an    opponents colony.

I'm here, well because I'm a detective and that's what I do - solve mysteries. This one began when a strange note fell into my possession. Now that I'm here, I don't feel as if I'm alone - the voices are back... Are they phantoms of an insane mind or possibly shadowy thoughts of a deranged personality? Maybe they are all entities living within the world of our detective's mind. In Phobos, each player takes on the role of one of these personalities. Your goal is to eliminate the personalities of your opponent(s). Once accomplished then your personality prevails allowing you to control the detective. Each of you chooses a Mentality board, 8 Ghost Miniatures, 12 Character Miniatures, a D12 Die and 3 Action cards. Players then each get 3 Phobos cards (from 12 different possibilities) and keep these face down. These cards represent your Fears and an extension of the Detective who is imprisoned inside the Amityville Asylum. (Note that the Mentality board includes all the 12 different fears matching the 12 Phobos cards.)<br/><br/>In each round you play an Action card which will instruct you to place your Miniatures either on your board or your opponent's (depending on the card) trying to find their fears. If you place a Miniature on an opponent's Mentality Board that matches one of their fears, they are forced to reveal that fear. Then, based upon how you placed your Miniature you will have accumulated movement points which will be used to place and move your Ghosts on the main board (comprised of 16 tiles). The board includes four central halls where your Ghosts enter the detective's head and 12 fear rooms which represent each of the Phobos cards. When you place 2 Ghosts in a room which represents one of your Phobos cards, you are protected (for as long as they remain). This then makes it so that when an opponent places a Character Miniature on your Mentality board matching one of your fears, you are not forced to reveal your Phobos Card. It sounds simple but nothing is simple in the dream world where nightmares and demons prevail! On the other hand you can play an Adrenaline card and bring the upside down in the game. But these cards cost one of your Ghost, if you to claim one.<br/><br/>If your Fears are revealed by your rivals, then you lose but you are not eliminated.

In order to do this, they are able to extinguish light sources, hide behind objects and pass through narrow grates and shafts which are inaccessible to enemies.

Players try to move through a labyrinthine game board in order to reach a desired symbol shown on a game board tile that matches a hidden card held by this player. The game board consists of a number of fixed tiles as well as rows and columns in which tiles can slide back and forth; these tiles show tunnels &ndash; T-shaped, straight, and otherwise &ndash; and a player can move his token only along the path as it exists on his turn.<br/><br/>At the start of his turn, however, he takes the one tile on the side of the game board and pushes it into a row or column of his choice, shifting the tunnels and pushing out one tile that the next player will use. This player now moves his pawn, and if he reaches the desired symbol, he reveals the card, then looks at the next card in his stack to see what he wants to reach next turn. Once a player has revealed all of his cards, he needs to return to his starting corner. The first player to do this wins!<br/><br/>To this basic game, Star Wars Labyrinth adds one twist &ndash; a Darth Vader variant in which a Vader token starts the game on a designated tile.

The game board consists of a number of fixed tiles as well as rows and columns in which tiles can slide back and forth; these tiles show tunnels &ndash; T-shaped, straight, and otherwise &ndash; and a player can move his token only along the path as it exists on his turn.<br/><br/>At the start of his turn, however, he takes the one tile on the side of the game board and pushes it into a row or column of his choice, shifting the tunnels and pushing out one tile that the next player will use.

With <br/>suspicions running high, the Citizens choose a person to lynch each day.<br/><br/>Objective<br/>Good and Evil are at odds.  The Citizens must attempt to rid the village of all the evil players by lynching who they suspect to be causing the nighttime murders. If the village is successful <br/>in lynching all the Werewolves, Witches or Demons during the day, the Citizens win!  If the Evil players succeed in killing all the Citizens, they are victorious!<br/><br/>Components<br/>Dark Village is played with a deck of cards that includes 10 Evil roles and 26 Citizen roles.<br/>          <br/>Setup<br/>A game of Dark Village is easy to get started. Just gather a group of people and have them sit in a circle.  You can be just about anywhere&hellip;on chairs, on the ground, around a table, or on the couches in the family room.  A person who is familiar with the game is chosen as the Narrator.  Cards to be used are <br/>chosen with there being around one Evil player for every 3 Citizens.  The Narrator deals each player a card that becomes their secret role for the game.  A basic game begins with a Narrator, 2 Evil characters and 6 Citizens.<br/><br/>Roles<br/>\uf0b7 Narrator<br/>\uf0b7 Citizens (Good village folk)<br/>\uf0b7 Werewolves, Witches, and Demons (Evil villagers who win by killing off and outnumbering Citizens)<br/>\uf0b7 Seer/Detective (Citizen-sided, can inspect for Evil members)<br/>\uf0b7 Doctor (Citizen-sided, can choose a player to save at night)<br/><br/>Nightfall&hellip;<br/>The Narrator begins the game by having everyone close their eyes and be silent.  He controls all the actions in the form of a story. (&ldquo;Nighttime has fallen and all the village has <br/>gone to sleep&hellip;&rdquo;) This begins the nighttime phase of the game. Each night, the Narrator has characters awake and perform their actions. He instructs the Werewolves to &ldquo;awake&rdquo; (open their eyes) and see their fellow members.  They kill off one of the Citizens by silently gesturing who they choose.  They must all be in agreement. The Narrator asks one Werewolf to gesture his <br/>battle sign and makes note of it.  The narrator then has the Werewolves go back to &ldquo;sleep&rdquo; (close their eyes). The Narrator, then, instructs the Seer to &ldquo;awake&rdquo;. The Seer points at a player he suspects of being Evil. The Narrator nods if the Seer is correct.  The Narrator has the Seer go back to &ldquo;sleep&rdquo;. The Narrator, next, instructs the Doctor to awake and select a person to save.  The doctor silently points at a player goes back to &ldquo;sleep&rdquo;. Last, the Narrator instructs all Citizens to gesture their battle sign and makes note of the sign of the player who was attacked.<br/><br/>Daybreak&hellip;<br/>The Narrator has everyone &ldquo;wake up&rdquo; to begin the daytime phase.  <br/>Unless the Doctor has saved the player the Werewolves attacked or the player has defeated the Werewolves with his battle sign, a murder is announced to the group.  The Narrator tells a story of that character&rsquo;s death.  The dead player may no longer participate in the game in any way.  All the players may now discuss who they suspect as one of the killers.  After enough time has passed, the Narrator calls for a vote on who the village will lynch.  The majority vote causes that player to be hung and killed at dusk.<br/><br/>The Second Night<br/>The Narrator continues the night and day phases until, all the Citizens or all the Evil players have been killed.<br/><br/>Winning<br/>When either all Good or all Evil is left, the game is over and that group wins. Remember, even though you may die, the things you said might provide valuable information to help your group win.<br/><br/>Battle<br/>A Battle occurs between the Werewolves and the player they attack.  A player may only use a sign that is shown on their card.  The outcome is decided by one of the most basic <br/>systems known to man:<br/>\uf0b7 Paper beats Rock<br/>\uf0b7 Rock beats Scissors<br/>\uf0b7 Scissors beat Paper   <br/>\uf0b7 Evil wins all ties<br/><br/>Additional Roles<br/>Dark Village includes several additional roles to enhance traditional gameplay. <br/>\uf0b7 Priest &ndash; Sees the role of a dead player each night<br/>\uf0b7 Mason &ndash; Learns the identity of the other Mason <br/>\uf0b7 Dentist &ndash; Every third night chooses a player to silence for one day<br/>\uf0b7 Star-Crossed Lover &ndash; Chooses a lover the first night.

It's a mix of Road Warrior, Damnation Alley, Fallout, Wasteland and an American version of Twilight: 2000.<br/><br/>Setting &amp; Flavor:<br/>In the year 2061, global tensions had reached the point where a Third World War became unavoidable. Rather than being the clash of superpowers that had been prophesied in the late 20th century, the war began small as a series of brush fires in the developing world. Gradually, more and more nations became embroiled in these small disputes until some of the larger nations found themselves on opposite sides of these regional conflicts. A few dramatic acts of terrorism prompted the use of atomic weapons. Once this option was broached the theory of mutually assured destruction was put to the ultimate test. Most people called this &quot;The Last War&quot; but it had many names: the Great Conflagration, Tianhuo, the True Rapture, Ragnarok, the list goes on.<br/><br/>There are those that had seen this event coming and made preparations to survive the day after. Governments were broken, armies scattered, cities leveled. For about a month after the war barely a cricket stirred on the surface of the planet. Those who managed to make it to shelter bided their time, watching their Geiger counters and parceling out their rations. Others, not so fortunate, who managed to survive the blast fought tooth and nail to eke out a meager existence from the bones of civilization. In the years that followed, shelter dwellers began emerging from their bolt holes and, like mushrooms after a rain, started to blossom into small communities on the ravaged surface. Some of these communities took on the task of trying to restore America; others sought only to stay alive and hoard as much power as possible.<br/><br/>It is now the year 2136. No one remains alive who remembers what the world was like before. At least two generations of shelter-born survivors have come into this new frontier; many more generations have bloomed on the surface, where life spans are much more tenuous. The more prominent post-war groups are in conflict with each other as agendas clash and the competition for scarce resources intensifies. The players find themselves as products of this New Dark Age, this America made savage. Can they survive? And if so, can they live long enough to change the world?<br/><br/>"}, "130638": {"rpgdesigner": ["Emily Care Boss", "John H.

The year is approximately 2500 A.D. Everyone in this setting plays a member of a gang. The powers that be, in this case a fascist dictatorship calling itself the Hegemony, film and broadcast the battles between these gangs from orbit for the pleasure of the senescent masses.<br/><br/>The Hegemony was formed during an event called &quot;The Unification&quot; when all the governments of Old Earth aligned under a single political banner and undertook the joint exploration and exploitation of space. The globe of Earth expanded until it became the Sphere, an invisible bubble encompassing every star system within 100 light years of Humanity&rsquo;s cradle. With the accomplishment of this tremendous feat there were many who speculated that human civilization would move into an age of unending peace. After all, what couldn't the human race accomplish if it could yoke the stars? For the first couple of centuries, this lofty ambition even seemed plausible but, by degrees, as the seeds of the human race spread farther and farther from home, the hue and cry for independent government began to peal ever more loudly. The ruling council of the Hegemony, a cabal of well-moneyed and old blooded ministers called &quot;The Eight&quot;, could not tolerate dissent of this sort and hope to keep their unified government together. They curtailed political speech and began to institute stricter &quot;civil conduct&quot; laws enforced by the threat of capital punishment. Through it all, The Eight maintained a veneer of piety, dressing their policies in florid language that extolled the virtues of their &quot;perfect&quot; society.<br/><br/>All along the periphery of the Sphere, where the influence of Earth was weakest, citizens grew tired of the central government's policies. Independent brushfire rebellions sprouted up on a number of border worlds at once. Though they all had different leaders and different methods the common theme was being shouted loud and clear: people weren't going to stand for the sanctimonious lies of the Hegemony any more.<br/><br/>At first, Todesfeld was just another of these disenfranchised worlds, more or less a glorified asteroid with little to distinguish it from the other rocks that were being gleefully core-stripped by the Hegemony's Mining Conglomerates. True to type, Todesfeld was filthy with pollution and mostly lawless. Hegemony Stormtroopers kept an eye on things from orbit but pretty much let the Conglomerates run the world however they wanted (so long as their brutal ore quotas were met). Cities metastasized around the mining camps, fueled by corporation money and the vices of the overworked miners. When the mines started to dry up the corporation executives suddenly pulled out, abandoning their holdings and employees on the surface. All of the miners were fired on the spot. Those who lacked the credits to leave started in with the usual rioting and disobedience that follows this sort of thing. Normally, Stormtroopers would have been deployed to crack a few skulls and restore order at the point of a gun, but the Hegemony had other ideas in mind.<br/><br/>For some time the Directors of the Eight had realized that the military was being stretched too thin to maintain order on every intransigent planet in Sphere. They needed a different strategy, one that would make an example of the rioters on Todesfeld and serve notice to rebels everywhere else. A &quot;Purge&quot; was decreed: the forced exile of every criminal, political and otherwise, to Todesfeld. There the convicts would eat the rebels alive and then kill each other for territorial rights, solving all of the Hegemony's problems at once. The master stroke was this: to pay for the adventure, the Hegemony would televise the ensuing battles across their domain for the entertainment of their lawful subjects. It was an overnight success. Violence and political dissent in the peripheral worlds of the Sphere declined sharply. It seemed like round-the-clock blood sport was just the sort of diversion that the overworked and overtaxed minions of the Hegemony were looking for. To enhance the drama the Hegemony started offering cash prizes and the elusive promise of clemency for those 'contestants' who fought the best. Gangs began to want to go to Todesfeld to show how tough they were and to win what loot they could.<br/><br/>"}, "130652": {"rpgdesigner": ["(Uncredited)"], "rpgitemversion": ["PDF version"], "poll": [], "name": "D20 to Savage Worlds Conversion", "rpgartist": ["(Uncredited)"], "rpgproducer": ["(Uncredited)"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1419247.png", "usersrated": "0", "average": "0", "statistics": [], "rpg": ["d20 System / OGL Product (D&D 3.0 Compatible)", "Savage Worlds"], "rpgpublisher": ["Pinnacle Entertainment Group"], "rpgcategory": ["Sourcebook (rules/options to enhance play)"], "rpggenre": ["Generic / Universal"], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1419247_t.png", "description": "From Introduction:<br/><br/>There&rsquo;s a ton of D20 material available these days, and many players and Game Masters may want to make use of it.

Instead of an assault on Mexican fortifications east of the capital, Scott circled to the south where large lakes and a lava bed (the Pedregal) gave him numerous approach routes.

Masterminded by the French General-in-Chief Joffre, the offensive was intended both to draw German strength away from the reeling Russians and to pinch out the German salient (&ldquo;the Noyon Bulge&rdquo;) aimed at Paris. Launched with limited artillery support and using several raw New Army divisions, the ostensible aim of the British attack was to seize the German rail lines behind the front, but in reality was a diversion for the main French offensive in Champagne. The British player, with a massive numerical superiority and heavy artillery support, must progress quickly. Powerful German reserves are nearby,and the battle becomes a race between the British advance and the German reaction.<br/><br/>Loos uses a modification of the popular Fire &amp; Movement game system. Developed to portray the mechanized battlefields of a later generation, F&amp;M stresses the use of fire support to generate breakthroughs, followed by a rapid penetration by mobile reserves. At Loos, no one moved faster than a man on foot, and fire support was clumsy, unreliable, and inflexible. Thus the strength of that support is variable and serves as a precursor to combat rather than an enhancement of it.

It doesn&rsquo;t hurt that people had awesome looking clothing and took the time to put artistic flourish in their technology. In the nineteenth century there seemed to be more possible. Every inch of the globe was not documented by cameras on satellites. Electricity was still a primal force barely tamed that could work miracles. Steampunkfitters is about putting the pipes together. Connecting the people with the tech with the power of steam.<br/><br/>Steampunk is different things to different people. There is no one level of technology. There is no defined world that  tells us what proper steampunk is or how to identify when it has been done right or wrong. Because of that, Steampunkfitters doesn&rsquo;t set down a single story for the players to follow but provides the tools to start a new world with each new group of characters.<br/>    We do know that steampunk involves Victorian design ascetics and combining technology that seemed like it would be right around the corner. Things like airships, clockwork men and perhaps even deathrays were thought to be the next step in technology.<br/><br/>Why The Name Steampunkfitters?<br/>    A tradesman that works with steam pipes is called a steamfitter. In this game the players are putting together a story about the steam age with an emphasis on technology breaking through the culture of the day, thus the &ldquo;punk&rdquo;.

It features themed tour cards showing photographs of Bali, wild cards and wise and wicked monkey cards.  Kenakalan means 'mischief' in Indonesian.  There are 98 cards total.  The number of cards in play is adjusted to suit the number of players.  Play time is between 15 and 30 minutes.<br/><br/>Each player has a different-colored shop front on which to collect finished sets (tours).  The tours must be different in number and theme.   The first player to complete all of their sets is the winner.<br/><br/>Players can take one action during their turn.  At the beginning of the game, their choices are rearranging or taking cards from a central display of five cards or taking the top card off the deck.  Finished sets can be laid down at the end of a player&rsquo;s turn.  As the game progresses, players can use their action to pick up a completed tour.  On a subsequent turn they can lay it back down with additional cards to increase the size of that tour.<br/><br/>Wise monkeys, drawn from the deck, allow players to take two different actions in their turn, such as rearranging and then taking from the display.  Wise monkeys can be used immediately or kept for a more convenient time.

In the even that both teams reach 52 tricks during the same hand, the team that won the bid during the final hand is the winner.<br/><br/>Using a Pinochle deck (with no Jokers), the dealer deals 3 cards face down to each person, clockwise starting with the player to the left, until all cards have been dealt. Each player then picks up their hand and sorts the cards by suit and value. Jacks in the Trump Suit (known as &quot;Right&quot; Jacks) are the highest value, Jacks in the same color but different suit as Trump (known as &quot;Left&quot; Jacks, or &quot;Bowers&quot;) are second highest value cards, and opposite colored Jacks (no special name) are valued as normal. In all other suits, the Ace is the highest value with 9 being the lowest.<br/><br/>Each person bids only once, starting with the player to the left of the dealer, as an estimate of how many tricks they think they can take as a team (do not declare a suit, only a number). If the person bidding is the first person of the team, they may bid a &quot;signal bid&quot; to help their teammate bid higher (see below for signal bids). You may only bid if you bid higher than the person who bid before you. Otherwise you must say &quot;pass.&quot; After all 4 players have bid or passed, the highest bidder wins the power to pick the suit of trump (which affects the value of Jacks and of the trump suit). The bidder then starts by playing a card. If &quot;no trump&quot; is chosen, aces are the highest value of card, but the person to the right of the winning bidder starts. Unlike other games, such as Bridge, all suits are considered equal, except for that of trump, and the &quot;left&quot; Jacks.<br/><br/>As the first card is played, each player must follow suit if able (note: &quot;Left&quot; Jacks become the suit of trump and no longer qualify as being of their original suit. These Jacks are called &quot;Bowers&quot;). After each player has played a card, the highest card in the suit wins the trick. If you are unable to follow suit, you may play trump, which automatically becomes the winning suit. A higher trump card can win, but all players must follow the suit that was lead.<br/><br/>After the trick is taken, the player who took the trick may lead the next trick with the card of his/her choice. If you win the number of tricks you bid (or more), you team is awarded a point for each trick taken. The team that did not win the bid also receives a point for each trick taken. If the team that won the bid does not take enough tricks equal to or greater than the number bid, they are &quot;set.&quot; They receive a negative score equal to their bid. The other team is scored as normal.<br/><br/>Signal Bids:<br/>1-4 (I have X number of aces in my hand. If you have more than 4 aces, you should either bid 4 to signal aces or bid 6+ to win the bid and possibly choose &quot;no trump&quot; as the suit of power.)<br/>5 (I have at least 1 black and at least 1 red jack in my hand. This shows trump power/support to your partner if they are to win the bid and choose the suit of trump.)<br/>6-12 (I can take X number of tricks, but can only do so in my suit of choice. This is a bid that attempts to win the bid rather than signal your teammate. However, a bid of 6 shows your partner that you may have some Jacks, but they are of one color and you don't have much supporting power)<br/><br/>A winning bid is usually a 7 or 8 or an occasional 9 or 10 bid. 6 bids rarely win, and 11/12 bid hands are difficult to come by, though entirely possible.<br/><br/>Historical note: I have never found the name or rules for this game to be published in any book or website, and I have only ever found players of this game in the state of Minnesota, usually by elderly people in rural areas. It may be of Scandinavian or German heritage.<br/><br/>"}, "130754": {"poll": [], "name": "Hysteria", "videogamemode": ["Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["English/European Commodore 64 Cassette edition", "English/European Commodore 64 Disk edition", "English/European ZX Spectrum Cassette edition"], "average": "0", "videogametheme": ["Fantasy"], "usersrated": "0", "videogamedeveloper": ["Special FX Software"], "videogamegenre": ["Action", "Scrolling"], "videogameplatform": ["Commodore 64", "ZX Spectrum"], "statistics": [], "videogamepublisher": ["Software Projects"], "videogamecompilation": ["4 Most Big Hits"], "description": "From the back of the box:<br/><br/>Sometime, somewhere, someone is changing the future by altering our past.

With a mixture of deck-building mechanics and tableau management, Mr. Card Game is a fantasy adventure themed character building card game for 2 to 5 players ages 13 and up which plays in less than an hour.<br/><br/><br/>Synopsis<br/><br/>Each player begins with a deck of one point stats and a set of basic newbie gear. On your turn, you have the opportunity to select one of the monsters on top of the location draft piles to kill. By defeating a monster, you receive a new item (displayed on the reverse side of the monster card) to add to your tableau, a new stat card to add to your deck and meat tokens you can use on subsequent turns to draft skills. Once one or more of the players thinks they have accumulated enough power from killing monsters, upgrading stats and training skills to defeat the Naughty Sorceress, they may call a March of the Tower where all players have an opportunity to kill her together. They player with the highest power and enough to kill the Sorceress, wins.<br/><br/><br/>Strategy<br/><br/>The gameplay in Mr. Card Game is a hybrid of deck building and tableau management. Mr. Card Game is a game of drafting, not only drafting items and skills, but also the stat cards necessary to use those items and skills most effectively. You want to plot a course through the locations in the game which maximizes the synergy of the skill and item cards you draft into your tableau with the stat cards you draft into your deck. All the while managing your level of meat, the currency of the realm you acquire from killing monsters, which you need to purchase the skills which make you better. Tactically, the game relies upon your management of your tableau, when to use or sell items, and how effectively you craft the hand of cards necessary to defeat your target or perhaps even win the game.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": ["English first edition"], "average": "6.16577", "name": "Mr. Card Game", "playingtime": "60", "boardgamemechanic": ["Card Drafting", "Deck / Pool Building", "Hand Management"], "age": "13", "boardgameexpansion": ["158297", "158296"], "usersrated": "118", "boardgamesubdomain": ["Strategy Games", "Thematic Games"], "boardgamefamily": ["Crowdfunding: Kickstarter"]}, "130765": {"rpgdesigner": ["Dan Anderson", "Pieter Sleijpen"], "rpgitemversion": ["PDF version"], "rpgseries": ["Living Forgotten Realms", "SPEC - Living Forgotten Realms Core Special Adventures"], "name": "Rising Darkness", "rpgartist": ["(Uncredited)"], "rpgproducer": ["Claire Hoffman"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1421039.jpg", "usersrated": "0", "rpgsetting": ["Forgotten Realms"], "average": "0", "statistics": [], "rpg": ["Dungeons & Dragons (4th Edition)"], "rpgpublisher": ["Wizards of the Coast"], "poll": [], "rpgcategory": ["Scenario / Adventure / Module"], "rpggenre": ["Fantasy (High Fantasy)"], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1421039_t.jpg", "description": "From the first page of the PDF:<br/><br/>For years the tenuous peace between Netheril and Cormyr held.

On this, they are all agreed; on everything else, they are united only in their mutual contempt, jealousy, and suspicion. They are, in a word, writers.<br/><br/>And, being writers, all six are currently holed up in six Soho pubs, cadging free drinks, chatting up people half their age (but with, oddly, twice their looks), and complaining vociferously about their agents, about dumbing down in the publishing industry, and about how they didn&rsquo;t want that Eastenders gig anyway as it would have compromised their artistic integrity and also possibly involved buying a TV licence.<br/><br/>The noble editors&rsquo; thankless task is to contact all six writers and extricate their beer/sauvignon-stained prose from whichever unwholesome pocket or handbag it&rsquo;s been stuffed in. The first to do so scores a small moral victory or, to borrow a phrase from Monopoly, wins.<br/><br/>To get from one pub to the next the editors can walk, hail a cab, or grab a Boris Bike. Taxis are fast, but much of Soho is alleyways or paved, and it&rsquo;s not easy finding somewhere to pull up. Bikes are nippy, but what about those cobbles on Broadwick Street? &ndash; ouch!

Well, most players fall into that category, but one takes the role of marshal and tries to keep the other players honest.<br/><br/>During set-up, a money tile is placed in each bank, a poker tile in each city without a bank, and a stagecoach in a randomly-determined city. Each outlaw starts in a city, and the marshal has both a marshal token and a number of sheriffs equal to the number of outlaws, with these tokens starting wherever the marshal places them.<br/><br/>The game lasts five turns, with five movement cards played by each player in each turn. Each player has an individual hand of movement cards, including a &quot;Saloon&quot; card that allows a player to stay in the same location. The marshal moves the stagecoach, moves each sheriff (or leaves them in place), then the marshal and the outlaws alternate laying five face-down movement cards.

If an outlaw is in a location with his action disk, he can take that action &ndash; as long as more outlaws are present than sheriffs. (Players pool their money, so there's no dispute over which outlaw robbed a place.)<br/><br/>Once players finish their five movements, they pick up all their movement cards, the marshal replaces stolen tiles (and adds a second stagecoach in the second turn), and a new turn begins. If at the end of the game, the desperados have collected $4,000 or more per outlaw, then they win the game; otherwise the marshal wins as the outlaws &ndash; despite stealing huge amounts of funds &ndash; have not secured enough funds to guarantee their livelihood in their golden years.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "3", "boardgameversion": ["English/German first edition"], "name": "Desperados", "playingtime": "90", "boardgamemechanic": ["Co-operative Play", "Point to Point Movement", "Simultaneous Action Selection"], "average": "6.56181", "usersrated": "127", "boardgameaccessory": ["Desperados: Card Place Mat"], "age": "12"}, "130909": {"rpgartist": ["Andrew Barlow", "Andy Dimmit", "Gideon", "Kurt Metz", "Kevin Van Hook", "Carol Van Hook", "Christina Wald"], "rpg": ["Guardians RPG"], "statistics": [], "name": "Guardians: The Game of Heroic High Adventure", "rpgdesigner": ["Gideon", "James Perham"], "rpgproducer": ["J.

But beware, as your hold on the city increases, so does the chance of your plans being foiled by Gotham's protector &ndash; Batman!<br/><br/>During the game, players collect resources of information, money and threat; threat is used to exert your rule over blocks in Gotham City, and control of blocks allows you to collect income on these blocks of either information or money. Money is used for leveling and to hire henchmen who will help you rule city blocks and fight better against other villains and Batman. Information is used for leveling and moving your villain and henchmen through the city blocks. Leveling works as follows: Each villain has a combat dial with ten levels. Each click of the dial shows a requirement that you will need to advance to the next level: information, money, henchmen, or blocks controlled. The first player to reach level 10 with his villain wins. On every even number level, players will acquire special abilities unique to their villain.<br/><br/>Each turn a player will play a Criminal Plot card which will either produce an income for the ruler of a certain block or trigger the Bat Signal, which calls in Batman! When Batman moves into a block with a Villain, a fight occurs using the two custom Batman dice included with the game. If Batman wins, the villain and his henchmen must flee to their hideout and Batman restores order in that block of Gotham City; if the villain wins, they have defeated Batman (for the time being) and Batman returns to the Batcave, increasing his combat effectiveness as he plans for the next encounter.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": ["English first edition"], "average": "6.14332", "name": "Batman: Gotham City Strategy Game", "playingtime": "60", "boardgamemechanic": ["Area Control / Area Influence", "Campaign / Battle Card Driven", "Dice Rolling", "Grid Movement", "Point to Point Movement", "Variable Player Powers"], "age": "14", "usersrated": "666", "boardgamefamily": ["Clix", "Comics: DC Universe", "Superheroes"], "boardgamepodcastepisode": ["28.

furthermore, the idea of invading Greece through the Balkans, was not as easy as it looked.<br/><br/>It was only thanks to a major German commitment in the Mediterranean that operations swung in favor of the Axis and the name of Rommel became a legend. <br/><br/>It was also said that, by having to provide aid to the Italians in the Balkans, Germany diverted manpower that was needed in Russia and hence sowed the seeds of the Axis defeat in the East.<br/><br/>However, as soon as America was thrown into the war by the infamous Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor, the fate of the Axis was written in stone and defeat was only a matter of time.<br/><br/>BLOCKS IN AFRIKA recalls, in game form, the most decisive battles fought in the African Theater Front from the Italian drive to Marsa Matruh in Summer 1940, until the collapse of the Italian Regime in Semptember 1943.<br/><br/>BLOCKS IN AFRIKA is a game for two players, one controls the Western Allies and the other one controls the Axis Powers.<br/>Although based on history, players in command of the two factions can modify the evolution of World War 2 in the Mediterranean Theater.<br/><br/>RULES INTRODUCTION<br/>The rules are divided into three major sections which can be learned one at a time.<br/>The first section is the BASIC GAME RULES which introduces the basic concepts and enables players to start playing the game without too many rules to remember.<br/>Then the ADVANCED GAME RULES provide more specific and detailed rules for an enhanced realism, such as the use of Fuel and the Advanced Production System.<br/>Finally, for those players who want to get the best out of the game, OPTIONAL RULES can be added as desired.<br/>The Optional Rules include Technology Research, Strategic warfare over German factories and U-Boot Campaign in the Atlantic Ocean, Amphibious Invasions, Parachute Assaults&hellip;<br/><br/>SCALE<br/>A hexagon is approximately 53 miles (70 Km) across.<br/>A turn is 1 month long.<br/>A full strength counter represents 300 planes, 300 Tanks, or 30,000 men, depending on the type unit, equipment and nationality.<br/><br/>FOG OF WAR<br/>The game must be played with the Fog of War on (wooden blocks are placed on the map in such a way the opponent player can not see them).<br/><br/>Language: English, German, French, Spanish and Italian<br/>Genre: Operational, Strategic<br/>Turns: Turn-Based<br/>Complexity: Basic to Advanced, depending on which rules are used and on Scenario Lenght<br/>Period: World War II<br/><br/>SCENARIOS<br/>With over 240 units counters and 200 different resource points of various color, players can enjoy hours of fun by playing one of the ten BIA scenarios, one of the four 7-turn BIE scenarios (in cobination with BITE and BITW) or the gargantuan 1939 CAMPAIGN.<br/><br/>1940 Operation Compass, November 1940 - March 1941<br/>1941 Operation Exporter, June - July 1941<br/>1941 Middle- East Uprising, May - September 1941<br/>1941 Operation Marita-Merkur, April - June 1941<br/>1941 The Desert Fox, March - July 1941<br/>1942 Tobruk, June - October 1942<br/>1942  El Alamein, October 1942 - February 1943<br/><br/>NAVAL BATTLES <br/> Punta Stilo, 9 July 1940<br/> Capo Teulada, 27 November 1940<br/> Capo Matapan, 28-29 March 1941<br/> Harpoon, 21 June 1942<br/><br/>Every scenario has different Victory conditions and length, with a playing time from 1 to 2 turns.<br/><br/>BLOCKS IN AFRIKA can be played standalone or combined with Blocks in the West and Blocks in the East in one of the four 7 turn long BLOCKS IN EUROPE SCENARIOS:<br/><br/>1941 - LEBENSRAUM<br/><br/>1942 - AXIS HYPE<br/><br/>1943 - TIEBREAK<br/><br/>1944 - DOWNFALL<br/><br/>and the gargantuan  1939 CAMPAIGN: from Danzig to Hell <br/><br/>Microbadge: <br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": ["English Collectors edition", "English/Italian first edition"], "average": "8.67969", "name": "Blocks in Afrika", "playingtime": "60", "boardgamemechanic": ["Dice Rolling", "Hex-and-Counter", "Secret Unit Deployment", "Simulation"], "age": "14", "boardgameexpansion": ["168851", "168852", "168854", "168853"], "usersrated": "32", "boardgameaccessory": ["BLOCKS IN AFRIKA Goretex Map", "BLOCKS IN AFRIKA Icon Stickers"], "boardgamesubdomain": ["Wargames"], "boardgamefamily": ["Block wargames", "Blocks Series"]}, "130923": {"rpgdesigner": ["Christopher De La Rosa", "Ivan Van Norman", "Robert B.

L'accent est bien &eacute;videmment mis sur la Californie et sur ce qui reste des Etats-Unis (o&ugrave; il ne fait gu&egrave;re bon vivre en n'&eacute;tant pas blanc et/ou protestant), seules quelques lignes sont consacr&eacute;es au reste du monde. <br/>Puis direction les routes de Californie, qui vous feront d&eacute;couvrir le paysage et la situation locale (fort peu reluisante), depuis la fronti&egrave;re mexicaine jusqu'aux banlieues de LA, de San Francisco jusqu'au Nevada et Las Vegas, sans oublier l'&icirc;le d'Hawa&iuml;, fra&icirc;chement rattach&eacute;e &agrave; l'&eacute;tat libre californien. <br/>Enfin, pour clore le chapitre, deux pages de mise en bouche sur l'unit&eacute; COPS (les d&eacute;veloppements viendront quelques pages plus tard), qui explique le &quot;pourquoi&quot; officiel d'une telle structure polici&egrave;re.<br/><br/>Le second chapitre (Soutien logistique) est un vaste catalogue de la monstruosit&eacute; administrative qu'est le LAPD, la police de Los Angeles, et d&eacute;marre avec la description exhaustive de la totalit&eacute; des unit&eacute;s formant les forces de l'ordre de la ville, qu'elles travaillent sur le terrain ou derri&egrave;re un bureau. Chaque service est pr&eacute;sent&eacute; selon le sch&eacute;ma suivant : nom en anglais/en fran&ccedil;ais, nom et grade du responsable, attitude globale vis-&agrave;-vis du COPS. <br/>Le chapitre encha&icirc;ne avec une longue interview d'Andrew Noone, &quot;p&egrave;re fondateur&quot; du COPS qui a r&eacute;cemment disparu dans d'&eacute;tranges circonstances, et qui donne le ton au sujet de la vie r&eacute;elle au sein de la police et du COPS. Les pages qui suivent viennent compl&eacute;ter ce passage, en apportant de multiples informations au sujet du quotidien des policiers : recrutement, grille de salaire, cong&eacute;s, adh&eacute;sion syndicale, mutuelle, etc. Puis retour en arri&egrave;re : 11 des plus importantes unit&eacute;s de police (comprendre celles qui croiseront le plus souvent le chemin du COPS) sont de nouveau pass&eacute;es au crible et abondamment d&eacute;taill&eacute;es, avant d'attaquer avec les forces arm&eacute;es, les agences gouvernementales (rempla&ccedil;ant les anciennes structures f&eacute;d&eacute;rales telles que le FBI), les diff&eacute;rents services civils (pompiers, h&ocirc;pitaux, enseignement, etc.) et l'appareil judiciaire californien. <br/>Le chapitre se termine enfin sur le probl&egrave;me de la communication et de l'image de marque de la police, ainsi que sur les pr&eacute;rogatives des &quot;priv&eacute;s&quot;, qu'ils soient chasseurs de primes ou d&eacute;tectives.<br/><br/>Arrive enfin le syst&egrave;me de jeu et de cr&eacute;ation des personnages (Proc&eacute;dures d'engagement), o&ugrave; l'on pourra d&eacute;couvrir quelques r&egrave;gles optionnelles (notamment &quot;l'attitude&quot; du personnage lors d'un combat : jouera-t-il la carte de la prudence ou foncera-t-il t&ecirc;te baiss&eacute;e ?) et tableaux g&eacute;rant divers probl&egrave;mes : balles perdues, dommages collat&eacute;raux, d&eacute;g&acirc;ts particuliers (explosion, chute, noyade, etc.). <br/>Suivent deux proc&eacute;dures particuli&egrave;res, destin&eacute;es &agrave; simuler au mieux les diff&eacute;rentes poursuites (en voiture ou &agrave; pied) ainsi que les multiples techniques d'interrogatoire (avec le sacro-saint bon flic/sale flic), puis l'organisation des relations personnelles (selon deux modes : amis et indicateurs) et enfin les points d'exp&eacute;rience. <br/>Le chapitre se poursuit avec la liste des stages (destin&eacute;s &agrave; sp&eacute;cialiser et &agrave; donner de la bouteille aux personnages) et de leurs effets particuliers, r&eacute;partis en 3 niveaux ; puis avec une liste d'armes, de munitions et de protections ; avant de s'achever sur la partie consacr&eacute;e aux v&eacute;hicules policiers et civils, et &agrave; l'&eacute;quipement de dotation des cops et de certaines unit&eacute;s de police.<br/><br/>Le quatri&egrave;me chapitre (G&eacute;ographie sociale), apr&egrave;s une parodie du Journal de Bridget Jones, se pr&eacute;occupe du quotidien du citoyen lambda californien : nourriture, mode, religion, m&eacute;dias, loisirs, informatique, musique (avec en exclusivit&eacute; les paroles du dernier tube de Britney Spears, quinquag&eacute;naire &eacute;panouie !), avant de poursuivre avec les coulisses cach&eacute;es de la Californie - lobbies, drogues, fl&eacute;aux biologiques, pollution et sc&egrave;ne underground. <br/>La suite se charge de diss&eacute;quer l'imposant centre-ville de Los Angeles, district par district, v&eacute;ritable patchwork social o&ugrave; les plus riches et influents c&ocirc;toient sans jamais sourciller les plus pauvres &agrave; chaque minute : cette section vous d&eacute;voilera l'historique de chaque quartier et ses conditions de vie (sous l'angle &quot;carte postale&quot; puis sans les paillettes), les lieux incontournables, les personnalit&eacute;s qui tirent les ficelles et la criminalit&eacute; ambiante, les forces de police en pr&eacute;sence, etc. depuis les anciennes usines &agrave; r&ecirc;ve de Broadway aux trottoirs encombr&eacute;s de prostitu&eacute;es l&eacute;gales et mafieuses de Skid Row.<br/><br/>L'avant-dernier chapitre (Ressources humaines) est un vaste ensemble de personnalit&eacute;s de LA Downtown, toutes amen&eacute;es &agrave; c&ocirc;toyer les PJs un jour ou l'autre. Bien entendu, l'accent est plac&eacute; sur le commissariat central, au coeur des op&eacute;rations du LAPD, et notamment sur son 35e &eacute;tage, o&ugrave; r&eacute;side la principale unit&eacute; COPS - depuis le guichetier jusqu'au grand patron, nul n'est oubli&eacute;. Les civils ne sont pas en reste, qu'il s'agisse du vendeur de hot dogs plac&eacute; au pied du commissariat ou du supermarch&eacute; o&ugrave; vos personnages iront r&eacute;guli&egrave;rement faire le plein de junk food et autres abominations di&eacute;t&eacute;tiques n&eacute;cessaires au bon fonctionnement du service !<br/><br/>Il ne reste plus que le dernier chapitre (La femme de mon meilleur ami) : un bref sc&eacute;nario et une enqu&ecirc;te relativement simple, de mani&egrave;re &agrave; faire d&eacute;marrer vos joueurs en douceur. Vous pourrez y trouver quelques &eacute;l&eacute;ments class&eacute;s &quot;code bleu&quot; et &quot;code rouge&quot; : des &eacute;v&eacute;nements (faussement) anodins et des PNJs qui seront appel&eacute;s t&ocirc;t ou tard &agrave; &eacute;merger de nouveau voire &agrave; prendre de l'importance par la suite...<br/><br/><br/>Translation courtesy of Google:<br/><br/>The book is divided into six subsequent chapters, each starting with the presentation of a member of COPS (Central Organization for Public Security - the elite unit of the Los Angeles Police Department) through a full-page illustration and the new staging.<br/><br/>The first chapter (Global Geopolitics) first explains how the game evolves according to which, during four &quot;seasons&quot; to come (by season, means a year of publication of play equipment), then jumps directly to the storyline of the game - the team Siroz addresses an audience of gamers already tested and does not linger to explain what role-playing to beginners, contrary to the tradition of basic books . <br/>the three decades that separate us from California - now an independent nation - 2030 are analyzed from three angles: history / political, scientific advances (with a large section devoted to &quot;Network&quot;, the future of the Internet) and military situation. The emphasis is obviously placed on California and the rest of the United States (where it does little good to live in is not white and / or Protestant), only a few lines are devoted to the world. <br/>then towards the roads of California, you will discover the landscape and the local situation (little shiny) from the Mexican border to the suburbs of LA, San Francisco and Las Vegas to Nevada, not to mention the island Hawaii, freshly attached to the free state of California. <br/>Finally, to close the chapter, two pages mouthing the unit (PSC developments come a few pages later), which explains the &quot;why&quot; of a formal Such police structure.<br/><br/>The second chapter (Logistical Support) is a comprehensive catalog of administrative monstrosity that is the LAPD, the Los Angeles Police Department, and starts with a full description of all of the units forming the forces of the city, that of them working in the field or behind a desk. Each service is presented according to the following: name in English / French, name and rank of the person responsible, overall attitude vis-&agrave;-vis the PSC. <br/>chapter continues with a long interview with Andrew Noone, &quot;founding father&quot; of the PSC who recently disappeared under mysterious circumstances, and the tone about real life in the police and the PSC. The following pages complete this passage, providing extensive information about the daily police: recruitment, salary, leave, trade union membership, health insurance, etc.. Then return back: 11 of the most important police units (include those who cross the path most often PSC) are again scrutinized and thoroughly detailed before attacking the armed forces, government agencies (replacing former federal structures such as the FBI), the various civil services (fire brigade, hospitals, education, etc..) and the California judiciary. <br/>chapter finally ends the problem of communication and branding of the police, as well as the prerogatives of &quot;private&quot;, they are bounty hunters or detectives.<br/><br/>Finally comes the game system and character creation (Proceedings of engagement), where you can discover some optional rules (including the &quot;attitude&quot; of the character in combat: he will card caution or darken he bowed head?) tables and managing various problems: stray bullets, collateral damage, particular damage (explosion, falling, drowning, etc.).. <br/>followed by two special procedures, designed to simulate the most different proceedings (by car or on foot) and multiple interrogation techniques (with the sacrosanct good cop / dirty cop) and the organization of personal relationships (in two modes: friends and indicators) and finally points experiment. <br/>chapter continues with the list of courses (designed to specialize and give the bottle to the characters) and their specific effects, divided into 3 levels, then a list of weapons, ammunition and protection, before to complete the section on police vehicles and civilian equipment and staffing of cops and some police units.<br/><br/>The fourth chapter (Social Geography), after a parody of Bridget Jones's Diary, is concerned with the daily average citizen Californian food, fashion, religion, media, entertainment, computers, music (with exclusive words of the last tube Britney Spears, fulfilling fifties!) before continuing with the hidden scenes of California - lobbies, drugs, biological plagues, pollution and underground scene.<br/><br/>handles the following dissect the imposing downtown Los Angeles, district by district social patchwork where the most wealthy and influential rub shoulders without wincing poorer every minute: this section will reveal the history of each area and its living conditions (in terms &quot;postcard&quot; and without the glitter) key places, the people who pull the strings and ambient crime, the police involved, etc.. from the old dream factories Broadway sidewalks crowded with legal prostitutes and mafia Skid Row.<br/>The penultimate chapter (Human Resources) is a large cadre of Downtown LA, all brought to rub the PCs at one time or another. Course, emphasis is placed on the Central Police Station, in the heart of LAPD operations, including on the 35th floor, where lies the main unit COPS - from cashier to big boss, no one is forgotten. Civilians are not left out, whether the hot dog vendor located at the foot of the police or the supermarket where your characters will regularly make full of junk food and other dietary abominations necessary for the proper functioning of the service!<br/><br/>There remains only the last chapter (The wife of my best friend): a brief survey and a scenario relatively simple way to start your players smoothly. You can find some items classified &quot;code blue&quot; and &quot;red code&quot; events (falsely) and harmless NPCs who will be sooner or later to re-emerge even gain importance in the future ...<br/><br/>In addition to six chapters, the book will also offer numerous inserts: interviews, newspaper excerpts paper / computer, slice of life, advertising, law reports, urban legends - all of immerse yourself in the life of California 2030.

L'ouvrage est &eacute;maill&eacute; d'illustrations et d'encadr&eacute;s d'ambiance avec notamment (page 59) un lexique sur l'argot utilis&eacute; dans les rues de Los Angeles.<br/><br/>Le premier chapitre s'intitule 'G&eacute;ographie sociale' (61 pages - ou 'G&eacute;opolitique globale' si l'on en croit l'en-t&ecirc;te des pages qui le composent) et fait le tour des vingt-cinq quartiers et banlieues de Los Angeles (incluant les Channel Islands). Chaque quartier suit le m&ecirc;me d&eacute;coupage.<br/>Apr&egrave;s l'introduction on trouve ainsi d&eacute;crits les centres d'int&eacute;r&ecirc;t principaux du secteur (A voir, &agrave; faire), ses endroits caract&eacute;ristiques (Lieux typiques), la description des forces en pr&eacute;sence - polici&egrave;res (Forces de police) ou criminelles (Opposition) - ainsi qu'un r&eacute;sum&eacute; chiffr&eacute; des statistiques du quartier : population, niveau de vie, pollution, zones commerciales, industrielles et r&eacute;sidentielles, criminalit&eacute;, d&eacute;lits mineurs, pr&eacute;sence polici&egrave;re et coop&eacute;ration avec les forces de l'ordre.<br/><br/>Le deuxi&egrave;me chapitre porte le titre de 'Gestion des conflits' (80 pages) et d&eacute;crit les diff&eacute;rentes formes de criminalit&eacute; en vigueur dans la cit&eacute; des anges. Chacune des sept premi&egrave;res parties du chapitre s'attarde sur un type de criminalit&eacute; : urbaine, des ghettos, mafieuse, scientifique, religieuse, id&eacute;ologique et financi&egrave;re. Pour chacune de ces sous-parties sont d&eacute;taill&eacute;es plusieurs formes de crimes ; on retrouvera ainsi aussi bien les tueurs en s&eacute;rie que les gangs latinos ou les Hell's Angels, les trafiquants de produits high-tech, les pollueurs ou les yakusa que les int&eacute;gristes chr&eacute;tiens. Au total, ce ne sont pas moins d'une trentaine de factions qui sont pr&eacute;sent&eacute;es - sans compter les subdivisions (les caract&eacute;ristiques des gangs des Crips ou des Bloods par exemple).<br/>Les sept parties ne suivent pas de plan commun mais on retrouve g&eacute;n&eacute;ralement l'historique de chaque forme de criminalit&eacute;, son activit&eacute;, ses acteurs, les trucs &agrave; savoir.<br/>La huiti&egrave;me et derni&egrave;re partie du chapitre revient sur les caract&eacute;ristiques des criminels en expliquant tr&egrave;s bri&egrave;vement le c&ocirc;t&eacute; technique d'un personnage non-joueur.

Subtitled 'Season 1 - July 2030', this book describes the city of Los Angeles for two chapters before registering a scenario in the timeline of the game in the third and final chapter. The book is peppered with illustrations and boxes including mood (page 59) a lexicon of slang used in the streets of Los Angeles.<br/><br/>The first chapter is entitled 'Social Geography' (61 pages - or 'Global Geopolitics' if one believes in the header of the pages that compose) and toured twenty-five neighborhoods and suburbs of Los Angeles (including the Channel Islands). Each district follows the same division. <br/>Following the introduction there are thus described the main interests of the sector (see, what to do), its characteristic places (Places typical), the description of forces - Police Forces ( police) or criminal (Opposition) - as well as summary statistics encrypted Neighborhood population, standard of living, pollution, commercial, industrial and residential crime, petty crime, police presence and cooperation with law enforcement .<br/><br/>The second chapter deals with the title of 'conflict management' (80 pages) and describes the various forms of crime in force in the city of angels. Each of the first seven games of the chapter focuses on one type of crime: urban ghettos, mafia, scientific, religious, ideological and financial. For each of these sub-sections are described several forms of crimes you'll run both serial killers that gangs Latino or Hell's Angels, traffickers of high-tech polluters or yakuza that Christian fundamentalists. In total, no less than thirty factions that are presented - excluding subdivisions (the characteristics of gangs Crips or Bloods for example). <br/>'s seven parts do not follow a common plan but generally found the history of each type of crime, its business, its actors, things to know. <br/>The eighth and final section discusses the characteristics of criminals briefly explaining the technical side of a non-player character. NPCs and have less hit points, no adrenaline or seniority and can be equipped with skills called 'Styles', corresponding to more specific stereotypes from TV shows or video games: Anti-heroes, Berserk , End Boss level, human shield, G-Style, Speed.<br/><br/>The third and final chapter concludes the book on a script calling itself 'A Week in Hell' (26 pages). Potential players should not read the following description in order not to spoil the fun of the game<br/><br/>In fact it is a rather two scenarios and a draft third nested to give players a sense of continuity.

La premi&egrave;re partie de ce suppl&eacute;ment (&quot;la Fronti&egrave;re&quot;) se pr&eacute;sente comme un stage gracieusement offert &agrave; nos chers cops par leurs coll&egrave;gues des douanes - le CCS : Californian Customs Service.<br/><br/>Premi&egrave;re &eacute;tape, la pr&eacute;sentation de ce vaste organe - tentaculaire devrait-on dire, au vu de son sigle officiel : l'Hydre. Apr&egrave;s une pr&eacute;sentation des dirigeants du service, vous d&eacute;couvrirez les diff&eacute;rentes branches constituant le CCS : douanes terrestres, maritimes, a&eacute;riennes et informatiques, relations ext&eacute;rieures, bureau des normes, d&eacute;tachement du SAD, et bien d'autres encore. A cela, ajoutez encore la description des multiples QG du CCS, les moyens et proc&eacute;dures l&eacute;gales des diverses branches, quelques l&eacute;gendes urbaines et portraits de PNJ, ainsi que deux nouveaux stages pour policiers apprentis matelots.<br/><br/>Deuxi&egrave;me &eacute;tape : le terrain. L'a&eacute;roport International de LAX, la fronti&egrave;re mexicaine, la rivi&egrave;re Colorado, les r&eacute;seaux informatiques sont autant de champs de bataille pour les douaniers. Vous apprendrez ici comment fouiller une voiture de fond en comble et avec quels moyens, comment op&eacute;rer un abordage (avec de nouvelles r&egrave;gles consacr&eacute;es &agrave; tout ce qui flotte sur les eaux californiennes, accompagn&eacute;es des tables de crash-test ad&eacute;quates), quel est le r&ocirc;le de l'arm&eacute;e dans tout ce fatras, quelles sont les cadences d'un poste-fronti&egrave;re, tout en d&eacute;couvrant les relations entre services (douanes et K9, gardes-c&ocirc;tes et marine nationale, etc.) et les innombrables saisies que renferment les entrep&ocirc;ts titanesques du CSS.<br/><br/>Troisi&egrave;me &eacute;tape : les fronti&egrave;res. Depuis la S&eacute;cession, le Mexique n'est plus le seul probl&egrave;me californien, loin de l&agrave;... Entre la &quot;Safe Line&quot; avec l'Union o&ugrave; les militaires s'&eacute;chauffent par moments, le probl&egrave;me &eacute;pineux du Nevada (territoire de l'Union ou de la Californie, qui saurait le dire ?), et Hawa&iuml;, les forces de l'ordre ne manquent gu&egrave;re de pain sur la planche ! Dans cette section, vous obtiendrez un briefing complet et fort peu glamour sur les &icirc;les d'Hawa&iuml; aux mains de la mafia japonaise, sur les territoires mexicains bordant la fronti&egrave;re avec la Californie et l'Union, o&ugrave; les patrons nord-am&eacute;ricains se font une joie d'exploiter la population, et sur la poubelle qu'est devenue Las Vegas. Pour terminer, retour en Californie avec le tableau de la population nomade : marginaux, hippies, indiens et pillards qui sillonnent les vastes d&eacute;serts de la jeune r&eacute;publique.<br/><br/>Cette partie sur le travail des douanes ne saurait &ecirc;tre compl&egrave;te sans mat&eacute;riel sp&eacute;cialis&eacute; : 4x4, motos, hors-bords, vedettes viennent clore ce chapitre. On trouve en plus de petits encadr&eacute;s &quot;couleur locale&quot; : situation internationale de la Californie, PNJ d&eacute;traqu&eacute;s, gangs, g&eacute;ographie, etc.<br/><br/>A la suite du chapitre sur les fronti&egrave;res, vous pourrez trouver un long sc&eacute;nario &quot;Staying alive&quot; pr&eacute;vu pour modifier en profondeur l'univers de COPS. En effet, au terme de cette enqu&ecirc;te et d'une excursion au Canada, qui vous vaudra un expos&eacute; sur la situation de la Belle Province et sur ses liens avec la Californie, ce n'est rien de moins que la cr&eacute;dibilit&eacute; de la r&eacute;publique face &agrave; l'Union qui sera en jeu !<br/><br/>A pr&eacute;sent, passons &agrave; la seconde partie de ce suppl&eacute;ment : &quot;la Drogue&quot;, sa fabrication, son commerce, sa distribution, ses effets plus ou moins d&eacute;sirables, ses acteurs, ses victimes et la r&eacute;action de la police (COPS, NADIV et DEA californienne).<br/>Les premi&egrave;res sections sont consacr&eacute;es &agrave; la provenance de la drogue, comprenez les cartels d'Am&eacute;rique du Sud et le Triangle d'or asiatique, sans oublier les individus qui tirent les ficelles (et les marrons du feu). Des relations avec les diff&eacute;rentes mafias et gouvernements locaux jusqu'aux moyens d'infiltrer la drogue en Californie, de la corruption des officiels jusqu'aux pantins au service des syndicats du crime, vous saurez tout des enjeux du sinistre trafic de la poussi&egrave;re d'ange. Au vu de tous ces &eacute;l&eacute;ments, si vous pensez pouvoir encore faire barrage aux barons de la drogue, vous &ecirc;tes bon(ne) pour l'asile - ou pour le LAPD !<br/><br/>La lecture se poursuit avec un catalogue exhaustif des drogues actuellement sur le march&eacute;, en partant des grands classiques que sont l'h&eacute;ro&iuml;ne, le PCP et le Quetz, pour en arriver aux substances in&eacute;dites un tant soit peu &quot;exotiques&quot; pour le junky de LA : Red Chasm, Lapin de Mars, Venus-08, avec leurs effets, leurs variantes, leurs formes, leurs contrecoups, leurs lieux de consommation, etc. Idem avec les drogues dites &quot;de masse&quot; : Joker, Ice, Boue-Bayou et autres. Ici, la situation est d'autant plus grave pour la police qu'une certaine partie de l'opinion publique ne voit pas ou plus o&ugrave; est le mal...<br/><br/>Naturellement, les forces de l'ordre ont leur mot &agrave; dire &agrave; travers la lutte anti-drogue : mat&eacute;riel, stages sp&eacute;ciaux de la DEA et de la NADIV, relations entre services, guerres des polices, communication avec le public. Vos policiers pourront rapidement se familiariser avec le &quot;milieu&quot;, en d&eacute;couvrant son argot, ses consommateurs-types (du lyc&eacute;en au yuppie quadrag&eacute;naire), ses crack-houses et fumeries, le tout suivi de plusieurs 10-18 : des petites enqu&ecirc;tes plus ou moins longues et complexes selon la r&eacute;action des cops, &agrave; ins&eacute;rer dans vos sc&eacute;narios, entre deux intrigues principales.<br/><br/>Pour terminer le chapitre sur la drogue, reste un sc&eacute;nario : &quot;Mort &agrave; Venice Beach&quot;. Entre la mort violente d'un jeune inspecteur des stups et la vague de meurtres sanglants d'un serial killer qui terrorise tout LA (le tout &eacute;galement agr&eacute;ment&eacute; d'encarts 10-18), l'unit&eacute; COPS va conna&icirc;tre cinq longues journ&eacute;es d'intense activit&eacute; pour mettre un semblant d'ordre au sein de LA !<br/><br/>Et enfin, pour clore ce suppl&eacute;ment, trois annexes :<br/><br/>     &quot;LAPD Blues&quot; : la vie quotidienne du 35e &eacute;tage du Central, avec ses hauts et surtout ses bas, vue &agrave; travers les yeux d'Isaac, le jeune livreur muet familier &agrave; tous les cops.<br/>     Revue de presse : des extraits tir&eacute;s de journaux californiens, am&eacute;ricains, suisses, sud-africains, canadiens et italiens afin de r&eacute;sumer la situation locale comme internationale : potins salaces, &eacute;lections, &eacute;conomie, attentats, et autres sujets habituels.<br/>     Reste un errata d'une page, pour corriger les erreurs et coquilles du livre de base.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Translation courtesy of Google:<br/><br/>The First Supplement to PSC, Friends of LA , was attached to the description of the City of Angels and its periphery, it is now time to address longer horizons! The first part of this supplement (&quot;Frontier&quot;) is presented as an internship graciously offered to our dear fellow cops by Customs - CCS: Californian Customs Service.<br/><br/>First step, the presentation of this vast body - sprawling should say, given its official acronym: Hydra. After a presentation of the leaders of the service, you will discover the different branches constituting the CCS: Customs land, sea, air and computer, External Relations, Bureau of Standards, detachment of SAD, and many others. To this, add more description of multiple HQ CCS, resources and legal procedures of the various branches, some urban legends and portraits of NPCs, as well as two new courses for police trainees sailors.<br/>Second step: the ground. LAX International Airport, the Mexican border, the Colorado River, the networks are many battlefields for customs. Here you will learn how to search a car thoroughly and with what resources, how to operate a collision (with new rules dedicated to everything that floats on water in California, accompanied by tables of suitable crash test), what is the role of the army in all this stuff, what are the rates of a border post, while discovering the relationship between services (customs and K9, Coast Guard and Navy, etc..) and countless entries that contain warehouses titanic CSS.<br/><br/>Third stage: the borders. Since the Civil War, Mexico is not the only problem in California, far away ... Between the &quot;Safe Line&quot; with the European Union where the military are heated at times, the thorny issue of Nevada (Union territory or California, who can tell?), And Hawaii, the forces of the order seldom fail to cut out! In this section, you will get a full briefing and very little glamor in the Hawaiian Islands in the hands of the Japanese mafia, the Mexican territories along the border with California and the European Union, where North American bosses are one joy to exploit the population, and what has become the garbage Las Vegas. Finally, back in California with the table of the nomadic population: marginal, hippies, Indian and looters who roam the vast deserts of the young republic.<br/><br/>This part of the work of customs would be complete without special equipment: 4x4, motorcycles, outboard, celebrities come to close this chapter. Found more small boxes &quot;local color&quot; international situation of California, NPC deranged, gangs, geography, etc..<br/><br/>Following the chapter on the borders, you will find a long story &quot;Staying Alive&quot; expected to radically change the world of PSC. Indeed, at the end of this survey and a trip to Canada, which will earn you a briefing on the situation of La Belle Province and its relationship with California, it is nothing less than the credibility of the republic face the Union will be at stake!<br/>Now turn to the second part of the supplement: &quot;Drug&quot;, manufacture, trade, distribution, effects more or less desirable, its actors, its victims and the police response (COPS, DEA and Nadiv California).<br/><br/>The first sections are devoted to the origin of the drug cartels understand South America and the Golden Triangle Asian, not to mention the people who pull the strings (and chestnuts from the fire). Relationships with the various mafias and local governments to the means to infiltrate the drug in California, the corruption of officials in service to the puppets crime syndicates, you know all of the issues of traffic accident dust of angel. In view of all these elements, even if you think you can make the dam drug lords, you are good (not) for asylum - or for the LAPD!<br/><br/>Playback continues with a comprehensive catalog of drugs currently on the market, from classics such as heroin, PCP and Quetz, to arrive at novel substances so slightly &quot;exotic&quot; for junky LA Red Chasm, Bunny Mars, Venus-08, with their effects, variants, their forms, their aftermath, their places of consumption, etc.. Same with drugs called &quot;mass&quot; Joker, Ice, Mud Bayou and others. Here, the situation is even more serious for the police that some of the public does not see or where more evil ...<br/><br/>Naturally, the police have their say through the anti-drug, equipment, special courses DEA and Nadiv, relations between services, war policies, communication with the public. Your police can quickly familiarize themselves with the &quot;middle&quot;, discovering its slang, its consumer-types (from high school to yuppie forties), his crack-houses and opium dens, all followed by several 10-18: small surveys or more less lengthy and complex according to the reaction cops to insert into your scenarios, two main plots.<br/><br/>To conclude the chapter on drugs, a scenario is &quot;Death in Venice Beach.&quot; Between the violent death of a young inspector DEA and the wave of bloody murders of a serial killer who terrorizes all LA (all also decorated inserts 10-18), the unit will know COPS five long days of intense activity to bring a semblance of order in LA!<br/><br/>And finally, to conclude this supplement, three appendices:<br/><br/>     &quot;LAPD Blues&quot;: the life of the 35th floor of Central, especially with its ups and downs, as seen through the eyes of Isaac, the silent young deliveryman familiar to all cops.<br/>     Press: extracts from newspapers Californian, American, Swiss, South African, Canadian and Italian to summarize the situation local and international: salacious gossip, elections, economy, attacks, and other usual subjects.<br/>     Rest of errata page to correct errors and shells basic book .<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>"}, "130934": {"poll": [], "name": "Navigator", "playingtime": "0", "minplayers": "3", "boardgamemechanic": ["Trick-taking"], "yearpublished": "0", "usersrated": "5", "maxplayers": "6", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1426225_t.jpg", "average": "6.26", "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["Fontis Games"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1426225.jpg", "boardgameversion": ["Fontis Games first edition"], "maxplaytime": "0", "boardgamecategory": ["Card Game"], "age": "8", "minplaytime": "0", "description": "This is trick-taking game.

Who will strike first?<br/><br/>Norway 1940 is a ziplock expansion for PQ-17 that adds all the British, French, Polish, and German naval and air units needed to re-fight this tense air-naval battle, including such seldom-seen ships and aircraft as the repair ship HMS Vindictive, German Type II U-boats, Blackburn Skuas and Rocs, and early Ju88 heavy fighters.  Special rules reflect the unique conditions of the campaign, such as Scandinavian neutrality, Norwegian coastal defenses, faulty German torpedoes, shore bombardments, and Allied establishment of a forward naval base (historically in the Lofotens).  And just as in the parent game, secretly determined special conditions offer new opportunities and threats to both sides.  Will the British pre-empt the German invasion?  Will the Germans attempt to break out into the Atlantic with their heavy ships?  Will the Allies elect to stay in Narvik instead of evacuating with the fall of France imminent?  Or will the Germans make a daring attempt to seize Iceland before the Allies can occupy it in force?<br/><br/>Norway 1940 includes three operational scenarios highlighting key periods of the campaign.  Operation WESER&Uuml;BUNG covers early April 1940, with both sides attempting to land ground forces in neutral Norway.  Operation SICKLE covers the second half of the month, as the Allies counter-attack after the successful German invasion.  And Operation JUNO depicts the end of the campaign in early June, when the Germans attempt to interfere with the Allied offensive on Narvik, unaware that the Allies have already decided to evacuate (or have they?).  Plus a 1940 Campaign scenario allows players to refight the entire 10-week campaign, including a semi-abstract system for ground operations that will ultimately decide victory in the game.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": ["First edition"], "average": "6.33333", "name": "Norway, 1940: A PQ-17 Expansion", "playingtime": "210", "boardgamemechanic": ["Card Drafting", "Dice Rolling", "Hex-and-Counter", "Simulation"], "age": "14", "boardgameexpansion": [], "usersrated": "3", "boardgamefamily": ["Block wargames"]}, "130959": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1954665.jpg", "poll": [], "boardgamedesigner": ["James M.

It has diplomatic, economic, technological and military components, and can be won by gaining economic hegemony or  technological supremacy (A-bomb), or by vanquishing a rival militarily.<br/><br/>The 22 x 34 area map covers Eurasia to India and the Urals, plus the Americas. Military units are 5/8&quot; blocks, of 7 types   (Infantry/Tank/Fortress/AirForce/Carrier/Fleet/Submarine), in 7 different colors (Germany/Italy/Russia/Britain/France/USA/Neutral). The mix of over 200 blocks allows great flexibility of force composition. There is a 55-card Action deck and a 55-card Investment deck, plus 30 Peace Dividend chits and 110 markers of various types.<br/><br/>The  game starts in 1936, with all 3 Great Powers virtually disarmed: Germany has repudiated the Versailles Peace Treaty, initiating an arms race in Europe. With blocks, the nature of military buildups remain unknown to rivals unless/until military conflict breaks out. The  game may end peacefully or there may be war. There are game sanctions for attacking neutral minors or declaring war on an opponent, and rewards for remaining peaceful (you get a Peace Dividend chit of value 0-2 for every year you remain at Peace).<br/><br/>You can win peacefully by:  <br/>&bull; Economic Hegemony (total of Production + secret Peace Dividend values + Atomic Research is the greatest in 1945, or reaches 25 at any time) OR <br/>&bull; Technological Supremacy (build the A-bomb which takes 4 stages and be able to deliver it to a Main Capital).<br/><br/>If there is war, you can still win by either of the above methods (with extra Economic Hegemony victory points available), or by:<br/>&bull; Military Victory (capture TWO enemy capitals out of nine: each player controls three).<br/><br/>Economic production underlies all forms of power in the game. Production is the LEAST of controlled Population (cities), controlled Resources, and Industry (which starts low and can be built up with Investment cards), except that Resources can be ignored if at Peace.<br/><br/>Powers can spend their current economic Production on either: <br/>&bull; Military units (new 1-step units or additional steps on existing units), OR <br/>&bull; Action cards, which have Diplomatic values (to gain Population and Resources without conflict) and a Command value (to move military units), OR <br/>&bull; Investment cards, which have Technological values (to enhance unit abilities) and a Factory value (the only way to increase Industry levels).<br/><br/>Building a unit step or buying a card costs 1 Production. Simple. You can&rsquo;t inspect cards bought until after you have spent all Production.<br/><br/>Initially, the Axis economy is Population/Resource limited, but ahead in [war] Industry, while the West and Russia are Industry-limited, with adequate empires of Population and Resources. Throttling/limiting rival economies by denial of Population/Resources is a key form of competition. In peacetime, this is primarily done via Diplomacy, committing Action cards to gain control of minor nations and their Population/Resources, or to deny or reduce Rival control of them. At war, this can be done more directly by military conquest on land, by Naval/Submarine blockade of trade routes at sea, and by Strategic Bombing of enemy Industry by air forces.<br/> The early phase of the game tends to revolve around: <br/>&bull; Diplomatic  infighting (using Action cards), to gain minor nations (Czech, Rumania, etc) for their Population and Resources, and <br/>&bull; Industrial buildup (via  Investment cards), with<br/>&bull; Military buildups (with the nature of forces being built being unknown to opponents),<br/>&bull; Technology  advancement (also via Investment cards), and some<br/>&bull; Military operations (using Action cards for Command), which can include Violating (attacking) neutral minors to gain Population/Resources when Diplomacy fails.<br/><br/>If  the game continues peacefully due to imposing defenses or player inclination, pressure builds as players approach a Production of 20, as secret Peace Dividend chits may take someone over the 25 Victory threshold. Or players may succeed in developing the Atomic Bomb and steal a victory that way.<br/><br/>At  some point, however, one Power (seeing opportunity or necessity) may Declare War on another. The victim gets immediate economic benefits in reaction, but military reality comes to the forefront from this point onward. The third party may well continue its economic development in peace. Or not.<br/><br/>Unit movement is by Command card, which specifies a Command Priority letter that determines order of movement/combat and a Command Value number that  determines the maximum number of units that can be moved. Command cards are only valid during one specified Season (Spring/Summer/Fall), so a variety of Command cards in one&rsquo;s hand is necessary for a Power to be able to move in every Season. But HandSizes are limited, so each player must balance competing demands for card resources with military security.<br/><br/>Combat occurs when rival units occupy the same area, and is executed by units firing in order by Type (defenders firing first amongst equal types), rolling dice for hits. Units have different Firepowers (hit values) depending on the Class of unit they are  targeting (ground, naval, air, sub). Land combat is one round per Season while sea battles are fought to a conclusion. Ground units without a Supply line lose 1 step per Season and cannot build (except Fortress units which are immune to both effects but cannot move).<br/><br/>Triumph &amp; Tragedy is a true three-sided game: there is no requirement that the West and Russia be on the same side (and in fact there are valid reasons to attack each other), and only ONE player can win the game. Table talk is allowed (and encouraged) but agreements are not enforceable. Alliances are shifting and co-operation is undependable. The game can continue as an economic battle of attrition or a sudden military explosion can change everything. There is immense replayability as players can pursue dominance in Europe via land, sea or air military superiority, technological supremacy, or economic hegemony without rivals realizing their strategy until it is TOO LATE! It is a highly interactive, tense, fast-moving game with little downtime between player turns, covering THE crucial geopolitical decade of the 20th century in 4-6 hours.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": ["First edition", "Second edition"], "average": "8.38287", "name": "Triumph & Tragedy", "playingtime": "240", "boardgamemechanic": ["Area Control / Area Influence", "Area Movement", "Campaign / Battle Card Driven", "Dice Rolling", "Hand Management", "Secret Unit Deployment"], "age": "12", "usersrated": "893", "boardgamesubdomain": ["Wargames"], "boardgamefamily": ["Block wargames"], "boardgamepodcastepisode": ["Heavy Cardboard Episode 32 \u2013 Argent: The Consortium", "Heavy Cardboard Episode 39 \u2013 Top 50 Favorite Games of Right Now", "Heavy Cardboard Episode 52 &ndash; Amanda&rsquo;s Top 50 &amp; Edward&rsquo;s Top 50", "I've Been Diced! episode 71: Mutants, game studies, and 2015 in review", "Podcast #104 - Juegos o juguetes"]}, "130961": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1625965.jpg", "poll": [], "boardgamedesigner": ["N\u00e9stor Romeral Andr\u00e9s"], "statistics": [], "yearpublished": "2013", "maxplayers": "4", "boardgameartist": ["N\u00e9stor Romeral Andr\u00e9s"], "boardgamepublisher": ["nestorgames"], "maxplaytime": "15", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1625965_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "15", "boardgamecategory": ["Abstract Strategy", "Puzzle"], "description": "Octalion, an expansion for Heptalion, includes eight new domino-like tiles (with a new symbol) and a game board featuring a special board configuration that has the following properties:<br/><br/><br/>     Each symbol is shown exactly 9 times.<br/>     Each domino is shown exactly 3 times.<br/>     There are exactly 72 squares; the same number of squares that compose the 36 tiles.<br/><br/><br/>The first board configuration with the above properties was found by Mark Tilford.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": ["English first edition"], "average": "7.125", "name": "Octalion", "playingtime": "15", "boardgamemechanic": ["Tile Placement"], "age": "0", "boardgameexpansion": [], "usersrated": "8", "boardgamesubdomain": ["Abstract Games"], "boardgamefamily": ["Combinatorial", "Dominoes"]}, "130963": {"rpgdesigner": ["Alfredo \"D.

But if anyone asks you, here&rsquo;s the cover story...<br/>I&rsquo;m one lazy mofo. Actually, that&rsquo;s not it, although I do have (what I like to call) a selective work ethic. The main reason for the delay can be tied to three factors. For a while, I just utterly lacked the inspiration to do a new Handybook. I finally got the druthers to work on it, though, and it came along great...until hard drive troubles erased it and I lost all my work. Needless to say, this was a bit discouraging&mdash;factor number one. Factor number two is Vassar College, which I am now attending and which takes up enough of my time that I like to utilize my free time by just not working (on anything, including the Handybook). Finally, FASA, bless their hearts, released a string of books (e.g. Awakenings, SR 3rd Ed., Magic in the Shadows) that kept me on my toes more than expected. Gotta&rsquo; stay on the bleeding edge...<br/>So finally, with the much appreciated (grumble, grumble) prodding of friends, I decided to just buckle down and do a new edition. Granted, this &lsquo;buckling down&rsquo; has still taken, well, quite a while, but so it goes. Oh, and it&rsquo;s now version 1.0 because, as of SR3, physical adepts are now adepts.

Players follow directions provided on the game board to form completed boxes and capture the most amount space.<br/><br/>The board is 13x13 one inch squares (totaling 169 spaces)each with its own arrows allowing for movement of a specific direction up, down, left or right, or a combination of those movements.<br/><br/>At the beginning of the game each player rolls a die to determine who will place their game piece first (lower number places first higher number places second but moves first). As players exit a tile they place a marker turned to their color on the board. Players must follow the directional arrows in the spaces trying to form a completed box (2x2 or greater). Once you have formed a completed box you are allowed to move freely in that space assuming you can get to the box using directional arrows on the board. If a completed box is fully encircled by the opponents color markers the box is turned to that players markers. You may not move through an opponents completed box. If you move through an opponents marker that is not in a completed box turn it to your color (you must follow the directions of the arrows under the marker). If at any time you find that you have no legal moves you move your game piece to another location on the board and your remaining moves are forfeit.<br/><br/>Each round players roll a single die and the combined roll is the movement allotment for the turn.  Players alternate first position each round eliminating the &quot;first-player advantage&quot;.<br/><br/>The game ends when neither player has a valid move that they can take.<br/>  <br/>The aesthetics of the game are meant to give you that old-timey feel.

Joyeux No&euml;l LA ! Comme le titre l'annonce, ce troisi&egrave;me suppl&eacute;ment est bien entendu consacr&eacute; aux multinationales et syndicats du crime, qui ne demandent gu&egrave;re qu'&agrave; faire main basse sur la Californie - tout en r&eacute;v&eacute;lant quelques &quot; anomalies &quot; de l'univers, &agrave; commencer par l'influence mystique de certains objets ou personnages.<br/> Le premier chapitre, &quot; Honorables soci&eacute;t&eacute;s &quot;, pr&eacute;sente sept mafias d&eacute;j&agrave; entrevues dans Saison 1-1 (Juillet 2030): Amiti\u00e9s de Los Angeles, ainsi qu'une organisation bas&eacute;e sur le crime informatique et enfin une faction noyautant la petite municipalit&eacute; de Bellflower, bien trop paisible pour &ecirc;tre honn&ecirc;te...<br/>Chaque section reprend le mod&egrave;le suivant : tout d'abord un historique qui vient expliquer le &quot; pourquoi &quot; de chacune de ces mafias, puis un &eacute;tat des lieux (r&eacute;partition des membres en Californie, domaines d'influence, ressources humaines et mat&eacute;rielles, alliances, rapports avec les autres mafias) ainsi que l'organisation propre &agrave; la mafia. Une fois l'organisation diss&eacute;qu&eacute;e, reste &agrave; voir quels sont ses objectifs prioritaires et secondaires, ses futurs projets, ses missions en cours, ses sp&eacute;cificit&eacute;s en mati&egrave;re criminelle (monopoles et &quot; sp&eacute;cialit&eacute;s maison &quot;), ses rites et coutumes. Derniers &eacute;l&eacute;ments : la pr&eacute;sence exacte de la mafia au sein de Los Angeles, et enfin le &quot; fichier &quot; : pour chaque branche majeure d'une mafia (Old Ones, Equipiers, N&eacute;o-Corl&eacute;onnais pour les Italo-am&eacute;ricains ; Autoritet, Vory et Baba Yaga pour les Slaves ; clan traditionnel, clan rebelle et freelances pour les yakusa ; et ainsi de suite), le MJ dispose des portraits des gros bonnets et de plusieurs de leurs hommes de main et assistants, accompagn&eacute;s des habituels codes rouges et bleus selon les cas.<br/><br/>     A tout seigneur tout honneur, le premier chapitre est naturellement consacr&eacute; &agrave; la tr&egrave;s m&eacute;diatique mafia italo-am&eacute;ricaine, aujourd'hui scind&eacute;e en trois blocs le plus souvent oppos&eacute;s : les Old Ones, nouveaux riches et parvenus qui s'&eacute;chinent &agrave; s'entourer d'une aura de respectabilit&eacute; (et pourquoi pas &agrave; conqu&eacute;rir plusieurs si&egrave;ges politiques, la mairie de LA n'&eacute;tant pas des moindres) ; les Equipiers de &quot; l'Outfit &quot;, vieux gangsters essouffl&eacute;s qui ont rat&eacute; le coche (sans quoi ils seraient &eacute;galement devenus des Old Ones) et en sont rest&eacute;s aux &quot; bonnes vieilles m&eacute;thodes &quot; brutales, aussi bien menac&eacute;s par la concurrence que par le cholest&eacute;rol, mais qui n'ont pas encore dit leur dernier mot ; et enfin les dangereux N&eacute;o-Corl&eacute;onnais, des jeunes loups fanatiques qui ont d&eacute;cid&eacute; de combattre violemment les deux entit&eacute;s pr&eacute;c&eacute;dentes, jug&eacute;es corrompues, &agrave; l'aide d'un retour aux valeurs siciliennes et catholiques d'antan, tout en suivant leur code d'honneur &agrave; la lettre. Comme d'habitude, dans la gamme COPS, le tout est accompagn&eacute; de plusieurs encarts destin&eacute;s &agrave; &eacute;claircir certains points en particulier : psychologie de tel groupe ou individu, place des femmes, codes et langages des signes, ce que cache tel personnage, etc.<br/>     Apr&egrave;s les Italo-am&eacute;ricains, viennent les Russes, G&eacute;orgiens, Tch&eacute;tch&egrave;nes et Caucasiens de l'Organizatsiya. R&eacute;put&eacute;s (&agrave; juste raison) pour leur ultra-violence, les Slaves sont &eacute;galement scind&eacute;s en trois branches antagonistes : les Russes de l'Autoritet, descendants fortun&eacute;s des cadres de l'ex-Union Sovi&eacute;tique et de l'Arm&eacute;e Rouge, pour lesquels le passage du Rouble au Dollar ne semble avoir pos&eacute; gu&egrave;re de probl&egrave;me, aujourd'hui regroup&eacute;s au sein du quartier de Little Mockba, au nord de Van Nuys ; les Caucasiens anarchistes des Vor v Zakone, largement implant&eacute;s dans les milieux syndicalistes et portuaires, avec pour fiefs les axes routier et la banlieue de Staline Town, &agrave; Palos Verdes ; enfin, l'intrigante Baba Yaga, mi-secte mi-mafia, actuellement en plein essor, misant sur le fanatisme de ses soldats, cosaques et agents infiltr&eacute;s pour engloutir sans plus tarder les deux branches ci-dessus, peu importe les moyens.<br/>     Au tour des mafias asiatiques : Triades chinoises et Yakusa japonais, deux organisations d&eacute;j&agrave; ancestrales et implant&eacute;es de longue date sur la c&ocirc;te ouest. Peu nombreux, mais solidement structur&eacute;s et disposant de larges ressources financi&egrave;res et mat&eacute;rielles - notamment gr&acirc;ce aux nombreuses entreprises nippones locales ainsi qu'au &quot; bastion &quot; de Hawa&iuml; - les riches Japonais se complaisent &agrave; manipuler le pays dans l'ombre et &agrave; se fa&ccedil;onner une image de marque irr&eacute;prochable, inondant la Californie de produits, de modes et de culture japonaises ; mais leur app&eacute;tit d'ogre risque de les perdre un jour o&ugrave; l'autre, d'autant plus que l'opposition interne (agac&eacute;e par le machisme et le caract&egrave;re f&eacute;odal des yakusa traditionnels) commence &agrave; gronder et &agrave; se f&eacute;d&eacute;rer... De leur c&ocirc;t&eacute;, les Chinois ont pr&eacute;f&eacute;r&eacute; rompre avec leur terre natale - &agrave; l'inverse des Japonais - sans pour autant renoncer &agrave; leurs traditions : l'int&eacute;gration &agrave; l'am&eacute;ricaine... Leur fief de Chinatown ne suffit plus &agrave; contenir les triades : les Chinois commencent &agrave; lorgner sur les quartiers adjacents, profitant d'un &quot; mat&eacute;riau humain &quot; plus qu'abondant - apr&egrave;s une guerre avec les yakusa, un conflit avec les latinos semble d&eacute;sormais in&eacute;vitable. Naturellement superstitieux, les Chinois s'unissent &agrave; l'aide de serments mystiques et se d&eacute;signent &agrave; l'aide de chiffres porte-bonheur, faisant r&eacute;gner leur loi sur terre et sur mer &agrave; l'aide de leur arme f&eacute;tiche : le tranchoir - mais leur attachement au pass&eacute; ne doit en aucun cas faire oublier que les Chinois savent diablement innover, loin de l&agrave;...<br/>     Poursuivons avec les Cartels sud-am&eacute;ricains, d&eacute;j&agrave; largement &eacute;voqu&eacute;s dans le chapitre &quot; Drogue &quot; du suppl&eacute;ment Saison 1-2 (Ao\u00fbt/Sept. 2030): Lignes Blanches. Insaisissables, en d&eacute;pit de deux guerres d'usure avec le g&eacute;ant nord-am&eacute;ricain (la troisi&egrave;me s'annonce bient&ocirc;t : cf. &quot; LAPD Blues &quot; en fin de fiche), aujourd'hui parvenus &agrave; un pacte de non-agression, les cartels battent le rappel pour relancer le commerce de poussi&egrave;re d'ange, suivis de pr&egrave;s par le Mexique - les quelques personnes s'opposant &agrave; cette reconqu&ecirc;te finissant t&ocirc;t ou tard par alimenter le march&eacute; des organes humains... Ici, on r&egrave;gne par la brutalit&eacute; et le pot-de-vin : peu importe l'honneur (du moins, la notion qu'en ont les mafias), les Cartels n'en ont que faire.<br/>     Pour ce qui est des Indiens et des Pakistanais, le terme de &quot; mafia &quot; para&icirc;t presque superflu, tant les rangs de l'organisation sont l&acirc;ches. En d&eacute;pit du conflit nucl&eacute;aire entre Inde et Pakistan, les deux communaut&eacute;s ne se sont pourtant pas saut&eacute; &agrave; la gorge l'une de l'autre, gr&acirc;ce &agrave; la volont&eacute; d'un seul homme - v&eacute;ritable instance supr&ecirc;me &agrave; lui seul - le myst&eacute;rieux Roi des Singes. Dispers&eacute;s dans tout LA, discrets et laborieux, les Mouches indiennes vivent du trafic d'informations et de la solidarit&eacute; au sein de la communaut&eacute;, tout en ma&icirc;trisant certains des innombrables petits m&eacute;tiers offerts par le cin&eacute;ma (le mythe de &quot; Bollywood &quot; a bon dos), tandis que les Chariots pakistanais fournissent entrep&ocirc;ts loin des yeux de la police et marchandises &quot; tomb&eacute;es du camion &quot; - &agrave; force de para&icirc;tre insignifiants, personne (&agrave; commencer par les cops) ne s'int&eacute;resse &agrave; leur petit man&egrave;ge...<br/>     Retour &agrave; l'Ancien Continent avec les Irlandais, qui forment d'une certaine mani&egrave;re les &quot; petits nouveaux &quot; du domaine mafieux californien, abandonnant leurs racines et leurs vieilles aspirations nationalistes au passage. Les anciens terroristes se sont reconvertis dans deux sp&eacute;cialit&eacute;s qu'ils sont loin de m&eacute;conna&icirc;tre : les bras (mercenaires, hommes de main, tueurs &agrave; gages) et les armes (dernier cri comme anciennes, avec la Russie et les entrep&ocirc;ts de l'arm&eacute;e pour stocks d'armes) - mais cela n'emp&ecirc;che pas certains de r&ecirc;ver &agrave; un Nouvel Homme celte et de marcher sur les plates-bandes de l'extr&ecirc;me droite.<br/>     Avant-derni&egrave;re section, Network Mafia : les jeunes hackers bouffis d'id&eacute;aux des ann&eacute;es 1980 et 1990 ont aujourd'hui vieilli - et laissent craindre le pire. Dans un univers o&ugrave; l'information vaut tout l'or du monde, les hackers ont troqu&eacute; leurs ambitions libertaires pour un tout autre projet : se remplir les poches et former une sorte de mercenariat informatique, soigneusement hi&eacute;rarchis&eacute; et compartiment&eacute; (les maquilleurs cachent ou camouflent les donn&eacute;es et transferts sensibles ; les intruders jouent les filles de l'air et d&eacute;robent des donn&eacute;es physiques ; les hackers et crackers poursuivent leur r&ocirc;le mythique d'antan). Mettre la main sur ces malfaiteurs s'av&egrave;re d'autant plus ardu qu'ils ont depuis longtemps int&eacute;gr&eacute; les plus grandes compagnies informatiques, ainsi que l'arm&eacute;e et le gouvernement. Seulement, la Network Mafia n'a pas encore atteint sa maturit&eacute; - ses objectifs ne sont pas encore clairement d&eacute;finis et les t&ecirc;tes pensantes du groupe h&eacute;sitent quant &agrave; la philosophie &agrave; adopter : se contenter de devenir une &quot; organisation libre &quot; (doux euph&eacute;misme pour une mafia comme une autre), ou tout bonnement constituer un Etat informatique dont ils seraient les ma&icirc;tres absolus ?<br/>     Et enfin, at last but not at least, Copland : Bellflower est probablement l'un des secteurs de LA les plus s&ucirc;rs - nombreux sont les policiers &agrave; vivre l&agrave;-bas et &agrave; veiller au grain en permanence, assist&eacute;s d'une puissante milice citoyenne quelque peu port&eacute;e sur le &quot; White Power &quot;... Or, afin de mieux surveiller les criminels et leurs agissements, quoi de mieux si ce n'est de les contr&ocirc;ler et de d&eacute;cider qui deale quoi et &agrave; qui ? Une bien &eacute;trange conception de la &quot; police de proximit&eacute; &quot;.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Le seconde section de ce suppl&eacute;ment, &quot; Affaires en cours &quot;, vient aussit&ocirc;t proposer trois sc&eacute;narios en rapport avec le th&egrave;me des Affranchis.<br/><br/>     Pizza C4-Fromages &amp; Chianti .12 : alors que la campagne des municipales bat son plein et qu'une commission s'&eacute;chine &agrave; d&eacute;signer qui sera l'heureux candidat d&eacute;sign&eacute; pour le remodelage urbain de Little Italy, le commissariat du secteur signale la d&eacute;couverte de deux cadavres en bien pi&egrave;tre &eacute;tat- l'un policier, l'autre mafieux. Le SAD est sur les dents, mais ce sera aux cops de faire le m&eacute;nage - et vite...<br/>     Samovar Party : bataille autour des &eacute;ch&eacute;ances &eacute;lectorales syndicales sur les docks de Palos Verdes, tandis que certains mafieux italiens d&eacute;cident de faire leur come-back et de montrer aux Russes qui est le patron. Avec trois cadavres sur le dos d'entr&eacute;e de jeu et la menace d'un blocus du port, les cops ne sont pas pr&ecirc;ts de toucher leurs RTT.<br/>     Game Over : le premier sc&eacute;nario officiel &agrave; lorgner fortement du c&ocirc;t&eacute; du cyberpunk, avec pour point de d&eacute;part les charmantes usines gris&acirc;tres de &quot; la Tumeur &quot; (alias Norwalk) ainsi que les univers virtuels ludiques, tandis que Los Angeles s'attend &agrave; la visite de la pr&eacute;sidente du Mexique voisin. Et si les jeux-vid&eacute;os &eacute;taient r&eacute;ellement dangereux, en fin de compte ?<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Enfin, pour terminer, voici l'annexe &quot; LAPD Blues &quot; qui accompagne traditionnellement tout suppl&eacute;ment :<br/><br/>     Tout d'abord une nouvelle, qui vient compl&eacute;ter un r&eacute;cit d&eacute;marr&eacute; dans le livre de base, autour de deux cops infiltr&eacute;s dans ce panier de crabes qu'est le milieu de la haute-finance ;<br/>     Puis une rubrique &quot; Vie du commissariat &quot; : si vous saviez comme les langues peuvent se d&eacute;lier au 35e &eacute;tage du Central, autour d'une machine &agrave; caf&eacute; soumise &agrave; rude &eacute;preuve - seulement, les murs ont des oreilles... ;<br/>     Et enfin une revue de presse internationale, depuis la d&eacute;claration de guerre de l'Union &agrave; la Colombie jusqu'aux potins toujours aussi croustillants de l'ineffable &quot; Indiscret &quot;, qui se d&eacute;lecte cette fois-ci de la vie priv&eacute;e des cinq candidats pour les municipales de LA - shocking !<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Translation courtesy of Google:<br/><br/>With this supplement, the timeline of the universe forward a little more and the year 2030 ends, with still much uncertainty about the elections that punctuate life in Los Angeles ... Merry Christmas LA! As the title says, this third supplement is of course dedicated to multinational crime syndicates, which require little to make off California - while revealing some &quot;anomalies&quot; of the universe, starting with the mystical influence of certain objects or characters.<br/> The first chapter, &quot;Honourable companies,&quot; mafia already has seven interviews Friendships Los Angeles , and an organization based on computer crime and finally a faction infiltrating the small town of Bellflower, too quiet to be honest ...<br/>Each section contains the following pattern: first comes a history explain the &quot;why&quot; of each of these mafias, and an inventory (distribution of members in California, areas of influence, human and material resources, alliances, relationships with other mafia) and self-organization of the Mafia. Once the organization dissected remains to be seen what its priorities and secondary future projects, its missions, its specific criminal (Monopolies and &quot;house specialties&quot;), its rites and customs. Last elements: the presence of the exact mafia in Los Angeles, and finally the &quot;file&quot; for each major branch of the mafia (Old Ones, Crew, New Corl&eacute;onnais for Italian-Americans; Autoritet, Vory and Baba Yaga for the Slavs, traditional clan, clan rebel and freelances for the Yakuza, and so on), the DOJ has portraits of several bigwigs and their henchmen and assistants, along with the usual codes as red and blue case.<br/><br/>     In Honour where honor, the first chapter is devoted to the naturally high-profile Italian-American mafia, now divided into three blocks most often opposed: the Old Ones, and reached new rich that tries to surround himself an aura of respectability (and why not to win several seats policies, the mayor of LA is not least) the Crew of the &quot;Outfit&quot; breathless old gangsters who missed the boat (otherwise they would also become Old Ones) and remained in the &quot;good old ways&quot; brutal, both threatened by the competition of cholesterol, but have not yet said its last word, and finally the dangerous New Corl&eacute;onnais, the young wolves fanatics who decided to fight violently previous two entities, deemed corrupt, with a return to the values \u200b\u200band Sicilian Catholic past, while following their code of honor to the letter. As usual, in the range COPS, all comes with several inserts intended to clarify some points in particular: the psychology of such a group or individual, role of women, codes and sign languages, which cover such a character, etc..<br/>     After the Italo-Americans are the Russians, Georgians, Chechens and Caucasians of Organizatsiya. Deemed (rightly) for their ultra-violence, Slavs are divided into three branches antagonistic Autoritet the Russians, descendants of wealthy executives of the former Soviet Union and the Red Army, for which the passage of the Ruble to Dollar seems to have posed little problem, now grouped in the neighborhood of Little Mockba, north of Van Nuys; Caucasians anarchists Vor v zakone widely implanted in trade union circles and port, with fiefs and the main road on the outskirts of Stalin Town, Palos Verdes, and finally, the intriguing Baba Yaga, mid-mid-mafia sect, now thriving, capitalizing on the bigotry of his soldiers, Cossacks and undercover agents to swallow without further delay the two branches above, regardless of means.<br/>     At the turn of the mafias Asian: Chinese Triads and Japanese Yakuza, two organizations already traditional and long-established on the west coast. Few, but firmly structured with large financial and material resources - thanks to the many Japanese companies as well as local &quot;bastion&quot; of Hawaii - rich Japanese delight to handle the country in the shadow and carve out a branding reproach, inundating California products, patterns and Japanese culture, but their appetite ogre risk losing a day when the other, especially the internal opposition (and annoyed by machismo the feudal character of traditional yakuza) begins to rumble and to federate ... For their part, the Chinese have chosen to break with their native land - unlike Japan - without sacrificing their traditions integration into the American ... Their stronghold of Chinatown is no longer sufficient to contain triads: the Chinese are beginning to ogle the adjacent neighborhoods, taking advantage of a &quot;human material&quot; qu'abondant more - after a war with the Yakuza, a conflict with Latinos now seems inevitable . Naturally superstitious, Chinese unite using oaths and mystical means using lucky numbers, making their rule law on land and sea with their gun fetish: the cutting board - but their attachment to the past must not be forgotten that if the Chinese know damn innovate, far away ...<br/>     Continuing with the South American Cartels, already widely discussed in the chapter &quot;Drugs&quot; supplement white lines . Elusive, despite two wars of attrition with the giant North American (third looks soon: cf. &quot;LAPD Blues&quot; at end of sheet) today reached a pact of non-aggression, cartels fight the recall to boost trade with angel dust, followed closely by Mexico - some people opposed to the reconquest ending sooner or later supply the market of human organs ... Here, we rule by brutality and the pot of wine: whatever honor (at least, the notion that the mafias have), the Cartels have only done.<br/>     Regarding Indians and Pakistanis, the term &quot;mafia&quot; seems almost superfluous, as the ranks of the organization are loose. Despite the nuclear conflict between India and Pakistan, the two communities have not yet jumped on the throat of one another, by the will of one man - a true supreme alone - the mysterious King Monkey. Scattered throughout LA, discreet and industrious Indian Flies live traffic information and solidarity within the community, while keeping some of the countless small businesses offered by the cinema (the myth of &quot;Bollywood&quot; is still good ), while Pakistani trucks provide storage out of sight of the police and goods &quot;fell of the truck&quot; - to force seem insignificant person (starting with the cops) is interested in their little game ...<br/>     Back to the Old Continent with the Irish, who are in some way the &quot;new kids&quot; domain mafia California, leaving their roots and old nationalist aspirations in the process. The former terrorists have turned in two specialties they are far from ignored: the arms (mercenaries, thugs, killers) and weapons (latest as old, with Russia and the army warehouses stockpiles) - but this does not prevent some dream of a New Man Celtic and walk on the beds of the extreme right.<br/>     The penultimate section, Mafia Network: Young hackers puffy ideals of the 1980s and 1990s are now old - and let fear the worst. In a world where information is worth all the gold in the world, hackers have swapped their libertarian ambitions for another project: to fill their pockets and form a sort of mercenary computer thoroughly hierarchical and compartmentalized (hide or camouflage makeup artists and transfers data sensitive the intruders are the daughters of the air and steal data physical hackers and crackers continue their mythic role of yesteryear). Get your hands on these criminals is all the more difficult they have long been integrated into the larger computer companies, as well as the army and the government. Only the Network Mafia has not yet reached maturity - its objectives are not yet clearly defined and the brains of the group unsure of philosophy to adopt: simply become a &quot;voluntary organization&quot; (euphemism for mafia as another), or simply be a state computer they are absolute masters?<br/>     And finally, at last but not at least, Copland: Bellflower is probably one of the sectors of THE safest - many officers to live there and to ensure grain permanently assisted by a powerful militia Citizen somewhat focused on the &quot;White Power&quot; ... However, to better monitor criminals and their actions, what better if it is to control and decide who deale what to whom?

The SAD is on the teeth, but it will be the cops to clean up - and fast ...<br/>     Samovar Party: battle over union elections on the docks of Palos Verdes, while some Italian mafia decided to make their comeback and show the Russians who's boss. With three corpses on the back from the outset and the threat of a blockade of the port, the cops are not willing to touch their RTT.<br/>     Game Over: the first official scenario strongly to ogle the side of cyberpunk, with the starting point of the charming gray factories &quot;Tumor&quot; (aka Norwalk) and virtual worlds play, while Los Angeles is expected to visit of the President of neighboring Mexico.
