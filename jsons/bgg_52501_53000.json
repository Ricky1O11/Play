The capital city of the Efreeti is favorable situated near the convergence of the Elemental and Prime Material Planes. It is this crossroad which have afforded the city great opportunities to grow as wealthy as it has, even as they have provided the city with many of the threats it has faced over the millennia.<br/><br/>Nothing can prepare the traveler for the sight of the luminous reddish-gold mountain of smoke, flames, and brass in the distance. The foreboding City of Brass sprawls over a great volcano that retches forth a tongue of lava that flows steadily into the distance. The flames it expels reflect off the haphazard brass walls and surrounding domes that loom upward dominating the skyline. In this wondrous fusion of nature and architecture is another marvel to behold. Soaring above the city, perched on the edge of three precipices, lies the Sultan's Palace. It soars high above the dark, toxic clouds that ring the volcano. It is flanked by lesser towers which rise above the city's many enormous domes. It glows maliciously, as if it were a translucent vision of the mind.<br/><br/>The City of Brass awaits bold adventurers. Be forewarned that you enter an ancient society of byzantine political machinations. Those travelers whose minds lack the sharpness of their blades will find themselves ill-armed. Not all is as it seems.<br/><br/>This campaign supplement provides the experienced GameMaster with a treasure trove of information to extend his campaign world to an entirely new plane of existence.

It tells how during the Godswar, in the land which is now called Dragon Pass, Orlanth was almost slain by one of the vile Chaos Gods that rose from the Void and threatened to extinguish all life in the world. To the Orlanthi, this is a foul lie. Yet to a minor, lone cult of the barbarians, it is a terrible truth and a secret shame &ndash; a secret they guard forever.<br/><br/>The God Learners have learned a shard of this hidden truth. Arch-sorcerers of the Alliance have mastered a ritual that can use the blood of the wounded Storm God to achieve their own unknowable ends, perhaps even rewriting history and altering the life of Orlanth himself. But the blood must come from this secret myth. Jrustelan agents make their way to Dragon Pass now, seeking to prise the secret legend from the Orlanthi that live there.<br/><br/>Delecti the Inquirer, the traitorous sorcerer, is aware of his former brethren&rsquo;s machinations. He employs his own agents, Dragonspeakers and mercenaries allied to the Empire, to watch over the conquered Orlanthi of Dragon Pass and ensure the God Learners do not learn the full truth of this legend.<br/><br/>In every battle there is a crucial moment: a fulcrum upon which all hope and despair balance. It is in that moment that the fate of each conflict is decided. It is down to the Player Characters to forestall disaster by any means necessary. If they are successful, only then can they defeat the God Learners&rsquo; ambitions before the sorcerers enter the Hero Plane and steal a god&rsquo;s blood.<br/><br/>This adventure is designed for use with any of three factions - the Player Characters can be Orlanthi barbarians, or God Learner agents, or warriors of the Empire of Wyrm Friends. Each chapter in this adventure presents the same events and challenges from three different perspectives. If using this adventure with existing characters, they should be trusted allies or sworn mercenaries for one of those three factions. The adventure assumes that characters are at least seasoned adventurers at the start of the campaign. If the characters are already seasoned (or even more experienced), then the Games Master will need to adjust the number of foes and the difficulty of the tasks to challenge his players.<br/><br/>In the first section, Revelation, the scene is set. A clash is coming between the barbarians and the Wyrm Empire. Orlanthi villages on the edge of EWF territory are becoming rebellious, and the actions of the characters can sway the loyalty of these border tribes one way or the other, favouring the rebels or the Empire. As the characters travel from town to town, they begin to learn of a secret cult that preserves a myth that is not told by the Orlanthi, a story that speaks of Orlanth's death in his battle with Sh'kaharzeel, the Great Dragon.<br/><br/>The second section, Insurrection, puts the characters in the heart of this doomed Orlanthi rebellion against the EWF. Depending on their actions in the first section, the rebellion may put back the expansion of the EWF by decades, preserving Heortling culture and freedom for generations, or it may be swiftly crushed. Either way, the characters have a chance to become heroes - or traitors. They also learn more of the secret cult.<br/><br/>In the final section, Devastation, the characters enter into a HeroQuest of the battle of Orlanth and Sh'kaharzeel, and their actions on the Hero Plane will shape the future not only of the Heortlands, but of all the world. If the God Learners can gain control of this myth, then their bizarre <br/>myth-magic will give them immense power over the foundations of both the Orlanthi and EWF cultures.

Iceland sits on the edge of the frozen sea, its people clinging to the coastal lowlands while the interior is still the realm of the giants, trolls, spirits and fantastic beasts. On the civilized mainland creatures of legend may rarely show themselves, but in Iceland they rarely hide. Within Europe the Order of Hermes holds absolute magical dominion, but Icelandic magicians go about their business unaware of the Order of Hermes, its magi and their pretensions. These Norse wizards concern themselves with the politics of spirits, warding against troll raids and wresting a good growing season from Iceland's capricious weather.<br/><br/>Land of Fire and Ice gives your troupe the opportunity to explore this wondrous land ruled by the law, rather than by a king. Magicians live in harmony with their mundane neighbors, but feuds bubble under the veneer of civilization.<br/><br/>Included in Land of Fire and Ice are:<br/><br/>* A detailed description of Iceland's mundane and mystical landscape, culture and law<br/>    * Two major saga outlines and many story seeds<br/>    * Two magical traditions unique to Iceland, the galdramen and the trollsons<br/><br/>"}, "52595": {"rpgdesigner": ["Thomas Finn", "Rainer Gladys", "Bernhard Hennen", "Thomas M.

Its heroes achieve power by questing for runes, physical manifestations of the eternal abstract forces that shape its destiny. Eventually they graduate to even more powerful magics, learning to gain power by emulating the deeds of the gods, mastering the arcane formulae of the sorcerous arts, allying with spirits, or achieving meditative awareness of life&rsquo;s unknowable secrets. In doing so, they draw on one or more of the mythic Otherworlds surrounding their everyday material world. With the right magic, they can travel to the realms of the gods, become participants in their ancestral myths, and return with wondrous new abilities. Those who fail these daunting tests may be diminished, destroyed, or eternally lost in the mythic realms.<br/><br/>Explorers, adventurers and kings aren&rsquo;t the only ones who wield magical power here. Ordinary people practice their own spells and charms, helping them to feed, clothe and shelter themselves in what would otherwise be a hostile environment.<br/><br/>Glorantha is a world of clashing cultures, where good and evil aren&rsquo;t always easy to sort out. Though cursed with more than its share of tyrants, monsters, and villains, no single one of its cultures maintains a monopoly on virtue. Two warring cultures can be, from their own point of view, equally right &mdash; or equally ruthless and brutal. Cultures differ on the right way to live, the true events of myth and history, and the very purpose of existence. And that&rsquo;s just the humans: its inhuman races follow their own alien agendas, as laid out at the beginning of time.<br/><br/>In its glorious Second Age, Glorantha is the prize of warring empires. Two empires, more similar than they&rsquo;d like to admit, vie for ultimate dominance. The God Learner Empire seeks to crack open and the very secrets of the gods, manipulating them to their own ends. The Empire of Wyrm&rsquo;s Friends works to transform its land and people into a gigantic, mystical dragon, which will take flight and reshape the entire world.<br/><br/>The Second Age is a time of unprecedented discovery and exploration. For the first time, trade and travel allows the interaction of far-flung cultures. Both Empires innovate feverishly, unveiling new forms of magic, new devices, new modes of perception.<br/><br/>Against this backdrop of unfettered progress, dark omens gather. Men have pushed the Glorantha&rsquo;s eternal laws of myth and magic to the breaking point. How long will it be before the world strikes back at them, punishing their unprecedented hubris?<br/><br/>"}, "52685": {"rpgdesigner": ["Jason Carl", "Richard Dansky", "Laurah Norton", "Dave Perry"], "rpg": ["The Long Night"], "statistics": [], "name": "The Long Night", "rpgartist": ["Jonathan Rhea", "Larry Snelly"], "rpgproducer": ["Richard Dansky", "Larry Snelly", "Cynthia Summers"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic535658.jpg", "usersrated": "0", "rpgitemversion": ["PDF version", "Soft Cover"], "rpgsetting": ["World of Darkness (cWoD Dark Ages)"], "average": "0", "rpgissuearticle": ["Combined Disciplines for the Long Night"], "rpggenre": ["History (Medieval)", "Horror (Supernatural)"], "rpgpublisher": ["White Wolf Publishing (White Wolf)"], "rpgcategory": ["Core Rules (min needed to play)"], "poll": [], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic535658_t.jpg", "description": "From back of book:<br/><br/>&quot;There Are Centuries Left Before Dawn.<br/><br/>The year is 1197.

We are accustomed to the image of dragons through the representations created by numerous cultures throughout the world. According the people of different places, the dragon can be, alternatively, a synonym of courage, a power symbol or a solar cycle allegory. They are found in the coat of arms, on flags and popular fables. Sometimes they are intriguing and clever, others are faithful companion and ally. Always appears exultant of grandeur and power, and possessing some hidden wisdom, forbidden to humans.<br/><br/>In Catalonia, however, the most usual is to find the image of the &quot;Drac&quot;, the dragon, fighting with a paladin who will win, if the dragon is not already dying at his feet. And in Catalonia, the dragon represents the enemy, the evil, the devil in person. He is an evil spirit and better do not make any deals or alliances with him. He expires or destroy us. In these pages you will find many kinds of DRAGONS. None, I fear, is like players are guessing.<br/><br/>Dracs is the first regional Aquelarre supplement, and is dedicated to Catalonia. Here you will find all the information needed to better set your stories in Catalonia: historical information on the geography, society and political tensions of the time, a bestiary of creatures indigenous, traditions and customs of ancient magic, popular legends applicable to the game, shorter adventures and a campaign set in the eastern Mediterranean, Despertaferro, as well as a detailed description of Barcelona city at the time.<br/><br/>Dracs Aquelarre is a supplement for Aquelarre, the demonic medieval roleplaying game and can not be played without it.&quot;<br/><br/>From the back of the book.<br/><br/>______________________________________________________________<br/><br/>&quot;Dragones.

Siempre se nos aparece exultante de grandeza y poder&iacute;o, y en posesi&oacute;n de cierta sabidur&iacute;a oculta, vedada a los humanos.<br/><br/>En Catalu&ntilde;a, sin embargo, es muy dif&iacute;cil encontrar una imagen del &quot;Drac&quot;, el DRAG&Oacute;N, en la que no est&eacute; luchando contra el palad&iacute;n que lo va a vencer, si no es que est&aacute; ya agonizante a sus pies.

These realm regents, as they can be called, rule the land of Cerilia - not just a guild holding or a magical source, not a holy temple or enforcers of the law - but the land itself. Tied to Cerilia by their birthrights and their bloodlines, they govern the continent's realms and people. <br/>This, then, is the book for them - a tome of information directed at realm regents, the men and women who govern the land. They might be warriors, priests, wizards or thieves, but they influence the events of Cerilia and draw its everchanging map boundaries.<br/><br/>A realm regent probably has at least one law holding to his name, or he likely won't be a realm regent for long. because of this fact, The Book of Regency also discusses law domains and issues related to their rulership.<br/><br/>"}, "52875": {"rpgdesigner": ["Carrie A.

For each point over 12, the player will add 1. Sometimes the result will require consulting a success probability table, requiring another role on percentile dice.

Maintaining good ties with your chosen god allows your character to learn special magics or to receive visions of other places, provides him with trusty companions in a cut-throat world, and may even give him the chance for divine intervention to escape a tight spot. In many ways Glorantha has a depth and consistency unparalleled in gaming.<br/><br/>This major supplement explores religions useful in and designed for fantasy settings. Starting with the most primitive ancestor worship, the book progresses through tribal deities of nomadic barbarians, the intricacies of more civilized cults, and the horrors of chaos. All cultists receive broad benefits from their divine relations, but some deities specialize in a certain activity or area, such as a war god or a chaos god. Non-human religions include an elf cult and numerous troll cults.<br/><br/>This book offers over 100 Rune and Battle magic spells and skills not in the standard rules, handy for the gamer intent on long-living characters. The wealth of conceptual material can be applied to any role-playing game. Referees will enjoy the many new lines of thought; dozens of examples of tribal behavior and custom can make any encounter more realistic. Excerpts from the The Travels of Biturian Varosh and The Reminiscences of Paulis Longvale suggest many scenarios while providing local color.<br/><br/>Over 40 religions originally printed in Cults of Prax, Cults of Terror, and Trollpak are detailed here. A guideline chapter shows how to design your own new cults. Appendices include a daily sun-time calendar.<br/><br/>Descriptions combine fact, fiction, legend, and magic to add the flavor so useful in campaign play. If they wish, characters can advance without bloodshed or fighting. Only this series provides so much imaginative scope and so much every-day detail.<br/><br/>Each Cult Description includes:<br/><br/>     Mythos and History - the acts of the gods before time, the behavior of the cult once time started, afterlife promised to members, and Runic associations.<br/>     Nature of the Cult - why the religion continues to exist, what its worldly position and power has been, its likes and dislikes.<br/>     Cult Organizations - inter-cult and inter-temple structures, centres of power, holy places, and holy days.<br/>     Cult Membership - here are the requirements to join the cult (species, birth, ability, money, offerings, etc.), the requirements to remain in the cult (sacrifices, hates, geases and gifts from the gods, codes of conduct), the benefits received from the cult (food, shelter, training, healing), the skills taught or restricted, available battle magic, skills and spells peculiar to the cult, Rune magic and cult duties by membership level, and so on. Such aspects are examined separately for Lay, Initiate, and Rune Lord and Rune Priest membership.<br/>     Subservient Cults - includes cult spirits of reprisal (they keep your characters on the straight-and-narrow in such a world) and various hero cults, which may offer added Rune spells or skills. <br/>     Associated Cults - due to Godtime or later actions, certain cults are more friendly to one another and will teach certain Rune spells or skills.<br/>     Miscellaneous Notes - information on diet, behavior, dress, conceptions of the universe, ethics, ostentatious display, behavior toward members of other cults, rituals, architecture, and so on.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Publisher's Blurb: <br/>In general, it is very similar in layout to the first two volumes. The book contains over 40 cults, including all of the cults found in Cults of Prax, Cults of Terror and Trollpak. To round out the book I have also added in Gloranthan cults from White Wolf and Different Worlds magazines. Associated background articles from Wyrms Footnotes and similar sources give you a complete breakdown on how rune magic, spirit magic, elementals, and runes operate within the game world. To wrap up the book I've added all of the designer's notes, some of which have never been published before. A vastly improved index makes this material accessible all in one book. The topics are vividly detailed with the addition of over 50 new pieces of art, bringing the total over 110 snapshots into cult life (and death). Lastly, it's also worth mentioning that I've added genealogies for the various pantheons along with an updated cult compatibility chart surpassing even the one found in the RuneQuest Companion. In the end, it is a book that can provide untold hours of Gloranthan reading and gaming fun.<br/><br/>What version of the rules does it use?<br/>Just for absolute clarity, the original material has not been updated for the Hero Wars or HeroQuest games published by Issaries Inc.

The Numbers represented the Amount of Fees you must pay to the owner of the Building (Landlord?) every Round. The Starting Player rolls two dice on the random Events Table. Then he rolls for the field where the Pizza Couriers, must deliver their Pizzas. Every Player has one starting Courier. The first one is roling a Die to determine the Number of Crossing Points, his Driver could move this Turn. After this he moves his first driver as Near as Possible to a field with a Number rolled as Target field. If he reachs a crossing point adjacent to the target field he is earning the Printed Number multiplied with 100. These are the Pizza Units or PU (PE in German).

It is based on The Original Series and The Animated Series, but emphasizes &quot;dungeon-crawl&quot; exploration (combat, traps and so on) over Star Trek's themes of space exploration and alien contact.<br/><br/>The game was adapted directly from designer Michael Scott Kurtick's (credited here as Michael J. Scott) previous game, &quot;Space Patrol&quot; (Gamescience, 1977). It was primarily released to support Heritage Models' line of Star Trek 25mm lead miniatures. Other than the miniatures, no additional supplements for the game were ever released by Heritage, though the game appears to have been republished with a different cover around 1979.<br/><br/>The rulebook is divided into two sections, the Basic Game and the Advanced Game, and includes a scenario adventure with maps for each.<br/><br/>BASIC GAME<br/><br/>The book opens with an Introduction, going into background on Star Trek itself; the concept of a role-playing game; and a plug for Heritage's line of Star Trek miniatures. Next, the concept of the &quot;Mission Master&quot; and game preparation is introduced. Virtually everything in the game is resolved with 6-sided dice or 20-sided percentage dice. Others (4, 8, and 12) are rarely used and there's no real consistent game mechanic.<br/><br/>The Basic Game section outlines the game as played with the standard Trek characters (character creation is covered in the Advanced Game) and limited equipment rules. Each character has six abilities with a value between 3 - 18: Strength (ST), Dexterity (DX), Luck (LK), Mentality (MN), Charisma (CH), Constitution (CN). There is no Skill or Talent system. Instead, each of these abilities applies to the resolution of specific tasks as you would expect, except CN which is really a hit point metric. The available Player and Non-player characters are the standard &quot;Star Trek Personalities&quot; from The Original Series and The Animated Series. Psionics are introduced, but only used in the Advanced Game. Creatures have only one stat, the Ability Rating (AR). Stats for classic creatures (such as the Horta, Mugato and the Salt Vampire) and others are provided.<br/><br/>ADVANCED GAME<br/><br/>The Advanced Game introduces custom character creation (rolling dice for attritbutes), Psionic Powers (Empathy, Telepathy, Telekinesis, Clairvoyance, Precognition, Mind Control or Teleportation), Creature Creation and Advanced Combat rules.<br/><br/>No additional supplements were released for the game, but two fan-written works (published years apart) in &quot;Different Worlds&quot; magazine would add additional rules to STAGFF to make it more like the series upon which the game as based.<br/><br/>(description submitted by Robert Saint John, based on portions of his articles originally posted at his Groknard History of Star Trek RPGs website)<br/><br/>"}, "52918": {"rpgartist": ["Mark Allen", "Peter Bradley", "Jason Walton"], "rpgitemversion": ["PDF version", "Saddle Stapled (modules/pamphlets)"], "rpgseries": ["SG - Siege Gear"], "name": "Engineering Dungeons", "rpgdesigner": ["Robert Doyel"], "rpgproducer": ["Peter Bradley"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic532367.jpg", "usersrated": "5", "average": "6.5", "rpgissuearticle": ["Engineering Dungeons"], "rpg": ["Castles & Crusades"], "rpgpublisher": ["Troll Lord Games"], "poll": [], "statistics": [], "rpgcategory": ["Sourcebook (rules/options to enhance play)"], "rpggenre": ["Fantasy"], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic532367_t.jpg", "description": "From the publisher's website:<br/><br/>Beneath the crisp clear air of the world&rsquo;s surface lies dungeons, deep and cold, where stone passages lead to hidden chambers and rooms of treasure and wealth.

Fortunately for us, their con\ufb02ict is easily resolved with a series of savage kicks to realism's face! Impossible leaps, insane acrobatics, and victory against overwhelming odds are all staples of the genre... and the essential elements of action role-playing games.<br/><br/>Sadly, traditional RPGs have long been in league with realism. They penalize players who want to, say, kick seven mooks with one spin kick by piling negative modi\ufb01ers onto their roll, which makes them less likely to succeed. The inevitable result is that smart players stick to simple, boring actions and take a tactical approach to combat. Wushu breaks up this insidious alliance with a core mechanic that rewards players for vivid descriptions and over-the-top stunts by making them more likely to succeed, each and every time.<br/><br/>Traditional role-playing games also alienate themselves from action movies by segmenting time into rounds of only a few seconds. In the movies, you get to see characters trade a whole series of attacks, defenses, and counter-attacks before the camera cuts away. In role-playing games, players are usually limited to one action per round, and they only get enough time for one swing, punch, or pull of the trigger before the next player's turn. This takes the back-and-forth pacing that's essential for exciting \ufb01ght scenes and stabs it straight through the heart!<br/><br/>In Wushu, players are encouraged to make as many attacks, leaps, dives, parries, and ripostes as they like before any dice are rolled. Each &quot;round&rdquo; is divided into two parts, which everyone completes at the same time. First, the group Describes the scene; this is the important part because their narration determines what actually happens in the game world. Then, they Resolve their dice rolls to see how well it all worked.<br/><br/>"}, "52950": {"rpgdesigner": ["St\u00e9phane Adamiak", "Fabrice Colin", "St\u00e9phane Marsan"], "rpg": ["Nephilim (French RPG, Deuxi\u00e8me \u00c9dition)"], "statistics": [], "name": "L'Apprenti", "rpgartist": ["Franck Achard", "Julien Delval"], "rpgproducer": ["St\u00e9phane Adamiak", "Patrick Mallet"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic573686.jpg", "usersrated": "1", "rpgitemversion": ["Soft Cover"], "average": "6", "rpggenre": ["Crime (Conspiracy)", "Fantasy (Modern Urban Fantasy)", "Occult (Symbolism / Tarot)"], "rpgpublisher": ["MultiSim"], "rpgcategory": ["Campaign Setting (game world)"], "poll": [], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic573686_t.jpg", "description": "User Summary:<br/>A small booklet, intended for new Nephilim players, which explains everything they need to know about the complex Nephilim world.
