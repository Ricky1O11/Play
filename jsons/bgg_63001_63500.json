Sympathetic to<br/>mother earth's lamentation, Brahma, accompanied by<br/>Lord Siva and other demigods, took the cow-shaped<br/>mother earth to the shore of the milk ocean, where he<br/>offered prayers to please Lord Visnu, who lay there<br/>on an island in transcendental ecstasy. Brahma thereafter<br/>understood the advice of Maha-Visnu, who informed<br/>him that He would appear on the surface of<br/>the earth to mitigate the burden created by the demons.<br/>The demigods, along with their wives, should<br/>appear there as associates of Lord Krsna in the family<br/>of Yadu to increase the sons and grandsons in that<br/>dynasty.

Remember, the game is lost if the opposing Flag Bearer reaches your King&rsquo;s starting X.<br/><br/>Game pieces cannot jump up or down more than one level in a single movement and must stop their movement as soon as a level is traversed. There are two exceptions to this rule:<br/><br/>&bull;Castle Exception #1: the Knight is allowed to complete the L-shape movement as long as it only moves one level per turn. If the Knight must move up two levels to complete its L-shape movement, the move is not allowed.<br/>&bull;Castle Exception #2: because it can &ldquo;fly&rdquo;, the Dragon&rsquo;s movements in and around the Castle are not restricted. However, the Dragon can only move more than one space in a single turn if it is flying over teammates.<br/><br/>Dragons<br/><br/>A Dragon may move one space per turn in any direction. A Dragon may jump its teammates in any direction for as many spaces as they are in a straight line. A Dragon cannot jump opposing game pieces, even if they are between teammates. With the exception of the Flag Bearer, a Dragon may kill any opposing game piece by moving in any direction. A Dragon may also kill any opposing game pieces (except the Flag Bearer) by jumping teammates to complete the move. A Dragon must end its move as soon as it kills an opposing game piece. A Dragon may traverse more than one level of The Castle in a single move only if it is jumping over teammates.<br/><br/>Flag Bearers<br/><br/>A Flag Bearer may only move one diagonal space per turn. A Flag Bearer cannot jump teammates or opposing game pieces to complete a move. A Flag Bearer cannot kill any opposing game pieces but can only be killed by the opposing King. A Flag Bearer must end its move as soon as it traverses a level of The Castle. A Flag Bearer can win the game by reaching an opposing King&rsquo;s starting position.<br/><br/><br/>Winning Crusade &amp; Conquer<br/><br/>There are two potential endgames (ways to win the game) in Crusade &amp; Conquer. The first endgame is to kill the opposing King. The second endgame is to get your Flag Bearer into the opposing King&rsquo;s starting position (the opposing X).<br/><br/>"}, "63149": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic620240.jpg", "poll": {}, "boardgamedesigner": {"12910": {"name": "Marie-Christine Exbrayat"}}, "statistics": {}, "yearpublished": "2006", "maxplayers": "3", "boardgameartist": {"45247": "Alexis Nouailhat"}, "boardgamepublisher": {"8106": {"name": "Talent Cachet"}}, "maxplaytime": "15", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic620240_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "15", "boardgamecategory": {"1089": {"name": "Animals"}}, "description": "Battle Of Nature is played like the classic card game &quot;War&quot;.

The state of each nation as of the year 2000 is described, and its military forces plotted on an individual situation map.  Nations covered include Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Russia, Ukraine, the Czech and Slovak Republics, Hungary, Romania, Bulgaria, Turkey, Greece, and the splintered remains of the former nation of Yugoslavia.<br/><br/>More than 30 military vehicles are detailed, illustrated, and described in game terms, including the major vehicles used by the nations of the region, all fully updated to Twilight: 2000, version 2.2.

The most unique is selling stock short. Short selling is the practice of selling stock you don&rsquo;t own with the intention of buying the stock back at a later date.

Instead of getting &quot;generic&quot; experience for slaughtering hoards of critters, characters in LoF advance in each skill that they can perform (and are trying to learn) independently of one another. &nbsp;Thus, hacking up rats with a hatchet won't increase your spellcasting ability, but it might increase your axe-wielding ability. &nbsp;Lords of Fantasy makes it more difficult to increase your individual skill's level as you become a master of the skill.<br/><br/>Combat: <br/>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Combats in LoF reflect the relative expertise and deadliness of the combatants involved. &nbsp;If your characters are fighting inferior opponents, combat will be lightning quick, with the characters quickly dispatching their foes. &nbsp;If your characters run up against a very closely matched set of opponents, combat will take much longer. &nbsp;In any case, combats won't bog down your role-playing sessions (unless you as the GM decide to keep sending hordes of foes at the characters). &nbsp;One mechanic in LoF that we are especially proud of is that the more skilled you are in the weapon types you use, the more damage you will do to your opponents. &nbsp;We've added plenty of optional rules to speed up or detail your combats that all work together. Thus you as GM can create the quickness or level of detail that you want without having to revert to :house rules:.<br/><br/>Magic: <br/>There are three basic types of spellcasters in LoF which reflect the three basic types found in gaming, literature, or the movies.<br/><br/>&nbsp;Rather than representing what type of spells can be cast by them, factors like where they get their power for casting spells, how they get this power, what happens (if anything) to them when they cast their spells, and how much power they receive are reflected in one of the three basic types.<br/><br/>&nbsp; &nbsp;Once the spellcasting type is known the rest of the decisions that players must make about their characters revolve around what types of spells they want their characters to cast. &nbsp;Spell forms which define types of spells that can be cast are purchased like any other skill in LoF. &nbsp;These forms consist of two things... a spell element which defines what can be affected (i.e. air, fire, light, mind, body, spirit...) and a spell effect, which defines how the element can be manipulated (control, creation, death, or lore).<br/><br/>&nbsp;Combine an element and an effect and you get a general idea of what types of spells you can cast. &nbsp;Players buy ranks in each spell form for their characters. &nbsp;The higher the rank in each form, the more powerful spells can be cast by the players characters.<br/><br/>&nbsp; &nbsp;So now that players know all their characters' spell forms they start zipping off spells. &nbsp;LoF defaults to an on-the-fly spell casting system, where players build the level of the spell they want their characters to cast using a simple table (one of the few tables in the game). The spell's intensity, range, radius, targets, and finally duration are all modifiers that are added together to determine the level of the spell. The spell's level is not only the amount of power that is needed to cast the spell, but the degree of difficulty of the spell all in one number. &nbsp;If the spellcaster has enough power to cast the spell and makes a successful skill roll for the spell form, the spell goes off.<br/><br/>Settings: <br/>&nbsp; &nbsp;LOF was designed with flexibility as a priority. &nbsp;There is an extensive GM section that includes questions for the GM to ask about their campaign, detailed alternate magic sources and types, rules for creating new types of magic and races, extensive equipment lists and fantasy locations (with adventure ideas and personalities), and much more!<br/><br/>"}, "63175": {"statistics": {}, "name": "Journal of the Travellers' Aid Society (Issue 26)", "rpgproducer": {"2121": "Timothy B.

You are sitting in a bar in a fantasy world, playing cards for gold. The setting is a typical Dungeons &amp; Dragons style bar and the game may be played as a sub-plot of a D&amp;D game if desired.<br/><br/>Goal<br/>The goal is to have the most gold at the point where the first player runs out of gold. In a two player game, you just have to bankrupt your opponent, but in a larger game, you may have to prop up another player until you become the richest.<br/><br/>Gameplay<br/>A game is played over a series of hands until the end-condition is reached (above). A hand typically consists of playing one of your cards into the centre as an 'Ante' card, then three rounds of card-playing, attempting to play the best set (or 'Flight') of cards. The highest value Ante card determines the amount of gold that every player must contribute to the pot this round. The player who played the highest value Ante card starts the first round. Subsequent rounds are started by the player who played the highest value card in the previous round. Each card has both a numerical value and a power (or ability). However, the power is only triggered if the card has a lower or equal value to the card just played.<br/><br/>The game is a balance between playing high cards to win the pot of gold in the Ante and playing lower cards to trigger their abilities and improve your hand for a later round.<br/><br/>This game can be played by itself, or in combination with the original Three-Dragon Ante card set.<br/><br/>From WoTC site:<br/>This fun card game updates the popular Three-Dragon Ante card game, adding new cards and new ways to foil your opponents!

By the fall of 1861, both Union and Confederate forces occupied Kentucky and, despite the fact that the state had not seceded from the Union, the Confederate States of America had set up a temporary state capital in Bowling Green, installed a governor and added a star representing the state to its flag.  Not surprisingly, a campaign to wrest control of the state from the Union, the &ldquo;Confederate Heartland Offensive,&rdquo; was launched by Generals Kirby Smith and Braxton Bragg in the summer of 1862.<br/><br/>The small town of Perryville, located in the central portion of the state, was an unlikely site for the culmination of the campaign, but as the Union forces of General Don Carlos Buell pursued Bragg's Army of the Mississippi eastward under severe drought conditions in early October, both sides made their way to the town in search of the water promised by the Chaplin River and its tributaries.  Once the forces collided near Doctor's Creek on October 8, the Battle of Perryville, the biggest battle fought in Kentucky and, for the number of soldiers involved, one of the bloodiest battles of the Civil War, had begun.<br/><br/>By nightfall, the Confederates had scored a tactical victory, as Bragg&rsquo;s army had managed to push Buell&rsquo;s forces back over a mile, but both sides had suffered extensive casualties (over 6,000 Union and Confederate soldiers were dead, wounded, captured or missing), and Bragg, having realized that the number of Union forces in Perryville had been greatly underestimated, would withdraw from the town that night as part of what would ultimately be a total withdrawal from the state.  (Kentucky remained in the Union column for the remainder of the war.)  Buell, roundly criticized for his failures in leadership during the battle (including his failure, due in part to a phenomenon known as an &ldquo;acoustic shadow,&rdquo; to recognize the severity of the battle until very late in the engagement and, therefore, to provide needed &ndash; and readily-available &ndash; reinforcements), found his military career effectively ruined at Perryville despite his strategic victory there.<br/><br/>Perryville:  Bragg vs. Buell, Oct. 8, 1862, a card-driven war game, gives two players the chance to step into the shoes of these generals.  The players must balance military tactics with hand management to determine the fate of the Commonwealth.<br/><br/>&ldquo;The whole game&rdquo; is at stake &ndash; who will be victorious?<br/><br/>"}, "63216": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic620264.jpg", "boardgameimplementation": {"101718": "Terra Evolution"}, "poll": {}, "boardgamedesigner": {"33095": {"name": "Jaana Hintsanen"}}, "statistics": {}, "yearpublished": "2009", "maxplayers": "4", "boardgameartist": {"33094": "Tomi Rantala"}, "boardgamepublisher": {"1001": {"name": "(Web published)"}}, "maxplaytime": "45", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic620264_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "45", "boardgamecategory": {"1089": {"name": "Animals"}}, "description": "Evolution Earth: Cataclysm is a fast paced strategic deck/world building game about species evolution, cataclysms and extinction.

Game Summaries of the source materials are also included.&quot;<br/><br/>From the introduction:  &quot;RPG design patterns are not about deciding upon a creative agenda, genre, or even helping you clarify your design goals.  RPG design patterns are about formalizing the mechanics observed in existing pen-and-paper role-playing games, the kind of games where the players sit around a table and actually talk to one another.  Each pattern description discusses its particular strengths and weaknesses, and educates game designers interested in using the same techniques on how to properly implement them. <br/> This study focuses exclusively on the nitty-gritty structure and mechanical design of table-top role-playing systems.  RPG design patterns have nothing to do with mood or setting, although these issues are obviously quite important to many games.  In other words, design patterns approach game development at a micro level rather than a macro level.  For example, if you have decided that you want to abandon hit points as a means to measure character survivability in your fledgling game, what are your other options?  What about alignment?  Are there better ways to guide character behavior?  Are character classes the best option for your design goals?  If so, what pitfalls should you avoid in implementing them?  If not, what are the alternatives?  How should conflicts be resolved?  Is there more than one approach? &quot;<br/><br/>"}, "63281": {"statistics": {}, "name": "Polyhedron (Issue 104 - Vol. 15, No. 2)", "rpgproducer": {"31559": "Rick Behling"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic795636.jpg", "usersrated": "0", "average": "0", "rpgissue": {"1223": "Polyhedron"}, "rpgissuearticle": {"49181": "Dangers from the Dark Side"}, "rpg": {"244": "Advanced Dungeons & Dragons (2nd Edition)"}, "rpgissueversion": {"17802": "Print Edition"}, "poll": {}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic795636_t.jpg", "description": "Cover Artist: Stephen Schwartz<br/><br/>"}, "63282": {"statistics": {}, "name": "Polyhedron (Issue 105 - Vol. 15, No. 3)", "rpgproducer": {"31559": "Rick Behling"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic795635.jpg", "usersrated": "0", "average": "0", "rpgissue": {"1223": "Polyhedron"}, "rpgissuearticle": {"49198": "Elminster's Everwinking Eye - More Fabled Treasures of the Land of Turmish"}, "rpg": {"244": "Advanced Dungeons & Dragons (2nd Edition)"}, "rpgissueversion": {"17803": "Print Edition"}, "poll": {}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic795635_t.jpg", "description": "Cover Artist: Stephen Schwartz<br/><br/>"}, "63283": {"statistics": {}, "name": "Polyhedron (Issue 106 - Vol. 15, No. 4)", "rpgproducer": {"31559": "Rick Behling"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic795634.jpg", "usersrated": "0", "average": "0", "rpgissue": {"1223": "Polyhedron"}, "rpgissuearticle": {"49227": "Bugging the Hunters"}, "rpg": {"244": "Advanced Dungeons & Dragons (2nd Edition)"}, "rpgissueversion": {"17804": "Print Edition"}, "poll": {}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic795634_t.jpg", "description": "Cover Artist: Phillip Robb<br/><br/>"}, "63284": {"rpg": {"4224": "Gnostigmata"}, "statistics": {}, "name": "Gnostigmata", "rpgproducer": {"33011": "Whitson John Kirk, III"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic623603.jpg", "usersrated": "0", "rpgitemversion": {"17805": "PDF Version"}, "average": "0", "rpggenre": {"2672": "Adult / Mature"}, "rpgcategory": {"2083": "Core Rules (min needed to play)"}, "poll": {}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic623603_t.jpg", "description": "From the introduction:<br/><br/>&quot;God exists.  Satan exists.  In the beginning, one of the two created the Heavens and the Earth.  But which one?  The vast majority of Christendom asserts that God is the Creator.  Since the birth of Catholicism, this has been the view of the Catholic church.  But, not all Christians view the world this way.  One group of early Christians, known as the Gnostics, believed the world to be a prison created by Satan to ensnare and bewilder countless souls, who would otherwise be deities themselves.  Thus, Christ came to teach us how to escape our delusional worldly bonds and assume our rightful place among the divine.  Needless to say, the Gnostic view of the world is at odds with the Catholic viewpoint.  So, in the fourth century A.D., the early Catholic Church systematically slaughtered the Gnostics.  The Church proved highly efficient in the art of genocide, but a few Gnostics managed to slip away.  Gnosticism survived, but only in secret. <br/> Gnostigmata is about faith.  How can a person believe in a divine Creator who has our best interests in mind without any hard facts supporting that assertion?

When spun, it will end on one of two letters; S for Scent, or F for Fault.If an S is spun, the fox moves to the first space on the board from Going Out bearing the letter S. And if F is spun, the fox moves to the first space upwards marked with an F. Players now follow, keeping to these rules. If in Scent, the fox always moves toward the direct road. If he is in Fault, he must be moved upwards and to the left to the next F space on the board. The Fox can only move along the roads. If he is in Fault and it is the next player's turn and he stays in Fault, he has to be moved backwards to the previous F, and so on until he reaches a road where he can move forward as long as he is in Scent.<br/><br/>On arriving at Hope Turning, if the next player spins an S for Scent, that player wins the game by bringing the Fox to his death. But if that player spins an F for Fault, that player is thrown out of the game. The succeeding player now takes his chance on Hope Turning unless the former player, instead of being thrown out, decides to take the Fox to Agony Corner and pay 8 counters into the Pool for the privilege of another try.

Making fun of the contentious 'farming scoring' in Carcassonne, it uses meeples that are prone (farmers) as the checkers. In keeping with this, the 8x8 checkerboard alternating between the farmer&rsquo;s fields and 'city tiles'.<br/><br/>ADDITIONALLY: Included in the game is a very brief synopsis of the alternate ways that farmers may be scored as well as other common, simple, Carcassonne play-style questions. But, the main focus is checkers, so a pair of dice is included for playing a variation called Irish Draughts. (yes, this could be considered a &quot;beer and pretzels&quot; game.)<br/><br/>GAMEPLAY SUMMARY: Alternating moves on each other, players may advance their farmers diagonally one space to open field. Typically, the black meeples (and blue die for variant) are used by the groom whereas the white 'farmers' (and pink die) are for the bride. You must jump your partner whenever possible. Farmers reaching an opponent&rsquo;s back row are 'kinged' by being placed in the erect position. They are then free to move in any direction.<br/><br/>GOAL: The winner of the game is the one to either 1) be the first to remove all the opponent&rsquo;s pieces, or 2) contain the opponent so they cannot move.<br/><br/>"}, "63439": {"statistics": {}, "name": "Autoduel Quarterly (Vol. 3, No. 3 - Fall 2035)", "rpgproducer": {"33104": "Mark Chandler"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic621036.jpg", "usersrated": "1", "average": "7", "rpgissue": {"4221": "Autoduel Quarterly"}, "rpgissuearticle": {"62558": "AADA News"}, "rpg": {"4221": "Autoduel Quarterly"}, "rpgissueversion": {"147854": "HTML Version"}, "poll": {}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic621036_t.jpg", "description": "<br/>     Excerpts from the North American Road Atlas and Survival Guide, 3rd edition: CENTRAL PALM BEACH, FLORIDA<br/>     Excerpts from the North American Road Atlas and Survival Guide, 3rd edition: DESERET AUTONOMOUS REGION<br/>     ADQ Custom Feature<br/>     Tow Trucks in Car Wars<br/>     The Motorcycle Exposed<br/>     Kamicars<br/>     Alkahest<br/>     The Deathtoll Resolution: Gaming Notes<br/>     Uncle Albert's Auto Stop and Gunnery Shop<br/>     Departments: Newswatch, ADQ&amp;A, Letters, Advertisers<br/><br/><br/>"}, "63441": {"statistics": {}, "name": "Autoduel Quarterly (Vol. 3, No. 4 - Winter 2035)", "rpgproducer": {"33104": "Mark Chandler"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic621035.jpg", "usersrated": "1", "average": "8", "rpgissue": {"4221": "Autoduel Quarterly"}, "rpgissuearticle": {"62607": "AADA News"}, "rpg": {"4221": "Autoduel Quarterly"}, "rpgissueversion": {"17902": "magazine"}, "poll": {}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic621035_t.jpg", "description": "Table of Contents<br/><br/><br/>     ADQ Custom Feature<br/>     Checker's Pizza--We Deliver<br/>     Excerpts from the North American Road Atlas and Survival Guide, 3rd edition: CUMBERLAND, MARYLAND<br/>     First Blud: A Car Wars Roleplaying Adventure<br/>     Racetrack Arenas<br/>     Ramps in Car Wars<br/>     Uncle Albert's Auto Stop and Gunnery Shop<br/>     Departments: Newswatch, ADQ&amp;A, Letters, Advertisers<br/><br/><br/>"}, "63442": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic837183.jpg", "poll": {}, "boardgamedesigner": {"33145": {"name": "Yoshigi Ogasawara"}}, "statistics": {}, "yearpublished": "2005", "maxplayers": "4", "boardgameartist": {"39517": "Tatsuo Kakuta"}, "boardgamepublisher": {"4": {"name": "(Self-Published)"}}, "maxplaytime": "10", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic837183_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "10", "boardgamecategory": {"1009": {"name": "Abstract Strategy"}}, "description": "User summary:<br/>Aisopos is an abstract multi-player pawn-taking game with face-down pawns, played on a 3x3x3 hex board. The pawns' strengths are decided by a two-dimensional scissors-paper-stone method, based on some of Aisopos' fables: The human outsmarts the fox, the fox takes the mouse, but the mouse defeats the human. The Lion defeats both human, fox and mouse, which in turn all three defeat the ant.
