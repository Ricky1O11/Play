This step-by-step process is primarily for adjustments to player characters, but a quick version is presented later for making changes to minor NPCs and villains.

Sympathetic to<br/>mother earth's lamentation, Brahma, accompanied by<br/>Lord Siva and other demigods, took the cow-shaped<br/>mother earth to the shore of the milk ocean, where he<br/>offered prayers to please Lord Visnu, who lay there<br/>on an island in transcendental ecstasy. Brahma thereafter<br/>understood the advice of Maha-Visnu, who informed<br/>him that He would appear on the surface of<br/>the earth to mitigate the burden created by the demons.<br/>The demigods, along with their wives, should<br/>appear there as associates of Lord Krsna in the family<br/>of Yadu to increase the sons and grandsons in that<br/>dynasty. Brahma informed mother earth about all this,<br/>and then he returned to his own abode&hellip;.<br/><br/>Welcome to a world where gods and heroes walk the<br/>earth. A time unprecedented in the earths history. It is<br/>a time when the entire celestial host, from the heavenly<br/>planets to the hellish realms, converged on earth<br/>to battle for universal supremacy. The demonic forces<br/>plotted for total control: incarnating in human forms<br/>in the dynasties of kings so that they may rule the<br/>world. Those who did not take a mortal form possessed<br/>the hearts of wicked men on the battlefields<br/>and inspired them into frenzies of iniquity. The Supreme<br/>Personality of Godhead descended, with his<br/>associates, to send them back into the darkness from<br/>where they came and reinstate the true king of men to<br/>his throne of virtue. In the process the principles of<br/>religion were re-established and a new age dawned for<br/>the people of earth.<br/><br/>It is on this stage that our heroes enter, descending<br/>from the abodes of the devas, joining the forces of the<br/>righteous to bring the malevolent to justice and grant<br/>themselves a chance of total redemption.<br/><br/>"}, "63119": {"rpgartist": ["Janet Aulisio", "Steve Bryant", "Rob Caswell", "Paul Daly", "Larry Elmore", "LaMont Fullerton", "Mark Fullerton", "Grant Goleash", "Rick Harris", "Mike Jackson", "David O.

Each creature also includes information on new and deadly creature variants, such as nosferatu vampires, corpse chill mummies, gemstone gargoyles, host corpse zombies, and phantasmagoric ghosts.

Be wary of flying dragons, defending flag bearers, and the castle&rsquo;s move-restricting levels. A fantastical world where a modern twist on the classic game of chess feeds the eternal feud between King Ulric and King Montfort, the realm of C&amp;C is a place that knows no grandmasters and players enjoy the luxury of an entirely new endgame&hellip; what's your endgame?<br/> Game Rules<br/><br/>Playing Crusade &amp; Conquer is similar to chess... well kind of.  While many of the characters and their movements mirror classic chess,  the new board, castles, and game pieces have introduced twists and turns that will make even the most strategic and advanced players think twice.   But this game is not just for the masters.  Anyone can learn... and once you do you'll never turn back.<br/>The Castle<br/><br/>The Castle has two levels or floors. The upper level is where the King and Queen begin the game; with the King always starting on the X. Remember, the game is lost if the opposing Flag Bearer reaches your King&rsquo;s starting X.<br/><br/>Game pieces cannot jump up or down more than one level in a single movement and must stop their movement as soon as a level is traversed. There are two exceptions to this rule:<br/><br/>&bull;Castle Exception #1: the Knight is allowed to complete the L-shape movement as long as it only moves one level per turn. If the Knight must move up two levels to complete its L-shape movement, the move is not allowed.<br/>&bull;Castle Exception #2: because it can &ldquo;fly&rdquo;, the Dragon&rsquo;s movements in and around the Castle are not restricted. However, the Dragon can only move more than one space in a single turn if it is flying over teammates.<br/><br/>Dragons<br/><br/>A Dragon may move one space per turn in any direction. A Dragon may jump its teammates in any direction for as many spaces as they are in a straight line. A Dragon cannot jump opposing game pieces, even if they are between teammates. With the exception of the Flag Bearer, a Dragon may kill any opposing game piece by moving in any direction. A Dragon may also kill any opposing game pieces (except the Flag Bearer) by jumping teammates to complete the move. A Dragon must end its move as soon as it kills an opposing game piece. A Dragon may traverse more than one level of The Castle in a single move only if it is jumping over teammates.<br/><br/>Flag Bearers<br/><br/>A Flag Bearer may only move one diagonal space per turn. A Flag Bearer cannot jump teammates or opposing game pieces to complete a move. A Flag Bearer cannot kill any opposing game pieces but can only be killed by the opposing King. A Flag Bearer must end its move as soon as it traverses a level of The Castle. A Flag Bearer can win the game by reaching an opposing King&rsquo;s starting position.<br/><br/><br/>Winning Crusade &amp; Conquer<br/><br/>There are two potential endgames (ways to win the game) in Crusade &amp; Conquer. The first endgame is to kill the opposing King. The second endgame is to get your Flag Bearer into the opposing King&rsquo;s starting position (the opposing X).<br/><br/>"}, "63149": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic620240.jpg", "poll": [], "boardgamedesigner": ["Marie-Christine Exbrayat"], "statistics": [], "yearpublished": "2006", "maxplayers": "3", "boardgameartist": ["Alexis Nouailhat"], "boardgamepublisher": ["Talent Cachet"], "maxplaytime": "15", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic620240_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "15", "boardgamecategory": ["Animals", "Card Game", "Children's Game", "Environmental"], "description": "Battle Of Nature is played like the classic card game &quot;War&quot;.

It is named after the year the New York Stock Exchange opened at 40 Wall Street in New York.<br/><br/>1817 differentiates itself from other 18xx games with its sophisticated financial mechanics that simulate the laissez faire capitalism of early America. While all the familiar mechanics of an 18xx game are present, such as placing tiles, purchasing tokens, and running trains, the game is won or lost based on the financial decisions you make.<br/><br/>1817 includes financial mechanics seen in other 18xx games such as mergers, friendly takeovers, and conversions to different share structures. Beyond these basics, 1817 introduces several additional financial mechanics such as short selling, market driven interest rates, hostile takeovers, and corporate liquidations. The most unique is selling stock short. Short selling is the practice of selling stock you don&rsquo;t own with the intention of buying the stock back at a later date. You hope to profit from a decline in the price of the stock between the sale and the repurchase. Conversely, you will incur a loss if the price of the stock increases before the repurchase.

You can design a fire mage that can swing a sword with the best of the Conan wannabees in LoF or design a city dwelling sneaky thief type as well. &nbsp;We've also provided two ways to get characters fleshed out quickly. &nbsp;The first of the two are called character packs; these packs provide a standard list of skills appropriate for a :warrior:, :magician:, :rogue:, or many other character types.<br/><br/>&nbsp;Players are not required to use any of the packs, and they can modify the pack to their hearts content. &nbsp;They are designed as examples for GMs or players. &nbsp;The second of the two quick ways to get characters moving is a way for players to design their characters as they go. &nbsp;Players can flesh out none or some of their basic skills and spend their character development points on the rest as they need to use them. &nbsp;It works nicely and we really think people will like it.<br/><br/>Skills and Advancement: <br/>&nbsp; &nbsp;Lords of Fantasy handles character advancement differently than level based games. &nbsp;Everything that you can do in LoF is represented by a skill. Instead of getting &quot;generic&quot; experience for slaughtering hoards of critters, characters in LoF advance in each skill that they can perform (and are trying to learn) independently of one another. &nbsp;Thus, hacking up rats with a hatchet won't increase your spellcasting ability, but it might increase your axe-wielding ability. &nbsp;Lords of Fantasy makes it more difficult to increase your individual skill's level as you become a master of the skill.<br/><br/>Combat: <br/>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Combats in LoF reflect the relative expertise and deadliness of the combatants involved. &nbsp;If your characters are fighting inferior opponents, combat will be lightning quick, with the characters quickly dispatching their foes. &nbsp;If your characters run up against a very closely matched set of opponents, combat will take much longer. &nbsp;In any case, combats won't bog down your role-playing sessions (unless you as the GM decide to keep sending hordes of foes at the characters). &nbsp;One mechanic in LoF that we are especially proud of is that the more skilled you are in the weapon types you use, the more damage you will do to your opponents. &nbsp;We've added plenty of optional rules to speed up or detail your combats that all work together. Thus you as GM can create the quickness or level of detail that you want without having to revert to :house rules:.<br/><br/>Magic: <br/>There are three basic types of spellcasters in LoF which reflect the three basic types found in gaming, literature, or the movies.<br/><br/>&nbsp;Rather than representing what type of spells can be cast by them, factors like where they get their power for casting spells, how they get this power, what happens (if anything) to them when they cast their spells, and how much power they receive are reflected in one of the three basic types.<br/><br/>&nbsp; &nbsp;Once the spellcasting type is known the rest of the decisions that players must make about their characters revolve around what types of spells they want their characters to cast. &nbsp;Spell forms which define types of spells that can be cast are purchased like any other skill in LoF. &nbsp;These forms consist of two things... a spell element which defines what can be affected (i.e. air, fire, light, mind, body, spirit...) and a spell effect, which defines how the element can be manipulated (control, creation, death, or lore).<br/><br/>&nbsp;Combine an element and an effect and you get a general idea of what types of spells you can cast. &nbsp;Players buy ranks in each spell form for their characters. &nbsp;The higher the rank in each form, the more powerful spells can be cast by the players characters.<br/><br/>&nbsp; &nbsp;So now that players know all their characters' spell forms they start zipping off spells. &nbsp;LoF defaults to an on-the-fly spell casting system, where players build the level of the spell they want their characters to cast using a simple table (one of the few tables in the game). The spell's intensity, range, radius, targets, and finally duration are all modifiers that are added together to determine the level of the spell. The spell's level is not only the amount of power that is needed to cast the spell, but the degree of difficulty of the spell all in one number. &nbsp;If the spellcaster has enough power to cast the spell and makes a successful skill roll for the spell form, the spell goes off.<br/><br/>Settings: <br/>&nbsp; &nbsp;LOF was designed with flexibility as a priority. &nbsp;There is an extensive GM section that includes questions for the GM to ask about their campaign, detailed alternate magic sources and types, rules for creating new types of magic and races, extensive equipment lists and fantasy locations (with adventure ideas and personalities), and much more!<br/><br/>"}, "63175": {"rpgdesigner": ["David W.

You are sitting in a bar in a fantasy world, playing cards for gold. The setting is a typical Dungeons &amp; Dragons style bar and the game may be played as a sub-plot of a D&amp;D game if desired.<br/><br/>Goal<br/>The goal is to have the most gold at the point where the first player runs out of gold. In a two player game, you just have to bankrupt your opponent, but in a larger game, you may have to prop up another player until you become the richest.<br/><br/>Gameplay<br/>A game is played over a series of hands until the end-condition is reached (above). A hand typically consists of playing one of your cards into the centre as an 'Ante' card, then three rounds of card-playing, attempting to play the best set (or 'Flight') of cards. The highest value Ante card determines the amount of gold that every player must contribute to the pot this round. The player who played the highest value Ante card starts the first round. Subsequent rounds are started by the player who played the highest value card in the previous round. Each card has both a numerical value and a power (or ability). However, the power is only triggered if the card has a lower or equal value to the card just played.<br/><br/>The game is a balance between playing high cards to win the pot of gold in the Ante and playing lower cards to trigger their abilities and improve your hand for a later round.<br/><br/>This game can be played by itself, or in combination with the original Three-Dragon Ante card set.<br/><br/>From WoTC site:<br/>This fun card game updates the popular Three-Dragon Ante card game, adding new cards and new ways to foil your opponents!

By the fall of 1861, both Union and Confederate forces occupied Kentucky and, despite the fact that the state had not seceded from the Union, the Confederate States of America had set up a temporary state capital in Bowling Green, installed a governor and added a star representing the state to its flag.  Not surprisingly, a campaign to wrest control of the state from the Union, the &ldquo;Confederate Heartland Offensive,&rdquo; was launched by Generals Kirby Smith and Braxton Bragg in the summer of 1862.<br/><br/>The small town of Perryville, located in the central portion of the state, was an unlikely site for the culmination of the campaign, but as the Union forces of General Don Carlos Buell pursued Bragg's Army of the Mississippi eastward under severe drought conditions in early October, both sides made their way to the town in search of the water promised by the Chaplin River and its tributaries.  Once the forces collided near Doctor's Creek on October 8, the Battle of Perryville, the biggest battle fought in Kentucky and, for the number of soldiers involved, one of the bloodiest battles of the Civil War, had begun.<br/><br/>By nightfall, the Confederates had scored a tactical victory, as Bragg&rsquo;s army had managed to push Buell&rsquo;s forces back over a mile, but both sides had suffered extensive casualties (over 6,000 Union and Confederate soldiers were dead, wounded, captured or missing), and Bragg, having realized that the number of Union forces in Perryville had been greatly underestimated, would withdraw from the town that night as part of what would ultimately be a total withdrawal from the state.  (Kentucky remained in the Union column for the remainder of the war.)  Buell, roundly criticized for his failures in leadership during the battle (including his failure, due in part to a phenomenon known as an &ldquo;acoustic shadow,&rdquo; to recognize the severity of the battle until very late in the engagement and, therefore, to provide needed &ndash; and readily-available &ndash; reinforcements), found his military career effectively ruined at Perryville despite his strategic victory there.<br/><br/>Perryville:  Bragg vs. Buell, Oct. 8, 1862, a card-driven war game, gives two players the chance to step into the shoes of these generals.  The players must balance military tactics with hand management to determine the fate of the Commonwealth.<br/><br/>&ldquo;The whole game&rdquo; is at stake &ndash; who will be victorious?<br/><br/>"}, "63216": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic620264.jpg", "boardgameimplementation": ["Terra Evolution"], "poll": [], "boardgamedesigner": ["Jaana Hintsanen", "Tomi Rantala"], "statistics": [], "yearpublished": "2009", "maxplayers": "4", "boardgameartist": ["Tomi Rantala"], "boardgamepublisher": ["(Web published)"], "maxplaytime": "45", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic620264_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "45", "boardgamecategory": ["Animals", "Card Game", "Prehistoric", "Print & Play", "Science Fiction"], "description": "Evolution Earth: Cataclysm is a fast paced strategic deck/world building game about species evolution, cataclysms and extinction.

Game Summaries of the source materials are also included.&quot;<br/><br/>From the introduction:  &quot;RPG design patterns are not about deciding upon a creative agenda, genre, or even helping you clarify your design goals.  RPG design patterns are about formalizing the mechanics observed in existing pen-and-paper role-playing games, the kind of games where the players sit around a table and actually talk to one another.  Each pattern description discusses its particular strengths and weaknesses, and educates game designers interested in using the same techniques on how to properly implement them. <br/> This study focuses exclusively on the nitty-gritty structure and mechanical design of table-top role-playing systems.  RPG design patterns have nothing to do with mood or setting, although these issues are obviously quite important to many games.  In other words, design patterns approach game development at a micro level rather than a macro level.  For example, if you have decided that you want to abandon hit points as a means to measure character survivability in your fledgling game, what are your other options?  What about alignment?  Are there better ways to guide character behavior?  Are character classes the best option for your design goals?  If so, what pitfalls should you avoid in implementing them?  If not, what are the alternatives?  How should conflicts be resolved?  Is there more than one approach? &quot;<br/><br/>"}, "63281": {"rpgartist": ["Brian Blume", "Stephen F.

Satan exists.  In the beginning, one of the two created the Heavens and the Earth.  But which one?  The vast majority of Christendom asserts that God is the Creator.  Since the birth of Catholicism, this has been the view of the Catholic church.  But, not all Christians view the world this way.  One group of early Christians, known as the Gnostics, believed the world to be a prison created by Satan to ensnare and bewilder countless souls, who would otherwise be deities themselves.  Thus, Christ came to teach us how to escape our delusional worldly bonds and assume our rightful place among the divine.  Needless to say, the Gnostic view of the world is at odds with the Catholic viewpoint.  So, in the fourth century A.D., the early Catholic Church systematically slaughtered the Gnostics.  The Church proved highly efficient in the art of genocide, but a few Gnostics managed to slip away.  Gnosticism survived, but only in secret. <br/> Gnostigmata is about faith.  How can a person believe in a divine Creator who has our best interests in mind without any hard facts supporting that assertion?  Is it reasonable to do so?&quot;<br/><br/>"}, "63285": {"rpgdesigner": ["Jeff Aldrich", "Alan Atkinson", "Thomas Birchmire, III", "Bjarne Bjerklund", "Jolly R.

Making fun of the contentious 'farming scoring' in Carcassonne, it uses meeples that are prone (farmers) as the checkers. In keeping with this, the 8x8 checkerboard alternating between the farmer&rsquo;s fields and 'city tiles'.<br/><br/>ADDITIONALLY: Included in the game is a very brief synopsis of the alternate ways that farmers may be scored as well as other common, simple, Carcassonne play-style questions. But, the main focus is checkers, so a pair of dice is included for playing a variation called Irish Draughts. (yes, this could be considered a &quot;beer and pretzels&quot; game.)<br/><br/>GAMEPLAY SUMMARY: Alternating moves on each other, players may advance their farmers diagonally one space to open field. Typically, the black meeples (and blue die for variant) are used by the groom whereas the white 'farmers' (and pink die) are for the bride. You must jump your partner whenever possible. Farmers reaching an opponent&rsquo;s back row are 'kinged' by being placed in the erect position. They are then free to move in any direction.<br/><br/>GOAL: The winner of the game is the one to either 1) be the first to remove all the opponent&rsquo;s pieces, or 2) contain the opponent so they cannot move.<br/><br/>"}, "63439": {"rpgdesigner": ["J.
