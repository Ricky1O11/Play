Players can choose from one of five prequel-era Jedi and run, jump, slash, and use the Force through the game's ten levels, starting on the Trade Federation Battleship and ending with the battle against Darth Maul on Naboo. The players primary weapon is a lightsaber used to fight through waves of enemies and deflect blaster shots. The lightsaber combat is rather simplified with a system that lets the player lock on to the nearest enemy using the R1 button. Items and the force can also be used for special attacks. On most levels jumping puzzles make up a large portion of the challenge. There are a few segments in which the player can pilot various craft. The single player campaign can also be played in cooperative mode with a second player, while the Dreamcast version has an additional training mode and a two player duel mode.&quot;<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;Jedi Power Battles&quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "81941": {"rpgartist": ["(Uncredited)"], "rpgitemversion": ["HTML version"], "statistics": [], "name": "Prayers for the Faithful", "rpgdesigner": ["Mike Mearls"], "rpgproducer": ["Mike Mearls"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic800864.jpg", "usersrated": "0", "average": "0", "rpggenre": ["Fantasy"], "rpgpublisher": ["(Web published)"], "rpg": ["Plain English Role Playing"], "rpgcategory": ["Core Rules (min needed to play)"], "poll": [], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic800864_t.jpg", "description": "<br/>User summary<br/><br/>Prayers for the Faithful is an add-on for Plain English Role Playing.

As a game of hard science fiction, it includes speculative but plausible technology. Spaceships are propelled with reaction drives, not inertialess drives. If crews need simulated gravity then they spin the ship or accelerate hard; they don?t have artificial gravity. To destroy an enemy, they fire lasers, missiles, or kinetic-energy projectiles. To survive combat, they usually must avoid being hit, since there are no shields.

There was also a version for the Apple IIe and Atari 8-bit home computers as well as the TRS-80 Color Computer.<br/><br/>Premise of the Game<br/><br/>In the game, you are a famous detective who has been summoned to South Fork for a secret meeting with Sue Ellen. She has called you here to offer you a proposition. Sue Ellen is in possession of a letter from Jock Ewing written to Miss Ellie which describes an extremely rich oil field he had discovered during his stay in South America. When Jock left for his ill-fated trip back to South Fork, he carried a map of the oilfield with him. But he also took the precaution of leaving a copy of it with an old friend and former fellow wildcatter named &quot;Chugalug&quot; Jones who now runs a trading post in South America in a village called Playa Peligro. Should anything happen to Jock, Chugalug has been instructed to give the map only to the person who possesses a particular ring. This ring was enclosed with the letter written to Miss Ellie; also enclosed was a snapshot of Chugalug.<br/><br/>Sue Ellen explains that she wants the map for herself. She wants to become financially independent of J.R. so that if he begins pulling any of his old tricks she can use her own wealth to either make him behave or finance her escape from him. You must, therefore, avoid J. R. at all costs; first, because he will want to stop Sue Ellen from obtaining this independence, and second, because he will most assuredly feel that the map and the oil fields are rightfully his. J.R. will use any means to stop you!<br/><br/>Sue Ellen continues, saying that you will be paid very handsomely for your services and, if you find the map and return it safely to her, she will pay you a bonus of two million dollars. Unbeknownst to you and Sue Ellen, J.R. has been listening to your conversation while lurking in the hallway outside the living room doors. After Sue Ellen quickly gives you the snapshot, the ring, and $500,000 for expenses, she leaves you and proceeds upstairs to her room. You now must leave at once to meet the unknown challenges that await you.<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;Dallas Quest&quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "81958": {"rpgdesigner": ["(Uncredited)"], "rpgitemversion": ["GM screen"], "statistics": [], "name": "Saga Spelledarsk\u00e4rm", "rpgartist": ["(Uncredited)"], "rpgproducer": ["(Uncredited)"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic800855.jpg", "usersrated": "0", "average": "0", "rpggenre": ["Fantasy (Low Fantasy)"], "rpgpublisher": ["SagaGames"], "rpg": ["Saga"], "rpgcategory": ["Accessory (dice, maps, screens, cards)"], "poll": [], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic800855_t.jpg", "description": "<br/>User summary<br/><br/>The Saga Spelledarsk&auml;rm is a four-panel GM screen made of soft cardstock.<br/><br/>The front depicts a misty landscape scene with a castle and riders in the background.<br/><br/>The back shows the following tables:<br/><br/><br/>     Modifikationer vid attacker med avst&aring;ndsvapen<br/>     Attackmodifikationer i n&auml;rstrid<br/>     Strid med flera personer<br/>     Ett-regeln<br/>     Tr&auml;ffomr&aring;den<br/>     Styrkabonus<br/>     Fallskada<br/>     Avst&aring;ndsvapen<br/>     Rustning&aring;r<br/>     Besv&auml;rjelser<br/>     Skador<br/>     F&auml;rdigheter<br/><br/><br/>"}, "81959": {"poll": [], "name": "Comet", "playingtime": "5", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": ["Hand Management"], "yearpublished": "0", "usersrated": "1", "maxplayers": "2", "boardgamefamily": ["Shedding Games", "Traditional Card Games"], "average": "5", "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["(Public Domain)"], "boardgameversion": ["Public Domain edition"], "maxplaytime": "5", "boardgamecategory": ["Card Game"], "age": "0", "minplaytime": "5", "description": "A discard game for 2 players, using two standard decks, usually with identical backs but this is not strictly necessary.<br/><br/>Prepare two packs (to be played alternately in rounds) by discarding all Aces, separating into red and black piles and then swapping one red and black nine over, which becomes the <b>Comet</b> in each pack.<br/><br/>Shuffle one pack and deal 18 to each player, discarding the remaining 12.

As a direct consequence of this, Z: Steel Soldiers has become truly representative of a 'real world' war zone in that every metre of ground needs to be fought for as a result of the territory based nature of the game play.<br/><br/>Each world type that battle takes place upon has been carefully crafted with its own unique environment, whether it be sun bleached dessert or dark forest each with its own environmental system and localised life forms.<br/><br/>The war machine that the player commands has been completely reworked and extended within Z: Steel Soldiers compared to the original. Again due to the fact that highly realistic terrain environments exist within the game, it seemed only fair to give the player a full naval and air force to command as well as the robotic infantry and armoured fighting vehicles from the first game. In total there are 30 unit types and 20 building types for the player to experiment with. In addition to the original array of Robots, there is a new core of elite infantry units that have been introduced; the Technician, Explosives Expert and the Spy.<br/><br/>You can still snipe enemy vehicles, even aircraft when they are on the ground and then commandeer them for your own ends. Viruses can be planted within enemy installations disrupting manufacturing processes, buildings can be stolen and a variety of heavy weaponry is on offer.<br/><br/>Z: Steel Soldiers allows you to build your own base where you want to rather than having predefined building positions. The only constraint on the player is that you have to own the land that you wish to build upon, so you are still forced to go out and conquer the terrain in the region. When you take possession of a territory a mine is built that harvests Xenonite that is converted into currency for the player to fund the expansion of their forces.<br/><br/>Unlike the original, Z: Steel Soldiers is plot driven with the player progressing through a campaign that takes place over 6 vastly different worlds, 30 levels in total. The mission structure of the game takes this into consideration with the player having to achieve a plethora of objectives in their battle against the blue forces. As with the original the robotic infantry units all have their own individual personalities and act accordingly. From the script there are a number of &quot;Hero&quot; characters that also play an important part in the game and will often help or in some cases hinder the player in their quest, depending on who's side they are on. All of these characters obviously have their own visual identity with slim, dexterous Snipers running for the high ground and large, hulking Tough robots with their massive shoulder mounted missile launchers ambling into battle.<br/><br/>The multiplayer aspect of the game gives the player the chance to enter into a Skirmish game with up to seven simulated opponents or a choice of human and simulated adversaries. The game can be played online or on a LAN with up to a maximum of 8  players.  There are many types of multiplayer game on offer including timed, resource based, unit based and objective based game play environments.&quot;<br/><br/>"}, "81978": {"poll": [], "name": "Evil Islands: Curse of the Lost Soul", "videogamemode": ["Network Multiplayer", "Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["English/EU Windows release", "US Windows release"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1088427.jpg", "videogametheme": ["Fantasy"], "usersrated": "11", "videogamedeveloper": ["Nival Interactive"], "videogamegenre": ["Action RPG"], "videogameplatform": ["Windows"], "average": "7.26364", "statistics": [], "videogamepublisher": ["Fishtank Interactive"], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1088427_t.jpg", "description": "User Summary:<br/><br/>Evil Islands is an Action RPG incorporating such elements as item crafting and sneaking.

Each turn, the player can move each character once and have them either attack, defend, cast a spell, or use an item. Unlike most Tactical RPGs, battles in Mystaria frequently require something other than eliminating all enemy units to be completed.<br/><br/>Playing as primarily Aragon, the player gathers a team of 12 heroes. The recruitment of team members, however, is non-linear and the story adjusts itself to the newest character that has joined.<br/><br/>Each of the characters have specific fighting techniques and will develop new techniques with practice. Which techniques are learned next depends on which already known techniques the characters practice, allowing creative development of each character.

It's a typical 4X game (eXplore, eXpand, eXploit &amp; eXterminate) : the players all start with either 1 spaceship in space, or one planet, or a small empire, depending on the chosen start scenario. The whole 2 dimensional map is visible, but players have to fly to other planets to see what kind and quantities of raw materials and what sort of climate it has (explore). Also, other players are only visible for as far as they fly in open space within visual distance. Players quickly claim nearby planets (expand) and start mining for minerals, needed to fuel their fleet and build new ships (exploit). Players can build unarmed freighters but also a war fleet, needed to attack their fellow players (exterminate).<br/><br/>A standard game has no victory condition besides what the players agree upon. Which can vary from &quot;till one player is eliminated&quot; and &quot;till one player owns half of the 500 available ships&quot; to &quot;last man standing&quot;.<br/><br/>Each player has to choose one of the 11 unique races, all of them based on Star Trek, Star Wars and Battlestar Galactica (the old TV series). Names are altered, probably for copyright issues, so Darth Vader &amp; Co. is referred to as the Evil Empire, while the Cylons are the Robots. However, the ship depiction leaves little doubt; each player has their own ships with unique characteristics. And so, the heaviest ship the Evil Empire can build, for instance, looks a lot like a Death Star<br/><br/>The base game has 1 fixed map and no option for AI, but mods for variable maps and computer opponents are available as community build freeware. Being an older game, the 'VGA Planets 3 universe' always consisted of 500 planets and also 500 ships (in total), making destroying enemy ships to expand one's own share in those 500 a bojective in it's own. Also, fleet combat was fought in a 1-on-1 scale, so enemies would sort of 'line up' and fighting sequentially, ships fighting on till blown away and taking their damage to the next battle.<br/><br/>VGA Planets 3 was, obviously, preceded by VGA Planets 1 and 2. But this game became far more well known and, eventually, played all over the world.

Players can view the playing field from four different angles, and rotate between them. The game takes place in a fictional landscape of interconnected stages suspended in a dimensional space.

The craft is able to transform - and modify its mobility as a result - between three configurations: a ball, an inverted square pyramid, and a gyroscope. Players navigate the probe through the stages to explore the world within a time limit. The time limit can be extended by collecting power jewels scattered through the world and is decreased by falling off a stage. Stages feature ramps, corridors, and other obstacles that hinder the player from quickly traversing them.

Because a Ghost Master cannot directly interfere in the world of mortals, he is given a team of subordinate ghosts to do so.

Giants went through four years of development before Interplay Entertainment published it on December 6, 2000 for Microsoft Windows. A Mac OS X port was published by MacPlay in 2001 and the game was also ported to the PlayStation 2 later that year.<br/><br/>In the game, players take control of a single character from one of three humanoid races to complete the story or to challenge other players in online multiplayer matches. They can select heavily armed Meccaryns equipped with jet packs, or amphibious spellcasting Sea Reapers. The game's subtitle &quot;Citizen Kabuto&quot; refers to the last selectable race, a thundering behemoth who can execute earthshaking professional wrestling attacks to pulverize its enemies. The single-player mode is framed as a sequential story, putting the player through a series of missions, several of which test the player's reflexes in action game-like puzzles.<br/><br/>Game critics praised Giants for state-of-the-art graphics, humorous story, and success in blending in one genre with another. Criticisms of the game centered on crippling software bugs and lack of an in-game save feature. The console version rectified some of the flaws found in the PC versions, at the cost of removing several features. Giants sold poorly for both Windows and PlayStation 2; however, it enjoyed a successful launch for its small Mac OS X market.<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;Giants: Citizen Kabuto&quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "81586": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic942646.png", "poll": [], "boardgamedesigner": ["Randall N.

Previously, an unofficial fan-made translation patch was made available, allowing non-Japanese players to understand the story.<br/><br/>The story is narrated through manga-style panel illustrations, similar to Phantasy Star IV and Gaiares. The manual of the Virtual Console version includes translation of the Japanese voice and text of the first few narrations.<br/><br/>The story follows Lucia, a 16 year old star fighter pilot in the Earth Federation. A war breaks out between humans and an unknown alien race in the year 2025. Lucia's father, Ken, a high-ranking admiral in the Federation Navy, is captured after his ship is warped out of the combat zone with 4 alien modules which have the ability of teleportation. Lucia, heart-broken after hearing her father's disappearance, decides to hijack the prototype fighter CSH-01-XA &quot;Gleylancer&quot; with the help of her friend Teim and go after her father.<br/><br/>The name of the fighter &quot;Gley Lancer&quot; is possibly a pronunciation error, as the Japanese language does not distinguish &quot;R&quot; and &quot;L&quot;.

One player is Attercop, a spider with a reputation for cunning, and a lady with an appetite. The other is Meratoo, a little spider nervously trying to cross her web. The aim of the game is for Meratoo to make his way from one side of the web to the other, whilst Attercop tries to catch him.<br/><br/>The web consists of 44 connected points, each covered by a &quot;blank&quot; tile.  Meratoo travels from blank tile to blank tile, gently feeling his way accross the Web trying to avoid running into Attercop. Meanwhile, Attercop has a number of tiles to represent her legs, which tease the web and try to bluff the Meratoo player into her grasp, by being able the change the position of the tiles on the web. Here's the catch: the Attercop tiles remain face-down on the web, undistinguishable from the blank tiles, and they can be moved along with the rest of the web tiles. This is how Attercop probes her way around the web.<br/><br/>For Attercop the game is all about bluffing and enticing Meratoo into her grasp. For Meratoo it is all about staying alert, testing the web and calling Attercop's bluff.

It featured solid-filled polygon graphics that could render expansive terrain, and gameplay that was a mixture of first-person tank warfare and tactical simulation. It sold 500,000 copies, a large amount by the standards of the time. [..]<br/><br/>Gameplay<br/><br/>The player is put in the position of a tank platoon commander in charge of four American M1 Abrams tanks in a fictional campaign of battles against the Soviet army in Central Europe. The player can give orders to friendly units via a tactical map of the battle area as well as taking control of a single tank - assuming the role of either the tank commander, driver or gunner.<br/><br/>Depending on the player's tastes, the whole game could be played more like an action/simulation game or like a strategy game. As platoon commander, direct control is limited to the four M1 tanks, however depending on the mission, support units like recon / battle helicopters, IFVs, artillery or other older M60 tanks were available and could be given orders via the tactical map.<br/><br/>One feature of the game was the ability to change the viewpoint to a supporting unit to get a &quot;recon&quot; from that unit's perspective. According to the manual, doing this from the M1 tanks was supposedly approximate to a tank commander standing on his tank hull to get a better perspective. This external view feature was also very good (for the time) for cinematic experiences like the &quot;director's chair&quot; where the viewpoint is set to a helicopter doing reconnaissance. The external view was also able to track other objects in the centre of the view. This was not limited to vehicles but could actually track missiles from the Bradley Infantry Fighting Vehicles or even tank rounds.<br/><br/>Between the battles, surviving crew members increase in military rank and skill - giving the player an incentive to keep his team alive.<br/><br/>The Campaign typically depicted the rush across the Rhine by the numerically superior Russian forces. The Campaign would therefore start as defensive with the challenge being to use technologically superior NATO vehicles to stem the &quot;wave&quot; of Warsaw Pact vehicles. Success would mean the scenarios gradually put NATO on the offensive side with objective waypoints to reach/hold.<br/><br/>Terrain was a very important factor as going hull down was a critical strategy to surviving. Full use of the supporting forces made success easier with even the infantry disembarking from their IFVs to use Dragon anti-tank launchers. However, leaving them in one position too long invited an artillery barrage from the opposing force.<br/><br/>"}, "81626": {"poll": [], "name": "DOR", "videogamemode": ["Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["US Windows Edition"], "average": "0", "videogametheme": ["Adult / Mature", "Anime"], "usersrated": "0", "videogamedeveloper": ["The D.

It has been ported to Linux and Mac OS X; Mac OS X for release in August 2007; the Linux version followed December 5, 2008.<br/><br/>X3: Reunion is the third full game in Egosoft's X series. It is the sequel to X2: The Threat (2003), which in turn followed X: Beyond the Frontier (1999). The X series is often compared to the classic Elite, in that these first-person space adventure games focus on trade and exploration, as well as combat.<br/><br/>This game began as project X2: The Return, Egosoft's planned extension for X2: The Threat. However, as the project advanced, it soon outgrew the constraints of the 'X2 Engine'. In April 2005, Egosoft announced that X2: The Return was cancelled; the next game - using the new X3 Engine - would become X3: Reunion. A month later, they demonstrated the power of the 'X2 Reality Engine' in May's Electronic Entertainment Expo (E3), stunning industry insiders with high-definition moving renders of space stations, planets, and other scenes. X3 was released five months later in October.<br/><br/>It quickly emerged that a number of flaws existed in the retail version of X3 - including a bug which prevented the player from completing the game. Egosoft quickly released a series of patches to fix it, but some reviewers - and players - remained critical, suggesting Egosoft had released the game before it was ready.<br/><br/>Egosoft have continued to expand and develop this game since release: adding new ships, new equipment, a new kind of station, new modding tools, and a new series of missions. New material for this game - official and fan made - is frequently released through Egosoft's Official website.<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia,&quot;<a target='_blank' href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X3' rel='nofollow'>http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X3</a>:_Reunion,&quot; available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "81638": {"videogame": ["X Superbox"], "poll": [], "name": "X\u00b3: Terran Conflict", "videogamemode": ["Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["EU Mac Release", "EU Windows Release", "Japanese Windows Release", "JP Mac Release", "NA Mac Release", "NA Windows Release"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1037127.jpg", "videogameseries": ["X"], "videogametheme": ["Aliens", "Flight", "Science Fiction", "Space"], "usersrated": "19", "videogameexpansion": ["X\u00b3: Albion Prelude"], "videogamedeveloper": ["Deep Silver"], "videogamegenre": ["4x Strategy", "Flight Simulator", "Management"], "videogameplatform": ["Macintosh", "Windows"], "average": "7.45895", "statistics": [], "videogamepublisher": ["Egosoft"], "videogamecompilation": ["X Superbox"], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1037127_t.jpg", "description": "X3: Terran Conflict (X3TC), is a space trading and combat simulator from German developer Egosoft and is the culmination of their X series of computer games. Described as a stand alone game, based on X3: Reunion, it boasts new plot lines, features and assets. It was first released on October 2008 for the European market and Steam.<br/><br/>X3: Terran Conflict is based in the same universe and using the same engine. X3: Reunion had several popular fan made mods, the most popular of which was named The X-Tended Mod. The Mod was created by a team of artists, musicians and modders and added new content and functionality to the game. XTM received attention from Egosoft who interviewed members of the team and hosted the mod for future downloads. X3: Terran Conflict has several assets used by the XTM mod and several members of the XTM team worked closely with Egosoft to develop the game.<br/><br/>Following the announcement of the game, several screenshots and videos were made available, showing gameplay, new features and content. A teaser trailer for X3: Terran Conflict was made available one month after the game was announced. It featured several new ships, stations, weapon systems and graphical effects. Terran ships, which were first seen in X3: Reunion's finale, made an appearance in this trailer.<br/><br/>A series of four informative gameplay videos were slowly released throughout the course of development. They were titled after each of the games main gameplay premises; Trade, Fight, Build and Think. These videos featured a narrative introducing several new features in Terran Conflict. The first video, entitled Build was made available on July 30, 2008. Focusing on station construction and player progression, this video reveals the existence of new stations and ship classes, as well as a new gameplay feature to control large numbers of ships. This video confirms that the player headquarters, which was introduced in X3: Reunion version 2.0, is available in X3: Terran Conflict.<br/><br/>A developer blog was made available, documenting several experiences with the game development by several team members. An XTM and X3: Terran Conflict developer Bobby Wilkinson, known in the X3 community as Syklon, was the first to post, detailing some new aspects of the game.<br/><br/>&quot;Source: Wikipedia, &quot;X\u00b3: Terran Conflict,&quot; available under the CC-BY-SA License.&quot;<br/><br/>"}, "81639": {"poll": [], "name": "BMX on the Moon", "videogamemode": ["Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["BBC Micro release"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic805672.jpg", "videogametheme": ["Science Fiction", "Sports - Bicycling"], "usersrated": "0", "videogamedeveloper": ["Superior Software (UK)"], "videogamegenre": ["Scrolling"], "videogameplatform": ["BBC Micro"], "average": "0", "statistics": [], "videogamepublisher": ["Superior Software (UK)"], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic805672_t.jpg", "description": "It's BMX riding.

Each artwork requires money and resources to complete. To earn the money and resources the artists need, the players send their workers to labor in various workshops, possibly even in their opponents&rsquo; districts. Additional workers can be earned by offering charity to the church. During the game, players will earn prestige points, primarily by completing artworks. prestige points can be spent during the game, but at the end of the game they will be the player&rsquo;s primary source of victory points.<br/><br/>All of the characters in the game are real historical figures that lived and worked in Italy during the Renaissance.

This can be seen as a discrete set of phases, except that they all proceed simultaneously. The exception is at the beginning of the game where the player has unlimited time in the planning phase before the game clock starts.<br/><br/>In the planning phase, the player first allocates the funds they have to various budget items, like crew selection, station modules, and research and development. Then they choose their crew, who have intrinsic task sets (like piloting and physics), and varying levels of competence and compatibility with other potential employees. From there the player purchases equipment like space suits and satellites, and station modules like laboratories and solar arrays. Then they schedule their launches using the two space shuttles available (Atlantis and Discovery, though the initial release used Challenger), and have their budget approved. In the final stage of the planning phase the player can create a simulated station with an unlimited number of parts, and without dealing with the later constrictions of the EVA.<br/><br/>The launch phase has the player decide whether launch conditions are stable enough to merit launch. If they give the implicit go-ahead, they engage in a light arcade sequence where the player attempts to keep the shuttle on course throughout its orbital burn. The more successful the player is, the closer the shuttle will be to the station.<br/><br/>Once the shuttle is in orbit, the player is tasked to assemble the components they brought up (or to fire off any satellites they have contracts for) in the Extra-Vehicular Activity, or EVA phase. Here the player directly controls an Orbital Construction Pod, a small ship with mechanical arms that an astronaut can use to move large equipment. Being careless here could have consequences as the pod or equipment may become damaged, and it may run out of fuel and become stranded until another pod can rescue it. Consequences were not limited to equipment damage: Stranded astronauts in pods could die when oxygen ran out. Other crew hazards included solar flares, which could kill astronauts on the station or shuttle if precautions (using an emergency module in station design) were not taken. Crew died in reverse alphabetical order from solar flares.<br/><br/>The player then transfers crew to and from the space station and assigns them to research tasks. Completing these tasks awards the player with government contracts that supplement NASA's budget.<br/><br/>Finally the player lands the shuttle. After determining that landing conditions are adequate, the player again keeps the shuttle on course as it turns from the station and enters its descent. Skill here determines how close the shuttle will be to the optimal point from the runway. After this the player controls the shuttle with a simple landing simulator viewed from the side. The more abrupt or overshot the landing, the more damage will be done to the shuttle and the longer it will need to be repaired before it can venture out on another mission.<br/><br/>The game is played using a menu system. Every option can be queried for in-game help, and every major task has a tutorial that simulates that task without the consequences of failure, and sometimes with additional assistance (like being able to pause a landing attempt). Another major feature is the message system that alerts the player when there are changes to mission status, wherever the player might be within the menu system.<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;Project Space Station&quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "81647": {"rpgartist": ["(Uncredited)"], "rpg": ["Pathfinder System Compatible Product"], "statistics": [], "name": "WARPATH: Rules for Mass Combat", "rpgdesigner": ["Gareth-Michael Skarka", "Hank Woon"], "rpgproducer": ["(Uncredited)"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic799393.jpg", "usersrated": "1", "rpgitemversion": ["PDF version", "Softcover Version"], "average": "8", "rpggenre": ["Fantasy"], "rpgpublisher": ["Adamant Entertainment", "Cubicle 7 Entertainment"], "rpgcategory": ["Sourcebook (rules/options to enhance play)"], "poll": [], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic799393_t.jpg", "description": "From the publisher:<br/><br/>Cry Havoc and Let Slip The Dogs of War!<br/><br/>The clash of grand armies comes to your game world!

The player has an assortment of vehicles to choose from, such as a sports car, a sedan, a station wagon, an SUV, a convertible, a bus, and a truck. The game is notable for the special effects when a player crashes. The screen will show a broken windshield as if you had crashed into something--as this would become a theme in later games in the series--and show a violent image before resetting you at the place where you made the mistake. Also notable is when a player finishes a race depending on how much time was left on the clock. When this happens, the computer will rate your driving technique as well as add up how many accidents the player had and how much money in damage the player has caused--and assigns a final rating, which can suffer badly if too many objects are hit or accidents are caused.<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;Thrill Drive&quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "81656": {"poll": [], "name": "Bounces", "videogamemode": ["Local Multiplayer", "Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["UK Commodore 64 Tape cassette"], "average": "0", "videogametheme": ["Science Fiction"], "usersrated": "0", "videogamedeveloper": ["Denton Designs"], "videogamegenre": ["Sports"], "videogameplatform": ["Commodore 64"], "statistics": [], "videogamepublisher": ["Beyond Software (UK)"], "description": "User Summary<br/><br/>Bounches is a sports game of the future.

The player character, a small green creature called Pogo, is on a mission to destroy eight towers that have been built onto the sea, by planting bombs at the towers' peaks. Pogo's progress is hindered by enemies and obstacles, which he has to avoid in order to reach the top of the tower.<br/><br/>The actual game play happens at each tower in turn. Pogo starts from the bottom and has to find his way up to the top. The towers are cylinder-shaped and have ledges on their outside, either horizontal, forming stairs or connected by elevators. Because of the cylindrical shape, the towers have no &quot;left&quot; or &quot;right&quot; edges, instead allowing Pogo to walk all around the tower.<br/><br/>A graphical innovation, and perhaps the most notable feature of the game, is that when Pogo walks left or right, he always stays in the centre of the visible screen. Instead of the Pogo sprite moving, the tower behind him turns clockwise or counterclockwise with a convincing sense of depth.

In most versions of the game, the player can choose between playing as the Fourth, Fifth or Seventh Doctor; in the MS-DOS version, the player can play as the Second, Fourth or Seventh Doctor, and in the ZX Spectrum version only the Seventh Doctor was available. A second player may play as the Doctor's companion (Ace or a UNIT soldier (only Ace in the Spectrum version). K-9 also makes appearances later in the game as does Davros, creator of the Daleks in the TV series, as the final end of level boss.<br/><br/>The game was released on all major formats of the time except for the Amstrad CPC, which was announced but never released. It was designed and storyboarded by 221B Software Development. On the PC and Amiga versions, there was a secret room behind some blocks. The room gave some of the programming credits for each game, in particular the graphics and music. The credits were hidden in this way due to the BBC not wanting individual credits for the game development team to be included in the game. Perhaps surprisingly, the PC version, which had the most sophisticated graphics, and the ZX Spectrum version, the most basic version, were both coded by the same person.[citation needed] This was due to the similarities between Z80 and 8086 assembly language.<br/><br/>Alternative Software released the ZX Spectrum version only due to popular demand, since by 1992 the Spectrum was no longer a commercially viable platform. Dalek Attack was released for the Spectrum in 1993, and was the last licensed Spectrum game. It differed from all the others in its first level; in all the other releases the first level involved the Doctor on a hoverboard going along the sewer. The Spectrum version had the Doctor on foot running around collecting hostages and avoiding globes. The Spectrum version also lost out on other features such as different enemies; only the Robomen, Ogrons and standard Daleks featured. The end-level guardians were also different.<br/><br/>Other versions of the game featured special Daleks such as hovering Daleks from the TV Century 21 comics strips of the 1960s. 1960s &quot;movie&quot; Daleks also made an appearance, as did the special weapons Dalek from Remembrance of the Daleks. Another special Dalek also featured, based on a sketch in an article from the Doctor Who Magazine 10th anniversary special showing how a Dalek might look when the television series came back.<br/><br/>The game was later re-released, first in a three pack compilation set called the Sci-Fi Collection with two other titles (Galactic Warrior Rats, Suburban Commando) for the PC. The front cover was in a &quot;Y&quot; shape with Dalek Attack in the bottom right and the instruction booklet was photocopied. This was followed in 1994/95 by another re-release, which was the same as the original except for a purple and black border added to the front and back covers.<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;Dalek Attack&quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "81673": {"videogamebg": ["Cribbage"], "name": "Cribbage", "videogamemode": ["Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["BBC Micro Edition"], "average": "0", "videogametheme": ["Other"], "usersrated": "0", "videogamedeveloper": ["Superior Software (UK)"], "videogamegenre": ["Classic Games"], "videogameplatform": ["BBC Micro"], "poll": [], "statistics": [], "videogamepublisher": ["Superior Software (UK)"], "description": "User Summary<br/><br/>The computer version of Cribbage.

It is considered the spiritual successor in the Operation Flashpoint-series following its predecessor, ArmA: Armed Assault (ArmA: Combat Operations in North America). ARMA 2 was released in summer 2009. An expansion pack titled ArmA 2: Operation Arrowhead was released in 2010.<br/><br/>Gameplay<br/><br/>ArmA 2 is a tactical shooter with significant vehicle and aircraft elements. The player is able to command AI squad members which adds a real-time strategy element to the game. This is further enhanced by introduction of the  high command system, which allows the player to command multiple squads using the map. ARMA 2 is set primarily in the fictional Eastern European nation of Chernarus, (meaning &quot;Black Russia&quot;). The Chernarus landscape is based heavily on the Czech Republic, the home country of the developer.<br/>[..]<br/><br/>Setting<br/><br/>The game takes place in autumn 2009 in the eastern part of a fictional post-Soviet state called Chernarus, particularly the region of South Zagoria and the remote island of &Uacute;tes.<br/><br/>The area of approximately 225 km&sup2; is based on actual satellite photos of \u010cesk&eacute; St\u0159edoho\u0159&iacute;. All necessary data is loaded silently in the background, therefore the player is at no time interrupted by any loading screens while traveling through the terrain, though there are loading screens between episodes.<br/>[..]<br/><br/>Equipment<br/><br/>ARMA 2 features around 80 realistically-represented weapons with many variants from including assault rifles, machine guns, and missile launchers. There are around 130 vehicle variants, and any vehicle that exists in-game can be controlled by the player, including everything from civilian cars, tractors and bicycles. Similarly, all aircraft encountered in the game can be flown by the player. All have limited fuel and realistic weapon loadouts.<br/><br/>Ballistics<br/><br/>All weapons have realistically simulated ballistics. Rounds travel in parabolic trajectories and show effects of bullet drop dependent on their caliber. Muzzle velocities are modeled, and rounds lose velocity and knockdown power over time traveled. The ranges at which weapons are zeroed are, however, fixed by the game. Sniper rifles can use stadiametric rangefinding to adjust for long-range shots. US rifles use mil-dot scopes while Russian rifles use Bullet Drop Compensation (BDC) scopes such as the PSO-1.<br/>[..]<br/><br/>Engine<br/><br/>ARMA 2 uses the third-generation Real Virtuality (PDF) game engine, which has been in development for over 10 years and of which previous versions are used in training simulators by militaries around the world. This engine has full DirectX 9 support (Shader Model 3).<br/><br/>It features realistic day-night cycles, changing weather, fog and visibility, and a view distance of up to 10 kilometres. Every weapon in the game fires projectiles with real trajectories, drop off, and penetration characteristics. As such, no weapon system in the game is a &quot;guaranteed&quot; hit - only after the engine has simulated the event can it be determined if a given shot or missile has hit the target.<br/><br/>The number of agents supported by the engine is limited mainly by computer performance. This allows a wide range of scenarios to be played, from small unit actions up to large-scale battles. Almost all events in the game are dynamically defined, including most unit speech and AI choices about how to evaluate and respond to specific situations in the game world: scenarios rarely unfold the same way twice - although a side with an overwhelming advantage will tend to win consistently.<br/><br/>The player can choose to turn their head independently from their weapon / body, unlike in most shooters where the view is locked to the weapon. This allows players to look left and right while running forwards to maintain awareness of the battlefield or to look around while in a confined space without having to lower their weapon.<br/><br/>In order to make immersive missions faster to develop and less predictable, ARMA 2 features an optional &quot;ambient battle&quot; feature in which the world around the player can automatically be populated by friendly and hostile units who will engage in combat.<br/>[..]<br/><br/>Reception<br/><br/>ARMA 2 has been praised for its realism, graphics, and the sheer scale of the game. However, as with the original Armed Assault, the game has received criticism for the number of bugs it contained on release and the quality of the AI. A reviewer at TheReticule.com ultimately felt that though at times it &quot;doesn't work&quot;, the game is &quot;a genuinely excellent game of the same pedigree of Operation Flashpoint and has done a lot of [sic] regain my faith in BIS&quot;.  Another reviewer noted that the game managed to show the &quot;job of a real soldier today: contact with the population&quot;, something that is lacking in other similar games. The developers have since released several patches addressing common bugs.<br/>[..]<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;ARMA 2&quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "81682": {"poll": [], "name": "Powerball", "videogamemode": ["Local Multiplayer", "Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["North American Genesis edition", "Wii Virtual Console edition"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic814778.jpg", "videogametheme": ["Sports - Other"], "usersrated": "0", "videogamedeveloper": ["Namco Ltd."], "videogamegenre": ["Sports"], "videogameplatform": ["SEGA Genesis", "Wii"], "average": "0", "statistics": [], "videogamepublisher": ["Namco Ltd."], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic814778_t.jpg", "description": "Eight different teams representing various nations are vying to become the Powerball champions, and you control one of the eight in your quest for the championship.

The game was designed using the Madden '93 engine, and features a different take on football, where the games resemble a war as much as a sporting competition.<br/>  Electronic Arts ported the game to the PlayStation Portable as part of EA Replay. It was released in the United States on November 14, 2006 and features wireless multiplayer. The PSP allowed a higher resolution for the game than seen on the Genesis, therefore bringing greater graphics to the game when played on a television screen via the new PSP Slim &amp; Lite's output capabilities.<br/><br/>GAMEPLAY:<br/>  The game deviates from usual football simulations in several ways. Most notably it takes place in a post-apocalyptic world where radiation has caused the human race to mutate and the dead to rise from the grave. The game instruction manual states that the exact causes of the upheaval have been lost or corrupted, due to (among many things) the chaos of an alien invasion, spin control, a sloppy filing system set up by a temp, and what appears to be barbecue sauce.<br/>  Landmines, fire pits, and other hazards (such as areas being open to empty space) litter the field, which can be made of rock, ice, or even toxic waste or rubber, and players can lose health or die during the run of play (upon which they will fumble). Teams have special Nasty Audibles, which are dirty (not to mention excessively violent) tricks such as exploding balls, invisibility, electric shocks, jet packs, or jumping the other quarterback with intent to kill, that lead to big gains and/or horrific casualties.<br/>  Each team can &quot;bribe ref&quot; twice per game (once in each half), after which, the bought referee will call phony penalties (e.g. 5-yard penalty for crying) on the opposing team. This will last for a few plays, but the other team usually tries to kill him (one of the Nasty Audibles that can actually be played at any time) immediately after the first dirty call. A slain Ref is then replaced by an even tougher one, who will promptly call another 5-yard penalty on the murdering team for Ref Bashing. Note that accidental referee deaths, such as being caught in the middle of a pileup, or nudged into a mine, are not penalized.<br/>  Gameplay can take place in the form of a pickup game or full-season mode. Successfully winning the championship game in season mode results in the losing team exploding spontaneously, and the winning team's MVP perishing by induction into the &quot;Hole of Flame&quot;, the induction ceremony of which entitles the game referees to snatch the MVP and stuff him into a firepit.<br/><br/>TEAMS:<br/>  Teams are composed of aliens, skeletons, robots, trolls, and superhumans. Seven players are on the field for each team, instead of the usual eleven. Many of the teams are based on real life teams, with names like the Deathskin Razors and the Midway Monsters (Oakland Raiders and Chicago Bears, respectively). Players also have humorous names, like Bones Jackson (Bo Jackson), K.T. Slayer (Lawrence Taylor), Joe Magician (Joe Montana) and Scary Ice (Jerry Rice). However, despite all the death and destruction, the competition aspect is still high, and requires much strategy, especially compared to games like NFL Blitz.<br/><br/>TRIVIA:<br/>      * This game was followed by a spinoff entitled Mutant League Hockey. A basketball game, Mutant League Basketball, was in development, but it was never released.<br/>    * These games were also used as the basis for an animated series called Mutant League, which aired from 1994 to 1996.<br/>    * This game was similar to the Games Workshop game Blood Bowl. Both games feature mutants or monsters on each team, though Blood Bowl was developed first.<br/>    * In the Xbox 360 version of the video game Madden NFL 09, there is an achievement worth 50 gamerscore entitled &quot;Midway Monster&quot;. The achievement is unlocked by creating a player named &quot;Bones Jackson&quot; and placing him on the Chicago Bears.&quot;<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;Mutant League Football&quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "81724": {"poll": [], "name": "Okage: Shadow King", "videogamemode": ["Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["North American PlayStation 2 edition"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1303451.jpg", "videogametheme": ["Cute Fantasy", "Occult"], "usersrated": "8", "videogamedeveloper": ["Zener Works"], "videogamegenre": ["RPG"], "videogameplatform": ["PlayStation 2"], "average": "6.78125", "statistics": [], "videogamepublisher": ["Sony Computer Entertainment"], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1303451_t.jpg", "description": "User Summary<br/><br/>Okage: Shadow King has fairly standard turn-based RPG gameplay, and a fairly non-standard story.

It was released as Apache in the United States.<br/><br/>Apache is a combat flight simulator of the American AH-64D Apache Longbow helicopter.<br/><br/>[It is n]ot to be confused with Apache (video game) or AH-64D Longbow (video game).<br/><br/>It runs in DOS and has fairly minimal requirements considering that it was published during a period when Intel Pentium microprocessor-based PC systems were first becoming common. The game comes with a printed 90 page manual.<br/><br/>The mac version will run on any PPC with System 9.<br/><br/>Menus in the simulation<br/><br/>On game start up a short video is played then the player is presented with different menus.<br/><br/>One of these is the Main Screen which has a quick start option, flight option, preferences (game preferences) option and a Pilot's Log option (The player can choose his pilot's name).<br/><br/>The Flight Options menu has a training option (In Fort Hood, Texas), a Single Mission option, a campaign option, a network option (for network multiplayer) and a Two Player option.<br/><br/>Another menu presented whether in Single Player or Campaign Mode is the World Map in which combat will take place in 3 areas (Yemen, Korea or Cyprus).<br/><br/>The training in the game is extensive and teaches the use of weapon systems, navigation and helicopter avionics systems. In single player mode the player can choose which mission that he or she prefers to select in the 3 areas.<br/><br/>In campaign mode the player can choose which 3 areas he wishes to enter in a tour of duty. The Campaign mode also plays video clips and has a briefing before any mission. In addition there is a Briefing Menu before the player goes into combat which has a Mission Description and then when the player selects the mission a detailed mission map (like a mission editor) is shown with the flight plan and the player can chose his desired ordnance, zoom in on the map, given a satellite view of the area or target and given meteorological data. The Briefing is also narrated with an American speaker and this narration also takes place in the campaign mode.<br/><br/>Gameplay<br/><br/>A joystick is preferred and a soundcard is desired in the simulation to fully enjoy this titles multimedia gameplay. The graphics are pretty simple in the simulation either 320 by 200 pixels or 640 by 480 pixels but the detailing on each vehicle or ship is more than adequate.<br/><br/>Apache is rated as a PC Gamer editors choice game with a high rating and the simulation is almost on par with Jane's Longbow simulation although it lacks the sophisticated avionics of that title.<br/><br/>There are quite a lot of vehicles and ships in this simulation which is similar to Digital Integration's earlier flight simulation Tornado in layout and gameplay.<br/><br/>Graphics are simple gourad shaded polygons, but many are used on cities and airfields giving the impression of a detailed landscape for the time period (1995). Ground Battles can be seen taking place when in combat. All the missions and campaigns in this simulation are fictional and hypothetical.<br/><br/>The simulator plays a pleasant non vocal rock music theme when one is in the menus but not when one is in the simulation. It has good combat sound tracks of weapons being fired and combat crew talk when on a mission. There is a hotkey which pauses the simulation and takes the player into an electronic manual of the simulation. This can be helpful if one forgets the key to activate a particular function in the game.<br/><br/>Vehicles<br/>Allies<br/><br/>A number of allied units are present in the game, including F-15 Eagle fighters, UH-60 Black Hawk helicopters, M113 armored personnel carriers, Patriot missile launchers, and M1A1 Abrams main battle tanks.<br/><br/>Enemies<br/>A variety of enemy units are present as well, including Mi-24 Hind helicopters, AH-1 Super Cobra helicopters, MiG-27 ground attack fighters, C-130 Hercules transports, MiG-29 fighters, Su-25 fighters, and F-16 Fighting Falcon fighters.<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;Apache Longbow (video game)&quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "81746": {"boardgamedesigner": ["Markus Gunter", "Gessi Martin"], "average": "6", "poll": [], "name": "El Peregrino", "playingtime": "0", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": ["Roll / Spin and Move"], "yearpublished": "2007", "usersrated": "1", "maxplayers": "8", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1364954_t.jpg", "boardgameartist": ["Markus Gunter", "Angelika Jessner", "Gessi Martin"], "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["Innovatum"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1364954.jpg", "boardgameversion": ["Innovatum first edition"], "maxplaytime": "0", "boardgamecategory": ["Religious", "Travel"], "age": "0", "minplaytime": "0", "description": "Boardgame about the Way of St. James.

The Campaign mode features video clips as well as a detailed briefing before each mission, complete with a mission description, a detailed map and the ability to choose the desired ordnance.<br/><br/>It can be linked over IPX and modem networks with Apache Longbow, making it one of the first multiplayer, multisimulator games ever - something Digital Integration has trademarked as 'virtual battlefield'.<br/><br/>As with its predecessor, Apache Longbow, Hind features a rather unusual and very realistic cooperative multiplayer mode where two players can occupy the same helicopter, with one piloting the helicopter while the other manages weapons (as Weapons System Officer, or WSO).<br/><br/>Gameplay<br/><br/>Not one, but two joysticks are needed to be able to handle the chopper gracefully; a trait which crippled the games sales. Many complex physics effects are modelled, including ground effect, vortex ring, retreating blade stall and autorotation. Options are included to simplify the flight model for beginners [ User edit: and for which 1 joystick is perfectly adequate ].<br/><br/>Some of the missions and campaigns in the game are fictional, but the Afghanistan campaign is based on the 1980s Soviet War in Afghanistan.<br/><br/>Ground battles between individual soldiers can be seen taking place, since AI controlled infantry have been added. Soldiers can also be carried aboard the Hind helicopter and are a vital part of some missions.<br/><br/>If the player does nothing, an (almost) endless, semi-random and realistic war will be played out in each mission via a combination of scripted scenarios and very basic AI The 'war' can be passively watched using the features for zooming in on and moving about each active unit.<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;Hind (computer game)&quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "81748": {"poll": [], "name": "Elizabeth Find M.D. Diagnosis Mystery", "videogamemode": ["Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["NA Mac Edition", "NA Windows Edition"], "average": "0", "videogametheme": ["Medical"], "usersrated": "0", "videogamedeveloper": ["ValuSoft"], "videogamegenre": ["Puzzle"], "videogameplatform": ["Macintosh", "Windows"], "statistics": [], "videogamepublisher": ["Big Fish Games", "ValuSoft"], "description": "Welcome to the life and death drama of the Emergency Room!

AH-64D Longbow was the second simulator released under the Jane's Combat Simulators line from Electronic Arts.<br/><br/>It had the most authentic flight model for a helicopter (for its time), and every aspect of the electronics systems were meticulously detailed.

It was developed by Sonalysts Inc. and published by Electronic Arts (EA). The game licensed parts of Jane's Information Group's military information database, which was used as an in-game &quot;Jane's Library&quot;, reference material that the player could refer to while in-game. Jane's also licensed to EA the &quot;Jane's&quot; name and the &quot;Jane's Combat Simulations&quot; logo, and the game was marketed under the &quot;Jane's&quot; name,<br/>[..]<br/><br/>Gameplay<br/><br/>n terms of gameplay, as a real-time tactics  game it is a realistic military simulator and does not involve resource management of any sort. The scenario defines the units that a player has at the beginning of the scenario, and the player can never have more than what they started with until the scenario ends. Like other real-time tactics games, losses cannot be replaced, which emphasizes the value of units and the judicious use of them (though some scenarios make it impossible to save a particular unit). The military realism is emphasized further by such means as using some authentic NTDS  symbology on the 2D tactical planning map. Much of the game and mission events are presented in the form of full-motion video sequences.<br/><br/>Gameplay can be chosen from one of three different options. First is a series of preset missions that contain certain objectives. These missions contain specific goals that must be accomplished in order to be graded successfully. They vary in difficulty from one star to four with four stars being the most difficult. A second game play theme is to play one of four provided scenarios. These are generally &quot;wars&quot; verses &quot;battles&quot; that require the player to win each successive challenge before continuing. The last type of game play is using a feature called &quot;mission editing,&quot; where a player can input their own configurations and force strength and objectives. Preset mission objectives and goals can be inputed into the editor and displayed to the player at various intervals throughout gameplay. Inputed objectives can be configured in such a way that they must be completed in predetermined orders for the overall mission to be successful. The programming skills necessary are quite basic and are a credit to the ingenuity of the software designers.<br/><br/>The &quot;mission editor&quot; feature is simple to use and relatively uncommon in other game play software. The feature enables players to interface directly with the software and provide a relatively limitless amount of possible combat scenarios.<br/><br/>Setting<br/><br/>The game is set in the late 1990s. The game focused exclusively on contemporary units. Units that were in service when the game was released were featured, and units that were out of service or not yet in service were not featured. The game reflects that some of the world's military forces are more advanced than others.<br/><br/>Realism<br/><br/>The game is basically a naval combat strategic training simulator. It covers the full spectrum of modern naval operations, including submarine warfare, surface warfare, naval aviation, and electronic warfare. Air Force, Marine Corps and Army units are also modeled in the game, although the Army units are generally static. Although the initial release focused mainly on the U.S. Military, it did include a wide variety of forces from nations around the world including the U.K., India, Russia, China, and others. The actual forces under a player's command can include units from several nations (a multi-national force), or it may be limited to a selection of forces from just the one nation's military Arsenal.<br/><br/>The game includes both aircraft carriers and land-based air bases. It maintains a level of realism in that aircraft that are limited to land-based operations in real life are similarly limited to land-based operations in the game. This prevents the player from having heavy bombers (like the B-52) taking off or landing from aircraft carriers, something that never happens in the real world. Moreover, only aircraft that are actually assigned to a particular class of aircraft carrier in real life are available on in-game carriers. This concept of realism in units carries through to the weaponry, ordinance, speed, accuracy, radar coverage, detectability, and survivability of all of the units and weapons in the game. One feature that was deliberately kept out of the game was nuclear weapons.<br/><br/>Game Dynamics<br/><br/>In a single-player game, the player starts by selecting a stand-alone scenario or a campaign scenario. Campaign scenarios are linked in that if the player successfully completes a scenario in the campaign, this unlocks the next scenario in that campaign for play. However, the game is limited in that it can only ever have the one campaign available to the player at any one time. In fact, the original version of the game only included one campaign (since then, several replacement campaigns have been made by FC and NWP-FC enthusiasts). A stand-alone scenario is not linked to other scenarios like the campaign scenarios are, although they may be related in terms of setting, theater-of-war, combatants, alliances, fictitious or historical conflicts, etc.<br/><br/>Once the player is in the scenario, a 2-D representation of the forces available is presented. This display also shows a representation of the sensor (radar, visual, sonar, etc.) ranges that any of his units have. Individual units are shown in a 3D rendering. If the player has selected the EMCOMS option, none of his units start the game with active sensors on; only passive sensors will be engaged. This can be an effective strategy for keeping the player's ships undetected, but it also blinds their GCI and leaves them &quot;groping in the dark&quot;, so to speak. If the player has AWACS aircraft and/or fighter jets available, these are often the first units deployed; it is important to find the enemy before they find you.<br/><br/>Trivia<br/><br/>The United States Naval Academy actually had the game installed in computer labs and used it to introduce prospective students to the concepts of fleet level decision making during its Summer Seminar program.<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;Jane's Combat Simulations: Fleet Command&quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "81772": {"poll": [], "name": "Galaforce", "videogamemode": ["Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["BBC Micro Edition"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic806222.jpg", "videogametheme": ["Space"], "usersrated": "0", "videogamedeveloper": ["Superior Software (UK)"], "videogamegenre": ["Shoot 'em Up"], "videogameplatform": ["BBC Micro"], "average": "0", "statistics": [], "videogamepublisher": ["Superior Software (UK)"], "videogamecompilation": ["Play It Again Sam 2"], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic806222_t.jpg", "description": "User Summary<br/><br/>Galaforce is a Space Invaders clone, with a variety of alien craft coming onto the screen from all directions.

It was created by Looking Glass Studios, then finished by Mad Doc Software. It was published by Xicat Interactive, Inc.. It was released in the North America on March 22, 2002<br/><br/>In Attack Squadron, players control World War II aircraft across Europe. There is an array of missions to carryout such as bombing targets, including a torpedo dropping mission. Depending on the mission, players may take control of different types of aircraft such as a Boeing B-17 or Germany's Ju-88. Other flyable aircraft in the simulation include the P-51 D Mustang, P-38 J Lightning, P-47D Thunderbolt, Supermarine Spitfire Mk1a, Supermarine Spitfire MkIX, Bf-109 E-4/B Emil, Bf-109 G-6 Gustav, FW-190 A-4 Wurger, FW-190 A-8 Wurger, FW-190 D-9 Dora, Me-262 A1-b Schwalbe, B-24 D Liberator and the Avro Lancaster Mk1. Ground units featured in the simulation include on the Axis side a diesel locomotive, steam locomotive, Volkswagen Kubelwagen 2, Opel Blitz 3-ton truck, 4 and 1/2 ton diesel fueltanker, Sdkfz 251, Jagdpanzer IV, Pzkfw IV, Pzkfw V Panther, Pzkfw VI Tiger, 2 cm Flak 30, 2 cm Flakvierling 38, 8.8 cm Flak 34, Flakpanzer IV Ostwind, Flakpanzer Wirbelwind, 15 cm s. Feldhaubitze 18, Wespe. Allied ground units include the Studebaker 6X6 2.5 ton tanker truck, 1/4 ton utility truck &quot;Jeep&quot;, Deuce and a half truck, F3 GMC petrol tanker, M3A1 Half-Track, M18 &quot;Hellcat&quot; GMC, M4 &quot;Sherman&quot; medium tank, Bofors 40mm Anti-aircraft gun, M16 Multiple Gun Motor Carriage and the M12 &quot;King-Kong&quot; 155mm GMC. Naval units featured in the simulation include on the axis side the German torpedo boat &quot;E-boat&quot;, GN type VIIC U-boat and GNS Bismark-class battleship. Allied naval units include a Royal Navy rescue launch trawler, Liberty Ship and a US Navy Buckley class destroyer. Merchant Ships can be either Allied or Axis.<br/><br/>The multiplayer mode offers players the chance to take part in deathmatches allowing players to have dog fights.<br/><br/>Single Player mode has 5 missions total for either the USAAF, RAF or Luftwaffe. The missions include for the USAAF Operation Ratchet for bombing a German Rocket factory and Airfield Attack for attacking a Luftwaffe airfield. The RAF mission is called Wehrmacht Convoy in which you attack a convoy of German trucks. The Luftwaffe Missions are Channel Strike, attacking allied merchant ships, and Enemy Bombers Spotted, intercept allied bombers attempting to destroy a Luftwaffe airfield.<br/><br/>Quick Player mode is an option to choose the combat environment (fighters or bombers, altitude, target type etc.) and to choose friendly flight aircraft for a maximum total of 12 aircraft against a maximum enemy flight aircraft total of 12.<br/><br/>Campaign mode has just one Axis campaign, The Kanal Front, in which you attack English targets in the Channel and in southern England after 1943. The Allied campaign is Fortress Europe. The objective of the campaign is to attack Axis positions in the European Theater of Operations during 1944 before and after D-Day. The campaigns each feature 10 missions total.<br/><br/>Pilot Training is an area in which there are five training features for this simulation, some of which are not exactly Pilot Training missions. There is a Takeoff Lesson, a Landing Lesson, a Torpedo Attack Lesson, a Norden Bombsight Lesson and a Fixed Bombsight Lesson.<br/><br/>Jane's Attack Squadron also has a game options screen and a credit screen. The simulation plays 1940's style swing music in the menus just like the earlier Jane's WWII Fighters in feel. However the musical selection is much more limited than Jane's WWII Fighters. The simulation doesn't have the Ace Pilot interviews or the Museum Area that Jane's WWII Fighters has. However, it does have a reference area for the featured aircraft, ground and naval units. A mission editor is included with the game.<br/><br/>Development<br/><br/>Looking Glass Studios spent two and a half years developing the game, but Electronic Arts decided no longer to publish simulators and so pulled funding. After Looking Glass had stopped developing the game, an online petition was initiated by an employee of the company to encourage Electronic Arts to let the team complete it. Over 2000 signatures were gathered.<br/><br/>A deal between Xicat Interactive, Inc. and Jane's Information Group was made which allowed Mad Doc Software to finish the game and Xicat Interactive, Inc. to license and publish it<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;Jane's Attack Squadron&quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "81786": {"poll": [], "name": "Cyber Rats", "videogamemode": ["Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["ZX Spectrum Edition"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic937004.jpg", "videogametheme": ["Animals", "Science Fiction"], "usersrated": "2", "videogamedeveloper": ["Silversoft"], "videogamegenre": ["Shoot 'em Up"], "videogameplatform": ["ZX Spectrum"], "average": "5.25", "statistics": [], "videogamepublisher": ["Silversoft"], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic937004_t.jpg", "description": "User Summary<br/><br/>Cyber Rats was an early shoot em up game for the ZX Spectrum, in which the player controls a gun that moves across the bottom of the screen and tries to shoot down foes as they approach from the top.<br/><br/>Unlike similar games such as Centipede, where the foe starts as a single chain which is shot apart by the player, in Cyber Rats the enemies start out as separate entities which move down the screen rapidly by bouncing off obstacles on the screen.<br/><br/>"}, "81787": {"poll": [], "name": "Orbiter", "videogamemode": ["Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["ZX Spectrum edition"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic937005.jpg", "videogametheme": ["Space"], "usersrated": "2", "videogamedeveloper": ["Silversoft"], "videogamegenre": ["Scrolling", "Shoot 'em Up"], "videogameplatform": ["ZX Spectrum"], "average": "5.25", "statistics": [], "videogamepublisher": ["Silversoft"], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic937005_t.jpg", "description": "User Summary<br/><br/>Orbiter was a shoot em up for the ZX Spectrum in the style of the classic game Defender, in which you fly a spacecraft over a horizontally scrolling landscape shooting waves of aliens to protect the humans on the ground.<br/><br/>"}, "81788": {"rpgartist": ["Even Mehl Amundsen", "Yoann Boissonnet", "Andrew Bosley", "Tyshan Carey", "Christophe Swal"], "rpgitemversion": ["PDF Version", "Softcover version"], "poll": [], "name": "Blood in Ferelden", "rpgdesigner": ["Walt Ciechanowski", "Kevin Kulp (II)", "T.

The game utilizes the foot pedal system, just like Time Crisis, where players can shoot or hide from enemy fire. One modification to the hide and attack system was the &quot;crisis flash&quot; system which alerts the players whether or not the enemy attack would cause a direct hit, a feature not present in its predecessor, Time Crisis.<br/><br/>When a player presses the pedal, he or she comes out of hiding, allowing them to shoot the enemies. Releasing the pedal places the player in hiding; during this time, players cannot shoot, but are safe from harm. A player must defeat all enemies before moving forward. The player's gun magazine contains 9 bullets (though occasionally a machine gun is available, which contains unlimited ammo for the remainder of the scene). Releasing the pedal also reloads the gun.<br/><br/>When the player fails to release the pedal after he/she spots a &quot;crisis flash&quot;, one life is lost. The crisis flash system fixed much of the unexpected life losses that rose from Time Crisis, though seldom unexpected life loss problems still remain[citation needed]. Each scene has a 40-second time limit, but unlike Time Crisis, in which seconds kept on running out even during wait animations, the timer only runs down when the battle is ensuing.

Guides can move clients farther, but your clients outnumber your guides. An event chit is drawn that must be either purchased out of a limited amount of Prestige Points or it goes on the Storm Track, hastening the arrival of the storm.

Scheduled for 2011, it will be released for the Wii console and will heavily use the Wii MotionPlus peripheral for sword-fighting, with a revised Wii Remote pointing system used for targeting.<br/><br/>Gameplay:<br/><br/>The gameplay of Skyward Sword will depart from the traditional flow of alternating overworld and dungeon exploration. The controls will also be revised, with swordplay based on Wii MotionPlus, allowing one-to-one motion control between the Wii Remote and the in-game sword. In contrast to earlier installments, battles will not be based solely on timing attacks, but also on their location, such as the direction in which enemies are hit. In addition to the sword, there will be items like a mechanical flying beetle to grab items from a distance and drop them, a whip as seen in Spirit Tracks, and series staples such as bombs, a slingshot, and a bow, which can also be controlled with the Wii MotionPlus. A stamina meter will allow for sprinting and running up walls. Drinking potions does not interrupt the gameplay anymore and the maps will be easier to read, making it harder to get lost in the game. The HUD within the demo shown at E3 is subject to change, and the player will be able to turn it off.<br/><br/>Plot:<br/><br/>Skyward Sword is a prequel to Ocarina of Time. The Link appearing in the game was born and raised in Skyloft, a group of islands floating above the clouds. Leading an ordinary life there, he one day discovers the Skyward Sword, which leads him to another, previously unknown land beneath, ruled by evil forces. Using the sword to travel back and forth between the two worlds, the mystery of why they became separated is gradually revealed to Link. The Skyward Sword will turn into the Master Sword at some point in the game, and while giving Link advice, it will assume the form of the female figure in the concept art shown at E3 2009.<br/><br/>Development:<br/><br/>....<br/><br/>At Nintendo's coinciding press conference in June 2010, it was announced that the subtitle was Skyward Sword, and that the game would be delayed until 2011, though the team is still aiming for a release early that year. The presentation also revealed a hybrid of graphics from Twilight Princess and The Wind Waker, resulting in a style resembling a painting come to life, inspired by French artist Paul C&eacute;zanne, and Miyamoto's love for impressionist art. One of the reasons the fully realistic visuals were dropped is to allow for more exaggerated character designs, pointing the player to the enemies' attacks and weaknesses. In concordance with Super Mario Galaxy and its sequel, staff members have expressed their wish to include orchestral music in Skyward Sword, though the matter has not been thoroughly discussed and decided upon yet.<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;Skyward sword&quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "81829": {"boardgamedesigner": ["Alan Butler", "Andrew Finch"], "poll": [], "name": "Sea Wars Fleet Actions", "playingtime": "0", "minplayers": "0", "boardgamemechanic": ["Dice Rolling", "Simulation"], "yearpublished": "1998", "usersrated": "2", "maxplayers": "0", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic806725_t.jpg", "average": "5", "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["A & A Game Engineering"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic806725.jpg", "boardgameversion": ["Fourth Editition"], "maxplaytime": "0", "boardgamecategory": ["Nautical", "Wargame"], "age": "0", "minplaytime": "0", "description": "The rules are set at an operational rather than a tactical level.

When rolling the &lsquo;Eye&rsquo; symbol you do not move and should instead draw one of your Flash-backwards card (later in the game Flash-forwards and Flash-sideways cards are used). Your &lsquo;Flash&rsquo; cards usually instruct you to increase or decrease your Skill points or gain Fate points.<br/><br/>When you visit certain locations, and have encounters, the marker on the story track will be steadily advanced. When the story track reaches certain points, changes will be made to the game; for example the Encounter Deck being used may change to another one, or certain Friends counters may become de-activated.<br/>The story track will also instruct you and the other players to move to one of the separate game boards or a different game track on the main board.<br/><br/>As you progress through the various stages of the game, the Encounter decks will continually change so that you meet people and find items from the different seasons of the LOST saga. Also your chosen character&rsquo;s skill points will gradually improve making future challenges easier, and you will gain all important Fate points.<br/><br/>You will receive Mystery Counters as rewards. Each of the various mysteries depicted (for example Jacob, the Numbers) is made up of a set of 5 cards. If you can collect a complete set, they can be traded in for additional Fate points.<br/><br/>Eventually the action will move to the centre track on the game board where one of the players will be chosen to succeed Jacob. The end game will then commence. Along with the other players you must defeat the Man in Black and play the Desmond card at the Light Source space in order to save the island and win the game.

Loki is the studio's most ambitious project to date, but it is not its first venture into the world of heroic fantasy. Many will remember Chaos League and its liberal dosage of humour and haemoglobin.<br/><br/>An incredible journey through four great mythologies, Loki allows the player to take-on the role of one of four heroes : a mighty Norse warrior, a fierce Greek fighter, a powerful Egyptian sorcerer or a skilled Aztec shaman. Each comes from a different mythological background and each has different strengths and skills and, therefore, radically different ways of fighting.<br/><br/>During an epic adventure, the player will give battle to a multitude of enemies. Hundreds of creatures and opponents of every kind have been created for the game, so that the player is going to have to fight his/her way past skeletons, giant spiders, centaurs, mummies, harpies, wild animals, a vast array of soldiers, ...... culminating in the showdowns with formidable bosses such as Medusa, Fenrir the wolf or Fafnir the dragon. Each boss has a particular way of fighting so the player must discover his weak points.<br/>As the hero(ine) advances through the game he/she will be able to collect or exchange thousands of items, including 500 unique objects, such as Thor's hammer or Achilles' armour.<br/><br/>The on-screen character evolves by completing quests (over 50) or by destroying enemies along the way. Weapons and armour that he/she acquires can be customised at a blacksmith's workshop, improving technical or magical properties and, in doing so, creating original items of great value. In each of the four worlds the player will become part of a great historical or mythological event : the fall of Troy, the Spanish invasion of Central America, Ragnarok, ....) and he/she will encounter great historical or mythological characters : Achilles, Thor, Akhenaton, Cortes, ...<br/><br/>Whatever hero(ine) the player adopts, he/she will come to the aid of the gods. It will soon become obvious that the world is threatened by Seth, the Egyptian god of chaos and evil who has returned to life. In order to put an end to Seth's wicked plans the player will undertake a terrifying voyage through an ever-changing myriad of environments (guaranteed by a random generation of levels), ensuring infinite replayability.&quot;<br/><br/>"}, "81865": {"poll": [], "name": "Master of Magic (1985)", "videogamemode": ["Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["C64 Edition", "ZX Spectrum Edition"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic805175.jpg", "videogametheme": ["Fantasy"], "usersrated": "2", "videogamedeveloper": ["Mastertronic"], "videogamegenre": ["Action RPG"], "videogameplatform": ["Commodore 64", "ZX Spectrum"], "average": "6", "statistics": [], "videogamepublisher": ["Mastertronic"], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic805175_t.jpg", "description": "Master of Magic is a computer role-playing game for the Commodore 64 and ZX Spectrum home computers.
