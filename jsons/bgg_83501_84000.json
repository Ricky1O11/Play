If they become overwhelmed, it is &ldquo;in character&rdquo; to stop and discuss the situation with each other. The Game Master on the other hand has no confidants. He is expected to react instantly to what the players describe their characters doing.<br/><br/>The typical GM spends hours preparing before a game; planning for everything the characters might try. But no matter how much you prepare, the only sure bet is that the players will think of something you didn&rsquo;t. In fact the more material you prepare, the more likely it is that one of the players will latch on to an incidental detail and take off in an unexpected direction faster than you can say &ldquo;Red Herring.&rdquo;<br/><br/>Every Game Master has his own style. But all of them need to be able to think on their feet. Improvising during a game is easier if you are ready to step away from the written game and go in the direction the players want to try. Remember the player characters are the main characters in the story you are telling. By definition the plot is what they do, not what you planned for them. You want to gently guide the group &lsquo;back on track&rsquo; without letting them realize that they ever deviated from the script.<br/><br/>There are three techniques which can improve your improvisation behind the GM screen: Plot Seeds, Stock Characters, and Rakugo Props.

Released on September 3, 2008, it can be played for free online or downloaded for offline play. Players control a lonely boy and an octopus-like monster that the boy encounters, solving puzzles on different planets to restore them from monochrome to color. The pair travel through space by swinging on clouds and asteroids with the monster's elongated tongue, searching other planets for life to which the boy can relate.<br/><br/>McMillen and Glaiel created the game and developed it in 14 days. Both developers expressed interest in seeing a version being released on the Wii game console through the WiiWare online service. Aether received a positive response from video game blogs for its unusual visual style and atmosphere. The single looped piece of background music received a mixed response and the controls were highlighted as an area of the game that could have been improved before release.<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;Aether (video game)&quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "83988": {"poll": [], "name": "The Ship", "videogamemode": ["Network Multiplayer", "Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["Windows Downloadable version"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1054203.jpg", "videogametheme": ["Crime", "Ocean / Sea"], "usersrated": "23", "videogamedeveloper": ["Outerlight Ltd."], "videogamegenre": ["Action RPG", "First Person Shooter", "Strategy"], "videogameplatform": ["Windows"], "average": "6.25652", "statistics": [], "videogamepublisher": ["Outerlight Ltd."], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1054203_t.jpg", "description": "From the Distributor's website<br/><br/>The Ship is primarily a multiplayer, online murder game with a unique set of game rules.<br/><br/>The Ship is owned by the mysterious Mr X and as one of many 'lucky' recipients of a free ticket you arrive on board The Ship to find there's a catch to your luxury cruise.<br/><br/>You are coerced into a brutal Hunt to indulge Mr. X's fantasies, under threat of death for not only yourself, but also your family.

This book is the rules guide for the game. It contains all of the information that you should need to design a character and play. It also contains some basic background information on all of the races and history of the World of Dawn.<br/><br/>The rules contained in this book have been written with inexperienced players of live role-playing games in mind and we have tried to explain many of the concepts in as clear a way as possible. With this in mind, we ask that you use the book in the best way that you can to get a feel for how to play the game. Some players may only need to read a small amount of some of the sections included, whereas others may find it useful to read every page; that choice, of course, is yours.<br/><br/>As designer of the rules and game world, it is my hope that you, as a player, will be able to share in the imaginative ideas I have attempted to communicate here and take them a great deal further than I am capable of doing. All of the rules material contained in this guide is considered to be open source, and as such eminently usable by other people to make and design their own live role-playing games, indeed, I actively encourage this as others actively encouraged me. The game world information I consider to belong to the players of the game. With this in mind, we politely request that should you be looking to design your own world and see these ideas as a source of inspiration please do contact me and ask for permission. By making the effort, you will probably get what you are after.<br/><br/>A great deal of thanks must go to several people in the writing of this book. To all of the people involved in the writing of the Lorien Trust player's guide version 2, especially Andy King. To Matt Davey for his work on the Twilight Gothic Rules and to Matt Pennington for his generous attitude with his own rules for Maelstrom. The rules of Eos draw from my contributions and experience of these three sources. Other thanks must go to the contributions made by several users of the Pagga.com live role playing forum, Ed Fortune for his kind donation of the Eos Forum and all the assistance granted therein.<br/><br/>Finally some additional thanks should go to all of the players of Eos over the last three years. Your enthusiasm, criticism, feedback and praise has kept us working late into the nights to make our game better.<br/><br/>"}, "83564": {"rpgdesigner": ["(Uncredited)"], "rpgitemversion": ["PDF version"], "poll": [], "name": "The Great City Map Folio", "rpgartist": ["Mario Barbati", "Guido Barbati", "O'Bully"], "rpgproducer": ["Anna Fava"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic813123.jpg", "usersrated": "1", "rpgsetting": ["The Great City"], "average": "8", "statistics": [], "rpg": ["d20 System / OGL Product (D&D 3.5 Compatible)"], "rpgpublisher": ["\u00d8one Games"], "rpgcategory": ["Accessory (dice, maps, screens, cards)"], "rpggenre": ["Fantasy"], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic813123_t.jpg", "description": "From publisher blurb:<br/><br/>Welcome, you will see the Great City as you never seen before!<br/><br/>What you will find in this product:<br/><br/>The Great City Poster Map<br/>An amazing 25,5 x11 inches poster showing the whole Great City in three dimensions!

The technology herein uses the real world as a rough guideline regarding what technology can and cannot do, with some leeway granted by the idea that in a world of magic, the rules of nature can be bent and sometimes broken. Some of the devices may seem unrealistic, but abilities such as cloaking and temporal manipulation make technology roughly on par with magic. However, some things, such as the wish spell, are not replicated by technology, and are just too fantastic. This book was written to be a viable alternative to magic, but not to replace it.<br/>There are no assumptions made about the settings this technology is used in. The information is presented to make it feel technological (by using charges and physical devices) and still retain balance within the d20 system. While the relationship between technology and magic (and psionics) is discussed, neither magic nor psionics is required to use these devices. These rules could just as easily represent real-world technology at the end of the 19th century (with the exception of those items that bend the rules, such as cloaking and temporal manipulation devices), as it could describe technology that springs up in a typical fantasy setting.<br/><br/>"}, "83570": {"rpgartist": ["John Milner"], "rpgitemversion": ["PDF version"], "poll": [], "name": "Deck of  Many Woes and Wonders", "rpgdesigner": ["Keith Taylor"], "rpgproducer": ["Keith Taylor"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic813121.jpg", "usersrated": "0", "average": "0", "statistics": [], "rpg": ["d20 System / OGL Product (D&D 3.5 Compatible)", "Generic / Universal"], "rpgpublisher": ["93 Games Studio"], "rpgcategory": ["Accessory (dice, maps, screens, cards)"], "rpggenre": ["Fantasy"], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic813121_t.jpg", "description": "From publisher blurb:<br/><br/>No other item can bring both hope and fear at such levels as this deck.

The game - even though cynical and satirical - is based in part on the historical facts as outlines by Marcus Tullius Cicero in his famous speech in defense of Sextus Roscius. Even though you can trust Cicero - as lawyer that he was - to illuminate the 'facts' in a specific light, also according to other sources the proscriptions were every bit as bad and corrupt as shown in this game.<br/><br/>Players take the role of Chiefs of Roman gangs from the Aventine Hill during Sulla&rsquo;s reign of terror and proscription of 82BC. On one hand the players are building a reputation for being most daring, bringing proscribed but highly influential Senators or Equites to 'justice' (by chopping of their heads). By this they gain blood money as bounty while also plundering the homes of those unfortunates. Still, some of that money should better find its way back into Crysogonus&rsquo; coffers. The freedman Chrysogonus was Sulla's right-hand man in this and his 'secretarius' meticulously notes down your name and the bounty paid. Chrysogonus does not look favorable on those lacking generosity in their presents. On the other hand, the gangs also raise money by extorting the grain merchants or the red-light district. Player&rsquo;s might also prey on each other in an attempt to rob the other gangs of their ill-gotten wealth either on the way home or by besieging or storming and plundering their lair. But beware Sulla&rsquo;s veterans patrolling the streets and your competitors as bounty hunter, Sulla&rsquo;s freedmen the Sullani. Players use their boss and his three lieutenants, all of them being specialized for different roles, and beef up their gangs by rogues lending numbers, muscles, speed or stealth. Sometimes guile succeeds where brutal force fails. The hulking brute - worth 3 normal men in a fight - might be hard-pressed to blend into the crowd if a patrol of Veterans enters the city quarter. Players might try to bribe officials to influence the Civil War, steer the patrols or 'ameliorate'their records with the 'secretarius' while influencing the proscription lists. They use prophecies by the witch (the 'Stryga') to influence and scare their superstitious opponents. The overall goal is to become the richest and most infamous of all bosses. Still, finally peace will come. Depending on the outcome of the civil war which the players might vigorously try to influence, the Chief having killed the wrong people and the Chief not having parted generously enough with his money, &quot;unfortunately&quot; will be executed.<br/><br/>This will leave only those of the rich and infamous who survived, to finally win the game.<br/><br/>"}, "83588": {"rpgartist": ["(Uncredited)"], "rpgitemversion": ["PDF version"], "poll": [], "name": "Crusader Subclass", "rpgdesigner": ["Joshua Raynack"], "rpgproducer": ["Doug Meerschaert", "Ryan Rawls", "Joshua Raynack"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic813110.jpg", "usersrated": "0", "average": "0", "statistics": [], "rpg": ["d20 System / OGL Product (D&D 3.5 Compatible)"], "rpgpublisher": ["Alea Publishing Group"], "rpgcategory": ["Sourcebook (rules/options to enhance play)"], "rpggenre": ["Fantasy"], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic813110_t.jpg", "description": "From opening paragraphs:<br/><br/>Subclasses present a new way of augmenting your character into a specific role beyond that of a normal character class or by obtaining prestige class levels.<br/><br/>One who travels to distant lands to fight for their deity against infidels in contested territories is a crusader.

The game's protagonist is an Alistelan intelligence officer named Stocke, who at the outset is defeated and almost killed by one of Granorg's commanders.

All over the world, the railway networks were growing and steam engines accelerated the progress. 175 years ago, on December 7 1835 to be precise, the first German train powered by a steam engine started operating between Nuremberg and F&uuml;rth, transporting passengers and goods. In England&rsquo;s region of Wensleydale transport of goods via railway tracks was started 13 years later.<br/> First Train to Nuremberg is a revised edition of Last Train to Wensleydale. You take the role of a railway promoter, backed by the investments of hundreds of local landowners. Your aim is to build lines that can make a profit from the transport of passengers and goods. However, money is not the only resource you require. Many locals will oppose your schemes and only with influence in the government will you be able to build over their land. Your company is far too small to be able to have its own engine works, so contacts with the major operators will help you acquire second-hand trains and rolling stock. You will also need to be on good terms with the two local railway companies. Without their support you will not be able to link to their networks, nor will you be able to negotiate the sale of your lines when they become unprofitable (as they surely will).<br/><br/>With First Train to Nuremberg now two players can fully enjoy this extraordinary train game as well. Instead of cheese and stone, now beer and mail will be transported, besides passengers of course. There is a new challenge when transporting passengers: They can travel first class now and thus you will gain more victory points but on the other hand, you have to buy trains that are more  expensive. Additionally, you may benefit from the first connection between Nuremberg and F&uuml;rth and receive extra victory points, which may be crucial for winning the game. What&rsquo;s more, you may play the original game of Last Train to Wensleydale on the flip side of the game board, or almost so.

Finnish infantry assaults the board 10 and 42 villages attempting to capture buildings against infantry, guns and tanks.<br/><br/>FE 64 The Iron Ring is Closed, August 1941: This is a very meaty scenario. 44 German squads, OBA, halftracks and assault guns attack on boards 40, 49, 42, 24, 22 and 23. The Russians defend with 42 squads and several guns. The victory conditions are interesting with each side attempting to control the riverbank.<br/><br/>FE 65 Straight to the Front, September 1941: This scenario offers some good replay value. The Germans attack across boards 19 and 11 attempting to capture some buildings. The Germans get SS infantry and some AFV. The Russians start with some infantry and receive random tank support. A medium sized scenario should be popular.<br/><br/>FE 66 Tedium, October 1941: This is a classic slogging match across boards 19 and 44. Dug-In Russian troops try to stop a combined arms German force. The Germans have infantry, tanks and halftracks against the Russians with infantry, fortifications and Guns.<br/><br/>FE 67 A Cold Day in Hell, December 1941: The Finns and the Russians go at it in this small infantry only action. The action takes place in winter conditions on boards 8 and 42. This should make for good tourney action.<br/><br/>FE 68 Beast of Prey, March 1942: A real and true slugfest in the woods. Once again dug-in Russian defenders on boards 32 and 36 try to hold Germans from exiting the board. The Russians get infantry, fortifications and Guns while the Germans get SS infantry and some Stugs.<br/><br/>FE 69 Tiger Woods, August 1942: Yes! Another scenario with Tiger in its title!!! If that is not enough to get you excited then this scenario's OB should do it. The Germans get 4 Tigers up against a couple of Russian T-43's and a AA Truck. Each side gets a good number of infantry. This action takes place on boards 36 and 42.<br/><br/>FE 70 Worker's Settlement No. 8, September 1942: This cool infantry only scenario (well the Germans get one INF gun) takes place on board 33 and 4. This scenario has a cool twist for entry conditions with the Russians entering anywhere on 3 board edges. A cool twist in the VC makes for some uncertainty on where to attack. Sure to be a favorite for the tourney crowd.<br/><br/>FE 71 Cold Steel Rain, January 1943: This is another meaty scenario that should offer some good replay value given the variable VC. The Germans get infantry and some AT Guns and defend on boards 33 and 48 against attacking Russian infantry, OBA and some T-60 tanks. .<br/><br/>FE 72 Manos a la Manos, February 1943: The Spanish Blue Division makes its debut in this action on boards 13 and 18. The Spanish infantry with an AT Gun and some variable additional forces must defend some terrain against a lot of Russian infantry, tanks and Flamethrower tanks. The Russians got the numbers but do they have the time to capture the victory terrain?!<br/><br/>FE 73 Polar Star, February 1943: Another meaty old-fashioned scenario, this time on boards 17, 19 and 18. The Germans get 24 squads, fortifications, Stugs and some AT Guns and must hold off a swarm of 32 Russian squads, Assault guns and tanks from exiting and capturing some buildings. Lots of options in this one fore each side.<br/><br/>FE 74 Fruitless Fighting, March 1943: The classic capture the village type scenario on boards 12 and 17. This scenario features 20 Russian squads supported by tanks and assault guns attacking the village against an outpost of SS infantry and some fortifications. The Germans receive reinforcements in the form of infantry and 4 Tiger tanks.<br/><br/>FE 75 Porech'e Push, August 1943: My favorite of the scenarios in this pack. The Russians fight out of a bridgehead against a strong German force to capture the hills overlooking their bridgehead. Really get the flavor of the historic action in this one. The Russians get a bunch of infantry and an assortment of AFV against German infantry, guns and additional forces that they select from an available force pool. This scenario is set on boards 3, 8 and 49.<br/><br/>FE 76 The Battle of Krasnogvadeisk, January 1944: This is another one of those big scenarios that capture the flavor of east front action. Set on boards 18, 49 and 22 this is a meaty scenario with 26 Russian squads and 5 AFV attacking to capture some buildings against 21 squads, 4 tanks and some fortifications.<br/><br/>FE 77 Stalin's Revenge, June 1944: Another Finnish versus Russian scenario setup on boards 5 and 32. This is a smallish scenario featuring 9 Finnish squads and a couple of AT Guns against 15 Russian squads and 3 AFV. This is a brutal one for the Finnish as they attempt to stop the Russians from capturing some buildings.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "0", "boardgameversion": ["English Version"], "name": "Leningrad Pack", "playingtime": "0", "boardgamemechanic": ["Dice Rolling", "Hex-and-Counter", "Modular Board", "Secret Unit Deployment", "Simulation"], "average": "6.5", "boardgameexpansion": [], "usersrated": "2", "boardgamefamily": ["Advanced Squad Leader", "Cities: St Petersburg / Petrograd / Leningrad"]}, "83681": {"rpgartist": ["(Uncredited)"], "rpgitemversion": ["PDF Version"], "poll": [], "name": "Aspiria", "rpgdesigner": ["Paul \"Wiggy\" Wade-Williams"], "rpgproducer": ["Lee F.

The game was developed in collaboration by Capcom, Nippon Ichi, Namco Bandai, Gust, and Idea Factory. Released on September 25, 2008 in Japan, the game features turn-based battles, a plot that involves rescuing souls, and the ability to dress the female characters of the player's party in a wide variety of outfits.

As players set about freeing the trapped souls supporting the nightmare world that they are stuck in, they engage in turn-based team battles. This is where the characters from previous games come in. Players must enlist them to join in party-based battles. Success in these battles is based on the ability to string together specific moves into chain attack sequences, which in turn unlock even stronger combinations when successful. Players can also increase their characters' stats and abilities by acquiring additional costumes called 'forms' and redressing their characters in them. Female characters physical appearances can also be changed based on the form they're wearing.<br/><br/>The goal of the game is to release souls. You can find and collect souls by searching around area maps. Exposure to souls can grant players items or unlock events.

And those deep roots that so colourfully tell of fantastical creatures, miraculous events, and wondrous deeds also hint and grasp blindly at darker truths.

Where fantasy becomes reality<br/><br/>NERO, an acronym that stands for the New England Roleplaying Organization, is a new concept in game playing. Under NERO's unique rule system, an entire fantasy medieval town can be created.<br/><br/>In the NERO game, you create a character concept for a fantasy story and actually play the character. It is much like improvisational theater in that you have a framework created by the props and supporting characters and must develop your part as you progress through the storyline. Your character's attitudes, ambitions, and history are yours to define.<br/><br/>If the adventurous life is your calling, you may play the part of a wanderer, meeting with some friends in the tavern. While swapping tales, your party could get hired by a poor farmer in desperate straits, and spend the afternoon slaying a foul necromancer and his undead abominations.<br/><br/>If the epic life is not your style, then you can play the part of a town merchant. You can make your money selling your wares - and information - for the right price.<br/><br/>Or perhaps you wish to be one who investigates the magical arts, selling your scrolls and potions to earn the money you need to continue your studies.<br/><br/>Or would you rather try and become leader of the Mages' Guild? The choice is yours.<br/><br/>NERO is dedicated to the legendary days of high fantasy, while running a fun (and above all safe) game.<br/><br/>We have fierce warriors, crafty scouts, powerful mages, loyal knights, and benevolent healers. There are smelly goblins, blood-chilling spectres, evil necromancers, villainous spies to fight, and your very own legends to create.<br/><br/>How NERO works<br/><br/>In NERO, a cast of NPCs (nonplayer characters) are used to set the tone and provide background for the player characters (PCs). They often serve important town functions (such as Guild leaders) and otherwise help to propel the plot and action. Much of what happens on an event, however, can be completely decided by the players.<br/><br/>NERO uses padded weapons to simulate actual combat, and a magic system that uses &quot;packets&quot; made of fabric and bird seed to represent the hurling of spells. Mock (and sometimes real) armor and other costumes are used to enhance the atmosphere.<br/><br/>There are two basic types of adventures: An Adventure Weekend and an Adventure Module. When on a module, you and a group of trusted traveling companions will go off on a quest in search of adventure and reward. An adventure module usually runs for about two hours and has a definite start and conclusion. It sounds simple, but when you are in the middle of a dungeon, with shadowy shapes moving towards you in the darkness and strange sounds echoing down the halls, and you are trying to remember what that fellow in the tavern said a half hour ago about how to get through this infernal door, your perspective on the difficulty of the situation may change.<br/><br/>Adventure Weekends are much more extensive, and run from Friday night through Sunday afternoon (and sometimes Monday afternoon), and bring to life a medieval town with all its inhabitants and intrigues. This is what NERO is all about! There is nothing to compare with the feeling of playing for 24 hours a day along with possibly hundreds of other players, each with their own desires, fears, and aspirations.<br/><br/>As your character continues to be successful, you gain abilities and influence, and may one day gain a noble title or great fame and wealth. Tales of your adventures may some day be sung by bards, or retold time and again by storytellers sitting by the fire with a cup of spiced cider.<br/><br/>What your character does is entirely up to you. You decide what you want and where you want to be. The future is yours to define and create.<br/><br/>"}, "83728": {"rpgartist": ["Gary Dupuis"], "rpgitemversion": ["PDF version"], "poll": [], "name": "Fury & Frenzy", "rpgdesigner": ["Jeremy Forbing", "Michael Todd"], "rpgproducer": ["Jeremy Forbing"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic813981.jpg", "usersrated": "0", "average": "0", "statistics": [], "rpg": ["d20 System / OGL Product (D&D 3.5 Compatible)"], "rpgpublisher": ["Big Finger Games"], "rpgcategory": ["Sourcebook (rules/options to enhance play)"], "rpggenre": ["Fantasy"], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic813981_t.jpg", "description": "From publisher blurb:<br/><br/>FIND YOUR FURY!<br/>Explore the barbaric side of d20 fantasy gaming with nine new Base Classes designed to expand the barbaric milieu beyond the conventional limits.<br/><br/>UNLEASH YOUR RAGE!<br/>Discover wild new expressions for your rage with thirty three Rage and Rage Channeling Feats.<br/><br/>HARNESS THE BEAST WITHIN!<br/>Follow the call of the totemic spirit within you.

The player must collect a crystal orb and drop it off in the reactor before time runs out or the player explodes and must start over. The game places heavy emphasis on the ability to kick the walls of the cube at certain points which causes the entire chamber to rotate, which is vital to that player reaching the end of each puzzle. Getting to the end of each puzzle gets progressively more difficult and more and more obstacles stand in your way. These range from platforms, to spike pits, to giant fans. In addition, some &quot;kickers&quot; (switches in the form of green arrows) are placed on some walls to mislead the player. There are even some flashing platforms that will rotate the chamber 180 degrees when the player jumps on them. Once the crystal is dropped off in the designated zone (the reactor), the player then moves on to the next level. After each level, the player is awarded 100 points for each second remaining on their timer. 10,000 points win the player an extra life. If the player makes it through all 40 chambers without using any cheat codes (i.e. infinite lives or infinite time) then s/he is treated to an animation at the end. If even one cheat code is used, the player is prompted the message: &quot;You made it! You're alive! You cheated. You're outta here.&quot; Single player mode is always 'red player'. On a second note, the four characters are never named, nor even given a gender as the body looks more or less androgynous though it's presumed they are all male.<br/><br/>Eliminator Mode<br/><br/>This mode will have the player face off against up to three other computer or human controlled players in 1 of 20 different chambers. The goal is to stay alive the longest, and the winner is the last one alive at the end. Staying alive proves to be difficult, as each player has C4 strapped with a timer continuously counting down. However, when a player possesses the crystal, that player's &quot;kill clock&quot; freezes until s/he puts it in a reactor or loses it via being pushed or falling. Each player has a small pyramid holochamber assigned to them (one on each &quot;side&quot; of the chamber belonging to each of the players and color coded to match (red, yellow, green, blue) in which they can bring a crystal that is dropped at the beginning of the level to extend the amount of time on their timer. The other players will try to grab the crystal from you though, by pushing you and by causing you to fall by rotating the chamber. Alternatively, a crystal can be dropped in a different players chamber to cut off time from their timer. How much time is gained or lost when a crystal is placed in a reactor depends on the difficulty. Also, on Hard or Expert difficulty, if a player blows up and another player is standing too close, both players are blown up simultaneously. Once an orb is dropped off into a chamber, or falls on spikes, or falls in a pit, or blows up via the &quot;Crystal Bomb&quot; powerup, another one will appear.<br/><br/>Free-For-All Mode<br/><br/>This mode is very similar to Eliminator Mode, except that there is a fixed amount of time that the game will go on for, in which the player who dies the least amount of times is the winner. It is highly unlikely that players will tie in this game, unless the difficulty is set to Hard or Expert, in which case the BUYB (Blow Up Yer Buddy) tactic can easily cause a draw game. Adding and losing time on your timer is the same as in Eliminator Mode, where the crystal is dropped off in different players squares.<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;Blast Chamber&quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "83767": {"poll": [], "name": "Test Drive 4", "videogamemode": ["Local Multiplayer", "Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["NA PlayStation edition"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic916580.jpg", "videogameseries": ["Test Drive"], "videogametheme": ["Driving"], "usersrated": "1", "videogamedeveloper": ["Pitbull Syndicate"], "videogamegenre": ["Racing"], "videogameplatform": ["PlayStation"], "average": "6", "statistics": [], "videogamepublisher": ["Accolade, Inc."], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic916580_t.jpg", "description": "Test Drive 4 is a cross-platform racing game.

However, as with all the templates in the synergy line, the devout template grants more potent powers to creatures with at least 5 levels in a specific PC class, cleric in this case, making them true paragons of holy (or unholy) devotion.<br/><br/>So use a little divine intervention and give your clerics, dark lords, and holy warriors a new twist with Blackdirge Publishing and the devout template.<br/><br/>Blackdyrge's Templates - Devout contains 7 pages of new d20 material and includes the following:<br/><br/>     An introduction by Blackdyrge<br/>     The devout template<br/>     Iconic monster #1 - The Fangs of Hazag, a group of terrible devout gnolls<br/>     Iconic monster #2 - Igannon Sunderscorch, a powerful devout azer priest-king<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>"}, "83786": {"rpgartist": ["Jesse Mohn"], "rpgitemversion": ["PDF version"], "poll": [], "name": "Elemental Exemplar", "rpgdesigner": ["Aeryn Rudel"], "rpgproducer": ["John A.

It was invented in 2010, while the designer were reflecting about the pie rule.<br/><br/>The game begins with an empty 7x7x7 hex-hex board. The game is scalable, so a beginner can start with 5x5x5 and. Expert players should play on 8x8x8 board or bigger.<br/><br/>One of the players uses black stones and the other player uses white stones. Players move alternately, starting with black player.<br/><br/>In the first turn, the black player places just 3 stones.  For each turn afterwards, players replace 1 of their opponent's stones placed in the last turn (not the replaced one) by their own, and continues placing 3 more of his stones.  In the last turn, black replaces just one of the last white stones and the game is over.<br/><br/>The pie rule can be used.<br/><br/>When at the end of the white turn the board has just 1 empty cell, the last turn starts. The game ends with an unoccupied cell. When the game is finished, the player with the largest group of stones wins. If both players have the same score, the winner is the player with less number of groups. Of course a player may resign at time if the situation looks hopeless, this causes his immediate defeat.<br/><br/>For making the gameplay easier, without memorizing the last three opposite placements each turn, it's possible to mark those stones in some way.

The action takes place into two different worlds: the celestial world, represented by a Taiji (Yin Yang); and the terrestrial world, represented by a map of Japan. The players represent kami and their mission is to give life to the earth. To achieve this, they will play counters, which represent vital energy (ki), in the two different worlds.<br/><br/>Each player can play one counter par turn, but they have cards which represent shintai, that is to say temporary incarnations. With them, they can gather and spread more energy into the world. Furthermore, at the end of the game, the most powerful kami wins, that is to say, the player who gained the biggest number of shintai - or cards.<br/><br/>By playing counters on the map of Japan, the players will spread the vital energy to the terrestrial world. Each city that is attained brings extra cards to the players and unlock new cards. The game actually finishes when the all the map of Japan is covered with counters. However, the players fail their mission if they finish the stack of cards before that point.<br/><br/>By playing counters on the Yin Yang, the players enter the celestial world and challenge the dark powers, which may be helpful to restore the balance of power if counters are scarce. The Yin Yang is a secondary board inside the game box, which contains an ultraviolet lamp : when turned on, this lamp reveals the symbol of a moon on the counters, which was invisible before. The ki thus changes into kigetsu, &quot;moon energy&quot;, which allows to start a cosmic-scale battle.&quot;<br/><br/>You can see how moon counters are revealed on this page: <a target='_blank' href='http://www.kigetsu.com/eng/concept2.htm' rel='nofollow'>http://www.kigetsu.com/eng/concept2.htm</a><br/><br/>"}, "83838": {"rpgdesigner": ["John Alger"], "rpgitemversion": ["PDF version"], "poll": [], "name": "Bane Ledger: Volume I", "rpgartist": ["William McAusland", "Jason Walton"], "rpgproducer": ["Chris Cant"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic815003.jpg", "usersrated": "0", "average": "0", "statistics": [], "rpg": ["d20 System / OGL Product (D&D 3.0 Compatible)"], "rpgpublisher": ["Bloodstone Press"], "rpgcategory": ["Sourcebook (rules/options to enhance play)"], "rpggenre": ["Fantasy"], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic815003_t.jpg", "description": "From publisher blurb:<br/><br/>The Bane Ledger presents 30 monsters gathered from the legends of our own world.

As the Jeep, the player needs to destroy everything directly in front of it or be prepared to jump in order to avoid collisions. In two-player mode, the Helicopter and Jeep must cooperate, and the players depend on each other to succeed. For example, the Helicopter can only fire forward, so occasionally, the Jeep must cover the rear with his swiveling gun. However, when covering the rear, the Jeep is vulnerable from the front, so the Helicopter must cover him.<br/><br/>The players collect shields, power cells which increase fire power and an additional bonus can be added to the score achieved.

S. Ski Team Skiing) is a sports video game produced by Mattel and released for its Intellivision video game system in 1980. Up to six players compete individually on either a downhill or slalom course to see who can complete the course the fastest. For the game's initial release, Mattel obtained a license from the U. S. Ski Team and used its name and logo in the game's box art.<br/><br/>The object of Skiing is to complete the chosen course, either downhill or slalom, in the fastest time possible. Play begins by selecting the number of players for the game. Each player will have three heats in which to post their fastest time for the course. With multiple players, players take turns in the same order for each heat. Next, the players choose from one of 15 levels of steepness for the course, with higher numbers representing steeper (and thus, faster) courses. Lastly, the players select either the downhill or the slalom course for their race.<br/><br/>Players control their skiers by using the controller to turn them until they reach the desired direction. The skiers will accelerate down the hill automatically, based on the steepness of the course. Players may take turns gradually, or by pushing an action button they may take a turn more sharply. Pushing another action button will cause the skier to jump over obstacles on the course, such as moguls.<br/><br/>On both courses, players must successfully pass through a number of gates on their way down the course, with gates on the downhill course spaced farther apart than those on the slalom course. Missing a gate adds a five-second penalty to a player's race time. As each player begins their race, the current fastest time is displayed at the starting line, with their final time displayed after the player crosses the finish line.<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;Skiing (Intellivision game)&quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "83882": {"poll": [], "name": "Orbiter: Space Flight Simulator", "videogamemode": ["Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["Windows Downloadable edition", "Windows Downloadable edition"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1254853.jpg", "videogametheme": ["Flight", "Science Fiction", "Space"], "usersrated": "3", "videogamecharacter": ["Space Shuttle"], "videogamedeveloper": ["(Self-Developed Video Game)"], "videogamegenre": ["Educational", "Flight Simulator", "Simulation"], "videogameplatform": ["Windows"], "average": "7.16667", "statistics": [], "videogamepublisher": ["(Self-Published)"], "vgcharacterversion": ["Space Shuttle"], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1254853_t.jpg", "description": "User Summary<br/><br/>Orbiter is a FREE and realistic space flight simulation program for the Windows PC.<br/><br/>Designed by Dr. Martin Schweiger, Orbiter is a real-time 3D spaceflight simulator.

If the story requires the power-armored hero to have stealth armor, he'll most likely have it on hand. Should it be critical that the hero with the magic amulet needs to generate a mystic shield, you can almost bank on her getting it. Does the hero with normal human strength desperately need to lift a gargantuan chunk of concrete off of his ally? Chances are, he'll be able to muster up the power to do so.

It's heavy on collaborative storytelling and very light on rules. Like the film style it takes its name from.<br/><br/>Cinema V&eacute;rit&eacute; the Game is missing a lot of the trappings of its older, more complex siblings. There is no thick omnibus of powers or setting information. There are no charts, weight tables, or extensive lists of weapons and gear. Enough about what the game doesn&rsquo;t have, what it does have is a task resolution that requires only a pair of 6-sided dice that can be found damn near anywhere. It has extreme versatility; capable of adjusting to any setting or trope you care to stick to it.<br/><br/>This game is also very mobile. The film style the game takes its name from is able to move to locales normal film productions just can't. Hollywood requires hundreds of people and tons of equipment and props to get a set ready for filming. CinemaV&eacute;rit&eacute; is able to tell its story with a single shoulder camera and small sound rig. This game shares that same portability. All you have to do is grab a pair of six-siders, some scratch paper and a pencil or two and you can set up a game anywhere. You might want to bring along a couple of friends as well, or else you'll find yourself in a corner booth at your local diner talking to yourself.

The paladin is the most difficult class to play, not because of a lack of combat power, but because of its roleplaying restrictions. Many players would like to play one, but are afraid to try.<br/><br/>However, a well played paladin is worth the extra effort. Why is this? The other classes are fun to play because of what they can do. The paladin is fun to play because of how they do it.<br/><br/>The call of duty sets paladins apart.<br/><br/>But it&rsquo;s also something else. In the real world, we could use a few wizards to make our lives easier or clerics to heal our sick. However, we need heroes more than anything, and paladins are the epitome of heroic fantasy.<br/><br/>In those dreary times of real life that happen in between games, try to live your life a little more like a paladin.<br/><br/>Focus on how you accomplish your goals a bit more, rather than the bottom line.<br/><br/>Don&rsquo;t let fear run your life.<br/><br/>And never make a deal with a dragon; smite the beast.<br/><br/>Version 2.0: This version is compatible with the revised 3.5 rules.<br/><br/>"}, "83930": {"rpgdesigner": ["(Uncredited)"], "rpgitemversion": ["PDF version"], "poll": [], "name": "The Book of Qualities, or Half -Feats", "rpgartist": ["(Uncredited)"], "rpgproducer": ["(Uncredited)"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic815667.jpg", "usersrated": "0", "average": "0", "statistics": [], "rpg": ["d20 System / OGL Product (D&D 3.0 Compatible)"], "rpgpublisher": ["Chaos Drake Press"], "rpgcategory": ["Sourcebook (rules/options to enhance play)"], "rpggenre": ["Fantasy"], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic815667_t.jpg", "description": "From Introduction:<br/><br/>Besides the fighter and the mage, feats are gained rather slowly for other character classes. Some GMs have resorted to handing out feats more often in order to get more use out of them. However, this creates imbalances and robs the fighter of their uniqueness.<br/><br/>This supplement suggests a means for characters and GMs to reach a compromise. Most feats give a sizable boost in power. Qualities, or half-feats, divide that power and distribute it more evenly. Thus, instead of receiving a sudden boost, qualities give an incremental advantage. Why bother? It might not matter so much at high levels, but at lower levels that extra little oomph does make a difference. They also show the gradual development of a character, rather than a sudden jump.<br/><br/>"}, "83931": {"rpgdesigner": ["Alfred E.
