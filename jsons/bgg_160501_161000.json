You and your allies go on whirlwind adventures, traveling to forgotten cities, busy capitals and devious dungeons for the sake of saving the world.<br/>     The Mentor: You are the wise and enigmatic senior of great understanding who oversees the training and guidance of new adventures out on their quests across the realm. You offer them insight and guidance in fluid and often poetic life lessons. However, when things get rough, you are no slouch in a fight.

Use your visions of things that may come to warn your fellow adventures before it it&rsquo;s too late or see great tragedies about to befall the world.

However, the acrimonious truth is that you are unseen by the threads of destiny and are cursed to be forever forgotten. The gods have no plan for you. There is no greater force in the universe that has included you in their design.

PLAAY Games has taken the basic game engine from its hockey and lacrosse games, and modified it to capture the more refined nuances of classic football. The result: a sports board game that gives fans everything they love about watching soccer, captured in a 30-45 minute game window.<br/><br/>Despite the quick playing time, SOCCER BLAST provides surprising detail and the genuine sense of witnessing a full, realistic football match from start to finish. Individual players' true-to-life abilities are captured simply but realistically, using a series of easy-to-understand symbols and descriptive qualities. These individual performances synch together to create realistic team results that will make you feel like you're in the stands watching the game for real!<br/><br/>SOCCER BLAST was created in such a way as to place an emphasis on story and context. Yes, the statistics are important, and we think you'll be pleased with the numerical results. However, this game is more than just numbers. The usual assortment of drama-inducing elements and game mechanics that PLAAY Games have become known for have been built into this game as well. For example, referees can affect play--and BE affected by play. If somebody says the wrong thing to a ref, his team might have to pay for it. In SOCCER BLAST, you'll occasionally see a subjective referee call that should have gone the other way, and you'll experience that palpable sense of joy, or disgust, depending on your leaning!<br/><br/>The game offers many other features. The advantage of playing on one's home pitch is very real, but not over-stated. Injuries will play a factor, and you may be chagrined to see your star player carted off the field with the match hanging in the balance. Fatigue is a factor, too--you'll face the same challenge with late-game substitutions that a real soccer coach faces, and you'll need to plan accordingly. And, the game comes with a full complement of unusual and rare results waiting to add memorable twists to your tabletop sports archives.<br/><br/>Finally, SOCCER BLAST Pro Soccer Game allows you to rate your own teams with its &quot;How-To&quot; guide, made available at a nominal extra charge. The world is filled with soccer teams and every country has its own league or leagues. Ordinarily, this poses a problem for game companies because while many of these leagues have devoted fan followings, they're not large enough to warrant the time and energy of creating cards for them. If you have your OWN favorite team or league, you won't have to depend on PLAAY Games to make cards for you&mdash;you'll be able to make them yourself!<br/><br/>"}, "160525": {"poll": [], "name": "New Star Soccer 4", "videogamemode": ["Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["Mac edition", "Windows edition"], "average": "0", "videogameseries": ["New Star Soccer"], "videogametheme": ["Sports - Soccer"], "usersrated": "0", "videogamedeveloper": ["New Star Games Ltd"], "videogamegenre": ["RPG", "Sports"], "videogameplatform": ["Macintosh", "Windows"], "statistics": [], "videogamepublisher": ["(Web published)"], "description": "New Star Soccer 4 is a football career game where you can be the best player in the world.

Primarily designed as a solitaire game for sports board game hobbyists, it can also be played head-to-head, with each player making decisions for his team.<br/><br/>From the publisher:<br/><br/>We've taken our original lacrosse game, Crash and Scramble, and made it even better by adapting it to the same game engine that powers our popular hockey game, Hockey Blast. The result is a fast-playing, fun board game simulation of this cutting-edge pro sport that captures everything fans love about it: bone-jarring hits, acrobatic passes, rocket-fast shots, and amazing saves. YOU can re-create all the thrilling action of this &quot;ahead-of the curve&quot; sport, right in your own home, with Lacrosse Blast Pro Indoor Lacrosse Game!<br/><br/>Lacrosse Blast uses a possession-by-possession system of play that keeps things moving fast. The game uses the same easily-memorized chart structure and no-nonsense method of rating players as our hockey game. Players perform based on the presence--or absence--of various qualities like speed, power and skill. Each player is also rated for his ability in creating and/or taking away scoring opportunities, as well as for shots and assists, penalties, face-offs and injury. That means you'll get table-top performances which echo each player's real-life abilities without a bunch of calculations or math gymnastics. You'll see the great assist guys dishing it off for goals and the powerhouse shooters firing the ball into the net, while the less-talented players defer to someone else. You'll be caught up in the action as you &quot;watch&quot; players use their power, skill and savvy to make plays. Goalies have their own special ratings, designed to make the real-life star net-minders shine on your table top the just way they do on the pro league floor! Easy-to-play, but amazingly detailed--THAT'S Lacrosse Blast Pro Indoor Lacrosse simulation board game!<br/><br/>"}, "160585": {"poll": [], "name": "Alliances: Means of Power Expansion", "playingtime": "45", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": ["Area Control / Area Influence", "Auction/Bidding", "Hand Management", "Partnerships", "Trick-taking"], "yearpublished": "2013", "boardgameexpansion": [], "usersrated": "4", "boardgamefamily": ["Crowdfunding: Kickstarter"], "maxplayers": "4", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2041938_t.jpg", "average": "3.5", "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["Golden Egg Games"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2041938.jpg", "boardgameversion": ["Kickstarter Exclusive Edition"], "maxplaytime": "45", "boardgamecategory": ["Card Game"], "age": "8", "minplaytime": "45", "description": "Kickstarter Exclusive Means of Power Expansion<br/><br/>Four new special action cards that will help vary each game and give it greater replayability.<br/><br/>"}, "160586": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2042487.jpg", "poll": [], "boardgamedesigner": ["Liz Spain"], "statistics": [], "yearpublished": "2015", "maxplayers": "5", "boardgameartist": ["Alex Campbell", "Carlos Cara", "Nathan Hawthorne"], "boardgamepublisher": ["Voodoo Bunny Co.

Here you will find chromatic dragons of terrifying size and surpassing lethality, from the juvenile blue and adult green to the ancient black, great wyrm white, and great wyrm red! The dragons' lesser kin, the drakes, are also featured, including the flame drake, forest drake, frost drake, and sea drake! Being just a little less deadly than a true dragon is hardly an indictment on their fearsome ferocity, of course, and each brings a set of unique and special talents to the battlefield, including the brand-new mythic monster, the carrion-craving fell drake, ally and steed to undead warlords that rule benighted badlands and ruined kingdoms of death. The product is rounded out by some special members of the extended dragon family, including ranging from the colossal pyroclastic terror that is the tor linnorm to the tiny but studious pseudodragon, friend to mages and loremasters everywhere, and the half-breed dracolisk, spawned from the unholy union of a depraved dragon and a bestial basilisk. As if these mythic dragons were not enough, Mythic Monsters: Dragons also equips your mythic dragons with an array of mythic feats with which to supercharge their already formidable abilities to bite, breathe, crush, and devour all who dare to stand against them. The 13 dragons contained herein, ranging in CR from 2 to 27, are updated for the mythic rules, and when we say updated we mean complete stat blocks, yes, but more than that every one of these terrible lizards has its own unique and exciting new mythic abilities, from a mythic green dragon's bilious spew and chlorinous miasma to the onrushing avalanche and glacial palisade of a mythic white dragon!<br/><br/>"}, "160676": {"poll": [], "name": "New Star Hockey", "videogamemode": ["Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["Windows edition"], "average": "0", "videogametheme": ["Sports - Hockey"], "usersrated": "0", "videogamedeveloper": ["(Self-Developed Video Game)"], "videogamegenre": ["Sports"], "videogameplatform": ["Windows"], "statistics": [], "videogamepublisher": ["(Web published)"], "description": "New Star Hockey is the computer game where you are the next up and coming hockey star!<br/><br/>Train, play in one of six leagues, and work your way towards the Hockey Hall of Fame.

The crew on the front lines are in constant need of new supplies and equipment, so the Federation has set up a massive supply line network. This network is composed of massive space stations called Foundries. Some Foundries are specialized in mining and processing ore from asteroids. Other Foundries are equipped with robotic manufacturing and repair facilities. Their job is to keep the flow of supplies going efficiently as possible.<br/><br/>The gameplay in Far Space Foundry occurs in two distinct halves: Space Foundry Alpha and Space Foundry Beta.<br/><br/>At Space Foundry Alpha, you mine skyrite (blue crystals) and rubion (red ore) and process the two to make galactium (purple metal). On your turn, you play a card that allows you to either land a shuttle on a docking bay or take off from one. The shuttle will transport raw materials either from the asteroid or to your freighters. Each docking bay has a special ability if activated that turn, like ore processing or galactic traders. At this foundry, you must also build a fleet of freighters to haul your items. To do this, you must visit the cantina to recruit help from various alien captains (with unique abilities). Once everyone has played all of their cards, it's time to head off to a new board...<br/><br/>At Space Foundry Beta, you take all of your acquired materials and transport them down to the station. There the robots will use that material to make various products of varying worth. Besides manufacturing, you may also upgrade your freighters or charge up your existing products for more points. Once the freighters are filled back up again, it's time to transport the items to their final destination for final scoring!<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "1", "boardgameversion": ["English first edition", "English laser cut edition", "Print & Play edition"], "average": "7.00038", "name": "Far Space Foundry", "playingtime": "80", "boardgamemechanic": ["Set Collection", "Worker Placement"], "age": "10", "boardgameexpansion": ["177801", "188989", "188988"], "usersrated": "276", "boardgamesubdomain": ["Strategy Games"], "boardgamefamily": ["Crowdfunding: Kickstarter"], "boardgamepodcastepisode": ["1P 110 - Far Space Foundry", "Episode 121: Mythos Tales, Far Space Foundry and Horror Films turned Board Game", "Episode 6: Xia: Legends of A Drift System, Far Space Foundry and Our Top 5 Games", "Episode Charlie - 2016 Retrospective", "Favorite Games of 2015", "High Heavens", "The Game Pit: Episode 78 - Battle Report from LobsterCon XII", "The Good, the Board, and the North Sea: Episode 61", "Vox Republica 084: Terra Nova Games", "What Did You Play This Week Podcast Thing Week 99"]}, "160745": {"poll": [], "name": "Hellfire (1984)", "videogamemode": ["Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["European ZX Spectrum Cassette edition"], "average": "0", "videogametheme": ["Mythology"], "usersrated": "0", "videogamedeveloper": ["(Unknown)"], "videogamegenre": ["Action Adventure", "Platform"], "videogameplatform": ["ZX Spectrum"], "statistics": [], "videogamepublisher": ["Melbourne House"], "description": "User Summary<br/>Hellfire is a platform game from Melbourne House in 1984. <br/>In the game you play as Odysseus trying to get back to your home island.

The Dread Pirate Roberts wears a mask and at best will kill poor Westley in the morning. And who else is going to cut a man&rsquo;s heart out with a spoon than the Sheriff of Nottingham? Robin Hood is just a homeless guy who likes camping without him.<br/><br/>As GMs and storytellers, we know our villains have to be there. Whether it&rsquo;s your PCs who are the villains or heroes fighting against villainy in your worlds, that interplay between good and evil &ndash; that *conflict* between opposing viewpoints &ndash; is very important to crafting compelling stories at and beyond the game table. But what makes them compelling?<br/><br/>Insta-NPCs #3: Scum and Villainy, Inc. hopes to provide one answer to that question by providing a table-based method of discovering the reasons behind a particular villain's behavior. The tables focus on five main areas: origin, goal, methods, role, and emotion.<br/><br/>For example, let's take poor Garag, an orc with a penchant for accidental destruction. His career began as a youngling in the tribe when he tried to help a stranger injured on the road and in the process of &quot;saving&quot; him, caused howling pain and the spillage of a great deal of blood loss (Origin: &quot;Good deed gone bad&quot;). As a result, he gained some status in the tribe as a vicious warrior. He liked the feeling (Goal: &quot;Recognition&quot;) and decided he couldn't stop now. He grew over time to fit his reputation, gaining strength, weapons, and brute force methods of damaging his enemies (Method: &quot;Physical might&quot;). But under it all, he's still the scared little youngling who just wanted to help (Core Emotion: &quot;Insecure&quot;).<br/><br/>How does he interact with the PCs? As a reason for them to gather a posse to destroy his orcish raiding party (Role: &quot;Catalyst&quot;). The vicious orcs under Garag's leadership have become a huge problem for a local village on the edge of their territory and the PCs have been contracted to take out the threat...<br/><br/>Meanwhile, on the other side of the galaxy, let's look at Ninuby, an alien from the Omega quadrant who somehow stands to get in the PC's way on an upcoming mission on the outer worlds. Ninuby was picked on as a kid. Puny, pale blue, and not at all the standard for physical excellence demanded by the hive mind, he was kicked out of the nest and left for dead (Origin: &quot;Childhood trauma&quot;). He barely survived through his wits and was taken in by one of the minor species on his planet. But Ninuby never forgot (Goal: &quot;Revenge&quot;). He grew and explored his new environment, learning through trial and error of the flora his hive avoided like the plague. Nearly dying a time or two, he decided he would use these naturally-occurring elements to destroy the hive from within (Method: &quot;Corruption&quot;). He seeks nothing less than the complete destruction of the people who exiled him to die (Core Emotion: &quot;Devastation&quot;).<br/><br/>How does Ninuby get in the way of the PCs? They're delivering goods to the hive when Ninuby's plan goes into action and must stop the attack somehow or be unable to leave again (Role: &quot;Obstacle&quot;). The refueling crew in the hive were among the first to suffer from the strange poison being introduced from the outside world and hive leaders are wondering if the PCs are at fault...<br/><br/>Like all Moebius Adventures supplements, Insta-NPCs #3: Scum and Villainy, Inc. is designed to be system- and genre-neutral.

Aided by the Maanen drive, which allows ships to travel exponentially faster between planetary bodies, and humanity's never-ending push for autonomy, the colonies soon became independent planets. In the ensuing wars, both cold and hot, two powers rose to dominance: the Republic of Mars and United Terra. The political and military impasse has existed for much of the majority of the citizens of the system...<br/><br/>Sol Rising focuses on the conflicts, big and small, of the Sol system primarily involving United Terra and the Martian Republic. You are a Fleet Commander put in charge of the squadrons of your star system. How will you perform your duty when war comes to the Sol system?<br/><br/>Instead of being tasked with merely destroying the enemy every time, every mission is crafted to have unique experiences and objectives. These include things like capturing the enemy space station with marines, escorting a merchant to safety so he can warn the fleet at the next mission, stealthily avoiding detection to plant rebels on an enemy moon, and more. In some missions, your accomplishments and choices will affect the next, triggering ripple effects that make your play through the campaign unique.<br/><br/>In Scenario Play, the players will participate in a single scenario pitting one side against another; the winner is determined by victory conditions set by the scenario (ex. the scenario gives the attacking side the mission of wiping out their opponent and to minimize casualties as much as possible, while the other side is trying to get a specific ship to escape the sector and then to take out as many of the attacker&rsquo;s ships as possible).<br/><br/>Players in a Campaign game participate in a number of scenarios, each having an effect on the next as the story unfolds; the winner of one scenario will have a better starting position in the next (although care has been taken to ensure there will not be a runaway conquest because of this) and the ultimate victory condition is to win the final scenario in the campaign (if the example scenario above was used as a part of a campaign, the second scenario would change based on the outcome of the first; the number of ships the attacker gets and their starting status in scenario two is determined by the ending of scenario one, and if the defender managed to get their special ship out of the sector they get to choose the starting locations of their ships, rather than using a predefined, unorganized starting layout).<br/><br/>"}, "160838": {"poll": [], "name": "Too Human 2: Rise of the Giants", "videogamemode": ["Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["North American Xbox 360 edition"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2479966.png", "videogametheme": ["Fantasy", "Mythology"], "videogamegenre": ["Action RPG"], "videogamedeveloper": ["Silicon Knights"], "videogamefranchise": ["(Unreleased Games - Cancelled)"], "videogameplatform": ["Xbox 360"], "usersrated": "0", "average": "0", "statistics": [], "videogamepublisher": ["(Unknown)"], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2479966_t.png", "description": "<br/><br/><br/>    <br/>        <br/>UNRELEASED GAME - CANCELLED<br/><br/>    <br/>    <br/>        <br/>This game was cancelled in development.

Two players maneuver armies composed of units representing infantry, cavalry, cannon, skirmishers, and leaders, to capture and hold Macysburg, and chase off or destroy the opposing army. The battle lasts for 3 days, 36 day turns divided by 2 night turns.  Units arrive at diverse points on the field during the first 2 days. At night, the armies separate and rally some of the units lost each day.<br/><br/>Command and Maneuver is a simple abstract strategy rules set that allows very rules-light wargames to be constructed.  But as Macysburg demonstrates, it does not necessarily mean a light wargame. By abstracting all of the &ldquo;fiddly bits&rdquo; of wargames, what gets represented are the basic ideas of command control, supply, and maneuver to obtain both strategic and tactical advantage over your opponent. Since all combat is deterministic, players aren&rsquo;t trying to overcome the randomness of combat results tables or dice towers or card draws. But they are trying to overcome chaos created by the combination of the combat and leader rules, which often result in units being out of command.<br/><br/>Armies are fragile in this game, and they &ldquo;feel&rdquo; that way. Combat is very bloody and unforgiving. If you are not careful in your dispositions and advances, you can lose a major chunk of your army in a very few turns, without adequate compensation. Players quickly find themselves adopting combined arms tactics and using formations and units in ways that look very much like standard tactics of the era. By doing things very differently than most wargames, the CaM games tease out and examine different aspects of war.<br/><br/>Macysburg, an abstract riff on the Battle of Gettysburg, is just one of the scenarios you can build with the CaM package, available in a Print and Play and in a Vassal version. The terrain (woods, hills, and town squares) is movable, allowing for a different set-up of the game each time. The elements of the scenario are broken down, laid out, and discussed for players to see how the scenario is constructed and how to vary it. Other scenarios are available and more will be provided. Players are encouraged to experiment with the system.<br/><br/>"}, "160855": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2057685.png", "poll": [], "boardgamedesigner": ["Beth Hughes", "Sam Lamont"], "statistics": [], "yearpublished": "2014", "maxplayers": "5", "boardgameartist": ["Beth Hughes", "Sam Lamont"], "boardgamepublisher": ["Game Salute"], "maxplaytime": "0", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2057685_t.png", "minplaytime": "0", "boardgamecategory": ["Card Game", "Expansion for Base-game", "Fantasy", "Humor"], "description": "From Epic Death!

The group found their way back to the original entrance, only to discover it had been blocked by their pursuers. Luckily, the group knew of an alternative escape route at the back of the mountain, a set of narrow and dangerous stone staircases. As the group charge down the stairs, their pursuers chase after them, showering them with missiles and rolling boulders off the mountain to crush the treasure hunters or block their escape.<br/><br/>The Illusionist: An illusionist has been hypnotizing local women into following him to a nearby cave; they never return to their village. The locals are afraid to climb the stairs to reach the Illusionist&rsquo;s lair, and they also lack any way to combat his magic. For all anyone knows, the illusionist could be building himself a harem of enslaved females, or be preparing a magic ritual that requires human sacrifices&hellip;<br/><br/>The group is hired by the relatives of those kidnapped to end the illusionist&rsquo;s reign of terror. Climbing the stairs to the illusionist&rsquo;s lair is in itself a daunting task, but the additional magical defenses of false stone steps and mini-avalanche traps make the journey even deadlier still. To make matters even worse, the illusionist&rsquo;s henchmen archers patrol the top of the stairs, raining arrows down at the heroes as they attempt the climb. Some of the archers are not real however, but merely illusory copies to keep would-be heroes guessing.<br/><br/>If they reach the top, the group has the choice of two different caves that could be the lair of the illusionist. One is a cavern brimming with illusory beasts and traps to distract the group enough to let Illusionist try to escape from the other and down the stairs, leading the group on a second charge of The Stairs.<br/><br/>"}, "160861": {"rpgdesigner": ["Jacob Randolph"], "rpg": ["Dungeon World"], "statistics": [], "name": "The Guest Star: A Dungeon World Playbook for Extra Players on Game Night", "rpgartist": ["Jacob Randolph"], "rpgproducer": ["Jacob Randolph"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2047521.png", "usersrated": "0", "rpgitemversion": ["PDF version"], "average": "0", "rpggenre": ["Comedy / Satire", "Fantasy (High Fantasy)"], "rpgpublisher": ["(Web published)"], "rpgcategory": ["Sourcebook (rules/options to enhance play)"], "poll": [], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2047521_t.png", "description": "From publisher blurb:<br/><br/>Did too many players show up for game night?

Considerable research, including review of many oral histories gathered from veterans who flew heavy bombers in the Daylight Strategic Bombing Campaign was done to make Target For Today! function as closely as possible to reality. The game was designed to provide YOU, the player with the ultimate gaming experience depicting the same types of events and decision making processes experienced by our veterans who flew the real-life missions.<br/><br/>Now, YOU are in command of an individual bomber on an individual mission over Hitler's Third Reich -flying either the B-17F or G Model Flying Fortress or the B24D, or J Model Liberator bomber. A series of individual missions are strung together in the campaign game to form the player's tour of duty. Just as it was in real life, the objective of the game for the player is to survive your tour of duty so you can rotate home.<br/><br/>The US Army Air Forces suffered one of the highest casualty rates of any branch of the military services including the US Marine Corps during World War II. The heavy bomber groups of the 8th Air Force flew a combined total of 10,631 strike missions over Europe during the period of this game. The 8th Air Force lost 4145 bombers on these missions. Surviving your tour of duty could be difficult!<br/><br/>TARGET FOR TODAY is an advanced update of Glen Frank's classic game B17, QUEEN OF THE SKIES. Some familiarity with that game is assumed, but &quot;TARGET FOR TODAY&quot; is a completely new game -you do not need to own B-17, QUEEN OF THE SKIES to play it. New tables are included and the rules are organized according to the sequence of play in any typical mission. TARGET FOR TODAY is designed so that each individual mission is fast and easy to play. The campaign game that comprises your tour of duty offers the player a game that is rich in detail, making the game as realistic as possible while still remaining playable.<br/><br/>In the tradition of B-17 Queen of the Skies, and following in the foot steps of B-29 Superfortress, comes a new solitaire game from Steve Dixon. Bob Best and Shawn Rife Steve Dixon. Tentatively titled &quot;Bombs Away!&quot;, it has been renamed &quot;Target for Today!&quot;. Fly a single mission, a single campaign or fly the entire air campaign from 1942 to 1945 with the 8th or 15th Air Force, piloting either a B-17F, B17G, B24D, B24J and for those so inclined, the YB-40.<br/> The target list will be greatly expanded for the 8th and 15th Air Forces.

Angefangen hat das Ganze im Februar 2013 mit einer vagen Abenteueridee unsererseits und wir fanden, dass ein intrigenreiches Setting am besten dazu passen w&uuml;rde. Darum fiel die Schauplatz-Wahl auf eine nat&uuml;rlich begrenzte Ecke im Arltum Nordek, die wir <br/>auf den Namen Throntal tauften.<br/><br/>Ab diesem Zeitpunkt entwickelte unser urspr&uuml;nglich simpler Ansatz, &bdquo;irgendetwas daraus zu machen&ldquo;, relativ schnell eine Art Eigenleben und uferte nach und nach immer weiter aus. Neben der Caera-Box erwies sich das Slayerforum als grandiose Inspirationsquelle &ndash; allen voran nat&uuml;rlich der virtuelle Ableger der Hellweiter Kronkriege (Arltum-2-Vote), aber auch Christian Kennigs Kampagne zum &bdquo;Waldmark-Konflikt&ldquo;.

Ganz nebenbei wollten wir damit auch den Hut vor der (in unseren Augen) &bdquo;Mutter aller Regionalb&auml;nde&ldquo; ziehen und ein bisschen in Erinnerungen an die gute alte Zeit mit Volo&rsquo;s Guides to the Realms schwelgen.<br/><br/>Mit den spielbereiten Charakteren (SC-2-Go) haben wir ein kleines Goodie f&uuml;r die Spieler-Fraktion eingebaut. Der Hintergedanke dabei war, dass sich Hellweit eher weniger als Tummelplatz f&uuml;r eine typische Abenteurergruppe eignet: Welcher Bael w&uuml;rde schon einer aus allen Ecken Caeras dahergelaufenen Bande von Mietklingen vertrauen, wenn der eigene Nachbar daf&uuml;r bekannt ist, alles und jeden zu bestechen? Als Helden taugen daher solche SC besser, deren Hintergrund sie von vornherein in die N&auml;he der Handlung r&uuml;ckt. Die Beispielcharaktere sind aber auch der Beweis daf&uuml;r, dass man sich deswegen nicht unbedingt auf einheimische Nordeker beschr&auml;nken muss. Und falls man sie nicht spielen m&ouml;chte, kann der SL sie ja problemlos recyclen &ndash; zum Beispiel als NSC-Begleiter f&uuml;r seine Spieler.<br/><br/><br/>Translation courtesy of Google:<br/><br/>The following &quot;mini-sourcebook&quot; In a way, the beginning of a - so Helia wants \u263a - multipart Hell wide project dar. It started the whole thing in February 2013 with a vague adventure idea on our part and we found that an intrigue-rich setting would best suit them. That is why the choice fell on a scene of course limited in the corner Arltum Nordek that we<br/>baptized in the name Throntal.<br/><br/>From this point, our originally simple approach, &quot;anything to do with it&quot; developed relatively quickly a life of its own and overflowed gradually further and further. In addition to the Caera box, the Slayer forum proved to be terrific source of inspiration - all, of course, the virtual offshoot of Hell Next Kronkriege (Arltum-2-Vote), but also Christian Kennigs campaign on the &quot;forest marrow conflict.&quot; By the time we came to the realization that &quot;our baby&quot; first could do with a bit fluffy trappings and the result you now have in mind ...<br/><br/> Welcome to the Throntal is primarily intended as an introduction, reference and Game Help for SL who want to try it out on individual adventures or even a campaign in a hellwarischen sandbox setting.

Along the way we wanted hence the hat before (in our eyes) pull &quot;mother of all regional volumes&quot; and indulge a little reminiscing about the good old days with Volo's Guide to the Realms.<br/><br/>With the ready to play characters (SC-2-Go), we have built a small goodie for the player faction. The thinking behind this was that Hell wide rather less than a playground for a typical group of adventurers is: Which Bael would ever trust a running up from all corners Caeras gang of Mietklingen when one's neighbor is known to bribe everyone and everything? As a hero, therefore, such SC suck better background, they engaged from the outset in the vicinity of the plot.

In every game, you and your opponent match wits and resources over key events. If you can thwart your opponent, you claim the event, bringing you closer to victory. Whether you seek to triumph through military might, or use diplomacy to achieve your ends, the fate of the galaxy rests in your hands.<br/><br/>On one side of this galactic battleground are the heroes of the Rebel Alliance. Only rarely can these heroes go toe to toe with the unlimited reserves of the Imperial Navy and Army. Instead, the iconic characters of Star Wars and the unsung heroes of the Rebellion must work in secret, utilizing diplomacy, reconnaissance, and the Force to achieve their aims. Even when the Rebellion deploys its full military strength to win a battle or destroy a key Imperial emplacement, they need the groundwork put in place by Alliance Special Forces.<br/><br/>Opposing the heroic endeavors of the Rebel Alliance is the massive power of the Empire, led by the twisted Emperor. The dark side of the Force is strong with the Emperor and Darth Vader, and the military might of the Empire is unparalleled across the galaxy. Whether you undertake aggressive negotiations or hire bounty hunters and scum to ferret out Rebel spies, making the Empire the ultimate power in the galaxy rests in your hands.<br/><br/>To successfully win these struggles and reclaim the galaxy in Star Wars: Empire vs. Rebellion, you will need to utilize all of your resources. Every turn, you can increase your faction&rsquo;s presence at the current event by drawing the top card from your deck and putting it into play. Each resource card you play give you more power and brings you closer to the objective value of the current event. As an example, the resource card shown to the right has a resource value of five, which it contributes to your total resource value while in play. Playing more resource cards may bring you closer to your target, but it also makes your efforts more obvious. If your total resource value ever passes the event&rsquo;s objective value, your forces are discovered and your opponent claims the event.<br/><br/>Instead of playing a new resource card, you can also trigger the power of a resource card currently in play, exercising the might of the Empire or the cunning of the Rebel Alliance. To activate a resource card&rsquo;s power, you must exhaust it by rotating it 90 degrees clockwise. Once a card is exhausted, you can't use its power unless it becomes ready again. In addition, an exhausted card contributes its exhausted resource value, shown in the lower left-hand corner of the card while the resource is ready.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": ["Brazilian First edition", "English first edition", "French first edition", "German first edition", "Greek first edition", "Hungarian First Edition", "Italian first edition", "Polish first edition", "Spanish first edition"], "average": "6.4799", "name": "Star Wars: Empire vs. Rebellion", "playingtime": "60", "boardgamemechanic": ["Deck / Pool Building", "Hand Management", "Memory", "Variable Player Powers"], "age": "10", "usersrated": "1022", "boardgamesubdomain": ["Family Games", "Thematic Games"], "boardgamefamily": ["Star Wars"], "boardgamepodcastepisode": ["Episode 30: Gen Con 2014, Machi Koro and Pandemic: Contagion"]}, "160965": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2050477.png", "poll": [], "boardgamedesigner": ["Charles Darrow"], "statistics": [], "yearpublished": "2010", "maxplayers": "8", "boardgameartist": ["(Uncredited)"], "boardgamepublisher": ["Identity Games International B.V."], "maxplaytime": "100", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2050477_t.png", "minplaytime": "100", "boardgamecategory": ["Economic", "Negotiation"], "description": "A monopoly (from Greek monos &mu;\u03cc&nu;&omicron;&sigmaf; (alone or single) + polein &pi;&omega;&lambda;&epsilon;\u1fd6&nu; (to sell)) exists when a specific person or enterprise is the only supplier of a particular commodity.<br/><br/>Monopoly is a roll-and-move game where players move around the game board buying or trading properties, developing their properties with houses and hotels.

Players are able to enhance the abilities of their characters by scanning cards.

From a hillside bunker to a large roadside outpost, and even the infamous &quot;Bandit Fortress&quot; itself.<br/><br/>When I was a kid I had my first experience GM'ing my own roleplaying game. I didn't know what to do, so I made a basic story about a princess being kidnapped by bandits, and my players had to devise a way to assult their wooden fortress. I remember vividly that one of my players (the rogue of course) decides his character wouldn't take that kind of risk, he'd rather just wait in the nearest tree. The rest of the party groaned and complained, since it'll be even HARDER without him, but up the tree he climbed. He sat in that tree, while the other, less dextrous players tried to get him down by throwing rocks. I remember laughing so hard, as his &quot;friends&quot; almost kill him to get him out of the tree, to come help &quot;get killed&quot;. Well, they left him, assaulted the fortress, and hammed it all up and got caught. From about a mile away, the rogue watched the camp from his tree, and after he saw smokefires, he decided things must have turned for the worst. So, being the rogue and reluctant hero he was, he decided to investigate after all. He snuck in, rescued the party, saved the day.<br/><br/>"}, "160990": {"rpgdesigner": ["Ray Chapel"], "rpg": ["Pathfinder System Compatible Product"], "statistics": [], "name": "The Abstract Thief", "rpgartist": ["Gary Dupuis", "Matt Morrow"], "rpgproducer": ["Ray Chapel"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2049257.png", "usersrated": "0", "rpgitemversion": ["PDF version"], "average": "0", "rpggenre": ["Fantasy (High Fantasy)"], "rpgpublisher": ["Quasar  Knight Enterprises"], "rpgcategory": ["Sourcebook (rules/options to enhance play)"], "poll": [], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2049257_t.png", "description": "From publisher blurb:<br/><br/>Steal the Unstealable!<br/><br/>The Abstract Thief is a new base class for the Pathfinder Role-Playing Game.
