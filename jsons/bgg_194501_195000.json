Single action turns: Just like in a real fight, initiative goes back and forth and you can guard, respond and counter. With one action per turn games are fast-paced and energetic and have multiple tactics available rather than always a single &ldquo;best play&rdquo;.<br/><br/>2.    Re-set every round: At the start of each round most of the cards on the field are re-shuffled and your hand is drawn again. This makes the game fast from the first turn of the game while still keeping it consistent.<br/><br/>3.    Each card is useful: Each card has an elemental ability. All cards you can&rsquo;t cast can be added to cards you can to buff them. So it doesn&rsquo;t matter if you can play all your cards or only one, both hands are good in their own way. Also when casting a card the top card of your deck is flipped and its elemental ability is added and if it&rsquo;s an emotion (your resources) then you play it and can use it on that turn.<br/><br/>"}, "194586": {"poll": [], "name": "Combat Chess (1997)", "videogamemode": ["Hotseat", "Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["Windows Downloadable edition"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2936009.jpg", "videogametheme": ["Fantasy"], "usersrated": "1", "videogamedeveloper": ["Strategy First Inc."], "videogamegenre": ["Classic Games", "Strategy"], "videogameplatform": ["Windows"], "average": "4.5", "statistics": [], "videogamepublisher": ["Minds Eye Productions"], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2936009_t.jpg", "description": "User Summary<br/><br/>Combat Chess takes the basic chess game and adds an imaginative element for players bored with the simple &quot;black vs. white&quot; chess board.Combat Chess is written to Grand Master standards and supports play against human opponents.<br/><br/>"}, "194587": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2915533.png", "poll": [], "boardgamedesigner": ["(Uncredited)"], "statistics": [], "yearpublished": "2016", "maxplayers": "30", "boardgameartist": ["(Uncredited)"], "boardgamepublisher": ["Varonis"], "maxplaytime": "0", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2915533_t.png", "minplaytime": "0", "boardgamecategory": ["Card Game", "Humor", "Party Game", "Print & Play"], "description": "Extra deck of cards for Cards Against IT with Security based cards.<br/>Pomotion item from Varonis, an IT security company<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "4", "boardgameversion": ["Print-and-Play edition"], "average": "0", "name": "Cards Against Info Security", "playingtime": "0", "boardgamemechanic": ["Hand Management", "Simultaneous Action Selection"], "age": "0", "boardgameexpansion": [], "usersrated": "0", "boardgamefamily": ["Cards Against Humanity"]}, "194589": {"boardgamedesigner": ["Cecilia Hensen", "Mie Petersen"], "average": "6", "poll": [], "name": "Ramasjang", "playingtime": "30", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": ["Hand Management"], "yearpublished": "2016", "usersrated": "3", "maxplayers": "5", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3098382_t.jpg", "boardgameartist": ["Lisa Schantl"], "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["Wotan Games"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3098382.jpg", "boardgameversion": ["First edition"], "maxplaytime": "30", "boardgamecategory": ["Card Game"], "age": "7", "minplaytime": "10", "description": "Loki was a clever and crafty god and when he played games with some of the other gods in Asgard  he made up rules for his own games.

Their powers, abilities and descriptions are drawn from the mythological source material, rather than modern fantasy fiction. These are magical races the way ancient people imagined them. Dvergar can be killed by sunlight, but they also have powerful spells. Ljosalfar have a gliding ability and are skilled with light magic. Fauns are infamous for their debauchery and musical talents.

Each card has two colored squares, so there are 6x4 colored squares in play.<br/><br/>Each round, you may rotate one card or switch positions of two adjacent cards. You score points if you form a line of three or more squares of the same color. The more lines you form, the more points you score. Cards used to form lines are removed, but you may choose some of them to be reshuffled. Then new cards are placed to fill the cleared space. Repeat this process until no lines are formed.<br/><br/>This game has puzzle and deck building factors. You should watch the play field closely to detect a big-point move.

Parasites, living symbiotic existences in the shadows cast by the arcologies, feeding from the scraps dangled by the megacorporations and then scurrying back to the shadows to avoid their dismissive, destructive gaze. Those vast multinational corporations &mdash; &ldquo;Zaibatsus&rdquo;, some call them &mdash; squat over everything, pulling the strings, controlling the flow of money, information, goods, and people. Governments scamper around their feet, begging for scraps. Hydrophilic lubricious polymers and automated cleaners keep their arcologies shining amidst the grey-brown urban sprawl which surrounds them. Corporate financial muscle pushes people around the city like blood. The megacorporations. Humanity&rsquo;s most successful artificial organism. Technology keeps changing, shifting, mutating -- it&rsquo;s adapt or die. There&rsquo;s a sticky film of information smeared over everything, a networked datasphere in service to the megacorps. Buy this. Obey that. Buy more. See, the corps aren&rsquo;t satisfied with having it all. They want more, and the only way they can get it is by eating their own. For the megacorporations, espionage, theft, kidnapping and murder are just file folders in the system architecture of success. For you though, they&rsquo;re rungs on the slippery ladder out of the caustic industrial air the rest of us breathe. Play your cards right and you&rsquo;ll be set: reputation, money, credibility. Everything you want. Freedom. But one false step and they&rsquo;ll take away everything. The corps don&rsquo;t need you. They need people like you. Screw up and you&rsquo;ll be replaced by the next mouthy punk with too much raw talent and bloody ambition and not enough smarts. Tread carefully.

You are the extended assets of vast multinational corporations, operating in the criminal underground, and performing the tasks that those multinationals can&rsquo;t do -- or can&rsquo;t be seen to do. You are deniable, professional and -- ultimately -- disposable.<br/><br/>This game contains adult themes and adult language.<br/><br/>You&rsquo;re still here, punk? You want to play with the pros?

You've heard of American History X? Well, this is American History Y -- as in Yuge battles! Heroes of History is an expandable card game that lets players use real-life people, weapons, battlegrounds, and items to battle each other for supremacy. Each card features professionally-drawn pictures of historical figures such as Tecumseh, Clara Barton, and Deborah Sampson; locations such as Saratoga, Little Bighorn, and Fort McHenry; and items such as the Winchester and Ben Franklin's Lightning Rod. It's a fun way to learn -- or an educational way to have fun.<br/><br/>Game play is simple. Each player takes turns drawing cards and playing Characters to the Trench. Players can also play Supply cards that have some temporary effects. They can also equip weapons to characters and play Battleground cards that give bonuses to all Characters in play for the player that has summoned them. Players begin with 50 State Points and take turns attacking each other until one player is reduced to 0 or a player runs out of cards to play.<br/><br/>Future sets will include Heroes from history as well as from mythology. What would happen if Thor faced off against Washington? What if Washington had Mjolnir and Thor had a bayonet?

These warlords are the clan leaders of specific territories.  Each have characteristics that are based on history.<br/><br/>Players, in secret, choose a castle territory.  When all players choose their castle territory players place their castle into their castle territory.<br/><br/>Clan tokens are placed in territories owned.  Players who wish to make certain warlords strong will stack clan tokens into these warlords.  Clan tokens represent both 1000 samurai and 1 HP for that character.<br/><br/>Players make 3 actions in turn.  This happens twice which represents 1 decade or 1 round of play.  Players draw cards and get Clan Token bonuses after each half decade.<br/><br/>Actions:  Bribe, attack, move, castle movement.<br/><br/>Bribe:  Bribe an adjoining warlord by committing 1 clan token to the action.  11 or 12 must be rolled on the dice.  If successful the committed clan token goes on top of the enemy warlord and his character card is given to the attacking player.  The warlord has switched sides.  If the bribe is unsuccessful the committed clan token gets put into the clan token stack of the adjoining warlord.<br/><br/>Attack:<br/>Attack an adjoining enemy.  Advance as many warlords and their samurai armies to the border of the enemy territory.  The enemy may play cards against you at this time, do defensive troop movements.  The attacker may also play cards against the enemy.  Once card play is completed the attacker must choose which warlord will go into the duel.<br/><br/>The warlords duel!  D12's are rolled.  The attacker always gets +1 and the difference of the dice determines the damage.  Damage is counted by removing Clan Tokens from the stack of the warlord.  In a duel, the Clan Tokens now represent the HP of the warlord for the duel.  When Clan Tokens are gone the warlord is slain and the victor can move as many or no warlords and/or clan tokens into the claimed territory.<br/><br/>Movement Action: During a player's turn they may move as many warlords and/or clan tokens from one territory to another territory that is connected through ownership of land.<br/><br/>Castle Movement Action: requiring an entire decade (4 actions) a player may move their castle from one territory to another territory that is connected through ownership of land.<br/><br/>Object of Game:<br/>Destroy all enemy castles.  If your castle remains standing you win.  Or, Dueling Samurai has a points scoring system that lets players end the game at the end of any half decade.  This being a tested tournament game, the points scoring system is easy to follow and very well developed.<br/><br/>Card Play:<br/>Players may play cards at any time in the game, making this a highly engaging and interactive board game.  <br/>Bonus Cards: (Archers, Dueling Samurai, Horses and Ambush)  These have individual use in the game, but can also be combined during your turn to get more clan tokens.  There is a very challenging balance between hording these cards and using them for combat making the strategy very deep.<br/><br/>Tournament Cards: (Sumo and Dojo)<br/>Host a tournament.  If you win there are big rewards.  If you lose it can be a devastating turning point.<br/><br/>Attack Cards:  Religious Conversion, Spy, Ninja, Small Pox Demons, Demons, Revenge, Sniper Cannons, Riflemen, Battering Rams, Cannons, Navy, Assassin, Ronin, Pirates, Bandits, Inciting Revolt.  These cards (other than Ninja) can be played at any time in the game.  Each utilize D12 or D6 to deal damage.  1's are always fails and so are 2's on D12's.  On fails players roll against themselves.<br/><br/>Defense Cards: These are used to block attack cards, often reversing the attack to a more devastating effect.  Some of them can be played anytime you are under attack, providing a defensive attack option.  Chinese medicine, Knife Cart, Furious Defense, Scouts, Gold, Bushido, Seppuku.<br/><br/>Peace Cards:  These are used to create peace.  Each card causes a different type of peace based on geography and the location of the clans that go into a truce.  Diplomacy (by Marriage, Decree of the Emperor or by Hostage Exchange), Peace Pipe, Brothels, Festival, Ceremony, Gambling.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": ["2016"], "name": "Dueling Samurai", "playingtime": "240", "boardgamemechanic": ["Area Movement", "Dice Rolling", "Simulation"], "average": "7.17333", "usersrated": "15", "age": "13", "boardgamepodcastepisode": ["Interview Special #4: Richard Janutka (Big Forest Creativity Lab - Dueling Samurai)"]}, "194660": {"poll": [], "name": "Adobe Wells", "playingtime": "0", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": ["Area Control / Area Influence", "Grid Movement", "Hex-and-Counter"], "yearpublished": "1977", "usersrated": "0", "boardgamefamily": ["Il Gioco delle Battaglie"], "maxplayers": "2", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2914528_t.jpg", "average": "0", "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["Atlantic"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2914528.jpg", "boardgameversion": ["First edition"], "maxplaytime": "0", "boardgamecategory": ["American Indian Wars", "Miniatures", "Wargame"], "age": "0", "minplaytime": "0", "description": "User summary:<br/>In the year 1977, Atlantic produced, inside their 15 games-line called &ldquo;Il Gioco delle Battaglie&rdquo; (The Game of Battles), 5 &quot;board-wargames&quot; of the Old West/Indian Wars theme (code numbers from 1456 to 1460 in their catalog).<br/><br/>Each set included 1/72-HO scale toy soldiers, vehicles and accessories from Atlantic production, plus a different playing field game-map, related rules and historical introductory notes for every battle.<br/><br/>The game-maps (large pieces of paper of 68 for 68,5x49 cm) were photographs from above of 3D dioramas of hypothetical battlefields of the battles represented.

It was just named &quot;Best of 2015&quot; by Toys Bulletin as one of the &quot;Best games you have never heard of&quot; in a &quot;100% Independent Review&quot;.<br/><br/>The game contents include 360 Scout markers (one set of 72 for each player in 5 different colors) 21 Caprocks, 5 Captain player pieces used to move each player around the perimeter of the board, 2 &ndash; twelve sided multi-colored dice, a game board that measures approximately 19&Prime; x 20&Prime; and a nicely illustrated set of rules.<br/><br/>To play the game, players alternate turns by rolling one die and moving their captain from the space occupied on the perimeter of the game board to the matching color on the perimeter as shown on the die. Once there, there are several options open to the player, depending on the types of figures outlined on the space landed on. If there are one or more hexagons outlined in black, the player can place that many Scouts in the colored zone that matches his die roll. If there is a &quot;half-hexagon&quot; mark on the space, the player can replace any one of the Caprocks, positioned in the colored zone matching the die roll, with one of his/her Scouts.<br/><br/>An optional move that can be made on a player&rsquo;s turn is a challenge, and this can only be done if the space is marked for a challenge, either a regular challenge or a wild challenge. When a player performs a challenge, he chooses another player&rsquo;s Scout which is adjacent to his own Scout in the colored zone that matches his die roll, or in the case of a wild challenge, he may opt to choose an adjacent player&rsquo;s scout in any zone or even one that is in an adjacent colored zone, which greatly expands his choices. But the challenge must originate from the zone color that matches the die roll. To complete a challenge, each player rolls one 12 sided die, and the winner is determined based on a colorwheel that is conveniently located both on the game board and inside a player&rsquo;s storage box. The colors are arranged in a circular pie-chart manner, and the colors, starting at the top of the circle, beat the colors as they are displayed clockwise around the circle, much like the hands of a clock. In other words, the color located at 12 beats the color at 1, and the color at 7 beats the color at 6. The challenge winner replaces the losing Scout with one of his own. Challenges can continue as long as the player who initiated the challenge continues to win.<br/><br/>The last and most exciting part of a player&rsquo;s turn involves a closer look at those C-Traps. There is bit more here than first meets the eye. If at any time during a turn, that player&rsquo;s Scouts form a C shape by surrounding any competing Scouts, regardless of color, all Scouts caught within the C-Trap are replaced by Scouts of the player controlling the C-Trap. In order to complete a C-Trap, there must be a minimum of 4 Scouts to surround 1 competitor Scout. But, as the game progresses, careful placement of Scouts can create gigantic C-Traps and suddenly change the entire face of the game board. Players can easily lose 10 or more Scouts on a single turn. The game ends when all of the hexagons in all of the colored zones are covered by Scouts or Caprocks.

But watch out, or you will get into trouble for accidents and traffic violations!<br/><br/>You also have to maintain order inside the bus. Calm upset passengers, repair stuck doors, sell tickets correctly, and extend the ramp for wheel chair passengers in a timely manner. You will have to be efficient if you want to stick to your schedule, as it is only by doing this that you will build up your reputation in the city, earn the trust of your passengers, and most importantly, make money! The better your reputation, the larger the contracts you can secure, and the more buses will be available to your company in the shop. Unlock additional districts of the city and carefully plan routes for the employees you will acquire in the included job exchange.<br/><br/>As you grow more successful, you will also acquire more and more advertising banners for your buses, which bring in additional money. If your buses are too dull, you can paint and decorate them with unlockable decals, ensuring that your passengers reach their destinations in the coolest way possible.<br/><br/>You think bus drivers are lonely? Not in Bus Simulator 16! Invite your friends into your game in multiplayer mode and let them take over routes for you. The money they earn can be used to expand your shared company and thus perfect public transportation in your city.<br/><br/>You want to drive even more buses and arrange Sunny Springs to fit your expectations? Then you can just construct the city to suit your own taste. Bus Simulator 16 is mod-friendly, and you can use programs like Blender and Gimp to adjust the visual appearance of the existing buses to your liking, as well as integrate your own custom buses and buildings into the game.<br/><br/>Source: The Game Website.<br/><br/>"}, "194745": {"rpgartist": ["Thomas Fayen"], "rpgitemversion": ["\"Artless\" PDF version"], "statistics": [], "name": "Guidebook to the Duchy of Valnwall", "rpgdesigner": ["Peter C.

There are upsides and downsides to running a sandbox campaign rather than one where the characters are presented with a series of clear objectives, all of them roughly designed for the character&rsquo;s current level of experience. A sandbox campaign like the Borderland Provinces requires that the players are able to identify objectives for themselves, or else they may become paralyzed with indecision, looking for the &ldquo;right&rdquo; place to go. So, on the Game Master&rsquo;s side of the GM screen, it&rsquo;s very important that the characters are presented with lots of choices wherever they go. This &mdash; as any experienced Game Master will immediately note &mdash; makes a lot of work for the Game Master. How do you generate those choices? Do you need to prepare five or six different adventures for each time the characters enter a tavern and start asking questions?<br/><br/>This book is a resource for generating journeys, but in doing so it allows you to fill the world with a realistic jumble of objectives, possibilities, opportunities, and motivations for the characters, keeping them from asking, &ldquo;Well, what are we supposed to do?&rdquo; It might take them a bit of practice to switch into the &ldquo;sandbox&rdquo; mentality, but soon they will be asking, &ldquo;Which opportunity do we want to take?&rdquo; And that brings us to the reason for this book, because at that point they&rsquo;re going to need lots of options, and it&rsquo;s your job to produce those options.<br/><br/>So we get to the well-known fact about running a sandbox campaign. It&rsquo;s not necessarily more work for the Game Master, but it requires much more improvisation and thinking on your feet than a programmed adventure path does. It&rsquo;s a method used more by experienced Game Masters for this reason, and there are actually some groups of players who feel like it&rsquo;s too unfocused. However, for those who like the feeling of forging their own destinies in a living world, the sandbox style of play in unparalleled. The Lost Lands: Borderland Provinces is designed for that difficult but highly-rewarding type of Game Mastery, and this book is a tool for handling the &ldquo;journeying&rdquo; part of a sandbox.<br/><br/>"}, "194751": {"rpgartist": ["Robert Altbauer", "Colin Chan", "Felipe Gaona", "Chris McFann", "MKultra Studio", "Artem Shukaev", "Charles Wright (I)"], "rpg": ["Pathfinder System Compatible Product"], "poll": [], "name": "Oath of the Predator (Pathfinder)", "rpgdesigner": ["James Spahn"], "rpgproducer": ["Jeff Harkness", "Greg A.

Thus, e.g. two &quot;Blue Rank&quot; characters engaged in a lengthy series of opposed actions will switch back and forth in victory.<br/><br/>Note the game was published as a series of forum posts, each containing elaboration of a portion of the game mechanics.<br/><br/>"}, "194760": {"rpgartist": ["(Uncredited)"], "statistics": [], "name": "GIGO (Issue 2 - 1974)", "rpgdesigner": ["Greg Costikyan", "Gerard Houarner", "Charles Jacques", "John Liberman", "Ted Pons", "Scott Rosenberg"], "rpgproducer": ["Greg Costikyan"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2915668.jpg", "usersrated": "0", "average": "0", "rpgissue": ["GIGO"], "rpg": ["Dungeons & Dragons (Original Edition)"], "rpgpublisher": ["(Self-Published)"], "rpgissueversion": ["PDF Version", "Standard Edition"], "poll": [], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2915668_t.jpg", "description": "GIGO (Garbage In, Garbage Out)<br/>Issue 2<br/>Late 1974<br/><br/>Published as PDF in 2009<br/><br/>"}, "194761": {"rpgartist": ["(Uncredited)"], "statistics": [], "name": "GIGO (Issue 3 - 1975)", "rpgdesigner": ["Greg Costikyan", "Gerard Houarner", "Charles Jacques", "John Liberman", "Gina Peterson", "Robert Zscilan"], "rpgproducer": ["Greg Costikyan"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2915666.jpg", "usersrated": "0", "average": "0", "rpgissue": ["GIGO"], "rpg": ["Dungeons & Dragons (Original Edition)"], "rpgpublisher": ["(Self-Published)"], "rpgissueversion": ["PDF Version", "Standard Edition"], "poll": [], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2915666_t.jpg", "description": "GIGO (Garbage In, Garbage Out)<br/>Issue 3<br/>Early 1975<br/><br/>Published as PDF in 2009<br/><br/>"}, "194762": {"rpgartist": ["(Uncredited)"], "statistics": [], "name": "GIGO (Issue 4 - Sep 1975)", "rpgdesigner": ["Greg Costikyan", "Gerard Houarner", "Charles Jacques", "John Liberman", "Scott Rosenberg"], "rpgproducer": ["Greg Costikyan"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2915663.jpg", "usersrated": "0", "average": "0", "rpgissue": ["GIGO"], "rpg": ["Dungeons & Dragons (Original Edition)"], "rpgpublisher": ["(Self-Published)"], "rpgissueversion": ["PDF Version", "Standard Edition"], "poll": [], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2915663_t.jpg", "description": "GIGO (Garbage In, Garbage Out)<br/>Issue 4<br/>September 21, 1975<br/><br/>Published as PDF in 2009<br/><br/>"}, "194763": {"rpgartist": ["Luigi Castellani", "Fred L.

Original title was Bunny Island.)<br/><br/>In Short: Tile-laying modular board game; main mechanic is territorial control.<br/><br/>In Full:<br/><br/>You are a rabbit --  one of a wandering band of rabbits in search of a new land to call home. After many months at sea, you and your companions discover a beautiful, uninhabited island. Splitting up into your separate tribes (Blue, Red, Yellow, or Brown), you will each set out from Founder's Hill to explore the island, discovering new areas to build up and plant carrots. It is up to you to lead your tribe into the unknown and develop the largest and most successful civilization on the island!<br/><br/>While it looks cute at first, Rabbit Island reveals itself as a very competitive and multi-faceted game. The primary aim is territorial control, and there are several supporting mechanics that increase your strategic potential, including Action Cards and Harvest Groups.<br/><br/>Each player starts out with a rabbit pawn, 1000 Carrot Tokens, and 15 Building Tokens. There are three phases to the game - Explore, Build, and scoring (Conquer!). The main goal of the game is to gain the most Victory Points by the end of 20 rounds of play (or 10, if playing a short game).<br/><br/>During the Explore Phase, each player lays down the uniquely shaped Map Tiles to create the board and form the Pawprint Paths. Players also get the chance to build their first Camps (lowest building level) on the Territory Tiles.<br/><br/>During the Build Phase, players now follow the Pawprint Paths around the Island until they reach the Tunnel Tiles, which take them right back to Founder's Hill to start following the paths over again. They will Harvest new carrots from their established Territories, and continue to upgrade their buildings - from Camp to Village, and Village to Town - for more Victory Points!<br/><br/>By upgrading an opponent's Territory, you can wrest away control to become the new Territory Owner! All players will receive Victory Points for each building level they establish, so build build build - but watch out for Earthquakes, Poor Harvests, and more, from the Action Card deck!<br/><br/>Harvest Groups are two or more adjacent Territories owned by the same player; these areas equal big Harvests for their Owner.<br/><br/>The Conquer Phase is the scoring phase, where players count the number of Victory Points each building level has netted them. There is one extra point awarded to the player with the most Carrot Tokens, and another point awarded to the player with the largest Harvest Group.<br/><br/>Who will come out on top at the end? Conquer your opponents and feast with your tribe!<br/><br/>"}, "194778": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2909909.jpg", "poll": [], "boardgamedesigner": ["Ian Brody"], "statistics": [], "boardgamecompilation": ["Quartermaster General", "Quartermaster General: Air Marshal"], "yearpublished": "2016", "maxplayers": "6", "boardgamepublisher": ["ASYNCRON games"], "maxplaytime": "90", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2909909_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "90", "boardgamecategory": ["World War II"], "description": "This edition contains Quartermaster General and the Quartermaster General: Air Marshal together in one box.<br/><br/><br/>Quartermaster General is a fast-paced game that puts you in command of the major powers of the Second World War.

After the release of the previous edition we got a lot of feedback from players and we felt that we haven't reached the full potential of it yet. Check out the improved Car Mechanic Simulator with new features, cars and parts. There is a lot of new stuff to present.<br/><br/>This is the next generation of Car Mechanic Simulator, one of the best simulation games on Steam in 2014.<br/><br/>Gameplay<br/>Take on the role of the car mechanic and repair cars for your clients. Spend the earned money on expanding your workshop and improving your skills. Buy worn out cars, renovate them and sell with profit or become a famous car collector. If you manage your business well, you will surely succeed in the market.<br/><br/>Car repairs<br/>The essence of the game. It is your job. It is the way you get cash. It is the way you live... Ok, it is maybe not that important, anyway that is the basic activity in the game. Customer comes in and mysteriously says that his car is broken but he needs it for tomorrow. The clock starts right now.<br/><br/>Mission system<br/>Unlike in the previous edition, jobs are generated randomly, and the player will need to choose on which car he will work. It seems like there is a group of customers waiting in front of the workshop for the mechanic...<br/>Players can take limited amount of jobs in the same time and every one of them will be time-restricted. There will be different difficulty and complexity levels and of course, different payment levels. Wise management is the key here.<br/><br/>Workshop management<br/>After whole day of hard work it is time to count your cash and then look around your business. What should I buy to improve my performance? What would attract more clients? You can always just buy more posters on the wall but it is not something called 'great investment' for such a serious business, right?<br/><br/>Car auctions<br/>Speaking of investments.There is a chance for making even more money in the car auction house. Choose wisely, buy used or old cars and renovate them to sell with profit... Or, if you are one of those vintage car lovers, you can have your own collection.<br/><br/>Car models<br/>Cars will be fully dismountable to the car frame, so we are talking about some amazing level of detail here. Every car is made of more than 200 interactive parts, which includes an interior, a car body and the whole engine.<br/><br/>Here is the list of features:<br/><br/>    Car auctions - buy old cars and renovate them. You can then sell them for cash or have your own collection.<br/>    The photo mode - take &quot;before&quot; and &quot;after&quot; pictures of the renovated cars.<br/>    Visual tuning - replace bumpers, lights, wheels, a bonnet or a steering wheel to adjust the car for the customer's needs.<br/>    Repair cars for your clients - it is your main source of income.<br/>    An infinite number of randomly generated missions.<br/>    Upgrade your workshop - purchase necessary tools and expand your garage with specific equipment such as lacquer spray booth or dyno. Those reasonable investments will allow you to provide greater range of services.<br/>    16 brand new car models. Each one is made of more than 200 parts.

Use your Bonus cards whenever you want to change the rules of the game and play tricks against your opponents.<br/><br/>Each Cat Prank card has a level of nastiness from 1 to 5. If a player reach 10 points or above in a room, he has to take responsibility for the mess and put a Cat Paw Pawn.<br/><br/>If the Parents go to the room where your Cat Paw Pawn is, you're out of the game.<br/><br/>To win: be the first to play all your Cat Prank cards or last cat standing!<br/><br/>TESTED AND APPROVED :<br/><br/>Here are the top 5 game features that the gamers have liked the most:<br/><br/>1. The players&rsquo; jokes triggered thanks to the Catsass comic art illustrations <br/>2. The level of adrenaline which quickly grows exponentially during the game <br/>3. The possibility to play tricks at the worst possible timing (for the opponent) <br/>4. The duration (15min max) which allows for successive games (revenge!) <br/>5. The fact that no cat was harmed in the making of this game (only humans)<br/><br/>"}, "194820": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2923733.jpg", "poll": [], "boardgamedesigner": ["Dagnis Skurbe"], "statistics": [], "yearpublished": "2016", "maxplayers": "4", "boardgameartist": ["Dagnis Skurbe"], "boardgamepublisher": ["Black'N'White Games Ltd.", "Majora"], "maxplaytime": "120", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2923733_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "45", "boardgamecategory": ["Economic", "Science Fiction", "Space Exploration", "Territory Building"], "description": "Do you have a strategy for colonizing Mars faster than anyone else?<br/><br/>Mission to Mars 2049 is a strategic family board game in which players build colonies on Mars in a race to reach the planet&rsquo;s North Pole.

You start with a single base on the outside of the map and gradually build you colony larger one base at a time until you reach the North Pole of Mars and build a road through the polar ice cap. The player who builds the water extraction station on the center of the map first, wins the game. In order to do that you will need lots of resources (air, food and minerals) which you can  acquire by building resource stations. Each time someone rolls that station on the game die, you get one card for each of the stations you have built for that resource.<br/><br/>To add extra strategies to the game, there are mission cards. Peaceful mission cards will allow you to play peacefully and get ahead by building your own colony and acquiring more resources. Aggressive mission cards will let you attack other players and try to stop them from winning.

During this deplorable period in world history, the major European powers &mdash; Britain, Holland and France &mdash; would mercilessly explore, colonize and fight over its many resources for a hundred years. Naturally, native populations would come to resent and rebel against their foreign exploiters and seek independence, and so it is in this swift-playing game for two, where you emulate a European nation and compete for a continent.<br/><br/>Players get a hand of cards in four types: Explore, Colonize, Exploit and Conflict. Some cards are restricted to a region, others to a single area. Exploration leads to colonization, which leads to exploitation, and sometimes to a conflict between the rival powers. Hand management and timely card play is important in this game.<br/><br/>If more colonists arrive in an area than it will accept, a native uprising will occur. The roll of a die and simple charts settle uprisings (and conflicts) quickly.

A plague whose origin is not widely known wiped out most of the population. Attempts to isolate and purge the cause resulted in wide spread use of major nuclear arsenals and other weapons of mass destruction. Not much was left. Very few people were left. Those that survived found that they had undergone changes.<br/><br/>The technology in the cars is 20 to 40 years past the &quot;weld on a gun, add some steel plate and go get stuck in&quot; that immediately followed the plague and attempted purges. Vehicles are purpose built for their combat role and are far more deadly. Driver protection is at a premium so motorcycles have mostly been relegated to the few remaining fringe gangs. The mortality rate for motorcycle users is so high they are now called &quot;coffins&quot;.<br/><br/>The goal is to survive the game and take out as many opponents' cars as possible. Game play is very fast with each turn lasting 3 to 10 minutes depending on how many cars are on the board. Each player uses a control board for each car that tracks turn speed, two phases of movement, component damage, and driver skill use (offense or defense). For the convention play version of the game these control boards are made of wood. For the mass production version (digital image in gallery), the control boards will be on silk screen impregnated boards (~5mm thick). Players track their car status and maneuvers by placing colored pegs on the control board.<br/><br/>Combat is via opposed dice roles. The attacker gets a pool of dice based on the weapon being shot and the range, speed and direction the target is moving. Driver skill can also add to the attack dice pool. The defender gets defense dice equal to their remaining armor rating and can get additional dice for range, speed and driver skill. Once rolled, any offensive successes over defense score damage. Critical damage is a big part of the game. Any time an attack rolls any successes their is a crit chance. It is extremely unlikely an undamaged car will take a critical hit but a medium to heavily damage car is highly likely to take a critical. The bad news with critical damage is the attacker assigns the damage location. Basically, the attacker hits what his/her driver was aiming for. Critical hits are to be feared and avoided!<br/><br/>Rules can be played at the Quick Play level, standard level or with all optional rules. The largest change between levels is how to handle collisions. Many diagrams are included in the rules to simplify the learning process and reduce the &quot;rules lawyering&quot; that may occur when questions arise.<br/><br/>Each game is played via individual scenario or players can play the long term campaign where they control an entire tribe including all their cars as well as drivers and advanced facilities. As drivers score damage, score critical damage, make kills and win scenarios they gain points that allow them to increase in driver skill or obtain upgrades for their cars. The core version of battle roads miniatures includes basic upgrades for the base cars like a bigger engine, bigger weapons, etc. A later expansion will include full design and upgrades of the cars.<br/><br/>"}, "194890": {"poll": [], "name": "Autocross", "playingtime": "30", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": ["Dice Rolling"], "yearpublished": "1982", "usersrated": "1", "maxplayers": "6", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2923515_t.jpg", "average": "2", "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["Tri\u00e1l"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2923515.jpg", "boardgameversion": ["first edition"], "maxplaytime": "30", "boardgamecategory": ["Racing"], "age": "6", "minplaytime": "15", "description": "Autocross is a vintage dice rolling board game, up to 6 can play.

NO! <br/>Forget about expensive game systems, emulators, disconnected online games, and high-priced yearly roster updates. TECHNO BOWL takes everything you love about arcade and video game football classics like Tecmo Bowl, NFL Blitz, and Madden and puts it all on the tabletop.<br/><br/>1UP<br/>And as if that isn&rsquo;t cool enough, it also gives you a feature that gamers have long asked for but never gotten&hellip; until now! What is it you ask? As a coach in TECHNO BOWL, you will design your own formations and plays. That&rsquo;s right. Let me say it again. You get to design your own formations and plays.<br/><br/>And I&rsquo;m not talking about choosing several formation cards, lining up elements on a chart, or utilizing some other abstraction. This is putting the power to effortlessly create real football formations and plays into your hands.<br/><br/>ZERO DOWN TIME<br/>Thanks to the BOX SPORTS ENGINE, there is almost zero down time in the game [except for half time and timeouts of course!]. Coaches are constantly involved, and the on-field players are always interacting with one another as skill checks and ever evolving plays result in: free actions, reactions, read-and-reacts, and offensive and defensive adjustments. Add to that real world timers for setting up formations and selecting plays, and you have a truly dynamic fast-paced tabletop football experience.<br/><br/>UNPARALLELED FOOTBALL GAMEPLAY<br/>TECHNO BOWL delivers that authentic football feel like no game before it. Establish the running game by punching it in between the tackles or tossing it to a back for an outside sweep. Launch an air offensive while sitting in the pocket or throwing on the run with laser accurate throws directly to the receiver or exciting route passes where you lead the receiver in hopes of beating the coverage. Defense can run man, zone, and mixed defensive packages and bring the blitz. Oh, can it bring the blitz!<br/><br/>No matter which strategy you choose, the gameplay will look, feel, and flow like a real football play.<br/><br/>OPTIONS<br/>TECHNO BOWL is all about options, and there&rsquo;s a game mode, team, and play style for everyone. You even have the option to run an option!<br/><br/>MODES<br/>There are five different modes of play. Each of these brings a different experience to the table.<br/><br/>- TECHNO is 7-vs-7 with no skills and no field goals.<br/>- ALL TECHNO is 7-vs-7 with skills but no field goals.<br/>- INFERNO! It&rsquo;s ALL TECHNO with more awesome and fire! [more later]<br/>- PRO is 8-vs-8 with no skills but includes field goal rules.<br/>- ALL PRO is 8-vs-8 with skills and field goal rules.<br/><br/>Each of these modes offers a completely different game experience, and I know what you&rsquo;re thinking. How does adding an extra couple of players to the field [and the ability to kick field goals] equate with an entirely different mode? Trust me. Having that extra player on both sides of the ball quite literally changes everything.<br/><br/>MAD SKILLS<br/>When playing in modes that utilize special skills and abilities, coaches will have access to three types of players:<br/><br/>- IMPACT<br/>- STAR<br/>- SUPERSTAR<br/><br/>These players will come equipped with one or more of the 26 skills found in the game. That count of 26 skills doesn&rsquo;t even include core fundamentals or INFERNO MODE specific skills.<br/><br/>SKILL<br/>Speaking of skills, TECHNO BOWL is a game of skill and not a random &lsquo;dice fest&rsquo;. The 2d6 rolls used for skill checks mean that coaches won&rsquo;t fall prey to straight-line probabilities or random chaos. Winning is about getting the right match and modifiers to deliver a high percentage roll, having a plan when you get an unusually poor result, and knowing the right time to make a high risk roll for a shot at a very high payoff. Of course, your formations, play calling, and player positioning create these opportunities.<br/><br/>PLAYMAKER DIE<br/>The PLAYMAKER die powers some of the special skills in the game like stiff arms and spin moves allowing for sophisticated passive abilities to be triggered without the need for complex rules.<br/><br/>TEAMS<br/>There are 32 teams in the MORE FUN LEAGUE [MFL], and each of these has its own unique play style. This means that you&rsquo;re not just trying to get into the head of the coach that&rsquo;s sitting across the table from you, but that you have to take into consideration the strengths and weaknesses of the players on the specific rosters that you and your opponent are using.<br/><br/>PLAYER SKILL RATINGS<br/>The player skill rating system ensures that coaches and spectators will know how well or poorly a player performs fundamental actions by simply looking at the jersey number! No need to look at charts or extended stat lines. The league skill cap manages team composition so that you are never taxed to remember an insane number of special abilities or which players have them. Coaches get beaten by other coaches and NOT the rules.<br/><br/>Welcome to the More Fun League!<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": ["First edition"], "average": "8.74", "name": "Techno Bowl: Arcade Football Unplugged", "playingtime": "120", "boardgamemechanic": ["Action / Movement Programming", "Dice Rolling", "Grid Movement", "Hand Management", "Simultaneous Action Selection"], "age": "13", "usersrated": "25", "boardgamefamily": ["Admin: Unreleased Games", "Crowdfunding: Kickstarter", "Sports: American Football / Gridiron"], "boardgamepodcastepisode": ["Ep 045 \u2013 Retrospective: Tecmo Bowl", "Ep 046 \u2013 Spookiness abounds with The Bloody Inn", "Ep 049 \u2013 I, Geek talks BGG.Con 2016!", "Episode 13 - Techno Bowl Review And Brent Spivey Interview", "Episode 25 - GenCon Recap!!", "The First Roll - What's New on Kickstarter? - Episode 65: Monday, September 12th"]}, "194924": {"poll": [], "name": "3-4-2", "playingtime": "0", "boardgamecompilation": ["Battleship", "Boxes", "Jotto"], "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": ["Paper-and-Pencil"], "yearpublished": "1977", "usersrated": "0", "maxplayers": "2", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2921549_t.jpg", "average": "0", "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["The Stuart Harvest Collection"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2921549.jpg", "boardgameversion": ["First edition"], "maxplaytime": "0", "boardgamecategory": ["Abstract Strategy", "Word Game"], "age": "0", "minplaytime": "0", "description": "A set of three games for two players (hence the title).

On the board, the playing area is surrounded by a ring of &quot;partial edge hexagons&quot; used for final scoring. The two players (black and white) takes turns to place one stone (in their color) on any un-occupied hex space in the playing area. The goal of the game is to create &quot;stars&quot; - groups of connected stones belonging to one player that touches at least three partial edge hexagons. Each star has a score of the number of partial edge hexagons it touches minus two. The final score of a player is the sum of points for all the stars of that players color. The player with the highest score wins. The sum of the two players score is constant for any particular board.<br/><br/>From Wikipedia:<br/>Star is a two-player abstract strategy board game developed by Craige Schensted (now Ea Ea). It was first published in 1983 in Games magazine. It is a connection game, related to games such as Hex, Y, Havannah, and TwixT. Unlike these games, however, the result is based on a player having a higher final score rather than achieving a specific goal. He has since developed a slightly more complicated version called *Star with better balance between edge and center moves, writing &quot;*Star is what those other games wanted to be.&quot;<br/><br/>"}, "194970": {"rpgdesigner": ["Jeremy Crawford", "Adam Lee", "Christopher Perkins", "Richard Whitters"], "rpgitemversion": ["PDF version"], "poll": [], "name": "Death House", "rpgartist": ["Chuck Lukacs", "Mike Schley", "Emi Tanji", "Richard Whitters"], "rpgproducer": ["Sven Bolen", "Cynda Callaway", "Carmen Cheung", "Jeremy Crawford", "Jefferson Dunlap", "Scott Fitzgerald Gray", "Tracy Hickman", "Laura Hickman", "Kate Irwin", "Kim Mohan", "Shauna Wolf Narciso", "Neil Shinkle", "Richard Whitters"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2921696.png", "usersrated": "2", "rpgsetting": ["Ravenloft"], "average": "6.5", "rpggenre": ["Fantasy (High Fantasy)", "Horror (Supernatural)"], "rpgissuearticle": ["Tavern Tales"], "rpg": ["Dungeons & Dragons (5th Edition)"], "rpgpublisher": ["Wizards of the Coast"], "statistics": [], "rpgcategory": ["Scenario / Adventure / Module"], "rpgseries": ["Curse of Strahd"], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2921696_t.png", "description": "From introduction:<br/><br/>You can run Curse of Strahd for 1st-level characters with the help of this optional mini-adventure, which is designed to advance characters to 3rd level.

This means that each players goal is unique to their perspective of the goal card. After the cards are dealt, each players stands them keeping them secret. Each round consists of checking for matches, and execution of actions until one player claims victory. Players begin with (4) action tokens and lose one for every match. Action tokens replenish at the beginning of each players turn, after their first turn. <br/> Their are two types of actions. The Swap and Switch actions effect your cards, while the Flip and Spin action effect the goal card. This is important because players cannot win on the same turn as manipulating their own cards. This means, in order to win, a player must come into their turn having 4 matching, a winning board state, or have the ability to Flip or Spin the goal card into a winning position. Winning a round grants a VP token.<br/><br/>For more on Parallel please follow @ParallelCG on twitter or check out Parallel.Mozello.Com<br/><br/>"}, "194995": {"rpgdesigner": ["Rob Carlos"], "rpgitemversion": ["PDF Version"], "statistics": [], "name": "The Cliffs of Vad Khara", "rpgartist": ["(Uncredited)"], "rpgproducer": ["Adam D.

Monopoly) game was made in Lithuania when this country was part of the Soviet Union, like the other Baltic states.<br/><br/>Just before the end of Soviet Union, politics became softer and allowed more things from the western culture like this game for example (not actual Monopoly version). Such things became popular among people, but the rule that everything had to be written in Russian remained, that's why this game's Rules are written in Russian.<br/><br/>The yellow lid of the game box only show the &quot;shareholder cards&quot; as well as some of the little &quot;Chance cards&quot;. <br/>Each side of the little game board has 3 company spaces, 1 railwaystation and a &quot;destiny&quot; space (showing a yellow circle with some image).<br/><br/>The 23 spaces on the board are from onwards: <br/>Pepsi-Cola -10%-circle - Marlboro - Kn&iuml;b (Kiev) - Las Vegas - a Jail corner - Philips - policeman in circle - Opel - Alma-Ata - Ford - cowboy on totem pole (Destiny corner) - Parker - sun and cube in circle - Toyota - New York - Asahi - judge corner - Atlantic - sun and cube in circle - Honda - London and Panam.<br/><br/>The instruction on the destiny spaces respectively reads:<br/><br/>     side 1: pay 10% of your funds and put it in the &quot;destiny pool&quot;.<br/>     side 2 with the policeman: pay a fine of 500 and put it in the &quot;pool&quot;.<br/>     side 3 and 4: test your luck by taking a Chance card.  It is remarkable to see that the &quot;Destiny corner&quot; is officially used as the &quot;Free Parking corner&quot; in the unofficial family rules in Parker Brother editions!<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Besides, there is an inner circle in the center of the game board, called Klondike, being an essential part of the game. Klondike can be entered any moment, by paying the Bank 500. Starting point is the pointing hand as in the main part of the game. The Rules for this section are as follows:<br/><br/>     Landing on each of the empty yellow spaces player receives 1000 from the Bank.<br/>     Landing on the space with the gold coin player receives 5000 and the right to return to the main game.<br/>     Landing on the space with the money bag player receives 10000 and the right to return to the main game.<br/>     Landing on the space with the pistol player loses all his money received in Klondike and has no right to leave the Klondike.<br/>     Landing on the space with the black cat player loses all his money received in Klondike and must return one of his most precious shareholder cards to the Bank as well as one of the cheapest he owns, but he still has the right to return to the main game.<br/>     Landing on the space with the pointing hand player must return to the main game with the money he collected in Klondike.<br/>     Philips shareholder card. Instead of property deeds players receive a shareholder card  from the banker the moment they buy shares of a property or station. <br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>How does that work? Let us take the Philips property to explain:<br/>The first share, together with the &quot;shareholders card&quot;  (like a &quot;property deed&quot; in Parker Bros. Monopoly) can be bought for 16 the moment you land on this free space. A next player landing on this space have to pay you 4.<br/><br/>When you are short of cash you can pawn this card with the Bank for 8.<br/><br/>A second share can be bought from the Bank for 160 after which a visitor must pay you 40. The value of this share however is 140. In order to remember how many shares you own on this property you place the blue plastic paperclip on line 2.<br/><br/>In this way one can collect up to 5 shares by finally paying 6400. That moment the value of your total shares is 3200 and any visitor has to pay you 1600 each time he lands on this property. Should you run out of cash you can pawn this card with the Bank for 3200. <br/>There are 18 small (56x69 mm) yellow Chance cards, to be placed on the red dot in the centre of the board.<br/><br/>Some of the instructions on these Chance cards read:<br/><br/>     Konkurentu dovana gangsteriui 1000$ = Player receives 1000 from each other player and he gets the right to throw the dice 3 times. <br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>In addition he is allowed to rob another player, f.e. the moment he lands on a space owned by another player the owner must hand over all profit to this player. <br/><br/>     Nenumatytos pajamos 50% = Player receives 50% of his own properties (stocks and stations) from the Bank.<br/>     Mafija 1000 $ = Player has to proceed to the Destiny corner and pay 1000 fine.<br/>     Air Mail = Player does not move per space but per board side. On doing so he is allowed to land on a space he likes, except on the corner spaces. However, he does receive 200 passing the Start corner.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Black cat = Player must return one of his shareholder cards to the Bank, without the right to redeem it.<br/><br/>The procedure with the stations is somewhat different: When buying a station player has to pay 800 to the Bank and in the same time he receives a hexagonal, plastic chip. The more stations a player owns the bigger profit he gets. The moment another player lands on your station he owes you 200 per station. Should an owner runs out of cash he can, like with the other properties, pawn a station with the Bank for 400 with the opportunity to redeem the station when he has enough money again.<br/><br/>The money consists of rather a number of plastic coins in various colors and diameters. The 11 denominations are: 1 - 2 - 5 - 10 - 20 - 50 - 100 - 500 - 1000 - 5000 and 15000.<br/><br/>"}, "194521": {"poll": [], "name": "The Slaughter: Act One", "videogamemode": ["Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["Windows/Linux download edition"], "average": "0", "videogametheme": ["Detective / Mystery"], "usersrated": "0", "videogamedeveloper": ["Brainchild Studios"], "videogamegenre": ["Adventure"], "videogameplatform": ["Linux", "Windows"], "statistics": [], "videogamepublisher": ["Brainchild Studios", "Owl Cave"], "description": "User Summary<br/><br/>Set in Victorian England, solve the clues to find a serial killer.<br/><br/>"}, "194522": {"poll": [], "name": "Plantera", "videogamemode": ["Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["Windows download edition"], "average": "5.5", "videogametheme": ["Agriculture"], "usersrated": "1", "videogamedeveloper": ["VaragtP Studios"], "videogamegenre": ["Simulation"], "videogameplatform": ["Windows"], "statistics": [], "videogamepublisher": ["VaragtP Studios"], "description": "User Summary<br/><br/>Grow a garden full of plants and harvest the fruit.

The machine in question is one of the Droidz, convenience robots created by man to do menial tasks so that he can go off and relax.  The Droidz don't have much of a brain to speak on, so in order to learn more effectively they have formed a kind of collective intelligence.  Gathered in the holographic Recreation Centre, they are hoarding all the technology they can get their grips on.<br/><br/>You must drive a reconditioned Mk III battle walker into the complex, get back as much of the stolen technology and destroy as many Droidz as you can.<br/><br/>"}}
