Will you direct our heroes on a journey of danger, discovery, and fortune?<br/><br/>From the rules:<br/>The players slip into the roles of three courageous explorers: mineralogy professor Otto Lidenbrock, his nephew Axel and their Icelandic guide Hans Bjelke. You explore the inside of the earth in three stages. You descend down the dormant Icelandic volcano Snaefells. You then cross a turbulent underground sea. Finally, you escape through a volcanic eruption on the Italian island of Stromboli. You make important discoveries by cleverly using equipment like Ruhmkorff's famed induction (electric) lamp, in search of fossils and experiences that will bring you international acclaim. By earning the most fame points you win!<br/><br/><br/>Game Summary<br/>The board has 3 areas: the descent through the mountain, the journey across the lake, and the exit through the volcano (~5 min only). There are 3 explorer tokens (red, yellow, blue) and 2 types of cards: equipment and explorer (players start with equal number, same mix of cards; there are face up cards and face down draw decks). Explorer cards are used to move explorers (3 colors; 1 card = 1 movement pt for that color explorer) while equipment cards modify movement.<br/><br/>In the first 2 parts, on your turn you either take 3 cards (any combination of face up/down explorer/equipment cards) OR move orthogonally; if moving, must advance (1 level deeper in mountain, 1 column further across in lake) at least 1 row/column. Each space costs 1 MP; some cost more (shown as 2 or 3 rocks). Equipment allows you to move diagonally, or get across pits/whirlpools, or make rock-spaces only cost 1 MP, or give you bonus MP. Moving over some spaces gives you a water token. If you end on specific spaces, you may discard a combination of 1-3 equipment cards (pictured on board) to draw as many fossil cards (lamp allows you to draw an extra fossil card to choose from). At the end of the Mountain part, you may keep 3 fossil cards for every water you discard. In the lake phase, all explorers are on 1 raft, so any single color may be used to move the entire raft.<br/><br/>After moving and resolving lake space effects, draw a random event card (may hurt someone or give bonus VP if [un]able to discard specific combo of explorer cards). The player getting the first explorer to the end of the Mountain, or the raft to the end of the Lake, scores bonus 4 VP. In the final Volcano phase, draw random explorer card and move raft to next like-colored space; players must discard cards shown, or pay penalty.<br/><br/>At the end, score VP = sum of values of fossils (various types, sets score higher if you have more parts of the set) + bonus VP + 1 VP/water token. Most VP wins!<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": ["999 Games Dutch edition", "English first edition", "Finnish/Norwegian edition", "German first edition", "Greek First edition", "Hungarian edition", "Polish edition", "Russian edition"], "average": "6.26573", "name": "Journey to the Center of the Earth", "playingtime": "60", "boardgamemechanic": ["Hand Management", "Point to Point Movement", "Set Collection"], "age": "10", "usersrated": "611", "boardgamesubdomain": ["Family Games"], "boardgamefamily": ["Jules Verne's novels", "Kosmos Literature Series"], "boardgamepodcastepisode": ["Journey to the Center of the Earth", "The Spiel #68 - That's A Wrap - 2008 Holiday Gift Guide"]}, "34011": {"boardgamedesigner": ["Alberto Fontana", "Mariano Maresca"], "poll": [], "name": "Capitani di Ventura", "playingtime": "120", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": ["Area Control / Area Influence", "Campaign / Battle Card Driven", "Card Drafting"], "yearpublished": "1963", "usersrated": "8", "boardgamefamily": ["Admin: Better Description Needed!"], "maxplayers": "4", "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic289278_t.jpg", "average": "5.9375", "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["Alma Giochi"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic289278.jpg", "boardgameversion": ["Alma First Edition"], "maxplaytime": "120", "boardgamecategory": ["Medieval"], "age": "0", "minplaytime": "120", "description": "Capitani di Ventura is one of the oldest wargames published in Italy by a mythic Alma Games (1963).

The ground scale is 1 inch equals fifteen yards. There is no specific time scale per turn.<br/><br/>Protz' rules provide a great deal of flavor to the period of Cavaliers and Roundheads. The foot (infantry) regiments, which combine pikemen and musketeers, are arranged in a logical way that allows for easy use of the two types within the same unit. The foot can assume a number of specified &quot;postures&quot; or formations that affect their fighting ability against certain opponents. For example, foot in &quot;close order&quot; or &quot;ring&quot; fight better against opposing horse (cavalry).<br/><br/>The horse also has specified postures, such as the caracole, which is a deep formation intended to attack by firing pistols in successive ranks. Horse also has a unique movement restriction where they must move by one of three speeds: trot, canter, or gallop. The horse must accelerate turn-by-turn to get up to galloping speed. The speed makes a great deal of difference when fighting other horse. The faster troops have the advantage. This is a nice touch and provides a game mechanic for a situation that is often mentioned in accounts of the era.<br/><br/>Some of the game's mechanics are cumbersome. For example, &quot;Giving fire with small arms&quot; requires nine steps; firing artillery requires 10 steps. However, these rules are still very playable.

The published version is a 191-page hardcover book.<br/><br/>The era covered by the rules is vaguely the Seven Years War, generally known as the &quot;Horse and Musket&quot; era. One interesting feature of the game is that rather than strictly portray the historical era, The War Game invites creating fictional armies of the period so players can give their own grandiloquent names to their units and paint them using their own uniform designs.<br/><br/>The scales used for the game are pretty fuzzy. The miniatures are used singly, i.e., not mounted in multiples on a base as in most miniature wargames. An infantry brigade of two regiments is roughly 100 single figures.

For example, the actual rules for moving infantry are very simple, but Grant takes four pages, with a lot of reasoning and reference to historical sources, to come to them.<br/><br/>The War Game is far from concise.

The nature of the war at that time was very fluid and hadn't settled into the static trench warfare that characterized the war in modern memory.<br/><br/>The basic units of the game are the infantry company, cavalry squadron, and half-battery. These basic units are combined into larger units such as battalions, regiments, brigades, and batteries. There are no set scales for distance or time.<br/><br/>Great War uses increment cards that determine how many actions a player can make in their turn. Cards number from one to three. The composition of a card deck varies by nationality, but is always eight cards. Countries rated to have better command control will have more &quot;3s&quot; in their deck and a higher total of increments. The cards are drawn each turn and reshuffled after the deck has been gone through.<br/><br/>Command control is simulated by a commander having to allocate command factors to every unit he wishes to move or fire in the turn. When the game starts, the commander has one command factor available per unit. However, as units lose or win melees, capture key positions, or rout, the command factors will rise and fall so that a commander may be unable to move all his units in a turn. The commander MUST allocate command factors to attempt to unpin any units that have become pinned due to enemy fire.<br/><br/>Firing uses an incremental percentage. A unit has a base percentage value for their fire, which is multiplied by the number of figures firing and then by the number of increments. For example, a rifle company of six figures firing at long range (15&quot;) for two increments has a base factor of 10%, which is multiplied times the figures to get 60%, and then multiplied by the number of increments for a result of 120% or one casualty inflicted and a 20% chance for a second. Cover modifiers may also reduce a unit's fire. For example, if the target of the rifle company's fire had been entrenched, the fire would be reduced to 1/4 for a result of a 30% chance for a single casualty.<br/><br/>Small arms fire is from unit to unit, but artillery fire uses templates that cover a larger area and may embrace multiple target units, all of which are affected by the fire. Casualties can mount rapidly, especially when artillery fire comes into play.<br/><br/>Infantry, cavalry, artillery--and machine guns--are the dominant arms in Great War, but early armored vehicles, such as armored cars, were on hand and are included in the game.<br/><br/>Great War includes organization charts for all the countries of 1914 along with guidelines for basing figures and models.<br/><br/>The game plays quickly even with a large number of units per side. There is enough &quot;flavor&quot; to make the rules engaging without so much detail that one feels bogged down in minutiae.<br/><br/>"}, "34035": {"boardgamedesigner": ["(Uncredited)"], "statistics": [], "name": "Jubilee", "playingtime": "0", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": ["Tile Placement"], "yearpublished": "1954", "usersrated": "0", "maxplayers": "4", "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic745621_t.jpg", "average": "0", "boardgamepublisher": ["Cadaco"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic745621.jpg", "boardgameversion": ["Cadaco-Ellis Edition"], "maxplaytime": "0", "poll": [], "age": "0", "minplaytime": "0", "description": "A game with red and blue numbered tiles.

Punters bet on which area the red side will end up facing.<br/><br/>The person operating the game puts the Poh into the Poh Kam, leaving a bit of room for the Poh to be rattled around inside. It then settles into the smaller part of the metal container and the Poh Kam is closed all the way. The whole block is then spun. When it comes to rest, the block is placed in the centre of the diagram so that each side lines up with one of the 4 areas. The cover is lifted and the red side will be facing one of the 4 areas - punters who bet in that area win their bet.<br/><br/>The game is described in C.T. Dobree's book, Gambling Games of Malaya (q.v.) and it mentions that the name of the game in Kelantan is 'Ewok'. There's also a description of how operators of the game could cheat at it.<br/><br/><br/>The game is also described in Stewart Culin's book &quot;Chinese Games with Dice and Dominoes&quot; on pages 507-508. He writes:<br/><br/>The po tsz', or covered die, is not, properly, a die game at all.  It consists of a small wooden cube, which is placed in a square receptacle in the top of a brass prism, over which a brass cover fits very closely.  A specimen exhibited by His Highness, the Sultan of Johore in the section of games at the Columbian Exposition consisted of a wooden cube about one-half an inch square, having one-half of each face painted red and one-half white.  The prism in which the cube fitted was slightly convex on the bottom, and, when placed upon a smooth surface, could be twirled rapidly.  The game is played by placing the box containing the po in the center of a square crossed by diagonal lines, which is drawn upon a mat.  One of the four divisions of the square is painted red.  One of the four divisions of the square is painted red.  The players lay their bets upon the other divisions and the box is spun rapidly by the gamekeeper, who repeats the operation until it comes to rest squarely with the corners corresponding with the indersecting lines.  The cover is then lifted, and those who have staked opposite the red side of the die win.  The banker wins when the red side comes opposite the side of the square painted red.  There is said to be a current notion, amounting to a superstition among the Chinese in Johore, that if a player stops the box as it is spinning the luck will surely go against him.<br/><br/>Another specimen in the Sultan's collection, called at Johore, kong poh (Chinese t'ung po), &quot;current treasure,&quot; furnishes an explanation of the name po.  It consists of a wooden die, with a face 1 3/8 inches square, and three-forths inch thick, which fits into a brass box with a broad base.  A wooden cover fits over the box.  This die is not spun, but is concealed in a bag which accompanies it, and there adjusted by the gamekeeper.  The face of the wooden die is carved with the characters t'ung po, on one side in the ordinary, and on the reverse in seal characters, the character t'ung being painted red, and po white.  The inscription t'ung po &quot;current treasure,&quot; occurs on the face of all modern Chinese coins, and the common name of the game is evidently derived from the character po, which occurs on this block.<br/><br/>It should be noted that when Culin refers to &quot;po tsz'&quot; he most likely means &quot;t&oacute;u zi&quot; (\u9ab0\u5b50) which is usually translated as just &quot;dice&quot; and not &quot;covered die.&quot;  When he refers to the die with the characters &quot;t'ung po&quot; written upon it, he is refering to t\u014dng b\u01ceo (\u901a\u5bf6) which means &quot;open treasure&quot; not &quot;current treasure.&quot;<br/><br/>"}, "34072": {"boardgamedesigner": ["Nad\u00e8ge Morelle", "Laurent Morelle"], "poll": [], "name": "Hollywood Casting", "playingtime": "15", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": ["Auction/Bidding", "Dice Rolling", "Pattern Building"], "yearpublished": "2007", "usersrated": "8", "maxplayers": "6", "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic348533_t.jpg", "average": "2.5", "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["Isimat"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic348533.jpg", "boardgameversion": ["First edition"], "maxplaytime": "15", "boardgamecategory": ["Humor", "Puzzle"], "age": "0", "minplaytime": "15", "description": "'Hollywood Casting' is a face building game.

Then the winner of the hand plays the first card, and so on.<br/><br/>If more than one Lettro card is played in a round, the last player to play a Lettro card wins the hand. When a player plays a Lettro card, he or she can change the trump immediately, but players who have not yet completed<br/>the round must play cards of the colour originally requested. After all the cards have been played, enter each player&rsquo;s number of hands won.

After a brief period of confusion, three factions began to emerge to fill the vacuum left by Caesar&rsquo;s death.  The Tyrannicides led by Marcus Junius Brutus and assisted by Gaius Cassius Longinus left Rome and took provinces in the East to govern, there to bide their time, gather strength, and hopefully complete the restoration of the Republic.  A second faction under Marcus Antonius, Senior Consul and Caesar&rsquo;s chief lieutenant, and supported by Marcus Aemilius Lepidus, initially attempted to come to an accommodation with the Tyrannicides with the intent securing a power-base in Cisalpine Gaul and subsequently to seize control in Rome.  The third faction under Gaius Octavius, Caesar&rsquo;s nephew and adopted son, was intent upon claiming his inheritance and assuming the position that was Caesar&rsquo;s in the state.  Initially making common cause with Decimus Brutus (a tyrannicide) and the Senate, he attempted to check Antony&rsquo;s ambitions whilst pursuing a dual agenda of avenging Caesar and assuming primacy in the state.  By 30BC, Octavius (later Augustus Caesar) had eliminated all competition and become the undisputed Leader of Rome.<br/><br/>Ides of March is a three-player simulation representing the end of the Roman Republic, with each faction vying for control of the state through both political and military means.  As the Leader of one of the three major factions, you control the Leaders, forces, and political resources of your faction in a struggle to win personal control of the machinery of state and thus become &ldquo;Princeps&rdquo;, or undeclared Emperor of the Roman World.  Rules to play the game with two-players are found at the end of this rulebook.<br/><br/>A shorter Rubicon Module simulates the earlier struggle between Julius Caesar and Pompey the Great who was backed by the Senate that ultimately led to Caesar&rsquo;s victory and assumption of the position of Dictator-for-Life.  Each separate game shares a common set of Strategy Cards, with cards specific to period of civil war added the common deck for the play of that module.

But before their Train cards can be used, players must face the risk of &quot;train robbing,&quot; where another player may force them to lose their hard-earned cards.<br/><br/>Contains 96 illustrated train car cards, 46 destination tickets, 6 big city prize cards, and a rulebook.<br/><br/>Part of the Ticket to Ride series.<br/><br/>To begin the game, each player is dealt train car cards and destination ticket cards.  All these cards are kept secret from the other players until played or scored.  Each player may keep all his ticket cards, just one or any number in between.  A player's turn has two parts: first the player moves face up train car cards from his Railyard to his face down, On-the-Track stack; second the player may perform one of the following actions: 1) draw more train car cards, 2) place train car cards in his Railyard, or 3) draw destination tickets.  Like the original Ticket to Ride board game, when a player chooses to draw train car cards, he may choose from the five face up cards or draw from the top of the face down deck.  When placing cards in the Railyard, a player may place two or more cards of the same color including locomotives which are wild, or three cards, each of a different color.  Also when placing cards in the Railyard, a player may not play cards of the same color as those currently present in his Railyard nor of the same color as those present in any opponent's Railyard unless he plays more of that color than are present in the opponent's Railyard.  If the player plays more, then the opponent must discard his cards of that color.  This is called &quot;Train robbing.&quot;  When drawing destination tickets, a player draws four and may keep any number of them including none.<br/><br/>When the train car card deck is exhausted in a two or three player game, each player gets one more turn and the game ends.  In a four player game, completed tickets are scored and discarded train car cards are reshuffled into a new draw deck.  When that deck is exhausted, each player gets one more turn and the game ends.  At the end of the game all tickets not previously scored are scored.  The point values of completed tickets are added to a players score while those of tickets not completed are subtracted.  To complete tickets, players match train car cards in their On-the-Track stack by color and quantity with their tickets.  Each big city bonus is awarded to the player with the most completed tickets having that city.  These bonus points are added to the player's score.  The player scoring the most total points wins.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": ["Days of Wonder First International Edition", "Finnish first edition", "French edition", "German Version", "Scandinavian edition", "Second Multilingual edition", "Spanish edition", "Third Multilingual edition"], "average": "6.193", "name": "Ticket to Ride: The Card Game", "playingtime": "30", "boardgamemechanic": ["Hand Management", "Memory", "Set Collection"], "age": "8", "usersrated": "3461", "boardgamesubdomain": ["Family Games"], "boardgamefamily": ["Ticket to Ride"], "boardgamepodcastepisode": ["BGB Volume 53 - Session Reviews: Ticket To Ride: The Card Game, Say Anything, and Pizza Box Baseball", "Episode 21: Ticket to Ride: The Card Game", "I've Been Diced! episode 11: How many sessions before judgment?"]}, "34128": {"boardgamedesigner": ["Merle Robbins"], "poll": [], "name": "UNO: Polly Pocket", "playingtime": "20", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": ["Hand Management"], "yearpublished": "2006", "usersrated": "4", "boardgamefamily": ["Doll Games", "Polly Pocket", "UNO"], "maxplayers": "10", "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic291929_t.jpg", "average": "4.75", "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["Mattel"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic291929.jpg", "boardgameversion": ["Mattel Five Language Edition", "Mattel four-language edition 2006"], "maxplaytime": "20", "boardgamecategory": ["Card Game", "Children's Game"], "age": "7", "minplaytime": "20", "description": "The usual UNO rules - Players race to empty their hands and catch opposing players with cards left in theirs, which score points.

The number of routes that a player may move a market over during a delivery is limited by the player's proas (boats, maximum 7).<br/><br/>By delivering markets through islands where they have network presence players will receive fish or shells. Fish and shells may be used to gain an additional explorer, to acquire more proas or kahunas, to bid for turn order, to claim explored routes and to make and enhance kula items. Kula items are gifts that may be given to other players in order to gain prestige (but give the recipient points).<br/><br/>Fish rot quickly and are lost if not spent quickly enough. Shells rot more slowly and kula items decay. Kula items can be enhanced with fish or shells to increase their value when given.<br/><br/>The game ends when all of one colour of market has been delivered, a player reaches 33 prestige or the players reach deadlock. The player(s) with the lowest prestige score are eliminated from the game and do not score. The remaining players receive additional points for their prestige scores. The highest score wins.<br/><br/>Ohana Proa supports 3 through 5 players, is particularly recommended for 4 players and plays in around 150 minutes.<br/><br/>"}, "34147": {"boardgamedesigner": ["Frank Stark"], "poll": [], "name": "Knabberbande", "playingtime": "30", "minplayers": "3", "boardgamemechanic": ["Trick-taking"], "yearpublished": "2005", "usersrated": "1", "boardgamefamily": ["Tolle Kleine"], "maxplayers": "4", "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic300111_t.jpg", "average": "3", "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["Heidelberger Spieleverlag"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic300111.jpg", "boardgameversion": ["First edition"], "maxplaytime": "30", "boardgamecategory": ["Card Game"], "age": "0", "minplaytime": "30", "description": "A trick-taking little game with prickly kakties, carrots-greedy hare-robbers and silly hens!<br/><br/>"}, "34148": {"boardgamedesigner": ["(Uncredited)"], "average": "3", "poll": [], "name": "Jan van Haasteren's Verjaardagsspel", "playingtime": "30", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": ["Roll / Spin and Move"], "yearpublished": "2007", "usersrated": "1", "maxplayers": "6", "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic312318_t.jpg", "boardgameartist": ["Jan van Haasteren"], "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["Jumbo"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic312318.jpg", "boardgameversion": ["Dutch First Edition"], "maxplaytime": "30", "boardgamecategory": ["Party Game"], "age": "0", "minplaytime": "30", "description": "This is a simple, family  roll-and-move game to be played on someone's birthday.

The players can expand the size of their water park and victory points can be earned in a number of ways. The most common way is to collect a large number of animals to your park in a variety of species.<br/><br/>The core of the game play is the decision to select another random animal from the draw bag to add to one of the transport trucks or to take a truck in play. Taking a truck requires a player to add the animals on their selected truck to their water zoo.<br/><br/>The catch is that animals need their space and thus different species cannot be placed adjacent to one another, there needs to be a separation. This then leads back to how the players decide to place animals on the trucks as they are drawn. A player cannot afford to create a truck in which one player gets all the animals their park needs, so the aim is to place animals in such a way that a player gets something they want but also take some pain as well.<br/><br/>Aquaretto is a cousin to Zooloretto so there are other cute factors such as allowing animals to breed if a male and a female of a species are acquired, which allows the placement of a baby. There are also coin options that allow a player to do a range of things.<br/><br/>Aquaretto can be played as a stand alone game or used in conjunction with Zooloretto for a mega-game of sorts.<br/><br/>It should be noted that Aquaretto is a slightly more involved experience than Zooloretto, with some more involved options, such as scoring bonuses for acquiring workers that interact with how many fish symbols a player has in their water park.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": ["Abacus Multilingual Edition", "Hungarian edition", "Rio Grande Games edition"], "boardgameintegration": ["Zooloretto", "Zooloretto"], "average": "7.0284", "name": "Aquaretto", "playingtime": "45", "boardgamemechanic": ["Set Collection", "Tile Placement"], "age": "10", "boardgameexpansion": ["Aquaretto: The Training Camp", "Aquaretto: The Trains", "Aquaretto: Three Coworker Tiles", "Zooloretto XXL", "Zooloretto: Goodie-Box", "Zooloretto: Octopus", "Zooloretto: Rio Grande Games Expansion Pack #2", "Zooloretto: The Gorilla", "Zooloretto: The Savings Book", "Zooloretto"], "usersrated": "2248", "boardgamesubdomain": ["Family Games"], "boardgamefamily": ["Coloretto Series"], "boardgamepodcastepisode": ["Episode 25: Aquaretto"]}, "34195": {"image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic475153.jpg", "poll": [], "boardgamedesigner": ["Ken Dunn", "Brian Youse"], "statistics": [], "yearpublished": "2015", "maxplayers": "2", "boardgameartist": ["Nicol\u00e1s Eskubi"], "boardgamepublisher": ["Multi-Man Publishing"], "maxplaytime": "150", "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic475153_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "150", "boardgamecategory": ["Wargame", "World War II"], "description": "Kawaguchi's Gamble: Edson's Ridge is a tactical level Area-Impulse Game.

The game includes 2,000 trivia questions in four categories. Book of Mormon, Bible, Hymns, and Prophets/Prophecy. Categories are chosen by rolling a die (which the game refers to as the &quot;perfect polyhedron.&quot;<br/><br/>In the basic version of the game, players need only collect four touchstones to win.

Realizing from his own family the need for Gospel-based alternatives to the modern world's fast-paced entertainments, the author created Plain &amp; Precious Parts 2000, or 3P2K.<br/><br/>The 1984 version of Celestial Pursuit seemed too difficult and timebound in its adult questions and too complex in its rules to simply be reprinted. 3P2K was therefore created to best serve LDS families in the year 2000 and beyond by emphasizing gospel principles and naturally creating opportunities for doctrinal discussion.<br/><br/>By focusing on four basic areas of Gospel knowledge (Bible, Book of Mormon, Hymns, Prophets &amp; Prophecy), 3P2K simplifies question content and lends timelessness to referenced answers. Specific attention was given to the idea of plain &amp; precious parts of doctrine as the questions were written. Many questions are based on truths learned from the Joseph Smith Translation of the Bible and from footnote references in the LDS Scriptures.

This is determined by the numbers in the upper left corner on the cards. At the start of the game, each category is worth 3 Victory Points. As the game progresses, the values on the Value Board will change and some categories will become worth more or less Victory Points than others. The game is divided into 2 stages: a Donation stage and an Auction stage. During the Donation stage, players acquire free cards according to an established plan.

Scenario 2 covers 1918, with both sides at full strength. Scenario 3 covers the entire campaign from 1917 through 1918.

The 50 Problem Cards and the possible impact that facing these dangers have on the expeditionary teams&rsquo; successful progress through the pyramid, took three years of research alone. As the players will discover, archeological expeditions into pyramids encountered many physical and emotional challenges as the result of the sadistic mind of the pyramid builder, who incorporated deadly traps in order to frustrate and confuse grave robbers.<br/><br/>Three groups are created, each with two competing archeological teams (approximately five players per team). The teams progress through the pyramid by correctly answering Question Cards, selecting a Passage Progress Card and collecting Hieroglyphic Cards, each with a hieroglyphic symbol and the translation of that symbol. Although most of the symbols were created to resemble actual hieroglyphics, the simulated experiences encountered as the players collect, piece together, and correctly translate a real message from a hieroglyphic tablet, is authentic.<br/><br/>The goal of the two competing archeological teams is to travel to each of the three chambers; the Pharaoh&rsquo;s Burial Chamber, the Queen&rsquo;s Burial Chamber and the Great Hall.

In the first phase, players take turns laying tiles with just two curves on them. These are either Y shaped forks, or two bends around opposite corners. If you let your opponent complete their path in this phase, you're doing very badly.<br/><br/>In the second phase, players start over-laying the 2 curve tiles with 3 curve tiles. This makes it much easier to complete a path. When one player does so, the other still has a chance to lay a 3 curve to disrupt the path. But 3 curves only go onto 2 curves. So by clever placement, you can force yourself into a path with two solutions, so your opponent cannot block both at once.<br/><br/>It's a remarkably simple design, but seems wide open with possible techniques. Tiles can always be placed in any orientation. The clever part is that a valid path cannot follow an oblique turn. You go round bends like a train on tracks.

Either have the fewest robbers in your hand and the most points on the table once the final house has been built &ndash; or reveal 5 Robbers at once from your hand, and you have won.<br/><br/>Danger City takes its inspiration from so-called &ldquo;Gated Communities&rdquo; that one may find in plush suburbs of North American (or English?) cities, and the idea that you must either be a very paranoid person to live in one, or have very good reason to want to protect yourself from someone!<br/><br/>We are taken to an idyllic neighbourhood that is in full-blown development &ndash; houses are being built, as well as parks, amenities, services and the like. <br/>But somewhere things go wrong: a gang of robbers have arrived. The neighbourhood takes decisive action and starts to install surveillance systems, to thwart their enemies. But who will win out?<br/><br/>Basic Rules<br/><br/>Players take turns in building the neighbourhood, by playing Neighbourhood cards from their hand onto the table. Each card has a specific value &ndash; a Garage is worth 5 points while a Golf Course is worth 15. Cards circulate round the player from player to player: you draw or play a card and then pass one on face down. Lurking in their midst are a rabble of robbers. Chances are you either want to collect them or get rid of them, but you cannot play them like Neighbourhood cards. If you collect 5 of them, you can reveal them all at once from your hand and win. You have &ldquo;sided with the robbers!&rdquo;<br/><br/>Otherwise the game ends when a specific number of House cards have been played &ndash; twice the number of players. At that point the game stops and the player with the FEWEST robbers in their hand wins. If there is a tie, then Neighbourhood points come into play &ndash; whoever has played down the most points wins.<br/><br/>And that&rsquo;s pretty much it!<br/><br/>Strategy<br/><br/>Essentially the game has been designed so that it is equally likely that the game will be won after the final House card has been played, or via the Robbers. You are as likely to draw House cards as you are Robbers, so either route is viable.<br/><br/>The game hots up as the final few Houses are being built &ndash; no-one wants to be left with a bunch of robbers after the last House card is played, or indeed if you are collecting robbers, you need to make damn sure that you manage to get five of them before the last House Card gets played. So as the game draws to its end, players are frantically trying to lose robbers&hellip;or collect robbers&hellip;or indeed play Neighbourhood cards. But the skillful player will realise that it&rsquo;s not just the final sprint that counts.<br/>    <br/>Obviously you know what card you are receiving from the player on the right and which card you are feeding to the player on the left, so chances are you have a fair idea of where robbers might be amongst your competitors &ndash; and working out who is trying to do what is key. E.g. If you have been receiving a glut of Robbers that suddenly dries up &ndash; that should tell you something. You can also win by playing the turncoat, or looking like you are doing one thing while secretly doing another.<br/><br/>The game is currently only available in mainland Europe, but is set to become available imminently in the UK, retailing at around &pound;7. <br/>See <a target='_blank' href='http://www.isimat.fr' rel='nofollow'>www.isimat.fr</a> or email muellbauer@lycos.com for details<br/><br/>"}, "34394": {"boardgamedesigner": ["(Uncredited)"], "poll": [], "name": "Espa\u00f1a en llamas", "playingtime": "0", "minplayers": "2", "yearpublished": "2008", "usersrated": "1", "boardgamefamily": ["Country: Spain", "Spanish Civil War"], "maxplayers": "2", "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic297842_t.jpg", "average": "4", "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["Revistas Profesionales S.L."], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic297842.jpg", "maxplaytime": "0", "boardgamecategory": ["Civil War", "Miniatures"], "age": "0", "minplaytime": "0", "description": "&quot;Espa&ntilde;a en llamas&quot; is a special issue of Spanish magazine &quot;Wargames, soldados y estrategia&quot;, which also has an English language version called, of course, &quot;Wargames, Soldiers and Strategy&quot;.<br/>The magazine has 138 pages and it adapts the Spanish Civil War to the &quot;Flames of War&quot; miniatures rules system.<br/>The first pages are a historical introduction to the conflict,while the rest has several army lists, scenarios and missions for the game.<br/>The magazine also includes an extra boardgame about the Spanish Civil War too, &quot;El eco de los pasos&quot; (see entry).<br/><br/>"}, "34395": {"image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic393217.jpg", "poll": [], "boardgamedesigner": ["(Uncredited)"], "statistics": [], "yearpublished": "2008", "maxplayers": "6", "age": "8", "boardgamepublisher": ["Alga", "Imagination Games"], "maxplaytime": "30", "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic393217_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "30", "boardgamecategory": ["Educational", "Environmental", "Movies / TV / Radio theme", "Trivia", "Video Game Theme"], "description": "Educational, family-friendly trivia game based on the BBC's blockbuster five-part documentary, Planet Earth.

The offices that players must pass through are: City Council, State Senate, US House of Representitives, Governor of the State and US Senate.<br/><br/>Players may suffer setbacks or gain sudden rewards during the game. Depending if the player answers the question correctly determines if the player moves ahead. In addition, when a player receives a &quot;Republocrat Card&quot;, it may require the player to move ahead or go back as indicated on the card.<br/><br/>Republocrat not only entertains, it challenges and informs those seeking election to the presidency. The 240 United States of America questions will allow people to play the game many, many times and enjoy a new experience each time.<br/><br/>"}, "34421": {"boardgamedesigner": ["Donald J.

Stores are established in spaces on the apple-shaped board, and players manage their inventory by holding onto cards representing goods.  These cards are purchased from warehouse spaces and frequently change hands since a player is obliged to purchase a card whenever he or she lands on an opponent's store.  The maximum price which may be charged for an item depends on the number of floors in a store, so players are constantly expanding their outlets.<br/><br/>The game deals with more than just cash -- every player gets a balance sheet used for tracking bank loans and credit with other players.  Credit limits are determined at the start of the game and affect the length of the game -- a $300 limit is recommended for an hour-long game, while $500 can last two hours or more.  As players reach their credit limits and are unable to pay back their creditors, they go bankrupt and drop out of the game.<br/><br/>In addition to the normal flow of buying and selling, the game features board spaces and cards that spice up gameplay with random events.  There are also some special transportation spaces (taxis and subways) which allow players a little more control over their movement to add variety to the normal rolling and moving.<br/><br/>Big Apple obviously draws a lot of inspiration from Monopoly, but it's not just a retheming -- there are enough differences to make it distinct from its more famous predecessor.<br/><br/>"}, "34422": {"boardgamedesigner": ["Tom Kidd", "Mark Ryberg"], "poll": [], "name": "Gnemo", "playingtime": "20", "minplayers": "2", "yearpublished": "2008", "usersrated": "0", "maxplayers": "6", "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic319258_t.jpg", "average": "0", "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["Bawn Shaunts Design Studio"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic319258.jpg", "maxplaytime": "20", "boardgamecategory": ["Card Game", "Exploration", "Fantasy", "Science Fiction"], "age": "0", "minplaytime": "20", "description": "Gnemo is a card game based on (and featuring) the illustration work of artist Tom Kidd.

The player who first completes his/her three rows wins the game.<br/><br/>Game play<br/>Each player gets 48 number tiles (three sets of numbers 1-16) and arranges them in three horizontal rows from 1 to 16. One player is selected as the caller, shuffles his/her tiles and draws them one by one from a bag. He/she calls the number drawn. Each player takes that number from one of his/her horizontal rows. If it is a 1, he/she can start one of his/her three new main rows. If it is any other number, it has to be placed in an auxiliary column first.<br/><br/>Each player may have up to 5 vertical auxiliary columns of any length. There must not be any gaps (i.e. tiles must be placed directly below one another), and tiles must not be rearranged later. Tiles need not be placed in sequence, but they should be placed in a way that allows for efficient removal to construct the main rows. Tiles may only be taken from the auxiliary columns starting at the bottom (not in the middle or top), and main rows can only be started when a 1 has been called.<br/><br/>Each of the three new rows has to be started with a 1. The tiles have to be placed in correct sequence here. A 3 can only be placed after a 2, and so on. Tiles can be taken from the auxiliary columns (without being called again) as soon as the number at the bottom directly follows one at the end of one of the player&rsquo;s main rows. E.g. if there is a 3 at the end of one of the player&rsquo;s main rows and a 4 at one of his/her auxiliary columns, the 4 may be taken and placed next to the 3 in the main row. Tiles can be taken from the bottom of the auxiliary columns as long as they are in matching sequence.<br/><br/>The player who first completes his/her three rows wins the game.

No one can master the concepts of Feud by playing just a few games, let alone the subtleties.  Once you have played it enough though, you will not only find it enjoyable, but rather simplistic and easy.<br/><br/>To ease new players into the game, a set of Basic Rules is outlined first.  Play several games of Feud with the Basic Rules.  Once you have grasped them soundly, the Advanced Rules will bring the true excitement of Feud to light.  Though we have called them &quot;Advanced&quot; rules, they are just an extension of the Basic Rules, and complete the game's symmetry.  If you find yourself having fun with just the Basic Rules, or Basic Feud, no worries!  Many people enjoy Basic Feud more than Advanced Feud, or True Feud.  But we urge you to try out True Feud if you have enjoyed basic Feud, especially if you like games with higher degrees of skill and lesser degrees of chance.<br/><br/>"}, "34469": {"boardgamedesigner": ["(Uncredited)"], "poll": [], "name": "Bienen-Stich", "playingtime": "30", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": ["Trick-taking"], "yearpublished": "1993", "usersrated": "0", "boardgamefamily": ["Animals: Bees"], "maxplayers": "6", "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic944663_t.jpg", "average": "0", "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["Schmidt Spiele"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic944663.jpg", "boardgameversion": ["First edition"], "maxplaytime": "30", "boardgamecategory": ["Card Game"], "age": "9", "minplaytime": "30", "description": "It is a trick-taking game with 52 honey-bee cards around two rivalling honey bee-colonies.<br/>The player with 1000 points wins the game.<br/><br/>"}, "34470": {"boardgamedesigner": ["(Uncredited)"], "poll": [], "name": "Hessen Reise", "playingtime": "30", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": ["Dice Rolling"], "yearpublished": "2008", "usersrated": "0", "boardgamefamily": ["Country: Germany"], "maxplayers": "4", "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic298969_t.jpg", "average": "0", "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["at regio"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic298969.jpg", "maxplaytime": "30", "boardgamecategory": ["Dice", "Educational"], "age": "0", "minplaytime": "30", "description": "The players travel through the federal state of Hesse, Germany.<br/>They receive one town card which becomes their &quot;home card&quot;.<br/>They get 11 more cards which they have to organize for their travel from town to town.<br/>The destination is the capital Wiesbaden.<br/>The die lets the pawns move.
