Once the cards have been shuffled, the scorekeeper deals 3 cards face down to each player, along with an equal number of white dice, called a stash. The scorekeeper places the remaining cards face down off to one side of the table to form a deck.<br/><br/>The scorekeeper begins the game by rolling two dice (1 black &amp; 1 white) in the center of the table. If no one scores, play rotates clockwise to the next player who rolls two dice. Any two die, including the black die can be rolled (see below). Before each roll players examine their cards to see what dice combinations will be needed to match a card in their hand.<br/><br/>Two white dice from your stash, or. <br/>One die from your stash, and one (previously rolled) die from the table, or<br/>Two (previously rolled) dice from the table.<br/><br/>Player&rsquo;s take turns rolling until someone shouts STRUT! indicating a player believes they have won the round. A round is won when you match a card in your hand with a dice combination on the table. Let&rsquo;s say you have a 4 of a Kind (card) in your hand. There are 8 dice on the table 1,3,4,6 and four 5&rsquo;s: 5, 5, 5. You quickly shout Strut! believing your dice combination (four 5&rsquo;s) matches the card (4 of a Kind) in your hand, thus winning the round. But have you? You have if one of your 5&rsquo;s is the black die. The black die must always be part of the score.<br/><br/>Keeping score is very simple. All dice on the table are scored. The black die counts face value [1]=1 point, [2]= 2 points [3]=3 points, etc. White dice count 1 point each. In the example above, you scored a total of 12 points (5 points for the black die and 7 points for the white dice.)<br/><br/>After each round the winner&rsquo;s points are totaled by the scorekeeper. After the scorekeeper has recorded the points, the winner discards his/her winning card, placing it &ldquo;face up&rdquo; under the deck. If the winner&rsquo;s accumulated score totals less than 30 points then he/she must draw one new card from the deck. If the winner has accumulated 30 or more points, no card is drawn allowing that player to begin ridding his/her hand of cards in an attempt to win the game. (Re-Action cards are an exception to the &ldquo;30 points&rdquo; rule.) All other players keep their cards. Dice on the table are evenly redistributed. Note: As you will see as the game progresses, tactics and strategies become a big part of each round.<br/><br/>The winner begins the next round by rolling 1 black and 1 white die. Play continues until someone shouts Strut! The first player to accumulate 30 or more points with no cards remaining in their hand wins the game.<br/><br/>The Black Rooster<br/><br/>If an opponent throws the Black Rooster card down on your winning card, it spells disaster! You must turn in all the cards in your hand, and draw 3 replacements. Plus, you lose all your accumulated points.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": ["First edition"], "age": "0", "name": "Strut!", "playingtime": "0", "boardgamemechanic": ["Dice Rolling"], "average": "6.61524", "usersrated": "82", "boardgamefamily": ["Animals: Chickens", "Crowdfunding: Kickstarter"]}, "32821": {"boardgamedesigner": ["Robert M.

Even if the player does not know the definition of the word, he must bluff one that will be the most believable.  All sheets are then turned over to the dictionary holder so that he can number them and mix them up. Then he will read each definition out loud. He is allowed to repeat them up to 3 times.

Numerous scenarios are included to play out various smaller battles in Normandy. It is intended for two players or player teams.<br/><br/>The game uses a unique sequence of play and a system of fire combat throughout the airdrop and beach assault phases with company-level breakdown units, then a more traditional odds-type combat approach throughout the rest of the game. Initial beach defense deployments at start and daily air support and defense allocations, hidden to the opposing player; create a level of uncertainty that makes for a tense, challenging duel.<br/><br/>The game combines a detailed, extensively researched order of battle with relatively fast-playing game mechanics to make it not only the largest representation of the Normandy campaign available to date, but a manageable one that is meant to be played, not shelved. Scenarios include &lsquo;Bloody Omaha&rsquo;, &lsquo;Operation Epsom&rsquo;, &lsquo;Cobra&rsquo;, &lsquo;The Fight for Cherbourg&rsquo; and more.<br/><br/>A future expansion will extend the play area south, to include the Mortain and Falaise scenarios, and extend the campaign to late August and the 3rd Army breakout.<br/><br/>Game Equipment: <br/><br/>     One Rule Book <br/>     One Scenario Book <br/>     Five (5) 22x34&rdquo; full color Maps <br/>     Nine (9) full color counter sheets <br/>     8-1/2x11&rdquo; Allied Air Allocation Log (laminated) <br/>     8-1/2x11&rdquo; Axis AAA Allocation Log (laminated) <br/>     11x17&rdquo; Turn Record Track <br/>     8-1/2x11&rdquo; Terrain Effects Chart (x2) <br/>     8-1/2x11&rdquo; Repl/Recon/Weather chart (x2) <br/>     8-1/2x11&rdquo; German Record Track <br/>     8-1/2x11&rdquo; Allied Record Track <br/>     8-1/2x11&rdquo; Combat Results Table (x2) <br/>     Dice - 3d6 and 1d10 <br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": ["English first edition"], "average": "7.82672", "name": "The Battle for Normandy", "playingtime": "240", "boardgamemechanic": ["Dice Rolling", "Hex-and-Counter", "Simulation"], "age": "0", "boardgameexpansion": ["84503"], "usersrated": "262", "boardgamesubdomain": ["Wargames"], "boardgamefamily": ["Country: France"]}, "32839": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic476556.jpg", "poll": [], "boardgamedesigner": ["Anja Wrede"], "statistics": [], "yearpublished": "2007", "maxplayers": "4", "age": "5", "boardgamepublisher": ["Tactic"], "maxplaytime": "20", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic476556_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "20", "boardgamecategory": ["Animals", "Children's Game"], "description": "Each player has a squirrel with a wheelbarrow, trying to get to the island and pick up nuts that match his cards.

Included in this report, would be your choices for Group Unit Mix, Flag Carrier to bear you into battle, and suitable Battle group deployments for each one of your battle groups.  A good commander knows that this initial planning may hold the key to victory and will ensure that a comprehensive strategy and matching Battle group deployments are well set out into a workable plan on paper, well before any ship even begins to leave the harbor.<br/><br/>Having done the initial planning, you are now ready to set sail with your battle groups and put your strategic battle plan into action.  Moving your fleets out into the open ocean, you plot the moves of your Fleet Deployments onto your War Chart, watching as events unfold.  These first few moves will be crucial in determining the overall battle positions of your fleets as you head towards enemy waters.  Do you move your fleets in a broad front, or concentrate them into a narrow wedge, aimed straight for the enemy&rsquo;s heart?  How would the enemy be deployed?  What is his plan?  These are questions you must ask yourself as Admiral.  Decide well, and surprise is on your side.  Decide poorly, and risk losing the initiative to a craftier enemy.<br/><br/>With your fleets in position, you now steam steadily towards the enemy.  The War Chart now shows the radial tracks from your scouts.  But where is the enemy?  As the gap between friend and foe narrow, a race develops to see who will be the first to spot the other.  Will luck be on your side, or will you fail to send out your scouts in a well-planned search pattern and allow enemy bombers to slip through to your vulnerable Carriers?  These are questions only you can answer as you sit and wait for the search reports to trickle in.<br/><br/>Suddenly, the enemy is upon you and your picket ships are hit.  As you stare out onto the flight deck from your bridge, what do you do?

The number of squares have been increased to accommodate the slightly larger Chinese chess board. A central row on the Chinese chess side terminates at the &quot;river&quot; to merge into the western chess board. Units playing at the central row interface play as per normal but with a termination at the end of the row.

Wars of today are fought by remote war machines. Pitted against you is your enemy, fielding their latest war machines. This will be a fight to the finish, the struggle for supremacy.<br/><br/>With your superior skills as a commander, you are to programme your tank and set it loose. Win or lose will depend on your intimate knowledge of your own tank's inherent abilities as well as your uncanny reading of what your opponent's tank will do and how you perceive it would react in battle.<br/><br/>Win or lose, after each round, redesign, re-programme, rework your tank's subroutines and primary programming to fine-tune your tank's performance. Remember, your enemy is doing the same thing. He would have watched the previous battle and noted his tank's and your tank's performance. He too will be working to reduce deficiencies and weak points in his own programming so as to triumph over yours. Then when you're both done with your re-programming, set let them go at it again!

There were storms, waterspouts and he fell into tail spins and once had to jump in a parachute.<br/><br/>The moves are made by drawing cards.  There are 105 white cards, each one telling you how many miles to hop Uncle Wiggily through the air.  There are 35 red cards, which may move Uncle Wiggily ahead or perhaps delay hime for a turn or two, all according to luck.<br/><br/>The air path, from Uncle Wiggily's farm to the market is marked by sign boards each containing a letter instead of a number.

The name of the game references the local hand-made flat-bottom wood boats used for fishing in the shallows of the surrounding Caribbean and Atlantic waters.<br/><br/>The play of Pirogue will be challenging play and good fun for gamers who enjoy games such as Tichu, Sticheln, Pinochle, M&uuml; &amp; Mehr, Spades, or Oh Hell!  The game will also be a great companion for sportsmen who want to play a card game which couples concentration and skill with the same sense of anticipation and suspense found in a real big game fishing tournament.<br/><br/>One of the most important things for the first-time Pirogue player to learn is the abilities of the SPECIAL cards.  Each SPECIAL card adds a different and subtle tactical twist to the game.  Some cards even have different strengths depending on whether the card is the lead card in the trick or a following card.<br/><br/>Unique to Pirogue is the HOOK card.  The HOOK card is a unique trick-taking device specific to the game.  The HOOK card addresses the unpredictability and surprise found in sport fishing while adding another level of tactical play.  The HOOK card also assists in removing the predictable run of the table for the strongest of hands because even the lowest SUITED card is a dangerous threat.  Recognizing the strength of a well balanced hand over what may seem like a traditionally strong hand is an important part of understanding Pirogue play and key to successfully making a bid.<br/><br/>Also distinctive to Pirogue is linked play between partnerships and individuals.  In big game fishing tournaments, prizes are awarded for both best boat and best angler.  The game of Pirogue is played in partnerships called Pirogues as well as by individual players called Anglers.  Pirogues and Anglers compete in an intertwined, and sometimes entangled, opposition to win Game Trophies that count towards taking home the ultimate prize: The Trinidad &amp; Tobago Tarpon Tournament Trophy!<br/><br/>"}, "32971": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic274388.jpg", "poll": [], "boardgamedesigner": ["Todd Breitenstein", "Kerry Breitenstein"], "statistics": [], "boardgamecompilation": ["MidEvil Deluxe"], "yearpublished": "2007", "maxplayers": "6", "boardgameartist": ["Dave Aikins"], "boardgamepublisher": ["Twilight Creations, Inc."], "maxplaytime": "60", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic274388_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "60", "boardgamecategory": ["Adventure", "Dice", "Expansion for Base-game", "Fantasy", "Fighting", "Horror", "Racing"], "description": "The castle is nice but, let's face it, the entertainment options are limited.

Acting simultaneously with his neighbor both hide a certain number of sticks in their hands, then open their hands and count up the total amount.  Players may move if both hands show different numbers of sticks and the total amount does not equal 5; if you end on a loot slide check it (value 0 - 4) &amp; keep it.  If a player lands on another player, it offers you an opportunity to steal.  If the stick-count equals 5 players add a barrier, and an equal number of sticks held by each player forces them back to the starting point, and they draw an event card.<br/><br/>"}, "32621": {"boardgamedesigner": ["(Uncredited)"], "poll": [], "name": "Annex", "playingtime": "45", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": ["Tile Placement"], "yearpublished": "1986", "usersrated": "1", "maxplayers": "4", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2316252_t.jpg", "average": "7", "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["Sterling Games, Inc."], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2316252.jpg", "maxplaytime": "45", "boardgamecategory": ["Word Game"], "age": "0", "minplaytime": "45", "description": "The game comes with 132 letter tiles in four colors, three 'wild' tiles, and a board that consists of interlocking paths.

Your goal is to take your nation from humble beginnings to the status of a world economic superpower.  You achieve this by building Industries, which allows you to produce Commodities.  There are six types of Industry tiles:  Farms, Generators, Academies, Mines, Factories, and Banks.  Each Industry is capable of producing a certain type of Commodity:  Food, Energy, Labor, Ore, and Capital (respectively).<br/><br/>Each Commodity has one or more uses in the game.  For example, Food is required to &quot;feed&quot; your Industries when they produce, while Capital is used to build certain types of Industries.  As you build Industries, you create ever larger Industrial Blocs.  The larger a Bloc is, the greater your return on investment when the Bloc produces Commodities.<br/><br/>The main focus of the game is trade.  Because it is economically unfeasible to produce every Commodity you need, you must engage in trade to get the Commodities that you require.  Each Commodity has a trade value influenced by the Markets.<br/><br/>There is one Market for each type of Commodity.  If you can't gain a Commodity that you need by trading with your fellow players, you must buy it from the Market.  Buying a Commodity from the Market increases its price, reflecting increased demand.  Similarly, there are times when you can't unload your surplus Commodities because your fellow players have no need for them.  If you wish to earn money from these Commodities, you must sell them to the Market.  Selling a Commodity to the Market decreases its price, reflecting increased supply.<br/><br/>As you build new Industries and earn more money, you acquire Victory Points.

This is the playable game, professionally developed and packaged, and fun.<br/><br/>Scrimmage was invented by Chuck Eskridge, and David Williams.  It is a football game in which one side controls the offense and the other controls the defense. Movement is accomplished by dice rolls, with slower players have lower maximum movement capability. Each side has pieces (players) of varying strength and speed.  Any player can tackle any other player, but only players of equal or greater strength can block opposing players.  The offense sets up, and then the defense, with a twist: the defense does not know whether the offense is running a passing play or a running play. (The choice is disclosed after the play starts.) If it is a passing play, the pass can be thrown to a designated grid but only after the play has had time to develop.  If a play breaks down, the offensive player draws a card to determine whether he can recover.<br/><br/>The passing mechanism works wonderfully: the offense places two men downfield in one of several grids, and secretly chooses a card identifying the grid to which the pass will be made. Each team then moves players (including the potential receivers) with the roll of the dice. When the pass is made, the offense chooses which square in the grid the pass will go to. The choice of squares determines how easy it is for the receiver and the defensive back(s) to get to the square to which the pass is made: if the receiver gets to the square and the back does not, the pass is complete.  If the back gets to the square and the receiver does not, the pass is intercepted.  If both get to the square, the pass is incomplete.<br/><br/>The running game and the pass rush depend on the the success of the blockers and the defensive line.  There is luck in the dice rolls, of course, but the luck evens out over the course of the game and a good play can survive a little bad luck.  Card drawing can also be important. Sometimes tacklers reach the ball carrier but fail to make the tackle, or make the tackle and force a fumble, which can be recovered by either the offense of defense.<br/><br/>This is one of the few games non-simulation football games (i.e., not strat-o-matic football or its cousins) that really feels like you are playing football.  You choose your play in advance, and, like real football, sometimes it works as planned, sometimes it fails, and sometimes you have to improvise during the course of the play.<br/><br/>Only about 800 copies of the game were sold, primarily in game stores in the South.  Two versions were created, the original version and a second version that included an optional &quot;monster man&quot; with good speed and power.<br/><br/>"}, "32668": {"boardgamedesigner": ["Tom Varley"], "poll": [], "name": "Hypercube Hop", "playingtime": "10", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": ["Point to Point Movement"], "yearpublished": "2007", "usersrated": "1", "boardgamesubdomain": ["Abstract Games"], "maxplayers": "6", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic308148_t.jpg", "average": "5.75", "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["Brane Games"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic308148.jpg", "maxplaytime": "10", "boardgamecategory": ["Abstract Strategy"], "age": "0", "minplaytime": "10", "description": "Hypercube Hop is the first game from Brane Games. 2-6 players each take turns to move their individual wooden pieces one step around a flat representation of a four-dimensional space, collecting small stones as they pass over them.

The air units have unlimited range and the number required to make an attack is based on the target.  Losses are also based on the target and are automatic (for example it takes 4 air units to attack a naval formation and 2 air units are automatically lost).<br/><br/>A merchant ship can join a naval formation and create a convoy for more protection.

Far off to the west a great unknown wilderness was opening up. North America was being conquered and empires were being built.  Today in the game Conquest we re-enact the conquering of the continent.<br/><br/>It is a game in which keen judgement interspersed with dashes of bluff and audacity mingle with lady luck to create a game that on one is out of until the last hand is played.<br/><br/>The purpose of the game is to conquer as many of the 50 states shown as possible.  States must be conquered in the order listed under &quot;Order of Conquest&quot; shown on the game board and are also one of either four colors and have a number associated with victory points at the end of the game.<br/><br/>There are four phases to the game - 1) Bidding your hand, 2)Marking of conquered territory and distribution of groups, 3)Dealing new cards, 4) Additional conquest.<br/><br/>In the bidding phase, players bid on their hand of five cards. First player is to the right of the dealer and then in subsequent hands, the winner of the previous hand starts the bid.  Starting player places a bid.  Bids cannot be higher than $5 million.  The remaining players can either pass, meet the bid or raise the bid.  Winning hands are determined in order of winning hierarchy: Single: Highest single card of color called for; Doubles: Two matching number cards, one in the color being called; Triples: Three matching number cards, one in the color being called; Sweep: All four cards of the same number.<br/><br/>In the second phase, the winner of the hand takes all money bid and places one of their markers on the state or states conquered, receiving the number of regiments of troops as indicated on the conquered state.  5 regiments = 1 division.  Only divisions can be placed on the maps in any territories the players owns. Players may redistribute any troops that he possesses for the purposes of defense or offense. Players can also purchase additional troops.<br/><br/>In the third phase, the dealers asks if everyone is ready for the deal.  The dealer hands out enough cards to bring all players hands up to five cards. If a player receives a money card they can immediately turn the card in to collect the cash and gets another card.<br/><br/>In the final phase, players may conquer states of their opponents. Starting with the player who won the last hand states can be conquered via the following rules: 1)State must adjoin the territory of conqueror and belong to an opponent 2) Must have more troop divisions that place being conquered 3) Player must pay bank sum of 10 million plus 5 million for every divsion that opponent has in the conquered territory (Max 40 million) 4) Only one state can be conquered per hand 5) Conquered troops are returned to opponent and 6) if conquests results in a complete territory being possessed than additional troops are obtained for the district.<br/><br/>To conclude the game: After all states have been conquered there is a final phase of general conquest until no one has any resources left to conquer with.  The winner is the player having the highest score by totaling the victory points associated with the states conquered.<br/><br/>"}, "32696": {"boardgamedesigner": ["(Uncredited)"], "poll": [], "name": "GHQ", "playingtime": "0", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": ["Point to Point Movement", "Roll / Spin and Move"], "yearpublished": "1940", "usersrated": "3", "boardgamesubdomain": ["Wargames"], "maxplayers": "2", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1870651_t.jpg", "average": "6", "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["John Waddington Ltd."], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1870651.jpg", "boardgameversion": ["John Waddington first edition"], "maxplaytime": "0", "boardgamecategory": ["Wargame", "World War II"], "age": "0", "minplaytime": "0", "description": "From the rules:  G.H.Q. is a Strategic war game for two players, one player representing the Allied Armies and the other the German Army.

Towns with black centers are Corps garrison towns and the associated units are marked on the map.  The units (armoured, motorized and infantry corp) are represented by different shaped wooden pieces with Flags attached.<br/><br/>The Germans always go first and movement is governed by a roll of the dice.  The roll will be between 1 and 3 and the number thrown indicates the number of units which may be moved.  Armoured corps can move 3 spaces, Motorized 2 and Infantry 1 space.  Destruction of units is based on having units adjacent to the target enemy, 3 friendly units are required to kill an armoured unit, infantry and motorized are destroyed by two friendly units in adjacent towns.

At the beginning of the game players pick one of the six great countries as their home country.  They get one Diplomat, 10 consulates, 5 soldiers, 1 bomber and 1 battleship.  The battleship and bomber are placed on the home country flag and all the diplomats are placed on &quot;Start&quot;.<br/><br/>The mechanic of the game consists of movement around the path of flags via the roll of dice (doubles get a second roll). When a player lands on a colony he places a soldier, a second landing on the same colony gains a consulate and the Country Flag card.  Landing on an independent country gains an immediate colony.  Soldiers can be captured if another player lands on a colony before a consulate is placed.  Players can move across the Bridge of Flags if they land on one of the two Neutral Countries, doing so gains the player a battleship or bomber.  The battleship or bomber can be used to gain a strategic location flag if he owned when he lands on a strategic location. Normally players can only move clockwise but control of a strategic location allows the player to move either direction when he lands on one.  Additional game play is added via card play introduced by landing on an &quot;Isolation&quot; spot.<br/><br/>The game ends when one player has placed 10 consulates.
