Once the cards have been shuffled, the scorekeeper deals 3 cards face down to each player, along with an equal number of white dice, called a stash. The scorekeeper places the remaining cards face down off to one side of the table to form a deck.<br/><br/>The scorekeeper begins the game by rolling two dice (1 black &amp; 1 white) in the center of the table. If no one scores, play rotates clockwise to the next player who rolls two dice. Any two die, including the black die can be rolled (see below). Before each roll players examine their cards to see what dice combinations will be needed to match a card in their hand.<br/><br/>Two white dice from your stash, or. <br/>One die from your stash, and one (previously rolled) die from the table, or<br/>Two (previously rolled) dice from the table.<br/><br/>Player&rsquo;s take turns rolling until someone shouts STRUT! indicating a player believes they have won the round. A round is won when you match a card in your hand with a dice combination on the table. Let&rsquo;s say you have a 4 of a Kind (card) in your hand. There are 8 dice on the table 1,3,4,6 and four 5&rsquo;s: 5, 5, 5. You quickly shout Strut! believing your dice combination (four 5&rsquo;s) matches the card (4 of a Kind) in your hand, thus winning the round. But have you? You have if one of your 5&rsquo;s is the black die. The black die must always be part of the score.<br/><br/>Keeping score is very simple. All dice on the table are scored. The black die counts face value [1]=1 point, [2]= 2 points [3]=3 points, etc. White dice count 1 point each. In the example above, you scored a total of 12 points (5 points for the black die and 7 points for the white dice.)<br/><br/>After each round the winner&rsquo;s points are totaled by the scorekeeper. After the scorekeeper has recorded the points, the winner discards his/her winning card, placing it &ldquo;face up&rdquo; under the deck. If the winner&rsquo;s accumulated score totals less than 30 points then he/she must draw one new card from the deck. If the winner has accumulated 30 or more points, no card is drawn allowing that player to begin ridding his/her hand of cards in an attempt to win the game. (Re-Action cards are an exception to the &ldquo;30 points&rdquo; rule.) All other players keep their cards. Dice on the table are evenly redistributed. Note: As you will see as the game progresses, tactics and strategies become a big part of each round.<br/><br/>The winner begins the next round by rolling 1 black and 1 white die. Play continues until someone shouts Strut! The first player to accumulate 30 or more points with no cards remaining in their hand wins the game.<br/><br/>The Black Rooster<br/><br/>If an opponent throws the Black Rooster card down on your winning card, it spells disaster! You must turn in all the cards in your hand, and draw 3 replacements. Plus, you lose all your accumulated points.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": {"205954": "First edition"}, "age": "0", "name": "Strut!", "playingtime": "0", "boardgamemechanic": {"2072": "Dice Rolling"}, "average": "6.59353", "usersrated": "85", "boardgamefamily": {"7535": "Animals: Chickens"}}, "32821": {"boardgamedesigner": {"9632": {"name": "Robert M.

Initial beach defense deployments at start and daily air support and defense allocations, hidden to the opposing player; create a level of uncertainty that makes for a tense, challenging duel.<br/><br/>The game combines a detailed, extensively researched order of battle with relatively fast-playing game mechanics to make it not only the largest representation of the Normandy campaign available to date, but a manageable one that is meant to be played, not shelved.

Should you seek the enemy fleet before he strikes?  Should you push ahead with plans to land marines and take the strategic Pacific islands?  Or should you take the war to the enemy and attempt to sneak in a lightning strike on his now undefended home ports?<br/><br/>These are questions you need to answer as your battlegroup streams out to engage the enemy.  Visibility is only limited to the immediate area around your bases and ships.  You will need to send out spotter planes or submarines to screen your fleet as you race to the be first to find and engage the enemy before he finds you.  Enemy fleets must be found and destroyed, and the Commander with the best intelligence and planning will prevail!<br/><br/><br/>                                                                                                                                <br/>                                                                                                                            <br/>                                                                                                                        <br/>                                                                                                                    <br/>                                                                                                                <br/>                                                                                                            <br/>                                                                                                        <br/>                                                                                                    <br/>                                                                                                <br/>                                                                                            <br/>                                                                                        <br/>                                                                                    <br/>                                                                                <br/>                                                                            <br/>                                                                        <br/>                                                                    <br/>                                                                <br/>                                                            <br/>                                                        <br/>                                                    <br/>                                                <br/>                                            <br/>                                        <br/>                                    <br/>                                <br/>                            <br/>                        <br/>                    <br/>                <br/>            <br/>        <br/>    <br/><br/><br/>You are now in command of one of the most powerful fleets in history.<br/><br/>As Admiral, you will be required to plan and submit a Battle Plan to HQ for the forth-coming battle at Midway.  Included in this report, would be your choices for Group Unit Mix, Flag Carrier to bear you into battle, and suitable Battle group deployments for each one of your battle groups.  A good commander knows that this initial planning may hold the key to victory and will ensure that a comprehensive strategy and matching Battle group deployments are well set out into a workable plan on paper, well before any ship even begins to leave the harbor.<br/><br/>Having done the initial planning, you are now ready to set sail with your battle groups and put your strategic battle plan into action.  Moving your fleets out into the open ocean, you plot the moves of your Fleet Deployments onto your War Chart, watching as events unfold.  These first few moves will be crucial in determining the overall battle positions of your fleets as you head towards enemy waters.  Do you move your fleets in a broad front, or concentrate them into a narrow wedge, aimed straight for the enemy&rsquo;s heart?  How would the enemy be deployed?  What is his plan?  These are questions you must ask yourself as Admiral.  Decide well, and surprise is on your side.  Decide poorly, and risk losing the initiative to a craftier enemy.<br/><br/>With your fleets in position, you now steam steadily towards the enemy.  The War Chart now shows the radial tracks from your scouts.  But where is the enemy?  As the gap between friend and foe narrow, a race develops to see who will be the first to spot the other.  Will luck be on your side, or will you fail to send out your scouts in a well-planned search pattern and allow enemy bombers to slip through to your vulnerable Carriers?  These are questions only you can answer as you sit and wait for the search reports to trickle in.<br/><br/>Suddenly, the enemy is upon you and your picket ships are hit.  As you stare out onto the flight deck from your bridge, what do you do?  Do you circle your wagons and search frantically for the enemy, throwing fighter wings into the air in the hope of slugging it out with the enemy bombers which are sure to follow, or try and scatter your ships to disappear back into the vast empty ocean to regroup?<br/><br/>Should you launch bombers from afar, for that long-range strike into the enemy rear, or go in close for a classic surface naval engagement with your Battleship, Cruisers and Destroyers?<br/><br/>Game Objectives<br/><br/>A win is achieved with any one of the following objectives fulfilled;<br/><br/>1.) Destroy all ground defenders and occupy both Midway Atoll and Wake Island with your Marines<br/><br/>2.) Destroy all ground defenders and occupy all three enemy home ports with your Marines<br/><br/>3.) Sink the enemy Flagship (Carrier or Battleship)<br/><br/>The game ends in a draw if no more Troop transports are still afloat from either team or when the loss of too many units on both sides make it impossible to complete the stated objectives.<br/><br/>"}, "32914": {"boardgamedesigner": {"9664": {"name": "Leong Kit Meng"}}, "poll": {}, "name": "East vs. West (Chess)", "playingtime": "60", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": {"2676": "Grid Movement"}, "yearpublished": "2007", "usersrated": "0", "boardgamesubdomain": {"4666": "Abstract Games"}, "maxplayers": "2", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic268566_t.jpg", "average": "0", "statistics": {}, "boardgamepublisher": {"1001": {"name": "(Web published)"}}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic268566.jpg", "boardgamefamily": {"4024": "Chess Games"}, "maxplaytime": "60", "boardgamecategory": {"1009": {"name": "Abstract Strategy"}}, "age": "0", "minplaytime": "60", "description": "You've all wondered about it.

Now you can play it for yourself to see which side would win.<br/><br/>This game was developed to help cross-understanding of the two different chess systems.<br/><br/>One side plays with the Western Chess pieces, the other with the Chinese Chess pieces.<br/><br/>Due to the differences in western and eastern chess boards, both halves of the board retain the characteristics of each side. The number of squares have been increased to accommodate the slightly larger Chinese chess board. A central row on the Chinese chess side terminates at the &quot;river&quot; to merge into the western chess board. Units playing at the central row interface play as per normal but with a termination at the end of the row. Bishops and Queen moving along the diagonal will side-step across the central row to maintain the same colour of squares.<br/><br/>Because of Eastern initial advantage checkmating with catapults in first move, West starts.<br/><br/>All usual rules apply.<br/><br/><br/>     Western - King - 1 step in any direction<br/>     Eastern - ji&agrave;ng/shuai (General/Marshal) - 1 step in any direction (restricted to within fortress) (Korean Chess Rules)<br/>     Western - Queen - moves diagonally and vertically/horizontally<br/>     Eastern - sh&igrave; (Scholar/Official) - 1 step in any direction (restricted to within fortress) (Korean Chess Rules)<br/>     Western - Bishop - moves diagonally<br/>     Eastern -  xi&agrave;ng (Elephant/Minister) - moves in 2 step diagonals (blocked by a piece along its diagonal) (cannot cross river)<br/>     Western - Knight - moves in 2/1 step &quot;L&quot; (blocked by a piece along the long side of the &quot;L&quot; when in Eastern territory)<br/>     Eastern - ma(Horse/Cavalry) - moves in 2/1 step &quot;L&quot; ( blocked by a piece along the long side of &quot;L&quot; when in Eastern territory)<br/>     Western - Castle - moves vertically/diagonally<br/>     Eastern - ju (Chariot/Wagon) - moves vertically/diagonally<br/>     Eastern - pao (Catapult/Cannon) - moves vertically/horizontally, takes enemy piece by leaping over another piece<br/>     Western - Pawn - 1 step forward, takes enemy piece 1 step diagonally (1 or 2 step opening move)<br/>     Eastern -zu/bing (Private/Soldier) - 1 step forward (across the river, 1 step vertically/horizontally)<br/><br/><br/>Other rules;<br/>Western Chess Unique Rules<br/>1.

Wars of today are fought by remote war machines. Pitted against you is your enemy, fielding their latest war machines. This will be a fight to the finish, the struggle for supremacy.<br/><br/>With your superior skills as a commander, you are to programme your tank and set it loose. Win or lose will depend on your intimate knowledge of your own tank's inherent abilities as well as your uncanny reading of what your opponent's tank will do and how you perceive it would react in battle.<br/><br/>Win or lose, after each round, redesign, re-programme, rework your tank's subroutines and primary programming to fine-tune your tank's performance. Remember, your enemy is doing the same thing. He would have watched the previous battle and noted his tank's and your tank's performance. He too will be working to reduce deficiencies and weak points in his own programming so as to triumph over yours. Then when you're both done with your re-programming, set let them go at it again! Send out prototype after prototype until either your tanks now reign supreme in every engagement, or they all lie devastated, crushed under the steel treads of better enemy tanks.<br/><br/>Programming is limited to the number of standard programming tiles available in the common pile but be wary of cumbersome programming that may make your tank less than efficient as it spends a fatally long among of time processing your programming while your opponent's more efficient design finds and destroys your tank!<br/><br/>Gentlemen, start your engines.... and let the games begin.<br/><br/>Game Pieces<br/>1 dice (to determine your tank start position on the board)<br/>1 main &quot;battlefield&quot; board - (for 2P board 17steps across, + 1P add 3steps across)<br/>2 primary programming plates<br/>8 subroutine programming plates; 2xFight, 2xEvade, 2xFlee, 2xDamaged<br/>1 red team light tank<br/>1 orange team light tank<br/>1 red team heavy tank<br/>1 orange team heavy tank<br/>6 &quot;damage&quot; pins<br/><br/>A) 1 step Action Tiles<br/>i) Move Forward 1 - (for 2P 5pcs, + 1P add 3pcs)<br/>ii) Move Forward 2 - (for 2P 5pcs, + 1P add 3pcs)<br/>iii) Move Forward 3 (only Light Tank) - (for 2P 3pcs, + 1P add 2pcs)<br/>iv) Turn Left 1 (60 degrees) - (for 2P 5pcs, + 1P add 3pcs)<br/>v) Turn Left 2 (120 degrees) (only Light Tank) - (for 2P 3pcs, + 1P add 2pcs)<br/>vi) Turn Right 1 (60 degrees) - (for 2P 5pcs, + 1P add 3pcs)<br/>vii) Turn Right 2 (120 degrees) (only Light Tank) - (for 2P 3pcs, + 1P add 2pcs)<br/>viii) Reverse 1 - (for 2P 5pcs, + 1P add 3pcs)<br/>ix) Complete Halt - (for 2P 3pcs, + 1P add 2pcs)<br/>x) Detect Level 3 (Logic Gate) - (for 2P 5pcs, + 1P add 3pcs)<br/><br/>B) 2 step Action Tiles<br/>i) Detect Level 4 (Logic Gate) (only Heavy Tank) - (for 2P 5pcs, + 1P add 3pcs)<br/>ii) Fire - (for 2P 3pcs, + 1P add 2pcs)<br/>iii) Shield Activated - (for 2P 5pcs, + 1P add 3pcs)<br/>iv) Shield Deactivated - (for 2P 5pcs, + 1P add 3pcs)<br/><br/>C) Decision Tiles (goto)<br/>i) FIGHT subroutine (Logic Gate) - (for 2P 5pcs, + 1P add 3pcs)<br/>ii) FLEE subroutine - (for 2P 5pcs, + 1P add 3pcs)<br/>iii) EVADE subroutine - (for 2P 5pcs, + 1P add 3pcs)<br/>iv) return to PRIMARY - (for 2P 8pcs, + 1P add 5pcs)<br/><br/>notes:<br/>1) Tank start positions are determined by a throw of the dice and placed on the corresponding number on the board<br/>2) Action and Decision tiles are limited.

He used to take his carrots to market in a wheelbarrow, but one day, over the radio, he heard that airships where much faster than wheelbarrows, so he bought himself something with which he could fly in the clouds.<br/><br/>So here we have a playing board to represent the country over which Uncle Wiggily flew from his carrot farm to the market where he sold his yellow vegetables.  But the rabbit had so many adventures in his new airship as he did when hopping through the woods to cure his rheumatism at Dr. Possom's office.  There were storms, waterspouts and he fell into tail spins and once had to jump in a parachute.<br/><br/>The moves are made by drawing cards.  There are 105 white cards, each one telling you how many miles to hop Uncle Wiggily through the air.  There are 35 red cards, which may move Uncle Wiggily ahead or perhaps delay hime for a turn or two, all according to luck.<br/><br/>The air path, from Uncle Wiggily's farm to the market is marked by sign boards each containing a letter instead of a number.  And when these letters are separated into words, beginning at the farm, they spell out a funny little verse.  See if you can write it down after the game.<br/><br/>"}, "32922": {"boardgamedesigner": {"190": {"name": "Spartaco Albertarelli"}}, "average": "5.04", "poll": {}, "name": "Camper Tour", "playingtime": "30", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": {"2014": "Betting/Wagering"}, "yearpublished": "2007", "usersrated": "50", "maxplayers": "4", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic784300_t.jpg", "boardgameartist": {"44932": "Floriano Bitturini"}, "statistics": {}, "boardgamepublisher": {"4785": {"name": "Ghenos Games"}}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic784300.jpg", "boardgameversion": {"84499": "First edition"}, "maxplaytime": "30", "boardgamecategory": {"1041": {"name": "Children's Game"}}, "age": "14", "minplaytime": "30", "description": "Play and travel, travel and play <br/>Those who tour by Camper know that every journey is a short, yet wonderfully freeing adventure.

The name of the game references the local hand-made flat-bottom wood boats used for fishing in the shallows of the surrounding Caribbean and Atlantic waters.<br/><br/>The play of Pirogue will be challenging play and good fun for gamers who enjoy games such as Tichu, Sticheln, Pinochle, M&uuml; &amp; Mehr, Spades, or Oh Hell!  The game will also be a great companion for sportsmen who want to play a card game which couples concentration and skill with the same sense of anticipation and suspense found in a real big game fishing tournament.<br/><br/>One of the most important things for the first-time Pirogue player to learn is the abilities of the SPECIAL cards.  Each SPECIAL card adds a different and subtle tactical twist to the game.  Some cards even have different strengths depending on whether the card is the lead card in the trick or a following card.<br/><br/>Unique to Pirogue is the HOOK card.  The HOOK card is a unique trick-taking device specific to the game.  The HOOK card addresses the unpredictability and surprise found in sport fishing while adding another level of tactical play.  The HOOK card also assists in removing the predictable run of the table for the strongest of hands because even the lowest SUITED card is a dangerous threat.  Recognizing the strength of a well balanced hand over what may seem like a traditionally strong hand is an important part of understanding Pirogue play and key to successfully making a bid.<br/><br/>Also distinctive to Pirogue is linked play between partnerships and individuals.  In big game fishing tournaments, prizes are awarded for both best boat and best angler.  The game of Pirogue is played in partnerships called Pirogues as well as by individual players called Anglers.  Pirogues and Anglers compete in an intertwined, and sometimes entangled, opposition to win Game Trophies that count towards taking home the ultimate prize: The Trinidad &amp; Tobago Tarpon Tournament Trophy!<br/><br/>"}, "32971": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic274388.jpg", "poll": {}, "boardgamedesigner": {"1005": {"name": "Todd Breitenstein"}}, "statistics": {}, "boardgamecompilation": {"42627": "MidEvil Deluxe"}, "yearpublished": "2007", "maxplayers": "6", "boardgameartist": {"1006": "Dave Aikins"}, "boardgamepublisher": {"838": {"name": "Twilight Creations, Inc."}}, "maxplaytime": "60", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic274388_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "60", "boardgamecategory": {"1022": {"name": "Adventure"}}, "description": "The castle is nice but, let's face it, the entertainment options are limited.

In Britain, Royal Navy planners wondered just what their American allies were up to, because such a fleet could only have one potential adversary. Britain also made plans to construct new ships.<br/><br/>Sea of Troubles is a 64-page book supplement for the Great War at Sea series based on the war plans of both sides. Most of the scenarios take place in the Caribbean Sea, using the map from U.S. Navy Plan Gold, but some actions are also placed in European waters on the maps for Jutland or Mediterranean.<br/><br/>There are 210 die-cut and mounted playing pieces, the same pieces that originally appeared in our now out-of-print U.S. Navy Plan Red. The Americans get the huge 1919 program battleship mounting eight 18-inch guns as well as four examples of the South Dakota class with their dozen 16-inch guns apiece. There are also the Lexington class battle cruisers in their original configuration with 14-inch guns, and the 1914 design for a fast commerce-raiding armored cruiser armed with 10-inch guns.<br/><br/>The Royal Navy adds the remainder of its R-class battleships not seen in Jutland, plus the huge battleships of the N3 design with nine 18-inch guns each, and the ungainly but powerful battle cruisers of the G3 design. Plus the Royal Canadian Navy makes an appearance with three dreadnought battleships and a flotilla of destroyers.<br/><br/>There are over three dozen new scenarios featuring brawls between huge fleets of battleships, plus of course background articles on the ships, the fleets and the war plans of all potential participants.<br/><br/>This is not a stand-alone game; ownership of Mediterranean, Jutland and U.S. Navy Plan Gold is required to enjoy all of the scenarios.<br/><br/>NOTE: This product acts as a successor to the now out-of-print Great War at Sea: U.S. Navy Plan Red.  As a result, both countersheets that ship with this product are still labeled 'US Navy Plan Red', although the scenarios for that product, set along the United States Eastern seaboard, are now deprecated in favor of scenarios set in the Mediterranean and North Sea.  Additionally, while 'US Navy Plan Red' was a boxed-set and limited to a few scenarios that could work with the components included, as a module book 'Sea of Troubles' is not so constrained.  There are more than 2 dozen scenarios in this product that cover more than just 'Plan Red', along with articles on the ships and historical flavor for this period.<br/><br/>Plan Red was released in a second edition in 2013. It has a completely revised scenario book with 14 battle and 20 operational scenarios, and updated special rules.

Players cast three wooden billets, known as Pa-tol sticks, onto a flat stone; how they fall indicates how far their piece can move. Landing on another player's piece sends it back to its start.

The territory held and political points value of a country determine its military strength.<br/><br/>One of the key features to the game is ability to influence a minor power using your political points. If enough are used then there is a chance the minor power will be come friendly (allowing passage through their territory) or even allied (allowing use of their military).<br/><br/>Like Diplomacy, orders are written down and executed simultaneously. In 1930! the orders include everything from movement to application of political power.

Your goal is to take your nation from humble beginnings to the status of a world economic superpower.  You achieve this by building Industries, which allows you to produce Commodities.  There are six types of Industry tiles:  Farms, Generators, Academies, Mines, Factories, and Banks.  Each Industry is capable of producing a certain type of Commodity:  Food, Energy, Labor, Ore, and Capital (respectively).<br/><br/>Each Commodity has one or more uses in the game.  For example, Food is required to &quot;feed&quot; your Industries when they produce, while Capital is used to build certain types of Industries.  As you build Industries, you create ever larger Industrial Blocs.  The larger a Bloc is, the greater your return on investment when the Bloc produces Commodities.<br/><br/>The main focus of the game is trade.  Because it is economically unfeasible to produce every Commodity you need, you must engage in trade to get the Commodities that you require.  Each Commodity has a trade value influenced by the Markets.<br/><br/>There is one Market for each type of Commodity.  If you can't gain a Commodity that you need by trading with your fellow players, you must buy it from the Market.  Buying a Commodity from the Market increases its price, reflecting increased demand.  Similarly, there are times when you can't unload your surplus Commodities because your fellow players have no need for them.  If you wish to earn money from these Commodities, you must sell them to the Market.  Selling a Commodity to the Market decreases its price, reflecting increased supply.<br/><br/>As you build new Industries and earn more money, you acquire Victory Points.

This is the playable game, professionally developed and packaged, and fun.<br/><br/>Scrimmage was invented by Chuck Eskridge, and David Williams.  It is a football game in which one side controls the offense and the other controls the defense. Movement is accomplished by dice rolls, with slower players have lower maximum movement capability. Each side has pieces (players) of varying strength and speed.  Any player can tackle any other player, but only players of equal or greater strength can block opposing players.  The offense sets up, and then the defense, with a twist: the defense does not know whether the offense is running a passing play or a running play. (The choice is disclosed after the play starts.) If it is a passing play, the pass can be thrown to a designated grid but only after the play has had time to develop.  If a play breaks down, the offensive player draws a card to determine whether he can recover.<br/><br/>The passing mechanism works wonderfully: the offense places two men downfield in one of several grids, and secretly chooses a card identifying the grid to which the pass will be made. Each team then moves players (including the potential receivers) with the roll of the dice. When the pass is made, the offense chooses which square in the grid the pass will go to. The choice of squares determines how easy it is for the receiver and the defensive back(s) to get to the square to which the pass is made: if the receiver gets to the square and the back does not, the pass is complete.  If the back gets to the square and the receiver does not, the pass is intercepted.  If both get to the square, the pass is incomplete.<br/><br/>The running game and the pass rush depend on the the success of the blockers and the defensive line.  There is luck in the dice rolls, of course, but the luck evens out over the course of the game and a good play can survive a little bad luck.  Card drawing can also be important. Sometimes tacklers reach the ball carrier but fail to make the tackle, or make the tackle and force a fumble, which can be recovered by either the offense of defense.<br/><br/>This is one of the few games non-simulation football games (i.e., not strat-o-matic football or its cousins) that really feels like you are playing football.

The battlefield is a cityscape (poster map) with building models integral to the game's strategy and gameplay. The game uses dice pools of custom dice that are used for both attacking and taking actions, leading to an ebb and flow between monster and unit turns. The goal for both players is to eliminate the monster on the opposing side.<br/><br/>Monsterpocalypse launched as a CMG in Fall 2008 with the 'Rise' block which consisted of a base set ('Rise') and two expansion sets ('I Chomp NY' and 'All Your Base'), both of which were released in 2009. The second block was released in Fall 2009 with the base set ('Now') and an expansion set ('Big in Japan') in 2010. The last expansion for the 'Now' block has still not been released as of 2015.<br/><br/>Each set contains large-scale monsters, as well as smaller support units and interactive buildings. Figures were sold in semi-randomized starter packs and randomized booster packs, with limited figures available only through promotional events.<br/><br/>In 2010 Privateer Press released the Monsterpocalypse 2 Player Battle Box, a semi-randomised set which contained everything 2 players needed to dive right into the game, including two full factions and a complete set of buildings (all from Set 1 'Rise'). In 2011 they also released Monsterpocalypse Dangerous Monster Zone or Monsterpocalypse DMZ for short. These worked as expansion packs for the 2 Player Battle Box, each containing completely fixed, faction specific sets of Set 2 'I Chomp NY' and 3 'All Your Base' miniatures. By buying the DMZs for the factions you got in your  initial battle box you would have 2 complete factions and a full set of buildings from the 'Rise' block, making Monsterpocalypse  much more accessible for newer players in a more non-collectible format.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": {"176445": "First  G.U.A.R.D.

Each player starts out by choosing four characters (repeats are allowed), and designates one as the leader. Your leader has an initial health point (HP), border value (BV) and evasion value (EV), which will be used throughout the match, as well as some special abilities. Your starting spell point (SP) is zero. The other characters are to allow you access to other cards; the character requirements can be seen at the top of each card.<br/><br/>After you've picked your team, you get to choose 40 cards (duplicates are allowed up to a total of three) that comprise your deck. Obviously you will pick cards that you can actually use.<br/><br/>You will keep track of your HP and SP using counters.

The player round consists of moving all your cargo ships 1 space then rolling the dice and moving your units. A player may make a single air attack instead of moving any naval units.  The air units have unlimited range and the number required to make an attack is based on the target.  Losses are also based on the target and are automatic (for example it takes 4 air units to attack a naval formation and 2 air units are automatically lost).<br/><br/>A merchant ship can join a naval formation and create a convoy for more protection. Naval combat consists of a surprise attack (by submarines) and open attacks between naval formations.

Far off to the west a great unknown wilderness was opening up. North America was being conquered and empires were being built.  Today in the game Conquest we re-enact the conquering of the continent.<br/><br/>It is a game in which keen judgement interspersed with dashes of bluff and audacity mingle with lady luck to create a game that on one is out of until the last hand is played.<br/><br/>The purpose of the game is to conquer as many of the 50 states shown as possible.  States must be conquered in the order listed under &quot;Order of Conquest&quot; shown on the game board and are also one of either four colors and have a number associated with victory points at the end of the game.<br/><br/>There are four phases to the game - 1) Bidding your hand, 2)Marking of conquered territory and distribution of groups, 3)Dealing new cards, 4) Additional conquest.<br/><br/>In the bidding phase, players bid on their hand of five cards. First player is to the right of the dealer and then in subsequent hands, the winner of the previous hand starts the bid.  Starting player places a bid.  Bids cannot be higher than $5 million.  The remaining players can either pass, meet the bid or raise the bid.  Winning hands are determined in order of winning hierarchy: Single: Highest single card of color called for; Doubles: Two matching number cards, one in the color being called; Triples: Three matching number cards, one in the color being called; Sweep: All four cards of the same number.<br/><br/>In the second phase, the winner of the hand takes all money bid and places one of their markers on the state or states conquered, receiving the number of regiments of troops as indicated on the conquered state.  5 regiments = 1 division.  Only divisions can be placed on the maps in any territories the players owns. Players may redistribute any troops that he possesses for the purposes of defense or offense. Players can also purchase additional troops.<br/><br/>In the third phase, the dealers asks if everyone is ready for the deal.  The dealer hands out enough cards to bring all players hands up to five cards. If a player receives a money card they can immediately turn the card in to collect the cash and gets another card.<br/><br/>In the final phase, players may conquer states of their opponents. Starting with the player who won the last hand states can be conquered via the following rules: 1)State must adjoin the territory of conqueror and belong to an opponent 2) Must have more troop divisions that place being conquered 3) Player must pay bank sum of 10 million plus 5 million for every divsion that opponent has in the conquered territory (Max 40 million) 4) Only one state can be conquered per hand 5) Conquered troops are returned to opponent and 6) if conquests results in a complete territory being possessed than additional troops are obtained for the district.<br/><br/>To conclude the game: After all states have been conquered there is a final phase of general conquest until no one has any resources left to conquer with.  The winner is the player having the highest score by totaling the victory points associated with the states conquered.<br/><br/>"}, "32696": {"boardgamedesigner": {"3": {"name": "(Uncredited)"}}, "poll": {}, "name": "GHQ", "playingtime": "0", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": {"2078": "Point to Point Movement"}, "yearpublished": "1940", "usersrated": "3", "boardgamesubdomain": {"4664": "Wargames"}, "maxplayers": "2", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1870651_t.jpg", "average": "6", "statistics": {}, "boardgamepublisher": {"3922": {"name": "John Waddington Ltd."}}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1870651.jpg", "boardgameversion": {"104057": "John Waddington first edition"}, "maxplaytime": "0", "boardgamecategory": {"1019": {"name": "Wargame"}}, "age": "0", "minplaytime": "0", "description": "From the rules:  G.H.Q. is a Strategic war game for two players, one player representing the Allied Armies and the other the German Army.

At the beginning of the game players pick one of the six great countries as their home country.  They get one Diplomat, 10 consulates, 5 soldiers, 1 bomber and 1 battleship.  The battleship and bomber are placed on the home country flag and all the diplomats are placed on &quot;Start&quot;.<br/><br/>The mechanic of the game consists of movement around the path of flags via the roll of dice (doubles get a second roll). When a player lands on a colony he places a soldier, a second landing on the same colony gains a consulate and the Country Flag card.  Landing on an independent country gains an immediate colony.  Soldiers can be captured if another player lands on a colony before a consulate is placed.  Players can move across the Bridge of Flags if they land on one of the two Neutral Countries, doing so gains the player a battleship or bomber.  The battleship or bomber can be used to gain a strategic location flag if he owned when he lands on a strategic location. Normally players can only move clockwise but control of a strategic location allows the player to move either direction when he lands on one.  Additional game play is added via card play introduced by landing on an &quot;Isolation&quot; spot.<br/><br/>The game ends when one player has placed 10 consulates.

The leading horse earns a bonus for the player.  The horse pictured on the last card of the last deck is the race winner.  The winning horse earns the bet times the odds for the player.
