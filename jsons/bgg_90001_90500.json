Customize your team by drafting Star Players, hiring staff, upgrading facilities, and cheating like mad. Lead your gang of misfits and miscreants to glory over your rivals all to become Spike! Magazine's Manager of the Year!<br/><br/>Once a manager has chosen one of the six teams, he has five weeks to groom them into the best in the league, culminating with the Blood Bowl tournament. He does this by competing at highlights, collecting payouts, upgrading his personnel, and drafting Star Players.<br/><br/>Managers begin the season with a starting team deck full of basic scrub players. These players are none too bright and have limited talents, but a clever manager can play to their strengths by carefully positioning them to excel on the pitch.<br/><br/>Is your team ready to compete against other teams in head-to-head highlights? Highlights are the randomly determined matchups over which players compete. The more highlights a team wins, the more it improves and the more fans it accumulates.<br/><br/>The season culminates with the Blood Bowl tournament. After the Blood Bowl, the season ends.

Infected individuals made it into several major cities before the airports were shut down, and all hell breaks loose. Players have to take the role of civilian governments trying to keep the populace calm, military forces trying to eliminate the threat by force, corporate interests trying to profit from the situation, and of course, someone is playing the zombies. Zombies are a global epidemic, and Zombie War maintains the chaos factor by letting players:<br/><br/>Rotate roles and play each faction<br/>Keep their victory conditions hidden<br/>Sabotage other player&rsquo;s roles<br/><br/>Zombie war includes a 22&quot; x 17&quot; map, 88 die-cut counters, attractive die, and role, victory condition and player aid cards.&quot;<br/><br/><a target='_blank' href='http://www.locknloadgame.com/Section_Cat_Content_Detail.asp?SCAT=91&amp' rel='nofollow'>http://www.locknloadgame.com/Section_Cat_Content_Detail.asp?...</a>;SID=33&amp;ID=114<br/><br/>Further description from Mark Walker over at CSW...<br/><br/>&quot;Designed by Greg Porter, Zombie War looks at a war against zombies on a strategic level. Instead of lone survivors battling it out at the mall, it is an international scale, with players managing the global response to an unknown threat. The game includes a 17 x 22 map, a set of 18 cards with turn roles, victory conditions and player aids, and a sheet of 88 counters. The map is semi-abstract, using area-based movement between major world population centers, trade hubs or points of economic or political interest, connected by lines representing the difficulty of zombies shambling their way from one spot to another. So, the New York City-Washington DC route is minimal difficulty (1), while the Los Angeles-Honolulu link is maximum difficulty (4)&hellip; Even routes like the latter are possible, zombies being an inventive bunch, stumbling into shipping containers and so on. And all it takes is one zombie to invade a region...<br/><br/>There are a number of things that add to the excitement in Zombie War. A situation like a plague of zombies would generate many different military, civilian and business responses, both in a real-world and typical zombie fiction sense (think of the Umbrella Corporation in Resident Evil). In Zombie War, each player takes on the role of Government, Military, Corporate or Zombies. However, each player plays a different role each game turn, passing their role to the right after each round of play. The government wants to keep people calm and find a medical answer to the problem, the military wants to halt the spread by any means possible (preferably violent), the corporate player wants to isolate the zombies for experimentation (and profit) and the zombies just want to spread. The points a player gains through game actions accumulate regardless of which role they are playing on a turn, but your take on what the military should be doing about the threat may be different than the previous military player, and at cross purposes with the next military player. Each role gains points for different things, and has certain unique actions that affect the other roles. For instance, the government player can adjust the global &quot;threat level&quot;, which determines the severity of military response allowed, but the government player gets points for leaving the threat level as-is or lowering it (&quot;the problem is contained, the public is encouraged to remain calm...&quot;), which is not necessarily what the military player wants.<br/><br/>Zombie War is designed to be simple enough to appeal to the typical player of Eurogames and a 3-4 player game, but to have the heart of a genuine strategic game and be playable just as well in a 2-player mode.&quot;<br/><br/>"}, "90157": {"poll": [], "name": "Shin Megami Tensei", "videogamemode": ["Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["Japan GBA edition", "Japan PlayStation edition", "Japan SEGA CD edition", "Japan Super Famicom edition", "Japan Turbografx CD edition", "Wii U Virtual Console (SNES) edition", "Wii VC edition"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic998707.jpg", "videogametheme": ["Horror"], "videogamegenre": ["RPG"], "videogamecharacter": ["Kobold"], "videogamedeveloper": ["Atlus Co.

The player can make Popeye walk back and forth and up and down stairs and ladders with an 8-way joystick. There is a punch button, but unlike similar games of the period, no jump button. (Conversely, Brutus can jump down a level and also jump up to hit Popeye if he is directly above.) Each level has a can of spinach. If Popeye punches the can, he becomes temporarily invincible and can knock out Brutus just by running into him; although after a few seconds Brutus will swim back out and be ready for action again.<br/><br/>In Round 1 (the dock scene) of each three-round cycle is a punching bag, which Popeye can use to knock loose a nearby barrel from its position near the top of the playing field. If the barrel falls onto Brutus' head, the player earns bonus points (based on where Brutus was attacked) and renders Brutus harmless for several seconds.<br/><br/>Otherwise Popeye's attacks did nothing to his nemesis; although the attack button did destroy items that could hurt Popeye such as bottles, vultures and skulls.<br/><br/>Other licensed Popeye characters in the game are Olive Oyl, Swee' Pea, and Wimpy, though they are mostly decorative and do not add heavily to the gameplay. Wimpy appears in Round 2 (the street scene) on one end of the see-saw in the lower left corner of the field, to act as a counterweight. Swee' Pea floats high above, with bonus points to be earned if Popeye can spring off the see-saw and touch him.<br/><br/>In 2008, Namco Networks released an enhanced remake for mobile phones. The game plays largely the same, though it features an Enhanced mode in addition to the arcade original, which includes a bonus stage and an extra level which pays homage to the short A Dream Walking where Popeye must save a sleepwalking Olive, as well as some trivia segments.

It is similar to Exidy's 1977 Circus arcade game. The goal is to shoot at targets, while carefully avoiding running out of bullets. The targets that scroll across the screen, in rows that alternate going from left-to-right and right-to-left. Targets include rabbits, ducks, owls, and bonus items. If the duck targets from the bottom row aren't shot, they eventually come to life and begin descending towards the bottom of the screen in a zig-zag pattern. If a duck reaches the bottom of the screen without being shot first, it will eat some of the player's bullets. Objects also periodically appear among the targets that will give the player extra bullets when shot. A spinning wheel with eight pipes sits above the rows of moving targets; all the pipes must be shot before the round can end.<br/><br/>At the end of each round, the player receives bonus points for all bullets remaining in his supply. He then plays a bonus round, where a large white bear with a target walks across the screen. Each time the bear is shot, it rears up for a second, then begins walking more quickly in the other direction. The object is to shoot the bear as many times as possible until it escapes off the screen. Following the bonus round, the next wave begins.<br/><br/>In higher levels, there are more duck targets and fewer extra bullet targets, putting a premium on accurate shooting. The game ends when the player runs out of bullets.<br/><br/>The tune that plays throughout the game is Sobre las Olas (Over the Waves) by Juventino Rosas, a tune commonly associated with carnivals and funfairs.<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;Carnival (arcade game),&quot; available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "90247": {"rpgartist": ["Brian Blume", "Paul Hanchette", "Batton Lash", "Gary Williams"], "statistics": [], "name": "Polyhedron (Issue 73 - Vol. 12, No. 7)", "rpgdesigner": ["Timothy B.

As a Smurf, the player has to walk from the Smurf village through a forest and a cave on the way to Gargamel's castle, where Smurfette awaits rescue. The player has an energy bar that slowly depletes over time. Each side-scrolling screen presents various obstacles that the player must precisely jump over (e.g. fences, stalagmites) or land upon (e.g. ledges). Failure to execute any jump results in instant death. Higher difficulty levels introduce flying bats and spiders that the player must also avoid.<br/><br/>The ColecoVision version of Smurf: Rescue in Gargamel's Castle contains an Easter egg (or programming error). Upon reaching Smurfette's screen, the player can return to the previous screen.

The player, named Winky, is equipped with a bow and arrow and explores a dungeon with rooms and hallways. The hallways are patrolled by large, tentacled monsters (the &quot;Hallmonsters&quot;, according to Exidy) who cannot be injured, killed, or stopped in any way. Once in a room, the player may kill monsters, avoid traps and gather treasures. If they stay in any room too long, a Hallmonster will enter the room, chase and kill them. In this way, the Hallmonsters serve the same role as &quot;Evil Otto&quot; in the arcade game Berzerk. The more quickly the player finishes each level, the higher their score.<br/><br/>The goal of each room is only to steal the room's treasure. In most rooms, it is possible (though difficult) to steal the treasure without defeating the monsters within. Some rooms have traps that are only sprung when the player picks up the treasure. For instance, in &quot;The Two-Headed Room&quot;, two 2-headed ettins appears the moment the player picks up the prize.<br/><br/>Players die if they touch a monster. Touching even a dead monster is lethal and is known as &quot;getting carrioned&quot;. Dead monsters decay over time and their corpses may block room exits, delaying the player and possibly allowing the Hallmonster to enter. Reshooting a dead corpse causes it to regress back to its initial death phase. The monsters themselves move in specific patterns but may deviate to chase the player, and the game's AI allows them to dodge the player's shots with varying degrees of &quot;intelligence&quot; (for example, the snakes of &quot;The Serpent Room&quot; are relatively slow to dodge arrows, the trolls of &quot;The Troll Room&quot; are quite adept at evasion).<br/><br/>The game consists of three different dungeon levels with different rooms. After clearing all the rooms in a level the player advances to the next.

The player controls a spaceship battling alien spacecraft. Like other early similar arcade games, it is controlled by four buttons: rotate left, rotate right, thrust and fire. The game was particularly unique in that the player could choose different upgrades for the first three levels. One upgrade would allow the player to shoot in a three-way pattern, another would allow the player to fire forward and backwards, and the third would allow all the firepower to be concentrated in the front.<br/><br/>At the conclusion of the following round, the player would then pick up another shell, although multiple ones could not be used together. The different firing patterns made each round seem slightly different. Between rounds and during the attract mode, the alien commander would taunt the player through the use of synthesized speech. The spacecraft would initially appear separated and would not be able to shoot if some of the pieces were annihilated before they converged, but would try to ram the player's ship at an increasingly faster velocity.

The title character, Mr. Do (a circus clown), is constantly chased by red monsters resembling small dinosaurs, and the player loses a life if Mr. Do is caught by one. The game is over when the last life is lost.<br/><br/>Cherries are distributed throughout the level in groups of eight.  500 bonus points are awarded if Mr. Do collects eight cherries in a row without stopping.  A level is complete when all cherries are removed, all monsters are destroyed, &quot;EXTRA&quot; is spelled, or a diamond is found.<br/><br/>Mr. Do can defeat the monsters by hitting them with his bouncing &quot;power ball&quot; or by dropping large apples on them.  While the power ball is bouncing toward a monster, Mr. Do is defenseless, leaving him vulnerable.  If the ball bounces into an area where there are no monsters to hit (such as behind a fallen apple), Mr. Do cannot use it again until he has retrieved it.  When the power ball hits a monster, it then reforms in Mr. Do's hands after a delay that increases with each use.<br/><br/>If an apple lands on a monster, or falls more than its own height, it breaks and disappears.  If an apple drops a short distance and does not break, Mr. Do or the red monsters can push it off the edge of a vertical tunnel and crush one or more monsters.  Mr. Do can also be crushed by a falling apple causing a loss of life.<br/><br/>Occasionally, the red monsters transform briefly into slower, more powerful multicolored monsters that can tunnel through the ground.  If one of these digs through a cherry, it leaves fewer cherries (and fewer points) for Mr. Do to collect.  When it digs under an apple, it often crushes itself, other red/blue monsters, and/or Mr. Do.<br/><br/>Each time the score passes a certain threshold during play (5000 points), a letter from the word &quot;EXTRA&quot; appears on the playfield as an Alphamonster, and the player can defeat or be defeated by this monster in the same way as a red monster.  Defeating an Alphamonster awards that letter to the player, and collecting all five letters of the word completes the level, plays a cut scene inexplicably playing the theme to Astro Boy, and awards the player an extra life.  Alphamonsters eat any apples they encounter, which makes them difficult (but not impossible) to crush.<br/><br/>The red monsters pop up from a generator at the center of the screen. After they have all appeared, the generator will turn into a food item; picking this up scores bonus points, freezes all the red monsters, and calls out an Alphamonster and three large blue monsters. The latter can eat apples as well. The red monsters stay frozen (but still deadly) until the player either defeats the Alphamonster, defeats all three blue monsters, loses a life, or completes the stage.<br/><br/>Rarely, dropping an apple will reveal a diamond which, if collected within about 15 seconds, completes the level and awards a bonus credit to the player (as well as 8000 points), allowing him or her to play a free game.

The Wrenwalds weren&rsquo;t particularly good or kind, but they did protect the villagers from the ravages of the marsh&rsquo;s beasts, and as long as the heavy and oppressive taxes rolled in, nobody died from Magic Missile. One day in the reign of Lord Justin Wrenwald III however, this all came to an end. One night while the family reveled with friends, the Swamp Witch Julieann demanded entrance as an honored guest. Seeing the ugly Hag (and fearing not the stories of her horrible power) the lord laughed in her face and ordered her put off the grounds. For this insult the Swamp Hag cursed the family, and horrible magics rose from Dark Realms. Many simply died; others transformed into living death, and the very estate itself took on the taint of Evil. A few villagers who served on the grounds escaped to the village to tell the awful tale, and since that night the villagers have avoided the grounds like the plague.

It has been around since 1980 and has powered games from RuneQuest (1st & 2nd Editions) and Call of Cthulhu to Stormbringer and (in modified form) Pendragon (1st - 5th Editions). Though many gamers have problems with aspects of the system, it is generally well regarded as being a simple, intuitive, and playable game.<br/><br/>Basic Roleplaying: The Chaosium System, intended to be an introductory RPG, tries to simplify an already simple system, and does so by removing the vast majority of what actually makes the game run. The game uses standard Chaosium attributes (Strength, Constitution, Size, Intelligence, Power, Dexterity, and Appearance), but only has 8 skills: Climb, First Aid, Hide, Jump, Listen, Sneak, Spot Hidden, and Throw. The game mentions other skills, but never gives rules, stats, or any information about them &ndash; other than that they are sometimes necessary and can be found in other games. Weapon skills are all based on the type of weapon being used, with everyone starting with the same skill for the same weapon, and everyone doing the same damage with the same weapon. Once again things like alternate weapons and multiple types of armor are mentioned, but no stats are given for them. Similarly the classic Idea and Luck rolls are present, but with incomplete and contradictory rules given for their implementation.<br/><br/>"}, "90304": {"poll": [], "name": "Liberty Wings", "videogamemode": ["Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["iPhone edition"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic894362.png", "videogametheme": ["War - World War II"], "usersrated": "1", "videogamedeveloper": ["Digital Reality"], "videogamegenre": ["Shoot 'em Up"], "videogameplatform": ["iPhone"], "average": "6", "statistics": [], "videogamepublisher": ["Digital Reality"], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic894362_t.png", "description": "Take control of a World War II air fighter and fight your way through enemy lines in this action-packed shoot-em-up!<br/>Liberty Wings puts you in the role of an air officer from the US Navy during World War II, with the mission to hunt and take down all elements of the German Atom Bomb Project.

The Japanese version has more tracks and objects like people and trees than the American and euro releases.<br/><br/>The game was also released on a number of contemporary home computer platforms, such as the Sinclair ZX Spectrum, Commodore 64, Amstrad CPC and Atari ST.

Hunted by the creatures of darkness, we had no culture, and only the most primitive of tools.<br/><br/>Norandon, as we call him, changed everything. He is called many things: Thoth, Quetzalcouatl, Enoch, Viracocha, Prometheus; but always the story is the same. The God(s) sent him to teach us the things we needed to know to push back the hated Creatures of Darkness.<br/><br/>There was a long age where the Vampires were beaten back, and we emerged into the sun. We call this the Golden Age, for the Creatures had not yet evolved defences against what Norandon had taught us, and they feared us.<br/><br/>By the Enlightenment of the eighteenth century, belief in magic had greatly diminished in the civilized portions of the world, religious or non-religious. As belief fuels magic, magic became very difficult to accomplish in those areas. we call this absence of magic, for good or evil, the Nullity. Magic lingered on in the backwaters of society, where the supernatural was more real than science, but these areas shrank as the Nullity grew.<br/><br/>Thus, we, the forces of Light, the heirs of Norandon, again have both the need and the means to pick up the challenge thrown by the Dark.

An indication of the distance to the criminal car was shown on the right of the screen.<br/><br/>After catching up with the criminal car, the player would have to ram it to reduce it's health bar, shown on the left of the screen, to zero before the timer ran out.<br/><br/>Successive levels would find the player chasing faster cars with more health.<br/><br/>The game made innovative use of voice samples with encouragement and criticism from your co-driver and information from the police dispatcher.<br/><br/>The game was converted to many of the popular 8-bit and 16-bit computers and consoles of the era.<br/><br/>"}, "90349": {"rpgdesigner": ["Bob Blake", "Daniel Bowers", "Andrew Ernstein", "Harold Johnson", "Tim Tollefson", "Rex Zinn"], "statistics": [], "name": "Polyhedron (Issue 33 - Vol. 6, No. 6)", "rpgartist": ["Diane Hamil", "Valerie Valusek"], "rpgproducer": ["Sylvia Deering", "Kim Lindau", "Roger Raupp", "Mary Ryan", "Skip Williams"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1005390.jpg", "usersrated": "0", "average": "0", "rpgissue": ["Polyhedron"], "rpgissuearticle": ["Arcane Academe", "Classifieds", "Convention Judge Appeal", "Conventions", "Expanding the Power of the Cube", "Let's Clean Up Our Act", "Letters", "Notes From HQ: Magic Trick", "The Critical Hit", "The New Rogues Gallery: The Brenalette Family & Friends", "The Sword & The Anti-Hero: Part 1 of the Maiden of Pain Series"], "rpg": ["Advanced Dungeons & Dragons (1st Edition)", "Advanced Dungeons & Dragons (2nd Edition)", "Basic Dungeons & Dragons"], "rpgpublisher": ["TSR"], "rpgissueversion": ["Magazine"], "poll": [], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1005390_t.jpg", "description": "Cover art: The Brenalette Family is portrayed on the cover of this issue.

In her quest to dominate the airwaves, Kim cheats on her husband, neglects her daughter, and mistreats her staff. It all seems worth it when she wins the biggest German Television Award, but sadly on the very same night she is crushed to death by debris falling from a Russian space station. At the gates of Heaven, she is informed that she has collected too much bad karma in her life, and has a long road of atonement ahead. Reincarnation as an ant teaches her a few lessons in humility, and she experiences existence as a guinea pig and as a beagle before regaining human form just in time to sabotage the marriage of her husband to her back-stabbing best friend.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "3", "boardgameversion": ["German first edition"], "age": "10", "name": "Mieses Karma", "playingtime": "30", "average": "5.98735", "usersrated": "83", "boardgamefamily": ["Kosmos Literature Series"], "boardgamepodcastepisode": ["Garrett's Games 343 - Ark and Noah, Aztlan, and Mieses Karma"]}, "90376": {"boardgamedesigner": ["J\u00f3na Ingibj\u00f6rg J\u00f3nsd\u00f3ttir"], "average": "1", "poll": [], "name": "Kynstrin \u00f6ll", "playingtime": "90", "minplayers": "3", "boardgamemechanic": ["Dice Rolling"], "yearpublished": "2010", "usersrated": "1", "maxplayers": "8", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic905704_t.jpg", "boardgameartist": ["Finnur J\u00f3hannsson Malmquist"], "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["Kynstrin slf."], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic905704.jpg", "boardgameversion": ["First edition"], "maxplaytime": "90", "boardgamecategory": ["Trivia"], "age": "15", "minplaytime": "90", "description": "From the publisher: Kynstrin &ouml;ll is a fun and different trivia game with interesting and funny questions.

It also includes the visual style and artwork of Mark Ryden.<br/><br/>The game came soon after the release of Myst, which revolutionized the graphic adventure genre. Like Myst, 9 is a graphically-rich 3D prerendered world, taking advantage of high-quality QuickTime video, and solely available on CD-ROM. It was written for the Windows platform, unlike most games of the time which ran on DOS and the Mac OS platform.<br/><br/>9 features a large cast of characters, and is rich in character interaction. The game world is populated by bizarre environments, objects and creatures. The game world is designed to represent the limits of man's imagination. There is a strong musical theme running through the entire game, as evidenced by a majority of the puzzles, including the main recurring puzzle.

The five weekly chapters of the Crimson Emperor can be played as parts of a larger story arc, or as stand-alone adventures.<br/><br/>In this first installment, the players are drawn into an attempt by mobsters to put an end to the political career of maverick politician Senator Stuart &quot;Steamboat Stu&quot; Morrison. This will lead them on a journey that will, through the course of the other chapters of the Serial Adventure, bring them from the dark alleys of Chinatown, to a hidden valley in Tibet, and from the fortress of a self-styled Emperor to the very Halls of Power in Washington D.C.!<br/><br/>"}, "90417": {"poll": [], "name": "World in War", "videogamemode": ["Local Multiplayer", "Network Multiplayer", "Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["iPad edition", "iPhone edition"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic899257.jpg", "videogametheme": ["War - World War II"], "usersrated": "2", "videogamedeveloper": ["Fabrication Games", "PAN Vision"], "videogamegenre": ["Strategy"], "videogameplatform": ["iPad", "iPhone"], "average": "4.25", "statistics": [], "videogamepublisher": ["PAN Vision"], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic899257_t.jpg", "description": "World in War is an epic turn based strategy game set in World War II Europe.

They can explore the nation and accept quests from people they meet in the different towns and cities, or simply explore the outlands and defeat monsters.<br/><br/>Unlike most action RPGs of the era, Sacred utilizes a cooldown period for spells rather than a mana pool.

First, players gain cards.  Each card has a 3x3 grid (like the holes on a Yago Pool board) of which 8 of the points are punched.  The cards are stacked in the hand held (that is not fanned, like a traditional card game) so that the solid point on each card can be seen through the cards.  Once a player has the right combination of cards and can create a row, players can then place a chip (red or yellow) on one of the corresponding points on the game board. If a player can cover all five points on the wild card, he may place his chip on any point on the board.<br/><br/>Scoring is via making rows on the main board.  1 point for a line of three chips or placing 5 chips on the board.

It was based on the World Wrestling Federation's annual pay-per-view, WrestleMania. The game was released at the height of the WWF's Attitude Era, and marked the start of THQ's relationship with the WWF.<br/><br/>The game was succeeded by WWF No Mercy in 2000.<br/><br/>Its Japanese counterpart was Virtual Pro Wrestling 2: \u014cd\u014d Keish\u014d.<br/><br/>WrestleMania 2000 used the engine previously seen in WCW/nWo Revenge. More than 50 WWF wrestlers were included in the game, and, with the exception of existing superstars' move sets, all of them could be edited to the player's liking. Using the same system, the Create-a-Wrestler mode was extensive. The player was able to create a highly detailed wrestler, and there was an extensive library of wrestling moves. Usual WWF modes such as Royal Rumble and King of the Ring modes were included, along with a pay-per-view mode, enabling the player to either recreate or create unique PPVs with TV-style features. Players could also create up to ten belts and then put them on the line.<br/><br/>The story mode placed the player on the long road to WWF glory. Starting out as a rookie, the player would gradually work his way up the ladder and earn opportunities to gain various WWF titles, win various tournaments, be challenged by various wrestlers and ultimately main-event at WrestleMania 2000. Although the story mode was long and extensive in the amount of matches it pitted the player in, there were no branching story lines and if the player lost a match it was recorded as a loss in their win-loss record. In fact, wrestlers were expected to defend each title in Pay-Per-View events. For example, if you held the European Championship, Intercontinental Championship, WWF Tag Team Championship, and the WWF Title, the player would have to fight four fights in one pay-per-view, something that would be unrealistic in real-life. There were often feuds at different parts in the storyline, occasionally with one wrestler calling out another wrestler in the middle of the ring.

Developed by DreamWorks Interactive and published by Electronic Arts, The Lost World: Jurassic Park is based on both the novel by Michael Crichton and Steven Spielberg&rsquo;s film The Lost World: Jurassic Park. A year later a special edition of the game was released for the Sony PlayStation as a part of their Greatest Hits line-up and featured several modifications to the game play.<br/><br/>Gameplay<br/>The player takes control of characters struggling to survive on InGen&rsquo;s &quot;Site B&quot; populated by over 20 species of dinosaurs in an environment of escalating chaos. There are 5 characters in all to choose from, each with their own special abilities and attributes. The game generally features a side-scroller perspective, limiting the player's movement to left and right. Throughout the game, the player will take the role of a Compsognathus, Sarah Harding, a Velociraptor, a Tyrannosaurus, and a human fighting his way through the island. In each level of the game there are &quot;DNA bonuses&quot; that can be collected for access to new characters and storyboard art for that particular character. If every bonus is gained a secret ending (see below) to the game will be accessible. Each character has their own unique attributes and abilities. During gameplay, the character must complete all levels to sequentially gain access to the next character. At the end of the character&rsquo;s chapter, a &quot;DNA&quot; code is given for access to the next character.<br/><br/>Plot<br/>The player begins controlling Comosognathus (in the Special Edition, the player first plays as Tyrannosaurus escaping Jurassic Park) which travels through a forest with dinosaurs such as Staurikosaurus and other dinosaurs. The player then gets caught in a Brachiosaurus herd migration. In the next level, the player is chased by an angry Carnotaurus awakened by him/her. After some caves, a human tries to kill the player using a grenade launcher. The player then controls the same human. (Human Hunter) The player goes into a cave, a cliff, with more dinosaurs. Soon after, the level ends with player now controlling a Velociraptor. The player goes into more places with humans and other dinosaurs as enemies. They soon end up in lava fields with Deinonychus and soon the boss, an Euoplocephalus. The player takes control of one of the Tyrannosaurus. Starting in the lava fields, going to a hot geyser field, in a cave, and to the human camp site. Finally the character takes control of Sarah. (Human Prey) In the first level, the player must escape from the pursuing T. Rex and avoid the obsacles. The second level shows the tyrant dinosaur and raptors in a graveyard. The final level is when the player must kill the stowaway Tyrannosaurus on the boat. After it is brought down, the male T. Rex appears and attacks the player. After it is killed, Sarah escapes Isla Sorna with Velociraptors looking on. If the players collected all DNA bonuses troughout the game, the secret ending will be unlocked. The player received a video E-mail showing Dr. Ian Malcolm (Jeff Goldblum) congratulating the player before he gets scared as a dinosaur approaches, shown as the screen begins to shake. It then ends with the message &quot;Congratulations.

There is always a constant sense of danger and foreboding. Warnings are given, but the characters still try to unravel the mystery, seduced by scraps of knowledge. In the end they discover that the evil of the world is overwhelming and mankind is small, helpless, and unaware of its doom.

We wanted to make a more streamlined game then some of our others - that is one that was easier for someone new to roleplaying games to pick up and work with, and also easier for long time players to pick up, skim and get right into using.<br/><br/>We didn&rsquo;t want to lose any of the detail we appreciate in games, or the system&rsquo;s ability to allow (or create) the suspension of disbelief that a good roleplaying game needs. But we had to reduce the number of numeric values (attributes as they are commonly called) because it was a sticking point in the minds of many people who decided not to use our other games. Numbers scare some people. Lots of numbers, even if you just look at them or add them together on occasion, looks like work to some people. We didn&rsquo;t want to scare everyone (although scaring a few people is not a bad thing if its constructive in its results). We wanted to attract folks to using the game. Why? Because we don&rsquo;t want to be the only Game Managers using the game for a gaming group - we want to share the experience and, hopefully, get to occasionally play as well as GM!<br/><br/>We also needed to reduce the number of dice rolls used during combat. This is hard to do while maintaining realism, as combat is one of the most complex things a roleplaying game has to represent, and has the most variable factors when dealt with in reality.<br/><br/>We also wanted to expand the range of possible characters that players and GMs could make. At the same time we had to make sure that players would feel the mechanics were fair, and did not require them to rely on the whims of the Game Manager in all things. To do this we had to remove some design limits that were imposed in our own game (and those of others) and still find a way of creating a sense of balance within actual game play.<br/><br/>We wanted a system that was colorful, fun, able to be both realistic and occasionally surreal or downright silly. It had to be modular so that other Game Managers could add in features, ideas amd details that they wanted for their specific game style, without destroying our vision on the game. For that matter, we wanted to be able to add in new features and specific mechanics to different settings, so we could explore different aspects of reality, from the burlesque to the sublime. Our system had to be Multi-genre, without being Generic and bland.<br/><br/>Finally we wanted a game mechanic that emphasized cooperation between the players, not competition. And one that offered a balance between the power of the players, and their characters, to affect the game world, and that of the GM when presenting the game world, and the plots the characters encounter as they go thru the exploration called &ldquo;Life.&rdquo;<br/><br/>"}, "90001": {"poll": [], "name": "ZombieSmash", "videogamemode": ["Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["iPad edition", "iPhone edition"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic895603.png", "videogametheme": ["Cartoon", "Horror", "Zombies"], "usersrated": "2", "videogamedeveloper": ["Gamedoctors"], "videogamegenre": ["Tower Defense"], "videogameplatform": ["iPad", "iPhone"], "average": "6.25", "statistics": [], "videogamepublisher": ["Gamedoctors"], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic895603_t.png", "description": "ZombieSmash! is a &bdquo;Survival Comedy&rdquo; game for the iPhone and iPod touch, featuring undead-themed castle defense ans entertaining, physics-based gameplay.<br/><br/>The Game casts players as Joey, a lone survivor pit against a herd of writing, unrelenting zombies &mdash; to defeat the undead masses, players must use their fingers to flick and smash them until they're un-dead.<br/><br/>Source: The Game Website.<br/><br/>"}, "90002": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic900437.jpg", "poll": [], "boardgamedesigner": ["Perry Moore"], "statistics": [], "yearpublished": "2011", "maxplayers": "2", "boardgameartist": ["Mark Mahaffey"], "boardgamepublisher": ["Against the Odds", "LPS, Inc."], "maxplaytime": "280", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic900437_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "280", "boardgamecategory": ["Vietnam War", "Wargame"], "boardgamehonor": ["2011 Charles S.

Rapid collapse of South Vietnamese (ARVN) forces caused a change in plan, with PAVN forces quickly taking one city after another, pausing only before an attack on Saigon itself. Based on previous performance, when three full PAVN divisions, supported by tanks and ample artillery, attacked one depleted ARVN division at Xu&acirc;n L\u1ed9c, Dung expected a cake walk. What he got was a Meatgrinder instead.<br/><br/>For two bloody weeks, a division regarded as &quot;unreliable&quot; held back everything the PAVN could throw against them, inflicting heavy losses. No one, on either side, expected such heavy fighting. And hardly anyone thought that this would actually be &quot;the last battle&quot; of a 30 year conflict. It was.<br/><br/>Now, Against the Odds lets you refight this key moment in history, with Meatgrinder: Battle for  Xu&acirc;n L\u1ed9c, 1975. The design uses a variable initiative system that keeps both sides uncertain, and features all the weapon systems that made this battle, and this period, so distinctive.

Arms can be used as clubs to fight enemies.<br/><br/>Throughout the game, Rick can collect blood from defeated enemies. Collecting a certain amount will allow the player to unlock new moves and perform special attacks. Players can find journals documenting Dr. West's history while photos of Rick's girlfriend serve as a breadcrumb trail to follow.

There is also a platforming element with jump nodes to keep instant death falls to a minimum.<br/><br/>The game also comes with the original Splatterhouse arcade game, Splatterhouse 2 and Splatterhouse 3 as unlockables.<br/><br/>Plot<br/><br/>Jennifer Willis is to have a interview with Dr. Henry West M.D., professor of necrobiology, at his house. Her boyfriend, Rick Taylor, comes along so nothing bad happens. Just as Rick is about to propose to Jennifer, the two are attacked by Dr. West's experiments, kidnapping Jennifer and leaving Rick mortally wounded. Rick knocks over a sarcophagus revealing a mask. Close to death, the Terror Mask calls out to Rick, saying it will save him and help save Jenny if he puts it on. Having no choice, Rick puts the mask on and is transformed into a hulking beast powered by the blood of others.<br/><br/>Rick follows Dr. West and Jennifer through other dimensions and time periods and learns of Dr. West's plan to bring dark deities, known as &quot;The Corrupted&quot;, into this world by sacrificing Jennifer. Dr. West believes The Corrupted will resurrect his dead love Leonora, who bears an uncanny resemblance to Jennifer. The Corrupted intended to lay waste to Earth instead. It is revealed Rick was the one who supposedly killed Leonora, according to Dr. West, who witnessed it. In truth, she was burnt in a wicker man by a witch hunting mob, who were possessed by demons. In an attempt to save Leonora, thinking she was Jennifer, Rick was attacked by her reanimated corpse, forcing him to kill her.<br/><br/>In the end, Rick succeeds in rescuing Jennifer and thwarting West's plans. However, West still managed to summon one of the Corrupted, which constructs itself by using all of the experiments Rick killed. Rick manages to kill it, but in the process, a stray spirit possesses Jennifer. Believing his deal with the Mask to be done, he tries to pry it off. However, aware of Jennifer's possession, it refuses.

Rick and Jennifer have since married and have a son named David. Rick has also become successful on Wall Street and has bought a mansion in Connecticut, putting the memories of the Terror Mask behind him. Meanwhile, the Mask feels the ancient energy that it recalls from ages past and begins to speak to Rick. Rick once more dons the mask and must fight the monsters that have invaded his mansion. Rick first fights to save Jennifer, who has been kidnapped by the Evil One, but it is revealed this was only a distraction while the Evil One took David.<br/><br/>Rick eventually defeats an entity known as the Evil One, who had planned to use David's latent psychic abilities to unlock the power of an object known as the Dark Stone. Upon defeating the Evil One, the Mask reveals its true, evil intentions. Rick must then destroy the Terror Mask permanently<br/><br/>Gameplay<br/><br/>Splatterhouse 3 dramatically changes the gameplay from the game's before it. Rick's environment is now much larger. The game features six levels, many taking place in the mansion. Instead of the side-scrolling action of the previous games, Splatterhouse 3 features non-linear exploration throughout several different rooms, forcing Rick to often backtrack as he tries to find the exit. Players are given a map of each level.<br/><br/>A timer has been introduced to the gameplay. Each level must be cleared in a certain amount of time. Although this does not affect gameplay, running out of time results in changes in the plot, creating four possible endings. By running out of time, for example, Jennifer will be killed in the second level. New to Splatterhouse is the Power Meter, which can be filled by collecting Eldritch Orbs found throughout levels and occasionally are dropped by defeated enemies. Once full, the player can transform Rick into a hulking and more monstrous version of himself with the Terror Mask being seemingly fused to his head. In this state, Rick is significantly stronger and can execute a special attack that involves pieces of his flesh extending from his chest area and acting as a weapon, injuring any monster in the vicinity of their reach. Also, instead of actually wielding the weapons he finds, the mutated version of Rick simply flings them at enemies, dealing a fair bit more damage than swinging the weapons as normal Rick would have. Extra lives and health items are also scattered throughout the levels. Passwords are also given to players to return to levels.<br/><br/>Occasionally, Rick is able to pick up weapons (i.e. a baseball bat or a cleaver, among others) to use against the monsters. Once you defeat all the monsters in the room an in-game map appears to give you some choice in how you get to the end of each level. The game's storyline alters significantly if you fail to finish levels before the allotted time runs out. For example; in the second level you are tasked with saving Rick's wife Jennifer from being devoured by a boreworm. In order to save her, you must reach the end of the level to confront and defeat the boreworm within the time limit. Failing to do so before time runs out will result in Jennifer being devoured internally by the boreworm planted inside of her body.<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;Splatterhouse 3,&quot; available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "90074": {"poll": [], "name": "Atlantis (1985)", "videogamemode": ["Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["French Amstrad CPC cassette edition"], "average": "0", "videogametheme": ["Mythology", "Ocean / Sea"], "usersrated": "0", "videogamedeveloper": ["Cobra Soft"], "videogamegenre": ["Text Adventure"], "videogameplatform": ["Amstrad CPC"], "statistics": [], "videogamepublisher": ["Cobra Soft"], "description": "User Summary<br/><br/>While on a cruise, you wake up one day to find the captain and the only crew member dead.

It may be the most powerful accumulation of mythical knowledge anywhere in Glorantha: it may also be the most dangerous.<br/><br/>The Abiding Book for Second Age Glorantha is a highly detailed overview of the Middle Sea Empire: its people, its territories and dominions, its hopes, schemes and ambitions, its myths and its magic. Within these pages you will find a wealth of information concerning every aspect of God Learnerism. From descriptions of its great cities through to profiles of its psychology. The nature of sorcery and the empire's approach to it is examined and the book offers more spells, new grimoires and new sorcery orders to fuel God Learner campaigns. With this book you have everything you need to explore the Middle Sea Empire and create compelling God Learner characters.<br/><br/>"}, "90090": {"rpgartist": ["Junichi Inoue", "Mark Schumann"], "rpg": ["Mekton Zeta"], "statistics": [], "name": "Mekton Wars 1: Invasion Terra", "rpgdesigner": ["Michael MacDonald", "Craig Sheeley", "Benjamin Wright (I)"], "rpgproducer": ["Michael MacDonald", "Mark Schumann", "Ted Talsorian"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1212365.jpg", "usersrated": "3", "rpgitemversion": ["Soft Cover Vesrion"], "average": "8", "rpggenre": ["Animation / Comics (Anime / Manga)", "Mecha"], "rpgpublisher": ["R.

In the Nintendo Entertainment System and arcade editions of the game the five animals are penguin, bear, panda, shimmying koala and beaver. In each game, the participating animals find each other on opposite sides of a square table with five balls on each side. The object of the game is to roll those balls over the table. As soon as all ten balls are on one player's side, that player loses the game. Each game also has a time limit of 60 seconds; if that is reached, the player with the fewest balls on their side wins.<br/><br/>If a player is hit by one of the balls, they are knocked unconscious for a certain amount of time. Thus, it could also be said that part of the object of the game is to hit the opponent, as otherwise it would not be possible to get all ten balls to the other side (the opponent can just roll them back before all of them have arrived).<br/><br/>The different animals have different strengths and weaknesses which are a trade-off with each other. For example, the rat is the one that can move left and right the fastest, but in return he can roll the balls only very slowly. The cow, on the other hand, is a very slow walker, but in return she regains consciousness quicker.<br/><br/>After 30 seconds of playing, a jellybean-like obstacle appears in the middle of the table which moves left and right. Different kinds of these obstacles cause varying effects on the trajectory of the balls; some deflect them so they start rolling diagonally (the players themselves can only roll them parallel to the sides of the table), whereas others simply have the ball bounce straight back.<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;Penguin Wars&quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "90095": {"poll": [], "name": "Legends of Wrestling II", "videogamemode": ["Local Multiplayer", "Network Multiplayer", "Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["German Xbox edition", "UK GBA edition", "US GameCube edition", "US GBA edition", "US PlayStation 2 edition", "US Xbox edition"], "average": "7", "videogameseries": ["Legends of Wrestling"], "videogametheme": ["Sports - Wrestling"], "usersrated": "1", "videogamedeveloper": ["Acclaim Entertainment Inc."], "videogamegenre": ["Sports"], "videogameplatform": ["Game Boy Advance", "GameCube", "PlayStation 2", "Xbox"], "statistics": [], "videogamepublisher": ["Acclaim Entertainment Inc."], "description": "Legends of Wrestling II is the sequel to the professional wrestling video game Legends of Wrestling.
