Each player then draws from the Thumb-Servants deck, drawing and keeping cards based on each player's Cat Fancier card. Then the players check to see which cats are hungry, deciding whether to call the ASPCA to pick up the hungry cats (which also may cause the player to lose other cats) or allow the cats to go feral, placing them in the Wild on the table.<br/><br/>The game ends when one or more players has 10 or more cats or if the City deck runs out of cards.<br/><br/>Points are then scored based on the number of cats each player has and any bonuses they may have received from Crazy Cat cards and Cat Fancier cards.

The dealer begins the first trick of the game; after that, each trick begins when the last player to take a trick takes the top card of the deck, places it face-up on the table, and announces its value. Starting with the player to his or her left, and proceeding clockwise, each player must play a card from his or her hand on the trick, calculate the sum of all cards in the trick, and announce the sum.<br/><br/>Card Values: 2 through 10 are worth their face value. Aces are worth 1 or 11 (declared when played). Jacks are worth 0 points, Queens are worth -2 points, and Kings are worth -4 points.<br/><br/>If the sum is less than 21, play continues normally. If you bring the sum to exactly 21, you take the trick. If you push the sum over 21, the player to your right takes the trick, for forcing you to exceed 21. When you take a trick, add one to your score, and gather the cards from the trick into a pile face-down in front of you. Once taken, the cards from a trick may not be looked at.<br/><br/>All hidden rules are also in play. Each combination of a trigger and an action is a rule. It&rsquo;s up to you to enforce (or not) a rule that you know about. When you enforce a rule, you must give the person information to indicate in what way their action violated the rule. The information you provide must be more specific than the violation. If you violate a rule, take back the card you played (if applicable), lose a point, and your turn ends (if it&rsquo;s your turn).<br/><br/>For example, trigger #13 says, &ldquo;When you play a card that makes the total exactly zero&hellip;&rdquo; and action #5 says, &ldquo;&hellip;Name a Peanuts character that hasn&rsquo;t been named previously this game before you announce the sum of the trick.&rdquo; If I make the total 0 and don&rsquo;t say anything, you can make me take back my card and say, &ldquo;You didn&rsquo;t say a name.&rdquo; The next time I make the total 0, If I say, &ldquo;Neil Armstrong,&rdquo; you can correct me again and say, &ldquo;Neil Armstrong isn&rsquo;t fictional.&rdquo;<br/><br/>The first player to end a round with 3 or more points more wins.<br/><br/>This game owes a lot to the children&rsquo;s &ldquo;folk game&rdquo; Mao.<br/><br/>"}, "128015": {"boardgamedesigner": ["Jonathan Leistiko"], "poll": [], "name": "Birthday Party, Cheesecake, Jelly Bean, Boom!", "playingtime": "20", "minplayers": "3", "boardgamemechanic": ["Trick-taking"], "yearpublished": "2009", "usersrated": "0", "maxplayers": "6", "average": "0", "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["(Web published)", "Invisible City Productions"], "boardgameversion": ["Print & Play edition"], "maxplaytime": "20", "boardgamecategory": ["Card Game", "Print & Play"], "age": "0", "minplaytime": "20", "description": "A very, very lightweight trick-taking game for three to six R.E.M. fans.<br/><br/>Goal: End the game with the most points.

Humans also discover Na'rul jump-gates, and use this technology to explore space and locate valuable resources. In Gene Effect, the player pilots a small mining craft and explores dark caverns filled with exotic and sometimes foreboding vegetation. The goal is to locate and mine several types of ore, depositing it at depots before exiting via jump gate. The craft is sensitive to collisions and other threats, but its nano-hull slowly regenerates. A sonar tool allows players to clear debris such as stalacites, and also to expose hidden ore deposits. On occasion, the craft is equipped with a missle-like &quot;T-drone&quot; as well.

A mysterious death and possible theft are the Saint-Germain legacy. In a small Southern town, that which rises will not be put down. Hard-boiled gumshoes investigate magical crimes in the twisted '50s. Soldiers hunt down and destroy horrible elder beings in Project M.A.G.I. Punk rock channels magic stolen from the Devil, live... from New Amsterdam.<br/><br/>This book is a collection of the first nine Mortal Coil campaign frames, plus one additional bonus campaign frame available only in this compilation. A copy of the core Mortal Coil rules is required to use these in your Mortal Coil game.<br/><br/>A campaign frame is a fully sketched out setting in the form of a detailed theme document, with all of the world set-up choices written out in detail. These are designed to be customizable by your game group. Each frame contains options for more than one tone and magic level. You choose a tone and pick the magic level that is appropriate for your game. Players then create characters, or choose one of the characters listed in the campaign frame, and you can begin play immediately.<br/><br/>Campaign frames are great ways to do a quick setup for Mortal Coil, and are ideal for playing a pick-up game or convention game. If your players really like the setting, the frame can be used for a longer term game as well. A campaign frame is also useful as a how-to on setting up a unique theme document of your own.<br/><br/>User note: the campaign frames previously released and included are Divinity, Hag Ride, Old Gods, Project M.A.G.I., The Saint-Germain Legacy, Soul Train, Swords of Astagar, That Which Rises, and Twisted 50s.<br/><br/>"}, "128058": {"rpgartist": ["Cliff Kurowski"], "rpgitemversion": ["PDF version", "Unlimited Edition"], "poll": [], "name": "The Agency (2nd Edition)", "rpghonor": ["2011 Indie RPG Award - Game of the Year - Runner-Up"], "rpgproducer": ["Andrew Kenrick", "Frances Machell"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic559123.jpg", "usersrated": "4", "rpgdesigner": ["Matt Machell"], "average": "6.5", "statistics": [], "rpg": ["The Agency"], "rpgpublisher": ["Realms Publishing"], "rpgcategory": ["Core Rules (min needed to play)"], "rpggenre": ["Crime (Spy / Espionage)", "History (Britain / Ireland)", "Horror (Supernatural)"], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic559123_t.jpg", "description": "From publisher blurb:<br/><br/>1960s London<br/><br/>A world of red telephone boxes, Bentleys, Union Jack waistcoats, velvet jackets, bowler hats, the Beatles, Bobbies, eccentrics, Hippies, the Cold War and miniskirts.

Five building cards are placed face-up in the Great Works area and can be built by the players; any time a building is taken from this area, reveal another building card.<br/><br/>On a turn, you first move any card(s) played the previous turn to the forum, then you either Command or Plot.

For each Production activity you have, take the action again.<br/>    Exploration: Place one card from your hand into your stock. Repeat for each Exploration activity.<br/>    Draconians: Show one card from your hand, then move one card of this type from the forum to your stock; in addition, each player who commanded in his previous turn must give you a card of the same type from his hand, if possible. For each Draconians activity you have, you can show one more card, which lets you claim more from the forum and possibly more from opponents.<br/>    Trade: Transform one resource in your stock to an activity.

The game is set in the fantasy world of Triskearth, a brand new world utterly created by the designers of the game. Its history and geography, as well as the background for every race, are described in the first 150 pages of the rulebook. The remaining twenty pages describe the gaming rules, bringing to life a fast &amp; furios game of tactic and bashing!<br/><br/>The game is played on a 11 x 16 squares field, each team can field on the pitch seven payers. Every team (are planned to be released nearly thirty teams) has its own rooster of players, each one with its stats (movement, strength, agility, constitution, ball play), skills and costs, including three different captains. The game time is divided in two halves each one made up of six turns for each player. Turns are played alternatively by each player, completing the action of a single player before passing to the next one. The aim of the game is to score more points (goals or kicks over the crossbar) than the opponent, and you can achieve this with a passing/dodging style or with a more brutal one. Someone could recognize a gameplay similar to other games concerning sports, but this is not a great flaw since Tutatis has it's peculiar flavor thanks to the rules of gaelic football (ie. not forward passage, soloing rule exc.) and to the characterization of each team.<br/><br/>Greebo miniatures has produced a prerelease box of the game (with rules still in beta) at the 2011 Lucca Comics &amp; Games convention, and it was a sold out. That box contained a cardboard field, Italian rulebook, two Greebo's d6, a ball and two teams in 15mm (orcs and dwarves). Since then on Greebo's website have been published in English and in Italian the definitive set of rules and the roosters for the new teams, all available as free downloads. At the moment have been released three kinds of fields (irond peak, thornwell and standard), the miniatures of some mercenaries and nine teams: orcs, dwarves, evil puppets, necros, poffy and five different teams of thornwell (frogs, lizards, turtles, snakes and a mixed team). Greebo's team is working on the championship rules expected to be released as open beta in mid autumn 2012, as well as on a new edition of the game box. It's also on the desk the translation of the rules in french and spanish.<br/><br/>"}, "128083": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1371848.png", "poll": [], "boardgamedesigner": ["Sandra Dochtermann"], "statistics": [], "yearpublished": "2006", "maxplayers": "4", "boardgameartist": ["Jan Birck", "Bluguy"], "boardgamepublisher": ["KOSMOS"], "maxplaytime": "20", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1371848_t.png", "minplaytime": "20", "boardgamecategory": ["Movies / TV / Radio theme", "Novel-based", "Party Game", "Sports", "Trivia"], "description": "Objective: gather most quiz cards finding correct answers<br/> - acting by turn -<br/>1. players come to an understanding which side to use (blue or red)<br/>2. depending on no. of players each one is dealt 3-6 cards <br/>3. active player asks first question - multiple choice (left neighbour); if wrong, next player's turn; if correct, second question is asked;<br/>4. right? hand card over! wrong? next player may answer if he/she bets (an already won) card; wrong? give back risked card - questioned card is taken out, too.<br/>5. game ends after all cards are played.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": ["First edition"], "age": "8", "name": "Die wilden Fu\u00dfballkerle  Verquizzt nochmal!", "playingtime": "20", "boardgamemechanic": ["Betting/Wagering", "Card Drafting"], "average": "2", "usersrated": "1", "boardgamefamily": ["Sports: Football / Soccer", "Die wilden Fussballkerle"]}, "128084": {"poll": [], "name": "Chase the Mouse", "playingtime": "0", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": ["Hand Management"], "yearpublished": "0", "usersrated": "2", "boardgamefamily": ["Animals: Mice"], "maxplayers": "0", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1371686_t.jpg", "average": "4.5", "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["Arrow Games Ltd"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1371686.jpg", "boardgameversion": ["Arrow First Edition"], "maxplaytime": "0", "boardgamecategory": ["Animals", "Card Game", "Children's Game"], "age": "0", "minplaytime": "0", "description": "Object: To be the last player left in the game.<br/>Contents: 36 cards<br/><br/>Before you begin, find 3 tokens (buttons, sweets etc.) for each player.

Please only submit images if you own a copy or have legal access to this item.<br/><br/>    <br/><br/><br/>Enter the world of Wicked Crush, where a centuries-spanning war between humans and beastmen dictates life. But in the isolated beastmen town of Rosachelia, where you (as either a dude or a chick) fall from the sky, it's the almighty dollar that reigns.<br/><br/>The town's entire economy revolves around profiting from the lives of adventurers foolish enough to enter Dynidar, the seemingly endless, constantly changing dungeon that borders the town. The townspeople provide the sales of items, services in forging equipment and even renovate the dungeon to make it deadlier. Despite this seemingly grim lifestyle, the townsfolk are actually quite friendly. Sharing a common interest in getting that paper, you are quickly welcomed among the Rosachelian people. It is then that you decide to be the first to reach the bottom depths of Dynidar and discover the endless riches and dark secrets that await.<br/><br/><br/>Wicked Crush is a PC game designed around the concept of an online game where you play alone, but everything you do has a direct effect on other players.<br/><br/>Taking inspiration from classic action games like Castlevania and Mega Man, along with modern games like Demon's Souls, Little Big Planet, Persona 4 and Ys, the game promises to meld the responsive controls and compact movesets of old with unique online functionality, player-generated content, and beautiful, high definition, frame-by-frame 2D animation.<br/><br/>The player's ultimate goal is to reach the deepest levels of Dynidar, each floor is actually made by another player pulled from an online server. If you complete the floor without dying, you will find gold or valuables at the end, and the creator of the floor will receive a small amount of gold. However, if you die, the floor's creator earns a much larger sum. What this ultimately means is that players are rewarded for making crafty levels that rake in the deaths.<br/><br/>This use of player-generated content creates the unique challenge to giving the game a fair learning curve, slowly increasing difficulty while adding mechanics, and ensuring that the aesthetics remain cohesive. This is being achieved by grouping floors together into &ldquo;tiers&rdquo;, each of which has a specific amount and types of enemies and traps that may be employed, combined with a constantly updating ratio of successful and failed runs to determine how easy or difficult a floor is, where in Dynidar it should be placed, and how big the payout for completing it should be.<br/><br/>Between dungeon runs, the player will return to the town of Rosachelia. In town, players can rest, talk to the townsfolk, purchase items (such as potions, temporary strength supplements, and signs to leave behind for other players), upgrade their equipment, and build floors for Dynidar.<br/><br/>Source: The Game Website.<br/><br/>"}, "128096": {"poll": [], "name": "Knightfall 2", "videogamemode": ["Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["Web Browser edition"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1377603.jpg", "videogameseries": ["Knightfall"], "videogametheme": ["Fantasy", "Medieval"], "usersrated": "1", "videogamecharacter": ["Knight (knightfall)"], "videogamedeveloper": ["Armor Games"], "videogamegenre": ["Puzzle"], "videogameplatform": ["Web Browser"], "average": "7.9", "statistics": [], "videogamepublisher": ["(Self-Published)"], "vgcharacterversion": ["Knight (knightfall 2)"], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1377603_t.jpg", "description": "User Summary<br/><br/>Knightfall 2 is the sequel to Knightfall, a puzzle-RPG in which Knight, the main, knightly character ventures across a world of peril at the command of his wife, who has become disgruntled with Knight's early retirement.<br/><br/>Featuring the same drill-toting Knight, Knightfall 2 involves similar game-play to its prequel: removing like coloured blocks and rotating the board so as to place Knight above his foes or to procure either treasure or the key for the level exit.

The aim is to score 10,000 or more points (although with 6 or more players you can decide to play to say 5,000 or 7,500).<br/><br/>There are 110 cards - 14 each of 1-6, 22 Farkles and 4 score summary cards. A score-keeper is chosen. Each player is dealt one card BUT all players can play off anyone else's cards. The rest of the deck is placed in the middle of the table and each player takes it in turn to draw one card from the deck then place it in front of himself or another player. The goal is to create combinations that score (eg three 1s = 300 points, three 6s = 600 points, six of any number = 3,000 points, five Farkles = 2,000 points and so on). If you create a winning combination you can either slide it to the centre of the table for potential scoring or leave it where it is to try and build a bigger score. You can stop drawing at any time and score any cards you've placed in the centre. However if at any time you draw a Farkle card you MUSt stop drawing, any cards in the centre can't be scored and become part of the face-up cards in front of you. You keep your Farkle card to one side and no other players may take it but you may use it to score later. Farkle cards are scored whenever their owner chooses and are then placed face down. There are some other interesting rules about play. If cards run out all face down cards are shuffled and a new centre deck formed.

The game comes in both a standard and collector&rsquo;s edition and is played on an oversized game board with 172 miniature commanders and 126 brigade counters. The collector&rsquo;s edition comes with life-like pewter miniatures on a magnetized metal game board for stability, and a carved wood base with drawers for storing the miniatures.<br/> In lieu of the game&rsquo;s dice and chart system, attacking and defending units can enter their strength, location, and orientation into the Interactive Game App (IGA) which then simulates the battle conditions to determine results. A unit&rsquo;s strength is represented by possible Combat Factors on a brigade counter encircling a rotating miniature. The miniature is turned toward lower numbers as casualties are taken or is increased up to full strength as depleted units are merged into it. Reinforcement, Supply, and Morale Cards also affect the Combat Factor and randomness of game play.<br/><br/>The game also uses a Double Turn Rule where after the initial attack, both the attacker and defender may move all of their units one hexagon, defenders first. This allows both sides to retreat, stand, or bring up reinforcements during the turn. Units still in contact fight each other one more time before the turn ends. Artillery has a range of four hexagons and is only required to engage in battle if the enemy&rsquo;s artillery is in range.<br/><br/>Incremental casualties, merging and resupplying units, and double-turn combat combine to recreate actual conditions, while the IGA cuts playing time in half. Tactical skill, not luck prevails, and the winner may rewrite history.<br/><br/>"}, "128183": {"poll": [], "name": "The Wicked Willie Game", "playingtime": "45", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": ["Card Drafting", "Dice Rolling", "Roll / Spin and Move"], "yearpublished": "1988", "usersrated": "1", "maxplayers": "6", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1375214_t.jpg", "average": "2.5", "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["Paul Lamond Games Ltd"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1375214.jpg", "boardgameversion": ["English Edition"], "maxplaytime": "45", "boardgamecategory": ["Humor", "Mature / Adult", "Party Game"], "age": "0", "minplaytime": "45", "description": "This board game for adult on a hen do or in another party or good natured fun setting.

However, the destruction and violence that gave rise to their birth also tainted the dragons, driving them mad with a lust for war. Now the dragons not only battle humanity, but themselves. Ruthlessly hunting for the dragon eggs to satiate their endless hunger for power, the dragons wage an eternal struggle for dominance and the very soul of Earth.<br/><br/>In Dragon Clash, you are the dragon, hatching your beast from a variety of decks geared towards a specific breed and play style. The core set of Dragon Clash includes the Red Breather, Blue Adept, Silver Channeler, and Brown Mauler decks. Each deck of 72-cards includes a dragon and a variety of attacks unique to that deck&rsquo;s theme.<br/><br/>To claim victory, your dragon must win the opponent&rsquo;s Dragon Egg Card. You can do this by either forcing your opponent to discard his Dragon Egg or by consuming your opponent&rsquo;s hoard with a Feast card, while a Dragon Egg is hidden there. Players take turns feeding their dragon&rsquo;s hoard, aging from hatchling to elder wyrm, training a variety of attacks, and engaging in combat. Executing attacks, playing effects, and taking damage depletes your dragon&rsquo;s Essence (the playing deck) and when a player&rsquo;s dragon has exhausted all of their Essence, they must flee and lose the game.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": ["English first edition", "English Limited edition 2013"], "age": "8", "name": "Dragon Clash", "playingtime": "30", "boardgamemechanic": ["Area Movement", "Campaign / Battle Card Driven", "Hand Management", "Variable Player Powers"], "average": "6.77273", "usersrated": "11", "boardgamefamily": ["Animals: Dragons", "Crowdfunding: Kickstarter"]}, "128190": {"boardgamedesigner": ["Timm Lossen"], "poll": [], "name": "Pusteblumen", "playingtime": "45", "minplayers": "3", "boardgamemechanic": ["Card Drafting", "Co-operative Play"], "yearpublished": "1983", "usersrated": "0", "maxplayers": "6", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1375607_t.png", "average": "0", "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["Homo Ludens"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1375607.png", "boardgameversion": ["First edition"], "maxplaytime": "45", "boardgamecategory": ["Card Game", "Educational", "Environmental", "Racing"], "age": "8", "minplaytime": "45", "description": "Objective: gather most victory points by racing on &amp; cleaning a meadow<br/> - acting/moving by turn -<br/>each player draws slides forming a meadow; according the number of blowballs your meeple may move forward - the further the higher the score; but if there isn't space enough to move players create environmental damage, too.<br/>During the second phase players move back, cleaning up the waste they've generated.

If the spinner points toward one of the kiss symbols, the active player gets the corresponding number of kiss tokens. If it points toward the golden ball, the active player gets the ball token (there is only one ball token, and it constantly changes its owner according to the spinner's results). A player can try rescuing the prince as soon as he/she has collected 3 kisses and the golden ball. To rescue the prince, the cylinder has to be put on the correct lily pad.

One hexagon movement is free, if you want to move more you need to spend boost. If a player has no more boost then all its abilities are divided by two.<br/>- After the movement, if the defender has a player in the same hex as the ball, he could try some actions; For example, to steal the ball or tackle. If the offense still has the ball, he can try to shoot or pass.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": ["Multilingual first edition"], "average": "7.04349", "name": "Helvetia Cup", "playingtime": "45", "boardgamemechanic": ["Simulation"], "age": "10", "boardgameexpansion": ["190594", "190593", "190548", "190595"], "usersrated": "160", "boardgamefamily": ["Country: Switzerland", "Fantasy Sports"], "boardgamepodcastepisode": ["Episode 5: Via Appia/Gaming Stereotypes"]}, "128219": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1374975.jpg", "poll": [], "boardgamedesigner": ["Christophe Borgeat"], "statistics": [], "yearpublished": "2012", "maxplayers": "6", "boardgameartist": ["Lorenzo Mastroianni"], "boardgamepublisher": ["Helvetia Games"], "maxplaytime": "120", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1374975_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "120", "boardgamecategory": ["Economic", "Fantasy", "Industry / Manufacturing"], "description": "While digging on the slopes of Mount Ego, the Dwarves of Shafausa discovered a secret passage under the falls of the river Rain. From there they gained access into a subterranean world of obscure galleries and gigantic caves, full of immeasurable wealth. The exploitation of this area rapidly assured the small tribe a lifestyle far superior to anything previously known in Helvetia. Their neighbours, the Vampires of Zugriga, immediately realised the fantastic commercial potential of these discoveries. Thanks to a clever stock exchange system, they implicated the other Helvetian tribes in their dealings, for the joy and well-being of all &ndash; or so they claimed.<br/><br/>But wealth doesn't just fall from the sky, and it takes a good dose of know-how to be able to rival with the skill of a vampire...<br/><br/>In Shafausa, each player represents a Helvetian tribe that has come to propose a new monetary system based on an exchange of resources. Each round players can make purchases (buildings, mines, warehouses) and exchange currency &ndash; and through these transactions influence the stock market for the prosperity of their region. Each player holds three Power cards with special actions, but can use only one during the game as the other two are then removed from play. The game lasts a number of rounds, with each round having seven phases:<br/><br/><br/>    Extraction: Mines and certain buildings produce resources, with some buildings affecting how many resources something produces.<br/>    Order of Play: Players bid for turn order; as players drop from the bidding, they place their marker in line relative to those who have previously dropped out, so whoever stays in the longest can get the position he wants.<br/>    Buying and Constructing: In turn order, players buy at most one available building and construct two warehouses; alternatively, a player can pay to remove a building in order to make space for new buildings next round.<br/>    Management: Players can build mines, add miners to their workforce, construct purchased buildings, buy and sell resources, and construct new towns.<br/>    Administration: Players pay for buildings in reserve and check their resource limits; resource costs are adjusted based on past sales.<br/>    Speculation: In turn order, players pay to adjust the prices of various resources, with each price marker being adjustable only once.<br/>    End of Game Check: If one of a player's towns or warehouses has been filled, the game ends. Players then score points for their towns, mines, buildings, and so on, and the player with the most points wins.<br/><br/><br/>In addition to this &quot;Geek&quot; version of the rules, Shafausa includes a &quot;Colonial&quot; version in which players draft start-up tiles (instead of starting with pre-determined characters who come with specific buildings, funds, etc.) and a &quot;Family&quot; version that removes the &quot;Speculation&quot; phase, simplifies turn order, and otherwise makes the game less involved.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": ["Multilingual first edition"], "average": "6.13325", "name": "Shafausa", "playingtime": "120", "boardgamemechanic": ["Stock Holding", "Trading"], "age": "8", "usersrated": "120", "boardgamesubdomain": ["Strategy Games"], "boardgamefamily": ["Country: Switzerland"], "boardgamepodcastepisode": ["TDT - Episode # 321 - Replacement Games", "TDT - Episode # 322 - Games from our Childhood"]}, "128220": {"poll": [], "name": "Pinball Arcade", "videogamemode": ["Hotseat", "Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["Android edition", "European PlayStation 4 edition", "iPhone/iPad edition", "Macintosh Downloadable edition", "North American Playstation 4 Blu-Ray edition", "OUYA edition", "PlayStation 3 PSN edition", "PlayStation 4 PSN edition", "PlayStation Vita PSN edition", "Windows Downloadable edition", "Xbox 360 XBLA edition"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1958927.jpg", "videogametheme": ["Fairy Tale", "Fantasy", "Space"], "usersrated": "19", "videogameexpansion": ["Pinball Arcade DLC 35: Addams Family", "Pinball Arcade DLC 36: Cyclone", "Stern Pinball Arcade", "Table Pack 10: Attack From Mars and Genie", "Table Pack 11: Dr. Dude and His Excellent Ray and Firepower", "Table Pack 12: Cactus Canyon and Central Park", "Table Pack 13: White Water and Space Shuttle", "Table Pack 14: Centaur and Pin\u2022Bot", "Table Pack 15: The Champion Pub and Whirlwind", "Table Pack 16: Flight 2000 and Goin' Nuts", "Table Pack 17: Terminator 2: Judgment Day", "Table Pack 18: Haunted House and Tee'd Off", "Table Pack 19: Class of 1812 and Victory", "Table Pack 1: Medieval Madness and Bride of Pin\u2022Bot", "Table Pack 20: Cue Ball Wizard and El Dorado City of Gold", "Table Pack 2: Cirqus Voltaire and Funhouse", "Table Pack 3: Monster Bash and Gorgar", "Table Pack 4: Creature from the Black Lagoon and Black Knight", "Table Pack 5: Harley Davidson and Taxi", "Table Pack 6: Elvira and the Party Monsters and No Good Gofers", "Table Pack 7: Scared Stiff and Big Shot", "Table Pack 8: Twilight Zone", "Table Pack 9: Star Trek: The Next Generation"], "videogamedeveloper": ["FarSight Studios"], "videogamegenre": ["Pinball"], "videogameplatform": ["Android", "iPad", "iPhone", "Macintosh", "OUYA", "PlayStation 3", "PlayStation 4", "PlayStation Vita", "Windows", "Xbox 360"], "average": "7.97368", "statistics": [], "videogamepublisher": ["Alliance Digital Media", "Crave Entertainment", "FarSight Studios", "Sony Computer Entertainment", "System 3"], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1958927_t.jpg", "description": "With many of the all-time greatest tables from Williams&reg;, Bally&reg;, Stern Pinball&reg;, and Gottlieb&reg;; The Pinball Arcade&trade; is set to become the most realistic and comprehensive pinball game ever created!<br/>The first four tables is Tales of the Arabian Nights&trade;, Ripley's Believe It or Not&trade;, Theatre of Magic&trade;, and Black Hole&trade;.<br/>Our goal is for the Pinball Arcade to become the most realistic and comprehensive pinball game ever created!<br/><br/>Source: The Game Website.<br/><br/>User Summary:<br/><br/>The Pinball Arcade is free to download on many platforms.

Largest extra-solar colony of the Human Diaspora, with ~1.5 million souls inhabiting the planets, moons and orbitals scattered throughout the system. <br/>Time: The year 2645, approximately 9 months after the Earth went dark.<br/><br/>You've heard the old miner's tales about Perdition, the sister world of our lovely colony, Confucius, right?  Well, if what you heard sounded bad, then it's most likely true.  Perdition is the only other planet in the Goldilocks (liquid water) Zone of the system primary - HR511 - but where Confucius is an Earth Analogue, a near paradise, Perdition is about as close to being the opposite as you can get. While Perdition is reported to have a breathable atmosphere, the biosphere is shattered and the clouds which boil above that devastated world are said to hold dangers that no sane man has returned to describe.<br/><br/>So why would anyone want to go there?  Well it's a miner's paradise, with rich pickings among the rings circling that cursed world.  Mining the rings is fine.  It's just not recommended to go to the surface, that's all.<br/><br/>And yet, the surface is exactly where you, your crew-mates, and your plucky little transport ship have been chartered to go.  Somehow, MentAI - an AI research and production corporation with few assets in the colonies - have managed not only to get down to the surface safely, but they've succeeded in setting up a research facility there.  From all the stories you've heard about Perdition, this job is NOT a good idea, but the MentAI representatives insist that the goods you've been entrusted to deliver are sorely needed, that they will provide you instructions to transit safely through the cloud layer on arrival in orbit, and that the pay, well, that's simply phenomenal!  Of course it's contingent on the whole crew keeping their mouths shut, but that's not unusual when dealing with the Colonial Corps.  So it's straight in, deliver the goods, get the consignment note signed off, and get the hell out.  Simple, right?<br/><br/>Well it might have been, without loose lips discussing things before you even lifted from Confucius, shifty researchers awaiting their 'precious cargo,' and competing factions buying off the crew.  And then there's that sealed, powered, cargo container squatting in the middle of the hold.  That thing is just weird...  it's been drawing increasingly more power from the ship, and as your transport approaches it's destination, the cargo officer reports that the electronic lock on the container has logged that it has been accessed in the last sleep cycle, which breaches the contract the entire crew signed...<br/><br/>Transit to Perdition is the second in a series of Adventures for Rapture: The End of Days, which can be run as stand alone missions, or fit neatly together as part of a larger story arc leading humanity back to Earth... and the ulimate battle for humanity's last souls.<br/><br/>     Richly detailed adventure for between 3 and 6 players using the Rapture: The End of Days rules System.<br/>     More than 30 thoughtfully crafted NPCs with motives and goals that can twist the plot in all manner of dangerous directions!<br/>     Five new &quot;Foes of Man&quot; for your poor Heroes to face, one of which is a major threat!<br/>     Hi-quality schematics of the MentAI Research Outpost on a  quarantined world.<br/>     Multimedia files: Pirate demands, landing instructions, research logs and more!

The game was originally released by First Star Software in 1982, on December 7th. The player is an astronaut who pilots a saucer-shaped fighter ship against aliens bent on destroying Earth. The enemy aliens attack the player with an endless supply of attack saucers; however, they are but a mere distraction. The real threat to Earth are the 16 Megamines that start at the end of the universe and then slowly and silently make their way towards planet Earth, displayed in the center of the screen. If a single Megamine manages to reach Earth, the planet explodes in a spectacular explosion. The player's saucer scrolls in eight directions and the player can shoot in all directions. The game features Single Thrust Propulsion, which lets the player lock their ship on course and continue to travel in the desired direction while simultaneoulsy shooting in ANY of the 8 directions. The game's music is an endless loop of the 1812 Overture. Once the player destroys all 16 Megamines in a given level, he or she is able to move to the next level. Every four levels, there is an animation in which the pilot receives a hero's welcome with a parade that grows with each viewing.<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;Astro Chase,&quot; available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "128242": {"poll": [], "name": "Find Mii II", "videogamemode": ["Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["Nintendo 3DS Integrated edition"], "average": "6.3", "videogameseries": ["Find Mii"], "videogametheme": ["Other"], "videogamegenre": ["RPG"], "videogamedeveloper": ["Nintendo Co., Ltd."], "videogamefranchise": ["Mii Plaza"], "videogameplatform": ["Nintendo 3DS"], "usersrated": "5", "statistics": [], "videogamepublisher": ["Nintendo Co., Ltd."], "description": "User Summary<br/><br/>Find Mii II is a simple RPG included with Nintendo 3DS systems.

Ordinary game play involves partners seated across from one another, with their opponents at right angles to them: air and fire vs. water and earth. Setup is on the right-hand half of the nearest two rows, so that pawns generate a sort of spiral motion on the board as a whole.<br/><br/>Each player has nine chessmen (4 pawns, knight, queen, bishop, rook, and king), and piece movement varies slightly from standard modern chess, especially in the case of the queen. Pawns are promoted only to the corresponding piece of their native file. Each of the 36 chessmen has a correspondence to a given Egyptian god or goddess, and all of the board squares correspond to letters in the Angelic Tablets of Renaissance magicians John Dee and Edward Kelly.<br/><br/>"}, "128273": {"rpgdesigner": ["Gary Gygax"], "rpgitemversion": ["First Printing"], "poll": [], "name": "Cheers Gary", "rpgartist": ["Erol Otus"], "rpgproducer": ["Paul Hughes", "Josh Roby"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1375221.jpg", "usersrated": "0", "average": "0", "statistics": [], "rpg": ["Books about Roleplaying Games"], "rpgpublisher": ["Gygax Memorial Fund"], "rpgcategory": ["Non-Game Book (but RPG Related)", "Non-Rankable Item (item will not show in the rankings)"], "rpggenre": ["Generic / Universal"], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1375221_t.jpg", "description": "From the back cover:<br/><br/>A man with millions of fans has as many reasons not to answer all of their questions, but Gary didn't let that stop him.

There are no intelligent alien species, travel between the stars is commonplace, friendly robots called Automatons live somewhere between slaves and family members; and a virtual reality internet called Gaia is the backbone of civilisation.<br/><br/>In a single session, Characters will be exploring long deserted colonies, abandoned spacecraft, starting bar fights, hacking into corporate files, escaping colonies invaded by Droids and zipping between the stars.

It is mechanically inspired by such brilliant push-your-luck games as Zed Deck and Lord of the Rings: The Adventure Deck Game.  Each turn, you flip the top card of the deck and select one of the three aspects of the card on which to bid: advertising, money, or clients.  You then bid as little or as much money as you like.<br/><br/>The card then tells you how many cards to reveal from the top of the deck for the game's counter bid.  You add up the money scores from those revealed cards.  If you bid higher, you win the flipped card!  All revealed cards are placed face-up on the bottom of the deck.  The flipped card is also place face-up, but may be turned sideways to expose the advertising ability if you won the card, or turned upside-down to indicate that you won the clients.<br/><br/>Advertisements give you abilities that allow you to win certain kinds of bids more easily or otherwise manipulate the game rules.  Clients count as Victory Points at the end of the game.  You only gain $2 at the beginning of each turn, so keep an eye on your cash flow, or you'll lose out on important clients or key advertising abilities!<br/><br/>When you have gone through the entire deck (all cards are face-up), simply count up the client values of all the upside-down cards.

The hook, and the mechanism that combats inflation is that you may choose to rip a full bill into halves, which in the game, counts as two copies of that &quot;card&quot;, but in the real world, causes a smidgen of deflation (the rules state that you must throw away torn bills after the game).<br/><br/>"}, "128312": {"rpgartist": ["(Uncredited)"], "rpgitemversion": ["Spanush Screen"], "statistics": [], "name": "Yggdrasill: Game Master Screen", "rpgdesigner": ["Neko"], "rpgproducer": ["(Uncredited)"], "rpg": ["Yggdrasill"], "usersrated": "1", "rpggenre": ["History (Vikings)", "Mythology / Folklore"], "rpgpublisher": ["Holocubierta Ediciones"], "rpgcategory": ["Accessory (dice, maps, screens, cards)"], "poll": [], "average": "7", "description": "Publisher Blurb<br/><br/>This screen consists on four A4 panels that form a 840 x 297 mm screen.<br/><br/>The screen comes with a 16 pages booklet with minor gods and their history, legendary powerful items and their history and statistics, and important NPC's and their history and stats.<br/><br/>"}, "128313": {"rpgartist": ["(Uncredited)"], "rpgitemversion": ["Spanish First Edition"], "statistics": [], "name": "Yggdrasill: Los Nueve Mundos", "rpgdesigner": ["Neko"], "rpgproducer": ["(Uncredited)"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1375876.jpg", "usersrated": "0", "average": "0", "rpggenre": ["History (Vikings)", "Mythology / Folklore"], "rpgpublisher": ["Holocubierta Ediciones"], "rpg": ["Yggdrasill"], "rpgcategory": ["Campaign Setting (game world)"], "poll": [], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1375876_t.jpg", "description": "publisher blurb<br/><br/>Los Nueve Mundos (The Nine Realms) is Yggdrasyll's  campaign setting.<br/><br/>It includes information about the nine realms of Scandia:<br/><br/>MUSPELHEIMR, realm of fire<br/>NIFLHEIMR, realm of mist<br/>J&Ouml;TUNHEIMR, realm of the giants<br/>ASGARDR, realm of the &AElig;sir<br/>ALFHEIMR, realm of the Alfar<br/>VANAHEIMR, realm of the Vanir<br/>NIDAVELLIR, realm of the Dvergar<br/>MIDGARDR, realm of the Humans<br/>SVARTALFHEIMR, realm of the exiled<br/><br/>The book includes new creatures, new attributes for NPCs and even rules to create a mixed-blood character.

He can push, pull, and throw the black ball. Muddy could also dig into soft ground to find underground paths around obstacles. Choosing where to dig was a crucial element of the game's various puzzles, as creating holes in the wrong areas could hinder the player's efforts to advance. Dropping the ball into a hole would cause it to return to its starting point. Given the nature of Muddy's ability to move the ball, digging holes in the wrong places could make reaching the gate with the ball completely impossible, requiring Muddy to leave the screen and then return to try again.

However, while these monsters work well with time thieves and time wardens, those books are not required to make use of this one. Each volume can stand on its own, or they can compliment each other in a campaign that includes all of them.<br/><br/>Like all Mythic Menagerie books, this one covers a range of CRs, from the annoying and hard-to-pin-down CR 1 leap insect, to the CR 22 lord of time, the Chronal Dragon Great Wyrm.

Most death knights are the chosen warriors of gods of undeath and decay, evil psychopaths who desire nothing more than to see the &ldquo;mistake&rdquo; of life replaced by the glorious, unchanging &ldquo;blessing&rdquo; of undeath. Though unquestionably evil, these death knights are often confused as to why anyone would wish to be alive, since life is a condition that leads to hunger, exhaustion, pain, and suffering. Undeath is the perfect state of existence, but even normal death is obviously better than struggling through a life. To these death knights, they are bringing a gift to all living creatures, even if they have to do it one murder at a time.<br/><br/>However, a very few gods of true death also empower death knights specifically to preserve the sanctity of the grave and oppose the forces of the undead. Though the gods of repose have many names in many cultures, the death knights often refer to their divine sponsors as &ldquo;the Grey Mistress&rdquo; and see her as a personification of the state of death itself. To these death knights death is a calm, cool mistress who eventually envelops all things, and undeath is an insult to her. Though such death knights have little care for the living, and are not of good alignment, they can sometimes serve as allies to life-loving champions who must oppose a powerful undead force. Though they see life as a lesser state of being than death, they also see it as a temporary one and know their Grey Mistress will eventually enwrap all living things in her pale embrace.<br/><br/>Role: Evil death knights are villains at their most dangerous &ndash; cunning and linked to the vast fiendish and eldritch forces of undeath. Though they ultimately slay any living creature that associates with them, they see this as a favor rather than a betrayal. Their dark, powerful, brooding nature often attracts the service of necromancers, cultists of death gods, and evil witches with dread patrons &ndash; despite the long history of such death knights killing everyone and everything. Even those death knights unable to lure breathing allies to their side are often seen by undead as worthy equals, and even worthwhile masters.<br/><br/>Neutral death knights are generally agents of supernatural powers that need them to serve as guardians, judges, or avengers. No less able as champions of the grave, neutral death knights see the undead as a violation of the natural order, and are as opposed to them as they are to tomb raiding and desecrations of corpses. Neutral death knights are actually less likely to build organizations of followers or close allies, despite their willingness to let the living come to a natural (rather than untimely) demise. But when a powerful enough undead threat looms, death knights are often willing to submit themselves to the orders of others, albeit temporarily, to achieve their goals.<br/><br/>This 17-page book includes the Death Knight alternate class, three new feats (Deadly Steed, Extra Immunity, Icy Gaze of Death), new anti-paladin spells with deathly themes (death knell, greater; disintegrate undead; grave summoning (I to IX); mask of life; pale mists; spectral eye; take the Low Road; and vigor of the grave), and a brief description of the paths dead spirits use to reach the afterlife - the Low Road.<br/><br/>"}, "128378": {"rpgartist": ["Bret Crane", "Rick Hershey", "RedPeggy"], "rpg": ["Pathfinder System Compatible Product"], "poll": [], "name": "7 War Master Feats", "rpgdesigner": ["Owen K.C.

While solid world- building is a useful skill, you don&rsquo;t always need four paragraphs of flavor text to tell you swords are cool, magic is power, shadows are scary, and orcs are savage. Sometimes a GM doesn&rsquo;t have time to slog through a page of history for every magic weapon. Sometimes all that&rsquo;s needed are a few cool ideas, with just enough information to use them in a game. Sometimes, all you need are bullet points.<br/><br/><br/>    1 With A Bullet Point is a line of very short, cheap PDFs each of which gives the bare bones of a set of related options. It may be five spells, six feats, eight magic weapon special abilities, or any other short set of related rules we can cram into about a page. Short and simple, these PDFs are for GMs and players who know how to integrate new ideas into their campaigns without any hand-holding, and just need fresh ideas and the rules to support them. No in-character fiction setting the game world. No charts and tables. No sidebars of explanations and optional rules. Just one sentence of explanation for the High Concept of the PDF, then bullet points.<br/><br/><br/>The High Concept: Seven feats designed to augment the options and utility of war masters (from The Genius Guide to the War Master) or, if war masters aren&rsquo;t being used in a campaign, that can be taken by classes that receive bonus combat or teamwork feats as class features (using their class levels as war master levels for prerequisites) or characters that have the Leadership feat (using their character level as war master levels for prerequisites).

Though the power word spells do not have any description of how and why they are different from other spells, both their naming convention (each being &ldquo;power word&rdquo; and then a single action or condition) and their unique game mechanics make it clear they are a different kind of magic.<br/><br/>It&rsquo;s also clear that while power words are enchantment (compulsion) [mind-affecting], they aren&rsquo;t limited to forcing a target to do something normally within the power of its conscious mind. There&rsquo;s no rule to suggest that characters can willingly go blind, become stunned, or kill themselves by will alone, yet the power word spells produce those effects. These are, on the other hand, the kinds of things that adventure fiction suggests that a creature&rsquo;s mind can do to itself subconsciously, either as a hypnotic suggestion or as result of trauma. Much as a creature can faint if sufficiently surprised or suffer hysterical blindness if subject to sufficient trauma, power words seem to be able to call upon the powers of the mind to do things beyond conscious control.<br/><br/>When considered from the perspective of adventure and fantasy fiction, it becomes reasonable to wonder what else power words can do. In the expanded spells below, the power of the mind to control the body is expanded to include spontaneous combustion, loss of senses, and potentially permanent changes of alignment and memory. While these are beyond the scope of most enchantment spells, they are certainly no less reasonable than suggesting a creature can will itself to drop dead, as power word kill does.<br/><br/>So, what makes power words different from other spells? Why do they focus their power into a single word that affects the minds of their targets, but don&rsquo;t even need to be heard to be effective? To answer those questions we first take an in-depth look at what we can learn from power word spells&rsquo; unique rules, then present a new game element &ndash; the First Language.<br/><br/>"}, "128381": {"rpgdesigner": ["Lou Agresta"], "rpg": ["Pathfinder System Compatible Product"], "poll": [], "name": "A Brace of Pistols", "rpgartist": ["Jacob Blackmon"], "rpgproducer": ["Jeremy Miller", "R.

No self-respecting pirate captain boards her enemy&rsquo;s ship without a rapier at her belt and a brace of flintlocks in her sash. The genteel highwayman halts the coach with his firearms out. Nobles, sleeves rolled up, turn at ten paces. Weapons crack, and they vanish behind simultaneous plumes of white smoke, their fates momentarily obscured.<br/><br/>A Brace of Pistols contains rules to expand the options for black-powder flintlocks in fantasy campaigns that allow them, supporting the uniquely dramatic flavor of the pistol &ndash; the arresting jab of a gun in the back, the standoff, highway holdups, and the ferocious chaos of ship-to-ship boarding battles &ndash; as well as some unusual real-world firearm variants, and some new fantasy-based rules that mix muskets and magic.<br/><br/>Overview: Flintlocks in Your Game<br/><br/>Despite their cost, black powder flintlock pistols were frequently fired just once and then tossed away. They were prone to misfires and highly inaccurate &ndash; except at dangerously short range &ndash; as well as increasingly less dangerous over distance; up close, they were devastating.<br/><br/>To carry multiple flintlocks, characters must wear holsters. Medium and heavy armor prevents you from wearing certain holsters, as the armor leaves the holstered flintlock difficult or impossible to reach, while rendering the armor awkward or unbalanced. A mounted character in light or no armor has the option to carry up to five pairs &ndash; also called a &lsquo;brace&rsquo; &ndash; of flintlocks ready to be drawn as weapons: one in each hand, two in a chest holster, two through a belt, two in leg holsters, and two in mount holsters. Ten total. Any additional flintlocks must be stored and retrieved as items.<br/><br/>All the rules in A Brace of Pistols work with the early firearm rules found in Ultimate Combat.<br/><br/>"}, "128382": {"rpgartist": ["Jacob Blackmon"], "rpg": ["Pathfinder System Compatible Product"], "poll": [], "name": "Races Revised: The Kobold Kings", "rpgdesigner": ["Owen K.C.

Most common humanoid races believe the kobold kings are just exceptional kobolds &ndash; paragons of their race who, through a quirk of bloodline or an unusual degree of talent and determination, manage to achieve a higher degree of skill in magic or learn more advanced fighting techniques. In some ways this is true &ndash; occasionally, a kobold clan will produce a kobold king child as a throwback to a time when that branch of the race was stronger and closer to their draconic forefathers. But its also an extremely dangerous misunderstanding of what the kobold kings are, for there are places far from other civilized nations where entire kingdoms are populated with the more potent, more noble kin of kobolds. Those nations are generally too far from other settled lands for the kobold king nations to pose a threat, often located in vast cavern systems deep below the ground, in the center of vast swamps, or perches on massive plateaus with no paths to the lowlands. But the day may yet come when the border lands of the humans, elves, and dwarves discover just how numerous and dangerous the kobold kings truly are.<br/><br/>Some lone kobold kings born into tribes of lesser kobolds often have no idea what they truly are, and accept that they are simply more blessed with the courage and power of a distant winged ancestor than their clan-mates. But in lands were the kobold kings have maintained their own civilizations (as well in the few kobold tribes that have remembered how they came to be), the kobold kings know their traditional name. They are the Koldemar, and their history holds the secret of why kobolds think themselves the inheritors of the dragons, and why so few of them show the nobility and power of their distant progenitors.<br/><br/>"}, "128383": {"rpgdesigner": ["Creighton Broadhurst"], "rpg": ["Pathfinder System Compatible Product"], "poll": [], "name": "Pits", "rpgartist": ["William McAusland"], "rpgproducer": ["Creighton Broadhurst"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1898881.jpg", "usersrated": "0", "rpgitemversion": ["PDF Version"], "average": "0", "statistics": [], "rpggenre": ["Fantasy (High Fantasy)"], "rpgpublisher": ["Raging Swan Press"], "rpgcategory": ["Sourcebook (rules/options to enhance play)"], "rpgseries": ["Dungeon Dressing"], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1898881_t.jpg", "description": "Publisher's blurb:<br/><br/>Tired of dungeons lacking in verisimilitude?

In addition to single player races four player splitscreen gameplay is offered and scores can be tracked via online leaderboards. Courses, cars and liveries are unlocked in the single player portion of the game, and these unlocks carry over to the local multiplayer.<br/><br/>The game features four different race car classes, each with unique attributes: N-Dura, Evo GT, Protech and Apex. Within each class five different cars are offered for a total of 20 cars. Each car also features eight different paint liveries. Nine courses are available, and each can be played in a reverse layout.

These tiles will present varying degrees of ice thickness, how slippery the surfaces are, the moraine gradings, crevasses, boulders and more! Each tile requires a different response from the player. Do you dig in and keep climbing? Do you swing to another location (tile)? Or, do you bust out the ice screw and hook in? Either way, you better decide fast, because every time the sand-glass runs out the lowest portion of the mountain crumbles into an avalanche. The players positioning on the board (mountain) will determine if they become part of the avalanche or live to make another tough decision.<br/><br/>The goal of the game is to reach the summit, where a rescue helicopter is waiting.

The atmosphere is composed of 25 % oxygen, 70% Nitrogen, and various trace gasses. 66% of the world's surface is covered with liquid water, much of it locked in the polar ice caps. The land is generally lush, covered with a sprawling green forest which looks black under the red sunlight.

We intend to revise and update the game&rsquo;s core rulebook with each successive season of My Little Pony: Friendship Is Magic, incorporating new lore, mechanics, and rules as they are established by the show. To that end, you won&rsquo;t find everything you want within these pages; we have been very careful only to incorporate essential things and things which have been well-enough established by the show to warrant their inclusion.<br/><br/>What should you expect out of My Little Pony: Roleplaying Is Magic? We are long-time Dungeons &amp; Dragons fans, in addition to many other pen &amp; paper RPG systems, and set out not to simply create a module for My Little Pony: Friendship Is Magic within a pre-existing system, but rather to build a new system from the ground up to support the style of play and the atmosphere of the show. To that end, we don&rsquo;t feel that there is a simple way to explain the game (such as &ldquo;Dungeons &amp; Dragons with ponies&rdquo;); it is its own system.<br/><br/>But we&rsquo;ll try!<br/><br/>My Little Pony: Roleplaying Is Magic is based on both freeform roleplaying as well as concepts from other pen &amp; paper RPG&rsquo;s which many veteran players will surely recognize. It has elements of World Of Darkness, Unisystem, Dungeons & Dragons, Ars Magica, and Mythic, as well as several others in smaller but no less influential ways. The game is very rules-light, and uses interpretation and adaptation, rather than tables and strict rules, to determine not just the outcome of rolls, but the rolls themselves. We believe it is better described as a &ldquo;collaborative storytelling system&rdquo; than as a roleplaying game system.

Each player takes on the role of one of the kingdom&rsquo;s last heroes (nine playable characters), each with a unique set of special abilities, just as they hatch a plan to save the realm.<br/><br/>Searching the kingdom provides new powers and equipment to strengthen you and your party, as well as the keys that can unlock the holy relics and defeat the necromancer. You can acquire many powerful abilities&mdash;unique to each hero&mdash;that can help to fight the undead, elude the necromancer&rsquo;s forces, accelerate your searches for items and artifacts, and more. The knight is a brave and powerful warrior; the prince can rally and inspire the people; the scholar excels at locating and restoring the treasures of the past.<br/><br/>But ravenous undead roam the realm, and as the necromancer continues to build his power base, he blights the land and his army steadily grows. As the game wears on, the necromancer becomes more and more powerful, creating blights more quickly and effectively. If an area becomes too blighted, it gets overrun&mdash;and the monastery receives the spillover. And if the monastery is ever overrun, the necromancer wins and the kingdom is swallowed in darkness!<br/><br/>Before the monastery falls, it's up to you and your party to defeat the necromancer in one of two ways: If you can gather three holy relics and bring them all back to the monastery, you can perform a powerful ritual to break the necromancer&rsquo;s power and scour the land of the undead. Alternatively, you can try to defeat the necromancer in direct combat&mdash;but be warned, he will readily sacrifice his minions to save himself.<br/><br/>Can you save the kingdom from darkness? Do you have the courage, the cunning and the will to withstand the necromancer and his forces?

With this game, you should be able to re-create the game of baseball complete with all the strategy and decisions that the big league manager make on a daily basis.  You set the rosters.  You pick your rotation.  You make the lineups.  All of the game strategies are here.  Do I steal a base?  Do I pinch hit?  Do I leave my pitcher in for one more batter?  Diggin Deep Baseball also re-creates dilemmas that not every tabletop baseball game can re-create.  Does my slugger dig deep now in hopes for a big inning, or save that for later in the game?  My pitcher is hurt, but says he&rsquo;s fine.  Do I yank him now, or keep him in and take the chance that the injury might be more severe?  My all-star catcher has a death in the family and has been put on the bereavement list.  How do I replace his offense?  His defense?  Along with the above, there are several aspects of Diggin Deep Baseball that you&rsquo;ll find makes this a complete tabletop baseball game.<br/>     <br/>Games are played using cards and three ten sided dice.  There are cards provided for every batter with 50ab's and pitchers with at least 25ip.  In a normal at bat sequence, the three ten sided dice create a number from 1 to 1000.  Results of 1 to 500 come from the hitter's card, and 501 to 1000 come from the pitcher's card to resolve the plate appearance.  <br/>     <br/>What sets Diggin Deep Baseball apart from other games is the Diggin Deep Mechanism.  In certain game situations, players can 'Dig Deep' for that little bit extra to tilt the scales in their favor.  In a normal situation, there is a 50/50 chance the  result comes off the hitter's card or the pitcher's card.  When a player 'Digs Deep', that 50/50 chance now becomes 100/0.  This doesn't guarantee a positive result, but it does give you a better chance of success.<br/>     <br/>Diggin Deep Baseball is played just like a real baseball game.  This includes relief pitchers, pinch hitters, pinch runners, injuries, and ejections.  Once you have gameplay down, you should be able to play a full nine inning game in about 30 minutes.<br/><br/>"}, "128464": {"boardgamedesigner": ["Horst Muscheid"], "average": "0", "poll": [], "name": "Auf den Spuren K\u00f6nig Ludwigs II", "playingtime": "0", "minplayers": "0", "boardgamemechanic": ["Roll / Spin and Move"], "yearpublished": "0", "usersrated": "0", "maxplayers": "0", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1466164_t.png", "boardgameartist": ["Achim Theil"], "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["Bayerischer Rundfunk"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1466164.png", "boardgameversion": ["Bayerischer Rundfunk Edition 1995"], "maxplaytime": "0", "boardgamecategory": ["Racing", "Trivia"], "age": "0", "minplaytime": "0", "description": "Advertising game to Bavaria and the Bavarian Radio broadcasts.

And then there was silence. The war ended in 1946 with the nuclear annihilation of the Third Reich but all was not lost, for many German units took shelter in underground vaults where they continued to live, train and develop new weapons. The Reich, oblivious of the climatic, technological and political changes inflicted by more than twenty years of nuclear winter, emerged in 1968 under Himmler's guidance only to find the Fatherland, a barren land now known as the Zone, surrounded by the NATO military and populated by mutants and a mysterious army of elusive beings fighting under the sign of the Black Hand.<br/><br/>It is now 1969. A year has passed since the Reich began its struggle, only to have met a stiffer than anticipated resistance from the Black Hand, their war beasts, and the far too powerful NATO force. The German war machine's bold impetus has been bogged down and turned into a fighting withdrawal as men, equipment and food levels have dwindled to critical levels. To make matters worse, a somber cloud looms over the Germans as Himmler, the Reich's ruthless commander, has been bedridden by a peculiar illness. Feeling that his time may be nearing, Himmler decides to reveal that the relic recovered from the Holterberg monastery during the previous year's campaign may represent the vaults' only hope for survival and the answer to Germany's future.<br/><br/>Scholars of the occult-worshiping Arkanum Korps have discovered that the object is actually a map marker, the link to another artifact, a source of unspeakable power amongst the mortals. Mentioned in writings from the Xth century, dating from the birth of the Holy Roman Empire, it is said that the Charred Heart was responsible for the rise and downfall of the great European kingdoms - a true maker of kings. Its trail had been lost sometime during the 1800s, but there may be a glimmer of hope if, according to the Holterberg relic, it were to be found again somewhere in the East and used to restore Germania Magna. Thus, the much feared Arkanum Korps are tasked, once again, to head out for the Magdeburg ruins, far into the unexplored part of the Zone in search of the Charred Heart artifact.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, in a surprising turn of events, for reasons yet unknown, the Black Hand took on the fight to NATO, thus, deliberately or not, saving the Reich from certain doom. Despite the defeat and subsequent disappearance of their Zealot commander holding the Wunderwaffe blueprints in last year&rsquo;s showdown, seemingly endless swarms of Zealots and Ravagers poured from the crimson woods unto the unsuspecting US and Russian bases, ambushing supply columns and encircling numerous divisions in the war-torn Zone, effectively halting NATO's drive towards the retreating German army.<br/><br/>For NATO there are no options other than to keep going forward. Their political and financial strength can, and must, keep the supply chain intact. Their doctrine dictates that wherever resistance is met, more weight is to be put into the push in order crush the obstacle, and, true to this principle, efforts have been made to increase the power, range and overall effectiveness of all their weapon systems. HADES (Heavy Assault and Demolition Expeditionary Squadron) is the newly assembled formation at the tip of NATO's thrust, closely guided by Russian GRU agents rumored to have psychic powers. Fielding machines and weapons built based on Nikola Tesla's works on the power of electricity and automatons, HADES is already trampling its way to the frontline.<br/><br/>NW68HD introduces the characters, individuals with unique backgrounds and motivations, employing powerful skills, capable to further boost the effectiveness of the platoons they&rsquo;re attached to. Entering the fray is a new guild of unscrupulous, well equipped and perfectly Zone adapted mercenaries ready to shed blood for those willing to pay the most for their brutal services. Still, nothing compares to the horrific creatures lurking in Magdeburg's radioactive shadows, an army of nightmarish creatures marked with a White Hand emblem nearly identical to the infamous black one. Despite the shock, this encounter with the darkness may very well shed some light on the truth behind the Zealots and their origins.<br/> Each Copy of Heart of Darkness Includes:<br/><br/>New, Mounted 22&quot;x 17&quot; Map<br/>    A Beautiful Page of 88 Counters<br/>    Ten Scenarios Relating the Continued Story of the Germanic Wasteland and its Inhabitants<br/>    Player&rsquo;s Aid Card<br/>    Attractive Box<br/><br/>Heart of Darkness is NOT a Complete Game.<br/><br/>You Must own the Original Game, Nuklear Winter &rsquo;68 to Play Heart of Darkness. &quot;<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": ["First edition"], "name": "Nuklear Winter '68: Heart Of Darkness", "playingtime": "60", "boardgamemechanic": ["Chit-Pull System", "Hex-and-Counter"], "average": "7.53571", "boardgameexpansion": [], "usersrated": "14", "age": "12"}, "128475": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1379539.jpg", "poll": [], "boardgamedesigner": ["Eduardo Baraf", "Thomas Denmark"], "statistics": [], "yearpublished": "2012", "maxplayers": "5", "boardgameartist": ["Thomas Denmark"], "boardgamepublisher": ["Atlas Games"], "maxplaytime": "20", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1379539_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "20", "boardgamecategory": ["Card Game"], "description": "Murder of Crows invites you to be the first player to spell &quot;murder&quot; &ndash; but thankfully you don't have to use crow carcasses to do it.<br/><br/>Instead you're spelling the word with letter cards from your hand.

Life was simple and peaceful in the village until a series of brutal murders.  The horrific nature of the killings left no question that werewolves had infiltrated the village.<br/><br/>The villagers had little time to determine who the beasts were.  The werewolves were cunning, and used the paranoia to help the village tear itself apart.  Which side prevailed?<br/><br/>Black Forest is a cooperative board game for 3 to 5 players.  Players win or lose together as members of the village.  However, one player is secretly a werewolf, trying to defeat the other players.  In order to win, the villagers must ascertain which player is the werewolf, and eliminate all of his or her villager tokens in the Court House.<br/><br/>The game is divided into two phases.  In the Day Phase, players take turns placing their Villager tokens on village spaces (like the Fields, where they earn gold; the Market, where they can buy market cards; the Seer, where they can hire the Seer to have a vision on another player, and possibly gain clues about the player's role; or the Court House, where players vote to eliminate a Villager token belonging to one of the players).<br/><br/>In the Night Phase, players are dealt a hand of Night cards, and must choose one and pass the rest, until they have a card chosen for each player in the game.  Cards are then assigned and revealed.  The Night Phase is where the werewolf player tries to eliminate Villager tokens from the game, but also when the villagers try to fortify against werewolf attack.<br/><br/>After every other Night Phase, there is a Harvest, where the players must have enough gold to make it through.  If enough Villager tokens have been eliminated that the Harvest cannot be successful, the werewolf player wins.  Villagers can also win by upgrading all 12 Village tiles, but this involves spending gold that may be necessary for the Harvest.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "3", "boardgameversion": ["First edition"], "age": "12", "name": "Black Forest", "playingtime": "60", "boardgamemechanic": ["Card Drafting", "Partnerships", "Simultaneous Action Selection", "Voting", "Worker Placement"], "average": "7.7625", "usersrated": "8", "boardgamefamily": ["Admin: Cancelled Games", "Crowdfunding: Kickstarter"]}, "128485": {"poll": [], "name": "Jawbreaker II", "videogamemode": ["Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["North American TI-99 edition"], "average": "0", "videogametheme": ["Cartoon"], "usersrated": "0", "videogamedeveloper": ["Sierra Entertainment Inc."], "videogamegenre": ["Arcade"], "videogameplatform": ["TI-99"], "statistics": [], "videogamepublisher": ["Texas Instruments"], "description": "From the box/manual cover:<br/><br/>&quot;Evade the relentless Grinning Gobblers as they chase you through a maze of shifting walls and escape routes.

The player with most tiles is the winner, but it is also playable with just one kid.<br/><br/>Other ideas presented in the booklet include memory games, sorting activities (sort tiles into tools, clothing, construction materials), and telling what an object is used for.<br/><br/>"}, "128500": {"boardgamedesigner": ["Tetsuya Nakamura"], "poll": [], "name": "Panzer Division Kommandeur 2", "playingtime": "240", "minplayers": "1", "boardgamemechanic": ["Dice Rolling", "Hex-and-Counter"], "yearpublished": "2012", "boardgameexpansion": ["168630"], "usersrated": "3", "maxplayers": "2", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1381179_t.jpg", "average": "6.33333", "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["Game Journal"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1381179.jpg", "boardgameversion": ["Game Journal version"], "maxplaytime": "240", "boardgamecategory": ["Wargame", "World War II"], "age": "12", "minplaytime": "240", "description": "It was announced that this should be the remake of &quot;Panzer Division Kommandeur&quot; from Ad-Technos in 1985.<br/><br/>But, it is not the remake.

This is a reason why I make this entry separately.<br/><br/>This version covers only the Eastern front in 1944.  This is another important difference.<br/>One plyer must play a game as a German Panzer Division Kommandeur.  The other player controls the enemy Soviet army leader.<br/>The game uses a random scenario creatiton system.  The area of map is determined by dice and the detail of each force is also determined by dice.  The most important point that the goal of each army is determined by randomly drawn chits.  There are 6 mission chits in the game and each player draw 2 of them secretly.  So, each player now know his goal and some information that his opponent might have.  There are missions, such as breakthrough, conquer, defense and so on.  Each mission gives the player victory points.  At the end of the game, each player calculate his victory points and compare them to determine the winner.<br/><br/>components:<br/>one map, one countersheet, one rulebook<br/>You must prepare dice for play.<br/><br/>"}}
